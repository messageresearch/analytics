[56:53] home when I walked in and you talked to
[56:54] me brother and the singing and and the
[56:57] freedom of the spirit I certainly feel
[56:59] at home and uh it's my first time here
[57:02] at this church and I you know I'd like
[57:04] to read a quote just to start and and
[57:06] and let you all know what I
[57:08] believe amen and and when I when I go to
[57:12] a new church I like to read this quote
[57:16] and you know I think I'm going to start
[57:17] making it a habit AIT every single new
[57:20] church read this quote because it can be
[57:24] you know when a a new Minister comes by
[57:26] can be a little jittery you're kind of
[57:27] feeling them out so you know it's
[57:29] important to know what you're listening
[57:32] to and brother brandom says in questions
[57:34] and answers yes in 64 he says and we do
[57:37] have today by God's help that's right
[57:41] the perfect interpretation of the word
[57:44] with Divine
[57:47] Vindication amen and I I already know
[57:49] that's what this church believes that
[57:51] this message we heard the sister sing is
[57:53] our
[57:54] absolute it's our armor it's what's
[57:57] holding us and brother Brandon preached
[58:00] over and over that this message is the
[58:02] power that'll take us in a
[58:05] Rapture hey man you know brother I was
[58:07] at brother Josh's this Sunday and he
[58:09] told me get your preaching boots on
[58:11] because they're going to preach you and
[58:14] I'm already feeling
[58:16] it so I feel free and I know we believe
[58:19] the same and that's that this message is
[58:22] our absolute and we are not ashamed
[58:25] right we're not not ashamed of the cloud
[58:28] we're not ashamed of the Prophet we're
[58:30] not ashamed of the pillar of fire and we
[58:33] believe that same Pillar of Fire is here
[58:36] tonight and not only is he here tonight
[58:39] but he goes with each and every one of
[58:41] us home he's the one that protects us he
[58:44] watches over our families and brother
[58:46] there may be prodigals that have left
[58:48] the church but that same Pillar of Fire
[58:51] will go after them and he'll bring them
[58:54] back I believe
[58:58] it amen so let's turn to the Bible
[59:01] Genesis CH
[59:03] 24 glory to God Amen I've been here five
[59:08] minutes and three people told me to take
[59:09] off my coat
[59:12] so I'm I'm just taking it off now yes my
[59:16] brother Genesis 24 yes my brother we're
[59:20] going to read verses 1-9 amen amen amen
[59:25] hallelujah
[59:27] glory to God it says and Abraham was old
[59:31] and well stricken in age and the Lord
[59:34] had blessed him in All Things yes and
[59:37] Abraham said unto the eldest servant of
[59:39] his house that ruled over all that he
[59:41] had put I pray thee thy hand under my
[59:44] thigh go ahead and I will make thee
[59:46] swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and
[59:48] the god of the earth that thou shalt not
[59:51] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[59:54] of the Canaanites among whom I dwell
[59:56] that's but Thou shalt go into my country
[59:59] and unto my Kindred and take a wife unto
[1:00:02] my son Isaac in other words you're going
[1:00:04] to take a wife that's how I am a wife
[1:00:07] that has my character I don't want a
[1:00:10] wife that's of the world of Canaan I
[1:00:12] don't want a wife that's marred by the
[1:00:13] world but I want you to go take a wife
[1:00:16] that comes from
[1:00:18] me and he says and the servant said unto
[1:00:21] him peradventure the woman will not be
[1:00:23] willing to follow me into this land must
[1:00:26] I needs bring thy son again unto the
[1:00:28] lands from when thou camest and Abraham
[1:00:30] said Beware that thou bring not my son
[1:00:33] thither again the Lord God Of Heaven
[1:00:36] which took me from my father's house and
[1:00:38] from the land of my Kindred and which
[1:00:40] spake unto me and that swear unto me
[1:00:42] saying unto thy seed will I give this
[1:00:45] land he shall send his Angel before thee
[1:00:48] and thou shalt take a wife unto my son
[1:00:50] from thence amen so who was going to go
[1:00:54] before him
[1:00:56] this wasn't just a servant coming to
[1:00:58] pick a random woman right but this was a
[1:01:02] pre-ordained moment and before the
[1:01:04] servant even went God said I'll send my
[1:01:07] angel to get a prepared
[1:01:11] woman and he says and if the woman is
[1:01:13] not willing to follow thee then you're
[1:01:15] clear from this my oath only bring not
[1:01:18] my son thither again you may have your
[1:01:21] seats glory to God so we know that
[1:01:24] brother brandham talks about and he
[1:01:25] types this with with the Elijah
[1:01:27] messenger that would come and and and
[1:01:29] that was brother brandom that would come
[1:01:31] to to gather a bride that's right and we
[1:01:34] know brother Brandon preached and even
[1:01:35] on on the Thanksgiving message he
[1:01:37] preached about the invisible Union and
[1:01:39] he said the the most thankful thing we
[1:01:41] can think of is that God has chosen us
[1:01:44] and he's given us Redemption that's
[1:01:46] right and brother Brandon preached about
[1:01:48] choosing of a bride and he took this
[1:01:50] scripture and he said God when you see a
[1:01:53] man choose a wife the wife what she
[1:01:56] displays shows what's in the man and he
[1:01:59] said and that types the spiritual that
[1:02:02] God is going to take a bride but the
[1:02:04] type of bride that he'll take shows
[1:02:06] exactly what God is and what is God God
[1:02:09] is the word so brother Brandon said this
[1:02:12] bride that he's come to take has to be a
[1:02:15] word bride not a denominational bride
[1:02:19] not a bride from the world or that tries
[1:02:21] to make her own way but a bride that's
[1:02:23] just like him that's exactly like
[1:02:25] brother brandham said at the words of
[1:02:27] God on the lips of a true Holy Ghost
[1:02:30] filled believer when they speak it he
[1:02:33] said it's the same as deity speaking and
[1:02:36] why is that because the bride is made of
[1:02:38] the same material that God is made of
[1:02:41] That's So brother the brother brother
[1:02:44] Steven asked me for the title of this
[1:02:45] sermon and I said Falling In Love With
[1:02:49] Jesus because I don't believe that God
[1:02:52] sent a prophet and a message to gather
[1:02:55] abro that wouldn't love him but when God
[1:02:58] sent a message it went to gather of
[1:03:01] people that would be so given up so
[1:03:03] surrendered to him that they would love
[1:03:06] him above everything else that's right
[1:03:08] so I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:11] more than ever has to fall in love with
[1:03:14] Jesus and the Bible says he sent his
[1:03:17] begotten son Jesus who was the word so
[1:03:21] more than ever before the bride has to
[1:03:23] be in love with the message exact with
[1:03:27] the word because the message is
[1:03:30] Jesus you know they came and asked Jesus
[1:03:33] came and asked Peter and he said who
[1:03:35] does man say that I am and Peter started
[1:03:37] saying some Say You're Just a a Prophet
[1:03:40] Elijah some Say You're Just John some
[1:03:43] say you're just the master some say
[1:03:45] you're all these things but then Jesus
[1:03:47] looked at on the word and said but who
[1:03:49] do you say I am I no longer want to know
[1:03:52] what they say I am but I want to know a
[1:03:55] person testimony of who you say I am and
[1:03:59] Jesus looked at him and brother brandham
[1:04:01] said brother brandham said Peter didn't
[1:04:04] know him by Flesh and Blood brother
[1:04:07] brandom said Peter didn't know him
[1:04:09] because he walked with him and he saw
[1:04:11] him but Peter knew him by
[1:04:14] Revelation he said Flesh and Blood
[1:04:16] because Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[1:04:20] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[1:04:22] looked at him the word and said Flesh
[1:04:24] and Blood hasn't revealed this to you
[1:04:27] but my Father in Heaven because if Flesh
[1:04:30] and Blood had revealed it to him he
[1:04:32] could fall away if Flesh and Blood had
[1:04:35] revealed it to him he could leave the
[1:04:37] message but when it's a revelation in
[1:04:39] your heart there is nothing on Earth
[1:04:42] that can shake you they can say what
[1:04:45] they want about the pictures they can
[1:04:47] say what they want on the internet but
[1:04:49] when it's revealed unto you and you've
[1:04:51] seen it
[1:04:53] alive more than just a word but the word
[1:04:56] made flesh in your
[1:05:00] life brother this message
[1:05:04] works this message is the
[1:05:06] truth we've seen it take Sinners and
[1:05:10] save them and raise them up make
[1:05:13] preachers out of them make wives out of
[1:05:15] them make Godly mothers out of
[1:05:19] them that's what this message
[1:05:23] does your denom
[1:05:26] ation the world and denomination might
[1:05:29] reform you but this message does more
[1:05:32] than just reform you this message
[1:05:35] completely transforms
[1:05:37] you brother brandham said you become
[1:05:40] transformed and you might have had
[1:05:43] branches laying over you and you grew
[1:05:45] and you were Twisted because Satan wants
[1:05:47] to destroy you but when this message
[1:05:50] came by he loosed you loosed you from
[1:05:53] the power of the enemy loosed you from
[1:05:56] reasoning loose you from
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:04] denomination the bride will fall in love
[1:06:08] with
[1:06:09] Jesus and Jesus is the
[1:06:13] word so many people ashamed of a
[1:06:17] prophet but thank the Lord that we're
[1:06:19] not ashamed of God's messenger because
[1:06:23] it was God's messenger that he s
[1:06:26] to gather a
[1:06:29] bride and
[1:06:31] listen eler said what if she doesn't
[1:06:34] come and I started thinking about
[1:06:35] brother
[1:06:37] brandom when he saw the vision of the
[1:06:39] preview of the
[1:06:40] bride and he saw the first one go by the
[1:06:44] alpha church and she was beautiful to
[1:06:46] look about right long hair dressed
[1:06:50] properly clothed by the
[1:06:53] word but what followed after that was
[1:06:56] denominational and worldly churches
[1:06:58] right and I'm reminded brother brandom
[1:07:00] sat there stood and watched and he wept
[1:07:03] in his heart and he said is this all we
[1:07:05] could
[1:07:07] produce is this all the preaching that
[1:07:10] we did brother Brandon went from side to
[1:07:13] side of the country preaching and he
[1:07:15] thought is this
[1:07:18] all par Adventure she won't
[1:07:21] follow and the voice said Here Comes the
[1:07:24] preview of the the bride and all of a
[1:07:26] sudden here brother brandham looks up
[1:07:28] and here comes the Omega bride that's
[1:07:32] us that's us that believe the same as
[1:07:35] they believed and here she came and
[1:07:37] brother Brandon said she was marching to
[1:07:39] the step of the Gospel Onward Christian
[1:07:44] Soldiers marching ads to
[1:07:47] war brother brandom say she was so
[1:07:50] beautiful to look at she was just like
[1:07:52] the word say she would be
[1:07:57] you know what's the Vindication of this
[1:07:59] message to me more than anything more
[1:08:03] than a sign more than a s a symbol power
[1:08:06] more than a a manifestation because they
[1:08:09] can manifest but what's a indication of
[1:08:12] this message is that it took my life
[1:08:15] that was steeped in sin and it took me
[1:08:18] and it gave me mercy and it lined me up
[1:08:21] with the word
[1:08:28] notice aler came brother it wasn't a
[1:08:32] random
[1:08:34] woman because the angel had already gone
[1:08:36] brother brandham said the Angel Beat him
[1:08:38] by 30 minutes in other words she was
[1:08:42] there and there was already something
[1:08:44] maybe in a song service something just
[1:08:46] moving in her heart the Holy Spirit was
[1:08:49] already working because it was prepared
[1:08:51] land because this Angel wasn't just
[1:08:54] coming for any woman he was coming for a
[1:08:57] specific
[1:08:59] character for a woman that would fall in
[1:09:02] love with
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:06] Jesus and what was her character what
[1:09:09] was the character trait he asked for he
[1:09:12] said Lord let it be that the one that
[1:09:15] comes and gives me to drink and not only
[1:09:18] me to drink but gives my camels to drink
[1:09:20] in other words the one that's a servant
[1:09:23] the one that's willing to submit herself
[1:09:25] the one that's willing to not just take
[1:09:27] a part of it but to take the whole of it
[1:09:31] he says let that one be the one for my
[1:09:33] master brother brandom said when he came
[1:09:37] Rebecca hadn't heard the prayer had no
[1:09:40] clue what he was asking for but it was
[1:09:43] in her it was predestinated in her to do
[1:09:48] what the prophet said she would
[1:09:51] do will I find Faith he said when I come
[1:09:54] to Earth will I find Faith the bride can
[1:09:57] say
[1:09:58] yes because we believe a Vindicated
[1:10:03] Prophet a Vindicated message that will
[1:10:05] take us in a
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:11] Rapture she said I will give you the
[1:10:14] drink and all your
[1:10:16] camels she said just rest and she
[1:10:19] started working and working and you know
[1:10:22] what brother brandham
[1:10:23] said brother brandom said that she was
[1:10:27] watering the very
[1:10:30] power she was watering on a Tuesday
[1:10:34] night the very power that would take her
[1:10:37] to
[1:10:39] Horizon she was watering the Holy Spirit
[1:10:42] and the word that would one day carry
[1:10:45] her straight to glory and that's what
[1:10:47] we're doing in this convention we're
[1:10:50] watering the spirit and the word that we
[1:10:53] believe will take us in a r
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:11:03] brother brother Brandon preached the
[1:11:05] message he cares do you
[1:11:07] care right because now we're talking
[1:11:09] about Rebecca she cared that's she
[1:11:13] absolutely cared and the care that was
[1:11:16] in her the love that was in her didn't
[1:11:18] come from outside it wed up from the
[1:11:21] inside there was something in her she
[1:11:23] couldn't explain it and we can't explain
[1:11:26] it when others turn away we can't
[1:11:28] explain why we stick around why we stay
[1:11:31] the only thing we can say is something
[1:11:33] keeps holding me and it ain't me that's
[1:11:36] holding myself it's not me that's
[1:11:38] holding my family but it's Jesus that
[1:11:41] predestinated me to be a part of this
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:48] bride brother brandom said the bride
[1:11:51] will be bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:11:54] flesh
[1:11:56] that's why on a Tuesday night we can sit
[1:11:58] here and rejoice over the word we don't
[1:12:00] need worldly
[1:12:01] entertainment but we love the word more
[1:12:04] than anything on this Earth we love the
[1:12:06] word and we're submitted to the word and
[1:12:09] it feeds our souls brother brandom said
[1:12:11] the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[1:12:16] word she was
[1:12:18] preprepared
[1:12:22] ground it didn't matter what had
[1:12:24] happened in her life life it didn't
[1:12:26] matter what she had gone through it
[1:12:28] didn't matter how she was raised it
[1:12:31] didn't matter that her mom and her her
[1:12:33] father and her brother didn't have the
[1:12:35] same
[1:12:36] calling if you continue reading in the
[1:12:38] story The servant gives them precious
[1:12:41] gifts that's right so they had precious
[1:12:44] gifts but Rebecca wanted more than just
[1:12:46] a
[1:12:47] gift she wasn't satisfied just with
[1:12:50] gifts she wanted a real true experience
[1:12:54] and a marriage with
[1:12:56] Jesus and this bride wants more than
[1:12:59] just gifts we want the gifts but what we
[1:13:02] want is a true relationship with Jesus
[1:13:05] Christ and that's what this message
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:12] produces Falling In Love With
[1:13:17] Jesus Falling in Love with the
[1:13:20] word willing to water it yes sir day by
[1:13:24] day when times are good you water it
[1:13:27] when times are hard you water it you
[1:13:30] just keep watering this message and
[1:13:32] watch it it'll carry you all the way
[1:13:36] home you know brother Brandon talked
[1:13:38] about the the showdowns sir the Mount
[1:13:41] Caramel Showdown that's right the mount
[1:13:43] Transfiguration Showdown and every
[1:13:46] single one of those showdowns what it
[1:13:48] was was Jesus showing his word was
[1:13:51] true everything around it might have
[1:13:53] seemed like it wasn't making sense and
[1:13:55] it wasn't going to come to be but when
[1:13:57] The Showdown came Elijah stood and said
[1:14:01] at your command Lord you told me to do
[1:14:03] this and at your command let fire fall
[1:14:06] and Jesus Vindicated the message of a
[1:14:09] prophet when that fire fell and it
[1:14:12] consumed the
[1:14:14] sacrifice they didn't believe Jesus was
[1:14:16] the word born a
[1:14:20] fornication a sinner he you know his
[1:14:22] mother was in sin and they tried to hide
[1:14:25] and now he says he's he's just a Man
[1:14:27] from
[1:14:28] Nazareth but when he came to that
[1:14:31] mountain and there the disciples were
[1:14:33] and watched him and God came down and
[1:14:36] confirmed his word he said this is my
[1:14:39] beloved Son and every single believer
[1:14:42] will need a confirmation that God comes
[1:14:45] down and said this is my beloved Son and
[1:14:48] I am pleased to dwell in
[1:14:53] them brother that's the Holy Spirit when
[1:14:57] God comes down and confirms it you've
[1:15:00] spoken it you've said you're a Believer
[1:15:02] you said you're filled but when God
[1:15:04] comes down confirms that he says I am
[1:15:07] pleased to dwell in
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] you and when the Holy Spirit dwells in
[1:15:15] you it turns you to the
[1:15:17] word and can I say it turns you to this
[1:15:21] message which is the word to say we just
[1:15:25] have the message of a man and we just
[1:15:27] have about message message message and
[1:15:29] they could realize this message is the
[1:15:31] same that it's ever been it was in the
[1:15:33] Garden of Eden it was with Abraham it
[1:15:36] was that rock that followed the children
[1:15:38] of Israel in the wilderness and he came
[1:15:40] in flesh he gave his life for us and
[1:15:43] this day he came to take a
[1:15:47] [Applause]
[1:15:49] bride where the random says he cares do
[1:15:52] you care right the question isn't
[1:15:56] whether Jesus
[1:15:57] cares right that is not the question
[1:15:59] people say does Jesus love me Jesus
[1:16:02] Loves
[1:16:03] You Jesus loves even
[1:16:07] Sinners Rich Young Ruler came to
[1:16:10] him and said what do I do to have
[1:16:13] eternal
[1:16:14] life and the Bible says Jesus looking on
[1:16:17] him loved
[1:16:20] him but this Rich Young Ruler wasn't
[1:16:22] going to follow but he loved
[1:16:25] him so the question isn't whether Jesus
[1:16:28] loves you or not the question is do you
[1:16:31] love Jesus enough to follow him the
[1:16:36] question wasn't whether Jesus loved the
[1:16:37] Rich Young Ruler was it does the Rich
[1:16:39] Young Ruler love him
[1:16:42] enough Falling In Love With
[1:16:46] Jesus for God so greatly in the
[1:16:50] Amplified so greatly loved and dearly
[1:16:53] prized the world
[1:16:55] that he even gave his one and only
[1:16:57] begotten son that whosoever would
[1:17:00] believe and trust in him as a savior
[1:17:03] shall not perish but have eternal life
[1:17:06] so Jesus loves the world and he loves
[1:17:11] you but now the question then
[1:17:14] is do you love
[1:17:17] him right because if you love him and
[1:17:21] you if you love this word and if you let
[1:17:23] it take over your life there is no way
[1:17:26] you can
[1:17:28] turn Peter stood there and they were all
[1:17:31] turning 70 turned all these turned and
[1:17:34] Jesus looked at him and said will you go
[1:17:36] also and Peter looked around and said
[1:17:39] you know I'm a little confused right now
[1:17:41] I don't know what's going on why are my
[1:17:43] friends leaving but one thing I
[1:17:46] know that I'm not leaving because I
[1:17:50] believe you are the true Son of
[1:17:52] God and it wasn't something that he he
[1:17:55] just did of his own but it wed up within
[1:18:02] him so so how important is it to love
[1:18:05] him
[1:18:07] hallelu brother brandham says unless you
[1:18:10] are deeply sincere take your
[1:18:13] time and you cannot be sincere until you
[1:18:17] positive understand in other words you
[1:18:20] can't actually love him until you
[1:18:23] realize who he is
[1:18:26] right you can't actually love this
[1:18:29] message how you're supposed to because
[1:18:32] it'll take a special love of this
[1:18:34] message to take you in a
[1:18:36] Rapture it'll take a special love for
[1:18:39] what God has done in our day love and
[1:18:42] faith to believe that it is for me and
[1:18:45] it'll take
[1:18:47] me but unless you're positive
[1:18:50] am yes sir in your heart not in your
[1:18:55] mind but in your heart that this message
[1:18:59] is true then it doesn't matter what
[1:19:01] comes against your
[1:19:03] mind Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll
[1:19:06] build my church and what was that
[1:19:08] Revelation who Jesus
[1:19:11] was and the Revelation today is who
[1:19:16] Jesus
[1:19:18] is not here people get confused they
[1:19:22] call us manf followers but it's
[1:19:25] Jesus brother brandham said I was the
[1:19:27] only one that was near when he came
[1:19:32] by and brother Brandon might not be here
[1:19:35] now but that same Pillar of Fire is here
[1:19:38] and it's anointed a bride and it will
[1:19:40] carry us
[1:19:42] home that same Jesus the
[1:19:46] Capstone the head of the church has come
[1:19:50] and now the body of the church is
[1:19:52] following the head
[1:19:55] and brother Brandon said where the head
[1:19:56] turns the body goes with it if the head
[1:20:01] says healing for you the body says
[1:20:03] healing for me if the head says the
[1:20:06] prodigal will return the body says amen
[1:20:09] they
[1:20:15] will if the head tells me I don't need
[1:20:18] to be afraid then I just say Amen Lord I
[1:20:22] won't be afraid
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:28] brother brandham
[1:20:30] says if you're
[1:20:32] presuming or
[1:20:34] guessing or hoping so he said then there
[1:20:38] cannot be the depths of
[1:20:40] sincerity that God
[1:20:45] requires not sincerity that you ought to
[1:20:48] have but that God
[1:20:53] requires there's a
[1:20:56] sincerity on the part of the Bride that
[1:20:59] God absolutely requires because a a
[1:21:03] husband a man won't come to take a bride
[1:21:06] that doesn't love
[1:21:08] him what kind of a marriage is that to
[1:21:12] come and take a woman to be your wife
[1:21:14] and she doesn't love
[1:21:16] you to come and take a woman to be your
[1:21:19] wife that still wants to flirt with the
[1:21:21] world that still wants to flirt with
[1:21:23] denomination
[1:21:25] that still wants to go around town and
[1:21:27] do things that's not a wife he's looking
[1:21:30] for he's looking for a wife that is so
[1:21:33] dedicated to him completely sold out
[1:21:37] given to him that whatever he wants I
[1:21:40] want to do for
[1:21:42] him if he wants me to believe I'll
[1:21:45] believe if he wants me to stand I'll
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:52] Stand you know that's why they get
[1:21:54] confused and they think you just are
[1:21:56] woman
[1:21:57] beaters and you just have rules they
[1:22:01] don't realize we're in
[1:22:04] love and it's a supernatural love it's
[1:22:07] not a felio love but it's an agapo love
[1:22:11] that we're so in love that whatever God
[1:22:13] says through his Prophet We
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:22] Believe Eve was not the kind of wife
[1:22:25] he's looking for Eve is not the kind of
[1:22:28] bride God is looking for because Eve was
[1:22:31] willing to look another way when a
[1:22:34] greasy Slicker brother brandham said
[1:22:36] came by Eve was willing to listen and
[1:22:39] look and reason what she had no reason
[1:22:42] to because God had given her the word
[1:22:44] already she was already under headship
[1:22:48] and she gave it up to go after a greasy
[1:22:50] Slicker that brought death and brother
[1:22:53] brandom said we were born in sin because
[1:22:56] of them for no fault of our own we were
[1:22:59] sold into sin but he said when there's a
[1:23:02] seed in you you might have been born
[1:23:04] into your first nature no fault of your
[1:23:07] own but when that word comes over and
[1:23:10] that nature dies a new nature comes
[1:23:12] forth he said that was your original
[1:23:15] nature how it was supposed to
[1:23:21] be Satan likes to remind us of our past
[1:23:25] but that's the old nature that's dead
[1:23:28] and
[1:23:29] buried I have a new
[1:23:32] [Applause]
[1:23:39] nature but
[1:23:41] there's the devil is the enemy of your
[1:23:46] faith and in this last days Paul would
[1:23:50] talk to Timothy sir and he said for this
[1:23:52] know also that in the last days peril
[1:23:54] time shall
[1:23:55] come for men shall be lovers of their
[1:23:58] own selves not of God of their own
[1:24:00] selves Covetous boers proud blasphemers
[1:24:06] disobedient to parents unth thankful
[1:24:08] Unholy without natural affection truce
[1:24:11] Breakers false accusers incontinence
[1:24:14] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:24:17] despisers of the Bride what has the
[1:24:19] bride ever done that's bad all we've
[1:24:22] ever done is help all we've ever done is
[1:24:24] be the one that they call when they need
[1:24:27] prayer right they won't talk to you at
[1:24:29] all until they need prayer and then they
[1:24:31] know where to turn not because we're
[1:24:33] special but because they know where
[1:24:35] Jesus is they might not want to admit it
[1:24:39] but they know where Jesus is brother
[1:24:42] Bram said Jezebel might have not wanted
[1:24:45] to admit it but Elijah was her
[1:24:49] pastor and they might not want to admit
[1:24:51] it but this message is the message to
[1:24:54] this age both Believers and
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:02] unbelievers he said there'll be traitors
[1:25:05] highminded lovers of
[1:25:07] pleasure more than lovers of
[1:25:12] God that should not be the bride and
[1:25:16] that will not be the bride the bride
[1:25:19] will not be a lover of pleasure more
[1:25:22] than a lover of God
[1:25:25] no
[1:25:27] absolutely in Matthew 24 when Jesus is
[1:25:30] talking about the end time condition he
[1:25:33] says and then shall many be offended and
[1:25:36] shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:25:39] one another and many false prophets
[1:25:41] shall rise false preachers shall rise
[1:25:45] and shall deceive many he says and
[1:25:47] because iniquity will abound the love of
[1:25:51] many will get cold
[1:25:55] right because there's so much
[1:25:57] iniquity because there's so much
[1:25:59] iniquity and it's so easily accessible
[1:26:01] it's in your pocket you pull out a phone
[1:26:03] and there's iniquity you go on Instagram
[1:26:06] and there's iniquity you go on Facebook
[1:26:08] iniquity everywhere you go there's
[1:26:10] iniquity and because of that many are
[1:26:12] drawn to that and their love for the
[1:26:15] word their first love that the Bible
[1:26:18] says you left your first love they grow
[1:26:20] cold on that first love which is Jesus
[1:26:24] and start looking after others just like
[1:26:26] Eve
[1:26:29] did that's why it is so important to
[1:26:31] fall in love with Jesus to fall in love
[1:26:36] with the
[1:26:38] message which is
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:45] Jesus you know it's funny because I had
[1:26:47] this quote
[1:26:49] here in my notes already and I was
[1:26:52] walking through the woods yesterday
[1:26:53] morning
[1:26:55] with my little boys and we're going
[1:26:56] exploring it's huge Woods to them it's
[1:26:58] not that big but when they're little
[1:27:00] they're
[1:27:01] explorers and I had my oldest he's seven
[1:27:05] then my 5-year-old and my three-year-old
[1:27:07] well my three-year-old I mean the they
[1:27:08] can be pretty steep and slippery and and
[1:27:11] all these leaves and so you know I have
[1:27:13] to hold him and watch him carefully but
[1:27:15] then I also had my you know my
[1:27:18] nephew also little also had to watch him
[1:27:21] and so we're going and every step we
[1:27:23] take I'm saying follow me and there's
[1:27:26] something about little kids that you say
[1:27:28] follow me and they think it means lead
[1:27:30] go
[1:27:30] forward but that's not what a parent
[1:27:32] means when a parent says follow me he
[1:27:35] means follow me don't try to make your
[1:27:37] own way follow me because if you try to
[1:27:40] make your own way you'll fall you'll get
[1:27:43] hurt and this message came so that we
[1:27:45] would follow it not to try to make our
[1:27:48] own way because if we make our own way
[1:27:51] we'll be in hell but if we follow this
[1:27:53] message
[1:27:54] he will make sure we make it all
[1:27:57] right can I just say to everybody that's
[1:28:00] afraid it's going to be
[1:28:02] okay Satan might have attacked you with
[1:28:05] fear and anxiety but I want to say by
[1:28:07] the holy spirit it's going to be
[1:28:10] okay it's going to be just fine the Holy
[1:28:14] Spirit tells you it's going to be just
[1:28:20] fine so I have this quote and as I'm
[1:28:22] going and you know there's a little
[1:28:23] creep
[1:28:24] uhh and we have to cross the creek and
[1:28:26] again with the little ones I want to
[1:28:27] make sure nobody's and so I you know
[1:28:30] you're Crossing and you're stepping
[1:28:31] making sure it's solid and I see this
[1:28:33] piece of wood brother brandom talked
[1:28:35] about it it looked
[1:28:39] solid it looked like it could carry me
[1:28:41] over the
[1:28:43] creek from the outside it looked
[1:28:46] perfectly
[1:28:47] stable but as soon as I stepped on it it
[1:28:52] crumbled because was rotten brother Bram
[1:28:55] said on the outside it looks fine on the
[1:28:58] outside it looks strong but on the
[1:29:01] inside it's rotten and what it can't do
[1:29:05] it can sit there and look good but what
[1:29:07] it can't do is bear the burden of
[1:29:10] another and God has come here for
[1:29:13] Christians that are able to Bear the
[1:29:16] burdens of one another not to just sit
[1:29:19] in church and look good but to actually
[1:29:22] have something in you
[1:29:24] that when somebody needs help you can
[1:29:27] bear their burden you can say I'll pray
[1:29:29] for
[1:29:32] you brother Brandon talked about the
[1:29:34] sister he stopped in Memphis God down
[1:29:37] that
[1:29:39] plane God brought that plane down I
[1:29:42] believe and he's walking and what you
[1:29:45] know what he's
[1:29:46] doing he's doing what every Born Again
[1:29:50] believer should do following the leading
[1:29:53] of the spirit
[1:29:56] because if it would have been up to
[1:29:57] brother brandom I can't miss my
[1:30:01] flight I got to make it somewhere you
[1:30:04] know we're busy busy busy got to make it
[1:30:05] somewhere sometimes the Holy Spirit
[1:30:07] wants you to just get still and let me
[1:30:09] lead you I'll take care of the flight
[1:30:13] I'll take care of the problems I'll do
[1:30:15] the saving I'll do the healing let me
[1:30:18] just lead you so brother brandom's
[1:30:20] walking and he comes by and he he has no
[1:30:23] idea what he's doing brother God hasn't
[1:30:25] actually told him what he's
[1:30:27] doing God just said
[1:30:30] follow but God was already working just
[1:30:34] like Rebecca on the other side the
[1:30:37] prophet himself had no
[1:30:39] clue the preacher himself may have no
[1:30:42] clue he may come from Florida has no
[1:30:45] idea what's going on in the church but
[1:30:47] when God's working on the other side and
[1:30:51] you can have one person surrender and
[1:30:54] you can have the other surrender God can
[1:30:56] do great things he walks by and there's
[1:30:59] this sister yes sir and she says good
[1:31:02] morning Parson and brother brandom just
[1:31:04] stops for a moment know how' you know
[1:31:08] and she says God told me you were coming
[1:31:11] she said I'm like that Shai notice what
[1:31:13] God told her where is my
[1:31:17] Elijah not where is a preacher she
[1:31:20] didn't just need a preacher what she
[1:31:22] needed was Elijah
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] and this is the same spirit that has
[1:31:29] come over our lives we didn't know we
[1:31:32] had no clue you might have been in a
[1:31:34] barroom you might have been in a
[1:31:35] denominational Church wherever you were
[1:31:38] in the world you had no clue but
[1:31:40] something came down and you started
[1:31:42] looking where is my
[1:31:44] Elijah where is my
[1:31:47] messenger where is the one that will
[1:31:49] give me what I need
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:54] brother Brandon said do you know who I
[1:31:56] am she said
[1:31:58] nope I
[1:32:00] don't but I have a connection with one
[1:32:03] who knows brother Brandon went in to
[1:32:06] pray with her and he said you pray first
[1:32:08] and when she got on her knees he said I
[1:32:10] could tell she had prayed and talked to
[1:32:13] God
[1:32:14] before he didn't walk into a
[1:32:17] house that was not surrendered to God
[1:32:20] now the the young man might have gone
[1:32:22] into the world and got it into his
[1:32:25] problems and had his diseases but here
[1:32:27] was one standing in the Gap a mother
[1:32:31] standing in the gap for her
[1:32:34] son and she was standing there saying I
[1:32:37] need my Elijah somebody to touch my son
[1:32:40] I can't do it myself but I need somebody
[1:32:42] greater than me to do
[1:32:44] it brother brandom said I could tell
[1:32:47] she'd already prayed she'd already
[1:32:49] talked to God she was no stranger to
[1:32:52] God amen amen yes my
[1:32:56] brother to God and God healed her
[1:33:00] son when when the Elijah came
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:06] by I will send you
[1:33:10] Elijah Elijah won't just come of his own
[1:33:13] accord he said if it was up to me I
[1:33:16] would have been a Trapper but he said I
[1:33:18] haven't been disobedient to the heavenly
[1:33:21] vision
[1:33:24] he said I will send you Elijah to do
[1:33:28] what Falling In Love With Jesus right to
[1:33:31] turn your heart not to turn your mind
[1:33:36] not to turn your knowledge not to give
[1:33:38] you thoughts and make you smart and make
[1:33:41] you think you're smarter than somebody
[1:33:43] but I'm sending you this message to turn
[1:33:45] your heart back to the faith of
[1:33:49] God you know what Paul said yes sir if I
[1:33:53] had every
[1:33:55] gift he says if I had all
[1:33:58] knowledge right because so many just
[1:34:01] want knowledge and that's why you have
[1:34:03] so many preachers fall away because all
[1:34:06] they had was a head
[1:34:08] knowledge all they had was an idea they
[1:34:12] studied it brother brandom said it'll
[1:34:14] take more than comparing quotes to
[1:34:16] quotes scripture to scripture but he
[1:34:19] said it'll take a revelation from God
[1:34:22] and he said if revelation is beyond you
[1:34:25] look up ask God for
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] it he sent Elijah to turn our hearts and
[1:34:35] Paul said I could have all all in other
[1:34:37] words in other
[1:34:39] words I could explain all he said all
[1:34:45] Mysteries but he said but if I don't
[1:34:48] have
[1:34:51] love love love for one
[1:34:55] another love for those around you love
[1:34:59] for God love for his word because if you
[1:35:02] have love for the word then the
[1:35:04] knowledge might not be there but God
[1:35:07] lives in the
[1:35:08] heart God lives in the heart and he
[1:35:11] leads you and guides you into all
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] truth so we must fall in love with
[1:35:21] Jesus it's a requirement to be sincere
[1:35:26] it's a requirement to treat as more than
[1:35:28] just a gathering but we come to worship
[1:35:31] our Lord worship Our Redeemer to water
[1:35:34] the power he's given us in this day to
[1:35:38] save
[1:35:40] us brother brandom's talking about that
[1:35:43] log yes sir he said what made it worse
[1:35:47] was that it was laying in the
[1:35:50] Stream where water is and he said how
[1:35:54] like a Christian that can sit in a
[1:35:56] church pew where water is
[1:35:59] Flowing where Rivers of Life are flowing
[1:36:03] and can sit
[1:36:05] there yet be rotten on the
[1:36:07] inside because they haven't surrendered
[1:36:10] themselves he says you get rotten twice
[1:36:13] as
[1:36:18] fast and then brother Brandon says then
[1:36:20] what is we have to overcome but he says
[1:36:23] what is overcome in the same quote he
[1:36:26] says to keep life in
[1:36:30] you to keep it in you not to just keep
[1:36:34] it in the pastor or in your favorite
[1:36:36] song leader or to keep it in your mother
[1:36:39] or your father but you need to find life
[1:36:42] and take it in you and then keep it in
[1:36:45] you not just keep it in you on a Sunday
[1:36:48] or Tuesday or Wednesday but when you go
[1:36:50] home when you're at your computer when
[1:36:52] you pull out your phone when you're
[1:36:54] amongst your friends keep life in
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:03] you brother brandom talked about in the
[1:37:06] choosing of a bride two couples he
[1:37:10] married he said one of them they were
[1:37:12] really rich
[1:37:15] people their parents really rich and
[1:37:18] they had the the nicest most expensive
[1:37:21] greatest ceremony yeah it was
[1:37:24] beautiful it seemed the parts and
[1:37:27] brother Brandon said he married them but
[1:37:29] he said a couple months later he went by
[1:37:32] and he said you know I probably
[1:37:33] shouldn't do this but he said I went by
[1:37:35] and I just sat down to hear what was
[1:37:36] going
[1:37:37] on and when he over heard they weren't
[1:37:40] in
[1:37:42] love they were
[1:37:44] arguing and why were they arguing
[1:37:47] because the wife had been flirting with
[1:37:49] another man because they'd gone to a
[1:37:52] party where they shouldn't be and she
[1:37:55] was busy dancing with another man she
[1:37:58] wasn't what God is looking for in a
[1:38:00] bride because she was just like Eve was
[1:38:03] willing to look around and dance with
[1:38:05] somebody
[1:38:07] else he said I also married another
[1:38:10] couple that's right they were poor
[1:38:13] didn't have
[1:38:15] much and so he said I asked them a few
[1:38:18] questions such as where do you have
[1:38:20] somewhere to take her can you provide
[1:38:23] living for her and here this young man
[1:38:26] says he doesn't say I can give her
[1:38:28] everything he says I'll do everything I
[1:38:31] can I will not stop trying to provide
[1:38:34] for
[1:38:36] her but then brother brandham looked at
[1:38:38] the young lady and he said sister what
[1:38:41] are you going to do when he doesn't give
[1:38:43] you healing right
[1:38:45] away what are you going to do when he
[1:38:47] doesn't answer your prayer how you want
[1:38:49] it right
[1:38:50] away what are you going to do when he
[1:38:52] says no to your prayer she looked at him
[1:38:56] and she said I'll stick right by
[1:38:59] him I'll believe him even if he said no
[1:39:02] to my prayer even if the answer takes
[1:39:05] long to come but I'll stick right by him
[1:39:09] and that's the
[1:39:11] bride you might pray and ask for the
[1:39:14] prodigal and it might take time and time
[1:39:16] and time but you'll stick right there
[1:39:19] believing
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:24] am brother Brandon said I could tell
[1:39:28] they were in
[1:39:30] love that was actual love a bride loving
[1:39:35] her
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:41] bridegroom so that means if you love him
[1:39:44] his yeses and his NOS are as good as one
[1:39:49] [Applause]
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:50] another if you love him and he doesn't
[1:39:54] answer your prayer like you thought he
[1:39:55] would this is what true Holy Spirit
[1:39:58] revelation will do to a Believer they
[1:40:01] won't say well God didn't answer how I
[1:40:03] wanted it I'm leaving they'll say like
[1:40:05] Peter to whom would we go where else am
[1:40:09] I going to go he might have not given me
[1:40:11] exactly what I wanted but he saved my
[1:40:15] soul he gave me a wedding band a wedding
[1:40:19] band of
[1:40:21] Grace and he left but he said I'm coming
[1:40:24] back for
[1:40:29] you brother brandom said that rich
[1:40:31] couple all it was was a put on and he
[1:40:35] said what a shame for Christians that
[1:40:37] are just a put
[1:40:40] on what a shame for a preacher that is
[1:40:43] just a put
[1:40:46] on what a shame for believers that are
[1:40:50] just to put on hang around when things
[1:40:52] go well but when things start hitting
[1:40:54] the church brother brandham said stick
[1:40:57] closer together he said and follow your
[1:41:00] pastor because he's been ordained to
[1:41:03] lead
[1:41:06] you he's been ordained by the holy
[1:41:11] spirit to guide you through these
[1:41:17] things
[1:41:19] why because we're under
[1:41:22] headship under the leadership of the
[1:41:24] Holy Spirit where it's no longer making
[1:41:27] our own way but now it's Jesus leading
[1:41:30] us not just a preacher a pastor we're
[1:41:33] not corporate here there's not a a
[1:41:35] corporate office but Jesus leading each
[1:41:38] and every member of his
[1:41:46] bride brother brandham
[1:41:49] says the very name Ephesus has a strange
[1:41:53] compound meaning go ahead it means aimed
[1:41:56] at rela and
[1:41:59] relaxed brother brandom says the high
[1:42:02] aspirations of this age that had begun
[1:42:05] with the fullness of the spirit speaking
[1:42:06] about the Ephesian age the depth of God
[1:42:10] whereby they were aiming at the High
[1:42:12] Calling of God began to give way to a
[1:42:16] less watchful
[1:42:19] attitude right a life that began on fire
[1:42:22] for God that couldn't wait till those
[1:42:24] doors open to come to church but if they
[1:42:26] allow it Satan's the enemy of Faith he
[1:42:29] wants to come and draw you away that's
[1:42:32] it and make your love cold till that you
[1:42:35] started out you couldn't wait to come
[1:42:37] and now you might come to evening
[1:42:39] service you might not you might come to
[1:42:41] Wednesday you might not it depends on if
[1:42:43] I have to work or not if I have to make
[1:42:46] a little more money you
[1:42:49] know he says a less Ardent following of
[1:42:53] Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as
[1:42:56] an omen
[1:42:58] listen because this isn't only to the
[1:43:00] Ephesian age of an omen that in the
[1:43:02] future ages the physical vehicle called
[1:43:05] The Church would sink to the awfulness
[1:43:07] of the depths of
[1:43:09] Satan it had become relaxed and it was
[1:43:14] drifting brother bham said the Ephesian
[1:43:16] age had presented to her the opportunity
[1:43:20] for God's best you know this message is
[1:43:24] God's
[1:43:26] best brother brandham said that in the
[1:43:29] end time all of Hell poured out but he
[1:43:33] said when all of Hell poured out God
[1:43:35] opened up heaven and just let it all out
[1:43:39] that when every giant that Satan's ever
[1:43:41] used to destroy a man's life God has
[1:43:44] poured out all of Heaven to fill a bride
[1:43:48] to overcome
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:54] but the Ephesian age had presented to
[1:43:58] her the opportunity for God's best and
[1:44:00] he says and for a while she prevailed
[1:44:02] look at your
[1:44:04] life right I believe church should be
[1:44:07] introspective look at yourself don't
[1:44:10] look at your neighbor don't think about
[1:44:13] the one that didn't come think about
[1:44:15] yourself for a while you've had the
[1:44:17] opportunity for God's
[1:44:20] best right preaching at this church is
[1:44:23] God's best given to the bride in this
[1:44:27] place a foreordained place for Hungry
[1:44:31] souls to come and to receive from
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:37] Jesus for a while she prevailed but then
[1:44:41] she
[1:44:43] relaxed and I'm just going to say we've
[1:44:45] all been
[1:44:47] there we've all been there for a while
[1:44:50] we Prevail young people for a while you
[1:44:52] prevail after you go to a camp
[1:44:54] meeting and then you relax for a while
[1:44:58] after the camp you you you get up from
[1:45:00] The Altar and you say I'm going to throw
[1:45:02] away all the pornography I'm going to
[1:45:04] throw away all the worldly movies all
[1:45:06] the Fashions of the world all these
[1:45:08] things that have hindered me I'm going
[1:45:10] to throw them away and for a while you
[1:45:13] Prevail the problem is then you
[1:45:15] relax when God doesn't want you to just
[1:45:18] have a moment of baptism he wants you to
[1:45:21] have a lifetime of an in fing that a
[1:45:24] spirit will fill you to lead your life
[1:45:27] that you will no longer want those
[1:45:33] things and it's not just for the old
[1:45:38] people it's not just for the old people
[1:45:40] no
[1:45:42] no there's going to be young people that
[1:45:45] stand for this
[1:45:47] message you know if time goes on brother
[1:45:49] Steven there's going to be young men
[1:45:51] that rise up to be deacons to be
[1:45:54] ministers that can encourage the
[1:45:56] bride God doesn't want you to just be a
[1:45:59] log that's rotted on the inside he wants
[1:46:01] to use your life to help somebody to
[1:46:04] help the
[1:46:06] bride and there's going to be mothers
[1:46:09] and
[1:46:10] grandmothers Women of Faith that can be
[1:46:13] written of like in the Bible Timothy It
[1:46:16] Was Written of his grandmother and his
[1:46:18] mother and Paul said the faith that was
[1:46:20] in them I see it in you
[1:46:23] where did he get that Faith from an
[1:46:25] example of a
[1:46:29] mother Satan wants to tell our sisters
[1:46:32] that you're nothing and that you're
[1:46:34] suppressed but God wants to use you for
[1:46:37] far more than a president could want to
[1:46:40] use you for far more than a government
[1:46:43] or a job could use you for to raise Sons
[1:46:47] and Daughters of God
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:47:00] we need to be in love with
[1:47:03] Jesus you know the Bible
[1:47:06] says you shall love the
[1:47:09] Lord with all your heart your strength
[1:47:12] your mind all that you are brother
[1:47:15] brandom spoke about
[1:47:18] Samson he said Samson gave God his
[1:47:22] strength that's right but he didn't give
[1:47:24] God his heart that's right that's right
[1:47:27] he gave his heart to
[1:47:30] Delilah in other words he gave God his
[1:47:34] strength you know he gave God what what
[1:47:38] was powerful and what was maybe brought
[1:47:40] Fame and all these things but when it
[1:47:43] came down to actually giving God his
[1:47:45] heart he didn't give it to God he gave
[1:47:49] it instead to the
[1:47:51] world and what happened was God had put
[1:47:54] a promise over him yes sir that if you
[1:47:57] stay in your place yes sir if you stay
[1:48:01] in your god-given
[1:48:03] place if you keep God's word he said I
[1:48:07] will give you Victory there'll be no
[1:48:09] Giants no man be able to stand before
[1:48:11] you so much so that he would take a jawo
[1:48:15] and slay a whole
[1:48:16] Army one
[1:48:19] man sir sir but was his
[1:48:25] strength slaying a whole Army all that
[1:48:28] was was he gave God his
[1:48:30] strength but the whole time his heart he
[1:48:33] gave it to the
[1:48:37] world and what that did no matter how
[1:48:40] strong he was no matter how much God
[1:48:43] used him for a Time eventually his heart
[1:48:47] being in the world brought him to a
[1:48:50] place where the world stripped him of
[1:48:53] all power it stripped them of every
[1:48:56] promise it stripped them of overcoming
[1:49:01] power he could have sat in a church and
[1:49:04] not been able to overcome as the word
[1:49:06] comes forth because his heart was in the
[1:49:08] world that's
[1:49:09] right right that's right brother Brandon
[1:49:14] says but you've got to surrender soul
[1:49:16] body Spirit strength everything you
[1:49:20] are you've got to surrender your family
[1:49:23] you've got to surrender your church
[1:49:26] you've got to quit trying to save them
[1:49:27] yourself and just let God move however
[1:49:31] God wants to move you got to quit trying
[1:49:34] to beat them into coming and just give
[1:49:36] them to God because they were God's
[1:49:46] first Jesus sent this message to prepare
[1:49:51] a bride and to turn not just her
[1:49:54] strength but her
[1:49:56] heart her heart back to the
[1:50:00] faith and the bride's heart will be
[1:50:02] turned back and there are benefits that
[1:50:05] come with
[1:50:06] this right Psalms 103 says forget not
[1:50:10] all my
[1:50:11] benefits who heals all your diseases and
[1:50:15] forgives all your
[1:50:18] iniquities you know brother Bram I was
[1:50:20] listening to Invisible Union yes sir
[1:50:23] and he says when a child of God takes
[1:50:26] the spirit and the word and receives it
[1:50:28] that is when the wedding band of Grace
[1:50:31] is placed on their
[1:50:33] finger brother brandom said you're not
[1:50:36] just
[1:50:37] forgiven you are
[1:50:40] Justified he says what Justified means
[1:50:44] you can come and say brother I forgive
[1:50:46] you for doing such and such for drinking
[1:50:47] for doing this and I can look at you
[1:50:49] devil and say what are you talking about
[1:50:53] I never did it in the first place
[1:50:55] brother brandham said your first nature
[1:50:57] did it but when that nature died God put
[1:51:01] it in the sea of forgetfulness and he
[1:51:03] slipped the wedding band of unmerited
[1:51:06] Grace on
[1:51:08] you and when that wedding band comes on
[1:51:11] all God's benefits are opened up to
[1:51:14] you every single one healing forgiveness
[1:51:18] of your sins restoration of your life
[1:51:21] opened up to you
[1:51:28] but if healing was all we wanted we'd be
[1:51:31] of all men most miserable if we had hope
[1:51:34] only in this world we'd be
[1:51:40] miserable but a wedding band means
[1:51:42] something more than just healing a
[1:51:46] wedding band means you are promised
[1:51:53] connect you know Paul said to the
[1:51:56] Galatians he
[1:51:59] said that's all right
[1:52:01] brother he said Paul said to the
[1:52:03] Galatians he said you've been so quickly
[1:52:07] moved from the message that I
[1:52:11] brought what did the message do he said
[1:52:15] that espoused
[1:52:18] you the message of the Prophet took a
[1:52:22] bride and espoused her which means it
[1:52:25] promised her it married
[1:52:28] her
[1:52:31] right brother brandom said when you make
[1:52:34] that promise in God's eyes you're
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:41] married be spiritually minded when that
[1:52:45] promise is made to you and that wedding
[1:52:47] band is given to you it might be an
[1:52:49] engagement ring but when that's given to
[1:52:52] you you are promised you are his he
[1:52:56] takes upon you your upon him your burden
[1:53:00] he's responsible for you he's
[1:53:02] responsible for the bride he's
[1:53:04] responsible for your family he's
[1:53:06] responsible for your healing he's
[1:53:08] responsible for your finances he's
[1:53:10] responsible for your home for your bills
[1:53:13] he's responsible for the church
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:22] brother Brandon
[1:53:24] said and I want you to see where we
[1:53:29] are where we
[1:53:33] are because we're in a holding
[1:53:37] period because brother brandom said many
[1:53:40] we're
[1:53:42] Western right we're from the west and he
[1:53:46] says but the Bible's an Eastern book
[1:53:49] right so when we read the Bible he says
[1:53:51] we have to realize realiz they had
[1:53:53] Eastern
[1:53:55] customs and so when you start reading
[1:53:58] about
[1:54:00] marriage in Jewish culture and when this
[1:54:04] was
[1:54:04] written the way it would
[1:54:07] work is that a man would first look for
[1:54:11] a bride he'd find one and he'd pay for
[1:54:18] her and when he paid for her she had the
[1:54:21] option can say yes or no sir right
[1:54:26] Rebecca's mother and her brother said we
[1:54:29] don't know ask her and elra looked at
[1:54:31] her and said will you come now they said
[1:54:34] no no no wait don't go yet stay for a
[1:54:37] little while in denomination stay for a
[1:54:39] little while in the world stay for a
[1:54:41] little while let me convince you Rebecca
[1:54:43] looked at the message and the messenger
[1:54:45] she said I won't stay I will
[1:54:49] go I will follow and what did aler do he
[1:54:54] provided clothing for her he dressed her
[1:54:58] brother bandam said if I can get the
[1:54:59] bride to stand still I will dress
[1:55:04] her for a
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:11] wedding so the price is paid the
[1:55:14] choosing of a bride commences he chose
[1:55:17] you and now you say yes or no yes yes
[1:55:22] yes
[1:55:25] when the elected lady says
[1:55:28] yes I will
[1:55:30] go a wedding
[1:55:33] ring is
[1:55:34] provided payment is
[1:55:38] made but then she doesn't go with him
[1:55:40] right
[1:55:42] away a ceremony is done but he says all
[1:55:46] right now wait I will be back for
[1:55:50] you your promise to me you're mine I've
[1:55:55] paid for you but I'm not taking you yet
[1:55:58] he
[1:55:58] goes in the custom is he goes to prepare
[1:56:03] a
[1:56:04] place he goes to prepare a
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:13] home when she says yes she might not
[1:56:17] have gone with him yet but he is already
[1:56:19] responsible for her she is
[1:56:22] his and now what he's doing is he's
[1:56:25] going to prepare a
[1:56:28] place and then usually about 12 months
[1:56:31] later a year later he comes
[1:56:34] back and that's when he takes her to a
[1:56:38] wedding
[1:56:39] supper that's when he takes her and
[1:56:42] marries her am so you see why when you
[1:56:46] make that promise sir when you say yes
[1:56:49] you are as good as married
[1:56:53] and when Jesus sent this message and we
[1:56:56] the elected lady the elected right
[1:56:58] brother brandom says I call her misss
[1:57:01] Jesus Christ Ms
[1:57:03] Grace he says when when you receive the
[1:57:06] message and accept it and he slips that
[1:57:09] wedding band on you church he might have
[1:57:12] gone to prepare a place for us and we're
[1:57:14] sure of that but he is responsible for
[1:57:17] us right now
[1:57:20] [Applause]
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:25] but there's something expected of the
[1:57:27] lady those 12 months she can't just sit
[1:57:30] there and do
[1:57:32] nothing she has to make
[1:57:34] preparation because he's already
[1:57:36] promised he's already told her what he's
[1:57:39] going to do he's already said I'm coming
[1:57:41] back for you and now she has to make
[1:57:43] ready to go she has to start cutting all
[1:57:46] ties getting ready to leave her father's
[1:57:49] house leave her mother's house leave
[1:57:52] this war behind and be willing to go
[1:57:54] with
[1:57:57] him brother brandham talked about the
[1:58:00] man from
[1:58:02] Chicago that he
[1:58:04] came and there was all this commotion
[1:58:07] here comes a message here comes a
[1:58:09] prophet and all these people came out
[1:58:11] and all the
[1:58:13] cousins came out because they thought
[1:58:15] they were better because they were
[1:58:17] dressed better maybe had a bigger Church
[1:58:20] More Money More anointing you could say
[1:58:23] but here's this little cousin who's
[1:58:27] forgotten but see she had a character in
[1:58:30] her that she was willing to
[1:58:34] serve she was willing to make
[1:58:37] preparation she was a Rebecca that
[1:58:40] watered the prophets and was willing to
[1:58:43] water his
[1:58:47] camels and when this Elijah
[1:58:50] came and he saw all the cousins glory to
[1:58:53] God he said is this all we could
[1:58:56] produce is this all preaching we've
[1:58:59] preached and we've preached and we've
[1:59:01] preached is this all that could be
[1:59:02] produced a witch he said a witch LED
[1:59:06] that American
[1:59:07] Church a witch dancing like the world
[1:59:10] dressed like the world looked like the
[1:59:13] world yet said they were Christians
[1:59:15] brother brandham said you claim to be a
[1:59:17] Christian you'll be judged as a
[1:59:18] Christian
[1:59:22] but this man looked around and that
[1:59:24] wasn't enough that's not what I'm
[1:59:27] looking for in a bride I'm not looking
[1:59:29] for a witch to be my bride I'm not
[1:59:32] looking for one that looks like the
[1:59:34] world that tries to act like the
[1:59:38] world but he noticed
[1:59:40] something there was a little
[1:59:43] cousin a little church in
[1:59:46] Gastonia that they had all written her
[1:59:49] off they had all said this church is
[1:59:51] worth nothing it's a small Church it
[1:59:54] won't
[1:59:55] last but the message came by and saw
[1:59:58] something didn't matter how small it was
[2:00:01] it's all they were Sons and Daughters of
[2:00:07] God he was looking for a bride and he
[2:00:11] found character that was like
[2:00:15] his he found character that fit with him
[2:00:19] that he
[2:00:20] said I am the same yesterday today and
[2:00:24] forever and the bride said
[2:00:27] amen he said dress like a woman dressed
[2:00:31] like a man and the bride said amen he
[2:00:34] found somebody that was willing to serve
[2:00:37] and
[2:00:38] submit and you
[2:00:42] know submitting for a wife to submit is
[2:00:45] not popular today because Satan is
[2:00:48] against the word that's right and Satan
[2:00:51] wants to make our
[2:00:52] sisters think that they are just being
[2:00:56] abused and they don't have rights you
[2:00:58] have rights you have the greatest right
[2:01:02] of all and that's that you've been given
[2:01:05] Grace and whatever right you have as an
[2:01:08] American brother brandom said you give
[2:01:10] up those rights he said a sheep gives up
[2:01:14] their rights because they want to follow
[2:01:17] I was reading a quote brother brandom
[2:01:19] talked about he said he was in the out
[2:01:21] east
[2:01:22] yes and he saw a
[2:01:24] shepherd and he said it astounded him
[2:01:28] because here comes the shepherd and
[2:01:30] there's all these sheep following him in
[2:01:32] a
[2:01:34] line but what astounded him was that he
[2:01:37] was at a Marketplace and the market
[2:01:39] places there aren't like here this isn't
[2:01:41] Publix where no animals allowed there
[2:01:44] was a Street Market Foods on the street
[2:01:47] all these things that would be oh so
[2:01:50] tempting for an animal
[2:01:52] to walk by an open market there's food
[2:01:55] everywhere you could just turn and
[2:01:58] eat but if you turn and eat you lose
[2:02:00] sight of the shepherd and brother
[2:02:01] Brandon said what was incredible about
[2:02:03] the shepherd and these sheep is that he
[2:02:05] walked all those sheep down the middle
[2:02:08] of the market and he said the Sheep
[2:02:10] looked at the shepherd the whole way
[2:02:12] didn't go to the left or to the right
[2:02:15] didn't go after the shiny thing didn't
[2:02:17] go after the big church didn't go after
[2:02:20] the the reasoning and denominational
[2:02:21] ideas didn't go after the world they
[2:02:24] just kept their eyes on the shepherd and
[2:02:26] that these sheep said my sheep hear my
[2:02:29] voice and they won't go after another
[2:02:33] that's why this church is here brother
[2:02:34] because his sheep hear his voice and
[2:02:38] they won't go after
[2:02:44] another the little girl the little
[2:02:47] cousin yes worked and worked uhh and
[2:02:51] worked uhhuh and worked and prepared and
[2:02:53] worked and made money and prepared a
[2:02:54] dress and did all these
[2:02:58] things and they laughed at her the whole
[2:03:01] time he's not really coming back but she
[2:03:05] he told me he
[2:03:06] was he's not coming you know the message
[2:03:09] you believe it's not true but he told me
[2:03:13] in my heart that it was true and that he
[2:03:16] was coming back from
[2:03:19] me and the day came he gave an exact
[2:03:22] date he said on this day I will be there
[2:03:26] and when that day came she didn't wake
[2:03:28] up she was like that sister in Memphis
[2:03:31] she knew he's coming he told me he's
[2:03:34] coming he's coming she got dressed and
[2:03:37] she sat there and she waited and waited
[2:03:40] and waited and they continued laughing
[2:03:42] at her and she
[2:03:44] waited but there's a there's a Mount
[2:03:48] Zion Showdown
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:03:53] brother brandham said there's a Mount
[2:03:56] Caramel Showdown where Elijah spoke the
[2:03:59] word nobody believed it God waited God
[2:04:02] waited God waited but when the time came
[2:04:05] fire came down and it Vindicated
[2:04:07] it Supernatural fire then there was the
[2:04:11] mount Transfiguration Showdown where
[2:04:13] they all said this a this is not the
[2:04:15] word this can't be the word born of
[2:04:17] fornication but when the time came God
[2:04:19] came down and Vindicated
[2:04:22] and brother Bram says there's going to
[2:04:24] be a Mount Zion Showdown where God sent
[2:04:27] a message and we've stood and we've
[2:04:30] believed and we believed and we've
[2:04:32] waited and we've waited and we've gotten
[2:04:34] ready he says but there's going to come
[2:04:36] a time where The Showdown comes and
[2:04:40] brother Brandon said Jesus will be the
[2:04:42] showdown between denomination and the
[2:04:47] word Jesus will come down and vindicate
[2:04:51] it by doing what coming back for his
[2:04:55] bride fear not little flock it is your
[2:04:58] father's good pleasure to give you the
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:05] kingdom and that's where we
[2:05:08] are we're in a holding period we've
[2:05:12] received the wedding band we've received
[2:05:14] it we know he's coming back it might
[2:05:18] take a little time it might have taken
[2:05:20] longer than we thought but he is coming
[2:05:23] why because he told us he was
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:28] coming the thing for us to do in
[2:05:33] closing is fall in love with
[2:05:37] Jesus because if you fall in love with
[2:05:41] Jesus all the things of the
[2:05:44] world will fade
[2:05:46] away if you fall in love with
[2:05:49] Jesus and truly ask ask him for
[2:05:54] revelation God will show you that this
[2:05:58] message and Christ are one let's all
[2:06:04] [Applause]
[2:06:09] stand we are not like that rich couple
[2:06:13] no sir that want to just flirt with the
[2:06:16] world the bride is not like that the
[2:06:19] bride is like that humble couple lived
[2:06:22] in a box car didn't have much and yet
[2:06:25] the the husband wanted to give her
[2:06:27] everything but there was things that he
[2:06:30] couldn't give
[2:06:31] her and she was just okay with it
[2:06:35] because she loved
[2:06:37] him let's bow our heads
[2:06:43] H dear heavenly
[2:06:47] father Lord you are a good God Amen you
[2:06:51] are a faithful
[2:06:53] Savior your word is true father and
[2:06:57] you've sent this message today Lord to
[2:06:59] gather a
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:01] bride and you've given us the wedding
[2:07:03] band of Grace
[2:07:05] father and now what you're asking the
[2:07:07] bride to do is to
[2:07:10] prepare to be in love with you amen and
[2:07:15] if there's anybody here that can look in
[2:07:18] their lives and
[2:07:19] realize I'm not in love how I ought to
[2:07:21] be brother brandham said it's going to
[2:07:23] take a depth of
[2:07:26] sincerity and I can look in my life and
[2:07:28] brother brandham himself would say I
[2:07:30] need to be more sincere and if a prophet
[2:07:34] was humble enough to say I need to be
[2:07:38] more sincere where should we be how
[2:07:41] should we
[2:07:43] think you know it's Grace that has saved
[2:07:45] us it's grace that brought this message
[2:07:48] by our way and it's Grace that put
[2:07:50] something in us to receive and believe
[2:07:52] it not by Merit brother Brandon said
[2:07:54] it's unmerited Grace that if you haven't
[2:07:58] been as sincere as you ought to be it's
[2:08:00] going to require why don't you look to
[2:08:02] God
[2:08:02] now he's here why don't you raise your
[2:08:06] hands to him in a declaration of faith
[2:08:09] and say Lord I haven't been as sincere
[2:08:12] as I ought to be there's things in my
[2:08:14] life that are hindering me from truly
[2:08:16] falling in love with you but I don't
[2:08:19] want to be hindered anymore father I
[2:08:21] want to love you you so loved me that
[2:08:24] you gave yourself for me now let me love
[2:08:27] you so that I'll give my all to you and
[2:08:30] God sees your hand and he sees your
[2:08:33] heart and it doesn't take a long time it
[2:08:36] takes one
[2:08:37] moment fall in love with
[2:08:40] Jesus ask him to put that love in you
[2:08:42] for him maybe you've grown cold on him
[2:08:45] like the Ephesian Church age had they
[2:08:47] were aimed at and then
[2:08:50] relaxed maybe you you've relaxed but
[2:08:52] God's looking for Christians that are
[2:08:54] aimed that have a purpose that know what
[2:08:57] their purpose is and that is to serve
[2:09:00] the
[2:09:01] Lord that if that's your desire talk to
[2:09:04] him and say Lord help
[2:09:07] me dear heavenly
[2:09:10] father Lord you see every
[2:09:12] hand thank you Jesus more than a hand
[2:09:15] father Yes Lord you see the Heart Lord
[2:09:19] and this message Lord that you sent by
[2:09:21] Elijah the prophet brother brandom Lord
[2:09:23] it didn't come to to turn our minds it
[2:09:26] didn't come to make us smart or or
[2:09:29] mysterious what it came to do was to
[2:09:31] turn the hearts of your people our
[2:09:34] hearts in love back to the full pure
[2:09:37] unadulterated word and Lord your your
[2:09:39] children are here in Gastonia father a
[2:09:43] beacon of light Lord in this
[2:09:44] neighborhood there might be people
[2:09:46] living in houses nearby they have no
[2:09:47] clue what's going on here father and
[2:09:50] what it is is the shakina of Glory comes
[2:09:53] down and visits his
[2:09:56] people Lord then may you see each hand
[2:09:58] and each heart that has a desire they've
[2:10:01] recognized Lord I have to be more
[2:10:03] sincere father I raise my hand I want to
[2:10:05] be more sincere father then may you help
[2:10:08] us to be more sincere Lord may you
[2:10:11] Empower us to be more sincere may you
[2:10:13] give us a hunger and a thirst if there
