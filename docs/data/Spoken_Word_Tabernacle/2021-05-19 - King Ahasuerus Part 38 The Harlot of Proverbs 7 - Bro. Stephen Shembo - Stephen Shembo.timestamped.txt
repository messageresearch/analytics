[31:42] amen we thank god for his grace
[31:46] remember on saturday
[31:49] you know where to meet right meeting a
[31:52] brother
[31:53] kelly's home for our house meeting
[31:56] amen yeah so
[31:59] i believe brother david was saying the
[32:01] text for the address i'm not sure if
[32:03] they already send it
[32:04] but if it's not you're going to receive
[32:07] it and
[32:08] please if possible be there on time
[32:14] amen if you come late then we're gonna
[32:17] wait
[32:18] for you to eat and then start with the
[32:21] question and answer and we're losing
[32:23] time and before you know it
[32:24] there won't be any more time left and we
[32:26] will only touch
[32:28] to a certain part so by god's grace make
[32:30] sure
[32:31] you're there on time if possible if
[32:34] you're not working
[32:36] one time brother robert is it three
[32:38] o'clock or
[32:40] four o'clock
[32:45] three o'clock so brother kelly say
[32:48] three o'clock so at three o'clock b day
[32:51] amen if not we're going to start
[32:55] the problem is we don't record those
[32:57] last time somebody probably recorded but
[33:00] we usually don't record those if we do
[33:02] record
[33:03] i keep it because it's people asking
[33:05] questions directly
[33:07] and we want to keep that secure for the
[33:10] church amen
[33:11] yes so you're there make sure you be
[33:14] there on time
[33:15] and we can fellowship and have a good
[33:18] time and keep that in prayer as well
[33:20] so everything goes fine by the grace of
[33:23] god
[33:24] amen if you're not excited about it i'm
[33:27] already excited
[33:30] if you're not i'm already excited about
[33:32] it i was
[33:33] going over the questions and as i was
[33:36] doing that
[33:37] at work today i felt an anointing
[33:40] dropping
[33:41] and i was already happy by just starting
[33:44] to answer one question he opened the
[33:46] door to another scripture he opened the
[33:47] door to another scripture he opened the
[33:49] door to another scripture
[33:50] and i finally even understood why
[33:52] brother branham say enoch had a rapture
[33:54] in faith
[33:56] but random never gave a scripture to the
[33:58] best of my understanding
[33:59] now i can see it in the bible in the
[34:01] scripture why he say
[34:03] enoch head rupturing faith now i see it
[34:06] clearly
[34:07] oh my god it was right there so when
[34:09] brother branham say something i believe
[34:11] you well enough trained in this church
[34:13] remember whether you understand it or
[34:16] not
[34:17] take it believe it and move forward
[34:19] because most

[35:42] amen ah
[35:46] i don't like when i talk to somebody and

[35:50] sermons behind i usually wonder what

[36:01] three i'm wondering and i hope if you
[36:04] four
[36:05] sermons behind you must be
[36:08] maybe ten uh political stuff behind
[36:15] not being on up to date on politics and
[36:18] you're behind in church
[36:20] that doesn't work malachi
[36:24] chapter 2 verse 7.
[36:28] everybody there remember god made us a
[36:31] kingdom of priest
[36:33] we already know that amen we already
[36:35] explained that
[36:37] for the priests lips
[36:40] were kingdom of priests so what should
[36:44] they find
[36:45] on our lips politics
[36:52] for the priests lips should keep water
[36:56] what kind of knowledge
[37:00] for the priest sleeps should keep
[37:02] knowledge
[37:04] and they should seek the law at
[37:07] his mouth so if people want to know
[37:10] want to be comforted they need some word
[37:13] of wisdom
[37:14] or something they need to come to you
[37:17] and you must be ready to have that word
[37:21] in your mouth ready to answer ready to
[37:24] comfort
[37:25] ready to strengthen ready to be spoken
[37:27] amen
[37:29] and the priest's lips should keep
[37:31] knowledge
[37:32] and they should seek the law at his
[37:34] mouth
[37:35] so they're not coming to you to ask you
[37:37] a question about
[37:38] politics or whatever is going into the
[37:41] world
[37:42] if people call you to ask you a question
[37:44] about politics all the time you better
[37:46] wake up
[37:47] amen for the priesthood should keep
[37:50] knowledge
[37:51] and they should seek the law at his
[37:53] mouth
[37:54] for he is the messenger of the lord of
[37:57] water
[37:58] as a messenger the lord give him the
[38:01] word
[38:02] and the word is in your mouth and the
[38:04] people come to you
[38:06] because they need the word of god if
[38:08] they need politics they know where to
[38:10] get them
[38:11] if they want to know what is going on in
[38:12] the neighborhood they know where to get
[38:14] it
[38:14] if they want to know what is going on in
[38:16] every message
[38:18] churches they know where to get it but
[38:20] when somebody approach you
[38:21] they must be approaching you to learn
[38:24] something from god
[38:26] amen let's go to matthew chapter four
[38:29] you might be seated
[38:33] i'm not saying they cannot ask you where
[38:35] you can buy something in walmart
[38:38] but i'm talking about your life your
[38:40] very life
[38:41] should be centered around the word of
[38:43] god
[38:44] amen
[38:47] hallelujah
[38:51] if you dig deep in this message you
[38:53] don't have to chase anybody
[38:55] the people just by themselves drop off
[38:59] they found out that you're a different
[39:00] specie when you talk brother branham say
[39:03] the bible say brother brother i'm saying
[39:04] the bible say
[39:05] after a while either somebody will stay
[39:07] there because the law of the lord or
[39:09] somebody will be like ah he's too much
[39:11] all the time he'll just talk about
[39:12] church stuff
[39:14] so that is an indicator that probably
[39:17] that's not somebody that should be
[39:18] around
[39:19] amen if not you're gonna get influenced
[39:22] matthew chapter four
[39:24] if you're there you can say amen so in
[39:26] malachi
[39:27] the priest's lips should always keep
[39:30] what
[39:31] the word
[39:36] why do you need to keep the word all the
[39:41] matthew time 4 verse 1
[39:44] thank you lord then was jesus led up
[39:49] of the spirit into the wilderness
[39:52] to be tempted of the devil it was the
[39:55] spirit leading him
[39:56] he didn't put himself in temptation
[39:59] and when he had fasted 40 days
[40:02] and 40 night he was afterward
[40:06] hungry we already explained this the
[40:08] last of the flesh
[40:10] and when the tempter came to him he say
[40:14] if you be the son of god command that
[40:17] this stone be made bread because the son
[40:20] of god had that power
[40:21] amen but he answered and say
[40:25] it is water so when the devil attacked
[40:29] the lord
[40:30] amen the word is automatically ready
[40:34] in the lips of god amen
[40:38] jesus didn't have to sit down and begin
[40:40] to reason about it
[40:42] once you attack the word pop-up amen
[40:45] he is fighting back by the word
[40:48] your fight is by the world
[40:52] [Music]
[40:54] and the devil also fights you by the
[40:57] word
[40:58] so it's a fight of a word against word
[41:02] amen just like a snake against a snake
[41:06] moses have a snake and then the magician
[41:09] have a snake
[41:10] but we know one snake will swallow the
[41:13] other one
[41:14] because the law of the spirit of life is
[41:17] greater than the true snake the law of
[41:19] sin and death
[41:21] so you must make sure you have the right
[41:23] snake
[41:27] you say buddy stephen snake yeah he was
[41:29] that snake that they put on the pole
[41:32] by moses amen praise it be the name of
[41:36] the lord
[41:37] it is written men shall not live by
[41:40] water
[41:42] bread alone but by every word so the
[41:44] first one
[41:45] he establishes the word above everything
[41:50] but by every word that proceeded out of
[41:53] the mouth of who
[41:55] but in malachi the word must be coming
[41:58] out of the mouth of fool
[42:05] amen from god to the priest and we are a
[42:08] kingdom of
[42:09] priest five then the devil takes him up
[42:13] in the holy city
[42:15] and set him on the pinnacle of the
[42:17] temple the pride of life
[42:19] and said to him if you be the son of god
[42:23] cast yourself down because they want
[42:25] people to see
[42:26] in the temple for it is written he shall
[42:29] give his angel
[42:30] charges concerning you the devil is
[42:33] using the word
[42:35] and in their hand they shall bear you up
[42:39] lest at any time you dash your foot
[42:42] against the stone
[42:44] seven jesus said to him
[42:47] get thee behind me satan
[42:52] you see what he fight with it is water
[42:56] back again to the world even though the
[42:59] devil
[42:59] if you notice the devil is the one keep
[43:02] updating himself he started
[43:06] by by stone then he figured out the word
[43:10] came back he said ah this is a different
[43:12] caliber
[43:13] i cannot go with the stuff of life let
[43:15] me turn around
[43:16] and get into his religious world amen he
[43:20] upgraded himself
[43:21] but jesus doesn't need any upgrade he's
[43:24] still ready
[43:27] amen it is written again
[43:31] you shall not tempt the lord yo
[43:34] who was that lord deity right here
[43:38] jesus is god verse 8 again the devil
[43:42] take him up into an exceeding high
[43:44] mountain
[43:45] and shows him the lust of the eyes all
[43:49] the kingdom
[43:49] of the world and the glory of them the
[43:52] lust of the eyes and said to him
[43:55] all these things will i give you if you
[43:58] will fall down
[43:59] and worship me then
[44:02] say jesus to him get you from here satan
[44:06] for it is again the word
[44:09] still back again for it is written
[44:12] you shall worship the lord your god and
[44:16] him only shall you preserve
[44:19] shall you serve everybody clear so far
[44:22] verse 11
[44:23] then the devil leaves him and below the
[44:27] angel
[44:27] came and minister unto him
[44:30] the fight was word against word
[44:34] and jesus overcome by the word
[44:38] amen and the priest sleeps child should
[44:41] have
[44:41] the word amen that's the way we overcome
[44:45] and that's the example that was given to
[44:47] every single believer that if you can
[44:50] take god at
[44:51] his word then you can defeat the devil
[44:54] anywhere any place under any
[44:57] circumstances
[44:58] it's the word let's go to hebrew chapter
[45:02] four
[45:04] hallelujah we're still
[45:07] dealing with the window of jezebel
[45:12] we needed that window to establish
[45:15] couple things if we can get it down
[45:18] then you will understand the dressing
[45:21] and the high heel
[45:22] and everything and even the man somebody
[45:25] put a question
[45:26] why we don't talk about the man wearing
[45:28] tight pants
[45:32] a problem it's a homosexual spirit
[45:36] amen it is a homosexual spirit
[45:41] a man should not have tight pants
[45:44] something is wrong when you walk and you
[45:47] have to move your feet like this
[45:48] something is off you better change the
[45:50] paint
[45:51] [Music]
[45:57] what is in the man that will attract
[45:59] someone
[46:02] it's amazing how people lack discernment
[46:06] and they swallow everything
[46:09] amen in the old time
[46:13] there was a difference between a watch
[46:17] i'm going to say it and i'm speaking to
[46:18] this church the watch of
[46:21] a man and a watch of a woman
[46:25] amen the men watch were the bigger one
[46:30] what happened in the world that the
[46:33] women's
[46:34] watch looks like men watching instead of
[46:37] even
[46:38] thinking about it meditating on it guess
[46:42] what the sister just take and get it
[46:45] because it's fashion because everybody
[46:48] is doing it
[46:49] and never understood that fashion is the
[46:51] world of the devil
[46:54] because the scripture says you should
[46:56] not conform to the fashion
[46:58] of the world to the present day fashion
[47:02] why did they change the watch of a woman
[47:05] from being small and being beautiful
[47:09] to a to a watch of a woman that looked
[47:12] like a man
[47:13] and sometimes they put it on the right
[47:15] hand
[47:18] you've seen people doing it you take you
[47:20] pick it up and you do it again
[47:23] it is a spirit of homosexuality
[47:31] you can hate me today you will love me
[47:34] in heaven
[47:35] amen it is a spirit of homosexual
[47:39] a watch of a man it's homo it's lesbian
[47:43] that do that
[47:45] because they want to be like a man but
[47:47] they know by nature they are not men
[47:50] so they make certain things to copy a
[47:53] man
[47:54] that's why you begin to see certain
[47:56] shoes of women looking like men
[47:59] a sister should not dress like that
[48:05] you think you're impressing somebody
[48:08] having shoes that look like a man
[48:10] and all they do they put it on a pink
[48:13] collar
[48:14] but if you look it look exactly like a
[48:17] man
[48:18] and then when they go to the mensahs
[48:20] mensah
[48:21] they take the paint off a man and make
[48:23] them tight
[48:25] why the tight paint is on the women's
[48:27] side of the world
[48:30] why is that confusion because on this
[48:33] side is gay
[48:34] on the other side is lesbian so they
[48:36] take stuff and the cross it away
[48:38] and believe her doing it message
[48:41] believer
[48:42] take pen message sister she was looking
[48:45] like a man
[48:46] watch looking like a man and before you
[48:48] know it you're gonna wear
[48:50] shirts that look like a man and they put
[48:52] it pink they say this is for a woman
[48:54] but when you look you reflect a man
[48:59] why do you need that one shirt when god
[49:02] gives you thousands of shirts
[49:03] that look like a sister
[49:07] hebrew chapter four
[49:11] that was a bonus an appetizer
[49:14] for the word of god is what
[49:18] we found that word should be in the
[49:20] priest's mouth
[49:22] jesus fought by the word and hebrew is
[49:25] talking about the word
[49:27] the word of god is quick in other words
[49:29] it's living
[49:30] it's a love it's not a dead word
[49:34] and it's powerful and sharper
[49:38] than any two-edged sword it is more
[49:41] sharper than your knife in the kitchen
[49:44] piercing even to the dividing
[49:47] asunder of the soul and the spirit
[49:51] and of the joint and the marrow why is
[49:55] he piercing
[49:56] and is the discerner the world have
[49:59] discernment
[50:00] there is a power of discernment in the
[50:03] world
[50:05] amen if you want to have discernment
[50:08] cling to the word
[50:09] and the word will be able to discern
[50:12] what is going on
[50:14] and the discerner of the thoughts of the
[50:17] intent
[50:17] of the water how are you gonna know what
[50:20] is in somebody's heart
[50:22] because the bible says no one knows what
[50:25] is in the mind
[50:26] save the spirit which is in the mind how
[50:29] are you gonna know what somebody else is
[50:31] thinking
[50:32] it takes the word and the word what the
[50:35] word tells you
[50:36] is exactly right even though the outside
[50:39] look different
[50:40] the word of god is always true because
[50:43] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[50:46] word will remain forever if the word
[50:49] tells you that wrong no matter how good
[50:53] they look you better trust the word
[50:55] because the word goes beyond what the
[50:58] human can see
[50:59] it goes and discerns the heart
[51:02] how are you going to discern the harlot
[51:06] amen you need the word to discern you
[51:10] that's why we stick by the word that's
[51:12] why we want to do what the word have
[51:14] said
[51:15] because the word will discern the devil
[51:21] it is a discerner of the thoughts and
[51:24] the intent of the heart
[51:26] neither is there any water
[51:29] any creature that is not manifested
[51:33] in other words that is hidden in his
[51:36] sight in other words there is
[51:38] nothing that the word of god cannot
[51:41] penetrate
[51:43] nothing you can act all you want
[51:47] if the living word if christ
[51:51] come down on the scene he will expose
[51:54] exactly what is going on that's why
[51:57] all along he has not been brother
[52:00] stephen
[52:01] he was not brother stephen and it's not
[52:05] gonna be brother stephen
[52:06] it's always been the word of god
[52:11] amen that's why when the word come you
[52:15] say hey
[52:15] that's exactly me how did that know i
[52:18] never live with you
[52:20] i don't go to your house we've never
[52:22] been together
[52:23] how do i know exactly what happened 20
[52:25] years in your life
[52:27] what happened 30 years in your life what
[52:29] happened five years in your life
[52:31] what happened yesterday in the life it
[52:33] is the living word
[52:35] it is a living being that is going
[52:38] around and telling me
[52:40] talk about this you want to catch this
[52:44] one
[52:46] when you went to the hotel nobody was
[52:48] there
[52:49] how can i come here and preach exactly
[52:51] and say somebody will go to the hotel
[52:53] and do this this
[52:54] is ouch it is not me it is the word
[52:59] amen because nothing there is not
[53:02] any creature that is hidden in his sight
[53:07] but all things are water that's why you
[53:10] don't have to
[53:12] live a life that you're trying
[53:15] to complicate yourself god knows
[53:17] everything you're doing
[53:19] we might not know what you're doing god
[53:21] knows everything
[53:23] better confess it and get it clear and
[53:26] move on
[53:27] because one of this day if you continue
[53:30] on what you're doing
[53:31] he's gonna pick it up and give it to
[53:33] somebody and somebody will wake up
[53:35] either prophesy
[53:37] or come with a dream exactly what you've
[53:39] been doing somewhere
[53:43] but all things are naked and how
[53:48] open to the eyes of who
[53:51] him to the heart to the eyes of him
[53:54] with whom we have to do you're gonna
[53:58] give an account to somebody he already
[54:00] knows everything
[54:02] even what you're doing in your bedroom
[54:04] he knows that's why elisha was able to
[54:07] tell
[54:07] the king of israel what the other king
[54:10] was speaking in the bedroom
[54:11] it was not that elisha was there or have
[54:14] an
[54:14] fbi working over there the greatest fbi
[54:18] that ever been is the holy ghost
[54:20] amen because the holy ghost is a witness
[54:24] and whatever you do so whenever you do
[54:26] something he's there
[54:28] he's just watching you that's why he can
[54:31] report
[54:33] and accuse you because he was there when
[54:35] you were doing it
[54:39] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[54:42] the word in the mouth of the priest the
[54:45] fight of the word
[54:47] against the word staying with the word
[54:49] because the word is the one that defeat
[54:51] the enemy
[54:52] amen now let's pray
[54:56] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[54:58] father for your grace
[55:00] for your love your mercy and for giving

[56:33] we're not putting you on uh
[56:37] in a prison it is just the spirit of the
[56:39] things
[56:40] there are things that need to be given
[56:42] away
[56:44] and god can give you something better
[56:47] amen
[56:48] he told david if you would have asked me
[56:50] i would have given you
[56:52] rather than going and killing somebody
[56:54] else just because you lost after his own
[56:57] wife amen
[56:58] so god have many things that he can give

[57:10] banquet we're on part 38
[57:12] amen we were dealing we are still
[57:16] dealing with jezebel
[57:17] on the natural side i believe everybody
[57:20] can still see this
[57:22] the bible says again that when jehu was
[57:25] come to jezreel
[57:27] jezebel heard everything and she painted
[57:30] her face
[57:31] number one she tied her head you already
[57:33] know what it means
[57:34] and number three we are dealing with
[57:37] jezebel
[57:38] looking at the window amen
[57:41] last sunday we talk about the two
[57:44] aspects
[57:45] of the window we talk about a window
[57:48] normally speaking in every house have a
[57:52] window
[57:53] and we also spoke about the window of
[57:55] jezebel
[57:56] everybody remember that and we explained
[57:59] to you that the window of jezebel
[58:01] is a public exposition
[58:04] in the intent to seduce
[58:08] or to vamp or to to bring attraction
[58:13] into somebody or to cause lust amen
[58:16] and the anointing upon jezebel we all
[58:20] know that the anointing
[58:21] upon jezebel is a demonic anointing
[58:24] and we found out on sunday that that
[58:27] anointing not only does seduce the
[58:30] people
[58:30] or entice the people but it's an
[58:33] anointing that
[58:34] also teaches you because we want to find
[58:37] out
[58:38] where did eve learn what she did
[58:41] and we found that eve learn it from the
[58:43] devil and adam learn it from eve
[58:46] so there's an anointing that can be
[58:49] taught
[58:54] it's an anointing that can be taught or
[58:56] can be transferred
[58:58] from one person to another person
[59:00] everybody clear
[59:02] then we found out that by that window
[59:04] came out to
[59:05] portrait everybody remember that
[59:09] there was a portrait of jezebel
[59:12] and there was another portrait of the
[59:14] shulamat
[59:16] amen the portrait of jezebel
[59:19] was in was enhanced with artificial
[59:23] things
[59:25] whether in the book of the song of
[59:27] solomon
[59:28] everything was natural everybody clear
[59:32] but the bible put an accent upon the
[59:35] eyes
[59:37] of both jezebel and her lord
[59:40] and the eyes of the tournament
[59:44] hallelujah in proverbs 6
[59:48] 25 we read last sunday that
[59:51] last night after her beauty which
[59:54] talking about the face
[59:55] because everything that jehu could see
[59:58] was just a portrait
[1:00:00] on a mirror on a window that's not after
[1:00:03] her beauty
[1:00:04] in that heart neither let her take deal
[1:00:08] with the water
[1:00:09] i lead in ezekiel 23 40
[1:00:13] we found out that when a holla and a
[1:00:15] holy birth sent men to come to them
[1:00:18] the bible says that from whom that deed
[1:00:21] washed themselves
[1:00:22] that self painted their eyes and
[1:00:25] decked their self with water so not only
[1:00:29] did these women learn to paint their
[1:00:32] eyes
[1:00:33] to paint their faces amen
[1:00:37] but they also learn to deck themselves
[1:00:40] with what
[1:00:41] with ornament which paul and peter were
[1:00:44] against it
[1:00:46] but when we got to the book of salomon
[1:00:49] we found out that they should
[1:00:50] not only have one necklace
[1:00:56] amen song of solomon chapter four
[1:00:59] be all that affair my love behold thou
[1:01:03] are
[1:01:03] fair that i have devised we already
[1:01:06] explained that that is the spirit
[1:01:08] the soul of a dove within their locks
[1:01:11] that hair is as a flock of goat that
[1:01:14] appear
[1:01:15] from mangila that has ravaged my heart
[1:01:19] my sister my spouse that i have
[1:01:22] ravished my heart with one off than
[1:01:25] water
[1:01:26] with one chain of that right here she's
[1:01:30] decked with a lot of ornament which
[1:01:33] brother branham said was wrong
[1:01:35] but over here it was only one chain
[1:01:38] which one random say something simple in
[1:01:41] song of solomon chapter six verse five
[1:01:43] the bible says turn away denies from me
[1:01:47] for they have overcome me so
[1:01:50] in the book of the song of solomon what
[1:01:54] overcome
[1:01:55] what overcame solomon was the eyes of a
[1:01:59] dove in other words
[1:02:00] it was the spirit on the tsunami the
[1:02:04] character
[1:02:07] the sweet character of the tsunami
[1:02:11] was what attracted solomon more than the
[1:02:15] physical
[1:02:16] of the woman amen but in jesse belsad
[1:02:21] jezebel worked more on the natural
[1:02:25] and she have to entice her natural
[1:02:28] into an artificial in order to
[1:02:31] vamp or to seduce a man but a normal
[1:02:35] woman should be natural but the spirit
[1:02:38] that you have
[1:02:39] the anointing that you have should be
[1:02:42] the one attracting a man
[1:02:44] because peter says that you should
[1:02:47] control a man
[1:02:48] with a meek and quiet spirit
[1:02:51] everything clear so far blessed be the
[1:02:54] name of the lord
[1:02:55] now when we go back into second king
[1:02:59] verse 9
[1:03:00] we found out that when jezebel heard
[1:03:04] that jew is coming
[1:03:08] let me put this together then we're
[1:03:10] going to put it together number one
[1:03:13] jezebel heard that there is a man coming
[1:03:21] she heard there is a man coming she
[1:03:24] heard there is a party coming
[1:03:27] amen number two she fits herself
[1:03:32] to meet that man
[1:03:36] number two she fix herself
[1:03:39] to meet the man or the next victim
[1:03:44] amen number three she talks she asked a
[1:03:49] question
[1:03:50] she said head zimri had peace
[1:03:55] when she meets you she's going to first
[1:03:57] appear to you
[1:03:59] as a peaceful woman
[1:04:03] like somebody who's bringing you all
[1:04:05] that you wanted in life
[1:04:07] that peace woman that you are looking
[1:04:11] for amen
[1:04:13] number four she places herself
[1:04:17] in a way that she can capture
[1:04:20] the men she strategically
[1:04:26] herself in a spot
[1:04:29] that man can see her clearly
[1:04:32] because the bible says that when jihoo
[1:04:35] enter in the gate she said
[1:04:39] had zimri had peace who slew his master
[1:04:43] in other words she made peace with
[1:04:45] criminals
[1:04:47] and he jihu lift up his face to the
[1:04:51] window
[1:04:52] how did jezebel know that jehu will come
[1:04:56] through that direction
[1:04:58] and she positioned herself in a
[1:05:00] direction
[1:05:01] that is gonna meet exactly the next
[1:05:04] victim
[1:05:05] everybody clear and number four
[1:05:08] number five was once the victim
[1:05:12] identified her corner
[1:05:15] then she's gonna seduce you
[1:05:18] with her eyes and whatever she did to
[1:05:21] her face
[1:05:22] and her beauty amen number one
[1:05:25] she heard that a man was coming number
[1:05:28] two
[1:05:28] when she heard that somebody's coming
[1:05:31] she fixed herself according to the
[1:05:33] occasion
[1:05:35] and then she appears first to be
[1:05:38] peaceful
[1:05:39] but she's not peaceful and she's gonna
[1:05:41] place herself
[1:05:42] in a strategic place that you don't miss
[1:05:45] her
[1:05:46] and number three four and number five
[1:05:49] once
[1:05:50] you approach and you bite debate
[1:05:54] then she begin to work on you anybody
[1:05:57] clear so far
[1:05:59] amen in john chapter 4 verse 3
[1:06:03] whatever the devil does you know it's a
[1:06:05] copy of
[1:06:06] of what jesus does the bible says
[1:06:10] in john chapter 4 verse 3 that when
[1:06:13] jesus
[1:06:14] left judea
[1:06:17] and deported again into galilee
[1:06:21] he was going to galilee he must
[1:06:24] need to go through water
[1:06:27] there was something about the lord jesus
[1:06:30] christ
[1:06:31] that was pressing him to go into samaria
[1:06:36] why was he going into samaria
[1:06:40] why did jezebel approaching the window
[1:06:45] then come here to a city of samaria
[1:06:49] which is called cesar near the parcel of
[1:06:52] grant that jacob gave to his son joseph
[1:06:55] now jacob's where was dead
[1:06:58] jesus therefore being weary tired
[1:07:01] with his journey sat does on the water
[1:07:06] jesus was felt that he must go
[1:07:09] into samaria but even though
[1:07:12] he felt that he needed to go to the city
[1:07:14] of samaria
[1:07:16] he didn't go in any other places of
[1:07:19] samaria
[1:07:20] he went into a strategic place
[1:07:23] he could have went into the gate of the
[1:07:25] city
[1:07:26] he could have went into the marketplace
[1:07:29] he could have went into the king palace
[1:07:32] but he chose to go in the well
[1:07:36] why in the world who was coming in the
[1:07:39] world
[1:07:40] why did jezebel went into the window
[1:07:44] who was coming that must face the window
[1:07:49] everybody cleared so far and it was
[1:07:52] about the sixth hour
[1:07:53] there come a woman of water
[1:07:57] to joe water so somehow jesus
[1:08:00] heard just like jezebel heard
[1:08:04] that jesus was coming jesus
[1:08:08] also heard that the woman
[1:08:11] was coming just like jezebel has to
[1:08:14] position herself
[1:08:16] in a strategic place jesus also
[1:08:20] have to position himself in a strategic
[1:08:23] place
[1:08:23] to meet this next victim
[1:08:28] hallelujah in john 5
[1:08:31] 19 the bible says that jesus answered
[1:08:34] and said unto them
[1:08:36] verily verily i say unto you the son
[1:08:39] can do water nothing of himself but what
[1:08:43] he sees the water
[1:08:45] in other words whatever move jesus does
[1:08:49] he always does a move after he was given
[1:08:53] a vision
[1:08:54] so when jesus said i must go through
[1:08:57] samaria
[1:08:58] he was not just going through samaria
[1:09:01] they sent him
[1:09:02] an uber text they told him there is a
[1:09:05] client somewhere there
[1:09:08] and jesus received the uber tax
[1:09:11] and he went to that address that the
[1:09:13] father gave it to him
[1:09:15] because he must pick up a seed of
[1:09:17] abraham
[1:09:18] and take that seed all the way to
[1:09:20] destination
[1:09:22] ever cleared so far he said i do
[1:09:26] nothing of himself but what he sees the
[1:09:29] father do
[1:09:30] for what things so ever he does
[1:09:33] there also judah son likewise he already
[1:09:37] have a text of uber
[1:09:39] they gave him the address they said
[1:09:41] there is a client
[1:09:42] that you need to pick up he said but
[1:09:45] father
[1:09:45] i'm going all my way to jerusalem he
[1:09:48] said no no no no no no
[1:09:49] there is another address you go to the
[1:09:52] city of samaria
[1:09:53] the address is in sasha when you get
[1:09:56] there
[1:09:56] go by the well and just station there
[1:09:59] and your next client is coming up
[1:10:02] everybody clear so far and jessica when
[1:10:05] she heard that she who was coming
[1:10:07] she also prepared himself and she
[1:10:10] stationed himself
[1:10:11] and she knew somebody was coming
[1:10:14] everybody cleared so far
[1:10:16] in god manifesting his gift to brother
[1:10:18] branham say
[1:10:19] the father sent him up there
[1:10:23] where did brother branham get that you
[1:10:26] know he was on his road
[1:10:28] how many knows he was on his wall to
[1:10:30] jericho
[1:10:31] and jericho is just below jerusalem but
[1:10:34] he never need to go by
[1:10:37] the father sent him up there he got an
[1:10:40] uber message
[1:10:42] he said i do nothing till the father
[1:10:46] shows me saint john 5
[1:10:49] 19 i do nothing until i
[1:10:52] see the father do it first that is what
[1:10:56] he said the message
[1:10:57] is perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:01] and when he approached when the woman
[1:11:04] began to approach
[1:11:06] he was not a surprise to jesus when jew
[1:11:10] approaches jezebel it was not a
[1:11:13] surprise for jezebel amen they have now
[1:11:17] to
[1:11:17] interact together but jezebel
[1:11:20] was relying upon her beauty
[1:11:24] to juice amen
[1:11:28] the portrait of jezebel amplifies the
[1:11:32] beauty
[1:11:33] yes but the portrait of solomon
[1:11:37] amplifies the spirit
[1:11:41] of a woman if it's beauty what about
[1:11:45] christ
[1:11:46] isaiah 53 verse 2 for he shall grab
[1:11:50] before him as a tender plant
[1:11:53] and as a root out of a joy ground he has
[1:11:56] no water
[1:11:59] no water and when he shall see him
[1:12:02] there is no water that you should water
[1:12:06] what attracted the tsunami was not
[1:12:10] beauty
[1:12:11] christ positioned himself but he
[1:12:14] projected the messiahic sign
[1:12:17] he projected the supernatural
[1:12:21] and the supernatural is what catches the
[1:12:24] fish
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:28] hallelujah that's why paul said that the
[1:12:31] gospel
[1:12:32] must be preached with the demonstration
[1:12:36] of the spirit he said i come not with
[1:12:39] word of enticing but with the power
[1:12:43] and the death monstration because that's
[1:12:47] what attracted the tournament
[1:12:50] when the shooter man look he said give
[1:12:52] me water
[1:12:54] if you notice he is the one that started
[1:12:56] to talk
[1:12:57] to his victim it was jezebel that
[1:13:00] started to talk before jehu speak
[1:13:05] give me water and she look number one
[1:13:08] he's not beautiful i already have father
[1:13:12] number two he's a jew and i am a
[1:13:15] samaritan amen god
[1:13:19] shows a skin different than what you
[1:13:22] want to bring you the gospel
[1:13:25] amen but despite the blockage of
[1:13:28] the beauty because there was no beauty
[1:13:30] in christ despite the problem of the
[1:13:33] skin
[1:13:34] the tsunami i mean the woman everywhere
[1:13:37] could go
[1:13:38] beyond the skin beyond the beauty
[1:13:42] and understand things that the pharisees
[1:13:46] the preacher missed
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:53] hallelujah a woman of samaria to joe
[1:13:56] water

[1:14:00] for his disciples were gone away unto
[1:14:03] the city to buy
[1:14:04] meat he was hungry then said the woman
[1:14:07] of samaria unto him

[1:19:31] stage
[1:19:32] proverb 5 verse 2. you there
[1:19:36] that damn regard discretion
[1:19:41] that word is not discretion
[1:19:44] the correct word there is discernment
[1:19:51] amen let's go to verse one so you
[1:19:54] understand
[1:19:55] my son attained my wisdom
[1:19:58] and by your ears to my understanding
[1:20:02] that you marry regard discernment
[1:20:07] why do you need discernment why do you
[1:20:10] need discernment
[1:20:13] brother branham says now
[1:20:16] in discernment of the body of the lord
[1:20:19] now our eternal
[1:20:21] destination is not altogether
[1:20:25] determined by what we see
[1:20:28] or what we do what there's two words
[1:20:31] there
[1:20:32] the first is see and the other one is
[1:20:34] here
[1:20:35] amen this one can bring even faith
[1:20:40] but we sin that the eyes overcome the
[1:20:42] other senses
[1:20:44] amen because that's where the devil
[1:20:46] worked with so you must see
[1:20:48] things you might hear things
[1:20:51] that's not the deal the problem is the
[1:20:54] discernment you have
[1:20:56] about what you hear and what you see
[1:20:59] that's what's going to save you
[1:21:02] but when i'm saying our eternal
[1:21:03] destination
[1:21:05] is not altogether determined by what we
[1:21:07] see
[1:21:08] and what we hear but it's determined on
[1:21:12] what
[1:21:12] discernment we have of
[1:21:15] what we see and what we hear
[1:21:19] everybody here so that's why solomon
[1:21:22] said
[1:21:23] number one you must have discernment
[1:21:27] but the discernment comes by the word of
[1:21:30] god
[1:21:31] the living word verse two
[1:21:34] that you may regard discretion
[1:21:36] discernment
[1:21:38] and that your leap may keep water
[1:21:42] why does your lip need to keep knowledge
[1:21:45] knowledge of what knowledge of the world
[1:21:49] remember the priest in zechariah you
[1:21:52] must have though
[1:21:54] jesus fought by them and solomon
[1:21:58] said my son i want you to be equipped
[1:22:02] and the equipment i want you to have one
[1:22:05] you must have discernment with you and
[1:22:08] number two
[1:22:09] i want the word of god to be on your
[1:22:11] lips
[1:22:13] i want you to be what god told the
[1:22:16] priest
[1:22:17] in malachi 2 7 to be
[1:22:20] why do you need these two elements yet
[1:22:24] the discernment and the word the
[1:22:26] discernment come by the word
[1:22:29] ever clear why first three
[1:22:33] father everybody clear are you watching
[1:22:36] your bible
[1:22:38] for the lips of the strange
[1:22:42] woman drop us honeycomb
[1:22:46] very sweet and her mouth is
[1:22:49] sweeter than water
[1:22:53] it's smoother than water oil
[1:22:57] in other words i want you to have
[1:23:00] discernment
[1:23:03] and i want your word when they say mouth
[1:23:06] it's automatically speaking about heart
[1:23:09] because out of the abundance of the
[1:23:10] heart the mouth
[1:23:12] speaks in other words you must have the
[1:23:15] word of god
[1:23:17] because when you face a strange woman
[1:23:20] when you face a prostitute whether
[1:23:24] a natural prostitute or a spiritual
[1:23:27] church
[1:23:28] that is a prostitute like jezebel
[1:23:31] they fight by the world their mouth
[1:23:35] is smoother than oil their lips
[1:23:39] job honeycomb they uses the power
[1:23:42] of the world so you must be also
[1:23:46] prepared to have the word in your mouth
[1:23:49] that's why when jesus faces the devil
[1:23:52] the devil started by the word and
[1:23:55] jesus was the word made flesh so he
[1:23:58] could respond by the word
[1:24:01] and it was a fight of the word against
[1:24:04] the word
[1:24:05] that's why solomon said keep the word
[1:24:08] why because it will be handy when you
[1:24:11] face
[1:24:12] a wrong woman it will be important when
[1:24:15] you face
[1:24:16] a wrong church you gonna fight them
[1:24:19] with the word because they're gonna
[1:24:22] fight you
[1:24:22] with their word everybody clear so far
[1:24:28] hallelujah let's go first forward
[1:24:31] but her hand is bigger than what
[1:24:36] it's bitter than warm wood
[1:24:40] sharp as a two-water
[1:24:45] the end of this woman is
[1:24:49] bitter bitter
[1:24:52] the beginning is sweet
[1:24:58] you okay are you in hurry
[1:25:01] the beginning a is sweet
[1:25:05] sweet like what like honey
[1:25:10] everybody here but the end be
[1:25:13] is what be there
[1:25:16] be there like water but robert called it
[1:25:20] be there like water
[1:25:23] warm wood and what else
[1:25:27] and shopping like what
[1:25:35] why the mic you got it amen
[1:25:38] when we read the hebrew fold
[1:25:43] when we read evil form the word of god
[1:25:47] is water
[1:25:49] sharper than water
[1:25:53] so this woman has a sword
[1:26:00] everybody clear this woman
[1:26:03] has a sword remember when the antichrist
[1:26:07] spirit
[1:26:08] came out with the white horse rather he
[1:26:11] had a ball
[1:26:13] but he didn't have arrow you remember
[1:26:16] when he changed to the red horse rather
[1:26:19] what did he heard
[1:26:23] he had water do you know that or you
[1:26:26] want me to read it
[1:26:28] you want me read it you already know
[1:26:30] that right
[1:26:32] he had the sword so this woman
[1:26:36] is anointed with the sword of
[1:26:39] the devil that's why the catholic church
[1:26:43] in jezebel in the tartarian church
[1:26:48] that is what jezebel was mentioned that
[1:26:51] is the age when the catholic church
[1:26:54] begin to kill people because
[1:26:57] her she starts sweet on the first seal
[1:27:01] but on the second seal she's getting a
[1:27:04] sword
[1:27:04] she's going to change horses everybody
[1:27:07] clear
[1:27:09] and whatever the devil do is a copy
[1:27:12] because if you go in revelation 10
[1:27:16] when the book was given to john when
[1:27:19] john ate the book he was first
[1:27:21] how well sweet as what
[1:27:24] but when the book got into the bell it
[1:27:26] was water
[1:27:28] it was bitter and then revelation 10 8
[1:27:31] says
[1:27:32] now you must do what they saw
[1:27:39] did i lose anybody number one
[1:27:42] sweet ass honey to be bidder
[1:27:46] and three see sharper like a two-edged
[1:27:49] sword
[1:27:50] john come and pick up the book when he
[1:27:53] pick up the book when he eat it
[1:27:55] sweet as honey when he got to the belly
[1:27:58] be there then john you must what
[1:28:01] professor
[1:28:02] you must use the sword the prophetic
[1:28:05] sword
[1:28:05] and you must fight with it because
[1:28:08] that's the way they
[1:28:09] are not fight that's why brother branham
[1:28:12] said
[1:28:12] we have the devil elsewhere
[1:28:19] hallelujah because the sword will
[1:28:22] discern for you
[1:28:23] anybody clear so far everybody awake
[1:28:27] let's continue hallelujah verse 5
[1:28:31] have feet go down to what you see the
[1:28:35] pet horse now
[1:28:36] you have the first horse right there you
[1:28:39] have the second one with a sword
[1:28:41] look how he's changing horses in the
[1:28:42] book of
[1:28:44] proverbs at the opening of the seventh
[1:28:46] seal
[1:28:47] the bible becoming you
[1:28:51] amen her feet goes down
[1:28:54] to death herself has stepped take hold
[1:28:58] of water
[1:28:59] if you open the fourth seal you will see
[1:29:01] that death and water
[1:29:04] you see that praise god verse six
[1:29:08] last you ponder
[1:29:11] the path of her life
[1:29:14] her ways are water in other words her
[1:29:18] ways
[1:29:19] are unstable are you there
[1:29:23] if she sit quiet you're gonna catch her
[1:29:27] that's why she keeps flipping
[1:29:31] amen she's like a chameleon
[1:29:35] today she's red tomorrow she change
[1:29:37] again
[1:29:38] amen because if she remains solid
[1:29:41] you're gonna catch her that's why the
[1:29:44] antichrist
[1:29:45] was changing horses today
[1:29:48] it's a white horse tomorrow it's a red
[1:29:51] horse
[1:29:52] tomorrow is a black horse another time
[1:29:55] it's a pale horse
[1:29:56] but christ have only one wealth and he
[1:30:00] never changes he's only on a white horse
[1:30:03] it is written it is written it is
[1:30:06] written
[1:30:06] it is written it is written it is the
[1:30:09] anti-class
[1:30:10] changing because her ways are
[1:30:13] movable they can flip
[1:30:16] at the beginning they sweet a white
[1:30:18] horse rather after a while you get her
[1:30:21] to the house
[1:30:22] she got pregnant that's it then she
[1:30:24] pulled the sword
[1:30:26] are you there at the beginning sweet no
[1:30:29] problem
[1:30:30] when she got pregnant she take you to
[1:30:32] the court then paul you're going to pay
[1:30:34] child support
[1:30:35] then there her her color showed up
[1:30:41] there is no sweetness it becomes water
[1:30:45] that keeps there become bitter
[1:30:48] are you there her ways are movable
[1:30:51] unstable that you cannot
[1:30:54] know them you are not trained in this
[1:30:57] area
[1:30:58] don't follow them verse seven
[1:31:01] hear me therefore all you children
[1:31:05] ever clear young people hear me
[1:31:10] and depart not from the word of my water
[1:31:15] he didn't say depart not from the word
[1:31:20] do you see that but depart not
[1:31:24] from the word of my men
[1:31:27] shall not live by but by
[1:31:30] every that proceed is out of mind
[1:31:34] in other words depart not from the
[1:31:36] spoken word
[1:31:39] stay tight with the message
[1:31:43] stay tucked with the spoken word
[1:31:46] depart not my son my children
[1:31:50] the children of god depart not from the
[1:31:53] message
[1:31:54] because that is your protection against
[1:31:57] the
[1:31:58] harlot
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:04] not depart not from my word
[1:32:07] because the word can be the bible but
[1:32:10] the spoken
[1:32:11] word which is the living
[1:32:14] word the spoken word is the original
[1:32:18] seed depart not from the spoken
[1:32:22] word you need that living word
[1:32:27] it is all written in the book of of uh
[1:32:31] proverbs everybody clear
[1:32:34] verse 8 remove you
[1:32:38] he move your way far from water
[1:32:41] in other words be really really
[1:32:45] separated
[1:32:46] stay away from that
[1:32:49] that's why brother branham say it is not
[1:32:52] as much as you can get
[1:32:54] closer to sin but as you can get away
[1:32:58] from sin
[1:32:59] sin is not something you play around
[1:33:01] with him
[1:33:02] before you know it you're gonna find
[1:33:04] yourself in it so you don't get
[1:33:06] closer to sin see in other words my son
[1:33:09] stay away
[1:33:11] have no dealings with this amen
[1:33:15] stay away from her and come
[1:33:18] not near the water after what
[1:33:22] don't even get near the door because as
[1:33:26] you approaching
[1:33:27] near to her door you're already in the
[1:33:31] wrong way
[1:33:33] because her door has a way
[1:33:36] there is a way that goes to her house so
[1:33:39] if you go already at the door that means
[1:33:42] you're already in her path
[1:33:45] amen so stay away from there
[1:33:48] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:33:51] lord now let's go to proverbs 7.
[1:33:55] amen wow it's
[1:33:58] amazing how time flies
[1:34:02] proverbs 7 verse 4 if you dare you can
[1:34:05] say amen
[1:34:06] if we can get this down praise god
[1:34:09] hallelujah say to wisdom
[1:34:12] you are my sister you already know this
[1:34:15] and call understanding your king's woman
[1:34:18] that they may keep you from the water
[1:34:21] we already seen that in fact from the
[1:34:24] strange
[1:34:25] we flatter off with the water that's why
[1:34:28] my son
[1:34:28] keep the word ready because it's a fight
[1:34:31] of word against word
[1:34:33] anybody clear for the at the window we
[1:34:36] seen this on sunday
[1:34:38] of my house i looked through my casement
[1:34:41] and beheld among the simple one i
[1:34:44] discern among the water
[1:34:47] among the youth if a youth sleeping in
[1:34:50] church something is wrong buddy
[1:34:52] i discern among the youth i discern
[1:34:56] among the youth a young man void of
[1:35:00] water
[1:35:02] understanding this young man everybody
[1:35:05] is
[1:35:06] born shaping sin
[1:35:09] shepherd born in sin shaping iniquity
[1:35:12] coming into the world speaking lies amen
[1:35:16] but this young man is void of
[1:35:19] understanding we explain to you that
[1:35:21] he was not connected with christ he was
[1:35:24] just a young man naive
[1:35:27] yet still sinner because he's not born
[1:35:30] again yet
[1:35:32] amen and when you are sinner
[1:35:36] you are not born again if you notice the
[1:35:39] bible didn't say
[1:35:40] a baby the bible didn't say
[1:35:43] a toddler the bible says that this young
[1:35:46] man
[1:35:47] was already a youth he was a young man
[1:35:51] when they say a young man it means that
[1:35:54] this young man is not under the age of
[1:35:57] accountability
[1:35:59] in other words the black dog has been
[1:36:01] releasing his life
[1:36:03] but he has not met christ yet
[1:36:07] make sense because when you're under the
[1:36:09] age of accountability
[1:36:11] we explain it to you then the black dog
[1:36:13] is locked
[1:36:14] that's why you can find a five years old
[1:36:17] you give them a hug they don't feel
[1:36:19] nothing
[1:36:20] you can't hug at six years old they
[1:36:21] don't feel nothing you can have my
[1:36:23] little
[1:36:24] sister there she's not gonna feel
[1:36:25] anything because she's
[1:36:27] because the black dog is completely
[1:36:28] blocked but if
[1:36:30] they turn to be teenager if you touch
[1:36:33] them
[1:36:33] there will be something in your body and
[1:36:35] there will be something in her body but
[1:36:38] i'm saying if nothing happens something
[1:36:39] is wrong with you if you normal
[1:36:41] and you have free you're gonna feel
[1:36:43] something what you're feeling is the
[1:36:45] black dog it's telling you that the
[1:36:47] black dog is awake
[1:36:49] in other words when you touch that black
[1:36:51] dog goes like
[1:36:53] that's what it is and you say oh i felt
[1:36:56] something no it's the black dog that you
[1:36:58] failed
[1:36:58] amen so this young man right here
[1:37:02] is a youth he the black dog has been
[1:37:05] released
[1:37:06] but he's void of understanding you know
[1:37:08] what wisdom and understanding is
[1:37:10] already the bible say in romans 6 here
[1:37:13] i speak after the manner of men because
[1:37:17] of the infirmity of your water
[1:37:19] the black dog for as we have yielded
[1:37:22] your members
[1:37:24] servant to uncleanness and to iniquity
[1:37:28] unto iniquity even so now yield your
[1:37:31] member
[1:37:32] servant to righteousness and to water
[1:37:35] you were working for the black dog
[1:37:38] romans 7 5 for when we were in the water
[1:37:43] the motion of water it's the black dog
[1:37:46] pushing the young people they just can't
[1:37:49] help
[1:37:50] it it's just the black dog remember in
[1:37:52] ezekiel 16
[1:37:54] that's why christ come and say let me
[1:37:56] help you fight this battle
[1:37:58] let me help you cross this other this
[1:38:01] this adolescent edge with you you're
[1:38:03] going to go through fire
[1:38:04] but i'm going to be in the midst of fire
[1:38:06] to take the heat off the fire
[1:38:08] so the fire doesn't burn you for when we
[1:38:12] were in the flesh
[1:38:13] the motion of sin the black dog which
[1:38:16] were by the law because
[1:38:18] they told you don't do it don't do it
[1:38:20] don't do it yet the black dog take
[1:38:22] opportunity by the commandment
[1:38:25] amen did work in our member
[1:38:28] to bring you fruit and to water
[1:38:31] everybody clear so far
[1:38:32] so this young man void of understanding
[1:38:36] he doesn't understand anything he's not
[1:38:38] connected to christ
[1:38:40] and because of that the motion of sex
[1:38:44] begin to work with him and now he's
[1:38:46] driven by the black dog
[1:38:48] this is written between the line now
[1:38:51] let's go back
[1:38:53] passing through the street near her
[1:38:55] water
[1:38:57] what did solomon say in prophet father
[1:39:00] stay away look at this boy he's already
[1:39:04] in the corner of this prostitute how did
[1:39:06] he get there
[1:39:07] the motion of simon how did you get to
[1:39:10] open the computer and find yourself into
[1:39:12] a pornography
[1:39:14] it is the motion of sin it is telling
[1:39:16] you the black dog is working on you
[1:39:19] that's why you find yourself in the
[1:39:21] wrong website
[1:39:23] you didn't go just like that somebody
[1:39:25] pushes you it's a black dog
[1:39:28] amen because he needs something to feed
[1:39:30] on
[1:39:31] and the more and and and the indian
[1:39:33] chiefs say
[1:39:34] they want to feed the most is the one
[1:39:36] that is going to do what
[1:39:37] overcome the black inside black inside
[1:39:41] you just feeding both of them
[1:39:42] everybody clear and passing through the
[1:39:45] street
[1:39:46] near her corner and he went the way to
[1:39:49] her water
[1:39:50] when solomon said don't even get closer
[1:39:53] to her door
[1:39:54] this boy is going there why he's not
[1:39:57] connected to christ
[1:39:58] he doesn't have the wisdom that will
[1:40:01] tell him don't go that route
[1:40:03] now he's driven by passion anybody clear
[1:40:08] in the twilight in the evening
[1:40:11] in the black and the night and the dark
[1:40:14] night it always happened at night
[1:40:17] why did it happen tonight amen
[1:40:21] job chapter 24 verse 15 the eye
[1:40:25] also of the adulterer whether for the
[1:40:28] water
[1:40:29] they want to do stuff when people don't
[1:40:31] see them sneaking
[1:40:33] saying no i shall see me
[1:40:36] and disguises his water that's why you
[1:40:39] go to downtown
[1:40:41] you find the young men in the message
[1:40:42] when they're in downtown
[1:40:44] they're not going to wear a tie they're
[1:40:45] going to change their apparel and put
[1:40:48] i mean a hat like this so if somebody's
[1:40:50] passing there brother robert is over

[1:41:26] his face in the water remember what
[1:41:29] solomon says here everybody in the dark
[1:41:33] they dig through the water they're just
[1:41:36] approaching at night
[1:41:37] to the houses which they have water
[1:41:41] so at the day they know there's a
[1:41:43] beautiful woman there there is a
[1:41:44] beautiful woman there there is a
[1:41:46] beautiful woman there

[1:41:54] themselves in the daytime
[1:41:57] they know not the water there is no
[1:42:00] connection with the light
[1:42:02] there is no connection with the world
[1:42:05] there is no connection with
[1:42:06] a living god for the morning
[1:42:10] is to them even as the shadow of god
[1:42:14] of death if one know them they
[1:42:17] are in terror of the shadow of death
[1:42:21] when it's daylight they don't like it if
[1:42:23] you catches them
[1:42:24] they're like god bless you brother
[1:42:27] you like come come down god bless you
[1:42:30] because you caught him
[1:42:31] he's in the terror of death anybody
[1:42:34] clear so far
[1:42:35] so and behold verse 10 damn made him a
[1:42:39] woman
[1:42:40] with the appearance of water with the
[1:42:43] attire
[1:42:44] the clothing of a harlot
[1:42:47] and a stubble and a subtle
[1:42:51] heart a subtle heart
[1:42:55] brother branham himself and seed says
[1:42:57] this the serpent is that missing person
[1:43:00] between the chimpanzee and the man
[1:43:03] because listen notice this now
[1:43:05] that the serpent was not a reptile he
[1:43:08] was the most saddened
[1:43:10] of all beasts of the field now i went
[1:43:13] and got dictionaries today
[1:43:15] from everywhere to look up this word
[1:43:18] what the word
[1:43:19] saddle mean it means to be water
[1:43:22] to be water the best interpretation of
[1:43:26] the hebrew is maha
[1:43:28] means having a true knowledge of the
[1:43:31] principle of
[1:43:32] water keep this when we're going to see
[1:43:34] how was the woman former
[1:43:37] anybody clear so this woman
[1:43:40] is smart smarter than you
[1:43:43] she is crafty and
[1:43:47] her heart not only it's a wisdom
[1:43:50] and craftiness of the devil but she have
[1:43:53] the true knowledge
[1:43:54] of the principle of life she knows life
[1:43:57] better than you she's more experienced
[1:44:03] bro solomon say i found more
[1:44:06] beaded than what the water
[1:44:10] the woman whose water remember this
[1:44:13] woman the heart is shadow
[1:44:15] whose heart is a snare and neck
[1:44:19] and her hand as water who so do what
[1:44:25] shall escape from but there
[1:44:29] this boy the sinner he's not born yet
[1:44:32] but the sinner shall be taken by water
[1:44:35] that's why the boy is going with that
[1:44:38] restraint
[1:44:39] because he's still a sinner everybody
[1:44:43] but to escape her you must do what
[1:44:47] you must please god how do you please
[1:44:50] god
[1:44:51] first corinthians chapter 10 but with
[1:44:54] many of them god was not well what
[1:44:58] for they were overthrown in they died
[1:45:03] let us therefore feel lest a promise
[1:45:07] being left of us of entering into his
[1:45:10] water
[1:45:11] which is the holy ghost any of you
[1:45:13] should seem to come
[1:45:14] short of it for unto us was the gospel
[1:45:18] preached
[1:45:19] as well as unto them but the word
[1:45:23] preached did not profit them
[1:45:27] not being mixed with what in them the
[1:45:30] water
[1:45:31] that's why we preach certain things here
[1:45:35] and people don't change
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:42] we demonstrated by the bible nails are
[1:45:45] wrong
[1:45:46] we demonstrated by the message nails are
[1:45:49] wrong
[1:45:50] why you don't want to catch your nail
[1:45:53] we demonstrated by the scripture
[1:45:57] and we showed you that painting is wrong
[1:45:59] cutting hair is wrong we demonstrated
[1:46:02] that
[1:46:02] young men should not wear bracelet yet
[1:46:05] they are people that are part of this
[1:46:08] church
[1:46:08] they still do the same thing that we are
[1:46:11] preaching
[1:46:12] we are demonstrating by the scripture by
[1:46:15] the message
[1:46:15] but it looks like it's not helping them
[1:46:18] because
[1:46:19] what they hear is not mixed with
[1:46:22] faith it's an intellectual knowledge
[1:46:28] amen hebrew 11 but
[1:46:31] without water it is what
[1:46:35] impossible to do what if the one who
[1:46:39] avoids
[1:46:40] the prostitute must please god
[1:46:43] it means that that person must have
[1:46:46] water
[1:46:48] and faith is a revelation
[1:46:53] that's why brother branham said the new
[1:46:55] birth is a
[1:46:57] revelation you must
[1:46:59] be born again you must have a
[1:47:03] personal revelation of jesus christ for
[1:47:07] yourself
[1:47:08] that's what's going to give you power to
[1:47:10] overcome the devil
[1:47:16] not intellectual faith intellectual
[1:47:19] faith they give you quote they give you
[1:47:21] god you still have questions
[1:47:22] you still have questions you still have
[1:47:24] questions you still have questions
[1:47:26] they give you the bible you still reason
[1:47:29] you still reason you still reason
[1:47:31] you still reason we are not here to
[1:47:33] please your reasoning
[1:47:35] we are here to preach your heart
[1:47:40] hallelujah we are not teaching you here
[1:47:43] we are not demonstrating things here to
[1:47:46] please your knowledge
[1:47:48] we are devastating the ministry
[1:47:51] of the resurrection because after the
[1:47:54] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:47:56] the bible says our heart did burn
[1:48:00] when he opened the scripture
[1:48:04] we are opening the scripture to touch
[1:48:06] your heart
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:13] the holy ghost is working in the bible
[1:48:16] and the message to impress your heart
[1:48:20] your heart must burn not your head
[1:48:26] if not you want to miss this ministry
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:31] and you're going to look it like it's
[1:48:33] brother stephen you're going to miss
[1:48:35] god
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:43] any reason you can stay at home but you
[1:48:46] can go anywhere
[1:48:47] and we keep preaching we keep preaching
[1:48:49] and people don't want to listen
[1:48:55] they're sick they will go to work sick
[1:48:57] they're sick they don't want to come to
[1:48:58] church sick
[1:49:02] they even forget that we can pray for
[1:49:04] you here
[1:49:05] and you can get here that faith is no
[1:49:07] longer there
[1:49:09] you feel more coronavirus than even the
[1:49:12] power of god
[1:49:17] sit at home on the couch and put it in
[1:49:19] if there is a legitimate reason
[1:49:21] you work understand my brother i
[1:49:23] understand that
[1:49:25] but i'm talking about that that small
[1:49:27] group that's still lingering
[1:49:29] that's the holy spirit keep hammering
[1:49:33] hallelujah so but without faith
[1:49:37] it is impossible to please god for he
[1:49:40] that cometh to god must believe that he
[1:49:42] is
[1:49:43] and that is the rewarder of them that do
[1:49:46] what
[1:49:47] diligently seek him to escape this woman
[1:49:50] you must please god anybody clear so far
[1:49:57] i only have 10 minutes left let me run
[1:50:01] before somebody lose a wing
[1:50:06] number 11 she is
[1:50:10] what i keep number 10 i will come back
[1:50:13] to the attire of harlot
[1:50:15] as we're going to demonstrate how the
[1:50:17] woman was created
[1:50:19] in eden amen because you will understand
[1:50:22] if i if if i go
[1:50:24] through the high here without you
[1:50:25] getting that you're going to miss
[1:50:26] something
[1:50:29] and behold verse 10 they made him a
[1:50:31] woman
[1:50:32] with the attire of water and the subtle
[1:50:35] water
[1:50:36] if you notice here keep it for future
[1:50:38] reference
[1:50:40] the heart of this woman is expressed
[1:50:43] on the outside by her attire
[1:50:49] keep that in mind the woman have a bad
[1:50:53] attire
[1:50:54] and her heart also is what bad in other
[1:50:57] words
[1:50:58] her heart is demonstrated by her
[1:51:01] clothing
[1:51:03] remember that because i'm gonna go
[1:51:04] through clothing in detail
[1:51:07] okay clothing for young men clothing for
[1:51:10] the women
[1:51:12] okay verse 11 she's
[1:51:16] loud and what
[1:51:20] she is not quiet
[1:51:24] [Laughter]
[1:51:29] oh my god
[1:51:32] you didn't choose the wrong church you
[1:51:35] choose the right one
[1:51:37] to change you she is quiet
[1:51:41] she is loud and white
[1:51:44] that stubbornness is not submission
[1:51:47] is not submissive
[1:51:51] amen the woman is a harlot
[1:51:56] bad heart and her behavior she is
[1:52:00] loud she's not quiet i'm sorry
[1:52:04] she's loud and she is stubborn
[1:52:10] let's deal with florida and stubborn
[1:52:13] anybody clear clear
[1:52:16] the bible says here knowing not
[1:52:20] that your body are the members of a
[1:52:22] craft cross
[1:52:23] shall i then take the member of christ
[1:52:26] and make them the member of huato
[1:52:29] we are talking about the hollow what
[1:52:32] knowing not that
[1:52:33] he which joined to a harlot
[1:52:36] is what either you're going to be joined
[1:52:39] with christ
[1:52:42] by the or you want to be joined by a
[1:52:45] harlot
[1:52:47] for do say he shall be what
[1:52:51] evil either you're going to be one flesh
[1:52:53] with christ or one flesh with the harlot
[1:52:57] but he that is john unto the lord is
[1:53:00] one spirit that's why the one who's
[1:53:02] joined
[1:53:03] with the lord by the new birth you will
[1:53:06] escape the harlot
[1:53:07] because you already won with christ amen
[1:53:11] flee
[1:53:11] fornication everything that a man does
[1:53:15] is without the body but he that
[1:53:17] committed fornication
[1:53:19] significance his own body in other words
[1:53:22] you are also
[1:53:23] uh polluting your own body everybody
[1:53:25] clear
[1:53:27] the bible say likewise peter your wife
[1:53:30] being water penis is recommending the
[1:53:34] women to be submissive
[1:53:36] but the woman in proverbs 7 is stubborn
[1:53:40] opposite of peter be seen subjection to
[1:53:44] your own husband
[1:53:46] that if any obey not we already
[1:53:48] explained this
[1:53:49] they also without the work we are
[1:53:52] without the word
[1:53:53] be born be warned by the conversation of
[1:53:56] the wife
[1:53:57] why they behold your chest conversation
[1:54:00] your life
[1:54:01] couple with fear whose adorning
[1:54:04] let it not be the outward adorning
[1:54:08] of the plating of water when we explain
[1:54:11] you the planting of hair
[1:54:13] in that time was the attire
[1:54:16] of harlot you understand now
[1:54:19] in other words peter is telling you do
[1:54:22] not
[1:54:22] dress yourself like a prostitute of your
[1:54:25] time
[1:54:26] because the planning of her hair was
[1:54:30] the harlot of the time of peter
[1:54:33] but today we are not in the time of pity
[1:54:36] but the word stays true the message
[1:54:40] there is
[1:54:40] don't worry closing that looks like a
[1:54:43] woman
[1:54:44] on the street in your time
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:48] are you there and wearing of gold and
[1:54:52] putting on off
[1:54:53] apparel we explained this but
[1:54:56] let it be the hidden man of the water
[1:54:59] that's what we're impressing in that
[1:55:01] which is not corruptable
[1:55:04] even the ornament of a water and a water
[1:55:09] a meek and white this woman is water
[1:55:17] make sense the portrait of the shooting
[1:55:20] might
[1:55:20] is a dove it's a meek and quiet spirit
[1:55:25] but this one is a wolf you hear her at
[1:55:28] night whoo
[1:55:30] you know that it's a wolf amen it's a
[1:55:33] make an acquired spirit
[1:55:36] which is in the sight of god of a great
[1:55:38] water
[1:55:39] that's what god is looking at not a loud
[1:55:42] and a stubborn spirit
[1:55:44] but the meek and the submissive spirit
[1:55:48] everybody clear revelation chapter two
[1:55:51] we see this on sunday
[1:55:53] notwithstanding i have a few things
[1:55:55] against thee
[1:55:56] because that suffers that woman jezebel
[1:55:59] which called herself a what
[1:56:01] she is a prophetess
[1:56:07] if a pro a prophetess to do what
[1:56:12] she is not quiet she's speaking she
[1:56:15] teaches
[1:56:17] makes sense which cheese which teaches
[1:56:22] to and to seduce my servant to commit
[1:56:25] fornication
[1:56:26] and to eat things sacrifice unto others
[1:56:29] this jezebel woman is a teacher
[1:56:35] this woman in proverbs is loud
[1:56:39] she speaks she's not quiet
[1:56:43] but paul says the woman must be what
[1:56:48] silence but she is
[1:56:54] let the woman learn in what the prophet
[1:56:58] woman is welcome
[1:57:02] let the woman learn in silence without
[1:57:05] water
[1:57:06] she is loud and welcome opposite
[1:57:11] better suffer not a woman to do what
[1:57:15] what does jesus do
[1:57:19] is the word clear no to observe
[1:57:23] authority over there but to be in water
[1:57:28] she is louder
[1:57:31] she want to preach the gospel that's
[1:57:34] what you have in denominational world
[1:57:37] let your women keep water
[1:57:40] in water for it is not permitted
[1:57:44] upon them to do what this one is loud
[1:57:49] she wanna preach and when she preached
[1:57:53] she take the attitude like amen
[1:57:55] let her stand there jezebel
[1:57:58] but they are commanded to be underwater
[1:58:03] she's stubborn us
[1:58:06] also say the word if you were against
[1:58:09] paul you must be against
[1:58:10] moses because he was already speaking in
[1:58:13] the law
[1:58:15] for if they will learn anything let them
[1:58:18] ask their husband at home for it is a
[1:58:20] shame
[1:58:21] for women to do whatever she is water
[1:58:25] loud in church you want to preach you
[1:58:26] want to teach
[1:58:28] what came the word of god at from you
[1:58:31] oh came it unto you only the word come
[1:58:34] to the prophet
[1:58:35] if any man fake himself to be a water
[1:58:38] not a prophetess or spiritual
[1:58:42] let him acknowledge not let him let him
[1:58:46] acknowledge that the things that are
[1:58:48] right unto you
[1:58:49] are the commandment of what that's why
[1:58:52] paul say a woman should not preach
[1:58:54] but jezebel promote women preachers
[1:58:58] anybody clear so far let's go down she
[1:59:02] is
[1:59:02] loud and stubborn her feet a bad knot in
[1:59:06] her water
[1:59:07] tattoos two verse four that they may
[1:59:10] teach the young women
[1:59:12] to be sober to love their husband to
[1:59:15] love
[1:59:16] their children to be discreet chase and
[1:59:18] what
[1:59:20] does she stay a humble opposite
[1:59:25] everybody clear verse 12
[1:59:28] now she is without now in the street
[1:59:32] and lies in the water lies in water
[1:59:36] remember jesus lies in weight for the
[1:59:39] for the woman anyway
[1:59:40] you remember jezebel did what lies
[1:59:44] in wait for the next victim anybody
[1:59:46] clear
[1:59:47] she lies he wed in weight at every
[1:59:50] corner
[1:59:51] verse 13. so she caught him
[1:59:55] she's the one engaging
[1:59:58] who caught joseph the wife of potiphar
[2:00:03] you see so she called him
[2:00:06] and did what and kiss him with
[2:00:10] an important face
[2:00:13] a face that have no shame she's bold
[2:00:17] you're going to see that in isaiah 3
[2:00:19] when we get to the high heels
[2:00:22] look at peter in like money also
[2:00:25] that women have done themselves in
[2:00:28] modest water
[2:00:30] with water
[2:00:34] this one her face is well impudent
[2:00:38] this one shame fitness everybody clear
[2:00:42] not with breaded hair we already seen
[2:00:43] that but with
[2:00:45] which becometh women professing
[2:00:47] goldiness with good work
[2:00:49] jeremiah 3 3 therefore the shower has
[2:00:52] been withholding and there has been
[2:00:54] another rain
[2:00:56] and that has a water
[2:00:59] a prostituted forehead in other words a
[2:01:01] prostituted face
[2:01:03] how is a prostituted face you have a
[2:01:06] whole forehead
[2:01:08] that refuses to be what prostitute
[2:01:12] another shame
[2:01:13] that's why you see them working the way
[2:01:15] they walk and they dress wrong
[2:01:17] because that anointing take the shame of
[2:01:19] a woman away
[2:01:22] everybody clear she kissed him
[2:01:26] and with an important face she said to
[2:01:28] him verse 14
[2:01:30] i have water
[2:01:34] when jezebel met jiho what did she heard
[2:01:43] makes sense now position herself just
[2:01:46] like this woman
[2:01:47] and then peace that's the beginning
[2:01:51] i have peace offering with me this day
[2:01:54] have i paid my water so when you talk to
[2:01:58] these women
[2:01:59] they understand that you're a christian
[2:02:01] boy they will begin to ask you
[2:02:04] questions about the bible they will
[2:02:06] begin to talk to you about religious
[2:02:08] things
[2:02:09] oh yeah i go to church too i love the
[2:02:11] bible
[2:02:12] i love the scripture too they have peace
[2:02:14] offering
[2:02:17] you see you you meet a young man no no
[2:02:20] no no he's a good young man
[2:02:22] yeah he's not in the message but he's
[2:02:23] good when i talk to him he always talk
[2:02:25] about the bible
[2:02:26] the stuff he's talking about the bible
[2:02:28] because he already learned you
[2:02:31] he already understood you and he knows
[2:02:33] to get you
[2:02:34] he must start with a peace offering
[2:02:37] that's
[2:02:37] him we have peace i'm going with a peace

[2:08:01] this is my own opinion
[2:08:04] are you there for the husband is not a
[2:08:07] home
[2:08:07] he's gone a long journey
[2:08:10] verse 20. he has taken a water
[2:08:14] a bag of money with him and will come
[2:08:17] home at the water there is a day that
[2:08:21] jesus will return
[2:08:24] there is an appointed day for the
[2:08:26] rapture
[2:08:27] i know about the rapture i am a
[2:08:30] christian
[2:08:30] too but we can do this
[2:08:35] are you there the husband is gone
[2:08:39] jesus don't mind if we do something like
[2:08:41] this it won't hurt you
[2:08:43] amen she wanted this she want to
[2:08:46] polluted you
[2:08:47] against the second coming
[2:08:51] she is against the second coming and
[2:08:54] in her house there was a bag of money
[2:08:58] brother robert
[2:08:59] but the husband when he left his home
[2:09:02] when a cabal was written into her door
[2:09:06] when the glory of the lord departed from
[2:09:09] that church
[2:09:11] the husband took the bag of money
[2:09:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:20] brother branham i can be just as happy
[2:09:24] with 25 cents in my hand
[2:09:27] as i could with a loaf of bread in my
[2:09:29] hand
[2:09:30] brother branham said if somebody's
[2:09:32] hungry they're hungry
[2:09:34] and they say i'm hungry i'm hungry if
[2:09:37] you come
[2:09:38] you say what do you want to eat and
[2:09:39] hamburger how much is this five dollars
[2:09:41] if you gave them five dollars they got
[2:09:44] the substance
[2:09:45] and they are already happy and with five
[2:09:49] dollars just like they got a humble girl
[2:09:51] all they have to do is they just need to
[2:09:53] walk to the store
[2:09:55] that's how something is
[2:09:58] why i got the purchase power
[2:10:01] of the loaf of bread the money is the
[2:10:04] purchase
[2:10:05] power of what you need
[2:10:09] the only thing i have to do is walk over
[2:10:12] there
[2:10:12] at the store and get me a loaf of bread
[2:10:15] but now right now
[2:10:17] i got the purchase power of the loaf of
[2:10:19] bread
[2:10:20] he buys the loaf of bread that is what
[2:10:24] so fair fees the money so when the
[2:10:27] husband left
[2:10:28] home he removed faith from that church
[2:10:31] you cannot be born in that denomination
[2:10:40] can you please give me a few minutes
[2:10:43] hallelujah
[2:10:44] faith never look and say i don't feel
[2:10:47] any better
[2:10:48] i don't see any better i don't hear any
[2:10:50] better he rejoices because you already
[2:10:52] got
[2:10:53] the purchasing power of your healing you
[2:10:55] are just as happy
[2:10:57] just as well as anything that you
[2:10:59] already got
[2:11:00] because you got the purchase price or
[2:11:03] fed which is what
[2:11:05] so when the husband left home he removed
[2:11:08] faith
[2:11:09] because the woman is a prostitute and
[2:11:12] the woman is telling you
[2:11:13] in this house we don't have faith we
[2:11:16] don't believe those kind of stuff that
[2:11:17] you believe
[2:11:20] because the husband will come at the
[2:11:22] appointed
[2:11:23] time amen locating
[2:11:26] he shall come he shall not give and
[2:11:29] shall not god avenge his own word
[2:11:32] which cry day and night unto him do he
[2:11:35] bear
[2:11:36] wrong with them i tell you that he will
[2:11:38] avenge them speedily
[2:11:40] nevertheless when the son of man comes
[2:11:42] shall he find what
[2:11:43] the coming of the lord he needs money
[2:11:47] but money was removed from that woman
[2:11:51] but she knows that the husband will come
[2:11:54] at an appointed time
[2:11:55] but there is no faith
[2:12:00] now that is the question here is where i
[2:12:03] want to get you
[2:12:04] in revelation 10 we shall get into it a
[2:12:07] few minutes
[2:12:08] to another scripture verse in the days
[2:12:10] of the message of the seven angel
[2:12:13] the mystery of god ought to be finished
[2:12:15] here is the question
[2:12:16] if you follow in that line in this hour
[2:12:20] will it will it be finished will i found
[2:12:23] water
[2:12:24] will malachi 4 be water
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:28] the faith was removed from the home
[2:12:31] because there is a larger coming to
[2:12:34] restore
[2:12:35] water faith but the young man took a
[2:12:38] wrong road
[2:12:40] where there is no faith
[2:12:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:48] i can't get to this it's still unfolding
[2:12:51] verse 21 with ma with her much first
[2:12:54] pitch
[2:12:55] she calls him to do what the word
[2:12:58] fight by the world he can't fight back
[2:13:01] because he doesn't
[2:13:02] have the word that's why they are
[2:13:04] overcoming him
[2:13:06] with flattering of her lips she did what
[2:13:09] because the young man cannot fight back
[2:13:12] he goes after her
[2:13:13] immediately as the knox goes to the
[2:13:16] slaughter
[2:13:16] or as a fool to the correction of stock
[2:13:19] tiller water
[2:13:21] struck to his liver and as a bird
[2:13:24] hastened to the snare
[2:13:25] and no not that it's for his life
[2:13:28] hearken to me therefore all you children
[2:13:30] and i tend to the word you children and
[2:13:33] i tend to the word of my mouth
[2:13:35] to the spoken word let not your heart
[2:13:38] decline to her way
[2:13:40] go not astray in her path for she cast
[2:13:43] down many water
[2:13:44] that's why she's drunk with the blood of
[2:13:47] the martyr
[2:13:48] yeah many strong men have been slayed
[2:13:50] for her
[2:13:51] her house is the way to water going down
[2:13:55] into the chambers of water
[2:13:59] to the liberty from the strange woman
[2:14:01] even from the stranger which flattered
[2:14:03] with her word
[2:14:04] which forsaken the god of her water
[2:14:09] jeremiah 3 therefore the shower has been
[2:14:13] withholded
[2:14:14] and there has no ladder rain and that
[2:14:17] has a whole forehead
[2:14:19] that refuses to be ashamed will that not
[2:14:22] from this time cry unto me
[2:14:25] my father da art the guide of what
[2:14:28] she forsaken the god of her youth she
[2:14:31] had forsaken her father
[2:14:34] she has disrespected the head
[2:14:37] are you there the young men disrespected
[2:14:40] the head
[2:14:41] how glorious will that little branch
[2:14:44] that escape
[2:14:44] all these things it shall be holy unto
[2:14:47] the lord
[2:14:48] in that day when the real genuine
[2:14:50] born-again women
[2:14:52] know their place though they be laughed
[2:14:54] at and call silly and old-fashioned
[2:14:56] everything
[2:14:57] but act like a woman like a lady
[2:15:00] stand like a lady dress like a lady talk
[2:15:03] like a lady and live like her
[2:15:06] let's tender
[2:15:14] [Applause]
[2:15:20] appreciate you allowing time to get to
[2:15:22] proverbs seven
[2:15:24] two women to portray
[2:15:27] the emphasize is on the spirit the
[2:15:30] answer facades
[2:15:31] is on the natural she's a prophetess i
[2:15:34] gave you all the detail of
[2:15:36] a prostitute completely and how she's
[2:15:38] approaching and how she attacked
[2:15:40] now lord willing when we get to genesis
[2:15:43] we're going to see what is going on
[2:15:45] when the woman was formed because
[2:15:46] brother branham said she was designer
[2:15:49] what our design means to a woman let's
[2:15:51] pray
[2:15:52] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[2:15:55] for your grace your love your mercy
[2:15:57] father and for speaking to us tonight
[2:16:00] lord i'm sorry i went to lu to be just
[2:16:04] a little bit above but i wanted to reach
[2:16:06] a point
[2:16:07] rather than stopping in the middle and
[2:16:09] coming back to this
[2:16:10] where we can load further progress with
[2:16:12] the church
[2:16:13] and i know the speed was a little bit
[2:16:16] too quick
[2:16:17] but father you the holy spirit that can
[2:16:19] help them even when they are home
[2:16:21] they can review this sermon and catch
[2:16:24] what we didn't have even time to explain
[2:16:26] more
[2:16:27] but you are the inside teacher that can
[2:16:29] give them above all
[2:16:31] that we can even think and ask lord
[2:16:33] father may you help this church
[2:16:36] like we stated there are many things
[2:16:38] that you are opening
[2:16:39] and you are opening the scripture to
[2:16:41] change our heart
[2:16:43] because the core the beginning of
[2:16:45] everything started from the heart
[2:16:47] once the heart has been turned and
[2:16:49] converted onto you alone
[2:16:51] father then everything else being begin
[2:16:53] to cease
[2:16:54] and father the worshiper once purged
[2:16:57] there is no more desire for sin
[2:16:59] lord may you help those that are still
[2:17:02] lingering
[2:17:02] under the stubborn spirit and they don't
[2:17:05] want to hear
[2:17:06] they're still reasoning they're still
[2:17:08] pushing their reason
[2:17:10] above the word of god father knowing
[2:17:12] deep in their heart
[2:17:14] that what we're preaching is right and
[2:17:16] what they're doing
[2:17:17] is wrong lord father that spirit of
[2:17:19] stubbornness
[2:17:21] has been blocking many people from
[2:17:23] getting their blessings low
[2:17:25] many women have been found under that
[2:17:28] spirit lord
[2:17:29] though they cannot express that
[2:17:30] outwardly but behind
[2:17:32] doors with their husband they're still
[2:17:34] battling this spirit lord
[2:17:36] and father it's blocking even the moving
[2:17:38] of the holy spirit
[2:17:40] because they're trying to control and
[2:17:42] hold on to their own ways
[2:17:44] and do not want to surrender but you the
[2:17:46] god of simpson lord
[2:17:48] you're the god that can tear a lion like
[2:17:50] a kid's lord
[2:17:51] father may you be merciful and by your
[2:17:54] grace may the hand of love
[2:17:56] father tear every shell that the
[2:17:59] unbelief spirit
[2:18:00] have worked around every complexes that
[2:18:03] have been lord father handed down
[2:18:05] from the families and from the society
[2:18:08] that we grew up lord father that keep
[2:18:10] reasoning and fighting against the world
[2:18:13] father they are claiming their own right
[2:18:15] because laodicea your prophet told us
[2:18:18] that it's people's right lord but as a
[2:18:20] lamb may we understand
[2:18:22] that we need to surrender those right
[2:18:24] lord to the awesome lamb of god
[2:18:27] that came and died for us lord father
[2:18:29] may you touch
[2:18:30] each one lord minister and remember the
[2:18:32] need lord
