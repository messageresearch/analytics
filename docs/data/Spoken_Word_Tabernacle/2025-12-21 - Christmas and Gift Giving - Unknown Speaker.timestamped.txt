[0:14] I thought we finished with this subject
[0:17] but I thought but I believe we had to I
[0:20] have to administer a few dosage of
[0:22] chemotherapy.
[0:24] [laughter]
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ah, shake somebody's hand. Say,
[0:30] just get ready.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [laughter]
[0:37] &gt;&gt; I had a question about the gift
[0:43] during Christmas season.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Because some of the churches, they say
[0:51] we don't celebrate Christmas. [laughter]
[0:54] I'm sorry, my friend. Are you the one
[0:57] asking me the question?
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you turn your timer off?
[1:02] &gt;&gt; It's a lollipop. Somebody's still
[1:06] [laughter] Amen.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, they asked me a question about
[1:11] the gift because some of the churches
[1:13] they say they don't celebrate Christmas,
[1:15] but they get some gathering and exchange
[1:18] gift. But not for Christmas. But in
[1:21] Christmas time,
[1:25] &gt;&gt; brother, you ain't fooling no one.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; If you want to remember the birth of
[1:33] Jesus Christ, Jesus was born in April.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Wait in April.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; And in April, begin to tell us, oh, you
[1:42] know, THE LORD JESUS was born in April.
[1:44] That will be fun.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; We will talk about it, but don't wait
[1:48] for December.
[1:49] So let me uh administer a few uh dosage
[1:55] of uh chemotherapy to make sure some of
[1:59] the lingering uh cancerous cells
[2:03] &gt;&gt; are taken care of.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Ready or not, here it
[2:10] comes. [laughter]
[2:14] &gt;&gt; H in the message. Sir, we would see
[2:17] Jesus Brother Brandham say the word
[2:21] Christmas mass come from Catholics
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Catholicism.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF CHRIST.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; WHAT CATHOL what what Catholic priests
[2:32] are doing
[2:33] &gt;&gt; they call that a mass
[2:35] &gt;&gt; and brother BRANDHAM SAID THE HIGHEST
[2:37] FORM [screaming]
[2:39] &gt;&gt; OF spiritism
[2:41] &gt;&gt; is the Catholic churches.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin. Can you say amen?
[2:47] Amen.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Brandham say the highest
[2:50] form.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; The highest form. IN OTHER WORDS, THE
[2:53] TOP
[2:54] &gt;&gt; TOP.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; THE lights here are not on. Brother
[2:57] Robert.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The top
[3:01] &gt;&gt; the top level, the number one level of
[3:04] spiritism. Brother Brandham say to the
[3:06] Catholic Church
[3:08] &gt;&gt; and the word Christmas
[3:10] &gt;&gt; that you love to say MERRY CHRISTMAS
[3:13] THAT vocabulary
[3:16] &gt;&gt; came from the Catholic church
[3:22] &gt;&gt; don't say amen. [applause and cheering]
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Christ
[3:26] which is what
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Christmas
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Christmas it is a Catholic tradition.
[3:33] Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Why do we want to hang God on something
[3:37] that came from the Catholic Church,
[3:39] &gt;&gt; which is Jezebel today,
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't worry, my
[3:48] friend. Now, Christmas,
[3:51] &gt;&gt; I wish that really the people would
[3:54] could understand in this world what
[3:58] really Christmas is.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[4:01] &gt;&gt; I know your quote. Merry Christmas.
[4:03] Merry Christmas. But I'm saying Merry
[4:05] Christmas. I'm giving you a different
[4:07] layer, a different quote where this they
[4:10] don't touch them.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; They don't read this quote to the
[4:13] church.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; They only they only use those quote that
[4:17] brother Brandham say I wish everybody
[4:19] merry Christmas. That's the quote you
[4:21] will hear for 40 years. This you won't
[4:24] hear them.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; But in this church, we eat everything.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:33] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO QUOTE THAT SHOULD EMBARRASS
[4:35] YOU.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Even where brother Brandham lied, we
[4:39] read it.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; AND WE ALSO READ WHERE HE REPENTED.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT HIDE THAT BECAUSE THE BIBLE
[4:46] NEVER HE HIDE THE MISTAKE OF ABRAHAM.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SPOKE WHERE DAVID MESSED UP.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE READ EVERYTHING.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[5:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW THE FIRST word Christmas
[5:08] is A KIND OF A CATHOLIC EXPRESSION,
[5:11] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[5:12] &gt;&gt; It means Christmas.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Christmas. Christmas.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; It was ordained
[5:20] or was BEGIN WITH THE ROMAN CHURCH."
[5:24] AMEN.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; I thought somebody I say Muslim deal
[5:29] with this easily.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; And they don't celebrate Christmas.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Jehovah witness deal with this easily
[5:38] &gt;&gt; and they DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. ONLY
[5:40] MESSAGE BELIEVERS.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT KNOW MORE THAN MUSLIM AND
[5:45] JEHOVAH WITNESS, THEY THE ONE struggling
[5:47] with it. Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Lollipop.
[5:52] [laughter]
[5:54] &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST WAS NO MORE born on this on
[5:56] on the 25th day of December than I was
[6:00] born.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Because he was born in April.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Uh-huh.
[6:06] IT'S JUST A complete
[6:09] conglomeration of what?
[6:11] &gt;&gt; DOGMA."
[6:12] &gt;&gt; SO CHRISTMAS IS A DOGMA.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; DOGMA. You don't understand what he
[6:18] means. I'm going to come back TO THAT.
[6:21] HE SAY THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT. The
[6:24] whole world as the prophet say has
[6:26] become a petrified sore. That's right.
[6:30] Just it's just no clean thing. Where?
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Nowhere.

[6:46] WHAT? THE RESURRECTION
[6:47] &gt;&gt; AND WHERE DOES GOD APPEAR IN ALL DETECT
[6:51] &gt;&gt; THE reason of this IS BECAUSE THAT MAN

[6:55] &gt;&gt; COMMERCIAL
[6:56] &gt;&gt; IT BECOME A COMMERCIAL PROBLEM
[6:59] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY'S MAKING MONEY ON YOUR
[7:01] IGNORANCE OF WORSHIPING THE DEVIL

[7:14] &gt;&gt; IN THE FEAST OF THE TRUMPET
[7:17] BROTHER BRHAM say talking about the
[7:20] 200,000 demon.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHILE THIS GROUP
[7:25] down here has got 2,000 bound at the
[7:29] river Euphrates,
[7:30] &gt;&gt; he has been bound for 2,000 YEARS
[7:34] &gt;&gt; ALSO. THAT CHURCH HAS BOUND THE WATER
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can be bound.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [laughter]
[7:46] Hallelujah.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Please don't say amen to me. Say amen to
[7:50] the court.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; THEY HAS BANNED THE HOLY GHOST FOR
[7:53] nearly how many years?
[7:55] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Under m back there and under the water
[7:59] &gt;&gt; church ages.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN BANNED NOT at the river
[8:02] Euphrates
[8:04] &gt;&gt; BUT AT THE DOOR OF WATER
[8:06] &gt;&gt; AND WATER
[8:07] &gt;&gt; DOGMA
[8:08] &gt;&gt; THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT CAN'T WORK IN THE
[8:10] CHURCH BECAUSE of a man-made WATER
[8:13] &gt;&gt; SYSTEM. SO DOGMA [screaming] B THE HOLY
[8:15] SPIRIT.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE CLINGING TO A DOGMA, THE
[8:20] SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS BLOCKED.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:26] [laughter]
[8:27] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE
[8:30] LIBERATED.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; SHE'S COMING BACK. THAT IS WHAT THE
[8:33] BIBLE SAY. And my PURPOSE HERE IS TO
[8:36] FREE YOU
[8:37] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN REMOVE THE DOGMA FROM THE
[8:40] CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT HAS BEEN BINDING
[8:42] THE HOLY SPIRIT IN YOUR LIFE.

[9:26] &gt;&gt; Pagan
[9:30] trait. Trait means characteristic.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; So you're not different than a pagan.

[12:43] you make a uh like a folder. You take
[12:47] the one from the hotel and all these

[12:57] listen to this and that's it.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to give it to you
