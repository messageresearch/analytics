[0:13] testified he was righteous. How? By
[0:17] faith. How? By revelation.
[0:21] By revelation Abel offered unto God a
[0:23] more excellent sacrifice because it was
[0:26] revealed to him that it wasn't fruit. to

[29:27] every unspoken prayer request tonight.
[29:29] Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have a testimony. So,
[29:33] please forgive me if I'm out of order,
[29:35] but uh I wasn't going to say anything,
[29:37] but I said, "Lord, if he called me up to
[29:38] pray, then I'm going to have to give the
[29:39] testimony."
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Um
[29:46] This word is I can't explain it, but you
[29:49] all know what I'm talking about.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; It's one thing for somebody to preach by
[29:54] inspiration, but it's one thing for the
[29:56] person to be present
[29:57] &gt;&gt; when the preaching is being done.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; When the Lord had brother Steven
[30:02] preaching on the ant, the very first
[30:04] sermon, I got in my truck and it was an
[30:07] ant over top of my head.
[30:10] My wife said, "Honey, it's an ant right
[30:12] there.
[30:13] said, "Okay."
[30:15] Got to the house. I Well, I tried to I
[30:17] got a napkin. I tried to pick it up. I
[30:19] ain't want to kill the ant. Not after
[30:20] that preach.
[30:22] So, I put the ant I tried to put it out
[30:25] the window,
[30:27] got to the house, and when I was backing
[30:29] into the driveway, she said, "And she
[30:31] said, "Sweetheart, the ant is on your
[30:33] shoulder."
[30:34] I said, "Okay, Lord." So, I took that
[30:38] personal, you know, because God reveals
[30:40] his word. That's the demonstration of
[30:41] the gospel.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; So, I followed instruction. I was
[30:45] diligent, diligent, diligent.
[30:48] Well, I didn't give all of the testimony
[30:50] because I don't like I really don't like
[30:52] coming up here. But
[30:55] my boss that came here that day, the
[30:57] gentleman that hired me, he moved on.
[31:00] So, he was the corporate safety
[31:02] director. They gave me his position.
[31:08] two two three days ago, maybe something
[31:10] like that. But they trying to they tried
[31:11] to work me into it. Now,
[31:16] my wife and my family, we had an
[31:17] appointment. I'm saying this all for one
[31:20] purpose.
[31:21] We went to the appointment, and that's
[31:24] another testimony. It's coming, so I'm
[31:25] just letting y'all know now. And we went
[31:27] to the appointment. We were driving
[31:29] home. We were all talking about it.
[31:32] And while everybody was talking, an
[31:34] inspiration struck me. I said, "I'm
[31:37] gonna have a raise this week."
[31:41] &gt;&gt; And
[31:44] one day came, spoke to the boss,
[31:48] said what I had to say. He said, "Okay."
[31:50] "Well, can you give me 45 days?" I said,
[31:54] "Well, nah, I can't give you 45 days." I
[31:59] said, "I don't I I understand how things
[32:02] work." I said, "I I can't accept that."
[32:05] He said, ' Okay, well, just give me 30.
[32:07] All right. Got off the phone, came
[32:10] upstairs. I told my family. I said,
[32:12] "Hey, I just got my raise."
[32:15] I said, "Uh, I said, uh, Lord didn't
[32:18] technically give it to me yet." I said,
[32:19] "But it's coming."
[32:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "And it's still this week."
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Well, got on the phone today, uh, with
[32:25] the boss and he said, "Well, Charles,
[32:28] you got an extra two minutes?" He said,
[32:30] "Remember the conversation we had?"
[32:32] Said, "Yes, sir."
[32:34] He said, "Well, so and so starting
[32:36] Monday, you'll have your raise." He
[32:39] said, "Now, now this is God." He said,
[32:41] "We don't give raises until March or
[32:45] April." He said, "Yes, it's a corporate.
[32:47] You know how they work in corporate.
[32:48] It's got to be by the letter." He said,
[32:51] "So, but you know, so don't, you know,
[32:53] we we got to wait a little while." He
[32:54] said, "But you know, I didn't have to do
[32:57] much twisting of the arm." He said the
[32:59] moment I you know I took it up the
[33:01] ladder he said it was it was easy. He
[33:04] said he said everybody here you know
[33:06] they speak highly of you.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; So
[33:10] &gt;&gt; saints I can't express it. I wish I can
[33:12] jump into everybody
[33:14] &gt;&gt; so I can give this inspiration to you.
[33:16] But just do what the word is saying.
[33:20] Don't worry about a feeling. Don't worry
[33:23] about don't wait for it. If it comes
[33:26] just speak it. Get it out of your mouth
[33:29] &gt;&gt; and put God in a corner to make him
[33:31] perform that word
[33:33] &gt;&gt; and he'll do it
[33:34] &gt;&gt; and he'll do it because he did. So
[33:37] &gt;&gt; I thank all God's servants for
[33:38] submitting themselves because everybody
[33:40] here submit themselves when the Lord is
[33:42] ministering that word. So we're going
[33:44] into the new year with victory saints.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord God
[33:49] for everything that you're doing in our
[33:51] lives. Lord God, we thank you Lord God
[33:52] because you have given us a word Father
[33:55] that's infallible Lord God. that you
[33:56] have given us a word that can't fail,

[34:00] determined the times and the seasons,
[34:02] heavenly father. And Lord, when we get
[34:04] weak in our faith, Father, you somehow,

[34:07] Father, through the ministering of your
[34:09] word, Father. Lord, and as you give us
[34:11] strength, Heavenly Father, you are still

[34:18] Father. And we thank you for it, Lord
[34:20] God. Lord, we know we're not worthy,
[34:22] Lord God, because you have made us
[34:23] worthy, Lord. We accept these things,
[34:25] Lord God, and we rejoice in these
[34:26] things, Father, because you promise,
[34:28] Lord God, to take care of us, Lord God.
[34:30] And every need that we have, Father, you
[34:32] promise to supply it, Lord God. And as
[34:34] we present ourselves to you, Father,
[34:36] Lord, we first ask for forgiveness,
[34:38] Lord, for our sins, Father. Lord,
[34:40] seeing, Lord, that today's a special day
[34:42] for us, Father. Lord, we can look back
[34:44] on the journey, Lord, that we had
[34:46] throughout the year, Father. We can look
[34:48] back and see all the things you have
[34:50] done in our lives throughout this year,
[34:51] Father. how we progressed it by the
[34:53] moving of your spirit, Father, following
[34:55] the pillar of fire, Lord Jesus Christ,
[34:57] as you have demonstrated your word to
[34:59] us, Lord God. We have taken note
[35:01] thereof, Father. Lord, and we applied it
[35:02] to our lives, Father, and we're walking
[35:04] in victory because you said so, Lord
[35:06] Jesus. Father, we pray, Lord God, that
[35:08] you bless the precious brother, Lord
[35:10] God, and remember his name, Lord God.
[35:12] But we rejoice and praise him and praise
[35:14] your name with him, heavenly father.
[35:16] Continue to do more in his life,
[35:17] heavenly father. Demonstrate more of
[35:19] your power, Lord, in his life, Father.
[35:21] Bless each and every request of your
[35:23] children, Father. Lord, and we pray,
[35:25] Father, that you come down in a powerful
[35:26] way, heavenly father, because your mercy
[35:29] endureth forever, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[35:31] thank you, Lord God. We commit the
[35:33] remainder of the service into your
[35:34] hands, Father. Have your way, Lord God.

[35:38] God, and help us to hear from you, Lord
[35:40] God. Help us all submit to you, Lord
[35:41] Jesus, and strengthen our hand of faith,
[35:43] Lord God. We pray for the tithes and
[35:45] offerings, Father, that you use them for
[35:46] the furtherance of your kingdom, Lord
[35:48] Jesus. We pray these things in the name
[35:50] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

[36:03] ready. Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] As I kneel in the darkness
[36:32] in the middle of the night,
[36:37] I'm praying for assurance
[36:40] that everything's going to be all right.
[36:44] And Lord, I see another battle.
[36:50] It's out in front of me.
[36:53] I'm afraid I won't be able
[36:57] and I'll go down in defeat. But he said,
[37:02] "Do you remember
[37:06] where I brought you from?
[37:10] Just take a look behind you.
[37:14] at how far you come.
[37:18] Oh, well, every time you ask me, didn't
[37:22] I deliver you?
[37:26] So, why would you be thinking
[37:30] that I wouldn't see you through?
[37:34] And I walk on the water
[37:38] and I calm the raging sea.
[37:42] spoke to the wind
[37:46] and hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't
[37:50] I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you
[37:55] when you called?
[37:58] I walked right beside you
[38:02] so you could fall. Did not leave all of
[38:08] heaven
[38:09] was to die for your sins.
[38:13] I searched until I found you and I knew
[38:18] it all.
[38:35] Now she's talking to her father
[38:40] in a house that was once a home. She
[38:43] said, "The bills are coming, Lord. And
[38:48] six days is not that long."

[1:06:19] think on New Year's Eve on New Year's
[1:06:22] night to see different preachers.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I'm reading brother Brandham. I'm going
[1:06:27] to start it again on on paragraph 23.
[1:06:30] Brother Brandham say it is good I think
[1:06:32] on New Year's night to see different
[1:06:35] preachers and the way they approach a
[1:06:39] text and what they say and so forth and
[1:06:42] each man having his own way of
[1:06:45] preaching. Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; You know, God
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; didn't make us all alike.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; He made us different.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; He made us different in our stature.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; He made the world different. And the big
[1:07:03] mountains, the little mountains, the
[1:07:06] prairies, prairies, desert, big white
[1:07:09] flowers, blue flowers and all different
[1:07:12] kind. He just make us different. That's
[1:07:15] all he made. Red head,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; black head,
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; brown head,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; white head,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; fat,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; slam,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; tall.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, whatever more. See, he's just make
[1:07:30] us different. God is a God of variety.
[1:07:34] And I kind of like that. Don't you?
[1:07:37] Congregation says, "Amen."
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; But just the same thing all the time. My
[1:07:44] mama, I like this one.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; So, it's good to have a flavor of
[1:07:50] preacher. This is where I got it from.
[1:07:51] Amen. So, our next preacher is Brother
[1:07:54] Glenn Kelly. Come on, brother Glenn.
[1:08:02] Praise
[1:08:04] God. Seven minute.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Okay then.
[1:08:13] I tell you, I couldn't get out of this.
[1:08:15] I told him, I said, "No, all these fine
[1:08:17] preachers." I said, "Uh, why don't you
[1:08:20] just let me sit back and stay in my amen
[1:08:22] corner in my deacon office?" Okay. He
[1:08:25] said, "No."
[1:08:27] So, I couldn't override him as a father.
[1:08:29] He uses his influence as a pastor.
[1:08:32] Right.
[1:08:35] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us just turn to uh
[1:08:39] Ruth.
[1:08:41] You can stand. Won't be long. That's a
[1:08:44] good thing. I don't have to be long by
[1:08:46] the grace of God. Huh? But it's always
[1:08:48] an honor to come here before God's
[1:08:50] children.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:54] Our hearts and mind are clear. Let us
[1:08:56] pray. Lord God, we thank you for your
[1:08:58] grace, your mercy. We thank you, Father,
[1:09:00] for this opportunity just to come before
[1:09:02] your precious children, Lord God. So we
[1:09:04] lift your name up on high. Father, we
[1:09:06] give you praise. We give you honor. We
[1:09:08] give you glory. Father, we come to lift
[1:09:10] you up. You are the great master. You
[1:09:12] are the great king. Uh so father, we
[1:09:14] can't lift you higher than enough, Lord
[1:09:17] God. But we thank you for the
[1:09:18] testimonies that you allow us to have.
[1:09:21] So we look there on tonight. Bless your
[1:09:23] children, visible, invisible audience
[1:09:26] also, Father. Remember the sick,
[1:09:28] remember the shut in, Father. So we
[1:09:30] thank you and by faith we claim it all
[1:09:32] done in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And
[1:09:35] amen. Let's look at Ruth uh one. You
[1:09:37] know, I've I tell you just a little
[1:09:40] thought was kept ringing in my spirit
[1:09:42] for the last two uh few weeks is uh
[1:09:45] decision. You know how but with this
[1:09:47] highstake decision these are high stake
[1:09:51] decisions. When you make a high stake
[1:09:53] decision then that mean a lot is
[1:09:55] involved.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? You can either lose some or you
[1:09:58] can gain some. It can be reversible or
[1:10:01] irreversible. Okay? But we're talking
[1:10:03] about making a decision. Let's look at
[1:10:06] Ruth 1 and look at verse 16. He says,
[1:10:09] "And Ruth said,"Entreat me not to leave
[1:10:12] thee or to return from following after
[1:10:15] thee. From whether thou goest, I will
[1:10:17] go, and whether thou lodge, I will
[1:10:20] lodge." He said, "Thy people shall be my
[1:10:22] people, and thy God my God." You may be
[1:10:24] seated.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wherefore thine will I die."
[1:10:29] He said, "There will I be buried, and
[1:10:32] the Lord do to me, and more also if we
[1:10:35] ought but deadart thee and me." He said,
[1:10:39] "When she saw that she was steadfast
[1:10:43] minded to go with her,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; it says then she what left speaking to
[1:10:48] her." So, we're looking here. I'm not
[1:10:49] going. This is a uh I tell you, you need
[1:10:51] to go look into Revelations 3 and go
[1:10:54] into there in verse part uh Revelations
[1:10:57] 4 and part three. And it goes deep into
[1:10:59] this. It brings you up until the end
[1:11:01] time. It brings you up until what God is
[1:11:03] bringing in our day because you know
[1:11:05] you're a privileged people to hear this.
[1:11:07] This is the only time this information
[1:11:10] is being revealed. It was not been
[1:11:12] revealed in no other age. This is the
[1:11:15] only age that was in the back mind of
[1:11:17] God is bringing forward now. Is that
[1:11:20] right? Because it can only be brought to
[1:11:22] his bride. Is that right? Only the bride
[1:11:25] of Jesus Christ. Because remember now
[1:11:27] she was deciding. Is that right? First
[1:11:30] she come in that was justification. Is
[1:11:32] that right? And then she came she was
[1:11:34] what? Serving. Is that right? Then after
[1:11:36] she serving that what? And that was
[1:11:38] sanctification. Is that right? That was
[1:11:40] brother Brandon said she was sitting and
[1:11:42] she was just sitting there. But when she
[1:11:45] was gleaning in the field in the
[1:11:46] sanctification stage, what she was doing
[1:11:49] was uh just trying to gain favor. Is
[1:11:52] that right? Some of you still struggling
[1:11:55] in sanctification stage. Right? But
[1:11:57] you're not going to gain favor in this
[1:11:59] age. Is that right? Because the thunders
[1:12:01] have been open. The seals have released
[1:12:03] the thunders. Right? So we know the
[1:12:06] thunders that is no longer is just
[1:12:08] justification as a denominational saying
[1:12:10] it. Sanctification as a denominational
[1:12:13] will say it. Justification we know to
[1:12:15] the bride mean what? You've never done
[1:12:17] it. Is that right? Now we're sanctified
[1:12:20] by the washing of the water of the pure
[1:12:22] word. Is that right? After she was
[1:12:24] sanctified then she was doing what? She
[1:12:26] was resting. Is that right? Then she
[1:12:28] became resting. Now she had what? The
[1:12:30] Holy Ghost. Is that right? She was
[1:12:32] resting in the Holy Ghost just for Boaz
[1:12:35] to go and fulfill the plan of
[1:12:37] redemption. Is that right? She was just
[1:12:39] resting. We're just resting now sitting.
[1:12:42] Is that right? Reaping all the benefits
[1:12:44] and all the promises of God. Is that
[1:12:47] right? Because we know when you make a
[1:12:49] decision. Is that right? You got to move
[1:12:51] forward and you can't look back. But the
[1:12:54] beautiful thing about us is we can't get
[1:12:56] out of this cuz you didn't make the
[1:12:58] decision. God made the decision. God
[1:13:01] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:13:03] world. God got a purpose for you. We
[1:13:05] going to fulfill it. Is that right? Look
[1:13:08] out, Satan. Uh God has brought his bride
[1:13:10] in the end time. Hallelujah. God bless
[1:13:14] you. Come on, pastor.
[1:13:22] Praise
[1:13:25] God. Praise God. Praise God. I believe
[1:13:28] this is shorter than 7 minutes. Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to pray for the all the
[1:13:34] oncoming preachers. So, you don't take
[1:13:36] time to pray.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, I
[1:13:40] pray that you bless every scripture that
[1:13:42] will be read here tonight. Father,
[1:13:44] anoint each one of them in the name of
[1:13:47] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; So, when you come, just know you already
[1:13:52] been prayed over.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] I'm going to cut it short. And now that
[1:14:05] we stopped in justification,
[1:14:07] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[1:14:09] Holy Ghost, is that right? It only occur
[1:14:11] before your bride. So, you got to
[1:14:13] understand what God has called. You
[1:14:15] know, we all get to a point where you
[1:14:17] have to make a decision. Is that right?
[1:14:19] Abraham was getting old. Is that right?
[1:14:21] Abraham had to make a decision and he
[1:14:24] had to make a decision soon. Is that
[1:14:26] right? He was a type of God. Uh, and
[1:14:28] when he coming in him being a type of
[1:14:30] God, uh, he had to find a true servant.
[1:14:33] Is that right?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; A true servant. Where they at? A true
[1:14:37] servant. Where's the servants at? Huh?
[1:14:39] Where's the servants at? God had to find
[1:14:42] a true servant that he can trust that
[1:14:45] was loyal to the word of God. Is that
[1:14:47] right? He saw what you were going to
[1:14:50] fulfill before the foundation of the
[1:14:52] world. Is that right? I want to read one
[1:14:55] thing. thing. I don't want him to say,
[1:14:56] "I didn't read a quote." Let me read
[1:14:57] this one quote.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; It's loaded, saints. You need to go
[1:15:02] there. You need to go there and look and
[1:15:04] look at this. Okay?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And you look at it. We're talking about
[1:15:07] a decision.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; You're talking about decision.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; God made a mighty decision through you.
[1:15:13] Is that right?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; A high stake decision. It's a critical
[1:15:17] choice.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It says with significance. It says often
[1:15:21] irresistible. The consequences for
[1:15:23] individuals. It could be organization
[1:15:25] situations involving things right risk
[1:15:29] reward or impact or of your future or
[1:15:32] your finance. Your decisions could be
[1:15:34] wrong decisions right decisions. God
[1:15:37] don't tell his prophets everything. Is
[1:15:38] that right? But remember Isa remember
[1:15:41] Isaac was deceived. Is that right? Isaac
[1:15:44] was deceived by who? Rebecca and who?
[1:15:48] And Esau. I mean Jacob. Is that right?
[1:15:50] But that was a purpose. It was there for
[1:15:52] a purpose. God allowed them to be
[1:15:55] deceived because God had already what?
[1:15:57] Made a decision that was going to be
[1:15:59] twins in her womb. Is that right? And
[1:16:02] they were going to war against one
[1:16:03] another. But the older was going to you
[1:16:06] rule the younger. Is that right? But it
[1:16:08] was a prophecy that had to be fulfilled.
[1:16:10] Uh so when he came in there, Abraham,
[1:16:13] Isaac had to make a decision. But Jacob,
[1:16:17] he knew the importance of the
[1:16:19] birthright. Is that right? He knew that
[1:16:21] important. But before we but the time
[1:16:25] before before now remember Isaac was
[1:16:28] getting older.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And at the time I think I got the story
[1:16:32] but let me back up. Abraham this where
[1:16:35] I'm at. Abraham. Is that right? Abraham.
[1:16:38] Isaac was getting older with Abraham. Is
[1:16:40] that Isaac was getting what? 40 years
[1:16:43] old about that. Is that right? So he
[1:16:45] needed a bride
[1:16:47] and he had to find a bride for him. So
[1:16:50] he had to send Elees after him. Is that
[1:16:53] right?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; But why did he send him the bride? Why
[1:16:57] did he have to have the right bride? Uh
[1:17:00] let me read this quote.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look,
[1:17:04] he says, "And the time had come for
[1:17:06] Abraham, the great patriarch
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; and servant of God to make a decision.
[1:17:14] And this decision was that he was to
[1:17:18] decide just on who his son Isaac that he
[1:17:23] had waited 25 years for and had received
[1:17:27] him as one from the dead. He says and
[1:17:31] know that he was called and separate
[1:17:34] messenger of God. Look what the purpose.
[1:17:38] Brother Random said you know the cause
[1:17:39] but you got to know the the cause. the
[1:17:42] purpose, the cause to have a cure. Is
[1:17:45] that right? You got to know the cause.
[1:17:47] Why was it so important? Why is it so
[1:17:50] important that the Bible says, "Do not
[1:17:53] be unevenly yolked." Why is it so
[1:17:56] important? Your pastor is teaching you
[1:17:58] about courtship and leading you that
[1:18:01] way. Look what he says here. Help me,
[1:18:03] Lord. He says now and had received him
[1:18:07] as one from the dead and know that he
[1:18:10] was called and separated messenger of
[1:18:12] God. And there was a time come when he
[1:18:15] had to make a decision
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; who would be his help meat to carry on
[1:18:22] the plan of God.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; You are the ones that God chose to call
[1:18:30] to carry on the plan of God. God bless
[1:18:34] you, brother.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:18:40] God.
[1:18:42] Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; If you happy and you know it, say amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The Bible says in the book
[1:18:53] of Ruth, he say, "Entreat me not not
[1:18:55] entreat me not to leave thee or return
[1:18:58] from following thee." That's what the
[1:19:00] brother read. Amen. And then down he
[1:19:03] says that when she saw that she was
[1:19:06] steadfastly minded to go with her, then
[1:19:09] she left speaking unto her. You got to
[1:19:14] be persistent in your faith.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; There is.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; There is.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; People need to see your eyes.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, brother.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And see that this one there is no way to
[1:19:27] turn around.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime the discouragement may
[1:19:31] come from your family member.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was Naomi trying to
[1:19:38] discourage ROF.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Discouragement from a mother-in-law. But
[1:19:43] Ruth had a revelation. She said Naomi
[1:19:47] stopped from continuing in this path
[1:19:49] because I ain't going back.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And when Naomi saw that she was
[1:19:53] steadfast
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; on her decision, then that was it. You
[1:19:58] got to be sure on your decision.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You got to be so sure until when
[1:20:04] somebody want to talk to you about this
[1:20:06] message
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; to leave this message. When they look at
[1:20:09] your eyes,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; they say this one is sold out. There is
[1:20:15] no way to turn him back.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; So stay steadfast on your faith.
[1:20:21] Whatever the Lord revealed to you, stay
[1:20:23] right there.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stay persistent and the
[1:20:28] devil will leave you alone.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; The second one. 7 minute. Brother
[1:20:33] Polycarp. Come on.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glory to God.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:20:50] God bless you.
[1:20:56] Let's go to the book of uh
[1:21:06] chapter 1 verse 9. And it's time
[1:21:11] the book of Naom the prophet.
[1:21:15] Thank you.
[1:21:18] Chapi uh chapter 1 verse 9. Amen.
[1:21:25] What do you imagine against the Lord?
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; He will make another end. Affliction
[1:21:36] shall not rise up the second time.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Matthew.
[1:21:50] Matthew chapter
[1:21:52] 11. You may be seated.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 11
[1:22:01] verse two.
[1:22:08] Now when John had heard in the prison he
[1:22:11] the works of of Christ,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; the works of Christ,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; he sent two of his disciples
[1:22:20] and say unto him are da
[1:22:24] or do we look for another?
[1:22:32] Jesus answer and say unto them, "Go and
[1:22:34] show John again those things which he do
[1:22:37] hear and see."
[1:22:43] The blind receive their sight, the lame
[1:22:45] walk, the lepers are cleansed.
[1:22:51] And the deaf hear
[1:22:57] the dead are raised up and the poor have
[1:22:59] the gospel preached to them.
[1:23:02] Okay,
[1:23:07] I'm going to go again to the book of
[1:23:09] Luke.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 7 and verse 11.
[1:23:18] The Bible says this,
[1:23:24] "And it came to pass the day after that
[1:23:27] he went into a city called N
[1:23:34] and many of his disciple went with him
[1:23:36] and much people.
[1:23:40] Now when he came nigh to the gate of the
[1:23:42] city,
[1:23:44] behold, there was a dead man carried
[1:23:46] out.
[1:23:49] The only son of his mother, she was a
[1:23:51] widow,
[1:23:55] and much people of the city was with
[1:23:58] her.
[1:24:02] And when the Lord saw her, he had
[1:24:04] compassion.
[1:24:05] And say unto him, weep not.
[1:24:08] And he came
[1:24:10] and touched the B.
[1:24:13] And they that bear him. And he say,
[1:24:16] Young man,
[1:24:18] I say unto thee, arise.
[1:24:21] And he that was dead sat up and began to
[1:24:24] speak,
[1:24:27] and he delivered him to his mother.
[1:24:31] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:24:34] word.
[1:24:37] My little subject tonight,
[1:24:43] be not afraid. You are not going to end
[1:24:46] up your life in distress.
[1:24:52] No matter I know that we are in the
[1:24:54] month of December
[1:24:57] and we are at the eve of 2026.
[1:25:01] Maybe you had project.
[1:25:04] Maybe you have a lot of ambitions
[1:25:09] and nothing was actually accomplished.
[1:25:13] But let me tell you, you are not late.
[1:25:18] God may do something.
[1:25:21] No matter your situation,
[1:25:25] we read what the Lord spoke in the Bible
[1:25:28] that affliction shall not rise up the
[1:25:30] second time.
[1:25:33] So we saw servants of God
[1:25:36] that were also in distress.
[1:25:38] That was John the Baptist just like you
[1:25:41] and me.
[1:25:44] Sometime we might fail on our faith.
[1:25:48] You might even lose your trust in God.
[1:25:51] This is what happened to John the
[1:25:53] Baptist.
[1:25:55] He was almost like a bachelor.
[1:25:58] And what happened to him?
[1:26:00] He was in prison
[1:26:02] and he was afraid
[1:26:05] and he forgot himself. Then he was the
[1:26:08] one that introduced the Messiah. He
[1:26:10] said, "Behold the lamb of God that can
[1:26:13] take away the sin of the world. In him
[1:26:15] was everything." But John the Baptist
[1:26:18] because of the
[1:26:20] because of the circumstances just like
[1:26:22] you.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe nothing is working in your life.
[1:26:26] Maybe your business are not working.
[1:26:28] Maybe your marriage is not working and
[1:26:30] you are discouraged. Maybe you in
[1:26:32] distress. Let me tell you something. The
[1:26:36] Lord is with you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist sent the disciple.
[1:26:46] Go ask
[1:26:48] is it him
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; or should we wait for someone else?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And here is the answer of Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] the master. He says
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; look
[1:27:01] this the blind are the the and the devil
[1:27:07] and the gospel is preached.
[1:27:09] Go and report this to John.
[1:27:12] report to John what and what you see.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Just like your faith,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; you lost faith because of circumstances
[1:27:26] because it's already at the end of
[1:27:27] December
[1:27:29] 2025
[1:27:31] everything you were expecting
[1:27:33] nothing work
[1:27:35] but he can walk tonight.
[1:27:37] Just tonight
[1:27:39] if you can have confidence in him, God
[1:27:41] is able. We read here in the book of
[1:27:45] Luke,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; this is a story you all know.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a widow.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And she only have one child. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:57] Only one child.
[1:28:00] Her husband was dead
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; and they were bringing her son
[1:28:07] to go bury him.
[1:28:11] And the people came to comfort her.
[1:28:15] And Jesus also met them.
[1:28:20] She was coming out of the city to bear
[1:28:22] her son.
[1:28:24] They're trying to get out of the city.
[1:28:27] 202
[1:28:28] leaving 2025.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was coming from 2026.
[1:28:35] And Jesus met
[1:28:38] and they met at the again. It again
[1:28:46] your situation will be stopped.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; What happened my brother?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; When Jesus saw it,
[1:28:54] Jesus had compassion
[1:28:56] and Jesus touched the widow.
[1:28:59] Say stop crying.
[1:29:02] And the widow could say,
[1:29:06] "Why are you stopping me from crying?"
[1:29:09] "H Pastor Jesus,
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; I only have one child.
[1:29:15] My husband was already there.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And today you telling me not crying
[1:29:22] and she look at other widow.
[1:29:24] You probably you're not a widow. You
[1:29:26] have husband
[1:29:28] and you man, you have
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; but I don't have a husband.
[1:29:33] I only have one child and that son is
[1:29:36] gone.
[1:29:40] There are mothers that have four
[1:29:42] children, maybe five children. You have
[1:29:45] three children. You have two children,
[1:29:47] but I don't have so many.
[1:29:50] And Jesus understood
[1:29:55] that comforting somebody by word is not
[1:29:57] enough.
[1:30:00] I must act. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; I must do something.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And I want Jesus to have compassion on
[1:30:10] you tonight.
[1:30:12] Not only to have compassion, but I want
[1:30:15] Jesus to do something in your situation.
[1:30:18] Tonight, tonight,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; what happened
[1:30:27] there? He he he he came near.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; I want Jesus to approach your situation
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; and he touched the coffin.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; It was in the coffin or the buyer that
[1:30:44] they put the child the child of the
[1:30:46] widow.
[1:30:48] me and you tonight.
[1:30:51] I don't know what belongs to you that is
[1:30:53] already in the maybe your health is in a
[1:30:56] cup.
[1:30:58] Maybe your work is in the maybe your
[1:31:01] business is in a
[1:31:03] not working. You are moving in
[1:31:06] desperation.

[1:31:11] But tonight,
[1:31:14] don't let it go. Don't let go.
[1:31:17] And your marriage is not working. And
[1:31:20] your marriage is in the coffin.

[1:31:28] And every time you have a child and a
[1:31:31] pregnancy, you keep having miscarriage.
[1:31:33] Meaning everything go into the coffin.
[1:31:36] But tonight, God is going to touch your
[1:31:38] coffin.
[1:31:40] He's going to touch your coffin. He's
[1:31:42] going to touch your coffin. Would the
[1:31:46] people that were holding the fire they
[1:31:48] stop?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Whoever is carrying your problem,
[1:31:56] the the the coffin of your health, of
[1:32:00] your finances, of your marriage, of your
[1:32:04] engagement, of your study, of your work.
[1:32:08] They need to stop tonight
[1:32:11] because Jesus has come. ever stop in
[1:32:14] Jesus name.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; "Young man,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; I order you."
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; He stopped the young man.
[1:32:32] Somebody who was in the
[1:32:35] work that was in the
[1:32:37] must stand up.
[1:32:39] They must come out from the cross your
[1:32:41] health.

[1:32:57] And the one who was dead sat up and
[1:33:00] begin to speak
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; and Jesus brought him back to his
[1:33:04] mother.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; So the man that was dead sat up.
[1:33:10] When they say he startability,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; it means there is a stability.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; What was dead

[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So just going to take um this from
[1:35:59] first Peter chapter 1. Uh-huh.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; always not easy to switch from one
[1:36:09] anointing to the other shouting amen and
[1:36:11] coming back to preach. Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; But just bless the name of the living
[1:36:16] God. Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Now, first Peter chapter 1 verse 22.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:36:24] He said, "Seeing ye have purified
[1:36:28] your souls in obeying the truth." That's
[1:36:31] right.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:36:36] of the brethren.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; So the word is coming to purify our
[1:36:42] souls.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. See that you love one another with
[1:36:46] a pure heart fervently.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. being born again,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; not of corruptible seed,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; by the word of God,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; which liveth and abideth forever.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; For all flesh is as grass,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and all the glory of man as the flower
[1:37:09] of grass. The grass witherth, and the
[1:37:12] flower thereof fallth away, but the word
[1:37:15] of the Lord endureth forever. And this
[1:37:19] is the word which by the gospel is
[1:37:23] preached unto you.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; So even as we sit, we want to take um
[1:37:28] Zechariah chapter 10.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] Zechariah chapter 10.
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Now my message tonight is a goodly
[1:37:45] people.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] a goodly people.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Now, we read in um the book of first
[1:37:55] Peter that the Lord brought his word to
[1:37:58] purify our heart.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Now, making us pure.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; So, the word is doing something for us.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Now, when the word is doing something,
[1:38:10] there's a reason why the word is doing
[1:38:12] that. Uh-huh.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Now, um, uh, Zechariah 10:1, it said,
[1:38:19] "Ask ye of the Lord."
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Reign.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; In the time of the latter rain.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So, the Lord purifies your heart.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And then now comes back to you and says,
[1:38:34] "Ask
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; rain
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; in the time of the latter rain."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; In the season of the latter rain,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; the season of the latter rain. Ask for
[1:38:43] rain.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; So the Lord is saying do not keep mute.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Open your mouth
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; and go to the Lord and say Lord I need
[1:38:56] this
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; because your word has said
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; that you supply all of my needs.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Brother saidh
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; that God will create the circumstances.
[1:39:12] or he will create the situation to match
[1:39:15] his word.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; So when he has sent the word he will
[1:39:20] make sure that he will take the son of
[1:39:23] God create the condition to match up his
[1:39:27] word. So when he said I am the Lord your
[1:39:30] healer
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; he will come to you and make sure that
[1:39:34] your circumstance will match that word.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible said that the word will
[1:39:39] not go back to him void.
[1:39:42] The word has an aim of accomplishment.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So when the word is coming, it must
[1:39:49] match up with your circumstance or your
[1:39:51] situation to produce the result.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of
[1:40:01] the latter rain.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So the Lord shall make bright clouds
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; and give them showers of rain.
[1:40:12] to every
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; every
[1:40:17] one grass in the field.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Every one of us in the field,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ is the field
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; and each one of us form part of the
[1:40:32] field. So the promise is to every one
[1:40:36] grass.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; So when we come to God and ask of rain,
[1:40:40] His promise is that he will give us
[1:40:43] showers of rain.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Showers,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; not singular, showers, plural
[1:40:52] every situation
[1:40:54] in your life.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; He has promised that he's going to
[1:40:58] shower rain. Amen. To accomplish the
[1:41:02] purpose of his word.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Now, just jump to verse three. He said
[1:41:10] my anger was kindled against the
[1:41:12] shepherds.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means um those he he had said
[1:41:17] okay let me just read verse two. He said
[1:41:18] for the idols have spoken vanity
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; and the divveness have seen a lie and
[1:41:25] have told false dreams. They comfort in
[1:41:28] vain. Therefore they went their way as a
[1:41:32] flock.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; They were troubled because there was no
[1:41:35] shepherd.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. My anger was kindled
[1:41:38] against the shepherds.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; And I punished the goats. For the Lord
[1:41:43] of hosts,
[1:41:45] the Lord of hosts,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; have visited his flock,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; the house of Judah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And we have the Lord visiting us
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; in this end time.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; In the cloud.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; So he comes to tell you that I am the
[1:42:02] Lord of hosts
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; that has visited you.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And have made them
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; as his godly horse
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; in battle.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Ready for again.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Goodly horse
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; in battle.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; What is your battle tonight?
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; God says he's made you
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; a godly horse
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; in that battle. Now when you look at a
[1:42:34] horse in battle, Amen sir,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; the horse is not fighting
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; but the horse is bringing the horse
[1:42:41] rider
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; into the battle.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; So the horse is present in the battle
[1:42:48] and is watching
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; the horse rider fighting the enemy.
[1:42:55] So whatever situation
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; that happened in your life,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; the Lord is calling you as a horse,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; bring him to that battle and let him do
[1:43:05] the fight. You are just watching with
[1:43:08] your eyes. Whatever financial battle,
[1:43:12] whatever physical battle, whatever
[1:43:15] spiritual battle, bring him under scene
[1:43:18] tonight and he will do the fighting.
[1:43:25] Amen. And amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet gave us
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; four corners
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; of deliverance. I I call them four
[1:43:36] corners.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Spiritual blessing,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; physical blessing,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; financial blessing,
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; material blessing.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't call us to just be um
[1:43:50] specialist in just one corner.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Some of us are specialists in only
[1:43:57] healing.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; So it is only healing your whole life.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; But we have four corners of the whole
[1:44:03] building.

[1:44:30] battle, we are goodly people.

[1:44:36] beautiful. Amen. Even in your situation,
[1:44:39] you are going to be shining. Amen. that
[1:44:42] even the situation will look at you and
[1:44:44] said, "You don't belong here." The
[1:44:46] situation of disease will say, "Hey, you
[1:44:49] are too beautiful to be here." The
[1:44:52] situation of poverty will look at you
[1:44:54] and say, "You are a son of God. You
[1:44:57] don't belong here. 2026, a goodly
[1:45:00] people." God bless you.

[1:45:36] fight. You push and he fight. You push
[1:45:39] and he fight. You push and he fight.
[1:45:42] He's going with your direction. So don't
[1:45:45] stand still. Keep pushing.

[1:45:50] Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost, push.

[1:45:57] we going to push our way out of here.
[1:46:05] Are we together?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I have I might have to
[1:46:09] lower the minute because time is going
[1:46:11] quickly. Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I might have to lower the minute.
[1:46:16] Let's go. Five minutes. Five is still
[1:46:18] grace, my friend. Brother Charles Third.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, my brother.

[1:46:32] going.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Go ahead.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's all God because
[1:46:39] brother, you took my scripture, brother.
[1:46:45] But he he already covered the prayer
[1:46:46] part. So, I'm just going with the
[1:46:48] thankfulness part. Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're gonna turn to First
[1:46:52] Thessalonians 5 verse 16 to 18. Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, it reads, "Rejoice
[1:46:59] ever more. Pray without ceasing. In
[1:47:02] everything give thanks, for this is the
[1:47:03] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:47:05] you." Amen. So that means in the good
[1:47:07] times, in the bad times, and the yeses
[1:47:10] and the nos. Amen. Because we have a
[1:47:11] discernment of the time. Amen. We have a
[1:47:13] discernment of what's the purpose of it
[1:47:15] is. Amen. Because we know that the Lord
[1:47:17] says in his word that his thoughts of us
[1:47:19] are of peace and not of evil. Amen. To
[1:47:21] give us an expected end. Amen. He even
[1:47:23] says, you know, on the mountain tops and
[1:47:25] you're being led in the valleys. Amen.
[1:47:26] We we know why the reason is. Amen.
[1:47:28] Because he was there first. Amen. So he
[1:47:30] knows the path already. Amen. All you
[1:47:32] have to do is just follow him. Amen.
[1:47:34] Because we know that greater is he
[1:47:35] that's in us than he that is in the
[1:47:37] world. Amen. Amen. Because you continue.
[1:47:40] And he says uh in in the darkness and
[1:47:41] the light, it's the same. Amen. So to
[1:47:44] God, it's the same. Nothing when we're
[1:47:46] in the darkness, we know there's a it's
[1:47:48] it's just an opportunity for the light
[1:47:49] to shine. Amen. Because he says, "Reise,
[1:47:52] realize your light has come." Amen.
[1:47:54] Because the dark darker the light is,
[1:47:56] the brighter you shine. Amen. The the
[1:47:57] the the more the more pressure you have,
[1:48:00] the better the diamond you get out of
[1:48:01] it. Amen. Amen. See, see, because see,
[1:48:04] cuz Lord sacrifi the Lord walked through
[1:48:06] that sacrifice himself when he had
[1:48:07] Abraham go to sleep. Amen. He walked
[1:48:10] through himself. He swore by himself.
[1:48:11] Amen. So like, like the brother was
[1:48:13] saying, we just push forward. Amen. You
[1:48:15] push forward and the Lord does the work.
[1:48:17] Amen. Because he swore by himself. He's
[1:48:19] immutable. He has a reputation to uphold
[1:48:20] for himself. Amen. Amen. See, because
[1:48:23] see, he's omnipotent. Amen. He's he he's
[1:48:25] he's a he's our advocate. Amen. See,
[1:48:28] amen. Uh uh because man's ways are not
[1:48:30] of himself. Amen. See, because we can
[1:48:33] think we're going a certain direction,
[1:48:35] but it's just the Lord leading us that
[1:48:36] way to begin with. Amen. Amen. See, and
[1:48:39] um we have a a word of the day I want to
[1:48:41] share with y'all. I have a app on my
[1:48:43] phone gives me the word of the day. And
[1:48:45] the word of today was a was a
[1:48:47] quintessence. And what that means is the
[1:48:49] most perfect or typical example of
[1:48:51] equality or class. Amen. So we are the
[1:48:54] quintessence of the scripture. We're the
[1:48:56] we're the quintessence of this word.
[1:48:58] Amen. We we are the perfect embodiment
[1:49:01] of this word. Amen. See you. We're the
[1:49:03] perfect class. We're we're the we're the
[1:49:05] god race. Amen. See and when when you're
[1:49:07] the god race, amen, everything is below
[1:49:09] you. And brother Benham said, brother
[1:49:11] Benham said, see when civil this
[1:49:13] civilization is below us, it's like a
[1:49:15] pig. Amen. So we don't desire the things
[1:49:17] of this world. Amen. We're soldiers in
[1:49:19] Christ. We press forward. Amen. We press
[1:49:21] forward to the mark of the high calling.
[1:49:23] Amen. We put aside the weights and the
[1:49:25] in in the sense that that's easily beset
[1:49:26] us. Amen. Amen. See, because when when
[1:49:29] when you realize that in 1 Timothy 6:18,
[1:49:32] Amen. The latter part of that scripture
[1:49:34] says you must be willing to communicate.
[1:49:36] Willing to communicate. Willing to
[1:49:38] communicate what? This gospel. Will
[1:49:40] willing to communicate the goodness of
[1:49:42] God. I mean, willing because when you
[1:49:44] have the faith, the faith produces a um
[1:49:47] a willingness to to to to spread joy, to
[1:49:50] spread your testimony. I mean, when you
[1:49:52] spread your testimony, Amen. It's it's
[1:49:55] infectious. It touches others. Amen. It
[1:49:57] causes others to be convinced and then
[1:49:58] concerned as well. Amen. Amen. And uh
[1:50:02] Amen. That that's that's what I had to
[1:50:03] say. God bless you.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Praise
[1:50:13] God. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:18] Amen. I know what's happening. Amen.
[1:50:21] When you get going, you start it start
[1:50:23] flowing. Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. You are an elite
[1:50:28] class.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; It's called the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let me move closer. Brother
[1:50:37] Dearm, brother Albert, come on.
[1:50:45] Don't get tired. We still have two more.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm need to go five minutes, then
[1:50:54] we move on. Amen.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Hello. God bless you all. I believe
[1:51:03] we're doing good.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; If we could all stand to read the
[1:51:08] scripture. Amen.
[1:51:10] If we can go to 1 Peter chapter 5:8,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; if you're there, can you say amen?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; The scripture reads this.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; It says, "Be sober, be vigilant, because
[1:51:31] your adversary, the devil, as a roaring
[1:51:34] lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:51:37] devour." You may be seated. And I also
[1:51:39] want to read a quick another one in
[1:51:43] Jeremiah.
[1:51:49] Jeremiah chapter 3,
[1:52:02] excuse me.
[1:52:04] Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 2022.
[1:52:09] Surely as a wife treacherously depart
[1:52:12] departeth from her husband, so have ye
[1:52:15] dealt treacherously with me, oh house of
[1:52:18] Israel, says the Lord. A voice a voice
[1:52:21] was heard upon the high place, weeping
[1:52:24] and supplication of the children of
[1:52:25] Israel, for they have perverted their
[1:52:27] way, and they have forgotten the Lord
[1:52:30] their God. Return ye backsliding
[1:52:33] children and I will heal your
[1:52:35] backsliding
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; your backslidings. Behold we come unto
[1:52:40] thee for thou art the Lord our God.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; May the God bless the reading of his
[1:52:45] word. And as for my subject today, it's
[1:52:49] arise soldier of the cross, lock in. For
[1:52:51] those that know it, it just means to be
[1:52:53] focused. In other words, the reason why
[1:52:56] I chose that is because I love watching
[1:52:58] um
[1:53:01] soldiers of faith like Paul and like
[1:53:05] Martin that was spoken in the church
[1:53:07] ages. And the reason why I picked this
[1:53:09] because in this time and age, you can we
[1:53:11] cannot afford to be backsliding. We
[1:53:12] cannot afford to do anything that's
[1:53:14] contrary to the word because the devil,
[1:53:16] like the scripture say, is like a
[1:53:17] roaring lion seeking who he can devour.
[1:53:20] And just to give like a quick uh
[1:53:22] example, for example, I went to a place
[1:53:24] one time and it was me and a beloved. We
[1:53:27] were walking. We were trying to and I
[1:53:28] tried to greet a sister, a mother or so.
[1:53:30] And she ignored me. And as we were going
[1:53:32] up in the elev elevator, she finally
[1:53:34] noticed who I was. And after she was
[1:53:36] like, "Aren't you the son of my father?"
[1:53:38] Then he noticed the other brother. He
[1:53:39] was like, "Aren't you the son of this
[1:53:40] and this?" Then after that, she was
[1:53:42] like, "We're going to Oh, so y'all are
[1:53:44] chosen to be like a part of like the
[1:53:47] wedding or so. we're gonna see the way
[1:53:49] you're dancing. But the attitude she
[1:53:51] gave seems like they were just waiting
[1:53:53] for our downfall. And the reason why I
[1:53:55] said that because many times as
[1:53:58] believers, wherever you're walking,
[1:53:59] there's many people that are there that
[1:54:01] will always look at you to see if you're
[1:54:02] going to fall. And the moment you fall,
[1:54:04] that's when they're going to seize it
[1:54:05] and after that start acting upon it. And
[1:54:07] I'm here to tell you that you should not
[1:54:08] falter. You should not let every just
[1:54:11] because everything may seem to appear
[1:54:13] nice or someone may seem to appear good,
[1:54:15] it doesn't mean for you to slack off or
[1:54:17] anything like that because just that
[1:54:19] instant of you slacking off is what's
[1:54:21] going to cost you a lot.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And if I could read from the prophet for
[1:54:25] a little bit, he says man was made a
[1:54:27] secondary god on earth. He was given the
[1:54:29] power to control all things, all
[1:54:31] elements of the earth and was Adam. And
[1:54:34] Adam was given these great powers. But
[1:54:36] then the power that he was given to make
[1:54:38] his choices is where he fell. And Adam
[1:54:41] could speak to the winds and he and it
[1:54:44] will stop. He could speak to the trees
[1:54:46] and they would obey him. He could speak
[1:54:48] to the wild wildlife, it would obey him.
[1:54:51] He could speak to the waters ever ever
[1:54:55] what it was everything obeyed Adam. Now
[1:54:58] that's the beginning of man. That's what
[1:55:00] God give men gave him power over
[1:55:03] everything on earth. And the reason why
[1:55:04] I say that because in our walk as we're
[1:55:06] walking and we're advancing to the mark
[1:55:08] of the high calling, we're supposed to
[1:55:10] stay diligent and vigilant. Sure,
[1:55:12] sometime you might fall a little bit,
[1:55:14] but you have to pick yourself up and
[1:55:15] keep going. Brother Brenham even spoke
[1:55:17] about having brethrens that will support
[1:55:19] you and help you to keep pushing
[1:55:20] whenever you backslide. They'll put you
[1:55:22] back in the right path and you and the
[1:55:24] believer is supposed to stay with the
[1:55:25] word of God. Like I was listening to the
[1:55:27] church ages when they were talking about
[1:55:28] Martin. Can you believe a man that stick
[1:55:30] with God to a point where they will even
[1:55:32] kind of crucify him and put him on on a
[1:55:33] tree and then when his enemy expected
[1:55:36] him to fall a certain way to die, the
[1:55:38] tree fell the opposite way. Can you
[1:55:39] believe certain people like Paul,
[1:55:41] someone who worked for God to the point
[1:55:43] where he was stoned and died and after
[1:55:45] he was resurrected and continued to work
[1:55:47] for God. See, people like that aspire
[1:55:50] should be aspiring us to do greater to
[1:55:52] do the greater works and to keep
[1:55:54] advancing and to not fall. And when we
[1:55:56] fall, he tells us to pick it up and keep
[1:55:57] going like Shamgar. Shamgard. There were
[1:56:00] Philistines, I believe, that came up and
[1:56:03] tried to tried to take his crop. And he
[1:56:06] said enough is enough. And after he
[1:56:07] picked up his ox um
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; ox glow and he went on and killed a
[1:56:13] thousand people because he was diligent
[1:56:15] and he was persistent in his walk. He
[1:56:17] was persistent. All thing like Enoch,
[1:56:19] all you see in the Bible about Enoch, it
[1:56:21] says that he walked with God till he was
[1:56:23] gone. meaning he was persistent wherever
[1:56:25] he went with God and to the point where
[1:56:27] even if we don't even know if he failed
[1:56:29] or not, we don't know if anything bad
[1:56:31] happened because he was so persistent
[1:56:32] with God. When you're persistent with
[1:56:34] God in God, God will cover your faults
[1:56:36] and God will keep you moving forward.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I could read um one more
[1:56:45] thing,
[1:56:48] the prophet of God says
[1:56:51] in at thy word, Lord, 1954, he said this
[1:56:56] should never die and you're just with
[1:56:59] all the unity among you people. You
[1:57:03] should never let this drop. You should
[1:57:05] just keep going. Just keep on moving on.
[1:57:08] Don't get tired. If you feel a little
[1:57:10] slack, just keep moving. Anyhow, just go
[1:57:13] right on anyhow. Believe it. Just keep
[1:57:16] moving right along. Believe in God. And
[1:57:18] now and I'm sure God will bless you. And
[1:57:21] the reason why I say that you have to
[1:57:22] keep moving because our from time to
[1:57:24] time me and my me and my siblings we
[1:57:26] would talk concerning the word. And I
[1:57:28] remember one time my sister said if
[1:57:29] you're doubting that mean your house in
[1:57:31] heaven hasn't even been um constructed.
[1:57:33] Not even a break has been putting down.
[1:57:35] But every single time you believe it's
[1:57:36] like a break is being bu is building
[1:57:37] your house up. So as you keep moving and
[1:57:39] advancing God is putting down your
[1:57:41] break. As you keep saying amen to every
[1:57:43] scripture that's coming on, your house
[1:57:44] in heaven is being built. So keep on
[1:57:46] pressing till the end. God bless you
[1:57:48] all.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:58] Be persistent and vigilant and keep
[1:58:00] pressing.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Tony Allen, you know there is no
[1:58:06] way out.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, my brother.
[1:58:16] Praise God. You're moving very good now.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother. Five minutes.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; I bless y'all tonight.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Let us go to a word of prayer.
[1:58:31] Oh, he already prayed. That's right.
[1:58:32] Okay.
[1:58:34] Get your Bibles. Turn to the book of
[1:58:35] Ephesians,
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; chapter 3,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; verse 20.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; If you got it, say, "Amen."
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 3, verse 20 says, "Not
[1:58:50] unto him that is able
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; to do exceeding
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; abundantly
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; above all that we can ask or think,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; according to the power that workketh in
[1:59:02] us." You may be seated.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Now, it says, "Now unto him that is able
[1:59:08] to do exceeding
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; and abundantly
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; above all that we ask or think."
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; So, I'm reading this scripture and it
[1:59:17] telling me tonight that there is nothing
[1:59:19] big enough.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; There's nothing big enough
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; that I can ask for
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; that God can't exceed it.
[1:59:29] So, and for God to honor that word right
[1:59:32] there, that mean everything you ask for
[1:59:34] in your corner mind that may seem big to
[1:59:38] you, God is telling you, I can always go
[1:59:40] higher. I can always give you more. I
[1:59:44] can always take you further down the
[1:59:46] road.
[1:59:48] And he said he says right here, he said
[1:59:51] it's according to the power that
[1:59:53] workketh in us.
[1:59:55] So that mean whatever you ask for
[1:59:57] tonight,
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; you got power in you
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; to exceed that what come out of your
[2:00:05] mouth.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever your confession that come out
[2:00:11] of your mouth, the power lies within you
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; to go further than that.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Turn let's turn to the book of Kings
[2:00:20] real fast.
[2:00:24] The book of First Kings chapter 19.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 19.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 19.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Lord God.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Yes my brother.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 16.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And this is the story of of of Elijah
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; and Elisha.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And if you look at this God is giving
[2:00:47] Elisha Elijah instructions. He said, he
[2:00:50] says, "And Jahu, the son of Nimsy, shall
[2:00:54] thou anoint to be king over Israel."
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, Elisha the son
[2:00:58] of Shepherd of Amile shall thou anoint
[2:01:01] to be the prophet of of thy room.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; In thy room
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; in thy room. He said, "And it shall come
[2:01:05] to pass that him that escape of the
[2:01:07] sword of Hazel shall Ju slay."
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And him that escape of the sword of Jahu
[2:01:12] shall Elisha slay.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; So God had already told Elijah that
[2:01:16] Elisha was going to take his place.
[2:01:19] Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had already told Elijah this.
[2:01:22] So, I want you to realize this. Elisha
[2:01:25] didn't ask for this anointing.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Elisha did not ask for this anointing.
[2:01:31] This was all God.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; God decided that he was going to get
[2:01:35] Elisha this anointing.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; So, that mean Elisha ain't had no choice
[2:01:39] but to take this anointing. So, he tell
[2:01:42] Elijah to go down and anoint Elisha
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; and and and anoint him that he can take
[2:01:46] his place. Now butter bann said that
[2:01:48] Elisha had a revelation. He already have
[2:01:51] a revelation that he was going to take
[2:01:53] Elijah place. So he began to follow
[2:01:55] Elijah everywhere he went. He began to
[2:01:58] keep his eyes on the prize. So sometime
[2:02:00] that's what you got to do. You got to
[2:02:02] stay focused. You got to stay focused.
[2:02:04] You got to keep your eyes on the word.
[2:02:06] Stay focused on the word. Amen.
[2:02:12] But what but what I want you to get out
[2:02:13] of this is that God ordered Elisha to
[2:02:17] receive a a a portion or not a portion
[2:02:20] but receive the same anointing.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; That Elijah had.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to break that down, I
[2:02:26] call that a single anointing.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I call that a single anointing. But
[2:02:31] Elisha didn't ask for that. Elisha came
[2:02:34] back and say, "I want a double portion
[2:02:37] of that."
[2:02:39] He said, "I want a double portion of
[2:02:40] that."
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; So Elisha was able to go exceedingly and
[2:02:45] abundantly even of what God had intended
[2:02:47] for him.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; It was God. God intended for him to have
[2:02:53] a single anointing. But Elisha was so
[2:02:56] anointed that he surpassed
[2:02:58] what God had for him. He made God change
[2:03:02] his mind and give him a double portion.
[2:03:09] So that's what me and you can do
[2:03:10] tonight. Whatever you need from God
[2:03:12] tonight, even if God got plans in your
[2:03:15] life, you got the ability to go up,
[2:03:18] raise it. You got the ability to take it
[2:03:20] higher. You got the ability to add on to
[2:03:22] what God has for you.
[2:03:26] You got that power on the inside to add
[2:03:28] on to that.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Come over.
[2:03:38] Praise
[2:03:39] God.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I'm sorry. We only do this
[2:03:46] once a year.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; We should have done that maybe many
[2:03:50] time, but let me stay with the prophet
[2:03:52] at the New Year's Eve.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] God will do exceedingly
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; and abundantly above what you can
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; ask or
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; so when you stop God move up.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And Elisha was entitled the anointing.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; But he came he say a double portion.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Move out of my way.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Don't try to block me. I got a race to
[2:04:26] run
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; at the finishing line.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; I will see God face.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Let me ask what the prophet say in this
[2:04:34] word.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And you know, if I need to push, I will
[2:04:38] push
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; because he will do exceedingly and
[2:04:41] abundantly. Right on time.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron,
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; come on up. My brother,
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; you got 30 minutes to finish it all.
[2:04:58] Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; We greet you in the name of the Lord and
[2:05:10] Savior Jesus Christ.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; We were praying to uh for the Lord to to
[2:05:15] you know to have a voice. This is our
[2:05:17] second service for the night.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; So uh
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; If we could stand up on our feet and
[2:05:26] read Psalms chapter 124.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; It's a joy and a privilege to be to be
[2:05:33] to be to be in the house of the Lord and
[2:05:36] to be with you.
[2:05:38] Uh we remember that our my first service
[2:05:41] here was u was a a watch night like this
[2:05:44] one.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And uh many doors opened since that
[2:05:50] service. If you if you have it, you can
[2:05:53] say
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says,
[2:05:59] "If it had not been for the Lord who was
[2:06:01] on our side,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; now may Israel say,
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; If it had not been for the Lord who was
[2:06:10] on our side,
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; When men rose up against us,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; then they had swallowed us quickh,
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; when their wrath was kindled against us,
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Then the streams uh the waters
[2:06:22] overwhelmed us. The stream had gone over
[2:06:24] our soul.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Then the proud waters had gone over the
[2:06:29] soul. Blessed be the Lord.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Who has not given us as prey to their
[2:06:34] teeth.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[2:06:37] snare of the fogers. The snare is
[2:06:40] broken.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; The snare is broken.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; And we are escaped.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add the blessing to the
[2:06:48] reading of his word. You may have your
[2:06:50] seats.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; For a short while this evening, we want
[2:06:54] to talk about uh now may Israel testify.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Each time we we we are given 30
[2:07:05] minutes, we try to preach on the seventh
[2:07:07] seal, but we we won't do that tonight.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; We won't do that tonight. So, as we come
[2:07:14] to the end of the year,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and as we go into a new year,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. You know, no doubt many people
[2:07:20] tonight are in bars, some uh you know,
[2:07:23] shooting fireworks. I I had a business
[2:07:25] meeting in the afternoon and and the
[2:07:27] gentleman says, "I'm going to buy some
[2:07:29] champagne
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; and toast some champagne with with my
[2:07:33] wife and then we'll we'll enter into the
[2:07:35] new year." I said, "I'm going to be in
[2:07:37] church today praising the Lord."
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? I was thinking of
[2:07:42] Psalms chapter 124.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here the Bible is saying that if
[2:07:47] it wasn't for the Lord who was on our
[2:07:50] side,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; And the Bible is saying that now let
[2:07:55] Israel say this.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes, you know, we have
[2:07:58] things upon our hearts. We have things
[2:08:01] in our minds. But it has to come to a
[2:08:03] time where God wants us to express
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; the things that he has done for us. And
[2:08:09] if we look back in 2025,
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; no doubt in your mind, no doubt as I'm
[2:08:14] standing here, some here in this
[2:08:16] building, some of you went to the
[2:08:18] hospitals, some few could have died. But
[2:08:21] you can say as this psalm says, if it
[2:08:24] wasn't for the Lord who was on our side,
[2:08:28] our enemies could have consumed us.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God is saying, you must
[2:08:34] say that.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Now, let Israel say that. If it wasn't
[2:08:39] for the Lord on my side, I could have
[2:08:41] lost my family. I could have lost my
[2:08:44] job. Uh I could have lost my marriage.
[2:08:46] Uh I could have lost my joy. I could
[2:08:49] have lost my salvation. Uh but God was
[2:08:51] on my side. Uh if God is for us, uh who
[2:08:55] can be against us. Uh if God is on my
[2:08:57] side, who can prevail against me?
[2:09:02] Hallelujah. Let the redeemed of the Lord
[2:09:05] say so. Let the redeemed of the Lord say
[2:09:07] so. Let Israel say so.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; It was the Lord on my side. It wasn't my
[2:09:14] strength.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; It wasn't my intelligence. It wasn't my
[2:09:18] hard work. It was the Lord on my side.
[2:09:21] It was the Lord on my side.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the the name of the Lord.
[2:09:30] No doubt some of us here are diabetic.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; And there was a time when the sugar went
[2:09:34] up
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; and you could have died.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; But guess what? The Lord was on your
[2:09:39] side. The Lord was on your side.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. Some of you tonight could
[2:09:45] have lost your home. Some of you tonight
[2:09:48] uh could have lost your life in an
[2:09:49] accident. Uh but the Lord was on our
[2:09:52] side. And we must testify. Uh we must
[2:09:55] praise God. Uh we must thank God. Uh we
[2:09:58] must shout. Uh we must praise. Uh we
[2:10:01] must jump. We must say hallelujah.
[2:10:05] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Uh
[2:10:08] thank you Jesus.
[2:10:11] You say brother Eron you're getting too
[2:10:13] excited. You don't know what I've been
[2:10:14] through. You don't know my story. You
[2:10:17] don't know my situation. You don't know
[2:10:19] my year. You don't know my family. You
[2:10:22] don't know my finances. Uh let me
[2:10:24] rejoice. Let me rejoice. Let me rejoice.
[2:10:29] Hallelujah.
[2:10:31] Hallelujah.
[2:10:33] Hallelujah. His mercy endures forever.
[2:10:37] His mercy endureth forever.
[2:10:41] Woo. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:10:44] Hallelujah.
[2:10:45] Hallelujah. David told his wife, David
[2:10:49] told his wife, "Let me dance unto the
[2:10:52] Lord." I say tonight, let me dance unto
[2:10:56] the Lord.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When David saw the ark
[2:11:02] coming, when David saw the ark coming,
[2:11:05] he couldn't help himself.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; He couldn't help himself. You know, he
[2:11:10] he forgot about his royal robes. He
[2:11:13] forgot about his servants. He began to
[2:11:16] shout and say, "Thank you, God. Thank
[2:11:19] you, Jesus."
[2:11:20] because he saw 2026 coming. He saw the
[2:11:23] Lord coming.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:29] Praise be the name of the Lord. Praise
[2:11:31] be the name of the Lord. If the Lord
[2:11:33] kept you, praise him tonight. Uh if the
[2:11:36] Lord healed you, praise him tonight. If
[2:11:39] God gave you a raise, worship tonight.
[2:11:41] Uh if God kept your house, uh worship.
[2:11:44] Uh if God gave you a wedding, uh
[2:11:47] worship. If God gave you healing,
[2:11:49] worship,
[2:11:52] if it wasn't for the Lord, our enemies
[2:11:55] would have consumed us.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? When we are
[2:12:05] crossing over,
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; a crossover is a bridge.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; A crossover is a bridge.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what a bridge is?
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; It's a bridge.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And you know when whenever you're
[2:12:17] crossing over
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; that's when the enemy comes.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's when the enemy comes.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; That's when the enemy comes. But when
[2:12:27] the enemy comes like a flood,
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; the Lord raises a standard. When the
[2:12:32] enemy comes like a flood, the Lord
[2:12:34] raises a standard. Because at the
[2:12:37] bridge, that's when the book is given to
[2:12:40] the bride. at the bridge.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's when Pharaoh and his horsemen,
[2:12:45] they sing in the Red Sea
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; because the Red Sea was a bridge.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And a bridge is a showdown.
[2:12:55] A bridge is a showdown. And I want to
[2:12:57] say tonight, let's have a showdown.
[2:13:00] Let's have a showdown. Let's have a
[2:13:03] showdown. I don't care what the devil
[2:13:06] says. I don't care what happens. I'm
[2:13:09] staying in the message. I'm staying in
[2:13:11] the message.
[2:13:14] I never chose the message. The message
[2:13:16] chose me. The message chose me.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Some backslid in 2025,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; but you are here tonight.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Why? The Lord was on your side.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord was on your side.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; We are at a junction.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Many accidents happen at a
[2:13:41] junction
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; because you know what at a junction some
[2:13:44] people they go full speedoo
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; they ignore the traffic light.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; They ignore the roundabout
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; but a son of God. When it comes to a
[2:13:55] junction he waits for the traffic light
[2:13:57] and the traffic light is an angel. The
[2:14:01] traffic light is an angel because before
[2:14:03] they cross the Red Sea, there was an
[2:14:05] angel. And the prophet says, "I the Lord
[2:14:08] will send my angel before your face."
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Tonight,
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; no doubt the denominations,
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; they are making resolutions.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's going to be the year of this.
[2:14:23] Oh, it's going to be the year of this.
[2:14:25] Oh, this is going to happen.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; You know what? We don't make
[2:14:28] resolutions. Because we are the sons of
[2:14:31] God.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; And we are now under the third pool.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; And under the third pool,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; we don't make resolutions. We speak the
[2:14:39] word. Whatever you want in 2026, you can
[2:14:44] speak the word. You can stand up like a
[2:14:47] son of God and speak 2026. Whatever you
[2:14:51] need.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; And God says, "Why are you crying unto
[2:14:58] me? Speak the word and go forward.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; It's watch night, my friend.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; So, we have desert. We have desert.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:14.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be lights in
[2:15:18] the firmament of the heavens
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; to divide the day from the night."
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; And let there be for signs and for
[2:15:25] seasons and for days and for years. So
[2:15:28] God made the sun and the moon
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; to demarcate time
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; and to demarcate days
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; and years and seasons. That's right.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; So God is the one
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; that created time.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; And God created time for his own
[2:15:44] purpose.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; So the world will celebrate, oh 2025,
[2:15:49] 2026. But without God, it's meaningless
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; because God is the one that created
[2:15:55] time.
[2:15:57] And he's the one that establishes the
[2:15:59] seasons.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; So you can never begin anything without
[2:16:03] the Lord.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; And you can never finish anything
[2:16:05] without the Lord.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; That's why you finish the year with the
[2:16:08] Lord. You start the year with the Lord
[2:16:11] because he is the alpha and the omega.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and the omega. And
[2:16:16] tonight is the alpha in 2025. And he's
[2:16:18] the omega of 2025.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:25] The devil is playing with the clock.
[2:16:26] He's going too fast.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 20, chapter 6 verse 22.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Now God spoke unto Moses.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, speak unto Aaron.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; And his sons,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; and say to the to them,
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; and bless them in this wise.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Now, this was a commandment.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; That was given to the Levites. Yes,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; by God.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; And God is saying to Moses,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; you must bless, tell Aaron,
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; the Levites, the five-fold ministry,
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; that they must bless the children of
[2:17:04] Israel.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; So, we have a commandment to bless.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; we have an obligation to bless
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; according to the scripture.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "The Lord," and this
[2:17:16] is the the way you shall bless them.
[2:17:19] The Lord bless thee
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; and keep thee.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord make his face to shine upon
[2:17:25] thee
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; and be gracious unto thee.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; And the Lord lift up his countenance
[2:17:31] upon thee
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; and give thee peace.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say tonight in 2026,
[2:17:39] may the Lord bless you. May the Lord
[2:17:42] bless you. May the Lord bless your
[2:17:44] family. May the Lord bless your
[2:17:46] marriage. May he cause his face to shine
[2:17:49] upon you. May he raise his countenance
[2:17:52] to shine upon you.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And they shall put my name
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; upon the children of Israel
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; and I will bless them.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God is saying amen. God
[2:18:11] is saying amen because we're applying
[2:18:13] the word.
[2:18:17] Hallelujah.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Israel was already blessed.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; But God wanted the Levites to say it.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; So, let me say it tonight.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you in 2026. God bless your
[2:18:30] home in 2026. God bless your business in
[2:18:34] 2026. God bless your marriage in the
[2:18:37] name of Jesus. Uh God bless your health
[2:18:40] in the name of Jesus. Uh God bless the
[2:18:42] church in the name of Jesus.
[2:18:46] Hallelujah.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid friends.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid friends.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Aaron,
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; you are you you are going on a tangent."
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; How would you greet each other?
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; There's a code for that.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; That's the code for that. Brother says,
[2:19:09] the nicest thing you can say
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; to a brother is God bless you.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; And allow me this evening to say God
[2:19:18] bless you.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. God bless you.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; May his face shine upon you.
[2:19:31] And Psalms 34 says, "Those who look on
[2:19:34] him,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; they are radiant
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; and they shall never be ashamed."
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; When you look upon him,
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; when you look upon him, you will never
[2:19:43] be ashamed. You'll never be afraid of
[2:19:46] 2026. You'll never be afraid of
[2:19:48] sickness, of bills, of divorce. If you
[2:19:51] look upon him, you are radiant.
[2:19:55] You are radiant.
[2:19:58] The Bible says the men of God,
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; the men of David,
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; the Bible says their faces
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; were like the faces of lions.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Their faces were radiant.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Why they were looking at him?
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. And tonight
[2:20:16] we're looking to him. We are not looking
[2:20:18] at the White House.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at Trump. We are
[2:20:21] looking to him.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to Jesus. I'm looking to
[2:20:25] Jesus. I am looking to the lamb of God.
[2:20:31] Oh, thank you Jesus. I am not looking at
[2:20:34] the economy. I'm looking at Jesus. I'm
[2:20:37] not not looking at a brother. I'm
[2:20:38] looking at Jesus. I'm not looking at my
[2:20:41] bank account. I'm looking at Jesus.
[2:20:46] When Peter was looking at Jesus, he was
[2:20:49] walking on top of the waters. He was
[2:20:52] walking on top of the watershed in 2026.
[2:20:55] Look upon Jesus. Look upon Jesus. Look
[2:20:59] upon Jesus.
[2:21:02] But when he was looking at the
[2:21:04] situation, he began to sink. He began to
[2:21:07] sink. But Jesus reached in mercy when he
[2:21:11] reached down his hand for me.
[2:21:17] Hallelujah. Look at Jesus. Don't look at
[2:21:20] a man. Uh, look at Jesus. Don't look at
[2:21:23] your husband. Look at Jesus. Don't look
[2:21:25] at your wife. Look at Jesus.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; When you look at Jesus,
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; your face changes.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; The face of Stephen changed.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he knew what he was
[2:21:41] talking about. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; he had to put a veil over his face
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; because he had to be with Jesus.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Upon the mountain,
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; the prophet one time was talking to
[2:21:54] Sister
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Mira.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "I met a woman,
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; a little Amish woman.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Her face and her eyes were clear."
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; And I could tell
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; that she was been talking to Jesus.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She had been with Jesus.
[2:22:13] There's something about you when you
[2:22:15] talk to Jesus. There's something about
[2:22:18] you when you look at Jesus.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; But today, the devil want us to look at
[2:22:25] this man. Look at that man. Look at the
[2:22:28] look on the internet. Look on the news.
[2:22:30] Look on the social media. Look on
[2:22:32] Netflix. I am saying looking at Jesus.
[2:22:35] Look away to Jesus. Look away to Jesus.
[2:22:42] The prophet says we don't know
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; what tomorrow holds.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; But we know
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; who holds tomorrow.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know what 2026 holds,
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; but I know who holds
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; 2026.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful?
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; God
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; by your grace has projected to us a
[2:23:13] savior by your love.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; May it send him again tonight in the
[2:23:17] form of the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now let me skip this and go and go and
[2:23:22] go and and go to something.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says this is brother
[2:23:26] Brham's newest message.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; I love this quote
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; and I I might have read this before. He
[2:23:32] says, "Now my text this morning is an
[2:23:35] odd word
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; shalom." Uh-huh.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Shalom in the Hebrew means peace.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what I say to the church this
[2:23:43] morning.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Shalom. That's peace.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; In Finnish is called Ja, which means
[2:23:50] God's peace be with you.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; God's peace. Shalom. The prophet says,
[2:23:55] "My new year's message
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; to the church elected in Jesus Christ
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; for 1964
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; for 2026,
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; not just the church, the religious
[2:24:06] group, but the elect lady,
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; the lady of the church, Christ's bride,
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; whom I'm addressing to
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; and he says, there are two scriptures
[2:24:17] rather, very contrast,
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; one on the other, Isaiah says, arise and
[2:24:21] shine."
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. for your glory has come upon
[2:24:23] you. The light is here.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; And then the next verse he says, gross
[2:24:27] darkness shall be upon the earth.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; So in 2026, gross darkness shall come
[2:24:33] upon the earth
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; but upon the bride. The prophet saying,
[2:24:37] "Peace be with you."
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was giving the blessing
[2:24:42] according to numbers. So, brother
[2:24:44] Brennan was right in the scripture and
[2:24:47] tonight I am in the scripture and I say
[2:24:49] in 2026, peace be with you.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Peace be upon your home. Peace be upon
[2:24:55] your marriage. Peace be upon your
[2:24:57] business. Peace be upon your church in
[2:25:00] 2026.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; So, darkness,
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; is coming upon the earth
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; and gross darkness are coming upon the
[2:25:11] people. Uh-huh.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; But the Bible is saying, "Arise and
[2:25:14] shine."
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; For your light has come.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; And Isaiah says, "Watchmen, what of the
[2:25:20] night?"
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; And he says, "The morning cometh,
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; but not the night also."
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; 20:26, "What of the night?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; The morning cometh,
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; but the night also."
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying, don't be afraid, church.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the news.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Things will get worse.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Politics will get worse.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Wars in the Middle East will get worse.
[2:25:40] The church will become worse.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Many others will backslide.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; But upon the bride,
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; God be with you. God keep you. God shine
[2:25:53] his face upon you.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; May God bless you and keep you.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says just before the
[2:26:05] breaking of the day,
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; there's always one great light. that's
[2:26:09] always pleased in the heavens
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; and that is the morning star.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says when you see the
[2:26:16] morning star getting bright brighter and
[2:26:18] brighter then the earth gets darker and
[2:26:21] darker
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; and that's the reason it is bright is
[2:26:23] because the earth is darker
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; and the church of this last days the
[2:26:28] called elected board of Christ has been
[2:26:30] promised by the Bible that he would give
[2:26:32] them the morning star.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's it. So for 2026, God has given us
[2:26:39] the morning star.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are able to walk in
[2:26:42] darkness because we have the light.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Job chapter 31 verse verse 35. Let's
[2:26:57] read this together. Uh-huh.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Job was saying, "Now,
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; oh that one who would hear me,
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; behold my desires that the Almighty
[2:27:08] would answer me that my adversary had
[2:27:11] written a book."
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; So Job spend a lot of chapters
[2:27:15] complaining.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; All right,
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; and explaining
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; why are all these happen to me?
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; I pay my tithe.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; I feed the poor. I've I've never looked
[2:27:28] my eyes upon a woman. I've never
[2:27:30] abandoned the fatherless. Why is this
[2:27:33] happening to me?
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; And his friends were accusing him.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; And Job spent 30 chapters
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; trying to reason his situation.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; He spent 30 chapters
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; trying to make sense of his situation.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; How can this happen?
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'm a god. I'm a prophet. I'm a wise
[2:27:57] man. The wisest in the east.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Why have I lost everything?
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Why have I lost my health?
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Why have I lost my finances?
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; I've done all these righteous deeds.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; You can read about them the whole
[2:28:12] chapter. He talks about many things.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; I fed the poor. I've never, you know,
[2:28:18] I've paid my workers on time. I've never
[2:28:20] taken anything without paying.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Job was righteous.
[2:28:26] And he was struggling with the wash
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; because you know what we are trained to
[2:28:33] believe
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; that if I'm a son of God this shouldn't
[2:28:37] happen.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; If I be the son of God
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; this shouldn't happen. And that's where
[2:28:43] the devil tricks us
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; because he said to Jesus Christ, "If
[2:28:47] thou be the son of God,
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; turn the stones into bread."
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Because the devil likes to prove sunship
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; by natural substance.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God,
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; why are you still renting?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, why are you
[2:29:10] sick? If thou be the son of God, why are
[2:29:13] you struggling?
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; So Job was negotiating and reasoning.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Why if I be the son of God, why am I
[2:29:25] sick?
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; And you know what?
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; All this time,
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; God was quiet.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; When we when we are arguing and debating
[2:29:35] and exchanging quotations and reasoning,
[2:29:38] God was quiet.
[2:29:41] Because God does not enter into foolish
[2:29:43] arguments.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Because the devil wants you to prove
[2:29:53] that you are a son of God.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; The reason why the devil wants you to
[2:29:58] prove is because he doubts
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; that you are a son of God.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; But I know who I am. I know who I am. I
[2:30:11] have got nothing to prove. I know who I
[2:30:14] am. I know what God has made me. I know
[2:30:17] whom I have believed. I know where I
[2:30:19] come from and I know where I'm going.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; And Job continues and says, "If I have
[2:30:29] eaten fruits thereof without money,
[2:30:31] other words taking without paying.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; If I have caused the owners thereof to
[2:30:35] lose their life,
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; if I have violently taken something from
[2:30:38] someone,
[2:30:41] Let fisttos grow instead of wheat
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; and cocoa instead of barley.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Now here here's the key.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; But the words and the words of Job are
[2:30:53] ended.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; God is waiting for you.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; When you shut your mouth, when you shut
[2:31:03] your mouth, you stand still. When you
[2:31:06] stand still, then you see the salvation
[2:31:09] of the Lord. When you quit stalking, uh
[2:31:12] when you quit gossiping, uh when you
[2:31:14] quit complaining, uh then you see the
[2:31:16] salvation of the Lord.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; May I say this with closing?
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about your situation.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Don't talk about it. Don't think about
[2:31:31] it.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; Stand still.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Stand still. Hallelujah.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes, you know what?
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; We we we we like to take, you know, we
[2:31:39] give God something. We come and take it
[2:31:41] back.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; It's like my daughter, she's 2 years
[2:31:43] old. She she will give me my phone. She
[2:31:46] will take it back. She will give me,
[2:31:47] she'll take it back.
[2:31:49] But God doesn't like that. He will just
[2:31:51] wait
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; and wait
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; and wait and then when we are quiet,
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; when we our when our words are ended,
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; because you know what? Many times we try
[2:32:03] to contend for ourself,
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; We try to fight for ourself
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; because we have rights. We we try to
[2:32:10] explain ourselves
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; sometimes. That's why our homes are
[2:32:14] toxic.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Our marriages fail
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; because we want to explain.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; We want to be understood.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; We want to prove that he's wrong.
[2:32:27] 30 chapters.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Job was trying to explain himself.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something as we get
[2:32:39] into 2026.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Don't explain anything.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't prove anything.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; May the Lord fight for you.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; May the Lord fight your battles. Brother
[2:32:52] Brham
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; was sitting. Dr. Best was arguing with
[2:32:58] Bosworth. Divine healing is this. Divine
[2:33:00] healing is this. Brother Brham was just
[2:33:03] sitting.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was just quiet.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; And because he was quiet, there was a
[2:33:08] host of angels
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; that came down
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; and the pillar of fire came down
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; and says, "Son of God, stand up." You
[2:33:16] know when Job's words ended, the pillar
[2:33:19] of fire came down
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Job, stand up.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; I will speak to you."
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; And may I say tonight, stand up.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; God is going to bless you.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, church.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Praise
[2:33:43] God. The praise God. Praise God. Amen.
[2:33:47] You got everything from the beginning.
[2:33:49] Eight preachers, eternity. Amen.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy?
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Shake somebody's hand and say, "I'm
[2:33:56] still alive."
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; The musician can take their spot.
[2:34:31] Praise God.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; We're not 2026 yet,
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; so chill out. We will enter soon.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The musician can come on, praise
[2:34:45] God, and the deacon can get prepared for
[2:34:47] the Lord's supper.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; God send his word to heal us.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; 2026, my friend, speak the word.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; We need to see God in his whole
[2:35:05] manifestation.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2026, the manifestation of God
[2:35:10] more real in your life. Every way, every
[2:35:13] corner.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see God.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Every single little step, you see God.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. As the deacon,
[2:35:26] get ready. Brother Robert, praise God.
[2:35:30] I'm going to read a quote from Brother
[2:35:31] Brham here. Sister Akos came here with a
[2:35:35] severe headache from the morning
[2:35:38] and now she's completely healed.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; You see what the Lord does?
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; You remember what I told you on Sunday?
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; You can take Tylenol,
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; pray for the Taleno.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; You can go to the hospital, pray for the
[2:35:56] hospital.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; But come to the house of the Lord. His
[2:36:00] presence is there. Brother Brandham say
[2:36:01] his presence brings healing.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; And do you know that the Lord's supper
[2:36:06] brings healing?
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; There is another opportunity for
[2:36:11] healing.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say in the message
[2:36:14] ordination
[2:36:16] it's preached in 1962
[2:36:18] in November the 4th in the evening in
[2:36:21] paragraph 73. Brother Brham say do you
[2:36:24] know that communion has divine healing
[2:36:26] in it? When the Israelite in the type
[2:36:30] took the communion and marched 40 years
[2:36:34] and when they come out of the wilderness
[2:36:36] there was not a feeble one among them
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; two and a half million people sir
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; because of the Lord's supper
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; they took communion they ate the lamb
[2:36:49] the bible brotherham continue he says
[2:36:52] there is power of healing in communion
[2:36:56] everybody is welcome Welcome now. And
[2:36:58] our sister, if she will come to the
[2:37:00] piano, she plays this song. There is a
[2:37:04] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[2:37:06] Emmanuel's van
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; where
[2:37:09] do you see how we synchronize? Did I
[2:37:12] tell you what to sing?
[2:37:15] It came from the coat. Somebody is here.
[2:37:19] Amen. Where sinners plunge beneath the
[2:37:22] flood, lose all their guilty stand, may
[2:37:26] your sins be forgiven. Children, may the
[2:37:29] grace of God ever be with you while we
[2:37:32] are in this journey. May we all meet on
[2:37:35] the other side, happy and young again.
[2:37:39] Amen.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Corinthian chapter 12
[2:37:44] as we change the order of the service. 1
[2:37:47] Corinthian chapter 11 actually. Praise
[2:37:50] God.
[2:37:52] Hallelujah.
[2:37:54] We still have time.
[2:37:56] Amen.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; You will have plenty of time the whole
[2:38:00] day tomorrow
[2:38:02] to send texts,
[2:38:04] messages, posting. I already start
[2:38:07] receiving messages. So if I don't
[2:38:09] respond to you, happy new year, my
[2:38:11] friend.
[2:38:13] Don't get mad because my phone is
[2:38:15] flooded and my number keep going from
[2:38:17] one person to another and brother so and
[2:38:19] so brother so and so give me your number
[2:38:21] but so and so imagine what comes through
[2:38:24] my phone. Amen.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; So happy new year in case I didn't
[2:38:29] answer you
[2:38:31] because he already started. Amen. 1
[2:38:34] Corinthianap 11 verse 20. If you there
[2:38:38] you can say amen. When ye come together
[2:38:41] therefore into one place. We are here in
[2:38:44] one place. This is not to eat the Lord's
[2:38:47] supper. Remember it's not the Lord
[2:38:50] breakfast.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's not the Lord dinner.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the Lord's supper. It have
[2:38:56] to be done in the evening.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Years ago, I went to a church. I saw the
[2:39:01] Lord's supper in the morning
[2:39:04] in the message church.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; Enough of this compromise.
[2:39:10] Amen.
[2:39:12] Verse 21. For in eating everyone taketh
[2:39:16] before other his own supper. In other
[2:39:18] words, everybody already ate at home.
[2:39:21] Amen.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; And one is hungry and another is
[2:39:26] drunken. Before you know it, they start
[2:39:28] eating, drinking, and then somebody's
[2:39:29] drunk in the church. Verse 22. What have
[2:39:34] you not houses to eat and drink in? Or
[2:39:37] despise ye the church of God? So the
[2:39:39] gathering was in the church of God in
[2:39:41] one place. It was the church of God like
[2:39:43] we are tonight. And shame them that have
[2:39:46] not. What shall I say to you? Shall I
[2:39:48] praise you in this? I praise you not.
[2:39:51] For I receive of the Lord that which
[2:39:54] also I delivered unto you, that the Lord
[2:39:58] Jesus the same night, not in the
[2:40:01] morning, in which he was betrayed, took
[2:40:04] bread.
[2:40:05] And when he had given thanks,
[2:40:08] he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This
[2:40:12] is my body which is broken for you. This
[2:40:16] do in remembrance of me." It's a
[2:40:20] commandment. That's the reason why we do
[2:40:22] it. These ordinances we do in them
[2:40:24] because it's the word of God remembering
[2:40:26] the body of Jesus Christ. Verse 25,
[2:40:30] after the same manner also he took the
[2:40:33] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[2:40:36] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[2:40:40] This do you uh this do ye as oft as ye
[2:40:44] drink it in remembrance of me." So we
[2:40:48] remembering the Lord. Verse 26. For as
[2:40:51] often as ye eat this bread and drink
[2:40:53] this cup, ye do show the Lord's death
[2:40:57] until he come. Wherefore, whosoever
[2:41:00] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[2:41:04] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[2:41:07] of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[2:41:10] But let a man examine himself. And we're
[2:41:13] going to give you time. And so let him
[2:41:16] eat of that bread and drink of that cup.
[2:41:19] For he that eateth and drinkketh
[2:41:22] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[2:41:24] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[2:41:28] Lord's body. The Lord's body is the
[2:41:30] believers. For this cause many are weak
[2:41:33] and sickly among you. We don't want
[2:41:35] that. And many sleep. For if we would
[2:41:38] judge oursel, we should not be judged.
[2:41:41] But when we are judged, we are chestnuts
[2:41:44] of the Lord, that we should not be
[2:41:46] condemned with the world. Wherefore, my
[2:41:49] brethren, when ye come together to eat,
[2:41:53] tear one for the other. How do you t one
[2:41:57] for another? Do I sit here waiting for
[2:42:00] you to finish your confession?
[2:42:02] What does he mean?
[2:42:05] Brother Brham says this so we understand
[2:42:07] what that means. In the message
[2:42:09] ordination again in 1962
[2:42:13] brother Brandham say 11:04 in the
[2:42:16] evening in paragraph 64 he say and we
[2:42:20] believe that when we come together he
[2:42:22] said terry one for another
[2:42:26] word wait on one another. The word terry
[2:42:31] means to wait on one another. Now as uh
[2:42:36] now as has been accustomed to us, we
[2:42:39] take the scripture in this way. Brother
[2:42:42] Brandham, now he's going to show you how
[2:42:43] do we wait or t one another. He say that
[2:42:47] when we do this, we just bow our head
[2:42:52] and the congregation prays for we
[2:42:55] pastors.
[2:42:57] I'm I'm interpreting to you so today you
[2:43:00] would know what Terry means. Brother
[2:43:02] Brandham say we bow our heads and the
[2:43:05] congregation prays for we pastors. We
[2:43:09] pastors pray for our congregation. That
[2:43:13] is how we wait on each other.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; By serving each other by praying.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; You pray God forgive my pastor. If there
[2:43:25] is anything in his life that they have
[2:43:27] done you forgive them for it.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Forgive them. They didn't mean to do it.
[2:43:33] And we come right back the pastors
[2:43:35] praying for our congre our congregation.
[2:43:39] God, this is the little flock that you
[2:43:41] give us to watch over. If there is
[2:43:44] anything wrong in their life, take it
[2:43:46] away, Father, so we can all stand
[2:43:49] together around, fellowship around,
[2:43:51] knowing that we are coming here keeping
[2:43:54] the order of God and taking communion. I
[2:43:57] think it's a sweet time of fellowship.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; So telling one another, you all pray for
[2:44:04] me.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I will pray for you.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; So the Lord forgive you and the Lord
[2:44:10] forgive me. Are we together?
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to finish the scripture.
[2:44:14] The Bible say, "Wherefore my brethren,
[2:44:17] when we come together to eat, tar one
[2:44:19] for another." You know what it means
[2:44:21] now? And if any man hunger, let him eat
[2:44:24] a home that he come not together unto
[2:44:27] condemnation, and the rest will last set
[2:44:30] in order when I come. So let's go ahead
[2:44:34] and let's pray for one another as they
[2:44:37] play softly. And then when we finish
[2:44:40] that, we will pray for the bread and we
[2:44:43] will pray for the wine.
[2:44:50] If there is anything, put it under the
[2:44:52] blood. If somebody got you mad before
[2:44:55] coming to church, put it under the
[2:44:57] blood. If you're spies, you have a
[2:45:00] misunderstanding argument because the
[2:45:02] devil usually want to wait before
[2:45:04] church.
[2:45:06] One is lingering in the bathroom taking
[2:45:08] too long.
[2:45:10] Another one is hurrying trying to be on
[2:45:13] time in church and one was upset. Let's
[2:45:17] put it under the blood. Let's approach
[2:45:19] this table for healing. Like Israel,
[2:45:23] taking the bread, entering the new year
[2:45:26] with the bread and the wine inside your
[2:45:29] body. Just like Israel entered the
[2:45:32] Exodus with the bread and the blood.
[2:45:36] They they they ate actually the lamb and
[2:45:39] they walked 40 years and God protected
[2:45:42] them in the during those 40 years. They
[2:45:45] made mistake and everything but God kept
[2:45:47] them strong. May the Lord who did it in
[2:45:51] the first Exodus naturally under the
[2:45:53] natural lamb he can do exceedingly and
[2:45:56] abundantly unto the spiritual lamb of
[2:46:00] God which is correctly the antitap.
[2:46:04] Don't look at one another. Pray.
[2:46:07] Heavenly father
[2:46:09] Lord we are approaching you humbly
[2:46:11] tonight. Father, again thanking you for
[2:46:14] your grace, thanking you for your love,
[2:46:17] thanking you for your mercy and for
[2:46:20] everything you have been doing for us
[2:46:22] from the beginning of this year all the
[2:46:24] way to now. Lord, tonight you have
[2:46:27] spoken to us through various gift that
[2:46:30] you put in the body, eight preachers in
[2:46:33] the row, bringing your word one after
[2:46:36] the other. And father, not only that,
[2:46:39] you are adding again another blessing
[2:46:41] tonight, Lord, to give us the
[2:46:44] opportunity to be able to participate in
[2:46:47] this communion. Lord, communion, your
[2:46:50] prophet told us that it's a showdown. He
[2:46:54] told us that it's our duty to take
[2:46:56] communion. And father, Lord Jesus
[2:46:59] Christ, you have given us a place that
[2:47:01] we can do it. And looking outside at the
[2:47:03] oncoming building, we know that if we
[2:47:06] tar in 2026, we will have a communion
[2:47:09] also in there. But Lord, Father, we are
[2:47:12] approaching you asking you forgiveness
[2:47:15] for everything that we grieve the Holy
[2:47:17] Spirit. Lord, in our word, in our mind,
[2:47:21] in our thinking, in our action,
[2:47:23] reaction, anything that we have done
[2:47:25] that we have forgotten, Lord Jesus
[2:47:28] Christ, may you forgive us, Lord. As we
[2:47:30] waiting Lord Father upon one another
[2:47:33] according to the word of the prophet
[2:47:36] Lord I'm praying for the entire
[2:47:38] congregation
[2:47:39] praying for the musician praying for the
[2:47:42] deacon in their post of duty praying for
[2:47:45] all the officers praying Lord Father for
[2:47:48] the musician here in their post of duty
[2:47:50] asking you as a shepherd as a pastor to
[2:47:53] forgive the congregation father these
[2:47:56] people loves you these people stand for
[2:47:59] your word by the ability you have given
[2:48:02] them. They are always there in the
[2:48:05] service whenever they can. Lord Father,
[2:48:08] Lord Jesus, they came tonight pressing
[2:48:10] on, Lord Father, regardless of what
[2:48:13] happened, they wanted, Lord, Father, to
[2:48:15] cross over into your presence, Lord, so
[2:48:18] that as you met, Lord, the widow woman
[2:48:21] of name, may you meet one another, Lord,
[2:48:23] Father, tonight entering 2026,
[2:48:27] beginning with you, ending, and we want
[2:48:29] to begin again with you, Lord. Father,
[2:48:32] forgive their sins. Forgive their
[2:48:34] iniquity. Forgive their trespasses.
[2:48:37] Forgive everything that they have done,
[2:48:39] Lord. Father, that the devil has brought
[2:48:41] the condemnation to their to their
[2:48:44] heart, Lord. Father, may you wipe it
[2:48:46] again, Lord, Father, by the blood of
[2:48:48] Jesus Christ. And may none tonight,
[2:48:51] Lord, Father, be found outside of the
[2:48:53] blood, but may everybody be found within
[2:48:56] the blood, Lord, and inside and covered
[2:48:59] by the blood, Lord. Father, forgive my
[2:49:01] brother, forgive my sister, forgive our
[2:49:05] children, forgive our elderly. Lord,
[2:49:07] Father, look at us through the Calvary
[2:49:10] to the blood of Calvary, the atonement
[2:49:12] tonight, Lord, Father, and cleanse us
[2:49:15] completely so that when we approach you,
[2:49:18] we're not approaching you with any

[3:11:10] Let's go to the book of John chapter 13.
[3:11:13] So we switch to the feet washing.
[3:11:16] Getting close to 2026.
[3:11:21] Amen.
[3:11:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[3:11:28] Good to see you, brother Captain.
[3:11:32] &gt;&gt; The devil made him fall twice. Fall and
[3:11:35] hit his head and swollen and went to the
[3:11:38] hospital. He's there with everything
[3:11:40] from the hospital. Right.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; God is alive. He still have something to
[3:11:48] do with you.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; John 13:E1.
[3:11:55] Now before the feast of the Passover,
[3:11:58] when Jesus knew that his hour was come,
[3:12:01] that he should depart out of this world
[3:12:04] unto the Father, having loved his own
[3:12:06] which were in the world, he loved them
[3:12:09] unto the end. and supper being ended,
[3:12:13] the devil having having now put into the
[3:12:16] heart of Judas his ciote Simon's son to
[3:12:20] betray him. Jesus knowing that the
[3:12:22] father has given all things into his
[3:12:24] hand and that he was come from God and
[3:12:27] went to God. He rise he he riseth from
[3:12:32] supper and laid aside his garment and
[3:12:35] took a towel and girded himself the
[3:12:38] creator of heaven and earth. After that
[3:12:41] he pour water into a basin and began to
[3:12:44] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[3:12:47] with the tower wherewith he was guarded.
[3:12:50] Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter
[3:12:53] say unto him, Lord, does thou wash my
[3:12:56] feet? Jesus answer and say unto him,
[3:12:58] "What I do, thou knoweth not now, but
[3:13:01] thou shall know hereafter." Peter say
[3:13:04] unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my
[3:13:06] feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash
[3:13:08] thee not, thou has no part with me." So
[3:13:11] it's important to wash feet. Simon Peter
[3:13:14] say unto him, "Lord, not my feet only,
[3:13:16] but also my hand and my head."
[3:13:19] Jesus say unto him, "He that is washed
[3:13:21] needeth not saved to wash his feet, but
[3:13:23] he is clean every wheat, and ye are
[3:13:26] clean, but not all." For he knew who
[3:13:28] should betray him? Therefore he say, Ye
[3:13:31] are not all clean. So after he had
[3:13:33] washed their feet, he had taken his
[3:13:35] garment and was set down again. He said
[3:13:38] unto them, "Know ye what I have done to
[3:13:41] you? Ye call me master and lord, and ye
[3:13:44] say well for I am. If I then, your Lord
[3:13:48] and Master, have washed your feet, ye
[3:13:51] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[3:13:55] That's the reason why we do it. For I
[3:13:57] have given you an example that he should
[3:13:59] do as I have done to you. Verily,
[3:14:03] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[3:14:05] no greater than his Lord, neither
[3:14:07] neither he that is sent greater than he
[3:14:10] that that sent him. If ye know these
[3:14:13] things,
[3:14:15] sad are ye.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; Happy are ye
[3:14:20] if ye do them. So if you do it is a
[3:14:25] promise
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; for God to make you happy.
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; So the sister will stay right here in
[3:14:30] the sanctuary and the brother will go
[3:14:32] right there. But believe me, next year
[3:14:35] the brother will go over there
[3:14:38] &gt;&gt; if time.
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's move quickly and get
[3:14:42] there and get to business so we can read
[3:14:45] to you what we need to read for 2026
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; because we're getting pretty close.
[3:19:27] That's good.

[3:42:32] strange. We not know what we went
[3:42:34] through.
[3:42:36] Let's praise the Lord for another year
[3:42:49] where we thought
[3:42:56] we thought that our marriages will be
[3:42:59] broken and here you still married.

[3:43:49] &gt;&gt; You can push.
[3:43:51] &gt;&gt; Our God is

[3:43:56] Oh, I'm going to get Mr. What do you
[3:43:58] call it?
[3:44:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me read the scripture first
[3:44:03] &gt;&gt; before we start with celebrating and
[3:44:05] dancing.
[3:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:44:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't dance, that's your problem.
[3:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:44:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from the book of Psalm
[3:44:13] chapter 115. The book of Psalm chapter
[3:44:17] 115. We're going to read few verses and
[3:44:21] I want you to take it home with you.
[3:44:25] Yesterday we you remember praise the
[3:44:27] Lord. Why? For his mercy endures
[3:44:31] forever. So we got to praise him for his
[3:44:33] mercy endureth forever. The God that
[3:44:37] protected us. For his mercy endures
[3:44:40] forever. The Lord that bless us.
[3:44:43] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endure forever.
[3:44:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. It's starting pretty good.
[3:44:51] It's Psalm 115. Verse n
[3:44:56] &gt;&gt; few verses the Bible say, "Oh Israel,
[3:45:00] &gt;&gt; trust thy in the Lord.
[3:45:03] &gt;&gt; He is their help and their shield."
[3:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:07] &gt;&gt; God is your help and he's also your
[3:45:10] shield.
[3:45:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:45:11] &gt;&gt; Oh house of Aaron, trust in the Lord. He
[3:45:15] is their help and their shield.
[3:45:19] &gt;&gt; Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the
[3:45:21] Lord. He is their help and their shield.
[3:45:26] &gt;&gt; The Lord has been mindful of us.
[3:45:30] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[3:45:32] &gt;&gt; The Lord. Ah, thank you. The Lord has
[3:45:36] been mindful of us.
[3:45:38] &gt;&gt; He will bless us.
[3:45:41] &gt;&gt; He will bless the house of Israel.
[3:45:44] &gt;&gt; He will bless the house of Aaron.
[3:45:46] He will bless them that feel the Lord
[3:45:49] both small and great.
[3:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:54] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall increase you more and
[3:45:57] more.
[3:46:00] &gt;&gt; You and your children.
[3:46:04] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again.
[3:46:06] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't have children, your
[3:46:08] children are already there. The Lord
[3:46:11] will bless you more and more. The Lord
[3:46:15] shall increase you more and more. Who?
[3:46:19] &gt;&gt; You and who?
[3:46:20] &gt;&gt; Your children.
[3:46:22] &gt;&gt; Ye are bless of the Lord which made
[3:46:24] heaven and earth.
[3:46:25] &gt;&gt; The heaven even the heavens are who?
[3:46:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[3:46:29] &gt;&gt; But
[3:46:31] &gt;&gt; the earth
[3:46:33] &gt;&gt; has he given to who?
[3:46:36] &gt;&gt; So this is our property right here.
[3:46:39] And the title of redemption already came
[3:46:42] in Revelation 10.
[3:46:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible say the dead praise not the
[3:46:48] Lord.
[3:46:49] &gt;&gt; Neither any that go down into water.
[3:46:53] &gt;&gt; Do we have dead people here?
[3:46:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible say the dead do not praise the
[3:46:58] Lord.
[3:46:59] &gt;&gt; Either anyone that go down how?
[3:47:03] But
[3:47:04] &gt;&gt; but
[3:47:05] &gt;&gt; not the dead, but
[3:47:07] &gt;&gt; we who are alive,
[3:47:09] &gt;&gt; we will bless the Lord when
[3:47:14] &gt;&gt; and forever more. What do we do?
[3:47:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[3:47:22] &gt;&gt; Happy new year. May God bless you
[3:47:26] because our God has been tremendous.
[3:47:35] Uh-huh.

[3:47:40] and he hears me. Yes, he helps me. He is
[3:47:45] faithful
