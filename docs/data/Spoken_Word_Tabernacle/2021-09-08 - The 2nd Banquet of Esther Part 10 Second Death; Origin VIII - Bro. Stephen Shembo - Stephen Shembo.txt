gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together with one heart and one mind and one accord to be able to offer unto you songs of worship and praise as they come from our heart we lower lord that judgment is striking america we see the plagues we see the famines we see the earthquakes we see the fires we see the floods with the tornadoes and hurricanes but lord you promised before the worst strikes lord you're going to take your bride home and lord to me these are the signs of the time it's time for the bride to make herself ready and to leave and lord that's the purpose we gather so the lord we considered your feet and received from you the word you would have for us this evening the lord you might encourage our hearts and we might be able to grab hold of the word of god that you've given to us that we might begin to believe who we are and what we are and what you called us to be in this hour so take us lord this evening and our needs that have been spoken lord we there's many things because of the plagues which are striking the world and but lord you're the you are our healer you are our savior you are our deliverer and lord it's in you we put our trust in all of these things so be with us lord in this service unlike the one who's going to minister your word and lord may it strike our hearts and may help us just to draw ever closer into you for lord i ask us in the wonderful and precious name of our lord jesus christ amen you all may be seated as they gather the offering and uh i believe sister of course has a song for us this evening she can make her way and then after her we have brother angelo as well has a song god bless you yeah i really want to thank god for my life um god has been a blessing unto me i've been on dialysis for the past 12 years and it's been god's grace i've been back and forth going to the hospital and with this whole covet god has kept me and i want to thank god for what he's done for me amen

at us and tells us that we're not enough and we're not good enough for god's grace but the bridge of the song says if he dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor how much more does he clothe you and if he watches over every sparrow how much more does he love you song is just a reminder that god loves you and he chose you and picked you out of the many [Music] i'll never be more loved than i

you all in the name of jesus christ it's good to see the tribe back in order if you don't know what it means you need to study the message a little bit amen we were on labor day weekend a lot of folks travel now they're back so that's why i say they travel back in order amen god bless you brother noah good to see you and your wife god richly richly bless you i was not aware that you were around i should not be even standing here when a veteran is right there so as a veteran show all the respect and the honor god richly bless you and he really means a lot for us normally you should be here ministering and me sitting there so lord's willing maybe but greg i put the blame on you if you knew this before i put the blame on you amen you should have told me i would have passed the ball pretty easy these are veteran and we honor them they work a lot for the kingdom of god and it's good to see you here lord is willing maybe next time if the lord terry you will be ministering for us amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen let's go to genesis chapter 15 when i saw you back there i said wait a minute this look like brother that's probably noah [Laughter] amen everybody on board with the sermon nobody behind right okay blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let's go to genesis chapter 15. this origin keep unfolding and i don't know what to do but to follow the holy ghost amen if we finish here then we get in the resurrection then the second death is clear but now we know that those that are in the broad we're not subject to the second death amen so we go and climb back up again into eternity hallelujah genesis chapter 15 verse one i hope we can lay a strong foundation so sunday will be easy after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am your shield and your exceeding great reward amen you might be seated god is talking to abraham here verse 2 and abraham say lord god what will you give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus in other words abraham is abraham is telling god that i don't have a child but to the way things are portraying i believe the air of my house is going to be a liaison of damascus so he was using his brain amen trying to pinpoint who is going to be the heir of everything in other words god i don't have a child all i can see is this man here he's a good man honorable man in my house so probably he might end up being the heir amen verse 3 and abram said behold to me you have not give you have given no seed and no one born in my house is my heir eliezer of damascus who told you that abraham verse 4 and behold the word of the lord came to him saying okay now it's not abraham talking we like that this shall not be your heir that's not it but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir so we know where isaac was right okay verse 5 and he brought him forth abroad and say look now toward what abraham was looking about the things that were on the earth when he looked on the earth he saw eleazar he didn't understand that as a seed was already in him amen so god started and tell him that within yourself there is a seed on the earth within abraham remember liver was there also he paid tithe unto melchizedek in the earth you have isaac laying there as a seed in your lungs everybody clear but god is bringing abraham back up into heaven amen in other words the story really abraham doesn't start on the earth if you want to understand the real story you need to go back up there that's where the origins start amen [Laughter] hallelujah and he brought him fourth out look now toward heaven come on and tell the stars do you remember you remember the stars of god you remember them and the great and morning star so he's bringing abraham back to the star he said let's go up there abraham amen if you want to know your true descent go back up there don't be looking at circumstances here amen tell the stars if you be able to number them and he said to him so shall your let me go back here ben look now toward the heavens everybody sees that you need your bible come on and tell though how many stars plural everybody clear so the stars are plural amen stars are plural so if god says your seed shall be like that if stars are plural so seed need to be plural but let's see if seed is plural amen and tell the stars if you'll be able to number them many stars and he said to him so shall you're singular you look in many stars but all the stars are packed into one seed you remember that you remember that so all these stars that are plural are truly represented in a one seed singular seed this is the way you read your bible amen and all these stars are numbered in one seed and he said to him so shall your seed be we know who is that singular seed right you know that already who is it so if you look here god is talking about isaac amen abraham you're going to have a child that child is going to come out of your bowel everybody knows it's isaac god take him from here all the way to the heaven and god show him you see who he saw so paul when he said seed singular means christ paul knew what he was talking about amen so on the earth it seems like it's isaac but surely it is let's go to matthew chapter 18 hallelujah matthew chapter 18. so the earth isaac the heaven crushed amen and these children are stars we know lucifer want to rise himself above the stars of god amen praise god matthew chapter 18 verse 5 if you dare you can say amen and who so shall receive one such a leader chad in my name receive me that child must be in his name you got amen verse six and who so shall offend one of these little ones not only just little ones watch leave the one which what makes sense clear when i say make sense i'm not calling your brain i'm calling your heart because brother branham said we understand with the heart sometimes when we say make sense people think we're talking about the brain none but clear in other words is it clear amen but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me so that little ones believe in him amen he wear better for him that a milestone were hanged about his neck and that he were joined in the depths of the sea everybody cleared so far job two verse 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones we understand them now for i say unto you that in not here in what in heaven there so when you look at a human being when you look at a human on earth on earth you're gonna see him as a human but in heaven there is someone called his angel oh hair angel anybody clear are you clear that in heaven they're angels because there are many do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven we know who that angel is right one more then we're gonna pray let's go to act chapter 12. on the earth look like isaac if you go through isaac the descendant of isaac persecuted christ so who was the true seed amen but in heaven christ on the earth human in a in heaven they are peace species beings called angels amen acts chapter 12 verse 11 and when peter was come to himself the angel of the lord delivered him from prison he said now i know of surety that the lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews they want to get him killed and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying and as peter knocked at the door at the gate of the gate a damsel came to hurricane named rhoda and when she knew peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness even forget about it but ran in and told her peter stood before the gate and they said to her you are mad you are insane but she constantly affirmed that it was even so so then say day it is his in other words peter is already dead so what you see it's the angel of peter that looked like peter and sounds like peter hey but here so peter here in heaven there is an angel that looked like peter acted like peter sound even like peter until you look at that angel you thought this is peter everybody here let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed world of the hour lord i have done what every man that you have given a grace and an ability to do can do but when it comes to interpret and to preach to speak to teach your children it only takes the holy spirit father that's why i'm humbling myself expressing lord father that we all depend from thee and i'm asking that you move me completely out of the way may you come and minister to your children may you be the alpha and the omega of this service as we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you if you would turn with me straight to genesis chapter 25 and keep your bibles there genesis chapter 25 and when you're there you can keep your bible right there because we will come back to that scripture as we will be clamping genesis chapter 25 you there you can say amen then we go we are dealing again with the origin part eight second feast of king uh the second banquet of esther everybody clear on when on sunday we demonstrated to you that the other part there is two kingdom one kingdom is the kingdom of god and the other kingdom is the kingdom of the devil we know by gene there is no connection between the kingdom of the devil and the kingdom of god and the kingdom of god everybody there is eternal as god himself is eternal in the kingdom of the devil brother branham say the devil is not eternal amen he has a beginning and therefore he's going to have an end therefore then we will talk about the lake of fire which is the second death so on the right side it is eternal beings coming from the laws of god and on the left side it is a temporal being coming from the creation of god at the in the beginning everybody clear brother branham said that after he has provided a way for people and then they refuse it now the reason they refuse it is because there is nothing in there to receive it amen so some people will receive the gospel we already demonstrated that to you and some will not receive the gospel amen and the reason why they receive the gospel look at their origin and if they don't receive it look at the origin amen brother branham said the reason they refuse it is because there is nothing in there to receive it there is no absorbent there is no receiver to receive the word there is nothing to receive it my mother used to say you cannot get blood from a turnip because they turn up have no blood because there is no blood in a turnip so if there is no form of life in there which is the predestinated seed to receive it then it cannot be received that is the reason the pharisee could look right in the face of jesus and call him beelzebub because there was nothing in them to receive him but all the father have given me he said will come to me there is some way it's going to be presented you can talk to people sometime on the street talk to them about the lord they laugh right in your face well we are supposed to do that anyway in other words whether they receive the gospel or not it is our responsibility to preach the gospel everybody clear for one it's going to be salvation and for the other one it's going to be for judgment but clear there is no one can come to me except my father chose him first god has to do the drawing there has to be a life and all that he has given me will come on to me aren't you glad tonight that you have that paul that tag that we spoke about on sunday where you can feel god attracting you and something in you responding to god regardless of where you come from what your mind is thinking what mama was what daddy was no matter what kind of family you came out of there that have nothing to do with you because brother branham said i brag more on my second birth than my first birth because the second birth tells you exactly where you came from everybody clear so far brother branham said but let me try to justify that tonight the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord sometimes he makes us do things very contrary to what we think that's why we don't lean on our own understanding but we are always if we are following the leading of the spirit we are always in his will because it's the spirit of god leading you god does what he wants to he raised pharaoh up for the same purpose and called say he loved jacob and he hated esau before they was even born ever born now god's purpose must be fulfilled can the powder he didn't finish the clay said to the porter as we found in romans 8 9 and paul said in ii timothy chapter 2 verse 13 if we believe not yet he a bad faithful so he has nothing to do with you even when you are faithless even when you are down god is determined he will not lose none of his children god will do everything that he can and make sure the predestinated seed are saved everybody clear even if we believe not yet he a bad faithful he cannot deny himself if you're a child of god god will never deny you if he denies you he denies himself and god cannot reject his own because we are as eternal as god is eternal everybody clear so far we're depending on him not on our own when we spoke and we entered the book of jude we found out that when israel came out of egypt god saved some of them and then destroy a part of it amen then on first six because we already explained that one on first six po uh jude says this that the angel which kept not the first estate in verse 5 jude was talking about israel naturally speaking jude said if you look at the story of israel israel came out of egypt when israel came out of egypt there was a group that was saved and another group was destroyed everybody clear but now jude continued on verse six he leave the earth you okay now then jude goes back up again into heaven everybody clear into the realm of the angel everybody clear so far when brother branham preached this uh the seven church ages brother branham showed to us what happened in the natural hymn what branham said there was a message that came by the name of luther by the name of wesley by the name of columba and brother branham give you the plan outlet uh the plan layout of the seven church ages what happened in them which city was there and everything together amen and people were behaving a certain way throughout the seven church ages but when the sales broke and back here the seals now shows you the same information but in a different level everybody here the churches show you what happened naturally in the natural realm in a political realm and you just see somebody moving from point a to z but they still show you the spirit behind it the anointing behind it what is actually causing the natural to move a certain way about here and to understand the natural you need to go back to the spiritual first because there is a reason why somebody is behaving one way and somebody else is behaving another way when they are faced with the same thing but here when people face eternal life some people respond a certain way and some other people respond a different way based on what happened up there everybody here so in the 5 jude was talking about the earthly then on verse 7 of 6 jude moved from the earthly he begin to go back up like okay let's go back up there and see what really happened over there we see israel some destroy some saved why are they destroyed why saved which point to you we showed to you paul said it was because of a lack of faith amen because there were children in whom there was no faith remember deuteronomy now jude said let's leave the earth let's go back up there let's see what happened over there everybody here jude says that the angel which kept not their first estate everybody they had a position just like lucifer had a throne but for some reason this angel could not continue all the way remember brother branham said the proof that you are baptized with the holy spirit you must stay in the world all the way not like judah who started and then drifted down the road if you study if you're an alpha you must be an omega you cannot be alpha and shop in the middle of the road it shows where you come from he said the angels which kept not their first estate they had a position but left their own habitation you remember on sunday judah left his own habitation and left their own habitation he reserved in everlasting chance in other words he put them in prison souls in prison under darkness unto the judgment of the great day we already know that that judgment which is the judgment of the white great uh the white throne everybody clear now brother branham interpret this scripture he says angels which one stay in heaven remember ebiado he stay with david but because of his lineage he have to leave david to fulfill the prophecy that was given to the house of healer amen he said the angel which was spain heaven they were working for god and kept not their estate why why somebody kept and the other one could not and the way that they were in fell away and now is in eternal change of darkness everlasting chance of darkness kept in this condition in prison until the judgment of the great day when they shall be judged with the rest of the unbelievers so this angel brother branham connect them with the unbelievers anybody clear what's going on brother branham we told you that there is two kingdoms the kingdom of god eternal and the kingdom of of the devil which is temporal now jude according to verse 6 he says that the same thing that happened in the natural with israel that some people were saved another were destroyed he says the same thing happened also in the angelic realms in other words election happened on the angelic realms first hallelujah revelation chapter 12 the bible says there was war in heaven if everybody that was in heaven was a child of god why did we have war god was fighting god there were two kingdoms anybody clear so if it's war somebody is for god and somebody is against god about clear now but the bible says there was war in heaven michael and his angel so there were a group of angels that cling to michael and brother branham said my care was christ we clear micah and his angel fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels so right here we can see that they are group of angels we talking about engines they are a group of angels that are connected to michael everybody and there is a group of angels that are connected to lucifer not only do we have children of the devil we also have angelic beings that belongs to the devil hallelujah and prevail not neither was there so they had a place in heaven they had an estate in heaven they had their habitation in heaven they had a position in heaven but the problem is they could not keep that anybody clear they can start with the message but they're not going to hold on all the way to the end everybody here neither was their place found they had a place but they lost it judah had a ministry remember but he lost the holy ghost giving ministry to go into his own place why did judah lost and the other never lost it father those that you gave me i lost none of them except the son of anybody clear neither was the place found anymore in and the great dragon was cast out that old not a new serpent the new serpent is the one that ramp the old one was a beast so the beast was the the old serpent called her the devil we know therefore what he means already and satan amen accuser and opposition amen which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the and his angels were cast out with him that's why brother branham said in the battle uh the greatest brother ever thought he said the battle the first fight who started over there then the battle from angel drop down and become human battles so before it becomes human battle he must start first over there where are you taking me so we can see here that we have two kingdoms michael has his angels and lucifer has his angel in other words election also is applied in the angelic realms first timothy chapter 5 verse 21 paul says i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the water why did paul say the elect angels amen so even in the angelic realm there are angels that are elected and there are some that are not elected [Applause] [Music] we clear blessed be the name of the lord that that observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by personality what i'm trying to drive here is the election that you see in the natural started back up there we're clear now the bible says this in matthew 25 he said then shall he say also to them on the left you know who's on the right you already know who's on the left okay then shall he say to them that on the left those that are as goats depart from me ye curse into everlasting prepare for the sinners prepare for the devil and water my question comes this fire everlasting which brother branham explained to us that it's hell anybody clear he was prepared or predestinated for who for the devil and who his angels anybody clear but the bible says that those on the left those on the left are human beings you remember you remember if hell was prepared for the devil and his angel why is our human being entering hell we clear my question is the bible says that everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angel he didn't say human why you men are going to hell that's my question amen technically speaking you should have only the devil and his angel period why do we have human going to hell anybody clear brother branham said in the exposition of the seven church ages brother branham say as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes with a superficial understanding everybody clear now buckle up as we're going take roman chapter 9. sorry we're going to come back to genesis sooner we are not in human realms we are in angelic realms take roman chapter 9 very familiar scripture if you're there you can say amen our origin paul says this i say the truth verse 9 in christ i lie not paul is saying the truth my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost are we clear are you still looking for it are you there amen that i have great heaviness and continuous sorrow in my heart paul why are you sorry what's going on verse 3 for i could wish that myself were a curse you can see a true pastor of the age like moses before you destroy israel destroy me i rather me being cursed let the other pass true heart amen a true father i wish that myself were a curse from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the water paul here is relating to israel natural we okay paulie starting roman 9 but in roman 9 paul is talking about the natural israelite the jew the man oh we know already that paul told us that not all israel is israel not everybody that is jew is a child of god so paul is studying that i am a jew from the chapel from the tribe of benjamin and i have great sorrow for my people which people the jews on the flesh verse 4 who are israelite do you see gentiles there no to whom pretend the adoption and the glory and the covenant and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises anybody clear all of this did not belong to you naturally speaking it belongs to israel whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh paul is talking about the natural man as concerning the flesh crust came who is overall god bless forever if you have a problem with deity jesus is god right there is god bless forever amen amen now paul goes not as though the word of god has taken non-effect paul is saying all the promises all the glory all the law all the services of god were first given to the jew and it seems like israel fell and when they fail you might have an idea like god words fail paul said that's not the case it looks like god fell he says no he said for they are not are israel which are of israel now paul begin to move from the natural you see now paul begin to go in a different realm of israel at the beginning it was the country of israel it was the people that were born from the laws of abraham now paul begin to make a distinction like even though they are born from abraham not all of them are truly israel so now we see there is to israel there is a natural israel and there is now a spiritual israel paul now begins to take you from the earth he's going back up with you everybody clear verse seven neither because they are water the seed of who the descendant of abraham the offering of abraham are there or in other words if someone is born as a jew paul says it doesn't mean they are a child of god because at the beginning israel were the people of god when we look at the jew they are the people of god paul said that is not the case ever here even though the promises were given to them yet there is an election the problem is election where is your origin you can be born a jew but you are not a child of god and we might be gentle yet we are more jews than the jew themself the jew is the one in ward that's what paul said he says circumcision is not of the flesh but of the water that's why malachi 4 came to turn there are we okay verse 7 neither because they are seed of abraham or they are children but this is the problem in who shall your singular remember here remember that seed when they say isaac we have a tendency to look at the jew paul is pulling you back again i'm not talking about this i'm talking about this one you did isaac shall your seed be called the seed will be called let's continue verse eight that is paul is explaining himself they which are the children of the flesh what have what you call the jews today with the idea of a jew with a blood of a jew those they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the water the promise are content for water so the child of the true child of god is a child of promise a true child of god is a child of promise which promise which promise abraham you're going to have a child is that a promise if that is the case we need to go back to israel and be converted to judaism and barclay what does it mean blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says this in israel in the church the children of the promise promise what what kind of a promise i love the message that god promised before the water brother branham said that promise is not something that started here it is something that starts way up there because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world anybody here he told them that is the water so the seed started before the natural not because you quit doing this and quit doing that and quit lying and quit selling that is just moral act a good citizen will do that you can't call yourself a christian yet until something in here has happened until you are regenerated until you lose your natural breath anybody clear something that is happening in here so the promise here brother branham is connecting that before the foundation of the world and brother branham said that promise is the what is the seed and the seed is who romans 4 verse 16 the bible said therefore it is of what faith that it might be by by grace to the end duh you see the promise to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed because god knew that his children are scattered some of them discarded them in america some of them he scattered them in europe some are scattered in africa some are scattered among the jews amen and if god would corner his promise to the nation of israel only those that were not born jews were locked so god took that promise and put it in christ and jesus was neither a jew who was the father of jesus which blood was in the vein of jesus which dna he was a created cell which blood was it jesus was not a jew jesus was not a gentile he just chose to look like a jew but his blood was the blood of god almighty himself so the promise was not placed on a jew the promise was not placed on the gender the promise was placed in christ so that all the children whether they are jew or gender god can recuperate them god can redeem them back to him those are the true children of god blessed be the name of the lord that's the promise might be sure to all the seed not to own not to that only which is of the law the jew but to that also which is of the of abraham the gentile who is the father of who did can you trust abraham and see him on your genealogy you won't see it abraham was a pugil how is abraham your father abraham is your father by the faith america brother branham in in galatians chapter 3 the bible say for ye are all the children of god by what by faith in who for as many of you as have been baptized into who the seed have put on who there is neither it's dissolved no dissolve there is neither dissolve nor there is neither no deserve for year or in who in christ jesus watch now and if he be christ in other words if you belong to christ if christ is your lord your honor ownership if ye be christ then you are abraham's seed and hair according to the water so that promises in christ brother branham says this then he goes on to not only narrow down this his definition but rather to finalize it for in galatian 3 he identified the seed singular with who encountered the seed children as the children of the of promise and promise as having to do with what with the election or the choosing of what so that promise means election and chosen by god before the foundation of the world it has nothing to do with your birth it is what started there anybody clear brother branham say that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elects of god are the predestinated for known of god and where in the mind of god and in his thoughts in very plain language the true bread of grass was in the mind of god eternally do not express until each came forth in the designated decree or season where are we taking us amen let's go to genesis 26 yep we good the seed paul says it's no more natural let's go back to the spiritual it's not isaac it is christ amen it is not peter look at the angel don't offend them the angels are there amen let's go to genesis 26 now if you dare you can holler amen amen hallelujah we are talking about the angels that left their first state amen lucifer has his angel michael has his angel hell was prepared for the devil and his angel why human being in hell were you ready genesis chapter 26 verse 20 25 verse 20. i'm sorry genesis 25 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen and isaac was 40 years old when he took rebecca as a wife the daughter of bethel the syrian of pentagram the sister to lebanon the syrian i love the bible you ready all right put your seat back and isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intrigued of him now the word the lord answered and rebecca his wife conceived about here and their children struggle together inside her and she said if it be so why am i dust and she went to inquire of the lord to ask god why is this pregnancy i feel like these two folks are fighting are we clear we're looking at naturally remember we are there verse 23 and the lord said to her this is the interpretation to nation was isaac a bad man was rebecca batman isaac was the son of the promise god himself came down in genesis 18 and gave the promise rebecca was the chosen brad by eliezer and the angel of the lord pure 100 pure 100 but when the pregnancy came to seed amen in the garden of eden it's different let me go and the lord said to her two nations two kingdoms are in your womb and two manor of water not only is it two nations but these nations are not really twins they have two different characters one from another yet coming from the same womb watch out church shall be separated from your bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve their younger let's put a pause there and now get into where i'm going paul continue remember in roman we stop at nine right now to save you from moving back forth you stay right there let's look at roman nun now not verse 9 but verse 10. we clear because verse 9 he was dealing with isaac the promised and that promise said we know that it's christ now we're clear on that one now paul continues paul says and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father who i'm going to read it again not only this but when rebecca also has conceived by one do you see something there did you catch it did you catch something there did you catch it did you see that that is the way the bible is written there is a written part of the bible and there is an unwritten part of the bible that lays between the line you see that you see that brother branham said there are 12 constellations amen he started from leo from uh from vigo all the way to leo but if you enter into the zodiac you're gonna find out that there are more than 12 constellation you remember when i thought that but you're gonna see that some constellation lays within the major constellation so for you to see that constellation you must first go to the first constellation and when you enter that constellation then you're gonna find another constellation under that constellation what are you trying to say abraham was old stricken with age sarah was old when god came and said sarah is gonna have a child sarah was so old that she's laughed she said this man is enjoying my food do you think really i'm gonna have pleasure with abraham that's what you read marriage and divorce is locked there then the bible continues that when abraham journey to where abby malek was what happened abimelech looked at sarah and lasted after her how can you last on the grammar [Music] you see what i'm saying over here or over here somebody's looking at her beautiful everybody here if you read like that you won't understand that's why you need the message of the hour everybody here so when the seals are broken you can see what was laying inside the scripture the thunder that were hidden in the scripture so now we begin to understand that something happened to sarah sarah became young again that's why a king can look at sarah and see her beautiful it is a scripture within a scripture anybody clear the first scripture everybody can read it the second one it takes a divine inspiration from god that's why to follow this message you need the holy ghost with that the holy ghost is going to be a bunch of intellectual anybody here let's go back then rebecca also had conceived by what why god have to say by one what do you see there preacher you ready let me help you up in luke chapter 3 38 the bible says which is the son of innocent comer which is the son of said come on which was the son of who which was the son of who so adam was a son of god not the son of the devil genesis 4 verse 1 and adam you see the color adam knew eve did you see the serpent there adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear who if you read right here the father of cain is who you see now and she again bear his brother who and aber was a keeper of the ship but ken was a killer of the ground so based on the scripture it seems like cain and i and abel both of them came from adam john the ego let me know in first john chapter 3 verse 12 not as caring who was of that word stop who was the father of ken here but adam was the son of god amen so adam became a wicked one adam is a wicked one he is a son of god so ken came from the wicked one who was the adult serpent the devil in other words if gay were conceived by two you okay now and then rebecca conceived by what the serpentine was hidden already you look the serpent seed is here i don't see it brother brother it's here i don't see it brother brother it's here i don't see it but it's right there in the garden of eden it becomes easy for us because it's natural we can check the dna of ken if we take it to the laboratory we look we're going to see that ken was not from adam and we took the dna of evil we can trace that king that evil came from adam but that is not the case of [Music] rebecca we okay now in rebecca case if you take his soul he came from isaac you take jacob he came from isaac that's why paul begin to tell you don't look at the flesh of israel the problem is not at the fresh the problem is on the other dimension you understand now oh my god paul said for the children being wiper so where is the dna we're on the angelic rims the children being not yet born neither having done any work how are you gonna tell which one is good they have not done something wrong that's the what the purpose of god according to what [Music] according to election mustang not of works he's so qualified on that one but of him that do what remember he was said unto her the elder shall save the younger as it is written jacob ever but he saw heaven what what have is so done the garden of eden easy the serpent pom-pom came he saw you check him naturally good yet god say i hate him so the problem is not here the problem is there anybody clear brother branham say in verse 11 the spirit bodily wow calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to water my stand election only have nothing to do with you not of works but of him that calleth this love is elective love election even in the angelic beings elective love it is his love for his water and his love for them is apart from water you have nothing to do the pharisee brother branham said they have the fruit of the spirit ten times more than jesus and jesus look at them he said you are of your father the people [Music] thank god for election thank god because he chose me before the foundation of the world amen when i was yet sinner christ died for me when i was smoking when i was drinking when i was a prostitute somebody calmed the crush for me and he paid the price for me and he prayed the price of my apartment his name is jesus you need to serve him not for fear of hell not for fear of the second death but for love because he first loved me [Applause] if it's for fear of hell you're a legalist amen if you're afraid of hell that means if god remove hell you're not going to serve him you are serving him because you're afraid of hell that's why brother branham said even though he sent me to hell i will be happy to go to hell are you there because his choice is perfect the devil has been playing with you too much amen the devil has been praying for you too much that's that was therefore there is no more hallelujah his love is apart from human merit for he says that the purpose of who of god standing water not your purpose you the purpose of god he's sold by himself which is exactly opposite to works or any man has in himself because before the children were what he had already said jacob have a love but he so have had on water about here how he could come from that perfect pure elected holy consecrated father or mother so to bless it god caused by what it is no more the flesh at the beginning you can trace he's a philistine his father was philistine is this this this god changed that completely you can be a philistine you remember david went and rescued an egyptian among the amalekite you remember and jeff he also went and rescued who rescue a big girl from who never a jews a jew from a jew you rescue the gentile and rescue also the jew because neighbor was a fool yet he was from the tribe of judah and david was from the tribe of judah one was wise one foolish hallelujah no matter how good your father and mother was how nice there was how much christian your father and mother was young people he still lays to you as an individual you're standing before god hallelujah this lesson teaches that they both both the children there was even by the elected and call of god father and mother a virgin woman rebecca and a holy man isaac who finally was come down to be even through the seed that came jesus christ he was born as one from the dead he was tested his father before him abraham he was promised through this seed of israel of isaac that the whole world will be saved and out of a man like that and his blood so what that god who would not even let the philistine even touch the mother abimelech could not even touch sarah god protected that amen after abraham had given her over to him god plugged his house and said you are as good as one dead holding that bloodstream pure and that rebecca a righteous holy god sent and god called mother and from that holy seed came forth air and renegade and now see so he lays within god's god's water where are you going and then i'm gonna head home because it's wednesday i still have my minute anybody clear if you look on genesis 26 verse 22 back again the bible says that the children struggle brother robert they struggle away in the womb you ready the children did in struggle after birth somebody called it they struggle before birth we have many mothers here all you can hear when your child was in your womb was probably a kick a kick that was it but this is not a kick it's like somebody is punching the other let's go slowly amen struggle inside her and she said if it be so why am i and she went to inquire of the lord and the lord said to her two nations are in yo and two manners of people what is going on let's look at this a little bit brother branham say you are believing unto eternal life but when the holy spirit comes it is eternal life you are believing on two you are begotten of the spirit at sanctification but never born of the spirit until the holy ghost come in you comes in you that's correct watch now a baby's got life in the womb of her of the mother little what are quivering it is but it's a different life when he breathes the breath of life into its nostrils it is water so based on what brother branham is saying here when a woman is pregnant she has conceived what is moving there is just muscle that life that the baby got came from his father because the father had the hemoglobin amen and he came from the father fertilized the egg and that life began to grow but the baby is not really there [Music] everybody okay now are we digging good are we digging good so if what is in the womb is massage moving with the life that came from the male cell yet those muscles were fighting it was a fight of flesh [Music] anybody clear but the children were not there ever here because if mama delivered that child and the breath of life does not enter that child that child will be dead we call that a still birth so where was the fight really because the nature only is reflecting something you remember the other day going through that when a little baby's been formed in the womb keep your colors off the mothers and these little muscles are kicking and jumping and going on but as soon as the mother drops the baby and the babies to the earth the first thing there is a water to do what to catch the water so a human being have a spiritual body and the natural body yet the natural only kick the true person is a spiritual body but when you look at the womb one is punching the other yet they are not there hallelujah when you look at the scriptures superficially when a babysitting baby is being formed in a womb of a mother first it is a water a spirit and as the spirit begin to take on flesh a little germ of life begins to take home flesh and as soon as he drops from it in the womb it is a lot of quivering jerking muscles we know that that is what just like you take a horse hair and put it in the water it shut and um it will cap over and it will move and you touch it and it will jump that is the way a baby's but as soon as it's born in this world and breathe its first breath it become a what a living soul because as soon as the earthly body is born into the world there is a water or a water to take a hold of it and as soon as this natural body is dropped there is water as the baby drop into the flesh into the earth and flesh there is a spiritual body waiting to receive it and as soon as the spiritual body i mean the natural body is dissolved there is a spiritual body waiting under a what let me adjust it here you okay when god touched him at his birth back there and received the water the holy ghost three months before he was born because john the baptist was six months when elizabeth met mary if you need a scripture you see me yes sir when mary went up and leader john was six-month-old in his mother's womb and he never damn little what brother branham is consistent martials had never moved yet brother branham said didn't say lord john didn't move the muscles of john yet and mary was afraid the little muscle were growing but she could not feel no life elizabeth his mother rather and when mary came up and grabbed her and hug her put her arm laid hand on her say god has spoke to me and i'm going to have a baby too are you and joseph married no merry heart then can this be the holy ghost shall overshadow me and they will be created in me and i shall and i shall call his name who he shall be the son of god and as soon as that word jesus spoke little water begin to do what and jump around his mother the masters of john begin to reflect another john somewhere who is jumping [Music] [Applause] he all started back there are you there she said blessed be the lord god for once cometh the mother of my lord the mother of my lord oh my whence cometh the mother of my lord for as soon as your salutation come into my ear my water leaping ma for what what moves in the body why you men go to hell i'm going to head to the airport in the message who is this melchizedek i was going with the progression of brother branham think of a little baby you can take a woman no matter how evil she is when she's pregnant and fixing to be mother watch before that baby's born i don't care how cruel the woman is she gets real kind there is something about her seems godly to see a little mother fixing to become mother by the baby why is it that little body now it's not alive yet but sometimes he fights sometimes he lives for joy yet it's not alive the only thing it is is just flesh and water that little jumping that is just muscle jerking but when it comes forth from the womb god breathe the breath of life into it and then he screams out as sure as there is a natural body being formed in the womb there is a water a spiritual body to receive it as soon as he gets there in other words when the baby comes the spiritual body enter the baby because james 2 26 say the body without the spirit is water on we're going to jump the moment when a woman is fixing to have a baby you notice i don't care how cruel she's been and how mean you know a while before that baby's born the mother gets gentle why is it when them leader muscle same thought over the year that them little muscle in that won't be switching and jumping like that there is a water spiritual body heavenly bodies brother branham can you please be specific there is a spiritual body waiting for him and when it comes from the mother the doctor or the midwife whoever it is has to pick up and shock it spank it shake it or something then it catches the what the breath of life and the liver you are an angel the little angelic being comes into it the breath of what and he become a living and when we have crust in our heart and christ become real in our heart it is a little water you okay now how let me go there hey brother baby everybody clear so now we can see here that brother branham shows that the spirit of a man is also an angel so angel do not only mean angelic being but your spirit is also an angel why do you men go to hell the devil and he is ethiophany ethiophani when they saw peter they call it what your spirit is called what let me finish these two boys if you shall notice their nature by nature is so has the position he so had the birthright judah had a position abayatah had a position the devil had a position but the devil lost his position ibiada lost his position judah lost his position he so lost his position as the elder he lost the birthright why all of them keep losing their position the angel which was in heaven lost their estate if you notice one of them was spiritual man that was jacob and when the colonel man was who the bible said esau was a man of the field and jesus said in matthew 13 that they feel this what he was a worldly man but they were both religious that same thing has took place all down through the the colonel and no more in the flesh back there is so represented the man of the earth natural religious inclined like judah but never able it was not in him to do it he could not do it he never was in him to be able to climb and pass the things of the what the corner things why did you climb above it somebody else could not clamp it you had friends that are still smoking smoking smoking drinking and they die with the shoes they put on their on their shoes why did you quit what is the devil telling you because you got mad god forget you but jacob it was so easy for him to do it now jacob had one purpose and that was he longed for that birthright why who explained him the birthright usually the youngest one is mama's best buddy mama would hang with the little one the benjamin but he didn't want to be benjamin are you there no matter how he got it just regarded and that spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today it is coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the carnal believer carnal believer no one could say they was not both religious they were they didn't say that one servant and the other god they were above water how can you tell a difference now in eden you can go to the laboratory and prove that that cain was not a son of adam in eden you can go to the laboratory take the blood of abel and go to the laboratory and prove that abel was a child of adam but in the case of rebecca and isaac both pureline if you use the human intellect you will never be able to catch it how are you gonna tell which is what hallelujah because jesus said many will come in my name because they're both religious they will say have we not done what caster devo prophesies in your name speaking in tongues all these things and jesus said i never knew you how can you tell them brother stephen give them the word how can you know it speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the world they have no seed germ in them they are off the water and deceive you church that's why i keep grounding you in the scripture the bible says brother branham say the bible say brother branham said because we are interpreting the bible according to the revelation of the mystery that's what paul said in romans 16 25 that's why i grant you in the word in the scripture are you there as the first blood was deceived and the second blood was deceived they are deceiver of the water which is ours by what are breeding the word of water god never plays sons ahead of his word [Applause] if it's so judah will deceive you if it saw the anointing one at the end time will deceive you if it saw the pentecostal had miracles that would deceive you hallelujah amen that is his culture god never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first to prove it elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle come to the world fast and then watch the water the seed word itself is what the holy spirit energizes this sunset follow are you there so i don't care how many miracles you do i don't care how many dreams you have i don't care what is going on in your life you must produce a life word a pure consecrated word that is line up with the word of god don't tell me you spiritual and you are the order with the word that is the wrong seed power with our character is satanic and it's not fit to rain but for the overcomer of laodicea to him that overcome he must reign you need character by the word and if the word is presented pure receive pure automatically the miraculous will follow your life you don't follow for them they follow you the miracle will knock at your door and say we are here because you believe in the word let's stand up [Applause] i'm sorry i went four minutes ahead [Music] hallelujah keep in mind hell prepare for the devil and water so from today you know the word angel in the bible means many things you understand now an angel could be the spirit of a man an angel could be a teopany like peter an angel could be also an angelic being like the book of hebrews say they are ministering spirit i have it here but i don't want to keep going because of time i already have it so when they say the devil and his angel now you understand why you men can go to hell they're going to hell because their angelic spirit they are angel also by the angelic spirit so the kingdom of the devil and the kingdom of god got these three things god got his angelic children before we were born we were angelic beings i will show you those quotes on sunday lords willing and when you born from your mother you got in god helps also have ministering spirit like gabriel like wormwood those angels amen and god also have theophany which are the angel that they saw peter on the other kingdom the devil also have his children angelic beings also he also have his ministering spirit which we call demons amen and he also have theophany that's why brother branham said when i went when he went to hell he saw them in the theophany the difference our theophany have the same age according to the scripture amen and their theophany have different ages that's why in the judgment of the throne the the white throne remember the bible said they will be small and great amen because somebody will die young and they're going to resurrect young if you go to hell you see them young if they were not born in christ but if they were born in christ if you go there or everybody if you were 90 years old brother branham saw that woman as 18 years old amen brother branham saw his baby that died as a baby over there 18 years old in hell it's a different story there is two kingdoms both of them get angelic spirit of man theophanies and angelic ministering on the other side they are called demons everybody clear it is about election that's why paul said examine yourself whether you are in there and remember on sunday jesus prayed for peter he prayed for what for his faith that he fell if not when jesus looked he prayed he said peter you're going to go through a test you're going to deny me three times don't worry i'll meet you on the other side amen he could redeem and recuperate peter but not judah amen the bible call is so i have it here he's so cry the bible say he cried he cried seeking for what he was looking for space to enter but there is no representation he can be redeemed amen give me a blessing give me a blessing they just gave it to him the left over amen remember church put your faith in christ let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for this elective love that have chosen was before the foundation of the world father i'm so happy for this love because it takes away all our human ability there is nothing that we can brag there is nothing that we can boast the only boasting is like what paul said that if i could boast our boast in the lord because paul could not even boast according to the religion he show his curriculum vitae how he was a pharisee of the pharisee how he was born of the tribe of benjamin how he was zealous upon following the tradition of the father and yet he persecuted the church there was nothing he could boast but one day he met you as a light a pillar of fire and from there on paul understood the power of weakness even to glory in the weakness because he understood that when he was more weaker then father you were stronger and stronger in his life lord oh heavenly father i thank you for unveiling this election to us lord father to remove all complexes of the family from where we came from maybe some were not born from an uh uh from a wealthy family maybe mother was a prostitute maybe father was a drug addict maybe they were born father and they grew up in the street maybe they were doing things that were not good in your sight but father you are unveiled unto us the second birth that goes beyond all imagination how the god of glory the holy god the one that the angel could not even stand and look at your face father you could drop that holiness lord and come into a veil of flesh lord and father to be accepted lord father to be stripped all the way on the cross smitten lord father of god father speed on by human beings ridicule and mock lord and father you took all of us to redeem us lord from our filthy condition so that today we can stand boldly and be the righteousness of god and approach the throne of god lord with assurance knowing lord father that we can bring our petition and father you're going to hear us lord we thank you for removing every dependency on our ability father there is nothing in us that we can depend on her there is no understanding that we can lean upon but there is one thing you say heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away there is a word that we can cling the word the sure word of prophecy that we can cling onto it lord father knowing that he will bring us all the way until we're going to meet our bridegroom father we thank you for your children tonight lord you know the desire and the needs in their heart lord father i pray lord father that each one that was on the lord father the son of this voice lord father maybe they came with a specific need lord but father may you remember and may you granted unto them the desire of their heart lord may you continue to minister to your children strengthen our body lord protect us lord father in the midst of this pandemic may the blood of the lamb continue to protect your children father you gave us multiple trouble uh uh multiple promises in the scripture lord concerning concerning the plague lord and father may your children lord being shaken away from every spirit of doubt every spirit of fear may they understand lord father that you who gave the promise you are more than able to fulfill it until the day of jesus christ lord we commit them unto the hand and thank you for everything lord as we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love
