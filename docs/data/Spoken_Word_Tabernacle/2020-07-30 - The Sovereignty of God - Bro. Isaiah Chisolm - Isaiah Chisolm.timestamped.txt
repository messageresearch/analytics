[23:42] day by day we need him especially in
[23:45] this day where the pandemic is going on
[23:48] we need him everything is so confused
[23:52] the media is confused politics confused
[23:56] that's what brother branham said there
[23:58] is an uncertain sound
[24:00] everywhere you don't know who's telling
[24:01] the truth or not but we know where the
[24:04] truth is
[24:05] it's in the message of the hour praise
[24:08] the lord
[24:10] i was reading a quote back there uh
[24:13] in the revelation of jesus christ
[24:16] brother branham say that so then
[24:18] you see why satan is so against the book
[24:21] of revelation
[24:23] you say anything that is revealed
[24:27] spiritual revelation
[24:30] certainly is against it he say that's
[24:33] why
[24:34] he so against the ministry today
[24:39] he said because what is it
[24:42] the revealing of christ
[24:45] so brother branham start first with the
[24:47] book of revelation
[24:49] then he put it with his own ministry so
[24:52] we wonder
[24:53] whether the book of revelation was truly
[24:56] the ministry of brother branham
[24:58] god's willing we will deal into it
[25:01] this is the end time ministry we love it
[25:04] the devil is against it
[25:05] we stand for it we back it up
[25:09] and we live for it and it is the message
[25:11] of the hour
[25:13] praise the lord we greet you all in the
[25:15] name of jesus christ i know there's more
[25:17] many more people online god richly bless
[25:20] you
[25:20] and we trust this will be a blessing
[25:22] because we have a wonderful
[25:24] preacher tonight brother isaiah chisholm
[25:29] he's not new here
[25:33] i know brother isaiah is not new here
[25:35] this is home
[25:37] so when you hear you preach like home
[25:39] and we pull like homer
[25:41] so have your liberty and you can come on
[25:44] and bless the bride of jesus christ

[38:01] dimension
[38:02] so if uh i don't know the deacon is but
[38:05] just kind of wave your hand
[38:08] but you got to wave your hand fast
[38:10] because if you wave your hand like this

[38:14] amen praise the lord
[38:16] amen i just want to by the help of the
[38:18] lord
[38:19] i just want to deal with the message
[38:21] that our prophet preached
[38:23] and the title of that message was the
[38:26] sovereignty
[38:27] of god oh my the sovereignty of god
[38:32] now uh i want to uh the title is the
[38:36] sovereignty of god
[38:37] and if if i could have a subtext it
[38:40] would be
[38:41] who is controlling earth affairs who is
[38:46] controlling
[38:47] earth affairs
[38:51] what says the scripture and the prophet
[38:54] that's what i love about brother steve
[38:56] so well
[38:57] amen he he lays it on the word and if
[39:00] you
[39:00] don't believe he'll put it and let you
[39:02] know the prophet said and i
[39:03] i just appreciate that amen that's what
[39:06] god's people
[39:07] amen based everything on the word that's
[39:09] why we could believe the prophet amen
[39:12] he's a word prophet i don't know how
[39:14] people uh
[39:15] get them all mixed up and i do know if
[39:17] you ain't ordained for you just won't
[39:19] see it amen
[39:21] amen let's look at the word let us keep
[39:23] moving on and i get way out there in
[39:25] left field
[39:26] amen now just want to look at the word
[39:28] the definition of the word
[39:30] sovereign the word sovereign is one who
[39:33] abideth
[39:34] alone and who has no governing
[39:37] body a king who's ruled softly from his
[39:41] dictate
[39:43] of his own heart mind sometimes i
[39:46] believe my my
[39:47] my family feel like i'm a god because i
[39:50] just do just like i want right now
[39:52] i would do some work around the house
[39:54] and then tell me daddy that what are you
[39:56] doing

[40:04] god you know you might always just leave
[40:06] him alone
[40:08] you know he gonna do what he wants you
[40:10] know
[40:11] but i told them i said you can't see
[40:14] but after it's all over you say wow
[40:17] what a masterpiece i i was doing some
[40:20] work in the house
[40:21] and uh my daughter my oldest daughter i
[40:23] bless the lord i'm looking forward to be

[40:37] how do you like that she said uh it's
[40:40] okay
[40:41] i said oh oh i said what's wrong it's
[40:44] it's it's taking up spaces
[40:45] it just didn't seem like you're making
[40:47] everything all clustered up
[40:49] i said baby i'm not finished with it i
[40:51] said wait till i finish putting the
[40:53] touch to
[40:54] the final touch see people don't
[40:56] understand but wait
[40:57] god is making that final touch are you
[41:00] hearing me
[41:01] i said this wait till i do the final
[41:02] touch on it and just wait till i paint
[41:05] she just walked away and she said well
[41:07] daddy i can't see it i said well
[41:08] you know some everybody don't have you
[41:11] know everybody can't see this revelation
[41:13] everybody so don't get upset when people
[41:16] going back
[41:17] out left field and just can't see it
[41:19] bless all your eyes because you could
[41:21] see it
[41:22] so she kind of walked away you know i
[41:24] didn't understand daddy
[41:26] but when i finished that final touch
[41:29] and when i finished putting that uh that
[41:32] that sherry william paint on it
[41:35] and then i was off preaching somewhere
[41:37] and she sent me a text
[41:38] and said daddy oh daddy she said that
[41:42] does look good
[41:43] say just don't pay me no attention and
[41:46] so i use that
[41:47] when i do other things i said well you
[41:49] remember you told me don't pay you no
[41:51] attention
[41:52] amen so sometimes my children feel like
[41:54] well you know
[41:55] he's going to do it just like he won't
[41:57] so a king
[41:59] who ruled some league from his dictate
[42:02] of his own heart and whose ever
[42:06] decision is final
[42:10] let me read something here before i just
[42:13] get started here it's as the darkness
[42:15] around
[42:16] us depends and men lead more and more to
[42:19] the glorification
[42:21] of themself rather than christ the needs
[42:24] grows
[42:25] more urgent for the teaching of god's
[42:27] full
[42:28] control on earth as well as
[42:32] in heaven many will confess that god's
[42:35] rules
[42:36] in the heaven but for the most part of
[42:39] his rulership on earth
[42:41] is out doubt it's doubted or outright
[42:43] deny
[42:45] why the modern intellectual thinkers
[42:48] pushes the creator more and more into
[42:51] the background
[42:53] thank god he sent us a prophet in his
[42:56] days amen preaching adopting
[42:59] the sovereignty of god
[43:02] now if you will you just turn with me to
[43:05] exodus
[43:06] i type these words into here so if i
[43:08] misread something i
[43:10] forgive me i just print it out in a
[43:12] hairy
[43:13] amen let's just turn with me exodus
[43:16] the seventh chapter amen as
[43:20] you know i just thank god for this
[43:21] revelation that he has given to us
[43:24] amen as uh my precious brother said
[43:28] early
[43:28] man satan hates revelation
[43:32] because revelation revealed the devil
[43:36] and that's why he is so upset with us
[43:39] and he know he can't do nothing with us
[43:41] because we are living in the end time
[43:44] and we know
[43:45] the devil moves we got satan
[43:48] answers amen so satan hates genesis
[43:53] and he hate genesis is a c chapter that
[43:56] shows the beginning
[43:57] and everything that we see now listen to
[43:59] me because we're going to explain that
[44:01] later
[44:01] everything that you see now everything
[44:04] that you could see with your element
[44:06] your six
[44:07] i uh your elements are uh yo yo your
[44:10] eyes
[44:10] you can see it's these are the things
[44:13] that was in
[44:14] noise days you you see
[44:17] the the glamour you see the the great
[44:19] fall on the way
[44:20] don't don't be surprised these were the
[44:23] things that was in north day
[44:25] and i believe in nora days i believe
[44:27] there was a broad of people that was
[44:29] going
[44:30] there to hear noah preach noah kept
[44:32] preaching
[44:33] it's going to rain his next sermon he
[44:35] gave his taste
[44:36] it's going to work it's going to rain it
[44:39] got so
[44:40] in the people's mind it become uh just a
[44:43] formality
[44:44] until they got tired of coming to church
[44:46] they got tired
[44:47] hearing the prophet talk all the time
[44:50] they got tired so
[44:51] they wanted to hear other clergymans
[44:55] so by then hearing other clergymen they
[44:58] start
[44:58] deviating off of what noah said
[45:02] see noah was trying to tell them to get
[45:04] into the ark
[45:06] and god has got an ark of safety this
[45:08] morning
[45:09] which is the message of the hour now
[45:12] it's one thing to be around the ark
[45:14] and there's another thing to be in the
[45:16] ark are you hearing me
[45:18] there's a lot of people that is around
[45:19] the ark amen
[45:21] around this message but i'm going to
[45:23] want to be just around this man saying
[45:25] lord let me be in the message let me be
[45:28] a part of the message
[45:31] the message is just not books and tapes
[45:33] and quotes
[45:34] amen amen the message is reality
[45:38] are you hearing me so that's why it's
[45:41] got to come off the pages
[45:43] and it's got to live in my heart that's
[45:45] what i've been asking god
[45:46] it's it's all right for me to read the
[45:48] bible it's all right for me to walk with
[45:50] the quote book
[45:51] the seal book have the tape have the
[45:54] hospital head on the wall
[45:55] all of that good but what good is it
[45:58] it's going to do
[45:59] if he's not in my heart
[46:02] i told my wife i i got into a place now
[46:06] i just want more of god i've gotten to a
[46:09] place but
[46:10] i do i don't too much care if my necktie
[46:13] matches my shoes
[46:18] i'm just trying to get this word out now
[46:21] because i see the
[46:22] the the cuntiness of the devil
[46:25] amen we got to fall in love i told my
[46:29] wife i said
[46:30] i i've i've i've seen we could have a
[46:33] a million couple million dollar church
[46:36] finite church fine facility nice a
[46:40] fellowship hall you can have
[46:42] all of that and don't even have christ
[46:46] now i believe that the prophet of god
[46:49] our prophet for this generation
[46:51] if you will notice the prophet of god he
[46:53] came so simple that a lot of people miss
[46:57] him
[46:58] now i'm sure that brother brown has some
[47:00] millionaires
[47:01] in his church but if you ever been to
[47:05] the voice of god the old
[47:07] uh voice of god recorded and in
[47:09] jeffersonville
[47:10] indiana it's just a little square
[47:12] builder how many of them been there
[47:14] a little square simple build ain't
[47:16] nothing pretty about it
[47:18] it ain't fancy the ceiling is real low
[47:21] it got some little columns in the middle
[47:23] i mean everything just it's got a little
[47:25] like a little
[47:26] older smell to it i mean ain't nothing
[47:29] fancy about it
[47:31] now i'm sure if you look at the voice of
[47:34] card
[47:35] voice of god recordings if i remember i
[47:38] think it had some nice columns
[47:40] it's a real fact not the one that joseph
[47:42] had but the old ones
[47:44] kind of a little bit more fancier so
[47:46] brother browner came real
[47:48] simple so i say all that they say that
[47:51] i don't care about a church don't have
[47:54] to have
[47:54] chandeliers and and pop organs and
[47:58] and the choir got the same they may hold
[48:00] the keys right to the turn
[48:02] blew into faith none of that matters
[48:04] nothing no more
[48:05] what i want to preach now i want to
[48:08] preach the holy ghost
[48:09] that the people get a revelation why
[48:12] they coming to church
[48:14] that's what i find out people need i
[48:16] find all the years people come to church
[48:18] just calls up a beautiful church then
[48:21] when pressure comes
[48:22] they go the other way but let me tell
[48:24] you what somebody asked me to say about
[48:26] a few months ago and said brother
[48:27] children what are you going to do
[48:28] i said what kind of question is that
[48:30] they said what are you going to do
[48:32] i said i'm going to do what i've always
[48:33] been doing i've been serving to god
[48:36] before i
[48:36] met this man excuse me i've been knowing
[48:40] god
[48:41] way before i knew the devil
[48:42] [Applause]
[48:44] the devil wasn't even god's mind from
[48:46] the beginning
[48:48] you was in his mind you was a thought of
[48:51] god
[48:51] from the foundation of the world
[48:55] now see y'all y'all been talking about
[48:57] that now i'm trying not go there but
[48:59] that spirit is in here by predestination
[49:03] the the foreign knowledge of god
[49:05] election is all in here
[49:07] but i i didn't come to preach that i
[49:09] come to preach to you
[49:11] the sovereignty of god
[49:14] oh praise god oh i feel i feel real
[49:18] i feel all young again my
[49:21] mind praise the lord
[49:24] amen exodus the seventh chapter mind off
[49:27] all part of me uh y'all sorry i'm sorry
[49:31] now
[49:31] if i'm not following church order
[49:33] correctly because i i i
[49:35] i'm breaking protocol now oh my
[49:39] exodus the seventh chapter
[49:43] takes it up to the seventh chapter
[49:46] and we begin to read uh from the first
[49:50] verse
[49:52] and it reads now this was god
[49:55] instruction to moses
[49:58] are you listening at me this was god
[50:01] this was an error this was
[50:05] this wasn't pharaoh this was coming
[50:08] from who god
[50:12] okay now what now god don't make no
[50:15] mistake right
[50:17] god is perfect in all of his way right
[50:21] there's no failure in god right
[50:25] so we know that all things work together
[50:27] to the what
[50:28] to the good to them that of the call
[50:32] according to the purpose so you first
[50:34] got to realize
[50:35] there's a purpose then you know you got
[50:38] a purpose then you know you got an
[50:40] election
[50:42] see and those that are called those that
[50:44] love now
[50:45] that romans 8 28 is not for everybody
[50:49] everybody call according to the bypass
[50:52] are you hearing me so you've been called
[50:55] justified sanctified and
[50:56] already been glorified in god's mind
[51:00] we we we already you know the only thing
[51:02] we try to get this whole past how
[51:04] to act right and i want to tell you and
[51:07] sisters you're wasting your
[51:09] time you go to a good service you go
[51:13] home
[51:13] or you can shout out here praise god but
[51:15] if you don't pray that that hair cuts up
[51:19] this thing right here acts up he'll get
[51:21] real ill
[51:22] if he don't get enough rest and get ill
[51:24] if it don't eat right he'd get ill
[51:27] my wife told me last night i got to talk
[51:29] outside i worked so hard i got to
[51:31] talking so much
[51:32] she said you this what happened to you
[51:34] when you tired that's what you're
[51:35] talking about
[51:37] so this flesh ain't no good but we see
[51:40] mine uh yeah brother steve i'd have to
[51:42] come back and i'm gonna do all that talk
[51:43] i just feel good tonight
[51:45] my mind just don't know how to do it i'm
[51:48] in dennis house amen
[51:49] i'm just cutting up and and the bible
[51:52] said in
[51:53] exodus 7 chapter and the lord said unto
[51:57] moses
[51:58] see i have made thee a god now you know
[52:00] god is the object of worship to pharaoh
[52:03] and aaron thy brother shall be thy
[52:06] prophet in other words
[52:07] moses you be like god you speak you tell
[52:10] aaron
[52:10] and everyone go do what you tell him to
[52:13] do
[52:14] that's right verse 2 thou shalt speak
[52:17] all that i
[52:18] command thee and aaron thy brother shall
[52:21] speak unto pharaoh
[52:23] that he send the children of israel
[52:26] out of the land
[52:30] and i will harden pharaoh's heart and
[52:33] multiply
[52:34] my side of my signs and my wonders
[52:38] in the land of egypt now the prophet god
[52:40] said egypt was a type
[52:42] of the world or an organization but
[52:45] pharaoh
[52:46] shall not hearken unto you that i may
[52:49] lay my hand my god want to lay his hand
[52:51] upon egypt and bring forth my armies
[52:55] and my people the children of israel
[53:00] out of the land of egypt by the great
[53:04] judgment and the
[53:07] egyptian shall know that i am
[53:10] the lord when i stretch forth my hand
[53:13] upon egypt and bring out the children of
[53:17] israel
[53:18] from among them and moses
[53:21] and aaron did as the lord command them
[53:24] listen what we got to do we got to do
[53:26] like the lord
[53:28] commands us now this cannot just go back
[53:31] and
[53:32] just kind of bring something out that
[53:34] the lord just showed to me
[53:36] now you see that when god
[53:40] you know god spoke to moses just like he
[53:42] speaks to the bride
[53:45] but we must understand the mind of god
[53:48] i think we need to understand how god's
[53:51] work we we need to understand
[53:54] the nature of god so you know the nature
[53:57] of god
[53:58] you know how god worked because god is
[54:01] love
[54:02] the bible said he that love is known god
[54:05] for god
[54:05] is love first john 4 7 8 so
[54:08] god is love but here's moses can you
[54:12] imagine if i just paraphrased would it
[54:14] be all right
[54:15] can you imagine god speak to moses god
[54:18] speak to brother steve
[54:19] and brothers teach oh my he wakes up in
[54:22] the middle of the night
[54:23] he said honey wake up wake up sister
[54:25] wake up
[54:26] god just spoke to me what what do you
[54:28] say honey god told me to tell the people

[56:03] before you say yeah because most people
[56:05] know how evangelists preach they'll be
[56:06] all over the place
[56:07] but let me kind of slow down here but
[56:10] hear aaron
[56:11] saying to uh moses said now aaron
[56:14] no tomorrow we're leaving everyone say
[56:17] what
[56:18] where we going we're going down to king
[56:21] pharaoh
[56:22] and i can imagine aaron aaron was a man
[56:25] did the bible say elijah would like
[56:27] passion as we are
[56:28] can you imagine brother steve yeah we
[56:31] we going before the president somebody
[56:34] said well i'm not afraid of donald trump
[56:36] i guarantee you you had to go stand in
[56:38] front of
[56:38] the mr president and you had to make a
[56:40] speech or say something you'd be all
[56:42] nervous you have your little nose
[56:44] how you supposed to say it you you know
[56:46] you get all messed up i'm all nervous
[56:48] and drop your nose
[56:49] and miss ryan call him mrs president
[56:51] you're all messed up in your mind
[56:53] but see moses told aaron look brother
[56:56] when we go down there he said we're
[56:58] going to egypt yes we're going to egypt
[57:01] and brother when they went down to egypt
[57:03] moses told
[57:05] aaron said speak thus saith the lord oh
[57:08] everyone stood up there i could imagine
[57:10] stood up there and the wind just blowing
[57:12] hey man well i don't know where matter
[57:13] wasn't blowing in the place amen
[57:15] but aaron was standing there and when
[57:17] everyone spoke that
[57:18] said the lord moses let my people go
[57:24] and and they will look back i mean like
[57:27] moses the people ain't moving what's
[57:28] wrong
[57:29] oh see we want to harry god
[57:32] we want to put a time when this supposed
[57:35] to happen
[57:36] we want to put our time but see god is
[57:39] sovereign
[57:39] within itself now there ain't nobody to
[57:42] tell
[57:43] god how to run his business
[57:46] ain't nobody big enough to tell god how
[57:49] to run his business
[57:50] he says i am god and i'm god all by
[57:53] myself
[57:54] there wasn't nobody to tell god how to
[57:57] put the stars in his orbit
[57:59] there wasn't nobody to tell god how to
[58:02] make the sea
[58:02] and the ocean roll at night there was
[58:05] nobody
[58:06] there was no man standing there and said
[58:08] oh god
[58:09] oh god you got the sun a little too
[58:12] close
[58:12] you got it 93 billion miles in there but
[58:15] let's take a little further
[58:16] because it's going to be too hot on
[58:17] there nobody
[58:19] nobody was there to tell god how to run
[58:23] his business
[58:24] he was god and god alone
[58:28] and when we get the understanding how
[58:31] god runs
[58:32] his program then we are walking to life
[58:35] as he is in the light come with the
[58:37] dewdrop
[58:38] so you won't be all wishing watch and
[58:41] wonder what god is doing
[58:42] that's why the prophet of god said in
[58:44] the sixth seal
[58:45] he said don't try to manufacture nothing
[58:48] just walk amen right this day man
[58:52] and that's what i try to do i don't try
[58:54] to manufacture nothing
[58:56] the only thing i do is just love the
[58:57] lord i just love those that despise me
[59:00] to use me
[59:01] especially especially my friends
[59:06] do you know your enemy can't hurt you
[59:08] they're actually where you get those
[59:10] scars from
[59:12] i got it from the house of my friend
[59:14] brother steve your enemy can't hurt you
[59:16] it's going gonna be your closest friend
[59:18] the one that you thought was your buddy
[59:20] the one that went out and ate lunch with
[59:22] you and your wife the one that held your
[59:24] little girl of your little boy
[59:26] and say ain't she pretty oh don't your
[59:28] wife have a nice dress song
[59:30] i wish i had one like her they'll be the
[59:33] one that they caught you
[59:34] but what god is doing is building
[59:37] character
[59:39] don't tell god how to run his business
[59:43] god allow all this to happen because
[59:45] he's molding us
[59:47] he's molding us and no nobody like be
[59:49] cut off nobody don't let me tell nothing
[59:52] huh you tell somebody to move that there
[59:55] no no people don't want you to tell
[59:57] nothing everybody in their own free

[1:06:11] glory of god
[1:06:12] god knows what he is doing so that's why
[1:06:16] we need to have confidence in god
[1:06:19] there ain't nothing out of cater now
[1:06:22] i can get real personal with you if you
[1:06:24] allow me
[1:06:25] god knows all day he knows that he flee

[1:06:31] god know how many people

[1:06:35] god knows how many
[1:06:37] what's going to be screaming it there
[1:06:38] ain't nothing allocated with god
[1:06:42] this what happened to this church you
[1:06:44] think it you thinking
[1:06:46] you think you caught god by surprise god
[1:06:49] knew this before we did
[1:06:51] we thought everything was good when we
[1:06:53] thought we everybody loved the lord
[1:06:55] god already i knew he knew it's going to
[1:06:57] be at a point at times
[1:06:59] god's gonna allow things to be manifest
[1:07:02] and i'm gonna tell you brother sister
[1:07:04] you got to love god with all your heart
[1:07:06] this one thing
[1:07:08] this one thing you can't fake
[1:07:11] you can't you say well brother children
[1:07:13] i got love
[1:07:14] chris and science got that where brother
[1:07:18] children i come to church
[1:07:19] you can't base it on that because
[1:07:21] christian science got love
[1:07:22] brother brown said you said well oh
[1:07:25] she's such a kind sister oh he's just a
[1:07:27] con bruh
[1:07:28] you can't base your salvation on that
[1:07:31] because the kind priest
[1:07:32] did did not stay and brother brown said
[1:07:35] it was of the devil even jesus said that
[1:07:37] so what i'm trying to say we got to
[1:07:39] thank god
[1:07:40] for his grace god is sovereign
[1:07:44] in what he do you love the lord oh my
[1:07:47] do you love him with all your heart
[1:07:52] let me read something here a quote from
[1:07:54] the prophet
[1:07:57] it said does he say
[1:08:03] and god being sovereign there is no one
[1:08:06] to tell him
[1:08:07] what to do or how to do it and that
[1:08:10] makes me feel good and it ought to make
[1:08:13] us all feel good
[1:08:17] let's read another quote doing god is
[1:08:20] servant
[1:08:21] god is sovereign first we want to
[1:08:24] understand
[1:08:26] do you believe that god is sovereign
[1:08:31] now i'm gonna ask you do you believe
[1:08:33] that god is sovereign
[1:08:34] now if you don't believe that you're
[1:08:35] gonna have a hard time when god
[1:08:38] makes things happen you're all confused
[1:08:40] but
[1:08:41] nothing happens the prophet of god said
[1:08:43] nothing could happen to a christian
[1:08:45] that god hasn't pretended amen and
[1:08:49] there's some things brother brown said
[1:08:51] it's his opinion but i heard people some
[1:08:53] people say well that's brother brandon
[1:08:55] opinion
[1:08:55] but let me tell you brother and sister
[1:08:58] i'd rather live on what his opinion
[1:09:00] to follow along what these ministers
[1:09:02] have to say amen
[1:09:04] that's why i believe that he's god's
[1:09:06] prophet i don't care what the world said
[1:09:09] he was god's prophet to this third
[1:09:11] generation
[1:09:12] and i'm gonna follow him you say oh
[1:09:16] brother children
[1:09:16] you follow man you got that right i'm
[1:09:19] going to follow william bradley
[1:09:20] i hope everybody see that i'm going to
[1:09:23] follow william brown
[1:09:24] as he follow christ you say what you

[1:20:35] and before i read 28 let's just lay this
[1:20:39] in here
[1:20:39] it's so easily it's very easy as human
[1:20:42] beings
[1:20:44] we we we know you know if we go outside
[1:20:47] the wind blowing hall

[1:20:57] you know god made his son the night fall
[1:21:00] the moon stars shine
[1:21:02] i thank god but when something happened
[1:21:04] would look like
[1:21:05] man man does a little tricky things and
[1:21:08] man
[1:21:09] does this and cause this to go wrong you
[1:21:12] say
[1:21:12] now look look look and it looks just
[1:21:15] like
[1:21:15] man got power
[1:21:18] right now that's wrong what he did how
[1:21:22] could he do
[1:21:22] all of that he don't got all this power

[1:21:29] he just said man he just do it he can't
[1:21:31] do no more
[1:21:32] than god allowed him to do
[1:21:36] god is releasing evil on this earth
[1:21:39] every spirit that come before
[1:21:41] comes in the presence of god
[1:21:44] do you believe that every spirit is
[1:21:46] subject to god
[1:21:48] so that that ought to help you to
[1:21:50] realize
[1:21:51] when trouble comes in your home do you
[1:21:54] realize
[1:21:54] that satan had to go up on heaven's door
[1:22:00] he wanted to go back over here so bad
[1:22:02] because he want to go to your home
[1:22:03] but he can't go he got that
[1:22:09] i need to go down there before they wake
[1:22:11] up

[1:22:34] i want to torment that husband like why
[1:22:36] can't i go
[1:22:37] and what the father said go because the
[1:22:40] sovereignty of god
[1:22:41] god allowed that demon to go and knock
[1:22:44] on your door
[1:22:45] and i'm going to tell you brothers and
[1:22:47] sisters no demon no devil

[1:27:39] like my god i mean you adjourned by
[1:27:41] yourself
[1:27:42] i mean and like people just losing their
[1:27:45] mind and look like the devil is putting
[1:27:46] the pressure on the people

[1:27:51] they got the temp before they come to
[1:27:53] church let me tell you what
[1:27:54] i'm not tipping i'm not going to do none
[1:27:57] of that i'm going to serve god i could
[1:28:00] go wherever god want me to go amen
[1:28:02] if god gonna be with me if god wanted me
[1:28:05] to sing
[1:28:06] when i went to africa during christmas
[1:28:08] if he wanted that plane to go down
[1:28:10] in that ocean i've been left here so i
[1:28:14] believe
[1:28:14] my hand my my body my mind my soul
[1:28:18] is in the hand of the almighty god
[1:28:25] my my do you love the lord do you love
[1:28:27] the lord
[1:28:28] oh my what was i amen and and and then i
[1:28:31] read psalm 22
[1:28:33] and i didn't psalm 22 and verse 8 28
[1:28:36] psalms 22 and verse 28 are you thereby
[1:28:39] saying amen
[1:28:40] it said for the kingdom is the lord
[1:28:44] and he is the governor among the nations
[1:28:47] my he's a governor among the nation
[1:28:52] i see my i was just thinking could it be
[1:28:56] if god gonna work all things out for his
[1:28:58] good
[1:28:59] so that being said you mean to say god
[1:29:02] is controlling
[1:29:03] the things that's happened in the
[1:29:05] political realm
[1:29:10] brother rob you you think god takes time
[1:29:14] to deal with politics
[1:29:21] my politics the pale horse rider you
[1:29:25] you think god releases things well you
[1:29:28] know
[1:29:28] when when we when we talk about politics
[1:29:31] and i'm not here with pastor steve to
[1:29:32] preach on politics
[1:29:33] but i just want to lay this in here god
[1:29:35] is controlling everything
[1:29:37] god allowed things to happen this got to
[1:29:40] be in play
[1:29:40] before that could happen and we just
[1:29:43] need to be patient on this coronal virus
[1:29:46] god is going to work something out for
[1:29:48] his good
[1:29:49] somebody the man said he told me he said
[1:29:52] how long do you think this is going to
[1:29:53] last
[1:29:53] i said sir i don't know he said
[1:29:55] something says it's going to be here
[1:29:57] uh never go away some first city when it
[1:30:01] first comes somebody said
[1:30:02] i predicted by june by june the 28th so
[1:30:06] what's the date the 27th
[1:30:08] so it's supposed to be gone by tomorrow
[1:30:10] see so i don't worry about none of those
[1:30:12] things
[1:30:12] if you're leaving the day tomorrow next
[1:30:14] month next year i just one thing i just
[1:30:16] gonna keep serving god
[1:30:18] are you with me i'm gonna treat seven
[1:30:20] god so god knows all things the
[1:30:22] beginning from the ending
[1:30:23] so if you look at amen god is
[1:30:26] controlling
[1:30:27] the the nation the government god of the
[1:30:30] lord god
[1:30:30] controlling them and you say i i don't
[1:30:33] know about you but
[1:30:34] you know when when we have this
[1:30:35] president let's say the 44th president
[1:30:38] what barack obama he stood up there
[1:30:41] and to this nation i'm not preaching
[1:30:43] politics but i'm trying to bring
[1:30:44] something
[1:30:45] barack obama said i swear so help me god
[1:30:48] and his his theme was it's time for a
[1:30:51] change now who ain't ready for a change
[1:30:54] everybody want to change maybe the gas
[1:30:56] will go down maybe the economy won't be
[1:30:58] so shaky everybody's ready for a change
[1:31:00] yes it brought on a change too what it
[1:31:03] did it brought on a chain
[1:31:05] but god allowed that president that 44th
[1:31:08] president to be in that chair amen to
[1:31:11] the law to be passed
[1:31:12] of luke 17 26 or 27 as
[1:31:16] it was in the days of noah so shall it
[1:31:18] be in the day when the son of man be
[1:31:20] revealed
[1:31:21] what was in noah day homosexuality
[1:31:24] are you hearing me so god is mindful of
[1:31:27] what's been happening
[1:31:28] god allowed that to happen amen so they
[1:31:31] usher in
[1:31:32] the same sex matter and see we should be
[1:31:35] much
[1:31:35] urgent getting ready to get out here
[1:31:37] because the bible says
[1:31:39] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[1:31:42] it be when the son of man
[1:31:44] be revealed god is revealing himself
[1:31:47] today the son of man is being revealed
[1:31:50] so those things has got to happen
[1:31:52] to bring everything together and i don't
[1:31:54] know about you
[1:31:55] i'm happy this happened i'm happy now
[1:31:58] i'm going to say something
[1:31:59] my you know what you say brother
[1:32:01] chisholm brother children
[1:32:02] how do you feel when you see two men
[1:32:04] together i say hallelujah
[1:32:06] we're getting ready to go glory to god
[1:32:10] so brother children you mean to say you
[1:32:12] see two men hugging
[1:32:13] and smooching one another you may say
[1:32:15] you love that stuff i ain't seeing that
[1:32:17] not seeing prophecy
[1:32:18] being fulfilled i've seen we getting
[1:32:20] ready to get out of here
[1:32:22] oh you're hearing me then what makes so
[1:32:24] good when uh
[1:32:25] brother bradley talked about them uh uh
[1:32:29] spoken word original see he talked about
[1:32:31] those two angels he said when that last
[1:32:34] angel go out to sea he said then that
[1:32:36] fight when it went
[1:32:37] when lord came out out of solid he said
[1:32:40] didn't the fire fall
[1:32:41] brother brown said watch those two
[1:32:43] angels let me tell you or
[1:32:45] robson ain't going off the scene billy
[1:32:47] graham just left off the scene
[1:32:50] you think i'm gonna walk around with

[1:33:06] why because i'm going to make this
[1:33:08] rapture god got it

[1:33:35] we in a message church i mean
[1:33:38] we bleed the message we quote the
[1:33:40] prophet message
[1:33:41] we read our bible but while these testes

[1:33:46] coming our way why why are we constantly
[1:33:48] going through
[1:33:49] so much every time i look around and
[1:33:51] think this
[1:33:52] it just battled this brother fighting
[1:33:54] against me and that's going wrong
[1:33:56] why why it's because god
[1:33:59] is building pressure god allowing
[1:34:02] pressure to come
[1:34:02] and i don't care how good you look like
[1:34:04] you're on this earth it's a come upon a
[1:34:06] time

[1:34:15] that family but i just want to tell you
[1:34:18] amen when god tell you know that when
[1:34:21] when those demons come knocking on our

[1:34:41] they're going try your home with another
[1:34:43] test
[1:34:44] when those demons find out that they've
[1:34:46] got to go to brother steve how
[1:34:48] it's oh my god oh my god hello no
[1:34:52] no master oh please let me go to

[1:36:39] what you mean brother children i come
[1:36:41] from the very back part of god's mind
[1:36:45] the very brothers see the back part of
[1:36:47] god's mind
[1:36:49] as a thought as an attribute and now i'm
[1:36:52] in flash and then the end of a man the
[1:36:55] emerald man
[1:36:56] as paul said they're yearning for a body
[1:36:58] change
[1:36:59] i don't know about y'all but i'm getting
[1:37:01] sick and tired of this past house
[1:37:04] this pencil is getting old man parts

[1:37:13] house getting old
[1:37:14] a few more days to be 60 years old i
[1:37:16] thought i've been sitting in hell with

[1:37:19] but god know what he's doing he's going
[1:37:21] to have me on this earth again
[1:37:22] on this earth until he gets me just like
[1:37:25] he won't what you got to do
[1:37:26] he got to get all of the greenness out
[1:37:28] of me
[1:37:31] because sometimes somebody tell me about
[1:37:33] my former church then i want to get an
[1:37:35] attitude what are they doing
[1:37:39] that ain't gonna work god god gonna let
[1:37:41] that work
[1:37:42] i mean i shouldn't be even worried about
[1:37:43] that i should be saying lord
[1:37:45] have mercy are you hearing me and lord
[1:37:48] have mercy
[1:37:49] we shouldn't thank evil of nobody you
[1:37:51] love the lord
[1:37:52] the gospel of john the 19th chapter and
[1:37:55] we're going to try to end right here by
[1:37:56] the heavenly law
[1:37:57] i just want to talk about the
[1:37:58] sovereignty of god i hope it's all right
[1:38:01] tonight
[1:38:04] now look at uh let's look at verse six
[1:38:07] it says when the chief priests therefore
[1:38:10] in the officer saw him
[1:38:11] they cried out saying crucify him
[1:38:14] crucify him pilate said unto them
[1:38:17] take he take him take ye him and crucify
[1:38:21] him
[1:38:22] for i find no fault in him the jews
[1:38:25] answer him
[1:38:26] we have a law you got a law and by our
[1:38:30] law
[1:38:30] he ought to die because he made himself
[1:38:33] the son of god
[1:38:34] when pilate therefore heard that said
[1:38:38] he was more afraid so he was he was
[1:38:40] afraid of
[1:38:41] what they were saying the media are you
[1:38:43] hearing me
[1:38:44] and went and went again into the
[1:38:47] judgment hall
[1:38:48] and said unto jesus which are thou
[1:38:51] but jesus now he actually jesus who are
[1:38:54] you and his wife i told him
[1:38:56] don't have nothing to do with that just
[1:38:57] man what do people want amen
[1:38:59] but jesus gave him no answer
[1:39:03] then said power unto him speaketh thou
[1:39:06] not unto me
[1:39:07] knowing thou not that i have power to
[1:39:10] crucify thee and
[1:39:12] have power to release the mind i didn't
[1:39:14] know power had all that power
[1:39:18] i did not i'm close and i don't want to
[1:39:19] where y'all i did not know
[1:39:21] that that brother had all that power man
[1:39:24] that brother and i turned so many people
[1:39:26] against me
[1:39:26] what i heard and the brother told me he
[1:39:29] said brother children
[1:39:30] they die on you pretty bad they down you
[1:39:32] pretty bad what what i supposed to say
[1:39:34] well what is saying i ain't worrying
[1:39:35] about nothing
[1:39:36] amen i ain't worried about nothing i'm
[1:39:38] just trying to get myself
[1:39:40] out of here with what it say did we
[1:39:42] didn't say something good
[1:39:43] you might don't need to know amen you
[1:39:45] might can't handle them amen but pilate
[1:39:47] thought he had
[1:39:47] all that power hip power amen a man
[1:39:51] born of god made created by god here he
[1:39:54] walking in front of god in flesh
[1:39:56] and telling god to hold your head up
[1:39:58] look into my eye
[1:39:59] and jesus amen he said look look up in
[1:40:02] my eyes look look
[1:40:03] you don't know i got power you don't
[1:40:05] know i got pop
[1:40:06] listen at me look up and paul was our
[1:40:09] governor
[1:40:10] oh he got authority look in my eye look
[1:40:12] look look you don't know i got power to
[1:40:15] have you arrested i got power to release
[1:40:18] you
[1:40:19] and jesus being the word in flesh he
[1:40:22] could wreck the air
[1:40:23] what he did he look up with those
[1:40:26] majestic eyes
[1:40:27] and uh and historically said when jesus
[1:40:30] looked in the eyes of power
[1:40:32] that governor had to drop his head why
[1:40:34] because he was looking to the eye
[1:40:36] of a creator and i just want to tell you
[1:40:39] tonight you don't realize who you are
[1:40:41] but you are more than ever you're a part
[1:40:44] of god
[1:40:45] you come from god and you're going back
