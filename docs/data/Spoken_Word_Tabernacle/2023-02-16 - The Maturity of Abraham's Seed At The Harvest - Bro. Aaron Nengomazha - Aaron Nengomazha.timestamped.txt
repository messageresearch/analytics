[51:06] [Laughter]
[51:08] but he's a Gifted Man
[51:11] and one of the attributes of having a

[51:20] your gift is not positionally placed
[51:23] praise be to God but I I I really enjoy
[51:26] coming and you know hearing the word

[52:00] Amen brother George Martin was a was a
[52:03] teacher he was a pillar of the faith
[52:05] Down in Africa and some of you may know
[52:09] him you know there's there's a power in
[52:11] teaching the Bible says in the book of
[52:14] Israel Nehemiah that Israel had been
[52:16] without God and without teaching priests
[52:20] so you need teaching priests and brother
[52:23] George Martin was one example of a
[52:25] teaching priest and we we will certainly
[52:28] miss him but we know that God is also
[52:31] raising other teaching priests
[52:35] praise be to God
[52:36] Hallelujah
[52:38] I won't belong tonight
[52:41] I don't have a lot so that's why I'm
[52:44] taking my time you know doing
[52:45] preliminaries
[52:46] sometimes God is in the preliminaries
[52:49] when you re when you read the spoken
[52:51] word don't jump to the scripture read
[52:54] everything the introductions read about
[52:57] it
[52:58] amen
[53:00] one time I preached on the one of the
[53:03] last scriptures in the Bible where Paul
[53:05] was greeting people and he says greet
[53:07] appear less approved in the Lord and
[53:10] that was my title being approved in the
[53:12] Lord so you know all the scripture is
[53:15] inspired
[53:16] and uh we love this church and we we
[53:19] know that we are we are praying for you
[53:21] and we know that you are praying for us
[53:22] and we bring you greetings from my
[53:24] pastor brother Barry coffee
[53:27] if we can stand tonight to read the
[53:29] scripture
[53:30] we're gonna read from uh The Book of
[53:33] Matthew chapter 38 verse uh Chapter 13
[53:38] Verse 38.
[53:41] if you have your Bible
[53:43] it read in this wise
[53:46] I'm just gonna I just I'm just gonna
[53:48] take a portion but you know the story so
[53:51] Jesus Christ was talking about the
[53:53] the harvests about the you know the the
[53:56] serpent seed and the seed of Christ
[53:59] and he was interpreting that parable
[54:02] verse 38 he says the field is the world
[54:06] the good seed are the children of the
[54:09] Kingdom
[54:10] but the tears are the children of the
[54:12] wicked one the enemy that sowed them is
[54:15] the devil
[54:16] the Harvest is the end of the world this
[54:19] time that we are living
[54:21] and the reapers are the Angels
[54:23] now how can you meet the minister of
[54:26] brother Branham the reapers are the
[54:29] Angels Hallelujah
[54:31] is therefore the tears are gathered and
[54:34] burnt in the fire so shall it be in the
[54:36] end of this world may God bless the
[54:39] reading of his word you may have your
[54:40] seat
[54:42] tonight for a little for a short time
[54:45] we're going to talk about the maturity
[54:46] of Abram seed at the Harvest
[54:50] amen
[54:52] we love brothers are praying for him
[54:55] amen if there's a man that you need to
[54:57] pray for he's the pastor
[54:59] because you know the enemy attacks the
[55:01] pastor Smite the shepherd and the Sheep
[55:04] who will scatter and there are three
[55:07] three main areas that the devil attack
[55:09] when he wants to attack the pastor he
[55:12] will attack the church
[55:14] he will attack his children
[55:16] and sometimes you attack his wife
[55:19] so that's why sometimes job would say
[55:22] you are speaking like a foolish woman
[55:23] because the devil was attacking job
[55:26] through his wife amen so you you pray
[55:29] for your pastor
[55:31] amen those are things that you know the
[55:33] devil uses to attack the pastor
[55:35] and the things that the devil uses to
[55:38] attack a man
[55:39] it's mainly your job
[55:41] your wife
[55:43] and your religion
[55:45] if you don't pray for these three things
[55:47] as a young man you're going to have a
[55:50] problem
[55:51] the life of a man revolves around these
[55:53] three things
[55:54] your job
[55:56] your religion
[55:57] and your marriage amen amen because when
[56:01] God created Adam
[56:03] that was yet religion a relationship and
[56:07] then the next thing God gave adam the
[56:08] guardian that's his job then you give to
[56:12] Eve that's the wife so those are the
[56:15] three things that revolve around them
[56:17] that's exactly 98 of the problems that a
[56:20] pastor is solving around a man yes sir
[56:23] mostly is those three things that's
[56:25] exactly next time I'll tell you three
[56:27] things that's trouble a young woman
[56:35] praise be to God
[56:37] so you pray for your husband because the
[56:41] husband is the first priest he is the
[56:43] priest of the house amen there are three
[56:45] priesthoods in the Bible the father of
[56:48] the house and the priesthood of the
[56:50] Levites and the priesthood of
[56:52] Melchizedek that's right because job
[56:54] when he was sacrificing for his children
[56:56] yes sir he was doing the work of the
[56:59] priest that's right amen the father is
[57:01] the priest of the house yes they are
[57:04] things that the pastor does not have to
[57:06] deal with
[57:07] the priest of the house you deal with it
[57:10] with those things at his level they are
[57:13] things that God will inquire of the
[57:16] husband that's why the prophet says if
[57:18] you let your wife do that hallelujah
[57:20] praise be to God yes sir I don't know
[57:23] why I'm talking about this but let's go
[57:25] to our scripture
[57:27] so the Seed of Abraham yes now the Seed
[57:31] of Abraham is the seed of Christ that's
[57:34] the seed of God Amen because Genesis is
[57:37] your beginning right that's your seed
[57:40] chapter yes and Revelation is your
[57:42] Harvest that's it whatever was planted
[57:45] in Genesis it's a harvested in
[57:48] Revelation that's right whatever started
[57:50] in the Garden of Eden it will be
[57:53] harvested in the last days
[57:55] hallelujah so we are living in the time
[57:58] of the Harvest and the Bible is
[58:02] predicated upon Harvest oh the Feast of
[58:05] Israel they were based on the Harvest
[58:08] yes
[58:09] Hallelujah the spring feasts and the
[58:12] Autumn Feast amen yes sir I think I
[58:15] spoke about that with the other time I
[58:17] came you know they will start harvesting
[58:19] barley and the the priest would look at
[58:21] the ears of the Corn of Bali for them to
[58:24] declare the Passover because it has to
[58:27] consult yes sir Hallelujah because if it
[58:30] doesn't concise you won't have Bali to
[58:33] bring during the time of the shiv worth
[58:35] that's right which is your which is your
[58:37] first fruits praise be to God and at the
[58:40] time of Pentecost as the Harvest of the
[58:43] wheat amen you are the Feast of the
[58:45] Tabernacles you have the Harvest of the
[58:48] grapes and the pomegranates and the
[58:50] olives yes Hallelujah so the Bible is
[58:54] based upon the Harvest amen and you know
[58:57] these scriptures I'm not going to take
[58:58] so much time on them we have been
[59:00] talking about the Book of Ruth you know
[59:02] coming in the time of the Harvest to
[59:04] Bethlehem and so on and so on hallelujah
[59:07] amen but now Abraham
[59:10] he had a cedar and that seed of Ibraham
[59:14] we know that I'm just you know laying a
[59:16] foundation right now there are two seeds
[59:18] in the Bible huh amen there is a natural
[59:21] seed and then there's a spiritual seed
[59:23] yes Ishmael is the natural seed that's
[59:26] right he is born by the natural wage
[59:29] amen but Isaac is born by the promise
[59:33] and the promise is very specific yes sir
[59:36] I'm going to visit you according to the
[59:38] time of life and your wife yes Sarah yes
[59:43] very specific where the seed will come
[59:46] through amen hallelujah so there are
[59:49] many churches that are gathered tonight
[59:51] but there is one Church which is
[59:54] gathered under the promise behold I send
[59:57] you Elijah the prophet
[1:00:00] Hallelujah the seed of Ibraham is
[1:00:03] recognized by the promise yes it's not
[1:00:06] recognized by the flesh it's recognized
[1:00:09] by the promises when you believe the
[1:00:12] promise then you have a seat of Ibraham
[1:00:16] Hallelujah you cannot be a seed of
[1:00:19] Ibraham If you deny Malachi chapter 4.
[1:00:23] no sir the Seed of Abraham is recognized
[1:00:27] by the promise yes my brother Hallelujah
[1:00:30] and one one of the seeds is a spiritual
[1:00:33] Cedar that's right the other one is a
[1:00:36] natural cedar one is a spiritual manner
[1:00:38] he loves to be in church he loves to
[1:00:42] read the Bible he loves to listen to the
[1:00:45] world that's right and the other is a
[1:00:47] natural man that's right Hallelujah
[1:00:49] that's my brother praise be to God
[1:00:52] the natural man is religious but he is
[1:00:55] not spiritual those are two different
[1:00:57] things being religious and being
[1:01:00] spiritual are two different things
[1:01:01] that's my brother Hallelujah which seed
[1:01:04] are you tonight I believe you're the
[1:01:06] seed of Ibraham that's why you have come
[1:01:09] to church that's why you are saying amen
[1:01:11] that's why you are shouting because you
[1:01:14] are the seat of the promise yes my
[1:01:17] brother Hallelujah pray to my brother
[1:01:19] now the seed of Ibraham is to come to
[1:01:21] maturity yes sir amen yes sir Hallelujah
[1:01:25] and the maturity of the seat amen when
[1:01:29] you plant a seed yes sir the end goal of
[1:01:32] the seed right is to come back to the
[1:01:34] seat yes Hallelujah if you plant corn
[1:01:38] that's right the machine of the corner
[1:01:40] is to become the seed itself so the
[1:01:44] maturity of the seed of Ibraham
[1:01:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah of the
[1:01:51] church is to come to the seed word again
[1:01:55] that's right Hallelujah yes and the
[1:01:58] shark has to pull away the shark has to
[1:02:01] go away the denominational thinking has
[1:02:03] to go away until we become the full
[1:02:06] Cedar of Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] amen hallelujah why is brother Stephen
[1:02:13] laboring tonight all through this night
[1:02:15] and all through these days he is
[1:02:17] preparing the siege of Ibraham to come
[1:02:20] to the Harvester to a place where we
[1:02:22] become the seed again the prophet says
[1:02:26] God is not going to bring a new churcher
[1:02:28] he's going to to mature his church
[1:02:31] that's what he said that seed was
[1:02:34] planted at Pentecost it fell at night
[1:02:37] exactly and it came up to the
[1:02:40] Reformation right and in the last age it
[1:02:42] is to come to the full maturity back to
[1:02:45] it again
[1:02:47] Glory
[1:02:51] so our goal is to come to maturity yes
[1:02:54] sir and when we become mature we become
[1:02:56] like Jesus because there is no servant
[1:03:00] who is greater than his master but if he
[1:03:02] shall come to his master he shall be
[1:03:05] perfect
[1:03:07] hallelujah praise be to God
[1:03:10] that's that's one problem that we don't
[1:03:12] have we don't have maturity
[1:03:15] the difference between called
[1:03:17] Corinthians and Ephesians was maturity
[1:03:20] yes Hallelujah yes there were all
[1:03:23] churches of God but one was greener and
[1:03:26] the other one was mature that's exactly
[1:03:28] right Hallelujah and it's the Sun that
[1:03:31] brings maturity that's right and the sun
[1:03:34] does not mature the seed only it also
[1:03:37] matures the tears that's right
[1:03:40] Hallelujah that's why you see this these
[1:03:43] days people are coming out I have got
[1:03:46] nothing to do with religion
[1:03:48] I'm a sodomite they are coming to
[1:03:51] maturity where they identify who they
[1:03:54] are and the sons of God they are also
[1:03:58] coming to maturity I identify as a Son
[1:04:01] of God I am a daughter of milk is a
[1:04:03] taken we are coming out and declaring
[1:04:06] our pedigree here yes

[1:04:12] to tell the world who you are when you
[1:04:15] come to my children my brother my sister
[1:04:17] you are not ashamed you tell the world
[1:04:19] I'm a message believer I'm identified
[1:04:23] with the prophet I believe Malachi 4 5
[1:04:26] and 6. Hallelujah coming to maturity
[1:04:30] because the tears are coming to maturity
[1:04:33] that's right amen yes they celebrate
[1:04:36] being sodomite all this month we are
[1:04:39] celebrating the sodomites
[1:04:41] because I don't know I don't want
[1:04:43] YouTube to flag our video
[1:04:46] but you know the mystery
[1:04:49] yes sir Hallelujah
[1:04:52] praise be to God yes sir so it's the
[1:04:54] time of the Harvest amen now the sun
[1:04:58] brings the maturity that's exactly it's
[1:05:00] matures the wheat and it matures the
[1:05:03] tears amen because when they were
[1:05:04] planted the Angels said can we go and go
[1:05:07] and approach and Jesus Christ says no
[1:05:09] you approved the good seeds let them
[1:05:12] grow together at the time of the Harvest
[1:05:15] that's it I will send my angel and we
[1:05:18] will harvest the winter
[1:05:20] Hallelujah and what is matured is to
[1:05:23] come to a final desired State amen
[1:05:25] having completed natural growth heavy
[1:05:28] being ripe and most of the problems you
[1:05:31] find in the church is immaturity that's
[1:05:33] exactly oh this brother he took my seat
[1:05:36] oh this brother should not be a deacon
[1:05:39] oh maybe this sister you know she's not
[1:05:42] supposed to be singing just play
[1:05:44] immaturity
[1:05:45] hallelujah praise be to God when you are
[1:05:49] mature as a Seed of Abraham you prefer
[1:05:52] your brother better than yourself
[1:05:55] Hallelujah I am talking about maturity
[1:06:00] when you are green you walk with a red
[1:06:02] pen markings other people's mistakes
[1:06:05] exactly right oh that's the wrong key oh
[1:06:08] the wedding was not looking so good oh
[1:06:11] the colors were not planting well but
[1:06:13] when you are mature you say Lord help my
[1:06:16] brother is he singing Lord we thank you
[1:06:18] for our sisters waiting I thank you to
[1:06:21] my brother's jacket when you are mature
[1:06:23] you come up to Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:06:28] I am talking about maturity
[1:06:32] even in marriage you have to come to
[1:06:35] maturity you can't behave like little
[1:06:38] children like high school kids sometimes
[1:06:41] you have to come to maturity yes

[1:12:40] brother someone who is a slave to their
[1:12:42] feeling

[1:12:46] something that's it they can't help it

[1:14:16] I'm on slide four five off 30 but don't
[1:14:21] worry we're not preaching to finish we
[1:14:23] are preaching to to catch the mind of
[1:14:25] God that's her my brother Romans 8 verse
[1:14:27] 19 for the earliest expectation yes of
[1:14:30] the creature waited for the
[1:14:32] manifestation of the sons of God amen
[1:14:35] amen amen that we are they are not
[1:14:37] waiting for the creation of the sons of
[1:14:39] God but the manifestation of the sons of
[1:14:43] God Amen so God how how are they
[1:14:47] manifested the only thing that manifests
[1:14:51] a seed which is the Harvest
[1:14:54] if you look in the field yes sir
[1:14:57] Hallelujah yes everything will be green
[1:14:59] the wheat the tears but when you come to
[1:15:02] maturity of the grain then you the grain
[1:15:06] manifests itself that's exactly this is
[1:15:09] a wheat this is a tear so the
[1:15:12] manifestation of the sons of God Amen is
[1:15:15] the children of God recognizing who they
[1:15:17] are
[1:15:18] it was Ephesians says yes yes in the
[1:15:21] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:15:23] that's right and the promise says we
[1:15:24] have yet the dispensation of Moses where
[1:15:27] the disposition of Joshua but the name
[1:15:29] of this dispensation is called the
[1:15:32] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:15:34] Amen in other words is the seventh seal
[1:15:37] this position that's exactly right
[1:15:39] Hallelujah yes sir it's a dispensation
[1:15:42] where
[1:15:44] Hallelujah promises Mary was a type of
[1:15:48] Pentecost she was hacking the seed but
[1:15:52] she was not a cedar so the Pentecost
[1:15:54] denomination is not a singer she was
[1:15:57] hugging the cedar but this pride has to
[1:16:01] come to the become the seed of Jesus
[1:16:03] Christ
[1:16:05] Hallelujah yes my brother praise be to
[1:16:08] God glory to God
[1:16:11] the creatures are waiting yes my brother
[1:16:13] as soon as they see the sign of God they
[1:16:15] recognize that that's exactly they are
[1:16:18] talking about climate change
[1:16:19] that's not gonna stop it the only thing
[1:16:22] that's gonna stop it is you and me amen
[1:16:24] we hold the mystery of reversing climate
[1:16:27] change of reversing earthquakes and
[1:16:29] disasters are praise with the gods yes
[1:16:33] sir for we know that the whole creation
[1:16:35] grown up that's right and it's
[1:16:37] surveillance and playing together until
[1:16:39] now yes my brother amen yes sir but not
[1:16:43] only they but ourselves also we have the
[1:16:46] first fruit of the spirit
[1:16:48] even ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:16:51] waiting for the adoption now there's a
[1:16:54] spiritual adoption and there's a natural
[1:16:56] adoption the natural adoption is when
[1:16:59] the the celestial the terrestrial takes
[1:17:02] on Celestial body
[1:17:09] the prophecies
[1:17:11] but the true and false Vine are coming
[1:17:13] to maturity but before the wheat matures
[1:17:16] those ripened tears must be bound for
[1:17:19] burning that's why if you find people
[1:17:21] today you know bundling together that's
[1:17:24] exactly right tick tock with the
[1:17:26] denomination with the Catholicism I I
[1:17:30] heard recently
[1:17:31] the Catholic they said you cannot
[1:17:34] persecute sonomites that's what he said
[1:17:37] and the Anglican Church they had a vote
[1:17:40] and they voted against that they said we
[1:17:43] have to respect and honor the marriage
[1:17:46] of the sodomites
[1:17:47] so the dragon is speaking like the
[1:17:49] beasts that's exactly so that the peace
[1:17:52] get the Beast can speak like the Dragon
[1:17:54] amen amen because the the woman Jezebel
[1:17:59] she needs Ahab for her to enforce her
[1:18:04] religion that's exactly like amen right
[1:18:06] so when she has Ahab yes that's a
[1:18:10] mixture of of state and religion and
[1:18:13] when you mix those together you give
[1:18:16] Jezebel a sword and she becomes a red
[1:18:20] horse rider she belies a red horse so
[1:18:24] when the Catholic right now is powerless
[1:18:27] because it has got no other power to
[1:18:30] enforce
[1:18:31] but that she has to write on Ahab which
[1:18:35] is the Beast of Revelation 13. that's
[1:18:37] exactly which is this country
[1:18:41] amen right so she's writing this Beast
[1:18:44] right so they have to speak the same
[1:18:46] language
[1:18:47] that's the only way the woman can raise
[1:18:49] the beach that's right and they are
[1:18:52] coming to a convulsion that's exactly
[1:18:54] everything is maturing Israel is
[1:18:56] maturity she is recognizing a place
[1:18:59] that's what she's saying we are going to
[1:19:01] destroy Iran's nuclear silos she is
[1:19:04] standing in your place the denominations
[1:19:07] are recognizing their place the bride
[1:19:10] has to recognize a place amen
[1:19:15] glory to God yes sir adoption part one
[1:19:19] election looks better for knowledge and
[1:19:22] predestination looks to Destiny that's
[1:19:24] right now what is our destiny yes it's
[1:19:26] glorification that's our destiny praise
[1:19:30] be to God Amen
[1:19:33] most Vision he says it was white
[1:19:36] brightest snow this was not because of
[1:19:38] his age Jesus Christ the brilliant white
[1:19:42] yet does not signify age but experience
[1:19:45] maturity and wisdom
[1:19:49] Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the first
[1:19:53] shift waiver that was waived by God
[1:19:56] before the church that all the sons may
[1:20:00] come back to his full maturity that's
[1:20:02] exactly right Hallelujah yes my brother
[1:20:05] that was the purpose of waving the Sheep
[1:20:08] it was to symbolize
[1:20:10] that the rest of the Harvest that's
[1:20:12] right yes to come to this
[1:20:15] that's why we pay our tithes brother
[1:20:17] Brahm ties ties paying tithes to the
[1:20:19] Harvest we don't have time to go into
[1:20:21] into those things
[1:20:23] amen but those things are deep and
[1:20:25] spiritual
[1:20:27] amen hallelujah let me skip that preach
[1:20:30] my brother
[1:20:34] see what I mean God is coming soon to
[1:20:36] receive his church we must have that
[1:20:38] type of Christianity for him to receive
[1:20:40] the wheat yes to get the ripe yes all
[1:20:43] right yes that's the matter with the
[1:20:45] message today Christ is revealed in his
[1:20:48] own words in those who obtained it their
[1:20:50] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:20:53] sun that's exactly to get ripened see
[1:20:56] you can pick up the message and let the
[1:20:58] sun break all the greenness out of you
[1:21:00] yes my brother when you lay in the
[1:21:02] presence of them or the Holy Spirit and
[1:21:05] you let all the greenness go out of you
[1:21:08] all the immaturity or the gossiper or
[1:21:11] the black bitinger or the foolishness
[1:21:13] you let it go out of you
[1:21:18] but today people are not laying in the
[1:21:20] presence of them
[1:21:22] they are breaking in the present of
[1:21:23] Netflix that's it they are breaking in
[1:21:26] the presence of Amazon
[1:21:28] amen Hallelujah
[1:21:31] they want they won't call me after this
[1:21:33] but we have to preach it
[1:21:38] lay in the presence of the Son of God
[1:21:42] not tick tock
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] listen to the message of the Prophet
[1:21:49] that's it when you take a car for
[1:21:51] service on the outside nothing looks
[1:21:54] like this nothing that has changed but
[1:21:56] the engine will register
[1:21:58] the service is up to date when you come
[1:22:01] to church when you go out outside it
[1:22:03] looks like nothing has happened but the
[1:22:06] soul inside there is a check light
[1:22:08] inside the engine is up to surface
[1:22:13] Hallelujah yes my brother yes sir
[1:22:17] preach my brother I wonder how many
[1:22:20] inches today
[1:22:22] anyway let me not go there preach where
[1:22:25] for that I might I might be bold in
[1:22:27] Christ to enjoy that which is convenient
[1:22:30] yet for Love's sake I'd rather beseech
[1:22:34] thee now this is the story of in the
[1:22:36] book of Philemon now the book of I live
[1:22:39] on is a very interesting book very
[1:22:42] because in Philemon was an elder in
[1:22:44] Coliseum and he was you know he was you
[1:22:46] know he was the one the church was
[1:22:48] gathering in his house and he was like
[1:22:50] the pastor for that group and then there
[1:22:52] was this servant who stole some man and
[1:22:55] they ran away and under Roman laws that
[1:22:58] was cap that was capital punishment that
[1:23:00] was the realm the Romans did not want a
[1:23:02] Revolt so they were very strict with
[1:23:05] with slaves right so he read he went
[1:23:07] away and he went to to to to to Rome
[1:23:11] and when he went to Rome you know what
[1:23:13] he got converted
[1:23:15] amen amen and he met Paul sometimes when
[1:23:19] you are a seed no matter where you run
[1:23:20] no matter where you go the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] will find you out
[1:23:24] others can go in the world and they can
[1:23:27] get by with it but if you try to run
[1:23:29] away God will find you she will bring
[1:23:32] you back because you are the seat of
[1:23:35] Ibraham
[1:23:37] Jesus Christ said I have come to find
[1:23:38] the lost sheep of the house
[1:23:40] amen so when he was converted under Paul
[1:23:45] he was a type of you and me yes sir we
[1:23:48] were running away from God
[1:23:51] because of our sins that's right because
[1:23:53] of what we did but when we met Jesus now
[1:23:56] there's only one God I'm just
[1:23:58] dramatizing so that you understand
[1:24:02] was playing the part of Christ so when
[1:24:06] he met this young man in in Rome he says
[1:24:10] I I am going to send you with a letter
[1:24:12] Paul gave the young man a letter that's
[1:24:15] exactly Christ gave you the word
[1:24:18] and and he took this letter to to
[1:24:20] Philemon
[1:24:22] and Paul says listen Philemon all right
[1:24:25] whatever this young man stole from shoe
[1:24:28] that's right put it in my account
[1:24:30] whatever you owe sir put it in my
[1:24:33] account Jesus Christ said whatever you
[1:24:36] are put it in my account
[1:24:46] at one time he was useless
[1:24:49] but now he is useful that's exactly and
[1:24:52] his name was onismus now onismus means
[1:24:55] useful
[1:24:57] we were useless in the world when we
[1:24:59] come to the to Christ we become useful
[1:25:03] Hallelujah
[1:25:05] so he took this letter and he presented
[1:25:08] to find lemon and boy to sign with his
[1:25:11] own hands otherwise Philemon would say
[1:25:13] you know what I can't believe this this
[1:25:16] is something that you made up so Paul
[1:25:18] had to put his seal of vindication that
[1:25:22] it is not Paul that is it is
[1:25:25] but it is Christ who is speaking through
[1:25:29] this man hallelujah praise be to God
[1:25:36] glory to God
[1:25:37] and Paul says I have signed this with my
[1:25:40] own hands you see how big letters I have
[1:25:43] wrought because he had problems with his
[1:25:45] eyes so he would sign with big letters
[1:25:48] say poor
[1:25:50] amen and they they recognize the
[1:25:53] signature of power that this is poor
[1:25:56] this is legitimate yes sir amen
[1:25:59] he says good morning friends we
[1:26:02] recognize him
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:06] is now he says no
[1:26:09] I could I could command you Philemon to
[1:26:13] just accept this brother
[1:26:15] he says but now I'm old he actually says
[1:26:18] but now export the edged
[1:26:21] I'm now old
[1:26:22] I'm gonna use love
[1:26:24] I plead with you for my son amen when
[1:26:27] you come to maturity you don't force us
[1:26:30] your way into things huh you use love
[1:26:33] I plead for my son's sake please receive
[1:26:36] yes my brother please yes my brother
[1:26:39] says I have a right to command you
[1:26:41] because you owe me even my own life your
[1:26:43] own lives
[1:26:44] but because I am out
[1:26:47] mature I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you in
[1:26:50] love please forgive my brother onismus

[1:29:31] the seventh Church ages 54.
[1:29:33] the more I think of the Lord Jesus the
[1:29:36] more I begin to find out what is love
[1:29:38] that covers the whole thing the love of
[1:29:40] God said abroad in our hearts by the
[1:29:42] Holy Spirit
[1:29:44] the prophet says when I was a young
[1:29:46] Minister everyone who disagrees with me
[1:29:48] is out
[1:29:50] but when I grew up
[1:29:51] I learned that it stretches a little
[1:29:54] further
[1:29:56] anyone who doesn't agree with me is out
[1:30:00] that's not how you do it
[1:30:02] Peter said Lord
[1:30:05] how many times like you know
[1:30:07] just think of the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:30:10] it was Judas
[1:30:11] and just to see the maturity that was in
[1:30:14] Christ
[1:30:15] he knew that Judas was a thief but he
[1:30:19] never tried to expose him
[1:30:22] he made he made him the treasurer
[1:30:26] he made him the chairman of the trustees
[1:30:30] Hallelujah I am talking about Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ yes my brother
[1:30:37] no
[1:30:40] the Bible says that Joseph being a
[1:30:42] righteous man would not want to make his
[1:30:45] wife a public example
[1:30:48] why should you do that yes my brother if
[1:30:51] you are mature you live for your brother
[1:30:53] yes my brother yes sir Joseph said the
[1:30:57] right yes to say Mary you know what you

[1:31:16] you know men are dogs Joseph never
[1:31:19] did that
[1:31:21] he was a righteous man says I'm gonna
[1:31:23] put you away secretly and when he did
[1:31:26] that the angel Gabrielle came right
[1:31:29] there
[1:31:30] says Joseph fienna to take me with my
[1:31:34] wife when you have the right attitude
[1:31:37] God's Gonna explain things to shoot
[1:31:40] [Applause]
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:45] but when you are rough in your torn
[1:31:49] apart and Christ can speak
[1:31:53] he'll wait until you come down
[1:31:55] one time the prophet prayed for a a
[1:31:58] Believer and they died
[1:32:01] and said Lord wash God never said
[1:32:04] nothing
[1:32:06] after many weeks and months
[1:32:08] when he was calmed down Hallelujah the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost came this is the reason God
[1:32:14] does not speak to you when you are in
[1:32:17] that atmosphere
[1:32:20] Matthew
[1:32:21] that's exactly right preach my brother
[1:32:23] Hallelujah and brother Brahms is the
[1:32:26] Holy Ghost
[1:32:27] this is a quote I've never heard him on
[1:32:30] the discernment line I'm saying to
[1:32:33] someone you are in the wrong Church
[1:32:34] you never did that on the discernment
[1:32:37] that's the that that that the Holy Ghost
[1:32:41] amen the temperance of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:49] and the first time they will come forth
[1:32:51] for the bright age for a resurrection
[1:32:53] out of dark denomination will be a
[1:32:56] message
[1:32:57] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:33:00] turned back again it's full power and
[1:33:03] being waived over the People by the same
[1:33:04] signs and wonders the prophet was a
[1:33:07] shift way for our age amen amen amen he
[1:33:11] is his life was an example
[1:33:13] when All Shook Up you know she was the
[1:33:17] prophet looked at the atmosphere in the
[1:33:19] home
[1:33:20] he never said let me open the Bible
[1:33:23] let me give you a quote
[1:33:26] he took in he took the apron
[1:33:28] sometimes you need to take the Opera and
[1:33:31] he went to wash the dishes a prophet of
[1:33:35] dispensations
[1:33:40] come on tonight
[1:33:43] he could have said listen sister
[1:33:46] you know the angel I spoke today he
[1:33:48] never he never did that
[1:33:50] sometimes the prophet would greet a
[1:33:52] brother
[1:33:53] and the brother would say I love you my
[1:33:55] brother and the prophets will see a
[1:33:57] vision that he's lying
[1:33:59] he never said you know what you're lying
[1:34:01] your hypocrites you say I love you my
[1:34:03] brother God bless you my brother
[1:34:08] one woman says I want to straighten you
[1:34:10] out

[1:34:16] they just said all right
[1:34:19] you see you can straighten me out
[1:34:21] I Wanna Be Right you say it's it's
[1:34:24] attitude
[1:34:27] yes one time rely on the wood Banks they
[1:34:30] were driving a boat and they said if
[1:34:32] only we can you know go and tell this
[1:34:34] Jehovah Witness that we are now
[1:34:35] Christians the prophet says that please
[1:34:38] the Lord and I wonder our conversations
[1:34:40] tonight are they pleasing the Lord oh
[1:34:43] people are talking about American
[1:34:45] football
[1:34:47] they're talking about balloons and
[1:34:48] things
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:51] but when Elizabeth and Mary they were
[1:34:54] talking about Jesus hallelujah amen John
[1:34:58] received the Holy Ghost because of the
[1:35:01] conversations which they were having it
[1:35:04] was a mature conversation
[1:35:07] yeah
[1:35:09] it was not a competition no I have the
[1:35:12] best dress in church amen my husband is
[1:35:16] the best car
[1:35:17] I I went to the best Airbnb she knows
[1:35:21] this is my bucket list all those things
[1:35:23] are great but they have their place
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:28] but the sisters when they greeted they
[1:35:30] were greeting with the scriptures and
[1:35:31] quotations or Hail Mary full of grace
[1:35:37] Hallelujah
[1:35:38] press me to God glory to God
[1:35:43] and they were meeting Angels yes sir who
[1:35:47] said that Angels can't meet sisters
[1:35:49] angels can speak to sisters
[1:35:52] who discovered Malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:56] it was the woman sister media brush
[1:36:00] as a type of the church that the church
[1:36:03] Elijah will recognize the church but the
[1:36:08] church has to recognize Elijah
[1:36:10] remember the woman at Memphis Tennessee
[1:36:14] she said
[1:36:15] passion says how did you know that I'm a
[1:36:19] person
[1:36:20] Elijah was descending the hearts of the
[1:36:22] people but the bride deserves Elijah who
[1:36:25] he is
[1:36:27] Hallelujah
[1:36:29] is foreign
[1:36:35] to recognize Elijah
[1:36:38] you are Elijah
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:43] prince who do you say this is
[1:36:45] remember Saint oh my time is running out
[1:36:48] remember saint
[1:36:51] the first priesthood
[1:36:53] in the Old Testament in Hebrew chapter 7
[1:36:55] was the priesthood of of the Levites and
[1:36:59] Paul was separating the old and the new
[1:37:01] and the book of Hebrews is called the
[1:37:03] book of bitter things what's bocell is
[1:37:06] the Moses is better than Christ is
[1:37:08] better than Moses Christ is better than
[1:37:10] than Angels you know the other the the
[1:37:13] new the New Testament is better than the
[1:37:15] Old Testament you know and he says the
[1:37:18] priesthood that we have
[1:37:20] is the priesthood of Melchizedek which
[1:37:23] is declared by the power of an endless
[1:37:25] life yes it says but the former
[1:37:27] priesthood right was in Syria right
[1:37:30] because it was done by men who could die
[1:37:32] they would come back again that's right
[1:37:35] and it was a priesthood that was under
[1:37:38] the law that's right in other words it
[1:37:40] was a priesthood that was given to
[1:37:42] Israel that's right and the prophet says
[1:37:45] that Israel are always God's servants
[1:37:47] right but the but but but but we the
[1:37:50] Gentiles are God's brides and he
[1:37:52] actually says in 1961 that the 104
[1:37:55] 000 they are the eunuchs or the bright
[1:37:58] attendance that's exactly right they are
[1:38:00] Before the Throne but the pride is in
[1:38:03] the throne so that that Jews they're
[1:38:07] under the priesthood of servants
[1:38:10] but we are under the priesthood of Kings
[1:38:14] Hallelujah yes sir praise be together
[1:38:17] and because they were servants they were
[1:38:20] given the law that's why thou shall not
[1:38:22] do this thou shall not do things but we
[1:38:25] are under the priesthood of kings and we
[1:38:28] live by revelation
[1:38:31] foreign
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:43] but a son before he comes to maturity is
[1:38:47] not different from a servant
[1:38:50] but when it comes to maturity
[1:38:52] then he doesn't need to be told to come
[1:38:55] to church
[1:39:02] Oh Glory to Carter you don't need to be
[1:39:06] told to delete those filthy websites you
[1:39:10] are a son of God
[1:39:12] there were Slavs in a plantation and
[1:39:15] some of them were Slavs in detail but
[1:39:17] there was one that was different
[1:39:19] do you feed him different no sir no sir
[1:39:23] amen why is it different says because he
[1:39:27] comes from the order of milk
[1:39:29] where he comes from he's the son of a
[1:39:32] king
[1:39:34] Hallelujah he is under the author of
[1:39:37] Kings
[1:39:39] preach my brother
[1:39:41] amen yes yes the prophet one time was
[1:39:44] ever tap an echo he says I'm here in the
[1:39:46] Tabernacle I don't need to have a prayer
[1:39:48] life
[1:39:49] I think he was preaching adoption
[1:39:50] because the church was coming to my
[1:39:52] church amen no we still need prayer
[1:39:55] lines yes I don't want you to miss
[1:39:56] caught me you fine please but he says
[1:39:59] I'm just gonna run the first line he
[1:40:01] says receive with my sister receive it
[1:40:04] my brother receive with my sister but
[1:40:06] when it called we need to go to the
[1:40:08] Pentecost house
[1:40:09] you'd go like for 30 minutes your name
[1:40:12] is sorry and so because they
[1:40:15] they faith
[1:40:16] but but God says blessed are you amen if
[1:40:19] you believe without saying amen amen
[1:40:22] when you come to maturity to my sister
[1:40:24] when you come to my children my brother
[1:40:26] that you recognize I am a son of God
[1:40:32] you say brother Aaron
[1:40:36] ah
[1:40:38] my church there's this problem you know
[1:40:41] they should have done this they should
[1:40:43] have made this brother I trust him
[1:40:45] that's not a mature attitude
[1:40:48] the Lord bless our church
[1:40:50] we thank you for the men that are
[1:40:52] laboring
[1:40:53] and your attitude should be if I would
[1:40:55] do it I'll do a a West job my my brother
[1:40:59] he does a better job than me
[1:41:01] amen
[1:41:04] that's maturity
[1:41:06] and you mean it from your heart
[1:41:09] but if you want to do it
[1:41:12] then you're not the right person for the
[1:41:14] job
[1:41:15] because remember God is Not Looking for
[1:41:17] the gift
[1:41:18] he is looking for the spirit
[1:41:20] because Lucifer never lost his gift
[1:41:23] but he lost the right spirit
[1:41:26] give it to my brother and David
[1:41:31] the right spirit
[1:41:33] Hallelujah
[1:41:36] hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah

[1:42:13] even Jesus looked at pilate pilate said
[1:42:17] do you know I have power to release you
[1:42:20] Jesus says you have no power unless it's
[1:42:22] given from above
[1:42:25] he was mature
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:28] he suffered with Peter
[1:42:30] he was he was slow suffering with Peter
[1:42:32] yes don't do that Peter
[1:42:35] oh Peter come on Peter he was long
[1:42:38] suffering with the disciples he knew
[1:42:40] that the disciples were not converted

[1:43:48] that's what the prophet says yes my
[1:43:50] brother

[1:44:51] the power is too much you need something
[1:44:54] that brings you down a little bit
[1:44:56] you need a force of gravity
[1:45:00] that will keep you grounded
[1:45:02] God knows how to do things
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:09] praise be to God
[1:45:12] she is the greatest gift that God gave
[1:45:14] you outside of salvation
[1:45:17] you say brother Aaron I don't believe
[1:45:18] that
[1:45:19] well okay do you read about the Jews
[1:45:22] the prophecies that was the tender hand

[1:45:51] your life
[1:45:53] we send an F-22
[1:45:55] and we shut it down
[1:46:01] sometimes you need to declare a no-fly
[1:46:03] zone
[1:46:04] there is no one that flies a balloon
[1:46:06] over the White House
[1:46:08] the balloon one thing that I liked is
[1:46:10] that as soon as it came to the Carolinas
[1:46:13] it went all through the denominations as
[1:46:16] soon as it came to spoken word that
[1:46:19] should
[1:46:20] be done
[1:46:25] Hallelujah
[1:46:31] the devil must know yes
[1:46:33] hey man

[1:47:19] said he said we are preference
[1:47:24] let there be no Strife between us
[1:47:27] he didn't say you are wrong I'm wrong
[1:47:30] and you know what
[1:47:32] the herdsmen were fighting each other
[1:47:35] but the flocks did not belong to them
[1:47:40] like like ministers sometimes people
[1:47:42] fight each other but the flocks that
[1:47:45] belong to Jesus
[1:47:48] they are not even our flock they belong
[1:47:50] to God
[1:47:52] Jesus said Philip
[1:47:55] before
[1:47:59] brother Aaron testified to you I saw you
[1:48:04] so you don't belong to brother era you
[1:48:06] belong to Jesus
[1:48:09] Hallelujah
[1:48:11] and Abraham said if you go to the left
[1:48:14] I'll go to the right if you go to the
[1:48:17] right I'll go to the left and the
[1:48:19] prophet says a Christian will give his
[1:48:21] brother the better part of the deal
[1:48:24] that spiritual maturity
[1:48:30] some of these little deaths sometimes we
[1:48:33] just have to write them off
[1:48:36] sometimes just like to say don't worry
[1:48:38] about it my brother
[1:48:39] don't know what about in my sister
[1:48:44] it's not everything that you have to
[1:48:45] settle
[1:48:47] do you know four years ago you promised
[1:48:51] me peace yes you know especially sisters
[1:48:54] they've got very good memory
[1:48:58] I wish they could apply it to school
[1:49:04] glory to God
[1:49:07] Hallelujah
[1:49:09] no it's not bad they're a type of the
[1:49:12] church
[1:49:13] the church remembers the promise of
[1:49:15] Christ and it's our duty to remind
[1:49:18] Christ Lord you promised by your stripes
[1:49:21] I am healed Lord you promise I shall be
[1:49:24] the head not the tale Lord you promised
[1:49:27] in Isaiah
[1:49:30] amen amen
[1:49:33] amen and you can't blame the woman
[1:49:36] because the Bible says your desire shall
[1:49:38] be that of your husbands
[1:49:40] no even if you stay 24 7 with your wife
[1:49:43] you will not give you you have attention
[1:49:45] because you can't override the scripture
[1:49:49] your desire shall be that of your
[1:49:51] husband
[1:49:55] as a type of the church we always want
[1:49:58] more of Christ
[1:50:00] amen but Abraham
[1:50:02] he said we are brethren
[1:50:04] and the prophet says that Abraham was a
[1:50:07] dollar
[1:50:07] and lot was a penny
[1:50:10] but because Abraham was a dollar he did
[1:50:12] not strive with lots
[1:50:14] he was mature
[1:50:16] amen he long suffered and and when lot
[1:50:19] was in trouble
[1:50:21] Abraham never said I knew it you see I
[1:50:25] told you don't go there you see what I
[1:50:27] told you
[1:50:28] if you hear yourself say I told you
[1:50:32] you are wrong
[1:50:33] I don't care what it is you are wrong
[1:50:36] you should never say that a person must
[1:50:39] know in in their hearts
[1:50:41] something the Holy Ghost would deal with
[1:50:43] the person
[1:50:45] don't deal with a person let the Holy
[1:50:47] Ghost deal with a person amen amen amen
[1:50:51] amen I am talking about maturity friends
[1:50:55] Abraham when he saw that the Lord was
[1:50:57] captured when the prophet heard that
[1:51:00] Billy Paul was in trouble
[1:51:02] in the hospital he ran
[1:51:04] he never he just said Billy I'm here my
[1:51:06] son you know you know you you did
[1:51:08] something wrong just to confess to God
[1:51:10] he will help you he never condemned him
[1:51:12] and say you see what I told you I knew
[1:51:15] you were wrong you never did that
[1:51:18] that was the heart of Abraham lot is in
[1:51:21] trouble let me go and help my brother
[1:51:23] and many times the people that would
[1:51:26] curse brother Branham they'll be calling
[1:51:28] for him on their deathbed and sometimes
[1:51:30] with brother Abraham is putting a court
[1:51:32] to go and pray for them sometimes that's
[1:51:34] when they die
[1:51:36] amen sometimes even when people leave
[1:51:39] the church don't condemn them
[1:51:42] when Junior Jackson refused brother
[1:51:44] Abraham's Church order some of the
[1:51:46] people were saying these dead beings
[1:51:48] brother man says don't do that
[1:51:50] don't do that
[1:51:52] someone leaves the church don't say oh
[1:51:54] you're going to be lost you're going to
[1:51:55] just say brother if you if you think you
[1:51:58] can worship God better that's fine
[1:52:00] brother we are praying for you
[1:52:03] amen and in your prefer that
[1:52:09] and start you know no just obviously
[1:52:11] don't accompany yourself
[1:52:13] with the big sliders
[1:52:15] just give them their space I see
[1:52:18] sometimes people you know they want to
[1:52:19] go back to the big sliders they say ah
[1:52:22] you know brother I want to explain to
[1:52:24] him no don't explain anything just pray
[1:52:25] for them
[1:52:28] you know
[1:52:30] you know it's like you know brother
[1:52:34] just I'm not saying be nasty just be
[1:52:37] respectful to them but they have no
[1:52:39] company with them because they will
[1:52:41] contaminate you
[1:52:43] because if you sleep with a dog with
[1:52:45] fleas
[1:52:46] you find yourself scratching
[1:52:49] if we can stand up on our feet
[1:52:54] sorry friends this was a job that

[1:54:46] for us and you say yes did we did that
[1:54:50] tell you anything
[1:54:57] were you here on Sunday morning
[1:55:03] the reason why I'm saying this
[1:55:06] God is speaking the third time
[1:55:10] were you here on Saturday
[1:55:14] God is speaking the third time
[1:55:17] you need to be careful
[1:55:19] okay
[1:55:20] you need to be very careful
[1:55:26] it is a message that will make you
[1:55:28] tremble
[1:55:30] I'm not gonna comment anything
[1:55:33] you go yourself
[1:55:35] and we listen to this message
[1:55:39] and fix things where you need to fix
[1:55:43] Heavenly Father
[1:55:45] Lord we are approaching you humbly
[1:55:49] father trembling
[1:55:51] in our heart
[1:55:54] because
[1:55:55] of your awesome praises
[1:55:58] and your mercy for this church
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:02] father two weeks hard
[1:56:06] that demon power flying everywhere like
[1:56:10] I never felt it before
[1:56:14] until this morning that I felt so
[1:56:17] relieved
[1:56:19] and then I've seen the changes
[1:56:23] that have happened and I know I am
[1:56:27] Crossing
[1:56:28] and this church is turning
[1:56:32] a different direction
[1:56:35] that is going to head us toward the
[1:56:37] rapture
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:42] father
[1:56:43] I have not spoken to Brad Aaron
[1:56:46] he doesn't know a lot of stuff
[1:56:51] and if we do are careful to understand
[1:56:54] who's speaking
[1:56:57] we don't want to miss you Lord
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:01] but I can see the power that you have
[1:57:04] released
[1:57:07] it is not us
[1:57:10] you just chose us
[1:57:13] to be instrumental
[1:57:15] for you to vindicate this message
[1:57:18] that it was true
[1:57:21] there is nothing that we have in it
[1:57:26] you could have chosen someone else
[1:57:28] but you are very determined
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] and you're not even giving time
[1:57:36] you're not tolerating anything anymore
[1:57:40] because the time of maturity
[1:57:43] the time of adoption have come
[1:57:45] even the very scripture that I read in
[1:57:48] this church
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:53] father break the Stony heart
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:57] break the stubborn spirit
[1:58:00] break the complexes
[1:58:04] break the evil demonic spirit that have
[1:58:07] caused the shelter
[1:58:09] to resist the word
[1:58:15] so that the way can be open
[1:58:18] to free your children because this word
[1:58:21] was sent to deliver
[1:58:23] you are insisting the third time again
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:32] the devil taught
[1:58:34] he was undermining us
[1:58:38] the devil taught
[1:58:40] he who's in
[1:58:42] he didn't know
[1:58:43] that he got in the wrong spot
[1:58:46] and now you bidding me you are bidding
[1:58:48] him all the way up
[1:58:50] and nailing him all the way down
[1:58:53] that he's realizing that will happen
[1:58:56] after the 40 day of fasting is exactly
[1:59:00] what is in this church
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:03] it's not a playground
[1:59:04] [Music]
[1:59:10] father forgive your children
[1:59:12] [Music]
[1:59:15] forgive their ignorance
[1:59:18] forgive us all
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:25] father forgive our opinionated way
[1:59:29] so strong
[1:59:32] forgive the pride spirit
[1:59:36] forgive the big head
[1:59:42] let's that we be like wheat
[1:59:44] that the more we grow
[1:59:48] we can humble ourselves
[1:59:52] and realize who's working
[1:59:54] in the midst of his children
[1:59:58] it is our church
[2:00:01] it is our family
[2:00:03] it is our brother
[2:00:05] it is our sister
[2:00:07] the bonds that we have is more powerful
[2:00:11] than our biological bonds
[2:00:13] because this is the very little bonds of
[2:00:16] Melchizedek
[2:00:18] thank you for the rescue
[2:00:20] thank you for lifting up this thing
[2:00:23] thank you for resolving it completely
[2:00:25] father
[2:00:26] I thank you because I know that you're
[2:00:28] the one that start this work
[2:00:31] you will watch over it until I meet you
[2:00:34] into the air thank you for the strength
[2:00:38] father may your blood stand between the
[2:00:41] Devil he's taught
[2:00:43] he's in talks and your children and may
[2:00:46] you give them travel Mercy
[2:00:49] and may the spirit of humility wrap up
[2:00:53] your children
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] we thank you Father
[2:01:00] protect us on our way home strengthen
[2:01:03] our brother
[2:01:07] an anoint him again more
[2:01:10] like I told him in the office
[2:01:13] just few minutes I say when we were
[2:01:15] talking about brother George Martin
[2:01:19] I say God there is a big responsibility
[2:01:22] now Elders are going
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:27] and it's giving a big weight
[2:01:30] and responsibility on our shoulder to
[2:01:32] carry this all the way
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:40] we commit everything unto that hand and
[2:01:42] we thank you Father
[2:01:44] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:49] Hallelujah
[2:01:54] I'm pressing on
[2:01:58] the upward Way
[2:02:02] New Heights
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:09] still praying us
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:31] and let me stand
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:36] on Earth
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:58] my heart has no
[2:03:02] these are to stay
[2:03:05] without their eyes
[2:03:11] [Music]
