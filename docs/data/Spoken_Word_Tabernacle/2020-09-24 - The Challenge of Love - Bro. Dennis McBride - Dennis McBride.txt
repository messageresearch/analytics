lot you just pull on the gift and you'll see what the lord will do so we have brother mcbride he have to drive all the way from south carolina coming here to minister for us it's a great sacrifice a wonderful man of god has been serving god for a long time wonderful spirit i know him for quite a while and it's an honor for him to open his door to bring the part of the ministry the lord put on him to bless the bride because in this church we believe in the five-fold ministry amen let's sing only believe as brother mcbride comes back take your liberty preach like your home amen well long live

[Music] jesus [Music] and then let us all bow together [Music] heavenly father as we all are coming from different locations different activities different homes different atmospheres we didn't just come tonight lord god just as a ritual but became lord because we're in need of all of you you know each one of us father you know all about us you know all of our prayers the burdens that are upon our hearts the stresses the strengths the questions and by your grace lord as you've been working with each one of us throughout our journey in this life you've brought us to a place lord and you're still bringing us to a more of a clarity father god to realize that you really are the all-sufficient god there's nothing too hard for you [Music] you are present among us lord you're walking among us father you're within us heavenly father many times as we walk in life lord [Music] just by the course of life father we're not as mindful of that as we should be we're not as mindful of your presence but still you're there so father we ask tonight that you would help us help us in only the way that you can lord you know exactly how to minister to our hearts and lord we invite you tonight to just have your way [Music] we don't know what we need lord just like my children at home many times they think they know what they need lord or they don't really know what they really need and many times we may have a thought as to what we feel we may need lord but [Music] you know all things you know exactly what we need lord so i pray that you help us to be open to that and even if if it may not seem like it lord let us be prayerful that your will might be revealed that your word might be understood in our hearts and that we might receive something farther that'll help us a little more along the way we thank you for bringing us safely here and everyone that's traveled to this place god may you bless every soul lord the pastor of this church father lord i i thank god for him lord i've always thanked thank god for his spirit father such a welcoming brother lord such a wonderful spirit fathering and he's only stepping into what you already had in store it was your plan from the beginning father god but we don't always know until we step in so i just pray for his protection for his wisdom father for his guidance as he humbles himself lord god to lead your people by your spirit help us now we pray in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen let's give the lord hey man it's good to be here hey man it's been quite some time since i saw a few of your faces uh a lot of faces i i've seen i may not have been able to get acquainted with you personally but i've seen your face and i remember your face [Music] so i thank god for brother stephen a lot has changed the last time i i remember having an at length talk with brother steven he uh he was actually going through school to uh he was trying to complete the schooling for dentistry then i was listening to his voicemail his message and and it said doctor what's your last name brother doctor oh my amen so he successfully went through all his training so how long now have you been isn't that something wow praise the lord but amen it's good to be here it's a it's a good good spirit about the place not super spiritual and nothing like that it's just it feels good in here amen so that's that's that we thank god for that brother of mine so he greeted me out in the hallway right he had his mask on so i stood up and i greeted him and he looked at me and he pointed i was like okay say brother mcbride i said yes sir he took his he said you remember me i said your face looks familiar and years ago he was living in sumter right his brother brother i know brother jared jackson and he were friends and jared was witnessing to him and nonetheless he got baptized and then kind of went off the scene so now i see where he went thank god for brother lamont hey man so i know jared is going to be very happy hey man so i'll make sure i give you his number before i leave brother carlos hadn't seen him in decades ain't that good to see brother carlos and i know faces but not names but god bless each one of you my family they're at home right now streaming because i i actually attend brother anderson's church brother charles anderson so they're streaming the service there and brother uh steven sent me the link for this service but they were already you know kind of entered in so i'll make sure that they get it and they can take a gander at it a little later praise the lord amen but nonetheless let's get right into the words i know it's a wednesday night and uh and people still have to go to work on tomorrow i'm one of them but i will say this it's when when everything was together still over at living word i the times that i would actually come and minister there i was working third shift and so when i would finish ministering there i would go straight to work and i when i would get to work i would be i would get to work several hours late because third shift starts at about seven eight o'clock so i would get to work several hours late but my frame of mind was lord if you called me to this you would take care of me so i would come and i would do what i felt in my heart god wanted me to do and then i would get to work and we had a point system so i knew they would take points away and i was just kind of counting the points down in my mind because when you get to a certain point you get terminated so i was counting the points up and one day i was talking to my manager and i asked i said i just wanted to ask you so i can be clear how many points do i have remaining you know coming to work two hours late all kind of stuff you know she looked at me and she said uh don't worry about it you're doing a good work i was like excuse me i've been late and i know i only have so many points say she wasn't taking no points for me from me and she was paying me for the time that i wasn't there praise the lord [Applause] amen so you know that was god praise the lord thank god for brother kelly amen a real soldier i thank god for him and his wife amen and brother kyle he's not here of course but i always thank god for him all right let's get into the word now uh in our bibles let's turn to luke chapter six luke chapter six we want to start at verse 27. luke 6 and 27 he says but i say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and as you would that men should do to you verse 31 do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you he says what thank have you for sinners also love those that love them he says and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have you for sinners also do even the same and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have you for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again he says but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and listen to this and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil father let's pray once more heavenly father help us lord have your way we ask in jesus christ's name amen god bless your saints as a topic tonight i want to try to approach the subject of the challenge of love amen the challenge of love i want to start off by just kind of bringing this to your remembrance from the message of that day at calvary he says now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others it says that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine he says but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others he says it proved it when it come in the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others he says someone said how can't now listen this is we're not going to be long tonight and i i didn't i didn't come just like i said i didn't come for a ritual um you know sometimes we get used to coming to church and things of that nature but god is he's alive and he speaks and he has specific things that he wants to communicate to his people you see the devil sometimes gets in our minds and we get into these routines and things of that nature and we have these schedules you know when we become religious and i'm not saying that about anybody in here per se but it's just it's the way things go we become religious and then and and in church church loses its value it's we kind of go through as they say the formalities of it but our minds and our hearts are not really engaged like it needs to be and that's the devil's tactic he want to put any and everything on our minds that shouldn't be on our minds to distract us because he doesn't want us to get closer or to climb high in the things of god and man so tonight i i came to yield myself that god might help me because he's ministered this to me so when i'm communicating to you tonight is something that he ministered to me himself so it's a burden on my heart i just want to be a help and a blessing to somebody so now notice this real carefully he said someone said how can you stand he says let anybody call you such bad name now the devil knows how to punch he's been around for a long time he's a master psychologist if there is a such but he he knows the human makeup he knows the human mind and he knows how to work with each individual each one of our courses of life are different amen but we we each have a man he he strategized remember the prophet taught us that he studies us he studies how you respond the thing he doesn't know you per se but he can throw certain things at you and then he sits back and watches how you respond to he watches your habits and brother branham said he watches how you handle the word so he sees when you're not praying like well i'm i'm gonna make it like a you i'm gonna say we he sees when we're not praying like we're supposed to he sees when we're not in the word like we're supposed to be and when he sees that we're at that point he noted at that time we're most vulnerable if he comes in at that time he he can draw from us the response he desires pulling us into his world and his frame of mind but likewise god is doing the same thing when we submit ourselves to god we humble ourselves before god allow ourselves to enter into prayer and into the reading of his word entering into that right atmosphere those same trials can come to us but the response would be different because there is more of a control that god has over your mind and your thoughts your reactions would be different you can't put that on you can act it out for a while but when it's when it's man-made when it's by willpower it ain't gonna last it'll reach its limit a person will find themselves unzipping and what was being bottled up on the inside will come pouring out so the way god designed this you can't make it you can't satisfy his will outside of what we're talking about tonight it's impossible how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names he says you don't live for yourself even though this is brother branham speaking this is not brother branham speaking what you're hearing right now as i as i as i quote these things to you is experiences in a place that brother branham climbed into by the grace of god but it was through many hard battles he didn't always get it all right his life story has been well explained to us isn't that right when he had chances too amen he was going to shoot the bull isn't that right when he had chances too he was going to kill human beings a long hard road but every bit of it was for his good i don't care how rough your road has been what you've gone through every bit of it was needful for you to become the person that god had in his mind from the beginning he told brother bradley he said you chosen the right way it's a harder way but it's my way it ain't easy but it's worth it he says you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man casting your name out for evil amen this is beyond the human spirit when somebody has drugged your name and put your name out there spoken evil about you listen now this response that we we we can't study the message now you can't you can't study this and then when you're going through something try to remember what the prophet is saying no sir it's got to be by nature it's got to be from the inside of the inside they got to be a part of who you are so in these cases saints god listen god knows that we ain't going to always get it he knows that we're going to fail but in those failures god is helping us to see ourselves many times he got to deflate us sometimes we see ourselves in this place and we have such high thoughts of ourselves but god got to bring us to a place where we realize we are nothing you don't have no confidence in yourself amen brother branham said when god knocked paul down to that ground and his face was in that dirt he said that's where he was supposed to stay and that's where each one of us ought to go and to stay right there you live for others that you might redeem that man that's a whole nother thought they're persecuting you they're casting your name out for evil but the love of god is so in your heart until listen gentiles live like the old testament and i-49 are 2-4-2 if you talk about me i'm going to talk about you back uh whatever you do to me i want to get what we call it revenge amen but how many realize god don't work like that god will allow his children to respond like the world so while you're being talked about the spirit of god pulsating in your heart has you with thoughts of redeeming that person amen says we know how it feels when somebody hurts our feelings isn't that right when you catch wind of things of that nature you know how it feels it hurts you isn't that right you get caught up in your fear listen that's what the devil comes in you catch thing you catch wind of things that hurts you and that's very disturbing to your spirit and satan comes when you're in your long times or whatever and he ministers to you he tries to make you feel justified in in the way in which he's trying to lead you to feel you didn't even do nothing wrong with them all you've done was good why they talking about you like that why they handling you like that you have a listen you have a right you ain't got to say nothing to them no more you need to just avoid them as much as you can ain't the holy ghost remember he talks about living for others watch how he says these saints amen he says you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they are they were sons you're a son you're taking christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother branham i can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man isn't that how it rolls you meet somebody they got a good spirit about them very nice or whatever that kind of a person you enjoy being around that kind of person your mind's spending time with are doing things for they seem worthy of whatever it is you feel to do for them amen but watch how the prophet says this now he says well i can live for that brother because he sure is a nice man he says that's not it live for that man who hates you [Music] i'm talking about amen i'm talking about grooming of sons and daughters of god being raised up to step into adoption with the mind of christ with the heart of god that's able to handle the father's business appropriately amen he ain't asking us to do nothing that he didn't do himself he knew judas was a devil he knew he was going to betray him isn't that right but how did he conduct himself around judas he didn't slam the judas's name he didn't try to put nobody on to judas he let everything play out he let everything take his course amen now the brother said how hard was that for him to swallow that and knowing he was the one that was going to betray him but he held it that's what love of ducey i'm talking about a challenge of love i'm talking about god requiring something and then allowing your life to be set up in such a way where you encounter things that you have to overcome but the beauty of it is if he allow you to come in contact with it he gives you what you need to be able to overcome but you have to surrender well branham said you ain't even got a right to your own thoughts do you believe that let this mind be in you who's also in christ jesus amen he says live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them in the time that we're living in saints i've seen things that i never thought i would see and i know what god was doing when you're younger coming up in the way god knows you can't handle certain things amen that's why things that are happening now he didn't allow it to happen before you want to know why because he was nurturing his children he was building you up just like he did israel isn't that right he didn't take him the way he could have took them before amen he said that's when they saw battle they would repent and try to go back he took them another way so that they can gain experiences with him they can begin to know him amen in a way they never knew him before so that when they met them with their biggest battles they'll be fit now and ready to be able to move into it there's many things god kept us wrong amen i don't know about you but my battles now have become more and bigger than what i ever saw before amen but obviously if god is allowing that to come like that he knows you're ready for it greater is he it is in me than he that is in the world you ain't depending on yourself you need about this ain't about how witty you are how smart you are or how much you can retain or or none of that this is about the holy ghost dwelling on the inside of individuals that's able to yield to god that don't want their way no more you've died to yourself ashamed you've crucified your will you don't want your way no more you don't even know what you need no more every day you tell me tomorrow what you need where do you need to go where are you gonna go tomorrow well brother i'm gonna go to work that's what you say you don't know what tomorrow's going to bring throughout my course of life i've been laid off three times i was in the military for quite a period of time there what have you i didn't know what no layoff was in the military you just hired and you get paid and i get out here in the civilian world i got a good job making more money than i ever made before and all of a sudden i had a dream and in his dream i saw my team leader he was sitting at it that's what his back turned to me and in a dream it was clear to me that there was a layoff his name was vaughn height and i'm looking at the back of his head as he's sitting at this desk and in the dream i know it's a layoff but in my mind i'm saying man varna get ready to get laid off so i came to work the next morning he stepped out of the office and he looked me up he looked me right in my eyes he came walking toward me when he came walking toward me it clicked and all i could do things would smile i was getting laid off i got a family new car just bought a house i'm like late oh what is this i got bills to pay man i had a brand new 1999 nissan maxima first brand new car ever bought pearl white black interior stick shift leather the lord let all kind of stuff happen see i didn't know him but that was his way of beginning to deal with me and work with me so that i could begin to look at things in a different light now let come whatever's going to come it don't matter i don't know why because i've seen my god in action i've seen him provide amen i had time since well i didn't have no money and i needed a certain amount of money as a matter of fact when i bought that car i had eight hundred dollars property taxes that i know was gonna be attached to it i didn't have that money i'm like man where i'm gonna get this money from you know what the lord did i came from california that's why i was stationed at last i had a bank account over there in a bank called marine corps west my direct deposit never hit that bank i only use that bank to put a little money in that the cash checks from or the right checks from i get a bank statement in the mail from marine corps west from california at the very time i needed it you know what they said on that bank statement it said i had 800 in that account i wasn't working with much money back then so i know i know full well i didn't forget about eight hundred dollars so i got scared i said i ain't spending this money i know i ain't had that money now the council i'm gonna call the bank and let them know what happened i called the bank let the bank know what happened they searched it out called me back said miss mcbride we don't know what happened but that's your money i said well praise the lord was god doing since he was given experiences in each one of our lives we got many testimonies along that lines where god has come he's been revealing himself to you amen and you now stand in a better place than you did at the beginning you ain't the same person no more now listen i believe you're more equipped to meet the challenges than what you think you are we tend to lack a lot of confidence in that area but god knows what's in us i'm talking about the challenge of love i'm talking about god permitting troublesome hard situations allowing his children to meet them face on but by his grace and wisdom waiting until you were at a place to where you can actually handle them [Music] seeing his wisdom he reigns from ohio he knows exactly what's he what he's doing praise the lord that's what they done to him they killed him and he died he says that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them love like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards calvary praise the lord so the closer we get down to the end because we're in a rapturing time right now the closer we get down to the end amen we haven't seen nothing yet so we're all still able to gather here in this building amen have a little service have not nice little service going on or whatever all over the world the bride is gathering here and there but the time is coming soon when that's going to be stopped there are many things working right now much of which i'm sure god has made you aware of through various ministries that he's brought through and is bringing his word through whatever amen posting his bride as to where things are right now amen but our prophet had an experience where he went beyond the curtain of time and when he went beyond that curtain of time it was something that was told them it says nothing can make it here without perfect love [Music] so now that's more than just a feeling we're not talking about a feeling per se it brings a feeling but it's more than a feeling [Music] as the lord help us to understand in these last days since there's two different kinds of love right there's a familiar love and there's an agape love many times brother branham says we're deceived into thinking that we have a gospel love when it's actually filial love now there is a difference that he actually talked about praise the lord there is a distinct difference that he spoke about concerning this he says love should be governed should govern a home love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of a man he says the home should be disciplined by love he says if the husband and the wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other that's why i think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion he says which is all right or a gift which is all right like shouting speaking with tongues or with other things that we take for saying that that we have the holy spirit when we when we do the when we do this he says those things are all right but if we would come back to the principle love first and then those things i think our church will progress a lot faster if we would get god first and god is love he says now love is in two different words two different meanings in the greek one of them is called filio that's the lord that you have for your wife a golfer is a love divine love now the love you have for your wife and the love of god is so contrary with filial love you wouldn't be able to take persecution amen it's able brother barum said that that feeling of love is able to be accompanied by devils with feel your lord if a man would insult your wife he said you would you would desire to kill that man but with a god for love that same man it'll lead you to pray for his sinful soul so now two different things [Music] the things i've come in contact with saints convinced that what this prophet said here is exactly right people that proclaim to have godly love when you see how they handle other people and how people respond to things it shows you something is wrong [Music] amen if we've been guilty of gossiping if we've been guilty of gossiping if we've been guilty of saying things that would hurt another brother or sister's character they don't have to be bribed this is not a thing where where i know if they're blind see they deserve a certain treatment know what the bible says that god is good to the unthankful and to the evil the rain falls upon the just and the unjust he doesn't hold it back because it's a cocker barrel or a thorn bush he lets that same ring come down and bless their lives give them life but regardless of how much he allows his spirit to come down upon them their end is still going to be a bitter ink but as we're walking through this life regardless of how sticky somebody may seem to us amen we're supposed to treat them like we would somebody we did it all [Music] i'm talking about something that's beyond the flesh beyond the beyond willpower listen beyond learned behavior well even your listen not just refraining in your body well i'm not going to say that with my mouth but in your mind you're saying everything what we're talking about says is something that's real this is the very thing that god came down amen to die for [Music] we can't satisfy god's will with a feeling your love in a cultural frame of mind you can't do it it won't allow you to do it when you're talking about you'll find yourself talking back again however somebody help if somebody insurance you don't shake your hand you next time you see them you're out like you'll vote you'll go somewhere like you see something else somewhere avoid go around amen and god is watching you remember your thoughts are heard louder in heaven and your words are in the earth it ain't enough to sit to look the part and play the part you got to be it now what i found well the love of god is not present individuals are able to lock into a carnal frame of mind and they can't be shaken from it hardened hard heart they could can seem to be the nicest person just like brother brandon talked about that i think he took that pentecostal cannot believe he said as long as you're rubbing it in a certain direction it's all purring and everything you know how a cat do when you're when you're rubbing his back rolling with you and everything you know he said but you rub it the wrong direction and that's how some people are now i want to stop for a moment here and i want to say this that's okay if that's that's a person person's current state of being is actually okay because all god is doing is helping them to see who they are now if their bride when he shows them who they are it'll be a pricking in the heart [Music] it'll hurt them they're like lord have mercy on me what am i doing see when you're under the anointing of an evil spirit you don't think like that we're just reacting under a wrong mindset but the bible says when christ was reviled he didn't revile again listen science when he was being crucified he didn't have to try to say well i got a lot of people looking at me right now i know i know the bible is going to be written so let me make sure i say the right thing so people can hear me have a right response no sir when the nails with his hand it was killing him to breathe he said father listen for they know not what they do and that same power wasn't stephen amen when he was being killed stoned with stones that power of love the love of god whole saving that man the bible said he was full of the holy ghost and the bible says that the love of god is shattered brought in our hearts by the holy ghost and being filled with the holy ghost as he was being hit across the head and his skulls being fractured the very one is killing him it just flow come on somebody he says forgive them and our prophet in the spirit picks it up it says that god was doing that amen as a witness for what but there was a young apostle sitting right now blinded by seeing a witness brother brandon said when he came out of that experience he wasn't able to shake away from that too easy he said paul staggered like a drug man because he's seen such a life such a display he wasn't able to take away from that stephen was living his life for others that was eternal life on display and my question to you tonight is what does your life display it's a serious question this ain't something where you got to try to you know you know how it is you know you ask certain questions or whatever and everybody know what the right answer is supposed to be and they don't want to be seen as not having that right answer so everybody raise their hand and agree and whatever but i'm talking about where you really are see we're going down to where the rubber really meets the road now the rapture is an individual affair you can't fake it you can't put yourself into it you can't take yourself out of it if you're ordained for it it's going to happen anyhow so i want to encourage you tonight also no matter how you see no matter where you are right now you might say brother i don't mess up so much brother i i i i know my conduct ain't been good i'm guilty of this that and the other encouraged he says his word has gone out and it shall not come back to him void he said but it's going to accomplish it's going to accomplish what he's sending out to accomplish and it's going to prosper in the thing where until he sent it that's why you got to only believe amen so as i'm ministering tonight even if the word is touching upon your life in a certain way be encouraged and have faith in god amen by nature having the right response listen it's simply listen he says the baptism of the holy ghost is god in you living his own life through you so i don't i don't have a reason to doubt that we all in here have the holy ghost i don't have a reason to doubt that why would i want to think anything any different why would you want to go around and try to determine who's circumcised and who's not if your mind is in that place pull it back out pull it back into the middle of the road amen the bible says god is not willing that any man should perish but that all might come what to repentance so that life is on the inside of us who do we want to see fail or not make it who is it that we want to point our fingers at and say i told you so no sir god is displeased with that kind of a behavior that's not the behavior of raw it's bigger than that amen praise god it's bigger than that saints and he displayed it when he came down and he showed it to us amen even in our prophet god working with him in his life he had many things he had to encounter remember the one in particular where he was being hardly pressed by the attorneys and by the government in certain situations and i believe it was dr level the one of the brothers that were around him and they were all together and all of a sudden he got a call from somebody that was really pressing him i believe it was the government at that time concerning his taxes i believe it was and he's being pressed and he's under all this pressure and the devil trying to really get a hold of him trying to disturb his atmosphere pull him out of that place where god would be welcome how many realize that listen every day of our lives that's an atmosphere that we can create and you got to be very careful with that remember the holy ghost is timid you get to snarling like a wolf he said he'll take his flight he said but don't worry he's not far off he's right there waiting for you to become a lamb again so our prophet is in there and he gets a call of concerning these taxes again and one of the other brothers was a little hot-tempered look at hot-headed ready to give somebody a piece of his mind and when he saw it brother branham had received that call he began to react now brother brown i'm in his life god was grooming him amen bringing him amen he was growing in the things of god amen he was maturing amen growing up into that place amen the way he can more reflect the life of god even though he was the one under depression and the brothers response was real sharp and strong under that anointing of the holy ghost he said let him alone maybe the lord told me and when he said that saints supernaturally god came in and gave him a further instructions as to where to go [Music] what wrote that about his response to a phone call would you even have thought that god would have allowed that to be the thing that that determined among him receiving further instruction advancing in his ministry to fulfill more of the will of god a phone call and his response to that you might be at work tomorrow you don't know it could be any natural occurring situation and god allowed that thing to be specially designed for your advancement when he was having a service and god told him to be careful what he said isn't that right there's a trap the devil has set for you here come the young couple in there at an armory in the service hey man whatever you say that'll be what it is you say pack them out they'll pack them out you say blindness that's what it'll be amen but that brother had come up to such a place he didn't have no confidence in himself hey he wasn't being too quick with it but he said unknowing lord i don't know what that's exactly what had it right did hey maya she knew what to ask for she was just viewed as searching for the will of god that's all she wanted and then out of her mouth under those words which is right in line with the mind of god she called the spirit spoke god's will and we see the results not as prophetic standing there asking them to stop please this is a service please don't do that the devil pokemon it's the trap be careful what you say whatever you say that's what happened came to him again now he's standing there yielded not warning his own way died to himself he said the next thing you know i heard my mouth say i forgive you're not supposed to be in control amen that's what the third pool is all about it's not you in control it's not you saying whatever you want if you saying whatever you want guess what it'll just be mere words going out nothing will materialize but when the anointing of god when amen when you've humbled yourself and that anointing of god is resting upon you and you've yielded yourself so completely until that's all you want is his will [Music] can we say praise the lord says amen i'm talking about the challenge of love well you don't respond like the devil wants you to respond [Music] when you're being cursed you turn around and bless naturally like when you have a chance to place a black ball upon somebody's name you take advantage of it no sir it's not you living no more now that's a power it's the power of love himself the person with the love of god expressing himself through you now you ain't yourself no more now is christ on display perfect [Music] amen the beater of the gold has beat the goal and beaten the goal but the brandon said through trial after trial test at the test trial like a trial to bring his reflection into it you might say in your life right now brother i got it too hard right now too many things hit me left and right you don't know what's going on brother let me ride it it's easy to preach that brother but you ain't living my life those are excuses because the living god that we serve is able to do all things but you have to have a mind to want his will see that's why he has those things set up in our lives things to break us down break us down break us down break us down break us down till we get to that point and say you may have a desire amen christ was at gethsemane if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless let thy will be done and not mine isn't that right that's the place that god is pressing his bride into that climax amen amen that capstone praise the lord well he has full preeminence [Music] and he's able to he he's able to express themselves so clearly that's why they actually thought brother branham was jesus christ amen that brother's life was so surrendered and christ so listen brother branham said because christ knew who he was the word flowed through him when we realize who we are [Music] amen and allow ourselves to be humbled by god amen then we'll have that same testimony where the word of god will be able to come down listen no matter where you are no matter what situation you find yourself in [Music] you will come into such a place with god where god can actually flow through you that final witness and final voice to this final age we are that people do you believe that america greater received it is in you and he that is in the world when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will his saints and raise a standard empower his people to be able to rise above the tactics of the enemy and be able to overcome and step out victoriously the word of god how many believe you're the word of god how do you believe you're the word of god sayings amen you got to believe that trust god for your outcome it no matter where you are right now god is able amen amen i'ma stop right there let us all stand amen i believe you understand this ain't nothing you ain't already heard already it's just what was impressed upon my heart it's a challenge of love for you to love those that hate you too good to actually do good to those that do wrong to you pray for those from your heart that despitefully use you and persecute you the world can't they can't deal with this kind of a challenge here amen amen but god said it like that saints because he knew he was going to bring enemies into your life people that didn't like you people that turn on you all kinds of things going on but he's allowing every bit of it and he's sitting back and he's watching your response it's a teaching time it's a growing time praise god amen let us all bow heavenly father lord help us i believe lord in all of our hearts father we realize our great need for more of you the things that we've spoken about on tonight lord as we've said by your grace lord god is not humanly possible as our prophet lord god step into that cafe on that particular night during times of his service as lord you allowed him to step into that cafe lord and even though your spirit was anointing him at times at that particular time lord or wrong spirit came to a prophet [Music] and as he looked out upon the group that was within the cafe of the police officer at the slot machine and the elderly lady sitting with the two young men he began to have a critical spirit and he began to look out and he began to condemn [Music] he even he even spoke lord that that that why don't you wipe such off the earth so his little daughter wouldn't have to deal with it in that moment lord he forgot all about how precious life was he didn't have your mind at that particular time he was speaking by the mind of a devil causing him to look at your creation and even a daughter of god and the way you straighten your profit out you told him to step aside and as he stepped aside lord god the way you corrected him you begin to show him himself you begin to show him his own sins and how he needed forgiveness and how it was his sins that was causing the blood to fly as you was being here it was for him [Music] and you showed him a picture of himself that was your way of correcting your prophet lord and as he saw his own sins was causing you that pain and then he saw you graciously reach down and put your own blood right across his heart it made him feel good he was so grateful he began to give you thanksgiving but then you stopped him in the middle of his praise and told him you feel good because but she wants to feel the same thing your mommy got a change son she ain't she's a daughter you just didn't realize that because your human vision is limited you were proud you could see visions but you couldn't see in her life at that time i hid it from you so i could teach you a lesson lord no doubt we've each had lessons that's been designed by you that you've allowed us to come in contact and no doubt as the prophet father we found ourselves failed but lord it wasn't the end but it was something that we could learn from we could grow from lord we can realize our weaknesses heart we can begin to cry out to you to help us help us to be more like you lord [Music] and that's what you're doing even now for all of your children that are here tonight god i i pray for us all help us all lord god we we've all had hard battles lord we've all received scars wounds of the mind many things are hard sometimes to get over lord god but lord that the healing power of love is here lord to saturate every one of our lives lord god and bring about a man a healing lord fixing our visions heavenly father so that we can even look upon those that may have been amen guilty of the wound lord god but we can look at them with redeeming eyes [Music] desiring desiring redemption for that brother or that son of the lord desiring to pray sincerely from our hearts heavenly father [Music] amen not for revenge not crying out for their blood crying out for mercy father crying out for forgiveness [Music] this is who you are lord and we thank you for expressing this to us on tonight as we humble our hearts to your lord each one of us [Music] help us to humble ourselves we thank you for being here with your people lord heal us father [Music] healed us lord and savior jesus christ we ask these things [Music] within me [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

salvation [Music] and we knew a right spirit [Music] oh we bless you lord jesus speak to the lord in your own we believers the lord has expressed his taught us oh lord god we express our hearts back

love and make me more let's sing it one more time as we express our hearts to our lord jesus make me more like you lord [Music] jesus jesus make me more like me give me thy heart that's filled with love give me a heart that's filled with hallelujah hallelujah the challenge of love how many enjoy the service tonight praise the name of the lord i believe you can see how the holy spirit is orchestrating everything god is calling you to a high calling and that high calling there was something you need to tweak a little bit the challenge of love we spoke about how we've been hurt how we've been treated bad but there was one thing that caught my attention when he said when a challenge came or come to you you need to understand that it's the time appropriate for you to handle it in other words it's a language of god we usually want god to speak like in an audible voice like calling you abraham abraham god speak in many different ways so if a challenge is facing you it is a time appropriate that god deemed necessary and see you fully equipped to handle that challenge so don't back up don't get frustrated just relax and let the holy spirit take over the brother didn't even know what we preached here we went through many challenges hard one and i remember talking to brother robert he said brother stephen you're going to a challenge of the third pool just like he was given to brother branham to speak the word and he spoke about the same thing tonight not even knowing why why it didn't happen years ago why because you are maturing you underestimate yourself more than what god sees you god is seeing a bride with potential god is looking at a broad predestinated fully equipped he's bringing you to a high calling because there is something in you that is already prepared for the occasion for the time for you to handle business i don't know why last sunday i stopped not even touching the seal the signet of judah it was because of this sermon because the signet of judah gives you a power to seal something you have a right to enforce something and it's gonna happen and that power need to be handled by love because if you enforce death death is gonna happen to somebody if you enforce life life is gonna happen to somebody the power of that signal god wants me to stop where i have to stop open a door for a family member preacher to come and insert the love of the third pool so you understand forget about those things behind you get clannish but always keep that arm out that arm of love to meet the challenge and to pull whoever is redeemable according to the plan of god god richly bless you may he continue to bless us may he protects our families many things happening here and there god knows one of this day we're gonna see our loved one may the holy spirit strengthen you may he keep you on the road may the blood protect our family wherever they are our bride family may you protect the bride family continue to pray continue to consecrate yourself continue to release yourself continue to relax there is nothing you have to do in this thing you don't have to work on it there is no work you don't have to sweat you don't need your wool you just need to relax put on neutral and let god drive you through i was talking to a brother actually communicating with him on uh on a text i told him i said you know when you enter the car wash you usually pay a price there are you there you go to the gate first and you have to pay the price and when you enter you put neutral because the wash you're gonna have is gonna be according to the amount of money you paid and our price was paid in calvary it was a full price for redemption so don't even worry the car wash you're gonna receive the washing you are receiving it's already programmed according to the price that crushed paid on covering you're gonna come out as bright without spot or wrinkle it's already paid for you don't have to worry whether your tyre will shine tire shine is in it red repellent is in it soap is inside water is inside just put your car in your jar and god will take you through and we will see together each other on the lord's table god richly bless you let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy lord father this is not a human intelligence orchestrating this church it is not me father it is the supreme intelligence of the holy spirit lord orchestrating even the ministers coming here in their law even the sermon that is coming in here lord father because we're going through a ragged training lord father knowing that we have a greater task that need to be handled by love father thank you for letting your servant come driving all the way from south carolina to come and bless us lord father bless your children lord that made some sacrifices some effort lord some of them were tired they were coming to church tonight lord some of them would have to drive straight from work lord coming here lord father look at every single sacrifice even those that were willing to come but they could not because of work and they have to stream lord father home lord may you be mindful also to them father bless them lord protect us under your blood lord prepare our hearts for more consecration as we gather together the lord father on sunday if that terror you come lord father we thank you and commit everything in the name of jesus christ amen god with you bless you we see you again on sunday amen hallelujah make me more like you amen [Music]
