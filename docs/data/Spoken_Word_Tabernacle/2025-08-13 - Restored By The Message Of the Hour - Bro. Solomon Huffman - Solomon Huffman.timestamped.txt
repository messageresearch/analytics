[0:00] Super science.
[0:04] Do you see it?
[0:07] God made manifest.
[0:11] God presenting himself
[0:14] to the world as a fugitive.
[0:19] Could have come some other way,
[0:22] but chose to come this way.
[0:25] Listen to this.
[0:28] Don't miss it.
[0:31] I think that God had in his mind it
[0:34] would be appealing to the human being.
[0:40] It is to the believer.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; It is appealing when our God becomes one
[0:46] of us.
[0:48] Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; But to the starchy,
[0:54] ungodly,
[0:56] a stumbling block,
[0:59] I'll give you the sign.
[1:02] A virgin shall conceive.
[1:05] Emmanuel will be with you.
[1:10] God thought it would appeal to the human
[1:12] race that our God would be one of us.
[1:16] That he would cross himself and become
[1:17] our dust. That he would become our
[1:20] stock,
[1:22] a human stock, the creator who made all
[1:25] things.
[1:28] And again,
[1:30] it fulfilled prophecy.
[1:34] The prophets had saw it.
[1:36] And another thing,
[1:39] the word was made dust flesh and dwelt
[1:43] among us.
[1:46] The Jehovah,
[1:48] the word
[1:50] became human,
[1:53] became dust
[1:55] and tabernacle with us.
[2:00] Everlasting sign shall never end.
[2:07] Oh, when we think of it,
[2:11] an eternal sign,
[2:13] the super signs of all signs,
[2:17] God becoming one of us.
[2:21] Then again, he must be the seed of
[2:22] Abraham. Abraham was of course the seed
[2:25] of Eve.
[2:27] Eve was a woman seed that was to bruise
[2:29] the serpent's head. But Abraham, if you
[2:32] can catch it, he had faith in God, which
[2:36] united the spirit of God with the flesh
[2:39] of man.
[3:12] He never defiled or contradicted any of
[3:15] his laws.
[3:18] He cannot do that.
[3:20] So virgin, I'll give you a sign.
[3:25] Not a Titanic,
[3:28] not a UN,
[3:30] but I'll give you a sign of safety.
[3:34] A virgin shall come to you,
[3:38] and she shall bring forth a son and call
[3:42] him Emmanuel.
[3:44] That's the sign.
[3:48] Yes.
[3:49] You see, in God's laws of redemption,
[3:53] as it was with Boaz and Nema,
[3:58] it had to be a near kinsman.
[4:02] And the only way that man could be
[4:04] redeemed,
[4:06] God had to become a kinsman
[4:09] near.
[4:11] I want you to see it.
[4:15] He never become kin folks altogether to
[4:17] the rich to the mighty but he was
[7:42] Amen.
[7:49] Amen.
[8:00] An honor you deserve, Lord Jesus. Oh
[8:02] God, Father, we thank you for bringing
[8:05] us, oh God, to your presence once again.

[9:28] Lord, and we bless you. We give you all

[9:41] Tonight we want to take the song,
[9:44] there's a fountain filled with blood.
[9:46] Amen. Amen. We can never do without the
[9:50] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[9:55] There is
[9:58] a fountain
[10:01] filled
[10:03] with blood
[10:05] drawn from
[10:09] Emmanuel

[1:05:44] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[1:05:46] your grace upon our lives, Lord. And we
[1:05:49] just want to take a moment to worship
[1:05:50] you and to thank you, Lord, for the
[1:05:52] great things that you have done, Lord.
[1:05:54] Truly, you're Jehovah Gyra, Lord. You
[1:05:56] provide all of our needs. Lord, you're
[1:05:59] Jehovah Shama. You're Jehovah Sid Canu.
[1:06:02] Lord, you're Jehovah Rafa. You're
[1:06:04] Jehovah Shalom. And you're the Lord
[1:06:06] Jesus Christ. And Lord, it was all
[1:06:08] wrapped up in that wonderful name, Lord.
[1:06:10] And we just worship that great name,
[1:06:13] Lord. We thank you, Lord, for the
[1:06:15] revelation of who you are, Lord, in this
[1:06:17] end time message, Lord. There's a world
[1:06:19] out there that is preaching another
[1:06:21] Jesus. But Lord, the seals have been
[1:06:23] torn off the book, Lord. And we see you
[1:06:25] plainly in your word. And we thank you
[1:06:28] for the revelation that you've given us
[1:06:30] in the hour we're living in. Lord, we
[1:06:32] pray, Lord, that you would forgive us,
[1:06:35] Lord, if we've said or done anything
[1:06:36] that's displeasing to you, Lord. May you
[1:06:39] just wash us by the water of your word
[1:06:41] tonight, Lord. May you cleanse us, Lord.
[1:06:43] Lord, as the high priest would be there
[1:06:45] sprinkling the blood upon the
[1:06:47] congregation. Lord, we know that we are
[1:06:49] washed by the water of your word. I
[1:06:51] pray, Lord, that you would have
[1:06:53] preeminence in this service tonight.
[1:06:54] Lord, we didn't come just to sing good
[1:06:57] songs or to see or to hear from one
[1:06:59] another, but Lord, we come to hear from
[1:07:01] heaven tonight, Lord. And we pray that
[1:07:03] you would just speak to us your word for
[1:07:05] the hour we're living in. Lord, you you
[1:07:07] made an appointment, Father, before the
[1:07:09] foundation of the world that we would be
[1:07:11] here in this place, Lord. And and you
[1:07:14] plan to be here also, Father. So, we
[1:07:16] thank you, Lord, that you're here in our
[1:07:18] midst, Lord, according to your word. We
[1:07:20] now yield ourselves to you, Lord. I
[1:07:22] yield everything I am to you. May you
[1:07:24] just use what's here, Father. My My
[1:07:26] body, my spirit, my soul, Lord, it's
[1:07:28] yours, Lord. We just give this service
[1:07:30] to you for your glory and for your
[1:07:32] honor. we pray in the most mighty name
[1:07:35] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[1:07:39] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll
[1:07:40] just go straight into the word. And uh
[1:07:43] we don't want to keep you too long
[1:07:45] tonight. Um I tell you, sometimes it's
[1:07:48] just good to break tradition, isn't it?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good just to break the
[1:07:55] mold a little bit and to loosen up.
[1:07:58] Amen. We're not here to be a formal
[1:08:00] church.
[1:08:01] And

[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; and pre maybe preach just a little bit
[1:08:08] longer.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we we all we all we all
[1:08:14] love those quotes where the prophet said
[1:08:16] a a good a good sermon was about 45
[1:08:18] minutes, but we forget the quotes where
[1:08:21] where he said if you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:23] you could stay all night.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we We don't want to
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:08:35] Lord. We don't want to keep you all
[1:08:36] night tonight, though.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We do want to obey the Holy
[1:08:41] Spirit. Whatever God has is what I want.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And if you don't want something, move
[1:08:45] out of the way. I'll get what you don't
[1:08:47] want.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Uh let's read in the word if you will.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Uh if you have your Bibles, turn with me
[1:08:56] in the book of Malachi and the fourth
[1:08:58] chapter. Oh yeah.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And uh also Joel the 2 chapter as you're
[1:09:03] turning there. I don't want to forget to
[1:09:04] to greet you tonight. I was speaking
[1:09:06] brother Josh on the phone earlier and he
[1:09:07] said to be sure and greet the church
[1:09:09] here and send his greetings to brother
[1:09:11] Steven and uh our sister church here. We
[1:09:14] say God richly bless you. And I'm glad
[1:09:16] to have my wife Gabrielle and our our
[1:09:18] baby girl back there. And we're just
[1:09:20] looking forward to what God has in store
[1:09:21] for us. And so let's read here together
[1:09:24] uh Malachi 4 and5. Very familiar
[1:09:26] scriptures. The Bible
[1:09:28] says this, "Behold, I will send you
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I will send you Elijah the prophet."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the you part is just as
[1:09:39] important as the Elijah part.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there was no you, there would
[1:09:44] no be there would not be Elijah. So, God
[1:09:47] sending somebody the prophet, unto you,
[1:09:50] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:09:53] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:09:56] Now, notice what this Elijah ministry is
[1:09:58] going to do. And he's going to turn the
[1:10:00] heart of the fathers to the children,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; and the heart of the children to their
[1:10:06] fathers,
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:10:09] curse.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Turn also, if you will, in Joel the 2
[1:10:14] chapter, sir,
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; and the 25th verse. These scriptures, I
[1:10:18] think, would often be linked together in
[1:10:20] many message sermons. In Joel 2 and 25,
[1:10:24] the Bible says this, "And I will restore
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; to you the years." Now, now you got to
[1:10:31] just read that scripture slowly.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And there's just so much packed in the
[1:10:35] word. Every every script, the prophet
[1:10:37] said if you couldn't find Christ in
[1:10:39] every verse to go back and reread it.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; So when he says, "And I," who is that
[1:10:44] talking about? That's talking about God
[1:10:46] himself.
[1:10:48] I will restore to you the years that the
[1:10:51] locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the
[1:10:53] caterpillar. Amen. The prophet showed
[1:10:55] you that was the same bug, just in
[1:10:57] different stages,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; my great army which I sent among you.
[1:11:01] And ye shall eat in plenty
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. And praise the name of
[1:11:06] the Lord your God. So, so God's
[1:11:08] children, they're not going to be
[1:11:09] starving to death. They're not going to
[1:11:11] be anemic, but according to the word,
[1:11:13] they're going to eat in plenty
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. I don't know about
[1:11:18] you, but I am so satisfied with the
[1:11:21] message for my day.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; And notice what they'll do. And they'll
[1:11:25] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:11:28] that hath dealt wondrously with you. And
[1:11:31] my people shall never be ashamed. And ye
[1:11:34] shall know that I'm in the midst of
[1:11:36] Israel, and that I am the Lord your God,
[1:11:39] and none else. and my people shall never
[1:11:42] be ashamed.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask that God would bless
[1:11:45] his word as you can have your seats
[1:11:47] tonight. And uh I want to take a subject
[1:11:49] from these scriptures here and speak to
[1:11:51] you on restored by the message of the
[1:11:53] hour.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Restored by the message of the
[1:11:56] hour. And I I believe that uh we're a
[1:11:59] people that have the true revelation of
[1:12:01] what restoration is. And I I believe
[1:12:04] with all my heart we have been restored
[1:12:05] back to the original faith. And I
[1:12:07] believe we're living in the time that
[1:12:09] all things have been restored. And
[1:12:11] brother Brandon would say this in
[1:12:12] questions and answers in 54. He said,
[1:12:15] "We're living in the last days. We're
[1:12:17] living in the days that God spoke would
[1:12:18] come. We're living in these days." He
[1:12:20] said, "And we're living in the time that
[1:12:22] regardless of what we try to think about
[1:12:24] it, God's word says we are
[1:12:26] predestinated." That's right. And what
[1:12:28] God has called will come to God. And
[1:12:32] what God doesn't call will not come to
[1:12:35] God. So if you're called of God, there's
[1:12:37] not a devil in hell that can stop it. If
[1:12:40] you're predestinated before the
[1:12:41] foundation of the world, God knows
[1:12:43] exactly where to find you. Amen. There.
[1:12:47] Amen. God God don't have any children
[1:12:49] that's lost where he don't know where he
[1:12:51] is. And and I believe that if you're
[1:12:53] predestinated by God, God will do
[1:12:55] whatever he has to do to get you in the
[1:12:58] spot where he can restore you. And you
[1:13:00] say, "Preacher, what are we being
[1:13:01] restored back to?" I believe we're being
[1:13:03] restored back to the image that God had
[1:13:05] of us in his great mind before the
[1:13:08] foundation of the world. And I believe
[1:13:10] that was an image of perfection. Amen.
[1:13:12] It was not just you at 21 years old
[1:13:15] because maybe you at 21 years old had
[1:13:17] problems and had issues and and had all
[1:13:20] these things. But I believe it's an
[1:13:21] image of perfection. And I believe that
[1:13:24] God has sent us a perfect word that's
[1:13:27] going to restore us back to perfection.
[1:13:29] See? Amen. If we did not have a perfect
[1:13:32] message, we could not come back to a
[1:13:34] perfect condition. But because God has
[1:13:37] sent us a perfect message, amen, it will
[1:13:40] bring us back to a perfect condition.
[1:13:43] And I I believe that the faith that was
[1:13:45] once delivered to the saints has been
[1:13:47] restored back to the church of the
[1:13:49] living God. I believe that the fullness
[1:13:51] of the Holy Ghost has been restored back
[1:13:54] to the church of the living God. You
[1:13:56] believe that here with me tonight? You
[1:13:58] say, "How? What? What do you mean the
[1:13:59] fullness of the Holy Ghost? The prophet
[1:14:01] showed us. He said the Holy Ghost was
[1:14:04] bound, amen, by denomination and by
[1:14:07] creeds and by Amen. by dogmas and all
[1:14:10] these things. He said, but in these last
[1:14:12] days, the fullness of that Holy Ghost,
[1:14:15] he's no longer bound in the church, but
[1:14:18] but he has been loosed by the word
[1:14:21] that's come in the age we're living in.
[1:14:23] Amen. This is not just partial Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost. This is the fullness of the Holy
[1:14:28] Ghost. Listen, if you're lacking
[1:14:30] anything, it's because you're not
[1:14:32] receiving what God has for you. I say,
[1:14:35] Lord, I want to receive you in your
[1:14:37] fullness. I want to receive everything
[1:14:39] you have for me and nothing less than
[1:14:42] what you have for me.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the scriptural
[1:14:47] balance of all things has been restored.
[1:14:49] Amen. Amen. You you you you think about
[1:14:51] in the prophet's time the church they
[1:14:54] was either far off in left field or far
[1:14:56] off in right field and he would get
[1:14:58] amongst the Pentecostals and he said see
[1:15:00] they were so far in emotionalism they
[1:15:02] said well the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:05] is speaking in tongues or or if you
[1:15:07] shout or you had a chill bump and the
[1:15:09] prophet preached against that he said
[1:15:11] see what they're doing is they're
[1:15:12] majoring on emotionalism.
[1:15:15] Amen. You got people that come up and
[1:15:17] say well you know I tell you brother we
[1:15:19] had just church tonight. We we just had
[1:15:21] church and it was so good of a church
[1:15:23] that that the preacher didn't even get
[1:15:25] to preach. Now now now what is that?
[1:15:27] That's being focused on on on work up on
[1:15:31] emotionalism. Listen, if you don't plan
[1:15:33] on preaching, don't ask me to come. I
[1:15:35] Amen. Listen, I I can worship in my
[1:15:38] home. I can sing in my home. Amen. We
[1:15:40] come here. Is that okay?
[1:15:43] We come here to hear the word of God.
[1:15:46] Amen. preached in power and preached in
[1:15:49] demonstration. Amen. What do you mean
[1:15:51] you had church, but you didn't have no
[1:15:53] word? You don't got no church till you
[1:15:56] got the word in that church. Amen. And
[1:15:59] that's what stirs the bride up. It is
[1:16:02] the stimulation of the revelation of the
[1:16:05] word for her age. Amen. It's not
[1:16:08] emotional work up. Amen. I'll agree with
[1:16:10] you. We're worked up, but it ain't the
[1:16:12] same thing you're worked up over. You're
[1:16:14] worked up over from sensations. Amen.
[1:16:17] And emotion and all these things. But
[1:16:19] I'm worked up over the same thing that
[1:16:21] John is worked up over. Amen. The
[1:16:23] prophet said that he looked in that book
[1:16:26] and the prophet said he must have saw
[1:16:28] his name in that book. Amen. Hey, it was
[1:16:32] the opening of the word that revealed to
[1:16:34] you that you was in God before the
[1:16:37] foundation of the world. Amen. Don't
[1:16:40] tell me to quieten down and hold my
[1:16:42] peace. I found where I belong. I found
[1:16:45] who I am. Amen. I come from God and I'm
[1:16:49] going back to God. And God has restored
[1:16:52] to me the identity that belonged to me
[1:16:55] that was in God before the foundation of
[1:16:58] the world.
[1:17:00] Absolutely. Say, "I don't got no
[1:17:02] identity outside of this message." Amen.
[1:17:04] Don't call me, Amen, some Baptist or
[1:17:07] Methodist or or a blasphemous name.
[1:17:10] Amen. But you call me Miss Jesus. Amen.
[1:17:13] That's the identity that's been restored
[1:17:16] back to the church of the living God.
[1:17:19] Amen. It's a scriptural identity that's
[1:17:21] been restored. And I believe this
[1:17:22] message has restored us back to the
[1:17:24] middle of the road.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not on far left field and
[1:17:28] it's not on far right field. And people
[1:17:31] come and say, "I tell you what, you
[1:17:32] know, y'all are just legalistic." And
[1:17:34] there's so much legalism amongst the
[1:17:36] message. And I think of something.
[1:17:38] They'll call you legalistic when you say
[1:17:40] what a prophet said. They'll call you
[1:17:42] legalistic when you just quote the
[1:17:44] prophet. Amen. I'm not legalistic.
[1:17:47] You're just an unbeliever and you don't
[1:17:49] believe what God spoke through that
[1:17:51] prophet because you want to argue with
[1:17:53] it and you want to find I'm not
[1:17:55] legalistic. I just believe what God has
[1:17:58] sent me in the eye I'm living in. And
[1:18:01] the difference is you don't believe what
[1:18:04] God has done. Well, I might as well just
[1:18:07] preach for a moment. Amen. The reason
[1:18:09] you call it legalism is because you
[1:18:12] ain't ever had a new birth and you ain't
[1:18:14] never been born again and you ain't
[1:18:16] never been sanctified and you still got
[1:18:19] the desire to do those things that is
[1:18:22] anti-Bible and anti- message and it's
[1:18:25] easier for you to point your finger and
[1:18:28] say I'm legalistic than for you to go to
[1:18:30] an altar and to die to yourself.
[1:18:35] I say, "Who's wrong? God's word or you?
[1:18:38] Who's wrong? God's prophet or you?" I'll
[1:18:40] be the first to tell you, you're wrong
[1:18:42] and I'm wrong. Your ideas are wrong and
[1:18:45] my ideas are wrong. But the message of
[1:18:48] the hour is the truth. I'll stake my
[1:18:52] soul on it and I'll preach it till the
[1:18:54] day I die. Amen. This message is the
[1:18:57] unadulterated,
[1:18:59] vindicated truth of Almighty God. And if
[1:19:03] you don't like it, you're in the wrong
[1:19:04] church. If it's too strong for you, you
[1:19:07] ought to go to the church down the
[1:19:08] street. Amen. But listen, we played
[1:19:10] along with the word for long enough. I
[1:19:13] believe it's time. Let's believe every
[1:19:15] word of it. And you watch the glory of
[1:19:19] God coming in behind that. Amen. The
[1:19:21] prophet said that the angel of the Lord
[1:19:23] accompanies
[1:19:25] this message.
[1:19:28] Amen. You want to know the secret to
[1:19:30] revival? Preach this message. You want
[1:19:33] to know the secret to the joy of the
[1:19:35] Lord? Believe this message. You want to
[1:19:38] know the secret to peace in your home?
[1:19:40] Preach this message and declare it and
[1:19:44] believe it. And you'll find the angel of
[1:19:46] the Lord will accompany this message
[1:19:49] always.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been restored back. Why in
[1:19:57] the world you want to take me back to
[1:19:58] something more shallow? We've been
[1:20:01] restored back to Bible truth. You say,
[1:20:03] "I tell you what, I I I don't need no
[1:20:05] prophet. I got the Bible itself." Look
[1:20:07] what they done with the Bible.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; We got some thousands of thousands of
[1:20:12] denominations and they say this is right
[1:20:15] and this is right and that's wrong and
[1:20:16] that's wrong. Brother, you don't know up
[1:20:18] from down and left to right and you're
[1:20:20] going over what the church says. But
[1:20:23] when you come, listen, when you come to
[1:20:25] one man that is God's prophet, you read
[1:20:28] all in the Old Testament when somebody
[1:20:30] wanted to get a word from the Lord.
[1:20:32] Amen. They ran out 400 prophets. So you
[1:20:36] look at in the Old Testament and there
[1:20:38] was something in Jehoshaphat that said,
[1:20:40] "Well, you know, is there one more?"
[1:20:42] Even he knew the stuff them
[1:20:44] denominational churches would that just
[1:20:46] wasn't quite right. Is there another one
[1:20:48] out there? Is there is there another
[1:20:51] prophet? Oh yeah, there's one. But he
[1:20:53] tells us how to dress and he tells us
[1:20:55] how to act. Uh-oh. He tells us all of
[1:20:58] the and we hate him because he don't say
[1:21:01] what the church said. I say thank God
[1:21:04] for that. And God did not send us a man
[1:21:07] that would say what the church said, but
[1:21:09] he sent us a prophet that would say what
[1:21:12] God said.
[1:21:17] And they would always turn to the
[1:21:18] prophet to hear what God had to say.
[1:21:20] They'd run to Samuel. They'd run to the
[1:21:22] prophet. Amen. It's the final authority.
[1:21:26] When that prophet speaks, it is settled.
[1:21:29] And there's no more questions about it.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this message has
[1:21:34] restored all of these things back to the
[1:21:35] church. I believe the shout. I believe
[1:21:38] the the victory of the church. I believe
[1:21:40] all these things has been restored. Do
[1:21:42] you believe that?
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And you'll find in the scripture and
[1:21:45] people come and say, "Well, what do you
[1:21:46] mean that the message of the hour has
[1:21:48] restored the victory?" I just love
[1:21:50] studying this in the scripture because
[1:21:52] read here in 1 Samuel and read about
[1:21:54] that ark of the covenant.
[1:21:57] The Philistines got a hold of the word.
[1:22:00] They got a hold of the ark of the
[1:22:02] covenant and they brought that ark in
[1:22:04] the house of Dagon, that false god, that
[1:22:07] false idol. And when the word got in the
[1:22:10] midst of idolatry and of false gods, the
[1:22:14] Bible says that Dagon, he fell down to
[1:22:17] his face. And they said, "What in the
[1:22:19] world?" Well, our God has fallen down.
[1:22:22] And they got the nerve enough to go pick
[1:22:24] him up and go stand him back up. And
[1:22:28] then they come back out the next day and
[1:22:30] he's fall down again. And later on, he
[1:22:33] just breaks up into pieces. What was it?
[1:22:35] It was the effect of the word.
[1:22:39] Hallelujah. Amen. When you put the word
[1:22:41] in a place, every demon power, every
[1:22:45] sickness, every addiction has got to bow
[1:22:49] in the name of Jesus.
[1:22:53] Well, that's just the truth, isn't it?
[1:22:54] And you read there in the book of
[1:22:56] Joshua, I believe it is, where the high
[1:22:58] priest or the priests are there carrying
[1:23:00] that ark of the covenant. They're
[1:23:02] carrying the ark and they come up to the
[1:23:04] water and they're in front of the
[1:23:06] children of Israel. The minister is
[1:23:09] carrying the word in front of the
[1:23:11] children of Israel. And as they step
[1:23:14] into the water, the water begins to move
[1:23:17] out of the way. And they begin to cross
[1:23:20] the river of Jordan. And they want a
[1:23:22] great victory. What was it? Was it
[1:23:25] because of the priest?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It was because of the word they was
[1:23:29] carrying. And it brought the victory to
[1:23:32] the children of Israel. Amen. I and the
[1:23:35] Bible says that we are kings and we are
[1:23:38] priests unto the most high God. And when
[1:23:42] you put the word back in the church, you
[1:23:45] put the victory in the church, you put
[1:23:47] miracles in the church, and you put all
[1:23:50] of these things back in the church.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you put the word back in the
[1:24:01] church,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. See the church wonder where their
[1:24:04] power went. It went when they start to
[1:24:06] adopt a man's creeds instead of
[1:24:07] preaching the word.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And when you look at the ark of the
[1:24:11] covenant in the hands of them priests,
[1:24:12] it was their victory. And as long as
[1:24:14] they stayed with that word, they stayed
[1:24:17] in victory. And that's the quote that I
[1:24:20] read. The prophet said, "You believe
[1:24:21] with all your heart, the angel of the
[1:24:23] Lord accompanies this message always."
[1:24:27] So whenever you go to walk out, brother,
[1:24:29] put that word in front of you and you
[1:24:32] walk with the word in front of you. And
[1:24:34] I tell you this right now, you'll walk
[1:24:36] from victory and to victory and to
[1:24:39] victory. But as soon as you put that
[1:24:42] word in the back burner and you put that
[1:24:44] word behind you, Amen. You better get
[1:24:47] ready to stumble and fall when you put
[1:24:49] the word away from you.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and that and that's exactly
[1:24:55] what the church world began to do. They
[1:24:57] took that word and they put it on the
[1:24:59] back burner and they they they
[1:25:01] substituted entertainment instead of the
[1:25:03] word and they substituted programs
[1:25:06] instead of the word. And that's what
[1:25:08] brother Ram was preaching against. He
[1:25:10] said, "You got all the music and all
[1:25:12] these things." Amen. But you don't got
[1:25:14] the word being preached in power and in
[1:25:17] demonstration. Amen. That's what the
[1:25:19] prophet come to do was to restore the
[1:25:21] word back to the church. And by doing
[1:25:25] that, the angel of the Lord would be put
[1:25:27] back in the church and the victory would
[1:25:29] come back in the church. Amen. I thank
[1:25:32] God that the word has been restored back
[1:25:35] to the church of the living God. And let
[1:25:37] me tell you this, I I just love that
[1:25:39] quotation. Amen. When the prophet said,
[1:25:41] "The angel of the Lord will accompany
[1:25:43] this message always."
[1:25:45] So when I read that quote, I don't even
[1:25:47] doubt in my mind when I hear this
[1:25:49] message begin to be preached. Amen.
[1:25:51] There is something that resonates in my
[1:25:53] soul and says, "Lord, I know you're here
[1:25:56] and you're vindicating the word that's
[1:25:58] being preached." That means if you're
[1:26:00] here, then everything, amen, the
[1:26:03] impossibilities,
[1:26:05] they become possible. If he's here,
[1:26:08] amen, all the problems, they become easy
[1:26:11] things. Amen. All the questions, they
[1:26:13] get solved in his presence. All the
[1:26:16] death receives life when you're in that
[1:26:19] presence. All the needs become met when
[1:26:22] you're in that presence. Amen. It's by
[1:26:24] preaching the word that the angel of the
[1:26:27] Lord and the reality of the presence of
[1:26:30] God is brought back to the church.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The troubled can have peace.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The problems can be delivered.
[1:26:41] when you get in his presence. That's why
[1:26:44] I believe in preaching. And I I tell
[1:26:46] you, I believe we've been restored back
[1:26:48] to the pattern of the word.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; How many knows what the prophet said the
[1:26:52] pattern was? He said the pattern was
[1:26:54] Pentecost. He says here in the Ephesian
[1:26:56] church age, what the church was at
[1:26:58] Pentecost is the standard.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. There is no other
[1:27:03] pattern. No matter what the scholars
[1:27:05] say, God has not changed the pattern.
[1:27:09] What God did at Pentecost, he has to
[1:27:12] keep on doing until the tr Hey, listen.
[1:27:15] So, why are you telling me that the days
[1:27:17] of miracles are passed? Why are you
[1:27:20] telling me that the Holy Ghost ain't for
[1:27:22] me anymore? Why are you telling me that
[1:27:24] God ain't here and the power ain't here,
[1:27:27] the anointing ain't here? Amen. The
[1:27:29] prophets declare unto you that what God
[1:27:31] did at Pentecost, he has to keep doing
[1:27:35] until the end of the age.
[1:27:40] Amen. We've been restored back to the
[1:27:42] same faith. Amen. So don't try to come
[1:27:45] tell us days are over. Maybe for you
[1:27:47] there are.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe for you those days are over
[1:27:50] because you don't believe.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; But to them that believe those days are
[1:27:54] not over. Those days are here right now.
[1:27:56] And let me tell you, Amen. Stop. We
[1:27:58] going
[1:28:00] we we got to stop with the ideology that
[1:28:03] one day it's coming and these things are
[1:28:05] coming in the future. And what you're
[1:28:08] doing is you're kicking the promise down
[1:28:10] the road. And you're kicking the can
[1:28:12] down the road. And you're looking to the
[1:28:14] future. And you're waiting to the
[1:28:16] future. And you're looking for the
[1:28:18] promise. And you're waiting the Hey,
[1:28:20] listen. If you keep on putting it in the
[1:28:22] future, you won't ever have it today.
[1:28:25] But if you say, "Lord, you are right
[1:28:28] now, my God. You are right now. Today,
[1:28:31] everything I have need of, I don't have
[1:28:34] to wait to get it. I can get it right
[1:28:36] now. Hey, I tell you, it'd be a good day
[1:28:39] today. Amen. To get what you need from
[1:28:42] God. Amen. Believe for it. Believe for
[1:28:47] it. Believe. Today's the day. Today's
[1:28:50] the day of change. Today's the day that
[1:28:53] you receive your promise. Today's the
[1:28:55] day that you get what you've been asking
[1:28:57] God for. Well, I don't know. I I don't
[1:29:01] know if God of course God still does it.
[1:29:04] Amen. kick the unbelief away from you,
[1:29:08] brother. You just don't know. I I don't
[1:29:09] have an example to turn to and and I
[1:29:12] can't look to the You realize there was
[1:29:14] people in the Bible, they had no
[1:29:16] examples to look to.
[1:29:19] You say, "Give me one." The woman with
[1:29:21] the issue of blood,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; the issue of blood, she never read where
[1:29:28] somebody where a sister in the Old
[1:29:30] Testament when there had never been
[1:29:32] Messiah. There had never been Melzdc
[1:29:34] made flesh. Amen. There there had never
[1:29:36] been Messiah where you you got Melzdc
[1:29:39] there in the time of Abraham. But there
[1:29:40] never been a time of the Messiah like
[1:29:43] was there during that time. Amen. She
[1:29:46] had nobody to turn to. But faith don't
[1:29:48] need to turn to anybody else. Faith
[1:29:51] don't look for an example and faith
[1:29:54] don't faith don't look for the future
[1:29:56] and faith don't look to the past but
[1:29:58] faith looks right now and says I don't
[1:30:02] care if nobody's ever done it before I
[1:30:05] don't care if nobody's ever received it
[1:30:08] that way I know one thing if I touch the
[1:30:11] hymn of his garment I will be made whole
[1:30:16] and what did God have to say to that
[1:30:18] faith God says that's exactly ly right.
[1:30:21] Whatever you say with the faith in your
[1:30:24] heart, it will come to pass.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; She didn't have nobody to turn to. But
[1:30:33] she did have faith to turn to. And when
[1:30:36] you don't have nobody to turn to,
[1:30:38] remember this. You've got faith to turn
[1:30:39] to. And you don't need an example. Be
[1:30:42] the example. Amen. Be the one they talk
[1:30:45] about. Be the one they share their
[1:30:47] testimony about. Amen. be the one they
[1:30:49] say, "Hey, God did it for that sister. I
[1:30:52] know he can do it for me. God did it for
[1:30:55] that brother. I know he could do it for
[1:30:57] me."
[1:30:59] You say, "Well, brother, you you just
[1:31:01] don't know." God can take your test and
[1:31:03] make you a testimony out of it.
[1:31:07] You look at that woman at the well. She
[1:31:09] had five husbands. She was immoral to
[1:31:12] society. An ill-famed woman. We're
[1:31:15] reading about that woman tonight.
[1:31:18] thousands of years later. Amen. We're
[1:31:20] reading about that woman. So don't tell
[1:31:23] me that God can't use you for a
[1:31:25] testimony.
[1:31:28] Most certainly he can.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that's exactly the truth.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the prophet said
[1:31:35] we've been restored back to the
[1:31:37] standard, then we've been restored back
[1:31:38] to the standard.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the prophet said, the bride of
[1:31:41] Christ will be a continuation of the
[1:31:43] book of Acts.
[1:31:45] I say we will be a continuation of the
[1:31:47] book of Acts. He said, "Well, well,
[1:31:49] how's it going to happen?" I'm not
[1:31:51] worried about it.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Well, what what what about Don't even
[1:31:54] talk to me like that. It ain't for me to
[1:31:57] guess it. It ain't for Well, brother,
[1:31:58] when No, no, no, no, no, no. God didn't
[1:32:01] say when. He didn't say how. Amen. God
[1:32:04] just gave us his word, and it's up to
[1:32:07] you to believe it. And the reason Oh,
[1:32:11] God. And the reason folks leave church
[1:32:13] is because, well, you know, there's
[1:32:15] supposed to be this and they're supposed
[1:32:16] to be that and I'm disappointed. I'm
[1:32:18] that. Amen. You got your eyes on the
[1:32:20] wrong thing. You don't got to look far
[1:32:24] to find the hinder parts of Israel.
[1:32:26] Amen. She's got them, brother. Amen. But
[1:32:29] she's also got the pillar of fire.
[1:32:34] She's got the hinder parts, but she's
[1:32:36] also got God in her midst.
[1:32:41] That's just the truth.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been restored back to the
[1:32:46] original word.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The original power, the Amen. the
[1:32:51] original word. I believe that with all
[1:32:52] my heart. Amen. I believe we're living
[1:32:54] in a wonderful time concerning the word.
[1:32:57] There's been a full restoration of all
[1:32:59] the truths of the Bible. Amen. What a
[1:33:01] baptism. Serpent seed. We look in the
[1:33:04] word plainly and we know what the word
[1:33:08] says today. We've got perfect
[1:33:10] interpretation
[1:33:12] with divine vindication.
[1:33:14] It's the word of almighty God.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then that's exactly the truth.
[1:33:20] And in the breach, the prophet talked
[1:33:21] about in Malachi 4 will be one like
[1:33:23] John. He said he'll come and reveal all
[1:33:25] these mysteries of God. And he'll
[1:33:27] restore the faith back to the children
[1:33:29] of the apostolic father. He'll restore
[1:33:32] back all of these mysteries that's been
[1:33:34] probed at. I mean, listen, the we no
[1:33:37] longer have mysteries in the message.
[1:33:39] It's a previously hidden truth. So when
[1:33:43] you say, "You're preaching to me
[1:33:44] mysteries." No, you're not. You're
[1:33:46] preaching to me revelations.
[1:33:48] It ain't a mystery no more.
[1:33:52] You're preaching to me mysteries, go
[1:33:54] preach to somebody else. I don't got no
[1:33:56] more mysteries no more. Amen. It's all
[1:33:58] been opened and it's all been revealed.
[1:34:01] If you want to show me a mystery, please
[1:34:03] don't do it. Amen. All of these things
[1:34:05] has already been revealed to me. And
[1:34:08] you're making more mysteries.
[1:34:13] That's what they do, folks. They take
[1:34:16] something and they and they're confused
[1:34:18] about it and they're wondering about it.
[1:34:20] And so they try to bring that confused
[1:34:22] spirit on you. Well, brother, have you
[1:34:24] ever looked and then thought what and
[1:34:26] this and this? and you get confused
[1:34:28] about something and then you try to
[1:34:30] bring that same questioning spirit,
[1:34:32] amen, around other people and you're
[1:34:35] questioning and wondering and you're
[1:34:36] confused and then you want to try to
[1:34:38] confuse somebody else. Let me tell you,
[1:34:41] God is not the author of confusion.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; You ever been there? Somebody ask you a
[1:34:49] question, they're so confused. And when
[1:34:51] you hear their question, then you about
[1:34:52] just get confused listening to them.
[1:34:55] What kind of question is that? Then your
[1:34:57] mind is spinning.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Where you getting that from? And you're
[1:35:03] questioning and wondering and how is
[1:35:05] this and how is that? And you're making
[1:35:07] more questions.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't have no more questions
[1:35:11] anymore. And let me tell you right now,
[1:35:13] if you got a question, if you got a
[1:35:15] question, there is a Bible answer. And
[1:35:18] there is a me there is an answer in the
[1:35:21] message of the hour. And you say,
[1:35:23] "Preacher, well, well, you know, that's
[1:35:25] not the answer I was looking for."
[1:35:26] That's exactly right. You wanted him to
[1:35:29] answer it your way. But you didn't want
[1:35:31] him to answer it his way.
[1:35:34] Whatever you say, I say yes, Lord. Yes,
[1:35:37] Lord. Yes. Yes. If this is how you
[1:35:39] answer it, I say yes, Lord. To your will
[1:35:42] and to your way.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, God promised he would come
[1:35:46] and restore all these things back to us.
[1:35:49] You believe that? Amen. restore our
[1:35:51] hearts back to the faith. Amen. You know
[1:35:54] there's only one faith, only one Lord,
[1:35:58] only one baptism. Amen. You got many
[1:36:01] faiths. Baptist, Methodist,
[1:36:03] Presbyterian. That's many faiths. But
[1:36:05] we've not been turned back to one of the
[1:36:07] faiths. We've been turned back to the
[1:36:09] faith, which is a Biblebased faith.
[1:36:13] Listen, let me tell you right now, this
[1:36:15] message in the Bible, you cannot
[1:36:17] separate them. I know men's been trying
[1:36:19] to separate them, but they are
[1:36:21] inseparable. Brother, sister, when you
[1:36:24] read this message, you read the Bible.
[1:36:26] And when you read this Bible, you read
[1:36:28] the message. They are one and the same.
[1:36:31] That's exactly the truth. They are one
[1:36:34] and the same. Amen. You cannot separate
[1:36:36] word from word.
[1:36:38] How can you divide the word when it's
[1:36:41] word? This is word and that is word.
[1:36:47] We've been restored back to the word.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So when you say you get away from the
[1:36:52] message and back to the Bible, I say
[1:36:54] what?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I never got away from this.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; I never got out of this. I just got
[1:37:02] deeper in this.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I never got away from this. I
[1:37:09] never varied out of it. But now I read
[1:37:12] it and the Bible did not become a
[1:37:14] different book. It became a new book and
[1:37:17] it became an open book. And now I read
[1:37:21] it with the revelation that is in my
[1:37:24] soul. I tell you church, it ain't some
[1:37:27] newspaper. It ain't some novelty. It
[1:37:30] ain't some fiction. It is the it is the
[1:37:33] inspired word of almighty God.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And it's my absolute
[1:37:41] This message my absolute. This Bible my
[1:37:44] brother, you better be careful saying
[1:37:45] stuff like that. This message is my
[1:37:48] absolute. I'll believe it. I'll preach
[1:37:51] it. I'll stand for it. If you want to
[1:37:54] know what I say, I ain't going to tell
[1:37:56] you. I'm going to come back to what the
[1:37:57] prophet said.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Folks, come and say, "But it's not
[1:38:00] what do you think about this?" I ain't
[1:38:01] going to tell you what I think about it.
[1:38:03] I'm going to go to the prophet to this
[1:38:05] age.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? He said, "That's awful
[1:38:09] bold." But I know it is. And that's what
[1:38:11] faith is. I'm going to go back to the
[1:38:12] prophet of my age. Amen. How many
[1:38:15] remembers beyond the curtain of the
[1:38:16] time?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he preached that, Amen. all
[1:38:20] the messages he had preached. His
[1:38:21] converts was up there. Y'all remember
[1:38:23] very well. And then brother Brandham
[1:38:25] asked the question, do is Paul going to
[1:38:27] be judged by what he preached? Will he
[1:38:29] be judged? Amen. And he said, yes, he's
[1:38:31] going to be judged. He said, praise God,
[1:38:34] I only preach what Paul preached.
[1:38:38] and a multitude screen. Now we know and
[1:38:42] we're resting on that. Hey, if they was
[1:38:46] over there and could say, "I'm resting
[1:38:48] on a prophet's message."
[1:38:51] But while I'm on this earth, I will echo
[1:38:54] what they said. I am resting on this
[1:38:57] prophet's message and I'm going to meet
[1:39:00] Paul and I'm going to meet that prophet
[1:39:03] and I'm standing on this word and I'm
[1:39:06] resting on it.
[1:39:10] I tell you, it's a beautiful thing when
[1:39:12] you can rest on it.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing when you can
[1:39:16] settle and you can rest. I'm not
[1:39:18] fighting on it. I'm not arguing on it.
[1:39:22] I'm not wondering on it. I am resting on
[1:39:24] it. It's settled, brother, sister. The
[1:39:28] questions are settled. The unbelief is
[1:39:30] scattered. And the faith is building.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] We're resting on the word
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; and this message came to restore us
[1:39:43] back.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And when the prophet
[1:39:46] showed us, he said we was in the devil's
[1:39:48] pawn shop.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; But see, I think it's beautiful because
[1:39:51] you never belong to the devil.
[1:39:54] You
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; can I tell you this? You never was a son
[1:39:57] of the devil.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You was a son of God the whole time.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; It don't matter if you're in the pig
[1:40:04] pin. It don't matter the problems you're
[1:40:06] in. It listen. Amen. It does not change
[1:40:09] your status as a son of God.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're ins snared and you're
[1:40:17] in a poncha. And so restoration, the
[1:40:19] prophet said it means to bring back.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not purchasing you. It's
[1:40:24] restoring you back to what you was.
[1:40:28] Hallelujah. Amen. We have been restored
[1:40:30] back to what we were. And that's what
[1:40:33] this message come to do was to bring us
[1:40:36] back. I think it's beautiful. This
[1:40:38] message did not make you a son of God.
[1:40:40] This message did not make you a daughter
[1:40:42] of God. You always was a son of God and
[1:40:46] you always was a daughter of God. But
[1:40:49] this message come to reveal to you who
[1:40:52] you were.
[1:40:55] That's what it is, brother, sister. It
[1:40:57] ain't making you something you're not.
[1:40:59] It's revealing you to who you really
[1:41:02] are.
[1:41:05] I mean, it's all in the message. Brother
[1:41:07] said, "You didn't become a son when you
[1:41:09] come to the altar. You didn't become a
[1:41:11] son when you on a certain day, but you
[1:41:14] always was." That's how you can believe
[1:41:17] this message. Listen, you was believing
[1:41:20] this message in the mind of God when the
[1:41:23] sons of God was sh. That's why you can
[1:41:26] believe it here because you was
[1:41:28] believing it over there. That may be too
[1:41:30] deep. I don't know. But that's what I
[1:41:32] believe. Amen. I believe I was in the
[1:41:34] mind of God as an attribute. And I was
[1:41:38] believing God then and then God sent me
[1:41:41] to this earth with the seed of God in
[1:41:43] me. And the Bible says that blessed is
[1:41:46] the man that God will not impute sin to
[1:41:49] for his seed remainth in him.
[1:41:53] It It was always there. And that's why
[1:41:56] when you heard this message, Amen. It
[1:41:59] was not God calling your flesh. It was
[1:42:01] not God calling your spirit, but it was
[1:42:04] word that was screaming out to word. And
[1:42:07] there was a deep in you. And it
[1:42:10] responded back to the deep. That's why
[1:42:14] my soul says, "Amen.
[1:42:17] Amen. Amen. Amen." It rings out from.
[1:42:21] You just don't understand. It's not in
[1:42:23] my flesh because in my flesh I don't
[1:42:26] feel it a lot of times. In my spirit, I
[1:42:29] don't feel like it. But in my soul,
[1:42:31] there is something that begins to turn
[1:42:33] on. I just can't help it. When I hear a
[1:42:36] man under the anointing of the Holy
[1:42:38] Spirit and he starts to preach this
[1:42:40] message just like the prophet preached
[1:42:42] it, I cannot hold my peace. I just can't
[1:42:46] hold it in. It's word that's connecting
[1:42:50] with word. And I thank God from the
[1:42:52] depths of my soul that I've got
[1:42:55] representation on the inside of the
[1:42:57] inside.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the quotation brother
[1:43:03] talked about that that was at that
[1:43:04] scrapyard. Remember
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and brother Ram asked the question, how
[1:43:08] come when that magna passes over
[1:43:11] all of this stuff draws up to it but
[1:43:14] this other stuff don't draw to it? He
[1:43:16] said brother Brandham is simple. The
[1:43:18] reason when the message is preached
[1:43:21] and this is drawn to it is because that
[1:43:24] is magnetized to that and so they it
[1:43:28] just can't help but draw up to it and
[1:43:30] receive it to itself
[1:43:34] because it only draws up metal. It don't
[1:43:38] draw up unbelievers. It don't draw up
[1:43:40] aluminum. It don't draw up. It only
[1:43:43] draws up the genuine. And that's what
[1:43:46] this message has done. Brother, sister.
[1:43:48] Amen. God sent this word to the earth to
[1:43:51] call a bride out
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; and you was magnetized to it.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, it didn't change your
[1:43:59] identity. It revealed your identity.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting to a scripture. I just I
[1:44:04] just think that this this scripture is
[1:44:06] so beautiful in Joel 2. And I was just
[1:44:08] studying this in different versions. I
[1:44:10] know brother said he said you stick with
[1:44:12] that King James version. Is that
[1:44:13] correct?
[1:44:14] He said, "It's the closest to the it's
[1:44:16] the closest to the exact Bible that I
[1:44:18] know of." And I just believe that. Amen.
[1:44:20] But I began studying them Greek words
[1:44:22] and I thought they were so beautiful
[1:44:23] here. Amen. There in Joel 2, when God
[1:44:25] said, "I'll restore." Amen. Another
[1:44:27] verbiage for it is, "I will compensate.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; I will repay you. I will give you back
[1:44:33] what you lost. I will make up to you the
[1:44:37] years that you lost."
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? I'm going to make
[1:44:43] it up to you. But wait a minute. He he
[1:44:45] he didn't Why does he have to make it up
[1:44:48] to you? It was the locust that did it.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; But look at the grace of God manifest.
[1:44:55] God didn't kill the crops. The locust
[1:44:57] killed the crops. But God was fully
[1:44:59] responsible. Hallelujah. For the
[1:45:02] children of Israel. And God was watching
[1:45:05] over them. And I think it's so amazing
[1:45:07] when you begin to read this out. Amen.
[1:45:09] Because prior there in Joel the first
[1:45:11] chapter, you read of a story and all
[1:45:13] these locusts come in. It's good to read
[1:45:15] the chapter before these locusts come in
[1:45:17] and they eat the crops and they eat the
[1:45:19] vines and it's desolate and dry and a
[1:45:21] horrible sight. And then God calls him,
[1:45:23] I'm sure you're familiar with it. God
[1:45:25] caused the children of Israel to repent.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "You ministers, you lament and
[1:45:30] you cry aloud and you repent." I thought
[1:45:33] my they whatever they have done it was
[1:45:36] displeasing to God and God is calling
[1:45:39] them to repentance. Listen, I still
[1:45:42] believe in oldfashioned repentance.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think you get too
[1:45:47] predestinated that you don't need
[1:45:48] repentance. Don't think you get too holy
[1:45:51] where you don't have to say, "I'm sorry,
[1:45:53] brother. I'm sorry, sister." Amen. You
[1:45:56] got so holy you become unholy.
[1:46:00] got so spiritual become unspiritual.
[1:46:03] I'll leave that there. But God told them
[1:46:05] to repent. And then you find
[1:46:06] immediately, it's so beautiful. God
[1:46:08] says, "Listen, after you repented, I
[1:46:10] will restore to you. I'll compensate
[1:46:13] you. I'll repay you." Notice God did not
[1:46:17] take a hammer and say, "I tell you what,
[1:46:19] you're going to feel bad for what you
[1:46:21] did. I'm going to condemn you. I'm going
[1:46:23] to beat you. I'm going to make you feel
[1:46:25] so awful." That is not what God did. But
[1:46:28] after they repented, God says, "I'll
[1:46:30] restore to you everything the locust
[1:46:33] state, everything the caterpillar."
[1:46:35] Amen. But look at the beauty of the
[1:46:37] grace of God. All you have to do is
[1:46:40] repent and then you're a candidate for
[1:46:43] the blessings and the restoration of
[1:46:46] Almighty God.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I started studying these
[1:46:51] things and it just it just goes into in
[1:46:54] so many places, but I started thinking
[1:46:55] of Job there. You talk about
[1:46:57] restoration, that's restoration in and
[1:46:59] in his beauty.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. The man had lost
[1:47:03] everything. His family, his job, his
[1:47:05] livestock. Amen. Satan, if you could say
[1:47:08] it this way, took everything from him.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And Job is here. And the thing he feared
[1:47:13] the most came upon him.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, God gives his greatest
[1:47:18] trials to his most trusted servant.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You're beating yourself up because
[1:47:23] you're fighting so many trials. Don't
[1:47:24] look at it that way. There's people that
[1:47:27] couldn't handle a quarter of what you go
[1:47:29] through because that's not their lot. Is
[1:47:32] that okay? That's not what God has
[1:47:34] called them. But the reason God's
[1:47:36] allowed you to go through what you went
[1:47:38] through is because he knew it would not
[1:47:40] break you. He knew it would make you and
[1:47:44] you would become a strong
[1:47:47] Hallelujah.
[1:47:49] He knew it would not break you, but he
[1:47:51] knew it would make you into what God
[1:47:54] called you to be. And that's exactly
[1:47:56] what was happening with Job. Amen. God
[1:47:59] knew I can put all this on him and I can
[1:48:02] take away all these blessings. I can
[1:48:04] take away all these things from me, but
[1:48:06] he'll still be a son of God and he'll
[1:48:09] still worship me. And look at his
[1:48:12] testimony. Amen. He He's there. He gets
[1:48:14] the news that his that his livestock
[1:48:16] gets killed and then the house falls
[1:48:18] down and kills his children. He's
[1:48:21] getting I just baffled about Stephen.
[1:48:23] I'm reading this and you hear bad event
[1:48:25] after bad event. It's like your car
[1:48:27] break down, then your tire goes out,
[1:48:29] then your engine, then transmit. It's
[1:48:30] just bad after bad after bad. It's
[1:48:32] Monday every day.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Where where is the
[1:48:38] endless? Could it get any worse?" And
[1:48:41] maybe that's what Job was thinking. And
[1:48:43] Job is here laying on an ash sheep and
[1:48:45] he's looking up into the heavens and
[1:48:47] he's scraping his boils. And then a
[1:48:50] vision broke out and he saw thousands of
[1:48:52] years later and he saw Messiah on the
[1:48:55] earth and he caught a revelation in the
[1:48:59] midst of his trial and he screamed out
[1:49:02] and begin to worship God. And he said,
[1:49:04] "Blessed are you, creator of the heavens
[1:49:07] and the earth. I know if this earthly
[1:49:09] tabernacle be dissolved, I have one
[1:49:12] already waiting for me in the heavens.
[1:49:15] And though the earthworm and the worms
[1:49:18] destroy this flesh, yet in my flesh I
[1:49:20] shall see God. And he said, God, you
[1:49:23] blessed me and God you took it away, but
[1:49:26] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:49:31] And the devil was how in the world, how
[1:49:35] could he do that? How could she do that?
[1:49:38] That should have destroyed him. I
[1:49:40] remember he didn't see that gene seed
[1:49:42] that was on the inside of Job. You
[1:49:45] cannot stop the seed of God.
[1:49:50] Hallelujah. And the devil thought he'd
[1:49:52] take your praise. And the devil thought
[1:49:54] he'd take your visor. Amen. Amen. He
[1:49:57] thought he'd take all these things from
[1:49:59] you. And you lay on an ash sheet
[1:50:01] worshiping
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; and praising God and giving God the
[1:50:05] glory and giving God the honor. And the
[1:50:08] devil is so dumbfounded. How in the
[1:50:11] world is she still moving? How in the
[1:50:14] world is he still going?
[1:50:17] And I tell him, I don't know. I don't
[1:50:20] know how I'm still here. All I know is
[1:50:22] the grace of God on my life. And there
[1:50:24] is something in me. This seed is not air
[1:50:27] with this shuck. And this seed is so
[1:50:30] much greater in the sh. Hey, I tell you.
[1:50:33] Amen. The shuck gave out. Amen. And the
[1:50:36] outer part gave out, but the seed
[1:50:38] remained on the inside.
[1:50:43] Hallelujah.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. He He stood
[1:50:47] there and later you'll find God restored
[1:50:50] back double.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, everything you lost,
[1:50:55] God going to give you back double.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; That job you lost, God going to give you
[1:51:00] back something double.
[1:51:06] Brother Simmon, you you believe in a
[1:51:08] prosperity gospel? Yes, sir. You believe
[1:51:10] in a prosperity message? Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:51:13] I believe according to the word of God.
[1:51:16] Amen. That God does not Amen. He don't
[1:51:18] want you out here begging in the streets
[1:51:20] and looking for your next meal. Amen.
[1:51:22] The Bible says, "I never seen the
[1:51:25] righteous forsaken
[1:51:27] or his seed begging for bread."
[1:51:32] I want you to prosper in the hand of
[1:51:35] God. And listen, I believe that the
[1:51:37] bride of Christ is like an unto Joseph.
[1:51:39] That wherever you go, you can prosper.
[1:51:43] As you're in the battle, you prosper. As
[1:51:46] you're in slavery, you prosper. The sign
[1:51:49] of prosperity.
[1:51:51] What's just the truth? Think about it,
[1:51:54] friends. And Job stood there. He didn't
[1:51:56] know how, but he looked back and said,
[1:51:58] "I got double of everything I lost. I
[1:52:03] serve a God that you will eat in plenty
[1:52:06] and you shall be satisfied.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you right now,
[1:52:14] there is a fountain open in the house of
[1:52:17] David. There is a fountain that is full
[1:52:19] tonight. Amen. Dip your cup in and get
[1:52:22] you another glass. I said dip your cup
[1:52:25] in and get your blessing. Amen. Get your
[1:52:29] victory. Get your joy. Amen. Whatever
[1:52:32] you have need of. Amen. Give him the
[1:52:35] promise of God.
[1:52:38] The devil's took from you long enough.
[1:52:40] Amen. Give back what is rightfully
[1:52:42] yours.
[1:52:45] Oh, brother Solomon, I I just don't
[1:52:47] know. That's not faith. That's fear. Oh,
[1:52:50] I don't know if that's what that's not
[1:52:51] faith. That's fear. Amen. Reach into the
[1:52:55] the blessings of God. Amen. Y'all know
[1:52:57] it's this is Bible and this is message.
[1:52:59] The Bible said, see, he said, you get
[1:53:01] among some of these churches, he said,
[1:53:03] and it's like some of these mouses
[1:53:04] that's in the great garers of Egypt.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I I don't want too much.
[1:53:10] I might run out.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want too much victory. I might
[1:53:14] run out. I don't want too much joy. I
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I might run out. You shall eat in
[1:53:22] plenty.
[1:53:23] I will restore to you and you shall eat
[1:53:27] in a little bit in plenty. Listen. Amen.
[1:53:30] Get some meat on your bones and start
[1:53:33] eating in the word of almighty God.
[1:53:38] We ought to be the most spiritually fat
[1:53:40] people on this earth.
[1:53:47] Is that okay? Eden plenty. If you want
[1:53:50] seconds, go get it. If you want thirds,
[1:53:53] go get it. I don't know about maybe this
[1:53:56] is just who I am. Amen. But listen.
[1:53:58] Amen. I live daily constantly wanting
[1:54:00] more of God.
[1:54:02] On Sunday, I want more of God. On
[1:54:05] Monday, I've got a conviction. I say,
[1:54:07] "God, I want more of you." Tuesday rolls
[1:54:09] around, there's I'm still hungry and I'm
[1:54:12] still thirsty. I don't know how to get
[1:54:14] away from it. All I know is this. When I
[1:54:17] begin to turn on the message of the hour
[1:54:19] and I begin to feed on the word, I feel
[1:54:22] my batteries getting
[1:54:26] Hallelujah. I feel my batteries getting
[1:54:28] charged. I feel my cup overflowing. And
[1:54:32] that's the problem, folks. as people's
[1:54:34] eating on the wrong thing
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; and they're eating a bunch of junk food
[1:54:39] and they're eating CNN and Fox News and
[1:54:42] NBC and BBC and
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; they're eating all these things and well
[1:54:47] I just don't know why I don't have no
[1:54:49] victory and I don't have no joy and I
[1:54:51] what you been eating on
[1:54:54] but I'm getting a sugar crash because
[1:54:55] you eating sugar.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; I go up and down sugar and you say
[1:55:00] doctor I got a problem. Okay. What you
[1:55:02] been eating on? Well, I've been eating
[1:55:04] oatmeal cream pies and honey.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And then you go on a Monday and all you
[1:55:18] eat are honey bun and honey bun and and
[1:55:20] sun drop and sugar and sugar and sugar
[1:55:22] and then you know where's my victory at?
[1:55:24] I just had victory yesterday and now
[1:55:26] it's gone and I was over. I tell you
[1:55:28] what, on Sunday I could have took my
[1:55:30] swing out and slew every giant I had in
[1:55:32] my life. But on Monday, you can't even
[1:55:34] barely can't even barely kick a can down
[1:55:37] the road.
[1:55:39] And then you're waiting for for your
[1:55:41] Wednesday night fix.
[1:55:44] Pastor, you got to preach me through
[1:55:46] song. You got to sing me up. You
[1:55:48] shouldn't come here and be up and down
[1:55:50] and up and down and up and Amen. That's
[1:55:52] a bunch of Pentecostal babies. We ain't
[1:55:56] called to be a bunch of pent. Hey, y'all
[1:55:58] know it's the truth. The prophet said in
[1:56:00] the message the countdown. He said that
[1:56:02] Pentecostal age come up. He said that
[1:56:04] plane got real high, but it had to come
[1:56:06] back down. He said, but we're living in
[1:56:09] the astronaut age.
[1:56:13] He said, you sat in that shuttle and you
[1:56:16] let it begin to carry you and begin to
[1:56:18] lift you. He said, "You get so high in
[1:56:21] that astronaut that gravitation
[1:56:24] has lost its hold on you."
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I think it's a shame.
[1:56:33] You make your pastor have to preach
[1:56:34] through you.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; He's got a hammer and hammer and lay in
[1:56:42] the word and lay in the word and then
[1:56:44] you eventually just get a quarter of a
[1:56:46] tank and you can Amen, pastor.
[1:56:50] You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; You ought you you don't have to come
[1:56:56] here to get your fix. You ought to be
[1:56:58] fixed outside of church. And this just
[1:57:01] adds to it and adds to it and adds to
[1:57:04] it. Hallelujah. Listen. I don't have to
[1:57:07] rely on coming here to get my food. I've
[1:57:10] got food at home.
[1:57:13] I've got,00 to go boxes of food. I tell
[1:57:17] you why. At 12:00 I want to open it up.
[1:57:20] I'm opening it up.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; At 3:00 I want to open the fridge and
[1:57:24] get it. If I'm hungry, I can do it.
[1:57:27] Because God said you'll eat in plenty
[1:57:29] and you'll be satisfied.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Preacher, what's wrong with you? I just
[1:57:35] been eating. I've been drinking. I've
[1:57:37] been eating and I'm feeling good.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; it's just the truth, brother. We've been
[1:57:47] restored.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship has been restored. Joy, I
[1:57:51] I I just love serving God. Don't you? I
[1:57:54] love coming to church. I love worshiping
[1:57:57] God. Amen. See, Amen. David was there in
[1:58:00] the Psalms and he said, "Lord, restore.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Restore unto me the joy of my
[1:58:06] salvation."
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; How many's ever been there before?
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram opened that up. He said he
[1:58:11] didn't lose his salvation,
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; but he lost that just that joy of
[1:58:15] serving God. And used to be, brother and
[1:58:18] sister, we could not wait to get to the
[1:58:20] house of God. We couldn't wait to
[1:58:23] worship and to sing and to rejoice. Let
[1:58:26] me tell you, you're still a son of God
[1:58:28] and you're still a daughter of God. But
[1:58:31] the problem is is you just lost one big
[1:58:33] thing and that's your joy in serving
[1:58:36] God. Listen, if I can't enjoy serving
[1:58:40] God, I ain't going to serve him.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; I believe God wants us to enjoy ser and
[1:58:45] let me tell you, I enjoy every single
[1:58:47] second of it. There ain't been one
[1:58:50] service I've left out of, brother Greg.
[1:58:52] I wish I didn't go to church. It ain't
[1:58:54] ever happened. Ain't ever It don't
[1:58:56] matter if I was so tired I had to drag
[1:58:58] myself by the belt to the house of God.
[1:59:01] When I got there, brother, I didn't
[1:59:03] regret a single second of it.
[1:59:07] Hallelujah. When I got amongst little
[1:59:09] pillars of fire and licks of fire and my
[1:59:12] hands went up and my worship rung out,
[1:59:14] you know, if you stayed home, you'd have
[1:59:16] been wishing you came here anyhow.
[1:59:20] I man, I wish I was there. I tell you
[1:59:22] why. I just wish. Amen. Don't let the
[1:59:24] devil talk you out of your blessing.
[1:59:27] Don't let the devil talk you out of your
[1:59:29] day of visitation. But do what David
[1:59:32] did. Say, Lord, restore to me. restore
[1:59:35] to me the joy I lost. Restore to me the
[1:59:38] victory I lost. Amen. This is a God of
[1:59:41] restoration. Can he do it?
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I'mma turn a corner and close here. I
[1:59:49] promise you.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Restore the joy.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can give you that that fresh
[1:59:54] joy. How many remembers you first
[1:59:55] started serving the Lord?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother. I I I
[2:00:01] reminisce on it. So beautiful. So
[2:00:03] wonderful. Amen. just such a sweet
[2:00:05] anointing and presence of God and and
[2:00:08] you know what it was like and I tell you
[2:00:10] just so precious and I you read your
[2:00:12] Bible and tears stream out of your face.
[2:00:14] You hear the prophet and tears roll out
[2:00:16] of you and y'all know what I'm talking
[2:00:17] just a joy and a peace and bubbling and
[2:00:20] bubbling and bubbling and but after a
[2:00:22] while if you're not careful that'll get
[2:00:25] to get stale on you and then the house
[2:00:27] of God will get common to you and the
[2:00:30] Bible will get common to you and then
[2:00:32] before you know it you've lost that joy
[2:00:35] and you've lost that sacredness of your
[2:00:37] worship. But all you have to do is come
[2:00:39] to God and say, "God, restore that back
[2:00:41] to me. Give me back the joy I had when I
[2:00:45] first started serving you. Give me back
[2:00:47] that joy of worshiping you and that joy
[2:00:51] of serving you. And the same God that
[2:00:53] did it for David is the same God that
[2:00:56] can do it for you.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, we're coming to the top.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. The prophet
[2:01:07] said, "When was the church birthed?" It
[2:01:09] was birthed at Pentecost. He said that
[2:01:11] bride tree begin to grow out. He said
[2:01:14] then you find as it begin to grow out
[2:01:16] through the time of Luther and Wesley.
[2:01:18] He said here come the Lutheran. He said
[2:01:20] that Lutheran bug got on that tree and
[2:01:23] begin to eat away at it. And that Wesley
[2:01:25] and bug got on that tree and begin to
[2:01:27] eat away on the prophet showed it. He
[2:01:29] said and the church they took the
[2:01:31] worship out of the church and they took
[2:01:33] the victory out of the church and they
[2:01:35] took all emotion out of the church.
[2:01:37] Amen. And the prophet said that bug got
[2:01:39] on them leaves and got on the fruit and
[2:01:41] took the fruit of the spirit out of the
[2:01:43] church. But there was a and I tell you
[2:01:45] it's an awful picture when you think
[2:01:47] about it because the prophet said that
[2:01:49] that tree, brother Zach, got eat all the
[2:01:51] way down to the roots.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I got the quotes here. I don't have time
[2:01:55] to preach them. He said that tree got
[2:01:57] ate all the way down to the roots. But
[2:02:00] the prophet said them roots was
[2:02:02] predestinated
[2:02:04] roots. He said those roots was
[2:02:07] predestinated roots. And after the
[2:02:10] prophet said that, he said what was the
[2:02:12] predestination? It was I will restore
[2:02:15] saith the Lord. And in them roots was a
[2:02:18] circulation of promise, a circulation of
[2:02:22] prophecy. I will restore, sayeth the
[2:02:24] Lord. And all them roots was waiting on
[2:02:27] was their vindicated time and their
[2:02:30] vindicated hour. You said, "When was
[2:02:32] that vindicated time for the restoration
[2:02:35] of the bride tree?" It is right now.
[2:02:39] Amen. Right now is the time of it. And
[2:02:41] then God sent a prophet and begin to lay
[2:02:44] in the foundation and begin word upon
[2:02:47] word and preach upon preach and line
[2:02:50] upon line and hear a little and there a
[2:02:53] little and rebuild this bride tree. And
[2:02:56] let me tell you, this ain't some dead
[2:02:58] tree. This ain't some puck up by the
[2:03:00] roots. Amen. This is a tree of life.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth?
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; I think it's so powerful because the
[2:03:09] prophet said it got ate all the way down
[2:03:11] to the roots. I thought, could you
[2:03:12] imagine how of a horrible sight that had
[2:03:14] to been
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; in the spirit? It just seemed to be dead
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; and just roots was left. And you can be
[2:03:21] that way in your walk with God. It can
[2:03:22] seem like all you you just been beat
[2:03:24] down to the root.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; You've been tore down to the root. You
[2:03:27] ain't got nothing left but roots. You're
[2:03:30] a good candidate for restoration. You
[2:03:32] may be so beat up and tore down. You You
[2:03:34] just feel like it's just past
[2:03:36] restoration. Not a past restoration.
[2:03:38] It's in position for a miracle is what
[2:03:40] it is. Amen. You You're so pressed down.
[2:03:43] Well, listen. It don't matter how beat
[2:03:45] up and how tore up. There is a word of
[2:03:48] prophecy that is over this bride. Let me
[2:03:51] just tell you, good luck stopping God.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Good luck stopping God.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; There is a prophecy hovering over you. I
[2:03:59] will restore.
[2:04:01] Who will? God will restore. Amen. And
[2:04:04] you may be just a roots left, but
[2:04:07] there's a promise of restoration. And I
[2:04:10] tell you, I just love tying this into
[2:04:12] that vision, brother. You look at that
[2:04:14] boy that was dead in Finland. I think
[2:04:15] it's it's a powerful testimony. Yes,
[2:04:17] sir.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; That boy's dead in Finland. The prophet
[2:04:19] had the vision years and years prior to
[2:04:21] it.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And he was there in Finland. And that
[2:04:24] boy is all crushed up by the automobile
[2:04:26] accident. Brother was looking down on
[2:04:28] him and he began to walk away. He said,
[2:04:30] "But then something put his hand on my
[2:04:33] shoulder." He said, "And I came back and
[2:04:36] I looked at the boy. I looked to the
[2:04:38] hill and I said, "Wait just a second,
[2:04:40] brother Moore." I believe it was said,
[2:04:41] "Go get your Bible. Read in the folly.
[2:04:44] See if this is the vision and see if
[2:04:47] this is how it's supposed to all lay
[2:04:49] out." And he said, "Brother Bram, this
[2:04:51] is exactly right." And brother Ram said,
[2:04:53] "Oh, what it is to know that the vision
[2:04:56] is exactly at hand and the situation is
[2:04:59] a hand." Hey, listen. Look at that boy.
[2:05:02] He's crushed. He's torn up. He's got
[2:05:05] blood leaking out of him. His legs is
[2:05:07] tore up. His clothes is tore up. But
[2:05:10] could that condition
[2:05:13] could that condition stop the prophecy
[2:05:17] of restoration that was over that boy's
[2:05:20] life?
[2:05:21] No sir. But he went stood there at a
[2:05:24] lifeless carcass of a boy and he be to
[2:05:28] pray and said, "Father, you showed me
[2:05:29] this years before. So I pray that you'll
[2:05:32] bring life back into this boy." And
[2:05:34] brother said, "That boy raised up and
[2:05:37] life coming back into him." What was it?
[2:05:40] It was the power of the spoken word
[2:05:45] and it restored that boy back to life.
[2:05:48] You say, "But that's fine for the boy,
[2:05:50] but what about me?" There was also a
[2:05:52] vision of a bride.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was a vision of the
[2:05:59] alpha bride as she was walking to the
[2:06:01] message of Paul. And here come a vision
[2:06:04] of the of the bride or the church coming
[2:06:06] out of America. And said, "Is this the
[2:06:09] best that we could produce?" He said,
[2:06:11] "But then all of the sudden, here came
[2:06:14] another preview." He said this preview
[2:06:17] was the Omega bride. And he said that
[2:06:20] Omega bride looked exactly like the
[2:06:24] alpha bride and she was walking in step
[2:06:27] with the word. I don't know if you can
[2:06:29] handle this, but when the prophet saw
[2:06:31] that, he saw me over there.
[2:06:36] Hallelujah.
[2:06:40] Y'all ain't getting it. He saw you over
[2:06:42] there.
[2:06:43] He saw you walking in step with the
[2:06:46] word. Is that okay? He saw you walking
[2:06:49] in step with the word. So if the prophet
[2:06:52] already saw us over there by
[2:06:54] representation
[2:06:56] of what can stop it,
[2:06:59] who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:07:03] God's elect? It is God that justifies.
[2:07:07] Who can stop it? Amen. And brother
[2:07:09] Brandham said it. Stand to your feet as
[2:07:11] you will. musicians come. Brother Ram
[2:07:13] talked about it. He said, "If God gave
[2:07:15] me a vision,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; to go down to the presidential graveyard
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; and call George Washington from the
[2:07:23] grave,
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; dead carcass, bones, ash, everything
[2:07:28] called that from the grave." He said, "I
[2:07:31] would invite the whole world to come and
[2:07:35] watch it happen." So, let me tell you,
[2:07:37] what makes you think God can't do it for
[2:07:38] you?
[2:07:40] What makes you think you're too far
[2:07:42] gone? God can't restore to you. What
[2:07:44] makes you think that your need is too
[2:07:46] great that God can't restore you back to
[2:07:49] perfect health,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; perfect condition?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, this ain't partial restoration.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; This is perfect restoration. Listen, God
[2:08:01] ain't just bringing you partially back.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; He's bringing you completely back. Amen.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, you take somebody I was hearing
[2:08:09] brother preach on just recently. He's
[2:08:10] talking about you you take an old car
[2:08:12] and go restore it. Somebody that really
[2:08:13] wants to restore you was there and
[2:08:15] brother brother Dick's preaching so
[2:08:16] beautiful.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; You take an original car, somebody wants
[2:08:20] to restore that car.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; He don't go down to Walmart and get some
[2:08:24] some China made product. If he's trying
[2:08:26] to put it in an original car,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; if he's restoring an original car, he
[2:08:32] wants it in original condition,
[2:08:36] original faith, original looks, original
[2:08:39] feel, original drive. He goes to the
[2:08:42] manufacturer and he gets all original
[2:08:45] parts. And so when God wanted to restore
[2:08:49] the bride, he went to original word
[2:08:53] and the spoken word is the original
[2:08:57] seed. And when God restores his church,
[2:09:00] you are being built back with original
[2:09:03] word, original power, original
[2:09:06] anointing. Listen, let me tell you,
[2:09:08] you're not just going back to Pentecost.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; I know I'm running out of time. I
[2:09:12] promise you I'm closing. You're not just
[2:09:14] going back to Pentecost. You're going
[2:09:17] back farther
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; and farther
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; and farther.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going back to the
[2:09:23] prophets and then farther. You're going
[2:09:26] all the way back to the Garden of Eden
[2:09:29] and then you're stepping all the way
[2:09:31] back into the mind of almighty God.
[2:09:35] Hallelujah. This is not just this is not
[2:09:38] just Pentecostal restoration back to the
[2:09:41] day of Pentecost. This is back to the
[2:09:44] garden of Eden. You say, "Say, what's
[2:09:47] the Garden of Eden, preacher?" It's the
[2:09:49] power of the spoken word that is
[2:09:52] operating in mature sons and mature
[2:09:56] daughters.
[2:09:57] Hallelujah. This is not just back to
[2:10:00] Pentecost. This is back to You said,
[2:10:02] "Preacher, what was in Eden?" Look at
[2:10:03] it. They spoke the word
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; and it manifested right in front of
[2:10:08] them. Adam says 72 degrees with a slight
[2:10:11] breeze. 72° and a slight breeze. Adam
[2:10:14] said, "Pluck up and be moved over here."
[2:10:16] Plucked up and be moved over here. Adam
[2:10:18] said, "Hey, level this level this
[2:10:21] mountain out a little bit." The mountain
[2:10:22] got leveled out out.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; And then when God called them, brother,
[2:10:27] he said, "Go have dominion.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Dominion over every fish of the sea,
[2:10:33] over every foul of the air, over every
[2:10:36] creeping thing. Go have dominion and
[2:10:39] authority over all the earth." God's
[2:10:41] bringing you back to a position of
[2:10:44] authority and of dominion. And the Bible
[2:10:48] says that sin shall not have dominion
[2:10:52] over you.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking at I'm looking at a
[2:10:57] restored church.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my
[2:11:01] heart. I'm looking through the eyes of
[2:11:02] this word. I see that masterpiece right
[2:11:05] in front of me.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said in the
[2:11:10] Garden of Eden, that masterpiece was
[2:11:11] marred and it fell flat on his face. But
[2:11:15] brother Brandham said in the message of
[2:11:16] masterpiece, he said God would not leave
[2:11:19] it that way.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; He said he come down on a funnel cloud
[2:11:24] spelled L O V E. He said he screamed
[2:11:27] out, I'll make a way back.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between your seed and
[2:11:32] between the serpent seed. And he
[2:11:34] testified of Christ the son of man. Oh,
[2:11:37] brother, sister, it just goes so far.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is we've been
[2:11:43] restored
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; by the message of the hour. God bless
[2:11:46] you tonight. God bless you. Bless
[2:11:48] Steven.
[2:11:59] Praise God. Glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:04] Let's give the Lord a big clap.
[2:12:12] God is real.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; It's a message of restoration.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And tonight we have been restored.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; There are certain things he was speaking
[2:12:26] about the joy and this and this and
[2:12:28] this. Those things come through
[2:12:29] inspiration.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; It means somebody needed it.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Was he here on Sunday?
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Did he hear what was preached on Sunday?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; How can the direction of Sunday pick up
[2:12:42] here?
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; It is God
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; restoring his children.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; My friend, stop kicking the can
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; down the road.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you kicking, stop kicking it.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you kicking your healing,
[2:13:02] you know, I'm going to wait till it get
[2:13:04] there. I'm going to
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; what? Oh, some people kick the healing.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; They are praying now, but they have God
[2:13:12] somehow down the road in the future will
[2:13:14] do it in a certain time. Kicking the
[2:13:17] healing.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Kicking.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me summarize. Whatever you are
[2:13:25] yearning for, stop kicking that over
[2:13:28] there.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember the day the
[2:13:30] rapture will happen,
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; All your project over.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; So this is the day.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; my brother. Wonderful sermon.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; May God install it. Strength. Amen. May
[2:13:47] God restore you strength and energy.
[2:13:50] Double.
[2:13:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Whatever was
[2:13:55] spoken, God sent his word. The Bible say
[2:13:57] he sent his word to heal.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; God spoke tonight.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Take was what was spoken and move on and
[2:14:07] claim what you need
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; and move this when you leave this place
[2:14:11] here.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; When you leave this place here, remember
[2:14:14] what you heard.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let the devil
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; come and remove that seed again.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; If you remove it, that's your problem.
[2:14:25] God have restored.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; And the scripture is strange. It says
[2:14:33] the great army that
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; who sent the army.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; We really don't want to look at that.
[2:14:42] Who sent the army?
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me help you. So, it's going to
[2:14:49] be easy. Who sent the devil to Job?
[2:14:54] Now we clear
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; now we okay?
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; So so if God descending
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; in other word God already knew
[2:15:05] everything. He already calibrated
[2:15:08] measure and knew the limit and
[2:15:11] everything. When he when he finished his
[2:15:13] plan
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; he says now go ahead.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; I have a question. When Jesus was
[2:15:21] sleeping on the boat,
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; do you think Jesus did not know what
[2:15:26] would happen?
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Before he got into the boat,
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; do you think Jesus didn't know that I'm
[2:15:35] going to get in the boat and then when I
[2:15:36] get in the boat, I'm going to go to
[2:15:38] sleep and the devil would do this? So
[2:15:40] when God goes to sleep,
[2:15:43] if the disciple would have realized that
[2:15:44] if he's sleeping calm like this,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; he knows what's going on.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; We might as well just sit quiet
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; because he cannot.
[2:15:57] In other words, God knew
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; if you sink the ship, you sinking God.
[2:16:05] Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; But you can't sing God.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; If you fail, God fail.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Strong statement. If you fail, God fail.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; I remember when my wife was overseas
[2:16:25] waiting, waiting, waiting. I say, "You
[2:16:27] know what? I'm going to start planning
[2:16:29] for the wedding." You heard that before?
[2:16:32] And I plan everything. And my wife was
[2:16:35] not here. She came one month before the
[2:16:37] wedding
[2:16:39] and her sister came. He said, "But
[2:16:41] Stephen, what about if she doesn't come
[2:16:43] and then you're going to lose all the
[2:16:45] money and everything?"
[2:16:48] It was not somebody on the street. It
[2:16:50] was a sister in the church that told me
[2:16:52] that
[2:16:55] with compassion, I'm just trying to make
[2:16:58] to make you see the other way. You know,
[2:17:00] you know what I'm saying? in in case you
[2:17:02] know you know brother we human we need
[2:17:04] to reason okay in case she doesn't come
[2:17:07] up so you see that you going to lose
[2:17:10] money
[2:17:13] I say if I fail God fail I don't even
[2:17:17] know where that answer came from one
[2:17:19] month she was here got married and it
[2:17:23] turned to a big testimony
[2:17:25] hold on to God
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; hold on to God no matter No matter how
[2:17:31] much, no matter how hard they look, hold
[2:17:34] on to God.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; God is a time God.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; You cannot fail.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; The vision is there.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; You won't fail.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:17:54] Father, we thank you for your grace, for

[2:18:49] Pentecostal church that go up and down

[2:18:54] are far beyond until gravity have no
[2:18:57] more power on us and we can believe that
[2:19:00] we have been restored and look forward
[2:19:03] Lord Father to the power of the spoken
