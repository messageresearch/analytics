========================================

Super science. Do you see it? God made manifest. God presenting himself to the world as a fugitive. Could have come some other way, but chose to come this way. Listen to this. Don't miss it. I think that God had in his mind it would be appealing to the human being. It is to the believer. &gt;&gt; It is appealing when our God becomes one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But to the starchy, ungodly, a stumbling block, I'll give you the sign. A virgin shall conceive. Emmanuel will be with you. God thought it would appeal to the human race that our God would be one of us. That he would cross himself and become our dust. That he would become our stock, a human stock, the creator who made all things. And again, it fulfilled prophecy. The prophets had saw it. And another thing, the word was made dust flesh and dwelt among us. The Jehovah, the word became human, became dust and tabernacle with us. Everlasting sign shall never end. Oh, when we think of it, an eternal sign, the super signs of all signs, God becoming one of us. Then again, he must be the seed of Abraham. Abraham was of course the seed of Eve. Eve was a woman seed that was to bruise the serpent's head. But Abraham, if you can catch it, he had faith in God, which united the spirit of God with the flesh of man. He never defiled or contradicted any of his laws. He cannot do that. So virgin, I'll give you a sign. Not a Titanic, not a UN, but I'll give you a sign of safety. A virgin shall come to you, and she shall bring forth a son and call him Emmanuel. That's the sign. Yes. You see, in God's laws of redemption, as it was with Boaz and Nema, it had to be a near kinsman. And the only way that man could be redeemed, God had to become a kinsman near. I want you to see it. He never become kin folks altogether to the rich to the mighty but he was Amen. Amen. An honor you deserve, Lord Jesus. Oh God, Father, we thank you for bringing us, oh God, to your presence once again. We thank you, Father, for your goodness, Lord, and your mercies, Lord.

Lord, you're Jehovah Shama. You're Jehovah Sid Canu. Lord, you're Jehovah Rafa. You're Jehovah Shalom. And you're the Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord, it was all wrapped up in that wonderful name, Lord. And we just worship that great name, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for the revelation of who you are, Lord, in this end time message, Lord. There's a world out there that is preaching another Jesus. But Lord, the seals have been torn off the book, Lord. And we see you plainly in your word. And we thank you for the revelation that you've given us in the hour we're living in. Lord, we pray, Lord, that you would forgive us, Lord, if we've said or done anything that's displeasing to you, Lord. May you just wash us by the water of your word tonight, Lord. May you cleanse us, Lord. Lord, as the high priest would be there sprinkling the blood upon the congregation. Lord, we know that we are washed by the water of your word. I pray, Lord, that you would have preeminence in this service tonight. Lord, we didn't come just to sing good songs or to see or to hear from one another, but Lord, we come to hear from heaven tonight, Lord. And we pray that you would just speak to us your word for the hour we're living in. Lord, you you made an appointment, Father, before the foundation of the world that we would be here in this place, Lord. And and you plan to be here also, Father. So, we thank you, Lord, that you're here in our midst, Lord, according to your word. We now yield ourselves to you, Lord. I yield everything I am to you. May you just use what's here, Father. My My body, my spirit, my soul, Lord, it's yours, Lord. We just give this service to you for your glory and for your honor. we pray in the most mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll just go straight into the word. And uh we don't want to keep you too long tonight. Um I tell you, sometimes it's just good to break tradition, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good just to break the mold a little bit and to loosen up. Amen. We're not here to be a formal church. And &gt;&gt; sometime sometimes you got to sing just a little bit longer &gt;&gt; and pre maybe preach just a little bit longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we we all we all we all love those quotes where the prophet said a a good a good sermon was about 45 minutes, but we forget the quotes where where he said if you got the Holy Ghost, you could stay all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. But &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we We don't want to &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We don't want to keep you all night tonight, though. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We do want to obey the Holy Spirit. Whatever God has is what I want. &gt;&gt; And if you don't want something, move out of the way. I'll get what you don't want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; Uh let's read in the word if you will. &gt;&gt; Uh if you have your Bibles, turn with me in the book of Malachi and the fourth chapter. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh also Joel the 2 chapter as you're turning there. I don't want to forget to to greet you tonight. I was speaking brother Josh on the phone earlier and he said to be sure and greet the church here and send his greetings to brother Steven and uh our sister church here. We say God richly bless you. And I'm glad to have my wife Gabrielle and our our baby girl back there. And we're just looking forward to what God has in store for us. And so let's read here together uh Malachi 4 and5. Very familiar scriptures. The Bible says this, "Behold, I will send you &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; I will send you Elijah the prophet." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the you part is just as important as the Elijah part. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there was no you, there would no be there would not be Elijah. So, God sending somebody the prophet, unto you, Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Now, notice what this Elijah ministry is going to do. And he's going to turn the heart of the fathers to the children, &gt;&gt; and the heart of the children to their fathers, &gt;&gt; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; Turn also, if you will, in Joel the 2 chapter, sir, &gt;&gt; and the 25th verse. These scriptures, I think, would often be linked together in many message sermons. In Joel 2 and 25, the Bible says this, "And I will restore &gt;&gt; to you the years." Now, now you got to just read that scripture slowly. &gt;&gt; And there's just so much packed in the word. Every every script, the prophet said if you couldn't find Christ in every verse to go back and reread it. &gt;&gt; So when he says, "And I," who is that talking about? That's talking about God himself. I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar. Amen. The prophet showed you that was the same bug, just in different stages, &gt;&gt; my great army which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God. So, so God's children, they're not going to be starving to death. They're not going to be anemic, but according to the word, they're going to eat in plenty &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. I don't know about you, but I am so satisfied with the message for my day. &gt;&gt; And notice what they'll do. And they'll praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never be ashamed. And ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else. and my people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask that God would bless his word as you can have your seats tonight. And uh I want to take a subject from these scriptures here and speak to you on restored by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Restored by the message of the hour. And I I believe that uh we're a people that have the true revelation of what restoration is. And I I believe with all my heart we have been restored back to the original faith. And I believe we're living in the time that all things have been restored. And brother Brandon would say this in questions and answers in 54. He said, "We're living in the last days. We're living in the days that God spoke would come. We're living in these days." He said, "And we're living in the time that regardless of what we try to think about it, God's word says we are predestinated." That's right. And what God has called will come to God. And what God doesn't call will not come to God. So if you're called of God, there's not a devil in hell that can stop it. If you're predestinated before the foundation of the world, God knows exactly where to find you. Amen. There. Amen. God God don't have any children that's lost where he don't know where he is. And and I believe that if you're predestinated by God, God will do whatever he has to do to get you in the spot where he can restore you. And you say, "Preacher, what are we being restored back to?" I believe we're being restored back to the image that God had of us in his great mind before the foundation of the world. And I believe that was an image of perfection. Amen. It was not just you at 21 years old because maybe you at 21 years old had problems and had issues and and had all these things. But I believe it's an image of perfection. And I believe that God has sent us a perfect word that's going to restore us back to perfection. See? Amen. If we did not have a perfect message, we could not come back to a perfect condition. But because God has sent us a perfect message, amen, it will bring us back to a perfect condition. And I I believe that the faith that was once delivered to the saints has been restored back to the church of the living God. I believe that the fullness of the Holy Ghost has been restored back to the church of the living God. You believe that here with me tonight? You say, "How? What? What do you mean the fullness of the Holy Ghost? The prophet showed us. He said the Holy Ghost was bound, amen, by denomination and by creeds and by Amen. by dogmas and all these things. He said, but in these last days, the fullness of that Holy Ghost, he's no longer bound in the church, but but he has been loosed by the word that's come in the age we're living in. Amen. This is not just partial Holy Ghost. This is the fullness of the Holy Ghost. Listen, if you're lacking anything, it's because you're not receiving what God has for you. I say, Lord, I want to receive you in your fullness. I want to receive everything you have for me and nothing less than what you have for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the scriptural balance of all things has been restored. Amen. Amen. You you you you think about in the prophet's time the church they was either far off in left field or far off in right field and he would get amongst the Pentecostals and he said see they were so far in emotionalism they said well the evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues or or if you shout or you had a chill bump and the prophet preached against that he said see what they're doing is they're majoring on emotionalism. Amen. You got people that come up and say well you know I tell you brother we had just church tonight. We we just had church and it was so good of a church that that the preacher didn't even get to preach. Now now now what is that? That's being focused on on on work up on emotionalism. Listen, if you don't plan on preaching, don't ask me to come. I Amen. Listen, I I can worship in my home. I can sing in my home. Amen. We come here. Is that okay? We come here to hear the word of God. Amen. preached in power and preached in demonstration. Amen. What do you mean you had church, but you didn't have no word? You don't got no church till you got the word in that church. Amen. And that's what stirs the bride up. It is the stimulation of the revelation of the word for her age. Amen. It's not emotional work up. Amen. I'll agree with you. We're worked up, but it ain't the same thing you're worked up over. You're worked up over from sensations. Amen. And emotion and all these things. But I'm worked up over the same thing that John is worked up over. Amen. The prophet said that he looked in that book and the prophet said he must have saw his name in that book. Amen. Hey, it was the opening of the word that revealed to you that you was in God before the foundation of the world. Amen. Don't tell me to quieten down and hold my peace. I found where I belong. I found who I am. Amen. I come from God and I'm going back to God. And God has restored to me the identity that belonged to me that was in God before the foundation of the world. Absolutely. Say, "I don't got no identity outside of this message." Amen. Don't call me, Amen, some Baptist or Methodist or or a blasphemous name. Amen. But you call me Miss Jesus. Amen. That's the identity that's been restored back to the church of the living God. Amen. It's a scriptural identity that's been restored. And I believe this message has restored us back to the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not on far left field and it's not on far right field. And people come and say, "I tell you what, you know, y'all are just legalistic." And there's so much legalism amongst the message. And I think of something. They'll call you legalistic when you say what a prophet said. They'll call you legalistic when you just quote the prophet. Amen. I'm not legalistic. You're just an unbeliever and you don't believe what God spoke through that prophet because you want to argue with it and you want to find I'm not legalistic. I just believe what God has sent me in the eye I'm living in. And the difference is you don't believe what God has done. Well, I might as well just preach for a moment. Amen. The reason you call it legalism is because you ain't ever had a new birth and you ain't never been born again and you ain't never been sanctified and you still got the desire to do those things that is anti-Bible and anti- message and it's easier for you to point your finger and say I'm legalistic than for you to go to an altar and to die to yourself. I say, "Who's wrong? God's word or you? Who's wrong? God's prophet or you?" I'll be the first to tell you, you're wrong and I'm wrong. Your ideas are wrong and my ideas are wrong. But the message of the hour is the truth. I'll stake my soul on it and I'll preach it till the day I die. Amen. This message is the unadulterated, vindicated truth of Almighty God. And if you don't like it, you're in the wrong church. If it's too strong for you, you ought to go to the church down the street. Amen. But listen, we played along with the word for long enough. I believe it's time. Let's believe every word of it. And you watch the glory of God coming in behind that. Amen. The prophet said that the angel of the Lord accompanies this message. Amen. You want to know the secret to revival? Preach this message. You want to know the secret to the joy of the Lord? Believe this message. You want to know the secret to peace in your home? Preach this message and declare it and believe it. And you'll find the angel of the Lord will accompany this message always. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been restored back. Why in the world you want to take me back to something more shallow? We've been restored back to Bible truth. You say, "I tell you what, I I I don't need no prophet. I got the Bible itself." Look what they done with the Bible. &gt;&gt; We got some thousands of thousands of denominations and they say this is right and this is right and that's wrong and that's wrong. Brother, you don't know up from down and left to right and you're going over what the church says. But when you come, listen, when you come to one man that is God's prophet, you read all in the Old Testament when somebody wanted to get a word from the Lord. Amen. They ran out 400 prophets. So you look at in the Old Testament and there was something in Jehoshaphat that said, "Well, you know, is there one more?" Even he knew the stuff them denominational churches would that just wasn't quite right. Is there another one out there? Is there is there another prophet? Oh yeah, there's one. But he tells us how to dress and he tells us how to act. Uh-oh. He tells us all of the and we hate him because he don't say what the church said. I say thank God for that. And God did not send us a man that would say what the church said, but he sent us a prophet that would say what God said. And they would always turn to the prophet to hear what God had to say. They'd run to Samuel. They'd run to the prophet. Amen. It's the final authority. When that prophet speaks, it is settled. And there's no more questions about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this message has restored all of these things back to the church. I believe the shout. I believe the the victory of the church. I believe all these things has been restored. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And you'll find in the scripture and people come and say, "Well, what do you mean that the message of the hour has restored the victory?" I just love studying this in the scripture because read here in 1 Samuel and read about that ark of the covenant. The Philistines got a hold of the word. They got a hold of the ark of the covenant and they brought that ark in the house of Dagon, that false god, that false idol. And when the word got in the midst of idolatry and of false gods, the Bible says that Dagon, he fell down to his face. And they said, "What in the world?" Well, our God has fallen down. And they got the nerve enough to go pick him up and go stand him back up. And then they come back out the next day and he's fall down again. And later on, he just breaks up into pieces. What was it? It was the effect of the word. Hallelujah. Amen. When you put the word in a place, every demon power, every sickness, every addiction has got to bow in the name of Jesus. Well, that's just the truth, isn't it? And you read there in the book of Joshua, I believe it is, where the high priest or the priests are there carrying that ark of the covenant. They're carrying the ark and they come up to the water and they're in front of the children of Israel. The minister is carrying the word in front of the children of Israel. And as they step into the water, the water begins to move out of the way. And they begin to cross the river of Jordan. And they want a great victory. What was it? Was it because of the priest? &gt;&gt; It was because of the word they was carrying. And it brought the victory to the children of Israel. Amen. I and the Bible says that we are kings and we are priests unto the most high God. And when you put the word back in the church, you put the victory in the church, you put miracles in the church, and you put all of these things back in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you put the word back in the church, &gt;&gt; Amen. See the church wonder where their power went. It went when they start to adopt a man's creeds instead of preaching the word. &gt;&gt; And when you look at the ark of the covenant in the hands of them priests, it was their victory. And as long as they stayed with that word, they stayed in victory. And that's the quote that I read. The prophet said, "You believe with all your heart, the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always." So whenever you go to walk out, brother, put that word in front of you and you walk with the word in front of you. And I tell you this right now, you'll walk from victory and to victory and to victory. But as soon as you put that word in the back burner and you put that word behind you, Amen. You better get ready to stumble and fall when you put the word away from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and that and that's exactly what the church world began to do. They took that word and they put it on the back burner and they they they substituted entertainment instead of the word and they substituted programs instead of the word. And that's what brother Ram was preaching against. He said, "You got all the music and all these things." Amen. But you don't got the word being preached in power and in demonstration. Amen. That's what the prophet come to do was to restore the word back to the church. And by doing that, the angel of the Lord would be put back in the church and the victory would come back in the church. Amen. I thank God that the word has been restored back to the church of the living God. And let me tell you this, I I just love that quotation. Amen. When the prophet said, "The angel of the Lord will accompany this message always." So when I read that quote, I don't even doubt in my mind when I hear this message begin to be preached. Amen. There is something that resonates in my soul and says, "Lord, I know you're here and you're vindicating the word that's being preached." That means if you're here, then everything, amen, the impossibilities, they become possible. If he's here, amen, all the problems, they become easy things. Amen. All the questions, they get solved in his presence. All the death receives life when you're in that presence. All the needs become met when you're in that presence. Amen. It's by preaching the word that the angel of the Lord and the reality of the presence of God is brought back to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The troubled can have peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. The problems can be delivered. when you get in his presence. That's why I believe in preaching. And I I tell you, I believe we've been restored back to the pattern of the word. &gt;&gt; How many knows what the prophet said the pattern was? He said the pattern was Pentecost. He says here in the Ephesian church age, what the church was at Pentecost is the standard. &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. There is no other pattern. No matter what the scholars say, God has not changed the pattern. What God did at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until the tr Hey, listen. So, why are you telling me that the days of miracles are passed? Why are you telling me that the Holy Ghost ain't for me anymore? Why are you telling me that God ain't here and the power ain't here, the anointing ain't here? Amen. The prophets declare unto you that what God did at Pentecost, he has to keep doing until the end of the age. Amen. We've been restored back to the same faith. Amen. So don't try to come tell us days are over. Maybe for you there are. &gt;&gt; Maybe for you those days are over because you don't believe. &gt;&gt; But to them that believe those days are not over. Those days are here right now. And let me tell you, Amen. Stop. We going we we got to stop with the ideology that one day it's coming and these things are coming in the future. And what you're doing is you're kicking the promise down the road. And you're kicking the can down the road. And you're looking to the future. And you're waiting to the future. And you're looking for the promise. And you're waiting the Hey, listen. If you keep on putting it in the future, you won't ever have it today. But if you say, "Lord, you are right now, my God. You are right now. Today, everything I have need of, I don't have to wait to get it. I can get it right now. Hey, I tell you, it'd be a good day today. Amen. To get what you need from God. Amen. Believe for it. Believe for it. Believe. Today's the day. Today's the day of change. Today's the day that you receive your promise. Today's the day that you get what you've been asking God for. Well, I don't know. I I don't know if God of course God still does it. Amen. kick the unbelief away from you, brother. You just don't know. I I don't have an example to turn to and and I can't look to the You realize there was people in the Bible, they had no examples to look to. You say, "Give me one." The woman with the issue of blood, &gt;&gt; the issue of blood, she never read where somebody where a sister in the Old Testament when there had never been Messiah. There had never been Melzdc made flesh. Amen. There there had never been Messiah where you you got Melzdc there in the time of Abraham. But there never been a time of the Messiah like was there during that time. Amen. She had nobody to turn to. But faith don't need to turn to anybody else. Faith don't look for an example and faith don't faith don't look for the future and faith don't look to the past but faith looks right now and says I don't care if nobody's ever done it before I don't care if nobody's ever received it that way I know one thing if I touch the hymn of his garment I will be made whole and what did God have to say to that faith God says that's exactly ly right. Whatever you say with the faith in your heart, it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; She didn't have nobody to turn to. But she did have faith to turn to. And when you don't have nobody to turn to, remember this. You've got faith to turn to. And you don't need an example. Be the example. Amen. Be the one they talk about. Be the one they share their testimony about. Amen. be the one they say, "Hey, God did it for that sister. I know he can do it for me. God did it for that brother. I know he could do it for me." You say, "Well, brother, you you just don't know." God can take your test and make you a testimony out of it. You look at that woman at the well. She had five husbands. She was immoral to society. An ill-famed woman. We're reading about that woman tonight. thousands of years later. Amen. We're reading about that woman. So don't tell me that God can't use you for a testimony. Most certainly he can. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the prophet said we've been restored back to the standard, then we've been restored back to the standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the prophet said, the bride of Christ will be a continuation of the book of Acts. I say we will be a continuation of the book of Acts. He said, "Well, well, how's it going to happen?" I'm not worried about it. &gt;&gt; Well, what what what about Don't even talk to me like that. It ain't for me to guess it. It ain't for Well, brother, when No, no, no, no, no, no. God didn't say when. He didn't say how. Amen. God just gave us his word, and it's up to you to believe it. And the reason Oh, God. And the reason folks leave church is because, well, you know, there's supposed to be this and they're supposed to be that and I'm disappointed. I'm that. Amen. You got your eyes on the wrong thing. You don't got to look far to find the hinder parts of Israel. Amen. She's got them, brother. Amen. But she's also got the pillar of fire. She's got the hinder parts, but she's also got God in her midst. That's just the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been restored back to the original word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The original power, the Amen. the original word. I believe that with all my heart. Amen. I believe we're living in a wonderful time concerning the word. There's been a full restoration of all the truths of the Bible. Amen. What a baptism. Serpent seed. We look in the word plainly and we know what the word says today. We've got perfect interpretation with divine vindication. It's the word of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then that's exactly the truth. And in the breach, the prophet talked about in Malachi 4 will be one like John. He said he'll come and reveal all these mysteries of God. And he'll restore the faith back to the children of the apostolic father. He'll restore back all of these mysteries that's been probed at. I mean, listen, the we no longer have mysteries in the message. It's a previously hidden truth. So when you say, "You're preaching to me mysteries." No, you're not. You're preaching to me revelations. It ain't a mystery no more. You're preaching to me mysteries, go preach to somebody else. I don't got no more mysteries no more. Amen. It's all been opened and it's all been revealed. If you want to show me a mystery, please don't do it. Amen. All of these things has already been revealed to me. And you're making more mysteries. That's what they do, folks. They take something and they and they're confused about it and they're wondering about it. And so they try to bring that confused spirit on you. Well, brother, have you ever looked and then thought what and this and this? and you get confused about something and then you try to bring that same questioning spirit, amen, around other people and you're questioning and wondering and you're confused and then you want to try to confuse somebody else. Let me tell you, God is not the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; You ever been there? Somebody ask you a question, they're so confused. And when you hear their question, then you about just get confused listening to them. What kind of question is that? Then your mind is spinning. &gt;&gt; Where you getting that from? And you're questioning and wondering and how is this and how is that? And you're making more questions. &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't have no more questions anymore. And let me tell you right now, if you got a question, if you got a question, there is a Bible answer. And there is a me there is an answer in the message of the hour. And you say, "Preacher, well, well, you know, that's not the answer I was looking for." That's exactly right. You wanted him to answer it your way. But you didn't want him to answer it his way. Whatever you say, I say yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes. Yes. If this is how you answer it, I say yes, Lord. To your will and to your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, God promised he would come and restore all these things back to us. You believe that? Amen. restore our hearts back to the faith. Amen. You know there's only one faith, only one Lord, only one baptism. Amen. You got many faiths. Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian. That's many faiths. But we've not been turned back to one of the faiths. We've been turned back to the faith, which is a Biblebased faith. Listen, let me tell you right now, this message in the Bible, you cannot separate them. I know men's been trying to separate them, but they are inseparable. Brother, sister, when you read this message, you read the Bible. And when you read this Bible, you read the message. They are one and the same. That's exactly the truth. They are one and the same. Amen. You cannot separate word from word. How can you divide the word when it's word? This is word and that is word. We've been restored back to the word. &gt;&gt; So when you say you get away from the message and back to the Bible, I say what? &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; I never got away from this. &gt;&gt; I never got out of this. I just got deeper in this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I never got away from this. I never varied out of it. But now I read it and the Bible did not become a different book. It became a new book and it became an open book. And now I read it with the revelation that is in my soul. I tell you church, it ain't some newspaper. It ain't some novelty. It ain't some fiction. It is the it is the inspired word of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And it's my absolute This message my absolute. This Bible my brother, you better be careful saying stuff like that. This message is my absolute. I'll believe it. I'll preach it. I'll stand for it. If you want to know what I say, I ain't going to tell you. I'm going to come back to what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Folks, come and say, "But it's not what do you think about this?" I ain't going to tell you what I think about it. I'm going to go to the prophet to this age. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? He said, "That's awful bold." But I know it is. And that's what faith is. I'm going to go back to the prophet of my age. Amen. How many remembers beyond the curtain of the time? &gt;&gt; Amen. When he preached that, Amen. all the messages he had preached. His converts was up there. Y'all remember very well. And then brother Brandham asked the question, do is Paul going to be judged by what he preached? Will he be judged? Amen. And he said, yes, he's going to be judged. He said, praise God, I only preach what Paul preached. and a multitude screen. Now we know and we're resting on that. Hey, if they was over there and could say, "I'm resting on a prophet's message." But while I'm on this earth, I will echo what they said. I am resting on this prophet's message and I'm going to meet Paul and I'm going to meet that prophet and I'm standing on this word and I'm resting on it. I tell you, it's a beautiful thing when you can rest on it. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing when you can settle and you can rest. I'm not fighting on it. I'm not arguing on it. I'm not wondering on it. I am resting on it. It's settled, brother, sister. The questions are settled. The unbelief is scattered. And the faith is building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're resting on the word &gt;&gt; and this message came to restore us back. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And when the prophet showed us, he said we was in the devil's pawn shop. &gt;&gt; But see, I think it's beautiful because you never belong to the devil. You &gt;&gt; can I tell you this? You never was a son of the devil. &gt;&gt; You was a son of God the whole time. &gt;&gt; It don't matter if you're in the pig pin. It don't matter the problems you're in. It listen. Amen. It does not change your status as a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're ins snared and you're in a poncha. And so restoration, the prophet said it means to bring back. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not purchasing you. It's restoring you back to what you was. Hallelujah. Amen. We have been restored back to what we were. And that's what this message come to do was to bring us back. I think it's beautiful. This message did not make you a son of God. This message did not make you a daughter of God. You always was a son of God and you always was a daughter of God. But this message come to reveal to you who you were. That's what it is, brother, sister. It ain't making you something you're not. It's revealing you to who you really are. I mean, it's all in the message. Brother said, "You didn't become a son when you come to the altar. You didn't become a son when you on a certain day, but you always was." That's how you can believe this message. Listen, you was believing this message in the mind of God when the sons of God was sh. That's why you can believe it here because you was believing it over there. That may be too deep. I don't know. But that's what I believe. Amen. I believe I was in the mind of God as an attribute. And I was believing God then and then God sent me to this earth with the seed of God in me. And the Bible says that blessed is the man that God will not impute sin to for his seed remainth in him. It It was always there. And that's why when you heard this message, Amen. It was not God calling your flesh. It was not God calling your spirit, but it was word that was screaming out to word. And there was a deep in you. And it responded back to the deep. That's why my soul says, "Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen." It rings out from. You just don't understand. It's not in my flesh because in my flesh I don't feel it a lot of times. In my spirit, I don't feel like it. But in my soul, there is something that begins to turn on. I just can't help it. When I hear a man under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and he starts to preach this message just like the prophet preached it, I cannot hold my peace. I just can't hold it in. It's word that's connecting with word. And I thank God from the depths of my soul that I've got representation on the inside of the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the quotation brother talked about that that was at that scrapyard. Remember &gt;&gt; and brother Ram asked the question, how come when that magna passes over all of this stuff draws up to it but this other stuff don't draw to it? He said brother Brandham is simple. The reason when the message is preached and this is drawn to it is because that is magnetized to that and so they it just can't help but draw up to it and receive it to itself because it only draws up metal. It don't draw up unbelievers. It don't draw up aluminum. It don't draw up. It only draws up the genuine. And that's what this message has done. Brother, sister. Amen. God sent this word to the earth to call a bride out &gt;&gt; and you was magnetized to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, it didn't change your identity. It revealed your identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting to a scripture. I just I just think that this this scripture is so beautiful in Joel 2. And I was just studying this in different versions. I know brother said he said you stick with that King James version. Is that correct? He said, "It's the closest to the it's the closest to the exact Bible that I know of." And I just believe that. Amen. But I began studying them Greek words and I thought they were so beautiful here. Amen. There in Joel 2, when God said, "I'll restore." Amen. Another verbiage for it is, "I will compensate. &gt;&gt; I will repay you. I will give you back what you lost. I will make up to you the years that you lost." &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? I'm going to make it up to you. But wait a minute. He he he didn't Why does he have to make it up to you? It was the locust that did it. &gt;&gt; But look at the grace of God manifest. God didn't kill the crops. The locust killed the crops. But God was fully responsible. Hallelujah. For the children of Israel. And God was watching over them. And I think it's so amazing when you begin to read this out. Amen. Because prior there in Joel the first chapter, you read of a story and all these locusts come in. It's good to read the chapter before these locusts come in and they eat the crops and they eat the vines and it's desolate and dry and a horrible sight. And then God calls him, I'm sure you're familiar with it. God caused the children of Israel to repent. &gt;&gt; He says, "You ministers, you lament and you cry aloud and you repent." I thought my they whatever they have done it was displeasing to God and God is calling them to repentance. Listen, I still believe in oldfashioned repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think you get too predestinated that you don't need repentance. Don't think you get too holy where you don't have to say, "I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry, sister." Amen. You got so holy you become unholy. got so spiritual become unspiritual. I'll leave that there. But God told them to repent. And then you find immediately, it's so beautiful. God says, "Listen, after you repented, I will restore to you. I'll compensate you. I'll repay you." Notice God did not take a hammer and say, "I tell you what, you're going to feel bad for what you did. I'm going to condemn you. I'm going to beat you. I'm going to make you feel so awful." That is not what God did. But after they repented, God says, "I'll restore to you everything the locust state, everything the caterpillar." Amen. But look at the beauty of the grace of God. All you have to do is repent and then you're a candidate for the blessings and the restoration of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I started studying these things and it just it just goes into in so many places, but I started thinking of Job there. You talk about restoration, that's restoration in and in his beauty. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. The man had lost everything. His family, his job, his livestock. Amen. Satan, if you could say it this way, took everything from him. &gt;&gt; And Job is here. And the thing he feared the most came upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, God gives his greatest trials to his most trusted servant. &gt;&gt; You're beating yourself up because you're fighting so many trials. Don't look at it that way. There's people that couldn't handle a quarter of what you go through because that's not their lot. Is that okay? That's not what God has called them. But the reason God's allowed you to go through what you went through is because he knew it would not break you. He knew it would make you and you would become a strong Hallelujah. He knew it would not break you, but he knew it would make you into what God called you to be. And that's exactly what was happening with Job. Amen. God knew I can put all this on him and I can take away all these blessings. I can take away all these things from me, but he'll still be a son of God and he'll still worship me. And look at his testimony. Amen. He He's there. He gets the news that his that his livestock gets killed and then the house falls down and kills his children. He's getting I just baffled about Stephen. I'm reading this and you hear bad event after bad event. It's like your car break down, then your tire goes out, then your engine, then transmit. It's just bad after bad after bad. It's Monday every day. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Where where is the endless? Could it get any worse?" And maybe that's what Job was thinking. And Job is here laying on an ash sheep and he's looking up into the heavens and he's scraping his boils. And then a vision broke out and he saw thousands of years later and he saw Messiah on the earth and he caught a revelation in the midst of his trial and he screamed out and begin to worship God. And he said, "Blessed are you, creator of the heavens and the earth. I know if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, I have one already waiting for me in the heavens. And though the earthworm and the worms destroy this flesh, yet in my flesh I shall see God. And he said, God, you blessed me and God you took it away, but blessed be the name of the Lord. And the devil was how in the world, how could he do that? How could she do that? That should have destroyed him. I remember he didn't see that gene seed that was on the inside of Job. You cannot stop the seed of God. Hallelujah. And the devil thought he'd take your praise. And the devil thought he'd take your visor. Amen. Amen. He thought he'd take all these things from you. And you lay on an ash sheet worshiping &gt;&gt; and praising God and giving God the glory and giving God the honor. And the devil is so dumbfounded. How in the world is she still moving? How in the world is he still going? And I tell him, I don't know. I don't know how I'm still here. All I know is the grace of God on my life. And there is something in me. This seed is not air with this shuck. And this seed is so much greater in the sh. Hey, I tell you. Amen. The shuck gave out. Amen. And the outer part gave out, but the seed remained on the inside. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. He He stood there and later you'll find God restored back double. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, everything you lost, God going to give you back double. &gt;&gt; That job you lost, God going to give you back something double. Brother Simmon, you you believe in a prosperity gospel? Yes, sir. You believe in a prosperity message? Yes, sir. Amen. I believe according to the word of God. Amen. That God does not Amen. He don't want you out here begging in the streets and looking for your next meal. Amen. The Bible says, "I never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread." I want you to prosper in the hand of God. And listen, I believe that the bride of Christ is like an unto Joseph. That wherever you go, you can prosper. As you're in the battle, you prosper. As you're in slavery, you prosper. The sign of prosperity. What's just the truth? Think about it, friends. And Job stood there. He didn't know how, but he looked back and said, "I got double of everything I lost. I serve a God that you will eat in plenty and you shall be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you right now, there is a fountain open in the house of David. There is a fountain that is full tonight. Amen. Dip your cup in and get you another glass. I said dip your cup in and get your blessing. Amen. Get your victory. Get your joy. Amen. Whatever you have need of. Amen. Give him the promise of God. The devil's took from you long enough. Amen. Give back what is rightfully yours. Oh, brother Solomon, I I just don't know. That's not faith. That's fear. Oh, I don't know if that's what that's not faith. That's fear. Amen. Reach into the the blessings of God. Amen. Y'all know it's this is Bible and this is message. The Bible said, see, he said, you get among some of these churches, he said, and it's like some of these mouses that's in the great garers of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I I don't want too much. I might run out. &gt;&gt; I don't want too much victory. I might run out. I don't want too much joy. I &gt;&gt; I might run out. You shall eat in plenty. I will restore to you and you shall eat in a little bit in plenty. Listen. Amen. Get some meat on your bones and start eating in the word of almighty God. We ought to be the most spiritually fat people on this earth. Is that okay? Eden plenty. If you want seconds, go get it. If you want thirds, go get it. I don't know about maybe this is just who I am. Amen. But listen. Amen. I live daily constantly wanting more of God. On Sunday, I want more of God. On Monday, I've got a conviction. I say, "God, I want more of you." Tuesday rolls around, there's I'm still hungry and I'm still thirsty. I don't know how to get away from it. All I know is this. When I begin to turn on the message of the hour and I begin to feed on the word, I feel my batteries getting Hallelujah. I feel my batteries getting charged. I feel my cup overflowing. And that's the problem, folks. as people's eating on the wrong thing &gt;&gt; and they're eating a bunch of junk food and they're eating CNN and Fox News and NBC and BBC and &gt;&gt; they're eating all these things and well I just don't know why I don't have no victory and I don't have no joy and I what you been eating on but I'm getting a sugar crash because you eating sugar. &gt;&gt; I go up and down sugar and you say doctor I got a problem. Okay. What you been eating on? Well, I've been eating oatmeal cream pies and honey. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; And then you go on a Monday and all you eat are honey bun and honey bun and and sun drop and sugar and sugar and sugar and then you know where's my victory at? I just had victory yesterday and now it's gone and I was over. I tell you what, on Sunday I could have took my swing out and slew every giant I had in my life. But on Monday, you can't even barely can't even barely kick a can down the road. And then you're waiting for for your Wednesday night fix. Pastor, you got to preach me through song. You got to sing me up. You shouldn't come here and be up and down and up and down and up and Amen. That's a bunch of Pentecostal babies. We ain't called to be a bunch of pent. Hey, y'all know it's the truth. The prophet said in the message the countdown. He said that Pentecostal age come up. He said that plane got real high, but it had to come back down. He said, but we're living in the astronaut age. He said, you sat in that shuttle and you let it begin to carry you and begin to lift you. He said, "You get so high in that astronaut that gravitation has lost its hold on you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I think it's a shame. You make your pastor have to preach through you. &gt;&gt; He's got a hammer and hammer and lay in the word and lay in the word and then you eventually just get a quarter of a tank and you can Amen, pastor. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. &gt;&gt; You ought you you don't have to come here to get your fix. You ought to be fixed outside of church. And this just adds to it and adds to it and adds to it. Hallelujah. Listen. I don't have to rely on coming here to get my food. I've got food at home. I've got,00 to go boxes of food. I tell you why. At 12:00 I want to open it up. I'm opening it up. &gt;&gt; At 3:00 I want to open the fridge and get it. If I'm hungry, I can do it. Because God said you'll eat in plenty and you'll be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Preacher, what's wrong with you? I just been eating. I've been drinking. I've been eating and I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's just the truth, brother. We've been restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship has been restored. Joy, I I I just love serving God. Don't you? I love coming to church. I love worshiping God. Amen. See, Amen. David was there in the Psalms and he said, "Lord, restore. &gt;&gt; Restore unto me the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; How many's ever been there before? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram opened that up. He said he didn't lose his salvation, &gt;&gt; but he lost that just that joy of serving God. And used to be, brother and sister, we could not wait to get to the house of God. We couldn't wait to worship and to sing and to rejoice. Let me tell you, you're still a son of God and you're still a daughter of God. But the problem is is you just lost one big thing and that's your joy in serving God. Listen, if I can't enjoy serving God, I ain't going to serve him. &gt;&gt; I believe God wants us to enjoy ser and let me tell you, I enjoy every single second of it. There ain't been one service I've left out of, brother Greg. I wish I didn't go to church. It ain't ever happened. Ain't ever It don't matter if I was so tired I had to drag myself by the belt to the house of God. When I got there, brother, I didn't regret a single second of it. Hallelujah. When I got amongst little pillars of fire and licks of fire and my hands went up and my worship rung out, you know, if you stayed home, you'd have been wishing you came here anyhow. I man, I wish I was there. I tell you why. I just wish. Amen. Don't let the devil talk you out of your blessing. Don't let the devil talk you out of your day of visitation. But do what David did. Say, Lord, restore to me. restore to me the joy I lost. Restore to me the victory I lost. Amen. This is a God of restoration. Can he do it? &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; I'mma turn a corner and close here. I promise you. &gt;&gt; Restore the joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. God can give you that that fresh joy. How many remembers you first started serving the Lord? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother. I I I reminisce on it. So beautiful. So wonderful. Amen. just such a sweet anointing and presence of God and and you know what it was like and I tell you just so precious and I you read your Bible and tears stream out of your face. You hear the prophet and tears roll out of you and y'all know what I'm talking just a joy and a peace and bubbling and bubbling and bubbling and but after a while if you're not careful that'll get to get stale on you and then the house of God will get common to you and the Bible will get common to you and then before you know it you've lost that joy and you've lost that sacredness of your worship. But all you have to do is come to God and say, "God, restore that back to me. Give me back the joy I had when I first started serving you. Give me back that joy of worshiping you and that joy of serving you. And the same God that did it for David is the same God that can do it for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, we're coming to the top. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. The prophet said, "When was the church birthed?" It was birthed at Pentecost. He said that bride tree begin to grow out. He said then you find as it begin to grow out through the time of Luther and Wesley. He said here come the Lutheran. He said that Lutheran bug got on that tree and begin to eat away at it. And that Wesley and bug got on that tree and begin to eat away on the prophet showed it. He said and the church they took the worship out of the church and they took the victory out of the church and they took all emotion out of the church. Amen. And the prophet said that bug got on them leaves and got on the fruit and took the fruit of the spirit out of the church. But there was a and I tell you it's an awful picture when you think about it because the prophet said that that tree, brother Zach, got eat all the way down to the roots. &gt;&gt; I got the quotes here. I don't have time to preach them. He said that tree got ate all the way down to the roots. But the prophet said them roots was predestinated roots. He said those roots was predestinated roots. And after the prophet said that, he said what was the predestination? It was I will restore saith the Lord. And in them roots was a circulation of promise, a circulation of prophecy. I will restore, sayeth the Lord. And all them roots was waiting on was their vindicated time and their vindicated hour. You said, "When was that vindicated time for the restoration of the bride tree?" It is right now. Amen. Right now is the time of it. And then God sent a prophet and begin to lay in the foundation and begin word upon word and preach upon preach and line upon line and hear a little and there a little and rebuild this bride tree. And let me tell you, this ain't some dead tree. This ain't some puck up by the roots. Amen. This is a tree of life. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; I think it's so powerful because the prophet said it got ate all the way down to the roots. I thought, could you imagine how of a horrible sight that had to been &gt;&gt; in the spirit? It just seemed to be dead &gt;&gt; and just roots was left. And you can be that way in your walk with God. It can seem like all you you just been beat down to the root. &gt;&gt; You've been tore down to the root. You ain't got nothing left but roots. You're a good candidate for restoration. You may be so beat up and tore down. You You just feel like it's just past restoration. Not a past restoration. It's in position for a miracle is what it is. Amen. You You're so pressed down. Well, listen. It don't matter how beat up and how tore up. There is a word of prophecy that is over this bride. Let me just tell you, good luck stopping God. &gt;&gt; Good luck stopping God. &gt;&gt; There is a prophecy hovering over you. I will restore. Who will? God will restore. Amen. And you may be just a roots left, but there's a promise of restoration. And I tell you, I just love tying this into that vision, brother. You look at that boy that was dead in Finland. I think it's it's a powerful testimony. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That boy's dead in Finland. The prophet had the vision years and years prior to it. &gt;&gt; And he was there in Finland. And that boy is all crushed up by the automobile accident. Brother was looking down on him and he began to walk away. He said, "But then something put his hand on my shoulder." He said, "And I came back and I looked at the boy. I looked to the hill and I said, "Wait just a second, brother Moore." I believe it was said, "Go get your Bible. Read in the folly. See if this is the vision and see if this is how it's supposed to all lay out." And he said, "Brother Bram, this is exactly right." And brother Ram said, "Oh, what it is to know that the vision is exactly at hand and the situation is a hand." Hey, listen. Look at that boy. He's crushed. He's torn up. He's got blood leaking out of him. His legs is tore up. His clothes is tore up. But could that condition could that condition stop the prophecy of restoration that was over that boy's life? No sir. But he went stood there at a lifeless carcass of a boy and he be to pray and said, "Father, you showed me this years before. So I pray that you'll bring life back into this boy." And brother said, "That boy raised up and life coming back into him." What was it? It was the power of the spoken word and it restored that boy back to life. You say, "But that's fine for the boy, but what about me?" There was also a vision of a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was a vision of the alpha bride as she was walking to the message of Paul. And here come a vision of the of the bride or the church coming out of America. And said, "Is this the best that we could produce?" He said, "But then all of the sudden, here came another preview." He said this preview was the Omega bride. And he said that Omega bride looked exactly like the alpha bride and she was walking in step with the word. I don't know if you can handle this, but when the prophet saw that, he saw me over there. Hallelujah. Y'all ain't getting it. He saw you over there. He saw you walking in step with the word. Is that okay? He saw you walking in step with the word. So if the prophet already saw us over there by representation of what can stop it, who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who can stop it? Amen. And brother Brandham said it. Stand to your feet as you will. musicians come. Brother Ram talked about it. He said, "If God gave me a vision, &gt;&gt; to go down to the presidential graveyard &gt;&gt; and call George Washington from the grave, &gt;&gt; dead carcass, bones, ash, everything called that from the grave." He said, "I would invite the whole world to come and watch it happen." So, let me tell you, what makes you think God can't do it for you? What makes you think you're too far gone? God can't restore to you. What makes you think that your need is too great that God can't restore you back to perfect health, &gt;&gt; perfect condition? &gt;&gt; Listen, this ain't partial restoration. &gt;&gt; This is perfect restoration. Listen, God ain't just bringing you partially back. &gt;&gt; He's bringing you completely back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, you take somebody I was hearing brother preach on just recently. He's talking about you you take an old car and go restore it. Somebody that really wants to restore you was there and brother brother Dick's preaching so beautiful. &gt;&gt; You take an original car, somebody wants to restore that car. &gt;&gt; He don't go down to Walmart and get some some China made product. If he's trying to put it in an original car, &gt;&gt; if he's restoring an original car, he wants it in original condition, original faith, original looks, original feel, original drive. He goes to the manufacturer and he gets all original parts. And so when God wanted to restore the bride, he went to original word and the spoken word is the original seed. And when God restores his church, you are being built back with original word, original power, original anointing. Listen, let me tell you, you're not just going back to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; I know I'm running out of time. I promise you I'm closing. You're not just going back to Pentecost. You're going back farther &gt;&gt; and farther &gt;&gt; and farther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going back to the prophets and then farther. You're going all the way back to the Garden of Eden and then you're stepping all the way back into the mind of almighty God. Hallelujah. This is not just this is not just Pentecostal restoration back to the day of Pentecost. This is back to the garden of Eden. You say, "Say, what's the Garden of Eden, preacher?" It's the power of the spoken word that is operating in mature sons and mature daughters. Hallelujah. This is not just back to Pentecost. This is back to You said, "Preacher, what was in Eden?" Look at it. They spoke the word &gt;&gt; and it manifested right in front of them. Adam says 72 degrees with a slight breeze. 72° and a slight breeze. Adam said, "Pluck up and be moved over here." Plucked up and be moved over here. Adam said, "Hey, level this level this mountain out a little bit." The mountain got leveled out out. &gt;&gt; And then when God called them, brother, he said, "Go have dominion. &gt;&gt; Dominion over every fish of the sea, over every foul of the air, over every creeping thing. Go have dominion and authority over all the earth." God's bringing you back to a position of authority and of dominion. And the Bible says that sin shall not have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking at I'm looking at a restored church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my heart. I'm looking through the eyes of this word. I see that masterpiece right in front of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said in the Garden of Eden, that masterpiece was marred and it fell flat on his face. But brother Brandham said in the message of masterpiece, he said God would not leave it that way. &gt;&gt; He said he come down on a funnel cloud spelled L O V E. He said he screamed out, I'll make a way back. &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between your seed and between the serpent seed. And he testified of Christ the son of man. Oh, brother, sister, it just goes so far. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is we've been restored &gt;&gt; by the message of the hour. God bless you tonight. God bless you. Bless Steven. Praise God. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a big clap. God is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a message of restoration. &gt;&gt; And tonight we have been restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain things he was speaking about the joy and this and this and this. Those things come through inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means somebody needed it. &gt;&gt; Was he here on Sunday? &gt;&gt; Did he hear what was preached on Sunday? &gt;&gt; How can the direction of Sunday pick up here? &gt;&gt; It is God &gt;&gt; restoring his children. &gt;&gt; My friend, stop kicking the can &gt;&gt; down the road. &gt;&gt; Whatever you kicking, stop kicking it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you kicking your healing, you know, I'm going to wait till it get there. I'm going to &gt;&gt; what? Oh, some people kick the healing. &gt;&gt; They are praying now, but they have God somehow down the road in the future will do it in a certain time. Kicking the healing. &gt;&gt; Kicking. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me summarize. Whatever you are yearning for, stop kicking that over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember the day the rapture will happen, &gt;&gt; it's over. &gt;&gt; All your project over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is the day. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; my brother. Wonderful sermon. &gt;&gt; May God install it. Strength. Amen. May God restore you strength and energy. Double. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Whatever was spoken, God sent his word. The Bible say he sent his word to heal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke tonight. &gt;&gt; Take was what was spoken and move on and claim what you need &gt;&gt; and move this when you leave this place here. &gt;&gt; When you leave this place here, remember what you heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let the devil &gt;&gt; come and remove that seed again. &gt;&gt; If you remove it, that's your problem. God have restored. &gt;&gt; I will restore. &gt;&gt; And the scripture is strange. It says the great army that &gt;&gt; who sent the army. &gt;&gt; We really don't want to look at that. Who sent the army? &gt;&gt; Okay, let me help you. So, it's going to be easy. Who sent the devil to Job? Now we clear &gt;&gt; now we okay? &gt;&gt; So so if God descending &gt;&gt; in other word God already knew everything. He already calibrated measure and knew the limit and everything. When he when he finished his plan &gt;&gt; he says now go ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a question. When Jesus was sleeping on the boat, &gt;&gt; do you think Jesus did not know what would happen? &gt;&gt; Before he got into the boat, &gt;&gt; do you think Jesus didn't know that I'm going to get in the boat and then when I get in the boat, I'm going to go to sleep and the devil would do this? So when God goes to sleep, if the disciple would have realized that if he's sleeping calm like this, &gt;&gt; he knows what's going on. &gt;&gt; We might as well just sit quiet &gt;&gt; because he cannot. In other words, God knew &gt;&gt; if you sink the ship, you sinking God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you can't sing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you fail, God fail. &gt;&gt; Strong statement. If you fail, God fail. &gt;&gt; I remember when my wife was overseas waiting, waiting, waiting. I say, "You know what? I'm going to start planning for the wedding." You heard that before? And I plan everything. And my wife was not here. She came one month before the wedding and her sister came. He said, "But Stephen, what about if she doesn't come and then you're going to lose all the money and everything?" It was not somebody on the street. It was a sister in the church that told me that with compassion, I'm just trying to make to make you see the other way. You know, you know what I'm saying? in in case you know you know brother we human we need to reason okay in case she doesn't come up so you see that you going to lose money I say if I fail God fail I don't even know where that answer came from one month she was here got married and it turned to a big testimony hold on to God &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; hold on to God no matter No matter how much, no matter how hard they look, hold on to God. &gt;&gt; God is a time God. &gt;&gt; You cannot fail. &gt;&gt; The vision is there. &gt;&gt; You won't fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly tonight. Father, we thank you for your grace, for your love, your mercy, and for speaking to your to our soul and to this church and your bride all over the world about the restoration.
