[0:51] you for some reason. He came from the
[0:53] patriarch. I was sitting a brother Kelly
[0:56] before even we start and the scripture
[0:58] keep coming and I have to write
[1:00] scripture. So we went we had even one
[1:02] person who was not even a message
[1:04] believer
[1:06] &gt;&gt; not even in a message came up with
[1:08] braided hair
[1:10] &gt;&gt; but you should see how the word
[1:12] [laughter]
[1:13] was going and piercing that soul.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; They were there right there.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I mean we went scripture and
[1:21] never I I taught them things I didn't
[1:23] even know myself because it was vow in
[1:26] the scriptures after scripture after
[1:28] scripture after they got so many
[1:31] scripture in the v a vow is a dangerous
[1:33] thing
[1:35] &gt;&gt; amen yesterday
[1:38] &gt;&gt; the bible say he binds your soul
[1:40] &gt;&gt; that's right [screaming]
[1:41] &gt;&gt; I brought that from the bible yesterday
[1:44] &gt;&gt; he brands your soul and you are binding
[1:47] your soul by a word
[1:48] &gt;&gt; that's Right.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; They have the scripture. They there.
[1:51] They have the scripture.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; So I told them be very careful
[1:55] &gt;&gt; what you telling young sisters.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Don't joke with your word
[2:00] &gt;&gt; because you're going to get bind.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Brandham say it's not
[2:05] even a preacher that bind you.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; I gave them a coach yesterday. Brother
[2:10] Brandham say it's not a preacher that
[2:11] marries you.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; He say you are married by your own word.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; By your promise. He say it's not a
[2:17] magistrate. It's not even a preacher.
[2:20] What we do here, we just sanction
[2:22] &gt;&gt; what you already have done somewhere
[2:24] else.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; So I told them, young man, it's not
[2:27] about decoration going in downtown and
[2:30] put uh candles all over and make a big
[2:34] show. I say you will be in trouble,
[2:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; What did I tell you yesterday? I say if
[2:44] I preach this to married people
[2:47] &gt;&gt; because we do vow by traditions
[2:50] &gt;&gt; we just repeat what people are doing and
[2:52] we grew up we saw wedding and everything
[2:54] do you know what you're saying when we
[2:56] give you the microphone we give this one
[2:58] the microphone you are sealing your life
[3:01] to death [laughter]
[3:04] &gt;&gt; amen
[3:05] &gt;&gt; if you have any question ask them they
[3:07] will give you scripture after scripture
[3:09] after scripture when we finish then we
[3:11] pick up brother Brham and you should See
[3:14] how everything is lining up with the
[3:16] word. It's impossible for this message.
[3:19] It's it it's God.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; This message is nobody but God
[3:24] &gt;&gt; to line up. When brother Brandham was
[3:26] speaking, he didn't give all the
[3:28] scripture I gave yesterday.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham just laid the
[3:32] foundation and when we took the
[3:33] scripture and took the message and put
[3:35] it together, hand and glove fitting all
[3:37] together.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; So I warned them stay away from trouble.
[3:42] I told them, I said, "You have a free
[3:44] way to not make any mistake and marry
[3:48] without any problem and we don't have to
[3:50] deal with anything because a vow is a
[3:53] dangerous thing."
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stick with what we are
[3:59] teaching the children here because I'm
[4:01] pulling that from the Bible and from the
[4:04] message of the hour.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to deal with divorce cases.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; No, sir. in your generation. I don't
[4:12] want to deal with divorce cases.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; You get married once for eternity.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we deal with the
[4:20] older generation people that got
[4:22] trouble, but you you don't have you you
[4:24] you have zero zero
[4:27] &gt;&gt; zero.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; No room for error.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Glory to God.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then I thought whoever missed
[4:37] yesterday, make sure you follow up with
[4:39] the deacon because I will hold you
[4:41] responsible for what I preached
[4:43] yesterday.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; And any marriage contrary to what I
[4:48] taught you yesterday, I am now going to
[4:50] bless you.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; You will find another pastor to bless
[4:56] you. I am now going to bless you because
[4:58] I want to stay there and when we cross
[5:01] on the other side, I want to be free to
[5:03] go to heaven. Amen.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Without having your blood in my hand.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Are we clear together?
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; So I told them the next session we will
[5:11] sit in question and answer me and them
[5:13] one on one. Open up. Just ask any
[5:15] question about marriage before we solve
[5:18] this problem. Amen.

[5:37] don't believe it. [applause]
[5:39] [laughter]
[5:41] &gt;&gt; It's up to you.

[6:11] building new houses.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Take your time right there.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME RIGHT THERE, BROTHER.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; THESE are my children. I told them when
[6:19] you hang around, you hang around. If you
[6:21] see a new neighborhood,
[6:23] &gt;&gt; where they are building new condominium,
[6:26] new houses, YOU GET THERE.

[6:29] QUESTION. What can I do to buy a house?
[6:32] So now you have the requirement and you
[6:34] begin to work on the requirement.

[6:45] because you start pulling again. I asked
[6:47] the question. I say do you know FSL FHA
[6:51] &gt;&gt; FHA loan?
[6:53] &gt;&gt; And everybody was quiet. I said this is
[6:56] the type of stuff I want you to know.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; You need to go and then pull what is FHA
[7:01] loan and get all the requirement of FHA
[7:04] loan because it's the government giving
[7:06] you money.
