reading the 70 weeks of Daniel and by God's grace everyone is listening to the message of the hour somehow amen amen somehow we have our head in the word there is nothing else that we can have and cling on to it but the word of God Amen Lord's willing on October the 21st this will be our question and answer brother Kelly if you would remind me I forgot I need to put the quote from the last question and answer meeting I promise to put some quot into the group chat so Lord's willing if you can remind me I need to go ahead and do it but the able confirm with me by the grace of God I don't

we'll continue with our question and answer for the Young's men meeting the other one I will deal with sister Divine and uh Lord's willing next Sunday uh brother Leon his church one of the member of

amen he's the first born from the male and he will be the first one to get married in the family so you will see brother Caleb next Sunday looking fancy just know something is happening amen amen glory to God I believe I got everything squared away let's go straight to our scripture glory to God amen amen I spoke this couple Sundays that I'm turning the corner and the Lord didn't want me to dig into it and we had to lay Foundation couple Sundays ago so I say I'm turning the corner and today I don't have any choice with turning the corner so the foundation has been set laid we're turning the corner so make sure you understand me very well am amen am if you don't get it raise your hand and I will repeat it again and when you go home please I know how busy you are more busier than me but make sure you go home and you review what has been laid here I don't have any choice this is what the message came for we got to shoot for the message of the hour amen amen amen yeah whether you like it or not I don't have any choice I have only one commission to deliver the message of Malachi 4 because that's the message of the hour amen amen that's my only commission I will never deviate it if you ask me a question I just repeat what br br saying that's all I give you the scripture I give you the quote I give you the scripture I give you the quote that's how you have been trained here so don't expect anything more than me so don't try to make me compromise I want amen am amen amen glory to God let's go to theonomy chapter 2 verse one thank you my friend I callot is on so uh he just gave me a [Laughter] signal so we're doing great wonderful service song service it was wonderful I cut off a lot of stuff because I need to go straight to the material because there's many laying in this scripture a whole lot yes so praise God H I wonder why Joseph had the B right and I was dealing with someone yesterday just uh my counseling I like family member talking and then the Holy Spirit drop that on me and I want to hide it and the person say hey if he drop when I'm talking to you it means he belong to me you need to deliver that so that person already knows the Revelation and finally I understood why Joseph have to get the birth right do you know that the birth R was given to Joseph you know that right do you know that if you don't know it's in first Chronicle 5 that's verse 1 and 2 the Bible say the birthright was removed from Ruben and given to Joseph because of what Robin did amen but before I start the scripture I'm sorry I got to Dr this okay if you notice if you read the story The Bible correctly Jacob never loved Leah you know that right Leah was force they play a trick and they put Leah into him but he never loved Leah he always loved Rachel everybody okay and the first born of Rachel was Joseph so so technically speaking Joseph should be the oldest [Applause] son amen but for some reason Leah was pushed before and the son of Leah became the firstborn which was Ruben and he did a mess and God removed the birth right and went with it and never gave to anybody else but he went went back and give it to Joseph because it belonged to Joseph to begin with Hallelujah yes sir in other word what God has for [Applause] you it doesn't matter how many politics will go around God will take a r back and give it back to you yes so don't give up let's go to the thron of me too glory to God you there amen you there amen then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea we read this last Sunday as the Lord spoke to me and we did what compass in other word we were circling turning around we did Compass we Compass months here many days you might be seated so Israel gather on this mountain this mountain which is called M amen when Israel got around this mountain for some reason Israel begin to circle around Israel was supposed to pass by the mountain and continue straight but there is like a wheel pool like a Vortex around this mountain when you get closer to that mountain it suck you into it you still in movement but you're not progressing everybody okay Israel was still alive sir but not moving but not moving forward amen mon won't move it's a mountain and the people that were living there won't move they are settle amen but Israel was not settled because that was not Israel [Music] possession everybody okay everybody okay Esau was settle yes that's his possession there is no thring in Esau isau doesn't have anything to work out for yes sir but Israel was not have not reach the destination yet everybody okay everybody good everybody good so when you are growing in this message you need to be careful who you hang [Applause] around we told you yest Sunday brother Bram say Esau came from the same Revival as Jacob everybody okay you need to be careful who you are around because they could be in a s mode in the relaxed mode in the mode that they don't need any more progression but God is De with you differently I'm talking to the young people in this church so don't be looking at adult and people who linger so long in the message because you don't know whether they are progressing or they got settle if you hang around them too much you will begin to turn around amen amen the Bible say you have compassed this mountain how verse two and the Lord spoke to me saying you have compassed this mountain long enough turn you what so brother Bram we read this last Sunday said that Monir belonged to Esau that's what the scripture says and brother BR I'm say mon was a denomination amen am brother Bram say when something become a denomination it is dead and it will never rise anymore brother Bram Say Never in other word there is no more hope never it will rise again everybody okay so this walk of going around something and coming back on the same spot brother Bram called this the death walk everybody okay if you go around and you come back on the same spot and you're not progressing brother Bram say you hit the death work brother Bram said the only way you can get out of this you must have a guide and thank God Israel had a god which was the pillar of fire everybody okay a denomination can be a church in the message a denomination can also be a [Applause] person in other word when you come around this brother he doesn't strive for growing with the [Applause] Lord they develop what they call religious spirit the church is no longer something for progression but it's something to keep them warm enough and if you get along them too long you will find yourself you going in a circle because they will never talk about the promised land but you were not meant for mon you were meant to go beyond [Applause] Jordan everybody good jump to verse four and command and you the people saying you are to pass through the coast of your who God is calling him Brethren just like we call one another God bless you brother not one brother but Brethren they plural so who I'm talking to is somebody that you call brother I don't deal with denomination outside the message I deal with denom ation in the message that person that you call Brother you need to watch where is he at is he in the motion or is he settle if it settle they could have been deatha have struck them and he become a hindrance for you you're not moving forward you're just going around in a circle everybody okay we clear brother the Bible says that when you go through your brethren the children of Esau which dwell in s and they shall be afraid of you we talk about this last Sunday take your goodhead to yourself therefore and do what verse five not with them don't content with them don't start any argument the era of argument in this message is over the era of fighting with Doctrine is over yes sir amen amen m not with them amen m not with them for I will not give you of their land no no such much as a what fo bread not even a little bit don't even try amen amen because I have given man say to who es for what possession so give who gave Esau that possession so Esau received something from God yes sir but that which he received doesn't belong to [Music] you even though he come from God you got to know where you going you need to know your destination if you have not reach your destination yet it doesn't belong to you that belong to Esau that's why Esau is in a relaxed mode in other word this is the further Esau can go in other word don't try to bring new revelation to [Music] [Applause] Esau he won't take that anymore Esau has Plateau Esau is stretched to his limit listen to what brother Bram say brother Bram say see that you don't go over on man now because I give that to who es that is all the father he supposed to go so people are stuck in doctrines they can't move anymore in other word there is no fresh revelation when you start bringing them up they're like where you getting those stuff they want you to continue warming up the microwave of a food that was already cooked by [Applause] someone don't worry my friend brother Bram say that is all he know knows about that is the only thing he knows is what his denomination it is his Camp it is his click you bring a scripture a coat he will never catch that coat because that coat will destroy their click all of them in the click preach the same way they preach the same thing nobody can go beyond the click because if you go beyond the click amen you are tempering into new territory they don't want to temper in New Territory they got used two months here everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay if you linger long enough it looks like they keep repeating the same [Applause] thing if you go to the meeting it's like a routine every year it's the same until the young people are tired they already know what's going to happen I'm preaching to this [Applause] church there is no more fresh anointing that is coming to push the people [Applause] [Music] forward brother brandham say oh we are so and so we are that's all he knows that's all God give him just by just pass by now on just pass on by now don't go to fasting and fighting with him just pass how quiet but look here Jacob you Pentecostal Jacob you really what born again that is got the what experience and led by who the holy don't go fasting with him but the Pentecost of Jacob has to has the what full promise where down in the land not there the thing that is going to happen God say the whole thing and put you in the promised land with the fullness of the waters spirit with every what operation as long as you have not seen that yet you have not reached your destination everybody okay everybody okay if it doesn't happen in your life you have not reached the destination yet so don't let nobody set you [Applause] down glory to God watch verse six you shall buy meat of them for what money that you do what and you shall also buy water of them for what money that you may do what we already explained this for the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand he knows you're working through this Great Wilderness uh this Great Wilderness this how many years 40 years the Lord your God has been with who the you have lacked what nothing they lack nothing but they were not in the promise 9 yet [Music] they lack nothing but they were not where God want them to be yet so you got to know what is in the promised land that right now I'm eating the Mana right now my clothing are not wor now my shoes are still the same but God is saying you have not reach yet and this isau brother Bram say they were B line they were very close to the promised land but they were not in the promised land so no matter how much you can bring out Esau will never swallow it because that's the further he can see if you sarch his eyes he get blurred he can't launch into the deep are we together are we together let's go to Joshua Joshua chapter 5 everybody okay we need to move northward sir if you look at verse 29 North word was you have to cross Jordan you can read it at home Joshua 5: 6 if you thereare you can say amen amen the Bible says for the children of Israel walk 40 years in the wilderness until till all the people that were men of what war they love to fight all the time which came out of what Egypt were consumed because they obey not the voice of the Lord to whom the Lord saw that he would not show them the land which the Lord SW to their father that he would give us a land that flows with what milk and honey so every Fighters dead everybody okay verse seven and their children not the fighters the children of the fighter that new generation come on that third generation amen whom he raised whom they raised up whom he raised up in their stead who raised them up Joshua go back read God God raised them up so God brought a new crop amen instead them Joshua did what circumcised we already went through this right so they were not even circumcised they were so busy on the fight until the children were not even [Applause] circumstanced and we wonder why are children leaving the message why are children having all this kind of stuff in the message the daddy were in a fight sit down to argue about the doctrines for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the water so what were they doing what kept them busy verse 8 and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abor in their place in the camp till they were whole in other word heill and the Lord said to Joshua this day have I roll the way the reproach of Egypt from off of you that worthiness is taken off from the church with a new circumcision of Joshua amen wherefore the Holy Spirit wherefore the name of the place is called gilar to this day and the children of Israel encamp in gilga and did what kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho they are in the promised land and they did eat of the what old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover and leav cakes and porch corn in the self same day and the Mana did what on the so when the corn come it turned off the Mana the Mana help for 40 years but when you enter in the promised land they turn off the Mana you need to eat the cornbread you cannot continue with a faith of manner you cannot continue with the faith of Mana that's right the faith of Mana we've been fighting all along no more Mana Faith cornbread I'm reading the Bible I'm reading the Bible in other word Israel progress and the cornbread is in the promised land when you get there no more Mana the Mana was Angelic food the Mana was good but it's no longer good in the Promised Land [Applause] can I say it again the Mana was good he kept Israel all along but when you enter to the promised land you cannot eat Mana you need to change [Applause] diet in other word as much as the man help you he can no longer help you in the Promised Land H so you better as long get used to the new diet because you won't see Mana no more but isau was in the wildness over there that's the territory of the Mana as we enter the promised land amen amen no more Mana this very good food this Angelic food was very good it kept us going on for 40 years but when you enter the promised land you got to leave Mana how can you leave something that God was giving you I'm just asking you a question the one who was rning Mana was God so how can you leave something that God was giving you the one who was sending Mana is God when they were in the wilderness if you refuse Mana you in trouble but when you enter in the promised land if you keep Mana you in [Applause] trouble in the promised landine you cannot eat Mana the diet of the promised land require corn Jesus say your father ate mana and they were all de so you can eat mana and [Applause] die and brother Bram say dead means eternally separated with God so in other word somehow in The Exodus the diet must change we got to leave the baby [Music] [Applause] diet the way you looking at me it's like I'm reading a different [Laughter] Bible amen amen am verse 12 and mana seiz on the morrow after they have eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana how anymore who turned off the Mana why didn't God leave the Mana and the corn together the two cannot work together the two food don't work together as much as we appreciate the Mana but we must transition we must shift he says anymore but they did eat of the water fruit of the Lamb of who came in that year and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lift up his eyes and look and behold there stood the pillar of fire you know that man was the pillar of fire right do you know that right you don't know that man okay slow down okay let's see that man he says and stood a man when we say a man we're thinking about me and you we stood a man opposite him with what his sword so in the promised land when the man es a man came and that man had a sword you need to know who that man is so you will know who the sword of the what kind of Sword is there that sword was never shown in the [Applause] wilderness I'm reading the Bible my did you see Moses a sword [Music] today amen amen and Joshua went to him and said to him are you for us or for our adversary and he says nay but as the who captain of the host of Who the Lord I am now how come let's identify this man before I move forward and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did what worship here oh Israel the Lord your God is how many God you shall worship only who so who is that man who is that man so that sword is the sword of [Applause] who so that s so okay let me read it again let me read down and he did worship and say to him what says my Lord do you see how he changed he begin to call him Lord Elohim what says my Lord unto what his servant so Joshua become his servant I thought he was a man amen and the captain of the Lord host say to Joshua do what lose thy Sho for of what for the place where on you stand is what what do heand [Music] you he reminds you of who can I jop this as the diet change God also changed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God changed from Mana into the old Corin and the pillar of fire change [Applause] also with Moses he was a pillar of fire but with Joshua he becomes a man with a [Applause] sword so the changing of diet goes with the changing of the word if you need the cot you tell me I will send it in the group chat brother Bram say the pillar of fire became man the pillar of fire was now made flesh brother Bram say he was a prefigure of Jesus Christ the lordos the word was now made flesh in other if you looking for a light you won't look you won't see the light it is really a man a man with a [Applause] sword in other word we are ready for the [Applause] fight it is time to take on your [Applause] possession in the word we are no longer thinking about the promised land we are not planning to reach the promised land we are in the promised land and if you are in the promised land you need to start getting ready to fight you have to fight for your children you have to fight for your husband you have to fight for your wife you have to fight for your business you have to fight for your finances you got to fight for your health you got to fight for your joy you got to fight for [Applause] everything and you are not alone you are not alone the captain of the host is there [Applause] everybody good everybody good I have a question the next chapter they went to Jericho Who Made Who who can make how can you shut and the Wall come down so who was making the wall coming down you just Shout you just [Applause] speak so the captain is waiting for your command you need to tell God what to do you need to give God the signal you tell God go ahead and c and and crumble the thing [Applause] down and the captain say what do you want me to do this one what is next I'm here for [Applause] [Music] fight I don't know if I will preach the message I cut out a lot of stuff but I can't move let's go to let's go to Philippian [Music] 3 amen am amen amen the sword of the king so when they saw this heing Sabino what is is it [Applause] saying oh god let's go to Philippian 3 then we can pray amen amen glory to God Philippians 3 no more Mana we now in cornbread we are eating mature food and when you begin to eat mature food somebody's with a sword as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen amen amen Philippians 3:13 if you thereare you can say Amen am brethren count not myself to have what in other word I have not reached that devil yet I'm still moving on amen amen he says but this one thing I do I do what for those things which are behind and do what reaching forth unto those things which are before so what is before is not one thing it's things amen amen so no matter how Paul was progressing Paul knew that he have not reached where he's going everybody okay he says I press toward what the mark for the priz of what the high call so so there is a high calling and Paul understood that I'm call God is using me God is Healing The Sick but I have not reached that hype calling in other word Paul is unsettle he's always pressing to reach somewhere when you said that you die everybody okay he say I press toward the mark of the price of the High Calling of God where in Christ Jesus so that price is in Christ listen to brother Bram brother Bram say like Paul saying those things Paul never was a person that like to stay too long in one place I'm reading brother Bram I'm reading brother Bram amen he doesn't want to stay too long in one [Applause] place Amen brother Bram say he like to do what move on move on how deeper one time in the scripture he say I forgetting those things which are in the past I do what press toward the mark of the High Calling he keeps what pressing on everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father this noon thanking you once again for your grace your love your mercy for your presence and for everything you have been doing for us Lord we are committing once again this service unto th hand Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children and bless us all together as we commit it all unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen my subject this morning is the four phases of rof Shifting to great faith everybody okay we are shifting to a great faith amen amen amen am we are still on the last phase of roof when we talk about the condition of roof before the Rapture how should roof be before she take off we want the Rapture yes but you need to know how what what level you should be before God come and reach you out because if you have not reached the level yet you are not ripe yet God won't eat a green bread you must be well wrapped mature because he is mature so whatever need to associate with him need to be on the level of God God cannot marry human [Music] [Applause] [Music] God marry [Applause] God God will marry God a dog marry a dog an elephant marry an elephant human being marry human being God also marry God so for you to be married to God God must be go must see God in you [Applause] glory to God amen amen we talked about faith claming with faith and we move on from faithless you remember unto great faith amen because faith has category I read to you all the quote of brother brandham we have little faith brother Bram you say you can have that much faith that much Faith there is different categories of Faith amen but our goal is to move all the way to the great faith everybody okay in other words Faith grows and Jesus say if you have a faith like a little Master seed amen that Faith need to grow because Jesus said the master seed need to grow then it become a great tree Paul says this Amen in the book of 2 Corinthian chap 10:1 15 he said not boasting of things without measure that is of other men's what labor but having what when your faith is what increase so your faith need to grow up your faith need to increase and when we talked about great faith we Define what great faith is amen we found that that great faith is the faith that worry about the spoken word only amen it's a faith that doesn't care about the distance everybody okay it is a faith that can push something away from you or he can pull something toward you amen it's a faith that you don't need no prayer this Faith you don't cast start devil don't worry my friend it's a faith that rely on Authority you remember this and knowing who you are amen I'm going to refresh you that's fine amen it's a faith that is lying about what you say and saying the right thing yes sir amen and this saying of a right thing is like you teaching God we talk about it amen let's go to Matthew 8 let's drill something now that we Landing amen Matthew chapter 8 if you thereare you can say amen amen Matthew 8 verse1 please follow me carefully my brother whoever you going to listen to this sermon before you fight follow carefully go back two Sundays Amen brother uh uh the Bible says when he Jesus come down from the mountain everybody there Matthew chapter 8 verse one I'm waiting for you to catch up if you dare you can say Amen am okay when he come he was come down from the mountain great multitude followed him and behold there came a leper and did what worship him saying Lord we already went through this in prayer if you will you can make me have clean we clear are we clear watch verse three and Jesus did what put forth his hand Jesus touched him Jesus laid his hand upon him follow me carefully amen Jesus put forth his hand and did what touched him touch him and say touch him saying I will be th what queen and immediately his leprosy was what and Jesus said to him see you tell no man but go your way show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to who so in chapter 8 right here the first miracle that Jesus is fulfilling someone asked him about the healing and Jesus turned around and use his hand and touch the man amen and the man was healed immediately so it's a miracle that was laying with a touch Jesus have to lay hand everybody okay on this person lay hand on this person to be healed amen watch the next story verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came to El there came to him a centurion beseeching him in another version he also worshiped him amen and saying Lord my servant lies at home seek of the what grievously have Tor and Jesus said to him I will come and do what that's why brother brandham said Jesus wanted to go lay hand on him we clear so far we clear verse 8 the Centurion answer and say Lord in other word push the break Jesus is still laying on the faith of laying hand on [Music] people Jesus Christ is on the level of laying hand on the people everybody okay but somebody turn Jesus on [Music] [Applause] remember all Faith come from God you need to know where you touching him everybody okay amen when when when this Roman Centurion came and spoke to Jesus Jesus responded like he did the other one he said you know what oh he's sick I'm coming and heal him he said hold on Amen hold on I need to show you what kind of faith I'm dealing with I'm reading the [Applause] Bible you need to guide [Music] [Applause] God don't worry my friend he said you need to know who you are he said I am not worthy that you should come under my roof you don't need a Uber why you troubling yourself to come to my room my home is here when you when you deal with me you dealing with my house you don't need any displacement when I'm coming here I'm representing my house that's what Joshua say as for me and [Applause] what you don't need to go individually and touch my chair and touch this no no no no no deal with me I will tell you what you need to do in my [Applause] house you deal with me I know what is going on in my [Applause] house am I helping you let's go he says I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof but do what speak the word only speak the word how only in other word there is only one thing I need from you I don't need for you to move I don't need your physical being I just need one thing only there is not in other word after that I don't have anything else to ask you sir so if you asking God one thing make sure that one thing covers [Applause] everything everybody together everybody good he says one thing do I need only what do I need he says one thing that I need only do what I just want you to speak the word only and my servant shall be what so all I want is say something if you say something me and you we are over let me continue for I I am a man under Authority it's right there in the board it lays on Authority having Soldier under me and I said to this man do what go and he goeth and to another what so you can pull something in and out everybody okay and to another one come and he comes and to my servant do this and he doesn't when Jesus Heard It In other words somebody begin to teach Jesus that all along here you were dealing with Father caliber but I'm going to make you know also who you are I know that in you you have more than just laying [Applause] hands and let me activate that that more the way I know it is because myself I'm under the authority when I'm under Authority I use my word I use command and command move stuff without me being involved in other word if I want to build a building I don't need to be there I can just speak the word and the building will be there if I want my car to be washed I don't need to be there if I speak the word I go to sleep I'm expecting to come out that car need to be washed I don't need to supervise who is there to make sure they're doing the work can I continue glory to God he says verse uh 11 10 when Jesus heard it he did what Marvel and said to them that follow him verily I say to you I have not found so great faith no not in what Israel so there are two things here we already understand this number number one this Roman Centurion refuses a physical contact sir everybody okay and number two Jesus is saying clearly that this kind of faith is not at the Jewish people in other word this Faith you will always found it at the Gentile amen because we found out that this faith can happen in man which is the Roman Centurion and this faith will happen also in woman which was the Saran woman both of them were not Jews amen the Saran even tried to approach like a Jew and Jesus kept silence in other words God was giving you a signal that you are you are shooting lower than what I made [Applause] you I don't know if you get me she was coming as son of David Son of David and Jesus look he say a gentile trying to be a Jew if she knew who she [Applause] is everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay and the woman keep begging Bing Jesus say how can I activate this thing he turned around he said you [Applause] dog that Faith only look for the word of Jesus if Jesus ever speak something he put himself in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] trouble as soon as Jesus spoke something she didn't use anything else but what Jesus spoke she said ah you using dog let me get dog you know what dog is dog eat the crumbs of the children table Jesus look he said that's what I was looking for I know you can do better than that everybody okay and Jesus say for this say the woman never use the word Jesus [Music] Christ everybody okay for this saying the devil over there is gone the woman never say Satan now you can leave my children what she spoke take care of the devil everybody okay everybody okay so it's a faith that Jewish people don't have it takes gentile people but the danger of the sarof phenician woman she was a gentile but she's trying to approach God in a Jewish way which way was also working everybody okay everybody good everybody good so the major two I'm handling today is she refus any physical contact with God the man and it's a faith that lays within the Gentile and Jesus called this great faith and Jesus says this in verse 11 he says and I say unto you that many shall come what from the East and West and sit down with who Abraham and who Isaac and who Jacob in the king om of what heaven he didn't say Israel he said Jacob amen Israel was not born yet in other word it's in other word these people identify with Abraham before he became a [Applause] [Music] Jew sir everybody okay and that's why they will sit with Abraham with Isaac with he stop because after Jacob Israel start but you cannot find that faith in Israel you have to be outside of the band of [Applause] [Music] Israel everybody clear everybody clear so it's a faith that refuse any physical contact and it's a faith that you only find at the Gentile everybody okay listen to brother Bram now brother Bram say the seven Angel message under the same what trumpet everything exactly the same seal is to what in other word what is he going to do he's to call the people the bread out of the what Pentecostal and what world tradition stop so the message of brother Bram is a message that would do something to us everybody okay everybody okay when he does something to us whatever that message does it will pull you from two tradition he will remove you from Pentecostal tradition and he will remove you from the tradition of the world amen but if you are pulled from a Pentecostal tradition and from the word where is he bringing you to brother Bram say the BR out of the Pentecostal and word tradition to the genuine what which is what the word so this message have to take you all the way to the [Applause] word he bring you to the word because the Roman sanio say speak the what word everybody okay he said to the word which is Crist how impersonated in his what word made flesh among who us listen to brother BR I'm cramming my friend he says so it is with the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we live living to bring forth children of this what age we are not Lutheran we are not wling neither are we P so if somebody get in the message church we should be different than [Applause] Pentecostal a mess a church should be different than a Lutheran should be different than a prian church it should be different than a Baptist Church in other word The Message Church is a unique [Applause] Church the only way you can compare a message Church a message church is compare with the [Applause] word everybody clear brother Bram say we we got to be children of this age through what the pregnancy of the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth what a child of this age a what the sea child amen I hope you understand could not be pregnant no so what did he do he did what put her away into what divorc but she Dar put him away he did what put her away brother Bram say God put all this church in divorcement like the king did to V amen and brother Bram say the reason why God did that they did not want to move with the further part of the [Applause] word everybody okay everybody okay so our church should be different that's when you get into a message Church it should be different than any denomination different in our way of dressing different in our way of talking different in our singing and our preaching can I continue can I continue where are you taking me brother Steven brother Bram say the idea is not to touch me amen it's to touch who now America it is the very hard things to get to them let me go this way amen now America it is a very R thing to do what they are used to people laying their hand on [Applause] them that's all right but that was the old Jewish what custom the gentle custom was what I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof but do what just speak the word and my servant will do what he knew the authority of the what word because he say he was a man under the what [Applause] Authority relax my friend the scripture now will begin to fly your mind brother Bram say my Ministry is not lay hand on [Music] you can I continue he says it's not lay hand on you that is a Jewish what tradition the Jew say my daughter is laying sick unto Bed Death come and lay your hand on her she shall get what well but the Gentiles say I'm not worthy for you to come under what my RO just do what speak the word and my servant will do what Jesus say I have never found a faith like that where in Israel we are still moving my friend what are you trying to say this morning brother Bram say tomorrow night the Lord willing we're going to take those prayer card and bring them across this platform praying for them now that seemingly is the approach that the people [Applause] [Music] want I'm reading brother Bram it is what we want where did we learn that where did we learn it brother Bram say it is the approach that the people what want why you want to be a Jew I don't [Applause] know brother Bram say why do you want to be a Jew when you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you want to act like a natural Seed of Abraham Hallelujah everybody good he said I don't know but that is a Jewish what C GLE never acted like that in the [Applause] Bible sorry I'm taking your baby dog I'm taking your teddy bear today away from you I have a big bear a big teddy bear I'm pulling your teddy bear today away sorry today your teddy bear is gone you won't leave this church with your teddy bear everybody okay he said the Jew says what come lay your hands on my daughter and she shall get what well the Gentile says what I'm not even worthy that you come under my roof but do what just speak the word and my servant will do what I told you I'm turning the corner sorry my friend brother Brown I'm say that's true but you see I can I can be oral Robert although he is my bosom friend and a wonderful man of God yet I cannot be Oro Robert Oro Robert cannot be William [Applause] Bram we both have a what Ministry Oro Robert is doing what God tell him to do I am doing what God tell me what to do and we have been taught a custom of what laying on of lay hand upon me that was a what Jewish if you follow in the scripture the Jew says what come lay your hands on my daughter and she shall do what but the Gentile he says what I'm not worthy that you come under my roof but do what speak the word and my servant will say Jesus never said to the to Jas great is your faith but he said to the Gentile I have never seen such Faith as that in what Israel that is what we can hardly train the American people to do my friend I'm in America I'm going to deal with the demon here everybody okay he says what that is what I can hardly train American people to what do is to receive Christ and what he said don't worry my friend we claming brother Bram says this that there has been how many there has been three different kind of seed what a denomination of seed by who Billy he was the head planter or a Robert for the what Pentecostal Pentecostal seed has been planted I'm talking about organization now then the word has been what which side are you in who is your your messenger I'm asking you who is your messenger who do you follow Billy all right Robert ask for me in my house my messenger is William Mar [Applause] [Music] BR Hallelujah and the seed brought Brown and PR is the word glory to God glory to God he said now you shall have to understand folks I ain't saying this no more unless what God tells me I want you to get this good and how three seed has been what which seed do we put in our [Applause] church what have we been preaching in our church which seed did we plant in people did we we plant denominational seed did we plant or Rob seed when people behave like Pentecostal or did we change with Billy Graham when people belong I mean behave like Baptist which seed is in the church watch the behavior of the people you will know the seed that has been [Applause] planted because we can keep the word message we can say We Believe the message but the way we preach are like [Applause] Baptist everybody okay everybody good if you listen to a preacher in the message you put even T Jak is better than [Applause] them you wonder what are they preaching we have only one seed that's the spoken word which is the Original Seed if you plant the message every seed will reproduce on its [Applause] own sorry my friend glory to God brother Bram says brother Bram says where is the problem with this thing when we says I'm in laying hand this is what brother Bram say he says he turned around and say I have never found Faith like that where in Israel now that is where I try to get the people to do what believe the purpose of brother BR is to push you toward great faith amen the purpose of this message is for you to reach the great faith brother say you know many people say Oh Glory to God brother so and so laid hand on me and what Hallelujah I did what that kind of look like the brother had something to do with

father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the what Jews so salvation is of the Jew salvation came from the Jew salvation came from the Jew but the Jew had a tradition and their tradition was the laying on on hand and all Apostle were Jews [Music] [Applause] say Amen every apostle was a Jew so the Apostle and Jesus Christ carry a tradition that they bled into the [Applause] church and brother Bram say it is Apostolic because all of them were Jews and salvation came from the Jew so not only did salvation come but the tradition of the Jew were also introduced into to the church hold on my friend I know you waiting on Mark 16 that don't worry I'm loaded everybody okay verse 22 but the hour cometh and now is when the true what worshipers shall worship the father where in spirit and in what truth for the father seeketh what such to worship so we found out here that brother Bram says that the apostolic way is of laying on hand because all Apostle were Jew so They Carried that even Jesus Christ adopted that but the same Jesus say uh uh uh uh uh uh uh when I look at this kind of faith I don't see this faith in Israel but Salvation came from the Jew but how do you deal with Mark 16 brother stepen let me answer you now brother Steven brother Bram says this I want you to remember this and I try to go I try to go over it in the morning again Gentile brother Bram just say that even the Holy Ghost is received by what the Holy Ghost was received by what and he came from the Apostle but listen to what brother Bram says he says gentle the gospel that is given to them is a what F gopel not a what I'm answering brother Steven I'm not answering you I'm answering brother Steven who asked me the question he say and I like and and like I said last night when the Holy Ghost fell at what Pentecost when they went down to the Jews act 195 to the who Jews act 195 they had to do what lay hands on them that they did what receive it and when they went to the Mar half Jew half gen they had to do what lay hands on them but when they went to the Gen at the house of [Applause] who what what Peter spake these words not what L on hand everybody okay everybody okay when when when the Apostle went to the Jews God honor laying on hand when they went to the Samaritan half Jews half Gentile because they knew the Jewish custom God gave it to them but when Peter entered the Genta he was waiting for a prayer line God's Ambush speed [Applause] he said Peter this is a different territory this is not Jews these are not Samaritan this is a different territory if I give you too long you going to lay hand on [Applause] [Music] them I'm just at the beginning my friend I'm just said the beginning can I say something can I say something if you notice what Peter was preaching was not even about the Holy [Applause] Ghost what the woman was saying to Jesus have no relationship with the sickness let's go to act 10 Hallelujah father help me let's go to Acts chapter 10 keelly I'm sorry I'm pushing I don't want to leave you in the air we got to lay this thing down amen let's go to act 10 if you thereare you can say amen amen act chapter 10 and go to verse uh uh verse 34 because when we say laying on hand the the Holy Ghost maybe some of you believe that Peter went and say okay today we're going to preach about how to receive the Holy Ghost oh today we're going to preach about what is the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost given for how to receive it watch how the Gentile receive the Holy Ghost hallah we need to see which subject is preach and how can a subject like that bring the Holy Ghost are you ready are you ready are you ready let's go to verse 34 then Peter did what open his mouth and say of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of what person but in every nation he that fear Him and work righteousness is what accepted with him the word which God sent to the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all that word I say you know which was P he's giving a history uh uh published throughout all uh Judea and begin From Galilee after the baptism which John preached how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him and we are witness of all things which we did he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem who whom you whom they slew and hung on the tree him God raise up the third day and show him what open not to all the people but the witness chosen before God even as who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify and to testify oh my God and to testify that is he to that is he to testify that it that it is he which was ordained of God to be judge of the living and the dead to him give all the prophet witness that through his name whosoever believe in him shall receive remission of sin what is the Holy Ghost there when Peter is preaching he's introducing who Jesus is everybody okay the Holy Ghost [Applause] interrupted the subject is not about the Holy [Applause] Ghost Jesus Christ he says why P yet what spake these words the Holy Ghost did what fell on all which heard the word he was not preaching about the Holy Ghost in other word in the Gentile [Applause] category in the Gentile territory when you come to church Church you must be on the [Music] expectation it doesn't matter the subject on the pulit even if the subject is off God don't care about that God sees your [Applause] heart don't wait for me to preach the Holy Ghost before you can receive the Holy Ghost even if I'm preaching about the second coming God can give you the Holy [Applause] Ghost listen to this brother Bram he said but while he is at what cornelius's house while he SP yet this what word the Holy Ghost did what fell on them not laying on what of hand the Holy Ghost fell when they heard the what truth they were how hungry and what waiting for it so when you come to church you come hungry if it's a healing God will jop by the preaching of the word he bring the spirit of God and the spirit of God is operating if it's a holy ghost He baptize you if it's a healing he heals you if it's a fanes he give it to you you don't need nobody laying hand on [Applause] you speak the word [Applause] [Music] [Applause] only I I'm I'm I'm 30% of the sermon my friend do you know brother Bram say Paul was a man that want to go deeper you remember that right let's listen to Paul because in Mark 16 Jesus said do what lay hand listen to Paul who was shooting for the price of High Calling let's listen to Paul [Applause] now brother Bram say I preach like who let's listen to Paul therefore doing what leaving the leaving the what principles of the doctr of Christ let us go on to what [Music] [Applause] Perfection Hallelujah Paul say let's leave the Wilderness let's go to the promised [Applause] land everybody ready you ready let us go on to what not laying what against the what Foundation of repentance from what de word of what faith toward God and what the doct of baptism and the what laying on of hands [Applause] [Music] h I'm reading there it's there verify in your Bible Paul say we need to let the baby staff we need to start moving toward the Perfection don't rely again on laying on hand how can the great apostle that make the pillar of fire come and contradict Jesus [Applause] Christ because he was a Jewish custom but Paul was an apostle to the [Applause] Gentile the Bible say Peter was sent to the circumcise and Paul was sent to the UN circumcise Peter was sent to the Jews and Paul was sent to their circumcised and when Paul begin to speak he said listen we need to lay it down this laying on on hand we need to move toward Perfection and Paul say when that which is perfect will come [Applause] when the Capstone will come that which is temporary will be done away the Mana have to be blocked we need to eat the old corn listen to this my friend listen to this my friend come on do you give me a few minutes it says we people here where in America has been taught that you got to lay your hand on what lay hand on them well that is what a Jewish idea that is not a gentle by the Bible you remember Jesus saying come lay hand on me on on on my daughter and she will leave Jus but the Roman Centurion say what I'm not worthy that you come under my house but do what speak the word Jesus said that is the what greatest not great but greatest I never saw that where in Israel but we just don't seem to be able to comprehend it where in America listen to me forget about me being an African I'm not attacking American I'm an American citizen myself an American I'm a brother but I'm repeating the message whoever was struggling with that take that away brother Bram says this he say Jesus turn around and look at those what Jews I have never seen Faith like that in what isra that's why that is what I'm trying to get what to the people you don't see Faith much like that in what America brother julus you found it where Africa where India and in places like that but not where in America you got too much theology in America you got too much spiritual what too much denomination and we choke the word by our tradition we made the word of God of [Applause] nonin hold on my friend he says he knew that all sickness and disease was what under the control under my feet control of the who Lord Jesus therefore he didn't have to come lay hand on the what just do what speak the word and my servant will do what Jesus Marvel and he said what I've not found fa like that in Israel so I sure hope that I live to see the day when we will have that kind of what what kind of Faith just do what speak the word and my servant will be what oh it will be a what that day has arrived yes brother Bram we are in that day we must speak the word and things will begin to pop [Applause] up let's stop here let's stop here God richly bless you we need to reach that time we are in the season the season of the third [Applause] pool don't be crying anym more remember who you are speak the word the angel is here Lord is here the captain of host is [Applause] here let me stop here because if I go I will go too far everybody okay let's stop here if you still in the little faith and you want me to lay hand on you I will continue to lay hand on you I will pray for you if you want me to pray for you lay hand on you I will do that I don't have any problem with doing that but still I have to push you until you reach a level when the word is coming you are waiting for nothing else but the word we coming to church for nothing but the word and once you receive the word your problem is over I have to stop here I can't go further let me stop here if I continue we will go this is a foundation I know will trouble people but I gave you the scripture I gave you the quote and I back it up with the Bible go home and chew on this and we will come back again and clam higher on this everybody okay if your faith is too little as Jesus told Thomas he said you want to touch me go ahead and touch me but Thomas the one who sees who doesn't see but believe is good if you need me to lay hand on you I will lay hand on you but remember if you can grab him by the word it is better than my hand we want all the credits to go to [Applause] him no more celebrities no more big pastors Hall no more so and so pray for the sick you don't have to wait 2 hours for me to finish the prayer line even if I'm preaching on something else if your heart is hungry God sees the heart will reward you accordingly the bible let me say this and I stop brother Bram went into the 10th Vision did you see anybody being touched by Brother Bram in the 10th Vision do you know what happened in the tent Vision they just push you into the tent everybody okay brother Bram don't go there they push you into it when you enter there if you were on the wheelchair when you coming out you pushing the wheelchair what happened there we don't know and and brother Bram ask the question he says why that L building and God gave him a scripture listen carefully God says go to Matthew you will see the Bible say when you praying go into your water and pray your

laia because I knew what caliber of a word I'm sending that's why your Prophet told us that the way you using the messenger is just an example to the way you will use every Believers of that Church Father Lord may you touch everybody yes L may you see where we are in our different level of faith and may you help us grow as the Apostle Paul say so that we can increase and we can match our Gentile dispensation where father we can take you by your word yes Lord Lord when you want to manifest the Messi son you did it in your flesh because he was Jewish you did it in your flesh to the Samaritan because of their tradition but when you look at the Gentile you say I don't need to be there physically am because the faith of the Gentile don't need my physical being father that's why you came in the person of MEC and you impersonate yourself again to produce the mic son without your physical body because you knew we were able to recognize those sign because we are Abraham's seed father may we recognize them power of the word and cling onto the word because the word will take us all the way through father I pray for every family the word has been spoken you know the need you know what they're struggling you know where the problem is let the word that was spoken this morning Father reach every Avenue reach every aspect reach every category of their life and touch and bring the
