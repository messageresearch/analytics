========================================

never doubted the promise. The Christian looks at the unseen. Remember, you are endowed with five senses. One of them is sight. But I'll prove to you your sight don't see everything. Here this morning, right in this room right now, there's living representations of creatures in this room. There's living voices in this room. If you do not, then go turn on the television and see if there isn't people plum across the nation that's being represented right here in this room this morning. There are figures and their beings is passing through this room. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Why? Only way you'll ever know it is a transmitter to pick it up and transmit it into reality. And the only way the church will ever know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever is get into that transmitter, the blood that transmits our sins away from us. and brings us across that chasm into the presence of God being sons of God which he represents himself in. Oh, what a great thing. If we'd look to that this morning, we'd forget the differences of the things that's in the world today and the things that other people are looking for and the great numbers and so forth. We're looking to Jesus Christ who is the author and finisher of our faith. Now remember, the whole Christian armor is supernatural. If you are a Christian, you say seeing is believing. You can never be a Christian if you believe that. For faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; You cannot be a Christian and have to see the thing. The whole armor of God is supernatural. Love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, channels, the Holy Ghost. It's all unseen. And the Christian doesn't look to what he sees with his eyes. He looks to what he sees with his faith. And his faith can only be based upon one thing. That's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I feel like you're shouting back. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. See, when you get to that word, that's the living thing. That's the word. &gt;&gt; When your mind and eyes can be single to that word and focus that in till you see exactly what gods are doing. What a wonderful thing. Abraham saw it. See, he did not look to any of the misunderstandings of the promise. What if he would have looked and said, "Here, I'm 75 years old and such and such a voice spoke to me and said, "I'm to have a baby by my wife. She's 65 years old, about 15, 20 years past menopause. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] [music] How do you [music] do?

She says, "I would like to praise our God for healing me of a really bad migraine." said, "Thank you, Father God, for healing me." Amen. That's from Sister Kayla. I want to bless the name of the Lord. Amen. Thank him for healing our sister. Amen. And this a prayer request from Brother John. He says, "Keep, please keep Sister Lisia in prayer." Amen. So, we're going to keep Sister Lisia in prayer. Amen. That's a prayer request from Brother John tonight. Amen. We have a testimony. Amen. from um sister divine. Amen. So we just call her to um share with us what the Lord has done for her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church. Um &gt;&gt; want to give this quick testimony. Um I gave a brief um testimony today this morning on on the group chats, but um I just wanted to thank God for my life. Um this morning I was heading to work. Um I had, you know, my original slow gospel music playing. Um, and I was, um, I think there was, there was either slow traffic or we were at a red light and there was a car in front of me and my foot was on the brake, you know, just waiting until it the traffic was clear so we can um, go ahead and go through. And then um I just heard a big bang hit the back of my car and then my head wrap even flew out out of the um out of off of my head. And then um it took me a while to kind of understand what was going on. And then so since the person hit me from behind, it pushed me to hit the person that was in front of me. So my head was hurting very very bad. Um it's still kind of hurting now. Um the accident happened this morning around like 8:00 and it's 8 now and it's still hurting a little bit. So, um I just know it was the devil especially um from yesterday yesterday's um prayer meeting. I know God um in this season in my life, he's doing um tremendous things and I know just the devil trying to bring me down. Um I was even on time for work. I was actually [laughter] my goal was to make it um to make it to work early so I can just get things done so when my students come, you know, the day can just, you know, go um the way it was supposed to, but that ended up not happening. Um, but also through this um, trial, I know the devil hates me. I hate him, too. So, we hating each other, but um, you don't know, I hate him more, but um, I know, you know, it was just him trying to discourage me. But through this, um, situation that was happening. Um, I just thank God that he actually revealed that I guess around this whole time, I didn't know, um, when, you know, the police officers came and everything and they were getting our information. Um, I end up seeing that the the the lady who I hit, she ended up leaving. then the person who, you know, who was at fault, he ended up leaving, but I was the only one just sitting there and I I didn't really think too much of it. Um, so when the lady came back, she was like, "Hey, you know that your license um is actually suspended." And I was like, "I suspend it." I was confused on why my license was suspended. Um, she said that it was suspended since um last December, and it's almost December now. So, this whole year I've been driving my car with a suspended license. Um, I guess it was due to a car accident that happened in 2023. And um to make a long story short, I end up calling the calling the DMV. I called the court and just I gave them documents like, "Hey, my ticket was paid for um since 2023." And I guess they saw in their record cuz when when that situation happened um the officer just told me I didn't have to go to court. I just have to pay the ticket online, which I did. Um so I guess apparently on their system, it was an error that I guess I was supposed to show in court. So that's where the error was. So I I just thank God that he was able to expose this situation. Um, so when I do get my car that was that I've been praying for that, you know, everything just goes through, you know, smoothly with with a license that actually works. So I just want to thank God for that blessing in disguise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim every blessing tonight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Um, we're going to invite brother Khala. Amen. um to thank the Lord for the life of our sister. Amen. This wonderful testimony and um healing sister Kayla and also bring before the Lord Sister Lisia in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, you're tremendous God. You are the almighty God. You are your You are all and all for us, Father. The creator of heaven and earth. Elleon, the possessor of heaven and earth. You are El Shadai. You are all of these. The Jehovah Gyra. You are everything to us, Lord Jesus.

Uh there was something that slipped me up on uh last Wednesday that was mentioned but I want to clarify if I can call it corrected brother uh Caleb in the scripture. I'm not the one who preach. I don't preach on Wednesday rarely. I preach on Wednesdays but Caleb came from the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; It's in the book of number chapter 13 verse 6. I pulled the brake but I knew I have to verify to make sure everything is clear. Caleb came from the tribe of Judah. It's in number 13 verse six but in type it's in the message the pgamus church age. Brother Brandham say Joshua is the type of the end time leader and he says Caleb is representing those that stay true with Joshua. So as a top it's a gentile but in the scripture from the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is a lion tribe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just want to clarify that one. He slipped me off and then the Holy Spirit touched somebody to remind me. I was not the one who preached but everything is good as a overseer. You watch those things and make sure we stay tune in and line up with the word of God. Amen. Brother Zach, what an inspiration. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So now we got to sing this a little bit more. So the congregation picked it up and he and he get between our God is tremendous and all those. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Two days ago in 30 minutes. So the anointing is on you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And it's sung on the day that his father is preaching. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bob Black, the father of brother Zach, is going to be the one ministering tonight. [applause] Amen. Brother Bob has been uh wonderful and he preached for us a while, but we felt led to bring him up again. So, he'll be the main speaker tonight and the Holy Spirit will move into him. I told him, "You home. We love you. Preach like home and we pull like home." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You need to get used because on Sunday we're going to climb again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. Praise God. Uh-uh. That's the way we want. Glory to God. Let's go with forever. Only believers only [music] believe. All [music] believe all [singing and music] things are possible. [music] Sing it to me. [music] [music] Everything [music] all s [music] like this. Lord [singing] I Lord [music and singing] I believe [singing and music] that [music] [music and singing] is Lord, I believe. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe [music] that all [singing] things are possible. [singing and music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to be uh back in the house of the Lord with you &gt;&gt; and to see how God is making you continue to prosper and and and dwell in his presence. Um we uh you know, Zach is my son and I'm so proud of him and and Lily and and it's good to be here to hear his uh his his song that he wrote. and uh and and uh we've heard from them so many good things about the wonderful things that the Lord is doing for you all here &gt;&gt; and it's good to come and see for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Um so let's just tonight I want to just take a little scripture um Philippians chapter 2 verses 5 to8 &gt;&gt; and u I'm I'm not too great with preliminaries and so forth so I'm just going to jump right in. And uh but we appreciate you all and I I sure I was telling your pastor that I appreciate I sure appreciate a a church and a people that love the word and are excited about it. &gt;&gt; And uh that that is so so wonderful in this hour &gt;&gt; that we're living in where so many are have become uh uh cold or apathetic to stay on fire for the word. &gt;&gt; Yes [clears throat] sir. But uh I I want to take a little topic uh tonight from this scripture. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Before we get into the word, let's just go to the author. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we're so grateful tonight for your anointing and for your presence, Lord. And surely an atmosphere of faith and believing has been set, Lord God, as all the songs have been sung. And Lord, the song was sung and I stepped forward. But Lord, I'm just your assistant tonight. And I pray God that you'll come up on the scene Lord Jesus. And help me Lord God that you Lord give utterance Lord to the things where I don't have any ability in myself to speak Lord and give hearing Lord where we're beyond our ability to understand Lord Jesus. And I pray God that you'll have liberty Lord to move among us tonight Lord Jesus. Lord we welcome your presence Lord and we surrender to your will Lord God. And we just ask that you'll move among us Lord God. And Lord, tonight Lord, surely there's there's some that are sitting here seeking direction in their life and needing different things, Lord. And we know that your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, Lord. And your word can speak exactly to each and every need, Lord. And that's what we're trusting in tonight, Lord Jesus. And we ask this blessing over the words, Lord, as we read. And we pray, Lord, that you'll give us the true meaning and the true essence of these things. And make it come alive to us in our hearts and our lives so that when we leave this place, it won't be just something that we learned about, but something that has become that that has begun to change our lives and change our character. We ask in your precious name. And so, uh, in Philippians 2:5, we'll just take, uh, from 5 to 8. And it says, "Let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; which was also in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. but made himself of no reputation, &gt;&gt; and took upon him the form of a servant, &gt;&gt; and was made in the likeness of men, &gt;&gt; and being found in fashion as a man, &gt;&gt; he humbled himself, &gt;&gt; and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross. God bless you, saints. You can take your seats. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason I think this is such an important question tonight, who are you? because it's it's important in the day and the hour that we're living to to to know to know what our position is and to be identified correctly. &gt;&gt; And you know, the Bible tells us that that a man really is thinking his thinking comes from not not not so much the head but from the heart. And as Proverbs 23:7 says, "For as a as a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he." And then I think tonight we can take from that that as we hear the word, it begins to actually change our mind, change our thinking, change something down on the inside. And actually, if we'll connect the dot tonight, Brother Brandham said that your mind, your mind is associated with your character. So as your thinking begins to change, your character begins to change, too. And you look at this scripture that is asking this question or or framing up the thought tonight that that Jesus had he was so much the expression of God, the character of God that he thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And he come down and he made himself of no reputation. So much character of Christ. So much character of God being expressed in this man until he took on himself the form of a servant. God manifesting himself in flesh. And maybe we could think about tonight, what will it be in this day when God comes down and manifests himself behind the dirt of your flesh and reveals himself to a fallen world? Oh, it it behooves us tonight to know who we are. I I want to know who I am. And the only way that I can know who I am is to look into the mirror of God's word. You you think what a nightmare it would be to not know who you are. You know, somebody could maybe come up to you and they call you something that would be incorrect or give you a label that would be incorrect or tell you something about yourself that would be false. And if you didn't know who you were, then you would go away and you'd believe that. You'd say, "Well, well, maybe they got a point. Maybe that's a good idea." And you'd go away and maybe you would you could imagine that you're something that you're really not. And it would begin to go in your mind. You begin to reason and begin to imagine things that are not really true about yourself. &gt;&gt; But a man that can identify himself, &gt;&gt; a man that knows what he really is is settled. And Christ is our example of a man that settled. So much settled in his identity until he could pack a cross on his back and go down to Galilee and and spread his arms wide and give his life and say, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. And and so settled in his identity, he knew who he was. And brother Ram would say the same humble obedient and self-sacrificing mind that Christ exhibited from being God informed to humbly becoming a servant and accepting death on the cross. That's the same kind of a character and the same kind of a nature that a Christian is going to manifest. &gt;&gt; Oh, we could ask this morning, are you willing to be a doormat? Are you willing to be a doormat? Are you willing to s to take that cross of Christ? If Jesus said, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." For we must be identified with Christ. We've got to Oh, we've got to be so identified with Christ until that same nature, the same life, the same makeup, the same mind. Let this mind that was in Christ be in you. I want the same thinking, the same thought process until like what we're singing only believe all things are possible. That's the kind of mind that we've got to have. No matter what the obstacle is in front of me, no matter what the mountain is, I believe that God is able. &gt;&gt; We've got to be identified with Christ. You know, we could take if we could take Christ &gt;&gt; and convert him into a thing that we could read, &gt;&gt; take all of his nature &gt;&gt; and all of his characteristics and all of his makeup and all of his secrets and all of his mysteries and all of the the back part of his mind and all the things just bottle him all up and put him into something we could read. We'd have this Bible here that we preach from. We'd have this this Bible that we open up in the morning when we're drinking our coffee or whatever you do in the morning. We meditate from Christ here in letter form. And the Bible is is full of all of these Bible characters that identify this nature, the characteristics of Christ. &gt;&gt; And through the Bible, we've got all these characters that we can begin to identify oursel with where brother would say it was Jesus Christ in Noah. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ in Moses. It was Jesus Christ in David. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ in Joseph. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. How do I know it's the same yesterday, today, and forever? Because his nature is the same. His doings is the same. His makeup is the same. And if he manifested his life back then in a certain way, he'll manifest that same life. Today, he's still the same. And whatever you have a need of today, he's still the same God to meet that need. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram would say, I'm sure tonight that we ought to find ourselves somewhere &gt;&gt; in some character of the Bible &gt;&gt; so that we would know the outcome of that character &gt;&gt; and know what our outcome will be. O to think about that that we begin to read about these characters and &gt;&gt; and and it's it becomes more than just a story. you learn about in Sunday school or a story you learn about at the knee of your mother. It becomes something that as you read about it, you begin to see the nature of Christ reflected in these individuals. And then you begin to identify yourself with these individuals. Like maybe maybe tonight you're going through a job on the ash heap moment. You're going through a season where you're sitting on the ash heap like Job. And you begin to read in the Bible what Job endured and about how he's how how how he got to a place where he could rejoice sitting on that ash heap. And you begin to identify yourself with with maybe with Noah or Elijah or Moses or Peter or Jacob. And you find what are you what are you doing? You're identifying yourself with Christ because Christ is revealed in every character in the Bible, every page in the Bible, every story in the Bible. It's the nature of Christ being revealed. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram will tell this little story about a little boy that went over to his grandmama's house and and he had he had grown up real poor and he he didn't even hardly know what a mirror was and he went he went around. He went behind the door and he found that that mirror and he began to look at it and he saw a little boy in the mirror and and by and by he began to look and he noticed well he moves his arm that little boy in the mirror moves his arm he moves his leg that little boy in the mirror moves his leg and he began to realize wait this isn't just another little boy this is me and he turned around and he said to his mama why mama that's me well that's the story of us looking in the scripture you read and you read and you begin to wonder what what who is this and you begin to identify that that's that's talking about you that story of Joseph is you that story of Noah is you and you begin to see yourself in the scripture and I'll tell you that's where a Christian gets their identity when you begin to see your same life reflected in the Bible then you begin to say you know what I am a genuine Christian because I can see my life written between the pages of the Bible Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, every one of us down on the inside, we've got that, you know, the scripture we're reading about, let this mind, &gt;&gt; something down on the inside that governs our character. &gt;&gt; Something down that soul down on the inside that governs the way that you think and the way that you react to situations than the way that you are. And you know, when you go look into a natural mirror, you see your flesh and you see the wrinkles and you see all the all the bags under I see all the bags under my eyes and all the problems of life. But you know, if you really want to see what that thing is way down in there, &gt;&gt; the only way that you can see is to look into the mirror of God's word and let the word reflect back what you really are. Oh, sometimes it reflects bad things back. all but when it begins to through the course of life through season after season things begin to drop away and you begin to see that it's becoming the nature of character of Christ reflected back then you've got your identity then then you know who you are then you know where you come from like brother said I I I'm not from Charles and Ella Brandom I know where I come from I come from I come from God &gt;&gt; and I'm going back to God &gt;&gt; and brother Bram said and that's what we want to look at tonight. &gt;&gt; And when he's preaching this sermon so many years ago that I'm basing this message off of tonight, he said, "I want to look at me &gt;&gt; and I want you to look at yourself." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we could frame that up tonight just like that. I want to look at me &gt;&gt; and I want you to look at yourself. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to see myself in God's looking glass." That's it. &gt;&gt; Cuz if anything will show you where you're standing, &gt;&gt; it's this book. That's it. It's this book. There is no book like it &gt;&gt; cuz it is all truth. &gt;&gt; Now, aren't you glad tonight that we've got a book that we don't have to wonder, well, is this part true? &gt;&gt; We don't have to wonder like so many other books there are in the world. Is this is this true? Is this Everything about this book is true. Everything in this book is true. And if there's anything wrong, it's me as I'm looking in this book. There ain't nothing wrong with this book. And there ain't nothing wrong with the message. God gave us a pure, complete message. And if there's anything wrong, I've got to tally my life up with it. We're not trying to make the message tally up with us. We're trying to make our life tally up with this message. Now, aren't you glad that God give us a perfect word, a perfect message to make a perfect bride to take us in a perfect rapture. God give us everything that we have need of bottled up in this word for us. &gt;&gt; The mirror shows us ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. When I look into the mirror of this word, sir, &gt;&gt; it won't show me the person next to me &gt;&gt; or even maybe even the behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; or your spouse or your children. &gt;&gt; We can get so interested in understanding everybody else sometimes that we fail to understand ourselves. But when we look into the mirror of God's word, it identifies exactly what we are. Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And you know, you don't tonight. Somebody can label you, as we were saying. Somebody could put all these different labels on us, but you are not identified by the label that someone else gives you. And somebody could say, well, he ain't even born again. And somebody could say, well, that person's not very intelligent or or or maybe put labels on you like, well, they're Pentecostal. They're they're poor or they're intellectual or they're charismatic. But we are not identified by labels that somebody puts on us. We are identified by life and as we receive the word is changing our life to be like him. That's my identification is the life and the nature and the characteristic of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got to understand ourselves. &gt;&gt; You know the disciples when Jesus began to break bread with them, he told them one of them was going to betray him. They wanted to know is it me? Am I am I the Judas? Is there something wrong with me? Psalm 139 says, "Search me, oh God." And David's crying out, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts." Second Corinthians says, "Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith, prove your own selves." Lamentation says, "Let us search and try our ways, and again unto the unto the Lord." And Galatians says, "For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. But let every man prove his own work. And the way that we prove and the way that we examine and the way we try oursel is to look into this word and see look into the mirror of God's word. You know sometime many times when you look into the mirror of God's word you're standing there alone just like that little boy &gt;&gt; looking behind that little door &gt;&gt; and he looked in the mirror. He's standing there standing there just brother would say the walk with Christ is an individual walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; You walk. You stand alone. &gt;&gt; With you and God alone. &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor. &gt;&gt; You and God alone. &gt;&gt; Not you and the deacon. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you and your wife, you and your husband, but you and God alone. &gt;&gt; You stand alone &gt;&gt; on your convictions. &gt;&gt; God deals with individuals. &gt;&gt; You know, sitting here tonight in this congregation, there's many of us gathered here together. But you know, as the word goes forth and and you're we're comparing ourselves with the word, God is dealing with us, each of us as individuals. &gt;&gt; There might be somebody sitting to your right and to your left, but the word is dealing with your heart, dealing with you, to expose frailties, to expose faults, to uncover weaknesses, God, and to expose whether we're genuine or whether we're true. God is dealing with individuals, you know, even to the point where he said when like a little chicken when it's hatching out of the eggshell, it's got to do it alone. You can't help it because if you help it, then it comes out and it's going to, you know, you you kill it and it it'll start relying on the person that helped it out instead of on its relationship with God. You got to hatch out of that egg alone. You got to fight your battles alone. You got to look into that mirror of God's word alone. Alone in your own alone time in the in the dead of night, staring up at that ceiling, meditating with God, crying out to God. Oh, that's where battles are fought. Alone with God, finding out who we are. Who am I, God? Examine me. Try me. See if there be any wicked way in me. See, am I the Judas? Is there something wrong with me, oh God? Examine me and try me, Lord. cuz it's necessary to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Not just who you are as a church &gt;&gt; or who who you are as a people, but who you are as an individual. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown would even say we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We know what we are. We need to know who we are in order to have faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And brother, I'm going to say Jesus gave us the example &gt;&gt; of what we ought to be looking at. &gt;&gt; When he reflected his life to us through the word, &gt;&gt; what we should see when we look into God's mirror, we should see our self identified with him. That is a perfect example. And he said as we go along through life, our character molds the image that we are. Each one knows that you as you live so is your character molds you to what you are. It's your character. Your life the word being expressed in the day and the age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; As we hear the word, &gt;&gt; you know, as you hear the word, &gt;&gt; you begin to understand why I am the way I am. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Why is it that I act the way that I do? &gt;&gt; That's right. Why is it that I want the way that the things that I do? &gt;&gt; Why is it that I seem such an oddball? &gt;&gt; You remember that story, brother, I'm told, of the little chicken in the barnyard. &gt;&gt; Now, you think about that story. Let's just meditate on that for a moment. That little eagle in the barnyard hatched out from under a chicken &gt;&gt; and and and for for so long, how how long did it go wondering, &gt;&gt; is there something wrong with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that eagle that eagle going around in the barnyard &gt;&gt; and wondering looking at all the other all the chickens pecking around in the dirt looking for worms and things and they said and it maybe try try to fit in. Go peck peck in the dirt and it's like okay I'm trying to make it work but something ain't right. Something ain't right. And and listen, you know that old Balum doctrine says there ain't no difference between a chicken and an eagle. But I'm here to tell you tonight that there is a difference between a chicken and an eagle. Now what reveals the difference is when mama eagle began to scream. Then it looked up and it said, "Now I begin to realize I ain't like this chicken in the barnyard. These chickens in the barnyard going down, pecking, pecking one another, pecking on the shores of one another, trying to beat each other up. But there's that mama eagle's calling me up, calling me higher, calling me to rise. Oh, it tried to it's trying to get up, flop up on the on the fence post, trying to get figure out how to spread them wings because it knew that, oh, church, you are not a chicken, you're an eagle. And when you begin to identify yourself by the word, you realize what you are and who you are. &gt;&gt; There's a lesson to be had here. That chicken in the barnyard, the counterfeit, will always try to make the genuine think that there's something wrong with them. &gt;&gt; But what's wrong? &gt;&gt; The counterfeit will always try to make the real look fake or the fake look real. It'll always try to flip the thing, but the real is identified by the word. &gt;&gt; The real is identified by the life. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, I'll tell you tonight, those those that chle and the eagle, they're both birds. &gt;&gt; They They both got They both got beaks. They both got feathers. &gt;&gt; They both look very similar. &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. Brother Random when he was going to preach the seals, he said he was about to come out and he he was about to say that that that white horse rider was the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; like he had preached before in the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; But then God come on the scene. &gt;&gt; And showed him what it really was. And then he could tell the difference. He could tell the difference between a bluff that got that that bow with no air. He could tell the difference between something something real and genuine that lying anointing. he could tell the difference. And sometimes it takes us a long time for us to be able to tell the difference. But God wants us in this day and hour that we're living in to be able to tell the difference so that you know what you are. You've got to know that you're genuine. You got to know that you ain't a faker. You got to know that you're identified in the word. [screaming] Well, that Balum Balam sitting up there saying, "Well, there ain't no difference between what we're doing over and Boab and there ain't no difference between them down in and Israel." But there was a difference because they had a a water coming from a smitten rock. They were following the pillar of fire. They had the shout of the king in the camp. In other words, they had life. There was life down in there. They had an anointing among them. God was moving in their midst. And there is a difference. Our identity comes, your identity comes from the word &gt;&gt; to be a genuine eagle, &gt;&gt; a genuine dove, &gt;&gt; a genuine lamb. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a difference between a lamb and a goat. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between a vulture and an eagle. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between a dove and a crow. But a crow looks like it's a bird and it's got a beak and it's got feathers and it's got all those things, but it ain't a dove &gt;&gt; and it can't act like a dove. Well, show me, brother Bob, what I need to do to act like a dove. &gt;&gt; Oh, you got to be born. &gt;&gt; You got to have your nature changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, you could be like a crow trying to put them peacock feathers in and trying to Well, well, the the scripture says that I got to have kindness. The scripture says that I got to do all these things. I'm going just I'm going to just put this peacock feather in and then nobody will know. But if it ain't coming from the inside, let this mind that was in Christ be in you. Oh, let God, let the word transform your life, transform your character, transform your nature. And then it doesn't have to be a put on. Oh, then it's not coming from some kind of a flesh workup, but it's coming from the inside, from the with inside. Oh, let the word transform us. &gt;&gt; You know, that's where even complexes come from from mis misplaced identity. &gt;&gt; Something down on the inside is wrong and we'll try to hide it. We'll try to put up that front. We'll take on a false identity to hide our inadequacies. We'll we'll put on that false identity to hide our pride. Well, I got this. I can handle it. I know better. And we'll put that false front up. that because we've got we've got a fa we're trying to adopt a false identity. But an eagle, a real eagle, don't have to put on some kind of a false face because it knows that it's got the strength of the old and the new testament that all it has to do is spread those wings and it's got something genuine to lift it up in the heights of glory, lift it up into the heights of revelation, into the mysteries. It's got something real and something genuine. And you know, even your identity is connected to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You know, like Paul said in Galatians that if you're a servant, you're not you don't have the same relationship that a son does. &gt;&gt; So when a servant messes up, he's not going to get paid. But when a son messes up, he knows that he's still connected to his inheritance by blood, by life because he's born of his father. He's got a relationship. Oh, it all comes back to who is your daddy. &gt;&gt; Like Paul said, we are sons, not servants. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you're a son, if you're a son, you know where you're you get your identity from &gt;&gt; you know, you can even open up these pages of the Bible and take a a DNA test &gt;&gt; to find out who your daddy is. When we open up the pages of this Bible and we we see that we're our nature and our character is identified with these people that we're reading about, &gt;&gt; then we know where we come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our identity is in the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're a son too, any child of God can claim any benefit. God don't play favorites. You you you'll watch sometimes how we raise our children in the natural. Well, people will take a little fa they'll take a son or a daughter and they'll treat them like the favorite and they'll reward them maybe better than all the other ones. But God doesn't do that. If you're a son, if you're a son of God, any child of God can claim able to give it to you tonight. If you need a healed body, if you need your faith restored, if you need more Holy Ghost power in your life, if you're a son of God, you can take that token and hold it over your request and hold hold it over God's promise and believe that God will give it to you. Like Paul said, come boldly to the throne of grace. &gt;&gt; Our identity is in the word. &gt;&gt; Many times the devil can influence how people look at you until you get so down by what somebody else thinks or feels about you. &gt;&gt; And if you listen to that, you can get so discouraged by what somebody else thinks or says about you. But as a believer, you got to know who you are &gt;&gt; until if somebody put tries to put that label on you that's false &gt;&gt; and just let it roll off of you like water off a duck's back. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil identify you tonight. &gt;&gt; We've got to know it's right. We've got to know the message is right. We've got to know we're right. We've got to know who we are until we can say, "I know when I got the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; I know where I was when I got it. &gt;&gt; I know the effect it had on my life. &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, "At that day, you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you." We've got to know. &gt;&gt; And the word identifies itself by its nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By its characteristics. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother said, "We also &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; the Christian church itself, &gt;&gt; which is of no denomination, &gt;&gt; but of a nature." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And now, aren't you glad tonight that there's a nature of Christ that he can manifest in you? &gt;&gt; That's why the Holy Ghost is not a doctrine or a theology, &gt;&gt; but it's the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever of the same nature. And you know, you can go all around the world. You can go down in Nicaragua, over in Africa. You can go to the Middle East, wherever there are Christian, born again believers, and you can find brothers and sisters all around the world with that same nature. And that same nature will make a woman begin to clothe herself. That same nature will make a man begin to act like a real man because it's the same Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Brother said, "When you're a Christian, your nature as a Christian, and you don't have to say you can't smoke, their nature is different. The spirit of Christ is in the person and Christ don't do those things." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why do you want to be a miserable, decrepit, ungodly crowor when you could be a dove?" Certainly, &gt;&gt; you just have to have your nature changed &gt;&gt; and you change your nature. &gt;&gt; Become a son and daughter of God. Be at peace with God. God has to change your nature before you can even seek after him. He said, "Because you're a sinner. You're a pig." Oh, it's God doing. It's God calling us. God drawing us. God drawing us like a magnet to himself. His word wooing over us. His spirit moving and calling and drawing. It's his spirit to move us. That's why it's not just doctrines and theology. It's the person moving and and doing in us &gt;&gt; like a living blazing consuming fire. &gt;&gt; You know, we we go camping sometimes and we'll pile up sticks around the campfire and and and that's you know, that's like the mechanics. You you can pile up sticks on the on the campfire and and and and you've got all the mechanics there. &gt;&gt; Oh, but then you light a match &gt;&gt; and the mechanics become the dynamics &gt;&gt; and it begins to come something that that you can sit around and get warmth by. It takes fire, revelation by the spirit to produce this nature. It takes the living moving spirit of the living God to transform his word into something that's alive to take it off the page and make it living. walking in your walking in your two feet, move using your two hands, using your eyes to fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; To transform it from a mental faith to something real, &gt;&gt; brother say the biggest part of our faith is mental faith. &gt;&gt; By hearing the word, it brings us to a mental recognition of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; But if this coming from above, oh brother, if it ever strikes this, there is a godly spiritual faith, then what does that faith do? That faith recognizes only the word. And when the word itself is pouring into our faith, our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was speaking of in Romans chapter 12 when he said, "Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." And what he's speaking of when he said, "Let this mind that was in Christ be in you." you. So then we can see that the conclusion of the matter is not mental faith. &gt;&gt; The conclusion is a supernatural transformative experience with deity that transforms and changes our our lives. &gt;&gt; You know, if we examine this out, mental faith is limited and frail and weak. &gt;&gt; But a spiritual faith will move mountains. &gt;&gt; No matter what the obstacle is, spiritual faith will move it. And all things are possible to them that have a spiritual revelation, to them that has had their mind changed, to them that has had their soul changed. &gt;&gt; You know, there's times when you you hear things and they are the words of God, but they've been put together intellectually. &gt;&gt; And if you put it together intellectually, it will lead you to an intellectual conclusion. &gt;&gt; And intellectual conclusions introduce human nature. And part of human nature is there's weaknesses which also has fear. &gt;&gt; And the moment we start depending on our own ability. Now you've got the element of fear. &gt;&gt; And the element of fear is the thing needed if somebody's going to control your life. &gt;&gt; And there's that characteristic of nickelatanism that's worked down through the church ages that wants to detail every element of your life so that that spirit's got you doing what they want and how they want and when they won't. But God in this age has not given us the spirit of fear. But he's given us the spirit of power and of love and of sound mind. Revelation by the spirit is what will transform us and take us in the rapture. And Paul said in second Corinthians, "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." &gt;&gt; Liberty. Where God Oh, God comes in with a consuming fire &gt;&gt; and makes it live. &gt;&gt; And fire creates an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. cuz there's a nature at work. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother said, "Look at the character of Christ." &gt;&gt; When he seen that his creation had fallen, now his own loving character molded himself into the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; God's own character of love projected himself in the man Christ. &gt;&gt; His own character molded that kind of a person. Oh, no one could ever do that but God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about God coming down and forming a little putting a little baby in a manger and putting his own life into that child and forming his life and forming him so that he's actually the manifestation of the fullness of godhead bodily. And he said that's what he was. That's who he was and that's why he was to save you. He become you that you might become him. He took your load of sin so that we could take on that same nature and the same the Oh, he said, "You study that character a little bit and then look at yourself and I look at myself." &gt;&gt; Jesus was strange, an oddball &gt;&gt; going around a very odd character. He said, "Another wild man, another holy roller of some religious crank." And he said, "Anybody that's living right is an oddball to this modern world." &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of oddballs that are listed out in scripture. Paul said, "Fools for Christ's sakes, peculiar people, strangers and pilgrims like Abraham, strange and oddballs." Why? Because anybody is odd that tries to live by the word. Anybody is odd that's been born again and separated from this worldly system. It's odd not to listen to worldly music. &gt;&gt; It's odd to want to listen to a sermon on your lunch break. &gt;&gt; It's odd to take your Bible and sit under a tree on your lunch break. And it's odd in this day that we're living in for a sister to want to be a little mama. &gt;&gt; It's odd for a sister to want to raise a family. &gt;&gt; It's odd to raise your children by the Bible instead of psychology. &gt;&gt; It's odd to align yourself with what with what the word says we should be. &gt;&gt; I want my nature and my character to match the word and not the world. &gt;&gt; And brother was saying Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He said, "Oh, if the church only knew its position, &gt;&gt; and he said it will one day." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you know you're an eagle, &gt;&gt; you begin to recognize that falling and making mistakes &gt;&gt; doesn't change what you are. &gt;&gt; If you're an eagle, &gt;&gt; you trip and fall, you're still an eagle. You know, an eagle an eagle could get so low &gt;&gt; until you wonder &gt;&gt; if that eagle could even fly. &gt;&gt; You're you're an eagle when you got when you got crushed around your eyes. &gt;&gt; You're still an eagle when you got that crushed around your eyes. &gt;&gt; You're still an eagle when you feel all alone. &gt;&gt; That don't change your identity. When you're all alone and it seems like you ain't got a friend in the world. You're an eagle and nobody at work wants to associate with you. And maybe nobody at church wants to be your friend. You're still an eagle. That don't change who you are. &gt;&gt; You're an eagle in the middle of a dry spell. [cheering] Oh, you might be going through the worst dry spell you ever gone through, but you're still an eagle. When you fall, you're still an eagle. When you trip, you're still an eagle. When you make a mistake, you're still an angel. Why? Cuz you're still Oh, it's the nature on the inside. And when you rise, you're an eagle. &gt;&gt; What makes you an eagle is you have the nature and character of an eagle. It's the life that makes you what you are. It's the life that makes the difference. I am who I am because of what God made me. Not because of a peacock feather I'm trying to put in. Not by something I'm trying to put on, but by the nature that God has given to us. &gt;&gt; Uh-oh. When we begin to realize who we are, brother said that like that little an ambassador of a nation &gt;&gt; is so confident of who he is &gt;&gt; and who he represents. Then when he goes to another nation, he knows that he's got all the power and authority of that government behind him &gt;&gt; and he comes in maybe sitting to ac across from great dictators and great great men of the world, but it's not his authority that he's depending on. It's the power of the government that he's representing. Oh, and when a Christian comes and recognizes who they are and where they come from, that it's not by their own effort or not by their own will or not by their own power. It's not by power or not by might the word of the Lord to Zerubable was but grace. Grace to the headstone. And if you stay it out, what grace is is when God comes on the scene and does what you cannot. Oh, how could the children of Israel part the Red Sea? How could Abraham give him a baby in his old give himself a baby in his old age? Oh, but God's grace came on the scene and did it through his power. &gt;&gt; And we're not depending on our own self or on our own works or on our own our own abilities, but we're depending on what God did for us. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ram talking about Jesus. She said, "Man can't be that in himself. There's no way to educate it to it. &gt;&gt; There's no way to join it. &gt;&gt; There's no way to baptize it. &gt;&gt; There's no way of doing nothing to it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Only kill it. If we can die to oursel, &gt;&gt; if we can surrender to oursel, if we can lay all those complexes and all those pride, that pride and all all of our self, all of our self-will and say, "Lord, take me as I am." and make me as you are. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let it be born again &gt;&gt; and a new nature come in." &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Heal that nature of yourself that you might become &gt;&gt; and then the word becomes a living thing, it just expresses itself through you. Oh, if we can get in the atmosphere of surrender. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And get in the atmosphere of dying out. Get in the atmosphere to where we realize that we can't do it oursself. Maybe you've got a problem where you just can't stay off of those websites on the internet. Maybe you got a problem where you're sneaking behind the building and you're you're taking a puff of cigarettes or something or you're you're trying to get rid of things and and you come to the end of your rope and you realize you can't do it. Well, maybe it's time to turn it over to God and surrender it and say, "Well, God, I can't do it, but I know somebody that can. I know the one that made the promise like brother said and looking to the unseen God began to speak through he him and he said I'm the one that give the promise I'm the one that raised up Christ from the grave and that same one that raised up Christ from the grave is the same one that can take all of your problems and all of your complexes and all of your addictions and all of your all of your things if we'll just surrender them to him. If we can just die out, &gt;&gt; you know Jesus when he heard Lazarus was dying, he just kept walking. &gt;&gt; He waited &gt;&gt; until he was good and dead &gt;&gt; and then &gt;&gt; he could turn around &gt;&gt; and do something. &gt;&gt; And that's how it is with us sometimes. We got to be good and dead. Climb up on that altar like brother said Abel did and say God I want to die with my sacrifice. I want to be so identified with my sacrifice until you can come and do something with me. &gt;&gt; And then Lazarus come forth out of that grave and he become a living testimony. Everywhere he went was a testimony of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ. Oh, people won't read the Bible. So God has made you a Bible like Lazarus was a living walking testament and they'll make you a living Lazarus. I once was dead but now I live once like Paul said I was doing dead works. I was coming to church and I was paying my tithe and doing things like a servant but then God come and he changed me from a servant to a son and now I'm part of his family. &gt;&gt; Oh think brother said now church think of this just a minute. We are invited to shape our own character &gt;&gt; to his by his grace. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to do anything. &gt;&gt; All we got to do is let him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let this mind &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; be in you which was also in in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when we let his character be in us, then we have become sons by having the mind of Christ. mind which is his character. &gt;&gt; Your mind makes your character. Let that mind of Christ be in you. It molds the character of a son of God. &gt;&gt; What was his mind to do? The mind that was in Christ always to stay with the father's word. Oh, the there's the character of a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word or die. &gt;&gt; I'm going to line up with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it ain't this message. &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it ain't the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm going to line up with this word. If there's something I don't understand, I I'm going to do everything I can to to line up with it until I do understand it. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't throw quotes and scripture in the garbage. But we try to line up with it because that's the nature of a son or daughter of God. always to stay with the father's word. No matter what looked glossy and what looked this way, it didn't make any difference to him. The father's word is what counted. Everywhere when he met the devil, he never even used his power to defeat him. He used the word because that was him. Oh, the word that we hear is changing our mind. The word that we hear is transforming our character. The word is making us to be just like Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And now that same God is manifesting that same life in flesh. He's making us, transforming us until we're the living image of Christ. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece image. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants you to be. Brother Ram said, images of him. &gt;&gt; I believe that God is bringing us beyond identification based just on what somebody's saying you are. You know, somebody could preach a message where they say, "You're an eagle. You're an eagle." And you might be a crow. &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. You're an eagle. And then you go out behind the barn and smoke a cigarette or something. Oh, but when that life begins to identify that this is the eagle life, it's the life, the nature, the character of the manifested word that identifies you. &gt;&gt; And our identification begins to show us why we act the way and why we desire the things that we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Scriptural identification is how we can identify the modern Jacob and Esau. &gt;&gt; Got you. &gt;&gt; How we can identify the modern Cain and Abel. &gt;&gt; That's right. How we can identify the modern Balum and Moses, right? &gt;&gt; How we can identify the modern Jesus, Judas and Christ &gt;&gt; when we know who we were, who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You look in the scripture and John, the messenger of their day, he knew who he was and what his role was. &gt;&gt; He wasn't coming all haphazard. Well, I wonder what I'm supposed to do. [sighs] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is he of whom I said, &gt;&gt; after me cometh a man who is preferred before me, &gt;&gt; right? for he was before me. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I knew him not, but that he should be man made manifest to Israel. Therefore am I come baptizing with water." That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew who he was. And Jesus said to that woman at the well, I am he. I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; And they knew their identity regardless of all the religious people of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And our brother Brandham, our messenger of this day, knew who he was. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm paraphrasing, but there's a place where he said, "I'm the one to identify his presence." &gt;&gt; That's his role to preach a message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That would actually bring forth the the the actual presence of Christ &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh in this day. &gt;&gt; And you are that identified bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; Christ manifest in bride form. &gt;&gt; And if we know who we are, then we become an invincible army. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for, and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible harmony." &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church, &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before. &gt;&gt; Why will Satan be powerless? &gt;&gt; Because we know &gt;&gt; what it is. &gt;&gt; Like we were just talking back there in the office. It's that guy that messes up the the the monitor. That guy when you begin to recognize it's the devil. It's the devil hindering you from coming to church causing all that traffic jam. It's the devil at work. When you begin to recognize who it is that that mind battle, who that has given you them those thoughts that are contrary to the word and you can cast down reasonings, cast down imaginations because you're recognizing what it is. Oh, it's time in this hour not for partial identification but for full. &gt;&gt; It's the age of full identification. &gt;&gt; Can you see now your identification? &gt;&gt; As the musicians come forward, &gt;&gt; we'll close on this. &gt;&gt; Can you see your identification now where you stand? &gt;&gt; Who would we identify with as we look through all these characters in the scripture? Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Would we identify ourselves with the Balum who said there ain't no difference &gt;&gt; or with a Judas, &gt;&gt; the one that can't quite understand the mystery of Jesus, what he's doing, what his purpose is. &gt;&gt; Who would we identify ourselves with? Would we identify oursel in this day with a new haircut? &gt;&gt; Would we identify ourselves with how fancy we can dress? &gt;&gt; Would we identify oursel how popular we can stand and speak? musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll just close on this. &gt;&gt; Do we identify ourselves with how much education we got? &gt;&gt; When Paul said them things, he had to forget them in order to know Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or are we identifying Pentecost? What are we identifying? Paul said in Philippians, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, &gt;&gt; but made himself of no reputation. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the kind of nature that was in Christ, &gt;&gt; and took upon him the form of a servant. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, &gt;&gt; even the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. What God wants us to do, I believe, in this hour is surrender to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be obedient even to death. &gt;&gt; Or we can lay down our lives to him. Surrender and let God take come and take control. Come and take control of our lives. &gt;&gt; I wonder as the musicians just play softly. Maybe we could stand to our feet. If we examine ourselves as we look into the mirror of God's word, what do we identify with? Maybe we look into the mirror of God's word as God is dealing with us in as individuals and recognize that there's things lacking in our life. Maybe we look into the mirror of God's word and see, well, I I didn't think I'd look like that. I I I didn't I thought I I thought I looked different. is the word. The mirror of God's word reveals what's hidden beneath that veil of flesh. We look into the mirror of God's word and we can see how we really are. Well, maybe tonight we look into the mirror of God's word and we see that [music] maybe we thought we weren't maybe we thought we had so many faults and [music] problems, but we look in the mirror of God's word and we see God's nature begin to be reflected back. Maybe we we we can see where [music] we fail and we make so many problems so many times, but we look into the mirror of God's word and we recognize that we're a son and daughter of God. We look into the mirror of God's word and see what we really are. Let's just bow our heads and go to the author. Lord God, you gave us your word so that we could see, so that we could understand. Lord God, I thank you for understanding tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for revelation power, not just to reveal the hidden mysteries and the deep secrets of your word, but to reveal what we are and who we are. And I pray tonight, Lord Jesus, that the words that have been said and the words have been spoken, [music] Lord, have sparked a desire in us, Lord Jesus, to know who we are, to see who we are. The only way we can see is by looking into your word, Lord. Your word speaks back to [music] us. And it always speaks the truth. It always tells the truth. We might come with our own ideas, with our own thoughts, with [music] our own preconceived notions, but we when we look into the word, it it tells the truth. Lord, we want the truth tonight. Lord, I believe that there's still a deep calling to the deep, Lord Jesus. Lord, as your word is dealing with individuals, Lord Jesus, Lord, maybe there's somebody that recognizes that there's something something lacking in their life that they need that maybe that all this time they they've been behaving like a servant and trying to trying to do things so that they could not get fussed on or so that they could get wages so that they could garner somebody's approval. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to be like that. We want it to be an inward work, Lord God, where you change us into sons and daughters of the living God. I pray, Lord, if there is anyone here tonight, Lord Jesus, that wants more of you, Lord, that you'll reach out and touch, deal with their heart, Lord Jesus, and prick them, Lord Jesus, like you pricricked Paul who kicked against the pricks until you ran him down. Lord Jesus, deal with each one, Lord God. I just ask a special blessing upon this church, Lord God. That you'll continue to bless their pastor, Lord Jesus. He's running with the message of Malachi 4. I pray, God, that you'll give him strength and encouragement, Lord God. Be with this church, Lord Jesus, that you'll guide and strengthen and bless them, Lord God. That they'll continue to walk in your power, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just give the remainder of this service to you, Lord Jesus, as we close it. The words have been said, the word songs have been sung, Lord. Now you take it, Lord God, and spin it deep into each heart, Lord God, and convict and deal, Lord God. We just ask your blessing now in your name. Amen. God bless you, saints. Turn it over to the pastor. [applause] [music] [applause] Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you? &gt;&gt; You know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Psalm 82, you are God. &gt;&gt; Is that too strong still? &gt;&gt; We went through this for three months. The Bible say ye are gods. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem, go to Psalm 82. The Bible say ye are gods &gt;&gt; and all of you are children of the most high. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ask my wife when I when we were driving in u church toward the church tonight, she can tell you what I told her exactly the sermon. I didn't talk to brother about what uh what what quote and whatever he's going to read today. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; And you got to stop all the labels that has been put in your life. &gt;&gt; Peel them off. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Peel them off and put them in the trash. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They told you you are scary. You are whatever. You don't know what to do. You are not intelligent. You cannot make it. You are chicken. Whatever they say, &gt;&gt; peel them off. &gt;&gt; They told you you complicated. &gt;&gt; Go ask that person, what is the definition of complication? &gt;&gt; Complication to what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The final, the final, the absolute is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Do you know that David was called by his own brother that he was proud? It's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Just by asking what are they going to do to this guy over there? &gt;&gt; You were there 40 days. &gt;&gt; You were trembling. &gt;&gt; I just came in. I'm asking a question. What are we going to do to the guy that is going to call kill that person over there? Oh, you proud. Now you want to show the naughtiness of your heart. This is what is written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody's coming with a revelation. &gt;&gt; Somebody's coming with a new energy. &gt;&gt; And because you're coming with a new energy, everybody want you to behave like everybody else. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to behave like everybody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it didn't work for the people before, it's going to work for me. Why? Because God dealt with me individually. I know who I am and I know what God told me. Amen. Amen. Amen. We have defined our own Christianity in this message and we label people by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ask somebody what is humility &gt;&gt; in this message they will tell you walking like this. &gt;&gt; They will walk you I mean uh talking to people like this that's the that that comes from a Catholic church. You bu your nature. God built you a certain way. &gt;&gt; Some people are quiet. Some people are outspoken. But we want the one who is quiet and the one who's outspoken, both of them to be under the word. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You say amen. You didn't sin. You quiet. You say amen. You didn't sin. But don't judge the one who's saying amen loud &gt;&gt; that he has a problem. And don't judge the one who's quiet that he got a problem. You be yourself. &gt;&gt; Know who you are. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody I say they say this and this posted something. I say forget about the posting. &gt;&gt; I say block even those people. &gt;&gt; I say you don't have to look at the posting of somebody that don't like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody put on the posting, you are Judas. Are you Judas? &gt;&gt; So, learn how to separate whatever people say with what God told me. God already touched my heart. God gave me a revelation that I am the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say where the carcass is, &gt;&gt; that's where the water. &gt;&gt; So, if I am where the carcass is, what is my nature? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is in me that is attracted to this message? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is it that something about me is pulsating with this message? &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't understand it, but I say this is nothing but the truth. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day I was reading brother Brandham's book and then I stopped. Then I begin to meditate. Then a thoughts came and I and I have a clear thought of it. And I went back and continued to read and everything that came to me is exactly what was after where I stopped. &gt;&gt; How can me and brother match after so many years. &gt;&gt; Now you will tell me I am not a son of God because I was not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, it is the same God &gt;&gt; that was with brother Brham is the same God that is anointing us. &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And stick with what God told you to be &gt;&gt; and move forward regardless of what people will say. &gt;&gt; People will change &gt;&gt; if you stick to your identity. [cheering] I'm not trying to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People will eventually change &gt;&gt; if you stick with your identity. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; One day, poor Paul, &gt;&gt; given the vision by the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; step in the Allen. &gt;&gt; That's right. went and picking up the what do you call I mean stick &gt;&gt; to warm people and to kindle the fire and what happened to Paul &gt;&gt; he got beaten by a serpent &gt;&gt; do you know what people begin to say early on &gt;&gt; they say this was a criminal &gt;&gt; because he he just missed death over there on the boat now he follows him the curse follow him was Paul a criminal &gt;&gt; Paul was actually put there innocent but because something happened to him. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He was interpreted as a criminal. Sister Divine. &gt;&gt; Because something happened. &gt;&gt; Because an accident happened. Who told you you a criminal because an accident happened? &gt;&gt; What? What did Job do? &gt;&gt; What did Job do to receive all the trial that he got? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the believer came and begin to condemn Job that there is no way you can go through such a trial without you being doing something wrong. Did Job do anything wrong? You got to know who you are. [cheering and applause] You got to know who you are. No matter what is happening in your life, remember who you are. [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish with this. Did Jesus sin? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So everything that was happened with for uh with uh Jesus Christ, what wrong have he done? &gt;&gt; So if you judge by the trial, &gt;&gt; what type of trial did Jesus have? &gt;&gt; Did he change him? &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, they coming to arrest him and he keep healing people. &gt;&gt; They cut somebody's ear. He just remember who he was. He pick up the ear and put it back and continue on his road because Calvary was on this path. And even at the cross when he was naked, he turned around and gave somebody life because he knew who he was. And when somebody recognized him, he gave him life. Regardless of where you are now, whether on the mountain or on the valley, remember who you are. God save you this far. You are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. There is a reason why God is on you because you are his bride. And there is a reason why the devil is troubling you all the time because there is something good about you. Because you don't belong to his kingdom. You belong to another kingdom. You have declared war. [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Remember you who who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as I know who I am, &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say about me. &gt;&gt; We trying to control people mouth. &gt;&gt; We trying to control people's social media. Leave them alone. &gt;&gt; Focus on your objective. &gt;&gt; Like the boy with the bike. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes straight. &gt;&gt; If you look around, you're going to fall. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes straight. &gt;&gt; Know who you are. &gt;&gt; I know what I used to be. &gt;&gt; I know what I am now. &gt;&gt; You I don't need you to tell me that God is alive. I know my God is alive. I don't need to tell me what God talk about me when I read the message. I know God is talking to me. I know because he say I will send you &gt;&gt; brother Stephen Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Elijah already came and the word found me. &gt;&gt; So the you that is written on Malachi is me. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I'm talking about me. When they say I will send you, the you is me. &gt;&gt; So I am in Malachi 4 and I am the reflection of Malachi 4. I am the scripture made manifested. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So stay strong in your faith &gt;&gt; and know who you are. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Wonderful. Brother Bob, &gt;&gt; who are you? &gt;&gt; Who are you? [applause] Who are you? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who are you? Even if you still battling complexes and you hiding food, when the angel of the Lord say, "Mighty man of valor," &gt;&gt; from that day, change your mind. &gt;&gt; Say, "I am a mighty man of valor &gt;&gt; and forget everything." &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Good to see you, Sister Jerusha. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I can't miss that when I see my daughter. That's a that's a testimony itself. And I'm going to add another testimony and testimony and testimony and testimony and testimony and testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is alive. &gt;&gt; He's not dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Know who you are. &gt;&gt; Don't judge yourself by the trial. Judge yourself by what God told you and what God is for you. &gt;&gt; Why do you do something wrong and after a while something prick your heart? &gt;&gt; Who prick your heart? Yourself? &gt;&gt; It is not you because you a different nature. &gt;&gt; It is God who's coming back and telling you, "Hey, fix this up. Fix this up. Fix this up." &gt;&gt; Just having a godly sorrow, it's a good sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly this evening.
