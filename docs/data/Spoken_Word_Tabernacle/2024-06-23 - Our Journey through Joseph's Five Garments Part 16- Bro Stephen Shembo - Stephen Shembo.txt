wonderful but I'm going to give you the title in case you've been you've been waiting for the title and before you know it you got dismissed so so get the title our journey through Joseph's five garment part 16 we clear on that one right let's go to Genesis 15 glory to God wow hallelujah hallelujah you know what problem probably it's good to pray right so because you already got the title so let's pray and move on let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for the song of Zion for many wonderful things that you are doing in the midst of this church and your Brad all over the world Lord father we cannot express our gratitude the way we want it to Lord but Lord father you know the desire of our heart we can all say thank you thank you for the breath of life thank you for what you're doing in the life of the young people Lord father the family the churches and everything father we express our gratitude to you thank you Lord we are committing this service unto thy hand Lord may your blood protect us may father you come and speak to us and be the one hearing and interpreting Lord father may you move us completely out of the way may you be the one Lord father ministering to your children be the Alpha and the Omega father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis 50 if you there you can say Amen my translator already in the back okay Genesis 50 verse uh 15 very familiar and when Joseph's Brethren so that their father was dead they say Joseph will perhaps haters everybody's not like you and will certainly repay us all the evil which we did to him that's what they thought so they remember they did Evil at least they they have that conscience because some have a problem they don't even have a conscience they're harming somebody that's a dangerous one amen amen verse 16 and they sent a messenger you might be seated to Joseph saying your father did command before he died they made sure they can get this one and they're using a leverage from their father your father did command before he died saying so shall you say to Joseph amen forgive I pray you now yes sir yes sir whatever they did forgive I pray you now the trespass of your brethren and their sin for they did you evil and now we pray you forgive the trespass of the servant of the god of your father if you were servant of the god of the father why were you doing amen and Joseph wept when they spoke to him it shows that he was an evil spirit that's right and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they say behold we be your servant God is able to do no matter how difficult it seems like this prophecy won't happen it will happen he's able to do what he said he will do amen make sure it's coming from God that's right and if it's coming from God Heaven and Earth will pass away th will never pass away amen verse 19 and just J said to them fear not for am I in the place of God in other word who did all of this it's God right amen and I already understood it's God amen amen verse 20 but as for you you thought evil against me you thought bad you thought we going to sink him down amen by whatever we doing it's going to go down like a Titanic this was not a Titanic neither was it a Titan this one was what a proof amen he said you thought evil against me but God meant it to what so whatever happened there whatever ever you think even whatever I don't care how many devil you got in you God use all those demon for good as bad as those demon are bad God used that amen and his intent was for good their opinion was for evil but God opinion was different than their opinion op and it was God opinion that prevailed so it doesn't matter what people say or wish or want about you it's not going to happen even if they pray bad it won't happen only what God promised to happen will happen amen he say but God meant it to good to bring to pass as it is this day to save many people how what looked bad God was in it and God was the author of it and he turned it to be good we clear so far let's go to Exodus chapter one glory to God Amen you can hear me okay no EO nothing okay cuz the devil usually play around he love to come to church too don't start before I give you a scripture because when the sons of God were gathering in the time of job sir he also showed up in church amen Exodus 1 verse 6 this is where we stopped last week if you there you can say amen amen and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation everybody died amen and the children of Israel were fruitful you know you understand this now amen I hope somebody's still alive and increase abundantly you understand where it's coming from and multiply and works exceedingly Mighty and the land was filled with them in other words the economy of Egypt actually grew stronger right because of the Jews because Egypt was saved by Joseph if he was not for Joseph Egypt would have sink uhhuh amen but Joseph saved Egypt amen and he was God in Joseph uhhuh saving Egypt amen so the presence of the Jews brought prosperity and strength and even the economy amen of the Egyptian so they were not just multiplying but they were making the country stronger that's right you think they will protect protect someone like this because the economy is depending on them normally that's what it's supposed to be amen and the Bible says now there arose a new king because if they ask someone they say how did we get these people here Joseph why do we have so many Jews here you don't know the story no it was Joseph who came here and because of him the whole tribe came back here and then they begin to multiply quickly so why do we have this Joseph you cannot separate the Jewish existence in Egypt with Joseph every time they see a Jews they remember Joseph but for some reason a new king amen amen now there rose up a new king over Egypt which knew not what Jose how can a president be born in this country and does no George Washington are we together how can a president be a president of United States and doesn't know Abraham Lincoln they need to get you off the President office because before you get there you should know most of them especially George Washington you can't miss it and Joseph was the highest of all of themen because of what he did how come in the midst of something like this somebody Rose and you ask him a question do you know Joseph he says no have you heard about Joseph I don't know how did you become a pharaoh stepen in the book of fact says this he says in Act 7 but when the time of the promise Drew now so the problem is not Pharaoh it is the promise that was given to amen amen so Pharaoh really doesn't even understand what happened to him it looked like something went into his memory and deleted Joseph and it was God that did that because the Bible say but when the time of the promise Drew n which God has sown to who Abraham the people did what grew and did what multiplied in Egypt till another king arose which knew not what Joseph how come this King doesn't know Joseph amen amen because the time of the promise amen is coming closer amen when the time of something come on is about to happen God will push every button Amen on God will begin to react in an unusual way amen because his word must come to pass God is able to do what he says that he will do it doesn't matter how difficult it is because when the Jews were talking together they said do you know God gave us a promise they say yes what was the promise they say that we will sourn in this country for 400 years oh okay and then we will be slave they say h Slave how how are we going to be slave with all the privilege of Joseph like this you turning her to be slave ah come on we got a monument there over there for Joseph if you look at the Constitution you see the name of Joseph how come but because God say so amen God will change even the laws that's to fulfill his word amen amen listen to what brother Branham say glory to God brother Branham says that but when God's prophetic time came to pass after he promised Abraham that his seed would sourn in a Strange Land for 400 years and he will bring them up by what a strong hand then when the hour of the time of the promise did what Drew n There Rose up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph no impossible it seems that it would not be when the time of the promise joai uhhuh God will make things do what keep up to fit his prophetic promise do you believe that he always does he's always how that way how in the country where the Constitution is supporting Israel you going to have so many anti-Semitism all over Camp is like this because God's time for the promise has come amen no matter how much it seems like it's impossible even if this country is a Christian country something will happen you don't understand you cannot even explain how come it is God in that amen Amen brother Bram say who would have thought that those people had they were how respected and almost what worship because of who Joseph that the Young Prince that was done there Tau the dream and save Egypt many time in a space short space like how many 400 years they ever what forget him but when God promised June n amen There Rose up a what a pharaoh who knew not what Joseph and he caused T mask to be put upon the Water the people why why is a sudden trial come on that doesn't have any logical explanation happening to me out of nothing I didn't do anything it's a good sign because something is getting [Applause] closer I was sitting at home where is this thing coming from what I mean which door in Hell brought thing to me I'm completely innocent it is God glory to God brother brandham say oh everyone that is ever what experience the what the birth of an eagle yourself being one of what Joseph's eaglet you know what I'm talking about about what trials and Temptation almighty God taken his own son into what the Wilderness and did what and turned the devil loose on him sure and every son that cometh to God is how is tribe and what Chast of God trials and what and tribulations get what bankrupt everything goes how wrong you do what lose your business your friend do what walk away from you stick a here and stick a what there just remember God is doing what testing you God is going to do what something for you I remember my own father told me pack your cloth and get out of here with that kind of religion I did but I never what been sorry you will never be sorry of what [Applause] happened at the end of the trial you won't be sorry matter of fact you will praise God Amen because that trial made you stronger amen he opened the door for God to move in your life amen because everything work together for good are we together are we together look at how strange this is my friend the psalm 1045 the Bible say Israel also came where into Egypt and Jacob sour in the land of who of ham and he increased his people how greatly who increased the people Joseph God right increased his people how greatly and made them what stronger than their enemy he turned their heart to do what to hate his people so who made the Egyptian to hate the Jews God and he dealt how Sly with who his servant so who was the author of the trouble God if God is the one turning the fire on God knows how to control the fire and to put out that fire amen and as a matter of fact when he turn the oven he knows how to calibrate that oven so he won't burn you amen so the fire will on you cook you well amen but he won't burn you amen I we together amen do you know the four Hebrews when they got into the fire sir what did the fire do it just removed the band so when you they put you on the fire it's going to lose some devils out because your fire will bring you in prayer uhhuh and when you bring you in prayer demon begin to flee away amen because somebody begin to get closer to [Applause] God amen amen amen amen amen Jesus let's go back to our scripture where am I at my friend I'm going to try amen amen amen a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph how come this Pharaoh doesn't know Joseph amen amen jealousy sprung out of nothing amen we didn't do anything we're not even criminals for some reason boom we're in trouble why God is in control who hardened the heart of pharaoh God for his own purpose to show his power yes and he was showing his power in advantage of the Jews so the more God shows the power the more they respect you and the more they fear you praise be to the name of the Lord let jum to verse n and he says to his people behold you there amen remember Israel is changing garment you remember that we got a coat of many color amen amen we got a coat of many color we got a coat of a servant and a slave amen we got a coat of a prisoner amen then we appear before Pharaoh oh God before pharaoh and then we got fine Ling amen where the marriage of the Lamb is amen amen if you dare you can say Amen the coat of many color Israel was sitting in go everything going fine the brother love you Daddy love you give you the coat of many color everything good and suddenly Israel is changing coat from a coat of many color they dropping down to the second coat of a servant because they need to move all the way till they get to the promised land am am amen amen now verse n and he said to his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more M are more and MDI than we that's what the Bible says in Psalm 105 they were stronger than their enemies amen amen come on let us deal how wisely with that wisdom is not the wisdom of God no sir it's coming from the devil amen there is two wisdom we went through that let de wisely with them lest them multiply and it come to pass that when they fall out any war in other word any War occur they join also to our enemy and fight against us and so get them out of the what the land so Pharaoh doesn't even want them to leave the land right right because the economy depend on them so make up your mind somehow the problem is I'm I can't stand that Prosperity the way they are moving up I can't stand we need to control them but don't get them out if you get them out the economy is down amen amen the devil amen verse 11 therefore they did say over them what task Masters to do what afflict them with their burdens and they built for Pharaoh Treasures cities paon and rames but the more they afflict them amen amen they thought the Affliction will bring them down that's what the devil thought about you he said put fire on them they will quit that religion sir they will stay away from church amen verse 12 but the more they afflict them the more they did what multiply and what and grew amen so they are growing in the midst of trial so the trial here is actually developing a another character to Israel amen amen amen are we together amen now Israel knows how to live in abundance and he knows how to live when he lack are we together amen are we together amen so whenever you put Tri Israel just I mean maneuver around the trial in other word accommodate themselves with the a challenge in other word devil I'm not going to sink sir in other words you are built with a system amen that operate under trial when there is no Tri you move on the regular whenever they push trial on you there is an another meion that will kick in automatically am and begin to handle the devil amen that's why you won't fail no sir that's why this bride won't fail amen that's why you got the devil answer that's why you are more dangerous to the devil than anybody are there amen that's why the devil doesn't attack the denomination he's after you because you can defeat him anytime uhhuh anywhere under any circumstance whether the circumstan is are good or bad you know how to handle it [Music] amen come on G are we together amen every young lady here has a potential to be a mother every young lady here have a potential to be a mother but when they growing up if Mama say get your little brother sometime it's like ah I got a stuff to do ah I don't want it no problem but let them get married and let him have their own childh Mama doesn't teach them how to handle that baby sir automatically motherhood comes out amen and take care of that baby whether the mom is around or not that baby is protected because it's built in them amen that's why you have that system built in you you don't know until trial comes when trial comes watch your behavior you will turn around you say is this really me yes it's you it is just an automatic defense system amen are we together amen are we together amen the more they put the Affliction the more they multiply normally if they put the Affliction you going down it doesn't work like that in other word trial develop something in you that you never knew about yourself [Laughter] glory to God if when you go to trial when everything goes good you usually behave normal amen and you think things are harder sometime when they put you in trial amen then something else open up in other you open up amen am if another you can grow in trial what about if you remove trial because that ability works with trial now when the trial ises off guess what the devil already released something that he was not supposed to release now you a Superman you are now a Super Woman now when other Tri comes you begin to laugh you look you say don't worry I already passed through this the god that deliver me from the lion from the bear who is this un circum philistin so your trial built you back [Applause] up amen am do you understand yourself now you are more than what you think about yourself oh God where are we at my friend where are we at my friend verse verse verse 12 and but the more they did what the more they Afflicted them the more they did what multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of what Israel in other words the devil look and say we don't know what to do with them anymore we hardened their life we made everything light and strong they still married when the devil say this time I got the marriage down still married what is really holding that she's still strong he's still strong he's still smiling on Lord amen amen amen amen and the Egyptian made the children of Israel to serve with what rigor rashness and they made their life how bitter with hard what bondage in what in Mortar in what and in Brick and in all manner of what service in the field all their services wherein they made to serve was with what riger and the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrews Midwife it's not working it's not working we put everything on them these people don't want to let it go am amen amen you know what let me infiltrate their Camp let's go to The Midwives let's go to the source because we can't stop them from getting married amen amen but we can kill the carrier of the seed there it is right there there it is right there let's go my friend verse uh 15 and then and the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew what midwives you know what a mid wife is a nurse that help to deliver the baby amen and of which the name of the one was who shifra welcome sister shifra finally we saw you in the word amen amen who was shifra and the name of the other who was what PU and he said when you do the office so it's an office it's a work amen me wife work office when you're doing your job when you're doing your work amen amen remember Rebecca right when you're doing your work my the Midwife office uh office when you're doing the Midwife office to the Hebrew women and see that upon the sto amen if he be a son then you shall do what kill him but if he be a daughter then she shall what live why did he Target the sons do you see why the message is perfectly in line with the Bible amen because the boys are the carrier of the seed amen amen that's why I am so hard on boys am because when the devil want to destroy a church he will attack the younger boys because they're the one that can preach the gospel they're the one that can carry the seed amen they're the one that can carry the spoken word women cannot preach on the PO boys can are we there amen get the boys kill them amen amen in other words after a while we would see so many young sisters and no husband amen what happened to the husband in the world killed killed killed killed killed but thank God we got some Churches of shifra and pu that won't kill the young men we will preserve them because one is a patriarch amen amen amen but the Midwife did what verse 17 they fear God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but did what the men children alive so something is not changing these people in hardship they know how to live when everything is good they know how to live this is why Paul says this he says not that I speak in respect of one for I have what learned in whatever state I am there with to be how content I know both how to be how a Bas and I know how to do be abound everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be how full and to be what hungry both to abound and to what to need and to suffer need I can do all things to who Christ which does what strengthens me Hallelujah in good days or bad days everything is good amen amen amen watch now verse uh 18 and the king of Egypt called for the Midwife and said to them why you have done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the Midwife say to Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women amen for they are how Lively H somebody is strong and are delivered before the Midwife gets to what unto them so there is no way to kill the baby amen amen therefore watch now God deal well with the Midwife and the people did what multiply and works how very Mighty you ready and he came to pass because the Midwife fear God Amen in their job in their offices Amen in their work amen when they took their work and put the fear of God uh-huh in their work something happened to them at the beginning they were working as a routine but now they are working under the fear of God Amen when they work under the fear of God what happen you there amen and it came to pass because the Midwife fear God that he made them what houses do you know what he means do you know what he means do you know what it means these Midwife were Barren they didn't have babies amen amen they were delivering baby but they themselves baren so normally a woman that doesn't have a baby doesn't even understand compassion that's right I have a quote and Pharaoh put the instruction on them but we less of their state amen their purpose to fear God and God now open their womb and give them families when you take your job and you CLE f with the Lord amen in your job that's when the blessing come amen the very now it was not them delivering the baby it was somebody delivering their own babies amen and now they have houses the the the the correct translation means they had families because those women both of them were Barren amen the Lord amen amen the job was no longer a routine job now it is a job Couer with the fear of the Lord am when you bring the fear of the Lord into what you're doing the blessing of the Lord will kicking amen hallelujah are we together amen are we together Amen in other words you do your job as you doing it unto the Lord amen that's when God blesses you amen amen am are we clear amen are we clear amen praise be to the name of the Lord you did good so now Israel is moving from being in Goan into slavery amen From Slavery what follow you got to be prisoner brother Bram says this glory to God brother Bram say Moses represented the law of God and by the law no man is what saved no flesh can be saved by doing what keeping the law the law was only a what a school Master the law didn't have any what remedy the law was the what the prison house can you say Amen can you say Amen so Israel moved from Goen into being a slave and when Moses delivered them they enter into the prison estate because they pick up the law of Moses and the law put them in prison they were going through the five garment until the promised land are we together I'm showing you this garment all over the scripture my friend are we together amen you would never known sin if he had not been by what the law the law only did what pointed it out the law was God's policemen that put you where in

well pleased for they were overr where in the wilderness now these things were what our example for our example to the intent that we should not last after what evil things as they also did what so we found a people that follow a messenger a messenger with three sons even with the third pool amen they drunk the spiritual drink they ate the spiritual food and despite all of that being partaken of the message of the hour God was not pleased with them are we together and brother uh Paul is saying here that this is what this was for our example and Paul say neither be ye how I this is where BR Bram took took I mean took the scripture neither be ye what idolator as were some of them not everybody amen as it is written the people did what sat down to do what eat and drink and they rose up to

Chicago at work we got R Rachel at work the Seven Daughters of Jetro work now we are roof how did she get married watching the aad amen I won't dig roof in detail because we went through this I'm going to stay on the surface so we can try to move you there verse three and ELC Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two what sons and they took them what wives of the women of what Moab the name of one was who Ora and the name of the other roof and they dwelt there about how 10 years go ahead on verse five my friend and on and Kon died also both of them uhhuh and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband uhhuh continue my friend then she arose with her daughters-in-law okay that she might return from the country of Moab uhhuh for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had had visited his people in giving them bread stop let's go back to verse six then she Naomi arose with her what daughters in-law was there two of one so up to this point we don't know who orai is are we together we got Ora and we got roof amen amen both of them got married for some reason no children amen amen amen amen and to remind you something let me put this so it goes together drop to verse uh 20 20 the Bible say and she said to them call me not who naom call me who Mar for the almighty has dealt very bitterly with me I went out how full let's go back again so Naomi went full rof and opa were married in a good family full Prosper amen amen but when they went back poor amen so rof enter into this marriage and Ora enter into this family everything was good and suddenly both husband died and we remember brother Bram telling us that sometime God let the very props you remember this be not from us sometime he let what sickness strike us he let what disappointments and what heartache strike us sometime he does that to get you where you can be what influenced by the gospel be wise enough to do what to catch it don't be what stupid enough to walk away from it the one who walk away is how stupid I'm I'm reading the prophet the one who walk away is what stupid between all and roof who walk away because God let tragedy come for both of them giving both of them the opportunity to move where they can be influenced by the gospel amen are we together I'm staying on the surface so we can blend the two together you can see the five phases of Joseph in the life of rof am are we together am are we together are we together so at this point we don't know who is bad you know it because you know the end of the story yes sir but let's go back again like you don't know the end of the story both of them look good amen so when they heard follow me carefully I don't want to lose you when they heard that there was bread right my friend go ahead and read that passage again um from verse I believe 8 or9 and no verse six let's go then she Naomi with her who her daughters-in-law both of them that she what return from the country of Moab so they all arose to return to the country of what Moab for she have heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord has what visited his people in giving them what bread that bread was that spiritual bread no sir no it was what physical bread so there was a the Lord sent a blessing yes into Israel a Revival brother I'm saying of bread was going on in Israel and that Revival was producing more bread amen amen amen and when all of them heard that are you following me amen all of them responded the same way are we together amen so the first news of Revival amen amen of natural bread amen amen to take care of the body yes amen came up all three rose up if you ask Ora where are you going to Israel why there is a Revival over there so the Revival doesn't distinguish who is right and who is wrong the fival of natural benefits that's right never will give you the the difference between the right seed and the wrong seed the wrong seed also love benefits am that's right that's right amen are we together amen that's why Jesus said the re fall on the just and the unjust and brother Bram say when the rain fall the tears praise the Lord and the we also praise the Lord amen so by the operation of the rain you don't really know who is who unless you look at the fruit but if you listen to them this one is saying praise the Lord this one is saying praise the Lord open saying praise the Lord we going where there is bread rof say praise the lord we going where there is bread so the first pull are we together the first pool of the land of Judah amen will attract everybody amen you cannot tell the difference by the first pool because it's something that is connected to the body amen are we together am please put your seat belt as are moving amen amen are we together amen are we together amen Have I Lost somebody no sir praise God we there amen we there let's go to verse seven wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her who is good who's bad if you look you see three people traveling how can you tell Ora is bad she also left she also packed she also she's also following Naomi she's not bad she's good amen amen you can you can detect Ora under the first that's right pole you won't get her amen amen let's move on amen amen and she went with her daughter-in-law with her and they went on the way so they even stand on the way so they left home and they went they went they went and they reached the road the way they know that this way destination the promised land Bethlehem when they Stu there so Ora also reached that point amen amen when they stay on the way they wait to return to the land of what of Judah so so far ARA still can make it are we togethera can move on all the way there am no problem with that amen Naomi when they stuck there Naomi pushed the break and say wait a minute so everybody's with me they say yes are we together yes yes yes dear we are with you now say we need the pool again and Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law go return to her mother's house the Lord dealt kindly with you as you both of them have dealt with who the dead so both women were not bad women I'm reading the Bible so ala
