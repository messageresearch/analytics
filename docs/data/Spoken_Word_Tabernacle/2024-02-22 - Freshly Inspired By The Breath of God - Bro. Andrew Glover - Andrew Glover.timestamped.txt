[45:08] Christ's name we pray and all the
[45:10] Believers says amen and amen St John
[45:15] chapter 20 and verse 18 the Bible says
[45:18] Mary Magdalene came and told the
[45:21] disciples that she had seen the Lord and
[45:24] that he had spoken these things un to
[45:27] her then the same day at evening being
[45:30] the first day of the week when the doors
[45:31] were shut where the disciples were
[45:34] assembled for Fears of the Jews came
[45:36] Jesus and stood in the midst amen now I
[45:40] love that came Jesus and stood in the
[45:43] midst yes sir we said like this came the
[45:45] word and stood in the midst and saith
[45:49] unto them peace be unto you that's right
[45:52] and when he had said and he when he had
[45:54] so said he showed un them his hands in
[45:57] his side and then were the disciples
[46:00] glad when they saw the Lord yes sir then
[46:02] said Jesus to them again peace be unto
[46:05] you as my father hath sent me even so
[46:10] send I you amen and when he had said
[46:13] this he breathed on them and said unto
[46:17] them receive ye the Holy Ghost In other
[46:20] words he breathes on them and says
[46:23] receive ye the Holy Ghost now watch
[46:26] right after after he breathes on them
[46:28] and they receive the Holy Ghost he says
[46:30] now whosoever sins you remit they are
[46:33] remitted unto them and whosoever sends
[46:35] you retain they are retained so when he
[46:38] breathed upon them he breathed Authority
[46:41] into them we ask the Lord this evening
[46:44] to add the blessing to the reading of
[46:45] his word as you can have your seats here
[46:47] this afternoon amen I want tonight if I
[46:50] could to share with you a few things
[46:52] here and if I title this tonight I want
[46:54] to speak to you on freshly inspired by
[46:57] the Breath of God freshly inspired by
[47:00] the Breath of God you know I believe if
[47:02] there ever was a time that we could use
[47:04] a refreshing amen I believe we could use
[47:07] it right now amen I believe we could use
[47:09] a refreshing in our homes we could use a
[47:12] refreshing in our churches we could use
[47:13] a refreshing in our families amen I
[47:16] believe if we ever could use a
[47:18] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[47:20] we could use it right now now when you
[47:22] think of this word fresh the definition
[47:25] of fresh it is having its original
[47:27] qualities unimpaired amen it is full of
[47:31] or renewed in Vigor it is not stale not
[47:34] sour or decayed it is not faded nor
[47:38] altered by processing so when something
[47:40] is fresh it is still carrying the same
[47:44] qualities that it had in the beginning
[47:46] no matter how long it has been in
[47:48] existence so amen like you go to the
[47:51] store and you you purchase some meat
[47:53] amen when you go buy that meat you're
[47:55] not looking to buy something that's
[47:57] processed and then because when it's
[47:59] processed you know it loses qualities it
[48:01] loses uh certain things that it had in
[48:03] the beginning now here the prophet of
[48:05] God speaking to us in 1956 in a message
[48:08] hear ye him from Matthew 17 when he's
[48:11] speaking on Jesus on the mount
[48:12] Transfiguration I normally don't read
[48:14] this much to lay a foundation but I want
[48:16] to tonight if that's okay he said now
[48:18] you know God's word is so Eternal it's
[48:21] just inspired it's not just for one
[48:23] occasion or for one generation he said
[48:26] the word of God is so Eternal it's the
[48:28] same and it's the truth amen the word of
[48:31] God is eternal the word of God is the
[48:33] same and the word of God is the truth he
[48:36] said this same word inspired the
[48:38] disciples it inspired the first world of
[48:41] disciples and then the next is they
[48:42] follow down to the Lutheran age through
[48:45] the Methodist age and every age and is
[48:47] just as sufficient and inspiring today
[48:50] to us amen as it was the first day that
[48:53] it was given he said now watch if the
[48:55] world should stand a million years the
[48:58] word would still be just as inspired to
[49:01] the generations that will follow as it
[49:03] is to us because it's perfect amen and
[49:06] it's always given for the time amen so
[49:09] let me let me break in and say this we
[49:11] are not feeding tonight amen on
[49:14] processed word we are we are not feeding
[49:16] on the hybrid word amen but we are
[49:18] feeding on word that is still packing
[49:21] its original qualities but it was
[49:23] packing in the beginning amen so in
[49:25] other words the same thing that was in
[49:27] the word in the beginning in the alpha
[49:30] amen will be in the word in the Omega in
[49:33] the ending now one great way we could
[49:34] approach it he says is this afternoon
[49:36] that's the coming of the Lord he said
[49:38] see first Moses then Elijah then Jesus
[49:41] he said then we noticed that Peter while
[49:43] he was there amen he had just been
[49:46] freshly inspired amen because he had
[49:48] just give a witness to who Jesus was
[49:51] amen and he was inspired now think about
[49:54] this amen you have the old test
[49:57] amen and you have Jesus and you have
[49:59] Peter of the New Testament amen and
[50:01] they're all on the same Mountain amen
[50:03] but there's not one less bit of
[50:05] inspiration amen that Peter isn't
[50:07] enjoying as Moses or Elijah enjoyed in
[50:10] the Old Testament amen because it was
[50:12] all the word he said now when a man is
[50:15] inspired and he reads the inspired word
[50:17] then the two Inspirations gives a result
[50:20] no matter how well you study the word
[50:23] it'll never do you no good amen until
[50:26] you are in insired yourself it takes
[50:28] your inspiration the word is already
[50:31] inspired so what we need today is an
[50:34] inspiration over us God sweeping down
[50:37] with a new inspiration and breathing
[50:40] over us his power and his love and
[50:42] himself that it might Inspire us to
[50:45] Quicken us and to awaken us to his word
[50:48] he said then when the word being brought
[50:50] in the spirit of inspiration amen then
[50:53] you'll see miracles happen and things
[50:55] take place because the two is just
[50:57] coming together can I can I give you one
[50:59] more he said the word of God Amen it is
[51:02] not like the word of a man he said a
[51:05] word of a man has a certain meaning for
[51:07] the expression Amen in the time it was
[51:10] given but God's word amen has an eternal
[51:13] meaning amen down Through the Ages as it
[51:16] flows on Amen y'all know another way
[51:19] they talk about oxygen don't you amen is
[51:21] flow so amen as the word is Flowing as
[51:24] the word is breathing amen as the word
[51:26] is moving it is not losing its power it
[51:29] is not losing its inspiration it is not
[51:32] losing its ability as a matter of fact
[51:35] amen the word is in this building
[51:37] tonight amen in the same quality that it
[51:40] was amen when Jesus stood in John 20
[51:43] amen and rebuke the fear and released
[51:45] unto them amen a peace and an authority
[51:48] now brother said it very beautiful he
[51:50] said every generation can pick up the
[51:52] same word amen because it is an inspired
[51:55] it is an eternal and everlasting amen
[51:58] nonfading declaration from God Amen the
[52:02] word of God is an eternal inspired
[52:04] Everlasting non-fading declaration from
[52:07] God no matter if the apostles read it in
[52:09] their age it meant something to them if
[52:11] Wesley read it in his age amen it meant
[52:14] something to him and Calvin but yet
[52:16] today somebody say today amen it's just
[52:19] as brilliant and bright and got just as
[52:21] much of an effect amen as it did on them
[52:24] in the very day it was spoken amen
[52:27] because it is God's word amen can I say
[52:30] this the spoken word amen shall never
[52:33] lose its inspiration the spoken word
[52:35] shall never lose its ability the spoken
[52:38] word shall never lose its power the
[52:40] spoken word shall never lose its
[52:42] anointing amen and I come here tonight
[52:44] to declare unto you amen that the spoken
[52:47] word is the same yesterday amen today
[52:50] and forever and he still got his
[52:53] original qualities amen if he was a
[52:55] savior in the beginning he's a savior
[52:58] here tonight if he was a Healer in the
[53:00] beginning He Is A Healer here tonight if
[53:03] he was a miracle worker in the beginning
[53:05] he is a miracle worker here in the
[53:07] ending amen because we might be in a
[53:09] different day and we might be in a
[53:11] different month on the calendar amen but
[53:13] God is still the same amen and if we'll
[53:16] just open up the doors and let the flow
[53:18] of the Holy Ghost amen come back in the
[53:21] church he will rebuke the fear he will
[53:23] rebuke the sin he will rebuke the
[53:26] iniquity
[53:27] he will rebuke the confusion listen I
[53:29] think if there's ever been a time Amen
[53:31] to lay aside the confusion and come back
[53:34] to Vindicated word amen now is the time
[53:37] now is the hour amen the word of God is
[53:40] inspired now you see the word of a man
[53:43] has a certain meaning for a certain time
[53:45] but the word of God has an eternal
[53:48] meaning amen for whatever generation
[53:50] it's spoken for look at the words of a
[53:52] man you could say John come over to my
[53:55] house I'll be glad to see you that's our
[53:57] words and all it
[53:59] means that's right all it means is John
[54:03] amen come over to our house but when God
[54:05] speaks amen it's a difference when a man
[54:08] speaks and when God speaks he said it's
[54:11] Eternal it is breathed from his very
[54:14] breath of the immortal Everlasting
[54:16] Creator himself so therefore there's no
[54:19] way to ever find the full meaning of an
[54:22] expression of God it's for every age and
[54:24] every generation amen when a man speaks
[54:27] he says John come to the house amen and
[54:30] John comes to the house amen now listen
[54:32] things can happen under the words of a
[54:35] man amen to stop John from getting to
[54:37] your house amen but if God speaks amen
[54:41] it's the breath of a Creator and if he
[54:43] says I'm coming to your house gyrus amen
[54:46] it don't matter if your baby does die
[54:49] amen he is the way he is the truth and
[54:52] he is the resurrection and because he
[54:54] said I am coming to your house he will
[54:57] make a way Amen to come to your house
[55:00] and if God said he will Rapture you if
[55:02] God said he will deliver you if God said
[55:04] he will change your body amen some
[55:07] morning between 6:00 and 9 it don't
[55:09] matter what happens amen it didn't come
[55:11] from the breath of a human man it has
[55:14] come from the breath of the immortal God
[55:17] and he will come on the scene in the
[55:19] power of His creation and where there is
[55:21] no way he will be the way where there is
[55:24] no Red Sea he will make the Red Sea
[55:27] where there is no tomorrow he will be
[55:29] the tomorrow where there is no future he
[55:32] will be the future because he is not
[55:34] speaking words of a
[55:37] man it's the word of God and it's a
[55:40] powerful word amen I love job 32:8 I
[55:44] love the Bible where job 32:8 he says
[55:47] there is a spirit in man and he says and
[55:50] the inspiration amen of the almighty
[55:53] amen giveth him understanding you know
[55:56] what that word inspiration means it
[55:58] means breath that's right the Breath of
[56:01] God Amen is the inspiration of the
[56:04] almighty so when God breathes it's not
[56:08] stale when God breathes it's not decayed
[56:11] when God breathes amen it's not foul
[56:14] poisonous breath amen but when God
[56:17] breathes it is full of strength when God
[56:20] breathes it is full of vigor when God
[56:22] breathes it brings a renewing when God
[56:25] breathes things begin to change amen
[56:28] because the breath of the almighty is
[56:30] the inspiration of the Almighty I love
[56:33] what the prophet said he said oh God who
[56:35] formed the heavens and the Earth and
[56:38] just let his breath go forth with his
[56:40] word amen you cannot separate amen the
[56:44] Breath of God from the word of God and
[56:47] everything Tak in its right position so
[56:49] in other words when God begin to breathe
[56:52] he begin to speak and as he begin to
[56:54] speak amen than begin to take their
[56:57] position amen by the breath of the
[56:59] spoken word he said the Earth and the

[57:40] the firmament amen how did all these
[57:42] things happen amen there was a breath
[57:45] and it was an immortal breath and it was
[57:47] the breath of a Creator and the prophet
[57:49] said father I thank how that you've ever
[57:51] stooped down are y'all hearing me amen

[58:33] God spoke and the mountains took their
[58:36] place well Church of the Living God if
[58:38] he can move the creation if he can move
[58:40] the solar system I believe he's the same
[58:43] God that can come and spoken word
[58:45] Tabernacle on a Wednesday night and he
[58:47] can open his word and he can place his
[58:50] voice in the mouth of the the five-fold
[58:52] ministry and they can begin to speak
[58:55] that word listen I'll tell you why the
[58:56] devil don't want you to hear this word
[58:58] is because it's more than the breath of
[59:00] Andrew Glover it's more than the breath
[59:02] of Steven it's more than the breath of
[59:04] brother Kelly it's more than the breath
[59:06] of any preacher it is the positionally

[59:55] when God begins to breathe things begin
[59:57] to take their position when God begins
[1:00:00] to breathe listen the prophet of God
[1:00:02] said Every Breath You Ever breathed it
[1:00:04] come from God the Every Breath You ever
[1:00:07] breathe it come from God sir now can I
[1:00:10] show you something in the Bible in
[1:00:11] Genesis 2 is where we find the first
[1:00:14] word amen mentioned about breath in
[1:00:17] Genesis 2:7 the Bible says that the Lord
[1:00:20] God Amen formed man of the Dust of the
[1:00:23] ground and breathed
[1:00:26] into his nostrils the breath of life
[1:00:28] amen and Man became a living Soul the
[1:00:32] prophet of God said I can see Adam
[1:00:34] standing he said seem him standing like
[1:00:36] a tree God had made him he was dead as
[1:00:38] he could be his toes amen like the root
[1:00:42] sticking in the ground and God said let
[1:00:44] there be that's right come on Church
[1:00:47] Genesis 1 God says Let There Be and
[1:00:50] there's a moon Let There Be and there's
[1:00:52] Stars Let There Be and there's a
[1:00:53] firmance Let There Be and the day is
[1:00:56] divided from the nights but in Genesis 2
[1:00:59] he says Let There Be and the prophet
[1:01:01] said or breathe the breath amen of life
[1:01:03] into him and he jumped and he came to
[1:01:06] himself see he breathed the breath of
[1:01:09] life into him and he became a living
[1:01:12] soul and he be to move oh I'm getting
[1:01:15] ahead of myself amen but you know in the
[1:01:17] Book of Luke amen there was a parable of
[1:01:19] a coin right there was a parable of a
[1:01:23] sheep and then there was a parable of a
[1:01:25] prodical son
[1:01:26] that prodal son was born in his father's
[1:01:29] house he had inheritance in his father's
[1:01:31] house amen but sin took him away from
[1:01:34] the father's house he was out of his
[1:01:36] position amen but God be to breathe come
[1:01:40] on church and the same God that breathed
[1:01:43] in Genesis into Adam and he came to
[1:01:45] himself was the same God go read Luke 15

[1:01:51] prodical son came to himself can I ask
[1:01:55] you something what brought him to
[1:01:56] himself amen the same breath that
[1:01:59] brought Adam to himself in the creation

[1:02:05] to the hog pin and brought that boy to
[1:02:07] himself well I might as well say it
[1:02:09] that's the same breath that is breathed

[1:05:53] the Lord he that created the heavens and
[1:05:56] stretch them out he that spread forth
[1:05:58] the Earth and that which come out of it

[1:06:08] breathed and come out oh God and there
[1:06:12] was creation that come out of his
[1:06:15] Creation in other words the Creator had

[1:09:40] said God blowed his breath in the palm

[1:09:45] breath he said every Star come into
[1:09:48] existence he took a handful of dust and

[1:10:10] they are the sons of God that's come on
[1:10:13] church he come on Hallelujah I feel like
[1:10:16] preaching here for a minute he knew in
[1:10:18] the end time that Lucifer would come
[1:10:21] into manifestation and he would try to
[1:10:23] Rob amen the son of God of their
[1:10:26] position but God was so confident in the
[1:10:29] breath that he breathed that when that
[1:10:31] breath come across your life it would
[1:10:34] clearly reveal to you your position and

[1:11:17] this body amen does not receive the
[1:11:19] oxygen or the breath now watch what
[1:11:22] breath is it is the intake and the out
[1:11:25] take of our lungs then we're dead now
[1:11:28] can I say this intake can be called
[1:11:31] inhale and outtake can be called exhale

[1:11:41] inhaling and there's no exhaling then
[1:11:44] there's no life if there's no intake and

[1:17:49] bride that's right remember brother B
[1:17:52] said we was out there in Tucson and he
[1:17:54] said we went out to a Baptist Church
[1:17:56] just to get some word he said anything
[1:17:58] we could get right C he said we went out
[1:18:00] there he said just to kind of get a
[1:18:01] little fresh feeling you know he said we
[1:18:03] need a little fresh something he said
[1:18:05] and I went in there and we sat down and
[1:18:06] he said the preacher got up and he said
[1:18:08] there was a lot of things we couldn't
[1:18:09] agree with he said but all of a sudden
[1:18:11] he said one day Israel left Egypt and
[1:18:14] they got tired of the garlic and the
[1:18:15] leak in Egypt and brother said we all
[1:18:17] raised up and said amen We Said Amen

[1:22:04] pre now y'all y'all remember in 1962
[1:22:08] brother preaches on Blasphemous names
[1:22:11] remember and he starts off by correcting
[1:22:13] the Jehovah Witness you know what he
[1:22:16] says he says they're teaching now watch
[1:22:19] what they're teaching that the breath
[1:22:20] you breathe is the soul he said that's
[1:22:23] not right he said the breath is the wind
[1:22:26] and the wind is what you breathe into
[1:22:28] your nostrils he goes to Genesis 2 and
[1:22:30] Adam and says but what God did he
[1:22:32] breathe the breath of eternal life amen
[1:22:37] then he became a living Soul a soul that
[1:22:40] cannot die now notice breathed the
[1:22:43] breath of eternal life into his nostrils
[1:22:45] and he became Eternal Soul cause God
[1:22:48] breathed not what nature done but what
[1:22:51] God did see breathed the breath of life
[1:22:54] into his nostrils and he become a living
[1:22:56] Soul then you say to me well Adam died
[1:22:58] brother Brandon but remember before Adam
[1:23:01] died he had a lamb that redeemed
[1:23:04] him so we're not breathing Church of
[1:23:07] Christ air we're not breathing
[1:23:11] Pentecostal carryon on predestination
[1:23:14] air we are breathing predestinated who
[1:23:17] he fornew who is called he got a lamb to
[1:23:21] redeem them he was a type Adam fail then
[1:23:25] the lamb was provided for Adam because
[1:23:27] already in his nostrils had become the
[1:23:30] breath of the Eternal God and he became
[1:23:33] a living Soul he said now watch he said
[1:23:35] the African word is amoya he said which
[1:23:38] means the wind or the Unseen Force now
[1:23:41] watch animals breathe amoya and sinners
[1:23:44] breathe amoya listen bride we're not
[1:23:47] living on
[1:23:49] amoya we're not coming to church on Amo
[1:23:53] the animals are living on Moya Sinners
[1:23:55] are living on the Moya he said but God
[1:23:57] is especially upon Adam he breathed the
[1:23:59] breath of eternal life and he became an
[1:24:02] eternal person with God he had power
[1:24:04] like God listen brother takes it from
[1:24:07] Adam and says and someday the sons of
[1:24:10] God will again become God's listen I say
[1:24:14] that's not in the future that's
[1:24:17] happening right here in spoken word
[1:24:20] Tabernacle the same breath that made
[1:24:23] Adam a son is the same breath that's
[1:24:26] made you an eternal son come on and the
[1:24:29] prophet said the true church is born by
[1:24:32] the Breath of God he said let me read
[1:24:34] you and see whether the church is born
[1:24:36] of the Breath of God or not like Adam
[1:24:38] was in the beginning the father that
[1:24:40] sent with that sent him went in him come
[1:24:43] on Church the god that created Adam got
[1:24:46] into Adam by the breath of of the life
[1:24:49] right then in this day the god that
[1:24:52] called you that predestin ated you that
[1:24:55] elected you has come into you by the
[1:24:58] baptism of the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost can I say what a prophet said when
[1:25:05] the stature has molded itself up there
[1:25:08] in condition then God breathed upon them
[1:25:12] and said receive the Holy Ghost then you
[1:25:15] are a son of God you can join anything
[1:25:17] you want to but you are born into the
[1:25:20] Church of the Living God now watch what
[1:25:22] a prophet said God breathe upon them now

[1:25:28] ye the Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost he breathed upon them and said
[1:25:35] receive
[1:25:36] ye the Holy Ghost bam said in other
[1:25:39] words they didn't join they were born
[1:25:42] how were they born he said that's how we
[1:25:44] have eternal life is because we were
[1:25:46] spoken into existence by God not joined
[1:25:50] into a church but born by the word the
[1:25:54] Original
[1:25:57] Seed oh spoken word Tabernacle no wonder
[1:26:01] the devil can't get you no wonder the
[1:26:03] devil can't defeat you it's the same

[1:26:11] message of the hour and there is a bride
[1:26:13] who is come into
[1:26:15] existence and in her soul is the

[1:29:24] so there's a war going on the battle
[1:29:27] between the bride and the God of this
[1:29:29] evil age right now watch and in this war
[1:29:33] there's going to be some times that
[1:29:35] we're going to get knocked down there
[1:29:37] going to be times we're going to get
[1:29:38] hurt but y'all know what they had in the
[1:29:41] war days they had things called oxygen
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:48] tents testing one two oxygen tents
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] they had a tent that if you got into it
[1:29:59] it had
[1:30:02] oxygen in other words you went into it

[1:30:27] pool come on Church get your head out of
[1:30:31] heresy teaching I'm not looking for an
[1:30:33] airplane I'm not looking for a White
[1:30:36] Horse I'm not looking for brother BR to
[1:30:38] come back and set up a tent I am looking
[1:30:41] at the almighty God in his
[1:30:46] tent he's in his tent he's in his bride
[1:30:50] and he's breathing into her
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:55] see the prod God said it very beautiful
[1:30:57] he said what is it it's the word joining
[1:31:00] to the
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:04] word hallelujah it's the word joining to
[1:31:09] the word in other words Adam was the
[1:31:15] word but when the breath
[1:31:17] come the word joined to the word and
[1:31:21] there was a manifestation can and I say
[1:31:24] this to you we are called by the
[1:31:29] word now can I say it this Bible is the
[1:31:33] written word but since I'm looking at
[1:31:37] the predestinated
[1:31:40] word the written word called to the
[1:31:45] predestinated word and there was a union
[1:31:48] took
[1:31:49] place and all that was in God he poured
[1:31:53] in to Christ and all that was in Christ
[1:31:57] he poured into this word
[1:32:01] bride now I don't want to I don't want
[1:32:05] to I don't want to Bott in the meeting
[1:32:06] out here right now but let me just
[1:32:08] preach to you for a second okay I'm
[1:32:10] going to ask you a very I'm going to ask
[1:32:11] you a very simple but a very powerful
[1:32:13] question is this okay brother Stephen is
[1:32:17] it
[1:32:18] okay are we sufficiently impressed with
[1:32:23] the word in our
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:30] midst are
[1:32:32] we
[1:32:36] sufficiently not just impressed but
[1:32:39] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:32:44] our
[1:32:47] midst now Jesus knew there was going to
[1:32:49] be a terrible drift away from the word
[1:32:51] in the pergami and church age which was
[1:32:53] yet 200 years off from the Patmos Vision
[1:32:56] he knew that drift would cause him to go
[1:32:57] in the Dark Ages he knew the way man
[1:32:59] originally got away from God was by
[1:33:01] first leaving the word if you leave that
[1:33:04] word you have left
[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:11] god well brother Andrew all we done was
[1:33:13] we changed a little bit of the word then
[1:33:15] you left a little bit of
[1:33:18] God come on church now I might as well
[1:33:21] preach I'm here if you leave the word
[1:33:23] word you leave
[1:33:26] God can I say something to you can I say
[1:33:29] it you can leave the word and still have
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:36] signs come on church you can leave the
[1:33:40] word and still have signs but can I tell
[1:33:42] you what they're not Mark 16
[1:33:46] signs come on he said he is presenting
[1:33:49] himself to the CH I'm going to prove it
[1:33:50] to you to the church at pergamus and
[1:33:52] indeed to all churches of all ages now
[1:33:54] here's what he says I am the
[1:33:57] word if you want deity in your midst
[1:34:01] then welcome and receive the word don't
[1:34:04] ever let
[1:34:05] anyone
[1:34:07] anyone anyone or anything get between
[1:34:12] you and the word this which I am giving
[1:34:15] you the
[1:34:17] word is a revelation of myself I am the
[1:34:22] Lord remember
[1:34:26] that don't you ever let anyone or
[1:34:30] anything get between you and that word
[1:34:33] then he says I wonder if we are
[1:34:36] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:34:39] our midst I've not left my text Jesus
[1:34:43] went in a little room where the Jews
[1:34:45] were hid because of fear and the Bible
[1:34:48] says Jesus came in their midst in other
[1:34:53] words
[1:34:54] the word came in their
[1:34:57] midst were they sufficiently impressed
[1:35:01] with the
[1:35:05] word now can I preach to you the Bible
[1:35:08] said he would be crucified the Bible
[1:35:11] said he would be buried the Bible said
[1:35:13] he would go to hell the Bible said he
[1:35:15] would take back the keys of death hell
[1:35:16] and the grave are y'all hearing me the
[1:35:18] Bible said he would empty out paradise
[1:35:21] are you hearing me and the Bible said he
[1:35:23] would raise again on the third day not a
[1:35:25] bone in his body would be broken okay
[1:35:28] listen that was Zachariah that was the
[1:35:30] prophets that was all the scripture but
[1:35:33] when Jesus come walking in their
[1:35:36] midst they were still reading what
[1:35:38] Zachariah said but here was the
[1:35:42] Fulfillment of the word in their
[1:35:46] midst can I say this he can be in your
[1:35:49] midst but if you don't catch him he'll
[1:35:51] pass you by
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:55] come on now Mary Magdalene thought he
[1:35:57] was a gardener in the Tomb and here was
[1:36:00] the word walking with her are you
[1:36:03] hearing me and if he didn't wake her up
[1:36:05] to it it would have passed her right by
[1:36:08] on the road to EMAs there were two
[1:36:10] disciples they were walking with the
[1:36:13] word he was in their midst come on
[1:36:17] church he was the one they were talking
[1:36:19] about he was the one they were sad about
[1:36:21] but their eyes were holding but when
[1:36:24] they stepped in a little
[1:36:27] room when they constrained him to come
[1:36:31] into a little room he took the bread and
[1:36:34] he broke it and as he broke the
[1:36:37] bread are y'all hearing me sister sister
[1:36:40] he didn't he didn't even handle the
[1:36:41] bread and them eat it just as he broke
[1:36:44] it oh god brother just as he broke it
[1:36:48] their eyes come open imagine what it did
[1:36:51] to them when they eat it
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:54] if just the breaking of the bread could
[1:36:57] open their eyes then what did it do when
[1:37:00] they begin to feed upon
[1:37:03] it come on Church in 19 is this okay in
[1:37:08] 1963 the prophet preaches the seals he
[1:37:12] preaches the token and comes and
[1:37:14] preaches desperation and says oh Church
[1:37:17] rise pinch your conscience Shake
[1:37:20] Yourself he said there's something
[1:37:22] coming and he said if if you're not
[1:37:23] careful it'll pass you right by and you
[1:37:26] will miss
[1:37:31] it now I hope this okay because the
[1:37:35] prophet said now watch sufficiently
[1:37:38] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:37:42] don't get mad at me but he did not say
[1:37:47] signs he said word because signs can be
[1:37:53] imp
[1:37:54] impersonated but the word cannot be
[1:37:58] [Applause]
[1:38:01] impersonated now don't get mad at me but
[1:38:04] if any man claims to have the same gift
[1:38:07] or the same manifestation of the Messiah
[1:38:09] sign that William Brandon Marian had or
[1:38:12] anybody says another man does have that
[1:38:14] you put me on record that man has a Lon
[1:38:16] Spirit on
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:20] him come on church I don't think we
[1:38:23] ought to go around saying well what I
[1:38:24] hear on the tapes and the sign of
[1:38:26] discernment and the mess sign is back in
[1:38:28] the church listen brother br's not here
[1:38:30] today operating the first and second
[1:38:32] pull that's not our pull it had nothing
[1:38:35] to do with us but the third pull the
[1:38:39] word is in our
[1:38:43] midst the word is in this building
[1:38:46] tonight Discerning your thoughts calling
[1:38:48] out your situations ministering to your
[1:38:50] needs the word is in our midst listen he
[1:38:54] wants to breathe he wants to breathe
[1:38:58] come on Church brother said Watch 2
[1:39:00] Thessalonians 2 whom the Lord now watch
[1:39:02] oh my I'm running out of time then which
[1:39:04] the wicked then shall the wicked be
[1:39:06] revealed now can I watch this can I
[1:39:09] preach it to you then that shall the
[1:39:11] wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[1:39:14] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[1:39:17] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[1:39:20] coming
[1:39:24] where does breath come from when you
[1:39:27] speak your mouth whom the Lord shall
[1:39:32] destroy with the spirit of his mouth are
[1:39:35] y'all hearing me the same breath oh God
[1:39:40] it's here the same breath that saved you
[1:39:44] is the same breath that destroys your
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:50] enemy the same breath that called you to
[1:39:54] this message the same breath that opens
[1:39:57] your eyes to the revealing of the son of
[1:40:00] man is the same breath that will destroy
[1:40:04] the son of predition oh even him who is
[1:40:08] coming after the working of Satan with
[1:40:11] all powers and signs and ly wonders when
[1:40:14] the word says in the first seal when the
[1:40:17] word is refused then they are turned to
[1:40:20] their desires that would turn down
[1:40:22] reject the truth they would be given
[1:40:23] over to a reprobate mind and would
[1:40:26] believe a lie and would be damned by it
[1:40:29] that's what the holy spirit said now can
[1:40:32] I say this we are lovers of the
[1:40:36] word and the word is the
[1:40:39] truth and the word is in our
[1:40:43] midst now can I follow up my statement
[1:40:46] if the word is in our midst then the
[1:40:49] true signs
[1:40:53] and the true wonders are in our midst
[1:40:57] because the word has come into our midst
[1:41:00] and we have been sufficiently impressed
[1:41:04] with the word in our
[1:41:06] midst now you all know what Mark 16 says
[1:41:09] it says it like this it says are you
[1:41:12] with me Mark 16 says now the word would
[1:41:16] be in the Believers right and the prodag
[1:41:18] God said watch he said now look Jesus
[1:41:20] said the signs shall follow them believe
[1:41:23] what believe the word now the prophet of
[1:41:26] God said in this last day there's a
[1:41:28] generation of sign Seekers but God never
[1:41:31] Place signs ahead of his word so it's
[1:41:36] never the word following signs brother
[1:41:39] kma it's signs following the word now
[1:41:42] can I say something to you how do you as
[1:41:45] a Believer come into your position by
[1:41:48] the
[1:41:50] word so when the word brings you in into
[1:41:53] your position then God automatically
[1:41:55] gives
[1:41:57] you signs and wonders to accompany you
[1:42:01] in your position as a Believer who is
[1:42:05] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:42:07] that has positionally place them in the
[1:42:10] age they're living in brother brother
[1:42:12] brother AEL you probably remember this
[1:42:13] years ago we was at Camp I don't know if
[1:42:15] you was there or not but years ago Danny
[1:42:16] steaman was preaching there at the camp
[1:42:18] and brother Danny got to preach on Mark
[1:42:20] 16 and while he was preaching he goes
[1:42:22] down there and he gets two brothers you
[1:42:23] know and he says brother your signs and
[1:42:26] he says your wonders you can look it up
[1:42:28] on Internet it's real powerful he said
[1:42:29] your signs and your wonders he said now
[1:42:31] everywhere I go I'm the word he said you
[1:42:34] follow
[1:42:35] me so brother Danny started walking and
[1:42:38] them two boys started following him and
[1:42:40] you know what brother Danny never done
[1:42:42] he never stopped to look back and see if
[1:42:44] they were
[1:42:49] there he never stopped and made sure
[1:42:52] that signs and wonders was there he
[1:42:54] never stopped one time and said oh God
[1:42:56] I'm your son let signs and wonders be
[1:42:59] there I'm
[1:43:00] your he just took off walking in his
[1:43:04] position as the word and wherever he
[1:43:07] went they went with him he said now
[1:43:10] watch if I speed up signs and wond speed
[1:43:13] up he said if I slow down signs and wond
[1:43:17] slow
[1:43:18] down I love this one brother I love this
[1:43:21] one he he walked off the platform and he
[1:43:24] went into a dark place and he said if I
[1:43:26] go in a dark place signs and wonders go
[1:43:30] with
[1:43:32] me spoken word Tabernacle it's time to
[1:43:35] rise to your position as the stars of
[1:43:38] God and take back your position as a
[1:43:41] word born Church listen I am not ashamed
[1:43:44] to be called a word bride I am not
[1:43:47] ashamed to be identified as a word
[1:43:50] preacher I am saved by the word I am
[1:43:53] sealed by the word I Am Redeemed by the
[1:43:56] word I am encouraged by the word I am an
[1:43:59] overcomer by the word Everything I Do I
[1:44:02] Do It by the
[1:44:04] word you know why because I am
[1:44:08] sufficiently impressed with the word

[1:44:17] the word that's in our midst amen oh God
[1:44:19] I'm out of time can I say this preach my
[1:44:22] brother the word in the church there'll
[1:44:24] be
[1:44:26] Miracles if you just get the word in the
[1:44:29] church there will be Miracles
[1:44:33] automatically yes sir you know what your
[1:44:35] Prophet said yes he said miracles take
[1:44:38] place on the word amen are you hearing
[1:44:41] me Miracles take place on the word so
[1:44:45] what are you living by you're living by
[1:44:48] the Revelation yes sir of the word can I
[1:44:51] say this to you yes my brother can I say
[1:44:53] it yes and you cannot be deceived amen
[1:45:00] amen they tried didn't they they tried
[1:45:03] to hand you a little idea of don't quote
[1:45:05] brother bam just read the Bible but it
[1:45:07] choked
[1:45:08] you that's exactly
[1:45:11] right come on Church they tried to hand
[1:45:14] you a little idea I don't say brother
[1:45:16] R's name but it choked you that's
[1:45:18] exactly right you know why because
[1:45:20] you're a word born bride yes sir and the
[1:45:22] only you can live by is the pure
[1:45:25] original word that has not been altered
[1:45:29] by the way of Cain or by the doctrine of
[1:45:31] bam you are a word born bride and the
[1:45:35] only thing that you can live by is the
[1:45:37] word that's exactly right preach my I'm
[1:45:41] this close to it I might as well preach
[1:45:42] if you ever get the word then gifts and
[1:45:45] Sensations and line wonders and signs
[1:45:47] Will Never Move you from your Revelation
[1:45:51] amen amen amen
[1:45:53] preach can I preach it to you my brother
[1:45:56] on your bad days they can't move you
[1:45:58] when the church is cold they can't move
[1:46:00] you no problem W Glory when the
[1:46:04] attendance drops they can't get you to
[1:46:06] back off preaching the message amen amen
[1:46:11] you know why because your type in the
[1:46:13] Bible is Simeon yes sir and Simeon
[1:46:16] received a revelation that I will not
[1:46:19] die until I have seen the Lord's Christ
[1:46:22] yes come on Church Simeon received that
[1:46:25] Revelation he walked by that Revelation
[1:46:28] he lived by that Revelation and no mama
[1:46:31] carrying another baby could deceive
[1:46:34] Simeon into be leaving something that
[1:46:37] was apart from the original fresh
[1:46:40] Revelation yes my brother Glory 79 years
[1:46:44] old brother and he's all stooped over
[1:46:47] and his back is hurting and his
[1:46:48] shoulders is hurting and he can't even
[1:46:50] hardly make it to church
[1:46:54] so maybe he walks in church brother
[1:46:55] Steven sir and he sits down and here
[1:46:57] comes a little woman you know and she
[1:46:59] walks over and says look Simon here's
[1:47:01] the baby look here's the baby Simeon
[1:47:04] said that's an uncertain
[1:47:06] sound oh that's an uncertain sound see
[1:47:08] because oh God because the same God that
[1:47:12] breathed when I receive the revelation
[1:47:15] will bear witness of the manifestation
[1:47:17] of that
[1:47:19] resur of that Revelation listen if you
[1:47:21] couldn't sell it to s
[1:47:23] you'll never sell it to this bride amen
[1:47:26] amen amen amen amen amen preach my
[1:47:31] brother brother Steven we don't live on
[1:47:33] cheap Revelation uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:47:38] uhuh we don't live on cheap revelation
[1:47:41] we have the Vindicated word said what we
[1:47:45] got to do then is move ourselves out of
[1:47:46] the way I'm closing on this point okay
[1:47:49] preach it move ourselves out of the way
[1:47:52] that's right then the word will move in
[1:47:54] amen and the word will do things amen
[1:47:58] amen you move yourself out of the way
[1:48:00] amen and let the message move in then
[1:48:03] the message will do things that you or I
[1:48:06] can never do he said You Preach a gospel
[1:48:09] that can make a people that was once
[1:48:10] bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes
[1:48:13] and everything else out on the street
[1:48:15] can cause them to sit in Heavenly places
[1:48:18] in Christ Jesus are you ready for this

[1:49:44] Luke 1 and whenever that message got
[1:49:46] done preaching amen all she could say
[1:49:48] before the angel departed was these
[1:49:50] words be it unto me that's it according
[1:49:55] to Thy word amen when the angel appeared
[1:49:58] she had some questions how's this going
[1:50:00] to be what's going to bring it to pass
[1:50:02] what's going to manifest it by the time
[1:50:05] the angel got done delivering the
[1:50:08] message the Angel's message had so
[1:50:11] weakened her flesh had so robbed her of
[1:50:14] her human excuses that all she could say
[1:50:18] was be unto me according to Thy Word
[1:50:23] come on Mary you got a bunch of excuses
[1:50:26] you got a bunch of situations but the
[1:50:28] message has been delivered by the angel
[1:50:31] of the Lord in this generation all I can

[1:54:15] it all scripture all scripture I'm crazy
[1:54:20] enough to look up the word all you know
[1:54:22] what the word all in the Greek means it

[1:54:29] things contained in all scripture is
[1:54:33] inspired amen she said they come down
[1:54:35] here and they prayed for me according to
[1:54:37] Mark 16 that's it he said when they
[1:54:39] prayed for me she said the Holy Ghost
[1:54:41] come in and healed my body listen what
[1:54:44] her theological son said he said Mama in
[1:54:47] seminary we learned that Mark 16 from
[1:54:51] the ninth verse on is not inspired come
[1:54:54] on now come on
[1:54:56] now from the ninth verse on it's not
[1:54:59] inspired on she said well honey if God
[1:55:03] could heal me with a scripture that is
[1:55:06] uninspired then what could God do with
[1:55:09] that which is
[1:55:11] inspired Glory brother stepen I you know
[1:55:14] what you the kind of person I am you
[1:55:16] know what I did I went and read Mark 169
[1:55:20] and you know what Mark 169 said Mark 169
[1:55:23] said and he
[1:55:26] appeared he appeared unto Mary Magdalene
[1:55:30] of whom he had cast Seven Devils out of
[1:55:34] have y'all ever caught this when the
[1:55:36] prophet said they said Mark 16:9 on is
[1:55:38] uninspired brother B said the Theologian
[1:55:41] said it was put in there by a false
[1:55:45] witness but you know what I love about
[1:55:47] Mark 16:9 is they didn't go ask somebody
[1:55:51] that was in the service when Mary
[1:55:52] Magdalene got
[1:55:55] delivered but the very one he talked to
[1:55:58] was the one in whom the word had had an
[1:56:01] effect in her life let me say this to
[1:56:03] you there's a reason why sister they
[1:56:06] can't talk us how this message is we
[1:56:08] didn't just read about it we didn't just
[1:56:10] study it we didn't just listen to it but
[1:56:13] we are a direct effect of the message
[1:56:16] that's a powerful one I am a direct
[1:56:18] effect of the message of the seventh
[1:56:21] angel I am a witness he's a prophet I am
[1:56:24] a witness this is the third I am a
[1:56:26] witness he is here amen amen

[1:57:11] on them amen and said receive ye uh the
[1:57:15] Holy Ghost yes sir and I close on this
[1:57:18] point that word breathe means to blow or

[1:57:25] breathed on Adam and he become a living
[1:57:26] Soul are you ready for this sir and just
