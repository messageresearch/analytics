[37:50] left a job back in january
[37:52] or december
[37:55] not really chasing money but just trying
[37:56] something different
[37:58] and it didn't work so i landed where i
[38:00] am
[38:02] last week
[38:04] and i got on linkedin i kind of that's
[38:06] my only
[38:07] i guess you won't call it social media
[38:08] but it's
[38:10] and i noticed that my old company the
[38:12] one that i left in january there they
[38:14] were hiring for
[38:15] a customer service rep which is what i

[38:37] physical labor camp

[39:03] not work this whole week you know
[39:06] but god is good that's part of what you
[39:07] know
[39:09] part of what i was going through my mind
[39:10] when brother stephen was talking about
[39:11] justification and just how good god is
[39:14] and how amazing his love is
[39:16] you know because
[39:18] you know sometimes you walk away from
[39:20] things that maybe you shouldn't
[39:22] and that may be been the case but
[39:26] you know i thought i could do some good
[39:27] at another company and it just didn't
[39:28] work out
[39:30] so

[44:39] from one level to the next it's just so
[44:41] much
[44:42] coming out you know
[44:45] but um speaking about origin
[44:48] and how everything originated and
[44:50] abraham's seed was shown in the stars
[44:53] this song just came back to me
[44:55] i pray i can be a blessing to you
[45:04] the heavens declare
[45:06] the glory of god
[45:10] [Music]
[45:12] day on today
[45:15] authorities be
[45:19] [Music]
[45:20] night on tonight
[45:23] it showeth knowledge
[45:27] [Music]
[45:28] for they are all
[45:30] in god's perfect peace
[45:37] for tell me what will happen
[45:40] if the moon should leave her place
[45:45] then the face of the earth would be
[45:49] a dark and chaos again
[45:54] so what about the earthly hosts who are
[45:58] made in the image of god
[46:03] if we are not in order
[46:06] how can we do the works of god
[46:13] yet once more lord
[46:17] shake not the heaven but earth
[46:21] and many stars are being moved out of
[46:27] place
[46:30] but there are some who stayed the
[46:34] pleiades and orion
[46:39] in every age
[46:43] we kept the first estate
[46:48] and though the power
[46:52] of heaven are shaken
[46:57] we've received a kingdom
[47:01] that cannot be moved
[47:05] or that can be shaken
[47:10] will be shaken
[47:15] let thy word lord
[47:18] shake us into place
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] the world is again
[47:29] falling apart
[47:34] soon the millennium
[47:36] will
[47:37] [Applause]
[47:42] but first this kingdom
[47:45] will be in you spiritually
[47:51] before it comes in the earth
[47:54] literally
[47:59] but in the days of the ten toes
[48:02] came a rock struck without hands
[48:08] despite every image in our earth
[48:12] made by man
[48:17] i know you're not the kingdom of the
[48:20] lord is in you
[48:25] for the stone did not only strike but
[48:29] grew into a mountain too
[48:34] yet once more lord
[48:38] shake not just heaven but earth
[48:43] and many stars are being moved out of
[48:47] place
[48:49] [Applause]
[48:51] but there are some who stirred the
[48:55] pleiades and orion
[49:00] in every age
[49:03] who kept their first estate
[49:08] and though the powers
[49:11] of heaven are shaken
[49:16] we've received a kingdom
[49:20] that cannot be moved
[49:25] all that can be shaken
[49:29] will be shaken
[49:34] but let your word lord
[49:37] shake us into place
[49:43] [Music]
[49:44] we were like dry bones
[49:47] down in the
[49:49] valley
[49:52] then the son of man came
[49:55] with a prophecy
[50:01] and out of his mouth came seven
[50:05] thundering voices
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:09] to quicken and bring to life
[50:13] this scattered body
[50:17] then came a noise and a shaking
[50:21] as each bone came to its bone
[50:25] sinew and flesh skin came upon it but it
[50:30] had no life of its own
[50:35] but then he prophesied again the dynamic
[50:39] came into this body
[50:43] so today we can stand upon
[50:46] as a mighty marching army
[50:52] yet once more lord
[50:54] [Music]
[50:56] shake not just heaven but earth
[51:00] and many stars are being moved out of
[51:05] places
[51:08] but we are those who stood
[51:12] the pleiades and orion
[51:17] in this last day
[51:20] we've kept our first estate
[51:25] and though the power
[51:28] of heaven are shaken
[51:33] we've received a kingdom
[51:37] that cannot be moved
[51:41] all that can be shaken
[51:45] will
[51:46] be shaken
[51:51] let thy word lord
[51:54] shake us into place
[51:59] though the
[52:01] powers of heaven are shaking
[52:06] we've received a kingdom
[52:10] that cannot be moved
[52:15] or that can be shaken
[52:19] will
[52:20] be shaken
[52:24] but let thy word lord
[52:27] shake us into play
[52:33] let thy word lord
[52:36] shake us into play
[52:40] peace let thy word lord
[52:44] shake
[52:50] [Music]
[52:57] shake us lord into place hallelujah

[1:04:49] hard to say it but i'm going to say it
[1:04:52] if church is at 11 o'clock
[1:04:55] you need to leave a little bit early
[1:04:58] and you will give yourself a buffer
[1:05:01] if something happened on the traffic
[1:05:03] you can play with your buffer in other
[1:05:05] words it won't hurt you if you 20
[1:05:07] minutes early
[1:05:10] can you say amen
[1:05:12] if you're 20 minutes early that's fine
[1:05:14] you get into the church if brother david
[1:05:17] would or if it's the leadership of the
[1:05:20] holy spirit we can play a tape here you
[1:05:22] can get in here and sit with the
[1:05:24] atmosphere of the holy spirit while the
[1:05:26] tape is playing 20 minutes you get
[1:05:28] prepared is good
[1:05:30] but if you always live right straight
[1:05:33] and 45 minutes or 40 minutes or 30
[1:05:36] minutes and you're living right straight
[1:05:38] if something happened on the highway you
[1:05:40] doom
[1:05:41] to be behind except
[1:05:43] if you have a legitimate reason amen
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] [Laughter]
[1:05:52] oh my god hallelujah blessed be the name
[1:05:56] of the lord anyway i won't stop
[1:05:59] because i know how i've been fighting
[1:06:00] with the devil left and right
[1:06:03] but he's not going to win amen
[1:06:07] how many are still reading their cod
[1:06:11] one question every day
[1:06:13] you need a back
[1:06:15] you need to get back in line amen
[1:06:19] you need to get back in line we spend
[1:06:22] some money to invest in your spiritual
[1:06:25] soul
[1:06:26] make sure you use it you might wonder
[1:06:28] where we're getting our information we
[1:06:30] don't have any special place where we're
[1:06:33] getting our information the preacher the
[1:06:35] deacon the trustees the laity everybody
[1:06:38] we go into the same source either it's
[1:06:40] coming from the bible or it's coming
[1:06:41] from the message
[1:06:43] so make sure you read the message for
[1:06:45] yourself
[1:06:46] and i will strongly encourage the young
[1:06:48] people take note
[1:06:50] you will need it one day
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] take note you're going to need it one
[1:06:55] day you don't know if the lord is going
[1:06:56] to use you to witness to somebody
[1:06:58] and if you don't have your scripture put
[1:07:00] up together
[1:07:01] you won't know how to introduce the
[1:07:04] message to somebody because you'll be
[1:07:06] like i remember brother stephen saying
[1:07:08] that and you don't know
[1:07:10] so my encouragement if we're teaching
[1:07:12] something we're preaching something here
[1:07:15] you take those scriptures and put them
[1:07:16] together you say this is water baptism
[1:07:19] this is the scripture these are the
[1:07:21] scriptures here this is we talked about
[1:07:23] women now wearing paint these are
[1:07:25] description we're talking about this so
[1:07:27] you can keep that in your bible handy if
[1:07:29] you're talking to somebody you know you
[1:07:31] say open here open there open here up
[1:07:34] and there then they say where did you go
[1:07:36] to school
[1:07:37] no
[1:07:37] it was malachi for schooling
[1:07:40] amen blessed be the name of the lord we
[1:07:43] have a meeting yesterday with the team
[1:07:46] host
[1:07:46] leader yesterday and it was a wonderful
[1:07:50] meeting by god's grace we iron up almost
[1:07:52] everything so you give us some grace
[1:07:55] maybe couple weeks we will go ahead and
[1:07:57] explain it to the church in detail how
[1:08:00] after this last meeting that is coming
[1:08:02] up how are we going to start proceeding
[1:08:04] with a meeting i send a text
[1:08:07] specifically
[1:08:08] saying team leader or anybody else who
[1:08:12] feel like they want to help so if you
[1:08:14] were not part of the previous team
[1:08:17] leader that doesn't mean that you cannot
[1:08:19] be a whole story team leader anybody in
[1:08:23] this church can be a team leader any
[1:08:26] sister if you wanted to but if you want
[1:08:28] to be a team leader you got to be here
[1:08:30] on time you got to commit it you got to
[1:08:33] do what we ask you to do because we're
[1:08:35] going to depend on you to make sure
[1:08:37] everything is running smooth everybody
[1:08:39] clears so far so you give us a couple
[1:08:41] weeks we're going to put everything
[1:08:43] together and present it to you this is
[1:08:45] the way things are going to be running
[1:08:47] amen in a hotel there was a special
[1:08:49] grace in the house of uh obedience
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] if you were not yesterday you know you
[1:08:56] won't understand what we're saying by
[1:08:57] obedience so god gives some time grace
[1:09:00] until things are put up but we can
[1:09:03] continue with that grace over we gotta
[1:09:05] move into a different step of grace in
[1:09:08] other words things have to begin to get
[1:09:11] in order later by a little little bit
[1:09:14] later you must feel
[1:09:17] like i'm speaking a strange language but
[1:09:19] if god give me grace when i will get
[1:09:21] into that justification sanctification
[1:09:24] baptism of the holy ghost you can see
[1:09:25] how you can be in the message but you're
[1:09:28] under denomination
[1:09:30] but you are in a message
[1:09:34] okay no problem it is coming you're
[1:09:37] going to see how you are in the message
[1:09:39] church for years
[1:09:40] but you're under a denomination
[1:09:42] and you're already trapped in a prison
[1:09:45] and you think you're a message believer
[1:09:48] and you're not progressing
[1:09:50] you must be able to stand
[1:09:53] at home
[1:09:54] sometime quiet and look at your life
[1:09:57] where you come from
[1:09:59] and then look where you are
[1:10:01] and make sure you can see a difference
[1:10:04] from last year to where you are
[1:10:07] if there is no difference it's telling
[1:10:09] you something is wrong
[1:10:10] if you keep worshiping god the same way
[1:10:13] you were worshiping god one year passed
[1:10:15] something is not correct
[1:10:17] you must be going from height to height
[1:10:20] from height to height
[1:10:22] religion is something that leaves you in
[1:10:25] one state and keep warming you like a
[1:10:28] microwave amen so if you're in step one
[1:10:32] 20 years you're still in step one you
[1:10:34] just go to church go back up go to
[1:10:36] church go back up and nothing changes
[1:10:39] that is religion the message is not a
[1:10:41] religion the message is a life
[1:10:44] it's christ himself amen so make sure
[1:10:47] sometimes you stay at home and you watch
[1:10:49] your life and you say five years what
[1:10:51] was i doing am i keep doing the same
[1:10:53] thing
[1:10:55] if you keep doing the same thing
[1:10:57] something is wrong
[1:10:59] don't fool yourself
[1:11:00] something is wrong thank you musician
[1:11:04] something is wrong amen so lord willing
[1:11:07] we put up everything together and send
[1:11:10] to you our i mean presented to the
[1:11:12] church and probably we might have to
[1:11:14] present it again in one of the meeting
[1:11:16] when we're here just to rehearse and
[1:11:18] make sure everything is running smoothly
[1:11:21] amen
[1:11:22] and do me a favor i know you super busy
[1:11:27] you more busy than your pastor
[1:11:32] i know that
[1:11:34] but when we send the text
[1:11:36] from the church
[1:11:38] and we need response
[1:11:41] if you are gonna be there or if you are
[1:11:44] not going to be there
[1:11:46] please respond
[1:11:49] say no brother i won't make it
[1:11:52] oh yes
[1:11:53] i can make it so we have a head count
[1:11:56] and we know what we're doing amen
[1:11:59] it won't help if you're looking at the
[1:12:01] text because that's a lot of habits that
[1:12:03] we have we're looking at the text and we
[1:12:05] just don't respond i'm not going to be
[1:12:07] there i'm not going to respond and
[1:12:08] sometimes you don't respond and you show
[1:12:11] up
[1:12:12] so now we're confused so it just it
[1:12:14] takes less than maybe five seconds
[1:12:18] when we send the text and the text say
[1:12:21] please respond please
[1:12:23] respond amen
[1:12:25] don glenn said the text
[1:12:28] there is a difference between reading
[1:12:30] the text and glancing
[1:12:32] glancing did you see the text yes i saw
[1:12:33] the text
[1:12:34] and then you ask a question and the
[1:12:36] question that you asked was already
[1:12:38] given in the text
[1:12:40] it is telling me you didn't read the
[1:12:42] text you glanced at the text read the
[1:12:45] text and if they say respond just
[1:12:48] respond and say i cannot make it or i
[1:12:50] will make it or i'm a little bit tight
[1:12:52] lord's willing i'll try my best to be
[1:12:54] there amen
[1:12:56] we have people on the front hook up
[1:12:58] yesterday they were not here but at
[1:13:00] least they were on the front hook up in
[1:13:02] the meeting amen so if you can't make it
[1:13:05] there are many ways you can do it but at
[1:13:07] least respond so we know what we are
[1:13:10] doing if we need some people to work at
[1:13:13] the church respond and say i can make it
[1:13:15] or i cannot make it everybody clear on
[1:13:17] that one
[1:13:19] make the deacon job so easy amen
[1:13:23] don't worry i'm gonna get that devil not
[1:13:25] you i'm gonna get that devil out
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] another thing if you would when we bring
[1:13:31] the children in the sanctuary make sure
[1:13:35] the kids don't have any pain or any
[1:13:37] sharpies
[1:13:38] we don't want any riding
[1:13:40] on the chair these are the church
[1:13:42] furniture we will need to keep it
[1:13:45] cherish it and make sure everything is
[1:13:46] good we already saw a mark of a pen
[1:13:49] on a chair so make sure if your children
[1:13:52] are coming watch them no sharpie no
[1:13:56] crayons or no
[1:13:58] marker whatever you call it don't bring
[1:14:01] it inside the church if they have it you
[1:14:03] must make sure you
[1:14:05] oversee them so we don't end up having
[1:14:08] to find a new chair or something like
[1:14:10] that amen so just want to remind you
[1:14:12] you're taking your children to the
[1:14:14] nursery the nursery is not a playground
[1:14:19] the nurse is for you to change your baby
[1:14:22] you finish changing if there is nothing
[1:14:24] else to do you get back again in the
[1:14:26] church amen
[1:14:27] we don't want those all the habits and
[1:14:29] pull them up here where we get to the
[1:14:31] kid leave them there and they begin to
[1:14:33] run there like a playground the church
[1:14:35] is not a playground we're coming to get
[1:14:37] the word of god when we finish we go
[1:14:40] back up amen so we need your
[1:14:42] participation
[1:14:44] in what we're doing in the church we're
[1:14:46] here to serve god's people amen
[1:14:50] whatever we do is to serve god's people
[1:14:54] be part of it
[1:14:56] and it's going to help amen
[1:14:58] if we're starting the meeting for the
[1:15:00] young people for question and answer and
[1:15:03] the meetings start at three try the best
[1:15:05] if you can to be here before three amen
[1:15:08] especially the young people we cannot
[1:15:10] start a meeting at three o'clock and
[1:15:12] everybody shows up at five o'clock when
[1:15:15] everything is set they already lay
[1:15:17] everything on the table you come late
[1:15:19] you eat and you leave early that is not
[1:15:22] good
[1:15:22] amen brother branham say it's like a pig
[1:15:25] who sits under the tree who always eats
[1:15:28] the apple but never stop back
[1:15:31] to stop and to think where are the apple
[1:15:34] coming back
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] in other words you're eating food but
[1:15:38] you never stop and say who prepared this
[1:15:41] food who set up this table what can i do
[1:15:44] to also help the next time what can i do
[1:15:48] to clean up i came there is a tent that
[1:15:50] is already put there who put up this
[1:15:53] tent who was here placing the chairs
[1:15:56] have that mentality of always serving
[1:16:00] eternal life brother branham he says
[1:16:02] what
[1:16:04] living for others amen
[1:16:06] so make sure your life is also living
[1:16:09] for others
[1:16:10] we cannot have 20 meetings and you never
[1:16:13] show up on one of them
[1:16:15] or when you show up you late
[1:16:18] you get in church get the word get out
[1:16:21] get in the car out can't even shake
[1:16:23] somebody's hand
[1:16:25] you're going to see me in heaven for
[1:16:26] eternity
[1:16:28] i don't know how are you going to run
[1:16:30] away
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:32] at least stop shake somebody's hand you
[1:16:35] say sister lorell it has been a long
[1:16:37] time i have not seen you everything is
[1:16:39] okay now is the family the family good
[1:16:41] god bless you then you can move on and
[1:16:43] get in your car and go at least you made
[1:16:45] a difference for one sister amen
[1:16:49] everybody clear
[1:16:54] like it or not here i come
[1:16:58] let's stand and go to the word
[1:17:05] i already decided one thing i'm not
[1:17:07] gonna have your blood in my hand
[1:17:10] that is clear and that's the way it
[1:17:12] works
[1:17:15] brother david it looks like we're going
[1:17:17] through the same headache so we probably
[1:17:19] bring it back here and we figure it out
[1:17:21] what to do you say it's 100 feet but
[1:17:24] it's still playing up
[1:17:26] amen so be patient with us i'm going to
[1:17:28] give you the scripture let's go to
[1:17:30] genesis chapter 19.
[1:17:37] have a mentality of serving
[1:17:41] that's a good mentality of serving and
[1:17:44] of sacrifice
[1:17:47] if everybody come late
[1:17:49] we won't have church
[1:17:51] somebody must be here earlier to make
[1:17:53] sure the light is turned on the air
[1:17:56] conditioning is good and everything so
[1:17:58] if you always come when the air
[1:18:00] conditioning is already set up that's
[1:18:02] not good make sure one day you also you
[1:18:04] come and say brother robert how can we
[1:18:06] turn that air conditioning on amen if
[1:18:09] brother mike i really need to travel how
[1:18:11] can i turn that instrument on when
[1:18:13] brother mike daley is not there if
[1:18:16] brother kelly is not there how can i
[1:18:17] play the drama amen so we have
[1:18:20] replacement like that
[1:18:22] on wednesday brother caleb had to leave
[1:18:24] the song if he was not there
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:29] he's going to move brother robert up to
[1:18:31] here then it's a different story i
[1:18:33] believe he was brother david who was
[1:18:34] playing the drum right
[1:18:36] if brother david was not there
[1:18:41] always have a mentality of serving
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:45] we are a family
[1:18:48] always have a mentality of serving
[1:18:51] there is no spot here that are hauled by
[1:18:54] somebody
[1:18:55] definitely
[1:18:57] except the pastor
[1:18:59] until then
[1:19:01] everybody
[1:19:02] even the trustees and the deacon at the
[1:19:05] end of the year all the offices expires
[1:19:09] then on january we got to bring them up
[1:19:11] again and ask you do you want to
[1:19:13] continue with them or not

[1:19:47] ahead and get an instrument and start

[1:24:23] and it came to pass
[1:24:26] that the beggar died you already know
[1:24:28] that story right
[1:24:29] the reaching young ruler
[1:24:31] that's why i skipped the other one and
[1:24:33] it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:24:36] and he was carried by angel
[1:24:39] into the bosoms of into abraham's bosom
[1:24:42] you know what it is
[1:24:44] it was in paradise

[1:24:50] and he was
[1:24:53] the rich man
[1:24:54] died
[1:24:59] we know what kind of death that is
[1:25:02] and he was water
[1:25:04] what do they bury in the cemetery
[1:25:10] so the body of the rich man
[1:25:14] was in the cemetery
[1:25:16] or in the grave
[1:25:18] anybody
[1:25:20] was the rich man in the grave
[1:25:26] when you preach this message it's a
[1:25:27] different sound
[1:25:29] was the rich man in the grave
[1:25:35] he was not there
[1:25:36] right
[1:25:37] so
[1:25:38] in the cemetery do we have people there

[1:26:53] so why do people say they go to cemetery
[1:26:56] to do stuff and they talk to spirit
[1:27:02] why sorry

[1:27:06] out

[1:28:21] and sees abraham a pharaoh
[1:28:24] and lazarus in his bosom
[1:28:27] because abraham is the father of all
[1:28:31] that's why the jews say we got abraham
[1:28:33] for our father you remember in john
[1:28:34] chapter 8
[1:28:36] right
[1:28:37] and he cry and say

[1:29:32] that the rich young ruler is more
[1:29:35] concerned in hell is water
[1:29:40] are you awake

[1:29:47] the arm burning
[1:29:49] oh my arm is burning so much put water
[1:29:51] here
[1:29:53] but the rich young ruler in hell was
[1:29:56] worrying about one place
[1:29:59] to be refreshed
[1:30:01] and that place is water
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:13] be careful with your tongue

[1:31:49] remember that you in your lifetime
[1:31:52] receive your good things
[1:31:54] and likewise lazarus evil things
[1:31:57] but now he is comforted and you are
[1:32:00] water
[1:32:02] oh i thought he was burning
[1:32:10] they are tormenting what the body
[1:32:14] they are tormenting though
[1:32:18] let me help you up again
[1:32:20] are they tormenting the body
[1:32:23] are these flames attacking the body
[1:32:26] the flame are attacking water
[1:32:31] are we okay now
[1:32:32] if i don't go this hard you're going to
[1:32:34] miss when i'm flying amen
[1:32:37] 26 and beside all this between us and
[1:32:41] you there is a great gulf so that there
[1:32:44] which would pass from here to you cannot
[1:32:48] neither can they pass to us that would
[1:32:50] come from there in other words no
[1:32:52] crossing no communication the bridge has
[1:32:55] been broken on 85
[1:32:57] then he said i pray you therefore father
[1:33:00] that you would send him to my father
[1:33:02] house
[1:33:04] for i have five
[1:33:06] brethren
[1:33:07] that he may do what
[1:33:10] or warn them
[1:33:11] lest they also come into this place of
[1:33:15] burning
[1:33:18] so hell is a place of water
[1:33:22] and the rich young ruler when he was in
[1:33:24] hell did he
[1:33:26] wish that anybody else come to meet him
[1:33:31] why
[1:33:35] torment
[1:33:38] 29 abraham said to him they have
[1:33:43] ander
[1:33:45] the law and the prophet the word of god
[1:33:47] is there
[1:33:48] and the prophet
[1:33:51] let them hear them and he said nay
[1:33:54] father abraham
[1:33:56] when this man was leaving
[1:33:59] did he ever seen abraham
[1:34:02] how did he recognize that was abraham
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:10] there is a recognition
[1:34:13] of abraham
[1:34:14] even though he was not there
[1:34:17] when peter john and james
[1:34:19] was on the man transfiguration
[1:34:22] when the cloud came
[1:34:24] peter look he said that's elijah and
[1:34:27] that's moses
[1:34:28] was peter in the time of elijah moses
[1:34:32] did they have a picture of moses
[1:34:35] did they have a dvd player that they
[1:34:37] recorded moses
[1:34:38] where did peter see moses
[1:34:41] how did peter recognize moses and elijah
[1:34:49] hallelujah
[1:34:52] and he said no father abraham but if one
[1:34:56] went to them from the dead like jesus
[1:34:59] resurrected they will repent
[1:35:01] and he said to him if they hear not
[1:35:03] moses and the prophet neither will there
[1:35:06] be water
[1:35:08] you can say all you want
[1:35:11] though one rose from there
[1:35:14] did one rose from the dead yes jesus
[1:35:17] rose from the dead
[1:35:18] how many are persuaded
[1:35:21] origin
[1:35:24] origin
[1:35:25] now let's go to revelation chapter 13
[1:35:29] chapter 14.
[1:35:33] genesis 19 brimstone
[1:35:37] fire
[1:35:38] into which city sodom and gomorrah and
[1:35:41] the city that i round about anybody
[1:35:43] clear
[1:35:44] the rich young ruler his body was in the
[1:35:46] grave on the earth
[1:35:48] in the cemetery his soul and spirit in
[1:35:51] hell
[1:35:52] we go in the cemetery we are afraid like
[1:35:55] those people are sitting there they're
[1:35:57] going to tell you don't sit on my tomb
[1:36:03] [Laughter]
[1:36:06] revelation chapter 19.
[1:36:09] if i say something wrong you come and
[1:36:10] tell me because i was reading the bible
[1:36:15] uh 14 i'm sorry
[1:36:17] revelation chapter 14
[1:36:19] if you're there you can say amen i
[1:36:21] believe we already dealt with these
[1:36:23] three angels
[1:36:24] you remember there was one that flew
[1:36:26] with everlasting gospel then there was a
[1:36:28] second one and there was the third one
[1:36:30] you know those angels i already preached
[1:36:32] about it who was the first one
[1:36:35] and the second one and the third one if
[1:36:38] you have any question you need to go
[1:36:39] back and listen to the series because we
[1:36:41] already explained it we're building on
[1:36:43] things that were already placed there
[1:36:46] amen verse nine
[1:36:48] the third angel which is brother branham
[1:36:50] and the third angel followed them saying
[1:36:53] with a loud voice if any man worship the
[1:36:56] beast
[1:36:57] and his image
[1:36:59] and receive his mark in his forehead or
[1:37:03] in his hand
[1:37:04] we already explain you this the mark on
[1:37:06] the forehead knowledge understand our
[1:37:08] knowledge and in the hand your works you
[1:37:11] can go back to the ceiling the same
[1:37:13] shall drink off the wine of water
[1:37:17] remember he's a lion
[1:37:18] of the wrath of god which is poured out
[1:37:21] without mixture into the cup of his
[1:37:24] indignation his anger
[1:37:26] and he shall be
[1:37:30] everybody clear
[1:37:31] he shall be water
[1:37:33] he shall be tormented
[1:37:36] he shall be tormented
[1:37:39] tormented
[1:37:41] tormented like in hell he shall be
[1:37:44] tormented with water
[1:37:47] and water
[1:37:49] he shall be tormented with water
[1:37:52] everybody on the board
[1:37:53] and water
[1:37:55] this happened in genesis 19
[1:37:58] now it's going to happen again
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:03] will be tormented with fire and
[1:38:06] brimstone in the presence of the
[1:38:10] the elect angels
[1:38:13] you got it now you remember that elect
[1:38:15] angel from in the presence of the holy
[1:38:18] the angel that did not fall with lucifer
[1:38:22] because there were two categories of
[1:38:23] angels some were coming out of god the
[1:38:26] other one came out from the lineage of
[1:38:28] lucifer
[1:38:29] the holy angel and in the presence of
[1:38:32] the lamb
[1:38:33] and the smoke of the
[1:38:35] i thought the smoke of the fire
[1:38:40] so torment got smoke
[1:38:46] torment got smoke
[1:38:48] so torment
[1:38:50] got smoke
[1:38:54] not only fire
[1:38:56] and the tomb and the smoke of their
[1:38:58] torment
[1:38:59] ascended up forever and ever and they
[1:39:02] have no rest day no night who worship
[1:39:06] the beast and his image that's why the
[1:39:08] voice say come on from among them
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:12] and whosoever received the mark of his
[1:39:14] name
[1:39:15] here is the patient of the
[1:39:18] that's a different category now
[1:39:21] here are dead that keep the commandment
[1:39:23] of who
[1:39:24] and the faith of who
[1:39:26] these are the saints and i heard a voice
[1:39:29] from heaven saying to me
[1:39:31] right blessed are the dead which die in
[1:39:35] though
[1:39:36] from here after yes says the spirit that
[1:39:40] they may rest from their labor and their
[1:39:43] works do follow

[1:40:11] job

[1:40:15] for his children
[1:40:16] lest per adventure
[1:40:19] some of them sin
[1:40:21] and father i'm standing here if any that
[1:40:24] is here
[1:40:25] have done something that grieved you
[1:40:28] or spoken something that you were not
[1:40:30] pleased with
[1:40:31] or didn't consecrate the way that they
[1:40:34] are supposed to be oh we're caught up
[1:40:36] into a lot of talking a lot of frenzy a
[1:40:40] lot of stuff that took them away from
[1:40:43] the channel
[1:40:44] father as his father i'm pleading that
[1:40:47] you forgive us all
[1:40:48] may you come down this morning lord

[1:41:21] the omega and speak to our soul father
[1:41:24] in the name of jesus christ
[1:41:26] amen amen god bless you as you are
[1:41:30] already seated amen
[1:41:33] i'm going to read something here just to
[1:41:35] refresh you we have many keys that we
[1:41:39] have been used a lot in the scripture
[1:41:41] amen the first key that i gave you i
[1:41:44] gave you a scripture a quote where
[1:41:46] brother branham said god cannot give a
[1:41:49] first revelation then add another one
[1:41:51] amen when god gives a revelation he's
[1:41:54] going to continue with that same
[1:41:56] revelation but god can add more
[1:41:59] information
[1:42:00] to that revelation to help you get that
[1:42:03] revelation and understand it better you
[1:42:05] need those keys to understand the
[1:42:07] message and to also understand the
[1:42:09] scripture i also gave you a key where
[1:42:12] brother branham said that every
[1:42:13] scripture and every prophecy has a
[1:42:15] compound meaning so he can go one
[1:42:18] direction on another one depending on
[1:42:20] the scripture that's why a pastor can
[1:42:23] take a scripture and preach and an
[1:42:25] evangelist can come and take that same
[1:42:27] scripture and preach and then a teacher
[1:42:30] come and take that same scripture and
[1:42:32] preach and you're gonna see like every
[1:42:34] one of them keep coming with something
[1:42:36] new it is because there is a flexibility
[1:42:39] that goes with the scripture amen and
[1:42:42] i'm going to remind you on this key
[1:42:44] again because we need it today brother
[1:42:47] branham said that the bible is written
[1:42:49] in water
[1:42:51] in mysteries amen and jesus thanked the
[1:42:54] father for it see that he was wrote in
[1:42:57] mysteries in symbols
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:00] but when you see when but when you can
[1:43:03] see that the scripture
[1:43:04] is not contradictory that you can say
[1:43:08] that and can see that by the revelation
[1:43:11] of god the whole world is wrote in water
[1:43:15] if you don't look through the eyes of
[1:43:18] the revelation of god you might end up
[1:43:20] with a conclusion that the bible is
[1:43:22] contradicting itself
[1:43:24] and you can end up with the same thing
[1:43:27] like brother branham say one thing here
[1:43:29] and brother one i'm saying another thing
[1:43:31] here and it seems to be like it's a
[1:43:33] contradiction when it's not the problem
[1:43:35] is you need to get under the spirit of
[1:43:38] god and once you are in the spirit of
[1:43:40] god then you're going to see that
[1:43:42] everything is dove telling from genesis
[1:43:45] all the way to the revelation
[1:43:48] brother brother say the whole world is
[1:43:51] wrote in mystery and only the knowledge
[1:43:54] of god
[1:43:56] can reveal it
[1:43:57] then when you get and say punctuate
[1:44:01] every word of god with an amen
[1:44:03] then add that to your faith
[1:44:06] in the church ages brother branham say
[1:44:09] but a mystery
[1:44:11] if the word of god is written in
[1:44:12] mysteries if the whole bible is written
[1:44:15] in mysteries what about them say a
[1:44:18] mystery require the preaching of the
[1:44:21] spirit
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:24] anybody clear i hope you're still awake
[1:44:27] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:44:30] spirit
[1:44:31] or he never become water
[1:44:36] so if we stay under preaching preaching
[1:44:38] preaching preaching we can keep moving
[1:44:41] forward but a lot of questions will
[1:44:43] continue to be in the life of the people
[1:44:46] and you will never resolve them and as
[1:44:49] long as those questions are there you're
[1:44:50] going to be confused because you don't
[1:44:53] know what you're shooting for amen
[1:44:55] a mystery require the teaching of the
[1:44:59] spirit not the teaching of a man but the
[1:45:02] teaching of the spirit or in never
[1:45:05] become clear
[1:45:06] how we need to hear from the pastor
[1:45:11] how we need to hear from who
[1:45:13] from god and lay yourself open
[1:45:17] and become yielded to the spirit to heal
[1:45:20] and to water
[1:45:21] you gotta know because my people perish
[1:45:24] for lack of water
[1:45:26] everybody clear so far
[1:45:28] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:45:31] branham say again this one here now
[1:45:33] we're climbing pretty good hallelujah
[1:45:36] brother branham said we realized that
[1:45:38] reading the bible
[1:45:40] you do not read it like you would the
[1:45:43] newspaper
[1:45:46] because it's been the wisdom of the holy
[1:45:50] spirit
[1:45:51] to hide water
[1:45:54] many things that's why the bible is
[1:45:56] written in mysteries god want to hide
[1:46:00] certain things
[1:46:02] to certain people
[1:46:04] and that certain people is the children
[1:46:07] of the devil
[1:46:09] god will reveal his word only to his
[1:46:12] children
[1:46:13] so it depends on the origin that you
[1:46:16] come from
[1:46:17] then god can either block his word or
[1:46:20] unfold his word to you
[1:46:24] because it's been the wisdom of the holy
[1:46:27] ghost
[1:46:28] the holy spirit to hide many things from
[1:46:31] the eyes of the water
[1:46:33] and prudent and would reveal it to her
[1:46:37] such as woodwater
[1:46:39] how can you learn if somebody doesn't
[1:46:42] teach you
[1:46:44] god wants somebody who is water
[1:46:48] so he can just take them over to one
[1:46:51] side and sit them down and say
[1:46:55] here it is
[1:46:57] why is god not showing you things
[1:47:02] why is god not talking to you
[1:47:07] why is god not giving you even a dream
[1:47:10] why is the holy spirit not talking to
[1:47:13] you
[1:47:14] you must check your appetite
[1:47:18] you must check your spiritual anger
[1:47:21] you must check what you like the most
[1:47:25] because where your treasure is
[1:47:27] that's where your heart is going to be
[1:47:30] if we call people in church
[1:47:33] look how you react
[1:47:35] with going to church
[1:47:39] everybody so far
[1:47:40] when they say going to work
[1:47:43] how do you react
[1:47:46] going to work you can even take a
[1:47:48] tylenol to make sure you make it work
[1:47:52] going to work you're gonna do everything
[1:47:54] you must do in order to be at work on
[1:47:57] time
[1:47:58] if you gotta wake up on time you gotta
[1:48:00] go to sleep early on the bed
[1:48:03] but when it comes to go to church how do
[1:48:05] you react
[1:48:07] god will not bring you his revelation if
[1:48:10] you lazy
[1:48:12] god will not speak to you if you are not
[1:48:15] interested to him
[1:48:17] god will not speak to you if you only
[1:48:20] interested in everything else and the
[1:48:22] last thing you have to think is about
[1:48:25] the things of god
[1:48:29] hallelujah
[1:48:30] he said he's gonna take them over to one
[1:48:33] side and sit them down and say here it
[1:48:37] is
[1:48:38] child of man this is it the world don't
[1:48:41] understand this but you shall understand
[1:48:45] let it be this way then all scripture
[1:48:48] given by water
[1:48:50] then it must be interpreted by water
[1:48:54] then scripture must compare with water
[1:48:57] the bible is written in water
[1:49:01] if you want god to unfold his word to
[1:49:04] you
[1:49:05] you need to begin to get closer to god
[1:49:09] everybody clear so far
[1:49:11] now we found out when we started here
[1:49:15] that last sunday that the devil sinned
[1:49:19] and the devil his angel
[1:49:22] his theophany his men all of them were
[1:49:25] put into hell ever here
[1:49:28] so those that were precipitated down
[1:49:31] into hell which was a prison we found
[1:49:34] out that we have four categories there
[1:49:38] the devil is the king of hell that was
[1:49:42] the first person the king which was
[1:49:45] satan himself
[1:49:46] was precipitated into hell
[1:49:49] the second one are the children of satan
[1:49:53] which are the tears
[1:49:55] or the wrong seed
[1:49:57] amen
[1:49:59] the third one
[1:50:00] are the angelic beings
[1:50:03] everybody clear
[1:50:05] which we call the demons
[1:50:07] everybody clear
[1:50:09] and the fourth one we have what we call
[1:50:12] the theophanies
[1:50:15] because these three categories here we
[1:50:19] found them that they fall under the word
[1:50:21] angel so when we say angel
[1:50:24] it's theophany angel is angelic being
[1:50:28] angel is also the children of whom satan
[1:50:32] ever clear so far
[1:50:33] now when we spoke about god we say that
[1:50:36] god was the bride and the morning star
[1:50:41] when we spoke about the children of god
[1:50:43] the children of god where the morning
[1:50:46] stars
[1:50:47] everybody here
[1:50:48] when we talk about the devil the devil
[1:50:51] was the son of the morning
[1:50:53] you remember that
[1:50:58] but when we talk about children or men
[1:51:02] children of satan they also have a name
[1:51:08] in the book of jude
[1:51:10] the bible says this in verse 12
[1:51:13] that these men that we spoke about
[1:51:16] the children of satan these are water
[1:51:22] these children of satan
[1:51:24] called the tears
[1:51:26] called the men
[1:51:28] the bible said their water
[1:51:32] spots what are you trying to say
[1:51:36] the bible says that the bride
[1:51:39] will be without water
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:45] anybody clear
[1:51:47] the bride of jesus christ
[1:51:49] will be without water
[1:51:51] there won't be any child of the devil
[1:51:55] inside the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:04] so far
[1:52:05] jesus put in your feast of water
[1:52:09] so when the children of god live in love
[1:52:13] when the church is going in love
[1:52:16] when everybody in the church is under
[1:52:19] the feast of love
[1:52:21] the spot or a child of the devil will be
[1:52:25] always there to disrupt that order
[1:52:32] these are
[1:52:33] spot in your feast of water
[1:52:36] when they're feast with you because
[1:52:38] they're a crow
[1:52:41] the crow can eat the same thing the dove
[1:52:43] is eating
[1:52:45] they it's a much multitude everybody
[1:52:48] when they're feast with you
[1:52:51] feeding themselves without water
[1:52:53] in other words they are sitting with you
[1:52:56] but they are feeding without respect
[1:52:59] they are not afraid of anything
[1:53:02] they are not afraid of the presence of
[1:53:04] god
[1:53:05] they are not afraid of the authority and
[1:53:08] the working of the holy spirit
[1:53:11] they can go outside sleep with a man and
[1:53:14] come to church and sit down
[1:53:16] they can go outside sleep with a woman
[1:53:18] come to church and take the lord's
[1:53:20] supper
[1:53:21] because their origin is an origin from
[1:53:24] the devil
[1:53:28] anybody here
[1:53:29] there are clouds that are without water
[1:53:33] usually when you see clouds gathering up
[1:53:35] what are you expecting
[1:53:37] rain
[1:53:38] it is the brother or the sister that you
[1:53:41] think you can get a rain out of him but
[1:53:44] when you get there there is no rain
[1:53:48] you say i'm gonna call him i'm gonna
[1:53:49] talk to him i feel depressed when you
[1:53:51] talk to him he's filled with politics
[1:53:55] there is no rain there is no word that
[1:53:57] you can receive from them to encourage
[1:54:00] you every time you talk to them the
[1:54:02] outside on certain things they are
[1:54:04] uncomfortable there is no rain
[1:54:06] yet the crowd
[1:54:08] they look like a brother they look like
[1:54:10] a sister but there is no rain
[1:54:15] here
[1:54:16] carry out of every water
[1:54:19] brother branham said wind in the
[1:54:21] scriptures speak about truth
[1:54:24] so anytime there is a problem in the
[1:54:27] church you're going to see them in the
[1:54:29] problem
[1:54:34] you talk to them they are filled with
[1:54:37] people's problem
[1:54:38] they know about this one they know about
[1:54:41] this one they know about this one they
[1:54:42] know about this one the last thing they
[1:54:44] can talk to you is about the word of god
[1:54:48] everybody here trees whose fruit are
[1:54:51] water
[1:54:52] you cannot eat that
[1:54:54] without fruit
[1:54:56] twice dead
[1:54:58] naturally and spiritually plucked up by
[1:55:01] the water there is no life into them
[1:55:04] raging waves of the water
[1:55:07] forming out their own water
[1:55:09] and they are wandering water
[1:55:14] so these children
[1:55:16] are wandering stars
[1:55:19] we have the bright and morning stars we
[1:55:22] have the morning stars we have the sun
[1:55:25] of the morning and now we have wandering
[1:55:28] stars why are they wondering
[1:55:32] because they once had a position
[1:55:36] because they was have a mistake
[1:55:39] but they lost their position
[1:55:41] they lost their god-given position in
[1:55:45] heaven and when they lost their position
[1:55:48] then they become wandering stars
[1:55:51] ever here when you lose your position in
[1:55:54] christ
[1:55:55] you're gonna live a wide life of going
[1:55:59] left and right
[1:56:04] because you lost your given position you
[1:56:06] don't have any position anymore you
[1:56:09] became a problem
[1:56:11] causing traffic on the highway
[1:56:14] to whom is reserve the blackness of
[1:56:17] darkness for water
[1:56:20] so now
[1:56:21] this hell here
[1:56:23] we told you that here is a prison
[1:56:25] it is a place where god took them put
[1:56:28] them into a prison then god would judge
[1:56:31] them at the white throne judgment and
[1:56:34] after the judgment is finished then god
[1:56:36] is going to destroy them
[1:56:38] everybody clear so far
[1:56:39] now this prison here is divided in three
[1:56:43] parts
[1:56:46] stay awake
[1:56:47] put your back a seat
[1:56:49] brother bonham say
[1:56:51] now
[1:56:52] when the first the first place on this
[1:56:55] side
[1:56:56] is the soul of the water
[1:57:00] when a man dies he goes into a place
[1:57:03] waiting for water
[1:57:05] so when someone a son of perdition comes
[1:57:08] from hell get into his mother's womb
[1:57:12] when he's born the day you die like the
[1:57:15] witch young ruler
[1:57:17] ever here
[1:57:18] you're gonna go down to hell
[1:57:20] but when you get down to her
[1:57:23] you're gonna stop right here at the
[1:57:25] first compartment of hell
[1:57:28] this compartment of hell here is called
[1:57:31] the fifth dimension
[1:57:34] it is a dimension
[1:57:36] that holds the souls
[1:57:38] the souls of the unjust
[1:57:42] all the children
[1:57:44] of the devil
[1:57:47] anybody clear so far
[1:57:49] if you're a child of god you're not
[1:57:50] going to go there
[1:57:52] anybody clear
[1:57:53] if you have uh time god listen to souls
[1:57:56] in prison it's a bottomless pit where
[1:57:59] brother branham job and brother branham
[1:58:01] saw people there and before you know it
[1:58:03] because brother branham did not belong
[1:58:05] there they only told him to go there
[1:58:09] okay let me drop this
[1:58:13] when brother if brother branham when
[1:58:15] brother branham received the holy ghost
[1:58:19] brother branham could no longer go down
[1:58:21] to hell
[1:58:26] everybody
[1:58:27] brother branham went to hell when he was
[1:58:30] sinner
[1:58:31] so god allowed him to go there so that
[1:58:34] he can have a vision
[1:58:37] when he's still in sin
[1:58:39] automatically if you pass to death
[1:58:41] you're going to go down to the region of
[1:58:43] the lust so when he have the vision god
[1:58:46] retrieve him back again
[1:58:48] and got him the holy ghost never to go
[1:58:50] back there again a man or a woman that
[1:58:54] is filled with the holy spirit will
[1:58:56] never go to hell because jesus died for
[1:59:00] you and jesus went to hell for you
[1:59:06] everybody so far so when a sinner die
[1:59:10] they go straight to hell they go first
[1:59:12] into that compartment that's why you see
[1:59:15] the star the wandering star stop there
[1:59:18] so here have division
[1:59:20] everybody clear
[1:59:22] brother branham said the next is the
[1:59:24] water
[1:59:25] is the demon which are the angelic being
[1:59:28] that resisted god as well they stay here
[1:59:31] everybody clear so far
[1:59:32] brother bonham said that the next is
[1:59:34] water
[1:59:36] is the devil himself
[1:59:39] so when you enter hell the first place
[1:59:42] you enter it is the soul of the unjust
[1:59:46] that's why when brother branham entered
[1:59:48] he didn't see the devil
[1:59:54] he said
[1:59:55] that's why when brother upon him entered
[1:59:57] he didn't see demons
[1:59:59] brother branham saw the souls
[2:00:02] and the spirit of the people that died
[2:00:05] under sin
[2:00:07] ever here but if you go further down
[2:00:10] then you get into the realm of the demon
[2:00:13] and if you go way down there then you're
[2:00:16] gonna see satan himself
[2:00:19] that is a copy of heaven
[2:00:24] everybody here when you're going down
[2:00:27] you're going into the fifth dimension
[2:00:30] then the region of the angel then the
[2:00:33] devil himself but when you're going up
[2:00:37] you're going in the sixth dimension then
[2:00:40] the holy angel brother branham said on
[2:00:42] the seventh it is god himself
[2:00:48] everybody here so far
[2:00:50] do you still have your seat belt
[2:00:52] everybody clear so far and in heaven the
[2:00:55] bible says that our theophany behold
[2:00:59] what
[2:01:01] the face of the father
[2:01:03] and the theophany of the people in hell
[2:01:07] will also behold the face of lucifer
[2:01:12] who is their father
[2:01:16] we okay so far
[2:01:18] did i lose anybody
[2:01:20] the first now damning there is ghost
[2:01:24] spirit of dead man that never did what
[2:01:28] they are waiting for water
[2:01:30] the only thing they know is water
[2:01:33] and what they did they are staying right
[2:01:35] here
[2:01:36] the demon are right there the devil is
[2:01:39] there so when you die your tea off and
[2:01:42] you will leave right here
[2:01:44] ever here
[2:01:45] and come straight to the hospital
[2:01:48] and pick you up and jump with you back
[2:01:51] to hell
[2:01:52] and if you're a christian your tea off
[2:01:55] and you also come down and wait for you
[2:01:57] on the hospital there and pick you up
[2:02:00] and pick your problem and pull you back
[2:02:01] up depending on your origin
[2:02:07] everybody here so far
[2:02:09] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:02:11] lord this hell that we're talking about
[2:02:15] that is divided into three parts it's a
[2:02:18] horrible place
[2:02:21] very
[2:02:23] horrible
[2:02:24] a horrible place
[2:02:26] anybody care
[2:02:29] hell is horrible
[2:02:30] what is going on
[2:02:32] the bible says in ii peter chapter 2
[2:02:35] verse 4 for if god
[2:02:38] spare not the angels that sin now you
[2:02:41] understand those angels
[2:02:43] but cast them down to water
[2:02:47] and deliver them into chains of water
[2:02:51] so in hell
[2:02:52] we have the chance of darkness
[2:02:57] hell
[2:02:58] have chance of darkness
[2:03:03] everybody clear
[2:03:05] who is in hell
[2:03:08] the angel
[2:03:09] the angelic being the tiopani can you
[2:03:12] put a chain on angel
[2:03:16] can you put a chain on a tiophone
[2:03:19] can you put a chain on the soul
[2:03:21] can you put a chain on the spirit
[2:03:24] can you catch the devil and put a chain
[2:03:26] and say call the police now we got him
[2:03:29] if he was so the devil could be in
[2:03:31] prison in a long time
[2:03:32] ever here the devil is a spirit
[2:03:37] but the bible says when god put them in
[2:03:40] hell he put them in chains
[2:03:44] the chance of what of darkness
[2:03:46] what kind of chain is that
[2:03:49] the bible continue
[2:03:51] reserve for water
[2:03:53] that's why hell is a prison they dare
[2:03:55] reserve for trial
[2:03:58] and spare not the odd word but save noah
[2:04:01] the earth person and preacher of
[2:04:04] righteousness bringing the flood upon
[2:04:06] the world of the water
[2:04:08] so you know who went to hell the ungodly
[2:04:12] notice that in ii peter peter stopped by
[2:04:16] the angel that sin
[2:04:18] reserved to darkness then peter pick up
[2:04:22] water
[2:04:23] sodom and gomorrah
[2:04:25] i want you to notice that
[2:04:27] peter started
[2:04:29] by speaking about the angel that fell
[2:04:32] hell
[2:04:33] then sodom and gomorrah right
[2:04:36] about
[2:04:38] keep that order the angel that sin the
[2:04:41] ungodly people then hell
[2:04:44] chance of darkness then sodom and
[2:04:47] gomorrah
[2:04:50] and turning the cities of sodom and
[2:04:52] gomorrah into water
[2:04:54] condemning them with another troll
[2:04:57] making them a water
[2:05:00] unto those that after
[2:05:03] should leave water
[2:05:05] so what happened to sodom and gomorrah
[2:05:09] is a preview
[2:05:13] it's a type
[2:05:15] it's an example of god of what god is
[2:05:19] gonna do at the end
[2:05:23] you understand
[2:05:25] you go back to the book of jude
[2:05:28] jude says this we were here
[2:05:30] the angel which kept not the first state
[2:05:33] you remember that
[2:05:35] but left their own water
[2:05:38] he had reserved into everlasting water
[2:05:42] peter called that the chance of darkness
[2:05:45] but jude called that the everlasting
[2:05:48] chance
[2:05:53] in other words you put them together
[2:05:56] everlasting chain of darkness
[2:05:59] everybody
[2:06:01] everlasting chain of darkness unto what
[2:06:05] you see that unto the judgment of the
[2:06:08] great day
[2:06:10] so peter started by angel that sin
[2:06:14] put them in hell unto judgment
[2:06:18] and then sodom have gomorrah
[2:06:21] jude started with the angel that sin
[2:06:25] put them into chains
[2:06:27] everlasting chain then look at verse
[2:06:30] seven he picked up water
[2:06:32] why are these two people putting the
[2:06:34] same thing
[2:06:38] everybody here
[2:06:40] hallelujah
[2:06:42] put a you'd say even as sodom and
[2:06:45] gomorrah remember we start with sodom
[2:06:48] and gomorrah in 19
[2:06:49] out sodom and gomorrah and the cities
[2:06:52] above them in like manner giving
[2:06:55] themselves over to water
[2:06:57] and going after water
[2:07:00] which means homosexuality
[2:07:03] ever care are set forth as a water
[2:07:07] so who is gonna be destroyed into the
[2:07:10] lake of fire
[2:07:14] ungodly people
[2:07:16] those that live in fornication
[2:07:19] set your relationship before marriages
[2:07:23] those that are homosexual
[2:07:25] set for in the water
[2:07:28] suffering the water
[2:07:31] the vengeance of water
[2:07:33] so jude is saying what happened in sodom
[2:07:36] and gomorrah because jude first started
[2:07:38] with israel leaving egypt then he left
[2:07:42] that and he went back to the origin and
[2:07:45] said look where they started from they
[2:07:47] start from heaven now not only did they
[2:07:50] start from heaven and they lost their
[2:07:52] position but they're gonna be destroyed
[2:07:54] because what happened in sodom in
[2:07:57] gomorrah and the cities around the back
[2:07:59] is an example of what god will do at the
[2:08:03] end showing his vengeance of eternal
[2:08:07] water
[2:08:10] eternal fire
[2:08:13] everybody here so far
[2:08:15] let me reiterate this
[2:08:17] hell
[2:08:18] is a horrible place
[2:08:21] why is he horrible because hair is a
[2:08:24] prison
[2:08:26] hell is a horrible place why is he
[2:08:29] horrible because in hell you have chance
[2:08:33] of darkness
[2:08:35] and if you go to her you are prepared to
[2:08:38] be destroyed forever
[2:08:41] nobody in hell will be safe again
[2:08:46] everybody understanding
[2:08:48] so angels
[2:08:50] sheds of darkness sodom and gomorrah
[2:08:53] angels chance of darkness sodom and
[2:08:56] gomorrah solomon gomorrah as an example
[2:09:00] sodom and gomorrah as an example
[2:09:02] everybody here so far
[2:09:04] we keep climbing
[2:09:06] hell
[2:09:07] not only is it a horrible place
[2:09:10] hallelujah
[2:09:11] but hell is a place of disorder
[2:09:16] amen here
[2:09:19] everyone that went to hell had a
[2:09:22] position originally in heaven
[2:09:27] you follow me
[2:09:28] when they lost their god-given position
[2:09:32] they didn't have any more position
[2:09:35] anymore
[2:09:36] so when they put them together nobody
[2:09:39] knows their position
[2:09:45] he became a place of disorder
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:52] hallelujah
[2:09:53] before i go job chapter 10
[2:09:57] before i go once that shall not return
[2:10:01] even to the land of water
[2:10:03] you understand now
[2:10:05] darkness and the shadow of water
[2:10:07] everybody clear so far a land of
[2:10:10] darkness
[2:10:11] as water
[2:10:13] because it's the chance of darkness
[2:10:16] ever here
[2:10:18] and of the shadow of water
[2:10:20] without water
[2:10:22] and where the light is as water
[2:10:25] there is no light at all in here
[2:10:29] anybody care
[2:10:31] hell is a place of disorder
[2:10:36] but god is not a god of disorder
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:42] bible said god is not the author of
[2:10:44] water
[2:10:46] in hell it is confusing
[2:10:50] everybody
[2:10:51] god is not the author of confusion but
[2:10:54] of what
[2:10:56] as in all churches of the water
[2:10:59] so if you see confusion in the church
[2:11:03] just recognize that hell have already
[2:11:06] entered the church
[2:11:10] ever care so far
[2:11:12] let all things be done how
[2:11:15] and what
[2:11:17] make sure you keep your order in the
[2:11:20] church
[2:11:22] if you are a strong leader keep your
[2:11:24] order in the church as a song leader
[2:11:27] if you are a musician keep your order in
[2:11:30] the church as a musician
[2:11:32] if you are a trustee keep your order as
[2:11:35] a trustee if you deacon stay in your
[2:11:39] position
[2:11:40] because god is not the author of
[2:11:43] confusion
[2:11:44] daddy stay on your position mama stay on
[2:11:48] your position children stay on your
[2:11:51] position
[2:11:54] i told you what a father
[2:11:55] responsibilities
[2:11:57] i told you what the wife's
[2:11:59] responsibility is
[2:12:01] when you start crossing those lines
[2:12:03] the devil will see that
[2:12:05] that there is a disorder there and the
[2:12:08] devil will target you and the devil will
[2:12:10] hit in that hot spot there and you're
[2:12:12] going to get in trouble
[2:12:14] i told you what a man should do in
[2:12:16] wedding
[2:12:17] i told you what a man should do in
[2:12:19] marriages i told you the place of a
[2:12:22] woman
[2:12:23] keep the sister in the press
[2:12:26] keep the man in the place
[2:12:28] the more you keep crossing
[2:12:31] you're gonna get in trouble because
[2:12:33] you're now living under permissive will
[2:12:37] which is not the perfect will of god
[2:12:39] [Music]
[2:12:41] brother stephen
[2:12:43] a crowd
[2:12:44] can drop down
[2:12:46] on the sunday so we can pick it up
[2:12:48] that's fine
[2:12:49] don't let that car keep dropping down on
[2:12:52] sunday all the time
[2:12:53] because the devil will notice that
[2:12:56] amen
[2:12:57] you can go into a period of transition
[2:13:00] god grace is there
[2:13:02] and god grace is there but god grace
[2:13:05] don't work like that
[2:13:08] hallelujah
[2:13:10] when god came under luther
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:14] he was god grace for that age
[2:13:18] everybody that was living in that age
[2:13:21] was under the grace of god
[2:13:24] then grace moved to sanctification grace
[2:13:27] never stopping justification grace moved
[2:13:31] into sanctification and the one who
[2:13:34] stayed in justification the devil came
[2:13:38] and killed all of them
[2:13:42] do you follow me
[2:13:43] so make sure you stay on your position
[2:13:48] if you don't stay on your position
[2:13:50] longer the devil will see through that
[2:13:53] that this house is not in order amen
[2:13:56] god is the god of order
[2:14:02] hallelujah
[2:14:04] hallelujah
[2:14:06] blessed be the name of the lord the
[2:14:08] bible say in genesis 22 that abraham
[2:14:12] built an author there and laid the wood
[2:14:15] in water
[2:14:17] in exodus chapter 29 when they were
[2:14:20] putting the candlestick the pure
[2:14:22] candlestick
[2:14:23] with the lamp thereof
[2:14:25] even with the lamp to be set in water
[2:14:29] exodus floating and do that shall bring

[2:23:03] are you there
[2:23:04] i'm going to come back there
[2:23:08] what is going on
[2:23:10] when he saw jesus he cried out and fell
[2:23:14] down before him and with a loud voice
[2:23:16] saying whatever to do with jesus that
[2:23:20] son of water
[2:23:22] i beseech the water
[2:23:25] did he say burn me
[2:23:29] for
[2:23:30] he commanded the unclean spirit to come
[2:23:33] out of the man
[2:23:34] for often time he had cut him
[2:23:38] and have kept bond with him and he was
[2:23:41] kept bound with chains that's natural
[2:23:43] man and feathers and he broke the banks
[2:23:47] and was driven off the devil into water
[2:23:51] why is the devil warning the wilderness
[2:23:54] can i get this out
[2:23:57] we found out here
[2:23:59] that as we spoke as as we speaking about
[2:24:01] the condition of hell
[2:24:03] hell is a horrible place and we found
[2:24:06] out that the devil loves
[2:24:08] the love tombs
[2:24:11] or cemetery
[2:24:14] cemetery
[2:24:16] anybody care
[2:24:17] and they also love water
[2:24:20] wilderness
[2:24:21] why
[2:24:25] my people
[2:24:26] suffer for lack of knowledge
[2:24:29] anybody care
[2:24:31] and jesus asked him saying what is that
[2:24:34] name and he said my name is who
[2:24:37] because what
[2:24:39] many devils were entered into him
[2:24:43] this dem this name legion
[2:24:46] is not the name of one devil
[2:24:52] it's a name of many devils
[2:24:54] it's be 8 000 something
[2:24:57] grouped together but they are in unity
[2:25:04] when they ask them
[2:25:06] demon one didn't say my name is so so my
[2:25:09] name is so jesus would have started
[2:25:10] there and everybody presenting
[2:25:12] themselves one by one one by one but
[2:25:14] they were cluttered together as a unity
[2:25:19] they didn't say that's not my problem
[2:25:21] that's his problem
[2:25:23] you touch my brother you touch me
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:27] demon learn that
[2:25:30] that's what they were trying to do in
[2:25:32] the tower of babel
[2:25:34] they're trying to put everything because
[2:25:36] they'll learn the power of unity
[2:25:42] the children of god don't learn that
[2:25:44] selfish
[2:25:46] everybody clear
[2:25:48] 31 and they besought him who's besotting
[2:25:53] jesus
[2:25:54] who's begging jesus
[2:25:56] what are they begging jesus for
[2:25:58] they besought him
[2:26:00] that he will not command them to go out
[2:26:04] into the water
[2:26:11] hell is a horrible place
[2:26:13] [Music]
[2:26:15] hell is a place of chance of darkness
[2:26:18] hell is a place that is not fitted to
[2:26:22] live
[2:26:24] hell is an uncomfortable place for even
[2:26:28] devils
[2:26:29] devils are begging jesus christ don't
[2:26:33] please let us go out but not back again
[2:26:36] dead
[2:26:40] why do you want to go to hell
[2:26:42] and you saying people to hell
[2:26:46] go to hell
[2:26:48] do you know what hell means
[2:26:52] do you know what hell means
[2:26:54] and you want to send people to hell
[2:26:58] the devil themselves don't want to go
[2:27:01] there and they are begging jesus they
[2:27:04] say please jesus cast us the way we
[2:27:07] understand but don't go we don't want to
[2:27:09] go back there
[2:27:14] and the rich young ruler said send
[2:27:16] somebody there tell them don't come here
[2:27:21] hallelujah
[2:27:23] and there was there a herd of son
[2:27:26] feeding on the mountain and they
[2:27:28] besought him that he would suffer them
[2:27:30] to enter there let us go into the pig it
[2:27:33] is better but we can't go to hell
[2:27:36] because here is an unfitted place for
[2:27:38] anyone including the devil and his
[2:27:41] angels
[2:27:44] and jesus went to hell because of you
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:53] the one who never seen
[2:27:55] the one who never done anything wrong
[2:27:57] the one who was perfect accepted to go
[2:28:01] into this place so that you can become
[2:28:04] the righteousness of god
[2:28:07] why you don't want to serve him
[2:28:11] why you don't want to serve god
[2:28:14] why when it comes to the things of god
[2:28:16] you always have an excuse
[2:28:19] why you want to be the last one to be in
[2:28:21] church
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:32] now we found out
[2:28:34] that the devil preferred to enter a
[2:28:37] beast
[2:28:38] they were into a person and they drove
[2:28:40] that person into the tomb
[2:28:43] but the tomb
[2:28:44] the bible tells us that when the rich
[2:28:46] young muller died his soul went into
[2:28:50] water
[2:28:51] there's nobody in the tomb it's the
[2:28:53] bodies
[2:28:55] what happened
[2:28:57] everybody
[2:28:59] anybody here
[2:29:01] god was omnipresent
[2:29:04] he was omnipotent
[2:29:07] he's the god that knew everything
[2:29:10] anybody care when god immortal himself
[2:29:14] into the pillar of fire
[2:29:17] the first thing god began to create
[2:29:19] brother kelly was the zodiac
[2:29:24] you follow me
[2:29:26] god
[2:29:27] created the heaven
[2:29:32] genesis 1
[2:29:33] 1
[2:29:34] the first thing god created as a creator
[2:29:39] was the heaven
[2:29:43] everybody so far
[2:29:46] brother branham said we are creators
[2:29:53] the first thing god created
[2:29:56] god have to create an atmosphere
[2:30:04] and from that atmosphere god begin to
[2:30:07] work yes
[2:30:08] hey
[2:30:10] and as creature of god
[2:30:13] the first thing we usually create is an
[2:30:16] atmosphere around us
[2:30:21] do you follow me
[2:30:23] do you follow me
[2:30:24] do you follow me
[2:30:26] hell is unfitted for the devil
[2:30:30] you follow me but we create atmosphere
[2:30:36] anybody here
[2:30:38] when people go to the womb to the
[2:30:41] cemetery
[2:30:43] or when people go
[2:30:45] to the grave
[2:30:47] everybody that goes there is sad
[2:30:53] do you follow me
[2:30:55] you might you follow me
[2:30:57] when we go to the cemetery we are sad
[2:31:02] somebody is crying
[2:31:04] somebody is in sorrow
[2:31:06] somebody is in tears
[2:31:08] somebody's in pain that's why they're
[2:31:11] going to the cemetery because they lost
[2:31:14] a loved one
[2:31:16] and this is the last time they're gonna
[2:31:18] see their body and they're gonna be
[2:31:20] separated forever from the one that they
[2:31:22] love
[2:31:23] for the child that they love for the
[2:31:25] husband that they love for the father
[2:31:28] that they love for the mother that they
[2:31:29] love
[2:31:30] everybody
[2:31:32] and that atmosphere
[2:31:34] that we go with it in the cemetery
[2:31:37] is what makes the cemetery a gloomy
[2:31:41] place
[2:31:45] do you follow me
[2:31:46] do you follow me
[2:31:48] the one who died is not dead
[2:31:51] that person is already either in hell
[2:31:55] are they in heaven
[2:31:57] but with a living are creating an
[2:32:00] atmosphere in the cemetery of the things
[2:32:04] we're bringing into a cemetery
[2:32:10] do you follow me
[2:32:11] then the cemetery become a place of
[2:32:14] sorrow
[2:32:16] the cemetery become a place that is
[2:32:19] gloomy
[2:32:20] the cemetery become a place that always
[2:32:24] remember us of a bad memories
[2:32:29] do you follow me
[2:32:32] if we on summer
[2:32:35] and the temperature is 105 outside
[2:32:39] the sun is bright
[2:32:41] who want to stay outside
[2:32:44] who want to stay outside
[2:32:47] who want to get into the house where
[2:32:49] there is ignore conditioning
[2:32:52] and when you get into the house where
[2:32:54] there is an air conditioning in that day
[2:32:56] do you want to go out
[2:32:59] hell
[2:33:00] is 105 degrees
[2:33:06] did you hear that
[2:33:08] did you hear that i'm just paraphrasing
[2:33:10] so when the devil leaves hell
[2:33:13] ever clear
[2:33:15] everybody
[2:33:16] they are looking for a place where there
[2:33:19] is no conditioning
[2:33:23] do you follow me
[2:33:25] do you follow me
[2:33:27] then those prayers must be gloomy
[2:33:31] must be sorrowful
[2:33:32] that's why the devil hang into the
[2:33:36] cemetery because he keep them warm
[2:33:43] do you follow me
[2:33:45] do you follow me
[2:33:46] do you follow me and when you in your
[2:33:49] home
[2:33:52] you follow me
[2:33:53] you begin to live a certain kind of life
[2:33:58] everybody
[2:34:00] fasting all the time
[2:34:02] pulling all the time
[2:34:04] gossiping all the time talking all the
[2:34:08] time
[2:34:09] left and righting disorder you begin to
[2:34:12] create and now conditioning for the
[2:34:14] devil
[2:34:21] brother branham say the atmosphere you
[2:34:24] create either attract
[2:34:26] or it's gonna repost something
[2:34:29] are you there
[2:34:30] when your home is always depression
[2:34:34] in your home is always sadness it's
[2:34:37] always fasting it's always yelling it's
[2:34:40] always talking about somebody your home
[2:34:43] become an air conditioning for devils
[2:34:49] before you know it
[2:34:50] if somebody is out of hell
[2:34:52] they're looking for a place where there
[2:34:54] is a sea
[2:34:56] and you the one providing them ac
[2:34:58] and when they get there they begin to
[2:35:01] they don't want to go they prefer to
[2:35:03] stay there rather than going back in
[2:35:06] hell
[2:35:08] everybody clear
[2:35:09] anybody clear
[2:35:10] about here then the little first that
[2:35:13] started
[2:35:16] you entered there
[2:35:18] where is makaki
[2:35:21] i don't know
[2:35:23] then the devil goes
[2:35:25] let her talk to you like that
[2:35:28] don't ever talk to me like that
[2:35:31] then the devil goes back
[2:35:34] tell him you are not a christian
[2:35:37] are you really a christian then the same
[2:35:39] devil goes back up
[2:35:41] tell him that
[2:35:43] if you let her go like this she's not
[2:35:45] going to listen to you
[2:35:47] whisper go ahead and tell him that you
[2:35:49] are the head and don't play with you

[2:35:57] say tell him also you are not a dormant
[2:35:59] i'm not going nowhere

[2:36:04] the devil turn around
[2:36:06] everybody here
[2:36:07] before you know it
[2:36:10] before you know it
[2:36:13] an atmosphere begin to get created

[2:36:33] in your own house
[2:36:37] can i continue
[2:36:39] can i continue
[2:36:41] if you notice the devil don't want to
[2:36:44] stay in hell
[2:36:45] they want to come out
[2:36:47] you're going to feel like if you are
[2:36:49] arguing in the bedroom
[2:36:51] the first thing you do you want to come
[2:36:53] out of the bedroom
[2:36:56] the reason why you coming out of the
[2:36:58] bedroom because you already contaminated
[2:37:00] the atmosphere
[2:37:01] so just like the devil wanna flee you

[2:41:14] conditioning of devils

[2:41:50] go there that's what jesus said when an
[2:41:52] unclean spirit come out
[2:41:54] he goes into the what wilderness and
[2:41:56] brother branham said the wilderness
[2:41:58] never existed before
[2:42:01] it was sin
[2:42:02] that caused the wilderness that's why in
[2:42:04] the millennium the wilderness will do
[2:42:06] water
[2:42:08] it will blossom again they have to
[2:42:09] remove that curse so they want to go in
[2:42:12] cursed places
[2:42:17] hallelujah do you think brother branham
[2:42:19] was going to the mountain to pray for
[2:42:21] nothing he was getting away from the
[2:42:23] cities because devil's embargo and boy a
[2:42:26] nightclub are they he goes out to in the
[2:42:29] wood when the atmosphere is clear
[2:42:31] then the sooner he starts praying he's
[2:42:33] in contact with god
[2:42:38] that's why brother bonham said he loved
[2:42:39] to pray early in the morning he said
[2:42:42] because the night clever closed he said
[2:42:44] the activity of the devil are slowing
[2:42:47] down
[2:42:49] [Music]
[2:42:50] when they turn the nightclub on they're
[2:42:52] giving them air conditioning they're
[2:42:54] more happy dead than in hell
[2:42:57] [Music]

[2:43:11] your life by the things that you do and
[2:43:13] the things that you talk
[2:43:15] about

[2:44:59] darkness approach the devil through the
[2:45:01] cemetery because the atmosphere is
[2:45:03] already created there they can connect
[2:45:06] quickly with the fifth dimension

[2:47:03] human have that much love you think that
[2:47:05] the loving father brother branham the
[2:47:07] loving father would destroy his children
[2:47:10] but i'm saying i say never
[2:47:12] he don't destroy his children but whose
[2:47:15] child are you
[2:47:18] original
[2:47:20] god
[2:47:21] don't destroy his
[2:47:23] he's trying the best to get them
[2:47:27] but it's there

[2:47:32] so god just permits satan
[2:47:35] [Music]
[2:47:36] hell is burning
[2:47:38] mark nine jesus said if their hands are
[2:47:42] fendi cut it off
[2:47:45] it is better for them to enter into life
[2:47:48] name
[2:47:49] than having two hands to go into water
[2:47:53] because of that skirt you find yourself
[2:47:56] in hell because of one shoe you're gonna
[2:47:59] find yourself in hell
[2:48:02] a shoe purchased in walmart
[2:48:05] into the fire that never shall be water
[2:48:10] hallelujah
[2:48:12] hallelujah
[2:48:14] okay i'm going to live this so you think
[2:48:16] over
[2:48:16] the week
[2:48:18] jesus said there is a fire in hell that
[2:48:21] burn
[2:48:22] brother branham just say there you
[2:48:24] believe in a burning hell
[2:48:26] right
[2:48:28] get this and
[2:48:30] we get the answer later
[2:48:32] brother bottom say
[2:48:35] the judgment is not now
[2:48:39] because the people are in hell in prison
[2:48:42] and there is no burning hell now
[2:48:49] you see now
[2:48:50] you see now
[2:48:51] that's why the message having a lot of
[2:48:52] complications
[2:48:54] that's why you have a lot of
[2:48:56] contradiction
[2:49:00] he said here he said here he change you
[2:49:02] see
[2:49:05] you see
[2:49:07] somebody tells you the guy is in the
[2:49:10] water
[2:49:11] burning hair now that is what
[2:49:16] ouch
[2:49:20] a judge of this earth
[2:49:22] is just enough to never condemn a man
[2:49:26] until he's brought to what
[2:49:28] and god will never throw a man into a
[2:49:31] fiery furnace until he's first he is
[2:49:35] condemned by god's own laws
[2:49:38] he rejected mercy so you see he first
[2:49:41] has to have the water
[2:49:43] and the trial is the
[2:49:46] white throne
[2:49:47] but now he's in a place called water
[2:49:51] how did jesus say burning hell and
[2:49:53] brother branham say no
[2:49:56] ponder on that
[2:49:58] let's stand
[2:50:13] jesus is right
[2:50:16] brother branham is right
[2:50:18] keep that in mind when you're pondering
[2:50:21] just keep that in mind that jesus is
[2:50:23] right and brother branham is right
[2:50:26] you just need to be put together
[2:50:30] amen
[2:50:31] i thought i'm gonna finish the lake of
[2:50:33] fire and get into the resurrection for
[2:50:36] the second death but we got to pick it
[2:50:38] up
[2:50:38] remember church
[2:50:40] hell
[2:50:41] is a horrible place
[2:50:43] hell
[2:50:44] is a bad place
[2:50:46] hell
[2:50:47] is a place of disorder
[2:50:50] your life needs to be put in order
[2:50:53] your home needs to be put in order
[2:50:55] this church need to continue to resume
[2:50:58] back in order because we're no longer in
[2:51:00] a hotel
[2:51:05] your home is not hell
[2:51:08] it is a property that god gave you
[2:51:12] but you can make hell yourself
[2:51:15] or you can make it heaven
[2:51:16] because you are a creator
[2:51:19] let's pray heavenly father
[2:51:24] lord once again we are approaching you
[2:51:26] humbly
[2:51:28] father this
[2:51:30] afternoon thanking you
[2:51:33] first for unfolding these things
[2:51:36] that have bonded your children
[2:51:39] for years
[2:51:41] until they don't understand
[2:51:44] how things get out of order at home
[2:51:47] [Music]
[2:51:49] father we open our television
[2:51:53] and we can't censor what is coming out
[2:51:55] of it
[2:51:57] we open our for now
[2:52:00] and we even give it to our children
[2:52:03] not watching what is coming out of it
[2:52:07] not even understanding that those input
[2:52:11] are coming in from the media because
[2:52:14] hell
[2:52:16] is on earth
[2:52:18] and they want to create an atmosphere
[2:52:20] where they can stay here
[2:52:22] and not go back to the place which where
[2:52:24] they were
[2:52:26] no wonder the media are taking coffee
[2:52:30] and have pumping coffee in the head of
[2:52:33] the people
[2:52:35] to create fear all the time
[2:52:38] so that the atmosphere will be created
[2:52:41] is an atmosphere of fear
[2:52:44] when perfect love casts out all things
[2:52:48] father we are not saying that the
[2:52:50] disease is not there
[2:52:52] the disease is there
[2:52:54] but father we should be more exalting
[2:52:57] you
[2:52:59] who is the author
[2:53:01] and the jehovah rapha
[2:53:03] who can heal
[2:53:04] versus lord how dangerous the disease is
[2:53:08] until the people mind our grasp into
[2:53:11] fear
[2:53:12] and your prophet even told us that when
[2:53:14] they get into that state the people will
[2:53:17] begin to see hallucination
[2:53:19] and see big things coming out of hell
[2:53:22] and we have all this movie harry potter
[2:53:25] all those kind of stuff
[2:53:27] coming back bringing creature that human
[2:53:30] mind cannot even comprehend
[2:53:33] how a human being can put up a movie
[2:53:35] with creatures like that
[2:53:39] and all those are to create gloomy scary
[2:53:42] spooky
[2:53:43] atmosphere bring those atmosphere home
[2:53:47] so that the devil can enter
[2:53:49] and begin to operate in the life of your
[2:53:52] children
[2:53:53] but father you also unveil unto us our
[2:53:56] origin
[2:53:57] and that we are little girls
[2:54:00] we are also ludo masayat and we are also
[2:54:03] creators
[2:54:04] people that can create
[2:54:06] their own atmosphere and live on
[2:54:10] until when we contact someone
[2:54:12] they're gonna look at us
