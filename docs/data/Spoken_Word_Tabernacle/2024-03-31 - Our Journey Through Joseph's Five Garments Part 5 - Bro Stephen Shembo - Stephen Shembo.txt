Bible two chapters a day brother Mickey we having our Cod Church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the Seal's adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen Lord's willing on April the 20th that's our young sisters meeting and then on April the 27th it's confirm 27 this is when we have our question and answer now it's sealed it's confirmed amen so young sisters April 20th so you know where we need to meet amen and brother abble don't see him here this morning I'm still waiting for the young man meeting uh last Sunday I mentioned something uh before I pray for our younger sister Joel I say I remember caring you and then when I went home it looks like the spirit of the Lord brought that back to me and I say wait a minute I didn't care car here he was my wife and my daughter because my daughter wanted to be the first one since it's a girl she say she's going to be the first one to carry her and then I check my uh picture I don't see any picture I say you know what I need to correct that one so I was not the that was not the second time that was only the first time so I was the first time to carry her in church so I wanted to correct that on Wednesday I say no it was spoken on Sunday I have to wait on Sunday it was spoken from the pulpit that's where we corrected from the pulpit so I hope you're getting some good training amen amen glory to God so want to make sure every dot is put in the right place we don't want to stand before the King and then we have something that is taken up I don't want to be there I want to cross straight and go to heaven without any problem so my apology just want to make sure that is all cleared up let's go to our scripture this morning in Genesis chapter 49 that's why it's good to have the Holy Ghost brother Bram say he's a witness we can remind you of these things amen the only one who cannot repent is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God Genesis chapter 49 I send you a quote on the church group chat about Easter so you got a beautiful quote somebody even send me the same quote I sent to them so happy Easter to each one of you because sometime after service some are quick to go and things I don't even have some time to shake your hands so if you here God richly bless you and happy Easter Genesis chapter 49 if you dare you can say amen amen Genesis 4922 I will try to see how we can SAR with this because we r in the middle of a deep series and let's see how the holy spirit will lead us I'm glad this sounds system is better amen I told you your days were numbered Genesis 49 I was in Genesis 37 Genesis 4922 the Bible says Joseph this is Jacob before he dies he call his children and begin to bless them each one of them so since we're dealing with Joseph we're going to go straight to Joseph and we're not going to touch any one of the patriarch 22 he said Joseph is a fruitful Bo so this boy is prospering amen even a fruitful Bow by the well so there is no way Joseph can dry up you might be seated he's a fruitful ball fruitful ball where by the well you remember River uh a tree planted by the rivers amen amen always green J no matter what you do he have a supply amen he's planted by the well there is water there for him the Bible says that Joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful bow buy a well whose branches run over the wall so it seems like this well has a wall he has a protection he has some limits but Joseph can clam above the wall amen so if you put Joseph his Blessing will escalate the blessing of Joseph clams above the wall above the wall am so it's not limit it's not limited to one spot it's a blessing that spreads amen I want you to understand that good it's a blessing that can spread so if you sit closer to Joseph amen what's going to happen to you amen amen we showed you Joseph as Christ we showed you Joseph as brother brandham now we are showing you Joseph as you I showed you Joseph like brother Bram I showed you Joseph like Jesus Christ now I'm showing you Joseph like you amen because it's Joseph Journey our journey through Joseph garment but Joseph is somebody that his Blessing doesn't stop on him if he's somewhere his Blessing spread amen glory to God amen amen amen the Archer verse 23 has sorely grieved him you know what it means now and shut at him and hated him so you know who are those archers his brothers EXA right they sh in him they hated him they sorely amen grieved him not just grieving sorely this was really painful amen amen and they shed him and headed him you know what happened verse 24 but his b a bad in strength amen so despite the atrocity the crime commit against him yes the boy still stand because he's planted by well amen amen amen his bow AB abow in strength and the arms of his hand were made Strong by the hands of who the Mighty God of Jacob so somebody was supporting or sustaining Joseph he was not alone in the hatred he was not alone when he was shed he was not alone when he was sely grieved he was not alone God was there amen and the Bible say from there is the shepherd the stone of Israel the Shepherd in Joseph we know Judah is the king but the Shepherd in Joseph and the stone of Israel in Joseph in Joseph glory amen amen I'm reading the scripture is my Bible different than yours thank you the stone the stone of Israel amen and the shepherd is coming out of there am but the king is Judah remember he hold the birthright amen he was not Ruben we clear now amen verse 25 even by the god of your father who shall help you and by the almighty who shall bless you with the blessings of the heaven above blessings of the deep that lies under blessings of not blessing but blessings amen amen blessings of the heaven belongs to Joseph blessings of the deep that lies under belong to Joseph amen blessings of the breast amen belong to Joseph and of the womb belong to Joseph what kind of blessing is this boy getting either you a Joseph or you not Joseph but whoever is Joseph these are your blessings amen we got blessings of the heaven go ahead my brother what is the next one blessings of the deep of the deep and blessing of what the breasts of the breast how many breast plural or singular plural plural it's sh amen bless bling of el Shai the one that gives strength because El Shai is the god that have breast amen not one two of them amenu when you so tired warn up Hallelujah under the trial then Shai give you more strength amen he can nurture you like Abraham amen and renew your strength Like an Eagle until you look like younger amen they say how do you look longer amen after everything you going through yes of course I still look younger go ahead my brother which which one is the blessing of what the blessing of the womb the blessings of the heaven of the deep of the breast of the womb all of that belong to this boy amen not Judah not ruin not L Joseph what's wrong with this boy amen amen so if if this is your package what do you expect the devil to do with you what do you expect people to do the whole world to love you sir sir with this kind of stuff no sir people don't have children you have children every year people are suffering you got the blessing of the deep you got the blessing of Heaven everything that you do keep prospering you even want the devil to Love You Verse 26 the blessings the blessings of who thy father of your father I will try my best I know it's Easter I will try my best the blessing of your father that father is Jacob because Jacob the father of Joseph the blessing of Jacob the blessing of Israel the blessings plural of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors progenitors means parent so Jo Jacob is saying the blessing that I have is higher than the blessing of my parents please can you verify your Bible is my Bible different no Chief is my Bible different than yours sir okay praise God the blessing of Jacob Jacob is saying that his Blessing is greater than his parent is greater than the blessing of Isaac have I said something wrong it is greater than The Blessing of Abraham because he didn't say progenitor one then he will be only Isaac he say progenitors plural and we know that Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat who Jacob and Jacob say he's blessed are greater than Isaac and Abraham if you would can we look at The Blessing of Abraham are we together amen are we together amen because Abraham God told him leave your country leave your family go to the land that I shall show you and I will bless you I will bless I will multiply you amen like the star of the heavens amen like the dust that is on on the seashore but Jacob blessing is greater than [Music] that at the opening of The Seven SE who blessed Abraham God God himself blessed him but let me show you something about Abraham in Genesis 14 the one on the computer say t my friend in Genesis 14 verse 18 the Bible says and who MC his lineage is not about among human beings melis the king of what of Salem Jerusalem brought forth bread and what wine you know what it means and he was Priest of what the most high God and he blessed him and say Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and water so Abraham was blessed by MC amen Jacob was blessed by Isaac but the one who blessed Abraham who laid the hand on Abraham is MC without beginning of day without ending of Life the one who possess Heaven and Earth bless Abraham but the blessing of Jacob is greater than Abraham what kind of blessing is it stretch yourself my friend the Bible says in Genesis 24 that and he said this is elas I am Abraham's servant and the Lord has blessed my master how greatly I did this to save you time so you don't flip back and forth to M Master greatly and he's become how great and he has given him what flocks and what and herds and what and silver and what and gold and what and Men servants and and Maid servants and what and camels and what and asses but Jacob blessing is greater than that wow so Abraham blessed spiritually naturally financially every aspect Abraham is blessed by who MC but the blessing of Jacob is greater than The Blessing of Abraham let's see the blessing of Isaac we clear Genesis 26:12 then Isaac sold in that land and receiving the same year what 100 fold no loss no loss if if he sow $100 he receive $100 no loss what a blessing where you get into a business no loss you don't lose anything that's Isaac 100% And The Lord did what blessed him and the man Works how great and went what forward and grew until he became very great and for he had possession of what of flock a possession of what of hers and a great store of water servants and the Philistine envy him amen they can't stand his Blessing stand his Blessing too much too much everywhere he's blessed the Philistine can stand and they say no no no no this is too much get out of our land out but the blessing of Jacob is greater than this and greater than Abraham let's go back to our scripture reading now amen amen amen amen let me me show you something about Jacob also the Bible says in Genesis 30 and it came to pass when rer had borne who Joseph that Jacob say unto unto leban send me away only when Joseph is born return back to the promised land that I may go unto my own place and to my country give me my wives and my children for whom I have what served thee remember he served lemon the and let me go for that knowest my service which I have done unto thee and leban say unto him I pray thee if I have found what favor in thine eyes do what T stay more why do you want Jacob to stay more why he says for I have what learned by experience I learned by what experience experience that the Lord has what bless me for for thy sake lean notice that as long as he keep Jacob everything that he has is getting blessed Amen in other words the blessing of Jacob spread uh-huh that's right amen and the blessing of Joseph also spread amen when you put Joseph somewhere he begin to spread are we together amen you keep Jacob everything goes good you keep about something happened to you you keep Joseph everything good you stay connected to Joseph everything goes good are we together are we together what are you trying to say let's go back where we were verse 26 the blessings plural of who your father Jacob have prevailed above the blessing of who genitors Isaac and Abraham to the utmost Bond of the Everlasting what watch they those blessings that are above Abraham that are above Isaac those blessings they shall be on the head of who no wonder where Joseph is going things are moving around that big blessing that is bigger than Isaac bigger than Abraham and that was in the hand of Jacob he said that package was only kept for one person it's going to go into the hand of Joseph what kind of package does Joseph have amen the blessing of the deep the blessing of the womb the blessing of the breast the blessing of Heaven all of that everything when he's somewhere his Blessing spread if you put him in the wilderness the Wilderness begin to change if your house is in trouble get Joseph let him stay in your house for maybe 2 3 years your house will change amen your marriage will change am everything will Chang amen if you disconnect from him you get in trouble that's right amen amen one in a family you need him you carut him off from the family you in trouble one in a family they put one there you cut them off you in trouble you all will suffer that's right because you didn't understand who God put in your midst you will all suffer because you rejected Moses you're going to stay 40 years until the say Moses come back then he pick you up if you start talking to Moses you say who sent you here to be judges don't worry you will stay 40 years because your deliverance is connected to him amen the package is given to him amen without him no Exodus amen without William Mar Ram no Rapture amen no opening of the seals you not going nowhere without Malachi for without this message you going nowhere you might go through the tribulation but not the Rapture amen amen he say all those blessing upon the head of Joseph amen and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his Brethren that's where that blessing lays all I want you to keep is the level of the blessing of Joseph the caliber the tap the category of his Blessing is not just a simple blessing sir it's a blessing that goes beyond Abraham amen amen amen amen in other word Jo Joseph is above Jacob amen above Isaac and above Abraham amen no wonder he's Perfection am amen his ministry is too high I'm talking about Joseph you amen I'm not pointing you to anybody Joseph you tell somebody beside you Joseph you are you the one I'm talking so don't be when I'm preaching here you thinking about Joseph no I'm preaching to you we clear amen we clear let's go to Deuteronomy 33 glory to God Deuteronomy 33 verse 13 if you thereare you can say amen glory to God Amen this is no longer Jacob blessing his children this is Moses blessing the children of Israel if you go to verse one you will see that it's Moses blessing the tribe and I'm going to go straight again to Joseph verse 13 if you dare you can say amen amen and of Joseph he said blessed of the Lord be his land for the precious things of what for the do and for the deep that catches way do you see the blessing of Joseph and for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon even the moon and for the Chings of an ancient mountains all those minerals that are there that have been cooked over the years and for the precious things of the lasting Hills everything that are there yes and for the precious things verse 16 of the earth and fullness thereof everything and for the Good Will of him that dwelleth in the what the bush remember the one Speaking is Moses he says the one who's dwelling where because he knew when he met God he met God in the burning so he using his experience that I know it's coming from the pillar of fire the one that dwelleth in the bush we clear for the blessing that dwelleth uh the one dwelleth in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of who of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was what separated from his Brethren his glory is like the first Ling of his bulock and his horns

together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose let's go to Genesis 37 so we pick up where we were and we clim Genesis 37 if you there you can say amen amen last Sunday we stop at Doan amen amen where the Caravan came that was the perfect terminal that the airplane have to come and take Joseph all the way to the land of Egypt and you understand what Doan is we look at Doan through Through The Eyes of Joseph and through what happened in the life of Elisha amen amen now Genesis 38 if you thereare you can say Amen as we climing 37 I'm sorry you can say Amen as we claming verse 23 stay tight because I'm going to travel certain Avenue so you need to stay really alert okay 23 and it came to pass when Joseph was come to his breth you want understand

the quot of a slave or what a chis a servant or a servant and the third one is the one that is a prisoner and so forth you know what it is he says and the stripp him out of his coat his coat of many color that was on him the coat is removed right and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it it was not time for him to die yet verse 25 and they sat to eat bread after do somebody wrong you know what it means right they go sit in the restaurant and they eating they just put a brother into a dungeon amen and they're talking about the message of the hour yes brother Bram say brother Bram say you kill a brother you kill a sister and you eating some steak roasting some fire amen amen yeah they are right here look at them with some fire on they put Joseph on a pit amen and they sat down to eat bread and they lift up their eyes and looked and behold a what a company of ishmaelites came from where Gilead with their water camels with water bearing and bomb and M going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said to his Brethren what prophet is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood put your seat belt please come and let us sell him to the ishmaelite and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content in other word they agreed and then they passed by the medanite merchant man and they drew and lift up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the ishmaelite for 20 pieces of silver and they broke Joseph into Egypt stay right there brother BR I'm saying when you look at the scripture superficial yes sir you will come up with a superficial understanding put your seat backed my friend amen amen when I read the scripture I knew something was there but I could not decode what he was there until the Holy Spirit unfolded let's go back now to verse 25 again and they down to eat bread and they lift up their eyes and look and behold what a company of ishmaelites that were coming from what from Gilead they're right there on the board my friend so as we look in here there is a company of ishmaelite this company a is coming from gilan why this description we clear the company is coming from Giller with what they're camels bearing spicers it's coming with camels the second thing that we see there is camel now you start connecting yeah the Wi-Fi is giving you signal Amen brother BR I'm saying animal means power Amen in the scripture we clear see what is in that Camel spicery we have spicery or spices amen mhm come on what else is in that c in bomb we he bomb now we start connecting the Wi-Fi is getting some of you already got Wii connected WiFi connected we going slowly amen we got bomb let's continue and what else my friend somebody's getting wired up did I get your WiFi tun in is your WiFi tun in back there we got your Wi-Fi tune in over there we got your Wi-Fi tune in it's pretty good brother Deon we got a tune in okay praise God I just want to make sure everybody's connected if you got a problem with your computer you call me so I can check and make sure we can uh uh open up the gate bom and the other one is what and what that's it that's it so as they lift up their eyes over there they saw a company of ishmaelite that were passing by and this company carry camels because when any left to go see Rebecca he took camel amen 10 camel amen and upon those camel he put gift uhhuh that he have to offer to his family-in-law amen everybody clear and we found out in this airport called Doan the airplane is coming and our airplane is camels and these camel are carrying specific things amen it's not just C carrying Adams no we know the Adam they carrying spices they carrying bomb and they carrying what so a animal brother Bram says it's a power now what does spice mean to us what do bomb means to us and what as mer means to us so we got three things number one are we together amen number one a we got what we call our spices one number two we got what we call our bomb that's some mathematics number three we got what we call the mer amen what does these things represent since the opening of The Seven seal according to the scripture my friend if you notice on verse 25 26 the Bible say and Judah say to his Brethren what prophet is it that we slay our brother and conceal what his blood so the one who spoke is not ruin the one who spoke is not nathy no it's not Asher it is specific Judah am do you follow me amen do you follow me amen so the one who spoke right here about this Caravan the one who was attracted by the Caravan the one who received the inspiration when the Caravan came is Judah as soon as the Caravan came carrying the spicy Judah spoke Judah the lion are we together amen is your WiFi connected my friend and the Bible says that he says what prophet is it that we slay our brother and conceal his bride verse 27 come and let us what sell him so the idea to sell Joseph came from Judah amen amen everybody okay amen everybody together amen and the one who saw Jesus Christ was Judas and brother Bram said Judas from was from the tribe of Judah Wow have I lost you my friend have I lost you my friend I warn you to put your seat belt he says come and let us sell him to the ishma and let not our hand be upon what him in other word we are not going to kill our brother amen we're going to give him to somebody else to be killed and that's what the Jews did to Jesus Christ amen the Jews never lay hand on Jesus Christ they gave Jesus to the Roman to the Gentile to do the job so when they say they say the Roman but actually he was the Jews amen everybody okay and the Bible say in John 7 verse1 that after these things Jesus walk in what Galilee for he would not walk where in jewy because the Jews sought to what to kill him and brother Bram said the Jews are the people from the tribe of Judah wow that tribe hated Jesus Christ more than anything everybody okay and the idea to sell Jesus Christ came from Judah and the one who sold Jesus Christ was Judas from the tribe of Judas and the one who came up with the idea to sell Joseph was Judah himself so history doesn't change only repeat itself Spirits don't die amen they just repeats amen The Same Spirit that was working in Joseph and now the spirit got on Judah to sell Joseph in prefiguration of Jesus Christ have I lost anyone have I lost anybody sir but we found out that that idea came to sell him but we got three things here that these Cel are carrying they carrying the spices hang tight they carrying the bomb and they're carrying the mirr okay let's start with a spicy what is a spicy my friend in Mark chapter 16 verse one the Bible say and when the Sabbath was what pass Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and who salom and had brought what sweet spices that they might come and do what anoint him remember Jesus Christ was dead so spices are used to anoint a dead body amen Have I Lost somebody in Luke 24 verse1 the Bible say now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto what the SE so somebody was already dead bringing what the spices which they had what prepared and certain other with what and thisen to Malachi 4 this is what brother Bram and then real early I can see Mary the Mother and Mary Magdalene starting up the hill to go up to the what the grave somebody was there they had what some spices and things they wanted to anoint his body and do what put him away so the spices are used to anoint the body or the spices are used for the burier amen everybody together amen everybody together amen if the spices are used for the burial brother Steven how how how about the the bomb according to the bomb remember those camel were coming from what Gad the Bible says in Jeremiah 8:22 that is there no what bomb in Gilead brother brand preach even the message bomb in where Gilead so they B everything in the scripture have a meaning amen is there no bom where in Gilead is there no
