[41:45] things that are to be
[41:49] for what was hidden from the eyes of the

[42:58] heaven leader that God has pride in in
[43:02] God's provided with
[43:06] before I who was dead in sin and
[43:10] trespasses so wretched so wretched and
[43:15] survived

[52:33] you
[52:33] and we came with our family and today we
[52:37] have a special not a visitor but family
[52:40] member
[52:41] my mother-in-law
[52:44] my wife's mother she all the way from
[52:46] Zimbabwe
[52:50] you can wave your hand sister Elizabeth
[52:52] God bless you
[52:54] wonderful
[52:55] that was a good welcome
[52:57] please make it comfortable want you to
[52:59] feel the good Southern Bible hospitality
[53:04] praise be to God
[53:06] amen so if we could stand upon our feet
[53:09] to go straight to the word of God
[53:13] I believe my wife is in the nursery
[53:17] let's read from
[53:18] [Music]
[53:21] I need to change this light
[53:30] this is meant to be Genesis
[53:33] not Galatians
[53:41] all right so Genesis 49 verse 9.
[53:51] the Bible says here
[53:53] Judah is a lion's world
[53:56] from the prayer my son Thou Art gone up
[53:59] he's stooped down he encouraged as a
[54:02] lion and isn't is an old lion who shall
[54:06] Rouse him up
[54:07] the scepter shall shall not depart from
[54:12] Judah nor a law Giver from between his
[54:15] feet
[54:16] until Shiloh come and unto him shall the
[54:20] Gathering of the people be
[54:23] amen you may have your seats for a
[54:26] little uh title we want to talk about
[54:27] Shiloh and the Gathering of his
[54:30] attributes
[54:31] praise be to God
[54:33] praise be to God
[54:35] I believe tonight we I am speaking to
[54:38] the attributes of almighty God
[54:41] the Bible says I have saved your gods
[54:43] and all of you are children of the most
[54:46] time
[54:47] though you shall die like all men though
[54:50] you shall fall like the princes but I
[54:52] have said you are gods so you are the
[54:55] attribute of God
[54:57] and God's attributes are Eternal because
[55:00] God is eternal and his thoughts are
[55:03] Eternal and his attributes are eternal
[55:07] and eternal gods
[55:09] an infinite God can only have infinite
[55:13] attributes
[55:15] praise be to God so when you receive the
[55:18] Holy Ghost you are receiving the
[55:19] quickening power that is quickening the
[55:22] life that already was in shoe and you
[55:25] didn't know about it
[55:27] that's what the prophet teaches as
[55:28] friends amen praise be to God Amen so
[55:31] here in Genesis Jacob was blessing his
[55:34] sons right and and the father he still
[55:37] has the blessing tonight to bless his
[55:40] children amen and if you are a child if
[55:42] you want God to bless you you have to
[55:44] receive your blessings from your father
[55:46] amen you need the blessings from your
[55:48] father you need the blessings from your
[55:50] pastor amen you need the blessings from
[55:52] your from from your mother those are
[55:55] blessings that come through the
[55:57] scriptural Channel amen praise be to God
[56:00] yes sir you have to get the blessing
[56:03] from your father amen if you marry right
[56:05] your father will bless you if you do
[56:07] things right your father will bless you
[56:09] yes sir praise be to God preach the
[56:12] father was given authority to bless you
[56:14] yes sir because the father is the priest
[56:17] the father
[56:19] so he can bless you and he can also
[56:22] curse you that's right if you are a son
[56:25] if you are a daughter yes you want to
[56:26] make sure that you secure your father's
[56:29] blessing amen amen
[56:32] so Jacob was old yes sir but he still
[56:35] had the blessing that's right he was
[56:37] becoming blind because he was older but
[56:40] he still had the blessing yes by the
[56:42] virtue of his office right
[56:45] and he was blessing the children of of
[56:47] his sons and he starts with Reuben yes
[56:51] sir says Reuben you are unstable as the
[56:54] water because you climbed up and took my
[56:57] my wife and you defiled my bed that's
[56:59] right he did what he did but he didn't
[57:02] know that his father was gonna pick it
[57:03] he forgot that his father was a prophet
[57:07] and at the time of receiving the
[57:09] blessing right God remembered and this
[57:13] you are not going to prosper you are
[57:16] going to be unstable like water and the
[57:18] blessing went from from Reuben and it
[57:21] went to Joseph that's right because the
[57:23] the blessing of the firstborn is to come
[57:26] from the person that comes from the
[57:28] mothers whom the first Yes master right
[57:31] so Joseph was the first born yes Rachel
[57:34] that's exactly
[57:36] praise be to God yes sir but Ruben
[57:39] forfeited the blessing right because of
[57:41] his conduct and sometimes you will not
[57:44] lose eternal life but you will lose the
[57:47] blessing that's right because of your
[57:49] contact pray to my brother sometimes you
[57:52] will lose the adoption because of your
[57:54] contact that's it sometimes you use the
[57:56] promotion right because of your contact
[57:58] that's exactly reaction comes through
[58:00] the conduct also amen
[58:04] praise be to God glory to God
[58:09] the prophet says for example under no
[58:11] circumstance must a Believer marry an
[58:13] unbeliever go ahead my brother if you do
[58:15] it the prophet says there will be
[58:17] troubled down the road yes my brother
[58:19] yes there will be troubled down the road
[58:21] yes sir you try it's guaranteed yes
[58:24] trouble down the road yes my brother
[58:28] yes sir yes my brother
[58:31] praise be to God bless
[58:34] so the scepter is a symbol of
[58:37] sovereignty amen it's a symbol of power
[58:40] right it's a symbol of authority right
[58:42] because God is Sovereign you cannot be a
[58:46] king unless you are sovereign
[58:48] if you're not sovereign that's why Jesus
[58:51] Christ is the only true king amen
[58:53] because he is the only one that is
[58:54] Sovereign amen praise be to God Amen so
[58:58] for you to be a king you have to be
[59:00] Sovereign yes my brother
[59:02] amen and Judah was given the stewardship
[59:06] right now stewardship means that you
[59:09] don't own something but you are only
[59:12] keeping it for for a season on behalf of
[59:15] someone right so this scepter belongs to
[59:19] Shiloh Hallelujah that's the true owner
[59:23] of the scepter yes sir but he is saying
[59:25] it shall be with Judah for a meantime
[59:27] until Shiloh comes that's right because
[59:30] Shiloh is the original owner of the serp
[59:34] amen amen
[59:36] [Applause]
[59:43] it was given to Adam for a season that's
[59:46] right but Adam forfeited it by conduct
[59:49] right right Hallelujah right but it
[59:52] could not go back to the devil it went
[59:55] back to God original because he is the
[59:57] original owner of the title yes my
[1:00:01] brother
[1:00:02] so the scepter belongs to Shiloh and who
[1:00:06] is Shiloh Shiloh is Christ
[1:00:09] Shiloh is Christ
[1:00:11] Shiloh is Jesus Christ
[1:00:14] this is the one that is the scepter he
[1:00:17] is the one that is the road of
[1:00:19] righteousness
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:21] praise be to God so he says the scepter
[1:00:24] shall not depart from between your feet
[1:00:27] Now put on your spiritual caps
[1:00:30] to the spiritual caps
[1:00:33] shall not depart from between your feet
[1:00:35] means that it shall not depart from your
[1:00:37] descendants
[1:00:39] because that's it's not it's not gonna
[1:00:41] depart from your loins your descendants
[1:00:44] amen so the kingship belongs to Judah
[1:00:48] that's and his descendants until Shiloh
[1:00:51] comes
[1:00:53] yes sir praise be to God Amen just like
[1:00:57] the church the church was given the
[1:01:00] scepter right at the day of Pentecost
[1:01:02] right because that's remember the church
[1:01:05] does not have power but the church has
[1:01:08] Authority right because the scepter is a
[1:01:11] symbol of authority that's right but the
[1:01:14] king himself he does not have power but
[1:01:17] he has Authority amen you just say God's
[1:01:20] arrest him right God do this the king
[1:01:23] himself may not have the power to fight
[1:01:26] the battle that's right but he has the
[1:01:28] word that commands amen so Judah was
[1:01:31] supposed to keep deception right and I
[1:01:34] want you to know that God takes things
[1:01:36] very seriously yes sir and the church
[1:01:39] was given sacred virtues the church was
[1:01:43] given Authority that's right to be the
[1:01:45] representative of Christ on Earth that's
[1:01:48] right until Shiloh comes amen again the
[1:01:51] second time that's right praise be to
[1:01:54] God
[1:01:57] amen go ahead brother Hallelujah yes sir
[1:02:00] so Judah is a lion's world right a
[1:02:03] lion's world is the son of a lion right
[1:02:06] now in question and answers yes sir now
[1:02:08] I've been going through the question and
[1:02:09] answers from
[1:02:11] 1953 the the first happened to 1965 and
[1:02:16] I've been having a wonderful time there
[1:02:20] are about 26 of them and I have been
[1:02:21] having a wonderful time and I hope all
[1:02:25] of you are up to date with your service
[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:35] praise be to God
[1:02:37] the prophet says yes sir now the
[1:02:40] Gathering will be unto the Lord is Jacob
[1:02:44] in the 49th he said when Shiloh comes
[1:02:47] right and the Gathering will be unto him
[1:02:50] amen there will be no longer from
[1:02:53] between the feet until Shiloh comes
[1:02:55] speaking of Judah right and unto him
[1:02:57] shall the Gathering be amen that's what
[1:03:02] the prophet says yes because people were
[1:03:03] saying
[1:03:04] but the prophet was saying we are not
[1:03:07] going to be God that under a
[1:03:08] denomination no sir we are not going to
[1:03:11] be gathered under a group but we are
[1:03:14] going to be God that and in Christ
[1:03:16] that's exactly because remember there
[1:03:18] was a question that came to the prophets
[1:03:20] yes sir and he said and he said shall we
[1:03:23] come to Tucson
[1:03:25] or shall we be in Jefferson that's right
[1:03:28] and he says you shall not be in
[1:03:30] Jeffersonville or in Tucson but you
[1:03:33] shall be in Christ so people were
[1:03:36] looking for a physical place to gather
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:40] Hallelujah people were looking for a
[1:03:42] physical place to Beach
[1:03:44] but here the prophet he says we shall be
[1:03:47] gathered under the revealed message of
[1:03:49] the earth Amen in other words it's not
[1:03:52] as in a physical Gathering no sir it's a
[1:03:56] spiritual Gathering
[1:03:57] hallelujah amen so when we say we are
[1:04:00] gathering together in heaven we are
[1:04:01] gathering in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:04:04] Jesus because you could be in this
[1:04:06] church right now but your mind is in
[1:04:09] France that's exactly you could be in
[1:04:11] church right now but your mind is in
[1:04:14] Africa Praise You should be in church
[1:04:15] right now but we are gathered in Christ
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] I have seen people who change churches
[1:04:24] eight times a year you will never have a
[1:04:27] Revival right the Revival comes if you
[1:04:30] accept the word by faith amen the
[1:04:33] Revival does not come from changing
[1:04:35] churches and changing pastors
[1:04:38] comes from accepting the word of the
[1:04:41] hour yes my brother
[1:04:43] yes not a place
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:48] just like young people sometimes they go
[1:04:49] from Camp to camp
[1:04:51] preacher 41 one came in January one came
[1:04:55] in separate one came you two will never
[1:04:57] do you any good pray to my brother
[1:04:59] because Christ is not in campus is
[1:05:03] revealed in his own words amen
[1:05:07] Hallelujah yes my brother the attributes
[1:05:10] of Christ yes gather around Shiloh yes
[1:05:14] Shiloh is the Refuge message of the hour
[1:05:16] yes my brother yes sir gloriously to God
[1:05:22] Ephesians 1 verse 9 yes sir having made
[1:05:25] known unto us the midst of his will
[1:05:28] today I'm gonna go slowly and you'll be
[1:05:30] reading the the scriptures in the slides
[1:05:32] according to his good pleasure
[1:05:35] which he has purposed yes himself amen
[1:05:38] he purposed this in himself amen so this
[1:05:43] is all about Christ yes sir
[1:05:45] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:05:49] of times right amen can I pause here for
[1:05:51] a second yes my brother the prophet in
[1:05:54] the message called adoption
[1:05:55] there is a Time code that dispensation
[1:05:58] of the fullness of time it's actually a
[1:06:02] dispensation that is called the fullness
[1:06:04] of time yes sir and he says this is the
[1:06:07] time that we are living in right this
[1:06:10] dispensation is called the dispensation
[1:06:12] of the fullness of time amen so what
[1:06:15] Paul was prophesying in Ephesians 1
[1:06:17] verse 9 is actually fulfilled in our
[1:06:20] days
[1:06:22] yes my brother he says it's called that
[1:06:25] that dispensation of adoption that's
[1:06:27] right because remember nature is
[1:06:30] groaning yes sir it's it's groaning the
[1:06:33] Earth is groaning yes sir it's waiting
[1:06:36] for the manifestations right of the sons
[1:06:38] of God Amen but the sons of God they are
[1:06:41] manifested at the fullness of time
[1:06:43] that's exactly and this fullness of time
[1:06:45] it's a dispensation yes my brother some
[1:06:48] call it the dispensation of the seventh
[1:06:50] seal yes but it's the same thing
[1:06:53] that in the fullness of times
[1:06:56] he may gather together
[1:06:59] in one of things
[1:07:02] in Gastonia in Jeffersonville in Tucson
[1:07:07] in what in Christ
[1:07:10] both which are in heaven yes sir and
[1:07:13] where which are in Earth and even in him
[1:07:16] so everything shall be gathered in
[1:07:20] Christ amen amen hallelujah amen so all
[1:07:24] the ministers they came through the ages
[1:07:27] yes sir they were holding the scepter of
[1:07:29] the word right they were holding the
[1:07:31] church right until Christ comes
[1:07:35] Hallelujah yes sir and at the opening of
[1:07:37] the sales he steps out and he makes his
[1:07:41] claim and he gathers all things together
[1:07:44] in shame amen amen amen
[1:07:50] that's why the seals are such a big deal
[1:07:54] because the cross he is purchasing but
[1:07:58] the sales is coming to claim that's it
[1:08:01] righteous amen what is the point of
[1:08:04] paying for something if you can't claim
[1:08:07] it that's right
[1:08:08] amen flaming is more important than
[1:08:12] purchasing amen
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] Hallelujah
[1:08:17] if you are approved go ahead for for a
[1:08:22] house or for a credit card for a car and
[1:08:25] you don't go and claim it what is the
[1:08:27] use
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:29] but when you go to claim that that's
[1:08:32] when your joy is full amen amen that's
[1:08:36] why the happiest day of every girl yes
[1:08:39] sir it's a wedding
[1:08:41] Hallelujah because that's when the bride
[1:08:43] steps up and claims The Pride the
[1:08:47] bridegroom comes and claims the bride

[1:09:54] that's right it was given to me for sure
[1:09:56] that's right and the word dispensation
[1:09:59] if you look it up in the Greek it's
[1:10:01] actually stewardship
[1:10:05] dispensation is a stewardship which was
[1:10:08] given to power right and in our age it
[1:10:11] was given to William Branham amen

[1:19:49] the scepter amen praise be to God yes
[1:19:52] sir Hallelujah glory to God now the
[1:19:55] prophets you know you know this this
[1:19:56] Vision I'm just gonna lay a background
[1:19:58] here and then we'll get himself into
[1:20:00] some things he said when he was you know
[1:20:02] you know the you know the the vision way
[1:20:04] you know the word came and says this is
[1:20:06] the King's sword yes sir and the prophet
[1:20:08] says I said a king Knights a man with a
[1:20:10] sword
[1:20:11] and the voice says not a king sword but
[1:20:15] the king's words amen now a sword is a
[1:20:18] Sceptile that's right praise be to God
[1:20:21] so so Judah was given the scepter of
[1:20:25] authority amen but remember we have
[1:20:28] received a kingship that is greater than
[1:20:30] Judah amen because remember the Gentiles
[1:20:33] the Jews are servants but the Gentiles
[1:20:37] are Kings right that's why God has given
[1:20:40] us the word amen and the prophet says in
[1:20:42] the church age book that God gave us a
[1:20:45] kingdom amen and it's not a natural
[1:20:47] Kingdom it's a spiritual Kingdom amen
[1:20:50] where we are reigning in righteousness
[1:20:53] praise me to God it's not a natural
[1:20:56] Kingdom of building you know the houses
[1:20:59] on a hill and and you know you know
[1:21:02] people these days you know they kind of
[1:21:04] mind
[1:21:05] they think the kingdom is you know
[1:21:06] having 100 cars and things like that
[1:21:08] says it's a spiritual Kingdom amen it
[1:21:11] was one thing you cannot do you cannot
[1:21:13] dislocate the world that's a you cannot
[1:21:15] miss ill allocate the words you cannot
[1:21:18] take the dispensation of Solomon in the
[1:21:21] natural and try to put it in it in the
[1:21:24] Gentiles in the natural ah
[1:21:27] that's right that's why people end up
[1:21:29] having many wives because they are
[1:21:31] dislocating
[1:21:32] they want to take them the message of
[1:21:35] Moses and they want to place it in our
[1:21:38] days no it doesn't work no no we have to
[1:21:42] believe the word of your days amen and
[1:21:44] said by the word of your days amen
[1:21:46] that's why people are drinking that's
[1:21:49] right because they want to take the Old
[1:21:50] Testament and transport it here to the
[1:21:53] YouTube
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:56] you have to take the weight of your
[1:21:58] house amen amen now the prophet says now
[1:22:02] if you are a son in the door of God yes
[1:22:04] my brother then you were in court at the
[1:22:07] beginning that's right you are his
[1:22:09] attribute amen if he wasn't there then
[1:22:12] she was never once or never will be
[1:22:14] that's it that's it you can only be
[1:22:17] there if you were there amen praise be
[1:22:20] to God that's what the prophet is saying
[1:22:22] amen so we are the attributes of God yes
[1:22:25] my brother because what we call the
[1:22:28] Bible right
[1:22:29] is The Book of Life amen it's the life
[1:22:32] of Joseph amen the life of Jeremiah amen
[1:22:36] the life of David amen the life of Iraq
[1:22:39] amen the life of Abraham amen that is
[1:22:41] what is called the Bible amen and the
[1:22:44] Bible is the word of God Amen and it's
[1:22:46] the logos amen so the logos itself it's
[1:22:50] actually a many men but God that's right
[1:22:52] Hallelujah that's right so the life of
[1:22:55] people is the word of God
[1:22:58] people are attributes and when they live
[1:23:01] their life they are they are proclaiming
[1:23:06] so if the Bible would be written to
[1:23:09] daesh would have the book of sets that
[1:23:13] if the husband would be written today
[1:23:16] that's right we should have the book of
[1:23:18] Stephen exactly right yes my brother
[1:23:21] Hallelujah yes because if you are a son
[1:23:24] of God yes sir you are a part of God yes

[1:50:00] I value you
[1:50:02] amen I sleep with a gun and I wake up
[1:50:06] with a gun
[1:50:08] I know somebody will say brother Stephen
[1:50:10] say he sleep with a gun yes the real gun
[1:50:14] this gun right here
[1:50:18] so if you put me on Tick Tock don't cut
[1:50:21] me before I show the Bible put the Bible
[1:50:23] too
[1:50:25] everybody okay everybody good that's why
[1:50:28] I keep my gun on the devil all the time
[1:50:31] because they are gift there that the
[1:50:34] devil constantly want to trouble you
[1:50:36] trouble your life when he put you down
[1:50:38] you cannot express your gift when he put
[1:50:40] you down oh you don't feel like singing
[1:50:42] when he put you down you don't feel like
[1:50:44] shouting all the time that what is
[1:50:46] causing he was not the musician alone
[1:50:48] singing he was the musician and the
[1:50:51] congregation
[1:50:52] so it was back and forth
[1:50:55] so I have to be jealous over here and
[1:50:57] jealous over there that's why Paul said
[1:51:00] I have a Godly jealousy over you because
[1:51:03] I have expired you to Christ
[1:51:05] and I know what the serpent is and I
[1:51:08] want to keep my gun all the time I'm 24
[1:51:11] hours when you're eating your ice cream
[1:51:13] my God is still like this when I'm
[1:51:15] eating my ice cream I keep my gun like
[1:51:17] this and I'm eating the ice cream
[1:51:20] do you know what I'm talking about do
[1:51:23] you know when they were building the
[1:51:24] Temple
[1:51:26] do you know what happened in one hand
[1:51:29] they keep The Sword and the United hand
[1:51:31] they are building that's how my life is
[1:51:34] asked my wife will tell you if I sit in
[1:51:37] a little bit I'm reading brother Branham
[1:51:41] amen when I'm driving my mind is
[1:51:43] constantly over there searching amen
[1:51:46] because I have to stay alert
[1:51:49] amen but you know what you all came from
[1:51:53] shallow
[1:51:58] and we are going back to shallow
[1:52:01] amen we were his attribute we were in
[1:52:05] him that's why we are here because we
[1:52:08] heard our name
[1:52:09] our name was in the book and when the
[1:52:12] message was speaking we were now hearing
[1:52:15] a man from America
[1:52:18] we were not hearing a man from Kentucky
[1:52:21] that's why you can take brother Branham
[1:52:23] off but we're still in the message
[1:52:25] because we heard the voice
[1:52:29] and we recognize like Abraham that there
[1:52:33] is something different with this man
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:37] because we are the children of Abraham
[1:52:40] may God bless you may God strengthen you
[1:52:43] may God protect you as you go home
