[3:31] welcome you to this marriage ceremony
[3:33] which is a joyful day for sister Kayla
[3:37] and brother Charles Hamilton Jr amen
[3:41] I will invite you to the reading of the
[3:43] scripture and I will take some portion
[3:45] of the scripture from Genesis chapter 2.
[3:49] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7.
[3:52] the Bible says that and the Lord God
[3:55] for men
[3:57] Out of the Dust of the ground what I
[4:00] want you to remember is man of Genesis 2
[4:04] came out from the dust of the ground
[4:07] the scripture continues and breathed
[4:10] into his nostril the breath of life and
[4:13] Man became a living soul
[4:16] Verse 18 the Bible continues and say and
[4:20] the Lord God saying it is not good
[4:23] that demand should be alone
[4:27] I will make him a help meet for him so
[4:30] the one who saw that God being lonely is
[4:33] not good it's not me and you
[4:35] it is God himself
[4:37] who saw that he was not good for man to
[4:40] be alone
[4:42] verse 19 and out of the ground again the
[4:46] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[4:49] and every fowl of the air and brought
[4:52] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[4:55] them and whatsoever Adam call every
[4:58] living creature that was the name
[5:01] thereof if you notice here the body of a
[5:04] man that was formed in Genesis 2 7 and
[5:07] the Beast and the fowl everything came
[5:10] out from the ground
[5:12] amen
[5:13] the Bible continue on verse 20 and Adam
[5:16] gives the name gave names to avocado and
[5:19] to all foul of the air and to every
[5:22] beast of the field but for Adam there
[5:26] was not found in helped made for him and
[5:30] the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall
[5:33] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[5:36] of his ribs and closed up the flesh he
[5:40] never left it open
[5:41] he closed it closed up the flesh instead
[5:45] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[5:47] has taken from man made he a woman
[5:51] and brought hair unto the man it was God
[5:55] who made the woman and took the woman
[5:57] and bring her back to man amen and Adam
[6:01] said this is now born
[6:04] of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and
[6:08] she shall be called woman because she
[6:12] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[6:14] man leave his father and his mother and
[6:17] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[6:20] shall be one flesh and they both were
[6:23] naked the man and his wife and were not
[6:27] ashamed from these portion of the
[6:30] scriptures that we read I want to speak
[6:32] briefly on marriage as the reflection of
[6:37] God marriage as the reflection of God if
[6:42] you open your scriptures
[6:44] which I don't want you to do now in the
[6:46] Book of Genesis Genesis started with the
[6:50] genealogy of the Earth
[6:52] it tells us how God begin to create from
[6:55] the first day all the way to the seventh
[6:58] day where God rested himself
[7:01] on the first day we found out that the
[7:03] light came out on the second day God
[7:06] divided the firmament on the third day
[7:09] the ground of the earth came out and out
[7:12] of the ground God began to bring grass
[7:14] begin to bring for our
[7:16] Patrice and all kind of vegetation in
[7:19] other words about in their life and then
[7:22] from there on the fourth day God spoke
[7:25] that there will be lights on the
[7:27] firmament and the Zodiac begin to be
[7:30] expressed on the face of the sky
[7:32] on the fifth day we found out that God
[7:34] progressing in his work and he began to
[7:37] create the cuddle the fishes the fowl
[7:40] fill up the Seas and the air was filled
[7:43] with four kind of birds and he created
[7:45] also the creeping things but I'm gonna
[7:48] stop right there before I can get on the
[7:51] sixth day
[7:52] and everything that God was creating
[7:55] from the first day all the way to the
[7:58] fifth day where only expressions of God
[8:03] the Bible says in Psalm Chapter 19 Verse
[8:06] 1 to 3 that the heavens declare the
[8:10] glory of God
[8:12] and The Feminine showeth his handiwork
[8:15] day unto day order of speech and night
[8:19] unto night is showeth knowledge there is
[8:22] no speech no language where the voice is
[8:25] not heard in other words everything that
[8:28] God created when you look at the sky
[8:30] there is an expression of God through
[8:33] the sky the Apostle Paul in Romans
[8:35] chapter 1 verse 20 says that for the
[8:38] invisible things of him from the
[8:41] creation of the world are clearly seen
[8:45] being understood by the things that are
[8:49] made even his eternal power and godhead
[8:52] so that they are without excuse in other
[8:55] words everything that God was creating
[8:58] whether he was a tree whether he was a
[9:01] fish whether he was a farm whether he
[9:04] was equipping things whether he was an
[9:06] animal everything was only expressing
[9:09] God can you say Amen and then we notice
[9:12] here that in Genesis 2 man was made out
[9:17] of the Dust of the ground and Not only
[9:19] was Man made out of the Dust of the
[9:22] ground but the creeping things the
[9:24] animal the Beast and the fishes and the
[9:27] fowl everything came from the dust of
[9:30] the ground even though one from another
[9:33] are different in their species yes
[9:36] nevertheless everything came from the
[9:39] same source and the same material
[9:42] in Korea in First Corinthians chapter 15
[9:44] verse 39 that all flesh is not the same
[9:48] flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of
[9:51] men
[9:52] another flesh of Beast another of fishes
[9:57] and another of bird but all these flesh
[10:00] came from one source which is the ground
[10:04] or the dust of the Earth in other words
[10:07] man of Genesis 2 7 was not in the image
[10:12] of God
[10:13] yeah
[10:15] the man of Genesis 2 7 was in the image
[10:20] of an animal
[10:22] the message in question and answering on
[10:25] Genesis in 53 brother Branham says and
[10:28] then he put man in the dust of the Earth
[10:31] which was first man Adam and that was
[10:35] and that man was made after the image
[10:38] this human man here is made after the
[10:42] image of the animal
[10:44] these human bodies are made in the image
[10:47] of animals amen we all are subject to
[10:52] corruption if a man die he wrote we must
[10:56] bury him if a fish die the fish rot
[11:00] if an animal die or a dog dies we must
[11:04] bury that dog if not it will stink
[11:06] because every flesh whether it's a man
[11:09] whether it's a it's a foul of the uh of
[11:12] the heaven whether it's a fish whether
[11:15] if it's creeping things everything came
[11:18] from one source which is the dust of the
[11:21] ground and all those sources are
[11:23] corruptible or subject to corruption
[11:27] in the message in Romans chapter 1 verse
[11:30] 23 Paul says that they change the glory
[11:34] of The Incorruptible God into an image
[11:39] made like corruptable man so man is
[11:43] corruptable he say in the image of a
[11:46] corruptable man
[11:47] and the bird and the four-footed Beast
[11:50] and creeping things so Paul here again
[11:52] in Romans 1 23 he's showing that every
[11:56] flesh is still corruptible man is
[12:00] corruptable animals are corruptable
[12:02] creeping things are corruptable fishes
[12:05] are corruptable birds are corruptible
[12:08] why because they came from the same
[12:11] Source they came from the dust of the
[12:13] earth there was only one man that could
[12:16] defile their law because that man was
[12:19] not you and me that man was the visible
[12:22] image of the invisible God and his name
[12:26] was the Lord Jesus Christ that's why the
[12:29] scripture said that God suffered not his
[12:32] body
[12:33] to see corruption that was the only body
[12:36] that could not rot and he could not rot
[12:39] because that was God himself made flesh
[12:42] in a human being everything else could
[12:45] rot except the body of Jesus Christ so
[12:48] what I'm trying to say here is
[12:51] everything that was created was only an
[12:54] expression of God but it was not the
[12:57] image of God
[13:00] if we go back now in Genesis 1 verse 26
[13:04] the Bible says that God said let us
[13:08] create man on the sixth day in our own
[13:12] image
[13:14] and in our own likeness that is the man
[13:18] that was created in the image of God
[13:22] the animal expressed God but they were
[13:25] not the image of God the trees expressed
[13:29] God but they were not the image of God
[13:31] Amen the creeping things expressed God
[13:34] the Zodiac Express God but none of them
[13:38] were in the image of God that's why God
[13:41] was not satisfied until he could create
[13:44] something that looked exactly like
[13:46] himself
[13:48] amen and the Bible says in John chapter
[13:51] 4 verse 24 that God is a spirit
[13:55] so if God created man in his own image
[13:59] in his own likeness what kind of man was
[14:02] that man that man was a spirit man
[14:06] so the image and the likeness of God is
[14:10] not the man of Genesis 2 7. they imagine
[14:14] the likeness of God is the man of
[14:17] Genesis 1 26 it is a man that was made
[14:21] in His image in his own likeness and
[14:25] that man was a spirit man amen that's
[14:28] why when Jesus came Jesus said that man
[14:32] shall not live by what bread alone bread
[14:35] is the man of Genesis 2 7 but man shall
[14:39] lead by every word
[14:41] the man that lived by the word of God is
[14:44] not the man of Genesis 2 7 it is the man
[14:48] of Genesis 1 26. amen the image of God
[14:54] was created in Genesis 1 26. that's why
[14:58] Jesus said that woman the hour cometh
[15:02] and now is that the true worshiper must
[15:06] worship God in water in spirit because
[15:10] that is the image of God
[15:12] the true worshiper who worship God in
[15:15] spirit and in truth because the spirit
[15:19] was the image of God and if you look at
[15:22] that image when he came out from its own
[15:25] birth
[15:26] God never created only a man
[15:30] the Bible says that he created man male
[15:33] and female
[15:35] amen so from the very birth of a man out
[15:39] of his own Creator man came as a joint
[15:43] unit
[15:44] as a dual-being as a man that was
[15:48] already connected to his mate
[15:50] in other words from eternity we were
[15:53] already joined together
[15:55] amen what God did in Genesis 2 to take
[15:58] the woman and bring him to the man is
[16:01] only to reflect what already existed in
[16:05] Genesis 1. man was already drawn to his
[16:08] wife
[16:09] man was already connected to his wife
[16:11] mad was not could not be separated from
[16:15] his wife and when in Genesis 2 God
[16:18] separated the woman from a man that's
[16:20] why God instituted marriage why to bring
[16:24] the woman back to her position
[16:27] what is the position is to reflect God
[16:30] because God also is male and female
[16:33] that's why he created man in his own
[16:36] image male and female that's why
[16:39] marriage is an instituted of God
[16:43] everybody that's why marriage started as
[16:47] the first thing in the Book of Genesis
[16:49] and marriage ended the Book of Malachi
[16:52] marriage started in the Book of Matthew
[16:54] on the first chapter and on in the Book
[16:57] of Revelation we also talking about the
[17:00] marriage of the lamb and even the first
[17:02] miracle that Jesus done he made it he
[17:06] completed that Miracle during a wedding
[17:08] day because wedding are special
[17:11] amen the Bible says in the Book of
[17:14] Proverbs verse 18 22 chapter 18 verse 22
[17:19] the Bible said whoso foundeth a wife
[17:23] foundeth a good thing
[17:26] comma and obtain favor of the Lord
[17:30] so when you find a wife young man
[17:33] there is a favor of God that is
[17:36] connected to a wife
[17:39] that's why sometimes you will notice not
[17:41] only sometimes but most of the time when
[17:44] a man is single it looks like he's
[17:46] spinning around
[17:48] it looks like he cannot save his money
[17:51] he looks like everything he's doing is
[17:53] not stable but let that man find a good
[17:56] wife
[17:57] and you will find that men begin to
[17:59] prosper that man begin to Blossom why
[18:02] because the one who founded for wife
[18:05] foundeth a good thing
[18:07] and he obtained favor from the Lord
[18:10] that's why things begin to work in the
[18:12] marriage quickly you begin to wonder
[18:14] what was I doing with money but now it
[18:17] seems like I have responsibility yet I
[18:19] can still save why because the favor of
[18:22] God will come upon you when you find a
[18:26] good wife why because marriage is a
[18:29] reflection of God
[18:30] marriage is a reflection of almighty God
[18:34] dear beloved we are gathered here in the
[18:38] sight of God and in the face of this
[18:40] company to join together this man and
[18:43] this woman in holy matrimony which is

[24:26] toward one another so sister Keller you
[24:29] go ahead and start
[24:31] to my Charles Darwin the love of my life
[24:34] where do I begin
[24:36] we met each other in 2009 when we were
[24:40] two broken people not looking for love
[24:43] but somehow the Lord saw fit to put us
[24:45] together
[24:46] we have had our ups and downs but I
[24:49] would do it all over again with you
[24:51] when I was 16 years old I prayed for my
[24:54] husband in specifics and by Godly the
[24:56] Lord Jesus Christ loved me enough he
[24:58] gave me every quality I asked for in you
[25:02] you may not have had our first but we
[25:05] are going to have our present and future
[25:07] together
[25:08] I love how we raise our children with
[25:10] Christ being our headship I love how you
[25:13] see God's face before every decision
[25:16] concerning our lives and family when I
[25:19] think of my Charles Allen I think of how
[25:21] caring you are towards others before
[25:24] your own needs and wants I think of how
[25:27] humble you are even when you should be
[25:29] upset I think of how acceptable you are
[25:32] to to my needs I think of how
[25:36] responsible you are with our family by
[25:38] leaving us to provide in Kentucky
[25:41] I think of how loving you are when you
[25:43] kiss my head as I sleep or as you leave
[25:46] in the middle of the night to go to work
[25:48] I think of how elated you get when we
[25:51] are running around the house playing and
[25:53] cracking jokes on one another during
[25:55] family time I think of how silly you are
[25:58] with us at times and how serious you get
[26:01] when I spend too much
[26:06] I say all of this to say
[26:09] that for the first time in my life I
[26:11] have found true love someone I can truly
[26:14] call my own I see why the Lord put us
[26:17] together he took two broken people and
[26:19] made us whole he made us whole and we
[26:22] are now hold together we get to share
[26:25] this beautiful life together and show
[26:27] our children what a christ-led marriage
[26:29] looks like with Jesus Christ leading the
[26:32] way we cannot fail I love you Charleston

[26:46] lovely go ahead brother Charles
[26:58] that's it my brother go ahead you can do
[27:01] it
[27:05] from the first time I met you
[27:08] there was a mystery about you
[27:20] it was an atmosphere that was always
[27:22] around you
[27:24] I could see it the most precious I was
[27:27] just talking and playing board games
[27:31] I would watch you for hours
[27:33] while you would walk and talked
[27:36] while we play games while you left even
[27:38] when you slept
[27:41] and I can never figure out what was
[27:43] learning in
[27:45] why was I so hypnotized why was I so
[27:48] absorbed with you
[27:50] why was I so mesmerized
[27:57] what I've learned about Mysteries is
[27:59] that you cannot figure them out
[28:02] they have to speak for themselves
[28:05] they have to tell you what they are
[28:08] they have to tell you what they mean
[28:10] hmm but from the very first time that
[28:13] you see it in the end you understand it
[28:16] was telling you the whole time
[28:18] and I missed it
[28:26] for years I cannot figure out
[28:28] what was in front of me
[28:32] that great something that always was
[28:34] around you
[28:35] I agree something when I looked into
[28:37] your eyes that great something that had
[28:39] me so mesmerized so hypnotized and so
[28:41] absorbed that great something
[28:44] what's that
[28:50] doing good was that you loved me
[28:55] I've heard about love all my life
[28:58] but now I see it
[29:00] I see it's unconditional and I see it in
[29:02] you
[29:04] for the rest of my life I will express
[29:06] to you the same love and dedication
[29:09] that was hidden to me but was always
[29:11] known to you
[29:13] I will preserve every moment I will
[29:15] shelter each and every moment at each
[29:17] and every memory
[29:18] within my heart I will treasure all of
[29:21] you all of your beauty all of your Joys
[29:23] all of your sadness all of your
[29:25] imperfections all of your battles all of
[29:27] your shortcomings
[29:29] any and everything that involves you I
[29:31] want to be there with you walking with
[29:33] you and embracing every moment I can
[29:36] because all I want is you
[29:39] many people don't live out their dreams
[29:41] or true happiness
[29:43] they fantasize they wish and they dream
[29:46] about what it could be only to realize
[29:49] they're living with regrets
[29:51] the opportunities they missed the
[29:53] courage that they lacked and the
[29:55] know-how to execute
[29:58] I'm living my dreams
[30:01] I'm embracing my happiness in you
[30:05] the things
[30:06] I fantasize and the wife have become my
[30:08] reality
[30:10] in my reality gives me no time to
[30:12] daydream
[30:14] and you have found the courage to
[30:16] execute any and everything that comes my
[30:18] way
[30:18] I have found courage to love beyond our
[30:21] disagreements and my only regrets are
[30:24] the opportunities that I missed to
[30:25] express all of my love to you
[30:28] from this day forward I promise a new to
[30:30] you to be patient when I don't
[30:32] understand your emotions
[30:34] I promise to dedicate myself to give you
[30:37] security and your affections
[30:39] I promise to be more sincere with your
[30:42] passions I promise to answer before you
[30:44] ask in those silent moments when your
[30:47] atmosphere is communicating to me
[30:49] I promise to love you with all joy and
[30:51] sincerity I promise to accept and
[30:54] carefully nurture the changes that you
[30:56] go through in life considering myself
[30:59] because you are a part of me
[31:02] these things I promise to you from now
[31:05] throughout eternity
[31:07] because from now throughout eternity I
[31:09] will share these things with my best
[31:11] friend
