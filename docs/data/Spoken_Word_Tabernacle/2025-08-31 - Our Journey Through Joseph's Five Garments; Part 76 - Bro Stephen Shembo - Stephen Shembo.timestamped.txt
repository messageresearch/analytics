[0:11] eternal life. Is that right? And he
[0:13] gives it to you. But what? He that
[0:16] heareth my words and believeth on him
[0:18] that sent me has eternal life. That's
[0:20] without end. And shall never come to the
[0:23] judgment, but hath passed from death
[0:26] unto life. Now find you a good church
[0:29] home quickly. Be baptized and move into
[0:33] that church, you and your family, and
[0:34] live peacefully with God. And if I never
[0:37] meet you again this side of the river,
[0:40] I'll meet you on the other side. The
[0:42] Lord bless you.
[0:45] Maybe if we have time after the prayer
[0:47] cards are given and we're praying for
[0:49] the sick tonight that you'll you can
[0:53] come up around the altar and stand here
[0:55] a little while. so the pastors or the
[0:57] city can see who you are. I let a 50,000
[1:02] converts go here not long ago. I don't
[1:04] know what happened in a certain nation
[1:07] that I was in. Someone just set up the
[1:09] meetings. We didn't have any
[1:11] cooperation. They just set up the
[1:12] meeting and thousands poured into that
[1:14] country and there was no church home to
[1:17] take them to. I don't know what
[1:18] happened. I thought every church in the
[1:20] country was cooperating, but just a
[1:22] minister or a man, just a lawyer just
[1:25] set up the meeting and said, "Come on."
[1:26] And I just flew in there and started. We
[1:28] had five nights and 5,000 each night or
[1:31] more come to Christ. And I don't know
[1:33] what happened where they went to church
[1:35] home. Uh learning a little better than
[1:37] that now. Every every person that's
[1:41] saved ought to have a church home.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. the ought to be in church and
[1:46] there every every time that church has a
[1:48] service or every time you pass it go in
[1:51] open the doors and go in and pray or do
[1:53] something love the Lord.
[1:56] It was a today
[1:59] where I live there was a some people
[2:02] that had to leave. There happened to be
[2:04] a very good Norwegian friend of mine
[2:06] who's sitting here is my secretary for
[2:09] the Norwegian people and has been since
[2:11] I was in Norway
[2:14] and he's done all the translation not
[2:16] one scent part or anything. He was
[2:18] sitting in the room he and his lovely
[2:20] little wife and a vision begin to move
[2:24] and someone knocked at the

[12:48] We thank you Lord that you know our name
[12:50] Lord God.
[12:53] We thank you that we can call you our
[12:55] father this morning Lord God. That you
[12:57] call us your children Lord Jesus.
[13:01] We thank you father as your children
[13:04] Lord. That you've given us your
[13:05] attributes Lord God. That your genes
[13:08] flow in our blood Lord God.
[13:11] that the power that you displayed when
[13:14] you were walking in the the body of
[13:16] Jesus, Lord, is in us now, Lord God.
[13:18] Walking the face of the earth now, Lord.
[13:22] Almighty God, what a honor and a
[13:25] privilege it is to be in your house once
[13:27] again this morning, Lord.
[13:30] We thank you, Lord. And we just look
[13:32] forward to this fellowship with you once
[13:34] again, Lord God, and with each other,
[13:36] Lord.
[13:38] So we ask Lord God that you would come
[13:40] amongst us and have your will. Lord,
[13:43] open our ears up Lord and our hearts to
[13:46] thy word when it becomes out. Lord God,
[13:49] let us sing the songs of Zion this
[13:51] morning Lord with joy in our hearts Lord
[13:53] God for everything that you do for us
[13:56] Lord.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. We are a thankful people, Lord
[14:00] God.
[14:02] And we want to be careful, Lord,
[14:04] just to give you all the glory, Lord.
[14:08] There is nobody else, Lord, that is
[14:10] worthy, Lord.
[14:12] There never was and there never will be,
[14:15] Lord.
[14:17] And we thank you, Lord, as we stand in
[14:19] the presence of Almighty God,
[14:23] that you just feed us today, Lord God.
[14:26] Yes, Lord.
[14:28] Give us this day our daily bread. Lord,
[14:31] let the worship that you receive this
[14:34] morning, Lord, be in spirit, Lord, and
[14:36] in truth, Lord God.
[14:38] Let us put aside our own desires, Lord,
[14:41] our own perceptions, Lord. Anything
[14:44] that's on our heart that's other
[14:45] contrary to the word, Lord, let it just
[14:49] depart from us, Lord.
[14:52] Even this crud, Lord God, that seems to
[14:54] be going around, Lord, let it just be
[14:56] gone, Lord, that we can lift our voices
[15:00] without any
[15:02] in just inhibiting us, Lord, that we can
[15:06] give you all the praise and the worship,
[15:09] Lord. Those that are still on the way,
[15:11] touch them, Lord, and give them grace in
[15:12] their travel.
[15:14] Bless each one, Lord. We're a happy
[15:17] people, Lord God, because we serve the
[15:20] Almighty God.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, for once again,
[15:24] Lord,
[15:26] for rejoicing, Lord, and just for re
[15:29] revealing yourself to us, Lord.
[15:32] We thank you, Father. Remember our
[15:34] pastor in that back room, Lord.
[15:37] I'm sure you were up with him late last
[15:39] night, Lord God. But we know that you'll
[15:41] give him strength, Lord.
[15:44] and he's given us a little liberty with
[15:46] the music this morning, Lord God, and
[15:48] we're going to use it, Lord Jesus, for
[15:49] your glory.
[15:52] So, we ask that you would be blessed
[15:54] this morning, Lord. We bless your name.
[15:58] Bless our pastor and give him strength
[16:00] that you can bless us with the word,
[16:02] Lord. We thank you, Father, in Jesus
[16:06] Christ's name. Lord, bless everyone this
[16:08] morning, Lord. Amen and amen and amen.

[23:31] You know, these brothers, I had this I
[23:33] had my portion of the service planned.
[23:35] You know, I try to get a little
[23:37] inspiration through the week and let
[23:39] everybody know in advance, but
[23:41] everything that these brothers sang and
[23:43] talked about yesterday just kind of
[23:45] confirmed it. They mentioned the rock a
[23:47] few times in their songs,
[23:51] and I wanted to sing the rock of ages
[23:54] this morning. Amen.
[23:56] Cuz that's what he is. And sometimes,
[23:59] and I'm a hard head, but sometimes that
[24:01] rock can display itself through my wife.
[24:06] She, you know, and I and sometimes I
[24:08] beat my head against the rock, you know,
[24:11] headship and submission and, you know,
[24:13] but
[24:15] she speaks and it's the voice of God.
[24:17] Sometimes it's not always uh Zapora or
[24:21] or uh Job's wife or even Adam's wife,
[24:26] you know.
[24:27] So I thank God for my wife.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:33] Amen.
[24:34] [Music]
[24:36] Amen.
[24:39] And listen at the Lord Terry's. We only
[24:41] got 13 more years and we'll be back over
[24:44] there at the Hilton. Sister Kelly,
[24:48] &gt;&gt; now I thought you'd be on your honey bun
[24:50] today. What happened?
[24:54] Amen. Yeah, that's right.
[24:56] So, let's sing this and let's just give
[24:59] our praise to the Lord in our worship
[25:00] this morning. And I've got four verses
[25:04] on this. I don't know how many is on
[25:05] your page there, brother Logos, but

[25:58] double cure.
[26:02] Save from wrath
[26:06] and make me.
[26:11] But the laborers
[26:15] of my hands
[26:19] can fulfill
[26:23] thy lost demands.

[26:31] rest I know.
[26:35] Could my tears
[26:39] forever
[26:41] flow
[26:44] all for sin could not at all.
[26:51] Thou my savior
[26:55] and thou alone.
[26:59] Nothing in my hand I bring
[27:07] simply to
[27:11] thy cross I
[27:15] make it come
[27:19] to thee for dress
[27:23] helpless

[27:57] are
[27:58] in

[28:05] to earth
[28:09] and behold
[28:12] beyond thy
[28:17] rock of aes

[28:28] myself
[28:36] for me.
[28:39] Let me hide

[28:51] the world.

[29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's give him a
[29:20] clap.
[29:22] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[29:26] Amen. Amen. And amen.
[29:29] I don't have much here uh this morning.
[29:31] If y'all could just stand with me um for
[29:34] just a minute. I'm going to ask Brother
[29:36] Charles if he doesn't mind going to the
[29:38] Lord for us. Yes.
[29:42] Lily has a praise report if get her
[29:45] miked up again. And
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; I know we already know it's my parents
[29:50] anniversary, but I feel like I just need
[29:52] to say something about it. Um, being the
[29:55] youngest, I feel like, you know, you
[29:58] have a different perspective than your
[30:00] older siblings do. My older siblings
[30:03] kind of saw the beginning stages of my
[30:05] parents' marriage, but I saw like
[30:09] years and years later that I saw the
[30:13] wisdom that they grew in towards, you
[30:17] know, closer to now. And I got to reap
[30:20] more of the benefits of that. And you
[30:22] know, your older siblings say that the
[30:24] youngest is the most spoiled
[30:26] and the one where the one, you know,
[30:29] where your parents are more lenient, but
[30:31] I think my parents just grew in a lot of
[30:33] wisdom when they had me and um getting
[30:37] married. You rely a lot on your parents'
[30:39] wisdom. When you're getting started and
[30:41] my parents have really shared a lot of
[30:44] their wisdom of their early year
[30:46] struggles with us with no judgment.
[30:48] We've always been able to come and talk
[30:49] to them. Amen.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; And um being able to just sit and talk
[30:53] to your parents for hours and see like
[30:55] 37 years of of growth and 37 years of
[30:58] your family. Um it's really a blessing
[31:02] to me and Zach. So I just wanted to
[31:03] praise God that our family got started
[31:05] 37 years ago today.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Kelly, you want to say
[31:15] something? Can I say something first?
[31:19] We didn't get a chance yesterday.
[31:22] This brother here, you talk about an
[31:24] inspiration.
[31:25] I started thinking, Lord, I ain't done
[31:27] nothing. And what have I done for God
[31:29] compared to this man? You know, Brother
[31:31] Brandham used to say that, but after
[31:34] hearing everything that this brother's
[31:35] done, it's just amazing the life that
[31:37] he's had and what he's done in the
[31:39] kingdom. And I just want to say, you
[31:41] know, hopefully for spoken word that we
[31:43] love you with all our heart. We
[31:46] appreciate you.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:52] Praise. Praise the Lord. But John,
[31:55] congratulations. I'm not going to take
[31:57] anything away from uh your marriage,
[32:00] your year. Sister Edith, God richly
[32:03] bless you, your anniversary. But I just
[32:06] wanted to bring this testimony from
[32:08] yesterday. You know, one of some of the
[32:11] ones that were there, the the senior
[32:13] pastor that was there, he came to me
[32:17] probably, he says, "I've never witnessed
[32:20] nothing like this before."
[32:29] &gt;&gt; And we thank the Lord for Sister Lorel,
[32:33] Sister Pam, and I wanted to wait till
[32:36] they can hear it internationally. what
[32:39] God was doing.
[32:41] But he said it wasn't that that really
[32:44] struck his spirit.
[32:46] He said it was the people, the love that
[32:50] was in the people that was there
[32:52] yesterday. He said that's what he never
[32:55] seen like he never seen before. God
[32:58] bless you and thank you all.
[33:06] Hallelujah. Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be a part of this?
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, really?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Caroline and brother Tony,
[33:18] &gt;&gt; it's your anniversary, brother Tony,
[33:20] today.
[33:23] You didn't forget, did you?
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Happy anniversary, brother.
[33:37] 36 years.
[33:39] Amen.
[33:41] It's today.
[33:43] Yesterday. Ah, wonderful.
[33:47] Wonderful.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; I I was really impressed yesterday with
[33:52] with the elders
[33:55] to look at some of those old soldiers.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; You could see battle scars.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; You could tell in their spirit that they
[34:01] had been through a lot. and and it was
[34:04] just wonderful because there's they're
[34:05] still here for us. Yes. The threefold
[34:09] cord, it can't be broken. And we just
[34:12] appreciate I had not seen brother
[34:14] Anderson. Brother Kelly, we were
[34:16] baptized in his church by another man in
[34:19] 1992.
[34:21] And brother Anderson had counseledled my
[34:23] wife and I with the presence of his wife
[34:25] and we had not seen them since that day
[34:28] in January of 1992. And it was such a
[34:32] joy to see them and brother Isaiah
[34:35] Brooks to see them just to just to enjoy
[34:39] the fellowship. We have brother Kelly's
[34:41] brother here today as well, brother
[34:43] Patrick from West Palm Beach. So we want
[34:45] to make sure that we greet him and make
[34:48] him feel welcome as well. And and and
[34:53] you feel you fill out a visitor card.
[34:55] But brother Kelly, you know we ain't got
[34:57] no visitors here. Amen. Amen. So, I got
[35:01] one prayer request here. Um, Brother
[35:04] Bernard is not with us this morning.
[35:06] He's not feeling well and he needs a
[35:08] touch in his body this morning. Amen.
[35:11] So, let's remember our precious brother.
[35:13] And I think a few of us have gone
[35:15] through through something this past
[35:16] week. Amen. But God will get us through
[35:19] it.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; He always does.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Always does. Always does. All right,
[35:23] family. Let us Let us pray. Family,

[1:15:22] I had some major bill to deal with. We
[1:15:24] had seven and we knocked four out.
[1:15:33] So we have three more three more left
[1:15:37] and once are clear that that means
[1:15:39] automatically our uh uh Abraham Lincoln
[1:15:42] ship will move.
[1:15:46] Somebody's lost.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln ship is the United
[1:15:50] States warship that they keep on the
[1:15:52] Pacific to keep everything. So once all
[1:15:56] those three are clear, we turn our
[1:15:58] Abraham Lincoln ship toward the
[1:16:00] fellowship hall and then begin to work
[1:16:02] and see how we can put the foundation
[1:16:04] and everything. Amen.

[1:16:08] of the testimony, I don't even know how
[1:16:09] to tell you because I'm on YouTube.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; So it's hard for me to tell you. I just

[1:16:51] the invisible audience.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; It's our season.

[1:25:44] the Lord,

[1:25:58] him and he left and he called me back.
[1:26:00] He said, "Broad Steven, I want to tell
[1:26:02] you something. I came to work there and
[1:26:04] I was so sick and when I got inside the
[1:26:07] building I prayed inside the building
[1:26:10] and instantly
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; 90% of everything went up
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; and brother David got healed
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; inside that building over there. God is

[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; You will need your Bible because this
[1:27:12] type of sermon, I cannot jump quickly

[1:27:30] life journey through Joseph's five
[1:27:32] garment part 76.

[1:27:41] this morning, if the Lord give us time,
[1:27:45] is taking
[1:27:48] advantage.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; there we go.
[1:27:53] of the seasons.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; You know very well if you start pulling
[1:28:01] that's your problem.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:28:09] are approaching you humbly this morning
[1:28:11] again. Father, thanking you for your
[1:28:13] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:28:15] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:28:18] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:28:20] the ability you have given me. But when
[1:28:23] it comes to speaking, ministering to
[1:28:25] your children, the purchase of the blood
[1:28:27] of the lamb, he only take a supernatural
[1:28:30] action of the Holy Spirit. So, Father,
[1:28:32] may you come and move me completely out
[1:28:34] of the way. May you be the one talking,
[1:28:37] the one speak, speaking, the one
[1:28:39] ministering, and the one hearing and
[1:28:42] listening. Lord Father, may you come and
[1:28:44] bless us, Lord Father, in the power of
[1:28:46] your resurrection. We rebuke every
[1:28:48] demonic spirit away from this place. May
[1:28:51] nothing but God yourself, the Holy
[1:28:54] Spirit, and the elect angel be in this
[1:28:56] place in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of 1 Chronicle
[1:29:04] chapter 12.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Countertop.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; We already spoke in detail with this. So
[1:29:12] we will touch the surface and try to see
[1:29:16] uh keep oursel keep moving. Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle chapter uh 12 verse 32. She
[1:29:25] said that's if you can make sure the
[1:29:27] those online are back.
[1:29:32] Somebody online even asked a question
[1:29:34] and say uh I mentioned something last
[1:29:37] Sunday what I was referring to. Even if
[1:29:40] you don't you are sick yourself,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; you can still pray for somebody
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and God will heal that person.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus was on the cross
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; but he could grant salvation to somebody
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; but he could not remove himself from the
[1:29:55] cross
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; because the cross has a different path
[1:29:58] for him.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; But he can still grieve salvation. He
[1:30:01] didn't say wait till I come off from the
[1:30:03] cross then I'm going to give you
[1:30:04] salvation. So whichever state you are in
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; whether you going through the valley or
[1:30:09] you are on green man I mean pastor
[1:30:12] whatever just know God is with you.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32.
[1:30:21] The Bible says this is the children of
[1:30:23] Issachar and the children of Isachar
[1:30:27] which were men of what?
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; That had understanding of
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; men that had understanding of time. The
[1:30:35] children of Issacha. Now you understand
[1:30:36] this very well. Those were men that have
[1:30:40] understanding
[1:30:43] of what?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; The times.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Times in plural.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Understanding of times.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, these people have a
[1:30:52] discernment.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Of times.
[1:30:58] In other word, of seasons.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The children of Issachar have
[1:31:05] understanding of times. Come on. To know
[1:31:09] what Israel ought to do. So it's not
[1:31:13] just a discernment,
[1:31:17] just knowing
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; but their revelation
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; goes with the works.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:31:27] So they also know
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; what to do.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; The first one is a revelation
[1:31:42] which means faith
[1:31:45] and the second one is work.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. They know, they understand the
[1:31:55] time,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; but they don't stop at understanding the
[1:31:58] time.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; After understanding the time, they also
[1:32:02] get into action.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; So, it's faith with works
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; because faith without work is dead.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that to know what Israel
[1:32:14] ought to do. The heads of them were 200
[1:32:18] and all their brethren were at their
[1:32:20] commandment. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; This was needed for the throne of David.
[1:32:25] Now let's go to the book of proverb
[1:32:28] chapter 6.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; If we cross the book of proverb,
[1:32:36] it will be wonderful.
[1:32:39] Sister Adansa, you can refocus again
[1:32:44] if you cross this book of proverb. It
[1:32:46] will be wonderful. So Lord, help me
[1:32:49] cross it. Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Proverb chapter 6. Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 6. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; You know this, we dare. We We went into
[1:33:01] a detail. Now, I'm going to go ahead and
[1:33:04] maneuver differently.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Verse six, the Bible says, "Go to the
[1:33:09] end."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So, God is sending somebody to the end.
[1:33:18] Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; This is grace.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; This is mercy.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, God have seen the
[1:33:27] suffering of someone.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And now God is bringing the solution.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And the solution is go to the end.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You who?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Slugger is a lazy man. All right.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; So today as we moving we will see what
[1:33:50] is wrong with a slugger.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; A lazy man. Yes sir.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; So God is extending his mercy.
[1:34:01] Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; His grace.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Upon a lazy
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; upon a slagger
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; because God could have left that slagger
[1:34:12] like that.
[1:34:13] Yeah.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And he can continue on his own ways in
[1:34:17] his own ways and continue to suffer.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; But God came down
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; and say, "I see your condition." Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; You are struggling.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm bringing you mercy.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you a solution.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And your solution is go to the end.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I'm going to take
[1:34:39] off from the airport. Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; He said go to the end, you slugger.
[1:34:43] Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "Consider its way and do what?"
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Be wise.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Consider its way and be wise. If you
[1:34:55] notice, God is sending a slugger. A
[1:34:59] slugger is a human being.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; This slugger is a human being.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] But God doesn't send this human being to
[1:35:13] another human being.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; God is sending this human being to an
[1:35:19] end.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Now look at the size that you are.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Who is here who never seen an ant?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Number one, God is showing mercy.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God is showing grace.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; God is bringing deliverance.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; God is bringing solution
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; to the problem that this man is
[1:35:49] struggling with.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And the solution is in the house of an
[1:35:54] ant.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; God cannot send you a big man like
[1:36:03] brother Steven.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. A big man like you are,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; a big lady like you are,
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; and God send you to the end.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; There must be some type of a proud
[1:36:20] spirit.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Help me leave the airport, my friend.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going through a surgery. Help me
[1:36:33] leave the airport, my friend. There must
[1:36:35] be a proud spirit
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; in this slagger.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; He's a proud slagger.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And and in order for God to help him,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; God have to humble him.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; This is my Bible different than yours.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; This slagger here is proud.
[1:37:05] Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; So God say, "Since you proud, I'm going
[1:37:09] to send you to the end."
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, I want you to gain
[1:37:14] wisdom,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; not from another human being,
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; not from a preacher,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; not from a prophet,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; your wisdom will come from an ant.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says this about the
[1:37:33] ant. I'm still reading my Bible. So turn
[1:37:35] your 45 minute off. Amen. The Bible says
[1:37:39] about the ant in proverb 30:4.
[1:37:43] He says there be what?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Four things.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; If you read this yourself at home, which
[1:37:49] I will also advise you to do, stay on uh
[1:37:52] chapter 6. These four things in if you
[1:37:55] go to the book of proverb, the four
[1:37:57] things are the first one is an end.
[1:38:01] We clear.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; The second one is a connie.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; The third one was the locust. It's
[1:38:09] written in your Bible.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And the fourth one was a spider.
[1:38:15] You can verify that in the book of
[1:38:17] Solomon. Solomon said there are four
[1:38:20] things. The first is an ant. The second
[1:38:22] is a connie. The third one is a locust.
[1:38:25] And the fourth one is a spatter. But out
[1:38:28] of all these four,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; the smallest one
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; is the end.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that these four
[1:38:42] creatures, these four things which are
[1:38:45] little upon the earth, but they are
[1:38:47] exceedingly what?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; So the spider according to the Bible is
[1:38:52] wise. Right. Right.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; If you doubt, you don't say, "Amen." We
[1:38:57] going to open Proverb 30.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; We're good.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; We good.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, the spider is
[1:39:04] wise.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; The locust is wise.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; The conies are wise.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The ant are wise.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Exceedingly wise.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But God didn't send this man to the
[1:39:17] locust.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't send him to the spider. He
[1:39:22] didn't send him to the conies.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; God sent him to the end to the smallest
[1:39:27] one
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; because this guy have a problem of a
[1:39:30] proud spirit.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I know you won't get me now, but you
[1:39:34] will get it.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; So God is humbling this man.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; God is humbling this woman.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Say you got a problem,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; but your solution go to the right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Humble yourself.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the wisdom of an end.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And we know that wisdom was God's
[1:39:55] wisdom.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But it was displayed in humility.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 6 verse 7.
[1:40:06] Which have what?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; No guide.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; You already understand that.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Overseer or what?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Ruler.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; But the end provide her meat when
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; And gather her food when?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; In the harvest. So the ant is a creature
[1:40:22] that understand season.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; The ant.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Understand
[1:40:34] understand time.
[1:40:37] Understand season.
[1:40:40] Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; When it's summer, the ant knows what to
[1:40:43] do. And when it's fall, which is the
[1:40:46] harvest, the ant knows exactly what to
[1:40:48] do. And God say go learn from the end.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And when you learn from the end, you
[1:40:54] find out that the end work with the
[1:40:56] season.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; The end take advantage.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Take opportunity.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Of the season.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; When it's the correct season, the ant is
[1:41:09] in action.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; The ant knows how to discern the time
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; and walk in a time.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because the children of
[1:41:19] Isachar, not only do they have
[1:41:21] understanding of time, but they know
[1:41:23] what to do.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the end provide
[1:41:28] her meat when
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; And gather her food where?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; In the harvest.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; In the in the harvest. He's gathering
[1:41:35] the food. In other words, somebody's
[1:41:37] storing the food. Keep that in mind, my
[1:41:39] friend. If you look on Proverb right
[1:41:42] here, the Bible says that the ant are a
[1:41:45] people not strong.
[1:41:47] So it's not about the physical strength.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It's about wisdom
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and knowing what to do. Yet they prepare
[1:41:55] the meat when
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And what are they preparing the meat
[1:42:00] for?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; For the future oncoming season which is
[1:42:05] called what?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[1:42:10] Keep that in mind. Lord help me. Amen.
[1:42:14] Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 8 uh verse 9. How long
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; will you sleep who?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Oh slugger.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. God is
[1:42:29] saying
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; how long
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; will you sleep who? What?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; So this man must be in this condition
[1:42:37] for a long time.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:42:44] It's a man that God is bringing mercy,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; grace, deliverance, solution. It's a man
[1:42:51] that have been proud
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; and has been in this condition.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; For a long time
[1:43:03] until he became a nature.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And they call him already slagger.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; He was not born slagger.
[1:43:13] But he became slagger.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "How long will you sleep
[1:43:19] or oh slugger?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; When will you arise out of your what?"
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Sleep.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; So God is wanting this man to wake up.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; God want this man to wake up or this
[1:43:33] woman wake up. In other words, you've
[1:43:36] been sleeping too long.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; So God is bringing an awakening. Amen.
[1:43:42] That's right. Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Why?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yet a little sleep.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; This is the behavior of the man.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; We went through this. Yet a what?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; A little sleep.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Not a big one. You remember this?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Yet what?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; A little sleep.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; A little slumber.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And a little folding of hand. In other
[1:44:04] words, doing nothing.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] So shall poverty come as one that
[1:44:11] travails and you and your want as a
[1:44:14] nman. In other words, poverty will hit
[1:44:16] you like a thief.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; So God is showing the behavior of this
[1:44:23] slagger right here that his behavior
[1:44:26] that have consequences of poverty is
[1:44:29] that this man is inactive.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. doing nothing,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; folding hand and as a consequence
[1:44:41] poverty
[1:44:43] and God is bringing the solution. Go to
[1:44:46] the house of the ant. And this is your
[1:44:48] solution. Everybody clear?
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody clear?
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb
[1:44:54] 12 as we dealing with this slagger.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverb 12 verse 27,
[1:45:05] a slagger, a lazy, a sloful man. It's
[1:45:09] the same word.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you'll be all right.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Proverb 12 27. If you dare, you can say
[1:45:21] amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; The slothful, which is the slagger,
[1:45:26] man roasteth not that which he took in
[1:45:30] hunting.
[1:45:33] In other words, this man will go to hunt
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; and God will bless the man.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And after God brought his blessing to
[1:45:43] the man,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; the man stop right there
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and does not complete the task.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; He does not utilize the resource
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; that God brought unto him.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Number five,
[1:46:05] it's a man.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Who does not complete task
[1:46:14] [Laughter]
[1:46:18] does not complete task or a man. Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. who waste
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; resources
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; provided by God.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, God will give him some
[1:46:38] blessing.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; He goes to hunting
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; and he come back with a big paycheck.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] But he doesn't continue all the way.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; He gets stuck somewhere.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And before you know it,
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; they prey
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; whatever he caught up from the hunting
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; will be destroyed
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; and spoiled
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; because of his attitude of being
[1:47:08] slagger.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is saying. The
[1:47:12] slothful man roasteth not that which he
[1:47:15] took in hunting, but the substance
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; the prey of a diligent man is how
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; precious.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; So a man that is diligent as soon as
[1:47:25] this come into his hand, he said, "Thank
[1:47:28] you Jesus for giving me this.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; So what should I do
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; with what you have given to me
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; so that I can utilize this?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; You brought this for my blessing.
[1:47:41] But if you don't know what to do, you
[1:47:43] will spoil it.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Please shake somebody's hand.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get to those who spend a
[1:47:57] lot.
[1:47:59] [Laughter]
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb 13:4. I'm dealing
[1:48:09] with this slagger. Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:48:18] the soul verse four of a slagger does
[1:48:22] what?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Desire.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; So this slagger is not that because he's
[1:48:26] a slagger he doesn't have wishes.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; No, he does have wishes.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; He desire to have a big life. Right.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen, my friend.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; The slugger has desire.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; A lot of them.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; He can sit and he say, I want to drive a
[1:48:51] car like so and so.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; I want to have a house like so and so. I
[1:48:56] also want my children to do like this.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; He has desire.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; The problem is he's a slugger.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And what happened to his desire? Verse
[1:49:04] four, the soul of the slagger desires
[1:49:08] and has water.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So it's a man that will never be
[1:49:12] satisfied of his desire.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; His desire will never never
[1:49:20] be fulfilled.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; He will go to the grave with unfinished
[1:49:27] desires.
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Even if he desire, he say I want to
[1:49:33] build a house. that say because he
[1:49:35] doesn't do what is necessary to get a
[1:49:38] house
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; before you know it he will be renting
[1:49:42] all his life.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; So the desire of a slagger stays in his
[1:49:51] heart.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; The desire buried in the heart.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; There is a tombstone on the desire.
[1:50:02] He's a man full of theory.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Full of theory.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Full of project.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Unful fulfill project.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just describing you this
[1:50:19] man.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Then we going to take off.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; We together.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; We together.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; To go to Proverb 18.
[1:50:31] If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Proverb 18,
[1:50:36] just keep your Bible.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; If I tell you all of this,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Where is he coming from with this?
[1:50:44] Proverb 18:9. If you dare, you can say
[1:50:47] amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Don't get tired. It's just the
[1:50:49] beginning, my friend.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "He also that is who?
[1:50:55] slothful
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; in his work is a brother to him that is
[1:50:59] a great what
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; waster.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; So the slugger always have friend of
[1:51:05] people that spend too much.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; I'm reading your Bible my friend.
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[1:51:16] a slagger.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; A slagger. You will think because he
[1:51:21] doesn't work,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; he will be spending less.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; No, he's the one that spend a lot,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to work
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; because he's always friend to the
[1:51:31] spender.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; He want adventures,
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to bring the income
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; for the adventure.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; So, whatever he gets, he burns it.
[1:51:44] As soon as money come, it's wasting.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; As soon as before the paycheck come on
[1:51:50] Friday,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; the paycheck is already gone.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And the paycheck is very skinny one
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want to work.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? Brother
[1:52:08] Angelo said no. So it's a friend
[1:52:12] of the westernus.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; You want to find him? Go around. Those
[1:52:19] who waste the money,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; they hang out somewhere in downtown.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Are you working? No. I got fired.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; So you eating on the expensive
[1:52:33] restaurant and you got fired.
[1:52:41] Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. You want me to preach the
[1:52:45] seven seal? This is the seventh seal.
[1:52:51] The seven seal open up everything.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Go to Proverb 20.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; The slagger.
[1:53:01] I'm describing this so you find yourself
[1:53:03] where you are
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; before we take off. Proverb 20:4. If you
[1:53:08] dare, you can say amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; The slagger will not plow
[1:53:16] by reason of what?
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; It's a person who usually doesn't want
[1:53:21] to move out of a comfort zone.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And God is bringing a solution.
[1:53:30] This cold is not the cold of the winter
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; because you don't plow in the winter.
[1:53:36] You plow in the fall.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; But this man doesn't want to move from a
[1:53:41] comfort zone.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; If it's a comfort zone, he doesn't want
[1:53:46] to do it. But the motive behind it, he
[1:53:49] just doesn't want to work.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he doesn't want to go uh
[1:53:53] plat.
[1:53:55] Therefore shall he beg
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; in harvest and have what?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Why are you begging?
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; What were you doing when the season came
[1:54:07] to plow?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Where were you when it was plowing
[1:54:10] season?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Go to Proverb 21. We moving forward, my
[1:54:18] friend. Verse 25. If you dare, you can
[1:54:20] say amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; The desire verse 25. The desire of the
[1:54:25] slothful does what?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Killth him.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Full of worries.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He has desire, but the desire does what?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Killth him.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; He's he's eaten up.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; By his own desire.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they never come true. His
[1:54:45] dream never come true.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; His desire kills him for his hand
[1:54:50] refused to neighbor.
[1:54:53] He knows what to do,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to do it.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; So he stay in an imaginary world.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Until he dies poor.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Job to uh chapter 22:E 13.
[1:55:19] [Laughter]
[1:55:21] If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; You there?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; The slothful man says what?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; There is a lion without.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; There is a lion outside.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I is my Bible different.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; There is a lion where?
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Outside.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; I shall be slain in the water street.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Usually they have poor irrational
[1:55:43] excuses.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; It's poor
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; irrational
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; excuses.
[1:55:58] Why are you not doing this? They will
[1:56:00] come up with an excuse.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, they will fabricate even
[1:56:04] an excuse
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; to prove the reason why they're not
[1:56:08] they're not doing what they supposed to
[1:56:10] do.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; But God is bringing a solution.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Go to the end.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We talking about taking
[1:56:19] advantage of the season.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; We clear, my friend.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Jump to Proverb 24.
[1:56:24] [Laughter]
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Ah yeah yeah yeah yeah. My my my my
[1:56:30] hallelujah.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; 24:30. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Solomon say I went by the field of
[1:56:40] water.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; So a slo is not that he doesn't have
[1:56:45] anything. He owns a field.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; God gave it to him.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; God gave him some field.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; God gave him resources.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Solomon say, "I went by the way of a of
[1:57:01] a slugger." Amen. By the field of a
[1:57:04] slugger.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; And by the vineyard of a man void of
[1:57:08] water.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; So it's a lack of wisdom somewhere.
[1:57:12] There is a field and there is a
[1:57:14] vineyard.
[1:57:16] God granted them resources. But what
[1:57:19] happened? Verse uh uh uh 31. And lo, it
[1:57:23] was all grown over with what?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Thorn.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; So it's a man who wast
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; the resources that God put on him
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; in his life. He say it's full of thorn
[1:57:35] and water.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Nettles
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; that covered the face thereof.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And the stone wall was what? They're all
[1:57:42] broken down.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; It's usually people who are very
[1:57:45] negligent.
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; The toilet bowl is destroyed. You will
[1:57:56] take three years to fix it.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know where that one came from,
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; but I have to deliver it, my friend.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; They keep procrastinating things over
[1:58:08] and over.
[1:58:11] And the house look like a mess.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; can I continue?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Then I saw verse 32. And consider it
[1:58:22] well and look upon it and receive what
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; instruction.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Yet what?
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; A little sleep.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; He's repeating again. A little slumber,
[1:58:29] a little folding of a hand to sleep
[1:58:31] shall water.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Thy poverty come as one that travelth
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; and your want as an armen. Are we
[1:58:37] together?
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:39] Go to proverb 26. Then we finish with
[1:58:41] proverb.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; We are describing the proud man.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Proverb 26.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Because I told you before, this man is
[1:58:56] proud.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Some of you say amen. Some didn't say
[1:59:01] amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; But now you're going to say amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Proverb 26:E16.
[1:59:07] If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; The slagger is wiser in his own conceit.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's wiser in his own
[1:59:18] eyes.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; When you talk to them, they have a big
[1:59:22] head.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; They know everything.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Yet they are suffering.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; You cannot tell them anything.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; They already know a lot. Am
[1:59:36] I saying something?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible say that the the the the
[1:59:41] slider is wiser. It's a proud man.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; He cannot take instruction.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; He cannot humble himself to follow
[1:59:49] instruction.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; He say he's wiser how?
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; In in his own conceit.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; And he's wiser in his own conceit than
[1:59:58] what?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Seven men
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; that can render a what?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; A reason. In other words, this man think
[2:00:04] he's greater than seven men.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; If you notice, not one man,
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; not two men,
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; not three men, but he think he's greater
[2:00:15] than seven men. Why seven men? Because
[2:00:19] seven men hold the wisdom of God.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:00:29] together? This cloud was made by seven
[2:00:32] angels
[2:00:35] and the seven angel work with the seven
[2:00:37] messengers.
[2:00:39] But the slider thinks he knows more than
[2:00:42] the cloud.
[2:00:44] He thinks he knows more than the
[2:00:46] messenger.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; He thinks he knows more than the
[2:00:50] message.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Barnam says this, my
[2:01:00] friend, in the message shalom. He said
[2:01:04] just exactly like he showed us in the
[2:01:06] seven churches, what would come
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; just what?
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; What he showed us what would come when
[2:01:13] he set that light right there.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Up there in revelation to it to
[2:01:19] show what
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; the world.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; When he sent what?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; The seven angels
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Reveal the seven messengers
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; that he had been through. that we've
[2:01:28] been through down there and show the
[2:01:30] loose end each angel coming when
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; each day
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; and revealing the loose end that who
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Luther left
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; and who
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Wesley left
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; and who
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Pentecost left
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; it all represented what
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; in there.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; So a man that think he knows more than
[2:01:45] Christ
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; because the highest order of the earth
[2:01:49] is the messenger
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; and God wisdom is upon the messenger.
[2:01:54] You cannot know more than William Marion
[2:01:57] Bran.
[2:01:58] I'm not talking about the man, but I'm
[2:02:01] talking about the God that was in the
[2:02:03] land. Because we are not feeding upon
[2:02:06] the word of man, but we are feeding upon
[2:02:09] the unfailing body word of the Solomon.
[2:02:14] The messages are absolute. The word is
[2:02:18] your top. Humble yourself under the
[2:02:21] message.
[2:02:22] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Whatever you
[2:02:26] do be under the message because the
[2:02:29] message is the wisdom of God.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; It is the cloud my friend.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; It is the head of God. It is the
[2:02:37] intelligence of God. It is the wisdom of
[2:02:39] God that have been sent to make you
[2:02:42] prosper in everything that you do. Oh,
[2:02:45] glory to God. We thank God for the
[2:02:48] cloud. We thank God for the message and
[2:02:51] not only one message but a message that
[2:02:54] summarize everything. What Paul had,
[2:02:57] what Aranius had, what Luther and Martin
[2:03:00] put together and given unto us by one.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; My brother, let's humble
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; under the message of Yahweh.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; This man
[2:03:15] usually think we just left the airport.
[2:03:17] So keep your seat belt. The airplane is
[2:03:19] still going.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; This man think he knows more
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; than seven men.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; He knows more than Christ.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Matthew 25. Then we
[2:03:37] finish our reading.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; You will still keep your Bible
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; cuz we're going to dive into something
[2:03:51] here.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Your board is filling up quick.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew 25, very familiar. Again, wisdom
[2:04:05] versus foolishness.
[2:04:08] Then shall what?
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Continue, my friend.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Be likened unto 10 virgins,
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; which took their lamps,
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and went forth to meet the
[2:04:16] bridegroom.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And five of them were how
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; wise
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; it's wisdom. And five of them were how
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; foolish.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Now they that were foolish what?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Took their lamps.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; And took no oil with them.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; So there was a time of preparation.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; There was a season of preparation
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; before meeting the bridegroom.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; And in the season of preparation,
[2:04:41] somebody was working.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And somebody else was not working.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And the wise were working,
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; but the foolish were not working.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; But both of them were given the same
[2:04:54] season.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; But one took advantage
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; of the time of preparation
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; to prepare for the future meeting of the
[2:05:04] bride.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible say they that were foolish,
[2:05:12] verse three, took what? their lamps
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; and took what?
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; No oil with them.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; But the wise did what?
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Took oil in their vessels with their
[2:05:19] lamps.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Why did the wise took oil?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; What were the what what was going on in
[2:05:25] the wise?
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. They told them the bridegroom is
[2:05:31] coming.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; And for some reason they say the
[2:05:33] bridegroom is coming.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Okay, we all have the lamp.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Both the foolish and the wise have
[2:05:39] lamps. Yes.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; But the wise when they knew that the
[2:05:42] bridegroom was coming,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; the wise went and took an an extra oil,
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; a second oil.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Not the oil only in the lamp, but an oil
[2:05:54] for reserve
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; just in case.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, the wise virgin were not
[2:06:05] really looking at the time.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; They were looking at the average time.
[2:06:10] They were preparing beyond the time.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; They are in the summer, but they're
[2:06:17] looking at the winter.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; They are gathering in the summer, but
[2:06:22] they are preparing for the winter.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; If you come in the summer, they have
[2:06:28] oil.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; But if you come to the winter, they also
[2:06:32] have oil.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; But but with the foolish, when you come
[2:06:36] in the winter, there is no more oil.
[2:06:38] Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; So this wisdom is here demonstrated by
[2:06:45] the ability to foresee.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Let's stay put. Foresee the future and
[2:06:52] prepare for the future. And God called
[2:06:54] them wise.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Because if you notice, they were going
[2:06:58] to meet the bridegroom
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; in the evening
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; because the bridegroom came at midnight.
[2:07:08] Follow me my friend.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; They were going to meet the bridegroom
[2:07:12] in the evening. And there is a key that
[2:07:15] Jesus says.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of John
[2:07:18] chapter 9:4, Jesus say, "I must do
[2:07:21] what?"
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Work the works.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; The work of him that sent me while it's
[2:07:25] what?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; It is day.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; So work is only done during the day.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Forget about your job. I'm talking about
[2:07:37] work right here. Before some of you
[2:07:39] begin to get in trouble.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Those that work third shift, leave the
[2:07:42] third shift alone.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Jesus
[2:07:47] said, "Why is what day
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; and the night come
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; when no man can do what?"
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; So if you want to work, if you want to
[2:07:56] find the oil,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; you need to find the oil during the day.
[2:08:01] Because when the night will come, even
[2:08:04] the seller of the all will close.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Walmart will close the night.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Target will close the night.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; So if you want to get something, you
[2:08:15] better get it during the day.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is saying.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; But do you know when did the braon came?
[2:08:22] He came at midnight. And there is a
[2:08:25] mystery about midnight. The Bible says
[2:08:27] in the book of Luke 11:5, "And he said
[2:08:31] unto them, which of you shall have a
[2:08:34] what?
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; A friend."
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Remember this is a friend. And shall go
[2:08:37] unto him when
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; at midnight.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And say unto him what?
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Friend.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Lend me what?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Three loaves.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; For a friend of mine in his journeys
[2:08:47] come to me, and I have nothing to set
[2:08:49] before him. And he from within shall
[2:08:52] answer and say what?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Trouble me not.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; The door is how? now shut
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; and my children are away
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; with me in bed.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; I cannot rise and do it
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; and give thee.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; So midnight is the most unfortunate time
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; to get something even from your friend.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; And this is the time Jesus came.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; This is the time the bridegroom came. So
[2:09:18] if you need to get the all, get the all
[2:09:21] before midnight
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; because at midnight the store are
[2:09:25] closed.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Even your friend won't give it to you.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; There is a mystery about the coming of
[2:09:35] the bridegroom.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says this, glory
[2:09:39] to God. In the book of Mark 13:35,
[2:09:43] the Bible Jesus said, "Watch he ye
[2:09:45] therefore, for ye know not when
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; the master of the house coming."
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; So there is a time that the master can
[2:09:52] come. There is a window.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Ah
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; my friend, you can verify your Bible.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; There is four windows.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; The first window is what?
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; At evening.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; At evening. That's right.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; And this is what all the virgin were
[2:10:09] waiting.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know there were other
[2:10:13] season.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; And the wise work for the next season.
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; What is the next my friend?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; At midnight.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; So the bridegroom can come at what time?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Midnight.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; And in Matthew 25, when did he come?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Midnight.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; So there is a secret of the season
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; of the coming of the bridegroom. If he
[2:10:35] doesn't come at the evening,
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; watch the midnight.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you preparing for the
[2:10:42] evening,
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; prepare beyond evening
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; because he may come at midnight,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; which he did.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Midnight. The third one is what?
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Or at the crowing.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; At the crowing.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what else, my friend?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Or in the morning.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Or in the morning.
[2:11:04] D in the morning. Amen. So when they say
[2:11:08] go meet the bridegroom,
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; which season are you working on?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; The foolish were working for the
[2:11:15] evening.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; And the evening the bridegroom Terry
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; and they all slumber and slept
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and all the lamp were going out.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; And at midnight this is when the
[2:11:27] bridegroom came. So the one who had oil
[2:11:31] in reserve
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; for the oncoming season
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen sir
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; is the one that got inside
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; and got the bridegroom. Everybody that
[2:11:42] thought is going to happen right here
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; miss it. They had to go at midnight to
[2:11:47] try to find the old and the bridegroom
[2:11:49] came.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; So the virgin will prepare whether he
[2:11:53] come at midnight.
[2:11:56] If they come, if he come a roll,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; if he come in the morning, we don't need
[2:12:01] any more oil.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Because it's the day.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. You didn't
[2:12:10] get me, my friend.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. They got
[2:12:15] the oil for the evening.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; And the oil for the evening was
[2:12:19] finished. Then the second oil open up to
[2:12:23] keep them at the midnight all the way to
[2:12:26] the crocking. But in the morning we
[2:12:28] don't need oil anymore because it's a
[2:12:31] daylight. Now the bridegroom can come.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; They knew how to take opportunity.
[2:12:40] Take advantage of the season for another
[2:12:43] season.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; When God is doing something, watch your
[2:12:47] future.
[2:12:53] We are a prophetic people. A prophetic
[2:12:56] people. Look toward the
[2:13:00] hallelujah.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Turn your 45 minute on my friend.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; According to Ecclesiast
[2:13:10] 3:1, the Bible say to what?
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; There is what?
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; A season. Remember, this season is not
[2:13:17] your season,
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; but it's God's season for you.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; It is God's season for you
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; because it's God's season. Whatever he
[2:13:32] said must happen.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Whether people like it or not,
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; whether the time is good or not,
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; the clock is not our clock.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; The clock is his clock. If he find me in
[2:13:46] the wilderness, he will create squirrel.
[2:13:50] [Applause]
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; To everything that is under this earth,
[2:13:59] there is a time.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say in Genesis 8:22, while
[2:14:06] the earth does what
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; is going on? Sea time
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; and harvest
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; and cold and water and heat and water
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; and summer and water and winter and
[2:14:15] water
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; and day and water and night shall never
[2:14:18] cease.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; This is God's program.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; It revolve all the time.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; You will have season going on over and
[2:14:26] over until you get to eternity.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Bham say that everything
[2:14:34] comes right in its season. Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; To everything,
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; there is a season.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a season, but it's
[2:14:45] God's season for your life.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; And now we call it because it's God's
[2:14:49] season for my life. I call that my
[2:14:52] season.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, my divine season,
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; my Godgiving season has stood the test.
[2:15:01] Therefore, my season have come to be
[2:15:04] blessed.
[2:15:05] And in the season, everything comes
[2:15:08] right.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; In the season, you don't push.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; You don't force because it's not you
[2:15:16] doing the work. It is God doing the work
[2:15:19] in his own season.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when the noise
[2:15:26] of a man pleases the Lord, he make even
[2:15:29] at peace his enemy. God will move
[2:15:31] everything. Even if it's the Red Sea, he
[2:15:34] will pardon. If it's the Jordan, he will
[2:15:37] pardon. If it's the world, he will bring
[2:15:40] them down.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the time has come.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Why is everything happening nice in a
[2:15:53] season?
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Why does it happen right in a season?
[2:15:56] Brother Brandham said, "Do you believe
[2:15:58] that?"
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "What?"
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Everything
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; you plant the wheat. Now
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; in the fall of the year,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; in the spring of the year, it does what?
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; It brings itself forward.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Or what?
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; God brings it forth.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; The key behind the season, it's God
[2:16:10] doing the work.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; It is no longer you doing the work. Even
[2:16:14] if you are doing the work, it is God in
[2:16:16] you
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; who's doing the work.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; It is God in me now who's doing the
[2:16:21] preaching.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Because the time of the preaching has
[2:16:24] come.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; It is no longer me.
[2:16:28] I was not feeling good but now I feel
[2:16:30] good because the God Almighty has come
[2:16:34] to use the vessel.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; In other word when you going in season
[2:16:46] it's automatic shift my friend.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; You don't go one two. No no no no no no.
[2:16:52] It's automatic. You just put drive and
[2:16:54] all you do you put the foot on the
[2:16:56] pedal. And sometime you can even put a
[2:16:59] cruise control
[2:17:01] and you let the car run itself because
[2:17:03] somebody's driving the car.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I learn in this world I
[2:17:10] learn a long time. My life is not my
[2:17:13] own.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; So I put my life in you. You take me and
[2:17:18] lead me.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because even though I
[2:17:24] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[2:17:27] death, I feel no evil, God is with me.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother says this, my
[2:17:43] friend. He said Jesus was speaking. He
[2:17:45] says what?
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Fatherhu,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; the time has come.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Now there is a season for what?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You saw when
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; in a certain season
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; and you reap when
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; in a certain season
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; now there is a season when what
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; the time comes
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; right that's the time comes that is
[2:18:03] right for what
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; things to happen
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; season bring the right time
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; for certain things to happen
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; when it's the season the time have come
[2:18:19] for something to happen
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; are Are we together?
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Even if the delivery make a mistake.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Because it's the seasonal,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; everything will work together for good.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Why is all the supernatural things
[2:18:39] happen? Because it's the season.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to this with brother Brham.
[2:18:54] Brother Branam say we pray what
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; this prayer
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; because we know
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; what do we know
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; that it what
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; is in season
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; because I know that it's a season.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; I'm praying.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I'm praying.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Some of the prayer
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; are answered after
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; because it was not the season.
[2:19:21] That's why sometime you pray
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; something nothing happen.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Sometime you pray automatically boom
[2:19:29] because it's the time
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; and you get frustrated. You say I pray
[2:19:38] yesterday nothing happened. So God
[2:19:40] doesn't hear me. That's not the case.
[2:19:42] God always answer prayer but God work
[2:19:45] with a season. If it's a season,
[2:19:47] automatic response.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Pam said, because we know that
[2:19:54] it's what
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; is in season.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; For that said, I will I will I will with
[2:20:00] thee even to the what?
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; The end of the world.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; The things that I do shall owe you also,
[2:20:05] even greater. For I go to who?
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; My father.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; I know that we are praying right
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; because thou has always desired to do
[2:20:14] what?
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Fulfill thy word. You watch over it to
[2:20:17] do what?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Finally.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, brother Brandham is
[2:20:19] telling God, anoint the season.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; And if the season you send your word, it
[2:20:25] won't return to you back.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; He must accomplish that which you send
[2:20:29] because the season has come.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; And because it's the season, I know I'm
[2:20:34] praying right.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a type of faith
[2:20:37] that is not coming from you.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; It is the faith of the season.
[2:20:44] If somebody is sitting beside you, they
[2:20:46] will think you crazy
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; because you are believing the
[2:20:49] impossible.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Leave me alone. It's not your season. It
[2:20:54] is my season. Let me take God and his
[2:20:58] life.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Brother says God deal with the gentile
[2:21:14] individual.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; We might be twins
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; but we are individual.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; So when I'm entering my season, don't
[2:21:23] disturb me. work for your season. Let me
[2:21:27] believe God for what he promised me.
[2:21:31] What he said must happen because it's
[2:21:34] the season.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said I must not stand
[2:21:46] on the way of somebody who want to take
[2:21:49] God at his word.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Stay with your internet. me my season.
[2:21:56] Money or no money, I have the creator of
[2:21:59] everything. I have all the God that
[2:22:04] possess everything. He will be there for
[2:22:07] me because in the season everything
[2:22:10] comes right. Oh, glory to God.
[2:22:13] Hallelujah.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:21] When you praying,
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; when you praying and you feel that
[2:22:25] anointing coming up,
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; don't leave
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; because it's no longer you.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; It's a different gift from heaven.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Let him pray.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. There are sometime we pray
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; and we forcing
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; but there are sometime you just start
[2:22:44] praying
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; and you feel like it's an automatic
[2:22:48] pilot that is taking you my friend don't
[2:22:50] get out.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Stay right there and pray it on.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because it's not you
[2:22:58] praying. It is the spirit of the Lord in
[2:23:01] your life that is praying.
[2:23:08] If the anointing fall on the church
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; and they are worshiping, don't run away.
[2:23:14] Stay right there. It's a season.
[2:23:18] Stay there. Take advantage of the
[2:23:22] anointing. Take advantage of the season.
[2:23:31] Hallelujah. Our busy schedule have
[2:23:35] blocked our blessing because we're
[2:23:38] looking at the clock. We're looking at
[2:23:39] the clock. We're looking at the clock.
[2:23:42] You're going to go out and face that
[2:23:43] same demon. But I want to be like Jacob
[2:23:47] when I catch the angel. I'm not going to
[2:23:50] let you go. I'm not going to let you go
[2:23:53] until you bless me.
[2:23:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't know.
[2:24:03] Oh, glory to God.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know when I will see the angel
[2:24:08] again.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe this is the only time I met the
[2:24:12] angel of the Lord.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; You can fire me, but I must deal with
[2:24:16] the angel. Change me.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; A man overcame God.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; A man who knew how to seize opportunity.
[2:24:30] Do you know what? Even God himself punch
[2:24:33] him
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; to discourage him,
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; but he says no. Even though you slay me,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; yet I trust you.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Taking advantage of the season.

[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; inside the tree.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; You don't go to the apple tree
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; and you say apple tree we want to add
[2:25:47] the apple.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; The apple are there.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; If you open the tree you won't see the
[2:25:54] apple
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; but they are there.
[2:25:57] Just wait for the season
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; and sometime that tree may go through
[2:26:01] winter
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; and it look like there is no leaf
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; but the apple are there.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; You say tree how are you doing? He say
[2:26:09] I'm doing okay.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; The apple are there.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Because by the problem say in winter the
[2:26:14] life goes into the root.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; The root is a protection against winter
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; and you have a root
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; and the offspring of death.
[2:26:28] In other words, there is a part in your
[2:26:30] life that the devil won't enter.
[2:26:33] [Applause]
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; There is a part of your life where the
[2:26:41] devil won't enter.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; The devil can move. He can move. He can
[2:26:47] who move in which a time they say
[2:26:49] authorized personnel only.
[2:26:53] You are not authorized in this area.
[2:26:56] This area is an area of deity. Only God
[2:27:00] enter here
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; because you can cut it branch,
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; you can destroy everything, but as long
[2:27:12] as the root is there,
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; the root can rebuild the whole tree.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Because everything, all things is in the
[2:27:19] root.
[2:27:24] Are we together?
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; So the tree got every apple.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Not every apple for one season.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Every apple for the lifetime
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; of the tree is inside the tree.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; But those apple don't come out all at
[2:27:41] one time and one time. That's why don't
[2:27:43] expect everything you want to happen in
[2:27:46] one time.
[2:27:47] God knows when is the right time to give
[2:27:50] you what you just drink and push out.
[2:27:54] Drink and push out. Drink and push out.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? I'm listening to the
[2:28:00] message. I'm reading my Bible. I am
[2:28:03] praying. I am going to church. Suddenly
[2:28:06] a season open up. Everything is rolling
[2:28:10] with my strength, with the strength of
[2:28:13] almighty God.
[2:28:18] Hallelujah.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Why do we push?
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Why do we struggle?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; Relax, my friend.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; All is well. Shalom.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Everything is okay.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen, I already put my
[2:28:30] petition.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; We found out that everything
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; that the tree needed
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; is in the tree.
[2:28:44] But the Bible say the fruit don't come
[2:28:46] up all the all the time.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; The fruit come up when
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; in the season.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; So if the tree is not in the season
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; did you ever seen did this tree
[2:28:58] complaining to you?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; No
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; that this is winter.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have any fruit in winter.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; No they are crown
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; because they know their circle.
[2:29:12] Yes sir.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Can I say something?
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; He won't offend you, right?
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Every egg a woman has
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; is born with her a child birth.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Every m she releases,
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; do you control that?
[2:29:38] There is an intelligence
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; that is controlling your body.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Tell that intelligence control my heart
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; so my heart will beat good control my
[2:29:52] kidney control my leg control my back.
[2:29:57] Control my shoulder
[2:30:01] because I know you controlling my body.
[2:30:07] Hallelujah.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; God is already working in you.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; We want to feel the chills.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Who make you breathe?
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Do you tell your heart to be?
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; When you sleep, who's protecting your
[2:30:26] heart?
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; And it's always on time. Who who who's
[2:30:30] there?
[2:30:33] Why is Satan not doing anything when
[2:30:35] you're sleeping?
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Because the angel of the Lord can't run
[2:30:40] those that fear him.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; So according to Psalm 1,
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; according to Psalm 1 verse three,
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; the fruit
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; comes when?
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; In season.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:01] So you cannot go to the tree
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; on the on the uh I mean in winter
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; and say tree I need the fruit.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; The tree will look at you and say
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; you miss the season.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; On you produce fruit and water.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; But I have a news for you.
[2:31:23] [Music]
[2:31:27] What is the what is what is the surprise
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; in Mark?
[2:31:44] In Mark 11
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; verse 12,
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; the creator
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; The one who created the season.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; The one who is behind the season.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; The one who knows the season.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; He got hungry.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; You want to go home?
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; He got hungry. The Bible say and on the
[2:32:12] water
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; when they were come from what
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; he was what?
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hungry
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; and seeing a water
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; a big tree
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; a far off having water
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; leaves.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; If the tree have leaves which season are
[2:32:24] we in
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; spring
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get today
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; we got a tree.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Having what? Please,
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; the tree is in springtime.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Do you have fruit in spring?
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; We can take this different direction, my
[2:32:49] friend.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; You might be a treeh
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; because it's a fig tree
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; and the tree have leaves. In the garden
[2:32:59] of Eden, when Adam and Eve sinned,
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; they went to the fig tree
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; and they got the leaves to cover
[2:33:06] themselves,
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; which was religion.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; In in Genesis 1,
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; they didn't leave. No, they didn't need
[2:33:15] any covering.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; But they were naked,
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; but they didn't know it.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; But in Genesis 2, even though they put
[2:33:22] covering,
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; they still remember they were naked.
[2:33:26] So God clothing was better than that.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; So we found the fig tree having leaves
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; and Jesus came and cursed the tree.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; He cursed religion.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; That's one angle.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; The tree also fig tree represent Israel.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; That's also another angle. Let me leave
[2:33:50] those angle.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Let me maneuver the airplane into a
[2:33:53] different angle. Our end goal today is
[2:33:56] this because brother Bham say scripture
[2:33:59] has accompanied me that free me my
[2:34:02] friend
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; that one free me because I know now that
[2:34:07] since the seventh seal is open I can get
[2:34:10] a different angle
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; because scripture I loaded
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; scripture have layers
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; let's look at this angle s
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; the tree is the heaven leaves Amen. And
[2:34:25] he Jesus if what came
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; perhaps
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; he may find what?
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Anything there on
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; if he can find some fruit there.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; And when he came to it he found what?
[2:34:38] Nothing but
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; but what
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; because
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; for the time
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; of the fig was not what
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; whose fault is it?
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; Was it the fault of the tree?
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; The tree accord
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; the tree according to someone
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; it produce fruit. So Jesus should know
[2:35:09] better.
[2:35:10] [Applause]
[2:35:22] Shake somebody's hand. Tell him, "Are
[2:35:24] you still awake?"
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; If you refocus, you tell me.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; If you refocus, you say, "Amen."
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:41] Now, how can the creator
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; the creator
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; who created all things
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; who laid out the season
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; miss the season
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; and go into a tree
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; when it's not the time
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; when it's not the season
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; of the fruit yet
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; and Jesus went to look for the fruit
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; and when he command
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; that there is no fruit
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; because it's not the time
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; instead of sparing the tree
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; and say ah I remember
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; you only produce fruit
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; in season
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; no Jesus didn't do that
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; he turned around
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; and the third pool anointed Am
[2:36:39] I saying something different? The
[2:36:41] thirdpool anointing came
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; and Jesus spoke the word
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; and touched that tree.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; And father pam say he was preaching the
[2:36:55] gospel to that tree
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; because tomorrow on the tomorrow when
[2:37:00] they came up
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; the tree has wither away
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; and the disciples said look at that
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; and Jesus open up the third pool. He
[2:37:09] said if you say to this mountain
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; be moved
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; the mountain will move
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; if you don't that in your heart
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; but my problem is
[2:37:27] the creator should be coming in season
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; let's nail it again
[2:37:38] Brother Bradam says this. He said, "And
[2:37:40] then when he was going, he found water,
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; a fig tree."
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; The next morning that the tree had
[2:37:46] water,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; leaves on it.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; And he thought
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; perhaps
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; he will find what?
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Some figs.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; So he went to get what?
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Some figs
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; in the wrong season.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; And there was what?
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; No figs on it.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Because it was not what
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; season yet.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; And he said to the tree, "No man eat it
[2:38:06] from the h forth.
[2:38:09] Brother Steven,
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; fruit comes when?
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus went out of season.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Fruit comes in season.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; According to Mark, he went out of
[2:38:25] season.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; And because nothing was out of season,
[2:38:32] he open up the spoken word.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; What are you trying to get us to?
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Now we begin to understand something
[2:38:43] different.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; That God is in season and out of season.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, my time. My time, my
[2:39:03] friend.
[2:39:10] Are we together?
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; God is not only the God of the season.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; He's also out of season.
[2:39:36] Open the book of Matthew.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Matthew,
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; chapter 10.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Matthew, chapter 10.
[2:39:50] Oh my god, my friend. The airplane is
[2:39:53] way up there
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to begin to come down.
[2:39:59] [Laughter]
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 10, my friend.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; My friend,
[2:40:15] this is in and what?
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; Out. If I unload what I have here, you
[2:40:21] will stay here two more hours.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; You are right here.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; You are right here.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; We still have this.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; So don't worry, my friend.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, stretch your belly.
[2:40:50] We ready?
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. My friend, it's Labor
[2:40:54] Day. We ready?
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; We ready?
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; If you pass out, we go CPR.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 10, my friend.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:5. If you there, you can say
[2:41:08] amen.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; It's the opening of the seals.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Verse five, my friend. Let's go. These
[2:41:18] 12 Jesus did what?
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Sent forth.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus is in and what?
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Out of season.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; He says these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[2:41:27] commanded them, saying what?
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
[2:41:32] into any city of the Samaritans, enter
[2:41:35] ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep
[2:41:38] of the house of Israel.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; Let's push the brake a little bit. Keep
[2:41:41] your finger right there, okay? Because
[2:41:43] I'm going to read it again. Go to John
[2:41:46] 1.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; Keep your finger right there.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Go to John 1.
[2:41:52] This must shock some of you.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; John 1 chapter 11. If you there, you can
[2:41:56] say amen.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible say what?
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; He came unto his own.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; Who came?
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; He came to what?
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; His own.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; And his own did what?
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; Receive him now.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Stop. Let's read it again. He came to
[2:42:09] who?
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; His own. So when Jesus came on the first
[2:42:12] coming, he came for who?
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; The Jews.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; For the who?
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; The Jews.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't come for you.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; We clear now?
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; We clear now. So let's go to Matthew. So
[2:42:24] according to John 1 verse 11,
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus came to the to Israel.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; To the Jews. And as a matter of fact, it
[2:42:34] was the Jews that were waiting for the
[2:42:35] Messiah.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; Not me and you.
[2:42:38] [Applause]
[2:42:40] Only the Jews and the Samaritans
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; knew about the Messiah.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Me, all the Gentile didn't know anything
[2:42:47] about the Messiah.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; We were not even Christian.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; We were hidden.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; We were worshiping Adam.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't come to us.
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; He came to the Jew.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; He came to his own.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. Now in verse 5,
[2:43:04] these two have Jesus sent for and
[2:43:07] commanded them saying go not in the way
[2:43:09] of what?
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; The gentile.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Who's talking to the disciple?
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling the disciple listen
[2:43:15] when you preach the gospel don't preach
[2:43:17] to the gentile.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Don't don't go to Gastonia.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; Don't go to North Carolina.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Don't go to the United States.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; Stay in Israel.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. So the so so so the
[2:43:32] maker himself
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; is determining the season.
[2:43:38] Amen.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; It's clear the season is a Jewish
[2:43:42] season.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is putting landmark.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Not to cross.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Don't go to the gentile.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend.
[2:43:53] Uh uh go to the gentile and into what?
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Any city of the Samaritan.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Not a city. Any city
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; of the Samaritan. Don't go. In other
[2:44:03] words, because there are three group of
[2:44:04] people. I already gave you the scripture
[2:44:06] in the hotel. We got the what?
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Jews.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; The Jew. We got who?
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; Samaritans.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; We got the Samaritan. And we got who?
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; Gentiles.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; The Gentile.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus say go only to the Jew.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; Don't go to the Samaritan. Don't go to
[2:44:23] the Gentile because he came to water
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; and his own water
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Jew.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; So the season is the season of who?
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; The Jews.
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus continued. He says verse 6, but go
[2:44:36] right away where
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; to the lost sheep of the house of
[2:44:38] Israel.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, precision
[2:44:41] you only preach to the lost sheep of the
[2:44:45] house of Israel. Period. So the first
[2:44:48] coming of the Lord
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; was restricted for the Jewish nation.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly, my friend.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; But God is in season.
[2:45:03] and also out of season.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; The Jews were waiting for him.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; The Samaritan by being under the Jewish
[2:45:14] religion was also waiting for the
[2:45:16] Samaritan.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Was also waiting for the Messiah.
[2:45:20] Remember the woman at the well.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; But the Gentile were not waiting for
[2:45:24] him.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; But I got a news for you.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Go to Matthew 15.
[2:45:30] Amen.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Go to verse 21.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; Matthew 15.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:21.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus went forth from there
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; and departed where?
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; The ghost of water. Tire and sit on.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; Tire and what?
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Sit on.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Was that Israel?
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; So what was he doing in the gentile
[2:46:05] land? If he doesn't have anything to do
[2:46:08] with the gentile
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; according to the to the word of Jesus
[2:46:17] Christ, Jesus should stay within the
[2:46:20] borders of Israel.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; He himself venture out.
[2:46:30] Somebody's not catching it.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; This is Israel.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Tar and Soden are somewhere there
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; where Lebanon is.
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm not mistaken, Jesus should
[2:46:43] be moving over here.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; For some reason, here it's a season.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; For some reason, Jesus venture out.
[2:46:58] Are we together?
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; But the season is not for the gentile,
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; but because he venture out of season.
[2:47:07] [Music]
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; Verse 22.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; And behold, a what?
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; A woman,
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; a church.
[2:47:25] A woman of water
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; came in
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; came out of him
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; in the water.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; The same coast.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; She came out from where?
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; The same coast.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible say she was a sorrow
[2:47:35] Phoenician woman.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; A gentile woman
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; came out.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; Say you venture in this land.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; You doomed.
[2:47:51] I don't know if we're together.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; You should stay in Israel. But because
[2:47:56] you move out of Israel,
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; welcome.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Welcome.
[2:48:02] There is no
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Verse 22. And he came
[2:48:10] and did what?
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; And cried to him, saying what?
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; You who? Thou son of David,
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; my daughter is what?
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Previously back,
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; she's using the season of the Jew.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; Son of David,
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; but it was not her season.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding. He's using
[2:48:33] the season of the Jew, but it was not
[2:48:36] her season.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; She begin to use the language of the
[2:48:40] season.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; Verse 23, what happened?
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; But he answered her not a word.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus did what?
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; Answered her not a word.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; It was not her season.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; It was not her season.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus ignore her
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; because it's not your season.
[2:49:14] Me and you,
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; we would have quit.
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; Me and you, we would have left the
[2:49:22] church of Jesus.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus met a different breed.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; He was not a Jewish breed.
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; He was not a Samaritan breed. It was the
[2:49:40] gentile where he said don't preach to
[2:49:43] them.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; The gentile say you trespass.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; You came on my territory.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't go to you. You the one that
[2:49:54] came in my territory. You trespass.
[2:50:06] Are we together? Are we together? And
[2:50:09] Jesus want to push out and he ignore
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; sometime it seems like his service when
[2:50:17] you are praying but don't give up
[2:50:21] remember who you are.
[2:50:25] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:50:28] together? I'm showing you the behavior
[2:50:31] of Gentile.
[2:50:36] [Applause]
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 23.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; Verse 23.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 23. But Jesus did what?
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; Answered her not a word.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; And his disciple came and said, "What?"
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; And besought him,
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; saying, "What?
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Send her away.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; Push, push the brake." Why did the
[2:51:00] disciple told Jesus send her away?
[2:51:03] Because the Because the woman was not
[2:51:05] stopping.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus ignore her.
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; But instead of the woman looking and
[2:51:10] say, "Ignore me." The woman was not
[2:51:12] stopping. She was continuing. Son of
[2:51:14] David. Son of David. Listen, you are the
[2:51:18] son of David. You trespass here. Son of
[2:51:20] David. Son of David.
[2:51:25] Are we together? Are we together? Jesus
[2:51:28] is walking around. Son of David, I know
[2:51:30] who you are. Son of David. Son of David.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe.
[2:51:42] Are we together?
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe she went to the ear of Jesus. Son
[2:51:47] of David. You can ignore me all you
[2:51:50] want. Son of David. Son of David. Son of
[2:51:54] David.
[2:52:00] I don't know if we together. In other
[2:52:03] words, in other words, this is my
[2:52:06] opportunity.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Because Because the footstep of the
[2:52:15] righteous,
[2:52:18] [Applause]
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; you made a mistake. You trespass this
[2:52:22] way.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; And the disciple look, they say, "Ah,
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; this is a noisy woman right here."
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; Instead of the disciple,
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; instead of the deacon,
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; instead of the deacon,
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; the disciple
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; doing the job
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; to push the woman away,
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; the disciple could not do it.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; So the woman was more powerful than the
[2:52:48] disciple.
[2:52:52] That's why the disciple call for
[2:52:55] national guard
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; this time. Jesus please deal with me.
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are trying but this
[2:53:02] step is stubborn.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; My friend, the disciple were the
[2:53:11] disciple of Jesus Christ.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; If the woman is troubling them, what
[2:53:15] should they have? take the woman away
[2:53:17] and say, "Sister, you stop coming up
[2:53:19] here."
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; But the disciple could not do it.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; They tried, they cannot. So they went to
[2:53:24] Jesus. They say, "Please, since you are
[2:53:26] the one she's following,
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; please give her n her
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; so she can go.
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:35] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?"
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; Verse 24.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; For she cries after after her. Verse 24.
[2:53:41] But hear and say what? I am not sent but
[2:53:45] unto the lost sheep of the house of God.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; He's answering who?
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; Finally, Jesus opened up his mouth.
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Remember all this time Jesus mouth was
[2:53:57] quiet.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; It was a silence.
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; All that the woman was looking for is to
[2:54:05] open the silence.
[2:54:11] You didn't get me my friend. The woman
[2:54:14] was pressing for Jesus to open his mouth
[2:54:18] because there was service.
[2:54:21] The servant seal was locked. So she was
[2:54:24] just waiting for the seals to open up.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? If
[2:54:35] Jesus
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; would have stayed quiet,
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; it would have been better.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus make again.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; Inverted comeras a big mistake.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; He opened his mouth
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; and whatever come out of his mouth he
[2:54:52] cannot take it back.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus opened his mouth
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; and what is he saying?
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; He says I am not sent but to what?
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; The lost sheep of the house. In other
[2:55:04] words, he's telling the woman, "I'm not
[2:55:06] sent for you.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; This is not your season."
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; But he's a God of season and out of
[2:55:16] season.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; Did the woman stop?
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; The woman changed.
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't know me yet."
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:31] Then verse 25, what happened?
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; She came and worshiped him.
[2:55:35] &gt;&gt; She came and what?
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; Worship him.
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; She came and did what?
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; Worship him.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; What exactly did she do?
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; She say, "I know you, God. Let me
[2:55:45] worship you."
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, every weapon I'm going
[2:55:52] to use.
[2:55:55] &gt;&gt; If this doesn't work,
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; this is going to work.
[2:56:01] Are we together?
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; Fight attend and prepare for landing.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; He says and he say he worship him and
[2:56:08] say what?
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; Lord help me.
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:56:15] finally she used the right approach.
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; So she's going to get what she needed.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Watch again
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; because it's not her season.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; And but he answer and say what
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; it is not meat
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; children's bread. Uh-huh.
[2:56:29] &gt;&gt; He cast it to the dog.
[2:56:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus struck back again
[2:56:33] &gt;&gt; and said, "You don't understand this is
[2:56:35] not your season. As a matter of fact,
[2:56:37] you a dog
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; and what you asking is the children's
[2:56:41] bread
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; and you are a dog.
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; I cannot give it to you. This is not
[2:56:47] your season."
[2:56:49] &gt;&gt; The woman said that was your last
[2:56:51] mistake.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; Please confirmation now. Now that's it.
[2:56:56] I lock you on the first, on the second,
[2:56:59] on the third. That's what I was looking
[2:57:01] for.
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know a mystery."
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; You already open your mouth. Do you know
[2:57:07] a mystery?
[2:57:08] &gt;&gt; You know the dog have a mystery.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; They don't eat the bread.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; Because when the children eat bread,
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; crabs are falling.
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; The thunderers,
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; they lose end.
[2:57:22] When the children are eating, there is a
[2:57:24] loose end. lose food. The seven ters are
[2:57:29] losing in sle.
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Because throughout the ages, there were
[2:57:44] mystery that had been lost.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; There were food that were lost.
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; When the children were eating and the
[2:57:50] Malachi for when he comes, he gather not
[2:57:53] the bread.
[2:57:54] [Music]
[2:57:55] the loose end.
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; So the gentile look for the loose end.
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; That's why the seven seat is important
[2:58:02] for us
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; because he brings the thunder
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; and the thunders open the door out of
[2:58:12] season.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; What happened to the woman? Jesus told
[2:58:23] her, "It's not your season.
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; I am not sent for you. I'm sent for the
[2:58:28] lost sheep of Israel. This is not your
[2:58:30] season." She could have turned around
[2:58:32] and go and Jesus struck her with the
[2:58:34] last one.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; You a dog.
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; She didn't say he he he uh uh what you
[2:58:41] mediating me.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; She said no. Everything that come from
[2:58:45] your mouth
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; is right. I'm going to show you that I
[2:58:49] don't take beating like that.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; Since you say dog,
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; look at the mystery.
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; When the mystery hit Jesus,
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus forgot in the season.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; He forgot that it was the season of the
[2:59:07] Jews.
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, he says, and she said what?
[2:59:13] Truth, Lord. Yet what
[2:59:15] &gt;&gt; the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
[2:59:18] from the master's table.
[2:59:19] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus answered and saying to her,
[2:59:22] "What?"
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh woman,
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; what
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; great is thy faith.
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; So what type of faith is that one?
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; And that great faith was found where
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; and who are you this morning?
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; What is God finding in you?
[2:59:47] Amen.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; And oh woman, great is your faith.
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; Be it what?
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; Unto thee.
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; As you what?
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; Will.
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; Who's willing?
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; God or the woman.
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; The woman. My brother problem say this
[3:00:02] woman is a type of antiight.
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; And her daughter was what?
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; Made whole
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; when
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; from that very hour.
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; And why? Because a woman, a gentile
[3:00:18] approached Jesus out of season
[3:00:24] [Music]
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; and he opened up the temple.
[3:00:28] And one day Jesus was entering somewhere
[3:00:31] and a Roman cention came in.
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; Another gentile.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; It was not the time of the gentile. The
[3:00:42] Roman centurion came entering. And he
[3:00:45] said, "Lord,
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; I got a problem in my home."
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus turned around. He said, "I will
[3:00:54] come." He said, "Stop. You don't need to
[3:00:55] come this way. You are dealing with a
[3:00:57] different breed.
[3:00:59] &gt;&gt; We don't need laying on hand.
[3:01:02] Speak the word.
[3:01:04] Speak the word. I know we are out of
[3:01:07] season because we are out of season. Out
[3:01:11] of season. Open the spoken word.
[3:01:19] And me and you, we are gentile. And God
[3:01:23] left the Jews.
[3:01:29] Let me say something.
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; In the time of the Jews,
[3:01:33] &gt;&gt; in the season of the Jews,
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; God opened the third pool.
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; And he turned around. He said, "And
[3:01:39] there's never seen such a great faith."
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; Not even in in Israel. Those great faith
[3:01:46] are always found in the Gentiles.
[3:01:50] And those great faith push the master
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; out of season.
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? To get what they want.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; But today Jesus left the Jews.
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; Now he said the Gentile is at the
[3:02:06] season. We could take something from
[3:02:09] Jesus. How about now in the season of
[3:02:12] the Gentile?
[3:02:21] Are we together? Are we together? Some
[3:02:24] of you didn't get me.
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; Your example in the Bible is a man and a
[3:02:29] woman. It's a man and a woman. It's a
[3:02:32] brother and a sister. Brother Santion
[3:02:36] and Sister Sophian went out of season
[3:02:39] and they took what they wanted. Now it
[3:02:42] is not the Jewish season. It is our
[3:02:45] season.
[3:02:47] If God can do that out of season, how
[3:02:50] much more in season? Whatever you have
[3:02:53] need of us, speak the word.
[3:02:57] Speak the word. Take God and his word.
[3:03:02] Hallelujah. Why? Because it's the
[3:03:05] season.
[3:03:11] [Applause]
[3:03:14] Hallelujah.
[3:03:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:03:18] Hallelujah.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I'm going to drop the
[3:03:34] airplane. I'm going straight to the
[3:03:36] airport and I'm going to hit the tarmac.
[3:03:38] I'm going to skip certain things here
[3:03:40] quickly. We pick them up on Sunday, but
[3:03:42] let me drop the airplane with this.
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this and I'm going to
[3:03:55] jump the airplane with this. Brother
[3:03:58] says this. He said, "Don't know their
[3:04:00] day."
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:02] &gt;&gt; They don't know their day. The ox does
[3:04:04] what
[3:04:05] &gt;&gt; knows his master. And the mule knows
[3:04:07] what
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; knows the star.
[3:04:08] &gt;&gt; But my people knows not.
[3:04:11] &gt;&gt; Say God. That is water.
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; They don't know the day
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; of their visitation.
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; It's the finest things to try or the
[3:04:21] water.
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Strangest thing
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; to get God's people to see the day of
[3:04:26] their visitation.
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; Your time
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; of the gentile.
[3:04:32] You are waiting for the rapture,
[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; but you're going to regret it. My
[3:04:36] friend,
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; I must say this just now because the
[3:04:40] Holy Spirit seems to be pulling this uh
[3:04:43] uh seems to be putting it on my heart.
[3:04:45] Be what?
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; Careful.
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Be what?
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; Careful.
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Satan
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; will try to do what?
[3:04:53] &gt;&gt; Tell you of something great.
[3:04:54] &gt;&gt; To tell you of something great way
[3:04:57] &gt;&gt; off in another age to come.
[3:05:03] You didn't get it.
[3:05:05] &gt;&gt; Brother say be careful
[3:05:07] &gt;&gt; because Satan will always point you way
[3:05:10] up
[3:05:11] &gt;&gt; because Satan don't want you to see the
[3:05:13] season you go into
[3:05:18] &gt;&gt; because Satan knows if you cross your
[3:05:21] season you lost your blessings.
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says he wants you to see
[3:05:29] something where
[3:05:30] &gt;&gt; great
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; where
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; way off in another age to come
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; or another what
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; coming along of another revival
[3:05:36] &gt;&gt; and you may be living in the last part
[3:05:38] of it you ever get it may be how
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; now
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; in other words people are still telling
[3:05:43] you wait for the brand revival
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; wait for the brand revival so what is
[3:05:48] God doing now
[3:05:54] &gt;&gt; until the rapture will surprise you
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; because you missed the season.
[3:06:00] &gt;&gt; The seals were open in 63.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; How long are you going to wait for the
[3:06:05] bride revival?
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; Brother say, brother say the Pentecostal
[3:06:14] are praying.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; Let's fast and pray. Let's fast and
[3:06:17] pray. Brother Brandham came, he said,
[3:06:19] you know why they doing that?
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; Because they have not recognized
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; the awakening of the brother.
[3:06:26] So when the bride was awakening, people
[3:06:28] are still looking far away.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; Until your children are leaving home,
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; until your children are getting married.
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; You still waiting for the bride revival.
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; No, sir. The bride revival is on.
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; It's on right now.
[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; I am not waiting for something way up.
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; I'm in the season, my friend.
[3:06:51] Some of you are waiting for the for the
[3:06:54] persecution.
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; So you are holding your sickness until
[3:06:58] they start persecuting the church. No,
[3:07:01] I'm not holding my sickness right now.
[3:07:10] [Applause]
[3:07:14] Let's wait for the pressure of the
[3:07:16] euical concept so that we will see the
[3:07:19] third pool. So what happen you lay
[3:07:22] dormant
[3:07:23] &gt;&gt; when the third pool is there and brother
[3:07:26] say I want to declare to you the third
[3:07:28] pool is here.
[3:07:35] manifest the third pull anointing
[3:07:37] started before the opening of the seals.
[3:07:44] Brother created a squirrel before the
[3:07:46] opening of the seal. If the anointing
[3:07:50] was there before the opening of the
[3:07:51] seals, what do you think when the seals
[3:07:54] are open?
[3:08:00] &gt;&gt; It's the preacher. The preacher have
[3:08:04] limit the faith of the people. We told
[3:08:06] the people you can go all the way here.
[3:08:10] But in this church,
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; release God.
[3:08:17] Release God.
[3:08:18] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; To him that believe.
[3:08:24] &gt;&gt; It is a trick of the devil
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; to push you in hopes
[3:08:29] &gt;&gt; in the future. in the future.
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yesterday was a future.
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; Yesterday it was a future.
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; Today is which day?
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; Today is what?
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; Sunday.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yesterday was Saturday.
[3:08:45] &gt;&gt; On Friday, Sunday was future.
[3:08:48] &gt;&gt; On on on Friday, Saturday was future.
[3:08:52] &gt;&gt; But today on Sunday, Saturday is a past.
[3:08:55] &gt;&gt; So what you pushing in the future, it's
[3:08:57] going to be a past. Ah, I'm not going to
[3:09:00] wait for that. He's I am the God of the
[3:09:04] present time.
[3:09:09] He told Moses, you want to give them my
[3:09:12] name? Tell them I am. Not I was not I
[3:09:17] will be. I am. When I wake up in the
[3:09:20] morning, I am. When I'm driving my car,
[3:09:24] I am. I want God today.
[3:09:32] Hallelujah. Brother say you may be
[3:09:36] living in that it may be when
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; now
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; it's always been what
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; that way
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; they come and the revival is what
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; and they don't know it
[3:09:48] &gt;&gt; and they don't know it
[3:09:49] &gt;&gt; because because folks are waiting
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; let him finish to pray
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; then he's going to lay hands on me
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; and we did that to the people. So when
[3:09:59] you go to convention, everybody's just
[3:10:01] waiting for the prayer line,
[3:10:04] &gt;&gt; even those that on wheelchair are
[3:10:06] waiting for the prayer line
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; until the sermon is finished.
[3:10:11] &gt;&gt; No. The Bible say when Paul was
[3:10:13] preaching and he looked and he saw
[3:10:16] somebody that had faith to be healed,
[3:10:19] Paul told that person, you the rise up,
[3:10:23] receive your healing.
[3:10:28] And Paul was an apostle to the Gentile.
[3:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; In this church, don't wait for the end.
[3:10:38] &gt;&gt; When they are singing, you already got
[3:10:40] it. When I'm reading the Bible, you got
[3:10:43] it. When I'm preaching, you get it.
[3:10:48] So when the sermon is finished, I'm
[3:10:51] worshiping God for what he has done for
[3:10:53] me.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; That is the way it is. What
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; today?
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's always been. That is what it is.
[3:11:08] How? Now
[3:11:09] &gt;&gt; if we have only know the what
[3:11:11] &gt;&gt; the day of visitation
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; but the day of the visitation does what
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; goes right through
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; and the people are looking where
[3:11:18] &gt;&gt; way over here
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; for what
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; something else
[3:11:20] &gt;&gt; and the first thing you know the
[3:11:21] visitation is what
[3:11:23] &gt;&gt; over
[3:11:23] &gt;&gt; and there it is
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; because they poke a lot of stuff in your
[3:11:28] mind
[3:11:29] &gt;&gt; and then some are waiting for Los
[3:11:32] Angeles to go down
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham Okay.
[3:11:39] &gt;&gt; Everything that you have need of
[3:11:42] &gt;&gt; is where?
[3:11:42] &gt;&gt; In you.
[3:11:43] &gt;&gt; And brother say, even what?
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; The rapture.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; The rapture is where?
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; Did the rapture happen?
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; But the rapture is where?
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; So you don't worry about the rapture.
[3:11:53] &gt;&gt; You continue to live the life when the
[3:11:56] time of the rapture come. The rapture in
[3:11:58] me will meet the rapture of God. And the
[3:12:01] two rapture will meet together because
[3:12:04] the rapture will happen in it season. So
[3:12:06] since the rapture has not happened, let
[3:12:09] me take opportunity, take advantage of
[3:12:12] God now.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; Why am I taking adventure? Why am I
[3:12:20] taking adventure? Because the holy one
[3:12:22] have unfolded himself.
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; Because the presence of the Lord has
[3:12:26] come down.
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; Because the angel have trouble the
[3:12:29] water.
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; The water is troubling. and you are
[3:12:35] talking to me here. Leave me alone. Let
[3:12:38] me jump in the water to get my healing.
[3:12:41] After I get my healing, I will talk to
[3:12:44] you about my testimony because I took
[3:12:47] advantage of my season. Let's stop here,
[3:12:50] my friend. God bless you. Let's stand
[3:12:53] right here. Oh, glory to God.
[3:13:08] Amen.
[3:13:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; We stopped somewhere, my friend.
[3:13:19] &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it's taking
[3:13:20] advantage of the season or what you
[3:13:22] going to call it.
[3:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:25] &gt;&gt; But we have not gotten to taking
[3:13:27] advantage yet. We just on the surface of
[3:13:29] it.
[3:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:33] &gt;&gt; Let's keep that title. Maybe next Sunday
[3:13:35] we say seizing opportunity.
[3:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:40] &gt;&gt; Church.
[3:13:42] &gt;&gt; Get out the dreamland.
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; God is real.
[3:13:48] &gt;&gt; God is real.
[3:13:49] &gt;&gt; The God you read in the Bible
[3:13:51] &gt;&gt; is he he's real.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; He's not somewhere. He's here. Amen.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; How can you be staring at me giving you
[3:14:02] testimony all the time,
[3:14:05] brother?
[3:14:05] &gt;&gt; And you don't give your testimony.
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; Now, you going to put your eyes on me.
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; Like I have some type of special
[3:14:13] anointing.
[3:14:15] &gt;&gt; No, I don't want that.
[3:14:16] &gt;&gt; The anointing is in me and in you.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; We need to share testimonies.
[3:14:28] Hallelujah.
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:31] &gt;&gt; How can I sit and this one testifying
[3:14:34] and this one testifying and this one
[3:14:36] testifying and I'm sitting I say I'm
[3:14:38] waiting for the persecution to come.
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; So when the squeeze will come, oh
[3:14:42] brother, you will watch the third pull
[3:14:44] there.
[3:14:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham his wife got a tumor. Yes,
[3:14:52] sir.
[3:14:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait for the squeeze.
[3:14:57] &gt;&gt; He went to God
[3:14:59] &gt;&gt; and he spoke to God.
[3:15:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "This woman washed my clothing.
[3:15:02] She cooked for me. She did this, this,
[3:15:04] this, this." And God came down.
[3:15:07] &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright didn't wait for the
[3:15:08] persecution.
[3:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:14] &gt;&gt; Stop limiting the holy one.
[3:15:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:20] Do you think when you take the anointing
[3:15:22] today, then God uh will begin to
[3:15:24] decrease in anointing?
[3:15:27] &gt;&gt; Do you think when we go to the rapture
[3:15:29] now and the third pull is over, it's
[3:15:31] finished?
[3:15:33] &gt;&gt; It's an unlimited power.
[3:15:36] &gt;&gt; God is in season
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; and out of season.
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; If he came to search for the fruit out
[3:15:42] of season and they are not there, the
[3:15:44] spoken word open up.
[3:15:49] I will get to where Paul is telling the
[3:15:51] preacher. He said,
[3:15:52] &gt;&gt; Timothy,
[3:15:54] &gt;&gt; be what?
[3:15:56] &gt;&gt; Preach the word and be what?
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; Instant.
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; Instant when?
[3:15:59] &gt;&gt; Instant.
[3:16:00] &gt;&gt; And what? Where? Where? Why is Paul
[3:16:02] saying that?
[3:16:05] &gt;&gt; I will get to that Lord willing next
[3:16:06] Sunday. Why is Paul saying that? I have
[3:16:09] it right here.
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; I have it right here.
[3:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a gentile.
[3:16:17] &gt;&gt; You are not a Jew.
[3:16:19] &gt;&gt; You are not a Samaritan.
[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; You are a pure Gentile. And the Bible
[3:16:24] say he came to his own
[3:16:25] &gt;&gt; and his own receive him not.
[3:16:28] &gt;&gt; And the one who receive him is actually
[3:16:30] the Gentile.
[3:16:32] &gt;&gt; So you are more of a bride than the
[3:16:35] Jewish people.
[3:16:40] &gt;&gt; He's calling the people out of every
[3:16:42] tongue, every nation. Is that the Jews?
[3:16:44] &gt;&gt; No. It's after me. I'm gone. That's when
[3:16:47] he goes back to the Jews. But this is my
[3:16:50] time.
[3:16:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not in Israel.
[3:16:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here.
[3:16:57] &gt;&gt; When we leave, then the Holy Ghost goes
[3:16:59] to the Jews.
[3:17:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:17:05] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:17:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[3:17:09] afternoon.
[3:17:11] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; for your love,
[3:17:15] &gt;&gt; for your mercy,
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; and for everything you have been doing
[3:17:18] for us.
[3:17:20] &gt;&gt; Father, this is as far as you wanted me
[3:17:23] to go today with these thoughts, Lord.
[3:17:26] But Lord, Father, we are believing and
[3:17:29] we are confident
[3:17:31] &gt;&gt; that something was spoken
[3:17:34] that is helping your children,
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; strengthening, healing, removing all
[3:17:40] doubt and anxiety,
[3:17:43] all type of limitation put up by
[3:17:45] preacher about your children, Father, to
[3:17:49] access their promises.
[3:17:52] Lord, if in your day of your flesh,
[3:17:56] you could extend it a door to the
[3:18:00] Gentile
[3:18:01] &gt;&gt; to provide that which they needed.
[3:18:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:18:04] &gt;&gt; And this is not only in the New
[3:18:06] Testament,
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; even in the Old Testament when the
[3:18:10] deliverance that was promised to Israel,
[3:18:14] &gt;&gt; to the seed of Abraham
[3:18:17] &gt;&gt; came in through Moses. Father, as they
[3:18:21] were journeying back to the promised
[3:18:22] land,
[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; yes,
[3:18:24] &gt;&gt; there was a woman in Jericho.
[3:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:27] &gt;&gt; She was not part of the seed of Abraham.
[3:18:30] &gt;&gt; But father, she entering
[3:18:33] &gt;&gt; into the commonwealth of Israel when it
[3:18:36] was not her season.
[3:18:38] &gt;&gt; She was living into a different place
[3:18:41] where the place was condemned by the
[3:18:43] angel of the Lord
[3:18:45] &gt;&gt; for complete and total destruction. But
[3:18:48] a woman who knew how to seize the
[3:18:50] opportunity.
[3:18:52] &gt;&gt; When she saw the spies,
[3:18:54] &gt;&gt; when everybody else was looking and say,
[3:18:57] "Who are these people, she look at them
[3:19:00] as the only hope she can get out of
[3:19:02] Jericho."
[3:19:04] &gt;&gt; Father, she sees her opportunity and
[3:19:06] that opportunity save her and save her
[3:19:09] entire family. Father, these are the
[3:19:12] type of the women that you brought in
[3:19:15] &gt;&gt; from the Old Testament all the way to
[3:19:17] the New Testament. And you testify
[3:19:19] yourself that that type of faith is only
[3:19:22] found into the Gentiles. Lord, may you
[3:19:25] awaken us.
[3:19:27] &gt;&gt; May those that are procrastinating, may
[3:19:30] those that have been touched or affected
[3:19:33] by this spirit of laziness,
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; of being slagger,
[3:19:38] &gt;&gt; of now being diligent,
[3:19:40] &gt;&gt; Father, release them this morning.
[3:19:42] &gt;&gt; Free them completely.
[3:19:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[3:19:45] &gt;&gt; Father, may you wake them up, Lord.
[3:19:47] &gt;&gt; And may they wake up to the season
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; and seize the opportunity
[3:19:52] &gt;&gt; and come out, Lord. Father and be free,
[3:19:55] Lord. Father, we are committing this
[3:19:57] entire day unto their hand and the
[3:19:59] oncoming week unto their hand. May your
[3:20:01] blood continue to protect us. May you
[3:20:04] strengthen us, Lord. Father, we thank
[3:20:06] you for touching those that were sick.
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; For strengthening my body, Lord, for
[3:20:10] giving answer to those that need it,
[3:20:12] Lord. Father, be with us as we commit it
[3:20:15] all unto the hand in the name of Jesus
[3:20:18] Christ. Amen.
[3:20:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. We love you.
[3:20:25] [Applause]
[3:20:27] Hallelujah.
[3:20:30] Real quick, there will be no choir
[3:20:32] practice today.
[3:20:34] Let's worship a little bit.
