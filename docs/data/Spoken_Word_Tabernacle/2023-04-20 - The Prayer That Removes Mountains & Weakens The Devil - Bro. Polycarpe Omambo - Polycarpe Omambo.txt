we thank the Lord Jesus Christ who is the author of Life author of all things the one that gathers all together here in this place I would like to thank the pastor because without him I could not be standing here God richly bless you as you standing let's take our bubble Zechariah Chapter 4. [Music] Beginning by verse six Zechariah Chapter 4. are you there okay we read it in the name of Jesus Christ Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 6. Allah [Music] Eternal address then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto the rubber bell saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts aplani [Music] is [Music] Grass Grass who are the O great Mountain before the robber bill that shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the head son thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it let's pray Heavenly Father we are approaching your presence as we are thanking you for this moment and we would like for you to move us out of the way [Music] so that you can take this position here to speak to your children at this time because we need your father [Music] you the one that gave this word foreign be with us from the beginning to the end in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you might be seated blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to the Book of Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter one verse 3. CC God says this [Music] is a every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses foreign [Music] there shall not any men be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not felt thee nor forsake thee [Music] be strong and of good courage For unto these people shall that divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their father to give them one more scripture in the Book of James [Music] chapter 5 verse 13. the scripture says any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing psalm s [Music] is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord LaPierre la prier de la Foie Sovereign [Applause] and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven him may the Lord bless the uh the reading of his word I'm going to read something in the vision of Patmos page 48. my subject tonight is based on all the scripture we went through a I believe that the word my subject tonight is the prayer that removes mountain and weakens the devil okay amen the prayer that removes Mountains and weakens the devil amen amen he says this is the word that the lord gave unto the rubber bill is a prophetic I am standing here tonight as Zechariah speaking to you or speaking to the actual zero Babel amen amen it's not by your might nor by your power it is by my spirit safe the Lord of hosts it's not because of your veins it's not because of your beauty but all by the spirit of the Lord the fight that you have in your life you won't win it by your own strength but you will prevail by the spirit of the Lord that you will prevail and brother Branham says the angel that was speaking to Zechariah was saying this executive way you see significant in other words what you see here this is the meaning of it is meaning that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost so just know that you are that church there is nothing you can do on your own that's what Jesus says without me you can do nothing only by me you can do something amen so tonight God is telling me to tell you is telling me to speak to us brother or sister or a church tonight it's you my brother you my sister God is speaking to you that it's not by Almighty diploma it's not because of your degrees it's not because of your height that you can change your own situation that you can cut down the mountain and tonight God spoke where are we ready in the story of Sarah it's God speaking you o great Mountain what are you doing in front of the rubber band apply you will be cut down amen amen a mountain what is a mountainous it is an elevation it is an elevation of the grand to a certain altitude [Music] and finally you end up having a mountain well we just read here that make notice to the mountains just like you my brother and sister you cannot really tell where the mountain is God who saw the mountain what is a mountain the mountain I'm talking about tonight is the image of the devil in front of you when a mountain is in front of you I am inhibited or blocked to go to the other side I cannot see on the other side [Applause] you will be made a plan amen why because that situation is so great for you you might probably escalate the mountain and go over there if he was a little Hill in your life probably you would already get pregnant and then have a baby all this time because it's a small mother you can go conquerors but when he becomes Beyond you there is no way you can escape and then you begin to get afraid when you begin to get fear there is nothing you can do in your life anymore amen amen and then in the life of the people we have so many mountains that's a natural Jesus oh they are man-made or maybe somebody brought a mountain and put it in front of you or maybe somebody push a mountain in front of you and when a mountain appear in front of you and you block your vision to see on the other side you cannot move on to the other side the great Mountain that is standing in front of you maybe it's a sickness a cancer I don't know maybe it's a female trouble that you have been struck maybe you are struggling with your feet amen amen Allah and then this has been a source of suffering in your life but God is speaking to you tonight I have been blocking your life because if you looking at the mountain if it's a great height you are already afraid to escalate you are even afraid to face it maybe it's your school maybe it's your work not moving right it could be your mountain tonight that doesn't bring joy into your life amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm gonna talk a little bit more about the mountain we went in the Book of James 5 13. the Bible said if somebody is married let him sing song if somebody is afflicted let him call for The Elder of this church so they can pray for him amen amen why that prayer because prayer the prayer of the Justice are very effective prayer can change things no matter the situation you might be facing prayer changes it and you one day in the time of King Herod they were uh persecuting the church foreign and they already killed James amen amen since the people were pleased the king thought that he's going to move further so they arrested Peter I said at that point when they arrested Peter when they arrested James said first the church was still under distraction and they kill him because the church tonight is you the church was still under destruction [Music] but when they noticed that James was killed now it's the place now which the turn of Peter now the church rose up and then they went into prayer he is a fair and they begin to pray more you know the stories in the book of Acts chapter 12 verse 9 this time the church said not Peter here in the party rapper be the one died Peter will not go away and they continue in prayer their prayer oh Faith their prayer opened the doors they broke the feathers that was imprisonment the scripture said that his father broke down because of their prayers so prayer has a great powers and tonight as we came here we came here to pray amen amen foreign Susan said Mama Advent have 17 children she could be cooking food for the kids maybe taking care of their clothing maybe uh saw some tone cloths and take care of them but despite having 17 children this is what brother Branham says that this lady reserves was taking at least three hours they need to be in the presence of God to be in prayer [Music] and the prayer of this woman have changed things in your life at that time and from that woman came out two big men John was slayed John Wesley the messenger a great preacher came out of it why because of the prayer of the mother amen amen this to pray for his family to pray for her children amen amen and the god that is faithful remembered her and the Bible says that the one who doesn't take care of his family he's watched them in Memphis he's worse than a hidden amen amen that are standing in front of our families we must cut them down [Music] you see the mountain must become a plane if the mountain is bigger God must take care of it and tonight we are not going to just move the mountains because if you move to Montana maybe that same Mountain will trouble somebody else and be a problem or trouble to someone else can come back in your life again to trouble your life so tonight we just now gonna move but we will carry down [Applause] in every every doorman of your life [Applause] maybe it's a lack of job maybe it's a bad business or maybe your school is not going well simultaneous all those mountains we must cut them down tonight amen amen remember yeah God promised Joshua he said nobody will stand in front of you so there should be no mountain standing in your life we're not just gonna move them and where are we ready God spoke it is not because of your muscles not because of your degree not because of your beauty not because because the Lord my spirit say the Lord you can do it by my spirit and we also tonight it is not by our knowledge but by the name of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ that's where we're gonna fight tonight he didn't go in the name of his father because of the knowledge that he had he says I come to fight you in the name of the Lord and the lord gave him the victory yourself you cannot do it but if you connect God to your problem you will you will have success tonight those mountains should be cut down Belgrade they are aggressive God will give us Grace tonight we can cut them down amen amen in the message believe in God the second day in 1952 in February the 24th brother Branham says I said in paragraph 107 brother Branham says this is that is the reason the prayer of sick shall save the sick Perfection oh if you only knew that in your hand glory to God the greatest weapon by being Christian s the most powerful weapon the world have ever known prayer he even changes everything amen amen the prophet is shall change the mind of God he did do it after death was pronounced to a man a man prayed yeah and God told the prophet go back and tell him I heard him yes hold on I won't read it all it's about uh King Ezekiel at that time the man got sick send the prophet Isaiah O Brother to tell him that saved the Lord don't let the surgery give your order prepare your house prepare your family because you will die you shall not live anymore watch what the thing did is he never argue with the prophet is argue with the preacher he only heard what the man of God said and he looked at himself he said I won't waste my time talking to the preacher let me go straight to prayer and he turned his face toward the world and he begin to speak to God even if I'm sick even if I'm gonna die yesterday even if this morning even if I already made the wrong mistake remember Lord that one of these days I did the best to leave the message father remember that I believe this message I believe your words father I did good things too father remember my life remember that I did that and he never went to God to remove death is going to change the mind of God the same Prophet that gave him the message he has not left the palace yet God when God heard the prayer of his servant let brutally when he heard the Cry of Hezekiah the prayer the parent is a kiss the prayer and the words of the king God say I can't take this no more I say I go back go back and go tell them God tell the King again I'm gonna heal him and motherfucked for one moreover for the time he's gonna stay on this Earth again I'm gonna add 15 more years amen amen and because of him I wanna deliver his people I'm gonna deliver the entire nation you see the power of Prayer when you are praying you must not run out of the world there is a lot of things in the world there is a lot of promises in the world Heaven and Earth shall pass away the word of God will stand forever that word produce things that you see God spoke his word he said to the Earth if you read the scriptures but the word of God will remain forever the king who'd hold God on his own words because he took the word because God spoken when you shall speak to me amen amen I will come down and I will answer this let me read this and know that we gotta pray Esther on chapter four maybe chapter five one two three and seven two to three you can read the scripture if you go to the scripture it was not her season to get there you pray for me for three days and me myself I will be praying along with you for three days fasting and praying and I will go to the king if I had to die I'm gonna die but I will go when they pray and fasted went to the king foreign those that were looking to kill the Jews it was heaven we know but Esther got the power to change and to kill Nema and the enemies of her life prayer change those things he changed those things amen foreign [Applause] he was two children one was completely dead that every time he has a prayer meeting he landed yeah he first goes to prayer you'll be passionate and sometimes he will be fasting for three four days and that's what he spoke that there are certain Devils they are certain mountains that cannot be cut down except by prayer when brother Branham remember he prayed for the child that was completely destroyed completely destroyed by the accident came back to life everything any scratch and brother Branham is showing to us the power of prayer the power of prayer amen amen the actor says in the book of Acts 16 25 . you can read it's the story of Paul and Silas they were in prison you say Iraq they start the uh uh they perform a Miracles they cast The Devil because someone representing a magician and was uh making all kinds of Wonders [Music] when she saw Paul and Silas that these are the man of God they are talking about the salvation the devil that was in the woman the spirit that was in the woman say you know what he came and destroyed our business we won't be able to make money out of here so we must arrest him they put them in prison they put them to prison and they begin to pray they begin to sing they begin to praise the Lord just like tonight when you clapping hands when you are saying hallelujah when you say in glory to God will take care of the problems the hand that you clapping oh the shout that you're making yeah God will take care of the situation and he will take care of the Russians and God will make it happen in the camp of the enemy they will hear their Cry of War they will hear the Cry Of Terror the noise of a big army if you are sick let's get it when you clap in your hands and you are praising the Lord God will take care of the situation and you will receive your healing you will receive your healing no matter the situation the mountain that is in front of you we don't know maybe it's a certain hindrance or maybe something or maybe it's uh poverty oh you need some kind of documentation oh you need something but you can't reach it is who saw it if you can tell him tonight if you can see my obstacles the great Mountain that is blocking my family maybe to get married we are so and so we are unable to get married maybe we are married but we don't have children all those that are not married nobody shall stand in front of you so tonight you don't have to move the mountains but you have to cut them down no matter the mountains in every domain of your life that is giving you headache you must stand tonight to pray the Lord God is able God is able to cut down your mountains by the Holy Spirit amen okay glory to God so we're here for the prayer amen amen we're here for praying don't be ashamed do not look at your neighbor you have your own Mountain she was praying until the man of God could not figure it out he begin to look at her and say maybe she's drunk but he was because of the trouble of her heart she reached to that point bless you Hallelujah let us stand now thank you very much brother polycarp for the exhortation to build faith so we can move on to our Promised Land amen brother Caleb you give me signal when you cut the streaming Glory Glory Hallelujah yes thank you amen glory to God I'm gonna read a portion of the scripture and then we go to prayer amen I plan on reading John James chapter 5 verse 16. to verse 18 where the polycarb stop at 15. give me some volume my brother just a little bit to help my voice Hallelujah James thank you you heard it forget about who is beside you mind your own business to be plain mind your own business you got the trouble in your life take care of it amen Hallelujah amen James 5 verse 16. the Bible says confess your thoughts one to another and pray one for another amen that she may be healed the affection fervent prayer of a righteous man a valid match our righteousness God took care of it amen this is where I want you to get in verse 17. Elias or Elijah was a man subject to lack passions as we are brother Branham says that it means that Elijah has his up and down so tonight we're not calling Perfect People to pray if you were perfect you should not be even in this church you are here amen our Perfection is in Christ and the reason why I'm saying this because the scripture wants you to understand that the great Prophet Elijah that accomplished so many great things that could speak the word and Fire come down from heaven and burn the people that Prophet is not different than you that Prophet was not a perfect man the way you think that Prophet has his up and down in other words that Prophet made some mistake that Prophet could get up in the morning and get upset that Prophet could make a wrong judgment that Prophet was just like you but the problem is not to be to have the same passion like Elijah the problem is despite the state that you are in your Christian work you still can pray and God can still make things happen for you amen he said Elias was a man subject to like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that Iman not reign so his passion his weaknesses were not a hindrance for his prayer this is not in the blood of Jesus Christ this is under the blood of bulls and goat a man with weakness could pray with forgetting his weakness and looking at the sacrifice a man of the Old Testament and things happen we don't have a sacrifice to look in Israel we are looking at the Throne of God where the Corporal body of Jesus Christ is standing there the Bible says that Elias was a man of subject to lack passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that he might not Reign and he Reign not on the Earth by a space of three years and six months so he is the one that locked the heaven before Jesus gave that power to the church because Jesus say whatever you bound I will bind by Elijah already exists I mean exercise the power in the Old Testament amen Verse 18 and he Pray Again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit so the condition or the weather of Israel was under the hand of a man who could turn the water on the way they on or just turn them off not looking at his weaknesses but looking at the blood and the sacrifice of the Old Testament everybody okay so as we are approaching God tonight your weakness will trouble you when we start praying the first thing you will remember the bad thing that you have done amen so let's begin first to get those stuff out of our who are here in other words as they begin to play the music softly let's begin to repent I know before you come to church you repent everybody okay but there are many things that we have done that are not right amen we don't pray at home the way we are supposed to be praying we don't want that to be in your mind you don't want the devil to bring something in your mind that you don't pray now you're trying to pray now tonight to make things happen let's put everything under the blood so when you begin to pray because the scriptures say if your heart condemn you not amen so we don't want any condemnation amen so whatever can be a source of condemnation let's take it first let's put it under the blood if you don't come to service the way you're supposed to come if you don't listen to the message the way you're supposed to listen if you slack on your Bible reading if you slack on your prayer life if you slack on question and answer if you slack or you have a problem here and there let's take all those problems let's go down before the Lord let's put all those prayer under the blood if you make if you made a mistake that you still condemning yourself for years every time you look at your child you say all of this happen because of my mistake let's get that let's put that under the blood amen and tell God even those that I don't remember now everybody okay those that I don't remember now there could be certain things I have done or I have offended somebody and someone is offended against me that I don't know because David even say forgive me for presumpt your sin amen whatever you've done whatever intention that you have that was bad well that that feeling that you have that was bad let's take it let's put it under the blood let's approach him first that way Amen to make sure that you don't have anything to correct to hear remove it so that you can have faith to approach him play the music loud my brother pray on your own way you know what you did you know where you are the holy spirit will remind you what he wants you to remember now and whatever doesn't come to your mind put it under the blood say father if I offend you somewhere if I grief the Holy Spirit somehow and I do not remember what I have done father I ask you forgiveness may you cover me with your blood may you look at me under the blood May Lord father I approach you under the blood because without the shedding of the blood there is no Fellowship let's begin to pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father I'm a shepherd that you have placed
