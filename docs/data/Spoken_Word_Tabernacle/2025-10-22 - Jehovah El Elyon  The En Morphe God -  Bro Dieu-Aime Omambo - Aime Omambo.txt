TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Not a word of it fail. What a privilege. That that should have been to know that you were walking in the wilderness. And there after when he told him the message, they had to believe it first. But after he got him out of there, then God said, I proved to him and I am that pillar far that you met in the wilderness. So he said, gather them all together around the mountain. And he come down on top of Mount Si. And God begin to thunder out. And the people said, don't let God speak. Let Moses speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let God said, "I won't speak to him no more like this, but I'll raise him up a prophet that'll speak in my name." See, &gt;&gt; so we find out that that's what God's always done. Why couldn't they see that in the beginning? See all these things and then murmur against the message that was taking them to the promised land to start them out right and taking them to the promised land. But they still they had to murmur against it. Think how perfect how they could have walked every day walking with the Lord. What a life to live right in the wilderness at night time eat mana of the morning it fell over the night and you know what become so common to them till they said our soul loth this bread &gt;&gt; and that's the way it's been with us &gt;&gt; I just think of the little groups that we just in my own little ministry across the nation seeing not only healing and things that's always been healing God always had a healing uh outlet somewhere even he had angel on a pool once and he all kinds of things. The the bra serpent in the wilderness. They've always had symbols of healing. That isn't what I'm talking about. Healing is one thing attracts the attention of the people. Anybody will donate to a healing service. They'll they'll donate to a song festival. But when it comes to a poor lost soul, ain't got nothing to do with that. Now, isn't that about right? &gt;&gt; We got everything to a poor lost soul. Don't want nothing to do with that. They let him gul out into anything. Say, "Well, that's all right. He belongs to church that won't hurt anything. But now we find here coming to a close as quick as we can here. Think of how perfect it was. I look down to the the days that we have been here on this earth. Look what the Lord God has done. Started off in great signs and wonders and miracles which we all enjoyed and watch. Then come the message behind it. Watch what's taking place. Walking right not just by yourself. &gt;&gt; Man along with you. See a cluster of angels come from the heavens. shake the whole earth to stand there in the newspapers, write it up. &gt;&gt; Was predicted months and months before hands would take place. There he stood there and said, "The time is at hand. Return back. Open the seven seals of mysteries has been hid all through the reformations and things. Bring it out." Then comes preaching serpent seed and all these things like that. What does the clergy do instead of sin? Well, Luther said this or they just they'll never see it. See? But what a privilege it is for us &gt;&gt; who believe and walk in the presence of God every day. Stand there and see a whirlwind come out of the sky. It blow them out in half and you stand there where we was at. Cut the top of trees off and things like that. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Tell [Music] me.

[Applause] I I'm so excited. I don't even have words to explain this. Um that I abite my teeth when I sleep. And so this I was told this at the dentist. And this um Thank you, Lord. It it went on. I was told to get some guard to prevent that, but uh they were so uncomfortable. So, I couldn't wear them even though I had them. But as time went on, uh, when I would open my mouth wide, it would crack like I was pop, literally pop at the joints. So, the dentist told me that it was my what they call the TMJ, the the joint right here. And so, I I ignored it. Um but uh since the beginning of this year, it became so bad that I would hardly open my mouth wide. So going to the dentist was a real big chore and u sometimes I would I would have to position my head in a certain way because I couldn't open it really. Basically, it would lock at at times. But you know, it didn't bother me. I mean, I said, "Okay, it wasn't painful." So, I didn't really pay much attention to it. But as time went on, it started getting very painful and um sometimes it locks and I can't even brush in the morning. So, I was advised one of my colleagues say, "Why don't you try a chiropractor?" Of course, you know, you try. So, I went and they would do, you know, that machine, but nothing happened. So, it got worse um to a point where I couldn't chew like you know how you get up a stack of hamburgers I couldn't open my mouth to to get it uh to separate it. So, and then uh on Mon know on Friday, this last Friday, I was coming from work and I thought about my dental appointment on Monday, this past Monday. And then as I was driving, something just told me, "Open your mouth." And there I was. I opened my mouth wide. And I was, you know, &gt;&gt; and then I started shouting, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you." And then I opened again and opened again and opened again and um and as I kept on opening there was nothing and you know there was no sound there was no popping or anything. So I reached home and I told my husband I said guess what said what I open why and then he said no sound. So I've just I just want to thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We bless the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; for that wonderful testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe um this is a request um that the Lord will bring back all those stolen items which includes the Bible. Amen. And also once my whole household saved and also prayer for my son which is Randall. Amen. So we kind of um summarize what is being written here. Amen. And that we bring all these requests before the Lord tonight. Amen. Amen. So um brother Charles, if you don't mind, Amen. We're going to invite you. Amen. To thank the Lord for the life of brother Levi and brother Preston. Amen. And also I bring before the Lord the prayer request. Amen. for the salvation of this household and for this um son of our sisters. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, Lord God, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for an opportunity, Lord God, to gather here together, Lord Jesus.

Lord, and you taught us, heavenly Father, Lord, that when we start to move, Lord God, in your perfect will, Father, Lord, when, Lord, Lord, there's even a scripture in the Bible that says, Lord, why did the heathen rage, Lord, and imagine vain things, Lord? You said because of Christ and his anointed, Lord God. Father, when we start moving in the right direction, Lord God, climbing closer to you, Father. Lord, we know, Father, that the enemy will come in like a flood, Father. But you have given us the best weapon, Lord, and that is your word, Father.

We pray that you bless, Lord, the the our brothers and sisters, Lord, they had the birthdays, Lord God, continue, Lord Jesus Christ, the work that you're doing in their lives. Heavenly Father, you've given them another year, Lord God, to reflect on the things that you've done in their lives, Lord Jesus. And father, we pray Lord God for the uh the other requests Lord God.

They just want to get the word and the word will take care of everything. So, welcome to spoken word tabernacle to our convention tonight on a Wednesday. Everybody's clear with the instructions. &gt;&gt; Waiting on the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you need to fix, you fix it. &gt;&gt; If you need the Holy Ghost, get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you get the Holy Ghost, then you keep your eyes in Jesus Christ. But remember the instruction of Jeremiah. Not Jeremiah over there, but Jeremiah in the present time. &gt;&gt; Amen. We building houses, looking at the coming of the Lord. We getting married, looking at the coming of the Lord. We planting potato, looking at the coming of the Lord. Whatever you plan, looking at the coming of the Lord. The day he showed up, we drop everything and we go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't go to one end or the other. Brother Brandham say do not do that because that will get you so cultish and people will call you a cult because you don't you not normal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be normal. Leave normal. Christian not normal &gt;&gt; and Abraham was normal. &gt;&gt; Jacob was normal. &gt;&gt; Joseph was normal. If you still don't say amen. Jesus was normal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was normal. Brother Brandham say he didn't even speak a high Hebrew. &gt;&gt; He speak a common language until the common people heard him gladly. That's what the Bible say. He was a normal man. He even have a headache. &gt;&gt; Jesus was praying. &gt;&gt; Jesus was hungry. &gt;&gt; Jesus was tired sleeping on the boat. &gt;&gt; 100% God. &gt;&gt; And 100% man. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the inside, we are redeemed. This body still need to be brought under subjection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we go to heaven, we get a body change. Then you don't have to worry about anything anymore because over there you will see the devil and just laugh and keep moving around. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you will see him in the millennium for a thousand years and he won't do anything to you. No sickness, nothing. You just watch. You say, "My friend, stay here. watch me for one day for a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without you doing anything. So when we wake up in the morning, we sing I got a sword in my hand and the devil is ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep the balance in the middle of the road and move forward. And after I preach, I heard people that when we are getting uh when they were getting closer to 77, some stop. They say they won't go to school. Some stop. They say they will quit doing this, doing this. And 77 happened. And 77 passed. And then they say 2000 the computer will crash. &gt;&gt; And then 2000 pass. And then they say, well, what's happening now? It is 117 of Ephesis. He passed. &gt;&gt; Oh well, the American pope, he came. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I don't know what you're waiting for. California or something. Be ready. All right. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for California. Be ready. Let California find you ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not you waiting for California and say, "Okay, now California is done. Let's go seek for the Holy Ghost." No, no, no, no, no. Seek for the Holy Ghost right now. Because when you eating the lamb, you must eat the lamb with your shoes on, with your belt on. In other words, you ready whenever it's time to go, you drop that lamb or that lamb chop, whatever it is, drop it and you go back and you go straight to heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I apologize for the young man, but something came up really big that we we don't have any choice because it's an elder right at the corner here in South Carolina. The funeral of Sister Henderson is on Saturday at 100 p.m. That's when they put it. The viewing is on Friday. The funeral is on Saturday. This is not somebody far away. This is an elder rod here at the corner in couple hours only. So we apologize. I know you got your schedule. You are grown up. You young man. You also have your your plan and everything. We plan for this coming Saturday, but we apologize. We got to shift that quickly and try to insert it. The deacon are working quickly to see if the 8th of November will work. So we will allow some people to go there and support the family and show uh the support to brother Anderson because this is a big loss. It's a pastor's wife that have gone to be with the Lord. Amen. So we apologize. Just hold tight. We will try to squeeze you somewhere quickly and then we pick up. I don't know if the ETH will work. So respond quickly to the deacon so we know. Don't wait till you look. I mean sometime you send messages and people are going to answer after 4 days. Some are getting on WhatsApp. They're looking at something else but they don't check the and I know how to check stuff. I'm I'm a pastor in the present time. I'm not an old fashioned. I learned some some stuff. I can tell who's reading the message and who's not reading the message. So, but I can tell you were on WhatsApp. You read something else, but you didn't read the church message. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, make sure when you get to check your messages, check the church messages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I send a church message today. I put it on a on a musician chat. I put it on the whole church. I put it on on the young people. So, don't come and tell me you miss it because it's three platform. I made sure it's there. If you don't look at that, I will send you directly the message. I will deliver the message directly to you. And then if you see my message directly, just know it means you didn't read the message. So I don't want you to come with an excuse and say I was not aware because the police officer will give you a ticket. &gt;&gt; Not the police officer on the street. We got a police officer. We got a deacon right here who is a police officer. Amen. So don't get mad on the deacon when you didn't read the message. So read the message. Stay on top. Make sure everything is good. And let's honor the sanctuary of the Lord. Anything else outside in the sanctuary, whether you in the bathroom, it's still the sanctuary. It's the building of God. Whether you on the sound booth or wherever you are, even right here, whenever we open it, just know it is God. Whether there is no one here in this building, you are alone. Be careful what you're doing because God is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say in places like the churches angel stays right there. So get to get a blessing and not get there to get a whooping. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not preaching tonight. Brother JM is preaching tonight. So this month we got home folks back to back. Amen. So I told him to preach. Preach like home and preach with full of energy and we're going to pull on the gift of the Lord. Amen. Let's go. We firmly believe. Oh, leave him.

Thank you musicians and thank you the pastor for this privilege. Without taking any time, if we could go to the Lord in prayer. Lord, heavenly father, we come before you, Lord Jesus Christ, this evening, Lord God, to thank you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, Lord Jesus Christ, for protecting us in the highways and byways, for giving us the breath of life, and for bringing us here, Lord Jesus Christ, tonight to not hear from a man, but from to hear from you, Lord, heavenly father. May you use me Lord heavenly father. May you use me to fulfill your purpose lord Jesus Christ to recharge your people Lord God and to speak to your people Lord God. That's why Lord heavenly father we came here Lord God. Even I myself also Lord God came here to hear from you. Not from a man but to hear from you Lord God for the hour come Lord Jesus Christ for you to just have your liberty Lord God and bring your word forth Lord Jesus Christ and restore us Lord heavenly father. because it's by the preaching of the word that we're being restored. In Jesus Christ's name, I bend the remaining of the service unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could go to our scripture in Exodus chapter 3 If you dare, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Exodus chapter 3 verse 13 and 14. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers have sent me unto you, and they and they shall say to me, what is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am have sent me unto you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As you're standing, if we could also go to second Peter If you're there, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter one. The scripture reads this. But there was chapter one. Simon Peter verse one. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. Amen. through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption of corruption that is in the world through lust. May the Lord God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject tonight is Jehovah Elle, the immor. &gt;&gt; And I I wanted to talk about this because I remember I looked up the term Jehovah. Jehovah means I am. And in certain translations, uh it also means I am becoming. And I wanted to use both of those to speak on Jehovah I am which is present in Jehovah I am becoming. And the morphe speaks about a change but not a change of God actually changing because the law of God doesn't change and but it's a change of um masking. &gt;&gt; Amen. and Jehovah. The thing about being I am as you read in the scripture of second Peter, it says that according if you go to verse three, according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life. Whenever I read this scripture, there was something that always came to me because I remember one time I was watching a certain something and that scripture kept coming to me and I remember I went to the pastor and I get and I spoke to him about it that all things pertaining onto life and onto godliness. God has already pul in you. That mean everything that you need in life God has already placed it within you. If you remember even the uh Sunday that passed when when uh the word was coming forth it was talking when God told the Israelite that you should build houses but they were prisoners they had nothing. How can you build something that mean there was something inside of them? What they're building is coming from within. That's right. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; I also wanted if we could go to Matthew chapter 25, &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 25. If you're there, you can say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 25:31 for the scriptures. Sorry, it's like the page is stuck between two page. Verse 31. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all the nations, and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. See, we see that the kingdom was already prepared from the foundation of the world. That mean before you were born, it was already prepared. &gt;&gt; For I was for I was a hungered and ye gave me me. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. and I was a stranger and you took me in. Naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you vest and you visited me. I was in prison and you came unto me. &gt;&gt; Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a when saw we thee and hungered and fye, or thirsty, and give thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee? The king shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you. In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then shall he say also unto them on the left and on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed it into everlasting fire. Prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was a hungered and ye have gave gave me no meat. I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink. I was a stranger and ye took me not in. Naked and ye clothed me not. Sick in a prison and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee in hungered, or at thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not manif and did not minister unto thee. Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, and as much as ye did, it is as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we see here that God saying is saying that everything that you're doing to his beloved, his children, those that came from him, you're doing it unto him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And everything that you're not doing, everything that you're neglecting to do and you're also not doing it unto him. And brother Brandham speaks, if I could go directly to a prophet, he says, "God's first appearing to Moses in a burning bush veil before the people, God veiled again and vindicated Moses by the veil by veiling himself with the same fire, same pillar of fire came down from them. So they could only hear God's word." You get it? Just the word. They heard his voice. For Moses was to them the living word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Moses, see God had so proven that word by Moses. So Moses, God said, Moses, go down there. I will be with you. Not nothing going to stand before you. I am that I am. He's talking about the present stand that he is what he is. Everything that God because if you remember the title is Jehovah Elleon. Jehovah meaning I am and Elleon meaning the possessor of heaven and earth. That mean everything is already within him. Everything he already possesses and has control over. &gt;&gt; Because I am is a state of being. It's not really a place or anything but it's a state of being. And it speaks of something innate uh of a innate ability which is something that is within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues and says, I said, well, it's very easy if you just let your own thinking get away. And think the Bible terms of it. &gt;&gt; They are the selfsame being. God is a spirit. Jesus is the body that he was veiled in. See, like in in my home to my wife, I am her husband and I have a young daughter, Rebecca. I am her father and I have a grandson and his name is Paul. And I am his uh grandfather. I am I am a husband, father, grandfather. And my wife has no claim on me as a father or a grandfather. She has claim on me alone as husband. And my daughter has no claim on me as a husband or grandfather. She is my child. See, but yet all these three person is the same person. See that's God father, son and holy ghost is just the dispensation claim. God is is same the same God. &gt;&gt; And what I want to pull from this is the fact that God is the same and the prophet is saying that he is a father. He's a grandfather. He's a husband. He's a wife. I remember uh sometime when I kind I came up here and I was um ministering and sometime I would touch couple stuff and some people would get on me on that and they would ask me well you're saying this and this and you're not married and and the thing that I like to use as kind of like a rebuttal is Paul wasn't married you see and he preached on it but anyways here the prophet is talking about that he's a husband He's a father and all that etc. It's not really it's something that was already built within him. All it took was a certain situation for it to come out. It took a certain condition for it to just manifest itself. That mean &gt;&gt; me also as many other people here to be a father to be uh a parent or something. It's something that's already within you. It takes a certain condition for it to just come out. And in that state you will become a father. And you becoming a father is not you actually changing and becoming a father but it's just the father in you coming out. You see that's the difference. Just like uh the title say Jehovah elo and I said they immor God God changing a mask. It's not that God himself is actually changing. It's just that God is always for example Jehovah Gyra the provider. God being the healer. God is always a healer. But when he changes it's not that he's actually changing. For example, uh like I said, God is always a healer, but maybe he's not a healer for you yet, but he can become a healer for you, but that doesn't mean that he was never a healer to begin with. He was always a healer, but you were never put in a situation for him to become a healer for you individually. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where I want to uh draw my inspiration. That's exactly where I draw my inspiration from. &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues and he says, "God changed himself. change his form. &gt;&gt; If you notice here in Philippians, he said not thinking a robbery but took the form of men. &gt;&gt; Why? He told even told Moses himself. You'll be God and Aaron will be your prophet. See, so he come see he had to veil himself cuz God is always behind a veil. Oh my. Do you see it? God is hid from the public. God when he comes when God comes in when God comes with um treating with mankind he always comes behind skin he will come in to treat with you behind skin to talk to you he has to reveal himself that way so he can so you can comprehend him there's also um brother Brandon was talking about in a certain place where brother Brand was talking he said that the reason why God has to use men is is the only way we could understand it it's the only way we could understand it and I believe I the quote here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in the unveiling of God, paragraph 79, 1964. It says 1 Timothy 3:16, without controversy, great without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. for God. G O G O D Elohim capital G O D in the Bible refers it back anybody. It refers to in the original it said Elohim in the beginning Elohim. See and Elohim without controversy great is the mystery of him. &gt;&gt; Pardon? Great is the myster is the mystery of him. For Elohim was made flesh and we handled him. Elohim veil in human flesh. The great Jehovah that covered all space, time, and everywhere was made man. We handled him Elohim. In the beginning, Elohim and Elohim was made flesh, dwelling among us. What? This is his way, the parts of the drama. That's that's the way he's to act it out. &gt;&gt; His way of revealing himself to us as some different person. We are mort we are mortals and he knows that and we only understand as mortals. We only know as mortal. We only know as our senses will let us know. And the rest of it we have to believe by faith. We have to say there is a God whether we see him or not. We believe it anyhow. See whether there is or not. We still believe it because God says so. So God uses man because that's the only because we're immortals. We're mortals. So God uses man because that's the only way we could comprehend it. So he came down as as Jesus Christ the son he came down so he can bring us up because uh as brother Brandham gave an I believe um I believe he gave an analogy of uh chimpanzeee or so. He said, "For you to be able to give to tell them to build houses, you have to become a chimpenzee first and you have to teach them from them. You can't just be a human. You're talking to your chimp's trying to educate them to tell them you need to build houses and and tell them, oh, the houses are used for this, this and etc. You can't teach them salvation like that because it's almost as a level higher than them that they cannot comprehend. You have to lower yourself." That's why sometime when you're explaining to a child, you have to literally lower yourself. Sometime you have to talk to them eye to eyes for them to comprehend. That's why God did he came down as humans as mortals because we can only understand mortals. He came down as mortals to take us so he could bring us higher so he can lift us a little bit higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the other thing about Jehovah which is the I am because I am like I said it's a state of being. It's just something that's within that comes in. When God was creating heaven and earth, when God was creating the universe, he was just taking stuff from within, the spoken word which came from within and he was creating everything. That's why I love um the scripture of I believe it's Isaiah 45:7 where it speaks about I create darkness and I form light. And I really like that term I form because what helped me really understand it was how diamonds are formed because diamonds are not something that are technically created. They're just formed. There's and if use if you look up the um definition of the word form it's using something that already exist to make something new and diamonds are formed through pressure and heat and that's when a diamonds is created and the thing about that scripture why I love this because it says light is formed and if you remember who is light god is light that mean god formed light from within himself &gt;&gt; and everything that god is he poured on to the church. Meaning everything that God is is within us. That mean we should also have the same ability that he has. We should not be doubting in our everyday life. That's why even um if uh just give me a second here. If we could go to Luke, I believe chapter nine. If you're there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I love chapter 9 verse, let's start from verse. If we go verse 38, this was after Jesus healed a child. Jesus says, "And he said unto them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receive me, and whosoever shall receive me, receive him that sent me. For the for he that is least among you, all the same shall be great." And this is speaking about how God is uh revealing or hiding himself in flesh. That mean whatever you're doing to one another, you're doing it unto God. And if you continue say and John answered and said unto I mean and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followth not with us. And Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he have for he that is not against us is for us. And it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before his face. And they went and entered into a village, and entered into a village of Samaritans to make ready for him. And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. And when his disciples, James, John, saw this, they said, "Lord, without without that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elias did." But he turned and rebuked them, and said, "You know not what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to but to save them." And Wayne went and they went to another village. Now what I want you to pull from here is that the disciples James and John they already they had somewhat an understanding of what was already in them. They had the understanding that they had the power to bring down fire. They had the understanding they had the power to do stuff by Jesus Christ through Jesus Christ them. They already knew that the power was within them. &gt;&gt; And which is something that I also want you to know tonight that you also have the power within you. &gt;&gt; As long as you're connected with the Lord Jesus Christ, you also have that power within you to do whatsoever because because as the prophet says here, I go back. Now the Greek word there for the form I've been looking at all day yesterday trying to trying to think out what it was. I find come with this word of immor. It's spelled e n m o r p h e. Looking in the Greek to find out what was. I may pronounce that that wrong but but reason I spell it when if a tape is released the people will scholars will know what I mean by he when they immorate that means that he changed himself he come down now the Greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eyes can catch You see that's what is &gt;&gt; and God has many ways that he change it uh he changed his appearance to speak to men and in 19 um 64 the prophet says and Elijah was at do see the servant couldn't see all those angels around there and God just changed not brought not brought the angels down as we were uh during the question and answer we found out that heaven was already on earth. It's not that oh God had to bring heaven down. So all he had to do was just reveal it change the appearance of it. You see not brought the angels down but he changed the seeing of the servant and there was the mountain full of angels and fire and horses of fire and chariots of fire and all around his prophet. See they changed the seeing the thing is already there. And I pray that God may help us so we can change our way of seeing things and change the way we walk, change the way we believe, and to know that everything that we need of is already within us and is already around us. You see, and that God can change and become anything that you that you are in need of. I remember um prior when I since we're traveling through uh cart ship and everything in my notes when I was taking my own notes I had quoted how can God help people in a relationship and in that I quoted if you don't know how to cook God can become a chef and teach you how to cook if you don't know how to love God can teach you because God is a love God is love and the scripture says husband love your your wife as as Christ loved the church. That mean God knows how to love. If you're lacking in something, God is capable to help you in your relationship. And that's why I put in my note because God can become whatever you whatever you're in need of him of. Not be not becoming as in he wasn't already, but because he already was. But he could become what you're in need of in that time because he is a present God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says so that what I'm trying to say that God always was in here the only thing he done when he become man he changed his mask. See &gt;&gt; he this he changed himself to what he was to what he is or his mask and another and another act. You know sometime God could change himself to come help you through another brethren to another brother and so forth because there are many times where you're in need of something but you don't know how to ask. So you pray to God in private and that aid would come through another brother. That's right &gt;&gt; because I had situations like this when I needed something. I had the answer but I only needed I was missing one specific part and I prayed about it and God sent someone my way and he gave me the answer. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. everything that you're everything also um sorry if I seem to be a bit all over the place it's just the word itself it's so a lot that I can't try to stay in one place but the thing about the um Jehovah being the I am and you having everything that you need of within you I want to kind of give I guess is a testimony in a sense Because if you remember the prophet said that in this generation with all this invention and everything where we should be happy and everything but it seems to be like the most depressing age of all makes the great depression seem like child's play. But anyways what's it called with all this technology and everything there's a certain period if you're too invested in it and if you're too occupied in it will bring a certain type of depression. And I will say there was a point in my life where I was yes with all the technology and everything you would think it would help you at certain point. There was a point in my life where I was so depressed that I was praying to God to just take me away. And I remember because usually I go for a walk and I go for a walk to like free my mind and ponder upon the Lord. And as I was walking, I was walking and I was like, "Lord God, I'm just tired, you know, just take me." And this was like during high school or so. But anyways, I was like, "Lord God, just take me." And as I was saying that within my heart, I didn't even speak it out. As I was saying that within my heart, a car was passing by towards me. And I just felt my leg give out. I just felt my leg give out. And I was kind of like tilting towards that car. And in a split second some something else within me came up and he was like no and that I just felt extraordinary strength just came and pulled me the other way. That mean everything every situation that you're overcoming I mean every situation that you're going through you have the ability within you to overcome it. And all those even depression is just an illusion that the devil puts in your past to try to compress you and to hold you down. And it's something that the world has taught people through television through all things because television is actually television and social media etc. They're the thing you can use it to access heaven. You can also use it to access hell. And and it's a very it's a easy and fast ticket for you to access hell. And hell nowadays it's all over the world. Why? Because that's what's being promoted. That's literally what's being promoted to television. So you shouldn't be surprised when you see people coming up and you see something that isn't right. &gt;&gt; Now the point of that is everything that you need of is already within you. So Santa, me and some beloved Santa, we were talking with because the reason why I say this because I had many um I had a couple colleagues or so this year alone who attempted or at least thought of committing suicide and I spoke to them and I told them that it's not something that you should be doing. If you're going through something, just I told him to contact me once, but one, but two, if you're going through a trial, it doesn't matter what trial you are, God put you in that trial because he knows you can overcome it. He put you there because he cannot give you something that's greater than what you are. And as the scripture say, everything that you're in need of is already within you to overcome. It's already within you, placed in you for you to overcome. Even when Cainan, a seed of the devil, when God punished him and it seemed greater than what he could bear, he brought it back to God. So if there's a trial that you're going through and you think it's greater than you could bear, you can always go back to God. If the child of if the seed of the devil can do it, why can't you? &gt;&gt; Why can't you? What's stopping you from going to God and telling God, "I cannot do this." Or what's stopping you to go to God and say, "Lord God, because before the foundation of the world, God had created you. You are a part of God." That mean that's that's also another thing because whenever they ask you u let's say there was a bad situation they were that happened that they ask you would you have chosen that many people say well I would not have chosen that and all of that is true but that's only true because we're in flesh but if you go back up and yonder before the foundation of the world you were back with God and when God was creating these stars where God was creating all these things you were there cheering God on that mean you were agreeing with God placing you in that specific situ situation you were agreeing with God placing you in that specific time. Your theophony was agreeing with it and that mean it was already something that was within you. That mean it's that's why I don't like when people say, "Well, I wouldn't have chosen that." Yes, you would have because you already chose it. All God did was just press play and you're just acting it out. It's plain and simple. Just like a believer and a child of the devil, they already chose their faith. Their faith was already chosen and you're just walking into it now. And the only issue is we don't remember because we're under amnesia. And there's preaching on the word. What it's doing is it's removing that amnesia and it's reprogramming you. It's reprogramming you so you can be back to where you were from the beginning of the world. &gt;&gt; And I also want to type this to um like a coder when you're coding a script. When you code a script, the script has everything that you're in need of. You already put everything in it. All you do is just press execute. And when you press execute, it will do what everything is written in it to do. And us human, we're written epistols. God already wrote a script for each individual one of us in our life. All you have to do is just press execute. When you go through a trial, just press execute. The execute of the word. And the Lord God will just bring it out of you. And that they act accordingly based on the situation that you're going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to continue with the prophecy, it says veil in human flesh. Moses with the word speaking what was to be later put behind badger skin. So is Christ our Moses. Christ is our Moses. He was God veiled in human flesh. Veiled in humanity. In flesh. That's right. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He was veiled by badger skin. He was veiled and this time he was veiled in men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today and forever. Promise his word to this age. He is still Christ. The promised word to this age veiled in human flesh. The word is God. And we have the prophet which God used to veil himself in the prophet to bring his word for this age. &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues to says the anointing is a person. The word Christ means an anointed one. See the anointed one. Then Moses was Christ in the in his days. He was the anointed one. Jeremiah was Christ in his days with a portion of the word for that day just as brother Brandham is the one for this age. &gt;&gt; It says, "But when Jesus came, he came as the redeemer anointed one." And that was both Moses and all that was in Moses and all the word and all of the godhead bodily was in him. That's the reason the whole temple veil ramp and mercy said come in perfect view. He was the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice now the veil in human flesh. The promised word to this age must also be veiled. Notice sin loving church members and sinner cannot see it because of human &gt;&gt; that's it &gt;&gt; because of human veil &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; I also want to say well when a minister comes over here and is ministering that's also God veiling himself with flesh and bring you the word for that day in that in that time in that day like as we're going through the season and everything that's God bring you the the word of the season for your time and for your day because the prophet isn't here to tell you that directly But God sent a a a pastor in the church that will tell you to prepare for the season. He's there to prepare you for what is to come. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in question answer, so being a well-trained theo theologian had nothing to do with it. Being meek gentle had nothing to do with it. What made him different? He was the word made flesh, not the word for the day of Moses. Moses was that word that day that day word not the word for the days of Noah. Noah was the word for that day. &gt;&gt; Not the day not the word for the day of Elijah. Elijah was the word for that day. But he was the present tense word. And they were living in back then. Just as brother Brandon, he's the word for this day. Everything that he spoke is what we're supposed to be living by. That's right. and everything that he spoke and everything that your pastor speak as long as they're aligned with uh the prophet of the of the age, it's something that you're supposed to be living by. If your pastor um brings up the standard, you're supposed to also bring up the standard because it's something that's supposed to help you. And the thing is when he brings up the standard, it's not something that you're incapable of doing. It's something that's already within you. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is just remove doubt. If you remove doubt from within yourself, you're capable of doing all things. Because us being born in um in this world, it made us be um he put a bondage. He put us under bondage. He put restrictions on us. He put restrictions as we're growing up. We have restrictions in our mental aptitude. We have restrictions in the way we think, in the way we perceive everything, in the way we perceive reality. See, &gt;&gt; the way I see it, there's only one reality, and that's the way God see it. And that's reality. Every every other thing when people say, "Well, that's your reality." No, that's your perspective. That's your opinion. But that's not reality. The only true reality, there's one reality, and that's the reality of God. That is the word of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And um And the prophet of God said in 1950 believed thou this. I said Joseph was a man like you and I. &gt;&gt; See Joseph was a man like you and I. But God is Jehovah. The spirit of God. The spirit that brought over earth. And in 1950 who is God? He said who is God? The one that stood there and rolled stars off of his hands &gt;&gt; and rolled worlds out of his hands and made the things which do not appear. Deity &gt;&gt; and deity himself lives in man. &gt;&gt; The creator that made heaven and earth lives in man. See, God lives in you. That's what the scripture um in Psalm 82 says. Ye are gods and you are the children of the most high and everything that God is. If God lives in you, even if you remember 1% God is still God. If if he was 0.0000 1% God is still God nonetheless. That mean everything that God can do you can also do. That mean it's already within you. That's why if you look at Moses when he met God when he encountered God that encounter with God changed his walk changed the way he talked and changed everything that he did. And when he met him the second time again when if you remember the scripture his face was resonating he was shining. So why is it that whenever a believers come to church and they're meeting God as God is speaking to them, but they're gloomy and they're sad and they're not their face is not shining, they're not resonating. Is shouldn't the light that's within you? Shouldn't the light that's within you that was already there before the foundation of the world, shouldn't it be shining through you? Especially in this dark age because if you remember that laian age is the darkest age of all and it being the darkest age of all and you being born here you being the seed of God shouldn't you be the brightest light of all in this darkest age of all shouldn't you be manifesting that what Moses done is just the type of what we should be doing you see and brother Brennham says in at thy word may every person in here that's bound by sensebound existence only trusting on what they can see, hear, taste, feel, or smell. May they fall away from that tonight. Go up into the realms of the higher and may this church literally rock with the power of God. &gt;&gt; And he also says in the resurrection, God take us away from this sense bound existence. Carry us out there in those realms where all things are possible. Remember, because everything that you're in need of is already within you. So, the only thing that's blocking you is your carnal body. It's your body, is your flesh. If you could just come above the the the um senses, if you could come above the senses of the body and tap into that potential, that unlimited omnipotent potential that's within you and you can manifest anything that's that you're in dream of, anything that you desire. It could be anything in your life, anything, any um situation. It could be a car. It could be a It could be anything that you're in desire of. Because if you remember the prophet had told the Israelites that &gt;&gt; that built houses while they were prisoner where they had nothing but from within them there was already houses. They had the ability to build house. They had the ability to do all those things that it wasn't something that was out of reach. And in this age, if you're in need of something, if you see yourself that there's a strong desire in you to do something because remember the deep call is onto the deep. If there's a deep calling onto something, that mean there's a deep somewhere to respond. That mean there's already a desire in you. There's already an ability and there's already an ability within you to manifest your desire to manifest that pull that's within you. [Music] Now &gt;&gt; I want to read uh brother Brandham here real quick. In the mighty in 1948 at thy word Lord paragraph 22 brother Brand says this when he met Abraham sixth chapter of Genesis back there he met him in the name of Jehovah of God the Almighty. Now the word in Hebrew is from the word Elsh Shadai which means the breast the nourishing like the woman nourishing nourishes her baby. Abraham was 90 and 90 99 years old. No children. His wife Sarah was past 80. They had no children. But God told him, "I am El Shadai. I am I am the breast. The I am the breast. I'm the Almighty." In other words, no matter how weak you are, &gt;&gt; I can nourish you back to health again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's still almighty God. He's El Shadai tonight. You You say I'm old, brother Brennan. It's healing for me. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's whatsoever will let him come. You say I belong to Methodist. I can't. Excuse me. He say I belong to Methodist. Brother Brendom says I don't care. I don't care where you belong. Healing is for you. If you believe it, El Shadai the Almighty. Let down the net. Lord, you shall you say, "Well, I'm old. Well, I've had this infirmity, this female trouble. I've had this for years and years, and I've tried doctors and everything, but at thy word, Lord, I will let down the net." You see, &gt;&gt; the Lord God can become whatever you're in need of him in your life. And also as as uh another thing is yes the Lord God can become anything that you're in need of it as your life but you also have to be sensitive and very observant because sometime God can use another man God can use another person to come and aid you one way or the other just as he used Peter and just the shadows of the disciples will heal uh people that was God using men to save other people it's still Jehovah healing ing people is still Jehovah doing manifesting those acts. It's still Jesus in the scene but just hiding behind man becoming someone becoming flesh to help out one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other beautiful thing about not just becoming and because I'm switching between two um subject back and forth but the other beautiful thing about it is if you look at the story of Job throughout um when God called Satan to come to Job after that God was talking to Satan and he said he God putting restrictions he said you can touch everything you can take everything that he possesses but leave him alone. Why? Because everything to restore everything that he possesses was already within Job. You see, it was already within him. And God knew that if he could leave Job alone and just take everything else, God could restore it within Job &gt;&gt; because later on the double portion came because through obedience, God restored everything else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why God did not let Satan touch Job because everything is within Job. Everything is already in there. God himself, a piece of God is in there. So he cannot let the devil touch that. &gt;&gt; If the musician could come trying to close here in 1964, the mighty God unveiled before us paragraph 209. I'm telling you, when you break that traditional barrier that Jesus is way back and he isn't now, When you find he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, &gt;&gt; there's no limit to what God could do right here in this convention. Remember, Wednesday is a convention, right? Then there's nothing there's nothing God could do right here in this convention. &gt;&gt; And show his world, show this world what they need. Not a world's affair, but a world revival that will be fulfilled and baptized with the presence of the living God and immorate inve every every veil, every veil. Nothing could hide his presence. When people gets hungry in their heart, there's a veil ready to be broke. You can just depend on that. rent and revail by his great holy spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the thing about um the I am God being the I am and you also because you being the child of God everything that he is you also are. That mean you should also be the I am. You should also have God in you because God is in you. You should also be the I am. Why do I say this? Because brother Brennham when it came to creating squirrel that power came from within him and he created squirrel in what he needed and sometime like I said earlier sometime certain situation you may need something and God can become that answer for you but you don't know it's within you sometime you think how am I going to come out of this how am I going to come out of this but you always come out of it how am I going to respond to this how am I going to respond to this but the right answer usually always come like sister auntie right she didn't know what to say she didn't know how to say, but when the time came, something within her spoke within her. It's not something that because within herself, she didn't know what to pick, but something else within her knew what to say and spoke what needed to be said. &gt;&gt; So, the message I want you to take home for tonight is that God, the I am, he's the one that is becoming and not becoming because he wasn't, but becoming because you're in need of it now. So, he becomes that for you now because he's a present time God. And he's a god that's always there for you. And he can use either man or he can use the other ways to come and interact with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could all stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could b our heart and go to God in prayer. Lord heavenly father I come before you. Lord heavenly father. Thank you for this Wednesday service. Lord Jesus Christ that you call conviction. Thank you for this time Lord Jesus Christ that you took to come and speak to us Lord heavenly father. Lord God I pray Lord heavenly father what was preached Lord Jesus Christ may you reveal even more unto your children Lord heavenly father. For Lord God Lord God you're the God that's always there that's always present that's always helping us in every situation that we need. Even when it seems to be hopeless Lord God you're always there to help us Lord. Even when we seem Lord Jesus to seem to give up Lord Jesus. You say you will never leave us nor forsake us, Lord heavenly father. For Lord heavenly father, you have your angel encamped around us, Lord Jesus Christ. That's even to vindicate even the more Lord heavenly father. The scripture that says everything that we're in need of to live a godly life is already within us Lord Jesus Christ. Everything that we need of Lord heavenly father to live a godly life Lord God. You already gave it unto us Lord Jesus Christ. Even the protection Lord Jesus Christ. That's why you even have angels camp around us Lord Jesus Christ. Oh Lord God may you help us Lord Jesus Christ. just access Lord Jesus Christ to that ability that you put within us Lord Jesus Christ to p to that hardware Lord God that you place within us Lord Jesus Christ. Help us access it Lord heavenly father so we so we so we may become Lord God a blessing for other people so we may become Lord heavenly father so we may let you use us Lord Jesus Christ in ways that you desire Lord God. Lord heavenly father we pray that you may just wake us up. We pray that you may just wake the innate of us up, Lord heavenly father. Just like the little duckies that the prophet spoke about, Lord heavenly father, they didn't know how to swim, but yet they knew how to swim, Lord Jesus Christ. Rather, they never swam before, but when they went on water, they just knew how to swim. It was something that was already built inside them, Lord God. And I pray Lord heavenly father as we cross trials Lord Jesus Christ may we come to realization Lord God that every trials Lord heavenly father that we that comes across our path Lord God that we're already built to overcome it Lord Jesus Christ that that power to overcome those trials is already within us Lord God. If there's anyone among us Lord Jesus God that's in need of prayer that's in need of sickness Lord Jesus Christ that's that's in need of healing for our sickness Lord God may become the healer for her Lord God. If there's anyone Lord Jesus Christ longing for something Lord Jesus Christ may you become that something Lord Jesus Christ may you provide it to them Lord our heavenly father one way or the other Lord heavenly father Lord God we come to you Lord Jesus Christ abandoned service unto you abandoned life Lord Jesus Christ of our dear brothers and sisters Lord Jesus Christ both visible and invisible Lord God I just simply abandon everything onto you Lord Jesus Christ lead us in the highways and by and byways Lord Jesus Christ I pray Lord heavenly father that you just continue to unfold Hold yourself unto us and continue to help us reflect you Lord heavenly father as a diamond reflects Lord Jesus Christ every light Lord Jesus Christ. It reflects it Lord Jesus Christ even the white light and every color Lord heavenly father. We wish to reflect you for you are light Lord Jesus Christ. Help us be like diamonds Lord Jesus Christ to reflect you Lord God. I pray that you may help us Lord Jesus Christ. Be a blessing to everyone around us Lord Jesus Christ. You spoke about how Lord Jesus Christ our enemies can become a blessing to us Lord Jesus Christ. But how about us becoming a blessing to each other Lord heavenly father. I pray that you may help us be a blessing to one another to help each other go up Lord Jesus Christ to bring each other higher Lord Jesus Christ. Bring each other higher by your word Lord heavenly father. For Lord heavenly father you knew us before the foundation of the earth Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord heavenly father before the foundation of earth you chose to place us here Lord God because you knew what was in us Lord Jesus Christ. You knew what you placed in us Lord heavenly father. And but yet Lord heavenly father we find ourel in a state where we do not know Lord Jesus Christ or rather we do not remember what is in us Lord Jesus Christ and we seem to have this deluded imagination that we cannot access it Lord Jesus Christ that we cannot access you Lord Jesus Christ that you're far away but Lord God you just came for telling us that you that you're the I am you're present you're in our midst you're within us Lord Jesus Christ and you're the one that's helping us move forward Lord God wherever we stop that's where you begin Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that you may help us, Lord Jesus Christ, that you may give us energy, that you may replenish us in all ways, Lord Jesus Christ. Just help us, Lord Jesus Christ. I thank you in Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. If the pastor could come up, [Music] Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a big clap offering. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Everything you have need of his where? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; In you. God is lleon, but he's also I am. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Why is he I am when he's lleon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you get that really well? Amen. And lleon. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay away from ministering because you already get it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. This is Elle Leon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is here. &gt;&gt; Because this one is a possessor of heaven &gt;&gt; and earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Elle Leon need to be I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Note everything that is in God, you need it &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; You cannot access pregnancy here if you a man. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. You can ask God a child. Amen. But to bury a pregnancy only a sister can go right here &gt;&gt; and draw that from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for to you he can become a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for your wife he can become a mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's the big source of everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he need to become what you're looking for. He need to become your life &gt;&gt; and your life is different than somebody else life. &gt;&gt; In other words, for you it's a healing &gt;&gt; but for somebody it's not a healing &gt;&gt; because they are in good health. He need to be I am for that person but to be I am in providing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But for you it's I am in a healing. &gt;&gt; For you it's I am in a deliverance. But the same I am is &gt;&gt; Elle Leon. &gt;&gt; He possess everything. &gt;&gt; But he need to become what you want him to become. &gt;&gt; He can be your wisdom. &gt;&gt; He can be your sanctification. He can be your Holy Ghost. He can be your strength. He can be your wealth. &gt;&gt; He can become your husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. He need to become the I am &gt;&gt; the God of the present time, &gt;&gt; the God of the present moment, &gt;&gt; the God of the present situation you are going through right now. &gt;&gt; He can become that God. But he always been that God, &gt;&gt; but he just need to be manifested again. And it takes certain circumstances in your life to bring that specific desire that you're looking for at that specific time in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's lleon his I am. He's just immorphing. He's just manifesting, bringing to pass what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to break away from our traditional bears. &gt;&gt; Especially if you want to follow this message. If you want to follow this message and you rigid in your old ways, you're going to have big trouble because God is pushing people toward the third pool. &gt;&gt; And the third pool will make us think the impossible and believe the impossible. &gt;&gt; So if you already have God in the box of religion, you will suffer, especially in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in this church, we keep pushing. In other word, as long as you're still living in this earth, you got something to do. &gt;&gt; If your mission is finished, God will take you home. &gt;&gt; If you're still here, it means you still need God. &gt;&gt; There are still things that you have not finished yet. &gt;&gt; Even if you quit your job, you still have something to do. &gt;&gt; Even if you retired, you still have something to do. &gt;&gt; If you say you're too old, God used Moses in which age? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say God can prepare you and to use you on you for a short period of time. Do you know how long John the Baptist preached in six months and his ministry was finished? &gt;&gt; So God put him to the bush to the forest to use him six month and that was it. And the Lord Jesus Christ himself preached how long? &gt;&gt; Three and a half years. Look at how long our pastors stay preaching. Are we together? From years and years and years. When the creator of heaven himself just preached three and a half year and he say it is finished. &gt;&gt; So God built that whole masterpiece &gt;&gt; for three years and a half that say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Break your traditional way of thinking. &gt;&gt; We cannot believe a God of impossible while we behaving like God is not the God of impossible. The way we behaving prove that we don't believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we bring you something that is beyond your your your understanding, you begin to reason it out. You begin to fight back. No, no, no, no. I don't think this is it. No, it's God pushing you off the limit. Brother Brandham say our extremities are God opportunities. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham say if you don't have a faith for your healing, &gt;&gt; how are you going to have faith for the translation of the Bible? I don't know if we realize what we doing in this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. We talking about one day being changed and crossing the wall. Do you think it's a game &gt;&gt; and then you can't believe for a headache? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God have to train you little by little one thing after the other and he begin to increase your faith when you have a testimony next testimony next testimony next testimony before you know it when they say believe on the body change it won't be any problem because you already have experienced God all day long. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's lleon. He's also the I am. Whatever you have need of is right in you. All it takes is a certain circumstances to bring what you're looking for out. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, thanking you again for your grace, for your love, your mercy, for speaking to our soul tonight and insisting in the I am Lord. Lord, sometime we get frustrated, we get discouraged, we get upset, we are tired, we feel like we don't want to push out because Lord Father, we realize that we stuck somewhere and our mind, our reasoning have reached its own limit, Lord. But Lord, Father, you are always that present help in the time of trouble. You are always the I the amen. Whenever we going through a certain situation, note that you have become. You always been there, Lord. You always been the possessor, the mighty conqueror, the God who created heaven and earth, the God who our sanctification, our healing, the lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world. You are everything that we have need of. And you have been that before the foundation of the world. You're just bringing us Lord, Father, back to this awareness, Lord, that you can become whatever we need you for the present time, Lord. And Lord, we need you more than ever in this hour that we going on. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you gave us the promise that you will not leave us nor forsake us, but you will be with us all the way to the end. Lord, may you help each one of us to drop and to break through that traditional barriers, Lord, so that no matter the situation like our brother was singing, it takes the mountain sometime to see you, Lord. Sometime it takes the wilderness, sometime it takes those difficult situation to bring us to the level that we can believe the impossible. Father we testify of an impossible that you have done just lord father for the approval from the county according to some people it takes three months we were told two weeks but by your grace it didn't even take a week by the power of prayer lord you open up the way and you gave us the approval lord if you can do it for a building you can also do it for a body lord you can do it for whatever we have need of in this world lord father and granted unto us that's Why we pray Lord Jesus Christ that you bring us to that existence to bring us to that level of faith Lord where this sense bound existence Lord tradition and what we have been instructed since our childhood can now break out Lord Father and we can be free to sow like an eagle into Lord the unlimited as your prophet already mentioned. Father, may you give us trouble of mercy and keep us all the way throughout the week. And if you dare to come, Lord, may you consecrate us again and help us to meet again back in the power of resurrection to hear from thee and to enjoy the things of heaven. We thank you. May you touch your man's servant and strengthen him, Lord, and lead us and guide us all in Jesus precious name. Amen. Go ahead. [Music] Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [Music] My rest is complete.
