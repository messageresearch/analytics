Chris went he's got a four-wheeler and he there's a place nearby that he can go and ride on his way home you know he had everything strapped in the back of his truck you know couldn't tight and uh as he was pulling away from an intersection in Shelby this the strap snapped and the four-wheeler popped out of the back of the truck it landed on its wheels and everything and but the man that helped him somebody stopped by and the man kept going God's got this God's got this and that just made such an impression on on Chris there and God's got he kept saying God's got this this is not a problem so we want to give glory to God that it didn't fall on somebody's car and have other problems amen amen and also last night as we were you know winding up and shutting things down we've been we've been doing a little bit of trash burning on the on the property with things that we don't need and uh and we my wife was down we have a garden that we tend to neglect just weeds you know the grass growing back in so she was down there and she said well let me go check on this fire one more time she's in her it's like some flip-flops normally she's got these little boots she wears around around the place but she's walking in front of the house and at the very last second noticed a snake was was under her and she jumped she hollered Rebecca ran out and then I ran out it was a copperhead yeah he was only about this big but they're deadly at that age that's right that's right so she she just was talking this morning on the way how she was sitting out by that fire thanking God you know about his friendship that he never leaves her and he's always there for and if if she can't depend on anybody else she can depend on him you know and here in his goodness he kept that snake from taking her

our scripture Glory Glory [Applause] amen amen amen amen if you talk to her she's talking like somebody who was not even in surgery she's laughing she's talking she's you will wonder if she really got a surgery or not Oh Glory to God amen glory to God amen amen let's go back to Joshua chapter one it's hard for me to get away from this chapter I'm trying to push I can't I'm stuck in the Hebrew one amen Hebrew 11. Joshua chapter 1. we try to hold to this testimony we can it's too hot you tried to block it Joshua chapter 1 verse one if you dare you can say Amen amen amen glory to God I thought somebody that looked but she corrected me last time she said no she's the younger one she'd look like me not me looking like her she looks like sister yoga but look like her welcome to spoken word Tabernacle good to see you amen Joshua chapter 1 verse 1. you ready my friend the Bible says now there is an echo after the death of Moses which to me after the death of William Marion Branham if you have a problem with that you change channels amen the servant of the Lord is that a problem Are you ashamed [Applause] the state the United States was not ashamed of brother brother they kept that picture on the Hall of him [Applause] oh let's remove that picture it's idolatry foolishness if somebody uh bow down before the the Brazen serpent that means Moses is wrong let me let me stay on my channel now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of none Moses minister saying brother Branham say Joshua was a prophet you need coach you see me I'll give you a perfusion of it verse two Moses my servant is dead now therefore IRAs go over this Jordan you and all these people to the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel you might be seated this land they were not there yet amen Israel was not in the promised land yet but God already gave it to them everybody okay and the way we usually look at these things if the Lord already gave it to you you just go ahead and pick it up that was not the case God gave them a land that was already infested by the enemy so when you see an enemy it's not really an enemy the enemy is a sandpost to your blessing come on everybody okay everybody okay if you get into the promised land and you see the enemy it is scarecrow that's right in other words he's holding something that belonged to you and as long as he's there you won't get access to what belongs to you you gotta drive him out and God said that land he already gave it to the children of Israel so to begin with the Promised Land amen the promised land already have an honor amen let me put plural amen it belongs to somebody now my question when you get to the promised land and the Philistine asked you give us the paperwork that shows that this is your land give us the deed what is your deed what is the deed what is the deed show me the pepper okay you say this belong to you to your father Abraham and Ben whatever give me the deed what is the deed God say so amen come on that's an abstract cuddly God say so you the one that slow me we're not trying to move Jesus one day told the disciple that I need a vehicle and Jesus looked in the word to verify which kind of vehicle he need to use and the word gave him the mark of the vehicle in that time he was calling us in our town maybe it's a Nissan yeah am I saying something different [Applause] is he complicated so when Jesus looked into the word he say oh what is the mark of the vehicle the word give him the mark of the vehicle they say it is in us the Ludo of a cult Jesus look he said fun he called to disciple he said you go back there when you pass save this phone you will see a dealership and in am I reading a different Bible when you see the dealership you will find the car that is brand new [Applause] do you read your Bible do you read your baba the Bible say no one have sat on that ass yet it was a brand new one he said I just told you about the thought of me right amen Jesus never gave them the key Jesus didn't bring the pepper and say I'm gonna give you the pepper I already paid for that you take this paper and you go show to the dealer Jesus said when you get to the earnest section right there between 74 and you hope everybody okay you will see a car there that is parked it's a brand new car you go ahead and just get the car if the dealer asks you who gave you the permission to pick up this car tell him what tell him what the Lord the Lord has water so he takes faith for you to move on like that because your brain will tell you they can call the police on you maybe you say wait a minute that doesn't belong to him they will say that we're stealing amen Jesus what do you think if people look at us like now he's uh their Master is uh training the disciple to start stealing people's vehicle amen they went they found everything the way it is when they wanted to get the dealer came up and say what are you doing you don't explain your thought repeat [Applause] what they told you to repeat and the Bible said when they repeat they dealer turn around and just continue what was in that word that convinced the dealer to give they ask for free yes sir amen to begin with how did he know there is a nurse a car over there that ass was predestinated [Music] ah the promised land have honors who gave it to you God where are the paperwork go ask John and Peter where are the paperwork to get the ass I will push you until you swallow it every do you have any uh any exemption there is there a territory you should not take no sir the Bible says where every place as long as it is in the Promised Land there is no restriction that's why brother Branham say I will never step and block somebody who want to take God at his word [Music] so if you want to cut small that's your problem so don't call me that I'm eating too much if you have a small tummy take according to your tummy [Applause] have you seen you talking about it spending in somebody's nervous it is too much my brother what you have is already too much what is the problem with you fine every place that the soul of your water shall water tread upon that have I done what given unto you as I said to who Moses so when Israel walked they don't work just like that when they're putting a footsteps brother Branham say in other words when your foot put a print on the ground that's it if they ask you you say don't you see that foot does he match you okay do you know the angel of the Lord put a print one day and they brought the hand of brother brother [Music] jump to verse uh forward from the wilderness they're giving you your boundaries to this Lebanon even to the Great River the river Euphrates or the land of the water inside so it's already habitated inhabited amen all the land of the heated and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast jump to verse 7. Hallelujah amen no let's go to verse five let me lock this in so we'll be okay you there shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life as I was with hope Moses so the ministry of Moses never stopped he continued with Joshua so Joshua was a continuation of Moses amen [Music] everybody okay Moses the man is dead but his ministry continued in other words his ministry in more faith from Moses into Joshua so Joshua is a continuation of Moses Ministry amen amen and we know Moses Ministry was not Moses he was God okay no problem job to first uh seven only be you strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you turn not from it to the right hand we went through this or to the left that you may have Prosper wherever you go is so the law of Moses is connected to Prosperity amen [Music] we already dealt with this prosperity and money issue when they say here they didn't say you prosper in money they say prosper money including we already dealt with this so the law of Moses connected with prosperity refused good verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth but you shall meditate there in one day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written well therein for them you shall make your way how prosperous and then you shall have water good success so it's Kappa with prosperity and good success amen and I just told you Moses was a prophet and Joshua also was a prophet so a prophetic Ministry prophetic Ministry is a prosperous Ministry amen you can refuse it now I'm coming down when I'm gonna come down you're gonna swallow it amen everybody okay job two verse 9 have not have not I commanded you be strong and good courage Be not Afraid neither be you dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you goest we clear on that one amen we okay let's go to mark 11. if you want to be prosperous in your ways if you want to have good success you need to do what the prophet says and don't play with the message of the prophet don't deviate from the left or the right stay with the message that's why I always keep you in the Bible and in the message so that you can prosper if I take you off I'm cutting off your Prosperity any preacher that is removing William Marion Branham [Applause] any preacher that is blocking brother any preacher that is hiding brother any preacher that is complex to read brother Branham you need to run away amen amen [Applause] I'm independent you need to leave that church amen amen because it's a church that is brought in your Prosperity amen [Applause] you're reading too much Court you need more coats to know what God wants you to do amen how are you gonna know the will of God if I don't put it here how will you know what belongs to you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we're reading one court and we tell stories about everything else we don't need amen we need the word of the prophet [Applause] God who in Central Time spoke to Our Father by the water in this last day spoke to us by his son Jesus was a prophet amen [Applause] [Music] he's reading too much code no wonder your church are called all right um when they built the Tabernacle they put everything in it God never came God was waiting hey look he said that one he was waiting when they took the ark and they put the Earth God woke up amen and enter into the Tabernacle so if I want God in your life I must put the Ark in you [Applause] because the spirit followed the ark amen he followed the word amen [Applause] let's go to mark 11. hurry to God Mark 11. if you dare you can say Amen verse 12 the Bible says and on the morrow when they will come from Bethany thank you brother David he was hungry the one who was hungry was the man Jesus everybody okay everybody good okay and seeing a fig tree a fire off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything water so what was Jesus looking on the tree he was looking for fruit right why didn't he speaks fruit to existence he was looking for fruit instead of cursing the tree why he didn't spoke the fruit and get it because he cursed the tree and he went hungry everybody okay when he cursed the tree did he get the food so he continued to be hungry what is going on amen when the man the human man is Desiring something and when he's limit or block to access what he desired it is an opportunity for the inner men [Applause] to enter into into action in other words when you stuck it is just the beginning [Applause] when you feel like you're stuck in life just know it's just a beginning [Music] when Israel was stuck at the Red Sea he was just a road rather that road won't open if you not stuck you have to get stuck first to read God's way how many times have you been stuck into a situation then a solution happened what was God teaching you you stuck in a solution you stuck in a solution you need to learn so the next time you get stuck you say no problem that's his son [Applause] amen and he found thereon when he came to it he found nothing but water leave for the time of the Fig was not yet it looks like God made a mistake looks like he did it purposely amen and Jesus answered and said to it no man eat fruit of you Hereafter forever and his disciple heard it drop to verse 19 amen and when the evening was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the root so somehow he got food in a different way the first time he was hungry he was the devil that tempted him right and Angel brought him food it's written on your Bible Angel gave a larger food in the Old Testament where did they cook that's not my problem amen and Peter calling to remember and say to him master behold the Fig Tree which you curse is withered away and Jesus answering say to them have faith in God for verily I say to you that whatsoever shall say to the whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou remove and be you cast into the sea and shall not doubt in the heart remember where you need to have faith but shall believe that those things which he shall say which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says so your faith must come from the heart the faith that moved the mountain comes from within because your faith can come from two places we already established the difference between Hope and Faith amen hope is intellectual faith we already show you that but there is a faith that is coming from the heart that's the one that moved stuff job 2 verse 24 therefore I say to you what things offer or server you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them everybody okay Lord help me to get to that let's go to Hebrew 11. if I can by God's grace if you dare you can say Amen now Faith is what of things hopeful and the evidence of things Nazi so in other words again faith is the bridge between the imagination and the reality amen [Applause] [Music] damn it we have three welders everybody okay this is the imagination amen this is the reality all the material amen amen amen over here that's the domain of Hope amen over here hope here is the invisible amen you don't see it but you see it with different eyes here when I say brother able you see him right yeah do you see him with you guys but you know who I'm talking about you know how he look like you can see brother right but you don't see him but you see Brad Abel everybody okay amen but everybody was just an example my friend you see brother you know who I'm talking about everybody okay so there is a brother able here and there is a brother able here is everybody good this is the realm of the visible if you see how many times brother Brown and preach about faith you will understand why people don't have faith amen so this area here is your faith everybody okay so faith is the step everybody okay between the invisible and the visible everybody okay amen so when you have faith it means something that was already here is in the process to become visible amen everybody okay Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things water so Faith already got it amen in other words if you have something right here everybody okay when faith gets it you won't find it here anymore thank you everybody okay in here it's empty it's here it's empty it is already here now Faith knows how to take it from here over there amen the problem is what we call Faith is usually this all our problems stuck here all your desires are stuck here that's why you don't go nowhere and when as long as your desire is here if you speak the word it won't happen [Applause] everybody okay if you can move your desire from here to here that's it we okay verse for buy it the Elder obtain a good report true faith we understand that the world's plural were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen visible were not made of things which do what appear in other words what happened here is only something that was from here amen amen everybody okay what was here is what becomes here so when you see it here it was actually there the one who moved it from here to here the one that is taking things from here to here is Faith amen job to verse uh five Faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation you can't go without faith he had this testimony that he did water please God so before you go to the Rapture your level of Faith need to be somewhere amen if you don't have a faithful toothache forget about the rapture I have a quote that's why I'm training you on faith once you are used to Faith it is very easy to come out of this world because you already living in a supernatural world Amen in other words your battery is no longer zero your battery already charged amen you just need a little bit of charging to make it a hundred amen amen okay you heard him from there glory to God verse six thank you but with that faith it is how impossible to do water please God for he that cometh to God must believe that water he is and that he is a water rewarder roof rewarded of them that will do whatever diligently seek him amen another word in a blunt way if you don't have faith don't even go to the prayer line amen in blood way if you don't have faith don't waste your time in praying you don't get me the prayer of the righteous the prayer of what they you pray after you have faith amen [Applause] because what you're doing is a formality that's why we get the Lord Jesus Christ nothing happened it doesn't even cross here because you don't have faith you don't even believe but when you have faith your prayer is different amen because before you approach him you must first believe that he is the reward in other words when I'm going to him I'm not gonna come out without receiving what I'm asking amen in other words when I say Amen it means I already got whatever amen so don't say Amen when you don't have it [Applause] oh Jesus okay you will catch me later let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto that hand and thank you again from the bottom

if the Lord Terry amen if he would like Ruth is sitting on the holiest she's preparing for the going but we're talking about what is happening what should happen to roof before the Rapture which state should be Roofing under what kind of expectation should we in before the rapture the Rapture won't take you you just ignorant or sleeping that's why the Rapture will never catch the bread anyway

okay everybody good so when you get to the other end the Holy Ghost enter and say go ahead and take over let me see if I can skip listen to brother Branham he says what are you doing what do you do in Canon they were possessing the water right Glory they were possessing the water right and they could not possess the right until they get into it okay they didn't own nothing in the water okay watch out the wickedness doesn't belong to you it is just a passing by Amen brother brought them say when they come into Canaan then they had water right we got water right when you receive the Holy Ghost you are what in Canaan you have to fight for it every inch of the ground you have to do what right for it yes sir that is the reason the people say brother Branham you pray for me today all right we shall see go over in Canaan once brother and you realize where you are belong what turned around yes sir you say look here certain this is man I am possessor of this God said so do what move out move off my water ground your water Brown Satan say I have the water abstract thee do it move out you don't I Shall Serve notice on You by the water Holy Spirit he moves that sure he has to man Follow Me Now let me see if I can land somewhere when you enter Cannon brother Branham said the Holy Ghost gets you and enter in the promised land that promised land has people amen that are standing there sitting on your property everybody okay brother brother I'm saying when you enter the Holy Ghost put you in fight everybody okay amen now to fight you cannot fight yourself like that no sir you need something that will motivate you to push forward that's right are we okay are we okay what do you need to fight William Marion Branham faith is the water a conqueror we okay now foreign land you need faith the Holy Ghost when he comes into your life he also bring you first amen because without faithful there is no way you can benefit what God gave you that's right open Hebrew 4. if I can skip this quickly my God Lord help me let's go to Hebrew chapter 4. and I'm gonna land somewhere Faith the success you there let's go to Hebrew 4 verse one if you there you can say Amen let us do what feel lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short off with verse 2 for to us was the Gospel what preach as well as to who Damn but the word Preachers did not water Prophet them not being mixed with water faith in them that do water heard it so when the word of God is not fun that's a fun faith he won't do you no good [Music] when God said his word there must be a face to receive it then Faith take the word and make it a benefit for you and the one who bring the faith is the Holy Ghost amen so when the Holy Ghost come in your life everybody okay he puts you on ground zero and opened the faith of God and begin to show you what you need to conquer everybody okay everybody good you want to land for the airport brother Branham says this we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no mean was these five senses given to you to do what guys you they were given to you for Earthly contact but they was giving you the water Sixth Sense and that sixth sense it belongs only to who the Christians the six says one belong to you except if you are a Christian in other words when the Holy Ghost come you have automatic Faith Lord in you because there are things that God speak that your brain cannot capture they are things that God will say when you look at it humanly speaking you struggle to believe it you are saying yes but something in you is like huh I don't know how it's going to happen so the Holy Spirit say move out you don't have to believe it may I believe it for you amen [Applause] cannot continue amen I want to learn somewhere he says and you cannot have the Sixth Sense until you become a water a Christian first the kingdom of God is the only way you can ever have any more than five natural senses for the natural person but the success is better known to the Christian as what they are we okay now it is the one that govern and guide you and it's Superior to all other senses it is superior to all the senses the other five senses in other words when faith react in your life it will be something different than what you think Faith doesn't brag [Music] [Applause] usually the people who brag don't even have it foreign to take off everybody okay first don't have time to talk too much amen [Applause] Faith react let me explain it to you this is a bottle follow me carefully this is a bottle amen I close my eyes do I see the bottle when I open my eyes did you see my eyes telling me I can see this bottle did you hear my eyes telling me you know that I can tell you what color that is it well have you heard my eyes saying do you know I can tell you what color your your puddle is I can even tell you the name the eyes doesn't have that the eyes only react according to the way he was created he only declared that this is a bottle and if I'm thirsty all I have to do is acknowledge what the I say do you follow me and take the water and drink if I refuse what they I say you can die of thirsty everybody okay so when you need something Faith also act like that when I do this my eyes won't react to it the one who react is the ear because there is something about the ear that is connected to sound when it's sung the ear comes up they don't even ask you whether should that come out or what the ear will tell you which music you listen it's period Faith also when the faith of God is in you when something in his category pass his weather sometimes you sit on your porch and you are watching the neighbor just drinking maybe your cooker and suddenly what will you do right the eye told you that I didn't tell you who is there the I just told you that something is passing by it is up to you to investigate because whatever pass there went to the radar of the eye [Applause] goes to the invisible world in other words Faith have a reader looking this way that's right everybody okay everybody good whenever something crosses the red arrow faith Faith also react just like your eye react I don't know if you're kidding me you know the word faith is telling you a new house [Applause] you say what you say a new house God is sending something and I just caught it [Applause] you have to believe him [Applause] you will notice you are quiet energy and a dark job it is not you it is first who's there it's like a radar whenever something crosses you will hear him pick it up amen all that faith is telling you is look what God is saying but faith is cannot continue give me a few minutes Lord help me glory to God the super sense is the water Holy Spirit the faith of God that you as well in you another word God sent Cigna and God will receive it [Applause] okay that's fine he said if you let the five senses be yielded to the sixth senses he shall guard you and bring you all the way to the water so I've sent under control to that water super sins why do you think about the system suddenly she calls you who told you how did you know about it you were sitting like this and you say huh I'm thinking about sister so and so it has been a long time and suddenly the following and you look at that system who who told you how did you know sister so and so how many times did it happen to you who is telling you that this one is happening it is faithful according but you were not understanding his language you thought it's you thinking and suddenly when the sister called said huh this is strange I was just thinking about you right now you were not thinking about her it is faith that was bringing it don't worry my friend if you catch what I'm saying you will see the difference he said he make you believe since that water you cannot see it make you act where you do not think the five senses would ever what think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch the water super sense that is far beyond water his reach [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why a man will face doesn't go back because the devil cannot reach that it is in the holiest so the devil to reach Faith he must receive the Holy Ghost amen Lord help me brother Branham say in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is born with this senses so they are natural nature given senses and that is really only thing he shall ever know about it in his intellectual thinking he can only think as a man he can see as a man he can understand as a man he can heal as a man but [Applause] hold of him amen amen in doing so that super says raises him up into a spot to where he has Faith to believe things that he could not hear that he could not see understanding that he could not understand he believes it to anyone anyhow because he is governed by water [Music] oh how marvelous it is to know it and to think as simple it is to do what believing in other words faith is not you no sir faith it is God believing his own word amen because you were Fair but God's not fair no sir [Applause] oh God swallow this they did itself lays in the man that receives the water he says you are a son I'm a brother by birth and I'm part of Mr and Mrs Branham is a part of Mr and Mrs Barnum Abraham is in me and you become a son or a daughter of God part of deity leisure in you see how the devil raps you you say ow I can't do this all things are possible to them that do what believe no matter what it is you are part of what deity not a servant a son and a water daughter why brother he surpasses water oh Angel and water Archangel and everything else he come right into the presence of the Potter himself and how are we brought through the blood amen then you come into water you become a part you are wow well welded swallow this my friend free obstacle from human being they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden I was going to Chuck it but I'm going to water man is how omnipotent can you say amen amen say I am omnipotent I am omnipotent because the prophet said so and if I believe the prophet I will prosper [Applause] man is hell you don't believe that but he is a man how God is how omnipotent didn't he say in mouthwater eleven twenty two whatsoever thinks you say and don't doubt well in your heart it shall do what come to pass you can have what you want to say what happened when two what omnipotently one who and who man come out together jump here do whatever omnipotent something got water said [Applause] whatsoever you say with that creative of omnipotence of who God knowing that he did what promising and he said it well in his word he created water a power that does water goes out yonder and bring water things to pass things that is not and mix them as though they are because through omnipotents have met they stand oh isn't he wonderful wonderful so when God says something Faith catch it and one says catch it it is no longer in your hand father help me glory to God what is the success to do why do the sixes come the sixes came for this reason you in Canada the Sixth Sense is Faith the super sense the success came for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny what anything that is water contrary to water God's word that is what the success is what the scripture says whatever when we first hit you you don't listen anymore foreign [Applause] [Applause] you've been showing her symptom all along yes stop you heard so much negativity you feeling stopped you're giving too much contrary message you smell stop smelling too much I'm in control amen [Applause] Amen in other words says open the inside manner amen because the natural man is limited it's stuck [Applause] I'll let you handle it did you do anything so step out [Applause] Hallelujah so you walk by water The Sixth Sense you talk by water you live by water you die by water and you ask by water that's six cents that's why Paul said I walk by thing and not by what my work is faithful my speech is this my that super sense something that is well in you that is different from that from what the natural man is oh God help me how do you say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better Sixth Sense will never stand still for that no sir success would say it is what a lie I do it I feel better I'm water getting well God said so and that water amen God water success only feeds on water the word of God foreign [Music] is never negative [Applause] and he can't take negativity [Applause] because what he believes is so much real to him that you can shake him from it [Applause] that is super sense it is super above the water it's a greater sense it is water a power that does what and water it is something that make you do things that you never thought you would do [Applause] so if you have things you have not done yet it takes faith because faith will break your boundaries [Music] he only look at what God says if God said that's it I have to stop here let me listen to this there was a woman that had issue of God everybody okay everybody okay the scripture says I'm the Lord that he live for all that this is amen so to her she have to find the Lord and the Lord came in the man Jesus Christ so she went to Jesus but she can't get to Jesus amen amen she can't get to Jesus you follow me the scripture says he is the Lord that take off all these diseases but you get to get access when she tried somebody pushes she's off the floor then something told her and they told her something that is now written in the Bible [Applause] [Music] something told her you don't need it really him do you see not him do you see the clothing he's wearing [Music] the clothing is there any promise in the Bible that say clothing no you see that clothing look how he's hanging look at that spot look at that hanging like this go touch that one [Music] no scripture but Faith told her in other words Faith showed her where to get what she needs [Applause] everybody okay and she followed that voice and she went and she touched the Garment not Jesus the Garment of Jesus and not the top government the one I'm there when she takes the government Jesus said your faith not your thinking your faith so whoever spoke to the woman was faithful amen faith tells you where to catch God for your blessing amen when you are struggling to know which promise to go Faith won't direct you amen he will tell you use this and the woman touching Jesus stop he said you know how many people were touching him they were touching him but no faith but she didn't touch the man she touched Jesus by faith and when she touched Jesus by the faith Jesus stop and saying somebody touched me they say what he said I feel weak so the faith of that woman was getting straight from God [Applause] [Music] so the battery of Jesus went to law Yer [Applause] why because the woman listened to Faith and fell from something that was not even written [Applause] if something that is not written [Applause] if a devil can beg God here we are devil many of them they went before Jesus they said please we have a request and a specific request we want you to put us over there [Applause] Jesus gave it to them [Applause] specific requests [Applause] and you don't know how to pray you don't know how to pray [Applause] David God Jesus we don't want to go to hell don't send us to hell we want to go over there and Jesus understood why should I go to hell [Applause] the demon Jesus is Jesus is listening to the prayer of a demon and give the demon what he wants [Applause] a demon came in the time of Ahab and as he said Master please I know what to do I know how to deceive him and then when God say go ahead and do it even the devil asked God for permission for job but one time many times and God gave it to him [Applause] the devil who will be disappearing one day me who come from the launch of God [Applause] [Music] he who approached God must believe that he's that's why the Bible said the devil believes but they tremble but they believe one gives them the new birth but my believer I'm a son of God more than a ninja amen when I speak why should be God do you see how you block yourself you see how you block yourself you are afraid to ask he say ask abundantly so that your joy might be why are we blocking ourselves let me stop here we will continue [Applause] all I'm telling you I'm staring you up God put you in the promised land not to be watching the Philistine not to negotiate with the Philistines he already taught you to hunger to show you that you can depend on him now he's putting you on the promised land for you to start investigating what belongs to you everybody okay you cannot have a problem that you come we fit to church you go back with it you're coming to church you go back with it you go come to church you go back with him one year 20 years 30 years no one of this day the problem have to stay someone [Applause] like today we're talking about sister alcohols the dialysis stop someone [Applause] 14 is a complete circle it's over [Applause] you get to stop someone all right let's stand where did I stop oh my God yet we will catch that later amen oh my God fifth is the Sixth Sense we will get to where if you don't have faith you're struggling how do you put it I know when I say that somebody's saying huh faith is coming from God yes I would teach that I will show you what the prophet saying Amen in other words you must have faith somehow You Gotta Have It amen if not when the word is not mixed with faith you want profit the word when it comes he must mix with faith why because it's a bed that's the way you can pick up your blessing that's what God used to create the world brother Branham say when God spoke he believed his own words let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this afternoon father once again we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy and for your word that you have given us father our civilization gather hold of us for many years our tradition our custom the school that we went through we went to get education but we didn't realize also the other side what education was doing to us when it comes to your word yes until Lord father we are so educated minded that it becomes a hindrance unto the working of the Holy Spirit because everything have to make sense everything have to walk according to a pattern everything have to obey the physical laws that we start in school if it's out of order we call that magic we call that voodoo we're still giving more power to the devil than realizing that he's just a perverted but father you are bringing your children into a ram that they have to believe things they never thought they have to rise they're both what the six what the five senses is declaring so that they can access things in a different way because father the more we got The More We Begin clock but father unclog this channel so that we can look Beyond like the prophet of order and see the Unseen World and understand the Lord father that whatever we see is just limited to the senses but there is more things that are that is in the Unseen World then what we can see with our naked eye father the world of macrobiology declared yes that beyond the human eye there is many different Macross many germs many disease many macro organisms that we cannot even detect with our five senses Lord there are things living on our skin that we cannot even see with our naked eye Lord showing Lord that there is more than just what we can see in this visible world but father may you granted unto us this faith this access to the success so that we can break into that dimension and begin to call into existence things that doesn't seems like even they can happen because you created us in your own image you didn't take a material from the Earth you didn't take a material from the water you didn't take a material from something else but you draw material from your own self to create man in your own image in your own likeness and that's why you can declare that we are omnipotent that we are gods and that we were sent here to dominate to subdue to multiply to replenish because you blessed us father whatever is not conquered in the life of your children Lord may you reveal them [Music] your will about that specific faith just like you did for the woman with the issue of blood so that they can reach out to the blessing and father enjoy what you freely have suffered for it uncovery father we thank you for their dedication and the sacrifice to go extra mile father remember them and bless them and touch each one that was sick that came into this building and whoever came with a deed father may you granted unto them and give them Beyond and exceedingly above everything that they can ask and think we thank you and commit the remaining of the weekend to the Head may they have a more successful blessed week in the name of Jesus Christ God bless your church Amen Brother John [Applause] [Music] every promise in the book is mine every promise in the book is mine every chapter
