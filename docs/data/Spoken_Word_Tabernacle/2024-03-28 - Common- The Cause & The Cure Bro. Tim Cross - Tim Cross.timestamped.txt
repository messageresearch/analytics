[49:05] said we have the following Wednesday and
[49:07] so uh uh it's it's really a privileged
[49:10] to be with you I was thinking I don't
[49:12] know how many years ago it was when we
[49:15] first made contact and begin to
[49:17] Fellowship but um I see brother Ike here
[49:21] tonight all the way down from Michigan I

[49:29] and you're a part of us amen and uh
[49:32] we're just uh
[49:34] rehearsing what we're about to enjoy
[49:37] when eternity resumes amen and so um we
[49:41] the you know the the word of the Lord
[49:43] and the spirit of the Lord has Liberty
[49:45] amen and so we always feel that and uh
[49:48] I'm sorry my wife couldn't come with me
[49:50] tonight and and sing um but she's home
[49:53] with the our little daughter there uh
[49:55] Alysa and uh maybe looking in on the
[49:58] service tonight but uh bring greetings
[50:00] from her our pastor brother Josh Bennett
[50:03] uh the associate ministers that y'all
[50:05] wear out when they come here to
[50:07] preach I told someone the other day I
[50:09] said I'm going to brother shimbo
[50:11] Wednesday night I said I've got to start
[50:12] hydrating right now and start exercising
[50:17] and building myself up for what I know
[50:20] is going to happen so um and they they
[50:23] understand what I'm talking about so we
[50:26] really appreciate that and appreciate
[50:28] the goodness of the Lord and to hear we
[50:30] have two sisters here from the country
[50:32] of Sweden may the Lord bless you and uh
[50:35] you know you realize you you feel very
[50:37] small when you when you come into a
[50:39] service like this as a guest Minister
[50:41] especially and you realize God has
[50:44] ordained amen every facet of this
[50:47] service and I'm only a very small piece
[50:50] of it but I want to be yielded so he can
[50:52] have his way this evening and minister
[50:55] to every need in our midst that's that's
[50:57] the God we serve so let's turn in our
[50:59] Bibles tonight to Matthew
[51:01] 24 um I I never come up here feeling
[51:05] like i' I've got a message fully
[51:07] prepared it seems like God gives me
[51:09] pieces and then he puts the pieces
[51:12] together as the service goes on but
[51:15] um uh we'll read here in Matthew 24 uh
[51:18] beginning at verse 37 and uh I believe
[51:21] the title tonight would be common the
[51:25] cause and the Cure that's it amen let's
[51:28] ask the Lord's blessings over the
[51:31] reading of his word just before we read
[51:33] that tonight Heavenly Father we do give
[51:36] you thanks Lord that we could come this
[51:38] evening and gather Worship You Lord and
[51:41] for your presence to come among us as
[51:42] you promised and we pray now Lord that
[51:45] you'll break the bread of life to our
[51:46] hearts take the words from the pages
[51:49] Lord and Quicken them may they become
[51:52] revealed and expressed Lord from our
[51:55] very being we realize Lord that's why
[51:58] you sent your word yes Lord was for it
[52:00] to find bedding ground Lord and for it
[52:02] to manifest in our lives and so we're
[52:06] all here tonight Lord because we want
[52:08] your word to have a greater preeminence
[52:11] and Lord to dissolve everything in our
[52:13] lives that is not you Lord that you can
[52:16] be uh expressed in a greater way and so
[52:20] we believe tonight father God that the
[52:21] holy spirit is preeminent and we'll take
[52:25] every contrary Spirit under its control
[52:28] amen and may every sickness every
[52:31] symptom now Lord Jesus give place to the
[52:35] Holy Spirit as your children have come
[52:37] tonight Lord not to hear from a man but
[52:40] to hear from you Lord and God we're
[52:43] claiming the victory for the service and
[52:45] believing for every need to be met every
[52:48] promise to be fulfilled Lord and for
[52:51] what is needed to be now ministered to
[52:54] your children we ask you Lord to to be
[52:57] the preeminent one and to be pleased
[53:00] father we ask with all that is said and
[53:03] done Lord bind me Father God from
[53:05] speaking myself but Lord give Liberty
[53:09] and unction of the Holy Spirit father
[53:11] God for you to speak and have your way
[53:13] we thank you for it and ask it in the
[53:15] mighty and matchless name of our Lord
[53:18] and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen
[53:21] Matthew 24 we'll read uh verses
[53:24] beginning at verse 37 but as the days of
[53:27] Noah were so shall also the coming of
[53:31] the son of man be amen for as in the
[53:33] days that were before the flood they
[53:35] were eating and drinking marrying and
[53:38] given in marriage until the day that
[53:40] Noah entered into the ark and knew not
[53:43] until the flood came and took them all
[53:46] away so shall also the coming of the son
[53:50] of men be then shall two be in the field
[53:53] the one shall be taken the other left
[53:55] two women shall be G grinding at the
[53:57] Mill the one shall be taken and the
[53:59] other left watch therefore for ye know
[54:03] not what hour your lord doth come but
[54:06] know this that if the good man of the
[54:09] house had known in what watch the thief
[54:11] would come he would have watched and
[54:13] would not have suffered his house to be
[54:16] broken up therefore be ye also ready
[54:20] amen for in such an hour as you think
[54:24] not the son of man cometh all right who
[54:27] then is a faithful and wise servant whom
[54:30] his Lord hath made ruler over his
[54:32] household to give them meat in due
[54:35] season blessed is that servant whom his
[54:39] Lord when he cometh shall find so doing
[54:44] amen verily I say unto you that he shall
[54:46] make him ruler over all his Goods but
[54:50] and if that evil servant if that evil
[54:52] servant shall say in his heart my Lord
[54:55] delayeth his C coming and shall begin to
[54:58] Smite his fellow servants and to eat and
[55:01] drink with the drunken the Lord of that
[55:03] servant shall come in a day when he
[55:05] lookth not for him and in an hour that
[55:07] he is not aware of and shall cut him
[55:10] aunder and appoint him his portion with
[55:14] the Hypocrites and there shall be
[55:16] weeping and nashing of teeth may the
[55:18] Lord bless the reading of his word as
[55:20] you're seated tonight we'll refer to
[55:23] some other places in the scripture yes
[55:25] sir but this will give us a good
[55:27] starting point amen amen I I believe I
[55:30] can say tonight that common is one of
[55:34] the greatest enemies to the Church of
[55:38] the Living God that's exactly right and
[55:41] uh you know we we all have lived long
[55:43] enough to experience the what can happen
[55:46] yes sir when things become common that's
[55:49] exactly right you know uh it could be
[55:51] something as simple as a car you know
[55:53] when it's new or when it's new to you
[55:57] uh it's shiny it's got the new car smell
[55:59] the tires are fresh and everything about
[56:01] it and you know you you are just looking
[56:04] for a good reason to get in that car and
[56:07] drive
[56:08] somewhere you know and because it's it's
[56:11] new it's fresh and and you appreciate it
[56:14] amen you know you're going to get a lot
[56:15] of good use out of it but but just give
[56:17] that car a few months or a few years and
[56:20] the tires get worn down and you're
[56:22] having to make the payments and do the
[56:24] maintenance and all those things on it
[56:26] and and you'll be thinking man I I just
[56:28] need a new car you know I'm tired of
[56:30] this thing I'm tired of that rattle I'm
[56:33] tired of that shake I'm tired of that
[56:34] knock I'm tired of this and I'm tired of
[56:37] that you know and you think I I I I'm
[56:39] going I'm not even done paying for this
[56:41] thing but I'm ready to trade it in on
[56:44] something you know that's new that's
[56:47] fresh because you know and and and and
[56:49] the new car may not even be better but
[56:52] you're at least going to be excited
[56:53] about it and you're going to be enthused
[56:55] about it brother I I'm going to tell you
[56:58] a secret tonight that'll save you a
[56:59] whole lot of money go ahead my brother
[57:01] take that old raggedy beat up car that
[57:04] you're sick and tired of and just go out
[57:07] one Saturday morning amen before the
[57:09] kids get up and before the sun gets up
[57:11] way high in the sky before the phone
[57:13] starts ringing and all these
[57:15] distractions come and take that same car
[57:17] and give it a good wash that's it that's
[57:20] it give it a good vacuum and
[57:23] out spray it full of eror fresh yes some
[57:27] Tire wax it Tire polish it yes sir Shine
[57:30] the tires on it that's right clean the
[57:33] car up give it some tender love and care
[57:36] and attention for Sunday and you know
[57:38] what before long you'll have a new car
[57:40] again amen without a payment that's
[57:43] right without all those other headaches
[57:45] and misery that follows it in other
[57:47] words you just need to put some effort
[57:49] into it that's my brother to make it
[57:51] like new again yes my brother and you
[57:53] know as simple as that may seem some
[57:56] sometimes our Christian experience can
[57:58] be the same way amen you know starting
[58:01] off things are fresh things are new
[58:04] things are exciting things are
[58:06] exhilarating and there's an eager
[58:08] anticipation for every meeting that's
[58:11] right you know when a church is new to
[58:13] you man I can't wait to get to church
[58:16] brother I'm going to be the first one
[58:18] there amen I'm going to get my seat I'm
[58:21] going to pray I'm going to get ready
[58:23] amen I'm going to be ready for the word
[58:25] of the Lord I'm going be ready for the
[58:27] song leader amen and you're there amen
[58:29] you're putting a lot of effort a lot of
[58:32] preparation and there's a lot of
[58:34] anticipation amen because it's new to
[58:36] you all the people are new the building
[58:39] is new everything is new amen and you
[58:42] and you and you're just excited about it
[58:44] amen right well then after a few years
[58:47] man come on now is it Sunday morning
[58:50] again is it 10:00 again why can't they
[58:53] move to service time back at 30 minutes
[58:55] or an hour it's so hard to make it to
[58:57] church on time and man you know oh am I
[59:00] going to have to sit beside sister so
[59:02] and so again it's brother so and so G to
[59:05] sing lead the songs again and is brother
[59:07] Steven still on that same series that
[59:10] he's been on for huh ain't nothing
[59:14] changed that's right except your
[59:17] approach the new has worn
[59:20] off amen my brother oh brother I know
[59:25] it's the truth take amen the new has
[59:28] worn off that's right things become
[59:31] ordinary that's right and if you let it
[59:33] go it'll become dull and even dreary
[59:37] that's right where you will dread the
[59:39] very things amen you once couldn't wait
[59:42] to do Hallelujah and couldn't wait to be
[59:44] a part of it and you know what you're
[59:45] thinking I need a new
[59:47] church I need a new pastor preach I need
[59:51] new surroundings preach no friend you
[59:53] need a Revival that's exactly right you
[59:56] need God to do something new on the
[59:58] inside of you amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:01] glory to God oh my we often become
[1:00:04] disappointed there seems to be a decline
[1:00:07] that's right in the effect or the
[1:00:10] results while we're failing to recognize
[1:00:13] yes my brother we're not investing the
[1:00:15] same effort that's exactly right that we
[1:00:18] used to my brother so so the problem is
[1:00:20] not with everybody else no sir and the
[1:00:23] problem is not with the building and the
[1:00:25] property and the people and the pastor
[1:00:27] and the song leader and the same old
[1:00:28] same old amen the problem is much closer
[1:00:31] to home sometimes than what we really
[1:00:33] want with us so what I want to say
[1:00:35] tonight common is the enemy that's right
[1:00:38] common is the enemy of any relationship
[1:00:42] yes my brother amen friendships yes my
[1:00:45] brother friendships wne when the friends
[1:00:48] become common that's exactly right you
[1:00:51] know when you got a new friend you want
[1:00:53] him to come over for supper you want to
[1:00:55] take him ficient you want everything's
[1:00:58] new you're learning what all their
[1:01:00] interests all their likes are all these
[1:01:02] things and you're investing a lot of
[1:01:04] time and a lot of effort in a new
[1:01:06] friendship take your time my brother
[1:01:09] take your time I just going to say it
[1:01:10] take your time a new family moves into
[1:01:12] the area or comes to church everybody

[1:12:17] maintain that constant Hallelujah
[1:12:20] through thicker thin amen amen amen amen
[1:12:23] glory to God preach when you know you
[1:12:26] need it you appreciate we see it often
[1:12:27] times a Crist of strikes something is
[1:12:30] taken or you
[1:12:32] know you enter a situation it's a dire
[1:12:35] straight you realize I need God you get
[1:12:38] on your knees and you pray and you're
[1:12:40] fasting and you're you're taking time
[1:12:42] apart to be with the Lord and you draw
[1:12:44] close to the Lord again yes sir yes my
[1:12:46] well friend we should stay there that's
[1:12:48] it but we we don't because we're human
[1:12:52] we're human so it's an enemy to the
[1:12:54] marriage you know what I thought this is
[1:12:56] probably what what went wrong with
[1:12:58] Samson
[1:13:00] huh take your time his his power the the
[1:13:04] anointing of the holy spirit that would
[1:13:06] come over him to give him this
[1:13:07] superhuman power was a result of a vow
[1:13:11] right that was made right but I believe
[1:13:14] that the the the the the um the effect
[1:13:17] of that became common that's that's the
[1:13:21] problem to
[1:13:23] Samson he let let a gift he let a
[1:13:27] promise he let a divine blessing take
[1:13:29] your time become common take your time
[1:13:32] and when it did it began to
[1:13:35] lose the way he perceived its
[1:13:40] value it reached a place yes sir where
[1:13:44] it meant more to the
[1:13:47] Philistines than it meant to him take
[1:13:50] your time they never lost sight of how
[1:13:54] valuable that gift was that's exactly
[1:13:56] right until off after he had become
[1:13:59] their prisoner for many years that's
[1:14:01] exactly right but while it was losing
[1:14:04] its value to Samson take your time he
[1:14:07] was becoming weakened in his faith or in
[1:14:10] his appreciation that's right and he was
[1:14:13] on his road to Peril right he was on his
[1:14:16] way to becoming reduced right
[1:14:20] lower than his fellow man lower than his
[1:14:23] brother why because he began to play
[1:14:25] with that gift that's exactly right he
[1:14:27] could he could be with a prostitute and
[1:14:29] the gift would still work preach my
[1:14:31] brother preach now he could quit paying
[1:14:34] his
[1:14:34] tith and he would still get a blessing
[1:14:38] he could start missing church and God
[1:14:40] would still blessing he could start
[1:14:43] living loose and still God did not
[1:14:46] revoke the gift my so the gift would
[1:14:49] begin to operate and exercise itself and
[1:14:52] Samson thought you know no matter what I
[1:14:54] do your no matter how I live no matter
[1:14:58] what I do God loves me God has blessed
[1:15:01] me I'm Invincible I'm bulletproof I'm
[1:15:06] impenetrable and the whole time the
[1:15:08] Philistines were getting closer and
[1:15:10] closer and closer and closer brother and
[1:15:13] with every time he described her he
[1:15:15] thought you know he thought he thought
[1:15:17] he was seducing Delilah no she was
[1:15:19] seducing him that's exactly she never
[1:15:21] loved him Hallelujah she was an
[1:15:24] instrument in the hand of the
[1:15:26] Philistines brother to reduce him that's
[1:15:29] right to just another man glory to God
[1:15:32] my brother he lost his appreciation
[1:15:34] that's right friends I wonder if the
[1:15:36] same enemy isn't fighting against the
[1:15:37] bride of Christ that's exactly right
[1:15:40] that's exactly to make her lose her
[1:15:43] appreciation that's right not only for
[1:15:46] the prophet in his ministry but for the
[1:15:49] gifts God has placed in the body that's
[1:15:51] exactly to be the continuation of that
[1:15:54] Ministry right amen oh my friend Satan's
[1:15:58] real good at
[1:16:00] it oh my my brother there's even a
[1:16:03] there's even a proverb that deals with
[1:16:04] that how how the buyer will say it's
[1:16:07] nothing it's nothing until he takes it
[1:16:09] from you then he marks it up and resells
[1:16:11] it that's it so it's the enemy yes
[1:16:15] sir when
[1:16:18] leadership becomes common right right oh
[1:16:22] that's just brother shimbo take
[1:16:26] your he just or or that's just the
[1:16:29] deacons or that's just the trustees they
[1:16:32] become common take your time what
[1:16:34] happens is we lose our respect stay
[1:16:38] right there for the office stay right
[1:16:40] there for the position and see friends
[1:16:43] what we fail to realize is it's not the
[1:16:45] person alog together it's a channel that
[1:16:50] God has ordained for your
[1:16:53] benefit but you lose respect for the
[1:16:57] office and you get your eyes on the
[1:17:01] person and say well he's just as he's
[1:17:03] got the same mistakes got the same
[1:17:05] problems got the same fallacies that
[1:17:07] I've Got Friends it ain't about the
[1:17:10] person all
[1:17:11] together but God has placed that man in
[1:17:14] an office God has placed that person in
[1:17:16] an office for your benefit and if you
[1:17:19] can respect that and have regards to
[1:17:22] that God can bless bless you through
[1:17:25] that channel glory to God
[1:17:30] amen amen now now this is a this is an
[1:17:34] area I have to be careful because it it
[1:17:36] would sound like I'm condoning loose
[1:17:38] living in the ministry and I'm not sir
[1:17:40] no sir a Ministry is going to be
[1:17:42] accountable to God one day for every
[1:17:44] action and every statement yes my
[1:17:46] brother absolutely and there not only
[1:17:48] accountable to God is accountable also
[1:17:50] to the congregation that's exactly right
[1:17:53] absolutely yes absolutely Amen brother
[1:17:56] but I want to show you that even a
[1:17:58] backslid
[1:17:59] minister can be a channel for a blessing
[1:18:03] pre
[1:18:04] now it's in the Bible yes sir remember
[1:18:07] when Hannah was Desiring a child that's
[1:18:09] exactly right Eli was backslid that's
[1:18:12] right his sons were backslid that's
[1:18:15] right amen Israel was suffering as a
[1:18:17] result of a backsliding priesthood
[1:18:20] that's right but Hannah was looking
[1:18:23] beyond the priest
[1:18:25] and asking God for a promise amen and
[1:18:28] because she had
[1:18:30] respects yes my
[1:18:33] brother she had respects to the channel
[1:18:36] yes sir she still came to the temple to
[1:18:40] worship God to offer this sacrifice she
[1:18:44] didn't care how backsliding the
[1:18:46] preachers were she didn't care how much
[1:18:48] nonsense was going on she said I'm not
[1:18:51] here for the preacher I'm not here for
[1:18:53] the pastor I'm not here for the song
[1:18:55] leader I'm here to worship
[1:18:59] God glory to God Amen it is not what
[1:19:04] other people make of it it's what you
[1:19:06] make of it it's your respects it's your
[1:19:10] approach it's your sincerity God will
[1:19:14] bless through that channel amen when you
[1:19:16] have the right
[1:19:20] approach take your time my brother I'm
[1:19:22] sorry brother like this be my last
[1:19:27] service the pastor the pastor becomes
[1:19:31] common to the

[1:26:43] there was a Zeal there was a fervent

[1:26:52] my brother to every other thing glory to
[1:26:55] God Amen if we're going to get what we
[1:26:58] used to get we're going to have to do
[1:27:00] what we used to do brother oh but we're
[1:27:03] revelated now brother Tim pre my brother
[1:27:06] we got the Bible on our I phones and
[1:27:08] iPads we got the message
[1:27:11] 24/7 and it's lost its value come on
[1:27:15] come on we don't appreciate it like we
[1:27:17] did that's right when we used to get one
[1:27:19] book every couple months uhh or a new
[1:27:22] cassette tape you appreciate it when it
[1:27:24] was rare that's right when it was rare
[1:27:27] it had a higher perceived value yes my
[1:27:31] brother but it hasn't lost any of its
[1:27:34] worth still the same it's just the way
[1:27:37] we look at it that's exactly right take
[1:27:40] your time my brother preach go on a
[1:27:43] little farther yes sir take your time
[1:27:45] what I'm showing you is if it can happen
[1:27:46] to a servant of God a prophet of God it
[1:27:49] can happen to us too that's right he's
[1:27:51] here in the uh I believe it's in the
[1:27:53] message glor standing in the Gap yes sir
[1:27:56] he said you see even the great St
[1:27:58] Paul got between the Straits one time
[1:28:01] and and many times God has did these
[1:28:04] things yes sir did things or let his
[1:28:06] servants do it that was
[1:28:07] mistakes in order to prove these things
[1:28:10] well that would stump people God let his
[1:28:13] servants make mistakes to prove
[1:28:15] things yes
[1:28:17] sir now we know that human beings can
[1:28:19] make mistakes but God can make no
[1:28:22] mistake that's exactly like
[1:28:25] that is exactly right now if I get into
[1:28:26] the field of preaching and going the way
[1:28:28] I do then I have to set up meetings
[1:28:30] ahead and get things lined up and
[1:28:32] perhaps this great time is coming that
[1:28:33] we've been looking for this in itself is
[1:28:37] a tremendous thing that will bring to
[1:28:38] pass and make come to pass the
[1:28:40] tremendous Victory yes sir in the love
[1:28:42] divine the prophecy that went forth
[1:28:44] that's right that's the verb for the
[1:28:45] adverb it's divine love which is God
[1:28:49] Amen and it takes the love of God Amen
[1:28:53] to dash out there on the front line amen
[1:28:56] and stand in the Gap yes sir for the
[1:28:59] people amen well I'm going to stop there
[1:29:00] for a minute I'm going to say this take
[1:29:02] your time people who people who work in
[1:29:04] public service uh um doctors nurses
[1:29:09] healthc care uh you may work in the
[1:29:12] courts you may be a firefighter a police
[1:29:16] officer a a first
[1:29:19] responder and you deal with people right
[1:29:22] day in and day out yes you see them at
[1:29:26] their worst and maybe occasionally you
[1:29:28] see them at their best but over time you
[1:29:31] can become
[1:29:35] jaded and it just becomes
[1:29:42] routine it it's just you know you're
[1:29:44] just going through the
[1:29:46] motions and people stop becoming people
[1:29:51] and they become objects that's exactly
[1:29:53] right that's exactly right yes my
[1:29:56] brother just another drunk uhhuh just
[1:29:59] another drug that's it just another
[1:30:01] person eat up with this or eat up with
[1:30:02] that I just need this medicine or this
[1:30:05] and it becomes no more conscience we
[1:30:07] lose our compassion that's exactly we
[1:30:10] lose our care and we lose our concern
[1:30:14] and friends you lose the effectiveness
[1:30:18] that's exactly right of the Christian
[1:30:20] faith that's exactly right oh brother
[1:30:22] Tim I'm a Christian I love God you don't
[1:30:25] love God if you don't love his creation
[1:30:28] that's exactly like it if you don't love
[1:30:30] The Sinner if you don't love the person
[1:30:32] Amen in the in the in the gutter
[1:30:35] something is wrong you really don't love
[1:30:37] God that's exactly right because Jesus
[1:30:39] loved the
[1:30:41] sinner he was redeeming something back
[1:30:45] to
[1:30:46] himself that had been separated and lost
[1:30:50] in the fall yes my brother he came to
[1:30:53] seek and to save that which was lost and
[1:30:56] if his Divine attributes reside in you
[1:31:00] you will have to have the same
[1:31:03] compassion hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:05] hallelujah take your time if you've lost
[1:31:08] your feeling if you've lost your love if
[1:31:11] you've lost that care and that concern
[1:31:13] and that that genuine compassion friend
[1:31:15] you can't fake
[1:31:17] that people know they know when you care
[1:31:21] that's it they can tell by the look in
[1:31:23] your eyes they can feel your
[1:31:27] soul reaching out to them in compassion
[1:31:31] and friend that is the secret
[1:31:34] ingredient that is what makes you an
[1:31:37] extension of his healing his salvation
[1:31:42] his love when that opens up and begins
[1:31:45] to administer forth from your soul
[1:31:48] through your fingers through your hands
[1:31:50] Through Your Eyes through your prayers
[1:31:52] brother you be become the gospel
[1:31:56] live amen you become the revelation of
[1:32:00] the message of the hour you become the
[1:32:03] Bible live you become an extension or a
[1:32:07] continuation of the book of Acts my
[1:32:10] brother glory to God
[1:32:14] Amen there's a song that says bring back
[1:32:16] the new
[1:32:18] again sometimes that's all we need yes
[1:32:20] sir is for God to make it new again amen
[1:32:23] amen amen amen amen take your time my
[1:32:26] brother this happened to the prophet
[1:32:27] he's in paragraph 159 he said these
[1:32:29] Ricky and ricettas that have so sassed
[1:32:32] the word that I've called them Ricky and
[1:32:36] Retta God give me to understand that I
[1:32:39] shouldn't do that because that's many of
[1:32:42] them are still his children that's
[1:32:45] exactly right they can't help because
[1:32:48] they act so much different some of these
[1:32:50] old cold formal churches that's it has
[1:32:54] got them that Spirit upon them and
[1:32:57] they're as much in prison as Israel was
[1:33:00] in prison just as much as Moses went
[1:33:03] down to deliver them from slavery human
[1:33:06] beings that love Jesus Christ would
[1:33:09] serve him if they only know what to
[1:33:12] serve him by yes my brother and they're
[1:33:15] in bondage yes sir they're in bondage
[1:33:17] under denominationalism that tells them
[1:33:20] don't you do this don't you do that but
[1:33:23] the all of God must
[1:33:25] come whoever wants to March toward the
[1:33:28] promised land let him March we're on our
[1:33:31] road to the promised land amen let them
[1:33:35] come
[1:33:36] March I remind you of the time the
[1:33:38] disciples came to Jesus said Lord we
[1:33:40] found some folks casting out
[1:33:42] Devils yes and we we stopped them
[1:33:46] stopped they're not in our
[1:33:49] Circle they're not they're not wearing
[1:33:52] the belt buckles and
[1:33:54] and little pinss with special
[1:33:59] logos Jesus said if they're not against
[1:34:02] us they're for
[1:34:05] us let them
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:09] alone you know what some people's
[1:34:11] problem they're so
[1:34:14] insecure and what they want to believe
[1:34:16] is the truth anybody else that don't see
[1:34:18] it or say it quite the same way makes
[1:34:20] them so uncomfortable they want to put
[1:34:22] him out of the Kingdom
[1:34:25] amen uh it's
[1:34:27] true amen Moses lost the feeling of his
[1:34:31] people because they wouldn't listen to
[1:34:33] him it can happen it can happen to the
[1:34:36] best of pastors deacons trustees you get
[1:34:40] weary you get weary dealing with
[1:34:43] people but friends remember it isn't the
[1:34:46] people it's
[1:34:52] spirits and you got to have something
[1:34:56] greater you got to have something
[1:34:59] greater than what they have if you're
[1:35:02] going to conquer what's trying to
[1:35:04] conquer
[1:35:06] them and what the devil is really really
[1:35:10] good at is getting us to
[1:35:13] descend to his
[1:35:16] level and fight the way they
[1:35:19] fight and
[1:35:21] retaliate retaliate and tip tat and you
[1:35:24] start comparing what they say and you
[1:35:26] come back with friend you've already
[1:35:28] lost you've already lost you need the
[1:35:34] greater the greater will love will pray
[1:35:39] will
[1:35:40] Embrace will long for their amen Revival
[1:35:45] and
[1:35:46] restoration Love Will
[1:35:49] Conquer but it's got to be genuine you
[1:35:52] you you just can't you can't fake
[1:35:57] that Moses lost his feeling for the
[1:36:00] people because they wouldn't listen to
[1:36:01] him he's talking about brother Roy and a
[1:36:04] dream he had brother B said this
[1:36:07] something's got to change
[1:36:11] me now if God's Prophet could say that
[1:36:15] we're certainly not
[1:36:16] exempt something's got to change me
[1:36:20] because I in my heart if I go out there
[1:36:22] feeling that way I do now I still feel
[1:36:26] that they ought to have heard that
[1:36:27] message they ought to have done it and I
[1:36:30] don't have the feeling for the people
[1:36:34] that I should have until I get that
[1:36:38] feeling there is no need in me
[1:36:42] going because I'd be a hypocrite
[1:36:48] right let I ask you a question did the
[1:36:50] man have an
[1:36:52] office amen
[1:36:54] did he have a
[1:36:55] gift was any of that forfeited no but he
[1:36:59] said if I don't have that
[1:37:02] feeling I'm a
[1:37:06] hypocrite don't take things for
[1:37:10] gretting it had become
[1:37:13] common and all these years after all
[1:37:16] these years I've tried to serve him with
[1:37:18] a true heart I won't go out there being
[1:37:21] a hypocrite I got to feel feel that it
[1:37:24] isn't Rick andrietta and it isn't this
[1:37:26] Bunch it's God's children that's in
[1:37:29] bondage that I must go to and until I
[1:37:33] feel that way I'll just have to loaf
[1:37:36] around it's quite a statement you I love
[1:37:39] one thing about brother Bram I love
[1:37:41] everything about him but one thing
[1:37:43] especially he was so transparent yes he
[1:37:45] brother Bram was not a put on he he he
[1:37:49] was not a hypocrite no
[1:37:52] pretenses pray
[1:37:54] that God will place into my heart that
[1:37:58] something that I lost out there in that
[1:38:03] complex it's so easy to build a
[1:38:08] complex I had an interview the other day
[1:38:10] with brother way sitting there standing
[1:38:12] here in front a good man but but built
[1:38:15] himself around a complex another kind of
[1:38:18] a complex did the same thing brother way
[1:38:21] you can so easily do it
[1:38:24] it's just you let a little something in
[1:38:27] your mind keep thinking that
[1:38:31] way go back and check it with the
[1:38:34] scripture and see if it's right or not
[1:38:36] and then go from there on my friend I
[1:38:40] I'm I've lived long enough to know how
[1:38:42] the devil
[1:38:43] Works he will put an idea in your head
[1:38:48] and that thing will sit there and
[1:38:52] fester and form and you will
[1:38:56] imagine someone else feels a certain way
[1:39:00] about you and there could be no basis to
[1:39:04] it
[1:39:07] whatsoever but as long as you let that
[1:39:09] thing stay there in your mind the
[1:39:11] devil's going to keep watering it and
[1:39:13] Fanning it and trying to grow that
[1:39:17] thing you know I I know a Pulpit is not
[1:39:21] a place for jokes but I heard some years
[1:39:24] ago said a man broke down on the side of
[1:39:26] the road this is many many years ago uh
[1:39:29] broke down on the side of the road and
[1:39:30] needed a tune like a a tire uh lug nut
[1:39:33] wrench taking the tire off and he didn't
[1:39:35] have one and he saw way off down in the
[1:39:37] distance there was a a a candle lit you
[1:39:39] can see some light coming from a a cabin
[1:39:42] and so uh he knew they'd gone to bed but
[1:39:45] somehow they left it on but anyway he
[1:39:47] walked and walked and walked and you the
[1:39:49] whole time he's walking he's said you
[1:39:51] know what I'm going to wake these people
[1:39:52] up
[1:39:53] they're going to be tired they're going
[1:39:56] to be weary they're going to be ill
[1:39:58] they're going to be upset that I woke
[1:39:59] him up and the whole time he's
[1:40:01] approaching this house he's building in
[1:40:03] his mind I'm going to be resented I'm
[1:40:06] going to be despised they're going to be
[1:40:10] so they're going to be
[1:40:13] furious and he finally got the courage
[1:40:15] to knock on the door and man it and
[1:40:17] before he could say how could I help he
[1:40:18] said fine I didn't want your old wrench
[1:40:22] anyhow
[1:40:25] he was defeated in his
[1:40:28] mind and the man was more than happy to
[1:40:31] help him but that is what the devil
[1:40:35] does and you know what he'll get you so
[1:40:38] cornered he'll get you so corned in a
[1:40:41] prison that he may you won't have the
[1:40:44] courage to go confront it or approach
[1:40:47] that brother approach that sister and
[1:40:49] clear the air and brother I can't stand
[1:40:51] that I can't stand that if something's
[1:40:54] there and I feel that and I think that's
[1:40:56] going on I just go right up to the
[1:40:58] brother I go right up to the sister amen
[1:41:00] and I'm going to do the opposite I'm
[1:41:02] going to speak to him I'm going to talk
[1:41:04] to him I'm going to defeat that
[1:41:07] Spirit I'll buy him lunch I'll do
[1:41:10] whatever it takes amen I don't want no
[1:41:13] qualms I don't want no weird feelings I
[1:41:16] don't want it because that is nothing
[1:41:18] but the devil trying to bring division
[1:41:21] in the body of Christ because he knows
[1:41:24] how powerful we are when we are unified
[1:41:29] together
[1:41:30] amen blessed be the tith that binds our
[1:41:34] hearts in Christian Love The Fellowship
[1:41:36] of Kindred Minds is like to that
[1:41:39] above
[1:41:41] amen oh my I got to get to the I got to
[1:41:46] get to the
[1:41:47] Cure well I I got to go to the
[1:41:50] scripture y'all shouldn't say take your
[1:41:52] time
[1:41:54] everybody who knows me knows you don't
[1:41:55] say
[1:41:57] that but I want you to watch because
[1:41:59] Jude and Peter both discerned what was
[1:42:04] going to take place and was already
[1:42:07] forming in the early Christian Church
[1:42:11] only a few years after the Lord Jesus
[1:42:15] ascended I want you to read uh uh
[1:42:17] Scofield's note here in the in the
[1:42:20] heading of Jude he said it is not so
[1:42:22] much Jude who speaks as the constraining
[1:42:26] spirit and the theme is contending for
[1:42:30] the faith in other words you're not
[1:42:32] taking it for granted you're
[1:42:35] fighting to maintain it and to keep it
[1:42:40] amen don't let it become
[1:42:42] common and he says in this brief letter
[1:42:45] the apostasy of the professing church is
[1:42:48] predicted and the cause and course
[1:42:50] described as in second Timothy and and
[1:42:53] second Peter the apostasy is treated as
[1:42:57] already having set
[1:42:59] in now if it was starting there how much
[1:43:02] worse is it
[1:43:03] now but Jude Jude addresses the church
[1:43:06] and he says Jude the servant of Jesus
[1:43:08] Christ and brother of James to them that
[1:43:10] are Sanctified by God the father and
[1:43:13] preserved in Jesus Christ and called
[1:43:16] Mercy unto you and peace and love be
[1:43:19] multiplied beloved when I gave all
[1:43:22] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:43:24] common
[1:43:25] salvation it was needful for me to write
[1:43:29] unto you and exort you that you should
[1:43:32] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:43:37] was once delivered unto the Saints for
[1:43:40] there are certain men crept in
[1:43:43] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:43:46] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:43:49] the grace of our God into lasciviousness
[1:43:53] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:43:55] Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put
[1:43:59] you in
[1:44:00] remembrance though ye once knew this how
[1:44:04] that the Lord having saved the people
[1:44:06] out of the land of Egypt afterward
[1:44:08] destroyed them that believed not and the
[1:44:13] angels which kept not their uh their
[1:44:16] first
[1:44:17] estate but have left their habitation he
[1:44:21] hath reserved in ever lasting chains
[1:44:24] under Darkness unto the Judgment of this
[1:44:26] great day even as Sodom and gomor and
[1:44:28] the cities about them in like manner
[1:44:30] giving themselves over to fornication
[1:44:32] and going after strange flesh are set
[1:44:35] forth for an example suffering the
[1:44:37] Vengeance of Eternal fire now he goes on
[1:44:40] and I I know it's getting late
[1:44:43] but Lord help us we're going to we're
[1:44:45] going to get to the
[1:44:47] Cure likewise Yet Michael the Archangel
[1:44:52] when cont contending with the devil he
[1:44:55] dis he
[1:44:59] disputed about the body of Moses Durst
[1:45:03] not bring against him a railing
[1:45:06] accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee
[1:45:09] he knew this was an archangel who had
[1:45:12] fallen and he didn't argue with
[1:45:15] him he didn't lower himself to the level
[1:45:18] of Satan he said you might have fallen
[1:45:20] but I'm not Fallen with you he just said
[1:45:23] the Lord rebuke
[1:45:25] you
[1:45:27] amen but these these speak evil of those
[1:45:32] things which they know not but what they
[1:45:35] know naturally as brute beasts in those
[1:45:38] things they corrupt themselves woe unto
[1:45:41] them for they have gone in the way of
[1:45:43] Cain and ran greedily after the error of
[1:45:46] balum for reward and perished in the
[1:45:50] gain saying of Kor these are spots in
[1:45:53] your Feast of Charity when they Feast
[1:45:56] with you feeding themselves without fear
[1:45:59] clouds are they are without water
[1:46:01] carried about of winds trees whose fruit
[1:46:04] withth without fruit twice dead plucked
[1:46:07] up by the roots I'm just reading down
[1:46:09] through here for continuity Raging Waves
[1:46:12] of the sea foaming out their own shame
[1:46:14] wondering
[1:46:16] Stars wondering from church to church
[1:46:20] ministry to Ministry Pillar To Post
[1:46:23] spectacular to
[1:46:26] spectacular to whom is reserved the
[1:46:28] Blackness of Darkness forever and Enoch
[1:46:32] our type also the seventh from Adam
[1:46:35] prophesied of these saying behold the
[1:46:37] Lord cometh with 10, thousands of his
[1:46:39] Saints to execute judgment upon all and
[1:46:43] to convince all that are ungodly among
[1:46:45] them of all their ungodly Deeds which
[1:46:48] they have ungodly committed and of all
[1:46:50] their hard speeches which ungodly
[1:46:53] Sinners have spoken against
[1:46:56] him now he's going to describe it there
[1:47:00] are
[1:47:01] murmurers
[1:47:02] complainers walking after their own lust
[1:47:06] and their mouth speaketh great swelling
[1:47:09] words having men's persons in
[1:47:14] admiration because of
[1:47:18] Advantage
[1:47:20] politics this person can do something
[1:47:22] something for me therefore I'm going to
[1:47:25] praise them adore them exalt them and be
[1:47:29] as close to them as I can what that
[1:47:31] person is doing for you is taking you
[1:47:36] down but because you think you're going
[1:47:38] to gain something by your association
[1:47:40] with him they have pulled you in just
[1:47:43] like Satan pulled onethird of the stars
[1:47:46] but they didn't go up they went
[1:47:50] down but beloved remember ye the Words
[1:47:53] which were spoken before of the
[1:47:55] Apostles you hear a recurring theme here
[1:47:58] remember remember remen I will not be I
[1:48:03] will I will not neglect to put you in
[1:48:07] remembrance how that they told you there
[1:48:09] would be mockers in the last time who
[1:48:13] should walk after their own lust these
[1:48:15] be they who separate themselves sensual
[1:48:20] having not the spirit
[1:48:23] friend everything that's spiritual don't
[1:48:25] come from
[1:48:27] God the devil is very spiritual and has
[1:48:30] a whole lot of Supernatural things that
[1:48:32] are
[1:48:34] demonic so just because it's got a
[1:48:36] supernatural manifestation don't mean it
[1:48:38] come from God take it to the word if
[1:48:41] it's not saying what the prophet said

[1:49:41] would that word hot or
[1:49:49] cold man I got some good inspiration out
[1:49:51] of this too
[1:49:53] God does not want us to be
[1:49:57] thermometers they only tell the
[1:50:00] temperature God wants us to be
[1:50:03] thermostats they can change the
[1:50:05] temperature they are connected to a
[1:50:08] source of
[1:50:10] energy and they can be
[1:50:13] tuned
[1:50:14] amen God they threw three thermostats in
[1:50:18] the fiery furnace one time and God come
[1:50:21] along and cooled It Off
[1:50:24] and they threw two of them in a
[1:50:25] Philippian jail one time and God busted
[1:50:28] a place apart to get them out of
[1:50:31] there amen you can change the
[1:50:35] atmosphere amen where you work oh my

[1:51:04] they was afraid they were fearful they
[1:51:07] were cowards they were weak they were
[1:51:09] waiting on power brother right but when
[1:51:11] they come out of that upper room they
[1:51:13] was making a difference the Holy Ghost
[1:51:17] is the cure for the common Christian a
[1:51:20] refilling an initial feeling the baptism
[1:51:24] of the Holy Ghost will set you on fire
[1:51:27] and Quicken the very life of God from
[1:51:29] the very core of your
[1:51:32] being
[1:51:35] [Applause]
[1:51:36] amen but there's three Rs and I am
[1:51:40] closing three
[1:51:42] hours
[1:51:45] repentance and the
[1:51:47] return you won't have a Revival without
[1:51:51] it amen honey I'm
[1:51:55] wrong hardest words for man to
[1:52:00] say I know it is I'm a man it's the
[1:52:03] hardest thing to confess I was wrong
[1:52:05] honey you were
[1:52:07] right but
[1:52:09] said you want the spark back you want
[1:52:13] the flame back you want the love back
[1:52:17] amen you don't need a new car you don't
[1:52:20] need a new wife you don't need a new
[1:52:22] husband you don't need a new church you
[1:52:25] need to appreciate the one you have and
[1:52:29] put some effort put some time put some
[1:52:31] energy forsaking other things Hallelujah
[1:52:36] forsaking all others cleave thee only
[1:52:39] unto her cleave thee only unto him just
[1:52:41] go back to your original
[1:52:44] vow read The Vow amen that you said over
[1:52:49] her with God as your
[1:52:51] witness am amen
[1:52:54] repentance and a
[1:52:57] return and
[1:52:59] restoration
[1:53:01] restoration before the fire fell on the
[1:53:04] altar Elijah put the stones back in
[1:53:06] their place because you won't get a
[1:53:09] Revival fire without a restoration that
[1:53:12] precedes
[1:53:13] it and I've already touched on it but
[1:53:15] friends get things back in their proper
[1:53:18] order leoa has a good way has a powerful
[1:53:23] way it's not good a powerful way of
[1:53:25] rearranging our priorities to where
[1:53:28] everything is out of place and God has
[1:53:30] taking last
[1:53:34] place and the marriage the family
[1:53:37] everything begins to disolve apart it
[1:53:39] begins to disintegrate because God lost
[1:53:42] his
[1:53:43] place restoration involves putting
[1:53:46] things back in their
[1:53:49] place put the family altar back in the
[1:53:53] home put Bible reading and prayer back
[1:53:56] in your daily
[1:53:58] regimen start your day and in your day
[1:54:02] and all throughout the
[1:54:04] day make God an integral part of your
[1:54:10] day and then Revival will
[1:54:13] follow
[1:54:15] amen I got out one of my favorite books
[1:54:17] the other day and I started reading it
[1:54:19] again and I was reminded of why it's one
[1:54:21] of my favorite
[1:54:23] books is it all right if I show it to
[1:54:26] you brother George Smith has kind of
[1:54:29] taking it and uh reindexed it just a bit
[1:54:32] but it's the same
[1:54:34] contents
[1:54:36] amen let me show you another reason why
[1:54:41] Satan hates this book of the revelation
[1:54:45] of Jesus Christ in the church he knows
[1:54:48] that Jesus Christ is the
[1:54:50] same same
[1:54:52] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:54:54] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:54:57] more than do 90% of the theologians
[1:55:00] remember the Philistines didn't lose
[1:55:02] their appreciation it was
[1:55:05] Samson that first lost it and he didn't
[1:55:09] regain it until the Philistines lost
[1:55:12] their
[1:55:14] remembrance to keep that hair
[1:55:18] trend when they begin to take him for
[1:55:21] granted
[1:55:22] they laid off the barber at the wrong
[1:55:28] time
[1:55:32] amen he knows that since God is
[1:55:34] immutable in his nature then he is just
[1:55:37] as immutable in his ways thus Satan
[1:55:39] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:55:42] at Pentecost with the power of God Mark
[1:55:46] 16 in action is the true church that
[1:55:49] Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:55:53] false it has to be now remember this
[1:55:56] Christ in the true church is a
[1:56:00] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:56:03] Book of Revelation shows that the
[1:56:04] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:56:06] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:56:09] formal and
[1:56:11] Powerless
[1:56:13] common
[1:56:16] casual it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:56:20] works the attempted destruction of God's
[1:56:22] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:56:24] word right down to the time he is cast
[1:56:26] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:56:28] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:56:33] people get the true revelation of the
[1:56:36] true church and what she is what she
[1:56:39] stands for and that she can do the
[1:56:42] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[1:56:46] Army if they get a true revelation of
[1:56:49] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:56:50] the Christian church
[1:56:52] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:56:57] withstand the Antichrist
[1:57:00] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:57:04] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[1:57:07] today as when Christ withstood his every
[1:57:09] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:57:11] desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we
[1:57:15] love
[1:57:16] it with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:57:20] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:57:24] but we will prevail over them
[1:57:27] amen friends I've got to close tonight
[1:57:30] it's it's it's getting
[1:57:32] late but go read if you will if you want
[1:57:35] a homework assignment go read the entire
[1:57:37] Epistle of second Peter because he's
[1:57:41] hitting the same exact themes that Jude
[1:57:45] did they both by the revelation of the
[1:57:49] Holy Spirit were able to see that and
[1:57:52] Antichrist Spirit already creeping in in
[1:57:56] the early church and its effects in the
[1:57:59] day and hour which we're living but it
[1:58:02] teaches us to be
[1:58:04] vigilant To Be
[1:58:06] watchful we want to be that
[1:58:09] servant that the master finds so doing
[1:58:14] at his return we want to be living in
[1:58:17] eager anticipation every day brother
[1:58:20] Kelly looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:58:22] Lord Jesus amen we don't want to grow
[1:58:26] relaxed or casual and we don't want to
[1:58:29] let our experience grow that and friends
[1:58:31] if that's where you are tonight you can
[1:58:33] be revived you can be renewed you can be
[1:58:37] drawn back into that you can experience
[1:58:40] that all over again and you may
[1:58:42] appreciate it more the second time than
[1:58:44] you did the first but just know that's
[1:58:46] for you tonight amen and and and and God

[1:59:41] sometimes they have visitors be a couple
[1:59:43] more but there's a little song they sing
[1:59:46] and I heard y'all singing that song

[1:59:50] enough for not praising

[2:09:00] anymore why you never been there why
[2:09:03] every time there is a meeting you got a
[2:09:06] reason why why every day there is a
[2:09:10] church you got a
[2:09:11] problem and it doesn't even bother you
[2:09:14] to stream because you got used to be
[2:09:17] streaming I can be I can do whatever you
[2:09:20] don't even search for for a solution to
[2:09:23] come out from your situation because I
[2:09:25] can stay home and I can stream if it's a
[2:09:27] little bit of rain streaming if the
[2:09:30] weather is dark
[2:09:33] streaming if the dog is coughing
[2:09:37] streaming I'm going very low so you
[2:09:40] understand what I'm saying don't let
[2:09:42] this become
[2:09:44] common this is a great warning for
[2:09:47] everybody don't let the ministry don't
[2:09:50] let the Deacon don't let the the song
[2:09:51] leader become chroma I appreciate the
[2:09:55] song leader standing here doing his job
[2:09:57] I appreciate the one playing in the
[2:09:59] piano when he take a day off you will
[2:10:02] realize he need to be there when he's
[2:10:04] not there you will realize we need
[2:10:06] somebody on the guitar when he's not
[2:10:08] there you will realize we need somebody
[2:10:10] on the base everything is sounding
[2:10:12] beautiful we all love the worship
[2:10:14] tonight watch here you will see
[2:10:16] everybody is on their postor
[2:10:19] Duty and brother Bram say he was not
[2:10:21] even putting meeting on Sunday morning
[2:10:24] because everybody need to go back to
[2:10:26] their post of Duty post of Duty doesn't
[2:10:29] mean that you have to be a minister or a
[2:10:32] deacon or a
[2:10:35] singer if you only come to church on
[2:10:38] time because you a musician something is
[2:10:49] wrong probably amen if you only have to
[2:10:54] come on time in the service because you
[2:10:56] have a responsibility something is
[2:10:59] wrong because if they take
[2:11:01] responsibility off guess what you don't
[2:11:03] have to be in church on time you can
[2:11:05] come late because I'm not a trustee I'm
[2:11:07] not a deacon I'm not a technician I'm
[2:11:09] not a musician that's a wrong
[2:11:12] approach in other word they they want
[2:11:15] doing the work me I'm just enjoying
[2:11:17] that's
[2:11:18] wrong postor Duty might be just sitting
[2:11:21] in the church and saying amen that is
[2:11:25] your post of
[2:11:26] [Applause]
[2:11:28] Duty there was a sister by the name of
[2:11:31] sister
[2:11:32] Bell she died and brother Bram on tape
[2:11:35] is saying how much am I going to miss
[2:11:38] those big amen so when brother brandham
[2:11:40] was preaching God was using the amen of
[2:11:43] that sister to stimulate brother Bram so
[2:11:46] that brother Bram can preach more but if
[2:11:48] you're not
[2:11:50] there if you streaming all the time what
[2:11:53] do you expect from the
[2:11:57] kids post of Duty means sitting right
[2:12:00] there it's your post to do this is why
[2:12:03] people do not understand they think that
[2:12:05] okay find your position in Christ means
[2:12:07] okay I got to be a deacon I got to be a
[2:12:09] minister that doesn't not everybody is
[2:12:11] going to speak in tongue Paul say no God
[2:12:14] forbid it's not going to happen your
[2:12:16] position could be just clapping hand
[2:12:19] maybe the tambourine sister Hamilton is
[2:12:22] playing over there that's her Ministry
[2:12:24] to the Lord if she's not there we feel
[2:12:27] like something is missing so do you only
[2:12:29] come to church when we're going to give
[2:12:31] you a position so if I take you to a
[2:12:34] position if I tell you to sit down you
[2:12:35] don't come to church on time
[2:12:38] anymore do you see what we doing because
[2:12:41] we don't understand what God is doing
[2:12:43] you being here you on the post of Duty
[2:12:47] you receiving the word you on your post
[2:12:49] of Duty you saying amen on the post of
[2:12:53] Duty whoever is here it's on the post of
[2:12:56] Duty post of Duty is in your church
[2:12:58] right there on your pews whoever is
[2:13:00] sitting there it's on the PE you on the
[2:13:02] even the mama who's sitting there with
[2:13:04] the kids and nursing the baby they in
[2:13:06] the post Dy they would probably never
[2:13:09] preach the gospel but that's their post
[2:13:10] of
[2:13:12] Duty sir amen do not let this become
[2:13:17] common people are far away you don't
[2:13:19] know how many email how many phone call

[2:13:25] email for month that I cannot
[2:13:27] respond you get it for

[2:14:25] common everything is common and the next
[2:14:27] thing that start is a criticism
[2:14:31] Spirit then you begin to criticize the
[2:14:33] song leader not about the song but about
[2:14:36] maybe the wayes the voice was going
[2:14:38] maybe a voice it's not about the
[2:14:41] voice it's a Ministry but when you are
[2:14:43] under the anointing of the spirit you
[2:14:45] don't see all those kind of stuff but

[2:15:01] you a solution or at the end of the day
