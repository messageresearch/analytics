[26:35] prayer request unspoken and then our
[26:38] praise report amen
[26:46] thank you
[26:50] so good
[26:52] um I just like to give a little
[26:54] testimony before we pray
[26:57] and this might encourage somebody along
[26:59] the way and some people might think well
[27:01] this is silly
[27:04] but
[27:05] the message that was playing the Third
[27:07] Exodus brother Branham said it's so
[27:10] simple
[27:11] that most of the time it goes right over
[27:13] us
[27:16] well last week I went to Waffle House to
[27:18] get something to eat
[27:19] and I ordered a Cheesesteak omelet and
[27:23] I'm sitting there thinking well I might
[27:25] order a side of bacon too
[27:28] and
[27:29] I was I was just thinking that
[27:32] and but I didn't so I went ahead and
[27:35] ordered my food and she brought it
[27:37] and a few minutes later
[27:40] she brings over this plate of bacon
[27:46] and I'm thinking to myself did I tell
[27:49] her I wanted that
[27:52] and uh
[27:54] so I went ahead and ate
[27:56] and the waitress there her name is Sue
[27:59] and I said sue did did I tell you I
[28:02] wanted to side of bacon
[28:03] and she said no she said but we just had
[28:06] extra and I just brought it to you
[28:09] you know
[28:09] [Music]
[28:11] [Applause]
[28:18] and the scripture that hit me was
[28:22] before they speak
[28:23] I will answer
[28:25] [Applause]
[28:33] so maybe that will encourage somebody
[28:35] along the way and I know
[28:38] your wife is listening in right
[28:41] and maybe this will encourage her that
[28:44] she just thinks about them new kidneys
[28:49] and they'll they'll they'll be there
[28:52] you know
[28:59] so let us pray
[29:01] father we come before you father what
[29:04] what a word that you have given to us
[29:06] father in this day
[29:08] father just thoughts come to pass
[29:12] Lord and before we speak you're there to
[29:16] answer
[29:18] father how what a privileged people we
[29:21] are
[29:22] to know these things father
[29:25] to hear the word father that you're
[29:27] bringing forth in this day father
[29:30] Lord we can't
[29:32] some it's like the prophet said so we
[29:35] can't even sometimes rap wrap our minds
[29:38] around it father
[29:40] but Lord we know as you brought forth
[29:43] Sunday
[29:44] the only difference is is that seed
[29:46] that's laying inside there that was put
[29:49] there before the foundation of the world
[29:52] that's the only difference
[29:54] without that there's nothing we can do
[29:57] to get it and with it there's nothing we
[30:00] can do to miss it
[30:02] father how simple it is
[30:05] and Lord let us dwell in this simplicity
[30:10] of what you are and who you are
[30:14] and what we are and Who We Are
[30:19] I know Satan will try to knock us down
[30:22] and say well you're not that because of
[30:25] these thoughts that go through your head
[30:26] and things that you do during the day
[30:29] you're not one of them
[30:31] but Lord
[30:32] every time that those thoughts come to
[30:35] us father you'll raise up a standard
[30:38] against it
[30:41] so father as We Gather here this evening
[30:43] father
[30:44] to hear your word Lord we let us as it
[30:48] were to throw open every door and every
[30:51] window of our heart father
[30:53] every little secret place that may be
[30:56] hidden father let us open up that door
[30:59] father that you may come in and speak to
[31:01] us
[31:02] you may drive those things out that not
[31:05] that's not like you
[31:07] and father we we just we don't want to
[31:10] we we want to remember Sister across
[31:12] Lord
[31:14] and Lord let a thought be planted in her
[31:16] in her heart Lord that those kidneys are
[31:20] waiting on her and she's just got to
[31:22] step out there and claim it
[31:26] and Lord the special request request
[31:28] that I have in my heart father you know
[31:30] the situation there father and we just
[31:33] bring that before you
[31:35] Lord for you to work that out according
[31:37] to your will your purpose father
[31:40] and Lord we just rest in the fact
[31:43] that everything is in your control
[31:46] you wrote out this great play before the
[31:50] foundation of the world

[53:51] Samuel chapter 17. just say It's a
[53:54] Wonderful privilege to be with you again
[53:56] this evening every time I see a text or
[54:00] a call from the Stephen my heart rate
[54:02] goes up my blood pressure goes up I get
[54:05] excited because I don't know if I'm one
[54:08] of your favorite evangelists but this is
[54:10] one of my favorite places to come and
[54:12] Minister amen just where the spirit of
[54:15] the Lord is there's liberty and always
[54:17] fill a liberty here when among the
[54:20] saints and I I might have said this
[54:22] before but when y'all come to church
[54:24] y'all come to have church and so amen I
[54:27] believe I believe that's the kind of
[54:29] atmosphere where miracles happen where
[54:32] bands are broken amen and where and
[54:34] where God moves so we thank the Lord for
[54:37] that appreciate brother Stephen tonight
[54:38] and each of you that have come this
[54:41] evening to feed upon the word of the
[54:42] Lord we're going to read in first Samuel
[54:44] first Samuel chapter 17 beginning at
[54:48] verse number 24 and
[54:50] um
[54:52] just believe the Lord to
[54:54] bless the reading of his word this
[54:56] evening amen first Samuel chapter 17 you
[55:00] know I find that oftentimes when I come
[55:02] here without having listened or tuned in
[55:05] to the services prior the holy spirit
[55:08] will just set it right in there and it's
[55:10] just a perfect uh continuation or in
[55:13] continuity with what the holy spirit's
[55:16] been ministering so that was going on
[55:17] with the songs tonight even that last
[55:20] song brother Stephen that you requested
[55:22] it was just Paving the laying the
[55:24] groundwork for what was on my heart I
[55:26] said my that's that's very reassuring as
[55:29] a minister so amen first Samuel 17 verse
[55:33] 24 and all the men of Israel when they
[55:36] saw the man
[55:37] fled from him and were so afraid and the
[55:41] men of Israel said have you seen this
[55:42] man that has come up surely to defy
[55:45] Israel as he come up and it shall be
[55:47] that the man who killeth him the king
[55:50] will enrich him with great riches and
[55:53] will give him his daughter and make his
[55:55] father's house free in Israel
[55:58] as you read that last sentence
[56:00] make his father's house free
[56:03] How could a man that was a king over the
[56:07] people of God give them any freedom
[56:08] greater than what God had already
[56:10] granted to them
[56:12] but this was a king that was the choice
[56:14] of the people and was premature to God's
[56:19] institution of a real Godly King over
[56:21] Israel
[56:22] so they come under the bondage of a man
[56:25] they chose to be you know their leader
[56:29] Head and Shoulders Above the Rest amen
[56:31] so be careful what you what you when you
[56:34] get ahead of God's timing a lot of times
[56:36] you're putting yourself under bondage
[56:38] is that right and in verse 26 and David
[56:41] spake to the men that stood by him
[56:43] saying what shall be done to the men
[56:45] that killeth this Philistine and taketh
[56:49] away the reproach from Israel for who is
[56:53] this uncircumcised Philistine that he
[56:57] should defy the armies of the Living God
[56:59] and the people answered him after this
[57:02] matter saying so shall it be done to the
[57:04] man that killeth him
[57:06] and Elia
[57:08] his eldest brother
[57:11] heard when he spake unto the men and
[57:14] eliab's anger was kindled against David
[57:17] and he said why came as thou down hither
[57:20] and with whom has thou left those few
[57:22] sheep in the wilderness he was mocking
[57:24] him
[57:25] I Know Thy pride in the naughtiness of
[57:28] thine heart for thou art come down to
[57:30] thou might as see the bow
[57:32] and David said what have I now done
[57:36] is there not
[57:38] a Cause
[57:39] and those five words are what I'd like
[57:41] to title this message tonight as you're
[57:43] seated is there not a Cause
[57:47] amen amen I'm going to share something
[57:50] with you here in just a moment
[57:54] I might have read this before I don't
[57:56] know but um
[57:57] you know the the nice thing about
[58:00] in our battle as Christians you know
[58:04] most most armies and most soldiers they
[58:06] they have a they've gone through boot
[58:09] camp they've gone through training and
[58:10] they're given a war manual
[58:13] so we have a war manual tonight and the
[58:15] nice thing about ours is it's never
[58:17] changed
[58:19] it's never had to be updated or revised
[58:22] our adversary has never developed
[58:25] anything that caught us off guard or put
[58:27] our general back at the drawing table to
[58:30] come up with something better ours has
[58:32] never changed because it's never been
[58:34] defeated but but but the the the
[58:37] adversaries of the peoples and the
[58:39] armies of the Living God have always had
[58:42] to keep you know revising their War
[58:45] manual because they keep getting
[58:47] defeated
[58:48] from the most unseeming or the most
[58:52] unsuspecting in the most you know uh
[58:55] unsuspected ways
[58:57] so I I just I I call this the Philistine
[59:00] War manual because the Philistines were
[59:03] always enemies
[59:04] the Philistine War manual and so it one
[59:07] one section of it may go like this it's
[59:09] not the armies and the great Weaponry of
[59:14] our opponent Israel that has inflicted
[59:16] the greatest toll on our ranks it's not
[59:20] the spears the swords the battering rams
[59:23] the bows and arrows or the catapults
[59:25] that have inflicted the greatest
[59:27] casualties and defeats we have all those
[59:31] weapons and the ability to defend them
[59:34] also
[59:35] instead it's the little Shepherd boy
[59:38] with a slingshot
[59:43] the boy who wasn't tall enough
[59:46] strong enough or smart enough to go and
[59:49] join his brothers in Saul's Army yet
[59:52] when he finally reached him on the
[59:54] battlefield he displayed more courage
[59:57] than all the others and excelled above
[1:00:01] them all in his victory over the enemy
[1:00:05] amen it's the long-haired Nazarite boys
[1:00:13] those guys tie Foxx's Tails together
[1:00:16] they're not depending on their own
[1:00:18] strength their size their might or any
[1:00:21] of those things they're depending on the
[1:00:23] almighty God
[1:00:25] those guys somehow seem to always come
[1:00:29] from the underdog
[1:00:31] to the overcomer
[1:00:35] watch out for Farmers with Ox goats
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:42] ha
[1:00:43] they don't have army training they don't
[1:00:45] have guns and bows and Spears but they
[1:00:48] catch a realization of who they are and
[1:00:52] what they're standing for and with
[1:00:54] something as simple as an ox code in
[1:00:56] their hand as many as 600 Philistines
[1:01:00] have been killed by men like that
[1:01:08] it's the prophet who refuses to stop
[1:01:11] praying at the King's Command
[1:01:14] and the three captives who refuse to bow
[1:01:18] to the king's image of their prophet who
[1:01:21] have embarrassed us and brought our evil
[1:01:24] schemes to nothing
[1:01:26] be careful because it's not just boys
[1:01:29] and men that decimate us watch out for
[1:01:32] the little girls also
[1:01:34] like Esther who have an identity that is
[1:01:37] hidden until they've reached the throne
[1:01:41] and when they reveal their true Heritage
[1:01:43] those who conspired against them are
[1:01:47] hanged
[1:01:49] watch out for things like Scarlet
[1:01:51] threads hanging from the windows of
[1:01:54] homes
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:02] they thought those walls could never
[1:02:05] crumble
[1:02:06] they thought that was a city that could
[1:02:08] never be overthrown
[1:02:10] but a woman with a Scarlet thread
[1:02:13] hanging from the window amen was the
[1:02:15] only thing remaining
[1:02:18] after Joshua and the armies of Israel
[1:02:21] surrendered that City and the walls came
[1:02:23] down
[1:02:24] Rahab was posing as a harlot you know
[1:02:27] this is how they might have looked at it
[1:02:29] but was actually hiding Israelite spies
[1:02:32] in the roof of her home and something as
[1:02:35] simple as a Scarlet thread hanging from
[1:02:37] her window resulted in her home being
[1:02:40] the only thing left standing when the
[1:02:43] walls and the entire city were being
[1:02:46] destroyed
[1:02:47] watch out for those who value a
[1:02:51] prophet's words
[1:02:53] to be more powerful than the presidents
[1:02:59] she'll have thus saith the Lord
[1:03:02] or shall keep still the only thing that
[1:03:06] will move her is the unction of the Holy
[1:03:09] Spirit
[1:03:11] now I'm reading from a prophet those in
[1:03:13] the bride do only his will
[1:03:17] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:03:21] have thus saith the Lord or they keep
[1:03:24] still
[1:03:25] they know that it has to be God in them
[1:03:28] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:03:31] he did not complete all his work while
[1:03:34] in his Earthly Ministry so now he works
[1:03:38] in and through the bride
[1:03:41] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:03:43] for him to do certain things that he
[1:03:46] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:03:49] through the bride that work which he
[1:03:52] left for this specific time
[1:03:54] amen the Philistine War manual again
[1:03:58] constantly being updated ours has never
[1:04:02] changed amen so I want to go uh just
[1:04:06] into the the a little bit of the
[1:04:07] background of this of the portion of
[1:04:09] scripture we've read tonight because we
[1:04:11] know that David unlike his older
[1:04:13] brothers didn't go in the army didn't
[1:04:15] join Saul's military was was wasn't
[1:04:18] deemed fit to do that but here on this
[1:04:22] day he has been sent by his father Amen
[1:04:25] to go and visit his brothers on the
[1:04:28] Battlefront and to take something to his
[1:04:31] brothers that would help lift their
[1:04:34] spirits
[1:04:35] you know when you've been fighting
[1:04:37] you've been battling and you've been in
[1:04:39] in the in the duty of military or combat
[1:04:42] you're you're a long ways from home you
[1:04:44] you miss your bed your your your family
[1:04:47] your siblings your mama's good cooking
[1:04:49] and all those things so you know even
[1:04:51] though uh militarily speaking you may
[1:04:54] still have a lot of strength a lot of
[1:04:56] courage and all the rights of Weaponry
[1:04:58] still uh your morale is an important
[1:05:02] component
[1:05:04] amen of you maintaining the right
[1:05:07] disposition Amen to enable to fully
[1:05:10] exercise your potentials as a soldier
[1:05:14] amen so here David was sent with a
[1:05:18] provision from the father
[1:05:20] that would give these men of God his
[1:05:24] Brethren the Israelites something to
[1:05:26] boost
[1:05:28] them on the front lines and I know
[1:05:31] brother Stephen has a great ministry of
[1:05:33] teaching but I I see something I see
[1:05:36] something happening in here where where
[1:05:38] where their father uh David's father and
[1:05:41] his brother's father amen realize you
[1:05:43] know what these what these men have
[1:05:45] right now uh it's just is a little bit
[1:05:48] lacking
[1:05:50] they're they're suffering from a
[1:05:53] deficiency
[1:05:54] so he sends David with some bread and
[1:05:57] with some cheese and with some wine even
[1:05:59] with some original Mana you know
[1:06:02] something directly from the father's
[1:06:04] hand
[1:06:05] something directly because you know I'm
[1:06:07] gonna get in trouble brother Stephen I'm
[1:06:10] gonna get in trouble I I know I am I'm
[1:06:11] just going to get in trouble right now
[1:06:13] because you know I I'm you know how it
[1:06:16] is when you're in the military now I
[1:06:18] might dad never fought but he lived
[1:06:21] during the time of the the wrapping up
[1:06:23] of the Vietnam War so he was in the Army
[1:06:26] I think he served four years and and
[1:06:28] that you know I I'm I'm the oldest of
[1:06:30] seven children and so I have four
[1:06:32] younger brothers and and dad you know we
[1:06:35] don't get dressed up we like to be
[1:06:36] little soldiers we don't have camouflage
[1:06:39] and our granny would buy us things and
[1:06:41] and so Dad would go occasionally go to
[1:06:45] the Army Navy store and we get these
[1:06:47] things called MREs do you all know what
[1:06:50] an MRE is
[1:06:51] a meal ready to eat
[1:06:55] have you ever had one
[1:06:59] Brother John
[1:07:01] you deserve a medal
[1:07:03] just for having to eat those things
[1:07:05] if you've ever had one you think how in
[1:07:08] the world have we ever won a war
[1:07:10] if this is all our soldiers ever ate
[1:07:14] because it's dried freeze-dried food you
[1:07:17] know it's food that can last Almost
[1:07:19] indefinitely in almost any conditions
[1:07:22] it's packed in a vacuum tight bag it's
[1:07:25] it's shrink wrapped and and it's there
[1:07:27] and you know it's it's it's not a it's
[1:07:30] it's not a potato it isn't gravy and and
[1:07:33] steak and chicken and fresh vegetables
[1:07:36] amen it's something that's freeze dried
[1:07:39] and you have to open it up and maybe
[1:07:40] pour some water from your canned seed on
[1:07:42] top of it and hope you have a microwave
[1:07:44] or something maybe a magnified glass
[1:07:46] under the sunlight something to warm
[1:07:48] that up you know it's just something to
[1:07:50] get you by
[1:07:53] what was David's father's name
[1:07:57] Jesse thank you Jesse knew these boys
[1:08:01] need a little something in addition to
[1:08:03] the MREs
[1:08:05] you know they've been getting these
[1:08:07] canned meals
[1:08:09] they've been out on the Battlefront you
[1:08:11] know they just been getting something
[1:08:13] that that will get them by and it's
[1:08:15] important and it's made of good
[1:08:17] substance
[1:08:18] amen but I'm gonna give him some fresh
[1:08:20] food
[1:08:21] if it's something that that really David

[1:08:27] to them before it spoils I mean because
[1:08:30] this is living substance

[1:08:35] you need to be in the house of God
[1:08:38] surrounded by a church full of people

[1:08:47] of God amen amen because we're not
[1:08:50] looking just to get along we're looking
[1:08:52] to take a rapture
[1:08:54] and I appreciate those scriptures and I
[1:08:57] appreciate every book and every tape but
[1:09:00] God has appointed a Ministry to take
[1:09:04] those nutrients and mix them together
[1:09:06] and with the water of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:09] and a fresh source and it's something
[1:09:12] hot something warm something that'll
[1:09:15] spoil if you don't partake of it real
[1:09:18] quickly
[1:09:20] [Applause]

[1:10:03] of holies and overnight
[1:10:05] a dead dry almond Rod blew forth with
[1:10:11] original life
[1:10:13] and if you get in that presence you
[1:10:16] won't pay attention to your neighbor and
[1:10:18] somebody coughing or sneezing or
[1:10:21] something like that you'll be in God's
[1:10:23] presence which renders all other Spirits
[1:10:26] all other demon powers
[1:10:29] glory to God
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:32] Hallelujah
[1:10:34] forsaking not the assembling of yourself

[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:10:56] you need something fresh
[1:10:59] from the father's hand hallelujah amen
[1:11:02] and I'm not throwing off I am in no way
[1:11:05] throwing off on tapes books or this
[1:11:08] Bible
[1:11:11] but God has appointed a Ministry of
[1:11:15] vessels that are his agents to be the
[1:11:19] distribution channels
[1:11:21] for his word amen to reach the needs
[1:11:24] amongst the body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] times change conditions change but God
[1:11:34] don't change his format is just as
[1:11:38] powerful and just as effective today
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:41] as it was
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:46] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] I want to tell you something David had
[1:11:49] more than bread
[1:11:50] he had more than Wine he had more than
[1:11:53] all he had more than biddles
[1:11:55] he had a fresh testimony
[1:12:00] he had a real and living God
[1:12:03] he had something that could not be
[1:12:06] extinguished
[1:12:07] by the rebuke of his older brother
[1:12:11] some people can't hardly get up to the
[1:12:14] door of the church for their faith is
[1:12:16] defeated
[1:12:18] somebody looks at him sideways somebody
[1:12:21] makes an offhanded remark or something
[1:12:22] friends don't you realize that's just a
[1:12:25] devil trying to block you from your
[1:12:28] blessing
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:30] just brush that thing aside and come on
[1:12:33] into the house of God and say I'm here
[1:12:35] to worship God
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:40] because David you know I imagine as a
[1:12:43] boy going down here saying man I just
[1:12:46] can't wait
[1:12:47] to see
[1:12:49] a fresh I just just I I'm gonna see a
[1:12:53] book of Acts
[1:12:54] being written as the god of Israel gives
[1:12:58] the armies of Israel more victories so
[1:13:01] in his mind he was thinking oh my I just
[1:13:03] can't wait to get there and see what's
[1:13:05] going on but when he got there he found
[1:13:07] the picture
[1:13:09] the scene was very different
[1:13:11] than what he had imagined
[1:13:13] but I love David I love David as a
[1:13:16] character in the Bible
[1:13:18] because to me he represented even in the
[1:13:21] Old Testament a Spirit-filled believer
[1:13:26] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:13:30] so the the power of God was expressing
[1:13:33] itself through him as both in a
[1:13:36] prophetic capacity
[1:13:38] Amen in a Priestly capacity
[1:13:41] and in a kingly
[1:13:43] office you see with Friends when the
[1:13:46] Holy Spirit is moving through the body
[1:13:48] there's no boundaries
[1:13:50] there's no limitations because it's God
[1:13:53] being God
[1:13:56] through his vessels that he has chosen
[1:13:59] and appointed to be God
[1:14:01] so David without even being conscious of
[1:14:04] it perhaps you know I don't think David
[1:14:07] went down there understanding The
[1:14:09] Dilemma
[1:14:10] David did not have David didn't spend
[1:14:12] five days there analyzing the problem
[1:14:15] and going through the self-help section
[1:14:17] of the Christian library to see what Dr
[1:14:20] Dobson would have to say
[1:14:22] no David had a connection
[1:14:26] to God and as soon as he saw their
[1:14:30] dilemma as soon as he saw the
[1:14:33] predicament he put his finger
[1:14:36] right on the problem
[1:14:38] in five words
[1:14:41] is there not a Cause
[1:14:47] they thought Goliath was their problem
[1:14:50] but Goliath was not their problem
[1:14:52] because God had already defeated men far
[1:14:56] greater than Goliath
[1:14:57] and kings and kingdoms and armies and
[1:15:00] all these militaries had come up against
[1:15:02] Israel and God just squished them
[1:15:05] God just rolled right over top of them
[1:15:07] amen so Goliath wasn't the problem
[1:15:11] the problem was they had lost sight
[1:15:16] Hallelujah they had forgotten who they
[1:15:19] were
[1:15:24] yeah
[1:15:26] yes sir
[1:15:28] the Holy Spirit
[1:15:30] knows amen how to identify the problem
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:35] they forgot who they were
[1:15:37] they forgot whose
[1:15:39] they were
[1:15:42] they forgot what they were fighting for
[1:15:45] they forgot the history of all that God
[1:15:49] had done for the people of Israel to
[1:15:52] even get them to this point
[1:15:56] hello Church
[1:15:59] let me say something tonight there is no
[1:16:01] path back to Egypt
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:07] there is no return to organized religion
[1:16:10] and denominations for the people of the
[1:16:13] Living God
[1:16:15] I know when Israel got out into the
[1:16:17] Wilderness they said we'll appoint us
[1:16:19] captains
[1:16:21] who will take us back to Egypt
[1:16:24] friend that's a death sentence
[1:16:27] because you didn't get as far as you got
[1:16:29] without God's protection
[1:16:32] and God's provision
[1:16:34] and you don't have any blessing for
[1:16:36] going back
[1:16:38] and all those Nations that you've
[1:16:40] already marched through and you detour
[1:16:43] down and burn their cities amen you you
[1:16:46] just pillaged amen have burnt and ruined
[1:16:49] and took and took Treasures all those
[1:16:50] things those people hate you more now
[1:16:54] than they did when you marched in
[1:16:57] and you think you're going to March back
[1:16:59] through there and they're going to patch
[1:17:01] you on the back and say oh hey oh yeah
[1:17:04] oh no
[1:17:06] there's only one way out and that's to
[1:17:09] go forward the same God the same Pillar
[1:17:12] of Fire the same prophetic Ministry is
[1:17:15] going to take us all the way and if any
[1:17:19] man tells you hey follow me if he's not
[1:17:23] following that Prophet you don't follow
[1:17:25] him because he's already dead and what
[1:17:28] he's looking for amen is sympathy misery
[1:17:32] loves company and they don't want to die
[1:17:35] alone
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:39] that spirit amen wants to Rally as many
[1:17:42] people as it can
[1:17:44] to follow it and die
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:50] I'm talking about a spirit
[1:17:54] Hallelujah it is the truth
[1:17:58] is there not
[1:18:00] a Cause
[1:18:03] problem the problem wasn't Goliath
[1:18:05] problem was they had lost their
[1:18:06] realization
[1:18:08] how many sons and daughters of God
[1:18:12] have become sidelined
[1:18:15] due to becoming disillusioned
[1:18:19] caught up in a spiritual fog
[1:18:22] a lost sense of direction or purpose
[1:18:27] that finds them going through the
[1:18:30] motions
[1:18:33] that describes the armies of Israel
[1:18:37] when David found them they got up every
[1:18:40] morning they polished their guns their
[1:18:42] weapons they probably didn't have guns
[1:18:44] back then but you know they got up and
[1:18:46] followed all the regimens
[1:18:48] that they had learned in the boot camp
[1:18:51] shine your armor boys tie your boots
[1:18:54] amen comb your hair the legalism
[1:19:00] do all these things and you'll be
[1:19:03] evicted but they were posers
[1:19:05] they were not real soldiers amen they
[1:19:08] were hired amen they were paid
[1:19:11] Mercenaries
[1:19:14] like some scalawag preachers we got
[1:19:16] nowadays they're not Shepherds they're
[1:19:19] harlings they are paid mercenaries who
[1:19:22] put on the uniform of a Believer but
[1:19:25] inside they're not actually a believer
[1:19:27] they're going to the highest bidder
[1:19:30] yeah
[1:19:31] hello Church they're preaching for
[1:19:34] offering they will cancel a small Church
[1:19:36] to go to a big church they're going to
[1:19:39] give an account for it someday
[1:19:41] but the true Servants of God aren't
[1:19:44] looking at numbers aren't doing it for
[1:19:46] the income amen they are soldiers
[1:19:48] through and through
[1:19:51] they've got a burden for the Lost
[1:19:53] they've got a burden for Souls they will
[1:19:56] give you the shirt off their back they
[1:19:58] will spin themselves into bankruptcy
[1:20:01] to help their brother and their sister
[1:20:06] Hallelujah the real Warrior was the
[1:20:10] shepherd boy
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:13] the real Warrior was the shepherd boy
[1:20:16] amen who was content to stay in his
[1:20:20] place
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:23] the place that his father had given him
[1:20:27] was good enough for him
[1:20:30] he wasn't trying to be anything you know
[1:20:33] what eliab was deserting wasn't David's
[1:20:35] heart it was his own heart
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:39] he was trying to project
[1:20:43] himself
[1:20:45] unto David and say this is your motor
[1:20:48] this is your objective this is why you
[1:20:50] came down here why don't you shut up and
[1:20:52] go home David said I'm not going home
[1:20:55] I'm not going to bow down I'm not gonna
[1:20:58] bend over I'm not gonna back up I'm not
[1:21:01] gonna cower
[1:21:03] and the difference between David and all
[1:21:06] those others is they were comparing
[1:21:08] themselves
[1:21:09] to Goliath
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] and said we are no match
[1:21:15] for this Palestine he's taller he's
[1:21:18] wider he's stronger he's got thicker
[1:21:21] armor he's got a longer spear but David
[1:21:24] never compared himself
[1:21:28] to his problem
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:31] he said it's not even a fair comparison
[1:21:34] between my God
[1:21:37] and Goliath
[1:21:40] that is what distinguished David and
[1:21:44] separated him from all his brothers as
[1:21:47] he did not take a last insults personal
[1:21:51] but he said you're insulting God and I
[1:21:55] won't stand for it if I die I will die
[1:22:00] defending the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:22:03] and the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:22:06] tower and the righteous Hallelujah they
[1:22:09] run into it they are safe
[1:22:14] Hallelujah
[1:22:17] David never lost sight of the cause
[1:22:23] Glory Hallelujah
[1:22:25] David said I'll fight him
[1:22:28] oh they said you gotta you gotta you got
[1:22:30] to go through Congressional approval
[1:22:32] you got to go up to the White House and
[1:22:35] see King Saul
[1:22:37] get his Blessing you know
[1:22:39] David said hey you say whatever you want
[1:22:42] I'm gonna fight him
[1:22:43] that's all said now David
[1:22:45] tell you what I
[1:22:47] I got this armor
[1:22:49] I got this nice
[1:22:51] never been used
[1:22:56] you know I wear this for the parades
[1:23:00] and I wear this for the elections
[1:23:03] and I wear this for the Press events
[1:23:07] it's never been used
[1:23:10] David I'm gonna dress you up
[1:23:17] I'm gonna put my diluted testimony on
[1:23:19] you
[1:23:21] that way if you should win the battle
[1:23:25] I'll get some credit
[1:23:31] but remember David had the discerner
[1:23:35] dead on the inside
[1:23:38] see the problem amen is still being
[1:23:41] discerned and Saul was very much a part
[1:23:45] of the problem
[1:23:46] because Saul's kingship had caused a
[1:23:50] disillusionment like a fog Amen to be
[1:23:54] cast over every one of his followers
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:24:00] and they were wandering along just
[1:24:02] following the command of a leader amen
[1:24:05] who himself was so backslid he wouldn't
[1:24:09] face that giant and he just he just
[1:24:12] commissioned a bunch of others to go do
[1:24:14] his Dirty Work
[1:24:18] absolutely right
[1:24:20] David said not me
[1:24:22] I'm not your agent
[1:24:27] I'm not your Aaron boy
[1:24:31] my loyalties and my allegiance go to one
[1:24:35] foreign
[1:24:40] I don't need your armor
[1:24:42] same God
[1:24:44] that delivered me out of the hand of the
[1:24:46] bear and out of the hand of the light
[1:24:48] will deliver this
[1:24:50] uncircumcised philistine
[1:24:53] right into my hand
[1:24:57] this was uh like a form of spiritual
[1:25:01] amnesia
[1:25:03] that had polluted
[1:25:05] the armies of the Living God
[1:25:08] they were still God's men they were
[1:25:10] still God's chosen amen God was just as
[1:25:12] he was he was he desired and he was just
[1:25:16] as bound
[1:25:17] to defeat their enemies as he had ever
[1:25:19] been but when they lost that realization
[1:25:23] they were neutralized
[1:25:28] friend Satan cannot change your identity
[1:25:32] but if he can weaken your understanding
[1:25:34] of who you are
[1:25:36] he will sideline you
[1:25:39] where you just come to church and you go
[1:25:41] through the motions
[1:25:44] see and then your objectives change
[1:25:48] now it's about pleasing the parents
[1:25:51] please in the pastor
[1:25:53] oh you know but Tim I'm just doing my
[1:25:55] duty I've checked off my Christian
[1:25:57] duties this week oh no no no no no
[1:26:00] that's a stench in God's nostrils
[1:26:04] your motivations have to be born
[1:26:08] out of an actual realization
[1:26:10] of Who You Are
[1:26:13] spiritual I'm going to call this brother
[1:26:15] Stephen you you you're a medicine you're
[1:26:17] a man of of medical drink spiritual
[1:26:21] vertigo
[1:26:24] you know what vertigo is
[1:26:27] somebody comes in they don't know which
[1:26:28] way is up
[1:26:30] they don't know which way is down
[1:26:32] amen they're just on a collision course
[1:26:36] when it seems like God himself
[1:26:39] cannot wrestle the control to place them
[1:26:42] back on course
[1:26:44] now the um the illustration I use for
[1:26:47] this is this okay
[1:26:49] I um I'm not a pilot but I have taken
[1:26:52] maybe eight or so hours of of time in
[1:26:55] the cockpit as a student pilot
[1:26:59] and I've had Ground School different
[1:27:01] things like that
[1:27:02] um
[1:27:03] and they they talk about this is one of
[1:27:05] the most deadly conditions
[1:27:08] that can occur with a pilot
[1:27:10] is vertigo
[1:27:13] and this often happens out there there
[1:27:15] are a couple of different conditions
[1:27:16] that you can fly in one is called VFR
[1:27:19] which is visual flight rules
[1:27:23] it means that it's between the hours of
[1:27:25] Sun up and sunset
[1:27:28] so there's plenty of daylight and
[1:27:30] there's plenty of visibility usually I
[1:27:32] think it's about five miles
[1:27:35] there's five miles of clear visibility
[1:27:37] so you can fly on What's called the
[1:27:39] visual flight rules
[1:27:41] and even some planes are only VFR rated
[1:27:45] they they don't have the instrumentation
[1:27:47] like the navigation and the uh the
[1:27:50] altimeter the uh and the uh transponders
[1:27:53] and things to to do instrument rated
[1:27:56] flying which is the next level IFR
[1:28:00] is instrument flight rules
[1:28:03] and it doesn't matter how dark it is
[1:28:07] doesn't matter how foggy it is
[1:28:09] does it matter if it's raining or
[1:28:11] sleeting or snow or ice none of those
[1:28:14] things matter
[1:28:15] because the pilot has the training and
[1:28:18] the airplane is equipped for those
[1:28:20] conditions
[1:28:22] and so they're not relying on their eyes
[1:28:24] and their ears and how things feel
[1:28:27] they're trained to rely on those
[1:28:29] instruments
[1:28:31] amen which are tuned in to other things
[1:28:33] like radar towers and and signals homing
[1:28:36] signals and all these things and those
[1:28:37] things give them amen the necessary
[1:28:40] guidance
[1:28:42] to take them from their origin to their
[1:28:45] destination safely amen with no without
[1:28:48] striking any other aircraft
[1:28:51] so they're trade and then the other is
[1:28:52] is called instrument meteorological
[1:28:54] conditions and that's when it otherwise
[1:28:57] would be visual flight rules but
[1:28:59] something like fog or a
[1:29:02] I don't say a low cloud ceiling uh rain
[1:29:06] different things mean they just can't
[1:29:08] see well enough to fly visual flight
[1:29:10] rules and they call it instrument
[1:29:12] meteorological
[1:29:13] so again I'm not trying to give flight
[1:29:15] lessons tonight
[1:29:18] but I want the natural to type the
[1:29:20] spiritual
[1:29:21] because vertigo we We There was a man by
[1:29:25] the name of John
[1:29:26] Kennedy who in 1999
[1:29:30] flew a perfectly good aircraft
[1:29:34] right into the Atlantic Ocean
[1:29:37] because he developed vertigo
[1:29:41] when you when you when you get when
[1:29:43] vertigo happens you don't you lose your
[1:29:46] sense of direction
[1:29:47] completely
[1:29:49] and it feels like you're falling so you
[1:29:53] pull the stick back
[1:29:55] which can often make the plane go into a
[1:29:58] stall
[1:30:00] or it'll feel like you're you're lifting
[1:30:02] too quickly so you'll push the stick
[1:30:04] forward and nose dive it right into the
[1:30:07] ground or right into the ocean
[1:30:10] amen so they they tell you four things
[1:30:13] and I'm I'm giving you these four things

[1:30:51] your feelings will lie to you
[1:30:55] your natural senses
[1:30:58] will lie to you
[1:31:00] so that brings me to rule number two
[1:31:04] trust the instruments
[1:31:07] they don't lie
[1:31:15] thank you your feelings will lie
[1:31:20] but God's word will never lie

[1:36:51] no might
[1:36:52] oh

[1:36:59] when you have expended all of your
[1:37:01] resources

[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:09] you know if you got an airplane you got
[1:41:12] more than one instrument
[1:41:14] you got an altitude indicator you got a
[1:41:17] speed indicator you got a rate of
[1:41:19] descent and the rate of accent indicator
[1:41:21] you got a compass you got a magnetic
[1:41:24] heading you got all these instruments
[1:41:27] that all say the same thing
[1:41:30] when you know how to light them all up
[1:41:35] [Applause]

[1:42:16] his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:42:19] Buckler
[1:42:21] I'm just reading what one instrument
[1:42:22] says
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:31] I got to come back to that one
[1:42:34] I'm not done reading second chronicles
[1:42:36] 20.
[1:42:40] I'm telling you
[1:42:42] remember who you are
[1:42:45] remember how you got here
[1:42:48] because it's how you're getting home
[1:42:53] and the Levites and the children of the
[1:42:55] coethites and of the children of the
[1:42:56] core Heights stood up to praise the Lord
[1:42:58] God of Israel with a loud voice on high
[1:43:00] and they Rose early in the morning and
[1:43:02] went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa
[1:43:04] and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood
[1:43:06] and said
[1:43:07] Hear Me O Israel and ye inhabitants of
[1:43:09] Jerusalem
[1:43:10] believe
[1:43:12] in the Lord your God
[1:43:15] so shall you be established
[1:43:17] believe His prophets
[1:43:20] so shall ye prosper
[1:43:28] one of the other things they tell you
[1:43:30] in your flight training
[1:43:33] is let go
[1:43:38] let go of the controls
[1:43:41] that you think you control
[1:43:44] just let go
[1:43:47] most airplanes
[1:43:49] especially the ones you're learning in
[1:43:51] like Cessnas and Cirrus and some of the
[1:43:54] they are built they are designed to be
[1:43:57] very stable airplanes now I'm not
[1:44:00] talking about fighter jets and stunt
[1:44:02] planes
[1:44:04] I'm talking about the the planes you see
[1:44:06] most often flying around in the sky
[1:44:09] because they last the longest
[1:44:12] they're very stable
[1:44:14] and even if you put the plane into a
[1:44:18] maneuver
[1:44:19] a maneuver that it is not really
[1:44:21] designed for
[1:44:23] like a spin
[1:44:25] or a stall
[1:44:27] if you will simply take your hands
[1:44:30] and feet off the controls
[1:44:33] and reduce the power back to idle the
[1:44:37] plane will write itself
[1:44:41] what am I telling you
[1:44:44] don't go on your feelings
[1:44:46] [Applause]
[1:44:48] read what the instruments say they don't
[1:44:51] lie and Trust the aircraft
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:56] [Applause]
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:02] trust the captain
[1:45:04] trust the prophet that God Vindicated
[1:45:07] quit trying to figure it all out you're
[1:45:10] the one putting the plane on a crash
[1:45:13] course
[1:45:15] by going by your feelings and trying to
[1:45:18] fly a plane that will actually fly
[1:45:20] itself if you just let go
[1:45:25] let go and let God have his way
[1:45:29] [Applause]
[1:45:33] number four
[1:45:36] call out for help
[1:45:41] you got a radio
[1:45:44] there's a control tower
[1:45:46] and if you place a call out for help
[1:45:50] the operators in the tower can identify
[1:45:54] Where You Are
[1:45:59] yes
[1:46:00] you may have flown off course you may be
[1:46:03] low on fuel you may be completely lost
[1:46:06] but if you could ever get the control
[1:46:08] tower up on the radio
[1:46:11] help help
[1:46:14] mayday mayday
[1:46:17] when the Tower answers back
[1:46:19] I have you
[1:46:22] Hallelujah
[1:46:24] they'll tell you you got some on that
[1:46:26] plane called a transponder they say turn
[1:46:29] the transponder to a certain four-digit
[1:46:33] reading and when they pick up that
[1:46:35] signal from the transponder they say we
[1:46:37] have you
[1:46:39] we have you on our radar
[1:46:41] we know exactly where you are we know
[1:46:43] exactly where you started we know
[1:46:46] exactly what your destination is we know
[1:46:48] what your altitude is we know the course
[1:46:51] you're on
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:53] oh
[1:46:55] my God hallelujah
[1:46:59] now I'm back in the flight manual Thou
[1:47:02] shalt not be afraid for the terror by
[1:47:06] night
[1:47:07] nor for the arrow that flies by day nor
[1:47:11] for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:47:13] darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:47:16] wasted that Noonday
[1:47:18] we say it tonight A thousand shall
[1:47:21] follow thy right and ten thousand at thy
[1:47:25] right side
[1:47:26] but it shall not
[1:47:30] come nigh unto thee
[1:47:34] [Applause]
[1:47:38] Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold
[1:47:40] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:47:43] because thou has made the Lord
[1:47:47] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:47:51] thy habitation
[1:47:53] there shall no evil befall thee
[1:47:57] and neither shall any plague
[1:47:59] come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give
[1:48:02] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:48:05] in all thy ways
[1:48:06] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[1:48:09] lest thou Dash thy foot against the
[1:48:12] stone
[1:48:13] Thou shalt tread upon the young lie upon
[1:48:16] the lion and Adder the young light and
[1:48:18] the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
[1:48:21] I love this
[1:48:24] because he had set
[1:48:26] his love
[1:48:28] upon me
[1:48:30] I will set him on high
[1:48:33] because he hath known my name
[1:48:36] he shall call upon me and I will answer
[1:48:38] him I will be with him
[1:48:41] in trouble
[1:48:44] I will deliver him and honor him how
[1:48:47] with long life will I satisfy him and
[1:48:50] show him
[1:48:53] I will show him
[1:48:56] that's to make manifestly evident
[1:49:00] Beyond any shadow of a doubt
[1:49:04] irrefutably
[1:49:06] undisputedly I will make him I will show
[1:49:11] him
[1:49:13] my salvation
[1:49:16] Hallelujah
[1:49:18] can I can I just refer to another
[1:49:20] instrument
[1:49:26] I
[1:49:27] I will bless the Lord
[1:49:29] at all times
[1:49:32] his praise shall continually
[1:49:35] be in my mouth remember Paul and Silas
[1:49:38] in prison that night his praise shall
[1:49:40] continually be they got God's attention
[1:49:43] so much so he started ignoring the
[1:49:46] angels
[1:49:47] and tapped his foot and you know what
[1:49:49] happened
[1:49:51] the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[1:49:55] righteous
[1:49:57] friend this is better than radar
[1:50:02] you don't have to dial in a transponder
[1:50:05] the eyes of the Lord
[1:50:07] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[1:50:13] open
[1:50:14] to their cry
[1:50:16] the face of the Lord is against them
[1:50:18] that do evil to cut off the remembrance
[1:50:21] of them from the earth the righteous cry
[1:50:24] and the Lord heareth
[1:50:26] and delivereth him out of all
[1:50:32] all
[1:50:34] their troubles
[1:50:36] the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[1:50:39] broken heart and save it such as be of a
[1:50:41] contrite spirit
[1:50:43] many are the afflictions
[1:50:46] of the righteous
[1:50:48] oh brother
[1:50:52] I like this one
[1:50:54] I like this one because the devil loves
[1:50:56] to work on people
[1:50:57] if you were God's son and if you were
[1:51:01] God's daughter
[1:51:03] why are so many things
[1:51:06] going wrong
[1:51:08] in your life
[1:51:11] you love the Lord you serve the Lord you
[1:51:15] abstain
[1:51:16] from things that others appear to be
[1:51:18] getting by with
[1:51:21] you're faithful you're devout
[1:51:24] amen you're consecrated you sacrifice
[1:51:26] for the Lord and yet all these bad
[1:51:28] things just keep happening unto you when
[1:51:31] other people who seem to be hypocrites
[1:51:37] just sail right through
[1:51:40] seemingly with no consequence nothing
[1:51:43] ever go many
[1:51:46] are the afflictions
[1:51:48] of the righteous but
[1:51:51] the Lord
[1:51:53] delivereth him out of them all
[1:51:58] that is the difference however many
[1:52:01] things the devil throws in my way God
[1:52:04] has promised me I will overcome a Double
[1:52:08] L all of those things
[1:52:11] sickness sadness depression and loss of
[1:52:15] job loss of family loss of friends
[1:52:17] whatever it is hallelujah I could be
[1:52:21] blind dumb deaf and mute
[1:52:24] and all but dead but I'm gonna rise
[1:52:28] again
[1:52:29] Hallelujah
[1:52:31] because I served a god of the living and
[1:52:34] of the Dead He's a resurrected savior
[1:52:38] and he's in full control
[1:52:43] Hallelujah
[1:52:47] I'm gonna read that one more time many
[1:52:49] are the afflictions of the righteous but
[1:52:51] the Lord delivereth him
[1:52:53] out of them all
[1:52:55] he keepeth all his bones
[1:52:58] not one of them is broken
[1:53:00] all don't let the devil tell you that
[1:53:03] just applies to Jesus
[1:53:06] that's that's a family
[1:53:08] that's a family benefit
[1:53:10] that extends to all
[1:53:13] evil shall slay the wicked and they that
[1:53:16] hate the righteous shall be destined the
[1:53:19] Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants
[1:53:21] and none of them that trust in him
[1:53:24] shall be desolate
[1:53:26] call the control tower
[1:53:29] call upon the name of the Lord
[1:53:33] he could identify you
[1:53:36] you know they've I I will I am wrapping
[1:53:40] up
[1:53:41] I'm I'm working my way toward a close
[1:53:44] but one of the things I was thinking
[1:53:46] about this evening is they have
[1:53:48] something on these planes called an elt
[1:53:51] it's an emergency locator
[1:53:54] transmitter
[1:53:57] that if that plane experiences any
[1:54:00] Sudden Impact
[1:54:03] or a change of Direction
[1:54:05] it immediately triggers the signal
[1:54:09] from the elt
[1:54:11] and it sends out
[1:54:12] a homing Beacon
[1:54:15] that's what is the three Hebrew children
[1:54:19] that's what happened
[1:54:22] when they threw him in the fire furnace
[1:54:25] they were they were impacted by
[1:54:28] something that should have killed them
[1:54:31] but it alerted a higher authority
[1:54:35] and got his attention
[1:54:37] and he told Gabriel and wormwood and All
[1:54:40] His chiefest angels
[1:54:42] I'm going
[1:54:45] those boys didn't stand for y'all they
[1:54:47] stood for me
[1:54:48] and now I'm gonna go down there
[1:54:52] and he joined his presence
[1:54:56] to those boys which made them Invincible
[1:55:00] against the king's devices
[1:55:03] Hallelujah
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:06] amen
[1:55:08] even if you're off course
[1:55:10] even if you're off course the tower can
[1:55:13] say Here's Where You Are
[1:55:15] that's what this message did for us
[1:55:18] it showed us where we came from where
[1:55:21] we're going and if we're off course how
[1:55:24] to correct
[1:55:25] they'll often give them they'll say here
[1:55:27] fly this heading fly that heading amen
[1:55:31] so the prophet said take off those
[1:55:33] high-heeled shoes
[1:55:35] fly that heading
[1:55:37] boys take off those shorts take off
[1:55:39] those Fashions amen take off those
[1:55:41] worldly that fly a new heading if you
[1:55:44] want to end up safe in the harbor
[1:55:46] fly The Heading of the word of God
[1:55:51] amen amen
[1:55:53] they can actually guide a person
[1:55:56] with no piloting experience
[1:55:58] to a safe landing they've done it
[1:56:01] if you go on YouTube and I don't promote
[1:56:04] YouTube but you can go and hear
[1:56:07] exchanges
[1:56:09] you know there was a man who was flying
[1:56:10] a plane he had a heart attack and he
[1:56:12] died
[1:56:12] midair pilate died killed over dead
[1:56:16] and his wife got a hold of the control
[1:56:18] tower
[1:56:19] she wasn't really a pilot but she got a
[1:56:22] hold of the control tower and they said
[1:56:24] oh
[1:56:25] we got you
[1:56:28] and they guided her to a safe landing
[1:56:32] because somebody in the tower
[1:56:34] knows more than you
[1:56:37] and if you can trust
[1:56:39] trust those instructions
[1:56:41] you could arrive safely
[1:56:43] at the other side
[1:56:45] Hallelujah
[1:56:47] Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:52] oh my
[1:56:54] God Amen
[1:56:57] musicians come so they won't think I'm
[1:57:00] lying
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:05] Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[1:57:07] God for Israel is that they might be
[1:57:09] saved for I bear them record that they
[1:57:11] have a Zeal of God but not according to
[1:57:13] knowledge for they being ignorant of
[1:57:15] God's righteousness of God's
[1:57:17] righteousness and going about to
[1:57:19] establish their own righteousness
[1:57:22] have not submitted themselves unto the
[1:57:24] righteousness of God
[1:57:26] for Christ is the end of the law for
[1:57:27] righteousness to everyone that believeth
[1:57:30] for Moses Moses describeth the
[1:57:33] righteousness which is of the law those
[1:57:34] that the man which doeth those things
[1:57:36] shall live by them but the righteousness
[1:57:39] which is of faith
[1:57:41] speaketh on this way say not in thine
[1:57:44] heart who shall Ascend into heaven that
[1:57:47] is to bring Christ down from above or
[1:57:49] who shall descend into the deep that is
[1:57:51] to bring Christ again from the dead but
[1:57:53] what saith did the word is nigh thee
[1:57:58] even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:58:03] that is the word of faith
[1:58:07] which we preach
[1:58:10] back to a prophet's message
[1:58:14] that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[1:58:16] mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe
[1:58:18] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[1:58:21] from the dead Thou shalt be saved for
[1:58:23] with the heart men believeth unto
[1:58:25] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:58:26] confession is made unto salvation for
[1:58:29] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[1:58:31] on him shall not be ashamed for there's
[1:58:34] no difference between the Jew and the
[1:58:35] Greeks see the gospel tears down
[1:58:38] sectarian barriers
[1:58:41] National barriers racial barriers
[1:58:44] cultural barriers the gospel tears that
[1:58:47] down
[1:58:49] for the same Lord over all is Rich into
[1:58:51] all that call upon him for whosoever
[1:58:54] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:58:55] shall be saved how then shall they call
[1:58:58] on him in whom they have not believed
[1:58:59] and how so they believe in him of whom
[1:59:02] they have not heard and how shall they
[1:59:04] hear
[1:59:06] without a preacher
[1:59:08] how shall they preach except they be
[1:59:12] sent
[1:59:14] you know what if you've got an issue
[1:59:15] with me preaching talk to my boss
[1:59:19] I didn't call I didn't call myself I
[1:59:22] didn't wake up one morning said God I
[1:59:25] want to be a preacher
[1:59:27] I want to suffer reproach and spend time
[1:59:30] away from my family and take time away
[1:59:32] from all these other worldly Pursuits
[1:59:34] and I didn't I didn't I I was sent
[1:59:39] I was Commissioned I was called of God
[1:59:43] and I answer to him
[1:59:46] not to a deacon board or a trustee board
[1:59:49] or a committee or or headquarters I've
[1:59:53] got one that I answer to my Lord and
[1:59:55] Savior Jesus Christ
[1:59:57] how shall they preach except they be
[2:00:00] sick
[2:00:02] as it is written how beautiful are the
[2:00:04] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[2:00:06] peace and bring Good Tidings of good
[2:00:08] glad tidings are good things
[2:00:10] but they have not all obeyed
[2:00:13] the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who
[2:00:17] hath believed
[2:00:19] our report
[2:00:21] but I say have they not heard yes verily
[2:00:25] their sound went into all the Earth and
[2:00:27] their words into the ends of the world
[2:00:29] but I say did not Israel know first
[2:00:32] Moses saith I will provoke you to
[2:00:34] jealousy by them that are no people
[2:00:37] and by a foolish Nation
[2:00:40] I will anger you
[2:00:42] but Isaias is very bored and said I was
[2:00:45] found of them that sought me not
[2:00:48] I Was Made manifest unto them that ask
[2:00:52] not after me but to Israel he saith all
[2:00:55] day long I have stretched forth my hands
[2:00:57] unto a disobedient and gainsang people
[2:01:00] see Paul's showing them amen he's really
[2:01:03] shown them the transition of the Gospel
[2:01:05] from the Jewish race to the Gentiles
[2:01:09] because Grace came to us now I heard I
[2:01:12] heard a lot said about Grace tonight and
[2:01:14] I think I've got just a little more but
[2:01:17] I'm going to just forego that and just
[2:01:18] say this a trophy
[2:01:21] of God's grace
[2:01:24] how many's ever seen a trophy you're
[2:01:26] like a hunter or a Fisher you know they
[2:01:29] they catch a big fish and they say
[2:01:30] that's a trophy they pay a lot of money
[2:01:32] they get it stuffed to look like it's
[2:01:33] alive again and they put it up on the
[2:01:35] wall and they say that's a trophy but
[2:01:37] you know something brother brother
[2:01:39] Robert the the other thing the other

[2:01:52] that they shot it with
[2:01:55] and brother Brown said your trophies

[2:02:19] that one

[2:02:23] it wasn't his works it was in his
[2:02:26] righteousness it wasn't his goodness
[2:02:28] it's not who his daddy was or who his
[2:02:31] mama was that is a trophy
[2:02:36] of my grace
