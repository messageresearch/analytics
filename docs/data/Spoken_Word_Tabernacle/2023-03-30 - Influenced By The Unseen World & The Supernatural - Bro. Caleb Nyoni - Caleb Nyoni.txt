you unto myself that where I am you may be also and whether I go you know the way then Thomas said unto him Lord we know not wither thou goest how know we the way then Jesus said unto him I am the way I am the truth and I am the life no man coming to the father but by me may God bless the reading of the word you may sit down as I remain standing how many love the word of God Heaven and Earth may pass away but the word of the Lord will never pass away I would rather stand on the word than stand in heaven can I repeat that again I would rather stand on the word than stand in heaven why because heaven and earth may pass away but the word of God will live forever and ever and ever amen amen amen amen amen amen you must let the devil Know Who You Are you must let the devil know where you are standing some of the afflictions some of the diseases some of the problems they just they don't need you to lay hands on you they just need a real healthy Hallelujah Hallelujah and you receive your healing Hallelujah and you receive your rapturing faith So when you say hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you are beating the foundations of hell remember the words of Jericho there was no hammer there was no Dynamite they were saying hallelujah praise God hallelujah and the world started crumbling down Hallelujah my brother this church I can preach from 1947 to 1965 and this church you say Amen to the word what has brought us together is the message what will keep us together is the message what to separate us is the message so if you want to make me happy give me the message who am I I'm a Son of God this church is not a Pentecostal church this is not a church of chickens don't say clack clack clack but these are spiritual Eagles where the carcasses they're the Eagles be gathered around you are not feeding on the son of man but you are feeding on the body word of being son of man you are feeding on Christ himself so if you are sick tonight you shall be healed if you are hungry tonight you shall be filled I'm sick and tired of believers who sick after signs brother we are in a Seasons where things follow us we are no longer seeking after science sickness does not follow me financial difficulties does not follow me marriage problems does not follow me what follows me is signs wonders and miracles brother when I walk I feel my jacket being pulled and I said what is it he says I am science and I'm wonders I follow those that believe your problem is that you are a believer in my name they shall cast out demons Hallelujah so tonight I say Charlotte evil spirit leave this place in the name of Jesus I say cancer leave this place in the name of Jesus you spirit of suicide leave this place I believe that somebody today will be healed I believe that somebody who received the Holy Ghost baptism give God a shout out praise [Applause] when the angel came to John when the angel came to join he says Joan come up higher the sister who sang a song she was inspired he says come up higher and John says immediately I was in the spirit brother when you come in the fellowship come up higher immediately receive your healing when you come in the fellowship come up higher immediately receive your body chain Hallelujah [Applause] bro when you come like this we come under the influence of the pillar of Fire I believe there is a man who can turn on the light oh the eyes of Heavens are here watching these audience this is the message of the hour this is the voice of God in these last days brother Branham is the last voice to this generation so when we come like this without any doubt without any feelings without any hatred among us then something is about to happen no devil can stand that presence Hallelujah no kids I can stand that presence no sin no weakness can stand on the way when sister brother Prana wants their sister happy rights house he was sharing the testimony and sister hit right just say brother brother that's nothing by the truth and God says immediately ask what you will brother god like people who respond to this word [Applause] give God a shout out praise [Applause] it's gonna be good here tonight I can feel it already amen I want to thank God for safe traveling Mercies I arrived this morning at this afternoon rather I left at 3am in Texas and I bought it at 5am I only slept for two hours for the past one week I think I've slept for less than 10 hours very busy man but we thank God for the grace that I made it and tomorrow I leave in the morning and I want to bring greetings from my beautiful wife she said I should greet you she just celebrated her birthday some two days ago and we thank God for the gift of life and I also want to bring greetings from my dad and the pastor zunu my coming and uh brother Greg is been such a phenomenal brother to me we met in 2019 in in here in North Carolina and uh we just bonded it's been more than a blessing and he's the one who made it possible and connected me to the man of God he sent me a link some time back I think around 2020 or so and we've been following uh spoken word and I tell you that uh I know I'm not supposed to say this but a whole lot of people in Africa Zambia South Africa and many other countries are watching this church so I want to tell you that you are so blessed to be receiving Direct some are just getting online but you are getting direct so you have to pull the gift from the man of God [Applause] Pastor Steven is an epitome of knowledge if we were in the University would have been one of the PHD doctor lecturers God is really raised a man of God in this generation and I'm so happy with this love he's always communicating you know and uh we can go and on and on but this is a man full of love and brother Branham says the greatest success he had in his ministry was because of divine love knowledge is good but it is not in the same category with love a lot of people seek knowledge from 1200 from from the Bible but the Bible says uh knowledge puff it up but love edifies and today we have so much knowledge in 1200 tips but it was love that sent the message 1200 tips reviews the one who is divine love it didn't just give us knowledge to know about him but to know him to know him is life not to know about him to know about him is someone giving you knowledge about somebody else but to know him Hallelujah that means you have to have a personal relationship with God so I pray tonight that more of his love will be shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit because the seven the sea opened another world to us the seven is still secrets of redemption we see the first six seals is men suffering we see the Festival the White Horse of religious deception that deceived the first church deceived the first Eve and the second Eve the red horse of war and War and bloodshed the black horse of Eco economics feminine death that fourth seal of pestilence that fifth seal which shows the Holocaust that six still points to the vows on Earth points to the tribulation and the battle of Armageddon but the seven the seal shows us how to get back from where we fell from Hallelujah that seven still has been it unveils the Mighty God that seven still reveals Christ in every scripture brother Branham says if you read your Bible and you don't find Jesus Christ go back and read again because it was the entire theme of the whole Bible he says Lord it is written of me I come in the volume of the book and it's from Genesis 1 to Revelations 22. it has been unveiled before us we see him we know him we know who he is we know what he is today we know who we who he was and we know what is to come oh that seal that opened to us it takes away the Amnesia it makes us see the mystery of our names in The Book of Life because to know your position is connected with perfect faith your position is connected to your power Revelations 10 8-11 that seventh seal book that came from Heaven John was taught to eat the book there was a time he was in the message but when you eat the book the message is in you he says in that day you will know that I in you and you in me that's why Paul says we have this treasure in our Earthly vessels Jeremiah says with the title deed in our 18 vessels in that type of dude of redemption has come down and this is the secret the word is in the bride as Christ was in Mary Mary was walking around knowing the mystery of Christ was formed inside of her she knew the prophet's prophecy was being formed or interpreted in her life when that Mighty Angel descended descended and showed her she was the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 14. he says the Virgin shall bring forth a son and you shall call him Emmanuel so she understood that this was happening in her life so we see haggar was carrying Ishmael but ishma was a fighter ishma was connected to Abraham but he was a mocker he was a persecutor his hand was continual against his brethren but Sarai received a new name there were three women in that time next slide brother there was haga there was Lot's wife and they were Sarah haggar and Lord's wife didn't receive no new name but Sarah received a new name because Sarah was bringing forth the mystery of Christ The Mystery of Isaac in Genesis 17 verse 15. next Slide the Bible says and God said unto Abraham as for thy wife Sarai thou shall not call her Sarah there it is it says and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai that wife shall be a name so God put an edge in Sarah and an edge in Abraham H in Hebrew represent God we are being influenced that's my message tonight being influenced by the Unseen World in the Supernatural sensitizing you because we are not walking by side the one walks by sight moves in the temporal but he walks by faith looks to the eternal because to walk by faith it takes a new bed first and these little ones who bypass their angels that caused the son of man to come down God being manifested in the flesh to make a way to hunt out those who went astray and bring us back and connect us to our angel that is our message tonight it's because it's connected to our full Redemption so I invite you to to open our Bibles to Exodus chapter 23 verse 20. the word Exodus means going out Exodus is a book of redemption so God is speaking to the end to the Exodus prophet verse 20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared understand this real good these people they were born in Egypt and they were born into bondage and they were born into slavery and Pharaoh a type of Satan held them in his kingdom and they couldn't come out they were slaves there but God promised the Deliverance and he's sending Moses and Moses is a type of Christ who is coming to deliver them out of bondage where they were burning to bring them into a place that God had promised them they should have been born in that place but Pharaoh dealt subtle with them after the death of Joseph he made them slaves and these people in bondage is receiving up an exodus Prophet with the message and is said to deliver them out of the evil system and bring them into a place prepared for them and this same Pillar of Fire is sent to guide them from where they were born in bondage into a place prepared for them behold I send an angel before them before they to keep thee in the way to bring thee in the place which I have prepared 21 Bill beware of him and his beware of him and his and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in there but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy to your enemies in an anniversary unto thine adversaries enemy is not the one who afflict the body but an enemy is the one who oppressed the mind enemy is the one who bring false religion into their soul but I will be an enemy to your enemies he says for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites unto the Hittites unto the parasites and unto the Canaanites and unto the he writes and unto the jebusites and I will cut them off may God bless the reading of the word 10 with me to John 14. in the book of Exodus in the time of Moses that was the first Exodus God was bringing the people from a natural land to a natural land from Egypt and to Canaan but in the second Exodus which was the great Exodus because Christ was a greater Moses who was taking them from a spiritual condition of Judaism taking us from that flesh birth to bring us into the Holy Ghost to bring us into the new birth this was a spiritual Exodus and today we are living in the Third Exodus so in John 14 Jesus had come to this juncture of his ministry and he's about to go to the cross so the healing Revival was over and the first pull contacted the flesh demonology in the Physical Realm and the second pool designing the secrets of the heart going into the spirit man demonology in the spirit Realm uncovering things inside of them like you talk to the woman and says you have five husbands like you'd expose the thoughts of the Pharisees when they call when they were calling to discernment mental telepathy then in that said pool the opening of the word caught the very elect but now he's about to be rejected and go to the cross and he's telling these disciples to say let no let not your heart be troubled believe in also in me he says in my father's house are many mansions brother I feel like preaching already if it were not so I would have told you I got to prepare a place for you and if I got to prepare a place I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also then Thomas said unto him Lord we know that we're not not without ghost how do we know the way then Jesus said unto him let's say together I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man coming to the father but by me Clap Your Hands for Jesus so without the way there is no going without the truth there is no knowing without the life there is no living the way is seven steps to God the truth is seven voices the life is Seven Virtues the whole Plan of Redemption laid in the son of man Hallelujah he was the Super sign he was the head of a new creation he came by the Virgin birth the serpent seed brought before and every one of us died in Adam when he died Moses couldn't redeem us Elijah couldn't redeem us Jeremiah couldn't redeem us Isaiah couldn't redeem us John the greatest man born of a woman couldn't redeem us so the serpent seed made a way for the Virgin birth but the Virgin birth made their way for the Incarnation of God the Creator by creation created a body and came and stabbed into that body for Redemption to redeem his Fallen creation so he is the way he is the truth and is the life no man coming to the father but by me so each one of us who is elected is an angel beholding your father's face in heaven he says I got to prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions brother sister theologians they couldn't decode that they thought it's the seven bedroomed house with an ensuite one brother Panama went to the sixth Dimension he said Heaven Is Not What Mama thought it was these are bodies though this edit Tabernacle peaches off we have another building another Mansion waiting for you [Applause] but to get to that body we accept here by the old bed in a fallen condition and the law of corruption is in this body and this Fallen body is bound in time by the law of gravitation because this body that we have trapped because it's part of this Earth the Bible says Dash Thou shalt dust Thou Art and thou shall return and we are held in a dimension called time and we are growing old and trying to come out of this dimension couldn't take us out motor car couldn't take us out airplane couldn't take us out Luther Wesley and Pentecostal message couldn't take us out what's in back he couldn't take us out but in this astronaut age in this equal age seven Thunders uttered their voices Hallelujah to reveal to us the way to come from flesh to word like Enoch walked the pyramid was the second Bible the first Bible was the zodiac the second Bible was the pyramid and the third Bible is the Britain Bible that we have and brother pranam says we are living in the 22nd chapter of the Book of Revelations we are living in the edge of the caption of the pyramid we have three Bibles but one author and the Bible is a Plan of Redemption [Music] in the first Bible it starts with Virgo the Virgin shall bring forth a man child and he was the Lamb of God Aries the lamb that had to die unfolding all these Mysteries to Leo the Lion when he comes into his kingdom and brother pranam says we are living in the end time of three Bibles in Enoch's Bible there is a way to come from faith into the king's chamber and in the king's chamber there is an empty coffer showing death is conquered six times in the Book of Genesis it tells you in chapter 5 and Adam died and Mahalia died and Seth died and Kenneth died and lamict died but when it comes to Enoch says he was not Allelujah six ages died to go to heaven Enoch was the seventh from the first Adam but in this hour this halleluia the seventh from the first second Adam there is a people in Charlotte who received the opening of The Seven the seal [Applause] seven Thunders utter their voices a mystery to show us how to prepare for translation faith the opening of the word gives us Faith to be changed to lose us from time to change our bodies so we can move from time into eternity rather this is the hour the church is to be raptured this is the hour this Mortal body will put on immortality Jesus said I got to prepare a place for you and I will come again he didn't say I'll come with a shout a voice and a trump but when he showed pull that mystery oh my God Paul saw it as a three-fold mystery and in festivals for power speaking of Jesus coming again with a shout a voice and a trump and in second Thessalonians 1 he says and when Jesus is revealed with his mighty Angels inflaming fire from heaven and when Jesus can I preach to you is being revealed in flaming fire with these Mighty angels when it comes to be glorified in his Saints they have to come into glorification to change Dimensions so rapturing Faith lays in the message it must be taken from the message books and tips and put in us so that Rapture in faith comes in US so there is something ministers in the message have to find because Luther read the same Bible that brother Branham read but Luther only saw justification he took out the material and went and made horse and buggy Wesley saw a little more than Luther he went and met a motor car but they were based on the fundamental teachings but the church was still EarthBound but the Pentecostals started seeing the gifts of the Spirit something to go in the Supernatural Allelujah the spirit of God coming down into people and giving them divine utterances so as man was discovering truth in the Bible the church was advancing and the Wright brothers discovered material in the same Earth that those scientists who made the will of the horse and buggy and who made the motor car was sick they were studied something seeing something in this going up into the air are we together they were now getting into the Heavenly places getting into this Supernatural atmosphere but the problem is planes only fly around but listen there was one who came who started looking for materials Luther Wesleyan Pentecostals couldn't find in the Bible he found something more than justification modern sanctification more than the gift of the spirit and he began to find the kind of man that God made in the Bible and back in the Garden of Eden he found how the fog came by the serpent seed he began to understand why Jesus couldn't be born by sex he found what condition new bed will bring a man into he found out that only elect could be eternal because God is in eternal he found out that we bypassed our theophany when we were created we're supposed to come from thoughts to word to flesh but the main point of a woman goes from thoughts to flesh bypassing the word this is found out that only the redeemed of angels and all these materials was in the Earth and we see how science has advanced by the natural achievements by natural scientists working with the natural scientists in the natural Realm was a shadow a type of spiritual scientist working by spiritual laws with spiritual elements of the Bible the word the mystery truths to bring back the church into his astronaut age and is the great Albert Einstein of this age the national Albert Einstein found that the center of the universe he found the center of the universe are we together the natural Albert Einstein says men have got power to create but he is the spiritual Albert anything who created whoa like what God did back in Eden when he said let there be light and he created spirals and he laid everything in 1200 tapes [Music] these experiments of spiritual scientists must be raised in our local churches in each Church we're supposed to have spiritual scientists finding these materials in the message and raising the church into a supernatural atmosphere brother pranam says science has taken the natural man further in his five senses than ministers have taken the church into the soul [Applause] this is the problem in the message today people they don't know what age they are living in they don't know what anointing has come down in this day we are in the restoration age and the ego anointing has come down and we are seeing so many with the reformer anointing we see a lot of people congregated but not under preparation for translation faith [Music] when you get into the message or among believers you should see a church raised up into the Heavenly places people awakened to the Unseen World and the supernatural people looking to the Unseen like Elisha yet the Young gehazi together in the crisis came and one has the right anointing and the other one is the connection with Elijah and the Unseen World was opened to him and the other one could only tell stories like gehazi you could tell when the prophet was born you could tell how the angel talked to him in the river he could talk about how he met the angel in the cave he can talk about the commission but he's not in the same atmosphere in what the prophet was in but in the days after Elijah was gone Elisha was working with these materials Elijah gave him and he was walking in the Supernatural atmosphere watch these two men one is walking by side and one is walking by faith one is looking to the Unseen and the other is only seeing the political disturbances and the Armed Forces Elisha knew the Angels was all around him he didn't have to tell the prophet to feel that because the prophet was gone look after Jesus went of the scene Paul talking to the angel Peter led by the angel Philip led by the angel why because they understood the message right because Jesus opened up demonology he says when the unclean Spirit lives leaves the place it will come back to the it will come back and the demons had known Jesus and Paul when discussions of skeva came they opened the book and said in the name of Jesus who published and the demon says we know Jesus we know Paul but who is you Hallelujah I'm showing you what realm we are in watch Elijah or Elisha after Elijah and watch the apostles after the days of the son of man we had Elijah and we had the son of man so notice two spiritual scientists the spiritual scientists must take us into that realm of rupturing faith and brother brother was disappointed and he says what's the matter with the church today science has taken men further in the five senses more than ministers have taken the church into the soul scientists empowered men in this hour with knowing the thank you Pastor with knowing this the tree of Good and Evil [Music] Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone are we together he took the materials and made a cell phone it was a log you know it was remember those days we used to have a directory and a big phone like this but look why how science had advanced now everything you find it in an iPhone the phone book the library everything so science is advancing are we together then Benjamin Franklin came there's those things we used to call the Flambeau where you put a string and then you light it up and the wind would blow it but still they were worried because a lot of people were lives were losing people were dying and one time he tied a kite and tied the spoon somewhere there and brah Brahm talks about this Benjamin Franklin and he said one time he put it in the air and the lightning struck and he saw the light he says I've got it I've got it I've got it but still he was not convinced and then he passed away without explaining all these things are we together are we together then Thomas Edison came are we together and he looked for the materials Benjamin Franklin was using and Barbara says he used to stay in a three-story building with wires powered from there and he tried nine to nine point nine whatever whatever until the light came are we together let me rush so we are living in a Time in the season before you travel before you go anywhere you have to study the times and seasons before you go to Florida or Texas you have to find like what season are we in is it winter is it cold you have to have the you have to research to have the knowledge to have the requirements of what you're going to put on but as message believers Hallelujah we have books and message books and tips which shows you where you are going what kind of a body you're going to have how we are going there what preparations have been made for you and we have all these materials we see Noah was manifesting what I call extraterrestrial intelligence when he was making those qubits and so forth because he made contact with extraterrestrial being Enoch the same brother pranam the same are we together let's talk about the mount Transfiguration conference Moses was born 1400 years before Christ and was born in Egypt and Pharaoh was king of Egypt and Elijah there you go was born 800 years before Christ and he lived in the time of Ahab and Jezebel are we together so we see Peter James and John edley Witnesses from this sex one body since Moses said Elijah in their theophonists Peter James and John they were in their terrestrial bodies then Jesus passed into glorification what was happening Jesus he was reassing the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ what time are we living next light we are living in the four raptures we are living the first Rapture was Enoch the second one was Elijah the third Rapture next slide was Jesus who took the ultimate Testament Saints and the fourth one that's us I'm reminded when brother Branagh went to the sixth dimension he went and saw the Old Testament Saints and they said oh God bless you brother God bless you in this and to cut the long story short and brother Branham says can you take me to you Jesus and you know what they say we are waiting for you to present us to him says will Paul do the same say certainly will Peter do the same certainly make it mine will make it because I preached what Paul priest I preached what Peter priest and in the sense they correct with one voice and then it says on this we are resting we are resting upon the world we are resting upon the cause of Malachi 4. one time they examined him they put him on the machine everyone who has been put on a machine there's got lines that are closed like this but when they examined brother Branham they saw that on the machine he had lines that way far apart like this and they said according to this machine it means that you can walk and dream while you are awake he was not yeah yeah brother brother pranam was not just an ordinary man he was a man of God sent for this generation and there will never be any Elijah than Elijah Malachi four are we together can you put a picture of brother Branham with a pillow fire there you go in 1950 he went to Houston Texas and Reverend best wanted to debate with him so they took pictures seven to be precise the first one was blank the second was blank the third the fourth was blank the sixth was blank but the 70 picture we are living in the days where people like to take selfies God came and took a selfie with his own prophet so the promises were made to Abraham and this seed any man baptized in Christ is Abraham's seed Abraham is the father of many nations I feel like preaching now Abraham is the father of them that believe so Abraham has got ham and pranam has got ham and seven letters which means he's a father of many nations that's why praname has got children in America Parliament children in Zimbabwe pranam as children in South Africa pranama's children in Congo pranam as children in New Zealand planning my children in Kenya he is the father of many nations God was showing him a vision when his children were marching Onward Christian Soldiers and he said stay in line stay in line and they reach to a certain place where they began to break the law of gravity and they were taken up in the heavens all those who rejected Prana Ministry they were going down into hell so we see the seven Messengers from poor to brother Branham they went to heaven by the way of the grave as Gladius Paul was as great as brother pranam was they went to heaven by the way of the grave but we who alive and remain until the coming of the lord we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the promise [Music] next slide in the word heart there is an ear in the red heart days here in the word heart so when the word is being preached you have an ear to hear in your heart Hallelujah do you know that a Believer is more dangerous than an unbeliever the poor that the snake that he'd pour here Paul was more dangerous to the snake that hit him than the snake was dangerous to him when it hit him he just shook it in the fire and tonight there is fire here to check every situation David was more dangerous to Goliath than Goliath was dangerous to him Daniel was more dangerous to the Lions than the Lions was dangerous to him when he went to the Lion's Den the Bible says Daniel was fasting his fasting caused the Lions or affected the Lions when he went into the lion's den the Lions also went on fasting Joshua and Caleb were more dangerous to the Giants than Giants were dangerous to them was more dangerous to Haman than Haman was dangerous to him you are a danger to your dangers your sickness is in danger today because you are more powerful than an unbeliever [Applause] the rapture can I preach now the Rapture does not start with the body change it ends with a body change the Rapture is happening right now you already raptured Hallelujah Hallelujah he says behold listen the Rapture is not going to happen as a you know like you're going to be shocked to say hey the Rapture has happened no no no no no no no no no he says it's a secret behold I come as a thief at night how does a thief come when a thief comes to your house at 3am he has already come are we together when he jumps the gate and enters into the house he has already come when he sees an iPhone and puts it in the pocket he has already come when you wake up at 7 00 am and you find you the phone is gone the thief already came at 3am in 1963 the thief came Hallelujah and he came doing what he was doing Hallelujah he was changing me Hallelujah and he was getting closer he was getting closer my theophany speaks to me Hallelujah Hallelujah by the time Charlotte wakes up Hallelujah the Hallelujah brother Caleb is no more Hallelujah by the time they opened their eyes my brother is no more brother Greg is no more brother Steve is no more why because the thief has already come [Applause] we are not waiting for the manifestation of the rapture the Rapture is not a one-day event the Rapture is a process you are raptured before you are raptured Enoch was raptured before he was raptured he was walking with God he was walking with God and he reached a higher Dimension I'm no longer operating from Charlotte I'm now operating from that third pool Realm I mean the word and the word is in me I'm in the Deadpool and the third pool is in me I'm in the Rapture because the Rapture is in me I'm in the spoken word because the spoken word is in me you're already raptured that's why you are rejoicing that's why you are saying amen but there is something in you that tells you that you are Rapture candidate there is something in you that tells you that you shall be changed before you are changed you start rejoicing why because there is a substance of what you are hoping for [Music] oh yes the Bible says at that day then problem says which is this day you shall know that I am in the father and the father is in me I don't have time I would have drawn here if I had a truck here because of time I was going to draw a big circle and I'll write God on it inside that big step I draw a smaller Circle then I'll write Christ on it inside that's why draw another smaller Circle and the right brother calebunion here so before the devil touches you he has to go through God he has to get to Christ before he touches you have to go through justification he has to go through sanctification before that he's already receive the Holy Ghost and he's already your brother you are untouchable a Believer has got nothing to worry about we are eternally secured we are protected we are surrounded by the Lord Jesus Christ so brother sister God is not complete without you God is waiting on you no devil can get a

with a brother are there no virgins without a brother you would say brother go and see the pastor and let God have Grace on you my brother go and confess and the pastor will pray for you but God likes

God but the message of the hour is the will of God you can come to me remember in the time of Noah Noah started to build an ark it was the word of God to build an ark and the will of God in that day but if you come today when show me in the Bible is still the word of God but it's no longer the will of God you are privileged you are a chosen generation Hallelujah next quote my brother Christ is reviewed in his own word now when we're growing up we're told that heaven is a very far place then says now we are going to find out one of these days Hallelujah that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else he says you are still right here just in another dimension faster than this next quote 31 he says in God who is rich in Mercy and Redemption is two parts come out and entering into first you have to come out some people want to bring the world in with them but you've got to come out of this world and enter into Christ come out of unbelief and enter into Faith next next 24. now but he was telling them after the death there is a life because I go to prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to them and what a consolation that ought to give us to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we are going to go into next slide he says your birth was here was pre-planned I guess you believe that Hallelujah every one of you that our bed was pre-planned did you know that being here was never originated as a myth or thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you will be here next slide and if we are Christians I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead we don't have to just have to guess at it we are notified of our destination will be now Jesus is speaking about he's going ahead to prepare a place for us see what I mean all you little children do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight there is a body waiting Yonder there's a body waiting to be received he said people don't be deceived the Devil is a deceiver even that wedding comment you must wear it it must be he says now we are here at the evening time and the Earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we are preparing to enter into the Heavenly and we now feel that strange call of God can't you hear my brother your theophany calling it's a sign that is homegoing time the pillar on fire went behind human skin and revealed these seven sins Abraham at one point didn't know that there is a life after this life is ended and he was like who is this man who is not beginning and no ending of life and Moses could and this man could tell Moses to say I am that I am where did this man come from that talks to Moses and met Moses because with a connection with this man he could create who is this man that Moses met who says I am that I am in the same Pillar of Fire that met Moses Paul met the same Pillar of Fire and because Paul says Moses bore the reproach of Christ and barbraham says where did Moses meet Christ in brobraham says Christ was an angel give me that next quote God in God was in the form before he came flesh can you give me that verse in the Bible in Acts yeah so this man Paul says the angel of the Lord who's I am and whom I serve look at this scripture for they stood by me at night an angel of God whose I am and who myself was he saving an angel who was this angel can I preach to people who are spiritual here do you think this is a created angel that's the Creator and immerses in connection with this one he created William Branham in connection with this Angel he created Abraham saw the spoken word created realm in connection with this man Apostle the angel of the Lord whose I am in whom I serve is he saving an angel a whole Prophet messenger that is Jehovah angel and brother Brahm says the same one who came to Moses came to Paul and he came to me so Abraham met Melchizedek Melchizedek met El Shaddai and the same Elohim came into the body of Flesh and he met Jehovah Jireh who created a lamp was it four different people it was the same person brother pranam says how do I know he's the same person he says he does the same things so he preached who is this Melchizedek he preached El Shaddai he preached Elohim the son of the son of man in human flesh and he preached Jehovah Jireh yet the same experience with this man he changes his form but not his nature Hallelujah and he and this one encompassed these who have angels in heaven because he is the king of heavenly Jerusalem and in that City John saw the bride it was the Lamb's wife it was a pyramid City Jesus said in my father's name in my father's house are many mansions John saw many mansions in the code ate a city and that city is the Lamb's wife and the Lamb's wife is the names in the lamps section of the book and the names in the lamp section of the book is the Eternal attributes that come from his loins a royal priesthood we are redeemed as Kings and Priests and the marriage supper is the true communion says when I went on the other side I saw many of you in millions and all those with angels there they've got terrestrial bodies in it says I saw many of you and all those in theophan is they have terrestrial bodies here when Paradise is emptied out they will come and pick back up and now this board is getting ready to be dissolved this body is fixing to be changed and you feel that strange call we are hearing from our to your family in closing when winter is coming there is an intelligence that goes into the sap of the tree and goes into the root and it hides there until winter is done are we together what about the Drake he goes into the ocean four thousand miles deep there is a law of navigation in him are we together when that season comes he goes back to the same place of its origin Solomon says consider the ways of an end he knows winter is coming so in summer is gathering all the food when the season comes he has stored food through God through the winter animals are being contacted from another world they understand the season even the ducks in the pond they navigate with the stars and the moon and they fly very thousands of miles perfect GPS and what about the cows and the birds when the earthquake is about to happen are we together they say they they're being contacted from another world and brother Brahm says if birds and animals and all these things could be directed and led by God about a season what about a church claiming to have the Holy Ghost we feel that we feel that strange call Hallelujah you are in the message 20 years 30 years what do you feel this message of the hour is not a new religion it's leading us to God's provided way and the gene of God is inside of you this curtain of time this body it veils the gene of God inside of you what is the message it's opening up our pre-existence teaching us our athlete Journey and showing us our Eternal destination Redemption is bringing us back to your origin there is no concept of the Rapture without these things there is no religion no Hinduism no Buddhism shows you where you were before you came here on in show you what you'll be
