[34:34] time I called um she's been having um
[34:38] she was really sick and I was like mom
[34:40] what was what what at that time I asked
[34:42] what was wrong with you and then she
[34:44] said um daughter I almost got stroke and
[34:48] even till now I'm finding it difficult
[34:51] to walk you know so I have to send her
[34:56] compression socks and all that and you
[34:59] know it's from what my siblings were
[35:00] telling me it was really bad and they
[35:02] didn't want to tell me but I thank God
[35:05] that today she's okay she's walking well
[35:08] and also she's able to you know go do
[35:12] her business and then a month later or
[35:15] two that was around the same time I was
[35:17] going through some stuff my auntie
[35:20] called me from Atlanta and said um of
[35:23] course we rush your dad last night to
[35:25] the ER and he's also um he he's get he
[35:30] he has mouth stroke and I was like what
[35:33] is going on you know and with me they
[35:37] had even scheduled me to go do a
[35:38] mamogram cuz I was having a severe
[35:40] breast pain so um I called I called him
[35:44] I did not get him and then later on I
[35:47] think two days later he called he called
[35:49] me and I was like dad what is going on
[35:52] and then he told me what is going on
[35:55] that he can't like half of his body he
[35:57] can't move like it's really bad you know
[36:01] so every now and then I'll be checking
[36:02] up and then I think a while back I
[36:05] called and he told me oh I'm going to
[36:07] the doctor's appointment driving by
[36:09] myself and this is something I want to
[36:12] thank God for my mom and my dad's life
[36:15] and also my life my life and recently I
[36:18] think the same this was in July I went
[36:23] to do my last course I was having this
[36:25] severe breast pain and at that time my
[36:29] doctor my my primary care doctor wanted
[36:31] me to do a mamogram but then they had
[36:34] said if you are not up to 40 and you do
[36:37] that the insurance is not going to cover
[36:39] so um she tested me and find out that
[36:43] she thinks it's a hormonal thing so they
[36:46] did series of test and then the test
[36:49] came out the following week she called
[36:51] and said all your labs looks good
[36:53] everything and I she told me my GFR
[36:56] which is my kidney functioning cuz I was
[36:58] so worried whenever I'm not feeling
[37:00] well. I get so worried about my labs
[37:02] because of my immune system and all
[37:04] that. So I always get worried but then I
[37:06] know it is well. So I asked her to check
[37:10] my GFR that's the first thing I'll ask
[37:13] for and they say your GFR is 118 is is
[37:16] good. You know just that because of the
[37:18] pain medication you're taking your liver
[37:21] was a little elevated. And then last
[37:23] week I went to check and the liver was
[37:25] good. The GFR was good. I saw my kidney
[37:27] doctor on that was yesterday. She also
[37:30] said, "You're doing so well." And she's
[37:33] amazed, you know. So, I just want to
[37:34] thank God for my life. Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael has a short one. Amen.
[37:44] So, Brother Michael, Amen.
[37:50] I'll try and make it short.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you, Lord,
[37:55] &gt;&gt; for what you've done for me.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing
[38:00] now.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for every little thing.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, because you make me
[38:07] sing.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, uh, Brother Valentine
[38:12] was here. Remember that night?
[38:14] And um for weeks before he came, I I've
[38:18] been suffering under, you know, these
[38:21] packages that keep coming to you and he
[38:23] keeps sending them back.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; And um I'm thinking, you know, I want to
[38:28] work. It's your kidney, it's your liver,
[38:30] it's your this and I'll go to sleep on
[38:33] my left side. I'm okay. But when you go
[38:35] on the right side, you know, this pain
[38:36] just start coming. And I it was in the
[38:40] day and it start to get worse. So you
[38:41] start to waver a little bit and say,
[38:44] "Lord, devil,
[38:46] I'm not taking this.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; You got to leave.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; I I'm not taking this." And the same
[38:53] Wednesday night, Brother Valentine came
[38:56] and preached on the same thing, you
[38:58] know. So you probably saw my amens was a
[39:00] lot louder and very sincere because
[39:02] right there sitting there, that pain
[39:05] just left and it haven't come back
[39:07] since. Amen.

[39:28] to those things. But you know, Caleb was
[39:31] 80 and he's like, "Give me my mountain."

[39:48] that you're doing for your bride, Lord
[39:50] God, in this little assembly, Lord

[39:56] the prayer nights are making a
[39:58] difference, Lord God. how it fills our

[40:10] to come down, Lord, and just fill our
[40:12] homes and our lives, Lord. How wonderful
[40:14] it is, Lord, to take that time and just
[40:17] spend it with you, Lord God.

[40:22] service tonight, Lord God. We thank you,
[40:24] Father, convention night. And Lord, we
[40:27] just want to ask that you touch our
[40:29] brothers, Lord, as they preach and as
[40:31] they translate, Lord God. And just,
[40:33] Lord, fill this house with your glory
[40:35] this evening, Lord God. We just thank
[40:38] you, Father. And you heard the prayer
[40:40] request from Brother JM, Lord God. And
[40:43] we just want to ask that you reach out
[40:45] to the man, Lord, and touch him, Lord
[40:47] God. These are perilous times, Lord.
[40:50] We're seeing those scriptures come to
[40:53] life right before us, Lord God. And we
[40:57] thank you for the assurance that we have
[40:58] in your word, Lord God, and the
[41:00] promises, Lord. And we're looking, Lord,
[41:03] every day for you to come get us, Lord
[41:07] God. How much worse does it have to get,
[41:10] Lord, before you come and take us from
[41:12] this world, Lord? Thank you for helping
[41:15] us, Lord, under the leadership of this
[41:17] church, Lord, and this pastor to help us
[41:20] to make ourselves ready, Lord God. We
[41:23] ask that you bless the pastor and his
[41:25] family as well, Lord. Put Job's hedge up
[41:28] around every one of us, Lord, and keep
[41:31] Satan away from us, Lord God, that we
[41:33] can just continuously serve you, Lord.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, it comes time now for the tithing
[41:39] and the offering, Lord. And we just want
[41:40] to ask that you bless it, Lord.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; We watched the plumbers a little while
[41:44] today, Lord God, prepare in the
[41:46] fellowship hall, Lord Jesus. And we know
[41:49] that those are just the beginning of
[41:51] things, Lord. But we know that you're
[41:54] going to take care of us on everything
[41:56] that we need for that, Lord. So, we just
[41:59] ask, Lord God, that you have your will
[42:02] in that building, Lord, and the times to
[42:05] come, Lord, that we'll share together in
[42:08] there, Lord God, if you terry, we'd
[42:12] rather you not terry. We'd rather you
[42:15] come on the scene, Lord. So we thank you
[42:18] once again tonight, Lord. Bless the
[42:20] tithing and the offering. Bless the
[42:21] giver, Lord. Bless those who can't,
[42:24] Lord, and wish they could, Lord. But we
[42:26] want everything to go to the furtherance
[42:28] of the kingdom of God. We thank you for
[42:30] the wonderful worship service this
[42:32] evening, Lord, the songs that were sung,
[42:34] Lord. But it's time to break forth the
[42:37] bread, Lord. And we just want to put our
[42:38] bibs on, Lord, and just sit ready. And
[42:41] we thank you, Father, for this time
[42:43] together once again, Lord. What a
[42:45] special group that you've put together
[42:47] in this church. Lord, bless those that
[42:50] are streaming as well. Lord, those that
[42:52] are on the way. We thank you, Father, in
[42:54] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen.

[51:30] I want to thank God
[51:32] &gt;&gt; because on last two weeks, the last
[51:36] Thursday in the month, I picked up my
[51:38] prescription. Thanking God I met my
[51:40] deductible so I didn't have to pay
[51:42] anything. The two prescription amongst
[51:45] close to $1,000.
[51:48] I had to rush to work, so I left it in
[51:51] the car. Apparently, Adasa thought it
[51:54] was trash and she threw it away. So
[51:56] Sunday when I was looking for it because
[51:58] I I needed it, I couldn't find it
[52:00] anywhere. She said, "Mom, I think I
[52:02] throw it away." So we came to church
[52:05] hearing the word that God is going to
[52:07] restore without money. I said, "Lord, is
[52:09] either it comes back out the trash some
[52:12] because trash went on last Wednesday or
[52:15] you just do something miraculous." The
[52:17] Lord said, "Call the insurance company.
[52:19] Let them know what happened." I told
[52:21] them. Now, before I misplaced a med, I I
[52:24] forgot it somewhere and it was just
[52:26] about $100. And they says, "I'm sorry,
[52:29] you already got your prescription for
[52:30] the month. We cannot restore it." So, I
[52:33] had to pay the $100. So, they told me to
[52:36] they would evaluate, give them 72 hours.
[52:40] So, they called me this morning and they
[52:41] said, "Miss Falby, go pick up a
[52:44] prescription. One is not quite ready,
[52:46] but you pay $0 and I got everything
[52:49] restored." I want to thank them.
[52:58] What celebration
[53:01] on that day?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; We know it can't be far away.
[53:10] [Applause]

[1:02:58] you will see the manifestation of
[1:03:00] everything that we're not spending time
[1:03:02] in vain, but God is alive and we serve a
[1:03:05] God that hearing our prayer. Why all
[1:03:08] this time my internet never got a
[1:03:10] problem? Only on Tuesday at 4:00.
[1:03:16] So he knew what was coming up on
[1:03:18] Tuesday. But thank God we had a backup
[1:03:21] and today everything is back to normal
[1:03:23] and it was an accident and somebody
[1:03:25] didn't tell me. They just cut my line
[1:03:28] and didn't say anything. And after
[1:03:30] prayer prayer right after prayer
[1:03:32] finished they sent me a message to let
[1:03:33] me know what happened.
[1:03:38] So the prayer convicted them
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and today everything is back and they
[1:03:44] took that line and bury that again down.
[1:03:47] Amen. Everything is working together for
[1:03:51] good. Amen. If you're not sure about it,

[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody need to receive a blessing
[1:04:16] tonight. We don't come to church and go
[1:04:18] back the same way. When you get in
[1:04:20] church, something must take place. When
[1:04:22] you leave, you say, "It was good to be
[1:04:25] in the presence of the Lord." Amen. So,

[1:07:44] is chosen by God.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And there's things that we'll see this
[1:07:50] evening.
[1:07:53] You can pray very well
[1:07:56] and stuff will not come down from
[1:07:57] heaven. Why?
[1:08:02] Because what you have asked had already
[1:08:04] left heaven
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; and is already dwelling in a man
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and is dwelling in men.
[1:08:14] When you have the revelation of season,
[1:08:19] your destination is clear.
[1:08:22] And that's what we'll see this night.
[1:08:24] May God bless you richly.
[1:08:27] Since y'all are standing,
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:32] we'll open our Bible to the book of
[1:08:34] Mark.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 11.
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; We'll take verse 12 to 14.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And even 21.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Are you there? Can you say amen?
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] We read in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:00] Christ. Amen.
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And on the tomorrow when he were come
[1:09:08] from Bethany, he was hungry.
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:28] And seeing a fig tree a far off having
[1:09:32] leaves, he came if happily he might find
[1:09:35] anything thereon. And when he came to
[1:09:38] it, he found nothing but leaves, for the
[1:09:41] time of figs was not yet.
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:53] And Jesus answered and said unto A, "No
[1:09:57] man eat fruit from thee hereafter
[1:10:00] forever." And his disciples heard it.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:15] And verse 21, and Peter calling to
[1:10:18] remembrance says unto him, Master,
[1:10:21] behold the fig tree which thou hast
[1:10:23] cursed is withered away. That's right
[1:10:32] to save time. We won't read in Mark.
[1:10:34] It's the same story.
[1:10:37] We'll pray the Lord,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; eternal Lord, heavenly father, creator
[1:10:43] of heaven and earth,
[1:10:45] we see ourselves this evening in your
[1:10:47] house,
[1:10:49] knowing that we're in the end time.
[1:10:53] We're in this season of the end time.
[1:10:56] And we're in need of you, Lord.
[1:11:00] If there's a moment that we need you,
[1:11:03] it's this moment here right now that we
[1:11:05] need you.
[1:11:08] The woman with the blood issue needed
[1:11:10] you.
[1:11:13] She didn't want to miss the season
[1:11:16] knowing that you were deceiving.
[1:11:19] Their answer to all questions, to all
[1:11:22] problems. And this evening, Lord, your
[1:11:26] people are before you.
[1:11:29] They're not before a man,
[1:11:31] but before you, God, they came.
[1:11:34] Even those online hearing us,
[1:11:37] they're waiting for you, Lord.
[1:11:41] There are people that are disappointed,
[1:11:43] discourage,
[1:11:46] but they know that you're the person
[1:11:47] kept on giving them glory. It doesn't
[1:11:49] matter the sickness. It doesn't matter
[1:11:51] the problem.
[1:11:53] It doesn't matter the situation.
[1:11:56] You, Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:59] You're the one who does operation
[1:12:00] without scars. you you can manifest
[1:12:03] yourself this way. We want to thank you
[1:12:05] Lord.
[1:12:07] Bless the service of God. Remove us from
[1:12:10] the past. We came from reading.
[1:12:14] But the people that were in school to
[1:12:16] learn how to read.
[1:12:19] But when it comes to interpret your word
[1:12:23] that takes your domain alone
[1:12:27] may come down so you may manifest
[1:12:28] yourself. So you may speak to us all.
[1:12:31] may remove us from the way. May you take
[1:12:33] control
[1:12:35] from the pulpit all the way to the last
[1:12:36] row and bless your people. Thank you for
[1:12:39] everything in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; We thank the pastor
[1:12:50] for this opportunity again
[1:12:52] that he gave us
[1:12:55] to make a little noise
[1:12:57] in the behalf of God.
[1:13:01] Without taking time,
[1:13:06] we'll also read something. Exodus.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; In Exodus chapter
[1:13:12] 23.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 23. Yes, sir.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 10 to 12.
[1:13:23] He says this,
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:31] "And six years thou shalt sow thy land
[1:13:34] and shall gather the fruits thereof."
[1:13:37] That's right.
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:59] But the seventh year thou shalt let it
[1:14:02] rest and and lie still, that the poor of
[1:14:06] thy people may eat, and what they leave,
[1:14:10] the beast of the of the field shall eat
[1:14:14] in like Amen.
[1:14:31] In like manner thou shalt eat with thy
[1:14:33] vineyard. Verse 12. Six days thou shalt
[1:14:36] do thy work and on the seventh day thou
[1:14:38] shalt rest that thine ox and thy ass may
[1:14:41] rest and the son of thy handmade and the
[1:14:44] stranger may be refreshed.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; We can also read in leviticus
[1:14:53] chapter 25.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] Fore!
[1:15:06] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:16] Verse
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:27] 10. And ye shall hollow the fif the 50th
[1:15:30] year, and proclaim liberty throughout
[1:15:32] all the land, unto all the inhabitants
[1:15:35] thereof. It shall be a jubilee unto you.
[1:15:38] And ye shall return every man unto his
[1:15:40] possession, and ye shall return every
[1:15:42] man unto his family.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:57] Very
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:05] a jubilee. Verse 11. A jubilee shall
[1:16:07] that 50 50th year be unto you. You shall
[1:16:12] not sow, neither reap that which go
[1:16:15] which groweth of itself in it, nor
[1:16:17] gatherth the grapes of the grapes in it
[1:16:20] of thy vain undressed.
[1:16:28] I'll read something in Deuteronomy
[1:16:32] 23.
[1:16:42] Deuteronomy
[1:16:43] 23
[1:16:45] verse 10
[1:16:49] to 12.
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:08] If there be, if there be among you any
[1:17:10] man that is not clean by reason of
[1:17:12] uncleanness, that chances him by night,
[1:17:16] then shall he chaseth him by night, then
[1:17:19] shall he go aboard out of the camp. He
[1:17:22] shall not within the camp. He shall not
[1:17:25] come within the camp.
[1:17:35] But it shall be with the evening cometh
[1:17:37] on, he shall wash himself with water,
[1:17:40] and when the sun is down, he shall come
[1:17:43] into the camp again.
[1:17:52] Thou shalt have a place with also
[1:17:54] without the camp whether thou shalt go
[1:17:57] forth aboard.
[1:18:03] May the Lord God add a blessing to the
[1:18:04] reading of his word.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:12] The pastor just kept from talking here
[1:18:14] that we are creators
[1:18:16] that we are gods.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham speaks
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; in and
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; give me a minute
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; and the love divine divine love.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You can read it.
[1:18:40] of 56
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; 0926
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; in par in paragraph 26
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; he speaks of this
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; he says that you are a creator
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:57] a amateur a miniature
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; as we are here we are creators
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; am I creators
[1:19:09] meaning we can create something.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't matter.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your condition.
[1:19:22] Brother Brandon speaks about the gift
[1:19:24] unfold of God of 1960
[1:19:32] in paragraph 25.
[1:19:35] He says this,
[1:19:37] it doesn't take it doesn't take a big
[1:19:40] church
[1:19:42] but of a big God
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; inside the church.
[1:19:48] It doesn't take
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a mountain.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a holy mountain, but a
[1:19:56] God who is holy in the mountain. It
[1:20:00] doesn't take a holy man,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; but a God who is holy inside the man.
[1:20:08] We saw the little boy who was singing
[1:20:10] right here.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You had to remember so the walls of
[1:20:15] Jericho can fall down. It was not
[1:20:17] prayer.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; It was the shout.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; It was the shout after this trumpet.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; The walls of Jericho fell down like this
[1:20:30] evening.
[1:20:33] The amen hallelujah that you will give
[1:20:35] to God
[1:20:38] that will make that will crumble the
[1:20:40] walls of Jericho in your life. It
[1:20:43] doesn't matter your situation.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Our subject this evening is Jesus is
[1:20:49] your season.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus is your season.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the place that you may
[1:20:59] find yourself.
[1:21:02] When the season comes,
[1:21:08] everything even the condition that
[1:21:10] that's there should be subjected to it
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; when the season comes.
[1:21:18] If the trees
[1:21:22] may have to drop their leaves,
[1:21:25] it doesn't it doesn't matter how many
[1:21:28] times
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; they the leaves will fall.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Because the season the season will
[1:21:38] condition things and that's what we'll
[1:21:41] see this evening.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know your your state of your
[1:21:45] soul. I don't know the state of your
[1:21:47] health or your situation or your
[1:21:50] affairs,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; but you have to know that this evening
[1:21:54] that this season
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; is coming to your boat, to your arm.
[1:22:00] Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; May God be blessed.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:22:13] We read in Exodus,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I'll read something that the prophet
[1:22:20] said. Jehovah Gyra,
[1:22:24] second part, 1962,
[1:22:27] paragraph 31.
[1:22:30] I'll just read something.
[1:22:32] The prophet says this, "If I love
[1:22:35] Christ,
[1:22:37] it'd be a lot more better for me to brag
[1:22:40] on his church."
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Then it would be brag on him.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:22:52] I would rather you brag on my children.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Me, Brandham.
[1:23:04] may God be worshiped. That's what Jesus
[1:23:06] said. They asked Jesus,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; "What is the works of God
[1:23:13] doing his will,
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; believing
[1:23:17] to whom he had sent?"
[1:23:20] He was not speaking about the father. He
[1:23:23] was speaking about the people that will
[1:23:24] be chosen, that will be sent out, him as
[1:23:27] one that was sent. You need to believe
[1:23:29] on those that are saved.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You need to believe on those that are
[1:23:33] sent to you.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I told you that
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; what you're looking for this evening
[1:23:41] already left heaven and is already
[1:23:43] dwelling on earth.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] Abraham.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:23:51] He was seeing visions. He was seeing
[1:23:53] dreams
[1:23:55] that God was talking to him.
[1:23:59] He did not have the son of the promise.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter all the vision that he
[1:24:07] saw
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; or how many times that God could have
[1:24:10] spoken to him.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He was seeking for the son and he did
[1:24:15] not obtain it until
[1:24:19] he received
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; the visitation of three strangers. Amen.
[1:24:30] God gave the earth to man.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; God cannot steal.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He cannot violate.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He cannot operate on earth without the
[1:24:44] permission of man,
[1:24:49] without associating himself with the
[1:24:51] hands of man
[1:24:54] or it will be a violation. a
[1:24:56] jurisdictional violation.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] That's why
[1:25:03] every single time God wants to do
[1:25:05] something,
[1:25:07] he has to compare. He has to come to
[1:25:08] man.
[1:25:10] He had to confront with man. Even in the
[1:25:12] forest where you may be. Amen.
[1:25:16] He would take the form of man to come
[1:25:19] down over there. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:24] That's why God cannot operate.
[1:25:26] on earth.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's always through men.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. Abraham
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; and Abraham
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; and received three visitors
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; but Lot only received two. Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:51] And we're asking where's the third
[1:25:54] um from Lot.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I believe it was the promise of Abraham
[1:26:02] that was the third that was walking.
[1:26:06] Maybe it was Isaac who was talking.
[1:26:10] God promised Abraham that next year I
[1:26:13] will come. The next year came and then
[1:26:16] there was nobody.
[1:26:18] But who was in the third year? I mean in
[1:26:21] the next year. It was the promise of
[1:26:23] Isaac. It was Isaac who was talking now.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It was Isaac who was in the wall. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; God cannot operate anything on earth
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; without associating with men. Hello.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Now this evening
[1:26:40] we read the fig tree
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; that Jesus had cursed.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] Jesus had cursed the fig and we all know
[1:26:53] that the that the season that Jesus
[1:26:57] found himself
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; it was the season of the fig.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That he had no fig. It was not the
[1:27:07] season of the fig.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; But he sees the leaf.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; But he is God. He knows all.
[1:27:18] How is he going to approach something
[1:27:20] that has nothing?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; My beloved,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[1:27:27] "I came from the lost sheep from the
[1:27:29] house of Israel."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] Doesn't matter your situation. It
[1:27:35] doesn't matter your sin.
[1:27:38] The lamb was slain.
[1:27:40] And Jesus came close to the tree.
[1:27:51] because he had because he was hungry. He
[1:27:53] was reclaiming the fig.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Like now since the fig tree couldn't
[1:28:00] give fig
[1:28:06] to the fig,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; it is not your season.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] is the season of the sun.
[1:28:19] Where is the sun?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; It is the works, the fruit.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Wherever the feast, the sun is is the
[1:28:28] fruit.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Where is the sun? It's the fruit.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He found Mary tells him,
[1:28:40] "We're looking for wine."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] Because wherever the sun is, the fruit
[1:28:47] must appear,
[1:28:49] he takes water and after he turns it, he
[1:28:53] changes it to wine. And people were
[1:28:56] happy.
[1:28:58] Meaning where the sun is, there has to
[1:29:01] be words. Amen.
[1:29:04] That's why on that day
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; when Peter
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; with his knowledge
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; with his science that he had
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; knowing the season of everything
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:21] he threw and was fishing all night.
[1:29:25] He didn't receive anything. He didn't
[1:29:27] catch anything. But when Jesus came to
[1:29:29] his boat,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to show to Peter that
[1:29:36] wherever the son is,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; that's when the works are there.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Wherever the wherever you
[1:29:46] must be, works must be manifested
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:50] in one part.
[1:29:53] The six in the Bible
[1:29:57] represented Israel like a nation. Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; And in the other part also the fig
[1:30:08] also represent the believer the
[1:30:10] Christian. Now Jesus in his time
[1:30:14] when he saw the Pharisees and the
[1:30:16] Sadducees
[1:30:19] he did not find fruits in their life.
[1:30:24] Because a man, a tree in the Bible
[1:30:28] is a type of man.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; And when and you must bear fruit.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And what we notice is
[1:30:40] there are certain trees that give bad
[1:30:41] fruit
[1:30:44] and there are humans. There are people
[1:30:46] that have bad bad living lifestyle
[1:30:50] that are producing the wrong fruits.
[1:30:55] And Jesus said to those tapestry
[1:30:59] that we will cut them off and they will
[1:31:01] be tossed in the fire
[1:31:05] because wherever the sun is there has to
[1:31:08] be fruit.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Peter threw.
[1:31:13] Peter threw
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; he threw his net
[1:31:18] but when the son had said not when he
[1:31:22] threw casted out his net he caught a lot
[1:31:24] of fish.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; This evening
[1:31:30] I don't know where you tossed your net.
[1:31:33] Maybe they maybe it's work that you're
[1:31:35] looking a job. Maybe it's children that
[1:31:38] you're looking for.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is coming to your boat. Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He's coming to your boat.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; The word that you're hearing this
[1:31:50] evening,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; but it's a season.
[1:31:54] We're in a season.
[1:31:57] The teaching that the man of God is
[1:31:59] giving that we're in a season.
[1:32:03] Don't let that season pass like that.
[1:32:07] It doesn't matter the condition that you
[1:32:09] find yourself in. May you be in the
[1:32:11] valley or not.
[1:32:15] You have to know that the season
[1:32:17] changes.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; When you're placed in the season, it's
[1:32:21] so God can bring you somewhere.
[1:32:25] Don't look at what you had done.
[1:32:30] Don't look at what you had done.
[1:32:33] Don't look at your mistakes.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You have to be focused
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; at the season.
[1:32:41] There is in the Bible, you know, just to
[1:32:43] save time. Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; There's a um a sinful woman.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; You know the story.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But when she met this season,
[1:33:00] she said, "I cannot let this season pass
[1:33:02] by. It doesn't matter my condition.
[1:33:07] I see the season that could change
[1:33:08] everything.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; A woman caught in adultery.
[1:33:16] When she met the season,
[1:33:19] people accused her.
[1:33:22] People were there to condone her,
[1:33:24] condemn her. But before the season, the
[1:33:27] season has said, "The one who had not
[1:33:31] sinned yet toss the first stone.
[1:33:36] The woman had recognized her fault
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and made her confession before Jesus
[1:33:42] and the season had forgiven her.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter your condition.
[1:33:50] It doesn't matter the errors that you
[1:33:51] had made.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; You had to know that the season changes
[1:33:58] and Jesus is the season this evening.
[1:34:02] It is he is your season this evening.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I read something.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; In the mark of the beast of 1956,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; September 15, paragraph 55,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; July
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:34] The prophet says says this, "But God
[1:34:37] said, remember you were one time slaves
[1:34:40] yourself
[1:34:41] and down in Egypt,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and I have freed you."
[1:34:50] Therefore, at the sounding of the
[1:34:51] trumpet, every slave,
[1:34:55] no matter how
[1:34:58] long he's been in or how short a time,
[1:35:02] it doesn't matter how long you've been
[1:35:04] in sin,
[1:35:06] because the person that knows that knows
[1:35:10] the sin is a slave to the sin. The one
[1:35:14] that commits sin is a slave to the sin.
[1:35:18] And here in the Old Testament,
[1:35:21] there were slaves.
[1:35:24] There were people in position
[1:35:28] of hurt for what maybe they couldn't eat
[1:35:29] well. Maybe they couldn't do a certain
[1:35:31] action.
[1:35:34] They were called to be a slave to work
[1:35:36] somewhere
[1:35:38] to obtain at least food.
[1:35:42] But now there were an ordinance. There
[1:35:44] was a law.
[1:35:46] There was the law of Moses.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That said this,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; even if the slave had dwelt with you for
[1:35:59] a long time,
[1:36:05] but if the 50th year come
[1:36:08] in that period,
[1:36:11] you're obligated to free them. Even if
[1:36:14] he killed who?
[1:36:17] Even if he did whatsoever,
[1:36:20] he's obligated to be free
[1:36:24] unless he himself decide to stay slave.
[1:36:30] But I believe the children of God cannot
[1:36:34] accept,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; cannot accept to dwell to remain a slave
[1:36:40] to sin.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:36:44] The lamb was slain
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; and the the grave is empty. The tomb is
[1:36:50] empty. The tomb is empty.
[1:36:54] And this evening we'll see the season
[1:36:57] in all its dimensions.
[1:36:59] How he can come to you for your aid.
[1:37:02] Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; We spoke on how they fig represent
[1:37:09] Israel.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:17] We know that this the fruits are
[1:37:20] seasonal.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; But in that time Jesus had reclaimed
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; and we had seen that.
[1:37:30] It's because he himself was the season
[1:37:34] because wherever the sun is
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; there is fruits.
[1:37:41] We asked Peter
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; when he had tossed the net. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; He had he didn't catch the net.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; But when the season approached
[1:37:54] the season had said cast thy net
[1:38:00] and Peter caught many fish.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus, your season is coming.
[1:38:10] It doesn't matter the condition of your
[1:38:11] life,
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; the impact that the season have in our
[1:38:19] life.
[1:38:23] In our life, what impact does the season
[1:38:26] have in our life?
[1:38:29] When we notice that we're going through
[1:38:30] a difficult time,
[1:38:35] we notice that we're going through a
[1:38:36] serious time.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] What happens?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Usually God finds a way
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; to bring you into you your presence. His
[1:38:51] presence
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; to bring you into his presence.
[1:38:59] He He brings you to your presence so you
[1:39:01] may have time to have to make a decision
[1:39:03] like Ruth. Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:07] You look at the situation that you have
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and you look at the word of God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; What did God say?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Is there a promise for me in the Bible?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And then you have to attach yourself to
[1:39:21] that promise. Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:24] There was one day
[1:39:27] Jesus had many disciples
[1:39:30] and he told them that I am the bread
[1:39:32] that came down from heaven. you must eat
[1:39:35] me so you may have eternal life.
[1:39:39] You need to drink my blood.
[1:39:42] And people were scandalized.
[1:39:46] And among many of them, among many
[1:39:49] disciples,
[1:39:51] there were many, most of them, majority
[1:39:53] of them left, but there was only a small
[1:39:56] little group that stayed, a small little
[1:39:59] group that lived the word of God.
[1:40:03] It was a time for decision.
[1:40:06] And Jesus had asked the question to the
[1:40:08] disciples.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Your friends have left.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; What are you doing here?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; It's a time for decision.
[1:40:20] But Peter has said,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; "You have the word of eternal life."
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go again?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He took the decision like Ruth had also
[1:40:36] talking the taken the decision
[1:40:40] to to go to a strange land
[1:40:44] to trust in a God that she did not know
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; to follow Naomi.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And that's how a Christian must be.
[1:40:55] God is bringing us to that
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; so we can take a decision.
[1:41:03] You'll notice that certain people will
[1:41:05] run away,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; but some will stay.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Please excuse me.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; You will notice
[1:41:19] maybe somewhere
[1:41:22] you did some errors in your life.
[1:41:26] Maybe you are committing certain sin,
[1:41:29] but you will find yourself
[1:41:32] when you hear the sound of the trumpet.
[1:41:35] When you hear the gospel,
[1:41:38] when we read the prophet was talking
[1:41:40] about the sound of the trumpet in the
[1:41:43] Bible, the sound of the trumpet and
[1:41:46] tonight, the sound of the trumpet that
[1:41:48] you're listening to, this gospel that
[1:41:51] I'm preaching to you, it's this word
[1:41:53] that you're listening to.
[1:41:56] That is the sound of the trumpet that
[1:41:59] God is sounding on you that it doesn't
[1:42:02] matter your condition. Even the
[1:42:05] sickness,
[1:42:06] God is capable tonight to change your
[1:42:10] destination.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; He's capable to change your destination.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; God be worshiped.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; There's a time when trees in the season
[1:42:25] and the earth must rest and that's what
[1:42:28] we read in Exodus.
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:32] There's a time that the earth must rest.
[1:42:34] There's also a time that people must
[1:42:37] rest.
[1:42:39] You work for like six six days, but on
[1:42:42] the seventh day, you have to rest.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You had to go in the house of the Lord.
[1:42:47] Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing. You
[1:42:50] believers,
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; you did what you had done, but now you
[1:42:56] had to take rest.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; You had to free yourself from me.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:01] You have to free yourself from me.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You have to look at yourself if you're
[1:43:14] carrying good fruits or not.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; We're speaking about this season.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; There was a man.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; There was a small little boy
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; in the Bible.
[1:43:29] He was doing certain affairs.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And his work was not working.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; But one day
[1:43:38] he met the disciples.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; That's what I tell you this evening.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Your blessing.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I told you you could pray.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; God will answer. Heaven will answer. So,
[1:43:53] but for you to obtain it,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; you have to meet a Peter. Amen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; You have to meet a Peter.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You can read the Bible, but you have to
[1:44:07] meet a Phillip.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; A deacon Phillip. Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because there are people
[1:44:16] that are ordained.
[1:44:19] You have a question.
[1:44:21] You had to come to Pastor Steven.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; In the question and answer.
[1:44:29] There are certain people that God
[1:44:30] ordained.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm returning.
[1:44:35] There are someone that was doing certain
[1:44:36] affairs. Maybe somewhere maybe among you
[1:44:40] someone is doing a business and it's not
[1:44:42] working. You're in need of a connection.
[1:44:45] You're in need of a connection.
[1:44:48] When Jesus was preaching to the people,
[1:44:52] he had compassion
[1:44:54] that people did not eat
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; and said, "You must give them something
[1:44:58] to eat." He told the disciples and the
[1:45:01] disciples said, "No,
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; but the disciples
[1:45:07] and but the disciple made um an option
[1:45:10] gave an option. Unless one tell you, let
[1:45:14] me tell you.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; So you can meet Isaac, you need Eleazar.
[1:45:19] Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; So you can meet You're Rebecca.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; You You're in need of Isaac.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; You're an Eleazer. Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; There's an Eleazar.
[1:45:34] It's like no in this. It's like us in
[1:45:36] the time of the
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You know, you know our Eleazor, right?
[1:45:41] Mario.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It's William Mario Brham.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; It's this message of the end time
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; that's making us
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; that's making us meet the master.
[1:45:56] Now this little boy
[1:45:58] had in his activities
[1:46:01] just five little bread
[1:46:04] and two fish.
[1:46:11] And the disciples made a connection
[1:46:12] between the little boy and Jesus.
[1:46:17] When you brought it to Jesus,
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; when you brought it to Jesus, he
[1:46:23] multiplied it and fed
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; 5,000 men. Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; And the capture received what was left,
[1:46:36] 12 full baskets. Amen.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:43] But look at the five bread
[1:46:46] that they had
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; to find 12 full basket. Why? Because
[1:46:51] they were in faith with the season.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; For your season also, you're in need of
[1:46:56] a connection.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You're in need of a connection.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus is a God of of a meaning.
[1:47:12] He's a place.
[1:47:16] May God be worshiped.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; In John 6
[1:47:24] said, "What must we do to do the will of
[1:47:26] God?"
[1:47:28] And Jesus had told them,
[1:47:30] "The will of God
[1:47:32] is the works of God."
[1:47:36] Meaning believing on whom he had sent.
[1:47:40] me the person he had ordained.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus had said,
[1:47:47] "The person who receives you receives
[1:47:50] me.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; You're seeking to find Jesus, to receive
[1:47:54] Jesus,
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; but his interest
[1:48:01] has already been taken. It's in men."
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; There are certain people
[1:48:10] that are uh anointed by God.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And that is the habitation of God. Amen.
[1:48:19] When you meet those people
[1:48:22] everything that you're in need of, they
[1:48:24] will give it to you, you must remember
[1:48:28] of
[1:48:30] Eleazar in the Elisha in the Old
[1:48:33] Testament
[1:48:36] of a woman that had lost
[1:48:39] her son, the Shinomite woman.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; This woman had found the uh address of
[1:48:50] God.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; She saw that this was a man of man of
[1:48:55] God. I cannot miss the season.
[1:49:00] It doesn't matter for the son that was
[1:49:02] dead.
[1:49:04] You know the following of that story.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; The things that you're reclaiming today
[1:49:11] are no longer in heaven.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; They're already somewhere.
[1:49:18] In the day of Pentecost,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus had promised Joel 2:28,
[1:49:27] "In the last day, I will send my spirit
[1:49:31] to all flesh.
[1:49:34] Your son and your daughters shall
[1:49:36] prophesy. The young shall have visions
[1:49:39] and the old will see dreams.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; But in the day of Pentecost,
[1:49:48] The Holy Ghost had came down,
[1:49:52] God came down in his fullness.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; But what I noticed,
[1:50:00] since that day,
[1:50:04] the Holy Ghost had not stopped to come
[1:50:06] down since that day.
[1:50:09] Has stopped coming down since that day.
[1:50:10] Why? Why?
[1:50:15] nowhere
[1:50:18] because God had dispersed himself in his
[1:50:20] church in his fullness.
[1:50:23] He was in man.
[1:50:26] That's why
[1:50:29] act nine, if I'm not mistaken,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Cornelius, a man was praying to God,
[1:50:38] a holy man.
[1:50:40] He was praying for heaven
[1:50:44] so he may receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:48] so his house may have eternal life.
[1:50:53] God had answered.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; God did not come down in the house. He
[1:50:58] said, "There's a certain Peter." That's
[1:51:01] someone
[1:51:03] send Peter. Send people to Peter.
[1:51:09] When they sent Peter to Peter,
[1:51:12] Peter came down to his house.
[1:51:15] He started to speak.
[1:51:18] While y'all are here, y'all have
[1:51:20] problems.
[1:51:23] And the sound is is sounding. The word
[1:51:25] of God is being preached.
[1:51:28] The gospel is being proclaimed,
[1:51:32] but you're not noticing.
[1:51:34] You're not catching your situation.
[1:51:38] So, the season can take care of it.
[1:51:42] The season can resolve it.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] But Cornelius and his house and
[1:51:49] everything that he had invited
[1:51:52] just by hearing the gospel, the word
[1:51:54] that Peter was speaking,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost had came down in the
[1:52:00] house of Cornelius
[1:52:02] who brought down the Holy Ghost. It was
[1:52:05] a man
[1:52:07] that was ordained that was chosen. A man
[1:52:10] that had the key that Jesus had said,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; "What you will bind here on earth,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; heaven shall also bind,
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; your prayers that you're praying to
[1:52:24] nine."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You got to change the your way of
[1:52:27] praying. Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; You got to change your style of praying.
[1:52:32] Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; It's good to pray.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; God will answer you.
[1:52:40] But when God will send you a man,
[1:52:44] may when God will send the season,
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; will you be capable of seasoning the
[1:52:49] season
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; so you can ordain? So you can ask for
[1:52:53] what you're in need of.
[1:52:56] Cornelius had prayed and Peter had came.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost had came down over
[1:53:03] there. Why? Because the Holy Ghost
[1:53:07] had already left heaven.
[1:53:10] Mean what Cornelius was looking how had
[1:53:13] already left heaven and was already
[1:53:16] dwelling in the in the um body of of of
[1:53:19] human.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; It was in man. It was dwelling in man.
[1:53:24] Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; The same thing also
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:32] the unique Ethiopian
[1:53:35] He was reading the Bible.
[1:53:37] He was reading the uh the scribe, the
[1:53:39] scrolls and the scriptures. The same way
[1:53:42] you're reading the scriptures, the
[1:53:43] message
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; will be different than the way brother
[1:53:47] Steven is reading the scripture.
[1:53:50] Just how he was reading,
[1:53:52] God has sent Philillip.
[1:53:56] He said, "Go over there. There is
[1:53:58] someone
[1:54:00] who does not understand the scripture
[1:54:03] and what he is in need of you already
[1:54:06] have it. Go over there and give it to
[1:54:08] him. That's how Philip went over there
[1:54:12] and he asked the question what you're
[1:54:14] reading. Do you understand it? And then
[1:54:18] he explained it. And the man decided
[1:54:22] there's a time for decision. God put
[1:54:25] people always in places of decision. So
[1:54:28] you can take a decision.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Man took a decision to repent. He
[1:54:33] saidapt,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; take the baptism
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; You want another example?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; There was a man.
[1:54:46] He was not in the Bible.
[1:54:48] His name was William Ron Brandon.
[1:54:51] There was an anti anti
[1:54:54] who was looking for the salvation of her
[1:54:56] children. But God who had heard from
[1:54:58] heaven, who left heaven, came down and
[1:55:02] covered himself with with badger skin, a
[1:55:05] fat skin of man, and said, "What do you
[1:55:09] want? In a minute, I will give it onto
[1:55:11] you." And he said, "I want the salvation
[1:55:14] of my children." And in that instant,
[1:55:16] the salvation, you see what Antarai was
[1:55:19] looking for
[1:55:21] had left heaven and was already dwelling
[1:55:24] in the in the man of God.
[1:55:27] What you're looking for this evening
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; is in man.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Only if you could believe.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; God had told him.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; If you bring
[1:55:41] if you bring men to believe
[1:55:44] nobody will resist even cancer,
[1:55:48] nothing will resist
[1:55:51] this evening.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know your condition.
[1:55:56] There's a lot of things
[1:55:58] I haven't even read the prophet.
[1:56:01] I don't even know where to begin.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I'll read a prophet.
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:23] the things that are to be
[1:56:32] 1965 December the 5th
[1:56:36] paragraph 45 I'm going down I'm reading
[1:56:40] there's something
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; may God be worshiped
[1:56:50] A man is an agent of God. You know that
[1:56:55] particularity.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Every man of God has his particularity.
[1:57:00] Why?
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Because he is a god of variety.
[1:57:04] You will notice that
[1:57:08] Joshua,
[1:57:09] he was the one who stopped the sun.
[1:57:14] He
[1:57:15] he was capable
[1:57:18] to make the walls of Jericho crumble.
[1:57:22] But it was to Moses alone
[1:57:25] to make the cloud be shown.
[1:57:29] Why? Because he's a god of variety.
[1:57:33] Whenever a man of God is coming up here,
[1:57:36] you have to be you have to pay very
[1:57:38] close attention to obtain.
[1:57:40] The prophet of God says this.
[1:57:43] I believe that God is a God of variety.
[1:57:46] The world proves that.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He's got big mountains and little
[1:57:53] mountains.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; He's got plains and and he's got desert.
[1:58:00] He's got different things because he
[1:58:03] made it the way he wanted it. And he
[1:58:06] made the season, summer, winter, spring
[1:58:10] and autumn. He made it season.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; It shows he's a god of variety.
[1:58:19] That's right.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; It shows that he's the God of variety.
[1:58:29] He made you in a variety.
[1:58:32] Amen.
[1:58:34] Some men are real blusterous
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; and some are real dogmatic
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; and others are fine and others are kind
[1:58:44] and you just find all different kinds of
[1:58:46] people and in his kingdom.
[1:58:50] See
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Look at St. Peter
[1:58:57] and judge him by Andrew. See
[1:59:04] and judge him by Andrew.
[1:59:07] See,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; let's speak a little about Andrew.
[1:59:11] Andrew,
[1:59:13] I said in the in the life, you will
[1:59:16] always need
[1:59:19] a post for your
[1:59:22] for your promotion. You need connection.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe for your marriage,
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; you need a connection. You need an eleer
[1:59:32] for your healing.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; You need a man of God
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; for everything that you're in need of in
[1:59:41] your life for your salvation.
[1:59:44] You're in need of the servant of God as
[1:59:47] well. Amen.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Andrew probably brought Peter to Jesus
[1:59:55] and Andrew wasn't known. But look, was
[1:59:58] not popular. But look at the works of
[2:00:00] Peter.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Look at what Peter did, the miracles.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; But they're not speaking about what
[2:00:08] Andrew did.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; There are people that God put as a post.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:26] He's a God of variety.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Look at St. Peter and judge him by
[2:00:37] Andrew. See,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Andrew,
[2:00:42] Andrew is that prayer warrior. Just
[2:00:45] stayed on his knees all the time.
[2:00:50] And the Apostle Peter was one of those
[2:00:54] fire brand that preached
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; and so forth.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Andrew was probably behind here.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Praying. Praying.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, support a pastor. Support a pastor.
[2:01:08] Support your servant. Support your
[2:01:11] servant.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; But when the man of God goes,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; souls are saved. Amen.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; The same
[2:01:23] the same
[2:01:25] the same reward we also remember for
[2:01:27] that for the those that were on their
[2:01:29] knees
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; and so forth
[2:01:34] and Paul was more scholarly
[2:01:38] more a prophet
[2:01:42] something and set back
[2:01:45] and set back
[2:01:48] And see, Moses
[2:01:51] wrote the first four books of the old
[2:01:55] which
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; he wrote the Old Testament.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; The rest,
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; the rest of it was the laws and kings
[2:02:06] and so on and so forth.
[2:02:09] and what someone and what someone wrote
[2:02:12] of the prophets.
[2:02:16] But Moses wrote the law,
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; the first four books of the Bible,
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Genesis, Exodus,
[2:02:24] Leviticus, and Deuteronomy.
[2:02:28] And Paul wrote the New Testament.
[2:02:31] That's true. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John
[2:02:34] wrote the Acts
[2:02:37] of what taking place. And so Paul
[2:02:41] separated the law and grace.
[2:02:44] Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Because I was speaking about God of
[2:02:48] variety. Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:52] He is the God of variety. You have to be
[2:02:54] very You have to pay very close
[2:02:56] attention.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I took your time.
[2:03:02] We will drop.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; We'll drop. Don't worry.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; We'll say a little something.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; We're in the season.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:18] And when the season comes,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; you have to take a decision. Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; You should not look at your condition.
[2:03:30] Don't look at your neighbor.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; There's a woman that was yelling and
[2:03:35] screaming in the Bible. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:40] There were people stopping her,
[2:03:42] disciples trying to stop her, but
[2:03:44] because she knew I am in the face of the
[2:03:46] season, my my situation needs the
[2:03:52] master.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] She didn't listen to everybody else
[2:03:58] trying to stop her.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; In fact, she even screamed louder
[2:04:03] to obtain what he needed.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Now, the season,
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; it's a time of blessing. It's a time of
[2:04:14] deliverance. It's a time of testing.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; It's a time for testing.
[2:04:22] It doesn't matter
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; whatsoever for God to bless you,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; you will go through a test.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; The three Hebrews
[2:04:36] so they can see their God. They went
[2:04:38] through the burning furnace
[2:04:42] and they met their Lord.
[2:04:45] They met their God.
[2:04:47] They were not disappointed.
[2:04:50] It doesn't matter the situation. We will
[2:04:53] stand with the word of God. We will
[2:04:56] apply the word of God.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; The season doesn't choose the place so
[2:05:02] it can operate like this evening. I will
[2:05:05] tell you the season does not choose the
[2:05:08] place. I I don't know your condition.
[2:05:11] Maybe they have declared that you cannot
[2:05:14] receive.
[2:05:16] Maybe you have cancer that your
[2:05:19] situation could not work. Maybe your
[2:05:22] business is not working.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe they had buried your documents.
[2:05:29] Maybe you put your document somewhere.
[2:05:32] But I want to show you that the season
[2:05:35] that the season does not concern itself
[2:05:38] with the place.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; In the book of Matthew chapter 9
[2:05:44] verse 18
[2:05:47] 23-2
[2:05:51] there was a resurrection of the daughter
[2:05:53] of Jarius.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; This resurrection was in the house.
[2:05:58] If your problem is in the house,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; the season can resolve it. Amen.
[2:06:06] Jesus had resolved that in the house.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:13] Now in the book of Luke 7 verse
[2:06:18] 11 to 17, there was a resurrection.
[2:06:24] There was a a resurrection.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; There was a feast of the resurrection.
[2:06:31] There was a
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; there was a resurrection of the widow
[2:06:34] son.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; There was a story in Luke 9,
[2:06:44] Luke 11. Their son was already dead. The
[2:06:47] child was already dead
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; and they were bringing him to the
[2:06:51] cemetery.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:54] I'm not sure
[2:06:56] the state of your situation where it's
[2:06:59] going.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know the level of your situation
[2:07:05] or how bad it is.
[2:07:08] I don't know how bad your situation is.
[2:07:12] But this child was in a carcass.
[2:07:15] It was in a coffin
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; and they were going to bury him.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; They were going to bury him.
[2:07:24] But because the season was there,
[2:07:26] wherever the sun is, there is fruits.
[2:07:29] Amen.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; He stopped the coffin. He stopped the
[2:07:34] mark and he resurrected his son
[2:07:38] of the of the widow.
[2:07:41] Jesus is capable this evening
[2:07:44] for this word that you're hearing
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; so he may resurrect.
[2:07:49] Maybe it doesn't matter the relationship
[2:07:52] that was destroyed, that was messed up,
[2:07:54] your reputation,
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; God is capable this evening.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; God is capable in this moment, this
[2:08:02] minute
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; and in this season
[2:08:08] in John 11 verse.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's the story of Lazarus.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] Lazarus when he was sick,
[2:08:22] they called Jesus and Jesus didn't come
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; and Lazarus died and they buried him
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; in the in the cemetery.
[2:08:35] I don't know where they buried your
[2:08:37] situation over here. Lazarus, there was
[2:08:40] no hope.
[2:08:42] um
[2:08:44] his sister didn't have hope like your
[2:08:47] situation like the doctor probably
[2:08:48] declared maybe you're without hope
[2:08:53] but let me tell you that this season is
[2:08:55] capable of resurrection when Jesus came
[2:08:59] in the cemetery in the tomb he
[2:09:02] resurrected Lazarus your situation may
[2:09:05] be
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; your situation may be restored right now
[2:09:10] your business, your affairs may be
[2:09:13] restored right now only if you could
[2:09:16] believe.
[2:09:17] The musician can approach, the musician
[2:09:19] can come forward. may no matter your
[2:09:21] condition. If you could only believe,
[2:09:25] I just came from showing you
[2:09:28] 34 different cases
[2:09:31] in three different places
[2:09:34] that Jesus who is your season that he
[2:09:37] had operated.
[2:09:39] He is the same tonight to operate in
[2:09:42] your season.
[2:09:44] If your situation is in the house, he
[2:09:47] will do something.
[2:09:49] If it's already, it's already if your
[2:09:52] situation is already on its way to be
[2:09:53] buried, he's capable. If they already
[2:09:56] put it in a in a coffin, he's capable.
[2:10:01] I mean, I don't know which domain. I
[2:10:03] don't know. You're the only person who
[2:10:05] know the circumstance.
[2:10:08] the domain of what's not working in your
[2:10:09] mind
[2:10:11] that's not working in your life
[2:10:14] that's not working in your health
[2:10:17] in your works in your business in your
[2:10:19] relation
[2:10:21] I'm saying this evening Jesus this
[2:10:23] evening he's capable pastor you can come
[2:10:26] forward Jesus is cap is capable this
[2:10:28] evening he's capable this evening
[2:10:32] wherever the the sun is
[2:10:35] where the fruits
[2:10:37] It doesn't matter your condition. If you
[2:10:39] could stand, if you could rise, if you
[2:10:42] could rise, Jesus is capable this
[2:10:44] evening.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; He is capable this evening
[2:10:48] to honor your faith. He's capable this
[2:10:51] evening. If you could only believe. If
[2:10:54] you could only believe. If you could
[2:10:57] only believe
[2:10:59] in the people that God chose the to the
[2:11:02] people that God sent. One day Anna had a
[2:11:06] situation in her relationship, the
[2:11:09] situation in her house and a situation
[2:11:11] in her family.
[2:11:13] She had prayed. She had prayed. She had
[2:11:16] prayed.
[2:11:19] When the man of God was there,
[2:11:22] when the man of God took the situation,
[2:11:23] when the man of God had pro um announced
[2:11:26] the word,
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; the demand
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; of and of Hannah
[2:11:32] was resolved in God, was answered in God
[2:11:35] and he had the son of the prophet
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; and he had Samuel and he had Samuel. The
[2:11:42] same thing maybe you found yourself in
[2:11:43] this exact situation. God is capable.
[2:11:46] God is capable
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; this evening. May God bless you.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:11:56] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:12:00] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus is your season.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; not a person. Jesus is your season.
[2:12:17] Amen. And I love the last illustration.
[2:12:20] It summarize everything for us. Three
[2:12:23] resurrection in three different places.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; The first one in the house because he's
[2:12:29] the season. He brought resurrection.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; The second one was not in the house
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; because in the house the corpse is still
[2:12:37] there. They must still think about maybe
[2:12:39] calling a preacher and bringing the
[2:12:41] preacher and maybe the preacher can come
[2:12:43] and lay hand. Now the situation change.
[2:12:46] It's a little bit more uh more more
[2:12:49] advanced
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; where they took the body and they put it
[2:12:51] in a coffin and they close everything
[2:12:53] and the funeral home already put all
[2:12:56] type of medication, all type of stuff.
[2:12:59] So it's pretty much gone. And now
[2:13:01] there's still a little hope. Maybe a
[2:13:03] preacher can stop the the funeral
[2:13:06] service and then come and pray over it.
[2:13:09] And then the season came
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; and brought the resurrection. Now the
[2:13:13] third one was even far beyond that.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where they went and bury and close
[2:13:19] everything.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, no no no no coming back.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Because when they spoke to Martyr,
[2:13:27] Martha was waiting for the general
[2:13:29] resurrection. In other words, all hope
[2:13:32] were completely gone. But when the
[2:13:34] season came, the season removed
[2:13:37] everything and brought up again Lazarus.
[2:13:39] In other word, there is no as long these
[2:13:43] are dead people.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; You are not dead, you alive. And don't
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; if God can resolve problem for people
[2:13:54] that are already dead.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; What about you who still have the breath
[2:14:00] of life?
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how advanced your
[2:14:05] case is.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Your case could be in the house. It
[2:14:09] could be at a certain intersection
[2:14:11] already where they taking you to the
[2:14:13] cemetery or it's already been buried. It
[2:14:17] doesn't matter where it is. What's
[2:14:19] matter is to find the season
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; and the season is Jesus Christ. When you
[2:14:25] bring him in, he have everything that
[2:14:27] you need.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Never let the season pass.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; God doesn't send his word and then his
[2:14:35] word will return to him void. That's
[2:14:38] absolutely impossible. Amen. God is
[2:14:41] speaking. Touch the master. And if you
[2:14:45] do touch the master, you will receive
[2:14:47] what you need. I know usually we are on
[2:14:49] a hurry and we're trying to go home, but
[2:14:53] God already spoke. Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; You know yourself.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; You know your situation. You know how
[2:15:01] far you are, where you are advanced,
[2:15:03] whether you need a salvation, whether
[2:15:05] you need a healing or whether something
[2:15:08] trouble you throughout the day. They
[2:15:10] have declared to you tonight that the
[2:15:12] season is Jesus Christ. Invite that
[2:15:15] season and then tell him where the
[2:15:18] problem is. He knows where the problem
[2:15:21] is, but he want you to tell him to
[2:15:23] invite him. Amen. Take a few minutes as
[2:15:26] they play softly. Forget about who's
[2:15:29] beside you or who's going to listen to
[2:15:31] what you're saying. Amen. We cannot be
[2:15:35] in the presence of the Lord and try to
[2:15:36] rush out. You rush out, you meet that
[2:15:39] same devil waiting for you. Amen. Make
[2:15:43] sure you can talk to your Caesar. You
[2:15:46] want to kneel, you can kneel. You want
[2:15:47] to stand, you can stand. But let's take
[2:15:50] few minute.
[2:15:52] You know your problem where it is.
[2:15:54] Whether it's in the home, whether it's
[2:15:57] on the road, whether it's already
[2:15:59] buried, whether you work your mind up
[2:16:02] like Peter and you did all that you can
[2:16:05] do all night and were was not able to
[2:16:09] find anything.
[2:16:11] I don't know where your situation is.
[2:16:14] You know your need. The season is the
[2:16:18] word. The season is Jesus Christ.
[2:16:23] Call the season and tell him where you
[2:16:26] need him.
[2:16:28] Open your heart. Open your house. Open
[2:16:32] your business.
[2:16:34] You might be afraid to talk to somebody.
[2:16:37] You might be afraid or ashamed to talk
[2:16:39] to somebody, but never be ashamed to
[2:16:42] talk to the one that knows you better
[2:16:44] than yourself. So, open your mouth and
[2:16:47] talk to him. Speak to him.
[2:16:51] Focus on him because he's the season.
[2:16:55] Seize this opportunity tonight that you
[2:16:58] don't leave this service the same way
[2:17:01] you came in tonight.
[2:17:04] He is the season.
[2:17:06] Jesus is the season. Wherever he is, he
[2:17:11] knows what it is. If your spiritual life
[2:17:14] doesn't bear fruit that are meat for the
[2:17:18] gospel,
[2:17:20] he's still the one.
[2:17:23] He's divine that you can get connected
[2:17:26] to and you can bear fruit and the father
[2:17:29] will help you bear more fruit. If it's a
[2:17:33] business, take the business to him.
[2:17:37] Like the little child, take whatever you
[2:17:40] have in your hand to him.
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:44] Let him be your season.
[2:17:49] Thank you Lord.
[2:17:55] Heavenly Father,
[2:17:58] Lord, we are approaching you humbly
[2:18:00] tonight.
[2:18:01] Father, thanking you for your grace, for
[2:18:04] your love, for your mercy, and for
[2:18:07] everything you have been doing for us.
[2:18:10] Lord, you spoke to us tonight about you
[2:18:14] being our season, the season of our
[2:18:17] life, the season of this church, the
[2:18:21] season of our business, the season of
[2:18:24] our marriages, the season of our health,
[2:18:27] the season of eternal life, the season
[2:18:30] of everything that concern us. Lord,
[2:18:33] Father, why are we living in this
[2:18:35] journey preparing for your coming? Lord,
[2:18:39] your children are lifting up their
[2:18:41] voices and they are speaking to you. You
[2:18:44] who is the master of everything and you
[2:18:48] who knows, Lord, and the solution to
[2:18:50] every single problem, Lord. Father,
[2:18:53] these are not words that man can just
[2:18:56] hear and go, but these are words of
[2:18:59] eternal life. Word that have brought
[2:19:02] result that have changed life, that have
[2:19:05] transformed people, that brought the
[2:19:07] dead back to life, that gave children to
[2:19:10] those that needed that open up ways
[2:19:12] where people thought that there were no
[2:19:14] ways that split the Red Sea, split the
[2:19:17] Jordan, brought mana down, Lord Father,
[2:19:20] from heaven. Lord, Father, we heard the
[2:19:23] word of eternal life. And we pray
[2:19:25] tonight, Lord Jesus, as your presence is
[2:19:28] here for both the visible and invisible
[2:19:31] audience and me standing here as a
[2:19:33] shepherd. I'm praying, Lord, Father,
[2:19:36] that you meet each one of us tonight.
[2:19:39] Because wherever you are, there is a
[2:19:41] season, Lord. Lord, bring a season to
[2:19:45] the body that are sick. Bring a season
[2:19:47] to the marriages that are needed. Bring
[2:19:50] a season to those that are struggling in
[2:19:53] their spiritual work. Lord, bring a
[2:19:55] season to those that are struggling in
[2:19:58] their finances, in their businesses.
[2:20:00] Bring season, Lord, Father, to this
[2:20:03] church. Bring season to your people.
[2:20:05] Bring season to the children in school.
[2:20:08] Bring season, Lord Father, to the young
[2:20:10] adult. Bring season to the musician, to
[2:20:13] the teacher, to Lord Father, those that
[2:20:16] are laboring for your kingdom. Bring
[2:20:18] season, Lord, Father, to every single
[2:20:21] home of spoken word tabernacle. Lord,
[2:20:24] bring season Lord to everything that you
[2:20:27] have given us under this sun. Lord,
[2:20:29] whether it be our home, whether it be
[2:20:31] our car, whether it be our clothing,
[2:20:34] everything, Lord, Father, that belong or
[2:20:37] that is connected to us. Father, Lord,
[2:20:39] may you bring a season. May you bring an
[2:20:42] awareness in our life, Lord, so that we
[2:20:44] can be able to discern the connection
[2:20:47] that you're bringing in our life, Lord.
[2:20:49] Father, when Abraham saw the visitation
[2:20:51] of three men, he recognizes your
[2:20:53] presence, Lord. Even Lord who was down
[2:20:56] in Sodom in a backslided condition, he
[2:20:59] was able to recognize two angel. Father,
[2:21:02] Lord Jesus Christ, may you open up our
[2:21:04] spiritual discernment, Lord, so that we
[2:21:07] can be able to Lord, Father, catch our
[2:21:11] opportunity. Seize our opportunity,
[2:21:14] catch, Lord, Father, and never let Lord
[2:21:16] Father, our blessing pass by without us,
[2:21:19] Lord, Father, being able to receive that
[2:21:22] which you send on our ways, Lord.
[2:21:24] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you being the
[2:21:26] season. Touch Lord the project Lord of
[2:21:29] this church. Touch the finances of this
[2:21:31] church. Lord, touch Lord, Father, our
[2:21:34] home, Lord, fill with the Holy Spirit,
[2:21:36] Lord. Deliver those, Lord, Father, that
[2:21:39] are Lord, struggling, that are Lord,
[2:21:41] Father, ering from the way, Lord.
[2:21:43] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:21:46] Christ, if somebody doesn't know you
[2:21:48] tonight, Lord, may they meet you tonight
[2:21:51] as their season, Lord, to change their
[2:21:53] life, to bring salvation to their life,
[2:21:56] to deliver them from the power of
[2:21:58] darkness, Lord, so that Lord, Father,
[2:22:01] you can bring the eternal life in their
[2:22:03] body, in their soul, in their spirit.
