[44:15] if you go slow you stop the drum and you
[44:18] stopped it and tell them to go in the
[44:20] same Rhythm all right so no
[44:24] faster than that no slower than that but
[44:26] you just want to keep it that way
[44:28] amen so it warmed the brother
[44:31] and all the Dominion all the Thrones all
[44:35] the principalities
[44:38] and all of them begin to just run away
[44:42] glory to God my God unbelievable if you
[44:47] were City just shake the devil off of
[44:49] you completely until you feel like I'm
[44:51] ready to fight
[44:54] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God man I
[44:57] feel so good
[44:59] oh my God oh my God especially when the
[45:02] sermon brother John is not here when his
[45:04] sermon goes very good to the end this is
[45:07] when we dance for the Lord
[45:09] if you don't want to dance no problem I
[45:11] will dance for them Amen Let the Holy
[45:15] Spirit strike you you will you will
[45:16] handle yourself
[45:18] Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen
[45:23] I was notified that all the sermon
[45:26] except one since we started the hotel
[45:30] till now it's now uh titled correctly on
[45:34] YouTube so if you go you won't see King
[45:37] a hazardous entry for you see King
[45:39] ahazarus part one and he put the theme
[45:43] just like we did for the four phases of
[45:45] Ruth then he says the son of man you'll
[45:47] see just say king of Hazards then he
[45:49] tells you what was dealt on that day so
[45:52] you will see all of them line up so if
[45:55] you want to reference to maybe Nell or I
[45:58] hear or the four types of love that we
[46:00] went through you will see it right away
[46:02] you can click and just go ahead so
[46:04] somebody did a great job to begin from
[46:07] the back there all the way brother Caleb
[46:10] did it foreign
[46:16] so we thank God for everything indeed
[46:18] all of them except the one because one
[46:20] of them the preacher didn't give the
[46:21] title so maybe we can come up with a
[46:24] title or just leave it alone that way
[46:25] amen it's good to hear Brother take my
[46:28] show back there we thank God that he's
[46:30] here tonight your fight
[46:34] amen
[46:36] glory to God you continue to stay in
[46:39] prayer the devil is fighting everywhere
[46:42] left and right people trying to miss
[46:44] accident this in the accident this one
[46:46] going on this one going on but through
[46:49] it all we are in the army of the Lord if
[46:53] we want to die in the Army because the
[46:56] Army will be resurrected and his army is
[46:59] the brother that's why in Revelation 19
[47:01] he come with his army which are the
[47:04] Saint in Christ Jesus
[47:06] so let me be buried in Christ because I
[47:10] know we can be resurrected from there
[47:12] amen glory to God am I probably remind
[47:16] you this if I forgot forgive me but make
[47:19] sure you sleep good
[47:21] on Saturday okay make sure you're going
[47:25] back down time because we're gonna dive
[47:27] into
[47:28] territory that probably you have not got
[47:32] into it yet okay the boss opened up
[47:35] certain things I never seen it I've seen
[47:38] brother brand I'm saying something here
[47:39] and there and for years never understood
[47:42] why brother Branham say that
[47:44] and we called it but still don't
[47:47] understand how it was coming up but now
[47:50] when he opened up and see how everything
[47:52] line up together it's amazing how the
[47:55] scripture has hidden
[47:57] this message I don't know what to do
[48:00] amen amen
[48:03] amen so I pray God that I have enough
[48:05] time to dive into it and you'll see how
[48:08] the scripture hides things and when you
[48:10] open up you will be like my goodness
[48:13] this was written right here and we miss
[48:16] it for years so make sure you sleep well
[48:19] okay and you come refresh
[48:22] if you're struggling I tell sister
[48:24] Charlene to sing and then Shake
[48:26] everything up and then you're ready for
[48:29] the word amen
[48:31] and you pray for me
[48:33] because the devil doesn't want me to
[48:34] even touch the bible
[48:37] okay just me touching the Bible when I
[48:39] begin to read one two three four verses
[48:41] it's something going on
[48:44] amen but I still continue and I finish
[48:47] my verses
[48:48] amen if I begin to just meditate a

[55:33] special my such a blessing amen I tell
[55:36] you I I I'm just one I believe you can

[55:47] worshiping I I wonder what we're doing
[55:49] but I tell you I I enjoy coming to
[55:52] church I enjoy worshiping God and
[55:55] serving God Amen it's the joy of our
[55:58] heart and so God bless you uh here in
[56:01] Matthew 10 and 40 the Bible
[56:03] would read this he that receiveth you
[56:06] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[56:09] receiveth him that sent me and he that
[56:11] receiveth the prophet and the name for
[56:14] Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[56:16] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[56:19] in the name of a righteous man shalt
[56:22] receive a righteous man's reward if you
[56:25] if you flip over a couple chapters in
[56:27] Matthew the 18th chapter uh we'll just
[56:30] build a little foundation with that text
[56:32] we'll we'll come back to it as we cover
[56:35] a couple of things here
[56:38] amen Matthew the 18th chapter the third
[56:40] verse the Bible would read this and
[56:44] said verily I say unto you except you be
[56:46] converted and become as little children
[56:50] amen now this is Messiah teaching here
[56:52] and and to think it's a deep thought
[56:55] it's not a deep thought but it's so
[56:57] simple amen that nobody else could could
[57:00] handle his teaching became as little
[57:03] children you should not enter into the
[57:06] kingdom of heaven so unless you're like
[57:08] a child you shall not enter into the
[57:11] kingdom of heaven and this is where I
[57:13] want to draw your focus whosoever there
[57:15] are for shall humble himself as this
[57:18] little child the same as greatest in the
[57:21] kingdom of God or in the Kingdom of
[57:23] Heaven A man we ask that God will bless
[57:25] his word is you can be seated and for a
[57:28] few minutes of time we won't hold you
[57:29] very long just a simple thought the
[57:31] Lord's laid Upon Our Hearts I want to
[57:33] speak to you on humbling ourselves to
[57:35] the word amen humbling ourselves to the
[57:39] word I I believe that that God God loves
[57:42] humility amen God the very God that we
[57:45] serve he is he's the humble of humblest
[57:49] Amen there's there's none other uh
[57:51] that's as uh as far as humility that is
[57:54] greater than our God Amen brother random
[57:56] in many places throughout the message he
[57:58] would teach us that the great Elohim
[58:01] himself came in a body of Flesh and
[58:03] washed washed the feet of his creation
[58:06] so if there's anybody that knows about
[58:07] being humble it's God Amen and I believe
[58:10] that God loves humility we know one of
[58:14] the greatest traits of a true Christian
[58:16] carries would be humility and you know
[58:19] as simple as humility is I believe it
[58:22] that it's one of the uh one of the
[58:24] rarest things to find in the age that
[58:26] you and I live in today amen I believe
[58:29] that the devil the devil is always
[58:32] pressuring uh people to get puffed up in
[58:35] their mind and the devil's always
[58:37] pressuring people to Amen to make
[58:40] yourself more than you are to uh to have
[58:43] a big head if you will amen it's the God
[58:45] of this evil age that is trying to put a
[58:48] pressure uh to make people be more than
[58:50] what they really are but but tonight
[58:52] let's just be what we are amen let's
[58:54] simply just be what we are amen and I
[58:57] want you to notice it's the devil's job
[58:59] to to make us more than we are amen he's
[59:02] always out to Puff you up and to think
[59:05] you're the high and mighty one to think
[59:07] you're the great person and and we know
[59:09] that God resists the proud person is
[59:11] that right but he gives Grace unto the
[59:13] humble God Amen God ain't paying
[59:16] attention to the person making the most
[59:17] noise in the church now we all love
[59:20] noise do we not amen but that's not how
[59:22] you get God's attention you want God's
[59:24] attention amen see how humble that you
[59:27] can get now now brother random here in
[59:30] demonology and religious realm he would
[59:32] say now a humble submitted heart in the
[59:35] Simplicity is what brings you to God he
[59:38] said well that's true a humble heart God
[59:40] loves now no matter you don't know your
[59:42] ABCs don't make any difference just a
[59:45] humble heart amen that God dwells in God
[59:48] dwells in a humble heart now I don't
[59:50] know about you but but I I would rather
[59:52] not know any amen any of the deep things
[59:55] of God any of the uh the mysteries of
[59:57] God and amen I would rather not know any
[1:00:00] of that if I couldn't remain humble and
[1:00:03] know the word of God I I just want to
[1:00:05] say this amen amen the more the word of
[1:00:08] God you get it don't make you greater
[1:00:09] amen it makes you lower it makes you
[1:00:12] more humble amen true Revelation from
[1:00:15] God Don't Make You greater amen it makes
[1:00:17] you lesser it makes you realize how
[1:00:19] great God is amen and it causes a
[1:00:22] humility
[1:00:24] hey man it don't matter how much you
[1:00:26] know hey man just keep a humble heart
[1:00:28] and the message humble thyself you just
[1:00:30] bear with me as we build a little
[1:00:32] something in this Brethren would speak
[1:00:34] on uh humility and you you that's very
[1:00:37] familiar with the message you know uh as
[1:00:39] well as I do throughout the whole
[1:00:41] message you you find a theme of humility
[1:00:43] you you find amazing display in the
[1:00:46] ministry of our Prophet you find
[1:00:48] humility uh like none other and and
[1:00:50] we'll get to that here amen but brother
[1:00:53] Adam in the message humble thyself he
[1:00:54] says you know people want power but they
[1:00:57] really don't know what power is he said
[1:00:59] see they really don't know what goes
[1:01:02] with it the Way Up Is Down always if you
[1:01:05] want Power
[1:01:07] if you want Power see how humble you can
[1:01:11] get how many wants power to overcome the
[1:01:14] devil how many wants powered overcome
[1:01:16] loud to see you amen see how humble you
[1:01:19] can get that that's your access to power
[1:01:22] see how little you can become I must see
[1:01:25] how small you can become amen and that's
[1:01:28] where your power is he says just get
[1:01:30] away from worldly thinking and humble
[1:01:32] yourself before God and then you've got
[1:01:35] more power than the man that runs all
[1:01:37] over the building and makes a big bunch
[1:01:40] of noise amen other prophets not against
[1:01:42] noise no one being amen but you got more
[1:01:45] power when you can humble yourself amen
[1:01:49] listen friends God is looking for a
[1:01:50] humble church is that right he's looking
[1:01:53] for a humble people that will that will
[1:01:55] humble themselves before God

[1:02:18] power of God in it that's right that's
[1:02:21] the thing that takes it humility and
[1:02:24] humbling ourselves before God and
[1:02:27] letting God work through us he said
[1:02:29] preacher we want the power of God in
[1:02:31] this church we want the favor of God in
[1:02:33] this church I say it's time we humble
[1:02:36] ourselves and say God we ain't nothing
[1:02:39] and you're everything amen we want the
[1:02:41] favor of God to bless us amen let's get
[1:02:44] real sweet before god let's get real
[1:02:47] humble before God and say God without
[1:02:49] you in our midst we're nothing without
[1:02:51] you in this church it's nothing more
[1:02:53] than a lodge without your anointing we
[1:02:56] can't preach without your anointing we
[1:02:58] can't not saying where without you doing
[1:03:00] it it ain't nothing it's just a form of
[1:03:03] godliness
[1:03:05] Hallelujah
[1:03:07] amen you want God's favor see how humble
[1:03:10] you can get amen now now coming into
[1:03:13] this text here by the way and I'm in
[1:03:16] questions and answers he talks about
[1:03:17] that in Matthew 10. uh he has the
[1:03:21] question there well what's that prophets
[1:03:22] or word somebody gives brother random a
[1:03:24] question I want to know that Prophet is
[1:03:26] a war and mother ma'am said well it's
[1:03:28] whosoever receives a prophet in the name
[1:03:30] of the Prophet receives a prophet's
[1:03:32] reward
[1:03:34] amen romance speaks on that reward he
[1:03:36] says that's your reward he's your friend
[1:03:39] he said like the shunamite woman and it
[1:03:42] might come in handy sometimes amen I
[1:03:44] tell you it might come in handy
[1:03:46] believing a prophet it might come in
[1:03:48] handy but even what the prophet taught
[1:03:50] it Hallelujah
[1:03:52] amen and and to build a little uh
[1:03:55] Foundation be speaking on humbling
[1:03:57] ourselves to the word but the way I
[1:03:59] mention is the shunamite woman there but
[1:04:01] I I just want to draw your focus here
[1:04:03] for a moment on that widow woman that
[1:04:06] was there in First Kings very familiar
[1:04:08] uh text and reading in this but it's one
[1:04:12] of the most powerful stories that would
[1:04:14] link to the message of the hour but but
[1:04:16] you find that widow woman that Elijah
[1:04:18] the prophet how how she received him you
[1:04:21] you write it down there in First Kings
[1:04:23] 17 and 9. God tells him arise and go to
[1:04:26] Zarephath which belongs to Zion and
[1:04:28] dwell there I've commanded a widow woman
[1:04:30] there to sustain thee Heroes and went to
[1:04:33] the place where God told them to there
[1:04:35] and when he came to the gate of the city
[1:04:37] behold the widow woman was was there
[1:04:40] Gathering of sticks and he called the
[1:04:42] Earth and said fetch me I pray thee a
[1:04:45] little water in a vessel that I may
[1:04:48] drink and she was going to fetch it and
[1:04:50] he called to her and said bring me I
[1:04:52] pray a a morsel of bread in thy hands so
[1:04:56] so I want you to notice there's a woman
[1:04:58] here she's receiving a word from God's
[1:05:01] Prophet is that right she's receiving a
[1:05:04] word to do something from a prophet
[1:05:08] Amen to do something a prophet's telling
[1:05:10] her this he says uh to bring me I pray
[1:05:13] thee most of the bread and thy hand
[1:05:15] notice her response as she said as the
[1:05:18] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[1:05:20] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[1:05:22] little oil in a cruise and behold I'm
[1:05:25] gathering two sticks and I may go in and
[1:05:27] dress it for me and my son and we're
[1:05:30] going to eat and we're going to die in
[1:05:31] simple words and Elijah's said unto her
[1:05:34] fear not go and do as thou has said but
[1:05:37] notice this this is now amen he's
[1:05:40] telling her to do something that's not
[1:05:42] even reasonable he he's telling her to
[1:05:44] do something that the logical person
[1:05:46] they would not do and they would not
[1:05:48] obey if amen now now just be a human for
[1:05:51] a moment if you can but imagine this is
[1:05:54] your last meal you're going to eat and
[1:05:56] you're gonna eat it and you're gonna die
[1:05:58] and here comes a man and tells you no uh
[1:06:01] you you're gonna make a cake I'm asking
[1:06:03] you make me a cake and give it to me
[1:06:05] first now anybody in their right mind
[1:06:08] would not do that but I want you to
[1:06:10] notice the heart of this woman Elijah
[1:06:13] said unto her fear not go and do as thou
[1:06:16] has said and make me thereof a little
[1:06:18] cake first bring it to me and after make
[1:06:21] for thee and for thy son now now notice
[1:06:24] this he says for thus saith the Lord God
[1:06:27] of Israel remember everyone said I
[1:06:29] believe he likes to hear that thus saith
[1:06:31] the Lord amen the barrel of milk shall
[1:06:33] not waste and neither shall The Crucible
[1:06:36] fail until the day that the Lord sendeth
[1:06:39] rain upon the earth now notice this amen
[1:06:43] she receives thus saith the Lord from a
[1:06:47] prophet now now stick with me on this
[1:06:49] she receives the word of a prophet now
[1:06:51] remember the Abel she didn't get mad and
[1:06:54] start to argue I tell you what bless God
[1:06:56] this is my food and I'm feeding my
[1:06:58] family first that was not her attitude
[1:07:01] but as she heard this saith the Lord
[1:07:03] amen and it put her into humility amen
[1:07:08] she humbled herself as she got
[1:07:10] underneath the word amen she got
[1:07:13] underneath so says the Lord amen she
[1:07:17] heard the word of that prophet and
[1:07:19] instead of fighting with it and arguing
[1:07:21] with her she said I'm going to go
[1:07:23] underneath that word and I'm gonna
[1:07:25] humble myself to that word he said well
[1:07:28] how happened preacher amen thus says the
[1:07:31] Lord fulfilled to her and brother the
[1:07:34] curse of all Never End dry amen and the
[1:07:38] meal never ran out because she humbled
[1:07:41] herself to the word of almighty God
[1:07:46] Hallelujah brother I tell you she didn't
[1:07:49] stand there and argue with the word amen
[1:07:52] and she didn't argue with God's Prophet
[1:07:55] she didn't say well I tell you why
[1:07:57] you're arrogant to ask something like
[1:07:59] that brother it was the humility in her
[1:08:01] and because she had humility her
[1:08:05] household was blessed and her son was
[1:08:08] blessed amen oh God Amen she lived a
[1:08:12] blessed life because she was I mean she
[1:08:15] was smart enough Amen to Humble herself
[1:08:18] to the word of God and I want to say
[1:08:20] this to you amen as you'll humble
[1:08:23] yourself to the word of God
[1:08:26] the oil won't run dry you won't be a dry
[1:08:30] Church you won't be a church that's
[1:08:32] starving to death amen but to all will
[1:08:35] always be there Amen in the meal will
[1:08:38] never run out you'll always have the
[1:08:40] spirit of God in your midst amen when
[1:08:44] you humble yourself to the word of God
[1:08:49] hallelujah amen you humble yourself to
[1:08:52] this work brother you ain't going to be
[1:08:54] starving for his Spirit you ain't going
[1:08:56] to be starving for bread of life whether
[1:08:59] there's an unlimited supply of oil and
[1:09:02] because the bride has humbled herself
[1:09:05] underneath the word of God
[1:09:08] yes sir
[1:09:10] Hallelujah
[1:09:13] amen she humbled herself to the word and
[1:09:17] receive such a powerful blessing now now
[1:09:20] there's many scriptures in the entire
[1:09:23] Bible that would portray humility hell
[1:09:26] amen God loves shamila to you find David
[1:09:29] and to me it's a very powerful
[1:09:32] illustration of humility amen he's a man
[1:09:35] after God's Own Heart now by the way I'm
[1:09:37] going to teach us that the reason he was
[1:09:39] a man after God's Own Heart is because
[1:09:41] he was quick to repent and I thought
[1:09:43] about that I thought you know he he was
[1:09:46] he was humble of to admit he was wrong
[1:09:49] he was humble enough hey when I'm wrong
[1:09:52] I'm wrong and I'm going to go repent I
[1:09:55] mean I want you to show I want to show
[1:09:57] you this man he's loved by God friends
[1:10:00] because he was quick to repent I mean he
[1:10:03] had a humble heart that he would humble
[1:10:05] himself to the word of God now listen
[1:10:07] just for a moment because he gets caught
[1:10:10] up in the flesh
[1:10:11] was that right he gets caught up in the
[1:10:14] flesh he was still a man of God Amen he
[1:10:17] goes out and kills Uriah amen kills your
[1:10:20] eye and takes Bathsheba to him amen and
[1:10:23] then God had a prophet brother shimbo
[1:10:25] amen by the name of Nathan and he sent
[1:10:28] him amen he sent him down to David and
[1:10:31] that Prophet Nation told David a story
[1:10:34] he said David what do you think about
[1:10:36] this there's a man that has all these
[1:10:38] sheep and he's very rich and there's a
[1:10:41] man that has these sheep or whatever the
[1:10:43] story he tells them he's a very poor man
[1:10:45] and he goes out and kills amen kills
[1:10:49] this man and takes a Sheep amen Nathan
[1:10:51] illustrates it and he says perfectly
[1:10:54] amen the situation that went on between
[1:10:57] David and Bathsheba amen and he says
[1:11:01] David what do you think should happen to
[1:11:03] a man that would commit a sin like this
[1:11:06] and Brother David in his indignation he
[1:11:09] said well but I tell you what he ought
[1:11:10] to be killed he ought to be slaughtered
[1:11:13] amen he ought to be in his End Amen but
[1:11:16] but then Nathan had a word for or for
[1:11:20] David there and he said David thus saith
[1:11:23] the Lord that man is you David you're
[1:11:26] the one that made that mistake you're
[1:11:28] the one that said and what did David do
[1:11:30] well bless God I tell you what nation
[1:11:32] I'm the king that's not what he did but
[1:11:35] he had a heart of humility and he said
[1:11:37] oh God he was so kind to send the
[1:11:41] prophet to my azarius and tell me I was
[1:11:44] wrong and tell me I was wrong amen I'm
[1:11:48] coming under subjection I'm coming under
[1:11:51] submission to the word of your prophet

[1:15:11] just got to obey Gods
[1:15:13] amen Peter's a very good illustration in
[1:15:16] this same in this same teaching here I
[1:15:19] mean but but Peter's here brother he's
[1:15:21] taught all night he's a professional
[1:15:24] fisherman all he's done is fish is you
[1:15:28] know maybe his whole life he knew how to
[1:15:30] catch a fish amen he could watch the
[1:15:33] moon and watch the tiger he knew what he
[1:15:35] was doing amen and Peter comes in from
[1:15:37] the night fishing all night and didn't
[1:15:39] catch anything but brother amen he comes
[1:15:42] into the bank there that morning and the
[1:15:45] word is standing there and says Peter
[1:15:48] launch back out into the deep and cast
[1:15:51] your net sign go cast your net back out
[1:15:54] there Peter and Peter didn't argue and
[1:15:56] say bless God you may have God's word
[1:15:58] but I tell you what I'm a fisherman
[1:16:00] official that's not what Peter did but
[1:16:03] he humbled himself he said you know what
[1:16:05] I'm sure he knows is what he's talking
[1:16:07] about so he said ask our word Lord at
[1:16:11] Thy word I will go out and I'll cast The
[1:16:14] NED and when he became obedient to the
[1:16:18] word of God brother he couldn't bring in
[1:16:21] the match because there were so many
[1:16:24] blessings
[1:16:27] hallelujah oh God
[1:16:31] Hallelujah he humbled himself brother
[1:16:35] you you know what are you trying to say
[1:16:37] tonight here's what I'm trying to say we
[1:16:39] want blessings in our church it's time
[1:16:41] we get humble to the word we want
[1:16:43] blessings in our day-to-day life let's
[1:16:45] get humble to the word we want the favor
[1:16:48] of God on our families now let's get
[1:16:50] humble to the word hallelujah
[1:16:54] yes sir
[1:16:57] I'm in everything everything testifies
[1:16:59] of humility God God loves the humble he
[1:17:02] resists the proud many many scriptures
[1:17:05] and in Luke 14 11 for whosoever exalts
[1:17:08] himself shall be amazed and he that
[1:17:11] Homeless themselves shall be exalted
[1:17:13] people don't like that though brother
[1:17:14] they want to be exalted amen they don't
[1:17:18] want to get humble they don't want to
[1:17:19] get low I say Church like we if we can
[1:17:21] get down low we can be blessed by God I
[1:17:24] mean if we can get real humble before
[1:17:25] God In Prayer well we can get blessed by
[1:17:28] God and get saturated by God and brother
[1:17:31] if we want Revival in our own walk with
[1:17:33] god let's just get humble before God
[1:17:36] Amen and start praying
[1:17:39] yes sir yes my brother I'm in everything
[1:17:42] testifies Hallelujah brother Adam would
[1:17:45] teach us there that God has three Bibles
[1:17:48] you all are very taught uh you're taught
[1:17:50] very well here I'm sure you're familiar
[1:17:51] with this but the man we're taught that
[1:17:53] God had three Bibles he said it was the
[1:17:54] Stars it was the pyramids and it was the
[1:17:56] book amen God's three Bibles but but
[1:17:59] you'll find there in that pyramid I mean
[1:18:02] if you ever studied out there's
[1:18:03] different there's different chambers in
[1:18:04] that pyramid right I mean you ever look
[1:18:07] out in the diagram you got the bride's
[1:18:08] chamber and you got the gallery that
[1:18:10] goes up to the king's chamber that's a
[1:18:12] very powerful illustrator because it's
[1:18:14] God's Bible correct yes
[1:18:17] testifying of God's heart testifying and
[1:18:21] watch on God's mind is that right he
[1:18:24] said preach I thought you said humility
[1:18:25] ain't it's not deep it's everywhere you
[1:18:28] look you find humility
[1:18:32] it's the thing that unlocks blessings is
[1:18:35] your humility
[1:18:36] but you look at that pyramid there and
[1:18:39] the Queen the Queen's Chambers down
[1:18:40] there at the bottom of it then you got
[1:18:42] the gallery to the king's chamber now
[1:18:44] you studied out it's amazing because
[1:18:46] that gallery that goes up to the king's
[1:18:48] chamber it starts out a decent size a
[1:18:52] lot of people can go pretty far about
[1:18:54] that last little bit before you get
[1:18:57] ready to enter into the king's chamber
[1:19:00] it gets really tied and you got to get
[1:19:03] really low
[1:19:05] it gets really tied and you gotta bend
[1:19:09] down a little bit you gotta hunker down
[1:19:11] my brother the lower you get the closer
[1:19:14] you get to the Chamber of the king and
[1:19:18] the lower the bride gives the closer
[1:19:21] we're getting to the king's chamber I
[1:19:24] say oh God may we get down to the lowest
[1:19:27] of the low and get closer and closer to
[1:19:31] the Chamber of the king
[1:19:34] that's where I want to be tonight I want
[1:19:37] to go to the king's chamber
[1:19:40] and the only way through it is through
[1:19:43] that small little open way
[1:19:47] The Pride the prideful can't ever get
[1:19:50] there
[1:19:51] ain't that right I mean the prideful man
[1:19:53] can't get there I mean because they're
[1:19:55] too sharing they can't fit through it
[1:19:57] but by the people that will humble
[1:19:59] themselves and say God if this is your
[1:20:03] way
[1:20:04] and this is your way to meet you
[1:20:07] then I will go that way that this is
[1:20:10] your method that you have made then I
[1:20:13] will come down as small as I need to get
[1:20:16] I want to say this
[1:20:20] this is the place to say it
[1:20:22] amen God has made it such a simple
[1:20:26] humble way Amen brother amen some of you
[1:20:30] amen you can come and meet God tonight
[1:20:32] brother amen in such a simple humble
[1:20:35] manner I mean you say preacher what way
[1:20:37] is God made but God has made a way amen
[1:20:41] that you can receive amen the same exact
[1:20:43] experience that they had in Acts the
[1:20:46] second chapter but it's foolish to the
[1:20:49] world all this screaming and shouting
[1:20:51] everybody all these amens to the world
[1:20:54] right the world don't understand it but
[1:20:56] this is the way that God has given us
[1:20:59] yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah glory
[1:21:03] to God Amen Let Us humble ourselves amen
[1:21:07] that we can go into the Chamber of the
[1:21:09] king and all it all testifies of the
[1:21:12] meek and the lowly amen Jesus said
[1:21:14] blessed are the meek and blessed are the
[1:21:17] humble blessed are the lowly Hallelujah
[1:21:21] I'm in a powerful area in this year you
[1:21:23] find Elisha amen Elisha there as as he
[1:21:26] encounters uh meeting Elijah there have
[1:21:29] been very very powerful uh scripture to
[1:21:32] me but you find as as Elijah has came
[1:21:35] amen I met with Elisha yeah I want you
[1:21:38] to notice the reaction of Elisha after
[1:21:41] he meets with this Prophet that Elijah
[1:21:44] passed by him and he cast his mantle
[1:21:47] upon him now now notice what Elisha did
[1:21:49] amen after after Elijah came by him he
[1:21:53] threw his man along him and the Bible
[1:21:55] says he left the oxen and he went after
[1:21:58] Elijah and said let me I pray they
[1:22:02] kissed my father and my mother and then
[1:22:04] I will follow thee and he said unto him
[1:22:07] I go back again what I have a what have
[1:22:09] I done to thee and he would turn back
[1:22:11] from him and took a yoke of oxen and
[1:22:14] slew them and bought their flesh but the
[1:22:17] instruments of The Oxen and gave unto
[1:22:19] the people and they did eat and then he
[1:22:21] arose and went after Elijah and
[1:22:24] ministered unto him now
[1:22:26] notice notice the heart that Elisha has
[1:22:30] as he has encountered the ministry of
[1:22:34] Elijah amen he throws that I mean he
[1:22:36] throws that mantle on him amen and it
[1:22:39] puts him into action now notice him this
[1:22:42] for the longest time amen Elisha lived
[1:22:45] his own life he did his own thing he did
[1:22:48] what he wanted to do but rather there
[1:22:50] was a certain day at a certain time that
[1:22:52] he encountered something that he had
[1:22:55] never seen before amen he encountered
[1:22:58] something that was different than
[1:23:00] anything else that ever happened to him
[1:23:02] amen amen he encounters the prophet
[1:23:06] there amen I noticed that that heart of
[1:23:09] Elisha amen that when Elijah found him
[1:23:11] he draped his cloak around him and one
[1:23:14] Theologian would actually say it this
[1:23:16] way I thought it was very beautiful he
[1:23:18] was recognizing that he had been chosen
[1:23:20] to finish the job begun by Elijah and
[1:23:24] Elisha immediately he still loud in his
[1:23:27] oxen and he cut the meat over the fires
[1:23:30] of his plowing equipment amen and Elisha
[1:23:33] gave the meat to his co-workers
[1:23:35] and he set out to follow Elijah and
[1:23:39] become his attendant now now he humbled
[1:23:42] himself to be mentored by a prophets he
[1:23:47] humbled himself and brother the the way
[1:23:50] he does it is so powerful to me amen
[1:23:53] because uh his his whole life he's a
[1:23:55] farmer I mean he plows for a living he
[1:23:58] has the auction for a living but brother
[1:24:01] when he encountered the prophet amen he
[1:24:04] went he said hey I'm going to follow
[1:24:06] after this man I don't understand what's
[1:24:08] happening but brother I'm selling out
[1:24:11] everything of God and brother he went
[1:24:13] and he slaughtered all the oxen
[1:24:16] amen he burned his plowing equipment
[1:24:18] saying if I'm going to come and be
[1:24:21] mentored by this amen then it's worth
[1:24:24] giving everything of God it's worth
[1:24:26] selling out completely if I'm going to
[1:24:29] be mentored by this Prophet that I'm
[1:24:31] going to get rid of any hindrances I'm
[1:24:34] going to get rid of the job if it
[1:24:36] hinders it I'm going to get rid of
[1:24:38] whatever I need to that hinders it that
[1:24:41] I may follow this profits
[1:24:44] yes sir now his actions testified what
[1:24:49] he thought about it I mean brother my
[1:24:52] brother I'm taught there on speaking on
[1:24:53] that he said you see what he did he
[1:24:56] burned everything behind him and he cut
[1:24:59] loose of everything amen now a man in
[1:25:02] his right mind would never do that but
[1:25:05] brother he severed himself from his
[1:25:07] intellectual sanctions and when he was
[1:25:10] going to get a new life amen following
[1:25:13] the prophet and following his word
[1:25:15] hallelujah yeah brother Graham said what
[1:25:18] he did he said my he burned every bridge
[1:25:21] behind him brother he burned up his past
[1:25:24] and because he knew hey when the going
[1:25:27] gets bad I might want to go back to it
[1:25:29] but if I sell everything out if I set
[1:25:33] out reasoning if I shut out I believe
[1:25:35] amen if I get rid of all other and it
[1:25:38] won't be a stumbling block
[1:25:40] I want to say this that your job gets in
[1:25:43] the way of you and God Amen then burn
[1:25:45] the job up if the oxen gets in the way
[1:25:48] of you and God then Florida
[1:25:51] if it's hindering you and God and get it
[1:25:54] out of your life
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:58] amen if you're gonna follow the word
[1:26:00] brother you've got to let go of
[1:26:02] everything I'm gonna trigger to humble
[1:26:05] yourself to God's word brother it is all
[1:26:07] of the word amen not just the ones that
[1:26:10] you can bear but are the ones you can't
[1:26:12] bear you gotta humble yourself church
[1:26:15] and come under subjection to every word
[1:26:19] of God yes
[1:26:21] yes hallelujah amen
[1:26:24] amen yes that's exactly what Elisha did
[1:26:27] brother he got rid of everything that
[1:26:29] could hinder him he sold out completely
[1:26:32] I just want to say this friends amen we
[1:26:35] ought to shout out completely to God yes
[1:26:38] yes hey man if you're gonna do it then
[1:26:40] do it all away amen I just say what a
[1:26:44] prophet said he said my I would rather
[1:26:46] be an Infidel on that day amen to be a
[1:26:49] hypocrite amen I would rather amen this
[1:26:53] this may not be popular but I'm just
[1:26:54] saying amen if you're going to be in the
[1:26:57] house of God and be a hypocrite being
[1:27:00] here amen you should just go home amen
[1:27:04] God will sing more of you that you're
[1:27:06] just an Infidel and your eye hit by
[1:27:09] queer but if you want to serve God and
[1:27:12] you'll want to sell out to God and give
[1:27:14] it everything you got and set out every
[1:27:17] time every bridge behind you not least
[1:27:21] I've ever Shoreline
[1:27:23] glory to God hallelujah amen hey if it's
[1:27:28] worth giving anything to it this was
[1:27:29] giving you all
[1:27:31] I mean there ought not to be anything
[1:27:32] hindering us with God
[1:27:34] Hallelujah in other words amen Elisha
[1:27:39] testified by the life that he by his
[1:27:42] actions amen if it's worth I mean if
[1:27:44] it's worth uh serving at all at me
[1:27:47] following after the prophet is worth
[1:27:49] serving hey if it's worth doing it at
[1:27:51] all I mean it's worth everything I've
[1:27:53] got
[1:27:53] amen now now I want you to notice him
[1:27:56] this you you find in First Kings 19 amen
[1:27:59] and it's all the way till second Kings
[1:28:01] chapter two you don't even hear Elisha's
[1:28:04] name mentioned you have no scripture for
[1:28:07] for many many chapters I got into
[1:28:09] thinking on that one day and study I
[1:28:11] thought my I wonder where Elisha is I
[1:28:14] don't want them to hit me I know that I
[1:28:16] know exactly where Elisha is he's
[1:28:18] wherever Elijah is
[1:28:25] and that's exactly where he was now now
[1:28:28] historians believe it to be about six
[1:28:30] years that Elisha followed Elijah now
[1:28:33] studying this and I thought it was very
[1:28:36] beautiful I mean could you imagine being
[1:28:38] with a prophet of God for six years
[1:28:41] straight amen I'm sure amen I'm sure
[1:28:44] that he learned how to handle a whole
[1:28:46] lot of things I mean I I'm sure he
[1:28:49] really learned how to serve God Amen how
[1:28:52] to worship God Amen by following the
[1:28:54] ministry of that word Prophet I mean I'm
[1:28:57] sure he learned a lot of things amen
[1:28:59] amen humbling himself underneath that
[1:29:02] prophet
[1:29:04] anyway I'll tell you I try to imagine
[1:29:06] sometimes amen being that person in the
[1:29:09] Bible amen I tell you I can imagine
[1:29:11] Elisha I've been thinking what why am I
[1:29:13] doing this anyway I mean what what's the
[1:29:16] point of me following this what's the
[1:29:18] point of this new life that I've got I
[1:29:20] I've gotten rid of everything I've left
[1:29:22] my I've left my job I've left this I
[1:29:25] have mercy amen Elisha didn't know if he
[1:29:28] just kept on serving God and just kept
[1:29:31] on following that Prophet it will lead
[1:29:34] him all the way to a double portion of
[1:29:38] the spirit of Elijah he will just keep
[1:29:41] following it
[1:29:44] yes hey man I'll tell you amen I'll tell
[1:29:47] you why I think happened it's just me
[1:29:49] amen but I I imagine it this way as he
[1:29:52] is there amen with salisha when he walks
[1:29:55] by him and drops that mantle on him amen
[1:29:58] I'm sure maybe there was an anointing on
[1:30:01] that man and maybe he felt something
[1:30:03] maybe he felt maybe he felt the power of
[1:30:06] God on that same and so my God this is
[1:30:09] the most realist thing I've ever felt
[1:30:14] amen this is the most realist thing I've
[1:30:17] ever failed amen and he was hooked on
[1:30:20] that ain't been feeling the power of God
[1:30:22] I just want to say this even the prophet
[1:30:26] and the age you and I live in brother he
[1:30:28] has introduced even the power of God to
[1:30:32] the Church of God and brother ever since
[1:30:35] I felt the power of God and the reality
[1:30:38] of God whether I'm a hook to it and I'm
[1:30:42] serving God Hallelujah
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] ever since then
[1:30:54] amen no doubt yeah there was times that
[1:30:57] got hard I'm sure there was times Elijah
[1:30:59] probably felt like giving up as a man
[1:31:02] six years following this Prophet but
[1:31:04] rather and maybe he was taught by that
[1:31:07] prophet and don't you ever give up
[1:31:09] Elisha don't you ever stop following
[1:31:11] don't don't you ever give up on it amen
[1:31:14] amen Elijah they're testing him one time
[1:31:18] three times actually hey man he's there
[1:31:21] while he's following him you just stay
[1:31:23] with me we'll bring this into something
[1:31:25] just a minute I remember he's here amen
[1:31:28] and and he said well I'm going to go up
[1:31:30] and go into uh to dalston or wherever
[1:31:32] those three cities were you just stay
[1:31:34] right here and by the way I'm taught a
[1:31:36] powerful lesson in that and because
[1:31:38] Elisha amen he saw where Elijah went and
[1:31:42] Elijah said you just stay right here he
[1:31:44] said hey as as your soul lives I'm going
[1:31:47] where you go
[1:31:50] I'm going where you go I'm gonna happen
[1:31:54] again you just stay right here I'm going
[1:31:56] on here he said hey that's my soul I'm
[1:31:59] going where you go and then it happened
[1:32:01] again

[1:43:13] just saturated that brother brother amen
[1:43:16] he was so saturated by the spirit of God
[1:43:19] Amen he couldn't even walk I was so full
[1:43:22] of the Holy Ghost that's my brother got
[1:43:24] an experience with God hallelujah he
[1:43:28] said to this day I've never had one like
[1:43:30] what that was you say what was it it was
[1:43:33] a brother that got simple enough that
[1:43:35] shake and let God do something
[1:43:37] he got a humble and God that he could
[1:43:40] say A B C D E F G you say preacher you

[1:44:06] Hallelujah preach my brother
[1:44:09] amen he was humble enough Hallelujah to
[1:44:12] get an answer from God
[1:44:14] Amen I'll say it to you this way amen if
[1:44:17] we get humble enough to get an answer
[1:44:18] from God and let God answer the way he
[1:44:21] wants to
[1:44:22] amen let him answer the way he wants to
[1:44:25] amen if it's if it's simple then let it
[1:44:28] be even if it's complicated let it be if
[1:44:31] amen if it's true teaching let whatever
[1:44:34] is true let God answer and let God speak
[1:44:37] and let him deal with us yes
[1:44:40] Hallelujah yes my brother I said let us
[1:44:43] be humble to the word hallelujah and
[1:44:46] when you find there when the disciples
[1:44:48] are there with Jesus and Jesus is teach
[1:44:50] them Amen brother man actually talks on
[1:44:52] that there uh when he went to teach on
[1:44:54] Amen
[1:44:55] unless you uh Eat My Flesh and drink my
[1:44:57] blood you have no part in me but the
[1:44:59] Lord said you see what he was doing he
[1:45:00] was I had too much crowd following him
[1:45:04] had too much crowd around him amen so he
[1:45:07] broke out the word
[1:45:08] I even had too many people around him
[1:45:11] that was there for the Miracles and so
[1:45:13] he broke out the word amen so he took
[1:45:16] the word amen I'm taught unless you eat
[1:45:19] my flesh and drink my blood you shall
[1:45:22] have no part with me and the Bible says
[1:45:25] a multitude left a multitude left and
[1:45:28] went away but right there was a couple
[1:45:31] they were so humble brother they
[1:45:35] they probably didn't understand what he
[1:45:37] said is that right and let's be real
[1:45:40] that they didn't understand what he said
[1:45:42] what what Peter Peter talked to talk
[1:45:45] talk to John said what is he trying to
[1:45:47] say but no doubt they didn't understand
[1:45:49] it and so Jesus went to them and he knew
[1:45:53] they was Believers he wasn't trying to
[1:45:56] run them off but he went there to them
[1:45:58] and he said are y'all going to leave
[1:46:00] also hey remember brother they were
[1:46:02] humble they said hey we all have to
[1:46:05] understand it all to believe it all we
[1:46:08] don't have to understand it all Amen to
[1:46:11] follow you
[1:46:12] I said Lord we ain't never heard word
[1:46:15] like your word we ain't never heard a
[1:46:18] voice like your voice you alone have got
[1:46:21] the words of life eternal we will follow
[1:46:24] you what was it it was people brother
[1:46:27] that were humble
[1:46:30] they were high my brother they didn't
[1:46:33] have to prove it all they didn't have to
[1:46:35] explain it all but they knew his word
[1:46:37] and they believed him
[1:46:42] Hallelujah
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:45] they believed his word yes my brother
[1:46:47] brother they were humble enough now now
[1:46:49] I'm amen I believe you ought to prove
[1:46:52] all things
[1:46:53] you believe that and but I believe
[1:46:55] there's things that we will not find out
[1:46:56] till eternity I believe whether Prophet
[1:46:58] taught and they're amen those things
[1:47:00] will be learning throughout all eternity
[1:47:02] amen sometimes God wants us just to
[1:47:04] believe him
[1:47:06] amen it ain't about your understanding

[1:57:35] Christmas
[1:57:36] wish you'll be my way
[1:57:42] hallelujah
[1:57:44] amen let's give the Lord the big crap
[1:57:53] what a powerful
[1:57:56] wonderful
[1:57:58] deep message brother Solomon amen
[1:58:03] humility is a great key
[1:58:06] brother Branham say total obedience to
[1:58:09] the word of God will entitle you to the
[1:58:13] token amen must have struggled that we
[1:58:16] get in this life is because we don't
[1:58:19] want to Humble ourselves
[1:58:21] we want to have our ways
[1:58:24] we want to make people know that I am so
[1:58:27] and so
[1:58:28] and this is the way I do stuff
[1:58:31] and they're gonna hear me they're gonna
[1:58:33] get it
[1:58:34] that's not God's way
[1:58:36] that's why your trial keep coming back
[1:58:39] and forth until you learn how to humble
[1:58:42] yourself
[1:58:43] and to let things go
[1:58:45] let people say what they want to say
[1:58:48] as long as you know that between you and
[1:58:51] God everything is all right
[1:58:54] that's what matters
[1:58:56] amen
[1:58:57] you don't have to answer it to everybody
[1:59:00] amen take your flesh out
[1:59:05] take the arrogancy spirit out
[1:59:09] be teachable
[1:59:11] be humble
[1:59:13] sometimes God will just allow something
[1:59:16] to come to your life just to try you to
[1:59:20] see where you are in your walk
[1:59:23] and before you know it you're on the
[1:59:25] ground you're on the floor don't get
[1:59:28] discouraged it's a trial to show you
[1:59:31] that you still have things in your life
[1:59:33] that you need to let it go
[1:59:36] instead of getting upset you're gonna
[1:59:39] miss God
[1:59:40] trial to a Believer are not the main are
[1:59:44] not meant for frustration
[1:59:46] say God is not the author of frustration
[1:59:50] When Trials come you need to be quick to
[1:59:53] discern what is going on and what how
[1:59:57] does God want you to react
[2:00:00] to what is going on and then from there
[2:00:03] on you can learn
[2:00:05] amen if you want to prove who you are
[2:00:08] God will send another trial he was send
[2:00:12] another trial until when a trial comes
[2:00:15] you will take your hand off you say God
[2:00:17] I'm not going to fight anymore I'm just
[2:00:19] going to let this go then the Lord will
[2:00:22] say now you understand let me go ahead
[2:00:24] and handle it this is why we have
[2:00:27] difficulty people pulling on each other
[2:00:29] Between Brothers Between ministers
[2:00:32] between married people because one don't
[2:00:35] want to let go if you want to prove to
[2:00:38] the other that what I say is what I'm
[2:00:40] gonna do and before you know it you'll
[2:00:42] be spinning yourself wasting time
[2:00:44] telling one another
[2:00:46] amen
[2:00:48] discern what God is doing humble
[2:00:50] yourself to the word the word is
[2:00:52] preached
[2:00:54] take what the word said and go do it yes
[2:00:56] if you come see a pastor and I tell you
[2:00:59] what to do not according to me according
[2:01:02] to the word humble yourself amen even if
[2:01:05] you know more than me
[2:01:07] maybe you're in a domain you know more
[2:01:09] than me maybe you're in a profession
[2:01:11] that I don't know but if I tell you what
[2:01:13] is good what God is telling me to do you
[2:01:16] need to humble yourself because you came
[2:01:18] to see me not as a man you came to see
[2:01:21] me as a pastor and I'm responding to you
[2:01:25] as a pastor so it's up to you to take
[2:01:27] your way your plan B what you have in
[2:01:31] your thought and drop it down and just
[2:01:33] obey now when you obey you say God I'm
[2:01:36] not obeying brother Stephen I'm obeying
[2:01:39] the servant of the Lord that you put
[2:01:41] there to instruct me this is what he
[2:01:43] told me to do and I'm gonna do it if
[2:01:45] this if you learn to do that quickly
[2:01:48] Deliverance won't be taking too long the
[2:01:51] problem is we get instruction we go we
[2:01:53] do something else we get instruction we
[2:01:56] go we do something else because the
[2:01:58] instruction that was not given does not
[2:02:01] match your expectation you are coming to
[2:02:03] see a man of God and you want him to
[2:02:06] tell you certain things things the way
[2:02:08] you want it to be done and when it's not
[2:02:10] safe that way you won't take it you go
[2:02:12] back and it shows that you were not even
[2:02:15] supposed to come to begin with so when
[2:02:17] you're approaching me as a pastor
[2:02:19] amen humble yourself
[2:02:22] amen
[2:02:24] amen when you are approaching the word
[2:02:26] of God to humble yourself if anybody
[2:02:29] brings you the scripture or a quote
[2:02:32] humble yourself amen don't argue just go
[2:02:36] down
[2:02:37] amen if you did what is wrong you don't
[2:02:40] need further explanation just go back
[2:02:42] and repent and move forward
[2:02:45] amen let's pray Heavenly Father
[2:02:48] Lord we thank you once again for your
[2:02:51] grace
[2:02:52] for your love and for your mercy
[2:02:55] and I know exactly
[2:02:59] why this message came
[2:03:04] because they are individuals not one
[2:03:09] individuals in this church
[2:03:12] and all over the world
[2:03:15] that need to Humble themselves
[2:03:17] somehow in one part of the other
[2:03:23] may we learn
[2:03:25] how to be taught
[2:03:31] may they all Corner men
[2:03:34] father dies

[2:04:12] end
