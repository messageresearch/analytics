defeating death helen mcgregor we thank you father for the things that you do for us hallelujah glory brother pauline has a testimony has he made it yet not yet okay does anybody have a praise report they want to give this morning i do i want to i want to say that my wife and i had a nice little time together we haven't been to alone like we were this weekend since covid we renovated our bathrooms all last summer that's a trial it's almost as much a trial as moving okay everything's under plastic for months and then we had to cover it when we both started new jobs and that's been that's been pretty stressful so we managed to get away and reconnect as husband and wife and just you know i mean because you know despite what might some might think it's not always sunshines and butterflies and rainbows and unicorns and you know but you do need time sometime to reconnect hey man without having to worry about what you're going to do next and what have i got waiting on me and everything like that so we stayed in a little town that was full of crosses everywhere you went there was a cross for ever you know with the church but it was just i bet we saw 20 of them and i liked that put a lot of crosses up so has anybody else got one did you have one to stand up for the guys i'll put there like you're okay i'm like i'm pretty sure i just sprained my ankle and i felt it i got to walk and i could barely walk on that i was limping and you're like are you done like you need to go back and i'm like no i'll be all be all right now the devil is lying devil is a liar and i went on and the next morning i woke up it was swollen it was purple and i usually don't work on saturdays but my buddy needs help he does landscaping i'm like i'll help you and i worked all day on it and today i'm here [Applause] anybody else got one on this uh easter morning yes of his ma'am and how the devil was attacking him i received it he never came back to me on wednesday to attack my ear my family prayed gone amen praise the lord amen hallelujah [Applause] amen all right i'm going to go to uh prayer requests brother pauline come up hey man he's got a testimony he wants to give we want to give him that opportunity you're gonna need a translator brother are you good we got one over here somebody's horns going off out there i don't know if there's anybody in here god bless you get your it was on monday my son goes on he put a little bottle or bottle cap excuse me we didn't know what was going on it was a complicated situation they decept from 5 p.m event was uh all the way to 11 p.m we didn't know that that the son had a bottle cap on his throat and we saw we saw it the throat started to swollen and on his left side was all swollen and we tell ourselves what's going on and the son came to us and he showed me that i had something on his throat and i told him you got something on your throat and he took me so he was leading me to see if there's something we can do to take the thing out of his throat and his mother [Music] [Music] the child was playing as as usual so we don't know when did this follow this thing after a while [Music] i realize that we have the god of heaven who can intervene to our situation my first reflection that came to my mind was to call the pastor he told me the law has a power is able to do that the child can throw up that thing and say also that they can put something in his mouth to take away the bottle cap that's on his torch which was a person by the team all the bodies i have called account for me through the prayers after a while the doctor came back [Music] and he told me i believe that we can open up this side [Music] so that way we can take out the bottle cap that's on his torch and i was once again lost [Music] [Music] warfare sortier so the nurse told us that i have talked to specialists that we can take the child to the hospital so that way they can remove that thing and i told you my brothers and sisters i can tell you that the god of heaven as intervened so we left from seven i'm sorry from 5 p.m all the way to 8 a.m in the morning went to the hospital where they could remove that thing and the doctor was amazed at how was a child breathing so that thing blocked the space between the throat and the stomach and you say that place right there that area is a tube where the air goes in through so you can breathe it's hard to breathe when there's something on that space to that's blocking it and after that he told me we're going to put the child to sleep and we'll move that thing that's blocking us grace is it was by god's grace that we took the child and they was able to remove that thing and now the child is well he's walking he's breathing and all that i just want to thank the lord every time that i walk i remind myself of that and i say that i always praise the lord for that may the lord be blessed [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] god is good that's a big one right there good gracious praise the lord anybody else we have any prayer requests this morning amen amen brother brother tonight do you mind coming up praying this morning for us please it's good to see brother bo and his family amen [Applause] god bless you my brother [Applause] what i'm at a loss it's just kiddie what's your brother's name brenton yeah okay good to see you sir i'm sitting over here thinking brandon but i knew that wasn't right good to see y'all god bless you all my brothers and sister forgive me from what i'm out of place right now i'm kindly asking you know sometimes most of us may not be able to be here all the time and testimonies are being given sometimes we just say some i mean you know that somebody's talking you can see it online but you can't hear what they are saying would it be okay if to give them like the mic when they are talking in the congregation so that we can be part of them too absolutely thank you all right let's pray dear god our heavenly father lord jesus christ the great creator of the heavens and the earth we bow before your holy throne of grace because we know no other god was greater than you this the poet wrote and said i've run all over i've saved all over but i found none who is like you you are the great eternal god and you are the reason why we are here this morning we want to thank you father for getting each and every one of us here safely i want to thank you lord for this resurrection morning as our brother testified sunday is a day of worship but this is especially a good one because this is the day you rose from the dead and you proved lord that you are the mighty conqueror lord everything is finished because that's what you said when you went to that grave you said it is finished so whatever it may be this morning it may be sickness it may be a financial uh situation it may be a law there are so many needs we can't even mention them all but all we know that it is finished lord because you declared it and we believe it and we are partakers thereof so we want to thank you lord even for the testimony that our brother gave how you serve this child from that critical situation it just goes to show that you are still a prayer answering god and for that we are grateful this morning to know that we are not saving a dead god but we are serving the god with our life the god of brother branham the god of those three hebrew boys the god who performed so many wonders in the time that has gone by and you can still perform even now lord jesus christ you are still the same because the bible says you are the same yesterday today and forever so lord we are very thankful to be worshipping such a god as you may you help us now lord as the song service goes on may you continue to anoint the song leader continue to anoint the musicians lord we pray that you are knowing also the minister as he shall stand behind the sacred desk here may we see beyond the veil and may we see you speaking to us so that as we go out of these doors lord we will say it was good that we came for we have been been made better believers better christians better candidates of the rapture we thank you father because we know you have never failed us yet so come and meet with each and every one of us this morning we pray also lord at this moment in time for the tides and offerings that are going to be given may you bless your children in a special way even those who may not be able to give may you bless them so that if there's a next time they'll also be able to partake in this service we pray lord you're granted even those who may not be here this morning remember them wherever they are and remember the bride of christ all over the world in jesus christ's most precious name we pray with all thanksgiving [Music] amen okay praise the lord saying so why you uh the tithe and offering are being collected we just had a uh a reminder we'll remind you of the uh questions that on your heart it's going to be presented to the pastor and the family gathering so we want you to be sure that you take your time and write them down and and get us to the deacons you find a deacon or a trustee just remind to get those questions there because it's you know it's some questions is really a deep concern to each and every one of you and this is an opportunity for you to uh present it to the pastor amen thank you amen praise the lord sister

morning we don't have no visitor we have family members so welcome into the family thank you very much musician you might take your seat for a little bit as we've given uh it's easter a wonderful week i tried to get in the easter channel but your boss keep pulling me back amen blessed be the name of the lord you heard brother paul and giving a testimony here so basically he called me and his child his first son swallowed like a bottle top or something and he choked him but for some reason he was still breathing and his neck begin to swell but the child was breathing and everything normal so it's a paradox normally he should be choking or something like that and the devil was trying to snatch that life just like that by the resurrected crust amen the lord jesus christ watch over the child and by his grace that's what came out that was what was in it amen he could have went through a surgery when they opened up and pull everything apart to go search it but for some reason they put something there and pop it up the same guard that can take a piece of iron from the bottom of the river and made it float with a piece of wood is the same god that pulled this thing out and the child is hard this morning we serve the living god amen blessed be the name of the lord just something about easter brother branham said that is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all time this easter is where he proved what he had said amen man can say things but yet it is not exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proven to be the truth and ask god who said of things hold fast to that which is good he will not tell you to do something that he will not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sin in other words it has been proven thoroughly and we have a right to hold fast to christ because christ resurrected from the dead amen brother branham say easter greetings to you all this morning very happy to be here today in the tabernacle on this great memorial time of the easter the lord has given us a beautiful day for this worship and we are here this morning in celebration of the greatest event that ever happened in the world the resurrection of our lord jesus he was great in his death but man can die but there never was a man who could raise from the dead but oh him and there is where our hopes laid this morning in the resurrection of our lord you want to know him in the power of water his resurrection thank you jesus for rising from the dead now we are approaching easter and as you get in your places and marking it down i think that this coming week is the most and the greatest historical week of all the weeks of the year i think that the greatest things we will celebrate this week this coming week which is today was the greatest event that ever take place on earth i don't think anything could surpass it amen because easter made way to revelation 5 and revelation 5 made way to revelation 10 and all those fulfillment could never happen until the price was paid on calvary amen it took the price of calvary to go to revelation 5 to provide the kinsman redeemer that can take the book and break the seal and go on revelation 10 and send it back on earth and now we are justified in the eyes of god like never done it before amen you say well the crucifixion was great but man has died many man has been crucified even the fifa the cross even the same days of our lord but there was only one of them who rose from the dead that sells it amen but all that is the rising he did what justify freely for ever living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sin away but but but but but rising he justified me in other words you never done it for the first place you can stand and watch god face to face and not even being ashamed because we are justified by the blood of the lamb blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus thank you for rising from the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever we praise him and we thank him thank you for this easter morning hallelujah what was that raising up it was god received that the bill has been wanted right thing he justified freely for oh what a savior rising what had god done a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but easter was the greatest of them all for he was god's endorsement my laws has been met my requirement has been met that is him he rolls him up from the dead rising he justify freely forever blessed be his holy name let's give him a clap again [Applause] amen hallelujah and one of this day even the dead in christ will rise because he rose hallelujah oh my god blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus everybody happy everybody happy young people you understand what is to mean to you your christ has risen from the dead and everything is finished hallelujah [Applause] amen blessed be the name of the lord just a quick report on the church progress amen this is where we started right everybody remember this building right looks gracious white over there mighty parking lot by the grace of god but just to give a church a progress of what has been going on your building have been immorphy a little bit from this situation into this one amen amen so that grace color has been taken out blessed be the name of the lord if you want let me hide that if you wanna look here that's your parking lot we have not worked on a parking lot yet but you can see her muddy and this side you can see the steeple right there the way he looks but by the power of transformation that's it right there amen blessed be the name of the lord we are still working on the east side when you open the east side this is the work been going on we removed the popcorn and everything we don't want popcorn on it we want everything to look nice and smooth so that was when they were removing the popcorn and last week they were preparing for the sheetrock so by god's grace i believe this coming work this coming week everything will be looking better than that so continue to pray for the building so that the lord can provide money and we can go ahead and finish our project amen amen you can turn on the light [Applause] hallelujah you're doing great but we are going with the speed of the money amen so if you want to go there quickly just remember i won't touch your stimulus check [Laughter] you keep that up amen and you let the lord lead you but we just need a lot of support financially keep praying the lord has been working in the most wonderful amazing way where prices has been dropped in a supernatural way amen so we want to make it good we want you to be proud of your building we don't want you to be there and be ashamed we want you to be there and be happy and feel honored respected valued as wonderful creatures of the living god amen so just be patient with us work on your pocket and we're going to move pretty quick blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture this morning now you can stand that was the quick report takes money to make a church look good takes money to make a sister look good so if you're not radiate don't get married amen don't get married if you're not ready yet amen okay i didn't know it was like this they need to go to the hair salon amen so you make sure you have a job like jacob you can work hard and you can provide that don't fasting when they bring you the hair salon bill you could have stay single paul say it's perspective you don't even want to feel your paw you want to follow peter so welcome to the world amen may the sister say amen okay blessed be the name of the lord let's go to isaiah 3. i don't know where that one dropped but i had to deliver it isaiah 3 verse 8 could not touch it last week hopefully by the grace of god we can get there for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory verse 9 they show of their countenance their face does witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not normally when a man does something wrong like adam when a child of god does something that is wrong he usually have a tendency to hide he has a tendency to run away from church he has a tendency to run away from his parent because he's hiding something that was proven by adam that's the reason why god was coming down and say adam adam where are they it's not that god didn't know where he was he's the god that knows everything but men have left the position that he used to hold when god look at that position it's empty man is no longer there amen but this sin of sodom is something that once he struck you once you under this anointing you are not ashamed to express your sin anymore it gives you a bold face while you're doing something wrong you are not ashamed anymore the sister that used to be shy is no longer shy her face is bright amen blessed be the name of the lord they hide it not word to their soul for they have rewarded evil to themselves verse 16 moreover the lord said because the daughters of zion are hardy proud and walk with straight forth neck what makes them walk like that what makes their neck stretch if god can give me grace you're going to see what high heel will do to your neck okay and one turn eyes in other words seductive eyes walking and mincing will make them tremble twist when they're walking can you walk normally and twist there is something that is making them twist you need a prophet to see this messing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet in other words as they're going there is a nose that followed them cut then everybody would turn around let's go to ezekiel 16 you might be seated if you're there you can say amen this is a channel that the black dog has been stirred so much and people had been delivered one after the other i cannot give this testimony here because it's people private life i gotta keep it i will go with that in the rapture amen bless it be the name of the lord it's going to stay here not even in the heart of my wife i go with it in the rapture because it's people on private life one after the other one two three almost every week somebody's getting delivered i'm preaching things i don't know it's going straight to people's life and pull something out amen it is the grace of god it has nothing to do with brother stephen it is your god amen verse 8 now when i pass by you in the time of puberty we explain this and look upon you behold your time was the time of love and i sprayed my skirt over you and cover your nakedness we already explained this uh claiming of the marriage yeah and i saw to you and enter into a covenant with you says the lord and you became mind the second stage we're looking right here is god not only is he claiming a relationship by spreading the skirt like roof but at this point he's now taking care of veiling or covering the woman that was naked amen she didn't have clothes first but now the lord is interested in her clothing first day she have to be washed she had to be clean they have to take the blood that came from my father the blood that we were born with from our families have to be completely cleaned out that life that we were born with from sex have to be completely removed you are born again but once you are born again god now is concerned about your other appearance he want to treat you and want to make you like his child everybody clear verse 14 if you can joke with me there the bible say and your renown your fame in other words went forth among the hidden not among the christians so this woman when she is outside among the women among the among the hidden in other words among the people of the world there is a perfume there is a fame there is a reputation that is spread in your community something happened to you god did something in your life that's a certain reputation came out and it's going among the hidden among the people that don't worship god the way you do amen we say and your renown went from among the hidden for your water so that beauty has been spoken of amen for it was perfect through my water calmliness which i had put upon you say the lord in other words what people are praising you for is not what you have done it is what i did for you it is the way i dress you the way i cover you the way i have adorned you the way i have protected you the way i have done i have transformed you amen that is what is causing the fame that family is not caused by you it is caused by the dress code of god amen hebrew chapter 11 so we must strive to get that kind of dress code not what we want not what the world want but what god wanted hebrew chapter 11 we explained this last week a little verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called out into a place which he showed after received for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went everybody knows that now anybody clear by faith he's surgeon in the land of promise as in a strange country you understand that now because he has been called he goes into a land even though he is in the land of his inheritance but yet he's not comfortable but yet he's in a promised land he's living in a promised land as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heir with him of the same promise in other words everybody that's going to be joined to the faith of abraham will have the same behavior you will live just like abraham you're not going to come join to the faith of abraham and live any different than what abraham was living everybody clear true faith also sarah now verse 10 for he look for a city which has foundations it's in the book of revelation who's builder and maker is who so abraham knew that everything that is in the world is not actually matching with with what he was looking he was looking for a city that's the builder the founder of the city is god but that city is not in this kingdom that's why jesus said my kingdom is not of this world everybody clear job to verse 13 these all died in faith not having received the promise but have seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and what pilgrim on the earth how can you be a stranger and a pilgrim on a promised land it means that that's not satisfaction that just take you to the baptism of the holy spirit then the black dog is stirred then the fight started right when israel drunk from the water of rephrasing then amalek attack amalek will never attack if you have not drunk from the water of raphael yet because you belong to him you are working for his kingdom when you change the kingdom by the inner man then automatically a fight started that's what the indian uh chief said to brother branham that since i've been saved there is a battle that started there was a white dog and a black dog fighting let's go to verse 14. for they does say such things declare plainly that they seek a country in other words by living like that you are testifying to the world that i don't belong to you amen this world is not our home this is satan eden this is not our place that's the reason why i'm living different than you people amen verse 15 and truly if they had been mindful of that country this is where we want to really get it in other words when abraham left we explained to you he left for the land of the calvins he left from babylon he left for the land of the gardens from babylon everybody clear but the problem is when he left you must forget that land this is what a holla and a holy bar in ezekiel 23 did not do they didn't burn the bridges and they went back again to babylon but that's what paul is saying that when the people when they departed from the land and went to the promised land they never again look back to the land of the county their life became different their jurisdiction was completely different the headship was completely different but they never kept in their mind the image of the land of the county because that image will pull you back from where you came from amen verse 15 and truly if they had been mindful if they were thinking of that country from where they came out they might have had opportunity to have what return as long as you thinking on the world as long as you love the world and the things of the world from where god pulls you out you're gonna have a tendency to go back again amen in other words you are barking at the wrong door you are inviting the black dog back again to pull you from where god took you out so once you leave the world once you leave egypt you must burn your bridges because you don't want to go there in egypt in babylon you are living like hidden you didn't know god you are living worldly everybody clear amen but for your reputation to go among the hidden you must be in the promised land when you live in the promised land then your life and the way you dress the way you portray the way you live everything you're doing is completely contrary to where you came from that's why people begin to talk about you different like something really happened to that person but if your heart is like israel on the journey to the promised land keep thinking about the concumber of egypt keep thinking about whatever they ate in egypt and things like that god finally destroyed them all because they were not fit to enter in the promised land with a polluted mind amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again in this easter morning where we are celebrating the great resurrection lord that sealed the history of christianity father thank you for coming down this undying love that you expressed for us lord to come and to climb all the way to calvary to take the place of us sinners lord being lord father strip off your clothes completely in front of everybody just because you wanted lord to pay our ticket father we are so grateful for that we thank you and we are committing this service again unto the hand this morning lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may the holy spirit be the only spirit in this place lord may the devil and his army be completely outlawed father we rebuke every demonic spirit that can bring a slumbering spirit upon your children or rebellion or resistance lord but may the heart be opened upload to the engrafted word that can save the soul of your children lord we commit it all unto the hand and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you turn with me to genesis chapter 2 1 verse 26 when you're there you can holler amen then we can go somebody goes quick we on the king's uh hazaris three feast and esther two banquet we on part 25 where we're dealing with the territory of the black dog everybody there now when we spoke on ezekiel 23 on our holy bar we found out that al-holibah opened a door to the people of the outside she was rescued from egypt she was rescued from the world she came out from denomination all the way to the promised land but she never burned the bridges behind her and she continued to think over it and open the door to something else in ezekiel 23 verse 36 and verse 40 and 42 the bible says and furthermore that she have sent for men to come from pharah unto whom a messenger was sent and lo we already explained this they came for whom you did wash the themselves and pentest their eyes and deck their self with ornament when these women came to the promised land they used to dress a certain way they used to behave a certain way they used to live a certain way but when they opened the door to the babylonian when they opened the door to the garden when they opened the door to go back again to the old lives that they were leaving before by opening that door he also opened the door to worthiness everybody clear he opened the door to worldiness and they never realized what they were doing everybody cleared so far so when they opened the door to worldliness and begin to court the young men that were not the young men of israel the bible says that they washed their self not that they were not taken aback they were washing themselves they were taking bath but what the bible was trying to explain here that there is a different uh uh personal care there is a difference in their approach of their grooming that was different than the way they were doing before in other words for the first time these women begin to paint their eyes here they begin to deck themselves with a certain ornament and the reason why they did that they didn't do that to go into the into the church they didn't do that to go into the temple but they did it because they were expecting man to come and to live uncleanly with them everybody clear so the first thing the scripture says there is the painting of the eyes and then the second one the decking with ornament everybody clear so far now when you look at the painting of the eyes brother branham says this that this is the major scene of our days it is the major scene among our people which is water worldliness as the bible say laodicea is what worldly so since we're dealing with worldliness in proverbs chapter 6 if you recall this very well the bible strictly explained to us that you must be careful about a strange woman because she's sweet with her world but she also said juice with her eyes when you open the eyes of your of a woman let's go to proverbs chapter 6 first so it can make sense somebody else is still thinking remembering what was in proverbs chapter 6. so let's get it and pick you up so we can move forward proverbs chapter 6 verse 24 if you dare you can say amen a few people 24 few people need to preach with me 24. okay proverbs 6 24 to keep you from the evil woman that woman is not a good woman she is evil from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman she's covering herself with flattery she's appearing to be sweet but she's not really sweet you won't see that color until you put her in your home then you're going to see her color last we explain to you the word lust everybody clear we explain to you that there is something that a woman can do to cause lust somebody can remind me number one she must expose herself she must expose part of her body because a woman body is sacred number two she cannot be exposing part of her body but she can wear something that is tight everybody clear and that is showing the form and the shape of her body in other words this is what you hear people say that you look sexy everybody clear and the third thing that we spoke with when the woman wear high heel because i here give a woman a temporary shape that she doesn't have i'm going to show you and demonstrate that to you by the scripture and by the chart and by the message of the hour anybody clear so he said last night after her what beauty this beauty is not the beauty of a good woman it is a beauty of an evil woman and we found out that when our oliver begin to cut the boys from the babylonian empire she changed her way of presenting herself before the people she begin to put more artificial upon her natural beauty in order to attract the man from another kingdom everybody clear last note after her beauty in your heart neither let her take you with her water with her eyelids in another translation those eyelids are called eyelashes everybody clear how can an eyelash of a woman attract you anybody clear when you look at this picture here this is an image of a eye of a woman there is two arrows right here this part on the top here is your eyelid anybody follow me then the hair that is all around there that's what we call the eye lashes amen but with technology and everything that happened today a woman can change this natural looking eye into something that looked like that anybody clear if you look at this eye is more brighter than the first one amen if you look at the eyelashes they are longer because a woman has put on eyelashes extension that's what you see women with long eyelashes that are not natural they're not doing that by any chances they're doing that because there is a power in the eye of a woman ever clear and if you look from a natural look of a woman on top right here there is a paint that has been painted in the eye so a holla and a holly bar move from the natural look of a woman into an artificial look of the woman in preparation to meet babylonian men in preparation to meet the people of the world you must go into the world and please them in other words they are not attracted by a natural woman they need to be attracted with a woman that is putting a lot of stuff on herself everybody clear so far brother branham say i am told that a snake can catch the eye of a bird and charm that bird with its enchantment and the stare of its water that's why brother branham referred many times that the eye of a woman that has been painted looked like a lizard and brother branham said that when he went into hell he's seen women with the painting of the eyes in other words the painting of the eyes originated from hell that's why when he went to jesse penny he saw the same thing that he saw in hell and brother branham said now hell is on earth in other words the influence of hell has been deposited onto the people and the people are manifesting not heaven but they are manifesting hell in vision everybody clear so far brother random say with its enchantment and the stare of his eyes until such a way if that bird will give the snake its water if you can only focus on the eyes of a woman that have changed her natural work into an artificial look if you look at hollywood they even have a tendency to change even the color of the eyes the eyes that you see on the picture of beyonce it is not the natural beyonce it is a beyonce that has been worked on because picture must be taken and put on the television to seduce men anybody clear if that bird will give the snake its attention for just a few minutes not an hour brother young brother just a few minutes you'd gone that bird will flutter and completely become water that's why you find yourself in trouble by staring at the wrong thing and the snake will take the bird brother branham say i can believe that because i know another water the old serpent the devil that if he can ever catch the eye with his enchantment with your modern rock and roll and all your fenders of the world if he can ever catch you young lady or young man just long enough to get his charm in you you shall flatter but you can't get loose he shall hold you until he swallow you up in water so it is an instrument that satan has used all along is to take a woman that is natural and to add an artificial something upon the woman in order to make the son of god to fail everybody clear the only way i am told that that little bird ever has a chance is to get his eyes watered off of the serpent and he cannot look at anything else because he stands staring but if he shall take his eyes from the serpent and look upward toward god and flatter his wings he shall flam plumb out of the rich of the word snake that's the reason why when you see something immoral you cannot focus on it you order medically if you are born with the spirit of god there is inside white dog will direct you away from it completely because it's meant to catch your attention and to draw you down a man that is filled with the holy spirit you cannot help to see a woman you cannot help to see a woman ill dress up there they're doing it you are not responsible for it but when you see something wrong automatically the holy ghost will take your head and move it away because the holy ghost knows that if you stare too long on that woman you're gonna flatter yourself and find yourself in trouble everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord so as we continue here brother branham the bible says this in psalm 139 this is what we expressed last week that for that has possessed my reign and that has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made everybody understand this now the reason why we went back to this principle is for you to understand that the natural way god created you is exactly beautiful in the eyes of god you must be proud of it you must cherish it you must take care of it and you cannot leave building complexes anything that will destroy the original image of god is something that is wrong david says for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous art that works and that my soul know it right well you need to know that my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrote in the lowest part of the earth then i did see my substance god saw you yet being on perfect and in that book all my members were written which incontinence were fashioned when as yet there was none of them in other words god has an image of you before even you were born how precious also are that thoughts and to me oh god how great is the sum of what all of them everybody cleared so far now we continue on isaiah here the bible says that but now that says the lord that created you because last week we found the principle of variety that he is the god of variety he's the god that makes some white some dark some light some blue it is his own prerogative and the reason why he did it he did it for his own pleasure and he did it for his own purpose and he did you unique as you are and there is nobody that can fit you or take your place now tonight now this morning we're going to add this now he said but now that saved the lord that created the o who jacob and he that formed thee oh if you look this one was a supplanter but this one was a redeem one you understand that this one was still stealing and doing all kind of stuff but this one was the one that was redeemed that got the mark of redemption oh israel fear not for i have worked because israel speaks about the redemptive name everybody clear i have called thee by name the earth mind god cleans you he's the one that went into cavalry he's the one that paid the price he paid the price of your debt you owe your life unto him that's why he's claiming you when the pastors through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow them the reason why the river are not overflowing you is not because you are strong the river are not overflowing you because god is with you amen it is god that is blocking the river the river are afraid of god they are not afraid of you when israel was going through the red sea he was the pillar of fire that looked at the red sea and the red sea opened up and israel went ahead when they were first derived from jordan it was still god that opened the jordan river that's why israel passed that's why he said i will be with you in other words no matter what temptation you're gonna go just remember though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will be with you my staff and my road they will comfort you god is always on time i will never leave you nor forsake you no matter how dark it is just remember i won't be there hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord they shall not overflow them when they are walking through water shadrach meshach abednego that shall not be what why because the fourth men enter into the fire ever clear that shall not be burned neither shall the fame clean cleaner upon thee why because i will be with you verse 4 since that was precious in my sight so the way god created you when god look at you you are precious in his eyes hallelujah since that was precious in my sight that has been water not only are you wonderfully made not only are you marvelously made but you are also precious into the eyes of god and you are also honorable so don't let nobody treat you cheap because the naked honors me hallelujah and i have loved it therefore i will give men for thee and people for that life even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for what god not only has created you unique not only did he created you for a purpose not only did he marvelous you made you and created you for his pleasure but he also created you for his glory what does that mean for i have created him for my glory i have found him yeah i have made him what is going on with the glory of god psalm 82 verse 1. a psalm of assad hallelujah god stand in the congregation of water so there is a congregation called the congregation of the money in other words everybody that is part of that congregation is married there is no weak link in that congregation are you there everybody in the congregation that god is is muddy that's why when he meet gideon he looked at him he said mighty man of valor did you look at his muscle he looked at his situation he said are you talking to me he said yes you just don't understand who you are amen god stands in the congregation of the mahdi he judges among the water so that congregation which member is an assembly it is a congregation and the member of that congregation almighty you follow me and those members not only are they mighty but they are gods 82 6 i have said yeah what who are those because the gods are the muddy they are in the congregation of god david said you are gods david give us more explanation who are those people come on say macallan or what and all of you are what so the children of god are you there oh the sons of god are gods you follow me not only are you unique not only are you marvelously made not only are you wonderfully made not only did he created you for a purpose for his pleasure for his glory you are actually a god [Applause] because son of god means what you remember on wednesday you remember wednesday it's on john 5 18. that's why when jesus was saying i am the son of god amen the jew pick up the stone and want to kill him they understood what he meant we are the gentiles that thought that he was a god and a son and a father and something like that you are gods and all of you are children of work they must hide let's go to john chapter 5 because not everybody was here on wednesday if you dare you can say amen hallelujah you know what job to 10 john chapter 10 this should break every complex in your life amen you're not here to please anybody you here to please god be proud of your nose the way god made your nose be proud of your eyes the way god made your eyes be proud of your heart because last week we seen zacchaeus and the other one some are like so some are like zacchaeus be proud of it amen john chapter 10 let's go to verse 30. i and my father are welcome amen then they choose two capstone again to stone him jesus answered them many good works have i showed you from my father for which of those words do you stone me in other words i did several miracles why do you want to kill me because i did something good verse 33 the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone you not we don't have any problem with you healing the people you can heal all the people we love the benefit but for blasphemy and because that you being a water jesus was 100 men yet 100 god because he was god in flesh you being a man just like me and you make yourself it is a problem for people human being to understand how can a natural man be god amen jesus answered them is he not written in your lord i said you are what jesus began to remind them of psalm 82 he said go back to psalm 82 and go over there you want to see that your law already says that we are god okay 35 if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say you of him whom the father has sanctified and send into the world you blaspheme because i said i am the water in other words you are trying to kill me you call the prophet gods and when i came i say i am the son of god you are trying to kill me go now to verse five chapter 5 let's see what the son of god means you there verse 18 john 5 18 therefore the jews sought them out to do what to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was what in other words god was his father i am the son of god amen karma making himself water equal with who a son of god means god and you are sons and daughters of god yeah gods are you there and when lucifer came to jesus he said if that be the son of god turn this water stone into water in other words a son of god have a power to turn a stone into bread a son of god have a power to create things oh my god let's go back now you are gods and all of you are children of the most high god he created you for his glory john chapter 1 verse 12 but as many as received him to them gave he water power to become waters even to them that believe on his which way not of blood not your natural birth not of the will of the flesh no of the will of men but born of what you are birthed by god and it's broad birth something what he brought is exactly like him [Applause] hallelujah and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behead his word in isaiah 43 he says i have created you for mine hallelujah we behead his glory their glory as of their only water begotten of the father so when jesus came jesus was reflecting the glory of god john chapter 17 verse four and five i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which that gave us me to do and now oh what do what glorify them me with thy own self with the which i had with thee before the world in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was the glory that i was with you at the beginning father give me the glory and let that glory be manifested and god have created you and me for his glory [Applause] [Music] if christ have a glory where do we get our glory john chapter 17 verse 22 amen and the glory which died can you read it again and the glory which that gave us me i have done what that they may be even as we are so that glory that was in christ has also been poured into the church because all that was in god was poor in christ and all that was in christ was boy into the church i have created you to display my glory just like jesus displaying my glory [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord what know you not that your what is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not your own for you are but with what therefore you understand now you understand now you are living into the world 50 black dog 50 black dog completely lost i came i claim you the reason why i claim you is to explain to you that i created you the way you are because i want to express myself through you i created you for my pleasure i created you unique i created you for a purpose and i created you for my glory and by giving you the holy ghost i have poured my glory into you so therefore glorify me in your body [Music] amen hallelujah glorify god in your word and in your spirit with your work all belongs to me but i want your body to glorify me i want you when you walk when people look at your body your body is bringing glory to me i want your work to bring glory to me i want your tough to bring glory to me i want your behavior to bring glory to me i want your clothing to bring glory to me i want your beauty to bring glory to me i want all of you to bring glory to me hallelujah when people see you they must glorify god that's why paul said we are written epistle when somebody look at you they say god we praise you we praise you for that man we praise you for a honest boy we praise you for a honest man we praise you for a honest girl we praise you for a honest employee she's polite she's good she's always on time she doesn't cut she doesn't do anything like anybody else you glorify god with your life amen blessed be the name of the lord ephesians 2 verse 10 for we are his water we are his masterpiece created in christ jesus unto what so you are created marvelously wonderfully made unique for a purpose for god's own pleasure for his glory to do what to bring good works to bring good works we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before or then that we should do what you don't have to manufacture work god have certain things that he put on his agenda and he said i have one two three four for brother hamilton so when he's creating brad hamilton he's designing him carefully wonderfully masterfully unique to match the agenda the personal agenda he has for brother hamilton are you there so when brother hamilton is redeemed by god he needs to put his car in new job and let the holy spirit begin to take the agenda and manifest that in his life i do nothing except what the father shows me i don't grow beyond my agenda are you there i am doing nothing except what the agenda is telling me that's why when they asked him when are you coming jesus look at the agenda he said according to the ministry of the sun the agenda saying the sun cannot disclose the day of the rupture i cannot tell you wait when i go to my father that's when i will do that but under this agenda it is not written so i cannot go beyond the agenda so when you are not glorifying god in your body you actually blocking his agenda hallelujah romans 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that he presents your what why is paul insisting on the body sister why is paul insisting of the body because your body can give a different signal is that signal glorifying god are you there present your body a living water sacrifice that is what and what so the way you present yourself must be acceptable by god the way you present yourself must express holiness the way you express yourself cannot turn the spirit of lust upon someone because lust is not holiness everybody present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is a reasonable surface and be not confirmed to this water what is the world to me you came out of gaudy you came out of babylon you came out of egypt you came out of the hidden when you are in the promised land do not be conformed again to where you come from because we are in the world but we are not of the world because we have been with him out yet we're still living in the world but be not conformed with the world everybody clear but be transformed by the renewing of your man that he may prove what is good and what and what perfect will of who blessed be the name of the lord world don't act like the world you must have a fame among the hidden but do not copy them don't act like the hidden the unbelievers don't yourself with them come out from among them don't be this way if you love the world or the things of the world the what i'm dropping now slowly into the channel the fashion the word comes from the greek word cosmos which means the water that's why paul said be not conformed to the world be not conformed to the fashion of the world because the fashion of the world are driven by lucifer to glorify lucifer to express hell on earth have and also want to express on earth which means the fashion of the world if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you yet you have never been water you still have a black dog on your soul now the word there is not earth the word there is not earth it's a greek word is cosmos which means the water the world order if we love the fashion of the earth the world if we love the weather the trend of the day are you following me there is a reason why certain things are popular in a certain time are you there they might be popular two years ago and they are not popular today lucifer is driving his agenda and paul is saying be careful when you see something popular amongst the people don't get sucked up quickly because you might be glorifying the devil unconsciously are you there why are men living bird beard all around they use not why is everybody doing that why is everybody having hair they don't want to calm down why they didn't have it five years ago why when he started by a hip-hop star he goes all around what trigger that hip hop star what trigger that rock and roll man to dress himself a certain way and the entire country all the way to africa everybody is on page since when a yellow hair looks good on a woman since when a pink hair looked good on a woman but after a while women begin to put blue hair and if you don't understand what lucifer is doing you can get sucked because everybody's doing that and you begin to worship the devil if we love that trend of the day leave your build because you want to live it but don't leave it because everybody's living it because you don't know what everybody's doing are you following me don't catch your hair like everybody because you don't know what it means if we think this is a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it is perverted by the devil for if we love the world and the things of this present world they're not going to judge you for philadelphia they are judging you for this time amen it is because the love of god is not even in you remember that oh god look what we are looking into what are you copying amen hallelujah my god let's go now to genesis and let's drive this one let's go to genesis chapter 3 praise the name of the lord now we in the channel if you're there you can say amen genesis chapter 3 verse 4 and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely water so who's a liar he's making god a liar god said you shall die and the serpent said you shall not die hebrew chapter 6 verse 18. that by two immutable things come up in which it was can you read that impossible for god to do what we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set beside us before us that's why when god gives you a promise it must happen because god cannot lie here is something that is impossible to god god cannot lie titus 1 verse 2 in hope of eternal life which god karma that cannot number 23 19 god is not a man that he should watch how dare lucifer you can say that you shall should not surely die let's go back to verse four and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for god knows that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as what in psalm 83 there is a credit to there is a congregation of the mahdi those mighty are gods they are the children of god because the children of god are gods and in genesis 1 26 man was created in the image and the likeness of god adam and eve were already god [Applause] but lucifer want to give them another deity how can you make me god when i'm already god are you there there were gods and he said your eyes will be open you will be like god how can you make me god when i'm already god i am a woman you say i'm gonna make you a woman i'm a man i'm gonna make you a man what do you mean about making me amen [Music] hallelujah and you shall be as god knowing what good and what according to lucifer the definition of god is to know good and water what is good and evil what is good and evil go to genesis 2 verse 9 give me my time please because i'm in a channel let's go to genesis 2 verse 9. and out of the ground made the lord god to go to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for water and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of what there is a knowing that tree you see no knowledge everybody clear no knowledge the tree of no knowledge the tree of knowledge of water and water the tree of knowledge of good and water let's go back to where we were you there verse 5 for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as what knowing what in other words your deity will be abiding on the forbidden tree because the knowledge of good and evil comes from the wrong tree and your deity will be perverted into good and evil instead of eternal life the tree of life are you following me job to verse 6 and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that he was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired it caused lust to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did it and gave to her husband with her and he did it let's see now that we stopped so now the wise now they know now they've grown up now they mature now they can take their own life nobody can tell them nothing right and the eyes of them both were what open to what so when your wives are open you begin to see vision when your eyes are open you begin to see heaven open what are you seeing when your eyes are open when you touch that when your eyes are open what do you see and they knew that there were water the first thing that we did is automatically hey hey go behind the bushes move up i thought you were god now you are god they give you a good deity naturally you didn't appreciate it you wanted more than what god gave you now you got it now you're in trouble they were naked and they did water soft fig lives together and made themselves water so the knowledge of the fig leaves is a knowledge that comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil this manufacturing of men doesn't come from the wisdom of god man took a bite in the wrong tree and the wrong tree inspired man to begin to make his own clothing are you there and his clothing was only concerned about his private part that he think is a shame to be exposed can i repeat it again the man manufacturer that came from the tree of life to dress up to cover nakedness only insists on the part that men feel like he is a shame when the women are on the beach they only cover two parts follow me the manufacturer tells them if you cover your breasts and if you cover your prophet everything else can be hanging out it's not gonna do anything then god came down to investigate the manufacture of a man hallelujah let me jump let me skip this one the manufacture of a man the average woman today is back in fig leaves just like eve was a fig leaf is actually a man-made system shorts smoking bob hair yet attractive what they do it for to appear to the husband if they do then he is not the son of god he is er if what you doing is to please your husband then your husband is still having a demon of lust upon him that's why he tells you wear tight dresses to satisfy his lust on the street and then if he is the son of god he shall tell you wash your face and put on some clothes in other words this doesn't look good he's your husband it's not that you are not attractive but something is telling him this is not the appropriate way for you to dress hallelujah finally they come to worry just a fig leaf and if you notice in last month life magazine they had the woman with a fig leaves on no wonder jesus when he came on earth brother greg he walked and he saw a fig tree and the fig tree was not in his own mouth because if the fig tree was in the mouth of fruit jesus could see the fruit adam never used the fruit of the tree adam only used the leaves of the tree so christ made sure that when he goes he spared the fruit but he cursed the leaf showing you that i am against what men use to cover themselves up are you there and that is the new evening frog oh god what they wear of the evening it is how how can the fig tree help you to be your clothes how long is that gonna last it's gonna dry up are you there transparent can see what that's why a sister should never wear a dress that people can see through only the fig leaves just hide a certain part of her body with strapless or strap and strap bathing what the top of it exposed what that's the manufacturing of a man anybody following me praise the name of the lord let's go back to genesis now verse 3 chapter 3 jump to verse 8 and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden of the cool of the day and adam his wife and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord if they were clothes why did they hide themselves are you there if you were clothed why did you hit yourself because they knew that that clothes cannot stand in the presence of god amen job to verse 21 to adam also and to his wife so the dress code from god is not only for women it is for women and men are you there young man this is also for you he said and to adam and to his wife did the lord makes water that's a different manufacture made coat of skin and deep water now god is clothing the entire body for a purpose the first material used by men was fig leaves and god cursed that but when god used material to cover his children he used a skin of something brother branham say he was a skin of a lamb where is he written in the bible did brother branham lie you got trained enough on that one right where is he written in the bible that it's a skin of the lamb go to proverbs 27 when the prophet says something even though you don't know it say amen and move in peace amen because one of this day you will see it somewhere amen 27 if you're there you can say amen proverbs 27 verse 26 everybody there everybody there proverbs 27 verse 26. okay somebody is already crying and screaming right right right did you see it do you want to read together or you saw it lamps are for your water did brother brother never give you that scripture the message is perfectly in line with the scripture perfectly lamps are for your clothing and the goats are the price of the water so god use a lambo kill the lamb and clothed his children get this now the manufacturer of a man was a fig leaf that can look green today it just dropped and after a while it's gonna be drying you follow me and you're gonna take it and throw it away did you get it it is a manufacture of season you follow me it is a trend of the day it comes everybody wear it then we forget about it then you go get a new one that's why jesse penny dealer all of them makes money because it's a manufacturer of a man it's a seasonal he looks green everybody like it because he still have life on it after a while it is no more green it is now grayish then you throw it in salvation army then he brings you another green and then you back again to the cell store a manufacturer of sell sell sell sell sell sell green going green going green going that just dropped from heaven you ready but the manufacturing of god was not a leaf but a lamb you follow me and when john the baptist saw jesus coming john said behold the lamb of god are you there that do what take away the sin of the world the clothing of god has a message on itself [Applause] you follow me the clothing of god reflects the glory of god you understand how you are created for his glory and the clothing he is going to put on you also speak of him do you follow me he is the lamb when people look at you they see the lamb when you walk you walking flat flap is speaking about the lamb that guy a lamb without that a lamb that died a lamb that died a lamb that died a lamb that your clothing is showing the sacrifice that took your place your clothing have a message your clothing is preaching someone your clothing when somebody look at you they feel condemned are you there are you there when sister you are walking when other women look at you you make them feel guilty you make them become like you you make them seek the lamb you make them seek the same god that you have your clothing speaks of himself it is the covering of the lamb are you there when king ahazarest said seven chamberlain you remember that to get the queen what was the last chamberlain called carcass what did he mean the covering of the of the lamb are you there and we seen that that spoke of the constellation of what seven ninja that came down and the seventh one was the one that have a chest up and he was the message it's a message that come to restore the proper attire of a woman that's why the message of the hour is giving women instruction how to dress because it's a message that brings the covering of the lamb back again [Applause] brother branham is hard on women he's not hard on women the commission is the lamb must be properly exposed so go ahead and correct their dressing because laodicea is naked and does not know it that's why i gotta send a message to remind them that women should wear things like this hallelujah we found women in these days pushed for beauty it is a natural thing for a woman to test to be pretty that is her god-given instinct and her beauty that god gave her for her mate husband and now we found out that women want to be that way why is it it's just because it's something god gave her it is not wrong for women to be praying they should be now the true test that a woman should have will be to adorn herself in water modest apparel the word more they speak of decency we're going to get that down deep deep deep maybe not today and to have a christ-like spirit festivity 2-9 i'm going to get into that later now that's the way the woman should start to be now if you want to be pretty that's the way what makes you pretty it's a crush like water and a dawn in water so your attraction is not from from your clothing it is coming from an atmosphere that you have we're going to get to that always i have been accused of being hard on sisters about wearing bob hair and manicure all over the face and stuff i have always been accused of being hard on the system and it is not that i got anything against them i don't say the woman is not a good woman that she is a street walker or something that is not my attitude but it's this when she put so much water on the water you are going back to the leaf tree artificial is something that is not natural it's something that take more attention they're natural filled on facebook so there is a lot of artificial on the inside where or to be filled up with crust because the outside always express what is what by their fruit you shall know them you see where christ ought to be there and to take care for god to care for the other thing instead of so much artificial pump and you know green water we see that in the scripture and on human looking and all that kind of stuff i just don't go for it i don't believe the bible does either so i like to be just what we okay let's get to it let's go to jeremiah 4 let's touch one finally we got here god created you to manifest his glory too much artificial you are destroying the glory that he made too much artificial you actually destroying his glory let's go to jeremiah chapter four remember the first thing the eyelid remember they painted the eyelid they were not happy the way they were looking they have to put something on the eyelid that makes them different than what god created if god wanted your eyelid to be red he would have made it here if god wanted you to have blue eyes he would have created you with blue eyes if god wanted your eyes to be slanted he would have created you that way right that's what michael jackson missed when he had to change his noise insulting god jeremiah chapter 4 verse 30. are you there jeremiah 4 30. everybody clear and when you are spoiled what will you do don't you clothe yourself with crimson don't you deck you with ornaments of gold don't you wrench your face with what number one it was the painting of the eyes by scripture we gave it to you so don't say there is no scripture again people leaving the message as soon as they leave the message painting eyes never understood the scripture they thought we say don't penetrate brother branham say brother branham say so i leave the message i paint my eyes brother branham saw that in the bible so if you want to go back to the bible why do you paint yours you leave the message you paint your eye you still against the bible confusion confusion don't know they thought it was message being pentedized don't penetrate so when i'm outside the message i can pentax message mean painted and not painted eyes because the bible says no pentagons [Applause] message saying no painting face because the bible say no painting face so if you say you're going back to the bible why don't you stick with the bible never taught ever learning never come to the knowledge rent don't you rent that word means cover if somebody have another translation you will see what it means don't you cover your face with what painting in vain shall you make yourself what beautiful so they were covering painting their face to make themselves beautiful while god already created you now we okay now we okay i know some of you are rob pretty tough but stephen what about if i'm burning my face we can handle that you're not burning i know it's coming spinning though you wrench your face with painting in van shall you make yourself fair for who for me god let me go back again if you're tired we stop we're going to catch up you ready don't you make yourself a god i'm gonna drive this so you see where the message is coming from and you're gonna understand when we tell you things when brad branham says something it is not like brother branham was sleeping and wake up and just tell you something i don't know because faith must have a foundation and the foundation must be in the world are you there he said don't you cover your face with plenty come on in then shall you make yourself beautiful fair your lover will do whatever so this woman is painting herself to make herself beautiful for her lovers you okay remember a holy boy made herself beautiful by painting her eyes for her lovers do you understand so when you are painting your eyes when you are painting your face to make yourself different it is in the bible interpreting that you are doing that to attract attention of your lovers lord help me the next come he's a little boy he was standing there he was a water a zulu how can you make your face all the time you paint your face and tomorrow your boyfriend don't like you anymore and he goes and find another one the bible says your boyfriend will hate you they cut their ear like this and make great in other words they are deforming their natural appearance that god made them they are hidden remember hidden long things they wear a lot of what they do women wear a lot of water pain so you women that like to put on pain you know where it comes from it is a hidden did he give you a scripture that is exactly right keep it off of you it is not becoming to christian congregation do what okay the bible says brother brown i'm safe thank you i just wondering i was just wondering when i first known the pentecostal people a few years ago they didn't use them things but something happened somewhere is that right what's going on brother brandon help me more by the way speaking of that paint on the face you pentecostal women used to not do that what happened i'm just asking you what happened you did run well what hindered you did your pulpit get weak you see when a puppet gets weak what he does back to painting then put him out and get a pastor will preach the truth if your denomination let you down get another denomination in other words go to another church certainly little sister i don't mean to hurt you i just come back from where and in there that is hidden water the hotento of africa that is where the painting comes from from water it is a sign of what he then is made is condemned by who where did brother branham tell you god condemn it a predefense and what god looked for it is a pretty soul that he looks for hallelujah i said how can i teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs certainly how can you do that such a conglomeration of sin the mark of it shows anyone knows that paint is a heated water i'm a missionary hidden pet the indian painted their face here in arizona before they know the god they ever know to god you don't have to tell them no a burden they take it off shows they are at war with god when they take it off shows they are at peace with god in other words as long as they have not made peace with god they will continue to wear it you follow me go to second king chapter 9 don't say again i don't have a scripture for it somebody come and tell you you women you're in bondage you message women you're in bondage look at us we are free don't give him a coat tell him open your bible just use the same code he used and hook him right there amen second king chapter nine if you're there you can say amen i'm gonna drive couple and probably we stop here because if i get to high heel it's gonna be tough amen forget to hide here many of you will throw them away i preached last week or the week before there was a woman who is not a united states got a hold of her sermon she's in europe she went and took all her tight dress and throw it away in europe she was streaming second king verse 9 chapter 9 verse 30. if you're there you can say amen and then and when jehu was come to jezreel second scripture who who want to be jezebel who does not want to be jesus christ okay so let me see what jesus did and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it jezebel heard that a man is coming amen can i start again a holy birth sent a message when men were coming she washed herself and she painted her face for men jeremiah 4 where we saw god say you make beautiful yourself you are painting your face because men are coming when jezebel heard that men are coming what did she do you see now you see now when you paint your face you see what you are telling the world except you have a very strong reason that we can sit and talk because a woman want to make herself beautiful anybody clear brother stephen can i have an appointment quick that's it let's go jessa had heard of it and she painted why when they told her a man the governor is coming automatically the first thing why you didn't do that when he was not there what was the purpose of that a holy but why do you have to do this amen she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at the window and as jihoo entered into the gate she said exemple peace there is a key there who slew his master if you read the book of the king you will understand what it means and he lift up his face to the window and say who is on my side who and dare look out to him two or three eunuchs anybody clear when jezebel painted her face she went and stick her face to the window she put her face into a profile on facebook amen you see everything is in the scripture she went into a what window an internet window you didn't do it when you look natural you have to paint yourself and brush your picture then you stick it to the window do you think we don't understand the message you want us to say click click click right when she did that jihu when he was coming he was playing he clicked his window he saw jesus he said oh that's a beautiful woman she's better than message believers jesus said who is on the lord's side take her through heaven the king she did it for men she didn't have let her natural beauty the glory of god reflecting in her to attract the husband and you do it to attract the wrong one anybody clear jezebel tired her head because the bible said she painted her face and she did what tired ahead what does it mean jezebel tired her hair which was what in the scripture in the scripture not only did she painted her eyes she cut her hair if you want to stick with the bible you left the message why do you catch your hair roll it up tired her hair which is a disgrace a woman that cuts her dishonor her husband the bible said so a dissonant a dishonorable woman should be divorced and put away so that's a sign that showed that she loves somebody what because every time it is put it is always in the scripture for men when you doing that god is interpreting that that you're looking for somebody else to the baba because she dishonor her husband when she does it you know that's the bible how many knows so raise up your hand all of you that know the bible says that then what do you do it for that's what i wonder i wonder why do why you do it because your pastor probably never said anything different but we need some strict old-fashioned evangelistic what that shall do what okay amen blessed be the name of like jezebel had learned one things in a home that was to use paints that a hidden treat any paint never in the world but all painting of face originated with hidden it's always condemned by believers i hope this goes real far down home just to make you real good and sick for a few minutes everybody clear let me skip this and then i'm going to go to the airport so she was used so she was used to painting she made herself a little butterfly and brother that's the khan that can jilt in many good man that's why she stick her face in the window that's right see damn on the street with a little lip look like a rosebud and a whole lot of much faster on it but that shall never burn out the sin wrinkle don't you never think that god looks right through it and so jezebel knowed how to put it on to make it look she put and so when ahab the one playing in the church this young jewish man become king she put manicure on her water and whatever you call it you know and she flap them back and forth i don't want to do it and ahab's heart went humbling god bless you because she didn't he didn't have god in there to teach him better that's right what a thing that was amen now when she began to flirt with ahab i have married her he thought that is the just one for me and many men made a mistake like that and many man has done it young people you ready young people you ready young man you ought to see her on the watch today say amen brother branham said god see her when she is natural because that's what you're gonna live with it the rest of your life you're not gonna live with that beautiful picture of facebook let them appreciate you the way you are you ought to see her on watch day or when she gets cleaned up really might change your mind together oh are you there there was a young man he taught me that he saw a woman talk to you they gave him a picture he took a ticket and one day in united state amen he got to the airport the sister came with her younger sister because she cannot be there by herself are you there when the boy dropped at the airport he looked at that woman he turned his face he began to talk more to the younger sister than the one he was looking for until the lady got mad and said did you come for her or for me because the picture he had was not reflecting what she was actually saying you are deceiving yourself in your mind with your facebook really might change your mind on together women should not be married by looks anywhere but by what let me tell you boy if you marry her and she's all painted up one on this day she shall fade even if she's pretty that shall fail one of these days wait till her first baby's born and the thief won't go to coming out she got to see brother stephen leader and lord on ray goes on come over her eyes and her girl get gray you will wake up one morning and wonder what you want brother steven say that's right i meant that not for joke no sir that is true i am just laying a background here for something i want to say see that's right but if you love her because there is something about her that you have prayed over and god has joined you together she can get older and wrinkle and be ugly that will make a bit of difference you shall love her through what that's the marriage we want that's what we want to direct you are you there you don't know when she's gonna get sick you don't know when they're gonna perform a surgery on her what are you going to do brother brother do you mean to tell me that you believe it's wrong for a woman to wear some all over her lips and i say there was one in the bible that did it a woman never did what paint her face to meet what a holy but did it to meet men jeremiah 4 to meet men jezebel to meet men where did brother brother get that never her face to meet god she painted her face to meet men and that was jezebel jezebel painted her face and put the wrong tire around her and went out to meet who when you're doing it the old mothers will tell you that young lady begin to seek attraction from boys the old mothers will tell you that that's right you will hear them that's how they knew my sister called me up after this after this service and she said he must not have been nobody else it must have been just to me i say to her husband junior say what do you think oh he said i heard brother branham do better than that she said that i was sure it's all come to me in other words brother brother preacher sermon and this sister his sister went home and said you know what brother branham preached everything he preached was about me and he was talking to his uh to her husband when brother brother continued he said i believe she's back there oh i will tell it on her but i just let it go dolores where are you at she's not here well i tell it today she said i've been guilty of using just a little bit you know makeup carrying just a little bit say that is over but the bottom says she realized she was not dead yet you see you got to die amen those things such as dancing card party playing bobbing your hair painting your lips manicuring your face and all of that is the attribute of what that hurts pentecost but that's what is good for you brother that's right could not walk the old straight narrow path just like a hog going to its wallow going back to the counties are you there as a dog to its vomit from the counties that is where the pentecostal church has returned that's right don't hear very many amen but i tell you brother it is the honest to goodness truth you better go back to the path again do your

kingdom are you awake if not i want to stop and bring this when you're fresh you ready from man and your dwelling shall be with the beast of the field in other words they took him for a human being

because you begin to think like an animal and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the most high rules in the kingdom of men and give it to whomsoever he will you ready watch now verse 33 the same hour body was wet with the dew of heaven till his water where what like eagles what young people where do you get hair like feathers today do you see what you copy you see all the african even the caucasian they have hairstyle with her that are not calm they look like feathers it happened to this king when he got a demon on him you are actually reflecting demonic kingdom in your body it is not glorifying god i'm bringing description let's continue and these hair were grown like ego feathers you remember nebuchadnezzar was a man because the hair of a man is not supposed to grow it's not supposed to have hair that looks like feathers it looks like it's not combed properly and the hip-hop star put it and every young people nowadays heaven do you see where it comes from and the women call that beautiful that's right so you are actually condoning with demons oh it's the drip shame on you till his hair were grown like eagle's feathers and his nail like water what came on nebuchadnezzar for his nail to grow and his hair to be like feathers oh my god brother brother now there is a place where you get this amnesia you might not get it like nebuchadnezzar who exalted himself one time and god let him think he was a what when you thinking like animal that's what causing this let me continue he lived out in the wilderness and eat grass like ox and his hair grow down like down his body like ego feathers and he had become the heart of a beast in him that was amnesia because he had forgotten that he was a king he had forgotten that he was a human being and he thought he was a water and so he acted like what because he forgot he was a human being remember that therefore was a beast go to deuteronomy 21 probably that's the last scripture of nails deuteronomy chapter 21. you want to grow now you know what it means you know what it means detroit number 21. if you dare you can say amen verse 10 when you go forth to war against your water this is israel going to war against the hidden because the only believer were the jews you understand and the lord your god has delivered them into your hand and you have taken them captive and see among the gap the captive award so when you go you fight the nation you believers and when you overcome the nation you jewish people and you carry captive and among those captive they are women and when you look among the women you find one that is beautiful and you want to get married to her what does god say to israel you get and captive a beautiful woman and have a desire to her that you should have her to your wife verse 12 then you shall bring her home to your house and she shall save her what why is she shaving her hair the very look that she have is a gentile hidden look she cannot enter that in the congregation of israel you understand come on shave her head and pear pear means to trim right and trim her what it was the hidden women that were keeping long nails not believers sister catch your name you are portraying hidden you are glorifying hell you are not glorifying god especially the younger one the one that get married look at the picture nail like this you are actually reflecting a hidden kingdom catch a nail and i'm going to finish if she has not got any fingernail and want to put someone if she has not got any teeth and needs some have not got any arm and you need one and have not got hay and you need some you have not got this that is different if you don't have now and you want to put a nail brother branham say that's okay but don't put nail on top of your natural nail if you're missing teeth you want to have teeth brother brother i'm saying that's okay if your hair is completely messed up it doesn't look good you want to add more hair to make you look natural brother branham say that's okay but when you pull out your real good teeth you see the problem you are now destroying the natural beauty of god because you just want because you just because they are just not as bright as they should be then you done wrong you follow me if you got red hair and you want black and you go down here and color it black just because you done wrong if your hair black keep it black don't put pink hair when your hair are black yeah i think so but the main thing there is no scripture for that only to bob your hair there is scripture for that yeah had plenty of that so then we want to make sure that is right where is it no i cannot get to this that's for next time that's for next time let me get this oh my god no i cannot get that we got to stop here let's stand there is another quote that i wanted to show you lord's willing next sunday i will give it to you brother branham said the reason why hair grew the reason why nabuchadnezzar have long nail because he was possessed of a demon that's the code when you wear long nail the scripture interpreted that it's a spirit you under a spirit you don't understand next time lord's willing i will back up a little bit on this and then we're going to get and show you what how heal does even to your body it's going to destroy you it's going to destroy your muscles it's going to affect your womb it's going to affect your womb and you're going to have trouble let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us thank you thank you lord

identity we are losing our own appreciation of what we are we feel like we don't look good the way you created us until we have to put stuff artificial things to please people on the outside not knowing that we are not reflecting heaven but we are reflecting the kingdom of darkness father and they are young men looking at this probably through ignorance what they were calling beautiful they didn't know that it was not a reflection of what is holy acceptable and good in your sight that they should not be looking at women that portray themselves like that they should not being attracted with any woman that is showing herself and putting more artificial lord because it's reflecting that something in the soul is not right with you father may you give a discernment may you help this church may you help the young sister may you help the young brother may you help the family to understand lord that this is not a code of law this is not a code of ethic but this is the unfailing body word of the son of man coming to clean up the life of your children so that we can reflect and glorify you in our body and in our spirit and bring our body to be living sacrifice unto thee so that when people look they can have a message whole preach just by the way we portray ourselves in front of the children father we commit everything unto the hand we thank you for all and ask it in the

your easter maybe get you a fine meal today or just enjoy the sunshine and especially enjoy the family and meditate on this word hallelujah amen let's bow heads and our hearts please dear lord we come once again lord with thanksgiving in our hearts lord jesus and lord we thank you for the freedom that you've given us in this hour lord your word is declared who the son has set free is free indeed lord god and we appreciate that this morning lord god there's a lot of people in bondage and don't even realize they're in bondage but lord god you've just given us a word in this hour lord by your grace and it's only by your grace the lord god we don't have to have that testimony in our lives and lord as we go from this place this afternoon lord we pray that the things that we've heard lord let it find good ground in our hearts lord god and don't let it as they say come in one ear and go out the other lord god but lord may it find a resting place oh god that it may bring forth the fruit that you've ordained to bring forth in this hour lord we commit each one of your hands grant each one traveling mercy let each one get to his or her destination safely until we can meet again in your precious name jesus christ we pray amen amen [Music] hold on let me find that again now i am climbing higher each day darkness of moon has drifted away my feet are playing
