[29:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, we can get all
[29:31] excited and tore up and singing and
[29:34] praising God here, but we don't I mean,
[29:35] I don't even think that's a drop in the
[29:37] bucket for what we're going to
[29:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're going to have to have a
[29:41] special kind of energy,
[29:43] &gt;&gt; you know, and a special anointing just
[29:46] to just to stand there in his presence
[29:48] and just worship him. He's here now. I
[29:51] mean, we
[29:52] &gt;&gt; we know he's here. Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; I don't have any praise reports this
[29:56] morning or any prayer requests at all.
[30:00] Um I'm going to ask brother Smiling if
[30:02] he might come up and lead us in a prayer
[30:05] uh over some unspoken this morning.
[30:08] Amen. I'm sure we got something on our
[30:10] heart that maybe, you know, only we only
[30:13] share with God. And uh Yes, ma'am.
[30:18] Oh, yes.
[30:19] Yes. I want to bring my wife's mom up.
[30:22] She's they're they're she's one of 11
[30:26] siblings on her generation, her mom,
[30:29] and most of them have died from uh
[30:31] strokes, really bad strokes. She's got
[30:33] one sister that I that I know is still
[30:36] like in a a nursing home. And uh they
[30:40] keep hitting my mother-in-law and she's
[30:42] to the point now, you know, where she
[30:45] can't walk anymore and she can't talk.
[30:47] and her dad is 97. Her mom's about 89 or
[30:52] 90 or something like that. And it's just
[30:54] putting a tremendous, you know, a
[30:57] challenge on the family. Um because, you
[31:00] know, there's only a few sisters around.
[31:02] The brothers, you know, they help when
[31:04] they can, but um we want to lift her up,
[31:07] you know, before the Lord today as a
[31:09] congregation as well. Her name is Henry.
[31:12] It's Henrietta, but it's Henri Keta in
[31:14] Spanish. So, I always thought it was a
[31:16] really pretty name.
[31:18] And she raised seven children. None are
[31:21] drug act drug addicts. Nothing, you
[31:24] know, they're all good children and they
[31:27] they do their best they can for her. Um,
[31:31] but she needs help or she needs to go on
[31:33] to the Lord or whatever it is. You know,
[31:35] we're just asking for God's will. So, if
[31:37] you can remember her. Yes, sir. Brother,
[31:41] your grandfather. This is the original
[31:43] Charles Hamilton. Correct. Amen. Amen.
[31:49] Amen. There's something special about
[31:50] him. Y'all want to name everybody after
[31:53] him. Praise God. So we'll remember him
[31:56] as well, brother. Amen. Thank you,
[31:58] brother Smith. God bless. Let us bow.

[36:41] like, let's try to sing. I was trying to
[36:43] get other people to sing it for me, but
[36:45] the Lord God chose for me to lead it. So

[52:08] welcome to spoken word tabernacle where
[52:11] the message of brother brandam is so
[52:13] much appreciated and it's yummy. Amen.
[52:17] I was going through this and if you look
[52:20] the way the Holy Spirit I believe I was
[52:22] working and then when I work I meditate
[52:26] and I'm working I'm meditating and I'm
[52:29] praying and suddenly he open up again
[52:32] and then when I look I say oh my god I
[52:36] never seen anybody who so zeroed in with
[52:40] the scripture like brother Brham
[52:43] &gt;&gt; in other words things brother Brham will
[52:44] say later on you look They're coming
[52:47] straight from the Bible clear. And it's
[52:50] it's impossible for a man
[52:52] &gt;&gt; to put things that way.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It must be God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; The message and the Bible are one.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; If God gave me time, we will go through
[53:06] the scripture and you will be amazed how
[53:08] things brother Brandham spoke here and
[53:10] how it looks like when they were writing
[53:12] the Bible, brother Brandham was sitting
[53:14] there. That's it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, I'm loaded.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; My microphone is loaded for 8 hours and
[53:24] 8 minutes
[53:26] &gt;&gt; and the material that is here can go
[53:28] beyond that.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; So say amen and we can move forward.
[53:33] Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I believe we are all up to
[53:37] date with the sermon. We are reading our
[53:39] Bible twice a day. our cood church ages
[53:43] 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or
[53:47] somebody is listening to the message of
[53:49] the hour. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Yesterday we had a wonderful young
[53:52] sisters meeting all the way to what 8:00
[53:56] &gt;&gt; and was it 8:00 brother Glenn?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; 8:00 until there were no more question.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; So everything is clear.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And the quote you ask me I put the quote
[54:08] around 1:00 a.m. or something. You got
[54:11] the quote. We clear so far.
[54:16] They they even asked me to put some of
[54:18] the quotes right here
[54:20] so the whole world will know what is
[54:22] going on because it was about man not
[54:25] being romantic in the message.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Let me leave it alone.
[54:41] When I thought about it, I realized all
[54:44] the quotes were given in the married
[54:46] couple meeting.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; So I say, you know what, every material
[54:49] is already loaded for you in a married
[54:52] couple meeting. So once you get into
[54:54] that material, you will retrieve
[54:56] everything. Brother Brandham spoke about
[54:58] bringing flowers. Brother Brandham spoke
[55:01] about buying a trinket.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; I have the code. Brother Brandham said
[55:06] whenever he travel he will get a little
[55:08] trinket for his wife.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham bought perfume for his
[55:12] wife.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; An expensive perfume.
[55:15] [Music]
[55:16] &gt;&gt; I can continue on and on and on and on.
[55:19] So every material everything all the
[55:22] detail the scripture they quote are in a
[55:25] married couple meeting.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And I will encourage young men before
[55:29] you get married make sure you sit down.
[55:34] Young men, before you get married,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; make sure you sit down and listen to the
[55:41] married couple meeting so you know how
[55:43] to handle a sister in the message in a
[55:46] godly way and still be romantic like
[55:49] brother Brana.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. and
[55:59] &gt;&gt; and you who are streaming and looking at
[56:02] the sisters here.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Ah
[56:08] you who are streaming and have an intent
[56:11] to come to this church to fish.
[56:14] Make sure before you get our sister from
[56:17] this church, sit down and listen to 20
[56:20] hours of married couple meeting so we
[56:24] make sure our sister is taken care of
[56:26] well.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] So young sister, tell your husband,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; your future husband,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; if he didn't go through the training
[56:42] here, tell him that you know what, get a
[56:44] weekend, come and sit down here.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; It's free without money, without price.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Come and sit down. We will load you, put
[56:53] a big screen before you and tell you to
[56:56] go through this. It's I got scripture,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; I got quotes. What I gave you yesterday
[57:03] is just the surface.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; If you get into a married couple
[57:07] meeting, it will blow your mind up.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I don't put them
[57:11] on YouTube.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But I got a quote and I got a scripture
[57:14] for everything that I gave it to you.
[57:16] It's right there. Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; So tell them to sit down and get some
[57:20] instruction to know what to do. Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say you cannot
[57:26] get blood out of a turnip
[57:29] &gt;&gt; because there is no blood in turnip.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; So I don't want turnip to mary's young
[57:33] sisters here.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Come and get the blood transfusion first
[57:38] and make sure you got the blood so you
[57:40] know how to give the blood.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no excuse for rough marriages
[57:52] &gt;&gt; because some are hiding under the name
[57:54] of culture.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Our culture, our culture is the message
[58:01] of Yahweh.
[58:05] Let me start it again because now we
[58:08] getting warmed up pretty good. The
[58:11] culture of this church is not an African
[58:14] culture. It's not an American culture.
[58:18] It's not a European culture. The culture
[58:21] in this church is the message of the
[58:23] hour. Just like brother John say, the
[58:27] message brought us all together. So
[58:30] don't talk to me about your culture.
[58:33] Talk to me about the message of the
[58:35] hour.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; When you go to work, do you talk about
[58:48] your culture?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And so when it come to the message now,
[58:51] you want to bring your culture.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Keep your culture outside of this
[58:55] church.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; The only culture is the word of God.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. If it's in the
[59:02] word, we stick with it.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] How can you live with a woman you don't
[59:11] compliment her
[59:13] &gt;&gt; and you think it's normal? It's
[59:15] abnormal.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm saying never let that
[59:19] honeymoon seasonal.
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to control myself. Married
[59:28] couple married couple knows we went
[59:30] through this. You have forsaken your
[59:33] first love.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Married couple remember that. And
[59:36] brother Brandham compared that love with
[59:38] a married man and a married woman.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Married people knows that. I gave the
[59:45] script. I gave the scripture and I gave
[59:47] the quote.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; You start marriage is good. Everything
[59:50] good on courtship you are good. And once
[59:53] you get into marriage suddenly
[59:55] everything died.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; So you were putting it off.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; You were putting it on. It was fake.
[1:00:06] You did it to catch the sister
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; and the sister gave the heart that this
[1:00:11] is the sweetest man. I'm going to live
[1:00:14] with him the rest of my life. And when
[1:00:16] we get into the marriage, there is no
[1:00:17] more seed that you are sour
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; like a lemon.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Come and be under the sun,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; the rising of the sun. So it can mellow.
[1:00:28] It will it will it will it will work on
[1:00:30] you until you are wrapped. The best
[1:00:33] marriage in this message should be where
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; where
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; you don't have to envy no one outside
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; whatever is out there they copy the
[1:00:54] original from us.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; We were the one to have the original.
[1:00:57] Yes.
[1:00:59] [Applause]
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Those who compliment your wife are
[1:01:04] sisters,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; people outside
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; and you yourself, you don't compliment
[1:01:09] your wife.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; In other way, you are blind.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You don't see anything.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Everything everybody seeing, you don't
[1:01:17] see anything.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; No, we need to recalibrate your mind.
[1:01:21] Come and get some ice
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; so you can see the beauty in your wife.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Not in another woman. In your wife.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Not in somebody else wife. In your wife.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Everything you need for a woman should
[1:01:38] be in your wife.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:01:49] [Laughter]
[1:01:53] Yes, my brother.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; So, young brother, whoever is thinking
[1:02:00] to come down here, make sure
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; sit down here. I don't know if you got
[1:02:07] the material. I got it for free here.
[1:02:09] Come here. Sit down. We will give it to
[1:02:12] you for free
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; and make sure you have a wonderful
[1:02:15] marriage. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] I told them yesterday I said what I want
[1:02:20] is for your marriage to be the best
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; better than even our marriage
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; so we can have a sample we will show the
[1:02:27] people in the message the people of the
[1:02:29] world that this is what a message can
[1:02:31] produce
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; this type of marriage
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; a mar a marriage where there is no abuse
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; no violence
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; nothing
[1:02:46] else but love.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So, young sister, we clear, right?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; If you have another subject, put it in.
[1:02:57] We sit down and we can talk again. Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Because not only did we go to question
[1:03:02] and answer, but I love the fellowship.
[1:03:03] It was very good to see them sitting,
[1:03:06] eating, and just fellowship with one
[1:03:07] another. A very good thing. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; So, if you get any subject, just go
[1:03:12] ahead. Don't say brother Steven, stop
[1:03:14] there. The pastor is always available.
[1:03:16] Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I'm a servant to you. So if something is
[1:03:19] there, put it up. Let's sit with the
[1:03:21] pastor. Let's talk.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see the pastor on the pull pit
[1:03:25] and the pastor is gone. The pastor uh uh
[1:03:27] uh not that. Let's sit down. Let's talk.
[1:03:29] Let's fellowship. Tell me what is in
[1:03:31] your heart. Tell me what is in your
[1:03:32] mind. Let's go ahead and sit because you
[1:03:34] will never have that opportunity.
[1:03:36] Especially we were back home with big
[1:03:39] churches. You f five 7,000 people
[1:03:42] churches. When are you going to see the
[1:03:43] pastor?
[1:03:46] But the pastor is a shepherd.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; He should be there for you.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So if you need it, please let us know.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So Lord's willing, in October 11,
[1:03:56] question and answer. And then October
[1:03:58] the 25th, the part three of courtship
[1:04:01] for the young men, boys. I don't have
[1:04:03] any choice. I have to drill things in
[1:04:05] you. Amen. Because you the head of the
[1:04:08] family. So October the brother Glenn say
[1:04:11] that's right. I don't have any choice.
[1:04:13] Amen. I got to drill everything in you.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Drill everything because you the head.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; We don't want an empty head.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; A prepare well done head
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; that a woman can find rest
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; like roof rest in the house in the house
[1:04:30] of your husband.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Not find trouble, find peace,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; find rest. Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that the flower can
[1:04:40] continue on and on and on and on. Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Merit couple meeting on
[1:04:49] December the 13th and then the building
[1:04:52] you pray for us. By God's grace, the
[1:04:55] Abraham Lincoln already moved from the
[1:04:57] back toward the front. Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; So we are praying. They were supposed to
[1:05:02] start uh work last week but they could
[1:05:05] not because of the rain. So it looks
[1:05:08] like there might be rain. So pray for
[1:05:09] the rain to stop.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with praying for
[1:05:12] the rain to stop, I got a scripture and
[1:05:14] I got a quote.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brandham was trying to
[1:05:18] have I'm in a meeting and he said,
[1:05:20] "Father, we need rain, but for right
[1:05:22] now, souls are more important than the
[1:05:24] rain. Would you stop the rain?" I got
[1:05:26] the quote. I already gave it to the
[1:05:27] deacon. Amen. So pray so God will stop
[1:05:30] the rain
[1:05:32] this week completely dry so the Abraham
[1:05:35] Lincoln can begin to do what is supposed
[1:05:37] to be doing and raise everything up and
[1:05:40] we move on. Amen. So pray that the
[1:05:42] miracle takes place because everything
[1:05:44] is coming straight and you will see some
[1:05:46] transformation going on outside. So pray
[1:05:49] so the rain can be out of the way by
[1:05:51] God's grace. Amen. We went through the
[1:05:54] deacon meeting on s on uh Friday and by
[1:05:57] God's grace what we came up with is
[1:05:59] prayer will be on Tuesday
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; prayer on Tuesday at 7:00
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; 700 p.m. in the evening. So he give you
[1:06:09] time to leave work to come home and to
[1:06:11] rest a little bit and to refresh and
[1:06:14] then prayer. Everybody okay with that
[1:06:16] time?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay with that time?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] All right, let's start first with
[1:06:24] Tuesday.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Tuesday at 7 o'clock. By 6:45 the zoom
[1:06:31] will be going on.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; We don't want to waste time with
[1:06:35] testimonies and this this this. I'm not
[1:06:37] saying waste time. There is a time for
[1:06:39] testimony.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; But that is the time for prayer.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; If we start testimonies and this and
[1:06:45] this and this, we will lose 30 minutes.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Uh so keep the testimony for the church
[1:06:50] and everything else. We coming for
[1:06:52] prayer.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; So if we read the scripture, we read the
[1:06:55] I mean a scripture exhorting two minutes
[1:06:57] and then we start praying. In other
[1:06:59] words, we will give more time toward
[1:07:02] praying versus any talking or what's
[1:07:05] going on. Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So Tuesday at 700 p.m. Every Tuesday at
[1:07:11] 700 p.m. 700 p.m. to 8:00 or 8:05 or
[1:07:16] 8:07
[1:07:18] depending on when we start praying. If
[1:07:20] it took eight minute to read the the the
[1:07:24] prayer request, then automatically we
[1:07:26] have to go to 808 or 8:05 or depending
[1:07:30] on what's going on. But by 6:45, you can
[1:07:34] jump on. You will get the zoom coming up
[1:07:36] from the uh church group chat. Hop on.
[1:07:39] You can come later. You can come
[1:07:41] according to your time. If you come I
[1:07:43] mean at 7:20 that's your problem.
[1:07:45] There's no problem. I cannot push you
[1:07:46] because based on your schedule, but hop
[1:07:48] on and then we go ahead and move on. And
[1:07:51] by 5:00 p.m., Lord's willing on Tuesday.
[1:07:54] So, you have today up to Tuesday by 5:00
[1:07:57] p. p.m. get all your request and send
[1:08:00] them to the song leaders. You can send
[1:08:03] them to brother John. You can send them
[1:08:05] to brother set. Send all this prayer
[1:08:08] request and everything there. So when
[1:08:10] it's 5:00, we're not going to sit there
[1:08:13] and begin to get unspoken or prayer
[1:08:15] request. We will lose time. So make sure
[1:08:18] put everything except if there is an
[1:08:20] extreme emergency that popped up. That
[1:08:22] makes sense. But let's try to minimize
[1:08:25] and organize everything. Send all your
[1:08:28] requests by five o'clock and then at 7
[1:08:30] o'clock we read the scripture, speak
[1:08:32] like one minute and then jump into
[1:08:34] prayer and pray pray and let you pray
[1:08:37] for yourself and your family and we stop
[1:08:40] and then go and pray over all the
[1:08:42] requests and we keep on moving and if
[1:08:44] the Holy Spirit lead us, he will let us
[1:08:47] know whether we need one more hours or
[1:08:49] we need another day or something like
[1:08:51] that and we keep moving. Any question?
[1:08:54] Any question? Go ahead, my brother.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; The deacon are handling that. I don't
[1:09:04] want to say it right now. I'm on
[1:09:05] YouTube. The deacon are handling that.
[1:09:07] Amen. So, whoever can get in there, they
[1:09:10] will get a link. If I put it up right
[1:09:13] now, you will your my uh uh chat on
[1:09:17] YouTube will begin to be filled right
[1:09:20] now in in about five minutes. And by
[1:09:24] tomorrow I will have phone call coming
[1:09:25] up everywhere. So we put it up on the
[1:09:28] deacon. If you have any questions, send
[1:09:30] us an email. But if anybody need to
[1:09:32] receive something, the deacon are on
[1:09:34] board on that. Brother Robert already
[1:09:35] showed me this morning what he's working
[1:09:37] on. And so everything is covered. So if
[1:09:39] somebody needs something, they need to
[1:09:41] contact the deacon on contact me and get
[1:09:44] a permission then we go ahead and handle
[1:09:46] that. We don't have any problem with
[1:09:47] that. But we just want to do it in a
[1:09:50] orderly way versus if you open up then
[1:09:53] we don't know who's who and where it's
[1:09:55] coming from. So just to make sure we
[1:09:58] clear unless you have somebody in mind
[1:09:59] you see me or see the deacon and we go
[1:10:01] ahead. Everybody clear so far?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen my friend?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; This Tuesday 7:00.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; If it goes well, if we need more, we can
[1:10:16] always open up more. So, we will see. I
[1:10:18] don't want to start with a big thing and
[1:10:20] then before you know it, we start doing
[1:10:21] them. Let's start with one hour and
[1:10:23] let's see how it's going and move on.
[1:10:25] So, at that point, you don't have to
[1:10:26] drive all the way here to church. You
[1:10:28] get there, you can close your screen,
[1:10:30] whatever you want to do, but let's go
[1:10:31] ahead and pray, pray, pray, pray. I gave
[1:10:34] you quote uh I mean uh I mean a clip
[1:10:37] about prayer. We already taught you
[1:10:39] about prayer in this church. You can go
[1:10:41] back on YouTube and see how to pray and
[1:10:43] you can review that all together. So
[1:10:45] when we get there, we start. Sorry. You
[1:10:48] don't have to be at home to be on that
[1:10:50] zoom. You can be at work. If there is a
[1:10:53] possibility for you to do it, you can do
[1:10:55] it. You can be on your car. You can put
[1:10:58] it on your truck or wherever you are.
[1:11:00] You can join in. It's just a Zoom link
[1:11:03] and you can go just the way you
[1:11:04] streaming everywhere you are. We can do
[1:11:06] the same thing. Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go to the reading
[1:11:11] of the word. The flight attendant
[1:11:13] prepare for takeoff.
[1:11:19] It's amazing spoken word.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amazing. Glory to God. You will need
[1:11:26] your Bible today. I will try my best. I
[1:11:29] try to go this route to to clarify
[1:11:33] certain things because these things are
[1:11:34] very difficult and if the Lord don't
[1:11:37] help you, you will get lost in the
[1:11:39] scripture. But there is no contradiction
[1:11:41] in the scripture. And if you get online,
[1:11:43] you will see people that thought it's a
[1:11:44] contradiction. But it's not a
[1:11:46] contradiction. It's clear. So I'm going
[1:11:48] this route to just make things so simple
[1:11:51] for you. So one day if you go back to
[1:11:53] those chapter in the Bible and you read
[1:11:55] them, they will be easier for you to
[1:11:58] comprehend them because you will be
[1:12:00] seeing Hezekiah saying this and then
[1:12:03] Ezekiel is saying this, then Jeremiah is
[1:12:05] saying this. But if you don't understand
[1:12:07] the background, you might be missing
[1:12:09] certain things. So I'm trying to make
[1:12:10] things as simple as possible. So you
[1:12:13] need your Bible. Amen. Let's go ahead
[1:12:16] and pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[1:12:18] approaching you humbly this morning or
[1:12:21] this afternoon soon. Father, thanking
[1:12:24] you for your grace, your love, your
[1:12:26] mercy, and for everything you have been
[1:12:28] doing for us. Father, this is as far as
[1:12:31] I can go with the ability you have given
[1:12:34] me. But when it come to speaking to your
[1:12:36] bride and ministering to them, you only
[1:12:38] take the supernatural action of the Holy
[1:12:41] Spirit. Father, may you move me
[1:12:43] completely out of the way. And not only
[1:12:45] me, but the visible and the invisible
[1:12:48] audience completely out of the way. So
[1:12:50] you will be the one ministering, the one
[1:12:52] talking, the one hearing, the one
[1:12:54] interpreting, the one blessing, the one
[1:12:57] filling, the one delivering. And Father,
[1:12:59] may you come in the clarity of your
[1:13:01] word. And Lord, father be Lord declare
[1:13:05] in a mighty way in the midst of your
[1:13:07] children. Lord we rebuke everything that
[1:13:09] is contrary to your word any influence
[1:13:12] from the outside atmosphere into the
[1:13:14] church. But father may your freedom be
[1:13:17] in the midst of your children. May you
[1:13:19] anoint us Lord Father and speak to us so
[1:13:22] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject this morning,
[1:13:31] you can turn to the book of Psalm
[1:13:33] chapter 23. My subject is our life
[1:13:37] journey through Joseph's five garment
[1:13:40] part 80.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You reach 80.
[1:13:51] Amen. And my theme, Lord's willing, is
[1:13:55] season.
[1:14:01] Seasons. I'm trying to push forward. I
[1:14:04] can't. I have to follow the spirit of
[1:14:06] the Lord. Season
[1:14:12] in the midst
[1:14:16] of chaos.
[1:14:23] A season
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; in the midst of chaos.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; What look like a chaos,
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; it's a season.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Because if I go straight to the other
[1:14:37] way, you will miss this. And that's
[1:14:40] where the devil is has a PhD
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; on making you miss a season because of
[1:14:47] trial.
[1:14:49] The devil has a PhD on that. He work on
[1:14:52] humanity and your great great great
[1:14:54] great even on everybody over there since
[1:14:57] uh Eden. He's very good at that. Amen.
[1:15:01] But the seals are open.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And because the seals are open, there is
[1:15:05] no way the devil can take a preeminence
[1:15:08] on the children of God. Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Psalm 23. If you dare, you
[1:15:13] can say amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] The Bible says that the Lord
[1:15:19] Elohim.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord is who?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; My shepherd.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And because he's my shepherd, I shall
[1:15:30] not want. You might be seated.
[1:15:35] According to Jeremiah 10 verse 23,
[1:15:41] I'm warming the engine.
[1:15:45] The Bible says that, "Oh Lord, I know
[1:15:49] that the way of a man is not in
[1:15:52] himself."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; This is a Bible principle you have to
[1:15:56] understand.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Your way is not up to you.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Let me put it a certain way. Your life
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; is not up to you.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; If you ever thought you got things in
[1:16:10] charge, you messed up somewhere.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And every decision you would take will
[1:16:16] cause you problem.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that I know that the way
[1:16:23] of a man is not in himself.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; It is not in man that walketh to direct
[1:16:31] what?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; So you cannot lead yourself.
[1:16:38] No matter
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; no matter how intelligent you are,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; no matter how smart you think you are,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; no matter how independent you think you
[1:16:49] are,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; the Bible say you cannot direct your
[1:16:52] step.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's why we need a shepherd.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a pastor. I'm
[1:17:00] talking about the Lord himself is your
[1:17:04] shepherd.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, you were designed to be
[1:17:07] led.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; You were designed not to lead yourself.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; You might have ambition.
[1:17:16] You might have desire.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; But the ultimate decision of leadership
[1:17:22] cannot come from you.
[1:17:25] It have to come only from the Lord
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; because God designed you to be led.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You were not designed to lead yourself.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; You were not designed to be independent.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; You were designed to be dependent,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; dependent upon the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; That's why God called you lambs
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; because he himself was a lamb.
[1:17:54] and he learned obedience
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; as a lamb. He had to be submitted by the
[1:18:00] dove.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And David is saying the Lord himself
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; is my shepherd. In other words, my
[1:18:07] entire leadership is in the Lord.
[1:18:12] Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:18:14] Nothing but
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; The Lord verse one is who? My shepherd,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; my shepherd, and I shall not water.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; A shepherd is there to lead the sheep.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And a shepherd have a higher brain
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; than the sheep.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; A shepherd have a higher mentality,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; a higher faculty than the sheep.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the purpose of a shepherd is
[1:18:52] to lead.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Is to guide.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Is to direct.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We clear, my friend.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; A shepherd.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He's there to lead.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; He's there as a guide.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; He's there to give instruction.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; To lead you, to guide you.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So you cannot be before the shepherd.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; You must be behind the shepherd.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Because the shepherd knows the way.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; The shepherd knows the way.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is a guide.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; He knows the way. Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; He's the one leading you.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] He's the one directing you.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of what?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Chaos.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Let's watch the leadership of this
[1:20:01] shepherd.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He makes me to lie down where?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; In green pastures.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody love this.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Where is the shepherd taking you in
[1:20:15] green pasture?
[1:20:17] Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; He's taking you to a banquet.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He's taking you to a restaurant.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; We all love that.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Green pasture.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Taking you to eat.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; You can refocus, sister. Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; He makes me to lie down in what?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Green pastures.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; He leads. You see the leadership,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; he leads me beside what?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Still water.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; So the shepherd knows which water
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; to lead you to
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; the shepherd have an idea where the
[1:21:03] trouble water are
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; and where the steel water are.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You don't know where that water is. So
[1:21:10] you need to depend on the supreme
[1:21:12] intelligence
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; of the shepherd because he knows the
[1:21:16] way.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; You might see a water that looks still.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; But there could be a crocodile there.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; So the shepherd knows the water and
[1:21:30] knows what is in the water.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And he knows that the water is safe for
[1:21:34] the sheep.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this still look good. Where is
[1:21:41] the shepherd taking you to? He's taking
[1:21:43] you to green pasture.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Green pasture. Praise the Lord. You got
[1:21:50] a good shepherd.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Where does he take you? To green
[1:21:54] pasture.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You got a good daddy.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Where does he take you to green pasture?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Did he stop there? No. He takes you also
[1:22:06] to what type of water?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Water.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Trouble water.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Oh. So it looks like the shepherd is
[1:22:14] avoiding danger
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; at this point
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; because he want you to go in a peaceful
[1:22:22] water.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; When you eat, you eat, you finish, he
[1:22:25] takes you to a sweet water. And you sit
[1:22:27] down, you say, "Thank you. This feels so
[1:22:30] good. It's so calm here. Everything is
[1:22:33] good. I love the strawberry lemonade. I
[1:22:36] It tastes so good and everything. Ah,
[1:22:40] praise the Lord. I just picked up
[1:22:42] strawberry lemonade. Okay. I love sweet
[1:22:44] tea. So, we balance it up. Amen.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It is so good. It's so sweet. This is
[1:22:49] the best. Put a lemon on it.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm moving the
[1:22:58] airplane. Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Verse three. He does what? restoreth my
[1:23:03] soul.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, he refreshes your soul.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; He restoth my soul. And he does what?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; He leadth me in the paths of
[1:23:12] righteousness.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Does he lead you in the wrong way?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; In what path?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Paths of righteousness.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So this shepherd, it looks like
[1:23:20] everything, every leadership, every way
[1:23:23] the shepherd is leading us is good.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; He's leading us to paths plural of what?
[1:23:32] righteousness.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; So this leadership is in a good place.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Still water,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; good path. Path of what? Righteousness.
[1:23:41] When you walk there, everything look
[1:23:42] nice, right?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; He leads me in the path of righteousness
[1:23:50] for what?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; His name sake.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; We went through that because of his
[1:23:54] what? Reputation. Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Then on verse four, David says something
[1:24:00] else.
[1:24:04] Because now we are more excited. What is
[1:24:07] the next one?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, we want to know David,
[1:24:10] who's your shepherd? The Lord.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Talk to me about the Lord.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Where does he take you?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Then David say, you know what? He takes
[1:24:18] me to green pasture. He leads me beside.
[1:24:21] Say, oh, that's a very good shepherd.
[1:24:25] Ah, and what else? In the paths of
[1:24:27] righteousness. Oh my god. I I want to be
[1:24:30] part of your team. And David say, "Yay."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yay. What?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Verse four, David say, "Yay, though I
[1:24:40] walk
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; through the valley of the shadow of
[1:24:47] life." No.
[1:24:51] [Laughter]
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Who's who's
[1:24:58] walking through the valley?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; David.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; What type of valley?
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; The shadow of what?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; How did David get there?
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Because Because it's not up to men
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; to direct his step.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the footstep of a righteous
[1:25:19] man.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I direct by who?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; So David, you told me the Lord take you
[1:25:26] to green pasture.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You told me the Lord take you to uh
[1:25:32] still water. You say the Lord take you
[1:25:34] to a path of righteousness. And there
[1:25:37] are many paths of righteousness. So, how
[1:25:39] did you end up
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; in the valley
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; of the shadow
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; of death?
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; How did you end up under the pale horse?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Your answer first will be, you know
[1:26:05] what? That was yourself.
[1:26:07] You the one that did it. That's
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord always take you to
[1:26:12] green pasture, still water and this this
[1:26:15] this. So this is not the leading of the
[1:26:18] Lord.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; This is you got yourself in trouble.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; But we need to find out who took David
[1:26:26] there.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Because David is saying, I'm a sheep.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; This is what David is saying. I'm only
[1:26:34] following.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; When he goes, I realize where he took me
[1:26:40] is green pasture.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The next step he took me was still
[1:26:44] water.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; The third step was the path of
[1:26:47] righteousness.
[1:26:49] But
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I also found out
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; that I found myself somehow
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; at this point walking through the valley
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; of the shadow
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; of death. Who took you there?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That's it right there.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Let's read. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Let the Bible answer itself.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Verse four. He said, "Yeah, though I did
[1:27:12] what?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I walk through the valley of
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; through the valley of the shadow of
[1:27:17] what?
[1:27:18] I do what?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I will fear no evil.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, David.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; David is saying I'm walking in the wrong
[1:27:25] place.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Death is around here.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; It's an anointing of death.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; That's why I say the pale horse is right
[1:27:33] here.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I am under the anointing of the pale
[1:27:40] horse.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Because the pale horse is the anointing
[1:27:44] in
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Laia.
[1:27:50] Are we together?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; But David say, "Even though I'm there,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Because David supposed to scare you.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; But David say, "I am not afraid."
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Why David are you not afraid?
[1:28:17] Let's go read it, my friend. He says,
[1:28:19] "Though I walk in the valley of the
[1:28:21] shadow of water,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I do what
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; will fear no evil."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; For thou art with me.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So, who is with David there?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; But we know that David already told us
[1:28:36] he's not the shepherd.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. David say I am not the shepherd.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; The one who is the shepherd is who?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; I am a sheep. I'm only following him.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; But I found out myself in the valley of
[1:28:55] the shadow of death.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; But when I look around, I'm not myself.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; The shepherd is there.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; But we know that who is leading the
[1:29:06] road?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's the shepherd.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; It's not David. So, how did David get
[1:29:12] there?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; So, who led David there?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to respond. Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; So the shepherd of David
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; sometime may take you
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; in a different zone.
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:49] doesn't take you always to green
[1:29:51] pasture,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; always to still water,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; always to the path of righteousness. No,
[1:29:56] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:29:58] no. He also take you to the valley
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; of the shadow
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; of death
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; because David doesn't know the road.
[1:30:07] He's depending on the shepherd.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But David found out that even though
[1:30:12] it's scary,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; that's not my problem.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He is the one leading me.
[1:30:19] and he is the one with me.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; As long as he is with me,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; even though it's a rough road,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I am not afraid.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to take off from the airport.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Because it's very easy to be on a green
[1:30:43] pasture
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; and to drink a Coca-Cola. Very good.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:30:48] But in the shadow of the valley, the
[1:30:51] valley of the shadow of death, you are
[1:30:54] always alert.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; But we found out that David instead of
[1:30:58] being alert, David is whistling.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; They say David, why are you whistling?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; When you are in the valley of the shadow
[1:31:08] of death,
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; why are you whistling when you under
[1:31:12] dialysis?
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:18] Why are you whistling when the doctor
[1:31:20] say it's cancer?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Why are you whistling when they say you
[1:31:25] are sick?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; When they say there is no remedy to your
[1:31:29] problem,
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; but you are still fine.
[1:31:33] You are still confident. What makes you
[1:31:36] confident?
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Because I know I didn't choose.
[1:31:44] Yes Lord.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you here.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Who is here? Who is here will pick
[1:31:50] disease?
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Who is here will say no no I want to
[1:31:54] experience corona virus.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; We all run away from it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; But somehow we found oursel there.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; You have you found yourself in the place
[1:32:03] you didn't want to go.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So who took you there?
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:11] I'm not here to advertise the devil.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; I'm here to advertise God.
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not going to say the
[1:32:24] devil got here. I say the Lord led me
[1:32:28] through here.
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; In green pasture, what do you do? Eat
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; here. What do you do? Drink
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; here. What do you do? Looking around.
[1:32:49] I'm on my way to
[1:32:52] rejoicing. No problem. Here you begin to
[1:32:56] know who is God. Amen.
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Verse four again. Yeah. Though
[1:33:13] I do what?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Help me move on with the scripture, my
[1:33:16] friend.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Though I walk into the what?
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; The valley.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I already gave you a quote about 45
[1:33:22] minutes. Yes. Through the weekend.
[1:33:25] Brother Brandham told brother Neville,
[1:33:26] you're just getting started. It was 45
[1:33:29] minutes. And brother Brandham say, I
[1:33:31] don't know where you got that from. It's
[1:33:33] a shame. It's in the group chat.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's in the group chat.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Ah, so leave me alone. Let's go, my
[1:33:40] friend. Please. Though I walk through
[1:33:42] the valley of the shadow of water
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; because you got to know this type of
[1:33:47] stuff.
[1:33:49] There is one there by
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I will fear what
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; no evil
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; for thou are what
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; with me.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; We need to know who is with him. It is
[1:33:58] God. What type of God? Look what he say.
[1:34:01] Thou what?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Thy staff.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; So what manifestation of God is there?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; A shepherd.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; The road and the staff belong to who?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; It's shepherd to. So the shepherd is the
[1:34:16] one that was leading David through the
[1:34:18] wrong valley.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; My friend is my Bible different than
[1:34:26] yours.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; David is saying I'm not afraid because
[1:34:31] your road and your what?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Road and staff belongs to who?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; So who is in the valley of the shadow of
[1:34:38] death?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; And the shepherd is the one leading. So
[1:34:41] who took David through the road? Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; The road that you think is rough,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; who took you there?
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Did you pick it up?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; He said that road and what?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Thy staff.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; The road is for defense,
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; for protection.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And the staff is for guidance.
[1:35:12] It's for support
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; and it's also for rescue
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; because sometime he have a a hook like
[1:35:19] this.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So when you were about to fall down the
[1:35:23] shepherd just put a hook there.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And David said your
[1:35:31] tools are doing what?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Comfort me.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They are doing what?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Comfort me.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; They are comforting me.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? So we find out that
[1:35:41] the shepherd is leading David in a rough
[1:35:45] road.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; But because the shepherd is there, David
[1:35:51] instead of minding what is around,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; it
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; David is focusing on the shepherd and on
[1:36:02] the tools of the shepherd.
[1:36:05] As long as the shepherd is there with
[1:36:08] his two, I don't care what's going on.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; So, we left from a happy greenish
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; uh babbling place. Now, we going to a
[1:36:24] spooky place.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; But let's see what spooky does.
[1:36:31] drop to verse uh five if you there you
[1:36:35] can say amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; He prepares a table
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; where
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; before me.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Before me in the presence of the brother
[1:36:47] in the message
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; in the presence of what?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; My enemies.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; When you were in the green pasture, did
[1:36:56] he prepare the place the table for you?
[1:37:00] Did he prepare the table for you over
[1:37:02] there?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Only when your enemy are present.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; That's when he begin to prepare a table.
[1:37:12] In other words, the presence of
[1:37:14] adversity is important.
[1:37:16] [Applause]
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; It's a hard lesson. I told you it's a
[1:37:24] very hard lesson.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; He's preparing the table in the presence
[1:37:27] of what?
[1:37:29] How can you prepare a table when the
[1:37:31] enemy is looking at
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Do you think the enemy will clap hand?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; The enemy will do what?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Try to kill you. It will stir up even
[1:37:41] jealousy
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; and God instead of sparing you
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; avoiding to bless you in the presence of
[1:37:48] the enemy because it's going to cause
[1:37:50] you problem. God make sure he put a
[1:37:53] table and he wipe the table and he put a
[1:37:57] tablecloth and he call sister Pam and
[1:38:01] say go ahead and put some decoration and
[1:38:04] then God begin to pour the blessing when
[1:38:07] the enemy is seeing you.
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:13] So when you see the enemy coming, you
[1:38:16] need to know how to interpret that.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The enemy is bringing a season.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; The presence of the enemy is a season.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; It's a preparation of a table.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; The table is only prepared in the
[1:38:35] presence of what?
[1:38:38] Ah please let's let's go together. Let's
[1:38:41] go together. The the he prepared a table
[1:38:45] where
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; in the presence of what?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; So if the enemy is not there, are you
[1:38:50] going to get your table?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; So what do you need for your table to be
[1:38:53] prepared?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Bring some Judas.
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Is this is this difficult?
[1:39:07] A what
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; season? In the midst of what?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; In the midst of the enemy.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; That's when God say, you know what? It's
[1:39:21] time to put a table.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Let's see what he does on that table.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[1:39:36] in the presence
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; of what?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; My enemies.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; He He prepareth what? A table
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; over here. You are eating yourself
[1:39:53] without a table.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; But when God begin to see the enemy,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; God put a banquet.
[1:40:03] Yes. Take your time right there,
[1:40:05] brother. That's it.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Verse six. You prepare a what?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; A table.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; A table in the before me in the presence
[1:40:15] of what?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; My enemies.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; And you do what?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Anoint my head with oil.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he anoint you in the green
[1:40:23] pasture?
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; When you are in green pasture, there's
[1:40:28] no anointing.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different? When you are in
[1:40:33] still water, there is no anointing. But
[1:40:35] when you begin to go through trouble,
[1:40:38] that's when the anointing come.
[1:40:51] What you are calling chaos is a
[1:40:54] blessing.
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; When he was taking you in the path of
[1:41:07] righteousness, did you see the
[1:41:08] anointing?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But when he sees the enemy,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; then God say, "Oh, enemy is there.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. bring up a table
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; and then he's anointing what?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; What is he putting on?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Oil means what?
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; He's anointing my head. He's
[1:41:35] consecrating me.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; In other word, I'm blessing him, but I'm
[1:41:39] also anointing him.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; What do you need the anointing for?
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:51] I don't know if we together
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; in the valley
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; of the shadow
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; of death. You are depending on his ro
[1:42:01] and on the staff.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; But when the enemy show up,
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; God back up, he anoints you.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, you do the fighting.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe you do the fighting. All you need
[1:42:16] is an anointing.
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; When you going through problem, instead
[1:42:31] of looking at the problem,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; search the anointing.
[1:42:36] [Applause]
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:45] Because problem comes with anointing.
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:51] [Applause]

[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; my friend? I'm loaded. I don't know if

[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; So
[1:44:00] in the presence of my enemy, what
[1:44:02] happened?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; And after table, what happened?
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Anointing.
[1:44:07] anointing.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; We need to know what level of anointing.
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; We've been reading this all the time.
[1:44:18] Let's see what because everybody of us
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; have a measure.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Some of us are 18 widers,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; some are sedan, some are V8.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody have their own anointing. If
[1:44:33] you don't have a uh if if if you have a
[1:44:36] difficulty understanding everybody have
[1:44:38] anointing. Let's go to the restaurant.

[1:44:43] will find out that we have different
[1:44:45] capacity.

[1:45:22] Robert. Okay. So, everybody has a
[1:45:25] measure.

[1:45:31] measure.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And in other words, if your belly is 60
[1:45:37] gallon,
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just picking up like that. Okay. If
[1:45:43] your truck is 60 gallon,

[1:45:48] gallon, Amen. When you get to the
[1:45:51] filling station, to the gas station,

[1:46:07] eat, you eat. When you full, you fool.
[1:46:08] You can't get anymore.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; But let's see what type of anointing you
[1:46:13] get when your enemy see you.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Can we read it?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Can we read it?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Verse five. You prepare what? A table
[1:46:25] before
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; a table when
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; before me
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; where
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; in the presence of my enemy.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And you do what?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Anoints my head with oil.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And my cup do what?
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come, what happened to
[1:46:43] your cup?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; So God will anoint you more than you
[1:46:47] need.
[1:46:54] Are we together?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; What looks like a chaos,
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; it's an opportunity for an an
[1:47:01] overflowing of anointing.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; In other word, if your cup is like this,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. If your cup is like this, when God
[1:47:16] see the enemy,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; huh, God comes quickly and begin to go
[1:47:22] like this.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he get here, the angel
[1:47:26] say, "Stop, stop." And God is just like
[1:47:28] this. He forgot to to read the
[1:47:32] [Applause]
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; before you knowing the anointing is no
[1:47:38] more only feeling you. It is now all
[1:47:41] over me. It's all love for me. It's all
[1:47:45] love me. It move from the heart to the
[1:47:48] body to the spirit. And when it's
[1:47:51] overflowing, it will touch my neighbor.
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? I'm
[1:48:06] already leaving the airport. Are we
[1:48:08] together?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; So, the presence of the enemy is a
[1:48:11] blessing.
[1:48:13] The more trial you going through,
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; the more anointing,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; the more power,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; the more feeling.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together? You need to understand
[1:48:29] this because the devil want you to focus
[1:48:31] on the enemy.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; But the devil doesn't want you to look
[1:48:35] at your table.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Focus on your table and your cup. Your
[1:48:40] table is full and your cup is already
[1:48:43] overflowing.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; What does cup run over mean?
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother? I'm saying in
[1:48:57] the message, what?

[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; fill it And then we just keep doing
[1:49:39] water.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Running over after a while.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Just do water.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Filled up so full.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; And David say my cup does water.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Runth over.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; I like to get that running over portion.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you?

[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Running over.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And then you can do what?
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Help somebody.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; You see when you are what?
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Running over.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; The only way you can help somebody is
[1:50:03] when your cup is what? when you have
[1:50:06] more than enough.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? If the
[1:50:14] only way you can help other people is
[1:50:17] when God bless you and then your
[1:50:20] blessing begin to run over, then you
[1:50:23] need somebody that you can give it away.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It takes the enemy to bring that in your
[1:50:31] life.
[1:50:34] Yes.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Season in the midst of what?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Chaos.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Chaotic.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; In a chaotic place
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; where you feel like you not secure
[1:50:50] anymore.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; You are now more safe.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody around is a problem.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. It's an opportunity.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; It is a season.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the enemy. Focus on your
[1:51:04] cupmen
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; because it's not you. It's the Lord
[1:51:09] who's leading you.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; It is the Lord who's taking you through.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, when I go through the
[1:51:16] valley of the shadow of death.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; What follow that valley is a table.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; After the valley of the shadow of death,
[1:51:27] it must be a table. After going through
[1:51:30] a hard trial, what is coming next is a
[1:51:33] table.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; God is proving to the enemy. She went
[1:51:38] through the trial.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; She passed the test. Now I'm putting a
[1:51:43] table and I'm pulling my blessings.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Do you see the sequence of the
[1:51:55] scripture? You go fresh out through the
[1:51:58] valley,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; but don't worry about the valley. Look
[1:52:00] at the table.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; After the valley, God wait for the enemy
[1:52:05] to be there.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; The enemy won't die. They need to see.
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together so far?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Verse six. Verse six, my friend. Then
[1:52:25] what?
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Surely goodness
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; surely what
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; goodness
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and what
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and mercy
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; shall follow me
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; all the days of my life.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; How many days?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; All the days of my life.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; In the valley of death.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. All the day.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Whether in the valley
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; or in green pasture or in still water.
[1:52:45] Whatever you do all the day or my life
[1:52:47] whether it's good day or bad day.
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:52:56] Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Who put your life through what you're
[1:53:01] going through?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; You were following him to church.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; You were following him to do what what
[1:53:13] what he's expecting you to do. And
[1:53:16] suddenly you find yourself in a trial.
[1:53:18] Who took you to that trial when you
[1:53:20] trying to do what is good?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; It is not a trial. And if you notice,
[1:53:25] David is not saying he's leading me to
[1:53:28] the valley.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; He's walking through.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; It was not a destination. It was just a
[1:53:36] road, a a pass by.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; So your trial is a pass by.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That problem is a pass by. That
[1:53:44] difficulty is a pass by. That road block
[1:53:47] is a pass by.
[1:53:50] [Applause]
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Surely goodness and mercy
[1:54:01] shall do what?"
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; When?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; All the days of my life.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And I will dwell in the house of the
[1:54:07] Lord when
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Everybody clear?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 4.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Second reading of the
[1:54:16] scripture.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of chaos.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Matthew 4. If you there, you can say
[1:54:32] amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; We are still reading the Bible, my
[1:54:34] friend.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse one. Let's go.
[1:54:40] Let's go, my friend.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Then was Jesus led up.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus was what? Let up
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; my friend. Jesus was what?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Was it the desire? Was it what Jesus
[1:54:53] want to do?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was what?
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Led up to green pasture.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; No, let's see where they led up by who?
[1:55:02] Can you read
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; of the spirit?
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; So who was leading Jesus?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Ah, please answer me. Who was leading
[1:55:10] Jesus?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; The spirit. God.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; God. Oh, God is leading Jesus. So, he's
[1:55:15] taking him to a beautiful place. Oh,
[1:55:19] wonderful. It is God. Oh, my brother,
[1:55:22] the Lord is leading me. So, it must be a
[1:55:24] good place.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus being what?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Led by who?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Of the spirit.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was led, what a badass.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus being led
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; of the what?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Spirit,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost was leading Jesus.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Just like David is saying the Lord is
[1:55:52] leading. Let's see where does the Holy
[1:55:54] Ghost take him.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And he was led of what?
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; The spirit.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Where?
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Into the wilderness.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; What is in the wilderness? Come on.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; A wilderness is a cursed place.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; A wilderness is a place without life.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Because that's the reason why in the
[1:56:15] millennium God have to restore and
[1:56:19] remove the wilderness.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Because originally the wilderness was
[1:56:22] not there.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Instead of God leading Jesus to green
[1:56:27] pasture,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; spoken word.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? God is leading Jesus to
[1:56:34] what?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; To the wilderness.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; To the wilderness in a dry place.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; How did you get to this dryness? It is
[1:56:49] the Lord.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Why are you broke?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; How did you get to this situation?
[1:57:01] It is God.
[1:57:05] [Applause]
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just screening the radar.
[1:57:14] Are we together?
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. God lead him to what?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; The wilderness.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; We need to know the purpose.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose for?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You are leading him to a place that have
[1:57:26] nothing.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I want to know what is the reason.
[1:57:30] What is the purpose of God taking Jesus
[1:57:34] to a wilderness?
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Because God don't need you just like
[1:57:37] that.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; He have a purpose.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose, my friend?
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; To be tempted of by the devil.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; What was the purpose?
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; To be tempted of the devil.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Did you read your Bible way?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; To be what?
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Tempted of the devil.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:54] God is leading you to a place
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; so that the devil can come over you.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; But remember in the presence of the
[1:58:04] enemy,
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:05] [Laughter]
[1:58:08] [Applause]
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; are we together my friend?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together my friend?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Church, I'm only read just one quote.
[1:58:24] a second quote because we need to move
[1:58:25] on. It's the an abundance of water.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Water.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; David say my cup does water
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; runth over.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; It is just a gasher of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; In the m in the presence of your enemy,
[1:58:39] God open up the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. God is leading Jesus Christ.
[1:58:52] Where?
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; In the wilderness.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; In the wilderness, a dry place for what
[1:58:56] purpose?
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; To be tempted of the devil.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Have Jesus done something wrong?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Did he sin?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Did he did something contrary to the
[1:59:07] word?
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; So why why why taking him to the
[1:59:10] temptation?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is telling Jesus,
[1:59:15] "Hey, Jesus got baptized with the Holy
[1:59:18] Ghost." He say, "Hey,
[1:59:23] where father
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; GPS wilderness
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; uh is there anybody to be prayed for
[1:59:32] there
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; go there someone is there
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; who's leading through the valley of the
[1:59:41] shadow of death
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding something
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; the enemy you try to run away from God
[1:59:49] is pushing you
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; toward him
[1:59:55] [Laughter]
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; to be what?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Tempted of the devil.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; To be tempted.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; To be tempted by who? By brother.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; The devil himself.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; The devil himself.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Why do you take a son and put him under
[2:00:10] the devil?
[2:00:14] [Laughter]
[2:00:16] You know, I I'm I am really thanking God
[2:00:19] I didn't write the Bible.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; I'm just responsible to read it.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be tempted of the devil. Verse
[2:00:28] two. And when he fasted what?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; 40 days.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; We got number 40 there.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; 40 days. And what happened?
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; 40 nights.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; And then he was what?
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Afterward in hunger.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; He got what? hungry.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Who put him to that situation of hunger?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; No. Uh oh. We need to know who led him
[2:00:47] there.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now, by leading him there, he's hungry.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Notice hunger didn't come in the place
[2:00:54] where there is food.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say he got a headache.
[2:01:04] Uhhuh.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; They target something that is not in the
[2:01:11] wilderness.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Which is what?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Food.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Food.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Who led him in the wilderness?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. And who caused him to be
[2:01:25] hungry?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't want to go there.
[2:01:28] There is no McDonald here.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; So this we found Jesus in the midst of
[2:01:39] wickedness
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; and hungry
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; and tired. And when you ask Jesus, how
[2:01:44] did you get here?
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; How did you get to this situation?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; What is the answer? Jesus say it is who?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; It is It is the Holy Ghost. It is God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Ah, you mean God taking you to a place
[2:02:01] like this?
[2:02:02] to a situation like this
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; until you become hungry
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; and then there is no food
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; what is God looking at
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; break
[2:02:15] it
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; a season in the midst of a chaos
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; verse uh three and when the what
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; tempter
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; the devil did what
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; came to him Huh? He said, "What?
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; command what?
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; That these stones be made bread.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; If thou be what?
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; The son of God,
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; command this stone to be what?
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Made bread."
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; So the devil now is tempting Jesus
[2:02:45] Christ on his power
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; and identity.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Because the son of God is God.
[2:03:03] In other words,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; in other way, the devil is telling
[2:03:09] Jesus, "If you are truly God,
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; show me a miracle right there, brother."
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look, the condition is
[2:03:22] a wilderness
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; and there is a temptation in the
[2:03:25] wilderness
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; and he's there under number 40
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; and then he's hungry.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; And then suddenly Jesus speak a
[2:03:35] scripture.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I will even continue. He
[2:03:41] says uh but he answer and say what
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; it is written.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; It is written what?
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; but by what? every word that proceedth
[2:03:51] out of the mouth of God.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Let's push the break.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; This is a court.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus read a quote.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; This court was the court of Moses.
[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was quoting Moses.
[2:04:16] A prophet, the prophet God himself
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; was quoting.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; If God is quoting, what about me?
[2:04:36] The God of heaven,
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; the one who is the author of the word,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; begin to quote a prophet.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Instead of saying I'm saying,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; I say man shall not live. He say it is
[2:04:52] written. In other words, Moses said
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; in the book of Deuteronomy,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus quoted another prophet.
[2:05:03] [Applause]
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we quote another prophet.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; There is power in the calling.
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:21] Are we together?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is calling who? Moses.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; If you run quickly, you will miss
[2:05:28] something.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the Old Testament. You
[2:05:32] don't have to. I have it here on the
[2:05:34] board for you. You can verify if you
[2:05:35] want to and find out where did Jesus get
[2:05:39] that scripture.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In other word, let me look at
[2:05:45] the me which message
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus read.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I need the date
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; and the time.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Manhattan, I need to know which
[2:05:55] message Jesus uh preach ah which message
[2:06:00] Moses preach
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; so that I can go verify.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; So we got the reference.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; It is in message
[2:06:18] uh Deuteronomy sir.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; It was preached in uh 8 and in chapter
[2:06:23] 8. I'm giving you the reference
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; so you can go get the message and open
[2:06:29] up and you can read Moses yourself
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; right my friend.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Right my friend.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; So let's go and read. Where did Jesus
[2:06:40] guard this?
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. According to Deuteronomy,
[2:06:47] that's the message.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; So Moses, so Jesus read Deuteronomy.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; He listened to the tape of Deuteronomy.
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, remember
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; what Moses said.
[2:07:06] [Music]
[2:07:10] Because Moses said so many things
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; in Deuteronomy,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; but out of all of that,
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus picked just this one.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Why did he only pick this one?
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; I have not start preaching yet.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Where in Deuteronomy 8 verse one
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; two
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; and three the Bible say and thou shall
[2:07:39] what
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; remember
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; all the way which the Lord who
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; thy God
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; did what
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; led thee.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; So Israel was led
[2:07:51] [Laughter]
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; church help me so we can move.
[2:07:58] Moses say sister Sharon. Moses say that
[2:08:02] Israel was red because I never call her.
[2:08:07] Today I call her sister say Sharon. I
[2:08:09] usually pick pick. Today I pick her.
[2:08:11] Okay. All right. Right. Brother Angelo.
[2:08:13] Ah. Brother Angelo say thumbs up. Okay.
[2:08:16] No problem. So Moses is saying that
[2:08:19] Israel also was led
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; by God.
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:26] Are we together?
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And we found Jesus also is led
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; by God.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Where did God in the Old Testament led
[2:08:40] Israel?
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And how many days
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:52] The Bible say which the Lord your God
[2:08:55] did what?
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Let thee
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; how many
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; these 40 years.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; What number is there?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; 40.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; So Israel
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Israel led
[2:09:09] by God by the Lord.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:09:19] We we already got this this this this we
[2:09:22] got 40.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Look at the
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Jesus picked that
[2:09:33] up.
[2:09:36] [Applause]
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; So we see number 40
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; and Jesus searched the scripture and say
[2:09:44] where is the 40?
[2:09:48] And the 40 came in Deuteronomy.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; He led thee how many what?
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; These 40 years
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; where
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Where was Jesus himself?
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Who led Israel in the wilderness?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; With which number?
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; 40.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is well
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. With which number?
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; 40.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; 40 years to do what?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Humble thee.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; God leading me to a place to humble me.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And to do what?
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; To prove thee.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was led to be what?
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Israel was led to do what?
[2:10:44] And and what
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; proof
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; proof means what?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Test.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; To be tested.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; We missing hunger.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; To know what was where
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; in thine heart
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; whether thou would keep his commandment
[2:11:06] or what?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Or no.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And he did what?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Humble thee.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; And suffered thee to what? hunger.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus met the condition,
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; that's it. That's it. That's it. That's
[2:11:27] it.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Jesus speak that
[2:11:32] scripture. Because when Jesus look at
[2:11:34] his condition,
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; he map the condition to the Old
[2:11:38] Testament.
[2:11:41] I hope we are together.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; And he found out that there is a case
[2:11:45] like him
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; that was wilderness
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; testing
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; for the
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; hunger. Jesus said that's the answer.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; I hope we are. Is it too much?
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. He says to do what? to hunger thee
[2:12:09] and to do and and he did what?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Fed thee with mana.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Fed thee with what?
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Mana.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Mana.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; There is a new element right here.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; When Israel was hungry, God gave Israel
[2:12:22] what?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Mana.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Mana is the food of what?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Angels.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jump to verse 11 on Matthew 4.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; J to verse 11 on Matthew 4.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for folks. We there.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then the devil did what?
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Leaveth him.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And behold, what?
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Angels came and ministered unto him.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; So who brought Jesus food?
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Angels.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Can you verify your Bible?
[2:13:03] Can you verify your Bible?
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Who brought Jesus the food?
[2:13:17] Amen.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; And in this temptation,
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Is the place Jesus taught the devil who
[2:13:32] he was.
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Go back to verse seven.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Go back to verse seven.
[2:13:44] Jesus said to him what
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; it is written again
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; if it is written at them you shall not
[2:13:50] what
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; tempt the Lord
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; stop the devil was tempting who
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; he was tempting Jesus and Jesus is
[2:14:00] telling the devil you are tempting who
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; God
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; the Lord means Elohim
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; because David said the Lord is my
[2:14:09] shepherd
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; he say you are tempting the Lord Who?
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Thy God?
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; The God. The Lord who?
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Thy God.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; The God of who?
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, look at your Bible. He's tempting
[2:14:26] the He's telling the devil. You are
[2:14:28] tempting who?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord, the God of who?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are tempting your
[2:14:34] creator.
[2:14:35] [Applause]
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:38] [Applause]
[2:14:40] [Music]
[2:14:42] I hope we are together.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; So this trial is an opportunity
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; giving to Jesus to declare to the devil
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; face to face
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; who he is.
[2:15:02] Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we are together.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Is this too strong?
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 10.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Drop to verse 10.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus did what?
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Say unto him.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Say to him, do what?
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Get thee. Hence, Satan.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Because it is what?
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; He's quoting again.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; You shall do what?
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord thy God.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; You shall worship who?
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God. So he's telling the
[2:15:31] devil, you should worship who?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; And him only shall you what?
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Serve.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, Satan, you need to not
[2:15:41] not me worshiping you.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; You are the one to worship me and to
[2:15:46] serve me.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is recalibrating
[2:15:50] the devil.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. If you notice,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; if you notice, the devil say if you are.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; So the devil was not really sure
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; of who he was dealing with.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; So God want to clear the devil mind
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; about who Jesus is.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; So God led Jesus to the devil
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; so he can make sure the devil knows who
[2:16:19] he's dealing with. So your trial is an
[2:16:22] opportunity
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; that God is giving you
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; to unveil yourself
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; so the devil know who he's dealing with.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Jesus could have been
[2:16:44] looking at the wilderness,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; looking at the temptation, focusing on
[2:16:49] the hunger and 40 days and whatever, but
[2:16:52] those were map for him to give him the
[2:16:56] scripture.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Who led him to this God?
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; What looks to be a chaos
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; turn to a powerful victory.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say in the book of Luke 4,
[2:17:15] and when the devil had what?
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Ended all the temptation,
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; he departed from him for what?
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; A season.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; A season.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, he got so burned he
[2:17:26] saidm.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; He departed from Jesus from for a what?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Season.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; So who got a season?
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; So your trial give the devil a season.
[2:17:42] You didn't get that.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; The trial that you go through will give
[2:17:46] the devil a season.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, you're telling the devil
[2:17:49] for a while, stay away.
[2:17:52] [Applause]
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus is coming out of that trial.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe all of us will imagine Jesus
[2:18:05] coming
[2:18:08] Oh,
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; what happened? I fought with the devil.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; It was rough, man.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the trial did to Jesus.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "And Jesus returned." How?
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; In the power of the
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; what?
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; He returned how?
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; In the power of the
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; So, you going to be more powerful after
[2:18:33] the trial than before the trial.
[2:18:39] I hope we are together.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; He returned with what?
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; In the power of the spirit
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; into what?
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Galilee.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; And they went out what?
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; A fame of him through
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; throughout all the region round about
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; that tri open up a big anointing.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; A miracle in the life of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of chaos.
[2:19:07] Watch after the trial.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's a blessed season that follow your
[2:19:14] trial.
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:16] [Applause]
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; And let's finish our scripture to John
[2:19:24] 17.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Then we start preaching.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hurry and then we start
[2:19:30] preaching.
[2:19:38] We already toward the 130 coat. Now you
[2:19:41] are acting like this.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; This thing is loaded withund and
[2:19:48] something code.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; John 17. If you there you can say amen.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; So let's finish our scripture reading
[2:19:56] verse 14.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus says what? This is the prayer of
[2:20:01] Jesus. He's saying what? I have what?
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Given them my word.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus has given them what?
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Thy word.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, I gave them the
[2:20:10] essential thing.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; The man thing were given to them.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; The word. I have given them what?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Thy word.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; And the world does what?
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Has hated them.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; So do you expect the world to love you
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; when you have the word?
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; And the world did what?
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Have hated them. Why?
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Because they are not of the world.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; Because they are not what?
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Of the world.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Even as what?
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; I am not of the world.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is saying me and my disciple
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; we are not of this world.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are stranger.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; We came from another higher
[2:20:49] civilization.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Because of that this world
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; will not like you.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; That's why you different.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you behave
[2:21:00] different.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's why you act different.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; That's why you dress different. That's
[2:21:06] why your thinking is different.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Because you come from somewhere else.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; This is not your civilization.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Your civilization is higher than this.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. I pray not
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; that you shall
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; take them out of the world. Ah,
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; the world is not our home.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; It's a bad place.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; If it's a bad place, a normal parent
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; will snatch you out of the bad place.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Because it's not your home.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is pushing the prayer.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; And we know the prayer of Jesus, I
[2:21:47] always answer.
[2:21:49] And instead of Jesus saying, "So because
[2:21:52] they are not of this world,
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; father, take them out quickly,
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; I'm now praying that you pull them out."
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Ah, so you want us to stay in this
[2:22:04] condition.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; I wish I can get where I want to go. He
[2:22:08] say, I pray not that you should what?
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Take them out of the world,
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; but that you should what?
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Keep them from the evil.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are understanding. Put your
[2:22:17] seat belt and follow me.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying the place is a chaos.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Normally the the the the normal sense
[2:22:31] way
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; is to get you out of chaos.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:22:38] father. Don't get them out of chaos.
[2:22:40] Don't rest.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Don't rescue them,
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; but just keep them in chaos,
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; but keep them from the devil.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; In other word, you have been prayed for.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; To stand in the midst of a cous,
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:00] [Applause]
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; let me start it again.
[2:23:06] Jesus already prayed for you
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; so that whenever you find yourself in
[2:23:11] chaos,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; you won't fail.
[2:23:14] [Applause]
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Because the purpose of Jesus
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; is not to remove you from chaos.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus want you to stay there
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want you to fail.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; So what is his purpose of living as in a
[2:23:28] chaos?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, "Father, I
[2:23:33] pray not that you should take them out
[2:23:35] of the world, but that you do what?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Keep them from the evil.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; They are not of the world,
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; even as I am not of the world."
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Sanctify them through what?
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Thy truth.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; And your word is what?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. As you have done what?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Sent me into the world.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; So I do what?
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; I have also sent them into the world.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; How did the father send Jesus Christ?
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; To him. Exactly.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus come into the word? The
[2:24:05] father entering Jesus Christ.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying the same way you
[2:24:09] send me.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; That's the same way I'm sending them.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is not really
[2:24:17] sending you.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; God is going with you
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; and he is in you
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; even with you.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, God
[2:24:30] doesn't leave you in the chaos
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; and he is outside.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; No, he leave you there and he enter
[2:24:38] inside of you
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; and he sit in the midst of the chaos.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; So that when the devil is coming to you
[2:24:46] beyond human skin,
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; there is a God right there.
[2:24:54] [Applause]
[2:24:56] David say he anointed. That was the Old
[2:25:00] Testament.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, the anointing is
[2:25:03] not outside. It is inside of you.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, the shepherd is right
[2:25:09] there.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; I have to skip certain things quickly to
[2:25:20] get to the point.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; My God. Lord help me. If I read this, we
[2:25:25] won't get it.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; If I read this, we won't get it.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to skip some so we can get to
[2:25:35] the because I have now started
[2:25:37] preaching.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Let me see what I can skip quickly.
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Ah.
[2:25:50] Ah.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to Jeremiah 27. I
[2:25:54] have to skip some of them. I'm sorry. I
[2:25:56] don't have any choice. Let's go to
[2:25:57] Jeremiah 27.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Let me skip. We just started preaching.
[2:26:02] Okay.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; So, stretch up and everything and
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; uh look at your table. Prepare. Amen.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; If if if you continue this way, how are
[2:26:16] we going to finish?
[2:26:18] Let's go to Jeremiah 27
[2:26:21] verse one. If you there, you can say
[2:26:23] amen.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; I was trying to get you the the
[2:26:26] background behind this, but let me leave
[2:26:27] the background. Let me stay somewhere
[2:26:29] for closer.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Job to verse uh
[2:26:38] six. I'm going to skip this again
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; if you there. Verse six. He says, "What
[2:26:44] now? I have given what?
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; All these lands." To who?
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; The hand of Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; The king of what?
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Of Babylon.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Who?
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; My servant.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; We all clear on that one.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Ah, message believer. The Bible is
[2:27:00] saying Nebuchadnezzar who
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; my servant.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem still with that?
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know who God gave the vision of
[2:27:11] all the gentile kingdom?
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; He gave it to who?
[2:27:19] Even the capstone
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; you have a problem. The capstone
[2:27:25] ministry, the stone that is coming out
[2:27:27] of hand and then cutting the mountain,
[2:27:30] he give it to who?
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; So the vision of the gentile
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; and the end of the gentile and the
[2:27:41] ministry of brother Brandon was given to
[2:27:44] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:27:47] If you have any, it's in the book of
[2:27:49] Daniel.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; And if you go to the book of Daniel,
[2:27:54] when Nebuchadnezzar begin to get proud,
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; God came and corrected him
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; and God saved his kingdom. Yes.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; When Nebuchadnezzar was in Brockton
[2:28:06] Hospital.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Where he had a depression, God kept his
[2:28:11] throne.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; So that no one become a king
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; until his days of depression are
[2:28:16] finished.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; And Nebuchadnezzar came back and begin
[2:28:20] to praise the Lord God of Israel.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; It is written in your Bible.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; That's why God said Nebuchadnezzar my
[2:28:27] servant.
[2:28:29] [Music]
[2:28:30] [Applause]
[2:28:31] Are we together now?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; I have given to my servant and he and
[2:28:38] the what?
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; The beast of the field
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; that I have done what?
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Have given him?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Verse seven. And all nations shall do
[2:28:44] what?
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Serve him
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; and do what?
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; His son
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; His son's son.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Until the very time of his land come.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. So Nebuchadnezzar is a servant of
[2:28:54] the Lord.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; We saw last Sunday that God even gave
[2:28:57] him a salary.
[2:28:59] Are we clear?
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; When we speak about the stories, most of
[2:29:03] us are struggling
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; because of the name Babylon.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; But Babylon was a gentile
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; and the king was Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; And when we talk about captive in
[2:29:16] Babylon, it is a little bit vague
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; because we don't know who is there.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Let's zeroed in and see who are among
[2:29:26] the captives. Let's go to Daniel 1.
[2:29:30] [Music]
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Daniel chapter one.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Remember the quote, brother Brown, I'm
[2:29:40] told, brother Navy, you're just getting
[2:29:42] started.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Daniel chapter one. I skip a
[2:29:50] lot, so I spared you.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter one. You there?
[2:29:56] Amen.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; In the reign of what?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; The third year of the of
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Jehoakim. I was trying to show you all
[2:30:03] the background of Jehoakim. I put it
[2:30:05] side. In the third year of the reign of
[2:30:08] Jehoakim, who
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; king of Judah
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; came who?
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Of what?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; King of Babylon.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; To what?
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; So we find Nebuchadnezzar in the book of
[2:30:20] Daniel.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; So Daniel was in the time of Jeremiah.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; We we are we are moving on now.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; We are moving on my friend.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when we say
[2:30:39] Jeremiah we usually think it's another
[2:30:41] book. No. Jeremiah was in the time of
[2:30:44] Daniel.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Daniel was a little boy
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; when Jeremiah was prophesying. And the
[2:30:50] way he knew he was time to go back, it
[2:30:53] was by reading Jeremiah.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; That's why pastor say read your 70 weeks
[2:31:01] of Daniel. You should have caught that
[2:31:03] from there.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Nebuchadnezzar was
[2:31:07] in the time of Daniel
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; and God took a major prophet
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; by the name of Daniel
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; and move him to Babylon
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; not to Jerusalem
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Babylon
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; to Babylon.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend are we clear?
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Verse uh Job to verse uh three so we can
[2:31:32] spend time. We can spare time.
[2:31:36] Let's go, my friend.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; And the king spake into
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And the king spoke to Ashpenas,
[2:31:42] the master of his unic,
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; that he should bring certain of the
[2:31:46] children of water,
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Israel,
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; of the water,
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; the king seed.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; So this is a royal seed.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; It's the king's seed. The royal seed.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; So Nebuchadnezzar was looking for a
[2:32:01] royal seed.
[2:32:04] Are we together?
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; A royal seed and of the water.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; The princes.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; The princes. Come on. Verse four. I'm
[2:32:12] sorry. Children in whom there is water,
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; no blemish,
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; but water,
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; well favored.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, the handsome.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Ah, handsome brothers. Okay, let's go.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; You see, it say handsome. They say they
[2:32:29] were handsome. That's what the Bible
[2:32:30] say. Amen.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; The brothers look good.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; They were no blemish.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; They look good.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; And they were what?
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Skillful in
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; water. Wisdom
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; and in and and cunning in what?
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Knowledge
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; and understanding of what?
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Science.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; And such as had ability in them to do
[2:32:51] what?
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; Stand in the king's palace.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; And whom they had to teach the learning
[2:32:55] and the tongue of what?
[2:32:57] So Nebuchadnezzar begin to look for some
[2:33:00] student
[2:33:01] [Music]
[2:33:02] [Applause]
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; that are very skillful
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; to bring them and to teach them in the
[2:33:12] language of the Kadine so that they can
[2:33:14] serve the Babylonian
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; not serve the Jews the Babylonian.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. We getting
[2:33:22] somewhere.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; Where are we at my friend?
[2:33:25] uh verse uh five and the king did what?
[2:33:28] appointed them a daily pro
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; a daily provision of the king's what
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; meat. So there is two type here. Of the
[2:33:36] king's meat, they gave them the king's
[2:33:38] meat.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; The king's food.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; And of the what?
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; The wine.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; There is the king meat and the wine.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; This wine is the wine of Babylon.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Of the king's meat and the wine. Amen.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Where? Which he drank. So nourishing
[2:34:02] them what?
[2:34:04] 3 years that at the end thereof they
[2:34:06] must stand before water.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Now these were the children of Judah
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; that went to captivity.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Their name was who?
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Daniel. So Daniel we because when we
[2:34:23] went in Jeremiah and Jeremiah say built
[2:34:27] houses do this. We didn't know who was
[2:34:29] there. Now we need to know. Now we start
[2:34:31] knowing some of the people that were
[2:34:33] there.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; We found out that over there was
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[2:34:38] That's right.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; In Babylon.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Remember God already left
[2:34:45] Jerusalem
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; and God went to Babylon. As a matter of
[2:34:51] fact, when they put Daniel
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; and his four uh I mean friend,
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; when they put them in the fire,
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; I mean Shadrach, Mach, Abene in the
[2:35:03] fire, God appear in Babylon.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel was not there. He
[2:35:15] appear as a as Mechisedc,
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; a son of God in the midst of Babylon.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; So Mechisedc appear in Babylon.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; When you see Babylon, watch for
[2:35:31] Mechisedc.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melkisedc?
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:36] [Applause]

[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; And then the fourth one, the the name of
[2:36:12] what? I do.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. But Daniel, follow me my
[2:36:17] friend,
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; purpose in his heart that he will not
[2:36:21] defile himself.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; With the portion of water,
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; the king's me,
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; nor with the water,
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; the one which he drank.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; God is bringing this boy in the midst of
[2:36:32] a chaos.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; But Jesus say, I'm not praying
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; that you take them out.
[2:36:43] Leave them there,
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; but only protect them
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; from evil.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; Give them the anointing.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; They will know how to separate Babylon
[2:36:54] from the word of God.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; Some of you, your engine are running
[2:37:03] low, my friend.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; You need a jump boost, my friend.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[2:37:10] Jesus pray.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; don't get them out of the world.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Leave them there
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; but just keep them
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; from the evil.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; So God will never took Daniel out.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm saying
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; because I was telling brother Robert
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; I say message believer
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; we're not trained in the daily lives.
[2:37:39] That's the truth.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; And the devil use our daily living
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; to attack us every day.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; We were trained on the rapture
[2:37:50] level,
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; but never trained on the daily living.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; We were not trained how to live in
[2:37:56] university.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; We want everybody in the university to
[2:38:01] be saved.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; That's not the case.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; You must be in the midst of the devil.
[2:38:08] that you must keep yourself
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; from the evil one.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[2:38:16] [Applause]
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Please shake somebody, my friend.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; We can't play game this time. We need to
[2:38:24] climb, my friend.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Young people, you who go to university,
[2:38:32] listen to me.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; You who are going to public school,
[2:38:35] listen to me.
[2:38:40] Are we together?
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; I told brother Robert, I said we were
[2:38:44] not trained
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; in how to live a normal life.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; Until when we get into your first job,
[2:38:50] you lost
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; because you want everybody to message
[2:38:54] believer.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; No. The anointing flows in the midst of
[2:39:00] a chaos.
[2:39:08] God never took Daniel back.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; He left Daniel there,
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; but he gave him the anointing
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; to withstand evil.
[2:39:17] [Applause]
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:22] [Applause]
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; When I'm going to get to this age of La,
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; you will be surprised. I'm going to read
[2:39:30] brother Braham.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? The Bible says he he he
[2:39:33] will not defile with the portion of
[2:39:35] water
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; nor with the water.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Therefore he requested of the princes of
[2:39:41] the unic that he might not defile water
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; himself. So we find this young man here,
[2:39:47] this gentleman here
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; in Babylon, very young brother Brandham
[2:39:52] say he went in the age of 12
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; or 14 years old
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; and he's still there in Babylon
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; and he was taken captive
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; so it's a disaster
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; he's leaving the Jerusalem
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; he's leaving the temple
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; he's leaving the the prophet Jeremiah I
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; and going into the land of uh Babylon.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Who? Because the Bible says, "I'm the
[2:40:26] Lord who led you to captivity." He was
[2:40:28] saying there it was the Lord who took
[2:40:31] Daniel over there.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So the season of Daniel
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; was not in in in uh in Israel.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:40:47] The season of Daniel was not over there
[2:40:50] in Jerusalem,
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; not in the holy land.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; The season of Daniel was in the midst of
[2:40:58] a chaos.
[2:40:59] [Music]
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; So when Daniel goes outside,
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; he sees naked women.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; When he goes outside, he sees women with
[2:41:11] tattoo. He see people drinking
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; and he wonder why did you lead me here?
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; But the promotion of Daniel in Babylon,
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; the vision of Daniel in Babylon.
[2:41:32] [Music]
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Listen to this, my
[2:41:37] friend. Brother Brham says this for
[2:41:39] those who have a hard time now because
[2:41:42] this is a hard lesson.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; If you tired I need to stop
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; because this end game
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; in the message water
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; hearing
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; recognizing
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; acting on the word of God.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; We will know it today as the law of
[2:41:58] what?
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Contrast.
[2:42:01] Yes sir.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Tell your friend
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; don't leave this church without
[2:42:06] understanding contrast.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; You finished?
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention please.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; that where there is what?
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; There is what?
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Evil.
[2:42:30] season in the midst of what
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; chaos.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; We all want to remove everything.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work like that
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; in the presence of your enemy.
[2:42:41] [Music]
[2:42:41] [Applause]
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus will lead you. God will lead Jesus
[2:42:50] Christ in the wilderness.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother said, remember this
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; from today. There is a law called the
[2:42:57] law of water.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Contrast.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; You who are in high school, mid school
[2:43:01] or whatever, pay attention. If you are
[2:43:02] sad, come back in here.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; If you are in the bathroom, come back
[2:43:08] here.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; There is a law of contrast that where
[2:43:16] there is what
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; good,
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; there is what?
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Evil.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Where there is what?
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; There is what?
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Wrong.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; And we will never
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:26] In this world,
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; in this world,
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; even if you create a message camp
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; where nobody's there but only message
[2:43:36] people,
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; remember this.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; Even in the church,
[2:43:43] remember this.
[2:43:45] [Applause]
[2:43:50] [Music]
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Make sure everybody that is outside come
[2:43:53] back here.

[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; we will never no matter
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; noatter

[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; our environment may be
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; what our environment may be
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; ever be able to shake ourself
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; from the presence of what?
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; Ivan.
[2:44:24] In other word, you cannot function
[2:44:26] correctly
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; without adversity.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Even in the church.
[2:44:35] [Music]
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; That's why people have a problem in the
[2:44:41] church.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Because when they come in the church,
[2:44:44] you have your own conception.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; Everybody must be nice.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; You are wrong.
[2:44:53] And then when you get offended by
[2:44:55] somebody, you want to leave the church,
[2:44:57] you go to another church, you found it.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; You need to be tough.
[2:45:07] [Applause]
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, if I'm receiving my
[2:45:11] daily food in that church,
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're doing.
[2:45:17] [Applause]
[2:45:23] I am not
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; I am not going to leave my blessing
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; to please you.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; This is how many people are missing the
[2:45:35] blessing
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; because they get offended sometime. It's
[2:45:40] not the pastor.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; It might be your brother.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; It might be your sister.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; It might be your deacon. But remember a
[2:45:47] season
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; sir

[2:45:51] [Music]

[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; You anointed me in the presence of what?
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; In the presence of evil.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Even among the disciple,
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; God have to pick a Judah.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; He was necessary.
[2:46:36] [Applause]
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; If you were Judas, is that your problem?
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; But me, I'm preaching to the seed of
[2:46:42] God.
[2:46:43] [Applause]
[2:46:43] [Music]
[2:46:46] Brother,

[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother say when I will do
[2:46:52] good, what happened?

[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; The Christian.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; The Christian from what?
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; The sinner.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; There will be a what?
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; A witness there.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Of what?
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; Of right.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; And a testimony of what?
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; Of wrong.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; How many time?
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; Always.
[2:47:13] [Music]
[2:47:14] You go to work, it's there.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; To your school, it's there.
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; To the campus, it's there.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; In Walmart, it's there.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; At the restaurant, it's there.
[2:47:26] [Music]
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; Instead of focusing to the bad,
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; look at your season.

[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; Your choice.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; You have to take what?
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; One side

[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; And Daniel stood. He said, "Uh-uh.
[2:48:04] I know I ain't leaving there,
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; but I'm not going to do this
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; because the prayer of Jesus Christ,
[2:48:11] don't take him up,
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; leave them there,
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; but just keep him from the evil.

[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Alone with God.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; So you don't need to be with somebody.
[2:50:10] [Music]
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be two on campus.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Even if I'm alone,

[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; I need to leave Babylon and go back to
[2:50:47] Jerusalem.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; I'm staying in Babylon.

[2:51:13] that there is a difference between these

[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; after all the words you heard,
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; you are the master of circumstances.
[2:51:54] [Applause]
[2:51:55] [Music]
[2:51:56] When you enter school, you look you say,
[2:51:58] "Father,
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; may I be an example for them
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; so that one day they will ask me, why am
[2:52:05] I different?
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; Let me make a difference.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Not compromise with them.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together,
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; my friend? Are we together?" When you go
[2:52:19] to school, they must see you
[2:52:20] differently.
[2:52:23] You cannot play with other people.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; You don't need everybody to be there.
[2:52:28] You alone.
[2:52:30] [Applause]
[2:52:30] [Music]
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Father, help me.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; How many years?
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want to start preaching
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; because this is supposed to be a
[2:52:43] teaching message.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; But how many years? 68 years
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; he kept the what?
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; The victory
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; and was how
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; undefiled before God.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; God never took Daniel out
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; because God is trying to prove the devil
[2:53:01] something.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; Never. And he was what?
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; Undefiled
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; before who?
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:53:07] &gt;&gt; Without what?
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:53:12] [Music]
[2:53:12] [Applause]
[2:53:17] I made a mistake because I didn't have
[2:53:19] the Holy Ghost yet.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; Daniel without the Holy Ghost.
[2:53:26] [Music]
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; In Jerusalem,
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; in Jerusalem, you can be a hypocrite.
[2:53:35] &gt;&gt; In Babylon is where we see the true
[2:53:37] color.
[2:53:43] You are now moving my friend. Flat tent
[2:53:45] and prepare for landing.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; He says without the water
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; without what?
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; to make intercession for him
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; with only the blood of what?
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; Bulls and goats
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; And heers
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; which he had to offer. How?
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; Secretly
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; because of the hidden tradition of the
[2:54:06] land.
[2:54:09] Lord
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[2:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; ousted from what?
[2:54:24] &gt;&gt; His church
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; without one church service.
[2:54:28] [Music]
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; Any church to go to?" without what
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; any hymns to be sang

[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; I don't have any friend in school.
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; You don't need a friend.
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; You got a friend in Jesus. You don't
[2:56:40] need a friend.
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm only alone in school. Young people,
[2:56:46] you don't need a friend.
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; I know this is hard.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; I know this is hard. You can have a
[2:56:54] classmate, but you don't need a friend.
[2:56:58] A friend is different than a classmate.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; Because how can two fellowship except
[2:57:08] today?
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; You don't agree. Where is your
[2:57:11] fellowship?

[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; Their idols.

[2:57:39] same thing he did.
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; So why do you go on campus and you want
[2:57:46] people to believe like you?
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; Why do you go on school and you want
[2:57:50] people to believe like you? You get in
[2:57:52] Walmart and you about to pass out like
[2:57:54] everybody in Walmart should believe the
[2:57:56] message.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; 14 years old when he was what?
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; Taken down.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; But what did he do?
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Hell true to God. And he understood by
[2:58:21] who?
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah's prophet
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; that the days were almost what?
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; Accomplished
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; in Babylon. He was reading Jeremiah.
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; His eyes was on bad.
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; When he's on campus, if he has a
[2:58:38] downtown, he's reading the seven
[2:58:40] churches,
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; eating his sandwich.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; If you ask him how was school today, he
[2:58:52] say it was fun.
[2:58:53] &gt;&gt; Mom, I was reading something brother
[2:58:54] Brandham said.
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; You were reading something brother. Yes.
[2:58:58] He didn't see anything that is going on
[2:59:00] in school.
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother say Daniel taking the word
[2:59:09] of what?
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; From Jeremiah
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; goes down where?
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; Into Babylon.
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; He enter Babylon with the scroll of
[2:59:15] Jeremiah.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; That's all he need.
[2:59:19] Yes, sir.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; Where are you at? In Babylon.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; But I got Jeremiah.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; That's all I need. As long as I got
[2:59:26] Jeremiah in Babylon
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; because Jeremiah prophesy about Babylon.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; As long as the message
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; in the midst of this Babylon.
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:59:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "And he was the what?
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; Anointed prophet." He performed what?
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; Miracles
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; A sign.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; Could interpret what?
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; Unknown tongues
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; and done signs and wonder where
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; among them
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; among the Jews.
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; Where?
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; So the working field of Daniel
[3:00:06] &gt;&gt; was in Babylon,
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; not in Jerusalem.
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; His season was in Babylon. He have to
[3:00:14] manifest God among the hidden. That's
[3:00:17] it.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:00:23] &gt;&gt; I know some of you want to go home.
[3:00:25] Don't worry. We heading to the airport.
[3:00:26] Amen. Amen. He don't stand and wand
[3:00:30] among them. Yet standing how?
[3:00:31] &gt;&gt; Alone.
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; How?
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; By himself.
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; He stood how?
[3:00:35] &gt;&gt; Alone.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; You are more focusing on Babylon.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; Who's the prime minister on Babylon?
[3:00:45] They just changed the prime minister.
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; They changed the governor of the state.
[3:00:49] Quit looking at that.
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; Focus on what is important.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; This boy stood and refused the king's
[3:01:01] meat
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; and refused the wine of the king.
[3:01:05] &gt;&gt; What does the king mix represent?
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother said there was
[3:01:11] no man. There was a man named who?
[3:01:13] Daniel once.
[3:01:14] &gt;&gt; Who did who was where?
[3:01:16] &gt;&gt; In the lion's den.
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know who appeared in the lion's
[3:01:19] den?
[3:01:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; He was who?
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord in which form?
[3:01:25] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire.
[3:01:27] &gt;&gt; So, the pillar of fire was no longer in
[3:01:29] Israel.
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; I hope you are swallowing that. I hope
[3:01:36] you can swallow that. I hope you are
[3:01:39] swallowing that. The pillar of fire left
[3:01:41] Israel and appear where
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos.
[3:01:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:01:53] &gt;&gt; And my question is why did the pillar of
[3:01:55] fire appear?
[3:01:57] &gt;&gt; What was the what triggered the pillar
[3:01:59] of fire to appear?
[3:02:00] &gt;&gt; Because Daniel was praying every day.
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire never appeared.
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; Chaos. Yes,
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire never appear.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; But when they begin to put pressure on
[3:02:12] prayer,
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; when the persecution come
[3:02:19] &gt;&gt; above prayer
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; and they put him in the lion's den in
[3:02:23] the presence of my enemy, the pillar of
[3:02:26] fire appear.
[3:02:31] [Applause]
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; Not in Israel, in Babylon. Until
[3:02:41] the king begin to pray for Daniel.
[3:02:49] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; The king Saras was praying for Daniel
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; and he woke up in the morning and came
[3:02:56] say are you still alive? He say yes king
[3:03:01] I'm alive
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; in the midst of lion
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; in the midst of lion that's when the
[3:03:09] pillar of fire came
[3:03:11] [Applause]
[3:03:13] &gt;&gt; a season to see God in the midst of lion
[3:03:17] when they hid it the furnace seven times
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the fire
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; you didn't get me my friend when they
[3:03:27] were praying at home God ever appear.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; But when they put them in the fire
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; and they hid it the fire seven time,
[3:03:37] when they increase the trial, it brings
[3:03:40] God down.
[3:03:42] [Applause]
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; And now they were fellowshipping with
[3:03:46] God.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of a chaos.
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What are you trying to say?
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; Let's stop on uh this thought and I hit
[3:04:02] the air the tarmac brother say he went
[3:04:06] down where
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; into Babylon
[3:04:08] &gt;&gt; and he said in himself that he was not
[3:04:10] going to do what?
[3:04:11] &gt;&gt; Defile himself with the king's meat.
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; The king's meat. Come he was not going
[3:04:16] to have anything to do with what?
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; The world.
[3:04:21] &gt;&gt; He said in himself
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; that's it. I don't need anybody to help
[3:04:27] me.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going there, but I'm not going to
[3:04:30] defile myself.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get into campus, but I
[3:04:33] won't defile myself.
[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to school, but I won't
[3:04:36] defile myself.
[3:04:38] &gt;&gt; It's a decision
[3:04:40] &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost.
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; Friend or no friend, that is not my
[3:04:49] problem.
[3:04:50] &gt;&gt; I came here to get education
[3:04:53] &gt;&gt; and once I finish education, I'm out. I
[3:04:55] don't need no alpha, capa, theta,
[3:04:57] whatever.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to the ball game.
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to anything.
[3:05:05] &gt;&gt; I came here to get education.
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:05:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:05:13] &gt;&gt; He says through though he had lived
[3:05:16] where?
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; Among them people
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; but he was not going to what?
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; He was living among them.
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He purposed his heart that what
[3:05:26] &gt;&gt; he wasn't.
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; Look at this my friend brother and the
[3:05:30] Bible says in the book of Revelation 17
[3:05:32] that and there came one of the seven
[3:05:34] angel which have what
[3:05:35] &gt;&gt; the seven vows
[3:05:36] &gt;&gt; and talk with me saying unto me do what?
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; Come hither.
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; I will show unto thee the judgment of
[3:05:42] what?
[3:05:42] &gt;&gt; The great
[3:05:43] &gt;&gt; that city water
[3:05:45] &gt;&gt; many waters
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; with whom the kings of the earth has
[3:05:48] committed what? fornication.
[3:05:50] &gt;&gt; And the inhabitant of the earth has been
[3:05:52] made drunk with the what?
[3:05:54] &gt;&gt; Wine of her fornication.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; The wine of what?
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; Her fornication.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; Remember Daniel refused one over there.
[3:06:01] And it was the wine of Babylon.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say upon her forehead.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; The one who had the wine was written
[3:06:08] what?
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; Mystery Babylon.
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; It was the wine of Babylon.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother, brother say
[3:06:19] she had a cup in her hand full of what?
[3:06:22] &gt;&gt; Wine of her fornication.
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; Her water,
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; her filthiness,
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; her doctrine
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; that she c she was causing the kings.
[3:06:30] Oh, just have a little prayer and pray
[3:06:33] you out of her purgatory and all these
[3:06:35] things and there you are. So the wine
[3:06:37] was the doctrine, the teaching of
[3:06:40] Babylon.
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; He was in Babylon but not in the
[3:06:44] teaching of Babylon. He has the
[3:06:47] internet, but he didn't get on the
[3:06:50] teaching of the internet.
[3:06:52] &gt;&gt; He used the internet for what is normal.
[3:06:55] &gt;&gt; He knew how to get on the internet,
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; but stay focused.
[3:07:00] [Music]
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; Daniel was not removed from Babylon.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; But in Babylon, he was separated by his
[3:07:14] faith. Amen.
[3:07:16] &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation 18, the Bible say,
[3:07:19] "Come out of it.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; Come out of the system,
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; the religion of Babylon, but it doesn't
[3:07:28] tell you leave this world.
[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; The coming out of Babylon is not that
[3:07:37] you're going to leave this world
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; and go build a message camp.
[3:07:45] You stay in the midst of it, but you
[3:07:47] come off from the system.
[3:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; All right, let's finish with this my
[3:07:57] friend. Brother say in Germany once I
[3:08:00] saw a picture and it always does what?
[3:08:03] &gt;&gt; Stuck with me.
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; What is that picture, my friend?
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; A German painter has painted a picture
[3:08:07] that's called the cloud land.
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And when you see it off at a
[3:08:11] distance, it's the horriblest looking
[3:08:13] gloom you ever seen.
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; When you look at that picture from far
[3:08:16] off,
[3:08:18] &gt;&gt; it looks like something very horrible.
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead.
[3:08:23] &gt;&gt; Just clouds mattered together.
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; Cloud mattered together. When you are
[3:08:27] looking it from what?
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; A long distance.
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; But when you get where
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; real close to it,
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; it does what?
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; It changes.
[3:08:36] &gt;&gt; It's water. It's angels
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; wings beating water
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; together
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; singing water
[3:08:40] &gt;&gt; hallelujah to the Lord
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos.
[3:08:45] &gt;&gt; So that is that is what gloom is
[3:08:48] sometime
[3:08:51] &gt;&gt; if you look at it a long distance it
[3:08:55] looks what
[3:08:55] &gt;&gt; gloomy and dark
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; but take God how
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; at his word
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; and be certain that he's God and move up
[3:09:02] how
[3:09:02] &gt;&gt; close to it
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; not away from it.
[3:09:05] [Laughter]
[3:09:07] Not away from it. Move what?
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; Close to it.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; You shall find out that it's just what
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; angel's wings are beating together.
[3:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says this, we
[3:09:16] think we have it hard.
[3:09:19] &gt;&gt; And sometime trials come and I think of
[3:09:22] this woman where
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; in the wheelchair
[3:09:24] &gt;&gt; and these children, you are there with a
[3:09:26] hot trouble. Maybe dead in the week from
[3:09:28] now, eat up with cancer. Amen. Look how
[3:09:32] &gt;&gt; awful dark. But if you just keep getting
[3:09:34] how
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; coming closer to God
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; and find out his purpose
[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; it is what
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; angels of God
[3:09:42] &gt;&gt; ready to what
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; rejoice for a victory
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; that God want to give sometime it is
[3:09:47] what
[3:09:47] &gt;&gt; in disguisement
[3:09:49] &gt;&gt; it's a blessing in dis in disguisement
[3:09:52] it looks bad
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; but the shepherd is leading you
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; and if God is leading you no matter how
[3:09:59] bad it is
[3:10:01] &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos
[3:10:03] Watch for the season.
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; Let's stop here.
[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; You go chew this and we pick up again.
[3:10:18] &gt;&gt; Then we will pick up Jeremiah 29.
[3:10:21] Amen.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; Who is leading?
[3:10:32] If he's leading me, why is this
[3:10:34] happening?
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; Because we thought when he's
[3:10:41] he's leading us, we are shielded.
[3:10:45] &gt;&gt; No,
[3:10:47] he's calibrating everything.
[3:10:50] &gt;&gt; He's protecting Job.
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; He's the one that lift the ages
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; for a purpose. Amen.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; But when he left the hedges, he didn't
[3:11:01] leave Job alone.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; He was still right there monitoring
[3:11:04] everything that is going on.
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's a shepherd that is leading you.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; Not to take you out. Daniel could get in
[3:11:12] Babylon and keep focusing in Palestine.
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; Palestine was a direction of prayer.
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; Because he need to stay by the word.
[3:11:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the word say if you in
[3:11:25] a foreign land just look for the
[3:11:27] direction of Jerusalem.
[3:11:31] &gt;&gt; So he had to apply the word to get his
[3:11:33] prayer answered.
[3:11:35] &gt;&gt; But he didn't know that the entire
[3:11:37] kingdom the entire capstone ministry
[3:11:40] everything was given to Daniel. Not in
[3:11:42] Jerusalem. It was given over there. The
[3:11:45] angel of the Lord appeared there. The
[3:11:47] pillar of fire appear over there.
[3:11:50] And you will see later how God is
[3:11:53] working with those kings
[3:11:56] &gt;&gt; because he called Nebuchadnezzar his
[3:11:58] servant.
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; Whoever is on top just know that the
[3:12:03] servant of God
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; even your supervisor there have nothing
[3:12:08] to do
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; because Jesus look at pilot he said
[3:12:10] there is no power given to you except
[3:12:13] it's given from the Lord. In other words
[3:12:15] you can do nothing but what has been
[3:12:17] authorized there.
[3:12:19] You're not my boss.
[3:12:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect you, but I know
[3:12:22] everything that is happening. If I get
[3:12:24] fired, it was my day to go.
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; But it's not my day. You ain't going to
[3:12:28] do nothing.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:36] &gt;&gt; They will cut a time. We will get to the
[3:12:38] millennium
[3:12:39] &gt;&gt; and the devil will be bound.
[3:12:41] &gt;&gt; But this is the time the devil is
[3:12:43] unbound.
[3:12:44] &gt;&gt; But he's unbound not to scare you.
[3:12:50] In the midst of chaos, that's when the
[3:12:52] anointing run off
[3:12:53] &gt;&gt; and you will see how the third pull ran
[3:12:55] off with this.
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[3:13:01] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:13:04] grace, for your love and your mercy, and
[3:13:06] for everything you have been doing for
[3:13:08] us. Father, this is as far as we could
[3:13:11] go with, Lord, the ability that you have
[3:13:14] given us. Lord, I pray that this drive
[3:13:17] home and that you help your children,
[3:13:20] you help our children that you have
[3:13:22] given us to stand in the midst of chaos.
[3:13:26] Father, we all wish we can go to heaven.
[3:13:30] We all wish the rapture comes and then
[3:13:32] we can leave this sickly world. We all
[3:13:36] wish that the millennium start right
[3:13:37] now. But there is still a mission to
[3:13:40] fulfill.
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; There is still a purpose of us being
[3:13:43] here. And Lord, the devil has multiplied
[3:13:46] destruction so that we can miss from our
[3:13:49] focus and then we can pay attention to
[3:13:51] him and don't realize what you're doing
[3:13:54] in the midst of this horrible loudisha
[3:13:57] that we're living in. Father, may you
[3:13:59] help us keep our nose above the water
[3:14:02] Lord so that we know Lord Father that
[3:14:04] you are the shepherd. No matter which
[3:14:06] direction we are going, you are still
[3:14:08] there and we are in comfort zone. Not
[3:14:11] because of what we see outside but
[3:14:13] because of the creator of heaven and
[3:14:15] earth that is living in us. Father take
[3:14:17] the oncoming weak unto the hand. Protect
[3:14:20] us under your blood. May you strengthen
[3:14:22] us. I claim the blood upon everything
[3:14:25] that is connected to me Lord. Every
[3:14:27] demonic spirit that will try to attack
[3:14:29] on Monday. Father may blood be put
[3:14:31] everywhere in my work at home in our
[3:14:34] family in this church everywhere. Lord,
[3:14:37] may you stand up Lord. Father, like you
[3:14:39] did for Shadrach, Mach, and Abednego,
[3:14:42] and Nad, may that same pillar of fire
[3:14:44] stand between us and the work of
[3:14:46] darkness. We thank you and commit
[3:14:48] everything unto their hand in the name
[3:14:51] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:14:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. We love you.

[3:15:15] A pilgrim was I and a wondering
[3:15:20] in the cold night of sin I did wrong.
[3:15:25] When Jesus the kind shepherd found me
[3:15:30] and now I am on my way home.
[3:15:35] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[3:15:39] me all the days all the days of my life.
[3:15:45] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[3:15:49] me all the days all the days of my life.
[3:15:55] He restoreth my soul when I'm weary.
[3:16:01] He gives me strength in my day.
[3:16:06] He leads me beside the still waters.
[3:16:11] He guards me except the way.
[3:16:16] Surely good
[3:16:18] shall follow me all the days. All the
[3:16:23] days of my life.
[3:16:26] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[3:16:30] me. All the days, all the days of my
[3:16:34] life.
[3:16:36] When I walk through the dark, lonesome
[3:16:40] valley,
[3:16:42] my savior will walk with me there.
[3:16:47] safety. His great man will lead me
[3:16:52] to the mansions he's gone. Y'all are
[3:16:55] dismissed. Enjoy your afternoon.
[3:16:59] He shall follow me all the days, all the
[3:17:04] days of my life.
[3:17:07] Surely good
[3:17:09] shall follow me all the days, all the
[3:17:14] days of my life.
[3:17:17] And I shall dwell in the house of the
[3:17:20] Lord forever. And I shall be sent my
[3:17:24] table.
[3:17:27] Surely
[3:17:30] shall follow me on
[3:17:35] my life.
[3:17:37] Sh.
[3:17:38] [Music]
[3:17:58] And I shall go in the house of the Lord
[3:18:02] forever. And I shall reset the table for
[3:18:06] me. Surely
[3:18:09] [Music]
[3:18:11] follow me all the day. All the days of
[3:18:16] my life.
[3:18:22] [Music]
[3:18:34] All the names
[3:18:36] of my life.
[3:18:39] And I walk through the dark lonesome
[3:18:42] valley.
[3:18:44] My savior will walk with me there.
[3:18:50] We see his great
[3:18:55] to

[3:19:03] Heat. Heat.
[3:19:04] [Music]
