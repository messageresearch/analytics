our minds with all our soul we vacated everything from our being outside of you and your word Lord we're here to meet with you father as you met with us in the Garden of Eden when you come down the cool of the evening of father and you'd ask us how was your day and we would tell you how nice it was to walk with Leo the Lion and how pretty the flowers were and the sisters may not have liked the arrangement just like that the way it was so they would speak to it and say just move over here and and and grow right here and they would do it they would just do it and then the one flower would be leaning a little bit this way and they say no no no you lean back this way and and it would do it Lord this is a reality we're coming to know by the revelation of the word Who We Are and we're so thankful Lord God that you determined in your mind that we would be with you in the end you're the one that said all the father has given me will come you're the one lord said that you wouldn't lose a one of them father it's not by my it's not by power it's by your spirits saith the Lord father we know that your word is truth and you've come to speak to us in the word of Truth this morning which is spirit and it is life Saint John 6 63 Lords father we so grateful to you Lord God to think that you've lifted us up out of this Murray clay and put us on a rock of Revelation Lord never to be moved again never to be despondent never to be in despair always have a joy and a heart a song on our lips father and it's all because of you father and we're here to cry worthy and we're here to thank you Lord for healing our brother Lord who is long time served you father and now is in need of a healing touch but Lord there's nothing too difficult for you Lord we claim it done in the name of Jesus Christ as your bride and the authority that invested Us by the Kingdom of Heaven father we Proclaim it healed father we believe it Lord that's what believers do as they believe father and Lord for the for for those that are the mourning the loss of loved ones father or every one of us have lost loved ones we know it is what it is to mourn but father as your children we have a promise that you would comfort all that mourn father he was the one that told us to lift up our hands to hang down Lord Jesus and we want to remember Sister Lillian and brother Zach oh my one of the the very first institution that was ever instituted in the Bible was marriage and they're going to experience that today as brother Charles and sister Kayla did yesterday what a beautiful atmosphere oh what a joy Lauren to see Lord God how you've lifted them and placed them into a body Lord Jesus the invisible Union Lord and by this Lord Jesus will all men know that you're my disciples that you have a loved one for another and Lord God the thing that we need healing of more than anything else is our soul and that comes by the hearing of the word father it comes by Revelation and so father we just pray that you'll give us an ear to hear this morning the things that the spirit would speak to our soul lord that we can grow Lord God because we're going to shed these Earthly temples soon anyways but father if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in us then he who quickened that mortal body will Quicken our mortal Body by The Same Spirit that dwells this is a reality Lord and so father we come not to hear a man this morning but we come to hear you we pray that you'll bless him anoint him let him speak what you would have us to hear and let our hungry Hearts pull on the gift of God lord may not one Soul go out of here hungry this morning Father and we do know by the anointed prophet of this age that we who came in cannot leave the same way we came in we'll either go out be closer to you or further away that's where our self-will comes in so little bride just put your bibs on and get ready to soak in this glorious honey that will flow from canaan's Land bless the tithes the offerings those who have and those who have not so they will be able to give Lord Jesus and Lord God may we give from the bottom of my heart because we know our God he wants a cheerful

don't know which direction we will go with the sermon this morning but I will let the Holy Spirit handle the whole thing amen so make sure you stay up I know it's raining outside but this is important and as a pastor we got to do what we got to do amen so stay up we're still under the same channel but stay up and in case in the future you have question always come back to this as a reference so I don't know how much I'm going to deliver so you stay up everything will be okay amen how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hands glory to God it's getting better every day amen I believe you already heard from my brother said about the trustees if anybody uh requested the 70 weeks or the Cod we have them up there the trustee is there you can go ahead talk to him and he will give it to you but if it's for somebody that is not part of this Fellowship in other words your friend or somebody outside before you pick it up and give it to them make sure you talk to the trustees first amen we want to make sure you get it here first before we can help somebody else amen amen glory to God we greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ if there is any visitors we don't call people visitors here we call them family members and not only that we have an elder here he's sitting back there I don't know why he's in the back but he's in the back brother Tim Michelle and his wife are here amen I apologize to be standing here because as an elder you should be here and I should be sitting there so my apology brought it to my show always we want to salute and respect the elders amen glory to God and it's a great honor and privilege for him to be with us this morning to see Elders that are standing for this message it's always encouraging amen glory to God our next house meeting will be on November the 19th a man still in the same place November the 19th so if you have your question you go ahead and put it up there and I believe it's the third team of the adult that is picking up so the first team went well the second team went well and now I'm already under great expectation that the third one will be well because everybody is well trained amen you need help the Deacon out there the elder sister are there we are there so don't be afraid everything is good amen we're doing that for the service of the children of God Amen uh thank you all for the support of yesterday at brother Charles Hamilton and sister Keller's waiting everything went well by the grace of God I'm sorry I have to sleep out a little bit earlier because I got to do there's a lot on my plate amen so everything went good and continue to remember brother John Porter and sister Lily's waiting in Atlanta so that everything goes well as well and we wait for the pictures and videos so when they come back the whole traps are back in orders amen glory to God everything will be good Allelujah let me see if I forgot something I believe we got everything clear here by God's grace did I forget anything brother uh Robert or brother Kelly everything all good praise God brother said your songs were really really really really really inspired it looks like you were sitting with me and going through amen oh my God and I have my I call him my that's my grandson brother Noah he's turned one today foreign so God bless you buddy amen I don't see brother Angelo where is he at okay praise God Amen you know we preach together so I want you to be here on the post of Duty amen I send him a message last night I say you consecrate yourself because we are doing this together amen glory to God and he's getting very very good you need to listen to the sermon he will wake you up [Laughter] glory to God one more thing I know there are people waiting for counseling that I need to talk to there was a question that was uh brought to me about when are we going to have the marriage uh married people uh meeting I already have seven questions so just give me some time we need the orchestrate everything and make sure all is well amen when I say the last Sunday that I can close the door there and close the door here and handle it I'm not talking about whooping people we cannot whoop you you know my heart amen because I've seen a lot in the message I've seen a lot of abuses and if there is something I cannot stand it's when children and women are abused I cannot stand that and usually they put it under the pretense of the message when brother Branham didn't preach it like that amen they will say the woman the woman the woman the woman the by-product and stuff like we corrected many of those stuff brother Branham was not talking about the things the way they were presented and when they are presented wrong people will take that wrong teaching and then begin to either abuse the husband or abuse the wife or abuse the children and I cannot stand that amen so when I say that I need to sit and talk to the married people is to iron certain things and make sure everything is clear and we understand one another better because we under a channel that we are dealing now where God is male and female so you need to know if you're hitting your wife you're just destroying yourself and we don't even believe in Believers hitting their wives amen that's not even to be Christian are you awake if you think that's not the case go ahead and try make sure they don't call me make sure they don't call me amen because I won't take your side regardless of what damage was caused I won't take your side amen any way everything is good thank you brother Kalima for the song and brother delario everything went special so remember I'm gonna go a different direction with this we're still under the same thought stay tight everything is okay if I use this as a reference in the future a man down the road I will put on the church chat group I will load quotes there for every member of this church to have it for reference amen so whenever you're talking to somebody or you're hearing something you don't have to call me or you don't have to go online and search for it you're going to have it so it's going to be your responsibility to take those court and to keep it somewhere and keep it handy because it's very very very important so if you are behind on the counseling we have not met yet or I have not responded to your email yet or to your text yet or to your phone call yet I had a very busy loaded weekend if I tell you what the devil is throwing on my way you will even be surprised for me sending right here amen so those that are international I see email coming up but I cannot open them and deal with them amen because I have certain things so you be patient sometimes I say prayer I say Lord help whoever is struggling because I do not have time to go through an email in detail and most of the time I cannot respond quicker to certain question because we under a divine order amen we don't act like Pentecostal we don't get a weapon and start shooting left and right that's not the ministry of brother Branham amen could line up people Billy Graham could line up people oral Robert they could line the people up and bring them up and just pray and move forward that was not the ministry of brother Branham amen the ministry of brother Branham you need to know what is the very cause is and the Very source of the problem amen if not you will pray for somebody they will feel better in the presence of the anointing but as soon as they leave the anointing the demon come back again amen and that's what we've seen over in the message young people being prayed for therefore being prayed for the fall being prayed for therefore and we keep doing the same thing no if we pray three times it's not working we need to sit down can you give me more microphone so I don't worry about who says a man give me more volume amen amen so we don't have to wait for who's doing what uh who's doing whatever amen so the ministry of brother Branham you need to find the cause of the disease just like you go a good doctor just doesn't see you and gives you a prescription and hand it to you you go back sometimes it won't work we need to do the diagnosis to find out what is causing this repression what is causing this problem and most of the time when You Dig Down Deeper it is not what you see it is something way down sometimes that happen in the childhood that you have to pick it up from there and once you serve it everything else is gone the way the intelligence goes to war now they send a drone and the John is working so when you ask me question and I don't answer you quickly I have just dispatched the spiritual drone they are still retrieving information for me and once I get the information pretty good I have the target zeroed in and nowhere to shoot when I shoot one time I'm shooting to kill [Applause] you everybody okay so far do you remember how long Paul was having a woman talking following them why didn't Paul turn around and say I rebuked you Paul left that woman keep following them and keep talking and keep talking the woman did not know that the spiritual drone were already dispatched they were studying the disease they were studying the condition when they had called they got everything zeroed in they pushed the button they say Paul go ahead and shoot it amen when he gathered that was it and do you know what kind of spirit was it he was a big snake he was a person but what the python was speaking was true he was saying these are the servant of the Living God that was right but it was a demonic spirit So speaking good things doesn't make doesn't tell us it's coming from God [Applause] amen amen I get among minister they ask me questions and I know what they're trying to say because the Drone is already getting them [Music] one look at me he said were you in Commons church and I know where he was coming from I say brother I never seen the brother I've never been in his church I only heard about him he thought I was under the Thunder movement he didn't know that John got it and it's a Minister doing that and I know what they're talking I'm just waiting for the signal when I was shooting let's go to Joshua chapter 4. no you might be seated still I'm sorry this is not what we're reading this is something different so I don't know which direction I'm going amen amen Joshua chapter four if you're there you can say Amen verse 5. we dealt with it before we talk about the seal evidence and the open evidence and I'm begging you stay up okay we cannot continue to repeat over and over okay amen verse 4. you know this is pretty good then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared you know that of the children of Israel Joshua chapter 4. out of every tribe and Joshua said to them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan everybody remember this and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribe of the children of Israel that this may be a water yes my brother you can start now that this can be as water sign a son among you when they say a son it means a memorial amen they want this to be a son or a memorial a memorial for what a sound for what amen verse 6 that this may be a son among you so when you go to Israel the head signs everybody okay nobody have seen the stone of the Jordan before right they probably heard stories that they are down deep this River we got stoned but nobody's seen it so for some reason God separated and opened the water of the Jordan when God did it they went to pick up the stone and they brought something that was hidden are you following me are you following me something that was hidden before was brought up to the surface so that the naked eye can see it at the beginning you can look through Jordan but you won't see anything everybody here so the evidence that was sealed oh the invisible evidence of Jordan was picking up and put outside as a son and a memorial [Music] so if you never seen Jordan in the Deep you don't have to go down there there is a dividend that you can look up and say this came from Jordan everybody okay glory to God verse 6 that this may be a son among you that when your children ask their fathers in terms to water in other words the generation that I have seen that will die amen but we want to live in evidence so that they all come in New Generation even though they were not there when the things happened they can look at something and know that this is a reference to what our father spoke to us amen use this sermon today as your reference for this church everybody okay the Bible continue he says saying what mean you by water still stones so the stone will be there so one of these things the children will come and say Daddy what is this so there is a story behind the story everybody okay verse 7 then you shall answer them that the waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when he passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and this Stone shall be for a water Memorial a memorial that the children of Israel forever to the children of Israel forever and the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up to of stone out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord spoke to Joshua according to the number of the tribe of the children of Israel and carry them over with them to the place where the lodge and lay them down there and Joshua set up 12 stone in the midst of Jordan you know what this means in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the Ark of the Covenant stood they are there to this day in other words when something happened amen amen God gave him a memorial and that Memorial will not was not for that generation only he was for that generation and the generation to come why are you saying all of this somebody gave me two pictures for this church as a gift and those picture has been here in my office for a long time and we never put them up the person even reminded me quite some time and sometimes I don't do things just like that I have to wait for the signal from the boss to tell me what to move because these are the children of God amen I don't want a person directing me I want God in that person directing me in other words not you but God in you speaking to me and I know how to recognize God in you amen amen so when brother Andrew Glover preached here he mentioned about those pictures [Music] and when he mentioned personally I got my signal from the boss that it was time amen for me to take those pictures [Applause] [Music] we got a new generation that have come up do you know why we have those pictures foreign [Applause] churches before do you know why we put them up if you don't know why we put them up it's gonna be easy for you to remove them [Applause] if you never understood the reason why we keep those pictures you're gonna be quick and you will agree with the people that are removing them why do we put those pictures why do we have this picture here there are many pictures of Jesus Christ why do we keep this one give me my time and whoever is not in this church today I am asking you to come back when you come back listen to what I'm gonna say and whoever is online this is where I'm standing everybody okay let me start with the first picture what do you see there I want to hear you hello there what do you see in that picture [Music] the water in that picture we have the pillar of Fire everybody okay beside the pillar of fire I know when I say what do you see somebody's running from something [Applause] everybody okay don't don't answer me to be smart answer me from the bottom of your heart in other words if you see brother Branham say I see brother Brown if you see the pillar of fire you say I see the people tell me what do you see there fine what else do you see there who do you see again we see brother Brown if I have to stop here on Sunday and let you go home that's fine everybody okay we see the pillar of fire and we see also brother Branham my second question is this before we go everybody agree with this if you agree raise your hand thank you you can put your hand down now in this picture we see the pillar of fire which is right here and we also see brother Branham the second question I have who does this picture belong to it belongs to you I understand when you look at this picture we hear Brother Branham we have also the pillar of Fire that this picture was said the picture of brother Branham always said the picture of the pillar of Fire To whom it belongs this picture belongs to who you say the pillar of Fire okay glory to God I want you to be relaxed add to life you don't know so I'm gonna help you I know you know but now act like you don't know I'm not telling you to pretense because I'm trying to run you away from what you know before so you can get what I'm trying to say everybody okay brother polycarp Junior I had you in mind come on stand right there my brother brother Charles you got your phone who got the phone here brother you got your phone okay take me a picture you're finished that picture belongs to who it's my picture right that's my picture right take me another picture stop before you take a picture come on brother stand right here take me a picture you finish this picture belonged to who did he ask the picture the picture belonged to her did you get what I'm saying even though he's here it is not his picture [Applause] thank you my brother everybody okay the picture still belong to me he appeared to be beside me everybody here when they were taking my picture [Applause] brother Branham he said the Great American photographer Associated after many newspaper that took it coded in their what camera then one night at Houston comma Texas God permitted his water picture of his water the picture belonged to her everybody okay [Applause] if I lost you raise your hand brother come back up stop running when I asked brother please when I asked brother Angelo I am the one wanting to take my picture brother Angelo took my picture everybody okay and that picture belongs to me if I ask you what do you say to me everybody okay now I call brother polycarp he came I said but Angelo take my picture but in that picture I have associated brother polycarp to my picture but it is not his picture I am the owner of the picture [Applause] you need to ask me why did I call him in the picture then I will tell you he's my friend when you look at my album you will see me on the first picture when you look at the second picture you will see me again then you need to turn back to me and say brother Stephen who is this boy then I will tell you this boy is my friend but it was not the picture of the boy it is my own picture everybody okay you might be seated are you still lost amen so brother Branham say that that picture is the picture of God me up yes sir the picture is the picture of God it is the picture of his son amen so when they ask you why do you keep this picture on your church what is the purpose of of us cherishing this picture because brother Branham has a ladder picture we don't put them in our church there is a lot of picture in brother Branham album go ask his family they have another picture but we don't need this picture we only need this one why do we need that picture it is not the picture of brother Branham [Applause] are you following me because brother Branham himself says that it's the picture of his son what is brother Brian I'm doing in the picture of his son he said that one one night at Houston Texas God permitted his picture of his water son in the same form Saint Paul sent him to be water photographed and God George G Lacey of the FBI fingerprint and document to come from California to Houston Texas to put it into the shell building into the map God you're somebody who was criticizing brother Branham firmly [Music] in other words you who hate brother Branham come right here and look at this picture so in other words when a Critic look at you they look at you to find a fault so that they can disqualify you everybody okay glory to God he said and shook my hand and say water brother the light did water he was water yeah he said the mechanical eye of this camera won't take water then light was water in other words that really confirm that the light was water he didn't confirm brother Branham was there the problem was not brother partner the problem was the light on the picture do you follow me do you follow me the man already knew brother Branham the problem was not to to vindicate brother Branham it is to vindicate the owner of the picture [Applause] if you knew in the message pay attention everybody okay brother Branham say our heavenly father we thank you for your mercy oh God May the people just with us they are in the same order angel that led them in the water natural is leading us water in the water here is the water even the scientific word has done water took his picture it is with whom us everybody okay why does brother Branham appear there if it's not his picture why because message Believers are ashamed of this picture [Applause] and understand sometimes it's ignorance because you were taught wrong you didn't know what was the picture all about this picture is not about brother Branham it is a bad invisible God that is made visible [Applause] glory to God why do we have brother Brown I'm dead brother Branham he said Mr air Mr kipperman the night that the camera proved that he was not telling anything that was wrong it was water the truth and when the mechanical eye of the camera cut the vision not the vision the water reality the water Christ that we preach and so love was with us he promised to be with us and the camera did what took his picture a picture of who Christ do you see brother but I'm saying it's his picture no many times I have stayed in the past that has seen that light all the time but sometimes people will be a little water skeptic which you could believe they could be that way but that night since then it's been taken how many times several times in Germany just recently coming down when the anointing was and when he went back again and those things those pictures are not water magnifiers some water human being so if somebody pick up this picture here and begin to defy brother Branham that is his problem [Applause] the picture was not to magnify a man is a wrong approach it doesn't make the picture wrong or face must come but wow to him the offense come from [Applause] glory to God glory to God brother Branham if it's not to magnify some human being what is the purpose of this picture but it is water indicate the presence of who Jesus Christ among his water people so when they ask you why do you put this picture it is a vindication at the Jehovah of the Old Testament that God that led Moses the one that was with Saint Paul he is with us here and he is here this morning [Applause] why do we have that picture up there why a minister is shame of it let me ask you a question that picture now belongs to her and when you take that picture from the church you taking the picture of who God when you are rejecting the picture you are rejecting who God [Applause] what I'm giving you is John when you see a minister in this message begin to play with this picture amen you need to wake up [Music] [Applause] everybody here everybody here everybody here if you look at chapter 19 Paul met this light he met the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire talked to him and after that experience God called a man by the name of ananias he said ananias go to Paul listen to me carefully he said then ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he had water done to that Center Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the chief priest to bond all that coal underwater name God corrected amanias and he gave ananias the reason why him and Paul must meet together you know not only God and Paul meeting but God in the form of the pillar of fire meeting simple what was the purpose he said but the Lord said unto him God our way for he is the water chosen vessel so the pillar of fire came to identify the chosen vessel [Music] faster hallelujah amen I hope you're getting what I'm saying for he is the water chosen vessel and to water means to Bear water my name so when party's going who's going God [Applause] am I reading a different Bible no everybody okay before who the Gentiles and before who King and before who the children say I have had the privilege of praying for water Kings and for water and for water why because he met the same Pillar of Fire [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay why does brother Branham have to appear there God wants to not only vindicate his presence but to vindicate to you for this generation who God is working with [Music] when they receive you they receive [Music]

that is water near when he watered does he [Music] [Applause] the angel was not the son of man but he was the messenger from the water son of man the son of man is who Christ he is the one that you are feeding on you are not feeding on a man a man his word will tell but you are sitting on the water the unfailing son of man everybody okay why do we put that picture there why do we have that picture there it is not a picture of brother Branham brother Branham have so many pictures if we get them all we're gonna plaster this wall but we were looking for one picture this picture is in Washington DC confirmed by the United States it's Washington DC can keep this picture why are you ashamed of it foreign I hope at this point you can read how between us and know what we mean that in this day God has water he found everything to declare himself that he is alive he has read from the dead and he's in his great Celestial water body the picture here of his water he would defy every water infidelity in the water world is a love forevermore God does fit in his own way and how he does that unusual when your children will ask you what does he mean by this sign what does he mean by this Memorial we were not there but God left a memorial so you will remember that what we talk about is not a myth it is a reality that was proven and it's kept in the museum in Washington to tell you that Jesus Christ is the same today forever and he is with this message amen thank you [Applause] there are certain things I won't tolerate on this pulpit let me keep moving everybody okay let's go to the second picture [Applause] can you see that from there hello make sure all of you seen why do we have that picture why this picture belonged to who God if you take this picture away you taking the picture of who out God if you rejecting this picture you are rejecting who if you are ashamed of this picture you are ashamed of what God you are ashamed of God and his program for the hour what's up if you're moving to the bathroom or to the ladies room make sure you come back I want to make sure you got this [Applause] you get it everybody okay what do you see there a cloud very good we see a cloud who made this Cloud don't answer me some people say it's a rocket I defy you go because Russia have many Rockets God discover God cooperate with Russia and continue to shoot rocket from the moment till the afternoon and give me one racket that will look like that one [Applause] up to today nobody has shown a rocket picture that look like that one [Applause] why do we have it in this church I'm not responsible for other trades I'm responsible for here why do we have it here if I have to stop here and go home I'm fine [Applause] [Music] in second Thessalonians chapter one the Bible say and to you who are water trouble you message believer that are trouble by crazy internet website all right it is amazing how people get trouble they don't even use their thinking anymore [Music] because they already were looking for a way out of the message everybody okay he said to you who are water trouble do what rest with us Lord Jesus shall be water revealed from water Heaven stop he didn't say the Lord Jesus will be coming from heaven everybody okay this is not the coming of the Lord are you with me yes this is the revealing they're revealing of God in what in heaven but who's gonna reveal him from heaven everybody okay he said when the Lord who Jesus so if that revealing is done in heaven when you look at that you must see Jesus [Applause] do you follow me if you don't see Jesus there it is not his revealing are you following me so they're he feeling is the revealing of Jesus where in heaven but who's going to make that picture who will give us that picture this message brother Branham say uh the Bible said when the Lord Jesus shall be watered from water heaven with his water so the mighty angels of God will reveal Jesus Christ in the heaven the revealing in Heaven by Angel s are singular or plural plural so we must have more than one angel everybody okay in water flaming fire so it gotta be a light everybody here so they're revealing in heaven must be done by a light I have a quote I didn't put it up see me after church he said in flaming fire taking water Vengeance if he's a lamb he is merciful if he's a lion he's coming as a church so that revealing must bring the judge outside [Applause] this message in the Bible I'm giving you this so you have your foundation in the Bible everybody okay he's coming as a judge to bring venges he's a lion that's why in Revelation 10 he can roll like a what and he said take advantage on them that know not God and that obeyed not to his water Gospel of gospel of who Lord Jesus so according to Second Thessalonians Paul prophesy everybody okay Paul prophesied about the coming of Jesus Christ but here Paul is prophesying not of the coming but after revealing of Jesus Christ by Mighty angel in heaven and he's going to bring him as a church what are you trying to say who will your mind brother in which year I could see those Water Angels you know when we if I write a book even this Bible you can play around with it you can change it yeah amen but when something is on video or on tape you cannot end insert something on tip and manipulate it it is an absolute reverse reference brother Branham said those shaped back Wings traveling faster than than sand could travel they come from where eternity in a split like a water twinkling of an eye I won't touch those 62 because he could tell you something in the three kingdom of an eye so it's a speed that is connected to the rapture [Applause] everybody okay so whatever come here have the power of the rapture everybody okay he says not enough to bat your eye just tweak they were there I didn't have time to do what I didn't have time no more than just water look mighty water ice great power for Water Angels hello revealed Jesus Christ in heaven who angels in 19 Waters 62. did this picture was he taken in 1962 he was taken in 19 Waters everybody okay he said Snow White looks like what snow and water what do you see there what do you see there what do you see over there it looked like water he says Snow White said and they were and when he did I was water into this water hear me of water consolation look then the Capstone was not water it's so pretty get West and come back or it is is it this it is this what seven angels in the consolation that come to me how many Angels were there seven Why seven seven is the number of water why does the angel why do the angel have to come seven why not two one or three one or five Grace why only seven listen to me everybody okay in Revelation 1 verse 20 the Bible said the mystery of the Water Seven Stars which that soweth in my water right hand and the Seven water golden candle the Seven Stars are white angels our water seven are the Angels of the water seven churches so the Seven Star means how many angels seven angels and how many Angel brother Brian I'm saying seven I'm out of it let me continue Revelation 3 verse 1 the Bible said and unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things say he that has how many seven spirits of God and the Water Seven Stars now John take the seventh Spirit and the seventh star and connect both of them together we have Seven and Seven Stars which are seven angels which John connected to water what does it mean seven spirit Oh Glory to God brother Branham said seven spirit the servant Spirit and the Water Seven Stars that Spirit towards the water angels that went to the Water Stars which were water Messengers so when power was working that's why Paul said the angel of the Lord who must serve talk to me it was one of them who have to work with her all along but because we are in the last stage in the seven churches you don't only get one [Music] [Applause] Generico they turn around the city faster second time third time fourth but on the seventh day they have to turn the city how many times seven times thank you I hope you're paying attention because I don't want to come back to this again Amen brother Branham says that seven times seven different times the water will anoint the water a messenger which was a star in his water today a spirit is water Eternal and the star that was made for a purpose to reflect the light in the water the dark of this church ages where candles and star out and star are representing the angel that Spirit was the one that went to the star and reflect the light of the water Holy Spirit through the star through that Water Church in that the word God told me have seven spirit everybody okay when you say God is a set of seven spirit everybody here everybody okay so through every Church ages God use one of the spirit as an angel and the angel Heavenly will leave heaven do you follow me and come to the angel on Earth and give him the message of that day everybody okay when he finished God sent the second one and the third one and the fourth one until the what seven one glory to God he says that he says the star reflected that age that wonder who the seventh Spirit are it is the seven messenger of the seven Water Church and each time that the star come in on the same the Holy Spirit come down and anoint that star and keep it just exactly like water in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 the Bible said out of the throne proceeding lightning and thundering and voices there were seven lamps of fire doing water burning before who the throne which are the water seven spirits of God so if you have a problem for me saying God have seven Spirit you got the scripture Revelation 5 Verse 6 I beheld in law in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the Beast of the Elder stood the water lamb as he has been watered it's a bleeding lamb you following me comma heavy water seven horns and what seven eyes which are the water seven spirits so the lamb himself is not one spirit for you to have the complete lamb you must have the seventh Spirit which are the seven angels so when the seven Angel comes [Music] to reveal Jesus Christ in the heaven huh everybody okay Paul said the revealing of Jesus Christ in the heaven they have to reveal the entire crust I say I say the light of the moon shall be as the light of the water Sun the Moon is the church the Sun is Christ and the light of the Sun shall be housed Sevenfold so there will be a message everybody okay there will be a sun that will have seven times the light for seven days why brother Branham brother Branham say this I saw the seven Angel come didn't work why only in Life Magazine why not to death magazine everybody Okay magazine package as a fog and he floated across 27 miles high and 30 miles across is not Fred softman these are the genome and them sitting back there stood right there want them Water Seven Angels appear right there on the water and indeed water shook the hills so Mars around like that there stood how many angels and they did what throw a sword in your they took a sword and gave it to brother Branham you never heard this before [Music] I know you never heard it when the seven angel came and they pick up brother Branham they pull a sword and gave it to brother brother follow me carefully what to do with a sword you remember the third book when the sword hit his head everybody okay brother Branham said and they told him the water go home and open the water we're giving so the seventh danger came with the revelation of the Seven Seals and here they are the true Water mystery of marriage and divorce and the water servancy and all of these things that has been water yes [Music] the Lord [Applause] sometimes people do that for ignorance but I will never tolerate after what we went through I took a decision in my life never to tolerate and he came with this message relax pay attention please these angels came with the revelation of the Water Seven Seals you hear Minister attacking Seven Seals we don't need the seals you don't need to do with this heels what are the Seals what are the Seals what are the Seals listen to me please check somebody beside you wake him up Minecraft [Applause] I was under a pastor that I never thought to leave this message and it was hard for me to make a decision because I knew the man until I realized that the man left the message but that tolerance will never happen in this church I will not tolerate that in this church every minister in this church and the oncoming new Minister I will not tolerate any game with this message any visiting minister in the future I won't tolerate any game with this message [Applause] listen to me carefully listen to me carefully [Applause] we're talking about the Seven Seals if you never heard are you awake if you never heard if you ever believe I ever done water anything in the sermon that is what inspired you you take them deep on the Water Seven Seals brother Branham say if there is anything that he can point to that is inspired it is the seventh year if you are attacking the seals by ignorance learn from today but in this church we don't play with this Hills if you have a problem you can find another Pastor I will not change he said I am not a tip sermon Mr softman here self tape him and Mr who Meg but I don't sell tips they take them if you have

seventh here he said there were the angel of the Lord made us and the Bible became a what new book with that the seventh seal this Bible is a Pentecostal message yourself [Applause] without the opening of the seventh seal we are not different than Baptists [Applause] Amen brother Branham see what the problem say Delight have to come from the messenger then it goes to others who are Faithfully talk listen the people in this message they preacher in this message need to sit down and study foreign [Applause] always sending me messages I can tell this is not a man floating it's a man who studied you are attacking things you don't know you are belittling things you don't understand and you want to fight yourself rejecting the message that you claim to preach [Applause] I'm Gonna Give You Grace if you did it for ignorance but from today glory to God he says then he opened up and we feel water all the things not the water and the fix has water left out that's why seven angels have to come because Paul preaching partner he left up certain things that's why the last message have to bring all the angel together so they can give brother Branham everything that they miss

to us we put it on tips and in book form everybody okay let me now tell you this what you have on tips and on books form is only the word of Christ everybody okay because brother Branham says that if I preach these seals the way he talked to me one seal I will preach in three months everybody okay one seal how many months three months but brother brother preached one seal in an hour or an hour 30 minutes so do we have the whole thing no what do we have to do to know the whole thing brother Angelo tell brother Charles I'm thinking about him do you know what I'm thinking about you you need to come and talk to me what's up do you follow me so a mystery even though it is revealed to brother Charles there's still a supernatural element be despite the revelation [Applause] brother Charles need

you know what I mean right you heard the message do you know what I really mean no because you don't have a contact with me everybody okay you can read the seals and the devil can read the seal and you don't understand anything Jesus because if you get what brother Charles got you will know my top and God doesn't want anybody to know his thought except his own predestinated children everybody okay everybody okay so the seals are not the books the seals are not the tips the seals is a person foreign [Applause] [Applause] how many people read this Bible do they understand no why because brother Branham say you might know this book but another author because the answer in his Booker water he can really tell you what he meant by what he said [Applause] [Music] who are the Seals you back again my brother you there the slide go to 399. drop to 399. 98 99 go to 400. Hallelujah don't worry about it yeah go to 401 oh let me go go with it myself if I can let me see if though this will pick up it's not picking up don't worry he'll be okay just unplug the USB and plug it back in plug it in plug back here let's see praise God I know he's mad he will Free People internationally get this off and go ahead and plug that back in oh God thank you Jesus okay let's see let's see let's give the Lord a clap of him [Applause] amen glory to God we already went through this we already went through this we already going through this we already went through this we already went through this we are here brother Branham said he is those seals for the whole word of God is what Christ and Christ is what there was water open so when you talking bad about the 70. you talking bad about who Jesus Christ do you see what Minister are doing when you say we don't need those seven seal what are you talking about he said what is the opening of the seal that revealing who Christ remember Jesus Christ we will be revealed in the heaven by Mary angels [Applause] brother Branham say brother Branham say the wise shall know but the water foolish foolish the water and why the unwise version would what wouldn't know they shall know their God now now how he shall appear not coming not coming not coming how he shall water appear in the water is to bring the people backwards so that the bride will know her what her husband know her water May well mate is the water revealed word what's up did I lost anyone brother Stephen if you done that picture like this and look you can probably set from the audience it is Hope Christ why because the Revelation in the Heaven Must show us crossed when the angel come and they do the picture they do the thing online or or on the sky when you look at that thing you must see Christ because Jesus Christ must be revealed in the heaven by Mary Angel so when Mighty Angel grouped together you must see who brother Branham said see his eyes looking here just as perfectly as he could be wearing the water wide way because he's coming for judgment for water Supreme deity a judge Heaven and Earth you can see his what eyes his water no he's what mouth he is the Supreme water judge there is none by water him that is a perfect can you read it again that is a perfect what identification again and the water Vindication that this message is what the truth this is the water truth it is what so this picture is a Vindication that the message your brother Branham is true amen [Applause] what go ask the people that are leaving the message what trouble them it's always this picture amen amen it is a new revelation it is on tape in 1963. they took a uh in 1962 and then on 63 they took the picture and the people still have a problem with that why do we put that picture there because it's a Vindication that this message is true and if you done that who do you see all right when you look over there who do you see Christ amen that's right you okay you okay why do we put this picture here why do we put that picture there but we have another one here [Music] I would change maybe the title everybody okay why do we have this then this picture is in 1962 this picture was well well before that it is a picture that was done by an artist called Huffman this picture here vanity catch this picture but before I got there brother Branham say it is just like this comparing the waters Seven Seals when God used Martin Luther for the coming out of the first church or that church and when he used John Wesley and he gradually brought them out and was revealing in them that churches everybody okay but in this water the reason that that was such a tremendous thing everybody okay that he spoke it of it he spoke of it here and showed us what seven Thunders and in which magazine look and what life water magazine so this picture brother Branham called that the seven pandas he said they took the picture of the seven Thunders [Music] because the seven Thunder where the Revelation contained in the water so when you are joking with the seven Thunders when you are joking with the seals we don't need those standards we don't need those seals you are rejecting the very message that you think you are preaching everybody okay everybody okay because this picture here is a Vindication of this picture this picture was way before brother maybe before brother Prana was born that picture existed amen so why did we have this picture in the message churches [Music] picture was made by men it can be good or it can be wrong picture was not drawn by a man this were brought on by angels how can they nature picture where you dear matches this picture here try with your rocket [Music] brother Branham there is not an artist in the world that could take that in the world could paint his picture the character of his water face the best which year is this 55. this is on tip nobody can play with the tapes he said the best I have seen is the water 1955 brother Branham saw Jesus Christ in a vision when brother brought them look at Jesus in the vision brother Branham came out from division he began to look how to describe Jesus Christ they brought him pictures of Jesus Christ that were thrown from this man from this man from this man from this man when brother Branham look at the picture he said the one that look like the Jesus I saw in the vision is this one in 1955 brother Branham I got it on all what and everything I do what when brother Branham saw this picture he took this picture he began to print it and put it in his Bible in a home and everything what about why do you need this picture he's often a Christian that's not my problem I'm looking at what is going on because God can give a vision to pharaoh God can give a vision to Nebuchadnezzar can give a vision to Balaam that's not my problem father Branham kept this picture why brother Branham say that is because that looks just like water so I'll pray the water as close as is good water in 19 water 55 now when the seals were open they took this picture that you saw them Amen brother Branham now comes back in 63. you can make the math he said I never did care for water salesman's picture sauce man had a picture of Jesus Christ brother random look he said not this one which one this one why do you love this one because that's the Jesus I saw do you have a proof we don't have a proof brother Branham never took a picture in the vision you have the vision for himself now God moved the vision from the prophet so that the entire world will understand that what brother Branham saw what he speak what he spoke is exactly the truth brother Branham say I like water Horseman's picture can you give him more volume he said I like Huffman picture they had the title 33. why 33 why water at 33 you know and I have got a big water picture of it because when I seen him in the vision that time that is just the way he watered looked there he was a gathered fixed so he will be looking well right at me when I was water praying in water this picture brother took even he made sure when Jesus is looking he looked the way he prays all right why brother problem he said he is weak before he ever happened I say that this is in 65 and that day when that happened it went up and then you turned that picture sideways if you got to if you get Luke magazine or what Life Magazine you look and you leave start sideway there he is just what perfectly like water Houseman head of Christ looking water right there why he was standing there looking water right back roof exactly the Revelation was what correct this picture Vindicated the picture of husband how can you remove this picture how can you remove this picture and you are keeping this picture in the church who taught you about this picture where did you learn about this picture you learned it from Brother Prana how can you keep this one and you are removing that one [Applause] why do we put this picture why do we put this picture why do we put this picture everybody okay everybody okay let's Rush quickly I have 15 minutes and I stop stand with me in the scripture it's the groom's oil and the great mystery it is 43. you okay or you want to go home let me strike this and we go home everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay yes sir we are still on the trashing floor with roof and then from the threshing floor we are dealing with the second oil now in our reading when you look in the Book of Ruth we are with roof down into the holiest and Boaz when he met Ruth he said the Lord recompense that work and the full reward not a partial a complete seven are you following me a seven reward a complete reward a complete reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel what are the wings of God [Music] I'm gonna strike one portion that is connected to what I spoke so we can stop right there everybody okay everybody okay he says in some verse uh chapter 61 David say I will abide in that water for whatever what is the Tabernacle of God he said I will water trust remember have to do what trust in the water wings and David say that I will abide not get in and come out the Tabernacle but when I get in the Tabernacle I will stay there everybody okay and when I abide I will abide there forever why I will trust in the water cover of the water so the wings of God is the Tabernacle of God amen amen everybody okay so when Boaz was telling roof that you have come and you have trusted in the wings of God he was telling him that you are entering the Tabernacle that's why when we are going with roof we found out that the walk the step of roof are exactly the step of the Tabernacle everybody okay because roof entering the wings of Jehovah she was entering the Tabernacle but she got to go to roof deciding roof working roof all the way to roof resting Where We Are everybody okay now roof was working not alone roof was the last woman to be hired by boys are you following me if you tired I stop here and we can pick up when you're fresh already have some other women some other made it those Maiden were already working in the field glory to God where am I at Lord help me I'm trying to skip okay boys already have some mate some made it they were already working on the field they were already under salary the last one go as hired because roof was working under the Commandment of God that if you're a widow you can go through uh through the field and get whatever you want when boas met roof he said no no no no no I don't want you to go everywhere I want you to stay on this field but at that don't want you to be coming here on the widowhood and now everybody okay I don't want you to come here and still behave under the scripture of a widow amen I want you now to consider yourself as a maid you are now an employee everybody okay so the last woman that was hired amen the last woman that was hired among the maidens was roof so now the group of women of Boas have the maidens plus roof all of them were female or they were women everybody okay keep this pretty good so under the field of boas which was under the Reapers because we know the whippers are the Angels under the messenger amen the work that was done was the working of women in other words it was female spirit that were working everybody okay when we move from there get from the field of Boaz for following me into the threshing floor foreign do you follow me do you follow me that what changed there he was no longer the female working he was boss of the male of the man's spirit was working everybody okay so we are moving from the field of Boaz into the trashing floor but when they moved from the field into the trashing floor all the maidens were disqualified right are you okay they work for boas but none of them became the wife of Boaz the only one that moved with the further part with the new unfolding with the change of the ministry from the field into the threshing floor was only wolf [Music] do you follow me Every Other Woman stay in the field Ruth was the only one that moved from the field into the trashing floor everybody okay and the trashing floor is where they are removing the shark from the seed amen so the shark will be removed the maiden which help roof I don't know if you're getting me born when you get in my field I want you to follow the the the maiden yes and whatever the maiden are going you follow them so roof leave a portion of her life following and being helped by the Madam and the reaper of Boaz but they came a time where he was no longer the Reapers he was no longer the maiden every Maiden pullback he was only roof herself in other words the shark that was protecting that was helping that was nurturing that was instructing roof have to pull back [Music] [Applause] and when they pulled back he was no longer roof working but he was not boas doing the work of redemption [Applause] I don't know if you're kidding me praise God let's go back here glory to God in our subject here when we're dealing with the second oil thank you Jesus in Matthew 25 we know that all the maidens all the Virgin moved and there were all ten of him and they were going into the journey to meet the blood group follow me carefully in here we got two Journeys everybody okay the first journey started from the beginning all the way to a place where every virgin slumbered and slept everybody okay they all slumbered and they slept until the midnight everybody okay the second Journey started after midnight amen and that Journey went from Midnight to meeting the groomer everybody okay what are you trying to say by that the journey that began here began at night because the Bible says in Matthew 25 verse 1 that then they shall the Kingdom of Heaven be thy come to how many virgins which took the water why do you need a lamp for in the day what do you need the lamp in a day so the journey started the water before the midnight up in Roman 13. I'm gonna hit the hyper life we stop you go chew on it if you're there you can say Amen pages are still turning everybody okay glory to God Romans 13 verse 11 if you dare you can say Amen but Angel is there yes sir okay praise God he said and that knowing the time that now it is high time to do work is he there okay it's a hard time to do what it's in Roman 13 verse 11 my brother it's a high term to a work when somebody needs to awake what are they doing okay it is hard time to awake out of water you must say brother Stephen they could have been sleeping in the day let's see what time they're sleeping for now is our Salvation near than we believe the water now is water for Spain when Paul started preaching it was already night am I reading a different Bible That's why throughout the seven Church ages God have to use the star the star means that their son is no longer there so you need to use the light of the sun oh the light of the star to illuminate the night why do you use Seven Stars it's telling you that the sun is no longer we are in night time that's why Paul in his time as the first messenger Paul said that the night is already fast when Paul started he was the night when the Virgin started they started the night everybody okay yes sir let's continue he said the night is first pet the day is a water Paul thought the Rapture is going to happen in his day everybody okay let us therefore do what cast off the work of darkness and let us put on the water the armor of water why the armor of light because it's dark everybody okay so the Virgin that started this journey started the journey before midnight everybody okay and the first journey went from there before midnight all the way to midnight but by midnight all the virgins were already slumbering and the journey the first portion of the journey you following me this Fortune was illuminated by the first oil I'm gonna go slowly give me a little bit of time if I can strike what I need to strike because it's connected to what you just spoke big night the first one was no longer working if you lost to raise your hand Knight day the second oil kicking everybody okay so on the first journey every virgin qualified yeah everybody okay get no oil wash the oil that determine who will be married and who's not gonna be married everybody okay because the second oil could determine who was wise and who was not twice in other words the second word is the all of marriage and divorce [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] let's go slowly my friend according to the Bible according to the Bible when a woman is engaged she is considered to be married that's why they told Joseph that refused not to take Mary the water because they were already married when you give the vow you are hooked you already married even though you are not intimate yet in the physical everybody okay so these women the 10th version all of them were married by being espoused to the groom [Music] everybody okay but the one that entered into the true marriage where only those that have the second one so the second one brought marriage and he also brought divorce where is marriage Matthew 25 verse 10 and while they want to buy the bridegroom did water my brother is up there the bridegroom came and days that were water ready went in with him into water marriage those that were already were those that had the second oil so the secondary bought water marriage but he also bring water divorce open Matthew 25 if you did you can say Amen Matthew 25 verse 11. go to verse 11. you there my brother you there back there afterward came also add the water virgins watch which version are they the foolish virgin let me go back to 10 so you can answer me correctly and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to water marriage and the door was what sure who enter into the marriage what kind of Virgin why is because they have what kind of oil the second oil praise God verse 11 after old came also add the water virgins who are who are those virgins foolish virgin foolish the foolish virgin and when they came they say what Lord Lord open to us verse 12 but he answered and said verily I say unto you I water no you not wow the decision that the foolish virgin took their attitude of the foolish virgin toward the second oil divorced them from Jesus Christ [Applause] go back to verse 3. go back to verse three I know what I'm saying is serious but you have not caught it yet you're going to see what I'm trying to say go to verse 3. amen go to verse two and five of them were what and five were water foolish you ready verse three and they that were water foolish took the lamp and took water no oil they thought it was not necessary to pick up the second one they thought we don't need the additional everybody okay they're on that they're rejected divorce them from Jesus Christ [Music] in other words in other words the second oil shows if you want to go with God all the way or not do you follow me if you pick up the second oil you are telling Jesus Christ all the way I'm going all the way everybody okay if you reject that oil you are telling Jesus Christ I can only come with you only up to this point what is the second order that we're talking about Lord help me brother Branham saying he can put her away but she cannot water put him away he did it and has prophet in the days when who Luther and who Wesley and who Pentecost when they refused to become the water further they didn't want to move with the second journey of him by having water spirituals water sexual effects because sexualities when you get in the physical and the one that bring you in the physical which the husband is the second oil the first oil only tell you your fiance but for you to enter into the broad chamber and he shut the door he takes the second order we cannot have a blood that come to the Altar and she accept and before going home she said I don't want it anymore you disqualified right there let me continue he said they refuse to become the further part of Water by having water spiritual sexual Affairs to become water pregnated with the water further part of it do not the former part of the world not that no not not the word of before there is a new word there is a Reformation of Jesus Christ that is completely new refusing that revelation [Applause] you are marking yourself for divorce [Applause] I hope you're getting what I'm saying he says she refused the water Lutheran Church did what refuse for Christ to have water any more Desire with her refused and let me say this going to call me something anywhere so is today what very they failed to take what the word they refused who Christ and Christ was what you can you say it loud now and whoever refused this seal is refusing who Christ watch your mouth watch your mouth what you talking about the seals if you're in this church going around gossiping you need to see me and repent everybody okay brother Branham say and so is it with the church that refused to become water impregnated in the water age that we live in now to bring soft water children of water they say not the children of power are you awake he said no we are not water we are not water Wesley neither are we water Pentecost we got to be the children of water this is through the pregnancy of water the word of God to bring forth a child of water this age the water not the shark nope God have mercy I hope you understand could not be pregnant no so what did he do he did water put her away in water divorcement but she didn't put him away he put water her way what are you trying to say glory to God remember you could not feed the water Lutheran back in them days please check somebody I can't take it anymore Shake somebody even the one behind you shake their hand so you make sure they're awake I don't want anybody sleeping and tomorrow you got problems everybody okay you could not feed the water lose we okay loot them back in them Catholic no sir he had the water fresh meat that was for that churches you could not feed who a Methodist Lutheran water message oh he didn't want the water he was water rotten the life has done what left and went into water something else that old stock dad is what yeah back water back there the life is water moving on Peter can you feed the water bride of Jesus Christ foreign [Applause] you know I was telling somebody that people in this message a really miss brother brother when brother Branham was talking about Luther and Presbyterian and Wesley brother Branham was picking a sample to demonstrate or to manifest the denominational spirit if I tell you you know a man you know a man you know men are big men are bulky men are these you still have an illusion but if I turn around I say a man who look like brother Charles then you have an idea I say man look like brother Angelo now your idea becomes more clear so if brother Branham just say denomination denomination you won't get it brother Branham have to go where that Spirit was operated to show you that look at what they're doing they're doing clicks that is denomination they are breaking our Brotherhood that is denomination they are separating the Christian that is denomination they pass through our detail that is denomination and then brother Branham have to demonstrate all of him amen so the message believer when they came they kept their eyes on the Baptist on the Pentecostal and on the metal this and they missed brother Branham used them to demonstrate the denomination of spirit the denomination of spirit was already working with them so leave them alone come into the message now [Applause] do you follow me that denomination of spirit when the life left the shark he also entered the message ring everybody okay now you need to leave the Baptist alone leave the metal this alone leave the Pentecostal alone leave the Presbyterian Alone brother brother I'm already dealt with them let's see the Baptist in the message that's where your problem is that's why you go to a Baptist Church you live you go to a message you feel the same spirit it is not a message Church it is a Baptist Church under the pretest of the message [Music] you get the message oh anointing anointing anointing oh prophecy all this going on the women long hair high heel in the church tight dresses make up all around that's a Pentecostal anointing [Applause] how can you sleep with a man and come in the church and sing how can you sleep with a woman enjoy five times and you come to church and you sing like an angel that is not our anointing that's a Pentecostal anointed I'm going up [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah brother he said you cannot they freed the bread of Jesus Christ what Panic no indeed make up blood organization nothing doing it nine water no for the promise is what and before the water great and water terrible day Elijah the prophet yes sir what are you trying to say and I wind up here everybody okay that's why brother Branham say the day of Pentecost follow me carefully make sure you look at this please because I don't want to say somebody say you're giving people orders he said that they are Pentacles their Spirit directed it right into what there to water what is brother Brian I'm saying brother Branham is saying that when the message came on the day of Pentecost there was a specific word for that day of Pentacles not today do you follow me don't worry don't worry I'm okay war is nothing for me yeah I'm already ready I know where I'm standing everybody okay he said the day of Luther is directed at right to water into that and Wesley and in the last Pentecostal move but this is what another age this is a water calling out of the blood the bride not water 2000 years ago Pentacles we're not going back to chemicals oh we are not repeating Pentacles [Applause] [Music] continue to swallow when you finish you tell me why because the Pentecostal of Azusa Street represented the day of Pentecost and later on despair [Applause] let me read it again he said that this is water refer me my brother this is the water calling out of them right not 2 000 years ago at what Pentacles so the message is not the return it is nothing repeat [Music] don't worry my friend the word that on the day of water Pentecost will not work when this day [Applause] right age [Applause] everybody following me everybody following me when brother Branham came the light or the light was with the Pentecostal brother brother had to go to the Pentecost so people to receive the Holy Ghost but later on the life left the shark and he moved on into the grain you need to be careful when you talk about the Holy Ghost now [Applause] the Holy Ghost in this message it will clean you up he will purify you he will change you it will transform you you're not gonna look like a Pentecostal [Applause] [Music] if your Holy Ghost make you sing and don't change your life tell that Holy Ghost I don't want you [Music] out do you follow me you don't get me this is not the hour of playing games if your Holy Ghost doesn't take pornography off of you you need to stop and tell him you say listen to me I was with you for a solo you cannot take phonography away I don't want you anymore I need the holy ghost that can clean up amen [Applause] this is why many people will miss the rapture amen how can I roll on the floor and tomorrow I have these Hills like this your Holy Ghost doesn't tell you about the Hills he only tells you about the spiritual things so you want the gospel every day Jesus will bless you no matter what people say to you God is with you God is with and then you enjoy motivational speaking not to this message this message will encourage you but it will encourage you in the world he will he will clean you up it is not trimming time it is a cleaning message because the blood must be with us but without water we go [Applause] [Music] what kind of message are you trying to produce look at the life of brother Branham look at the life you're living is it the same thing I can say a lot of stuff but let me stop it here brother bottom says this what are you trying to say what does he mean going in the day of Pentecost not going there what does he mean and I stop God to the Pentecostal Church of this day the restoration of the water yes may Lord those men maybe some of them present here some of them hearing the tape around the world may they realize that this is what they're calling now off the water right not the water then it caused a message he said they paid the customer said wants to restore what the gifts back into the water the church we believe in gift in this church what was freaking talk we will prophesy but we want to make sure our life is lined up with the word of God Hallelujah he said but this is the water off the water right another word message that was come just before water wants to be watered let them understand Dear God why are you taking the people to entertainment huh so you want to feel good here you go home you drop again now that's a Pentecostal anointing everybody okay what time is it that we are living in something like a calendar you know you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you are living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age we are water living it living carefully we are not living in the Methodist stage the Baptist stage we are living in the water bride they're calling bringing back to God through a water channel that he water promise to bring it water bad so God in every age have a specific Channel in the day of Pentecost they have to wait for the Holy Ghost brother Branham say after Pentecost we don't wait for the Holy Ghost so if I return you back there you will be waiting for the Holy Ghost amen [Music] but after Pentecost Peter never say let's go to the upper room while Peter was yet water what happened to the people oh God help me let's land This Plane what are you trying to say the Holy Ghost God always has a way buckle up we're going to the airport there is water that is our way or water his ways God has a way for water today for he is always made a way for everything God at the beginning nor the hand so he has laid out his water scripture for water each age and that age when he comes now don't fail to see this damage when he come along usually the Water mystery is so water mixer into water isms and water so forth till they are water Mills and miles away from the word that's why it's hard to move message Believer from a Pentecostal tradition amen everybody okay he said God has made a way for us God love his children he loves his people he wants to help them he wants to help you more than you want to help if you can get that in your heart that God is more willing to help you than you are to help yourself but he has the water wait and that is the only way that he will work is through his way you must come to water his terms what are you trying to say when God opened the message of Luther do you follow me you can never find God but we're looteries do you get what I'm saying yes sir you get what I'm saying if you found God in that age that God will bring you back where looteries and when God moved to Wesley age if you want to thank God you must find him where we're slaves when God moved into the Pentecostal age you must find God in the channel he's operating if not you're gonna miss God help me he said you must come to his term not your turn his turn you wanted a water certain way but he gives you water his way God said this is my messenger you are taking the messenger you rejected and you're going with your own thinking yeah you want to get your own Holy Ghost right now amen Lord help me finish here how am I he said but each age has its part of the water gospel already what predicted this bubble is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ they can no more add to it or anything taken away from it the person who does it is Curse we cannot add nothing to it take nothing from it we must look in here and see what is Promised for water this age and see what you and then see it what happened that is water God interpreting his own water world that's why when brother Branham says this let's just ring the bell now we found that in each age When God Says certain things will happen here come thy man along and manifest that here come thy people along and live that that was God himself living in the people because he was answering of he was answering of his word now God's only provided way and only provided what plan today is water his son through his word for what this age amen that's the only provided way that's why we cannot take you back to Luther we cannot take you back to Wesley we cannot take you back to colomba that is not God's program for today oh my brother Branham says this morning he preached token he said the message this morning was to me the highlight of what the message of my entire what Ministry this morning see the Highlight message of my entire world Ministry someday I will tell you how I come to it and I know that everything has worked for month and month and month after water this one message moving up to come to this place that was the water nothing else the capping of time of brother brother message is which message the talking the talking that's very good let's see what he says the lamb was killing the water evening time after being kept up for water 14 days and then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the water evening too you get it the dog can never come in existence until the water evening time which token are you talking about which token are you talking about the dog can come in the evening time which token are you gonna put on the people which talking are you want to give the people they're talking of Luther they talking no Wasteland they're talking about preaching part rightly defining the world if you didn't know it that's fun you did it and they ignorance from today change your language [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay let me finish with this one I looking for water a time of water Break Forth Break Forth of water the spirit of God can you buckle up I'm landing here I'm looking for water guys you're not preaching with me let's preach so we can learn this point I am looking for water a ton of a water break full of the water spirit of God in this water last day that we are not living in a fully Madness search not the onset another one search a second oil [Applause] another water off the water Holy Spirit to the Water Church for water rapturing faith what gives you rapturing faith it is not the seven Thunder is it not the third pool so why are you playing with the Thunders why are you playing with the seals why are you playing with the pools give me the entire message don't tell me what is inspired on what is notified don't tell me what is not necessary and what is necessary I need the whole thing I need the entire message the whole things belong to me let's stand [Applause] eat it which token do you need you want to go get the TD Jake you want to go get it a Joel Austin you want to go get it at the Methodist you need to find where the life is people brought their own Baptist idea into the message they brought their own Pentecostal idea into the message the one who came from Presbyterian Church bring Presbyterian tradition in the message and if you go to that message they behave like press we tell you you go to the message they behave like Pentecostal because the pastor came from a Pentecostal chain you will see them all the way just move it Just watch where the person came from but we take everything we're looking for another search of the Holy Spirit into the church for water just before we come and everything is sitting straight in order for that and I believe that we are now at the time that the word should have water preeminine I believe that the time to lay aside our what Creed and our water and come back to water the word which word are you coming back to Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is water the seals that were open because the seals were Christ that seal is not the book it is not intellectual it is a person amen now it's beginning to pull away their weights begin to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is the latter day this is the this is the this is when water must be water to follow God this is Luke to be water this is the second hey I won't say it you fill it up yourself you fill it up yourself you fill it up yourself this is the second one [Applause] this is water I have heard the Lord and I was coming but now I can see with my water use it for a reference sometimes Minister here for mother Minister and they just repeat what they heard not knowing they are blaspheming the message because a big preacher says that the seals are not revealed you will see Minister under him all of them will preach the seals are not revealed not even taking time like Paul to sit down and to pray God and to read the message and to look at the Bible and to study for themselves and ask Elders like Elders I don't understand this I don't understand to see what is going on but we just copy copy one another copy copy one another and before you know it we got clicks this convention clicks these convention clicks this convention the people over there don't go in this way the people is that the Holy Ghost is that the Holy Ghost and we claim to believe the same message no we're not in the same message we got the message and denomination under the message but it's time to come out of those denominations let's go back to the work where we can fellowship with our brother fellowship with her sister even if they don't understand we understand them we bear with them show a good attitude let me show you maybe something you don't know Apollos was a preacher but he didn't know everything he took power as krita and Priscilla a brother and a sister to show a preacher [Applause] [Music] Lord willing we will continue next time brother David let me talk to the boss and see I might change this subject the title and this third out for today need to go for next week let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father I thank you for the grace that the people have given us to go some extra mile so that we can lay the foundation not only for the people here in spoken word Tabernacle but they are people worldwide that are confused that have questioned they are Minister that have copied one another and never had a chance to sit down and some of them don't mean bad but probably they don't have access to the whole material to know certain quotes that they were not exposed to or sometimes just as you use the far form Ministry we need one another to Fellowship to talk so that we can share different views that the other doesn't want to see does not have seen yet except if the attitude is bad then we have to rely in prayer so that you can sweeten the temper and then father we can open our heart to see what is going on Father this is to stabilize the church this is to unders to make your children understand Father Paul was fighting against you not even realizing that he was persecuting you because he was under the leadership of men under the leadership of the Sanhedrin under the leadership of the high priest and he thought what they were talking in the hasah engine that was the absolute but father Your Grace reveal itself unto him Lord showing him that power you are persecuting me and he realized that the very thing that he was attacking was the very life that could have changed and save him and father if you did it for Paul the time is later the people in the message has suffered under many Doctrine and the many move and the many pools here and there until the younger generation That Grew didn't even have any ground on the scripture they just he quote quote quote but don't know how to trace things in the scripture but father you left us some Elders that could direct us Lord father you are bringing up a new crop that is Lord father bringing things clearly so that your children can see Delight because you are not the author of confusion Lord may you Enlighten your children may you bring them Revelation May those that have been struggling may they see the light may they understand where we need to take the people to because if we take them back to the nomination father we will fail the church fair the individual power went into the raft went into the rest and the wedding for the Rapture but they without us they cannot be made perfect and Paul could even say that when that which is perfect to his God he knew he didn't have the complete revelation father now it has been now open and that Revelation in the brother will Quicken and bring the dead to rise again it takes more than what we have in the ages that's why you came yourself and opened the seals now that no one could open it was not brother Branham that opened them because when they look for the King's Men with him and brother Branham was nothing even John himself was weeping he only took the lamb himself to come and take the book and break it and when you came down you put one foot on the earth one foot on there on the on the sea you are mastering the two beasts with an open book where the seals are broken make those that don't understand these seals may you help them Lord may you take this congregation may they go home each one of them may they come back and they appointed all the time at home and review this sermon and open the scripture and search the scripture and go quote by code and communicate with me if they need more because I have more court that I could have provided than this but father may you help them we thank you for everything we prayed for those that are sick father there has been a virus on demand making children and people sick and if anybody has been affected father may you touch them may you remember brother John as they are Lord father in The Wedding of her sister living father may you help them so that everything goes well and may they come here safely father protect us throughout the week help us and strengthen our body as we thank you and commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you church we love you Mercy [Music] slam Jesus the
