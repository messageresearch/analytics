[55:29] Lord God I Abend everything else unto
[55:31] you and this sermon unto you in Jesus
[55:33] Christ's name I pray
[55:35] amen amen um if we could go to the
[55:39] scripture reading this evening first
[55:42] king Chapter 19 Verse 5 to10
[55:59] if you're dare can you say
[56:02] Amen now first king chapter 19:5 says
[56:06] this and as he lay and slept under a
[56:09] Jenifer tree behold then an angel
[56:12] touched him and said unto him arise and
[56:15] eat and he looked and behold there was a
[56:18] cake bacing on the cold and a cruise of
[56:21] water at his head and he did eat and
[56:24] drink and laid him down again
[56:27] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[56:29] second time and touched him and said
[56:31] arise and eat because the journey is too
[56:34] great for thee and he arose and did eat
[56:37] and drink and went in the strength of
[56:39] the meat 40 days and 40 nights onto the
[56:42] herb the Mount of
[56:44] God and he came thether unto a cave and
[56:48] lodged there and behold the word of the
[56:51] Lord came to him and he said unto him
[56:54] what do what doest thou here Elijah and
[56:57] he said I have been very jealous for the
[57:00] Lord God of of hosts for the children of
[57:03] Israel have forsaken thy Covenant drwn
[57:06] down thy Altar and slain thy prophets
[57:09] with the sword and I even I alone am
[57:13] left and they seek my life to take it
[57:15] away may the Lord God bless the reading
[57:17] of his word you may be
[57:20] seated
[57:22] now the thing that I wanted you that I
[57:24] want to attract you from the scriptures
[57:26] the fact that the Lord God when Elijah
[57:29] because the prophet of God said this was
[57:31] after Elijah had done great wonders
[57:35] brought down the rain and stopped the
[57:38] rain rather and brought down the fire
[57:40] and the moment when Jezebel had
[57:42] threatened his life Elijah had ran away
[57:44] the prophet of God say he got out of the
[57:46] inspiration of God and when he went he
[57:49] ran away God had came to um Elijah and
[57:53] when God came to
[57:55] Elijah God started waking him up and
[57:57] feeding him and waking him up and
[57:59] feeding him and Elijah had to be
[58:01] sensitive to the spirit of God to know
[58:03] when God came so he may wake up and feed
[58:06] upon the word that God was giving unto
[58:09] him because the prophet of God also said
[58:12] after he was after Elijah fed upon the
[58:15] word after he was done eating and he
[58:17] went on that Journey for 40 days and 40
[58:19] night the prophet of God said that he
[58:20] was wandering Elijah was wandering as he
[58:23] was walking until when he came unto a
[58:26] cave he had came to himself the prophet
[58:29] of God said he came to himself and when
[58:31] he came to himself there was winds that
[58:33] were blowing and Thunders that were
[58:35] blowing but he stayed still until a calm
[58:38] still voice had came see Elijah had to
[58:41] stayed still so he can detect the voice
[58:43] of God coming to
[58:45] him and if you and if you would take um
[58:49] Luke chapter 8 verse
[58:52] 43 chapter 8 verse 43 with me
[59:21] now in Luke chapter 8 verse 43- 48 it
[59:25] says and a woman having an issue of
[59:28] blood 12 years which had spent all her
[59:33] living upon Physicians neither neither
[59:36] could be healed of any came behind him
[59:39] and touched the border of His Garment
[59:41] and immediately her issues of blood St
[59:44] standard stened and Jesus said who
[59:48] touched me when all denied Peter and
[59:51] they that were with him said Master the
[59:54] multitude thred thee and pray thee and
[59:56] sayest thou who touched thee who touched
[59:59] me and Jesus said somebody have touched
[1:00:02] me for I perceive that virtue is gone
[1:00:06] out of me and and when the woman saw
[1:00:10] that she was not ahead she came
[1:00:12] trembling and fell falling down before
[1:00:15] him she declared unto him before all the
[1:00:18] people for what cause she had touched
[1:00:21] him and how she was healed immediately
[1:00:25] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[1:00:29] Comfort thy faith have made thee whole
[1:00:32] go in
[1:00:34] peace now I want for my subject tonight
[1:00:38] I'm want to speak about reens
[1:00:41] resensitization to the Spirit by the
[1:00:53] word resensitization
[1:00:57] by resensitization to the Spirit by the
[1:01:01] word now the word resensitization if we
[1:01:03] had a first break it down the word
[1:01:05] sensitization which means to be
[1:01:06] sensitive by the by the definition of it
[1:01:09] being sensitive means to be quick to
[1:01:12] detect or respond to a signal or to a
[1:01:16] issue now we find out over here Jesus
[1:01:19] Christ as he was walking and after that
[1:01:21] he sensed someone touch me he sensed
[1:01:24] virtue leave out of him because Jesus
[1:01:26] says I perceive perceive means to be
[1:01:28] aware
[1:01:29] of and the prophet of God has said that
[1:01:32] Jesus Christ because Jesus said he does
[1:01:35] nothing unless if the father has showed
[1:01:36] him to do so and the prophet of God said
[1:01:39] in this specific Instinct Jesus had
[1:01:42] didn't see any vision from the father
[1:01:44] Jesus had not seen anything but as he
[1:01:46] was walking because Jesus Christ is God
[1:01:49] himself the spirit of God full bodily is
[1:01:51] inside Jesus Christ that mean he's
[1:01:53] constantly sensitive to the spirit and
[1:01:55] he's conly sensitive to also the spirits
[1:01:57] around him that mean the moment somebody
[1:02:00] had touched him and Jesus Christ felt
[1:02:02] that connection of someone touching him
[1:02:04] in a specific type of way with a
[1:02:06] specific intention Jesus felt virtue
[1:02:09] leave him and the prophet of God said
[1:02:11] that Jesus Christ felt a little bit
[1:02:14] weaker and that's that's being sensitive
[1:02:17] now resensitization means to go back to
[1:02:21] to be connected again in in another way
[1:02:24] now as we see the Prophet Elijah he used
[1:02:28] to be connected to God as he was walking
[1:02:30] that's why he stopped he could stop the
[1:02:32] rain that's why he could bring the fire
[1:02:34] down he was connected to God but when um
[1:02:38] Jezebel had came in and after threatened
[1:02:40] his life he started he got out of the
[1:02:43] inspiration of God and after he left the
[1:02:45] the sensitivity of God he he stopped
[1:02:47] being connected to him till he had to go
[1:02:49] back inside the cave until he had to
[1:02:51] come back to himself to be
[1:02:53] connected to be connected um with God
[1:02:56] again
[1:02:58] which which is kind of the type of the
[1:03:00] human being when when we were created
[1:03:03] when God had created us he had created
[1:03:06] us he made us bypass our theophany and
[1:03:08] we automatically by default were
[1:03:12] subjected to the five senses and the
[1:03:14] five senses is something that you cannot
[1:03:16] connect God With God you cannot sense
[1:03:19] you cannot be sensitive to the spirit
[1:03:21] with the five senses brother brandom
[1:03:23] even say you cannot be sensitive to the
[1:03:24] five Spirit by the senses in um
[1:03:28] 1951 faith is the substance brother
[1:03:31] brandom says but when men was put in
[1:03:34] human flesh then God gave him five
[1:03:37] senses to to contact not God but his
[1:03:40] Earthly home these things the senses of
[1:03:44] the body is only to declare or to
[1:03:47] contact Earthly things here on Earth not
[1:03:50] Heavenly things and then your inward man
[1:03:53] is the spirit which has two senses faith
[1:03:57] and unbelief you
[1:03:59] see and in the pillar of fire of 1953
[1:04:03] paragraph 17 brother BR says now the
[1:04:05] world's without form and void and water
[1:04:09] was upon the Deep where where in Genesis
[1:04:12] 1 now see then he made all the plants
[1:04:15] live then after a while he made man in
[1:04:18] his own image that was the spirit man
[1:04:21] and if he made man in his own image he
[1:04:24] had to make him him something on the
[1:04:27] order of that supernatural being that's
[1:04:30] right when there was no man to tell the
[1:04:33] soil Genesis 2 then he made out of the
[1:04:37] Dust of the earth not in His image but
[1:04:42] Out of the Dust of the earth he might he
[1:04:45] might give him a hand like a monkey and
[1:04:48] a foot like a bear I don't know what he
[1:04:51] give him but he pull him in five senses
[1:04:54] to contact the Earth
[1:04:56] home see our five senses are was given
[1:05:00] to us to contact the Earth to contact
[1:05:01] the stuff of the earth that's why it's
[1:05:03] easier for us to sympathize with the
[1:05:05] desires of the world sometimes it's
[1:05:07] easier for us but that six sense when he
[1:05:10] comes he puts all the five sense into a
[1:05:12] subjective two way you
[1:05:18] see and in faith is the Sixth Sense
[1:05:22] brother Brenham says paragraph 6 1960 he
[1:05:25] says if we could only be spiritual and
[1:05:28] use the six sense we how many things we
[1:05:32] could bypass how many things would know
[1:05:35] if the church was in order where the
[1:05:37] spirits and the gifts of the church
[1:05:39] would be operating would have ananas and
[1:05:42] safaris laying all over everywhere
[1:05:45] that's right sin would be out of the
[1:05:47] church but we become so Earth bounded
[1:05:51] with our senses so just so well if I
[1:05:55] can't see it if I can't and then them
[1:05:58] senses the devil gets into those senses
[1:06:01] and he will let you see something your
[1:06:04] eyes and then disbelief it anyhow
[1:06:07] because many times you've kept your eyes
[1:06:10] closed so long until you're
[1:06:13] blind now brother Brenham also says in
[1:06:17] 1959 of here is th Elijah he says
[1:06:21] that and when we find him now in the
[1:06:24] cave way back pulled up in the cave and
[1:06:28] God wanted to talk to him and the Bible
[1:06:30] said that there was a great Mighty Wind
[1:06:33] went by and then the earthquake and then
[1:06:35] the great tearing up and shaking but
[1:06:37] Elijah just sat sat still and after a
[1:06:41] while there was a still Small Voice
[1:06:43] spoke and Elijah recognized that to be
[1:06:45] God and he put the manle over his face
[1:06:48] and walked out to meet
[1:06:51] him I would I wonder if we the church
[1:06:55] wasn't Listen to Too Much rushing wind
[1:06:58] and and thunder and blood and lightning
[1:07:00] until we fell to hear that's still small
[1:07:02] voice and it's time to come back to it
[1:07:05] now you see when I was reading this see
[1:07:07] there's a story that comes um in mind to
[1:07:10] this too which is the story of King soul
[1:07:12] I had asked several people like what do
[1:07:14] you know about King soul and most of the
[1:07:15] time it's negative when I went back to
[1:07:17] read the story of soul soul from a young
[1:07:20] age he was actually a pretty good boy
[1:07:23] from the start his father had told so so
[1:07:26] like his father had lost three donkeys
[1:07:27] and his father told so so go find the
[1:07:31] donkeys that we lost take a servant with
[1:07:33] you and sa was obedient because he took
[1:07:35] the servant with him and he went looking
[1:07:36] for the he went looking for the three
[1:07:38] donkeys now sa was someone that was
[1:07:40] sensitive to both God and his father and
[1:07:44] the reason why I see he was sensitive to
[1:07:45] his father is because on his way as the
[1:07:48] day went by and the days were was going
[1:07:52] to go
[1:07:53] past so had told servant let us not t
[1:07:57] let us hurry up so we can go back before
[1:07:59] our father leaves the other flocks of
[1:08:01] donkeys and start worrying about us and
[1:08:03] start thinking about us see he was being
[1:08:05] considered he was since so was living
[1:08:08] with his father for a certain period of
[1:08:09] time he KN he knew how his father would
[1:08:11] act he knew how his father would respond
[1:08:14] because he was sensitive to his
[1:08:16] father now when so um when so had when
[1:08:21] he was on his way back to go back he
[1:08:23] heard that there was a man of God in the
[1:08:25] City nearby and the thought came to so
[1:08:28] he was like let us stop by the man of
[1:08:30] God and as I was reading the Scripture
[1:08:31] it thought came to me he was like seek
[1:08:33] you first the king of the God and all
[1:08:34] shall follow and at at the time I didn't
[1:08:37] know what I didn't know why God had
[1:08:39] given me that but then we we found out
[1:08:41] when Soul came to Samuel the prophet
[1:08:43] Samuel God had actually revealed to
[1:08:45] Samuel before Soul came that Soul was
[1:08:47] going to come because the prophet Samuel
[1:08:49] was also a man that was sensitive to the
[1:08:50] spirit of God now when Soul came to
[1:08:54] Samuel Samuel had told him oh I was
[1:08:57] expecting you I was expecting you to
[1:08:59] come in fact the three donkeys that you
[1:09:01] were looking for you don't need to look
[1:09:02] for them anymore because they already
[1:09:04] found the Lord God already found it then
[1:09:06] in my mind I was like ah that now I know
[1:09:08] why God had given me the thought the
[1:09:10] Revelation that oh at this place when
[1:09:12] Soul was going to seek for the man of
[1:09:15] God that he was seeking the kingdom and
[1:09:17] once he arrived to the man of God as
[1:09:19] arriving at the Kingdom everything
[1:09:20] followed them everything he was looking
[1:09:22] for was
[1:09:23] so now he stayed with the prophet of God
[1:09:26] and the prophet of God was talking to
[1:09:27] him and as he was talking to him he was
[1:09:29] basically feeding on the word with him
[1:09:31] and when when they were done so got up
[1:09:34] and went back home and when he went back
[1:09:36] home it was another day and his father
[1:09:39] had already left the three donkeys and
[1:09:40] he was already worried showing that so
[1:09:43] since he grew up with with his father
[1:09:45] and he was sensitive to his father he
[1:09:47] knew how his father would react and the
[1:09:49] fact that his father reacted how he had
[1:09:52] how he sensed he would react that shows
[1:09:54] that so was sensitive to his
[1:09:56] father now the thing about Saul is when
[1:10:00] he stayed with the prophet as in when he
[1:10:02] stayed with the word he received a new
[1:10:04] heart and when he received a new heart
[1:10:07] he he became more sensitive to God to
[1:10:09] the point where God had came down in
[1:10:12] inside soul the spirit of God came
[1:10:14] inside so which is a type of receiving
[1:10:16] the Holy Ghost he came inside so and he
[1:10:18] started prophesying that people started
[1:10:20] asking so you're are you one of the
[1:10:23] prophets and even other people that knew
[1:10:25] him they were like is this the same soul
[1:10:27] that we knew that's prophesying but the
[1:10:29] issue with soul was when he got into the
[1:10:33] word he got he ended up straying away by
[1:10:37] the five senses by by he ended up
[1:10:39] straying away by the um by he ended up
[1:10:44] straying away by the desires of the
[1:10:46] World by being a people pleaser and by
[1:10:49] him being a people pleaser he deviated
[1:10:52] from the word of God the first time he
[1:10:55] deviated was when he didn't um follow
[1:10:58] the order of waiting for Samuel so
[1:11:00] Samuel can give a sacrifice and the
[1:11:02] second time he deviated he deviated by
[1:11:05] not killing all the amalekites and
[1:11:07] here's the thing since so after he fell
[1:11:11] the first time he already got
[1:11:12] desensitized away from God that mean he
[1:11:14] wasn't sensitive to God anymore and the
[1:11:17] proof of that is the fact that after he
[1:11:19] killed the amalekites and he left the
[1:11:22] king and left certain um herbs he came
[1:11:25] to so he came to Samuel and he started
[1:11:27] telling Samuel look I have obeyed the
[1:11:29] Commandments of the Lord see he was so
[1:11:31] desensitized he couldn't even recognized
[1:11:33] that he was not obeying the Commandment
[1:11:35] of the Lord and after the prophet Samuel
[1:11:37] had to come and after he told him what
[1:11:39] you're doing what you did was not
[1:11:41] obeying the Commandment of the Lord and
[1:11:43] so still told Samuel yes I did see he
[1:11:46] was so desensitized to the word of God
[1:11:49] that even when the prophet of God was
[1:11:50] telling him he could not even see that
[1:11:52] he wasn't being obedient until the
[1:11:54] prophet of God God told him again that's
[1:11:56] when Soul came to himself and he was
[1:11:58] like oh I see I have sinned and and he
[1:12:02] tried to plead the prophet of God so the
[1:12:04] prophet of God can do something interess
[1:12:07] for him but the prophet of God left
[1:12:08] because the moment because the word of
[1:12:10] God is sensitive and the prophet said
[1:12:12] Samuel was the top of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:14] the top of the Holy Ghost and the moment
[1:12:17] Soul deved away from God Samuel backed
[1:12:20] away because the Holy Spirit cannot be
[1:12:23] in connection with someone that's that's
[1:12:25] against the
[1:12:26] word now in 1960 the unchangeable god
[1:12:31] brother Brenham says when he pulled back
[1:12:33] in the cave there come an earthquake
[1:12:36] outside that shook the cave where he was
[1:12:38] sitting there come a mighty rushing wind
[1:12:41] there come Thunders lightning and bows
[1:12:44] and boeings it was
[1:12:46] all it was all God but it didn't attract
[1:12:50] the prophet it didn't touch him somehow
[1:12:53] he know what God power was he know God
[1:12:57] has shook the mountains he had he had
[1:13:00] had rushing winds and so forth he sent
[1:13:03] fire out of heaven but he
[1:13:06] waited and way down inside of him come a
[1:13:10] still little voice that attracted the
[1:13:13] prophet which was which is the top of
[1:13:15] the super sense which I fa to say
[1:13:17] earlier which is like my sub subject for
[1:13:19] today the super sense that attracted the
[1:13:22] prophet there was something he'd seen
[1:13:24] his power to do things but this time he
[1:13:27] felt his presence and he still and is
[1:13:31] still small voice speaking into his into
[1:13:34] his heart then the prophet raised up and
[1:13:37] went out went out to the end of the
[1:13:41] cave you see when when um when the
[1:13:45] Prophet Elijah came to himself and took
[1:13:47] the time to stay collected to try to
[1:13:50] resensitize himself to the word that's
[1:13:52] when God came in and when God saw him
[1:13:54] that he was calm that was ready to
[1:13:55] receive the word again God came back
[1:13:57] it's like brother Brenham said when
[1:13:59] someone has the Holy Spirit and he SS he
[1:14:02] SS um he says the holy spirit is like a
[1:14:05] little Dove that will fly to a branch a
[1:14:07] far off then it would wait for you to
[1:14:09] repent when you repent then the holy
[1:14:11] spirit will come back that's the same
[1:14:13] thing over here when so when um Elijah
[1:14:16] had came to himself and was calm and
[1:14:19] that's when the Holy Spirit came back
[1:14:20] and started speaking to him again now
[1:14:22] the prophet says sometimes we ask
[1:14:25] for things get something vice versa we
[1:14:28] make God something that we want to make
[1:14:31] him after the way we think he ought to
[1:14:34] answer see on this thing where people
[1:14:38] where the Prophet says that we make him
[1:14:40] ought to be something he had to answer
[1:14:42] as in people have this fairy tale
[1:14:45] imagination of God because they think
[1:14:48] God is someone that's far off that's
[1:14:50] beyond our grasp but by the by the
[1:14:53] preaching of the word we we're learning
[1:14:54] that that God is somewhere that's near
[1:14:56] us if we could just be connected with
[1:14:58] God if we could just be sensitive to God
[1:15:00] we would find out that God is right next
[1:15:02] to us that he's not somewhere that's far
[1:15:04] off people expect God to come down in a
[1:15:07] mighty way that's why even the um
[1:15:09] Israelite children have fell to receive
[1:15:12] God when he came in flesh because they
[1:15:13] expected God to come down with the whole
[1:15:16] Kingdom with a bunch of horses and
[1:15:18] everything and everybody bowing before
[1:15:20] them with light resonating everything
[1:15:22] that's why people expect God to come
[1:15:24] that's how people expect God to come
[1:15:25] they expect God to come how when the
[1:15:29] president comes down to Charlotte and
[1:15:31] there's a bunch of cars coming with him
[1:15:33] and they block every road that's how God
[1:15:35] that's how people expect God to come
[1:15:37] with all these attraction but now when
[1:15:39] God decides to come in his own manner
[1:15:41] people fail to detect God people fail to
[1:15:44] be sensitive and connect to God and
[1:15:46] that's where people fell
[1:15:49] at now in
[1:15:52] 1963 God hiding hiding himself in
[1:15:55] Simplicity the prophet says not the
[1:15:58] great
[1:15:58] glamorous things glamorous things that
[1:16:01] we think about but it's the simple
[1:16:04] things that God is so real in simplicity
[1:16:07] so it pleases God to reveal himself and
[1:16:10] then hide himself then hide himself and
[1:16:13] reveal himself in in simple things
[1:16:16] little things it's it's p over the top
[1:16:19] of of
[1:16:21] head the top of the head of man because
[1:16:24] if if you say why would a just God do do
[1:16:28] that is because that man was made up in
[1:16:32] the beginning not to try to shift for
[1:16:35] himself and man was made to rely
[1:16:38] completely on upon God that's the reason
[1:16:41] we're likened onto lamps or sheep a
[1:16:44] sheep cannot lead himself he has to have
[1:16:47] a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed
[1:16:49] to to lead us so man is made that way
[1:16:53] see we when we were created in Genesis
[1:16:56] um when we were created in
[1:16:58] Genesis 2:7 we we had the five senses
[1:17:01] which kept us grounded see and we
[1:17:04] weren't supposed to lead oursel with the
[1:17:06] five senses because the five senses will
[1:17:08] bring us to destruction we were supposed
[1:17:10] to be led by the Holy Spirit we were
[1:17:12] supposed to be connected with the Holy
[1:17:15] Spirit in everything that we do we're
[1:17:18] supposed to be connected with the Holy
[1:17:20] Spirit now in heing him God says the BR
[1:17:25] brother bandam says that and God made
[1:17:28] all of his works so simple that the
[1:17:31] simple could understanding and God makes
[1:17:34] himself simple with this simple in
[1:17:38] order in order to be understood by the
[1:17:41] simple in other words he says in Isaiah
[1:17:44] 35 I believe he said though a fool
[1:17:47] should not error their end it's so
[1:17:50] simple and we know that God is so great
[1:17:53] till we expect it to be some great
[1:17:55] something and we miss the simple thing
[1:17:58] we stumble over Simplicity that's how we
[1:18:01] miss God Is by stumbling over Simplicity
[1:18:05] and God is so simple until Scholars of
[1:18:08] these days and all days miss him a
[1:18:11] million miles because in their
[1:18:14] intellects they know that there is
[1:18:17] nothing like him so great but in his
[1:18:20] Revelation he makes it so simple to go
[1:18:24] plump over the top of a a
[1:18:26] message see even even people outside in
[1:18:30] the world they know they know when you
[1:18:32] when you give them the name God you give
[1:18:33] them the title God they think God is
[1:18:35] somewhat somewhat big but because of the
[1:18:38] way God has revealed himself people
[1:18:40] start saying well that's not God your
[1:18:43] God is not true because they don't
[1:18:45] understand they're not they're not
[1:18:46] connected with that Revelation they're
[1:18:48] not connected with that so they can't
[1:18:50] understand the grasp they they want God
[1:18:52] to be some fairy tale imagination that's
[1:18:54] why when you look even in TVs and
[1:18:56] stuffff that are being projected when
[1:18:58] they project the image of God usually
[1:19:01] unless if they're Christian but even
[1:19:03] people that are Christian still tend to
[1:19:06] project God as someone that's far off
[1:19:09] that you can't even come in contact with
[1:19:10] him that you can't even come and see him
[1:19:12] and talk to him one to one you
[1:19:16] see and the prophet says miss him by the
[1:19:20] way that he reveals himself for he is so
[1:19:23] great yet hides himself self in
[1:19:25] Simplicity to make himself known to the
[1:19:27] least see don't try to get the great
[1:19:30] because he goes over the top of it but
[1:19:33] listen to the Simplicity of God and then
[1:19:35] he finds and then you find God right
[1:19:38] here in in in the simple way high
[1:19:41] polished worldly wisdom educated always
[1:19:45] miss it always misses it but what it is
[1:19:50] the people has so placed so much upon
[1:19:54] that still they're even in the Ser
[1:19:56] seminaries and so forth they are missing
[1:19:59] the very thing that God has put before
[1:20:16] them excuse me
[1:20:21] sorry um
[1:20:25] now
[1:20:30] for now High minded high polish worldly
[1:20:34] wisdom
[1:20:35] education the reason because when
[1:20:37] brother BR was talking about this he
[1:20:39] also managed he didn't say that oh you
[1:20:41] don't need to go to school to be
[1:20:42] educated because you still need to go to
[1:20:44] school to be educated in fact he had
[1:20:45] some teachers in the meeting with him
[1:20:48] that were there and brother brandom say
[1:20:50] I'm not telling y'all um to not be
[1:20:54] educated or that education is bad but he
[1:20:56] said that because God had revealed
[1:20:58] himself in Simplicity you can't just use
[1:21:01] big words because if you start using big
[1:21:02] words people of lower standard they're
[1:21:05] they're not going to comprehend you that
[1:21:07] mean when you start saying certain
[1:21:09] things it just going to go fly past them
[1:21:12] and they won't be able to detect what
[1:21:13] you're saying and when you start using
[1:21:15] broken words that are so below they
[1:21:17] won't be able to understand you either
[1:21:19] because now they have to try to code
[1:21:21] what you're trying to say you see now in
[1:21:25] in um God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:21:28] the the then revealing himself in the
[1:21:32] same paragraph 249 brother BR said the
[1:21:34] Methodist
[1:21:35] says when we shout we had it but they
[1:21:39] didn't the Nazar said when they lived
[1:21:42] holy they had it but they didn't the
[1:21:45] Pentecost said we speak in tongues we
[1:21:48] got it but they didn't see God unfolding
[1:21:51] himself not in Sensation that that
[1:21:55] Sensations yet is with it you see the
[1:21:58] place it gets it so humble till anybody
[1:22:03] can see can see it if if you don't try
[1:22:07] to P inject inject your own mind to it
[1:22:10] see and your own thoughts to
[1:22:13] it which this remind me of um a story
[1:22:16] actually brother Brandon had used it was
[1:22:19] a young man or brother Brian called him
[1:22:22] an Infidel that love to debate and he
[1:22:26] was seeing people that were being under
[1:22:28] the anointing and that he was like those
[1:22:30] are just Sensations and that there were
[1:22:32] a young man that was eating um or I
[1:22:34] believe a young girl was eating an apple
[1:22:37] as she was walking she wanted to ask
[1:22:39] that man just one question one separate
[1:22:41] question and as she came to the man and
[1:22:44] asked him um they the man asked him what
[1:22:46] do you want he was like I want to ask
[1:22:48] you is this apple that I have is it
[1:22:51] sweet or sour that that he said I I
[1:22:54] don't know I'd have to taste it after
[1:22:56] that he said all right that mean you you
[1:22:59] don't know if it's like because people
[1:23:02] tend to say it's sensation because
[1:23:03] there's two extremist there's people
[1:23:05] that are that act that act too sensitive
[1:23:08] to the Holy Spirit and there are people
[1:23:11] that are not sensitive enough and that
[1:23:13] they be like they'll be like oh when
[1:23:15] you're doing something they're like
[1:23:16] that's that's that's nothing
[1:23:18] Supernatural that's that's that can be
[1:23:20] explained that's just the five senses
[1:23:22] that's just emotion you see but you
[1:23:25] can't say that if you never felt it you
[1:23:27] can't say that if you were never if you
[1:23:29] are never sensitive to God you're not
[1:23:32] you you're not going to understand and
[1:23:34] know what those people are feeling you'd
[1:23:36] have to be there to know because brother
[1:23:38] Brandon was even
[1:23:40] saying um about I believe it was brother
[1:23:44] BR was saying about Lucifer he was like
[1:23:46] Lucifer for him to get to you he'd have
[1:23:48] to be baptized and he'd have to become a
[1:23:52] brother he had he'd have to be converted
[1:23:54] you you see he'd have to be converted
[1:23:55] and by then he won't touch you anymore
[1:23:58] meaning those people that are always
[1:23:59] saying that those are Sensations those
[1:24:01] are feelings those are emotion because
[1:24:03] they never felt it because if they would
[1:24:05] have felt it they weren't going to say
[1:24:07] that if they would have felt those
[1:24:08] Sensation that they call sensation if
[1:24:10] they would have felt the holy spirit in
[1:24:12] them if they would have been able to
[1:24:13] detect God in their life they weren't
[1:24:15] going to say that they weren't going to
[1:24:18] say that at all now in the super sense
[1:24:21] brother brandham says and the super
[1:24:24] sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of
[1:24:27] God that dwells in you and if you let
[1:24:30] the five senses be yielded to the six
[1:24:33] sense it'll guide you and bring out the
[1:24:37] other five senses under control of that
[1:24:40] super sense for it's so far above the
[1:24:43] natural senses as the spiritual man is
[1:24:46] above the natural it's as far as as high
[1:24:50] as the heaven is above the natural man
[1:24:53] and and his five senses it makes you
[1:24:57] believe things that you cannot see it
[1:25:00] makes you act where you do not think the
[1:25:04] five senses would would ever think about
[1:25:07] it the devil can get into these five
[1:25:11] senses and lie to you but you cannot
[1:25:14] touch that super sense that's far beyond
[1:25:17] his touch that come from God it's called
[1:25:21] faith faith is that great sense
[1:25:25] see that super sence the prophet of God
[1:25:27] said it's faith and that's God that
[1:25:28] comes from God Only God can detect God
[1:25:30] you see so you need God in your life to
[1:25:33] detect God that's why when we see in
[1:25:36] Adam in Genesis
[1:25:37] 1:27 Adam when he was a spirit man he
[1:25:40] was constantly in connection with God
[1:25:42] cuz he was constantly sensitive to God
[1:25:44] and he could feel God in all things
[1:25:49] but but when he had came and he was
[1:25:51] given the five senses which all Med was
[1:25:55] in is being introduced through the five
[1:25:56] senses first when they're being
[1:25:59] introduced through the five senses they
[1:26:01] for them to be connected with God they
[1:26:03] have to come through a new birth they
[1:26:05] have to come through resensitization
[1:26:07] that's the only way for them to be
[1:26:08] connected with God in any form in any
[1:26:12] shape now the prophet God says in super
[1:26:15] sense paragraph um 59 he says now in
[1:26:18] giving this illustration of the senses
[1:26:21] the natural man is born with these
[1:26:23] senses so they are natur they are nature
[1:26:26] given senses and that's really only
[1:26:29] thing he'll ever know about it in his
[1:26:32] intellectual thinking he can only think
[1:26:35] as a man he can see as a man he can
[1:26:38] understand as a man he can hear as a man
[1:26:41] but when he comes governed or
[1:26:44] regenerated or
[1:26:45] resensitized or we would call it born
[1:26:49] again then that six that six Super sense
[1:26:54] takes a hold of him in doing so that
[1:26:57] super sense raises him up into a spot to
[1:27:01] where he has Sai to believe things that
[1:27:04] he that he could not hear things that he
[1:27:07] could not see understand things that he
[1:27:10] could not understand he believes it
[1:27:13] anyhow because he's governed by that
[1:27:16] success that super sense and how
[1:27:19] marvelous it is and to think how simple
[1:27:23] it is to believe see being governed by
[1:27:25] that super sense it makes you because
[1:27:27] when when Abraham when Abraham got in
[1:27:30] contact with that super sense when
[1:27:31] Abraham got in contact with God he
[1:27:33] started speaking things into existence
[1:27:35] that wasn't there he started because the
[1:27:38] Bible says faith is the substance of
[1:27:40] things hope for the evidence of things
[1:27:42] unseen see for you to be in contact for
[1:27:45] you to see the things unseen you need
[1:27:47] Faith you need that super sense you for
[1:27:49] you to be sensitive to it you need that
[1:27:51] super sense and if you remember the
[1:27:53] title was to be
[1:27:54] sensitized by to the Spirit by the word
[1:27:58] in other words to be resensitized to God
[1:28:01] by God that's the only way for you to be
[1:28:02] resensitized because you can't be
[1:28:04] resensitized any other
[1:28:06] way now brother brand oer says in 19 in
[1:28:10] 1959 the super he says paragraph 60 now
[1:28:14] you cannot believe it until you are
[1:28:16] regenerated the Bible said that no man
[1:28:19] can call Jesus the Christ only by the
[1:28:22] Holy Ghost we went went through that
[1:28:25] this last week it's been such a
[1:28:27] stumbling block especially to the
[1:28:29] Pentecostal believing people when they
[1:28:31] hear me say that Jesus said in St John
[1:28:34] 5:24 he that heareth my word and believe
[1:28:38] it on on him that sent me has eternal
[1:28:41] life eternal life come from God alone
[1:28:45] and no man can say Jesus is Christ only
[1:28:48] by the holy the Holy Ghost and in this
[1:28:50] day and age the only way for men to
[1:28:52] receive the Holy Ghost is by the m of
[1:28:54] the hour and we already went through
[1:28:56] that if you're going through the
[1:28:57] Tabernacle when you're walking through
[1:28:59] the Tabernacle there's a certain step
[1:29:01] until you get to before you get to the
[1:29:03] holiest of holy there's the um the holy
[1:29:06] place where you have to where the
[1:29:08] Candlestick are shining the light up the
[1:29:10] table of the shoe bread we have to eat
[1:29:12] the word and we found out that in each
[1:29:15] age a messenger came and gave their word
[1:29:18] they gave their portion but when their
[1:29:20] time was over it was time to go to a
[1:29:22] different state to a different
[1:29:24] and brother BR said the only way for you
[1:29:27] receive the holy spirit is through this
[1:29:29] word no man is going to be raptured
[1:29:32] unless if they're inside the message
[1:29:34] because the message is where you find
[1:29:35] the Holy
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:39] Ghost now brother brandham says it's
[1:29:41] something about a a man that stays right
[1:29:44] with the word every time that he sees
[1:29:47] the word he punctuates it with an amen
[1:29:50] no matter what the other people
[1:29:52] say what what was it the six sense
[1:29:56] catching it the six sense that and the
[1:29:59] Holy Spirit was standing side by side
[1:30:02] the Holy Spirit was speaking the six
[1:30:05] sense was saying amen and there it is
[1:30:07] something something has to happen and
[1:30:10] brother Brenham was going around brother
[1:30:12] Brenham even gave um gave a testimony of
[1:30:15] a of two
[1:30:17] girls of two women one she was sick she
[1:30:20] came to brother Brenham and brother
[1:30:21] Brenham discerned her thoughts and told
[1:30:23] her about her issues and she believed
[1:30:25] and she got healed now there was another
[1:30:27] woman that came in who had an ulcer and
[1:30:30] she came into to brother Brenham and she
[1:30:31] was all happy brother Brandon was like
[1:30:33] why you brother Brandon was like why you
[1:30:35] happy but since brother Brandon sens her
[1:30:36] to the spirit the spirit told him she's
[1:30:39] happy because she saw her sister get
[1:30:41] healed meaning when she come in she's
[1:30:43] under expectation to also get healed you
[1:30:46] see now when she was T when brother
[1:30:48] brandham saw that brother BR started
[1:30:50] sing he said that do you believe you're
[1:30:51] healed and she said yes I believe she
[1:30:54] went home confessing that she was
[1:30:56] believed that she was healed every day
[1:30:58] she went by saying I am healed I am
[1:31:00] healed that sixcess in her that six
[1:31:03] sense in her that said amen to the word
[1:31:05] of God kept telling her that I am healed
[1:31:08] I am healed her neighbors would even
[1:31:10] asking her sister are you still eating
[1:31:12] normally she said no I'm not she said
[1:31:15] are you still able to eat she said no
[1:31:17] I'm not able to eat what I want to but I
[1:31:20] know that I am healed she kept
[1:31:21] confessing
[1:31:22] it until one until one night that aler
[1:31:26] was just removed she woke up and after
[1:31:29] that she started she felt hungry so she
[1:31:31] cooked the little eggs and after that
[1:31:32] she was like I'mma just eat this then
[1:31:34] she at it she still felt hungry then she
[1:31:36] started eating a lot eating eating
[1:31:38] eating and after she was like I'mma wait
[1:31:39] for it to come in and you know they all
[1:31:41] started to come in and kick in but she
[1:31:44] found out nothing happened and she was
[1:31:45] completely healed and and later on
[1:31:48] another
[1:31:49] man another man had came to brother
[1:31:52] brandom it was a blind and he had came I
[1:31:54] believe his name was John John Ryan he
[1:31:56] had came to brother brandham his people
[1:31:58] brought him to brother brandham and
[1:32:00] brother brandham had told him because he
[1:32:02] heard the stories of how other people
[1:32:04] got healed their discernment and they
[1:32:05] got healed now after he came to brother
[1:32:07] brandham brother brandham told him do
[1:32:09] you believe that you're healed he said
[1:32:10] yes I believe that I'm Healed and after
[1:32:12] that he brother BR said go and you're
[1:32:14] healed he went now his friends noticed
[1:32:18] that he wasn't healed Al he kept
[1:32:19] confessing he was his friend noticed
[1:32:21] that he wasn't healed so his friend
[1:32:23] brought him back to brother brandham and
[1:32:25] after brother brand when brother brand
[1:32:26] saw him he told Brother brandham I
[1:32:28] thought you said that I was healed and
[1:32:30] brother brand responded said I thought
[1:32:32] you say that you believe see now then he
[1:32:36] told Brother B yes I do believe then
[1:32:39] after that he left and he started
[1:32:40] confessing every day that he believed
[1:32:42] that six sense started working brother B
[1:32:45] said cuz he was a Catholic he didn't
[1:32:46] know how to trigger that six sense so he
[1:32:48] had to trigger it by confessing it
[1:32:50] repeatedly he had to confess it
[1:32:52] repeatedly till that sixcess was trigger
[1:32:54] da now one time he was um getting a
[1:32:57] haircut and and and he was getting a
[1:33:02] haircut as he was getting a haircut the
[1:33:03] barber was kind of like teasing him
[1:33:05] saying oh are you healed I thought you
[1:33:07] were healed I thought you went to that
[1:33:09] one um preacher over there that always
[1:33:11] does Miracles and then as as that man
[1:33:14] was talking he said yes I am healed
[1:33:16] until his eyes open after he ran out of
[1:33:19] the barber shop running cuz he was
[1:33:21] healed
[1:33:25] Hallelujah now in 1953 seeking after
[1:33:29] Jesus Jes the brother bam saying Jesus
[1:33:32] said verily verily I said unto
[1:33:35] you the son can do nothing in himself
[1:33:39] but what he sees the father do for whato
[1:33:42] whatsoever things the father doeth that
[1:33:44] he do doeth the son likewise and he
[1:33:47] he'll show you greater things greater
[1:33:50] than he greater than this that ye that
[1:33:53] ye might Marvel the father worketh and I
[1:33:56] worketh fether watch audience Jesus is
[1:34:00] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:34:02] Jesus didn't claim to be a Divine healer
[1:34:05] he claimed to to be God's son and that's
[1:34:08] what he was and and said he he could do
[1:34:13] he could do nothing until the father
[1:34:15] showed him what to do and the little
[1:34:18] while the word seees me no more yet
[1:34:21] you'll see me for for I'll be with you
[1:34:25] even in you to the end of the world now
[1:34:28] watch the things that I do say Jesus St
[1:34:32] John 12 St John 14:12 the things that I
[1:34:36] do shall you also and greater than this
[1:34:39] for I go to my father is that is that
[1:34:43] true if ye abide in me and my word in
[1:34:48] you ask what you may and it will be
[1:34:52] given that's it either right or wrong
[1:34:55] it's right you see now if Jesus standing
[1:34:59] was standing here wearing my suit
[1:35:02] tonight my shoes he couldn't heal
[1:35:04] brother BR say he couldn't
[1:35:07] heal he couldn't heal except he he would
[1:35:10] stay the same he would do the exact same
[1:35:12] thing you see if you're sens because
[1:35:15] based on those testimonies that brother
[1:35:17] bam gave those people were sensitive to
[1:35:19] the Holy Spirit and they the holy spirit
[1:35:20] in them reacted said amen to the Holy
[1:35:23] Spirit you see now God the brother
[1:35:26] brother B says God doesn't change he's
[1:35:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:29] that mean the presence of God being here
[1:35:31] tonight if you're capable of sensing the
[1:35:34] presence of God and you're able to feel
[1:35:36] that and connect with that presence of
[1:35:38] God that mean whatever issue you may
[1:35:40] have whatever problems you may have in
[1:35:42] your life all you have to do is just
[1:35:43] connect with God and touch God and it
[1:35:46] will come to pass God is not going to
[1:35:48] heal you unless if you try to connect
[1:35:50] with him with the Faith with that
[1:35:51] connection of of the faith amen of the
[1:35:54] super sense because the super sense was
[1:35:56] given to bring men in connection with
[1:35:59] God because the five sense the five
[1:36:01] senses were incapable of connecting with
[1:36:04] God but that super sense is the only
[1:36:06] thing that brings God that brings men to
[1:36:08] God to connect with to connect with
[1:36:12] God now this uh I'm Prett some of you
[1:36:16] may not be able to see it but this thing
[1:36:19] is like a coding engine you see my I had
[1:36:23] shared a copy of it with my brother and
[1:36:24] my brother was like I don't know how
[1:36:26] you're going to use this for your sermon
[1:36:27] but anyways this is a coding engine and
[1:36:30] the coding engine you type a a certain
[1:36:32] amount of script and when you tap the
[1:36:34] certain amount of script and you execute
[1:36:36] the script the commands that are
[1:36:38] implanted inside the coding engine it
[1:36:40] will run it now the thing about the
[1:36:43] coding engine is if there's even one
[1:36:45] letter that's out of cadence if there's
[1:36:47] even one letter one space out of order
[1:36:50] the thing will not execute the program
[1:36:53] will not run see the holy spirit is only
[1:36:56] is so sensitive that it cannot run when
[1:37:00] when that's why when Soul when King Soul
[1:37:02] had deviated away from God the prophet
[1:37:05] the prophet of God Samuel because
[1:37:06] brother BR say Samuel was the top of the
[1:37:08] Holy Ghost the prophet of God Samuel
[1:37:10] also had to back away from um Soul
[1:37:12] because the the the word of God the Holy
[1:37:15] Spirit cannot deviate just as the coding
[1:37:17] language even if one letter is out of
[1:37:19] cadence the word of God will not run the
[1:37:21] word of God will not stay and res di
[1:37:23] with you he will not run with that you
[1:37:26] see but when everything is perfect
[1:37:28] everything is there after you you
[1:37:30] execute it you're going to get the
[1:37:31] command you're going to get the word of
[1:37:32] God come out you going to get um when
[1:37:36] you going to get the word of God come
[1:37:38] out and be so be it you
[1:37:40] see and the same thing that Believers
[1:37:43] have to be today because many people if
[1:37:46] you go out and you're doing certain
[1:37:48] things people might be like well you're
[1:37:51] being a bit too extreme you see
[1:37:54] but the thing is they're not being
[1:37:55] extreme enough they're not being
[1:37:57] sensitive they're not sensitive to the
[1:37:58] spirit that's why they're calling it
[1:37:59] extreme because there's many times when
[1:38:02] you do certain things like when you
[1:38:05] dress a certain way and the people are
[1:38:06] saying y' people y message believers y'
[1:38:09] do too much y do too much y the way
[1:38:11] you're dressed the way you're wear um
[1:38:14] perfectly and everything y just do too
[1:38:16] much and Y just want to stay with the
[1:38:18] word the word the word you're just doing
[1:38:19] too much and you're being legalistic but
[1:38:21] in reality it's not that we're being
[1:38:23] regular it's just that we're sensitive
[1:38:25] to the spirit of God the word of God
[1:38:27] came to us and the word of God made us
[1:38:29] sensitive see the word of God came and
[1:38:32] made us sensitive to the word of God
[1:38:33] that we we cannot deviate just as the
[1:38:36] the Holy Spirit cannot deviate we also
[1:38:38] cannot deviate outside of the word you
[1:38:40] see because Jesus Christ has said let
[1:38:43] this mind be in you as let this Spirit
[1:38:45] be in you because that spirit of God is
[1:38:48] inside you you're just going to repeat
[1:38:50] what God has done you're just going to
[1:38:52] do what he done and Jesus Christ the
[1:38:55] holy spirit being so sensitive since he
[1:38:57] can't dwell in error he can't dwell in a
[1:39:00] place where it's outside the word of God
[1:39:03] you see since he can't dwell in that why
[1:39:05] why are there certain Believers that
[1:39:07] they find themselves in certain groups
[1:39:09] that people are not following the word
[1:39:11] you can clearly see they're not
[1:39:13] following the word but you find yourself
[1:39:14] in that in that environment but if you
[1:39:16] had the holy spirit in you if you were
[1:39:18] truly sensitized if you truly sensitive
[1:39:21] to the spirit of God you would not be in
[1:39:23] those environment you would not be in
[1:39:24] those circumstances and you would not be
[1:39:26] doing certain things that you would be
[1:39:28] doing because the prophet of God came in
[1:39:29] and he spoke about he spoke about high
[1:39:31] heels he spoke about how you're supposed
[1:39:33] to wear he spoke about how men should
[1:39:34] not wear shirts he spoke about all those
[1:39:36] spirits that come in with sports and
[1:39:38] stuff like that people are still posting
[1:39:40] those people are still being connected
[1:39:41] with those type of clicks and having
[1:39:43] debates of those type of manners you see
[1:39:45] instead of just being connected with God
[1:39:47] being sensitive to God and letting God
[1:39:49] rule their
[1:39:52] lives now
[1:39:54] in 1960 the rejection of the
[1:39:57] king the Christian robe is not made up
[1:40:01] of the church made theology right the
[1:40:04] Christian robe is made up of the baptism
[1:40:06] of the Holy Ghost and nothing less than
[1:40:09] that and the life to follow that baptism
[1:40:12] of the Holy Ghost makes you live right
[1:40:16] do right act right and talk right live
[1:40:20] right that is true you see because
[1:40:23] people don't know how to act people
[1:40:25] don't know how to live because they're
[1:40:26] not connected with God they're not
[1:40:28] connect they don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:40:29] they're not sensitive to the word
[1:40:31] because if we could go to um 1
[1:40:35] Samuel chapter chapter
[1:40:52] one because in first I want to show you
[1:40:56] how how the Holy Spirit when you have
[1:40:59] the Holy Spirit how it would make you
[1:41:00] live right do right and just be right
[1:41:03] because if you have the Holy Spirit it's
[1:41:04] supposed to make you sensitive to all
[1:41:06] spirit because the prophet God himself
[1:41:07] when he was giving discernment he was
[1:41:09] sensitive to all Spirit to the point
[1:41:11] where when he's Discerning he would tell
[1:41:13] people don't don't talk because the
[1:41:15] spirit is sensitive because he needs to
[1:41:17] hear to all he needs to hear all the
[1:41:19] spirits all around you see and the Holy
[1:41:21] Spirit when you're sensitive to the word
[1:41:22] is supposed to make you sensitive in
[1:41:24] every Department of your life as a
[1:41:26] father as a mother as a son as a as a
[1:41:29] friend in all department now in 1
[1:41:33] Samuel in 1st Samuel chapter 1 as I was
[1:41:36] reading
[1:41:38] this the Bible says now there was a
[1:41:41] certain man of Rim Zim of ephra and his
[1:41:46] name was Elan the son of jeram the son
[1:41:51] of eliu the son of of toou and the son
[1:41:54] of
[1:41:55] Z and and ephra and ephra and he had two
[1:42:00] two wives the the name of one was Hannah
[1:42:04] and the name of the other was panana and
[1:42:06] panana had children but panana had no
[1:42:10] had no
[1:42:11] children I mean Hannah had no children
[1:42:15] Hannah had no children and and this and
[1:42:18] this man went up on
[1:42:22] went excuse
[1:42:24] me and this man went up out of his of
[1:42:28] his City yearly to worship and to
[1:42:31] sacrifice unto the Lord of host in Shilo
[1:42:35] and the two sons of Eli of fenny and and
[1:42:41] F fena the priest of the Lord were
[1:42:46] there and when the time was that Alana
[1:42:49] offered he gave panana his wife and all
[1:42:53] his sons and his daughters portions but
[1:42:56] unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for
[1:42:59] he loved
[1:43:01] Hannah but the Lord has shot her womb
[1:43:05] and her adversary also provoked her sore
[1:43:08] for to make her freets because the Lord
[1:43:11] had shot her womb and as he did so year
[1:43:15] by year when she went up to the house of
[1:43:19] the Lord
[1:43:25] so she provoked her therefore she wept
[1:43:28] and did not eat now I want you to pay
[1:43:30] attention then said Alana her husband to
[1:43:34] her to to her Han Hannah why weepest
[1:43:38] thou and why eatest thou not and why is
[1:43:41] thy heart
[1:43:43] grieved am am not I better to to the
[1:43:47] then 10 10
[1:43:49] Sons so Hannah rose up after they had
[1:43:54] eaten in in Shiloh and after they had
[1:43:58] drank now Eli the priest set upon the
[1:44:01] seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord
[1:44:04] now in this story of Hannah and Alana if
[1:44:08] you would
[1:44:09] notice Hannah was going through some
[1:44:11] trials were going through some issues
[1:44:14] and she was mourning she was Grievous
[1:44:16] but Alana didn't just leave Hanah just
[1:44:20] Dem um live by herself he didn't just
[1:44:23] let her be he was sensitive to her accus
[1:44:27] to the fact that he went and cons
[1:44:29] consulted her I mean now I don't know
[1:44:31] what it means like what he meant by a
[1:44:33] husband's better than 10 uh Sons I'm not
[1:44:36] a husband so I wouldn't know but he went
[1:44:40] and conforted and conforted her and
[1:44:42] after he had been sensitive to her to go
[1:44:46] and warm her up if you would notice
[1:44:48] after they had talked Hanah went back to
[1:44:50] eating you see At first she wasn't
[1:44:52] eating but then she went back to eating
[1:44:54] only after Alana went to um talk to her
[1:44:57] you see now brother brenman had also
[1:44:59] given um other scenarios where there was
[1:45:02] a young man that he thought his wife was
[1:45:06] possessed by demons and he tried praying
[1:45:09] praying praying and brother Brandon was
[1:45:10] like what's the issue he was like oh I
[1:45:11] think my my wife is possessed by demons
[1:45:14] she doesn't like to do this this this
[1:45:16] and thir and brother brand was like you
[1:45:18] know all you could do is just give her a
[1:45:19] candy and all that would go away right
[1:45:21] all you have to do is just her and all
[1:45:24] that would go away go away and brother
[1:45:26] Bram also gave another knowledge where
[1:45:28] he was like he would sometime buy
[1:45:30] candies for his wife or sometime wash
[1:45:32] the dishes to help her out see brother
[1:45:34] brandham was sensitive to his wife's
[1:45:37] cues brother brandham was because when
[1:45:40] you're when you're a Christian you're
[1:45:42] supposed to be the best husband to your
[1:45:44] wife you see when you're a Christian
[1:45:45] you're supposed to be able to sense
[1:45:48] those type of
[1:45:49] connection and brother Brandon was
[1:45:51] senstive to his wife that he would help
[1:45:52] out from time to time although other he
[1:45:54] even said other minister might might
[1:45:56] make fun of him other minister might
[1:45:59] laugh at him from time to time but he
[1:46:00] didn't care because that's his wife and
[1:46:03] if you were the same thing with God you
[1:46:05] would try to be sensitive to God and try
[1:46:07] to please God more you see and there was
[1:46:10] also another story in particular that
[1:46:12] brother brandham gave about a late Paul
[1:46:15] Paul Raider the man every um there was
[1:46:18] something happening his wife wanted to
[1:46:19] go somewhere do something and his wife
[1:46:22] told him and he said no I don't feel
[1:46:25] like doing that and since he didn't feel
[1:46:27] like doing that she was hurt she was
[1:46:30] hurt and she was like she was hurt and
[1:46:32] she was weeping they say tears came down
[1:46:34] she was hurt and then he started saying
[1:46:36] well since since she's hurt let her be
[1:46:39] Hur see and but every morning she would
[1:46:42] kiss him and wave goodbye as he went to
[1:46:45] work now one day because a Christian
[1:46:47] needs to be sensitive to the spirit and
[1:46:49] when you're sensitive to the spirit the
[1:46:51] spirit will make you sensitive to every
[1:46:52] other Spirit you see now one day as he
[1:46:55] was walking he was walking to work
[1:46:57] halfway through the street or whatever
[1:47:00] he a thought guy had given him a thought
[1:47:02] he was like What if I go to work and I
[1:47:04] couldn't make it back to her what if I
[1:47:06] go to work and on my way back something
[1:47:08] had happened to her and she could have
[1:47:10] make it back to me see as he kept
[1:47:12] walking his heart felt heavy and heavy
[1:47:14] and heavy until he had her turn around
[1:47:16] and go back to her and the prophet of
[1:47:19] God said when he went back to her he
[1:47:21] didn't even apologize he didn't do
[1:47:23] anything he just opened the door when he
[1:47:24] opened the door he saw she was weeping
[1:47:27] she was crying because he was being
[1:47:28] ignorant he was being ignorant to her
[1:47:31] emotions he couldn't he wasn't being
[1:47:33] sens sensitive to to her emotions but
[1:47:36] now when she saw when he saw she was
[1:47:39] weeping what he did was grabbed her and
[1:47:40] kissed her and when he kissed her he
[1:47:42] went back out that thing he he went to
[1:47:44] the game he was like bye-bye and she was
[1:47:46] like bye-bye and the prophet said this
[1:47:48] time it was better this time he had a
[1:47:50] feeling into way it had emotion into it
[1:47:53] you see when you're when you're a
[1:47:55] Christian a Christian of God when you're
[1:47:58] when you're a child of God and you're
[1:48:00] connected with the Holy Spirit and
[1:48:02] you're sensitive to the spirit the holy
[1:48:04] spirit will make you sensitive to your
[1:48:06] neighbors it will make you sensitive to
[1:48:08] your brothers your fathers you will
[1:48:11] teach you how to be a better son it will
[1:48:13] teach you how to be a better wife a
[1:48:14] better husband
[1:48:17] [Applause]
[1:48:23] and and the spirit and brother Bram
[1:48:26] says and brother BR says and the first
[1:48:29] time that the church L their leaders
[1:48:32] take over the the lead take over to lead
[1:48:36] the people the Holy Spirit gets right
[1:48:39] away from them and very first the very
[1:48:43] first time that you go being led by Men
[1:48:47] by amen instead of God the holy spirit
[1:48:50] will get away from you
[1:48:53] will get away from you too let the Holy
[1:48:56] Spirit lead that's what we need is
[1:49:00] leadership and God gave us a leader and
[1:49:03] we don't hear it you see that's what we
[1:49:06] need in this time we need in this
[1:49:08] age that's what we need in this age is
[1:49:11] to be led by the Holy Spirit to be
[1:49:13] reconnected by the Holy Spirit
[1:49:14] reconnected to God you see
[1:49:23] we need to be Rec reconnected with God
[1:49:25] we need to we we need to be resensitized
[1:49:28] with God and let God just lead us in all
[1:49:32] things now brother BR has said and how
[1:49:36] that Elijah stood there bold with thus
[1:49:39] sayth the Lord oh God give us men like
[1:49:42] that he wasn't afraid to tell Jezebel
[1:49:46] about her condition he wasn't scared of
[1:49:49] Ahab he wasn't afraid that that he was
[1:49:52] mistaken he stood with boldness and
[1:49:54] walked up to Ahab and said not even do
[1:49:58] will fall till I call for it amen you
[1:50:01] see he didn't care what anybody else
[1:50:04] said he didn't care what anybody else's
[1:50:06] criticism was but he stayed with God and
[1:50:08] the prophet of God said he he prayed to
[1:50:11] God saying that give us men like that
[1:50:12] give us men that would stay with the
[1:50:14] word that would preach the word and not
[1:50:16] deviate away from the word that will
[1:50:17] preach the word and keep the word as
[1:50:19] pure as it is you
[1:50:20] see and brother br says what was what
[1:50:24] was he a sign to that sinful generation
[1:50:28] did Israel see it no they laugh at him
[1:50:32] made made fun of him he predicted that
[1:50:36] there would be a drought that there
[1:50:38] would
[1:50:39] be there would be trouble hunger
[1:50:42] starvation and prophesied boldly
[1:50:45] standing by himself with th say the Lord
[1:50:48] said Lord they killed all the TR of
[1:50:52] they've killed them all
[1:50:55] off I'm the only one is
[1:50:58] left that's standing with your word what
[1:51:01] was the trouble about the word of God
[1:51:04] Elijah wanted to stay with the word he
[1:51:07] was a real Prophet see the word the
[1:51:09] problem here wasn't oh Elijah what
[1:51:12] Elijah was doing or anything that the
[1:51:14] problem is people had issue with the
[1:51:15] word you see people could not be
[1:51:18] sensitive to the word and whenever the
[1:51:19] word came they felt like it hurt them so
[1:51:22] they just backed away they they couldn't
[1:51:23] connect with God they couldn't sensitize
[1:51:25] with God they they were under spiritual
[1:51:27] Amnesia kind of like this La Dean
[1:51:29] churches you see in this age the um the
[1:51:34] Bible says that they're blind and
[1:51:35] they're naked you see the Blind and the
[1:51:37] naked they can't they can't really see
[1:51:40] and they're the only church between the
[1:51:42] church ages that's that started by
[1:51:43] responding back to God they're acting
[1:51:45] like if they know and if you remember
[1:51:47] earlier brother Brandon was talking
[1:51:48] about how we get so lost people nowaday
[1:51:51] they get so lost in their intellect they
[1:51:53] get so lost in their way of thinking
[1:51:55] that they want God to be some big thing
[1:51:56] and when he's not this big thing they go
[1:51:58] elsewhere see even the Israelites in
[1:52:01] their time they have failed many times
[1:52:04] whenever Israel was supposed to be
[1:52:06] sensitive to God but every single time
[1:52:08] they look at God and after they look
[1:52:10] what other people have they're like we
[1:52:13] want to be like them we want to be like
[1:52:14] them instead of being sensitive to God
[1:52:16] what God is giv them they want to be
[1:52:18] like all the thing they expect they're
[1:52:20] they want a fairy tale type of God in
[1:52:22] their life you see they wanted they
[1:52:25] wanted an imaginary God that they can
[1:52:27] that they think that can that's beyond
[1:52:29] their connection that's beyond them
[1:52:32] that's not there with them they were
[1:52:33] afraid of the word because the word came
[1:52:35] to job they were afraid of that they
[1:52:36] were afraid of God because the word of
[1:52:38] God is
[1:52:46] God
[1:52:48] now in
[1:52:51] 1954 do you know do you now believe
[1:52:54] brother Brenham says in paragraph 16 he
[1:52:56] says and one day I'll try to close you
[1:53:00] know to Wednesday night and one day
[1:53:04] there was a man came up to him he knew
[1:53:06] his name he said your name is Simon but
[1:53:10] you will be called Peter from henceforth
[1:53:13] a woman one time pressed through the
[1:53:16] crowd touched His Garment went her way
[1:53:20] back out into the crowd but Jesus had a
[1:53:23] way of knowing he looked around and saw
[1:53:26] the woman then had the blood that had
[1:53:28] the blood blood
[1:53:30] issue thy faith has saved thee that's
[1:53:33] what he did he found out the that he
[1:53:36] found out that the Father revealed to
[1:53:39] him what he wanted him to do he
[1:53:42] submitted himself himself to the father
[1:53:44] listed not to the world but he done only
[1:53:47] as the father showed him these things
[1:53:50] Jesus did then as Jesus Jesus then as
[1:53:55] Jesus of
[1:53:57] ad33 the Jesus of 1954 does the same
[1:54:01] thing for he is the resurrected one he
[1:54:05] believes he raised from the dead you
[1:54:07] believe he raised from the dead he lives
[1:54:10] tonight he isn't dead he's living right
[1:54:13] here among us tonight well then if he is
[1:54:16] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:54:19] has the hands of the church for his
[1:54:23] his
[1:54:24] eyes the eyes of the church for his and
[1:54:28] he operates through the church to prove
[1:54:30] his resurrection you see if Jes because
[1:54:34] brother brandham has had took Jesus from
[1:54:36] the 33 and after he tapped it to the
[1:54:38] 1954 and now now I want to take that Jes
[1:54:41] from 1954 and put it in 2024 you see if
[1:54:43] Jesus Christ is the same today as he was
[1:54:46] back then in brother Bam's time as he
[1:54:48] was in his own time that mean tonight
[1:54:51] and in this instance whenever when you
[1:54:53] feel that presence of God just heal
[1:54:56] yourself to that presence of God just if
[1:54:58] you had deviated away from it just
[1:55:00] reconnect yourself with that presence of
[1:55:02] God reconnecting yourself with that
[1:55:04] presence of God because God does not
[1:55:05] change the Bible says that God does not
[1:55:07] change God is Not greater or less than
[1:55:09] his word God does not change his word is
[1:55:11] absolute his word does not return to any
[1:55:13] void and if God is the same and you have
[1:55:16] that mind of God in you you have that
[1:55:17] holy spirit of God in you that mean
[1:55:20] tonight if you're sick if you feel some
[1:55:21] type of if you still some type of way
[1:55:23] you have some type of sensation that's
[1:55:25] that's holding you back that's being a
[1:55:27] stumbling block for you just pray to God
[1:55:29] just touch God and connect with God the
[1:55:31] prophet of God has said also in the
[1:55:34] fundamental he said if I come in his
[1:55:37] name and he recognize his name and Jesus
[1:55:40] said whatever you ask the father in my
[1:55:43] name that I do and then I go to the
[1:55:45] father in Jesus name it isn't me praying
[1:55:49] anymore it's Jesus it's his spirit
[1:55:52] praying through me you see and then I've
[1:55:55] got to receive what I asked for for he
[1:55:58] he said it and it's God's Own word it
[1:56:01] can't it can't do nothing else but
[1:56:04] produce just what it was you
[1:56:07] see and and led by the spirit of 1950
[1:56:12] brother Brenham says but the greatest
[1:56:14] thing I have found in Christians life is
[1:56:18] letting the Holy Spirit lead you and
[1:56:21] guide you and his work is marvelous how
[1:56:24] many how many in here he has ever been
[1:56:27] led by the spirit let's see your hand oh
[1:56:30] my what's wonderful led by the spirit of
[1:56:34] God there's no there's no there's no one
[1:56:38] would lead you to the altar but the
[1:56:41] spirit of God there's no one would bring
[1:56:44] you here tonight lest it was the spirit
[1:56:47] of God is that right he moves in
[1:56:50] mysterious ways he's want he his wonders
[1:56:54] to perform many
[1:56:56] times many times in the Le in the
[1:56:59] leading since I was a little boy Sunday
[1:57:02] a week I if we get to stay that long I
[1:57:07] wish to tell my my life story Sunday a
[1:57:09] week and the afternoon service to let
[1:57:12] you know just what what tears and blood
[1:57:15] has been along the road someone might
[1:57:18] think it's all all roses but that isn't
[1:57:21] so friend now many times the only time
[1:57:25] that I can ever be able to say anything
[1:57:28] to people about their diseases and so
[1:57:31] forth is when being definitely led by
[1:57:35] the spirit I have to let him do it if I
[1:57:39] would say something with myself within
[1:57:42] myself it would certainly be a mistake
[1:57:46] many times it confuses me when there's
[1:57:49] so many the best way when
[1:57:52] the best way when I have the patient to
[1:57:55] myself individually taking talking to
[1:57:58] them to contact them personally when
[1:58:01] it's sometimes when it's it's a mixed
[1:58:04] audience like this it's kind of hard to
[1:58:07] feel just what it is and and to know
[1:58:10] what it what it is but you have to you
[1:58:13] have to be very sensitive to the
[1:58:16] spirit now we realize and everyone knows
[1:58:21] there is a there is Spirits then if
[1:58:23] there is Spirits there is bound to be a
[1:58:26] master of that spirit because it changes
[1:58:30] the nature of Sinners into Christians
[1:58:33] and there's bound to be a master or head
[1:58:37] there somewhere and that's God and he
[1:58:40] sent his son on earth made in likeness
[1:58:44] of sinful flesh and he died that we
[1:58:47] might be redeemed and brought back to
[1:58:51] God to to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:58:54] to walk with him again that Missing Link
[1:58:58] from Garden of Eden that Adam lost
[1:59:00] Christ restored again see through Jesus
[1:59:03] Christ God has resensitized us back to
[1:59:06] himself and through the message of the
[1:59:07] hour God has brought us even closer to
[1:59:10] to
[1:59:11] himself so it's so it behooves us to be
[1:59:15] sensitive to the Holy Spirit and just
[1:59:17] hurting to him and just be in connection
[1:59:19] with him because if you're in connection
[1:59:20] with him you would be heal in all your
[1:59:22] diseases and if you're if you're fail if
[1:59:25] you're facing a trial and you know the
[1:59:27] holy spirit is there you know the holy
[1:59:29] spirit is already in the message you
[1:59:30] know God already Vindicated the message
[1:59:32] you know God already Vindicated to the
[1:59:34] pill of fire and to the to the clouds
[1:59:36] you already know that now since God is
[1:59:38] the same thing and you already know that
[1:59:39] the holy spirit is inside the message
[1:59:41] all you have to do is just be sensitive
[1:59:43] to God Al the AL the symptoms may still
[1:59:46] be there Al the symptoms may still
[1:59:48] appear in the surface just keep
[1:59:51] confessing as that lady kept confessing
[1:59:53] just kept confessing as that as that old
[1:59:55] man kept confessing and the Holy Spirit
[1:59:57] would do his
[1:59:59] thing now if the M if the musician could
[2:00:02] come
[2:00:09] forward
[2:00:11] just just keep just keep being just keep
[2:00:15] being with the word just keep being
[2:00:17] residing the word feeding on the word
[2:00:19] the more the more you dwell in the word
[2:00:21] the more sensitive you become with the
[2:00:24] word because even Moses when he went up
[2:00:26] in the mountain when he went up in the
[2:00:28] mountain he was feeding on the word when
[2:00:29] he came down his face was resonating and
[2:00:32] even his emotions were Godly emotion
[2:00:35] because when he saw Israel sinning he
[2:00:37] automatically got angry and toss it that
[2:00:39] wasn't just a human anger that was a
[2:00:41] Godly anger because he saw the deviate
[2:00:43] away from the word so just be sensitive
[2:00:45] with the word the more you resign with
[2:00:46] the word the more you'll become like
