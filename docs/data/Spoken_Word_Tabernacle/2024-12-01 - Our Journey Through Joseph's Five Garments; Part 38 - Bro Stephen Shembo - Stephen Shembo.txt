the Lord so again welcome to spoken word Tabernacle you're not a visitor We Are Family your family Big E go good to see you there if there is anybody here that I don't remember welcome to spoken word Tabernacle and anyone online the new subscriber God Rich bless you and we trust this to be a blessing amen glory to God I'm going to go through my announcement quickly I believe that we up to date with the and we reading our Bible twice a day one chapter in the morning one chapter before you go to bed if you don't I will call Brother Mickey and he will talk to you about it amen then uh we are reading our cood our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the Seal's adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen you forgive me young man I will try the best to schedule something for you I don't know if it's going to happen this year because December is almost uh booked so let's see what we will do with the deacons so December the 7th which is this coming uh Saturday it's the young Sisters Meeting we clear on that one okay and then December the 14th is the question and answer then December the 21st is merried couple part four I will try the best I'm not anticipating a question and answer you put your question in the box and as we developing the subject we are automatically answering your question this is the one time you don't put your name so you can put your question there and we will deal with it so I will see how far we will go with what we have remaining if not we might have to continue until we make sure no stone is left unturned so we don't come up with any question everything is clear because it's such a tremendous subject that need to be dealt with especially in the message of the hour so the 31st will be a Tuesday just like we have Thanksgiving on a Tuesday so Lord's willing that will be the New Year's Eve so we will have service on Tuesday the December the 31st so I will talk to the Deacon and we will give you the time it's not going to be 7:00 we will push it up because we have to go all the way to midnight but at least you heard me December the 31st that is our uh New Year's Eve so on Wednesday which is going to be January 1st we not going to give service everybody heard me so far amen I met with an elder recently uh the one uh from the Congo and uh brother kumu he didn't have a chance to preach for us but when we talked with him on the phone yesterday he said please greet the church for me so brother cumu if you hear this a thought spoken word Tabernacle that you greeted them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so can you reply so he he can hear you okay so brother Kumo whenever you hear this you just know I pass on to your message he's a he's a great a great tremendous Elder that I knew back home but I never get a chance to meet him face to face you only see him far away back home churches are really really big like 7,000 people and things like that so you far away and amen are coming from the corner so you see the preacher way small like this so by God's grace we had a chance to talk to him and to fellowship and everything went well amen amen amen amen Oh Glory to God you might I just have to explain this so at least you have an answer for this I do not have a quote for it but I did it in response to a request the way I preach preach I I usually engage my audience you already know what I'm saying so meaning when I'm talking I'm waiting for a feedback we are not Catholics where the priest have uh a certain book and the congregation doesn't have it and I praise God that he put me in the age that we can project the court so see the old church I always preach with the screen and the main thing that I want about the screen is I want to project the code so that what I read you read it with me when I talk to people I tell them bring your Bible so when I'm reading the Bible don't look at me look at the Bible so me and you we make sure we reading the same thing so when you leave this building you never use my name you say the Bible say or brother Bram say amen that's the reason so sometime when I read in question and answer in church I usually read one portion and I let you read the other one so I make sure we are all engaged because we're preaching together so sometime I can read the quot here I will read a portion and I'm expecting you to read another portion of the code amen but sometime you don't do it or sometime your voices are very low very so whoever goes back and uh listen to the sermon again my microphone goes straight in the streaming right but your voice is not really captured in the streaming that's right so if I'm reading Jesus Christ if I read Jesus it's clear on the recording right but when you say Christ it is not really clear on the so whoever is listening is missing certain portion right and because of that somebody ask a question I mean request he say brother Steven can you get the microphone to somebody yeah so that when the congregation is reading that person is representing I have to explain this so next time you know if somebody ask you where is the cat uh-uh you know why I'm doing this are we together are we together so that person usually it's brother Angelo and brother Benjamin so those person are actually representing you they're using the microphone so that your portion is heard on the tape on the recording so when you are home even if you sleeping you don't watch but you can hear the quot in it entirety because if you're driving and you're listening you cannot be watching to see exactly what you're missing so it's not that I have a coat I'm doing that so that your portion of the recording comes into the table so that we can continue to have uh like uh a continuity everything is clear of the court whether you sleeping or whether you working you put an iPad and you listen to the sermon at least brother Steven doesn't cut it off like I'm reading one and the congregation is reading one no we reading together amen so these here are your voices amen if you want to push me toward the court brother brandham sometime we ask the congregation I want you to hold amen so that the people on the tape will know that you you say something amen so the purpose that I'm doing this is just to make sure that I don't leave anything left alone because the way I preach if I read a portion I'm expecting you to read a portion so we can work together that's right amen the gift of teaching that's the way he works in my life amen amen so if you don't say amen and they say Amen in my ear I'm moving on because they are saying amen for you we clear now you got an answer now we clear now blessed be the name of the Lord that's those are certain things we need to clarify because somebody might ask a question why is why is he doing this or this or this no no no no this that's the reason why we're doing that we clear so far and I'm going to explain the second thing because I felt it pressing into me amen amen in the message the word Bishop is in the Bible the word Bishop is in the Bible the word Bishop is in the message but the way it's applied this is where the problem is would you give me some time so do me a favor technician keep dislike on a Tik Tok yeah H so whenever in the future somebody ask you a question just give them the link this is where our pastor responded to this are we together can I say it okay what does a bishop mean in this message when we say Bishop it means what it means what amen I'm going to use an example in this church brother Charles thir he's back there he he start preaching in this church are we together brother Ben start preaching in this church brother de M start preaching in this church and they will begin to grow in their Ministries and Lord's willing later on they might be invited to a church or a conference or overseas and they will be going back and forth and preaching and if the Lord Terry I don't know maybe one of them may end up being a pastor somewhere amen for those three I'm just using those three so you understand so it's very very easy because we also have brother poop and brother uh Glen Kelly I'm not ignoring them I just want to nail the devil everywhere amen I'm just using the the younger on so you understand what I'm trying to say so if so as they grow according to the message I am their Bishop that's right that's right in other word they were birth under the ministry of God that he plac in my life whoever is in the sister church and that start preaching in that sister church that Pastor is their Bishop but that Bishop is not a Catholic bishop it just means that they were birth under my Ministry they can consult me if they have any question but if they don't have any question they don't need to consult me if they Pastor somewhere I can have go to their church and begin to pressurize or control their church that's Catholicism come on now if brother Benjamin ending up somewhere being a pastor he's completely Sovereign I don't know if you okay so whatever the holy spirit will put in his heart he will preach it with full freedom I don't know if that's okay without worrying that if I say this maybe brother Steven won't like it no as long as he sees that in the Bible and in the message where the brother Steven doesn't see it yet he is free to preach it the way the Holy Spirit show him and then me and him keep Fellowship that is what a bishop mean but when a bishop begin to have control over the churches that's naden that's what the message condemn amen amen the one from whom I left amen left the message so I don't have a bishop are we together now the one who was supposed to be my Bishop left the message so I do not have a bishop but I have elders [Applause] that preach the message before me and I can consult those Elders when I have question not any Elders those that are strictly on the word it is My Prerogative to choose who I'm going to consult because some of them are not on the word but they are Elder I will respect them as Elder but when they come to the word of God I'm not going to deal with them are we together but there are Elders that are in the word those Elder when we have question we can reach out to them and say brother I have a question how did you solve this thing how did you see this and we Fellowship together are we together but I don't believe on the Elder that put a pressure on me I don't believe that I have somebody or a move or a click or a group going on in a message that before I preach something I need to make sure I line up with them this is why we in the trouble that we are because there is no Freedom amen I am not preaching what I'm preaching con I mean in line with an elder no in line with the message as long as it's in the message it's in the Bible then we can preach it so when I say I do not have a bishop it is not proud but I seen churches being abused by Elders I've been in this message for a while and I never want it to happen in this church never am clear I was an assistant dentist before and I seen how dentist uh some of them amen were abusing the stuff when they come they yelling they say this and I made a decision I say if I ever become a dentist a doctor I would never treat my staff like that and go to my office and ask my staff right there I don't even talk to them much I'm in my office because I'm looking at my coat and my stuff when they call me I go pull a tooth and go back and continue with my coat that's way I in other word as long as you keep what you're supposed to do me and you will never talk and ask them I increase their salary without even a meeting or them asking me they just see oh thank you very much they that's it I don't have time for meeting meeting meeting me too much headache that's the same way I made the decision for this church never somebody to abuse this church because we were hurt from where we came out am so made my decision to make sure you are respected you are honored you are cherished and you are treated well even if somebody come on the poopet when they talk to you they need to know how they're talking to you amen so when I say I don't have a bishop this is what I meant amen I'm not saying I don't have brothers or I'm independent I'm independent as far as has Clicks in the message I cannot get into any clicks I refuse [Applause] clicks so if you know there is a click of preacher where they have convention only certain preachers are preaching there me I'm not there but I can shake hand I can fellowship with them but I'm not going to get in any move Ministry the ters this move this hey I don't want to get into that I want to stay with the word and with the message of the hour but I can fellowship with everyone as long as they stay in the word are we together are we together so and don't disrespect anyone I'm just making a point that when I'm speaking I'm speaking freely and every church is Sovereign so please sistera do me a little clip tick Tok and keep it aside so that when somebody ask a question or something this is where I'm coming from amen because usually people will stay there PhD on looking for trouble

Kingdom but Lord I Thank you for your wisdom because Lord father as we spoke and we declare and we are declaring again this morning I am not the one who started this church I am not the one pastoring this church I'm only here in the office representing you but you are the one that is the great Shepherd and you are the owner of this church Lord father Lord we are committing this service unto that hand Lord may you move me completely out and move the audience out so that you can be the one preaching and the one hearing and interpreting and re and and uh and revealing your word to your children

travel we meet them Lord father and I know that one of these day we will meet all together at the feet of Jesus Christ we commit it all and ask it in Jesus precious name amen amen glory to God now you can turn your clock on we okay now amen glory to God Psalm 82 verse 1 a Psalm of aav God stands in the congregation of the mighty you might be seated he God judges among the gods now these scripture are more clear to you than ever amen then when we jum in verse six the Bible say I have said who's talking there God it's important to know that it's God talking that's right amen because when something come out from the mouth of God it's very special yes sir the Bible says I have said that ye are Gods amen so God says that you are God's so it's not me let every man's word be a lie but his word only be the truth so whether you believe it or not I believe that I'm a God Amen we clear amen and all of you all amen amen why can you look at somebody you looking at the congregation and you say you are God who am I talking to I'm talking to the congregation I'm talking to everybody that is here I say you are God am then I come back again and I say all of you so meaning maybe somebody in the congregation doesn't really think he is did I miss you me started again when I'm preaching I'm preaching to who everybody that is here if you somewhere on the street then I'm not preaching to you that's so when I come and say good evening spoken word or good morning spoken word I'm talking to all of you but when I turn around and I say all of you good morning it means I want to make sure that everybody that is present is included because there could be somebody struggling and say wait a minute me a God I don't know me can I really be a God so God knows us better than our and God knowing that he said all of you to make sure you don't come up again with a question because somebody may come out and say do you know what brother Steven was talking about he was talking about me amen because I talked with brother Steven yesterday so because me and brother Steven were talking yesterday so when he said that he's talking about me but I was also there we all heard amen so God remove that that that uh option sir so that no one can say that uhuh he was talking about myself no if you come you say brother Steven you were talking about me I was say m I say all of you that's right God were you talking about uh so and so no no no no God say all of you are children of the most high so there is no exception here amen are we together so remove your complexes of what you think you are not that's right this is the problem with Gideon in the Bible when God look at him he said Mighty Man of Valor and he's looking at God like who me of course do you think God made a mistake God sees beyond what you can see God sees what he did in your life before you even know it before you are even aware of who you are God already knows you and God say that all of you are children of the most high God why is this important brother Steven why do you always keep repeating this subject for three month amen the Bible says in 1 John chapter 3 verse 1 behold behold what what manner of what love who the father father means he got children amen yes sir what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that which should be called the what the sons of God so when you are called a Son of God it is an expression of love amen and not just any kind of love but it's a supreme in other word what manner of love what greatest love have God expressed to us amen by dying at the cross of course that was love but John here is saying by you being called a Son of God so when God's call you a son of God God is actually expressing his greatest love upon you the Bible says what manner of love the father has bestow upon us that we should be called The Who The Son of God therefore the world knoweth as not so this identity here don't expect the world to know it no sir the world will know it by manifestation amen amen you will know it by Revelation am and when your Revelation become flesh become a life in you then the people of the world will see a television amen they will begin to watch the movie of God Amen a human being being God Amen are we together therefore the world know us not because because he knew him what not amen the beig god they didn't know him amen when Peter knew him he said Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you so you only know him by Revelation amen amen amen listen to what brother Bram says here brother Bram say in the message God's power to transform he says now we can Fellowship was through the riches of his word and in which you are a part of when we say a part of everybody love it because he means I'm a little portion of the word brother Bram say you are part of the word everybody will say Amen because he was the word at the beginning you are the word now h do you see do you see where the problem is in the beginning he was the word but now not in the beginning now you are the [Applause] word me the word me the word yeah the word was a man called Jesus Christ he was the word when you see Jesus Christ you see the word word of God in full manifestation the word eating the word sleeping the word being hungry the word walking on foot do you see what the word is now and brother Bram say see I'm preaching tonight or Sunday or one of the days when I get in about what the word is in other word one of these day I will really explain you what the word is amen and now you are a part of the word listen there is one thing I can do I can't brag on my ancestors amen because we got two records my friend amen there is a Divine record amen and there is also a natural or an Earthly record amen this is the one we we emphasize all the time these records are your identity because it goes with your nationality amen this one is only one this one can be Africa America Europe whatever it is amen and brother Bram say he doesn't brag on the second one he said I can't brag on my S no I come through enough full mess that's why when they say you are God not me God don't come in a message like this God must be born in a hospital but God was born in a manger and you were born in a hospital if God can be born in a manger if the big God can be born in the manger and be powerful what about the God that is born in the hospital the one in the m is already powerful what about the one in the hospital you have not caught it yet my friend he says my father was an Irish man natural record my mother was an Indian Squad half Indian her mother was Indian draw a pension now all of them drunk most of all of them die with their shoes on fighting grandfather and so forth amen I can't brag on nothing about that because my ancestors and my family tree is how terrible but brother there is one thing I can brag on amen amen I can brag on my Lord Jesus who has redeemed me amen and with his what transforming power Ed a seed by how predestination and I saw it whose son I am now now you are sons of the most high God amen amen amen in other word do not linger on your natural record do not waste your time looking at your natural record God revealed to you that you existed before measure on that record over there and leave this here alone yes sir sir never let this record here block the other record that is going on there amen amen because this one God will dispatch you in every nation but God will come to rescue you wherever you are the Bible says in John 11 verse 49 and one of them named chaas being the high priest that same year say unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole what nation that nation was Israel that the whole nation perish not and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesies that Jesus should die for that Nation Israel the Bible continue and not for that Nation only why because God has his children scattered in many Nation that's why the Bible say out of every nation and Kindred and tongue God is pulling his brother in other word God took us as seed and Scatter us all over the world and God knows where you are and who is who at the appointed time God will send a messenger and begin to pick his children wherever they are and we become a bouquet Amen in the hand of God this one from America this one from Africa this one from Ghana this one from uh Jamaica this one from Trinidad all of you are children of the most high god listen he say and not for that Nation only but that also he God should gather together in one so there is a one come on brother and we need to be gathered in the one amen I don't know if you get that one that's why the Bible say one sat on the throne the Bible never said one man sat on the throne you know that right do you know that do you know that the bible say that when John went into heaven he s he saw one sat on the throne the Bible never say he saw one man we watch too much movie my friend amen when we Jo when when when when you go online they will show you an older man with a big beard and they say that is God sitting on the throne the Bible didn't say that the Bible say one sat on the throne and the Bible say here we will be gathered all in one that's why the Bible say you will sit on the throne with him how can all of us sit on one Throne we need to go back to one when Jesus is in the one and all of us in one one will sit on the throne it are we together this is one that's right amen this is the one that sat on the throne amen this is Brother kayy this is Brother John this is brother Greg this is brother Michael Omar uh this is Brother patient amen when we are outside we are individuals are we together but if you you cross this and you put it here Amen brother Michael is now one are we together and then you cross one you put him here and you cross six you put him here and you cross this you put it here and you cross this and then you put it here then we are gathered in one now God take one and put him on the throne are we together because husband and wife are Jesus and you are Jesus and his bride are so when the bride is United back to the husband they become and God take one and put one on the [Applause] throne you are looking at a big Throne where everybody will sit and we say push a little bit then this one say that's not the Throne of God Throne is something else one of this day we will preach about what is that throne but but the main thing is be G in Christ get in the one when you get in the one then you are guaranteed the Throne of God are we together and this one here is God that's right so when you enter there and no one can enter into God and blend with God if you are not made of the same material that's why brother Bram say you are the word because in the beginning he was the word your material are compatible amen that's why you can blend together and no one can make the difference who is Jesus and who's not Jesus amen are we together amen and not only for that Nation on but that also he should Gather in one what the children of God that were how scattered abroad that's why Jesus say I have sheep that are not of this fold brother Bram say he was talking to the Jews but there were other sheep that were from somewhere else so God need to gather everybody and put the children of God in one when the children of God are in one they are one amen now one can s can go and sit on the throne that's right ye are Gods all of you are children of the most high god let's go to Luke 15 amen we are so embedded in humanity that's why it's hard to begin to accept Divine language amen amen but what you forget God gave us the best example he came himself and live in flesh to show you that God can be hungry for you according to the movie the the Greek mythology a God doesn't die God doesn't eat a God have different liquid God say that's myology I'm coming in human flesh give me a fish according to you God should be sitting and say fish and then a fish is created H steak and then the steak is created M God come and say are you cooking who's cooking uh uh uh Peter's mother-in-law and God sit down and waiting for food the waiting for food doesn't change him from being God [Laughter] do you see what I'm saying in other word God is not what you thinking that's right but at a certain time that God can be coming into a river and forget and just keep walking on the river then we the one he's walking on oh no he's he's unconscious he's God and sometime he get in the boat sometime he get in boat sometime he get a flight ticket sometime Philip baptize somebody and he doesn't need aort and Philip is gone and you see him in [Applause] Minnesota and you tell you say Philip are you s and half yes are you a human being yes how did you go there I don't know I'm God I don't know if you're getting what God is it is not what you think God is even if we go to the Rapture do you know that we will come back on this Earth do you know that brother Bram say we were not meant to leave over there we will come back here and Jesus will come back here and we will live here forever [Applause] amen so remember you will be just like this forever and you won't die you won't grow old you won't be sick again and you will remain like that and you will eat Jesus resurrected with a glorified body and he took fishes an AEG [Applause] do you see what I'm saying do you see what I'm saying that's why God said yeah are God you are waiting to be flying in the air and say now I'm a God no no no the way you are you are God sometime you will cry God cried Jesus cried it is written in the Bible Jesus Christ it's written in the Bible but one day you won't cry you will stand and say who is disturbing me move from there and that thing will obey it is the life of a God in human [Applause] flesh do you understand what it is do you understand what it is hallelujah what do you need healing if you don't get sick amen amen but when a god wake up in the morning the show them I be heard him and a God will say and after a while that God will go like hey feel good in Jesus name then the shoulder becomes good that makes you God let me preach what I have to preach amen amen amen amen that pain was an opportunity to draw from another [Applause] source are we together how many times have you lost something and you just whisper prayer and then right there amen and and because there was a time you were worried and suddenly something say why you why why why didn't you pray and then you say help me find it then somehow boom it's a life of a [Applause] God and brother Bram said Jesus could even marry and have children a have quat married people you know amen a have coat that's what brother brandham says am amen so a God can [Applause] marry brother Glenn remind me so I can send this quote on the group chat amen a God can marry and have children but it doesn't change the fact that he is God the message is simple my friend the life you living doesn't change who you are that's what I'm trying to say the trial you going through that has en change who you [Applause] are one of this day it will be the [Applause] end are we together are we together now let's go to our s this morning Luke 15 Lord sometime in this message we think we understand the message but we don't that's right we have our own image amen so we will be waiting and then you begin to fly and then and and and and and we're thinking our own stuff and and and and and brother brandham say heaven is here what are you going to do now so where is Heaven you see now you see now so we need to change our conception that's right and to really grasp the mind of God amen amen God knew that evil will fall why did he make him fall brother Bram explain to us because God had attribute and he want his attribute to be made what so for the attribute to be made manifested they must be a mess that's right that's right amen I'm trying to preach what I'm trying to preach so for your attribute of God to be manifested in your life they must be some [Applause] message then you going to rise above the message then when you rise above the message then somebody will say that must be God because only God can rise above the message like that brother Bram say oh his brother dad with shoes on the feet and everything and in the midst of that kind of mess Jo the biggest Prophet from Enoch all the way here in the midst of a [Applause] mess it's like a that is born in a mess born in a mess amen so the mess is off your family don't worry about it the mes of your father my father was divorced M hey don't worry about those mes you focus on what is in you you going to rise up as a different species different than your father different than your [Applause] mother brother Bram was born in a family of drunk how much alcohol got in the mouth of brother Bram who was blocking the alcohol who was doing that when brother Bram was converted no when he was a sinner but God was blocking alcohol there are certain things that won't enter you my friend my friend my friend relax in your life remove the high blood pressure remove the anxiety remove the depression all is well the mess that you are born of it don't worry brother CH if you are born and when you are born you already a millionaire do you really enjoy that money you don't really know because you born with money you born with money you born with money you born with money you don't even know really what money is because this is what you were born with but if you are born Brook very poor the day God will bless you you will enjoy it [Applause] better because when you see a steak you say this was I was longing for now you know what to how to Value things are we together are we together you beautiful God say uh-uh lock the husband because according to you this will work when this work he knocks the husband you come ah banquet zero you got a zero God is working God is working God is working he say put confidence in me when you put confidence in me you are still beautiful very beautiful then God will turn it on then when you will get the husband you know how you going to appreciate the husband you want to even hold him tight because you know what you went through you will appreciate that woman because you know how you suffer that's right that's right messes are not a problem Lord I don't know if I'm going to preach when God created the world how was the world yeah oh oh no no no no no no no God created the Garden of Eden God created what a mess Darkness upon the face of the de why didn't God just created the Garden of Eden because that Darkness give him work then the Bible say then the spirit of the Lord in other word God after he created the mess God enter in and he put gloves he said now let there be let there be let and me and you were clapping hand we said Daddy keep going keep going because God is transforming the messes into a Garden of Eden your mer is his [Applause] opportunity are we together are we together oh my God God creating a mess why for amen why for why who block all he who made who made sure that all the hospital are booked who did it because when when he wanted to get Jerusalem he provided himself a donkey Isaiah already spoke about but when he want to be born he made sure all the pregnant women goes to the delivery room there is no more room for himself then he born in the middle of a man power but that's [Applause] God Jesus how can he provide man and he cannot provide a place for himself to be [Applause] born are we together so where you are born doesn't determine who you are the condition you were born doesn't determine who you are Joseph was a widow so the parent you are born and doesn't determine who you are you are God's son let's go to Luke 15 I don't know who that one was for amen change your conception of what God is yes God is not a figment of imagination amen amen amen that's why you stay all night you cannot sleep because you created your own religion that's with the preaching that has been going on amen amen amen learn to go to bed and sleep like a baby hallu because he taught me sufficient of the day unto the day so why should I worry Why Should I Worry why amen amen I have what to preach so who's preaching all of this H did I prepare that my copies are here so when I come to preach I do the best that I can and I and I sit down and I put my my car in neutral and he take over that's right amen okay let's go to Luke 15 my friend verse 11 and he said amen a certain man has how many sons two sons we know who they are amen yes the Elder son is who the Jew the Jews or Israel you need to stay tight we might go through some Avenue the younger one is who Gentile is the Gentile thank you my brother which is the Bride of Jesus Christ we clear on that one the Bible says and the younger one of them said to his father father give me the portion of good that fall to me and he divided to them his living and not so many days after the younger son has gather uh the younger son gather all together and took his journey into what a far country a far country stay touch my friend a far country amen and there wasted his substance with riers living you know what it means jump now to verse uh 20 and he arose you know what is going on we saving time and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father did what saw him now follow me carefully my friend let me put that drawing and see what the Lord will do today amen glory to God this is our drawing my friend maybe a Lo of farm right here amen amen uh maybe a tree somewhere in the back there there is a road there and there is a road here the son is right here the father is right here we clear right and there is a distance right here he was great Far Far Away amen great way off that's what the Bible says and then the father gave all options here we clear yes amen the Bible says in verse 21 and the son says to Him Father I have Sinn against Heaven the Zeal of the age and in your sight I'm no more worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servant bring forth the best robe you understand what it means and put on him amen and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet we went through all of this and bring here the fatted CF and do what kill it so the food was not ready yet we clear on that one put your seat belt my friend amen and let us eat and be how merried why for this my son was dead is now how alive again alive again he was lost and is what found and they began to be how married so this party here that is going on here concern the people that were dead you remember that Sunday and now they are what so it concerned the sleeping scent that's right amen those that were under corruption but when they raised they raised with incorruption and those that were lost and they were found which is the Living Center amen because Paul say we shall not all die so some will stay alive and some will be dead but at the end of the day all of them will be Chang and the last Trump so it's a feast of the Redeemer that's right amen a feast of those that went in the Rapture and the one who goes in the rapture is the Brad which is the younger son right are we together and we notice that the the the the instruction was given here but there is a time of preparation amen because brother Bram said there are three things let's pick up now he says one of them is the shout he said the first things that come forth is his message calling the bride how the next is the resurrection of the sleeping bride that's why he said those that was dead and I alive the one die back in the other ages they are caught up how together and the trumpet the feast in the what heaven where in the sky in the sky so the first the last thing that is remain is for all of them to go back in the house are we together together and have a feast in the house that's right amen so in between this time the killing and and the cooking and everything with sister p and sister Lael and sistera all the preparation of those things by the time we get there the fist began but if you notice the Bible says that and then they begin to make Merry that's right so the Bible doesn't tell us the exact time that's right that the feast started amen we know that there will be a feast we know that we need to kill the fatted Cal we need to cook it and everything but as far as when is the time that the F started the Bible doesn't say it because Jesus himself said that the father only knows it nobody knows the hour only the father knows it so right here the still hold that coming that's right brother that's right are we together are we together are we together now the important things is when everything is going on until the party start or the feast started are we together the Elder son is completely not there that's right he's not at home he's not right here he's not in the house and even when the part is started he's not even there are we together he's completely absent so what happened let's pick up now let's go to Matthew 21 now we getting there if you there you can say amen hallelujah father help me so we can get to this let's see where we are we are good amen amen Matthew 21 verse 23 if you there you can say Amen the Bible says amen and Jesus uh and when he come into the temple The Who Chief priest the chief priest you remember that one right the chief priest and who the Elders of the temple and the Elders of of the people and the Elder of the people amen the chief priest and the Elder of the people came to him as he was teaching and say by what Authority do you these things and who gave you this Authority you understand who's asking the question jump to verse 33 we getting good my friend verse 33 and here in another Parable there was a certain householder which means a farmer or a Vine grower which planted a Vineyard and he did what hedged it round about follow me carefully he hedg it there was a hedge or a fence and what else my friend and dig the wine press and there was a wine press that was dug there continue and what else and built a tower and built a tower and what else and let it out to husband men and he rented or Leist it to other husband men Amen to husband men and went where into a far country notice it's another far country we clear we clear amen we okay now right we found out that what the vineyard was was Israel you remember that Lord help me all right in Isaiah 5 the Bible says now I will sing to my who well beloved a song of my beloved so this person here is well beloved and he's also called beloved please follow me this person here is called well beloved follow me carefully please and he's also called what beloved it's the same person asaiah is singing to him he says he my beloved touching what his Vineyard so the owner of the vineyard according to Isaiah is the well beloved follow me carefully the owner of this Vineyard is the well beloved or the Beloved right the Beloved is the owner you going to see how scripture work together amen my beloved has a Vineyard he's the owner in a very fruitful Hill and he did what f it do you see what Jesus was talking about yeah and GA out the stone thereof and did what planted it do you see what Jesus was talking about yes with the choice van and built a what a tower you see that yes and in the midst of it and also made a what a wine press there you see that so all characteristic of Jesus Christ came from Isaiah amen and he looked that he should bring forth grape and he brought forth what wild grapes for the vineyard of the Lord of host is who the house of Israel so this Vineyard is the house of Israel are we clear now the Lord planted hedged fence it built a wine PR and heav thing and and a tower in it we clear now jum now where we are in verse 34 and then and when the time of what the fruit Drew near he sent his servant to the what the husbandman so the servant don't come at any time that's right the servant only come at the time of the fruit follow me carefully let me read it again let's go slowly verse 34 and when the time of the fruit Drew n in other word the Harvest was closer that's when the servant he sent his servant to the husband man that he they might receive the what the fruits of it so God won't send his servant if the time of the fruit is not closer that's right amen amen let's go slowly amen amen there is a farm amen amen in the farm we got crops amen as crops are growing and everything God is quiet yes amen when he comes when they begin to B God is quiet when the fruit begin to form amen that is the time God sent a messenger so when you see a messenger appearing [Applause] it is an indication that there is some fruit there I don't know if we together because God cannot send his word void his word cannot return to him void when he s his word his word has a purpose and his word goes with his servant the prophet amen so when a prophet appear on the scene it is the Harvest time are we together it is the time of the fruit in other word Ali won't come if there is no Rebecca when Ali begin to move it's because Rebecca is Right amen because Rebecca is ready for marriage that's why is is moving I will send you Elijah the Prophet Elijah won't come if I'm not [Applause] there because Elijah came and brother Steven must be there to receive the Elijah amen William Marion Branham in the message birth pen brother Bram say I know there be somebody where somewhere would do what would believe God would not send a message unless there be somebody to do what receive [Applause] it so this message is not for [Applause] everybody those that receive the message are the fruits of God are we together are we together are we together remember the shout come to GA and the servant are coming to GA to gather the fruit so when you hear the message and you receive the message you are actually a [Applause] fruit I know when I say fruit when I say fruit you you in your mind you have love peace longsuffering don't worry we will get to what the fruit is amen a fruit is somebody a fruit is an individual a fruit is a person you are the fruit of your mother you are the fruit of your mother and your father so God knows that this time I got sister charene there this time I got brother Loos there when they are already sent the messenger and when the messenger came somebody is already there a Rea is already there that will be also moved toward the for some reason she came alone why did she came alone and nobody was there because God was looking for one her mother didn't go with her her brother didn't go with her her uncle didn't go with her her father didn't go with her so sometime you be the only one from a [Applause] family are we together are we together are we together glory to God the Bible says in verse 34 when the time of the fruit junai he sent his what servants plural amen do the husband man that they might receive the what the fruits of it 3 five and the husband took the servant and did what and beat one they took the servant and beat one and what else and killed another so there is some killing going on and what else and stoned another and stoned another it's beat killing and stoning keep those word amen beat killing and stoning again he sent are the what servants more than the first and the did to them likewise in other words they did the same thing beat Stone and kill are we together are we together amen verse 37 but what last of all he sent unto them his son so the son was there the son when he was sending the servant the son was there when he sent the servant again the son was there but the son was the last resource in other words the son was the last messenger I'm going slowly my friend sir amen so when God deal with a dispensation he will first send servant servant servant servant servant when the dispensation is about to be finished the one who come won't be a servant it will be the son I don't know if we are together at the beginning you will receive a servant at the beginning a servant after while a servant but when the dispensation is end only the son will come the S will come not anyone else so when you see the son just know the dispensation is at end are we together are we together are we together yes sir are we together the last messenger I'm going with this Parable then we're going to take this Parable and go back to the Elder son if you give me time amen so the last messenger amen he always who the son amen amen let's continue with this son the Bible say and last of all this is what the Bible say he sent to them who his son how many son One Singular saying they will receive who they will reverence my son but when the husband man saw the son from a far off like Joseph brother when they saw him from a far off they begin to conspire you remember when they saw the son they said among themselves this is who the air stop so the son that come is the air yes sir yes sir am are we together the last messenger is the Son and that son is the air amen we need to know who is this son are we together but before the son come there will be servant and those servant will be stoned beaten and killed who are the servant are we together the Bible says in Matthew 23 verse 34 wherefore behold I said unto you who prophets and what and wise men and what and scribes and some of them you shall do what kill and crucify and some of them you shall do what scorge in your synagogues and persecute them from what city to city oh Jerusalem Jerusalem die follow me carefully beaing killing and what stoning th that do what killest the prophet and do what stonest them which are sent unto thee you see Killing and stoning you kill the prophet and stone them which are sent unto thee how often would I have what gathered thy children together even as a hand gathereth her chicken under her wings but what and you would not so it is the behavior of the Jew come on brother to kill and to Stone prophets amen so this sent our prophets I have just read it my friend you who kill what the prophet and do what and stone it them and and stone who them that are what so who is sent who is killed who is Stone Propet the prophets so the servants the servants amen are the prophet in the day days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sign all the mysteries of God should be finished as he has declared to his servant the prophet and now you begin to understand amen so God was sending Prophet to Israel and Israel was killing the prophet and then at last God send his son right let's see but this the owner of this Vineyard is God but Isaiah called the owner his well beloved and asaiah call him what the Beloved the Bible says this amen amen when we read in Luke 20 the Bible said then say the lord of the vineard what shall I do I will send my who beloved Son same amen amen but this beloved Son According To Jesus he's a of all things but according to Isaiah he's the owner Isaiah say my beloved my well beloved on a Vineyard Jesus say the Beloved is the son Isaiah said uhuh the Beloved is the honor Jesus say the Beloved is the son of the H are we together let me help you with this the Bible says in Mark 12 and again he said another and him they did what same Parable and many other doing what beating some and killing some having yet therefore how many son one son so this son is only one begotten right are we together the son is the only begotten of the father amen he is what well beloved Jesus say the son is well Beloved the son is the Beloved and Isaiah say the Beloved and the well beloved is the honor that's right in other word me and my father We Are One in word the son was only the father in another form are we together now are we together so the Son and the father are one Hallelujah are we together because God doesn't share his glory with somebody else he keepeth his glory with someone himself but Jesus was full of the glory of the father and Jesus said the glory that I have I give it to you but God doesn't share his glory with anyone hallu you didn't get it God say his glory he doesn't share with somebody but Jesus said the glory that I have me God I give it to [Applause] you you didn't get me again let me start it again the B say God doesn't share his glory with anyone God keep his glory to himself but Jesus said the glory that I have I also give it to you so who are you who are you in other word when God give you his glory it is like he kept his glory to himself it looks like his glory didn't move it is still in God so you are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God are we together are we together are we together you need to understand that's right this belong only to Mar let me leave be on my friend amen amen amen usually I drink my water like this for some reason but I can also drink like this when I did this it's finished when I did this why the Char can drink it by sanitation it didn't touch my lips I can share with brother Tony but when I do this you know who qualify [Applause] none of you qualify there is only one person that can take this water and put the mouth right here and it's still the same so my glory give it to you you are the only one that can kiss the glory of [Applause] God Hall oh my God are we together are we together the the remaining married couple will get that are we together and then they say having yet therefore how many son one son who his well beloved he sent him also last time to them saying they will receive re they will they will reverence my son but those have men say among themselves this is the air come let us do what kill him and The Inheritance shall be who ours are we clear let's go back to our scripture father help me as I'm navigating this amen amen jum to verse uh 39 and they caught him and did what cast him out of the vineyard and did what and slew him so they slew him outside of the vineyard that's why the Bible say Jesus suffer outside the gate you remember that amen and when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what he what he what will he do to those husband they say to him he will miserably do what destroy those wicked men and we let out his Vineyard to add husband men so there are two groups of husband men that's right the first group will be destroyed and the vineyard or The Inheritance will go toward a c other group follow me carefully amen that shall be which shall render him the fruits when in their Seasons so when The Inheritance goes to other fer those farmer have seasons amen amen and God will begin to send messenger again to collect the season of the new company they sold the first company unto a new company and hire new people to receive new fruits amen are we together are we together are we together jum to verse 43 therefore say I unto you the king om of God so the vineyard now means what the kingdom of God shall be taken from you follow me now carefully and give to a nation ah the kingdom will leave Israel and give to a nation watch that nation is singular that's right amen yes sir it is one nation will be given to a nation and amen One Nation to a nation amen they will give that Nation the kingdom of God and what happened my friend it will be given to a nation bringing forth the what fruits thereof so there will be a nation that will begin to bring fruit in it season amen amen jum to verse 45 and when the chief priest and the who Pharisees and the Pharisee have heard his Parable they perceived that he spoke of them so they understood that Jesus was talking about them that they're going to kill him and after the death of Jesus Christ The Gospel will leave the Jew that's right amen and go to the Gentile do you follow me but remember the PN is first messenger first servant and the last one is the son the son is the one that closes the dispensation are we together so the Jews will have a dispensation and the end of that dispensation will be God will reveal himself in human flesh and do the Messi son and he will be rejected and he will be be crucified and then rejected then the gospel goes to the Gentile and the Gentile will also begin to receive messenger so how do we know that the Gentile dispensation is finished look what God did the first time he's the same today and forever when you see the son revealing again in human flesh amen doing the Messi son it is telling you the gentle dispensation is also finished now the gospel need to go back [Applause] again are we together are we together God doesn't deal with the two husband men group together he doesn't deal with the youngest son and the Elder together when he deal with one one is out of the picture are we together where are you coming from with this brother Bram says this we could bring it down through the Old Testament and through the seven Church ages for the seventh stroke and so forth that looking through those streaks of blood the seven different streaks represented what seven Church ages Israel how natural and the Gentile how church in spiritual seven Church ages just exactly how the same way Israel had seven churches wow no problem let me read Bon again in the pmos vision now notice also the days of who Elijah when they had rejected Elijah as a prophet the leader thread the ancient church one of these days I shall bring it up and show you that Israel had what seven Church ages two and tap exactly with this amen so Israel has seven Church ages we okay now the Gentile have seven Church ages and the end of the seven Church ages is only when the sun come that's right this is why Paul says this in Hebrew he said God who s and D Man speak in the PTO Our Father by who the Prophet The Prophet has in these last days spoken unto us by his who son who he has appointed what heir of all things the son is the air of all things the son is the air of all thingsall so when Paul was talking Paul says we had Church ages and God was sending us Prophet but the last day of the Jews God sent his own son who was aeir of all things and him they crucify him are we together and reject him and the gospel mov completely into the who the genti listen to this my friend the Bible says this he said which of the Prophet have not you father do what persecuted and they have slain them with show before of the coming forth of who the just one of whom you be now the what betrayers and murderers amen so when they destroy the son they crucify him the Gentile the gospel left the Jews follow me carefully and it's given to the Gentile and when it's given to the genti God says that he will give to the Gen as a nation listen to what Peter says here he says but ye are a what a chosen generation a what a royal priesthood a what and holy nation you think he's talking about the Jews let's read it he said a what a peculiar people that you should suffer the what the Praises of him who who has called you out of what Darkness into what his marvelous life which in time pass you are not a people we were not the people of God the people of God was the Jews but God transferred The Inheritance the kingdom into a nation are we together are we together which in time pass we were not the people but are now the what people the people of God which has not obtained what Mercy but now has obtained what mercy so God as he did to the Jews begin to S PA arus col Martin Martin Luther John Wesley then William Mar Bram to get the fruit in Du season are we together what does the fruit means brother Steven brother Bram say Amen but it's what they produce that tell you what Difference by what their fruits Jesus say what you shall know them man does not gather grapes off of a what a thisle even though the te will be right in the m in the in the grape vine that could be possible but the fruit will do what what is the fruit it is what the word and God say he the word now you remember the beginning do you remember the quot at the beginning brother Bram said now you are the word amen you say I'm not the word the predestinated seed was in you and the predestinated seed was the message that's the reason why you receive the [Applause] message Hallelujah the predestinated seed is the message of your day that is placing you amen and he has a hook amen do you follow me and in due time the prophet of that age come with a message that have a hook and the two message will find one another and they will hook one another that's why you cannot leave this [Applause] [Music] message now you are the word you are the message of the hour the message is no longer in books [Applause] s sister why you don't wear earring because of the message why are you wearing long dresses so when I see you who are you who are [Applause] you one time you read it now you don't read you don't read you became what you were reading so the message is you when you walking it's you you are glowing the [Applause] message when people see you they already seen the message they already seen the caliber of women that the message can [Applause] produce and to find that spe you got to be in the message I don't know if we together are we together are we together oh my god brother say what is the fruit it's what the fruit for what because Jesus said Gather me the fruit for what SE the word Jesus is coming to pick himself the magnet only attract what he [Applause] can if you put a piece of wood the magnet will go over it but when he found the metal because there is something about the medal that that goes with the magnet Hallelujah he says what is the fruit it's what the word for the season that is what it is the what teaching the teaching of what the teaching of what the season what time it is man Doctrine denominational Doctrine all God's word for what the season amen so when brother Bram come with the message is to pull the fruits Foria to God because this is the gentle
