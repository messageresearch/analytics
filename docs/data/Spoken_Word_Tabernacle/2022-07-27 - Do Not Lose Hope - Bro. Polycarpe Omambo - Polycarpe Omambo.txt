you're a family member amen god richly bless you it was a great pleasure to meet you thank you brother mike is he staying here longer if he's staying till sunday we need to put a special for him again on sunday amen brother john come and burn the house and then he come and finish it up amen oh my god it is wonderful it is all over and it's the second oil this soil is different it is no lap for you to come to church and when you are in church you forget about everything you begin to feel good even if you are sick you begin to feel very good and before you know it by the time the service is over you feel healed not let's go to church and you're dragging let's go to church you are happy when you get here right away you under the anointing oh my god blessed be the name of the lord if somebody's behind with the last part you need to catch up quickly before we climb higher large wheeling on sunday amen i try to stay on the edge of the trail of the serpent i cannot dig deep i have to stay on the surface so we can keep roof in plain view if we dig then if brother branham can preach a sermon four hours whatever i'm going to take it would take a year amen brother branham said he took one he can take one sales and preach three months and then he preach one seal in one night so what do you think is under that hill and when we preach part one part two people don't understand it was a concentrated food so what you think it was one tape it's not one tip it is three months of sermon amen preaching one day in other words when you touch the surface it's unfold it's a sermon it's a sermon it's a servant it's a sermon how many if one seal is three months and i don't know what he meant by three-month weather it's only wednesday and sunday or it was monday tuesday wednesday thursday all the way to sunday so it's like 90 days how many sermons can come up of these hills that's why you keep seeing me traveling sales sales because it's all over the entire book was sealed by seven sales so if brother branham can preach the trail of this if one sermon it's three months and one trail of the sermon is serpent is four hours what do you think is it and did he ever preach that do you think he didn't preach it do you think he didn't preach it but i'm saying i'm going back to preach it and he never preached it do you think he never preached the surprise you need to know brother branham very well to know what it is do you know brother branham was preparing to preach the trumpet and he even want to run to the room and what did god tell him brother branham was preparing to preach the trumpet he even was looking for the room to go ahead and set everything up and god said you already preached the trumpet so even brother branham himself didn't know he was preaching the trumpet so where was those trumpet god say under the sixth hill so if you go to the sixth seal go find the trumpet amen amen go look it up like this if you're gonna see one trumpet second trumpet you need a second oil body amen so it tells you that the six seal is not really just the six cell and if you hitch the trumpet then the valves are poor there so what is in that section so this message is very deep very very very deep until you see things and you don't know what to do you wonder you say am i really seeing that or what amen so we'll try to stay a little bit on the surface to try to keep roof in plain view if not we get lost again and it's going to be trail of the serpent one two three and then we get lost amen do you remember the second banquet of esther look where we are in other words we're way down here and the second banquet is still up there so to go back up on the surface i have to wait for the signal from a gps amen i am not preaching today but i am translating brother polycarp he's going to be preaching it has been a long time since he preached and i will be translating him so lord's willing you peel you pull on the on the on the gift of god and the lord will speak to you tonight amen so without taking uh a lot of time because it's going to be him preaching and i'm translating so he needs a little bit more the time and more grace than us amen so let's sing only believe as we come only believe all leave believers all things are possible only believe [Music] only believes things are possible only believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe [Music] if you don't believe nothing will happen in your life i want you to pray also for you let's pray eternally heavenly father creator of heaven and earth tonight in to be in your house to be in that presence we are inviting you in this time if there is a time that we really need you jesus the spirit of the living god they saw satan we ask you to come down in this place and you take a full pre-eminence take control of everything that will be happening may you take a control in everything may you remove every plant from the work of darkness may you change every situation today because that word is as you're standing [Music] genesis chapter one everybody can hear me genesis chapter one verse one to four uh in the beginning god created the heaven and earth and the earth and the earth was without form and void and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god divided the light from the darkness still in genesis chapter 1 drop to verse 10 this adul's 10 to 12. and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters and god saw that it was good and god say let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his khan whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was sold and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding sealed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his khan and god saw that he was good amen amen if you notice the bible say that the earth was void and the earth was without form maybe in your life it's completely hopeless and i'm going to tell you tonight as the title of my subject my uh subject my sermon tonight do not lose hope when god created the heaven and the earth the bible says that the earth was void there was nothing no hope but after a while if you notice the scripture says that the lord begin to speak to the earth and the earth brought forth herbs and fruits maybe in your life you have something that is without form somebody already told you that you are doomed with the sickness you're gonna die according to science according to all evidences that human beings can produce whatever situation you're going through maybe it's difficult or not maybe trials or no trials just believe that god is able to change the situation god is able to change your situation behind every sort of attack from the work of darkness there is always a god's opportunity hidden i want you to look at that as an opportunity for you to go to a higher level and this is what we will be talking about tonight amenity there is a victory in the name of jesus christ the problem is their purpose is not just not to take the devil off your life but the purpose is to find out why is the enemy attacking me what did he see in my life to attack me at this time why it's so hard for me to get married why is it hard for me to conceive the purpose what is the devil seeing in my life why such a difficulties am i the only one that have to struggle to get married or everybody else go to the same trial behind every attack from the devil opportunity you must discover what is god's opportunity hidden behind this test opportunity so tonight we want to find out those opportunities from god when you're going through trouble in your life when you go into trials it doesn't mean that god have forsaken you we will notice what is the devil tactic you are not the first one to receive an attack from the united states and you're not gonna be the last one to be attacked by the devil what yes you spend if the devil is not after you so something is wrong with you secretary the bible says that trouble comes often to the justice league never the lord deliver him out of all his trouble let's go to the book of george's chapter 11. judges chapter 11 first verse jeff day was a mighty man of valor and he was the son of a harlot and gillard begot jeffthal la fernandez and his wife's son grew up and they trust out jephthah and say unto him that shall not inherit in our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman now listen carefully as we're moving on verse 3 from his brethren and dwell in the land of torbjorn and went out with him and he came to the process it came to pass in the process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel israel and he was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel and the elders of gillard went to face jester out of the land of torbjorn and they say unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of emo now jeff out of my father's house why are you coming to me now when you are in distress listen carefully again did you hear that we are talking about opportunities tonight give me some time i'm gonna take off my coat if the devil if the holy ghost doesn't manifest itself through you second year completes the so you must be working for the work of darkness because at the beginning when god created heaven the earth was made it was void and without form may tell but despite that the spirit of the living god let's do that yesterday that was moving upon the face of the deep second year hallelujah so somewhere there was some hallelujah glory to god going on here so there were a different noise going on amen amen you cannot come in the church of the living god exactly i cannot be in the middle of a riot amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen okay in the sermon the entire spirit 1955 july 24th paragraph 56. brother branham says this is i rather worship in a mission where it's been swept out or a bar room and have the freedom of the holy spirit and the love of god burning into the hearts plito then sit in the greatest cathedral that we got in the world and being cramped down with men's doctrines and dogmas we need today is a shaking revival get back to the truth get back to god's word again amen amen so you cannot be quiet in the house of god amen amen hallelujah okay jesus glory be to god we were reading the scripture in the story of jephthah the elder of gilad say down to him [Music] and fast again the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gila me if you bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall i be your head and we will learn together i don't know who is going through this situation where we read satan afar doing a prostitute he was first of all a son of a harlot and his father was gillard amen maybe he was the elder son so his younger brother when they grew up lost when they grew up maybe their father passed away so they decided together that you jefta our elder brother you must leave her home you must leave this home amen amen elizabeth they say this verse 2. and his wife's son grew up from his brethren and dwell in the land of amen amen you know they are the country of taub in the scripture for jephthah satay elia the prisma it was a place for him to be broken down ellie it was a time that god was working on him oh [Music] something that's going to change my condition and then i'm going to have a better future i don't know if you find yourself in such a situation all may be a similar situation to a city called tober amen he was just like jacob you met the angel of the lord the angel of the lord you're not going to leave until you change your cover because i'm a liar because he was a shasta lady he said you must change me yes and now you must remember that there is always a hope yes because those that weighed upon the lord opportunity so there is all kind of opportunities this representative everything that comes in your sight you must seize the momentum you must change it to your benefit glory to god don't even have confidence in your husband amen no confidence you don't believe anything that was the same situation he was the elders of the city and those elders that came to seek after him they told him come and fight for us and then you're going to be our cameraman you will be our head country but if you become the head of elders gloria's here in glory to god the deviations you automatically are above the brother that trusts you because you are now ruling the health benefits because you are other men they all they are automatically because now his position is no more about his father house but the whole land instead of having a small person now he have the entire region together because the house of his father which seems to be a big inheritance now seems like a smile because he owned all killed maybe you also you would notice even if your family turned their back again [Applause] because they say that jephthah was gathered with vain men the people that looks like nobody nothing he says those are the people that supported him lost [Music] other party to fight it you must be an ego to understand another ego going to try that's our destiny we must understand an ego in his future because inheriting the blessing of jephthah and it's only the people outside that believe in me when i tell them something let's get to what you say but when you're going to be blessed no matter how much love you have in your heart that's why you notice in life this the time the process of time change a lot of stuff in our lives you will see somebody blessed today you look you say how can he be a friend to those kind of people but you don't understand those are the people elizabeth the the vision and they're so far away amen amen so tonight what i want to say is this that every triumph no matter how hard it is okay transform me i want you to use it i ain't no opportunity an opportunity the benediction of a blessing for yourself i don't know what you're going through i don't know your problem but god knows your situation he connected with your please you know your situation better than myself here amen amen god what he want is okay that the situation you are him he wants to transform that situation amen amen community you can call 21-22 i'm going to go straight to the story elizabeth party they were going in front of him it was the red sea that was a blockage amen amen but where i just called the description [Applause] what is that situation that is blocking you yeah let's condition your question what is that condition that is blocking you what is that science that declared a blockage it's always the mind since you did this in your past so you are not eligible for this you do comment situation so why do you believe the word and he is the trouble or no trouble but with the word of god in the name of jesus christ and now a child will be born and then what the devil does is trouble your mind when he troubles your reasoning where are you going just reason reason reason take time to read the scripture the prophet says this here let me read something here there beautiful to confuse you if you don't think if you don't think no more of god then get down not very interested in your soul amenity amen you either you you got it jesus glory be to god chapter 11 verse 30 to 32. he noticed also the life of gideon la vie de barack and the life of barack la vida samson the dimension also samson and they also experience in their lives and brother brandon asked himself a question in paragraph 21. illegitimacy what is the place of our little tiny testimony compared to these muddy heroes of faith at that day you see you see when we read here and then from there he went to a higher position and there are certain things if we have time we will see in the life of jesus and if you look at the life of david foreign these people never learn what you're learning now you know they put these examples and they understood that the main thing was the spirit of god he was only to have the holy ghost he even understood things maybe you would not have been born a child of god is god's representative he is a small god moses him when he was coming he was coming from the presence of god when the people look at his face the bible says that his face was shut he was shining light amen amen what about you this sentence about the holy ghost is because it's the holy ghost that make you a child or a daughter a daughter or a son of god there is a difference between a child of god and sons of god amen amen yes there is a difference hallelujah hallelujah amen amen glory be to god hello and brother was really killed because of the word of god and i'm going back to the story there is many things in his life i'm going to read verse venefu 29 231. he passed over unto the children of ammon now listen closely and eternally unto them if that shall be fought deliver the children of hermony [Music] i don't know what you're going through what somebody told you it's impossible have you prayed god about it have you promised god something have you made a contract with god did you promise to god something silly if he gave you what you need he said joseph there is a contract going on as is by the power of the holy spirit and for that will come out of my house in my zone from my house paladins here not somebody else not to somebody else not something that is not important what is really i will give you something i will give it to you as a burn off amen amen have you ever done that listen because i have a few more things to say can i read it pastor or i can just tell the story as you feel it for bible you can you can read it at home i don't want to hold you too long when jeff i was coming back only and that woman that chad came out of his face and he [Music] straight she said unto him my father if that has opened the mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which has protested go ahead and offer me daddy secretary whatever came out of your mind you must respect it how many times how many times you ask god to give you something you say lord if you bless yourself you don't come to church anymore but the daughter of jesus he said daddy go ahead offer me up equity listen to this that i said and he sent her away for two months and after two months she came back her offered her for burn offering amen amen at the end of two months she returned unto and it was a custom in israel that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the gillard four days in a year for company the prostitute the beginning was the son of a prostitute a harlot amen amen he moved from there to be the king over the region of galen gillard because of prayer and not only that honestly they it was four days a year until they you see from where he comes and where he ended situation if you hear or stream if there is a difficult situation god is able to change he was in consecration the place that god will break him it's in the wilderness that's where god trains for memories like they did it for moses to remove everything that he learned he was in the wilderness are you going through a wilderness in your life the things they're more spiritual than paul elizabeth can i read in the book of zechariah let me find it the devil troubled me today but i got it written down here jesus glory be to god zechariah chapter 3. but how can you get sick if there is no battle the prophet brother branham spoke to us and said that entancing spirit lenin the devil elena glory be to god demonology domain physique in demonology physical writing i'm just going to read something he says this let them also and you think that you're more spiritual than joshua the high priest [Music] joshua beside god in front of god and satan at his right hand not left right hand to resist [Music] josue did you hear that jesus that stood before the engine he said take away the fear forgotten from him i have caused that iniquity with change of arraignment spirituality i don't know how spiritual you are [Music] oh you can come to church and sit quiet is you are in the middle of a trouble and you calm like nothing happened you are facing the devil and you don't want to fight first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 8 verse 18. wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul in once and again hindered us not one time and

verse 26 where we are if you want me to stop i can stop from here but there are many many kind of devils in the scriptures i could have shown you yeah what the child of god is a child of god a child of god work unto the end to him will i give power over the nations not to whom they prophesy not to whom they have a loud anointing depression i don't want to be violent they say you must be violated

right condition i don't know your situation and you must leave do i reflected you must reflect god he gave his only daughter unique a proper like design chosen god doesn't take the second hand towards

way or the other you're going to get it off amen let's stand heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for this message of encouragement to your children lord father we are living in the world where every day waking up we know that we're getting into a battlefield if it's not in the mind it might be somebody driving a wrong way it might be maybe something that happened maybe something that will upset us maybe the gas price went up again maybe something didn't go with the customer service maybe a delivery that we were waiting and then it was delay and then we get out of order then this is not working then the things we orchestrated are not the way father we thought it's going to happen every single day when we start going up we're waking up with a sword going to sleep with a sword but father we know that we are not alone in this battle father you are with us because you gave us a promise that you would never leave us no forsake us you will be with us all the way until we meet you into the air lord sometimes when we don't see things in the spiritual realm we don't realize how deadly this hour is if you would open our spiritual eyes we will be probably staying in our home and do not want to even come out because of the darkness of laodicea until father you declare it in the zodiac and you show it through your prophet that everything was dark spiritually no wonder paul was afraid from the first age he said i'm afraid as the serpent began evil father as a prophet he could see where the church would drift away and the circumstances that will happen to the church but father before those circumstances happen there are promises given also in the old testament that you will restore father whatever the devil will bring in our life and father whatever happened in our life whatever complexes the people have built because of lord the background of their family maybe they were born out of wedlock maybe they were born and they don't even know their father maybe they were rejected by their own family maybe they felt of uh uh uh they are battling uh a complex in their life because of the treatment that they receive since their childhood until they feel like they're worthless maybe the way the husband treated them over the year lord until they felt like the nothing maybe further the way the wife treated somebody until father they feel like they don't feel like they're a man father many kind of complexes many kind of past many kind of family trouble things that are hard to even even or father tell someone and we holding them as wounds over the years a scar that we can go around that we cannot make a decision without using them without filtering things through those car through those complexes and most of the time we come up with a wrong judgment because of the complexes that has been built all around us but further you can use a chapter in the scripture lord father you allow him to go through this trial through this kind of situation so that somebody down the road toward the end time will look at their life and compare their life and say that if jephthah could be used by god if jephthah could be put between among the heroes of faith then my life also there is a hope then i have a hope to approach the living god because what they did in the old testament was under the blood of bulls and goats but father we have a higher blood today that is speaking better things than the blood of evil a blood that can separate us that can remove all the past that can break every complex that can break every circle and show us that we don't even belong to the family that we were born under but we belongs to a heavenly father family and that family's name is the name of jesus christ and we came from the very mind of god and in the eyes of god we are sinless we are the virtuous blood of jesus christ without spot and without blemish that's the way we will see you and nobody will go in the rapture battling complex nobody will look at your face battling complex because the scriptures say as you are that's the way we will be when we will meet you because you were taken care of sending out this world further to transform our life so that lord we can be even worthy to touch the book of redemption and not only to touch the book of redemption but we can eat it up and nothing happened to us because you paid the penalty of sin and there is nothing all the ordinances that was against us father you bloated up completely at the cross and we can walk freely further chaining up knowing lord father that we are the children of the almighty god father we commit them unto the hand may you strengthen your manservant that you use tonight father may you protect us throughout the week lord and father continue to consecrate our life and prepare us if that terry to come so that lord father we can gather together around the reveal word of the hour and go in a in a in a in a position in a level more higher than what we was yesterday father we thank you and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ hallelujah go ahead what is it [Music] i'm pressing on [Music] [Music] every day still praying [Music] lord plunge my feet [Music] my [Music] my these are too straight [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music]
