[47:24] of this day if the lord terry

[47:28] remember next
[47:29] sunday next saturday it's gonna be our
[47:32] house meeting at brother kelly's home
[47:34] so brother david please if you would
[47:37] send the
[47:37] address and everything you know how
[47:40] everything goes so
[47:41] if somebody still have a question i left
[47:44] the
[47:46] question box at home you can hand it to
[47:48] the deacon and we can handle it from
[47:50] there
[47:50] so throughout the week i will try to
[47:52] look over
[47:53] and make sure we get it covered
[47:56] i'm not uh to the best of my
[47:59] understanding i might be wrong but did
[48:02] somebody ask a question
[48:04] in the last meeting about
[48:07] why was the woman designed by the devil
[48:11] by designed by the devil or something
[48:13] like that
[48:14] marriage and divorce did somebody ask
[48:15] that question
[48:18] was that a question oh okay
[48:22] okay i thought somebody did ask
[48:26] that but if it's not that's fine lord's
[48:29] willing we will get into that
[48:31] next sunday lord's willing if everything
[48:35] goes well we will have brother there
[48:37] award
[48:39] so if you don't know him probably by
[48:42] name you're going to see him by face and
[48:43] you're going to remember him
[48:45] and if you don't know him at all just
[48:48] stand there and you're going to see how
[48:49] the anointing dropped from heaven
[48:51] he's an anointed preacher these are hard
[48:56] men to get in the schedule because
[48:58] they're busy
[48:59] left and right but this has been
[49:01] scheduled for quite a while
[49:03] so lord's willing next sunday you're
[49:06] going to have brother day reward
[49:07] so we anticipating a great time there
[49:10] and you pray for the house meeting and
[49:12] you pray for everything
[49:14] so that all will be well by the grace of
[49:16] god
[49:17] if you have any question about the house
[49:18] meeting the deacons handle those
[49:21] because it's spiritual and include food
[49:24] so it belongs to the deacon
[49:26] you can talk to them and we go from
[49:27] there amen
[49:30] begin to understand why the high heel
[49:32] has been held
[49:34] for so long but i found out that
[49:36] whatever we were going through was
[49:38] really a foundation to get to the high
[49:41] heels so
[49:42] lord's willing on the oncoming service
[49:45] i'm gonna get on the clothing
[49:47] and the high heel so stay tight
[49:50] but i'm gonna lay a strong foundation
[49:53] today
[49:54] so we can use it and soar with it if you
[49:58] miss it today you won't understand why
[50:00] it's wrong
[50:01] so you gotta understand today why
[50:05] what is what is going on behind once you
[50:08] get it just like
[50:09] when you caught hiddenism then you
[50:12] understand why
[50:13] all the makeup and the and the hearing
[50:16] and everything else
[50:17] fed away so there is a key here that you
[50:20] need to understand
[50:21] if you understand thank you very much
[50:23] musician if you understand the
[50:25] key about how the woman was made
[50:29] then everything else about the clothing
[50:32] and the high heel and everything else
[50:34] will flow through it
[50:36] amen so be in prayer
[50:39] stay alert i already know those who
[50:42] sleep in church
[50:44] so i keep watching and giving time and
[50:47] i'm praying for them at home
[50:49] i say lord please wake them up please
[50:51] wake them up
[50:54] so if you continue to sleep then i have
[50:56] to talk to you
[50:57] and see what is going on amen i'm a
[51:01] pastor i see everybody so i know who
[51:02] sleep in church
[51:04] and i know who frequently sleep in
[51:06] church amen
[51:08] so if you work at night i understand
[51:10] you're trying the best
[51:11] and i'm praying for you i have been
[51:13] praying i pray i cast that devil away so
[51:16] you stay awake because somebody is
[51:17] trying to rob you
[51:19] from the blessings of god because as
[51:22] soon as the service
[51:23] is over you dare you wide awake
[51:26] amen and whatever what's going on here
[51:29] you're not there
[51:30] especially young people it really
[51:31] bothers me
[51:33] so i have been praying and watching and
[51:35] giving grace
[51:36] and giving grace if we continue then
[51:38] secretly
[51:39] i will have to reach out and see what is
[51:41] going on
[51:42] how we can pray for you and deliver you
[51:45] and the lord deliver you from that
[51:47] spirit of sleeping
[51:48] i hate when we like are you looking at
[51:50] and i see somebody like this
[51:52] and i'm like wait a minute where are you
[51:54] at what were you doing last night
[51:57] amen were you on the window
[52:02] were you on the window of jezebel or
[52:04] what
[52:06] were you looking at the wind of jezebel
[52:09] i don't know
[52:10] so pray that everything goes well amen
[52:15] yes and one more thing before we get
[52:18] into our reading
[52:20] our service started 11 o'clock
[52:24] not at 12 o'clock not at 11 45
[52:28] as a pastor i cannot see something going
[52:31] wrong and me keeping my mouth shut
[52:34] remember your pastor i would never face
[52:36] the lord jesus christ with your blood
[52:38] in your hand the worship is a part of
[52:41] the service and it's
[52:43] very important the offering is a part of
[52:46] the service it's very important
[52:48] the preaching of the word is part of the
[52:50] service and it's vip
[52:52] very very very important amen
[52:55] so when you always miss the worship and
[52:58] you're coming late
[53:00] every sunday every wednesday except if
[53:02] you have a legitimate
[53:04] uh reason something is wrong amen
[53:07] people are already in seven and you're
[53:09] coming you're at zero
[53:11] so we gotta pump you up to get you up to
[53:14] seven
[53:15] to catch up the people and if we go to
[53:18] the building
[53:18] we're not going to be having service at
[53:21] 11 we're going to start
[53:22] having service earlier because we're
[53:24] going to introduce the sunday school
[53:26] so if you don't you are not here on time
[53:29] when the service is at 11 o'clock i
[53:31] wonder how you're going to be on time in
[53:33] sunday school
[53:34] i've seen people that never have never
[53:37] probably even been in sunday school
[53:39] for years and they're fine i even heard
[53:42] one who say i will go to sunday school
[53:45] only when my kids are old enough so
[53:47] sunday school means
[53:48] nothing for her and if i give you quote
[53:51] about sunday school
[53:53] some of you will begin to even repent so
[53:55] remember the service is a little eleven
[53:58] o'clock
[53:58] so before 11 o'clock you should be here
[54:02] pray praying sitting reading your
[54:05] scripture
[54:05] so when the song service started you
[54:07] begin to worship god
[54:09] amen and then you go through the song
[54:12] service and everything but
[54:13] the service started eleven o'clock you
[54:15] show up at 11 45.
[54:16] it's every start at 11 o'clock you show
[54:18] up at 12 o'clock over
[54:20] and over and over and over you have a
[54:22] problem with your time
[54:24] it is not good it is not acceptable it
[54:27] is not pleasing god
[54:29] amen because at your job you always on
[54:33] time
[54:34] amen even if we have problem with gas
[54:37] you're going to manage to find gas
[54:39] for next week because you don't want to
[54:41] miss your paycheck
[54:43] amen so remember if you're doing that
[54:45] for a job that will sooner
[54:47] will stay in this home in this world and
[54:50] we're going to go
[54:51] to heaven how much more the house of god
[54:54] so
[54:54] dragging being late is not good we
[54:57] cannot be starting reading the service
[54:59] and that's the time you enter
[55:01] amen amen if they call you to a party
[55:05] you're going to be there on time
[55:06] if they call you to a job you're going
[55:08] to be there on time if they call you to
[55:10] an interview you're going to be there in
[55:12] time
[55:12] but every day late in church late in
[55:15] church
[55:16] late in church that is not good that is
[55:19] not acceptable
[55:20] i'm a spiritual father as far as a
[55:22] pastor
[55:23] i would never shut my mouth to tell you
[55:26] something when it's wrong
[55:28] amen that is love it's always corrective
[55:31] amen let's go to our scripture this
[55:34] morning
[55:36] genesis chapter 2.
[55:40] if you know we got service in the
[55:42] morning you better go to sleep on time
[55:44] if you're not working
[55:45] you better go to bed on time you cannot
[55:48] be on facebook or what's up till 2 a.m
[55:52] and then you expect to be here a week
[55:55] and be here on time
[55:57] amen then when it's sunday night
[56:00] toward monday then you're going to sleep
[56:02] on time because you got to be at work
[56:08] it's a condition of the heart amen
[56:11] and sometimes you're not even far
[56:14] brother did not drive
[56:15] four hours gotta deny four
[56:18] hours four hours there's nobody here
[56:22] that dropped four hours

[56:34] week and see
[56:35] what time brother did not get here four
[56:37] hours driving in the morning
[56:39] so when you're still sleeping he's
[56:42] driving already
[56:44] when he gets here that's the time you
[56:46] wake up and you start fixing yourself
[56:50] something is wrong this
[56:53] time of the message is no more plain
[56:56] church
[56:57] it is no more the time when you go to

[57:02] everything this is home
[57:04] amen we got to prepare to meet the lord
[57:07] into the air amen

[58:20] the the tree that god made for noah
[58:23] are for jonah that's the three that make
[58:27] the castle
[58:34] this message is perfectly in line like
[58:37] this with the scripture
[58:39] genesis chapter 2
[58:45] somebody asked even a question on a
[58:47] necklace
[58:48] and i answered that in the house meeting
[58:50] and i found the scripture
[58:53] why brother branham gave the answer he
[58:55] gave
[59:01] and out of the ground the lord god form
[59:05] every beast of the field we already talk
[59:07] about this
[59:08] and every file of the air if you're the
[59:11] one spending time
[59:13] in the bathroom and putting people
[59:15] behind you need to stop that one
[59:18] because people can be at church late
[59:20] because of you spending
[59:21] too much time in the bathroom you take a
[59:24] shower longer
[59:25] and you put everybody behind because
[59:26] they don't want to leave your home
[59:28] yeah it just dropped so i have to
[59:30] release it
[59:33] and every file of the air and brought
[59:36] them to adam
[59:37] to see what he would call them and
[59:40] whatsoever
[59:41] adam call every living creature that was
[59:45] the name thereof we already explained
[59:46] this
[59:47] that everything else was created from
[59:49] the ground
[59:50] god spoke and he came out god spoke and
[59:53] he came out
[59:54] amen you might be seated and adam gave's
[59:57] name
[59:58] gave names to all caddo and to the file
[1:00:02] of the air
[1:00:03] and to every beast of the field but for
[1:00:06] adam there was not found a help
[1:00:10] meet in other words a helper suitable
[1:00:13] that fit
[1:00:14] a help meet for him everything was
[1:00:16] paired
[1:00:17] paired male female male female male
[1:00:20] female
[1:00:20] when god created adam in the spirit he
[1:00:23] was male female
[1:00:24] but in the body adam was only male it's
[1:00:27] a masculine expression
[1:00:29] which was showing the head amen now
[1:00:32] verse 21 and
[1:00:35] satan caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:00:39] upon adam caused the deep ship to fall
[1:00:44] i hope you don't have that deep sleep in
[1:00:46] church
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:51] who calls the deep sleeper
[1:00:56] who's performing the creation of evil
[1:01:02] amen and the lord god
[1:01:06] caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam
[1:01:10] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:01:14] something that he's already created
[1:01:16] amen and close up the flesh
[1:01:20] instead thereof verse 22
[1:01:23] and the rib that was already created
[1:01:26] manufactured already
[1:01:28] which the lord god has taken from the
[1:01:30] man
[1:01:31] not satan not satan
[1:01:34] it is god who's doing that
[1:01:38] everybody clear not satan
[1:01:41] this is a tough part of the message not
[1:01:44] satan
[1:01:45] it is god amen and the way
[1:01:49] which the lord god had taken from man
[1:01:53] he made he a water
[1:01:56] who made the woman who created the woman
[1:02:06] god created the woman
[1:02:13] so who created the sisters
[1:02:20] oh god relax
[1:02:23] and the weed which the lord god has
[1:02:25] taken from men
[1:02:27] made he a woman and brought her
[1:02:31] to men do you see anything that the
[1:02:34] devil is doing here
[1:02:36] do you see the intervention of the devil
[1:02:38] here
[1:02:41] okay verse 23
[1:02:44] and adam say this is now born
[1:02:48] of my bones she's a rib and
[1:02:52] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[1:02:56] woman because she was taken out of men
[1:03:00] it's a by-product a product of the
[1:03:02] product we already explained this
[1:03:04] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:03:08] and his mother and shall cling to his
[1:03:11] wife it's a part of him
[1:03:14] amen and there shall be
[1:03:17] one flesh and they both were
[1:03:20] naked the man and his wife
[1:03:24] and were not ashamed in other words
[1:03:27] when the woman was created by god
[1:03:30] both the woman and the man was in the
[1:03:33] stage of
[1:03:34] innocency anybody clear because the
[1:03:37] black dog
[1:03:38] is blocked amen he was there
[1:03:42] but it was dormant he was not awakened
[1:03:46] yet
[1:03:47] anybody clear let's go to chapter 3
[1:03:50] verse 6. and when the woman
[1:03:54] saw now
[1:03:57] it is the devil dealing with the woman
[1:04:00] this is the first time
[1:04:01] we are we have been informing the
[1:04:05] scripture
[1:04:05] that the devil have an interaction with
[1:04:08] the woman
[1:04:09] amen i just keep the other one because
[1:04:12] you know
[1:04:12] and when the woman saw that the
[1:04:16] tree was good for food who showed her
[1:04:23] so there was a session that set ahead
[1:04:26] with eve
[1:04:30] and satan show
[1:04:34] if certain things
[1:04:38] amen and when the woman saw
[1:04:41] with a different wisdom we already
[1:04:44] explained that wisdom is sensual
[1:04:47] based on the senses on the feelings and
[1:04:50] when it's in the book of james
[1:04:52] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:04:54] good for food
[1:04:56] and that it was pleasant to the eye
[1:05:00] and a tree to be desired now
[1:05:03] there was something in eve eve saw that
[1:05:06] tree
[1:05:06] all this time and never felt compelled
[1:05:11] to go get it but with the
[1:05:14] teaching of satan
[1:05:17] amen with the teaching of satan
[1:05:21] eve begin to last after
[1:05:25] that tree the teaching of satan
[1:05:29] awakened the last the black dog that was
[1:05:32] sleeping
[1:05:34] everybody clear and when she saw that
[1:05:37] the tree to be desired
[1:05:39] to make one wise she took off the fruit
[1:05:43] thereof
[1:05:44] and did it ever clear
[1:05:48] if you ask eve what happened
[1:05:51] if you ask the devil he will say eve
[1:05:53] took that herself
[1:05:55] she didn't take it herself that tree was
[1:05:58] already there
[1:05:59] if there is something that the devil
[1:06:02] did to eve that caused the eve
[1:06:06] to take the tree and eat it we already
[1:06:09] know what that
[1:06:10] eating means in the book of proverbs
[1:06:12] such is a way of a prostituted woman
[1:06:14] she eat it and wipe off her mouth you
[1:06:16] already know that
[1:06:18] she took off the fruit thereof and did
[1:06:20] eat
[1:06:21] and gave also to her water
[1:06:25] to her husband with her and he did water
[1:06:29] so the one who taught adam how to eat
[1:06:32] the fruit his own
[1:06:36] and the one who taught the woman was who
[1:06:40] so eve thought
[1:06:44] adam to do
[1:06:49] adam didn't know what to do amen
[1:06:53] adam was living with eve all this time
[1:06:57] and never do what to do
[1:07:01] adam could wake up in the morning and
[1:07:03] hug is
[1:07:04] nothing wrong he doesn't say anything
[1:07:08] he could hold eve by the hand and
[1:07:10] they're going together
[1:07:12] and he slapped eve and he slapped him
[1:07:14] and nothing happened
[1:07:16] and they were naked and when they look
[1:07:18] at each other adam doesn't see anything
[1:07:22] amen but this time adam when he looked
[1:07:26] at eve
[1:07:28] something is a little bit different
[1:07:31] who opened the eyes
[1:07:36] everybody clear everybody clear so far
[1:07:40] jump to verse 11. and he
[1:07:43] said do you see how much we've been in

[1:08:37] so that knowledge is a knowledge that is
[1:08:41] connected to the eating
[1:08:44] and the eating is a sexual relationship
[1:08:48] it is a sexual relationship knowledge
[1:08:56] amen knowledge

[1:10:12] amen gave me the tree and i did eat it
[1:10:17] now retracing the origin the root
[1:10:20] verse 13 and the lord god said to the
[1:10:24] woman

[1:10:28] words
[1:10:28] god didn't say what is this that you
[1:10:31] have known
[1:10:32] what is this that you have water so eve
[1:10:35] did something to adam
[1:10:39] you understand the devil satan
[1:10:42] the serpent did something to evil
[1:10:46] and eve took the knowledge and did it on
[1:10:49] adam
[1:10:52] everybody clear what is this that you
[1:10:55] have done
[1:10:56] and the woman said the water the
[1:10:59] serpentine water
[1:11:01] began me and i did what
[1:11:05] in other words i learned from the devil
[1:11:10] the devil taught me that and i am the
[1:11:14] one
[1:11:14] who taught my husband eve became an
[1:11:18] instrument
[1:11:19] or an agent of satan
[1:11:22] the woman become the agent of
[1:11:26] satan the
[1:11:29] woman become a tool of satan
[1:11:33] everybody here she become the one
[1:11:37] that is actually reflecting the
[1:11:40] knowledge of satan
[1:11:44] if you don't know about what satan is
[1:11:46] thinking
[1:11:47] go check the woman
[1:11:50] let's go to proverb chapter 6.
[1:11:56] amen
[1:12:00] you see why the gospel is tied to the
[1:12:02] sister
[1:12:04] you see now why
[1:12:07] now question god created the woman
[1:12:12] amen who start teaching the woman
[1:12:16] sexual relationship was a god
[1:12:20] or satan remember that question
[1:12:24] who start teaching if sexual
[1:12:27] relationship will say
[1:12:29] adam or satan
[1:12:32] keep those questions in mind and you're
[1:12:34] going to see brother brother and we'll
[1:12:36] ask you the same question
[1:12:39] proverb chapter 6 if you're there you
[1:12:41] can say amen
[1:12:43] verse 23 for the commandment is the lamp
[1:12:47] and the law is light and reproof
[1:12:51] of instruction are the way of life
[1:12:54] to keep you from the evil woman
[1:12:58] a woman that is already infected with
[1:13:01] that knowledge
[1:13:03] from the flattery of the tongue because
[1:13:05] the devil was the one that's slicker
[1:13:08] but branham said watch that slicker now
[1:13:11] it is that anointing is on a woman
[1:13:13] amen from the flattery of the tongue
[1:13:17] of a strange woman we already explained
[1:13:19] you this
[1:13:20] verse 25 last not
[1:13:24] not love it's a lustful
[1:13:27] love last not after her water
[1:13:31] remember there were three things we
[1:13:33] talked about them
[1:13:34] the first one the woman controls by
[1:13:36] water
[1:13:37] by beauty the second one is water and
[1:13:40] the third one is water
[1:13:43] all of this existed before
[1:13:47] but adam was neutralized to it
[1:13:51] adam so eve nothing happened
[1:13:54] adam saw eve walking nothing happened
[1:13:58] adam saw the shape of eve naked
[1:14:01] nothing happened adam saw everything
[1:14:04] about
[1:14:04] even nothing happened until the serpent
[1:14:08] brought a gospel of sex
[1:14:16] last note after her beauty in your heart
[1:14:20] neither let her take you with her water
[1:14:26] the only thing they are talking about
[1:14:28] the beauty here
[1:14:29] the focus is on the eyes
[1:14:34] why eyes
[1:14:37] why amen for by means of a worrish woman
[1:14:43] a man is brought to a piece of bread and
[1:14:46] the adulteress
[1:14:47] will hunt for the precious life
[1:14:50] everybody clear so far

[1:18:26] but these women don't stay home
[1:18:29] amen now she is without

[1:20:02] window
[1:20:06] matthew 5 27 you have heard
[1:20:11] that he was said by them of all time
[1:20:14] you shall not commit water
[1:20:17] adultery the old time you have to do it
[1:20:20] physically
[1:20:22] amen they have to catch you doing it
[1:20:26] now jesus comes and begin to trace it
[1:20:30] from where he started verse 28
[1:20:33] but i said to you that whosoever
[1:20:36] looks on a man
[1:20:39] why a woman
[1:20:44] why not a man whosoever
[1:20:48] look on a woman to do what
[1:20:52] adam was looking at eve and never lasted
[1:20:57] but for this first time when adam comes
[1:21:00] he looks as if
[1:21:01] something is different
[1:21:05] because eve is displaying something else
[1:21:08] whosoever looked at a woman to last
[1:21:11] after her
[1:21:13] has committed adultery with her already
[1:21:16] in her water so oh
[1:21:19] that scene that's going to transpire
[1:21:21] later already happened in the heart by
[1:21:23] just

[1:21:38] for your grace
[1:21:40] your love your mercy father and for
[1:21:42] everything you have been doing for us
[1:21:44] father thank you for giving us an
[1:21:46] opportunity

[1:21:50] word of the hour
[1:21:52] lord we thank you for this message
[1:21:55] and we thank you for the revelation and
[1:21:57] opening our eyes
[1:21:59] to see exactly the plan of redemption
[1:22:01] for this
[1:22:02] end time lord may the devil and his army
[1:22:06] be completely sealed out of this place
[1:22:08] may only the holy spirit come and anoint
[1:22:12] your children
[1:22:13] open our heart understanding lord and
[1:22:16] speak to us and father bless us in the
[1:22:19] most
[1:22:20] powerful way in the name of jesus christ
[1:22:24] amen god bless you you've already been
[1:22:27] seated
[1:22:32] drop this i had to pick it up
[1:22:35] amen we talked about the woman
[1:22:39] jezebel it's in part 37.
[1:22:42] when we talk about jezebel we found that
[1:22:45] there were three things
[1:22:47] that jezebel done because we already
[1:22:49] dealt with her
[1:22:50] in the spiritual aspect and now we are
[1:22:53] still dealing
[1:22:54] with the natural aspect of her we found
[1:22:57] out that the first thing jezebel did she
[1:23:00] did what
[1:23:01] she painted her face we already went
[1:23:04] through that
[1:23:04] the second thing jezebel did she did
[1:23:07] what
[1:23:08] she tied her head with brother brandon
[1:23:10] explained that it was the cutting of the
[1:23:12] hair
[1:23:13] and through the cutting of the hair we
[1:23:15] found out that it was something wrong
[1:23:16] because
[1:23:17] you are actually disobeying or
[1:23:19] disrespecting
[1:23:21] the head everybody clear so far and we
[1:23:23] already explained about the head
[1:23:25] the bible said when jehu was come to
[1:23:28] jezreel jesus jew
[1:23:29] was coming jezebel heard of it
[1:23:34] and she painted her face we already
[1:23:36] explained this
[1:23:37] and tied her head we already explained
[1:23:40] this
[1:23:40] and look out at the window
[1:23:44] this is where we're going to start today
[1:23:47] amen
[1:23:48] what is going on with this window of
[1:23:51] jezebel
[1:23:52] verse 31 and as jihoo entered
[1:23:56] in the inn at the gate she
[1:23:59] said has zimri peace
[1:24:03] if you study the scripture and you check
[1:24:05] the word
[1:24:06] zimmery zimri was actually somebody
[1:24:10] who was a criminal he was a general or a
[1:24:13] commander into the army
[1:24:15] and he went and betrayed the king and
[1:24:18] actually assassinated the king
[1:24:20] and took over the throne so what
[1:24:23] happened here
[1:24:24] was god anointed jehu to bring
[1:24:27] judgment into the house of ahab and jew
[1:24:31] who went
[1:24:32] and killed the king of israel and
[1:24:35] killed the king of judah and as jew was
[1:24:38] approaching where jezebel was jezebel
[1:24:42] heard already the story that the king
[1:24:44] had been killed by jihoo
[1:24:47] so what she was saying by calling into
[1:24:50] remembrance zimri
[1:24:51] she was actually portraying or she was
[1:24:54] actually
[1:24:55] looking at you as a criminal as
[1:24:58] somebody who have assassinated the king
[1:25:02] as a commander into the army that killed
[1:25:05] the king
[1:25:06] so she was saying is this commander is
[1:25:09] this
[1:25:09] us uh uh is this man
[1:25:12] this criminal is he coming for peace
[1:25:15] or is he coming from war everybody clear
[1:25:18] so far
[1:25:19] so she said exemplary which was a
[1:25:22] criminal
[1:25:23] peace who slew his water that's what
[1:25:26] zimri actually did
[1:25:28] and he lift up his face to the water
[1:25:32] so jezebel had a specific
[1:25:35] window that she knew that when jehu
[1:25:39] approaches the city the first thing
[1:25:42] that jihoo will lay hands on will be
[1:25:45] laying hands on the window when you look
[1:25:49] at the woman right here
[1:25:53] i not joy woman good so sister you
[1:25:55] forgive me
[1:25:56] everybody clear this is a person here
[1:26:00] this is a woman with a dress right there
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:04] when we enter our home we enter our home
[1:26:08] by the door
[1:26:09] everybody clear so far but when you are
[1:26:12] inside your home
[1:26:14] and you want to access the outside or
[1:26:17] you want the outside to access you
[1:26:19] all you have to do is you gotta go
[1:26:22] through the window
[1:26:22] everybody clear the window doesn't show
[1:26:26] your feet
[1:26:30] are we clear the window does not show
[1:26:33] your waist
[1:26:35] the window usually show you as a
[1:26:38] portrait
[1:26:41] ever clear but before jezebel
[1:26:44] pop up on her portrait
[1:26:47] she have to fix herself a certain way
[1:26:51] in order to appear and to face this
[1:26:54] oncoming
[1:26:55] invader of the army which was jiho
[1:26:59] and what she did she painted her face
[1:27:02] and she fixed her hair a certain way
[1:27:06] to meet jiho what was the purpose
[1:27:09] of painting her face and fixing her hair
[1:27:12] before she appeared on the window and he
[1:27:15] lift up his face to the window
[1:27:18] and say who is on my side
[1:27:21] who and there look out to him two
[1:27:24] or three eunuchs and he said
[1:27:28] throw her down so they threw her down
[1:27:31] and some of her blood
[1:27:33] was sprinkled on the wall and on the
[1:27:36] horses
[1:27:37] and he threw her under the foot so when
[1:27:40] jehu
[1:27:41] looked at jezebel instead of jihu
[1:27:45] admiring jezebel instead of jew
[1:27:49] being attracted by jezebel instead of
[1:27:53] jew
[1:27:54] being taught by jezebel or give
[1:27:58] way to what jezebel was trying to do
[1:28:01] for some reason there was an anointing
[1:28:04] that was given on jehu that resisted
[1:28:08] whatever jezebel could do and actually
[1:28:11] destroy
[1:28:12] the very intention of jezebel everybody
[1:28:16] clear so far
[1:28:17] now as we look at the window what is
[1:28:21] going on with a window anybody clear
[1:28:25] the first time a window was spoken in
[1:28:29] the bible
[1:28:30] the window was broken in the ark of noah
[1:28:34] when god told noah to better
[1:28:37] to build the ark at the top god
[1:28:40] told noah go ahead and put a window
[1:28:43] everybody clear so far
[1:28:45] so god was the one that closed the door
[1:28:48] to the ark you can check your scripture
[1:28:50] and when the door to the oak was closed
[1:28:53] everybody cleared
[1:28:54] there was no access between the outside
[1:28:58] world that was going into chaos
[1:29:01] and doom for destruction and the inside
[1:29:05] of the ark everybody cleared when the
[1:29:08] animal
[1:29:09] were outside the ark of the outside of
[1:29:12] the ark of noah
[1:29:14] the lion could eat the zebra
[1:29:19] anybody care when the animal were
[1:29:22] outside the ark of
[1:29:24] noah a leopard could kill a goat
[1:29:28] but when those animals were put together
[1:29:31] inside the ark of noah for some reason
[1:29:35] as soon as the lion entered the ark of
[1:29:39] noah
[1:29:40] the lion stopped chasing the goat
[1:29:43] the lion started chasing the horse
[1:29:46] the leopard stop from chasing the dog
[1:29:50] everybody was in peace so there was
[1:29:53] a different atmosphere inside the ark of
[1:29:57] noah
[1:29:58] versus outside the earth of noah in
[1:30:01] other words
[1:30:02] the inside of the ark of noah had
[1:30:05] a different world than the outside of
[1:30:09] the ark
[1:30:11] there was a world inside the ark that
[1:30:14] was dominated by the spirit of god
[1:30:17] and there was another world that was
[1:30:19] outside
[1:30:20] the ark that was actually dominated by a
[1:30:24] judgment spirit of death from the devil
[1:30:27] everybody clear but to get access
[1:30:32] to connect the two world
[1:30:35] we needed a window ever created so far
[1:30:40] that was the first time a window was
[1:30:42] spoken in the bible
[1:30:44] and when we look at this window out of
[1:30:47] this
[1:30:48] window there were two birds that could
[1:30:50] go
[1:30:51] and come inside the window the window
[1:30:55] could buff be used by the crop
[1:31:01] everybody clear and the window could be
[1:31:04] used by the dolphin
[1:31:06] the dove could go out of the window
[1:31:10] and come back into the window and also
[1:31:13] the crowd could access the same thing
[1:31:16] so that window could be a blessing
[1:31:20] oh that window could be a curse
[1:31:24] anybody clear why because the two birds
[1:31:28] which symbolizes the true spirit
[1:31:31] have access into your god-given house
[1:31:36] by the window or by that same window
[1:31:39] as spirit can cut out everybody
[1:31:43] so far the next time we find another
[1:31:46] window in the scripture
[1:31:48] was when the spies went to rehab the
[1:31:52] prostitute
[1:31:54] ever cleared so far when the spies
[1:31:57] enter into rehab the prostitute and they
[1:32:00] were
[1:32:01] under the pressure of the state
[1:32:04] the state was chasing after the two
[1:32:06] preachers
[1:32:08] to catch them they were one way of
[1:32:10] exiting
[1:32:12] they could no longer exit the house
[1:32:15] the door of the house but they could use
[1:32:18] the window
[1:32:19] as an emergency exit
[1:32:23] so a window can be an emergency door
[1:32:29] when you are in cad situation
[1:32:33] when you don't know what to do a window
[1:32:36] can be turned into a door and a rahab
[1:32:40] used that window
[1:32:42] to free the two preachers
[1:32:45] everybody here and the preacher told her
[1:32:49] you see that window don't leave it like
[1:32:51] that
[1:32:53] if you leave that window like that when
[1:32:56] judgment is coming it's going to destroy
[1:32:59] your window and when you destroy your
[1:33:02] window
[1:33:03] it could also destroy your house and
[1:33:05] will destroy
[1:33:06] everything that is in your house you
[1:33:09] must put
[1:33:10] a token to the window
[1:33:13] a window must have a token
[1:33:17] when you are using a window you must
[1:33:21] have the token if you don't have
[1:33:24] the token that we know can be a new
[1:33:28] choice for the crow
[1:33:33] everybody clear so far i know it's a
[1:33:36] different avenue
[1:33:37] hang tight with me another place is when
[1:33:41] saul was chasing after david
[1:33:44] and david was already married to the
[1:33:47] daughter of soul
[1:33:49] and soul came and the people came at
[1:33:52] night
[1:33:52] and they wanted to kill david when they
[1:33:55] came at night to kill and destroy david
[1:33:58] they only accidental dakuji
[1:34:01] that could be used in case of emergency
[1:34:05] was a window in the bible in first
[1:34:08] samuel chapter 19
[1:34:10] verse 11 the bible says so also
[1:34:14] sent messengers unto david house
[1:34:17] to watch him and to slay him in the
[1:34:20] morning
[1:34:20] just like they were trying to get the
[1:34:22] spies and slay them
[1:34:24] and mikhail david's wife told him saying
[1:34:28] if that save not their life tonight
[1:34:31] tomorrow that shall be slain in other
[1:34:34] words they're gonna kill you
[1:34:35] so mika let david down through the water
[1:34:40] just like rahab let the two preacher
[1:34:43] down through the window ever clear let
[1:34:47] david down through
[1:34:48] a window and he went and fled
[1:34:51] and escaped so david used a window
[1:34:55] in an emergency situation as a way
[1:34:58] of escape everybody cleared so far
[1:35:01] but it was not meant for that you must
[1:35:04] enter
[1:35:05] by the door and you must exit by the
[1:35:08] door
[1:35:08] but in case of emergency when you're
[1:35:11] under pressure
[1:35:12] a window can be used to exit
[1:35:17] the third time we see another exited
[1:35:21] window was the apostle paul
[1:35:24] everybody clear in acts chapter 9 verse
[1:35:27] 23
[1:35:29] the bible says and after that many years
[1:35:31] days
[1:35:32] were fulfilled the jews took counsel
[1:35:36] to kill him to kill paul but there
[1:35:39] laying a weight was known of soul in
[1:35:42] other words the project the plan was
[1:35:44] disclosed
[1:35:45] and they watched the gate day and night
[1:35:49] to do water
[1:35:50] so he could not exit by the gate
[1:35:53] then the disciple took him by night
[1:35:57] and let him down by the wall in the
[1:36:00] water
[1:36:01] the bible says here in acts
[1:36:04] chapter 9 that they led him down by the
[1:36:07] wall
[1:36:08] amen if you don't search the scripture
[1:36:11] clearly
[1:36:12] you thought that they went over the wall
[1:36:15] and they been
[1:36:16] there and they pitched him over that's
[1:36:18] the way he exited but that was not the
[1:36:20] case because
[1:36:21] a window usually is on the wall
[1:36:24] in second corinthians chapter 11 verse
[1:36:27] 32
[1:36:28] the bible gave us more clarification in
[1:36:31] damascus
[1:36:32] the governor under arrest us the king
[1:36:36] kept the city of damascene with a
[1:36:38] garrison
[1:36:39] desires to apprehend me and through a
[1:36:43] water
[1:36:44] a window in the water these two
[1:36:47] scriptures
[1:36:48] don't contradict themselves because god
[1:36:51] gives a first revelation remember
[1:36:54] then he give a second revelation to help
[1:36:57] you
[1:36:58] understand better the first revelation
[1:37:00] the window
[1:37:01] is usually on the wall but the first
[1:37:04] scripture
[1:37:05] was not as specific as the second one
[1:37:08] and through a window in a basket was not
[1:37:12] let
[1:37:12] down by the water so the wall is there
[1:37:16] but it's more specific it's not just the
[1:37:19] wall
[1:37:20] but it's the window through the wall
[1:37:22] everybody cleared so far
[1:37:24] so through a window in a basket was i
[1:37:27] let down by the wall
[1:37:28] and escape his hands everybody clear
[1:37:32] so in these three cases right here we
[1:37:35] found out
[1:37:35] that this window have been used
[1:37:38] as a door of escape in cases of
[1:37:43] emergency everybody clear with rahab
[1:37:46] it he helped two preachers
[1:37:49] escape and those preachers we already
[1:37:52] know brother branham said that they
[1:37:54] played temple
[1:37:55] they didn't have tape back then but
[1:37:58] actually
[1:37:58] the tape was made flesh in other words
[1:38:02] they were only repeating what joshua
[1:38:05] already said albert here the second
[1:38:08] window
[1:38:09] was an exit for a pastor
[1:38:14] in ezekiel chapter 34 and i will
[1:38:17] set up one water a shepherd is a pastor
[1:38:21] over them
[1:38:22] and he shall feed them even myself and
[1:38:25] who he shall feed them and he shall be
[1:38:29] their worker
[1:38:30] david was a shepherd that's why when
[1:38:33] judgment was falling upon israel
[1:38:36] david told god that i am the one who
[1:38:38] sinned what about his sheep
[1:38:40] because god has been training him to
[1:38:42] keep the ship
[1:38:43] because he's going to be a future pastor
[1:38:46] everybody clear
[1:38:48] then the third window here made a way of
[1:38:51] escape to the messenger
[1:38:55] everybody clear when in case of
[1:38:58] emergency
[1:39:00] are you following me a window can be
[1:39:03] used
[1:39:04] to make an escape for preacher
[1:39:08] in case of an emergency a window can
[1:39:12] be used to make a way of escape for a
[1:39:15] pastor
[1:39:17] in case of an emergency a window
[1:39:20] can be used to make a way of escape for
[1:39:24] a messenger because the two spies
[1:39:27] were under the pressure of the state
[1:39:31] and david was under the pressure
[1:39:34] of a religious brattle soul
[1:39:38] and paul was under the pressure of
[1:39:41] a religious power that was with the jews
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:46] when you under a power of the civil
[1:39:50] and the religious the civil and the
[1:39:53] ecclesiastical power in other words when
[1:39:56] the beast that came out of the earth
[1:39:59] which have to hold them the civil
[1:40:03] and the ecclesiastical power begin to
[1:40:06] put
[1:40:06] pressure upon the church of the living
[1:40:09] god
[1:40:10] to shut the church to close the church
[1:40:15] not wanting anybody to worship in the
[1:40:18] church
[1:40:19] a window can be used for
[1:40:22] minister to preach the gospel
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:29] did you get it yes yes when it's time
[1:40:33] our title when the government
[1:40:36] begin to put pressure on the message
[1:40:40] churches
[1:40:40] and don't want the church to happen and
[1:40:43] don't want the church to operate
[1:40:46] you have a right to use your internet
[1:40:50] as a preacher to preach the gospel
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:57] it can be used to preach for a pastor
[1:41:01] it can be used as an emergency window
[1:41:04] to let open the message
[1:41:08] are you following me so not only
[1:41:12] was under religious power but actually
[1:41:16] a demonic power a demon came upon soul
[1:41:21] and when you have a combination
[1:41:24] of political power and religious power
[1:41:29] and demonic power it is a
[1:41:32] power and aggression from the pelvis
[1:41:36] and the pelvis work with the dragon
[1:41:39] which is the woman the power that comes
[1:41:42] from the sea
[1:41:44] but it's the power from america that's
[1:41:46] going to bring the squeeze
[1:41:48] and in the time of squeezing in the time
[1:41:51] of pandemic
[1:41:53] in the time of tightness in the time
[1:41:56] when you are
[1:41:57] sick in the time when you can make it to
[1:42:01] church
[1:42:01] for a legitimate reason
[1:42:05] you can use the window anybody clear so
[1:42:08] far
[1:42:10] another window was found in the book of
[1:42:13] daniel
[1:42:16] now when daniel knew that the riding was
[1:42:19] sun
[1:42:20] they put pressure on the church he went
[1:42:23] into his house and and his
[1:42:27] windows being opened in his chamber
[1:42:31] to arduino the window
[1:42:34] of daniel was not open
[1:42:38] to see what was going on in the kingdom
[1:42:41] of babylon
[1:42:44] and back here the window of daniel
[1:42:48] was not open to see what was going on
[1:42:52] in europe the window
[1:42:55] of daniel was now open to check
[1:42:58] what was going on in the political realm
[1:43:02] the window of daniel was open
[1:43:05] in the direction of jerusalem
[1:43:09] to keep his prayer life up
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:18] we are using the tree of knowledge of
[1:43:20] guild and evil
[1:43:21] that we need a token that tree
[1:43:25] must keep you up in your spiritual life
[1:43:30] but not use it as a dog
[1:43:33] to access different worlds
[1:43:38] his window being opened in his chamber
[1:43:41] toward jerusalem
[1:43:43] he kneeled down upon his knees three
[1:43:45] times a day
[1:43:46] and prayed and gave thanks before his
[1:43:49] god
[1:43:50] as he did the fourth time so before
[1:43:53] pressure comes daniel used his
[1:43:57] window wisely and when pressure came
[1:44:01] he continued to do the same thing
[1:44:04] his window kept him in the right
[1:44:07] direction
[1:44:08] toward jerusalem why was his window
[1:44:12] turned toward jerusalem in 1st king
[1:44:16] chapter 8 verse 44
[1:44:18] if the people go out to the battle
[1:44:22] against their enemy whichever that shall
[1:44:25] send them
[1:44:26] and shall pray unto the lord toward the
[1:44:29] water
[1:44:30] what was that city which
[1:44:34] god has chosen and toward the house
[1:44:38] that i have built for that name then
[1:44:41] here down
[1:44:42] in heaven their prayer and their
[1:44:44] supplication
[1:44:45] and maintain their cause and so return
[1:44:49] unto thee with all the heart and with
[1:44:52] all the soul in the land of their enemy
[1:44:56] which led them away captive and prey on
[1:44:59] to detour the land
[1:45:01] which that gave us unto their father
[1:45:04] come on
[1:45:05] the city which they have chosen
[1:45:07] jerusalem
[1:45:08] karma and their house which they have
[1:45:11] built for their name come on
[1:45:13] then he died the prayer and the
[1:45:16] supplication in heaven
[1:45:18] that dwelling place and mantender calls
[1:45:22] god out of all israel he chose
[1:45:25] the city of jerusalem and in jerusalem
[1:45:29] they built the temple amen
[1:45:32] and god dwell in that temple
[1:45:36] and solomon told god that if somebody
[1:45:40] is in trouble and if he is far away
[1:45:44] amen if he can see jerusalem
[1:45:49] but not really jerusalem but
[1:45:52] remember the temple that is in jerusalem
[1:45:57] but not really the temple but remember
[1:46:00] the god
[1:46:01] that is inside the temple if they pray
[1:46:05] that way i will automatically hear the
[1:46:08] prayer
[1:46:09] but if they cannot see jerusalem
[1:46:12] if they know their gps and they can turn
[1:46:16] toward
[1:46:17] the country of israel and when they
[1:46:20] begin to pray
[1:46:21] they begin to think about jerusalem
[1:46:24] and when they begin to think about
[1:46:26] jerusalem they go deep in the prayer
[1:46:29] on the temple and after the temple on
[1:46:32] the
[1:46:32] god that was on the temple you must heal
[1:46:36] them
[1:46:36] amen now that's the reason why when
[1:46:40] jonah
[1:46:41] was in the west body barely
[1:46:44] he was always thinking about the
[1:46:47] direction
[1:46:48] of jerusalem and when he prayed
[1:46:51] god commanded the fish to deliver him
[1:46:54] ever clear
[1:46:55] daniel used the window
[1:46:59] to keep him straight with
[1:47:02] god chosen place of
[1:47:05] worship and god chosen place of worship
[1:47:09] today is what
[1:47:11] the message of the hour use your window
[1:47:15] use your computer to keep you in line
[1:47:19] with the message of the hour
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:24] are you there stop using your window for
[1:47:27] pornography
[1:47:29] stop using your window for politics
[1:47:32] because a window needed a token
[1:47:40] hallelujah he uses his window
[1:47:43] to you to be connected into the right
[1:47:47] direction one time the church was open
[1:47:52] and there was no pressure anymore from
[1:47:56] the state
[1:47:57] and no pressure from the ecclesiastical
[1:48:02] everything was fine and the church was
[1:48:05] open the pandemic restrictions were
[1:48:09] lifted
[1:48:10] and people could go to church and
[1:48:13] assemble themselves
[1:48:15] about here and worship god
[1:48:18] then paul went into the church and paul
[1:48:22] began to preach
[1:48:24] and as paul began to preach despite
[1:48:27] the fact that the church was open
[1:48:32] despite the fact that it was not
[1:48:35] an emergency situation yet somebody
[1:48:39] chose to go on the window
[1:48:42] and to sit on the window and listen to
[1:48:46] the sermon
[1:48:47] instead of coming into the church
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:53] am i reading a different bible
[1:48:57] in the book of fact chapter 20
[1:49:01] and upon the first day of the week
[1:49:04] when the disciple came together to break
[1:49:06] bread
[1:49:07] paul preach unto them ready to depart on
[1:49:11] the moral
[1:49:12] and continue his speech until midnight
[1:49:15] he preached longer
[1:49:16] and there were many lights in the upper
[1:49:19] room
[1:49:20] where they were gathered together
[1:49:23] and there sat in at the water
[1:49:28] so the church was open there was a place
[1:49:32] for him to come
[1:49:33] and to sit in the church it was not a
[1:49:36] case of emergency
[1:49:38] it was not that he was sick it was not
[1:49:42] that he was at his work but he chose
[1:49:45] deliberately to stay at home
[1:49:49] and to watch the sermon of power on the
[1:49:54] window
[1:49:57] they sat in a window a certain young man
[1:50:01] named you tickers being
[1:50:04] fallen into a water
[1:50:08] those that are streaming online
[1:50:11] if you can get the vaccine go
[1:50:14] get your vaccine
[1:50:18] if you can use your mask
[1:50:21] and come to church because none of you
[1:50:25] stop going to work but if the emergency
[1:50:29] situation has been removed and you still
[1:50:33] choose
[1:50:34] to stay at home when the church is
[1:50:37] open the window have an access
[1:50:41] to a spirit of death
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:48] being fallen in a deep sleep and as
[1:50:52] paul was long preaching he sunk
[1:50:55] down with sleep and fell down from the
[1:50:59] third loft
[1:51:00] and was taken up by who he didn't want
[1:51:03] to sit in the sanctuary
[1:51:06] amen he chose to stay home
[1:51:09] because there is a storm outside he
[1:51:12] chose to stay
[1:51:13] home because he feel too tired there is
[1:51:16] no sacrifice
[1:51:18] and the people have been staying at home
[1:51:21] under the false reason of pandemic
[1:51:25] even though the vaccine is dead they
[1:51:27] don't want to get vaccinated
[1:51:29] because they got used to that sleeping
[1:51:32] spirit
[1:51:36] they can go to ahmad they can go to our
[1:51:39] green
[1:51:39] they can go to their work the last thing
[1:51:42] that they want to think of
[1:51:44] is coming to the church you talk to them
[1:51:46] there is a pandemic going on
[1:51:48] there is also a vaccine out there
[1:51:51] power went down and fell on him
[1:51:54] and impressed him thank god for grace
[1:51:57] trouble not yourself
[1:51:59] for his life is in him and when he
[1:52:02] therefore
[1:52:02] was come up again and has broken the
[1:52:05] bread
[1:52:06] and eaten and talked a long while even
[1:52:09] till break day of the day
[1:52:11] so he deported and they brought the
[1:52:13] young men alive
[1:52:14] his name means fortunate and they
[1:52:16] brought the young man alive
[1:52:18] and were not a little comforted in other
[1:52:21] words he got his resurrection
[1:52:23] what i'm saying this is a window
[1:52:27] is used in case of emergency
[1:52:30] if you have a legitimate reason you can
[1:52:34] use the window
[1:52:35] but if your reason is not legitimate
[1:52:39] you better check your heart because when
[1:52:42] jesus
[1:52:43] invited the people to the feast the
[1:52:45] reason that was given to jesus were all
[1:52:49] legitimate reason and yet jesus
[1:52:52] was not pleased with legitimate reason
[1:52:55] because it was a way for them to escape
[1:52:58] it's a way
[1:52:59] to stay at home and don't come to church
[1:53:02] because the window
[1:53:03] is open paul was preaching the church
[1:53:06] was open
[1:53:07] but this young man chose not to be in
[1:53:10] church
[1:53:11] but to sat on the window and death got
[1:53:14] him there because the window
[1:53:15] is a door that can bring the club and it
[1:53:19] is also a door
[1:53:20] that can bring the dog everybody clear
[1:53:22] so far
[1:53:23] paul preached longer now heavenly father
[1:53:27] we are thankful for the blood of christ
[1:53:30] and many sometimes
[1:53:32] praise god that that servant lord
[1:53:35] does not use water by speaking water
[1:53:41] but i may fail like paul that preached
[1:53:44] all night one night
[1:53:46] a little fellow fell out on the window
[1:53:48] and got killed
[1:53:49] and that apostle with the word of god in
[1:53:52] his life
[1:53:53] went and led his body over the boy life
[1:53:56] came in him
[1:53:57] and he lived again brother branham is
[1:53:59] saying here that
[1:54:01] sometimes he speaks so long out of a
[1:54:04] lack of
[1:54:06] wisdom
[1:54:09] brother stephen say amen to that
[1:54:12] paul preached this same gospel
[1:54:15] all night and somebody fell
[1:54:19] out in the upper story window
[1:54:22] and kill himself and paul lay his body
[1:54:25] on
[1:54:26] he come back to life again many of us
[1:54:30] sat up and watched the leg show
[1:54:34] and we go to dances and parties
[1:54:37] and stay oh but
[1:54:40] if the preacher is over 20 minutes
[1:54:44] i shall never go back again
[1:54:48] our hearts and right with god
[1:54:51] our soul feeding on something else
[1:54:54] beside
[1:54:55] who we are balancing the two
[1:54:58] we cannot keep the people longer but we
[1:55:01] also need to give god a sacrifice
[1:55:05] i know it's a little late
[1:55:08] but remember the day our boss asked us
[1:55:11] to work a little water
[1:55:14] oh what you agree with it
[1:55:17] you even look for over time because
[1:55:20] you're gonna get more money
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:28] amen i'm saying amen to all three courts
[1:55:34] amen they want you to work a little
[1:55:37] overtime
[1:55:38] or something what about the worship of
[1:55:41] the lord
[1:55:42] many times they preach all night in the
[1:55:45] bible
[1:55:46] time a little time for god
[1:55:49] you get upset
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:55] you can go to a party five hours
[1:55:59] and he won't do you any good amen
[1:56:03] verily verily i say unto you he the
[1:56:06] emperor if not by the water
[1:56:10] in the sheepfold but climb up some other
[1:56:13] way
[1:56:14] the same is the word and the water
[1:56:18] the one who uses the window is a fifth
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:26] jesus
[1:56:29] except if you use it in the case of
[1:56:32] emergency
[1:56:36] hallelujah but he died entering
[1:56:40] by the door is the shepherd of the ship
[1:56:45] the window is used by who a fifth and
[1:56:54] water
[1:56:57] i'm sorry i gotta say it because you
[1:57:00] keep coming
[1:57:01] god say when you don't pay your taxes
[1:57:05] [Applause]
[1:57:08] and you don't pay your offering you are
[1:57:11] if you are robbing god
[1:57:14] i hope you when you're on the window
[1:57:18] you're paying your offering and your
[1:57:20] tithe
[1:57:22] joe 2 verse 9 they shall run
[1:57:26] 2 and 4 in the sin the city
[1:57:29] they shall run upon the wall they shall
[1:57:33] climb up
[1:57:33] upon their houses they shall enter in
[1:57:37] at the water like a water
[1:57:44] everybody clear jeremiah 9 21
[1:57:48] for who death is come up into our world
[1:57:54] that's why this boy lost his life
[1:57:58] sitting on the window when the door of
[1:58:01] the church was open
[1:58:02] he preferred to sit on the window
[1:58:05] listening to the sermon
[1:58:07] instead of coming in he didn't know that
[1:58:10] death uses also the window
[1:58:12] just like the dove can come out of the
[1:58:14] window the crow also
[1:58:16] will come into the window for death
[1:58:20] he's come up into our windows and he's
[1:58:23] entered our water death
[1:58:27] get access on the window
[1:58:30] and once he gets on the window he is
[1:58:33] going to invade the house
[1:58:37] to cut off the word
[1:58:42] is everybody saying thing
[1:58:45] death is looking for a way to come to
[1:58:49] your house
[1:58:50] death doesn't know how to come to your
[1:58:52] house
[1:58:54] hollywood is looking for a way to come
[1:58:57] to your house
[1:58:59] hollywood doesn't have access to the
[1:59:01] house
[1:59:02] that's why brother brother say that we
[1:59:06] used to go
[1:59:07] to the movie theater to watch
[1:59:10] movie but the devil took television
[1:59:14] and broadened to your home it is a

[1:59:26] coming after the water
[1:59:28] the children your internet

[1:59:45] houses
[1:59:46] to cut off the children from without
[1:59:50] and the young men from the water that's
[1:59:52] why the one that struggle
[1:59:54] the most with our cell phone

[2:14:15] is giving his expression just like adam
[2:14:19] salomon what pleases you on your wife
[2:14:26] you ready behold you are fair my love
[2:14:34] you are fair in other words you are
[2:14:37] beautiful

[2:14:43] the first thing
[2:14:46] can i raise the top you keep that in
[2:14:48] mind
[2:14:50] the first thing that solomon
[2:14:55] sits on his wife is welcome
[2:15:01] everybody clear the first thing
[2:15:05] is the eyes in proverbs 6
[2:15:12] you follow me you found me the scripture
[2:15:15] says
[2:15:17] last not after her beauty
[2:15:20] neither be that taken by what
[2:15:24] and that woman was a strange woman
[2:15:27] she was a bad woman when solomon
[2:15:31] sings the tsunami the first thing that
[2:15:35] cut solomon
[2:15:36] is the eyes and we know that a holla
[2:15:40] and a holly bar painted the water
[2:15:45] everybody following me everybody awake
[2:15:50] the tsunami woman does not have
[2:15:54] only eyes
[2:15:58] but her eyes is the eyes of a dove
[2:16:05] what does dove represent
[2:16:09] can you say it out
[2:16:16] everybody here solomon say
[2:16:19] be careful of a strange woman don't let
[2:16:22] her pick you up by her eyes
[2:16:27] eyes prophetic don't let her
[2:16:30] pick you up by eyes eyes prophetic
[2:16:34] jezebel a prophetess
[2:16:38] you follow me jezebel a prophetess isaac
[2:16:43] malachi for a prophet also
[2:16:47] isaac are you following me when he sees
[2:16:51] the woman the eyes called him solomon
[2:16:54] said
[2:16:54] be careful on the eyes of a woman
[2:16:58] everybody clear everybody clear when
[2:17:01] solomon looked at the tsunami
[2:17:02] the eyes cut him but he said no the eyes
[2:17:05] of the tournament
[2:17:07] are the eyes of a dove they are the eyes
[2:17:10] that have water
[2:17:16] hallelujah and each one
[2:17:20] you are looking your eye is the gate to
[2:17:23] your water
[2:17:28] so when solomon look at the eyes
[2:17:32] he's getting a preview of the soul
[2:17:36] of the tournament
[2:17:43] i wish i had time everybody follow me
[2:17:47] are we okay if you okay say amen
[2:17:50] praise god your eye is the gate
[2:17:54] to your soul you can look at it
[2:17:58] it's almost governed the other senses in
[2:18:01] other words the eyes dominate
[2:18:02] the other senses that's why when you
[2:18:05] blind into trouble
[2:18:07] everybody clear me clear you look at
[2:18:11] it before you taste before you taste
[2:18:14] something you already seen it
[2:18:16] you look at it before you smell
[2:18:19] you feel it and so forth it's usually
[2:18:23] the eye
[2:18:24] is the gate to the weapon and if you
[2:18:28] could only let
[2:18:29] that be a blessing to you when you see
[2:18:32] with your own eyes
[2:18:33] here with your own ear the lord jesus
[2:18:36] moving among the people
[2:18:38] and doing things that he has been doing
[2:18:40] it should have made you
[2:18:41] have real faith in other words you come
[2:18:44] to church
[2:18:45] they pray for somebody and he begin to
[2:18:47] walk automatically that seeing
[2:18:49] built faith to you ever clear
[2:18:53] in psalm chapter 74 david says this
[2:18:57] all delivered not the soul of
[2:19:00] thy water so brother
[2:19:03] david says that a christian
[2:19:07] have a soul of a dove
[2:19:15] and that soul is reflected
[2:19:18] in the world so when solomon
[2:19:22] sees the woman salomon first
[2:19:25] look and say wow she is a christian
[2:19:30] are you following me that's why solomon
[2:19:33] keeps saying

[2:19:37] my sister my spouse first
[2:19:40] a sister damn a spouse
[2:19:44] you cannot get married to a woman that
[2:19:47] is not christian
[2:19:49] solomon look in the eyes and say she's a
[2:19:52] believer
[2:19:53] she have darvish hallelujah

[2:27:18] what is going on with the eyes brought
[2:27:20] upon him in question and answer
[2:27:22] somebody is teaching brother branham
[2:27:24] something brother venom comes and they
[2:27:26] were selling cows
[2:27:28] and when brother branham came he looked
[2:27:30] he said look at this cow he's big he's

[2:27:58] in the world they thought brother
[2:28:01] branham they said when you
[2:28:02] look at the cow don't look at how
[2:28:05] beautiful
[2:28:06] a cow is check the eyes of that cow
[2:28:11] they said brother branham do you see
[2:28:13] that stare in the eyes

[2:28:20] because that stair tells you
[2:28:23] what is under
[2:28:26] i say yeah say her children
[2:28:31] the children of that cow and her
[2:28:33] grandchildren
[2:28:35] and her great great grandchildren will
[2:28:38] still have that same white white
[2:28:42] it is genetics
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:47] mama had a struggle in the marriage
[2:28:50] watch out is coming to the kids
[2:28:53] that's why brother branham told that man
[2:28:55] he said
[2:28:56] if he's not born again don't let him
[2:28:59] marry
[2:28:59] because he's going to be held to this
[2:29:01] woman
[2:29:07] they shall run themselves poor
[2:29:11] can't keep money they shall never be a
[2:29:15] mother
[2:29:15] to their cows you never
[2:29:18] could fatten them they shall never make
[2:29:21] beef
[2:29:22] look at this calf here that is sold
[2:29:25] brother bran
[2:29:26] look how gentle she looks look that
[2:29:29] at that peaceful water it's in the face
[2:29:33] in the ice that kind of look
[2:29:37] no still in her eyes she shall be a real
[2:29:41] mummy to her calf
[2:29:43] to a calf calf and to the calf and calf
[2:29:46] will continue to be that way
[2:29:48] they shall all be they shall all of them
[2:29:52] be mummies
[2:29:53] if they can get the right kind of
[2:29:55] breeding the right kind of husband
[2:29:58] bull that bull to that calf she shall
[2:30:01] make her
[2:30:02] their children but that scary look
[2:30:05] in the face will always make a poor herd
[2:30:08] of caddo
[2:30:09] if a man is trying to buy cardo i say
[2:30:13] yes sir thank you they taught by the
[2:30:16] problem something
[2:30:17] and the same thing applied by water
[2:30:22] you understand why solomon say watch the
[2:30:24] eyes
[2:30:26] you take one of them painted face and
[2:30:30] water
[2:30:32] look like some kind of animal
[2:30:35] trying to disfugue herself from a human
[2:30:39] being
[2:30:39] she shall never make anything she shall
[2:30:43] run
[2:30:43] all the time christianity is not
[2:30:47] beauty on the water it is on the water
[2:30:51] solomon say the ice is the eyes of water
[2:30:55] reflecting the soul of the woman
[2:31:01] it's on the inside of a what
[2:31:04] does what dove
[2:31:07] adorned themselves in a peaceful quiet
[2:31:11] spirit
[2:31:11] dove which is a great place before god
[2:31:15] that is what we want to look for on what
[2:31:20] and on what and whoever
[2:31:23] look at the young men in the eyes
[2:31:27] you see him like this
[2:31:30] are you there and i said why you always
[2:31:35] look at that car in the face i said she
[2:31:38] looked all right
[2:31:39] good healthy cow said i want to tell you
[2:31:42] boy
[2:31:43] you got a lot to learn and i realized it
[2:31:46] after he told me and i don't care
[2:31:50] how she's made up she might be a beef
[2:31:53] plum to the hoof but if she got that
[2:31:56] wild stare
[2:31:57] in her face don't ever buy her
[2:32:01] why so jeff well say
[2:32:04] the first thing is she shall never stay
[2:32:08] put
[2:32:10] number two the next thing she shall
[2:32:12] never be a mummy to her calf
[2:32:15] they put her in a pen now
[2:32:18] the reason she is welcome she is fat
[2:32:22] because she's controlled by the law the
[2:32:25] message say don't do this
[2:32:27] the message say don't do this she's
[2:32:29] doing that because of the message
[2:32:31] that's why she looks good if you take
[2:32:34] the message off
[2:32:36] you're gonna see the first thing she
[2:32:37] start wearing paintings
[2:32:40] [Applause]
[2:32:42] everybody clear the reason she's fat you
[2:32:45] turn
[2:32:46] her loose take the message off
[2:32:49] where if that was there she shall run
[2:32:52] herself to water
[2:32:55] you know i kind of learned something i
[2:32:58] believe that applied to water
[2:33:00] the word sterile look
[2:33:04] better stay away from her boy all
[2:33:07] that there blew stuff over the top of
[2:33:10] her eyes a holy bar
[2:33:11] i would want that i don't think that is
[2:33:14] becoming to a christian
[2:33:16] i don't care how much the television and
[2:33:19] peppa
[2:33:19] say it's pretty it is the most horrible
[2:33:22] looking
[2:33:23] hidden side that i ever seen in my water
[2:33:27] everybody clear so far let's go back to
[2:33:29] proverbs chapter 4.
[2:33:32] i thought i'm gonna get too hidden let
[2:33:35] me see if i can hit this and we go
[2:33:36] amen we were on first four your water
[2:33:41] neck we right here now anybody clear
[2:33:45] your neck is like the tower of david
[2:33:50] built for an armory where on they hang
[2:33:54] a thousand buckler or sheet of water
[2:33:59] david solomon is saying that your neck
[2:34:03] is like a place the tower of david and
[2:34:06] the tower of david
[2:34:07] is a place they were coming and hanging
[2:34:10] stuff
[2:34:11] in other words it looks like your neck
[2:34:14] is a place where you can put her
[2:34:20] but in david tower they were putting
[2:34:23] thousands of necklaces
[2:34:26] so sister do you need to put thousands
[2:34:28] of necklaces hold off
[2:34:30] let's see what the scripture says and
[2:34:31] what brother branham says
[2:34:35] everybody clear let's go verse 5
[2:34:39] your breasts are like too young
[2:34:43] rose she's a young woman
[2:34:46] that are twins which feed among the
[2:34:49] water
[2:34:51] solomon is here your breasts
[2:34:54] everybody clear everybody clear he's
[2:34:57] right
[2:34:58] here on the chest and the breast is what
[2:35:01] differentiate a woman
[2:35:03] grown from a man everybody clear
[2:35:06] so salomon is giving us that's a woman
[2:35:08] it is not a man
[2:35:09] i'm not marrying a man amen
[2:35:13] until the break
[2:35:16] did salomon say something about her
[2:35:19] belly
[2:35:21] did solomon say something about her hip
[2:35:25] did solomon say something about her legs
[2:35:28] did solomon say something about her feet
[2:35:32] solomon stopped at the poetry
[2:35:38] and jezebel gave jehu the portrait
[2:35:43] jezebel understood that the poetry
[2:35:47] is enough to make a man collapse
[2:35:52] follow me that's why your facebook
[2:35:56] doesn't do what they do
[2:35:57] by any chance they knew what they were
[2:36:00] doing
[2:36:01] you don't know what they were doing your
[2:36:04] whatsapp
[2:36:05] knew what they were loading your
[2:36:07] instagram studied these things
[2:36:13] by just this picture solomon
[2:36:16] is fired up he even forget about
[2:36:20] the other part jezebel
[2:36:24] didn't need to show their legs she just
[2:36:28] gave
[2:36:28] the poetry it's enough to draft the man
[2:36:31] crazy
[2:36:35] facebook whatsapp instagram
[2:36:38] amen now solomon just stopping here
[2:36:42] he is now reacting the window of jesus
[2:36:48] verse six until the daybreak
[2:36:51] and the shadow free will i will get me
[2:36:54] to the mountain of water
[2:37:00] may represent water may represent
[2:37:04] what
[2:37:07] death anybody clear come on
[2:37:11] verse 2 continue and to the heel of what
[2:37:17] frankincense
[2:37:22] brother benjamin when
[2:37:25] the three major came
[2:37:31] to worship jesus they brought how many
[2:37:34] things
[2:37:36] three what is the first one
[2:37:40] gold which type of what
[2:37:45] deity what was the second one what is
[2:37:48] the third one
[2:37:49] and frankie says means water in service
[2:37:53] priesthood they brought jesus gold
[2:37:58] deity mer and frankincense
[2:38:02] which was speaking that jesus was
[2:38:05] deity in service to die
[2:38:10] make sense make sense so when
[2:38:14] solomon sees that sudamat
[2:38:17] he got so enthused
[2:38:21] with this love until he was
[2:38:24] ready to die for the tournament
[2:38:28] he was ready to take a service
[2:38:32] and die for the tsunami
[2:38:35] and he says i must climb on a mountain
[2:38:40] i must clamp on a hill i must clamp on
[2:38:44] the mountain
[2:38:45] in service to death that's what jesus
[2:38:49] did for his bride he clamped on the
[2:38:52] mountain
[2:38:53] of gethsemane of golgotha doing
[2:38:56] service to die for his bride
[2:39:01] [Applause]
[2:39:03] next episode next session
[2:39:07] solomon was a type of christ looking at
[2:39:10] his bride
[2:39:12] and he seen his blood naturally

[2:41:58] how many chances sister can have
[2:42:04] brother branham how many chains can we
[2:42:06] get
[2:42:08] the message is perfectly in line
[2:42:12] with the scripture
[2:42:16] brother branham should a christian woman
[2:42:19] wear
[2:42:19] what what as
[2:42:22] necklace water because
[2:42:26] they already told us that our neck is
[2:42:28] like the neck of the tower of david
[2:42:31] so we can load ourselves brother branama
[2:42:37] well sister i know this mean a lot to
[2:42:40] you
[2:42:40] and it means a lot for me for you to
[2:42:43] place your confidence
[2:42:44] i tell you the truth now remember the
[2:42:46] bible says
[2:42:47] when you water do not announce
[2:42:51] with costly jew we went to this and
[2:42:53] pearl and all kind of wearing jewelry
[2:42:56] but let that be the adorning of what the
[2:42:59] eyes the dove
[2:43:00] a quiet and a mixed spirit just coded
[2:43:03] which is a great press before the lord i
[2:43:06] don't mean
[2:43:07] that but i don't mean by that sister
[2:43:10] that
[2:43:10] if you had the pin and this is me
[2:43:13] not the water who said that in the bible
[2:43:18] the message is water with water
[2:43:23] if you had a pin that you want to wear
[2:43:27] or air hey how many
[2:43:32] how many little what
[2:43:36] that's your water how many necklaces did
[2:43:39] the tsunami
[2:43:40] have the message is perfectly in line
[2:43:43] with the scripture
[2:43:48] one that your husband gives you or maybe
[2:43:51] or something like that you will now to
[2:43:54] me
[2:43:54] i don't think that's bad did brother
[2:43:56] branham give you the scripture
[2:43:59] that is just me now remember i make
[2:44:02] myself clear
[2:44:03] that is my what did you find where
[2:44:06] or the prophet opinion came from is he
[2:44:10] the prophet opinion
[2:44:12] so you learn that when brother branham
[2:44:14] say my opinion
[2:44:15] you better open your eyes because it's a
[2:44:18] prophetic
[2:44:19] message amen
[2:44:22] but i think it's the approach to it it's
[2:44:25] the way you do it
[2:44:27] it's the motive behind it jezebel
[2:44:30] and when you see it getting a hold of
[2:44:33] you
[2:44:33] then do not leave the thing alone but i
[2:44:36] think
[2:44:37] i think if you would wear your wedding
[2:44:40] ring
[2:44:41] but a fig is as far as air
[2:44:44] how many if you go to water
[2:44:48] loading yourself up brother branham now
[2:44:50] he's talking about the tower of
[2:44:52] david that's not the tower of david
[2:44:55] you can't go loading yourself up sister
[2:44:58] if you got to loading yourself up
[2:45:01] you went through the 10th store down
[2:45:03] there with a magnet on you
[2:45:06] excuse that i didn't mean to say that
[2:45:08] like that
[2:45:09] but that is water it is not a tower of
[2:45:12] death it is like
[2:45:14] a tower of david but you don't load
[2:45:17] too much if your husband want to give
[2:45:19] you how many
[2:45:21] and it must be how
[2:45:26] everybody clear everybody clear
[2:45:30] what time is it
[2:45:35] i gotta stop i gotta let you go
[2:45:39] when god created adam
[2:45:44] he created adam by the spoken way
[2:45:47] adam pop up then adam
[2:45:51] was living and they found that it was
[2:45:53] not good for men to be water
[2:45:56] alone thank god now god

[2:46:03] to sleep
[2:46:04] he pulled a rib and manufacture who
[2:46:08] who made evil
[2:46:11] who created eve why
