TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; The fig tree provided the clothing when it was not time for the clothing. &gt;&gt; And God asked the fig tree to provide fruit when it was not time for the fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Time or not, you need to provide it &gt;&gt; because he was the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you do everything and you can't catch anything, he's still that season. &gt;&gt; That season that can create the fishes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When man fell, nature fell. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the trees were still trees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There were still trees. There was still alive. But it was a chaos that enter into he. But what you want to understand, God rebuked the wind. &gt;&gt; He rebuked the water. And he also rebuked his disciples. And the reason why he rebuked them because he already gave them power before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To master all circumstances. So while he was resting, they should have taken things in charge. &gt;&gt; They should be in charge and say, you know what, he's sleeping. Let leave the Lord sleep. Let's handle this storm ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] Amen. [cheering] And do you know the good thing about God? &gt;&gt; Do you know the good thing about God? He knows us very well. &gt;&gt; He knows that when I'm around, they will come and poke me &gt;&gt; and they will come and wake me up. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham is around, everybody will travel to Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one. &gt;&gt; If Brother Brham remain alive. Every day we will have a prayer line in Jeffersonville. Everybody trying to even touch him. People will come all over the world trying to see brother Branam. God say I know what to do. He takes brother Brham out. He takes Jesus Christ out. So now you can be in charge. [cheering] Now you can look within yourself and look AT THE SOURCE THAT IS IN YOU [cheering] AND DRAW WATER FROM YOURSELF to handle the situation because God has confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's like a child who's d uh who's learning how to drive. He always depend on another driver to be there. But one of these day you're going to drive yourself. &gt;&gt; And guess what? The more you drive yourself, &gt;&gt; the more you become better. &gt;&gt; And the more you learn things that no one will teach you, but experience will begin to teach you. And it won't be daddy around. It won't be mommy around. You will BE YOURSELF ON THE HIGHWAY. And before YOU KNOW IT, IF YOU WERE TOO SCARED, AFTER A WHILE, FEAR BEGIN TO REMOVE. [cheering] FEAR BEGIN TO GO. NOW YOU BEGIN TO HAVE CONFIDENCE. YOU BEGIN TO PICK UP THE CELL PHONE AND YOU CAN TALK WHILE YOU DRIVING. AT THE BEGINNING, YOU WERE LIKE THIS. AFTER A WHILE, YOU BEGIN to relax. After a while, you begin to relax. After a while, you begin to relax. AFTER A WHILE, YOU BEGIN TO DO THIS. Some will BEGIN TO DO THIS. THAT'S WHAT GOD IS EXPECTING FROM YOU. AT THE BEGINNING YOU WERE TREMBLING. BUT NOW WHEN THE SITUATION COME IN YOUR LIFE, [cheering] YOU DON'T PANIC. YOU ARE STABLE. YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT. YOU SAY, "I SEEN IT BEFORE." BECAUSE it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. God bless you, my brother. [applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. May you stand &gt;&gt; be stable in the midst of the storm. &gt;&gt; You were expecting you're waiting on heaven and heaven is waiting on you. &gt;&gt; Heaven is waiting. He say well according to the commission that was given they need to bind first &gt;&gt; then we will bind. &gt;&gt; But you don't bind. Heaven is just sitting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel are going to sleep &gt;&gt; because you don't give them work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to make the angel I mean do some work sir. &gt;&gt; In the morning you bind &gt;&gt; when you working you binding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't just bind the demon. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the Holy Spirit was also bound. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bind your blessings. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WELL. OKAY. B YOUR BLESSING. I SAY YOU HAPPINESS. YOU REMAIN IN THIS HOME. I BIND YOU TO THIS HOME. [cheering] I BIND YOU TO THIS MARRIAGE. THIS MARRIAGE IS CALLED HAPPINESS. THIS CHURCH IS CALLED PEACE. HAPPINESS. JOHN, &gt;&gt; LET'S B WHAT IS RIGHT FOR US. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Close your eyes and take some minute and bind what belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bind evil spirit out of your home &gt;&gt; and bind what is good in your house.
