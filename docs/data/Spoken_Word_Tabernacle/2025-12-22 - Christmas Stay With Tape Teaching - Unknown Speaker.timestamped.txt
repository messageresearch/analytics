[0:07] [music]
[0:17] I have something that I want to talk
[0:19] about briefly. I don't know how long
[0:21] it's going to take me, but as a
[0:24] shepherd, I have to talk about it from
[0:27] the pulpit. And uh if he rob you the
[0:30] wrong way, I do not have any choice. But
[0:34] as a shepherd, I'm responsible to the
[0:36] church that the Lord put me. Every
[0:39] church is sovereign. [snorts]
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Uh so I need to talk to my church
[0:46] visible and my church invisible. Are we
[0:50] together?
[0:50] &gt;&gt; So give me one one uh minute. Let me
[0:53] work with this as the devil has been
[0:56] attacking since this morning. left and
[0:58] right, but by God's grace, all is well.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Let me go to the slide.
[1:04] It's 963.
[1:07] Let's see if we can get there. Brother
[1:09] Aaron, don't scream.
[1:16] It's slide 963.
[1:20] Okay,
[1:21] let's see. All right,
[1:26] buddy. you know, go ahead and connect
[1:27] this. I need these quotes so everybody
[1:30] can read them correctly. I want to make
[1:32] sure we clear on that one. Give us some
[1:36] few second and then we go from there.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41] It's going to work.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; I got you in season or out of season. So
[1:46] whether there is trouble or not, we will
[1:49] shoot it. And I know what is coming up.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil has been doing
[1:54] that. He tried this morning. They came
[1:57] they say the water was frozen and by
[1:59] God's grace the water is working.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; So now we move from the water and then
[2:02] my monitor was not working. Then they
[2:04] fix it. Then the monitor is working.
[2:06] Then he jump from the monitor to the
[2:08] computer. So somebody is trying to
[2:10] trouble but everything will be okay. So
[2:15] let's see if it's uh that's 9 30. Let's
[2:20] see what comes up. Okay. The screen is a
[2:22] little bit smaller than I wanted, but
[2:24] let's work with this. Amen.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:28] In the hotel, we cover Christmas.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Can you put your seat belt?
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. In a hotel, we cover Christmas.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; And for some reason, by God's grace, the
[2:44] Lord lead us during the time of
[2:47] Christmas. I don't prepare this sermon
[2:49] like this is going to be preached on
[2:51] Christmas or whatever because God is
[2:53] maneuvering things differently.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; So the Lord made it happen that closer
[2:59] to Christmas, we ended up dealing with
[3:02] the fathered calf
[3:04] &gt;&gt; and Bale and Jezebel and took Christmas
[3:07] from the root of it.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; If you still have a problem with that,
[3:12] that's between you and the Lord.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:15] &gt;&gt; And then we pull it from there. Then the
[3:18] following Sunday I gave some
[3:20] chemotherapy.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:24] &gt;&gt; But as believers in this church are
[3:28] evangelist,
[3:29] some are sharing the messages and things
[3:33] and they are going left and right. And
[3:35] when the message are going back and
[3:37] forth, it's raising up also
[3:41] &gt;&gt; uh spirit and it's uh disturbing people
[3:45] &gt;&gt; because uh we trying to get the lollipop
[3:48] out of their mouth.
[3:52] [cheering]
[3:53] &gt;&gt; The people don't want to be free from
[3:54] tradition.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; We only quot
[4:02] the other code. In this church, we take
[4:04] everything
[4:08] &gt;&gt; and we don't believe THERE IS A
[4:09] CONTRADICTION
[4:11] SIR
[4:11] &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE of brother Brham.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Not at all.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:18] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brham is the one who say
[4:21] celebrating Christmas
[4:23] &gt;&gt; it's a worship of devil.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE COAT.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; And matter OF FACT, EVERY COAT I give it
[4:32] to you. Amen.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE STILL HAVE A HARD TIME
[4:36] CHEWING THAT ONE.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; So somebody send me a response
[4:43] &gt;&gt; from the people. They say, "Well,
[4:47] &gt;&gt; they send me an article.
[4:50] Please follow me carefully.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; You online, repeat my word
[4:55] &gt;&gt; and don't cut me short.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Start where I started.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; I don't have a choice. I cannot back up.
[5:02] I have to say what I want to say.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? I don't have any
[5:08] choice. I'm under commission.
[5:10] [screaming] I got to do the work that
[5:12] God put me TO DO.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[5:17] &gt;&gt; So, they send the person an article
[5:20] written by brother Brham's children
[5:24] &gt;&gt; describing how they were doing uh
[5:28] celebrating Christmas.
[5:31] And they also sent me a photo showing
[5:34] brother Billy Paul
[5:36] &gt;&gt; giving gift
[5:37] &gt;&gt; of Christmas.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this name [clears throat]
[5:41] because this thing these things are not
[5:43] secret.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; They all over the internet.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:48] &gt;&gt; So they say let's see what brother
[5:50] Steven will say about it.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Now spoken word
[5:56] &gt;&gt; visible and invisible.
[5:58] Follow me carefully.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Number one, BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAD
[6:06] TO grow
[6:11] &gt;&gt; with the message.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to help you up for the rest of
[6:16] your life.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM OWN CHILDREN HAD to grow
[6:20] with the message.
[6:22] And not only growing but brother brand
[6:25] ammon children had to have the
[6:27] REVELATION
[6:29] &gt;&gt; of the message. [cheering]
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:36] &gt;&gt; HIS OWN FAMILY HAD TO grow
[6:39] &gt;&gt; and his own family had to have a
[6:42] revelation. I know somehow allergic
[6:45] &gt;&gt; when I begin to touch these things.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. But I don't have any choice.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I know where I'm
[6:52] heading. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY
[6:54] HAVE TO GROW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
[6:55] ABOUT, BROTHER STEVEN? I mean, turn your
[6:58] timer off. I have not started my
[7:00] message.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM IS PREACHING in 1933.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; I'm picking UP AN EXAMPLE.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE BROTHER BRANDHAM
[7:12] FAMILY to dress
[7:13] &gt;&gt; 1933
[7:15] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO 1933?
[7:18] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[7:18] &gt;&gt; DID BROTHER BRHAM PREACH IN 1960?
[7:22] &gt;&gt; DID HE PREACH IN 1959?
[7:24] &gt;&gt; DID HE PREACH THE SEVEN SEAL?
[7:26] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF BROTHER
[7:29] BRANDHAM family and YOU WANT TO UH
[7:32] SUPPORT YOUR BAD DRESSING,
[7:37] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THAT HERE.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; YES [cheering] SIR.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HEAR PEOPLE WEAR MAS OH. OH.
[7:44] WHAT? SISTER MIDA'S DRESS OR SKIRT WAS
[7:48] MAYBE HERE AT WHICH YEAR?
[7:50] &gt;&gt; WHICH YEAR?
[7:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON, LORD.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF BROTHER BRHAM SPOKE ABOUT THE
[7:57] IF BROTHER BRANDHAM spoke about the
[7:59] skirt in 1957,
[8:02] HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
[8:05] &gt;&gt; IN 1933 TO DRESS ACCORDING TO 1957?
[8:11] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[8:12] &gt;&gt; So you need to BE PATIENT
[8:15] &gt;&gt; WITH BROTHER BRAHAM FAMILY
[8:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GROW
[8:20] &gt;&gt; AS THE MESSAGE WAS COMING.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; WE ARE DIFFERENT. WE GET EVERYTHING IN
[8:25] THE BOOK [cheering]
[8:26] [applause]
[8:27] &gt;&gt; OVER THERE. THEY HAVE TO GO STEP BY
[8:29] STEP. SO YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT WITH THE
[8:33] FAMILY. AMEN.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached the seals
[8:39] &gt;&gt; and HE CONDEMNED SOMETHING.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU go and condemn brother Billy
[8:44] Paul in 1952
[8:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SEALS WERE NOT BROKEN YET.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT they can.
[8:53] IN OTHER WORD, NO EXCUSE
[8:57] &gt;&gt; SHOULD BE TAKEN UPON THE BRHAM FAMILY
[9:01] &gt;&gt; TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE
[9:04] TEACHING OF THE MESSAGE.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we clear.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; I KNOW I'M TOUCHING SORE SPOTS,
[9:11] &gt;&gt; but I don't have any choices.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And I'm saying this
[9:16] with a LOT OF CONSIDERATION and respect.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; We clear. We love brother Brandham. We
[9:22] love his family but we must say the
[9:24] truth
[9:26] &gt;&gt; and the TRUTH MUST SET YOU FREE. ARE WE
[9:28] TOGETHER?
[9:29] &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAVE TO GROW.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAVE TO HAVE
[9:36] THE PERSONAL REVELATION OF THE MESSAGE
[9:39] THAT THEIR FATHER WAS PREACHING.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRHAM IN 1963 HE SAY
[9:46] INTELLECTUALLY THEY are receiving the
[9:48] message. AND BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "NOW
[9:50] YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND."
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So the people were there following
[9:55] brother Brandham, but they didn't catch
[9:56] what brother Brandham was saying.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Why are you saying this? Because
[10:05] somebody gave an article. Sister Rebecca
[10:08] said this and brother Billy Paul was
[10:10] giving her cards.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; That was the first approach.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; The second approach is this.
[10:21] This is the hard one.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; In the book of Act, Paul preached his
[10:28] message.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN PAUL FINISHED HIS MESSAGE,
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Paul knew that he had to die
[10:38] &gt;&gt; and he needed to go
[10:40] &gt;&gt; and they're going to kill him. So now
[10:43] Paul called the elders
[10:47] &gt;&gt; in Ephesus
[10:49] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL BEGIN TO TALK TO THEM
[10:51] &gt;&gt; knowing that he's going to be gone.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:57] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE BOOK OF ACT PAUL SAYS this in
[11:01] verse 27. AND I HAVE NOT sh
[11:05] &gt;&gt; to DECLARE UNTO YOU SOME OF THE COUNSEL
[11:09] OF GOD.
[11:13] How many concert?
[11:15] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, PAUL GAVE EVERYTHING
[11:19] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; THE ENTIRE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GOD WILL
[11:29] NEVER TAKE YOU OUT
[11:31] &gt;&gt; IF HE HAS NOT FINISHED YOUR JOB.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; IF PAUL IS TAKEN OUT, IT MEANS HIS JOB
[11:37] IS FINISHED.
[11:38] AND THE SAME APPLY TO BROTHER
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Brham
[11:43] &gt;&gt; for returning ministry people.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[11:47] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THE BIBLE SAY
[11:50] TAKE HEED. This is Paul saying therefore
[11:53] unto yourself
[11:55] &gt;&gt; AND TO ALL THE FLOCK
[11:58] &gt;&gt; of the which the Holy Spirit has made
[12:01] you OVERSEER
[12:03] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? feed the church of God
[12:06] &gt;&gt; WHICH HE HAS PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN
[12:08] BLOOD.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; For I know
[12:14] &gt;&gt; this. What do YOU KNOW, PAUL?
[12:17] &gt;&gt; THAT AFTER MY DEPARTING
[12:20] &gt;&gt; SHALL GRIEVOUS wolf
[12:22] &gt;&gt; enter in among you.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL ALREADY SEEN THEM LOOKING AROUND
[12:28] THE CHURCHES.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WAITING FOR PAUL TO GO. THEN
[12:32] THEY MAKE THE ENTRANCE.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAY, "LISTEN, I ALREADY GAVE
[12:36] YOU THE FULL PACKAGE OF GOD.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT EVERYTHING."
[12:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL COME IN.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; FOLLOW.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "After my departing shall
[12:47] grieve wolf enter in which brother
[12:50] Brandham say was a nicolatan spirit,
[12:53] &gt;&gt; NOT SPARING THE FLOCK." That's the first
[12:56] aspect. according to the first aspect.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; It is people from outside.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Getting into
[13:08] &gt;&gt; the rank.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Now look at verse two.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Look at the B which is the the WORST
[13:17] ONE.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; ALSO OF YOUR OWN SELF,
[13:24] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT YOU CALL BROTHER THOSE THAT
[13:27] PREACH THE MESSAGE,
[13:29] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT BELIEVE THE MESSAGE,
[13:31] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL GO WITH YOU FOR A WHILE
[13:34] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER A WHILE SOMETHING WILL FLIP
[13:36] THEM.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[13:40] &gt;&gt; SHAN ARISE SPEAKING WHAT?
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Perverse things.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; So is he a problem if somebody woke up
[13:47] and say the cloud was not true?
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Then the same person preach about the
[13:52] cloud
[13:52] &gt;&gt; and they come back they say the cloud is
[13:54] not true.
[13:56] What is the problem?
[13:58] &gt;&gt; It is no more.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; IT IS JUST IDENTIFYING THAT YOU ARE NOW
[14:04] PART OF us
[14:09] &gt;&gt; people
[14:11] &gt;&gt; from the inside.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Rising up.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SPEAKING PERVERSE
[14:19] THINGS
[14:20] &gt;&gt; TO DRAW away disciple after them.
[14:26] making a move so the people will follow
[14:28] them.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[14:33] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, WATCH. THIS IS PAUL saying
[14:36] &gt;&gt; and remember THAT BY THE SPACE OF HOW
[14:39] MANY YEARS?
[14:40] &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; This apostle worked for THREE YEARS. I
[14:44] SEIZED NOT TO DO WHAT?
[14:46] &gt;&gt; WARN
[14:47] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE. HOW MANY TIMES?
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Night and day.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; WITH WHAT?
[14:51] &gt;&gt; TEARS.
[14:53] PAUL [screaming] CRIED FOR THREE YEARS.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; KEEP WARNING THE CHURCH. BE CAREFUL.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL FOR THOSE COMING IN AND FOR
[15:01] THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY INSIDE.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WATCH YOUR STEP.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible continue.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Now this is a conclusion. BRETHREN,
[15:17] I COMMEND YOU TO GOD.
[15:22] AND TO THE WORD OF HIS GRACE.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE HERE, PAUL is recommending
[15:30] the church to two things.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Number one, to God.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; And number two, to what?
[15:39] &gt;&gt; The word of his grace.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; And that word is the whole council of
[15:45] God.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Which is nothing but the message
[15:47] completely.
[15:49] IN OTHER WORDS, PAUL RECOMMENDED THE
[15:52] CHURCH TO GOD AND TO THE MESSAGE.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; PAUL DID NOT RECOMMEND THE CHURCH TO HIS
[16:02] FAMILY. [cheering]
[16:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET ME. PAUL DIDN'T
[16:11] RECOMMEND THE CHURCH TO HIS FRIEND.
[16:14] [cheering]
[16:15] PAUL SAYS THE CHURCH NEED TO FOCUS ON
[16:18] TWO THINGS.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; GOD AND THE WORD.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; GOD AND THE MESSAGE. DON'T LOOK AT THE
[16:26] FAMILY OF PAUL. LOOK AT THE MESSAGE OF
[16:29] PAUL. [cheering]
[16:34] [applause]
[16:36] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING ME. I'M
[16:38] GIVING YOU A FULL VACCINE
[16:41] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU IN EVERY
[16:42] ASPECT. THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Let me START IT AGAIN.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAY, I COMMEND YOU TO WHO?
[16:50] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; And to who?
[16:52] &gt;&gt; The word of HIS GRACE.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS ABLE TO DO WHAT?
[16:55] &gt;&gt; BUILD YOU UP
[16:56] &gt;&gt; AND GIVE YOU AN INHERITANCE AMONG THEM
[16:59] WHICH ARE WHAT?
[17:00] &gt;&gt; SANCTIFY.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE MESSAGE THAT WILL BUILD YOU
[17:03] UP.
[17:07] IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE RECOMMENDED TO
[17:11] GOD
[17:12] &gt;&gt; AND TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham because he
[17:20] preached like Paul.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; God hiding himself in simplicity.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham family are
[17:29] giving gift. Brother Brandham family say
[17:31] this and this. So who who who do we
[17:34] follow?
[17:35] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY DON'T DO IT.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; So who do we follow?
[17:41] &gt;&gt; GOD COMMAND. PAUL PUT THE CHURCH IN THE
[17:44] HAND OF THE MESSAGE
[17:46] &gt;&gt; and in THE HAND OF GOD.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; PAUL DIDN'T EVEN SAY THAT I PUT YOU IN
[17:52] THE HAND OF PETER.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; NOT IN THE HAND OF
[17:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAD TO REBUKE PETER. HE SAID
[18:01] IF SOMEBODY COMES AND PREACH A GOSPEL
[18:04] &gt;&gt; DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ME PAUL ARE PREACH
[18:07] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF IT'S AN ANGEL COMING FROM HEAVEN
[18:10] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT ANGEL IN THE FACE AND CALL
[18:13] HIM YOU ARE A CURSE
[18:16] [applause]
[18:23] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you time to soak in
[18:25] &gt;&gt; so
[18:26] &gt;&gt; you ready
[18:27] &gt;&gt; you ready to get more
[18:29] &gt;&gt; you ready
[18:30] AH, OKAY. IN GOD HIDING HIMSELF IN
[18:33] SIMPLICITY, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY, "NOW
[18:36] LISTEN TO EVERY WORD."
[18:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; You ready, MY FRIEND?
[18:42] &gt;&gt; DO IT.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; CATCH IT.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU ARE TAKING IT ON TAPE or
[18:48] anything, THEN YOU STAY RIGHT
[18:51] &gt;&gt; WITH THAT TAPE. WHAT
[18:53] &gt;&gt; TEACHING?
[18:56] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE STAY WITH IT? THE TEACHING.

[26:47] [cheering]
[26:49] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I HAVE PUT IN THIS CHURCH, I
[26:52] ALWAYS HAVE A QUOTE
[26:54] &gt;&gt; AND A SCRIPTURE TO BACK IT UP.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S THE OFFICE, EVERYTHING I
[26:59] CAN PROVE TO YOU BY THE COURT. WHY?
[27:01] BECAUSE THE CHURCH NEED TO BE FOUNDED ON
[27:04] THE MESSAGE.
[27:07] [cheering]
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; So

[27:16] &gt;&gt; his family did it.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; This is the picture brother Steven his
[27:21] family did it.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; So who am I committed to?
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Follow the family
[27:27] &gt;&gt; or should I follow the tape?
[27:29] LET ME DEAL WITH the family a little
[27:31] bit.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; It's not me. I'm reading, brother,
[27:36] BROTHER. SO, YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ
[27:37] THE CODE?
[27:39] &gt;&gt; If you don't WANT ME TO READ THE CODE,
[27:40] YOU YOU NEED TO SEARCH ANOTHER PASTOR.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; NOT ME. ME, I WILL READ THE QUOTE.
[27:46] [cheering]
[27:47] &gt;&gt; You want me to read the quote?
[27:50] &gt;&gt; I DON'T SAY MY WIFE WON'T DO IT.
[27:53] COME ON NOW, LORD.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[28:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS TALKING ABOUT THE
[28:04] DRESSING. HE SAYS, "I DON'T say my wife
[28:07] won't do it."
[28:08] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN HIS FAMILY
[28:11] &gt;&gt; IS SUBJECT TO THE ATTACK OF THE DEVIL.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY AMEN.
[28:19] HE SAID, "I DON'T SAY MY WIFE WON'T DO
[28:21] IT,
[28:22] &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE TO BE CHANGED
[28:26] &gt;&gt; AND PROVIDED
[28:28] &gt;&gt; TO WHAT I AM NOW. IF I EVER LIVE WITH
[28:31] HER WHILE SHE'S DOING IT,
[28:39] &gt;&gt; SHE'S DOING IT.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; IF HIS FAMILY IS SUBJECT TO THE DEVIL,
[28:43] &gt;&gt; WHO SHOULD WE FOLLOW?
[28:46] FOLLOW HIS FAMILY OR FOLLOW THE WORD.
[28:49] [cheering]
[28:51] [screaming]
[28:52] &gt;&gt; I knew it was a ballistic missile.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S STILL RINGING. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY
[28:56] HE SAY THAT IS EXACTLY
[29:00] &gt;&gt; MY [screaming] GO.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; THEY MAY DO IT WHEN THEY GET TO BE
[29:05] WOMEN.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; I DON'T SAY THEY WON'T.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. THAT IS UP TO THE MERCY OF
[29:11] WHO?
[29:12] &gt;&gt; I HOPE [screaming] THEY DON'T.
[29:19] SISTER SARAH DID THIS THIS THIS THIS.
[29:22] Sister Sarah is NOT YOUR EXAMPLE.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; YOUR EXAMPLE IS THE WORD.
[29:27] [cheering]
[29:28] &gt;&gt; SO IF SARAH LEAVE THE MESSAGE SO WE NEED
[29:30] TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[29:38] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAID THAT IS UP TO WHO?
[29:40] &gt;&gt; THE MERCY of God.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; I HOPE THEY DON'T. IF THEY DO
[29:46] &gt;&gt; HIS CHILDREN,
[29:47] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL WALK OVER THE PRAYERS
[29:50] &gt;&gt; OF A RIGHTEOUS WHAT?
[29:52] &gt;&gt; FATHER,
[29:52] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL WALK OVER THE LIFE OF
[29:54] SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO LIVE.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; IF THEY HAVE A WHAT?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; DO IT.

[30:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; AND COULD INSTRUCT THEM HOW,
[30:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[30:06] &gt;&gt; IF THEY DO THAT, THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR
[30:09] WAY TO HELL.
[30:12] SAY
[30:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; I'M GIVING YOU TIME.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY IF HIS FAMILY DOES IT, THEY
[30:23] WILL DO WHAT?
[30:23] &gt;&gt; BEAT THEIR way to hell.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; SO WHO SHOULD WE FOLLOW AS AN EXAMPLE?
[30:28] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAY FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; SO WHICH MESSENGER DO WE FOLLOW?
[30:34] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY MESSENGER DO WE HAVE?

[30:53] &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE?
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?

[30:58] PEOPLE SO SO SO CONFUSED IN THE WORD.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN AFRICA. THEY FOLLOW IN
[31:04] JEFFERSONVILLE.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; PREACHING AFRICA.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[31:12] &gt;&gt; PREACH IN SOUTH AMERICA. LEAVE UNITED

[31:20] &gt;&gt; GO TO THEM. YOU SAY, "BROTHER, DO YOU
[31:22] HAVE THE MATERIAL? GIVE ME the message,
[31:24] MY BROTHER."
[31:25] &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THEY GIVE ME, I SAY, "BROTHER
[31:26] JOSEPH, GOD BLESS YOU.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE KEEP PRAYING FOR
[31:30] YOU. THIS IS ALL I NEED.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL I NEED. [cheering]
[31:35] EVEN IF I NEVER SEEN BROTHER BRAN, I GOT

[32:01] time.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; LET ME CONTINUE READING. HE SAYS, "IF

[32:06] &gt;&gt; BEAT THEIR WAY TO HELL."
[32:08] &gt;&gt; OVER THE TOP OF MY WHAT?
[32:10] &gt;&gt; PREACHING.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; AND OVER THE TOP OF WHO?
[32:12] &gt;&gt; MY CHRIST.

[32:18] ME. THAT IS
[32:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[33:17] get under something.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; They never want to BE FREE
[33:20] &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME TO FREE YOU.

[33:39] &gt;&gt; this court. I prayed over it. I lost it
[33:43] &gt;&gt; and I pray I pray. I said, "Lord, please

[33:49] to put it so the whole church can see

[36:27] CHRISTMAS
[36:28] &gt;&gt; BUT to everything.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Bipo, our brother,
[36:37] &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY WILL RESPECT THEM.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the word,
[36:42] &gt;&gt; we stay with what the tape say.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; If you want to know the dressing, don't
[36:47] look at THE DRESSING OF REBECCA.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT WHAT the tape say. Amen.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; If you want to know how to marry, look
[36:53] at what they did in the tape.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Stay with tape teaching.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; ARE WE CLEAR?
[37:04] &gt;&gt; AH, LET'S GIVE THE LORD a big clap.
[37:06] [applause]
[37:15] &gt;&gt; You can turn your camera on. My subject
[37:19] this morning
[37:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[37:30] &gt;&gt; If you fool, we close here.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; And I see you next Sunday.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; If you fool, you tell me. We close here.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; That's why I don't want to preach
[37:43] Wednesdays and things like that because
[37:45] if I give Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday,
[37:47] it's it will overwhelm you.
[37:50] I'm giving you a week to digest.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Then we come back.
