yes my brother go ahead and the prophet of God said yes sir your eyes is the gateway to your soul that's exactly right so what you look at yes sir affects your life amen preach now negative or positive yes my brother so you are affected by what you look at amen glory to God praise the name of the Lord yes sir so watch and be mindful of what you look at amen if it doesn't have effect why do we have so much adverts ad why do they put billions yes my brother thousands and billions into adverts that's right to advertise this and advertise that and sometime you go out and you buy things you have not even prepared to buy that's exactly but because of adverts that's exactly right yes my brother preach now the name of the Lord preach now because you look at the ADV oh nice especially those flyers that they come and put it in the Maze and you look at you've not you just looking at that's exactly right and by the time you look at you fix something that's it that's it something that you have never thought of that's right why because you look at it amen amen so there is something about what you look at that's it so be careful of what you look at am because your soul is being fed amen that's why the prophet told us that's right when I come to your office let me see what you look at that's exactly what you listening to that's exactly I know where you are feeding up that's exactly right because it will affect you yes my brother so yes sir be careful of what you are looking at glory to what I said this evening is that yes sir look at the promises of God amen amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord my brother in the scripture we read in Genesis something happened there that's it about Jacob go ahead brother Bram said if you look at the life of Jacob then you see grace amen because that boy or that man or that fellow was very crooked messed up yes sir very smart that's exactly right because he worked with his father-in-law of course that was his uncle and this boy Jacob has taken the birth right he ran away right he deceived his own father uhhuh he went before his father and the father said no the voice is Jacob's voice that's right the father said how soon because the father as es go and get me something then and prepare it and I will eat and I'll bless you and Mama Said No Jacob can't this is what I've heard your father said I will prepare you and said but my father will said don't worry leave that for me and then he goes there listen when Isaac saw he came in is said how did you cancel he said the Lord your God Did It For Me the Lord your God provided and is stood said are you really my son Isa he said yes Daddy I am Isaac said the voice is Jacob's voice right he said but I am Isa I am I I am I am your son isau so he has to run after the he has to run away right hey but but he got it amen amen amen that's exactly right he got it uhhuh because yes sir why should somebody despise his birth right that's right because of cour you are think about it if you despise your birth right because of anything of this life amen because of the Fashions of this life because of the of the flesh because of the pride of my you will regret it am amen amen amen amen pre to my because the Lord Our God has to reveal truth to us amen amen God sent a prophet yes sir he sent a message that's right we have known the mind of God that's exactly in every aspect of Our Lives yes sir what we should do as young men uhhuh what we should do as young women that's right how we should live what we should do as preachers and as a congregation as Mothers and Fathers as husbands and wives right we have been taught right that's right preach my brother I've been here I've heard a pastor teaching I've seen some on the lines on teaching on Ruth and boas and and you know series it took Ruth boas and and different type in every way yes sir so we have been taught the right way that's exactly right Hallelujah yes and I knew is he knew what the bifr was that's right but he despised it that's it because just for a moment to satisfy the flesh that's exactly right preach my brother just for a moment to satisfy his flesh preach my brother think about your life yes my brother think about your ways yes my brother what are you living for amen glory what are we here for yes sir to satisfy the flesh preach or to satisfy ourselves pre or to please our neighbors preach my brother our friends preach or for the L of the flesh preach my brother or for the pride of life preach be careful amen amen amen glory to God because the Bible say when the really time came for him he was desp he was rejected because he despised it amen list yes sir was he so hungry that he couldn't get any other thing to eat uh-huh preach that if he didn't get P couldn't have gotten some bread that's right was there nothing at all in the house that Isa will go and eat but somebody told him look I will give you if only you you you you you forsake the bir right give me the birth right didn't he think preach my brother didn't he reason preach didn't he know what the birth right wash and he thought oh don't just this message stuff preaching at the end he was crying that's exactly he was sweeping that's right he said father is there not any other blessing for me that's right it's a song that is nothing I've blessed your brother amen and he blessed amen amen amen bless him I've given the blessing amen amen amen God Jacob the Isaac didn't know that is saw the bir right that's exactly right it's said I didn't know that's right but Jacob saw saw the birth right right and God saw to it that since you saw it amen you have given it out you forsaken it you have despised it you will never get it again amen amen amen amen so you got a lesson to learn because of this flesh amen not because of the things of this life not because of Any Wellness amen what the fs of this life is whatever the pride of this life is whatever to satisfy your flesh be careful amen because you will despise your birth right and you are despising your birth right amen amen amen amen amen preach my brother Hallelujah Glory Glory oh you think I just said it you just said it be careful because words as spirit amen amen amen amen amen you know what in the Bible you read it in when the the people children of Israel were at Cades ban somewhere and and then they said we cannot take the land we cannot do this and that that's it and the Bible and God heard it that's it that's it amen and God said to Moses uhh as they have confessed with their mouth that's it as they have said it yes sir I have heard it that's what is being it's going to be amen so whatever you say that's it that's it yes my brother yes Mama will not hear it papa will not hear it Pastor might not hear it that God will hear it God will hear it amen praise the name of the Lord you know when they even spoke against Moses Miriam and Aaron spoke against God said I've heard it amen he said why don't you why are you speaking against him amen and so whatever we even talk among ourselves exact talk about people and talk about our neighbors and talk about the pastor and the pastor's family and the brother and the brother's family and about your friends and you think nobody hears it preach somebody's hearing it glory to God am amen amen amen and the prophet said yes sir our thoughts HH sounds louder amen amen do you believe the

where you are musician can come in we need to pray yeah the Holy Spirit has been talking clearly you don't need no interpretation or anything I'm a pastor I know and I know what the Holy Spirit was doing that's why brother Kelly can remember this sometime I see things and I stay quiet and I don't correct it until the Holy Spirit tells me to correct it sometime it's not me to do it he took an elite that the devil was trying to get down and he came and shoot the correct shot every single one of them in the hotel we preach to you about everything as far as Holiness we demonstrated I didn't just give you a quote to tell you don't do this because this is what happened in the past in the message and the message becomes like dos and don't that's the reason why I started by the scripture to show you things in the scripture and then back it up with the message so it will build a confidence in you that the message that we are following is not a man who has been giving us commandment but actually it was the word of God that was preached by the prophet I took the high heel Through the Bible I came back up I took makeup in the Bible I came back up I took that a young man and a young sister should not talk to each other if there is no involvement of parent I took all these thing I told you under no circumstances a young man or a young sister should court or should flirt with a man that is not a message believer I told you all of this but some of the parent are encouraging this sometime I'm trying to hold the standard and the parent are fighting me there been a blockage for the children children can come in church because of the parent I told you under no circumstances should be you be in contact with anyone else but your husband or but your wife I told you all of these things I told you about what kind of haircut we need to have what kind of hair a woman should wear avoid all this coloring of hairs and everything avoid all the foolishness in Tik Tok I thought about orders in this church I thought about music I told you walk kind of correct music and what kind of correct dancing we still do things the way that we want and the Holy Spirit rebuke that rebellious spirit and some are going around the camp and they keep on this clean of keep gossiping if you don't know the what happened about the thing do not get involved into it I'm going to explain this clearly so you stay clear as a pastor and whoever is streaming don't cut it off stay right there and if you listen to this step stay until I finish this because some of you are not here I'm going to talk with the authority of a pastor if me and brother khma have a problem and you don't know what happened and brother khma tells you something do not get involved because you have not talked to me yet because if you hear the story from my part it's going to be probably different I'm not saying brother khala will never do something like that he's a loyal brother I'm just picking him as an example but he will not tell you because sometime you're going to hear the story from someone and you don't hear the story from me and you stay and you take that story and you go tell to somebody else some of us have a tendency that we have created clicks that we are there to be hearing negativity from message churches you need to stop those kind of clicks you need to stop those kind of friend you cannot be a CNN in this message in other word when people come to you they know what happened in Virginia they know what happened in the Congo they know what happened in uh in Europe they know what happened and and and every time people are with you it's all about people's life people's life and we and and and and we keep this kind of friend friend around us so they can continue to feed us with what happened in South Carolina what happened in uh in uh What uh what in Michigan and things like that and clicks have been G and before you know it you are giving spirit one to another and before you know it you're going to be guilty of something that you don't even know how we started and the truth about it I told you many times I would never take a decision in this church if I have not warn somebody if I ever see me on this Pulpit speaking you know that maybe three four five or 10 times I already talked to the person so before you gossip tell somebody leave my house or call me you say stay right there I'm going to call Brother Steven say right there I'm going to call brother Greg say right there I'm going to call sister so and so and they know and they need to hear what you're saying amen amen amen what are you looking in this big move what are you looking to be in this Society in school this Society in school this one you a representative of this and this and you a woman what are you looking for and I keep saying we don't listen we sneak in we do something down and you go meet something and you flirting with a man before you know it your appearance begin to change and then we begin to struggle with a high heel it's not high heel it's a stubbornness that you don't want to listen approve to you high heel approve to you makeup approve to you about all this thing this Tik Tok we should not even be in church here and watching our phone when they're preaching amen all of this thing has been preached to you if you're not a deacon who's checking the phone orra the John who's a security checking the phone or maybe somebody I mean uh I mean a preacher or whoever your phone should be there and I'm going to give you a quote when you come to question and answer because there is a question and answer brother Bram say Christians should bring their Bible in church amen yes Lord we come up with the Bible on the phone now when we looking at the phone we don't focus in the Bible we begin to text and we begin to check our text messages and the sermon is going on whatever you do you know where you selling your B I spoke many times I warn you and the Holy Spirit for the last time is warning you if parent you the one condoning with your children shame on you because I give you everything by the scripture and by the message of the hour if you the one that is blocking your family whatever negativity you put in your family whatever you put in your wife whatever you put in your husband you need to go remove it yourself amen if you don't know something don't say anything if somebody's struggling pray for them if you're not a deacon don't be somebody who's not a deacon but who's trying to solve everybody problem it's not your position you're not a Pastor leave it alone you're not a song leader let the song leader do his job don't come and begin to tell the song leader what to do don't tell the trusty what to do give him an advice give him a suggestion and let him be led as the Holy Spirit lead him am you know where you doing you know what you're doing you know where you are you can Rush quickly because of work tomorrow that's your problem with your soul I'm trying to give you an opportunity right now close your eyes talk to God repent for what you have been doing and promise God to go back and correct everything that you spoke and cut off every
