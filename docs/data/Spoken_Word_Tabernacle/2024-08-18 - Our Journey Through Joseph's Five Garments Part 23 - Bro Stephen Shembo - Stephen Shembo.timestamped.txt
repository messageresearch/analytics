[27:34] happened with sister
[27:36] ma but when we listen to those tapes and
[27:39] we hear the testimonies from other
[27:41] believers that were in that prophet's
[27:43] message we believe
[27:45] it even though we didn't see those
[27:47] things we still believe it and I was
[27:50] telling her this and then brother Nikki
[27:54] shik he came over from South Africa and

[28:44] breath and he said I just stopped I
[28:47] pointed my finger at that bull and I
[28:49] told him to go

[49:04] brother amen ah you heard
[49:07] [Laughter]
[49:11] him so we are back on track amen glory
[49:15] to God so I believe we're reading our C
[49:17] our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel seals
[49:21] adoption or somebody's listening to the
[49:23] message of the hour our question and
[49:26] answer will be on August the
[49:29] 24th there was one question that was
[49:32] sent to me and I believe you follow that
[49:35] in the chart the virtual question and
[49:37] answer I gave you all the scripture all
[49:39] the quote and many there are many quote
[49:41] more than that so I believe that is good
[49:44] enough to solve the matter if you are
[49:47] not convinced yet so contact me and I
[49:50] keep pumping until we get you really
[49:53] stabilized amen amen amen
[49:57] there is many Cote brother Bram say
[49:58] there is a woman with a with a blue blue
[50:01] heart there's a woman with a green heart
[50:03] and things like that but the difference
[50:05] I believe you can make it clear before I
[50:08] mean between Sport and a normal woman
[50:12] decorative attire whatever but your hair
[50:15] was given to you for your
[50:19] covering
[50:21] amen this church sometime it's hard to
[50:24] get in the between and bellance swing up
[50:26] but praise God for the holy spirit amen
[50:29] young Sisters Meeting on September the
[50:31] 21st Young's men followup meeting will
[50:35] be to be announced I'm waiting on
[50:37] brother Enoch to work on that and Lord's
[50:39] willing the merried couple meeting is on
[50:42] September 7 I got really good questions
[50:47] they're really yummy
[50:48] questions really yummy and spicy
[50:52] question and he help and I appreciate
[50:54] each one everyone that put those
[50:56] question because he helped me gauge
[50:59] where we going and then from there on we
[51:01] will SAR I don't think it would take one
[51:03] service to handle this type of stuff we
[51:06] need to go one two 3 four and then
[51:08] continue until we clear every Arena
[51:12] because the the the study of a soul is
[51:16] very
[51:18] delicate and it's
[51:20] dangerous and it's where everything is
[51:23] laying right there the only one who
[51:26] clearly enter into that domain is
[51:28] brother brandham but we don't preach
[51:31] about it too much and people are
[51:33] confused you know why you might be
[51:35] seated a little bit and people are
[51:37] confused amen so sometime we cast out
[51:40] Devils where there is no
[51:43] Devils it's just a soulle issue amen and
[51:48] you keep praying and casting out devil
[51:49] there is no devil there you just need to
[51:53] understand how the body operate sometime
[51:57] your genetics can be carrying already
[51:59] something for you right and it's waiting
[52:02] for a
[52:03] trouble if you trouble so much somebody
[52:06] the genetic kick in he lays dormant it's
[52:10] like a curse that is like a strin in a
[52:13] family that goes like a
[52:15] curse you don't know this
[52:18] stuff you don't know this stuff as long
[52:21] under normal condition of temperature
[52:24] and pressure sleep
[52:27] that stuff will remain
[52:29] quiet if you start putting pressure you
[52:33] awaken that demon and before you know up
[52:36] you're going to deal with something so
[52:39] when we say courtship you need to know
[52:41] who you're dealing
[52:45] with it is not sitting and talking about
[52:48] you the best beautiful flower in the
[52:50] world you need to know what you're
[52:51] dealing

[53:12] with a
[53:14] stepmother if you don't understand all
[53:16] of those
[53:17] stuff and you just get the
[53:20] package good
[53:24] luck there is no demon you just did not
[53:31] understand it's amazing how ignorant we
[53:34] are in this
[53:36] message because we don't want to stay
[53:38] with the
[53:39] prophet amen and we act like Pentecostal
[53:43] demon demon demon you've been casting

[56:10] don't read the Bible like a newspaper
[56:12] push the break and say what is brother
[56:14] Bram saying you say Lord what are you
[56:17] trying to say through this Prophet what
[56:19] is is he telling a story what is this
[56:21] Prophet saying if you begin to push the
[56:24] break and to go slowly you will
[56:27] understand that this message is deeper
[56:30] than what we think amen amen sometime
[56:35] you look at certain quot you shake your
[56:36] head you say wow I never knew brother
[56:38] brandham speak something like this and

[57:59] do you understand what I'm
[58:01] saying do you understand what I'm
[58:05] saying back in the day brother Glenn I'm
[58:09] home back in the day brother Glenn when
[58:12] we grew up when you take a car to the
[58:16] shop the mechanic will pull down
[58:20] everything maybe it's uh what do you
[58:24] call it what what can I get trans
[58:26] transmission or whatever the mechanic
[58:28] will take the transmission out and fix
[58:31] it and put it back again and the car
[58:34] move that was back in the day so you can
[58:37] bring a car to a true mechanic he will
[58:40] just listen to the son and say this is
[58:44] this today they don't work like
[58:50] that if something is broke do you know
[58:53] what they do they tell you give us two

[59:20] saying our ministry is not a Pentecostal
[59:25] Ministry it is not a meod this ministry
[59:28] Pentecost will put prayer line and cast
[59:31] our Devils whether you repent or not and
[59:36] the person goes and the demon come back
[59:38] again brother BR Ministry is not like
[59:41] that when you bring somebody to the
[59:43] prayer line brother BR must find out
[59:46] what caused this
[59:47] [Music]
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:51] problem in other word the method we
[59:54] should use in the message said is first
[59:57] find what is the
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:02] problem when you go to the root of the
[1:00:05] problem then you can solve it once for
[1:00:12] all oh we take pleasure on people
[1:00:15] calling me pray for me pray for me pray
[1:00:17] for me pray for me no no I pray for you

[1:00:46] that headache an
[1:00:48] alarm
[1:00:51] hallu Lord have
[1:00:53] mercy do you understand what I'm saying
[1:00:57] if it's a demon we pray but sometime
[1:01:00] it's not a
[1:01:02] demon it's probably you have not slept
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:11] enough all you need to do is go to sleep
[1:01:15] and you wake up and the demon your demon
[1:01:18] is gone
[1:01:26] all the problem you have in marriage is
[1:01:28] that
[1:01:33] demon it was just a
[1:01:38] trailer is that really
[1:01:40] demon women are complicated are they
[1:01:45] complicated or you never understood that
[1:01:49] world are men really
[1:01:54] complicated oh you never understood how
[1:01:58] that world
[1:02:01] operate are men
[1:02:04] complicated are women if I if I say men
[1:02:07] complicated the women will say yes if I
[1:02:10] talk to the men I say are women
[1:02:11] complicated they say oh brother Sten of
[1:02:14] course yes so who's
[1:02:20] complicated when in the beginning God
[1:02:23] created man and
[1:02:26] and marry
[1:02:34] them you want to get
[1:02:36] married young folks you want to get
[1:02:39] [Laughter]
[1:02:41] [Applause]
[1:02:43] married amen amen you are taking an
[1:02:48] entity from their home oh I love her you
[1:02:51] do you really love her
[1:02:57] I want to leave my father and my brother
[1:02:59] do you know what you're
[1:03:05] doing to go with this man yes I love him
[1:03:08] to death good luck come
[1:03:12] on that's why brother Bram say you want
[1:03:15] to get married look at the family you
[1:03:17] marry why is brother Bram
[1:03:22] saying what is brother Bram saying
[1:03:34] 20% and 80% let's stand for the reading
[1:03:38] of the
[1:03:39] scripture somebody's like man of course
[1:03:55] if you don't understand the the the
[1:04:01] way God built you you will suffer a
[1:04:10] lot Amen brother Bram say God never
[1:04:13] created us to be
[1:04:19] Angel that's why you will never be
[1:04:22] comfortable in the sixth dimension
[1:04:27] even though the sixth Dimension is
[1:04:31] sublim before you enter there only
[1:04:34] perfect love but those that are there
[1:04:37] still feel like they want to go back
[1:04:39] home they need to come back to the
[1:04:45] Earth they feel like okay we hear
[1:04:48] everything is good but this is not the
[1:04:51] way we were supposed to be we missing a
[1:04:53] part
[1:04:56] so to be in peace in this world you need
[1:04:58] to understand the physical part and the
[1:05:01] spiritual
[1:05:03] part the danger is when we go in church
[1:05:06] we go too much on the
[1:05:11] spiritual and we are neglecting the
[1:05:14] physical and the body is just waiting
[1:05:16] for you as soon as you leave church he
[1:05:18] say I'm still with you
[1:05:26] where is your fight coming
[1:05:34] from how can I was asking somebody a
[1:05:37] question a woman goes to the hospital
[1:05:39] they give her a hormone
[1:05:42] shot and he bring a
[1:05:45] demon and the demon make her walk like a
[1:05:49] snake I mean go like a snake so was
[1:05:54] where was that demon in the sh
[1:05:59] where where did that so so Shir give
[1:06:01] people demon what kind the demon that
[1:06:05] only
[1:06:10] with
[1:06:11] amen so you should be happy in home you
[1:06:16] should be happy in your
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] marriages even though you not in heaven
[1:06:25] but you should be happy

[1:06:30] to
[1:06:33] that oh Lord Jesus Christ the day we
[1:06:36] going to get to heaven the day we going
[1:06:37] to get together you will

[1:13:11] them completely out of this place in the
[1:13:14] name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:17] amen the Bible says he judges among the
[1:13:21] gods we know who is Gods now amen amen
[1:13:24] it's already here praise God oh my God
[1:13:28] glory to God somebody kept this made my
[1:13:31] life
[1:13:33] easy the prayer of Jesus Christ always
[1:13:38] answer amen all right let's go here okay
[1:13:42] let's keep this
[1:13:43] one praise God all right amen job to
[1:13:48] verse
[1:13:49] 6 I have said ye are God who saying that
[1:13:58] God so to awaken God it takes
[1:14:05] who only God can wake God
[1:14:11] up only
[1:14:13] God Only God Amen can bring the
[1:14:20] Awakening
[1:14:22] amen if God have not talked to you
[1:14:26] yet you won't know that you are
[1:14:30] God we clear we clear when somebody
[1:14:34] tells you you
[1:14:36] God it's different but the day God will
[1:14:39] tell you you
[1:14:41] God M Men of Valor Gideon then it's a
[1:14:46] different story in other word the time
[1:14:49] has
[1:14:50] come the hour have arrived that you need
[1:14:54] to know certain
[1:14:57] stuff
[1:14:59] amen he says I have said ye are gods and
[1:15:05] all of you are children of who the most
[1:15:08] high you know what the most high
[1:15:11] means but ye shall die like
[1:15:18] men we found out that these people are
[1:15:23] Gods amen
[1:15:26] but they dying like
[1:15:28] men they are Gods
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:34] dying amen like
[1:15:37] men amen so it means that these gods are
[1:15:44] men
[1:15:46] they we clear when they say man it
[1:15:50] doesn't take the woman away
[1:15:56] are we together when the Bible uses the
[1:15:59] masculine amen it doesn't mean sister
[1:16:02] are not
[1:16:04] here are we together because when God
[1:16:08] created
[1:16:13] man he created men how male and female
[1:16:17] so when we say men the woman are
[1:16:22] included are we together are we together
[1:16:26] that's why in the sixth Dimension when
[1:16:27] they call Brother Bram his wife came
[1:16:30] with
[1:16:32] him sir are we together so when they say
[1:16:35] man it's both male and
[1:16:38] female amen so these gods are dying in
[1:16:44] other words these gods are
[1:16:50] mortal are we together sir but whatever
[1:16:54] happened here doesn't change the fact
[1:16:57] that they are
[1:17:01] God are we together hence we found out
[1:17:05] that these people these
[1:17:08] species are
[1:17:10] gods and they are also
[1:17:14] human amen the problem is how to make a
[1:17:18] difference between the
[1:17:20] two are we together so verse uh 6
[1:17:25] and seven but you shall die like
[1:17:29] men and
[1:17:34] fall like one of the what the princes
[1:17:37] therefore
[1:17:39] fall the fall of this God Amen are like
[1:17:44] what one of the
[1:17:48] princess are we together amen they dying
[1:17:52] like men means that they are men
[1:17:56] yeah are we together they falling like
[1:18:01] princess in other words when they
[1:18:04] fall if you look at them they are
[1:18:07] falling like
[1:18:11] princes in other words these gods are
[1:18:18] princess it was a Short scripture every
[1:18:21] Sunday we take a chunk
[1:18:25] am let me go back again the Bible say ye
[1:18:29] are God and you die like men so these
[1:18:33] gods are men they are mortal and he say
[1:18:37] when they
[1:18:39] fall they fall like a
[1:18:44] priest and again here it's a masculine
[1:18:48] used here
[1:18:57] ah William Mar Bram brother Bram say
[1:19:02] people try to things well I'm what a
[1:19:05] Christian I guess I shall have to be
[1:19:08] doged
[1:19:10] around no you don't no
[1:19:14] sir you are a Christian brother that is
[1:19:18] a
[1:19:19] high you are a what a Son of God our
[1:19:23] father is is what
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:31] king our father is what king certainly
[1:19:35] what amen and our father being King we
[1:19:39] are what his son we are what Prince and
[1:19:43] what and Princess the congregation must
[1:19:45] say
[1:19:50] what we are PR and princes Amen to a
[1:19:54] wife
[1:19:55] King the highest there is uhhuh highest
[1:19:59] can be uhhuh the very Spirit of our God
[1:20:02] is where in us that's it
[1:20:11] amen so when you look at this God when
[1:20:15] they
[1:20:18] fall they fall like a
[1:20:21] princess
[1:20:23] why why why they didn't fall like a
[1:20:31] farmer why they didn't fall like a
[1:20:36] doctor the Bible say when they fall they
[1:20:39] fall like a princes in other word if
[1:20:43] therefore if you go see them they are
[1:20:46] princes
[1:20:53] [Laughter]
[1:20:57] ah Daniel 9 verse
[1:21:00] 25 now therefore and understand know
[1:21:04] therefore and understand that from the
[1:21:06] going forth of the Commandment to
[1:21:08] restore and build what Jerusalem unto
[1:21:12] the Messiah their
[1:21:19] prince your big brother
[1:21:25] is a PRI remember the big fellow that's
[1:21:29] why he's not ashamed to be called your
[1:21:31] brother the Big Brother the Messiah
[1:21:34] himself is a
[1:21:36] priest that's why your fall is like the
[1:21:39] fall of a
[1:21:42] priest I hope we getting this it's a
[1:21:45] hard material my friend he says here in
[1:21:48] act three and killed the who the Prince
[1:21:51] of Life whom God has raised from the
[1:21:54] dead when of we are what Witnesses the
[1:21:56] god of our father rais up who Jesus whom
[1:22:00] he slew and did what hang on a tree him
[1:22:03] has God exalted with his right hand to
[1:22:06] be a what a
[1:22:10] prince your God is a
[1:22:15] priest your father is not just a king he
[1:22:18] is also a priest that's why when you
[1:22:21] fall you fall like one of the Priestess
[1:22:30] let me help
[1:22:31] somebody I thought we can come up this
[1:22:33] airport quickly in Genesis
[1:22:37] 32:28 the Bible say he said that name
[1:22:41] shall be called what no more Jacob but
[1:22:44] what Israel for as a a
[1:22:49] prince Jacob was a professional liar
[1:22:54] yes and a Prof and a professional cheer
[1:22:59] but when he overcame
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:07] God is that a different
[1:23:10] language Jacob H God until God didn't
[1:23:13] know what to do with
[1:23:15] him amen the Bible say it's right here
[1:23:19] yes let me read Because when you say
[1:23:22] some certain stuff is trouble
[1:23:25] but Israel for as a prince has thou what
[1:23:29] power with who God and what with man and
[1:23:32] has done what
[1:23:34] Prevail so when Jacob
[1:23:37] overcome they call him a
[1:23:40] priest Israel means a priest and brother
[1:23:44] Bram say Israel is God Redemptive
[1:23:50] name so we are
[1:23:52] princess that's why when they change the
[1:23:55] name of SAR to Sarah brother Bram say
[1:23:58] Sarah means
[1:24:03] princess are we together are we together
[1:24:06] are we together so when you fall like
[1:24:10] Jacob when you overcome with God then
[1:24:15] Jacob name
[1:24:21] change do you think the name of Jacob
[1:24:25] the name of Israel God did not know that
[1:24:27] name
[1:24:28] before God knew the name before but he
[1:24:31] was not revealed to Jacob yet until he
[1:24:34] messed
[1:24:35] up when he messed up and he and he
[1:24:38] overcame with God then his true
[1:24:46] name not the name that they gave him
[1:24:49] because Jacob they give him a name by
[1:24:51] his family because of the way he was was
[1:24:54] coming holding the the what heill they
[1:24:58] thought he was in the position of uh of
[1:25:02] a hill but he holding the hill was as a
[1:25:06] result of a
[1:25:08] fight he wanted to get the be he wanted
[1:25:11] to be
[1:25:14] first re Rebecca went to God and asked
[1:25:18] God he said this PR this pregnancy have
[1:25:20] a trouble God say it's no trouble it's
[1:25:23] two Nation fighting
[1:25:27] are we together so when Jacob is coming
[1:25:30] up he's holding the heel and they look
[1:25:33] at him they say you the bad
[1:25:40] one and then he begin to grow up with
[1:25:43] that bad
[1:25:44] name and manifest the characteristic of
[1:25:48] that bad name given in the family
[1:25:54] and Esau was called a good
[1:25:57] guy but God say I hate
[1:26:02] Esau I love Jacob not I love Israel I
[1:26:07] love that
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:12] Che do you follow me I love that Che
[1:26:16] right there they say but he's a supp he
[1:26:18] said that's the one I like
[1:26:24] and when the che overcame
[1:26:28] God are we together God open up his new
[1:26:33] name because he was looking for blessing
[1:26:35] you must bless me you must bless me God
[1:26:38] said you don't need a blessing you
[1:26:40] already got the blessing what you need
[1:26:43] is a change of name you need to realize
[1:26:46] that you are a
[1:26:49] prince amen your fall is like the fall
[1:26:53] of one of the
[1:26:58] PRI are we together have I lost you

[1:59:45] who wor to take the book and even to
[1:59:48] break the score and the only one Worthy
[1:59:51] is the
[1:59:53] of the tribe of what
[1:59:56] Judah but I have a news for you you who
[2:00:00] have a problem with your worthiness in
[2:00:03] Revelation
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:07] 10 in Revelation 5 there was only one
[2:00:12] person who was worthy to touch the book
[2:00:16] but in Revelation
[2:00:17] 10 the mighty angel came down with the
[2:00:24] [Music]

[2:02:17] going to get what will happen to your
[2:02:19] curriculum

[2:02:36] father because if you know your
[2:02:38] father do you think your father will
[2:02:41] make you as the higher
[2:02:45] servant so this condition made this son
[2:02:49] even lose the true perception
[2:02:52] of his own
[2:02:54] father he's looking at father as a
[2:03:01] Punisher when he approaches the father
[2:03:04] he's waiting for
[2:03:10] judgment so he's self inflicting himself
[2:03:12] judgment already H let me make myself
[2:03:15] look bad already because over there they
[2:03:17] will kill
[2:03:20] me amen amen amen and he
[2:03:23] arose and came to his father

[2:03:54] good how did he
[2:03:56] look and he was far away but the
[2:04:00] father could
[2:04:03] look at all those conditions and
[2:04:07] recognize
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:16] him oh God in other word when the father
[2:04:19] is looking the father doesn't see the
[2:04:22] the unshaved build he doesn't see the
[2:04:26] bad hair he doesn't see the bad stuff
[2:04:29] this the father is just looking at him
