you i believe the majority of the people receive the announcement from the church if you don't you need to either meet me or brother david or one of the trustees or the deacon and hand your number so you make sure we you stay on top of everything so basically everybody is aware of what happened by the tragedy in the family the bride family that took our younger brother uh brought in a tanya barrett we have been in communication with the family with brother tanya and sister lorel has been working pretty hard we've seen cesar lorelle has been working pretty hard that's a little hand off applause probably [Laughter] [Applause] here's the name of the lord she was working with sister cheryl kathy from brother josh bennett's church making sure we provide the food for the family and lords willing we send an announcement on sunday we will collect an offering for brother nathaniel and we'll send it to the family and probably take it in person and make sure it can't help for the funeral i spoke with brother kinney he's doing good still a lot of emotion and a lot of struggle but caleb is at home he's at home by god's grace praise the lord [Applause] so we'll continue to communicate if there is anything we'll let you know and i told brother kill dear brother kenny he's uh one of our brother we are open anything we can help he need to reach out and let us know and we will be there for him so god which we bless you just remember on sunday we will be collecting an offering for brother natalia to help him on the funeral expenses and everything god richly bless you let's turn straight to the book of genesis chapter 13. this coming sunday lord's willing we will have brother tim hayton with us so he will be bringing some of the folks from his church so if you miss it make sure you stream if you dare you can say amen amen all right praise the name of the lord genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and abraham say to lord we know that abraham and lord came up from the hand from the land of the caudills they both were idol worshiper and god spoke to abraham but when god spoke to abraham he didn't only pull abraham out remember he also pulled out last sunday we talked about ruth and orpah when the family of elimelech went to moab he pulled ruth and orpah so for some time they're going to stay together as a family but the world come in time of separation amen all right so and abraham said to lord let there be no strength i pray you between me and you you might be seated and between my hearts man and your hurts man for we be brethren in other words there is a family relationship there but after a while because of the decision the oncoming decision something is going to happen and if it happened it's going to bring a split are you there where's the name of the lord that split is not caused by you remember on sunday it is caused by the word praise the name of the lord verse nine is not the whole land before you separate yourself a separation i pray you from me if you will take the left hand then i will go to the right or if you depart to the right then i will go to the left and lord lift up his eyes and be held on the plane of jordan that he was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah so lord look at this but behind this beauty behind this prosperity behind that there was a destruction coming up he never caught the destruction he only cut or saw whatever was appealing to his eyes amen before the lord destroys sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord it looks like the garden of eden what a deception like the land of egypt we will talk about that land a little bit today as you come to zoar then lord choose him all the plain of jordan and lord surgeon east and they separated themselves the one from the other at the beginning it was a family but a stand have to be taken but once you take a stand it brings a split praise the name of the lord abraham dwell in the land of canaan that's verse 12 and lord dwell in the cities of the plain and pitch his tent toward sodom is back again over there but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly never realized that and the lord said to abraham after not before after that lot was separated from him after the separation the lord appeared to abraham are you there so there was a part or a revelation that god wanted to show to abraham but he could not afford that revelation until the split happened are you there once the split the separation happened then the lord opened up the door a separation amen after that lot was separated from him lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward in other words the word unfolded completely open are you there at the beginning god never give him that opportunity to see on the north on the south on the on the east and on the west abraham only have a certain limitation in his vision but after the split happened then the lord opened up a different door are you there in other words abraham now it's your time to investigate the land and there is no restriction to the investigation you have the right to go to the north you have the right to go to the south you have the right to go everywhere and protect to the land of canaan everybody clear let's go to philippians 3. we mentioned this on uh sunday but did not dig into it for time for the robert you need to help me on time because this thing is loaded philippians chapter 3 i thought i'm gonna do a little bit of short and before you know it something unfold and unfold and i'm folding unfold you got it philippians chapter 3 verse 13 present i can't not myself to help apprehended there's still a work to do but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind remember oppa wants oprah and root split ruth have to move to the land of judah forgetting everything that is behind everybody there and which are behind and reaching for for those things which are before so just like abraham there were certain things that were before him but they were not unveiled until a split happened are you there so paul is saying that there are things that are laying before but we need to move on and forget that which was behind everybody clear verse 14 i pressed toward the mark for the high for the price of high calling of cross of god in christ jesus so what paul is saying that the things that i'm pressing toward there is a price there and the price of a high calling in other words paul was called but there was still a high calling somewhere roof was called but there was a higher calling to roof not in the land of moab but in the land of judah everybody clear verse 17 brethren be followers together of me that's why we follow brother branham are you there uh-huh because paul said follow me as a follower christ we are following brother branham because what i'm following christ are you there follow me and mark them which work so as you have as you have so as you have asked for an example verse 18 for many work so when paul is saying forget those things which are behind there was a there were a group of people many walk remember on sunday there were many disciples but in john 6 66 some did no longer work are you there and paul is saying here that for many work of whom i have told you often and now tell you even whipping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ so at the beginning they were friends at the beginning they were brothers but after a while a split happened and when a split happened they turned to be enemy of the cross enemy of the atonement hebrews chapter 6 then we're going to pray praise the name of the lord was supposed to get into the part of serving but there is something we need to touch up hebrew chapter six verse one you need to keep your bible today if you dare you can say amen therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of what you need to leave moab you need to go to the land of judah because there is a fresh bread in the land of judah remember on sunday ruth have to worship god no more immoral you need to depart for more leave the principle of the doctrine of christ let us go on to water so perfection was before a high calling perfection not laying again the foundation of what repentance from dead works that happened when roof was joined into the family of judah but we're now going back again there a split happened now you got to move forward to all perfection and of faith toward who god let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for giving us an opportunity father through this pandemic that we can gather together lord iran the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what every man in the planet of earth can do lord but lord downfall then give revelation your prophet told us that it's a work of the spirit father may you move me completely out of the way lord may you take this service lord for your own preeminence lord speak to your children and may the holy spirit the inside teacher may he comes down and unfold the word to your children be the alpha and the omega lord we rebuke every demonic power lord father of fear of coronavirus all kind of stuff lord for the destruction in the mind of your people we rebuke it all back to hell lord in the name of jesus christ may you be with us and guide us lord in jesus precious name amen and amen god which they bless you it's a wednesday so it's going to be like a sunday school this we are dealing with the mystery of the two stave part four three was on sunday on part one we found out that when the ark of the covenant was made the ark of the covenant have two states that were put one on the right and one on the left side because technically the ark of the covenant was supposed to be moving but god never put wills but he used the will of man in order to carry the gospel and when we look on zechariah chapter 11 we found out that the bible spoke of two staves and when we broke it down and unfolded we found out that the first step means christ and if you remember when those steps were placed into the ark of the covenant a commandment was given not to remove those things in other words you can no longer take the step out of the ark of the covenant in other words the staff and the ark of the covenant are always connected together if you move if you want to deal with the ark of the covenant you don't touch the ark of the covenant but you handle the ark by the stairs if you move the steps to the right the arc move to the right if you move the stair if you move the staff to the left the arc move with the staff so you must know who are those staff and you need to be connected as a will to the staff and then you can be able to manipulate the ark of the covenant but the key point is those states have to remain always with the ark of the covenant in other words jesus christ is the word and jesus will never deviate from the word because the staff and the ark of the covenant are always connected or joined together everybody clear then on part two when we study part two we were trying to unveil the second stuff and we found out that the second staff was also crushed but now he was crushed in the entire ministry as the message of the hour are you there and then that's the reason why the message have never deviated from the bible because the ark and the staff are always connected and if you want to manipulate the word if you want to manipulate the bible you need to manipulate it by the stuff you need to hold the message of the hour in order to manipulate the word in order to preach the word of god you must preach the word by the message because christ is preached according to the revelation of the mystery everybody clear now those join the two head of the zodiac we spoke about it the first coming of jesus christ and also the second coming of jesus christ which are the two pyramids now we found out that uh zechariah told us that the first staff was broken and when he was broken he spoke about the crucifixion of jesus christ we're clear on that then we also found out that the second stuff was also broken but the bible says which was speaking about the second crucifixion of jesus christ under the ministry of malachi 4 and then we found out that the bible says that when the second staff was broken what did he do he broke the brotherhood between judah and israel it causes a split of the kingdom then on part three we try to understand what was that split now today when we were going to the end of part three we are sharing in with ruth naomi and oppa are you there then we found out that oppa and ruth both of them were joined into the family of judah are you there because brother branham said the way naomi left the land of israel going to the land of moab was a tap of the word or the gospel leaving the jews going into the gentile and when he went into magenta he pulled two vine we have the fourth vine and the truvine and we found out that a decision have to be made after all whether you're gonna serve god in the land of moab or you need to deport from the land of muslim and move forward into the land of judah so when the decision was taken he brought a split he brought a separation between the two women so going back again to the division of the kingdom we found out that the division of israel brought a split between the house of david and the remaining of the house of israel and we found out that under jeroboam ten tribes were given to israel and one tribe was given to the land of judah and judah represented the brand and then the tenth brother branham said then was when the tribe were karma in other words when the split happened it only removed the carnal part away from the blood when the split happened it only removed not away from abraham when the split happened he only removed opera away from roof are you there but we found out that there was a mystery tribe which was the tribe of benjamin so with these three in places here israel represents oppa which was the one the corner going back to the word judah represent the roof which was the brand and now only brother pranam explained to us was the top of 144 000 which is the top of benjamin are you there so when naomi's going back to the promised land we see also that ruth is connected to naomi and going back to the promised land everybody clear so far now we get on part four tonight looking at those two brother branham said that one of the greatest if you want to see what time of the year it is look on the calendar if you want to see what time of night it is look at the clock if you want to see what day you are living in look where the jews are that is god's time peace if you remember the way the tribe were uh seated on on uh around the tabernacle and the movement of the tribe was clockwise like a clock in other words the movement of the jews gives you the time peace the time of god everybody care now on 2 21 brother branham say and look the very night the very day that the angel of the lord met me 1946 on may the 7th at greensmill indiana that same day the treaty of peace was signed for the jews and they were established they were an established nation for the first time for 2 500 years so brian branham is connecting here that the day he was commissioned by the angel of the lord it happened to be exactly the same day that israel was recognized as a nation why because when naomi is going back to the promised land roof also is connected to her as israel is going back to the promised land to receive her atonement a bride must be introduced together at the same day everybody clear praise the name of the lord brother branham continue here on question and answer he said because the roman empire took them over and the messiah come and they rejected it because the first staff have to be broken everybody clear and was gathered to the four wings of the earth we met we we already studied that that the jews were scattered all over the world so the trumpet have to sound in order to bring them back to the promised land but did you know on may the 6th again 1946 that flag come back over jerusalem again did you know on may the 7th 1946 the angel of the lord appeared to me the next day up here and send me into all the world to bring forth a what remember rules have to go back to the promised land because of what a revival the very next morning when that flag raised in jerusalem as the going down of the sun that afternoon the angel of the lord or the angel of the lord appear here in the what the united states remember your fifth elijah i have to be in america we already taught you on that one in the united states at the same time when you see the fig tree and the rest of the tree is putting forth birth then you know that what the time is a hand everybody clear so if you look at naomi and benjamin as a benjamin when the gospel left jerusalem because the family of elimelech means pleasant worship when the gospel left the land of bethlehem jerusalem going into the land of moab the family the move out was the family of judah and judah always tempered with gentiles are you there and brother branham told us that naomi was the top of 144 000 and we know that a hundred and forty four thousand was a type of benjamin and we know now that when you look at the gospel when the gospel was leaving israel going to the gentile brother branham explained to us that the lion anointing that came upon paul was the anointing that was on jesus christ it was the anointing on the ministry of jesus christ as alpha that was poured down in the house or in the life of paul because judah always spoke of a lion but when the lion left the child we left israel when that anointing left israel and came down on the day of pentecost in order to usher the gospel to all the gentiles we found out that there was a man by the name of paul that appeal check roman chapter 11. if you dare you can say amen romans 11. let's look at paul a lottery brother robert pass me the ball on this one everybody there romans chapter 11 verse one i say then has god cast away his people god forbid for i who's speaking poem for i also am a what an israelite an israelite of the seed of what and of the tribe of what why paul had to come out after the tribe of benjamin why is the gospel living in israel have to use the tribe of benjamin is it clear are you there that's why when judah was living there because judah always have a connection with benjamin are you there when joseph want to reveal himself in egypt he wanted to see benjamin but his father didn't want to let benjamin go reuben pleaded and then the father refused but when judah stepped on the scene and asked for the pled judah was granted to take benjamin back to the gentile that's why when the anointing of judah is leaving israel he had to drop by the tribe of benjamin and pick up a benjamite by the name of paul jump to verse 13. you can get this without a prophet for i speak to you gentile inasmuch as i am an apostle of what so that apostle of the gentile have to come out from what from the tribe of benjamin take philippians chapter 3 praise the name of the lord if you dare you can say amen philippians 3 verse 5 paul says this he said paul he's talking about himself he said circumcised the what a day of the stock of israel of the tribe of water benjamin clear a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a what a pharisee clear and if you check again galatians you'll find that it is clear that peter was an apostle to the jews but paul was an apostle to the gentile everybody clear that was the first phase of ruth living there god of naomi leaving the land and coming out to the gentile now the second phase was for naomi to leave the land of the gentile and go back again to israel why because they heard news that there was bread in the house of israel but particularly in bethlehem where brother branham say it was the center of bread everybody clear now brother muslim says here that i am now christian don't do that a christian don't try to be what he used to be because a decision have to be taken and the roots have to move out because every time the second stuff is broken it will break it will split it will break the brotherhood between judah and israel every time the message of the hour is crucified it will bring a split and that split is god taking his blood out and leaving the other part back and that part will go back to moab that part will go back to sodom that part will go back to their own life so don't be surprised if that which used to be a brother or a sister begin to repent if they begin to put makeups if they begin to go after all kind of worldly stuff to begin with they were not seed because if you believe this message to be the truth are you there where did the pastor leaves the message or not you're not gonna wear paint because your pastor left the message you didn't believe the message because of a preacher you believe the message by revelation are you there if the pastor leaves the message that's not your problem but if the person leaves the message you leave the message it is showing that you are all power you are locked you are going back again and before you know it they're gonna hate the message they become the enemy of the cross are you there it is god bringing the split you are not the one doing it but as roof you have to take a decision whether you want to stay in the mob or whether you want to go further with the message and when this church we stood for the message we took position for the message we're not going back again we are forgetting what happened before and we are heading toward the mark of high calling hallelujah praise the name of the lord a christian don't try to be what he used to be he's not looking where he has been that's why we gotta forget those things behind you are you there we've been hurting things were hard you gotta forget those things which are behind are you there you gotta stand up now you took your decision let's go to the land of judah are you there he's looking where he's going that's what paul said see don't pay no attention to what you want then you have done leave that out it's a history that spirit happened it's a history are you there probably you will never see up a normal opera block you on the facebook open up together like you used to be you didn't cause that it is the decision of the message hallelujah and anytime and any man that drives love food looking through a real view mirror will go to wreck and so will you on this christian road don't look back what you was look what you are going to be are you there in the land of moab ruth was married but never have a baby are you there naomi taught them that there is no hope for you to have a husband because i'm already an old person how are you gonna cling to me if you are looking for a husband or per look at the possibility she won back but oprah never understood that the land of judah have a special husband by the name of boss you need to leave moab if you want to see boys are you there paul's saying forgetting those things which are in the past are pressed toward the mark of water praise the name of the lord there is a high calling calling in the land of judah brother man i'm saying many of us my friend has missed the mark of the high calling in christ it's because we didn't recognize many times a judgment bar there shall be disappointment when you realize that that religion of jesus christ it brings salvation and happiness and gladness which is called as paul said in the days of old in the way that is called what in the day that they call as crazy fanatics believing a crazy message that's the way we worship the god of our father are you there our pentecostal father worship like that because malachi 4 brings you back to the faith of the world we already cleaned up with them brother branham said just as sure as you are hungry tonight for the holy spirit it is something in you pulling you that a purpose of god in your life has got to be fulfilled just like he was with who so when wolf took a decision to stand for the word to follow the word to leave everything to lose everything to leave every property are you there it was not the roof doing that it was a predestination seed that was calling for for something higher praise the name of the lord but one of them said many you may go through lots of trouble and trials like we've been just remember there is someone who knows that's the way makes it real i do not know what is behind the curtain but i know one thing i'm pressing toward what the mark of the high calling every day trying to live for that great event that will take place someday when i shall see him what when i want to see boaz face to face are you there and tell the story saved by what that's the day i live for leaving those things which are behind which are i want to press on just keep i want this tabernacle spoken word tabernacle now that you are now that you are on your feet now you are comfortable now you got used to it i want you to keep pressing toward the mark of the eye calling whatever you do cling word be as clannish as you can be this clean here means we need to fellowship together as a family are you there but even though we fellowship as a family but always with enough mouth to reach and get someone else to bring them water when you hear that lord he's in trouble abraham pack everything and he's after his brother to rescue him and to pull him back are you there so stay together stay in unity but always have an arm out because somebody else might need help somewhere everybody clear but in this faith that we are now preaching and endlessly contending for we are contending for this message don't you move one end from it stay with the message stay with the word so if you believe me to be his servant we do believe brother branham this is the program of food the message is god's program it shall never be in there it is always be in the what always has and always will be don't expect big crowd stay with the world everybody clear so as they were going in the land of judah they lost everything everybody there they used to be full because naomi says when she was going back she said that i went up full now i'm going up empty they lost their building they lost their church they lost their fellowship all are you there because of the decision roof took she lost everything she lost her spot that she wanted a good spot she used to sit in church you're gonna lose that you lose the building you lose everything going like you are poor struggling like you are starting everything at zero are you there starting everything over you need to find a new building now you need to find new deacons you need to find new trustees we got to rebuild the house over again oh my god but when she was going in the beginning of what take roof chapter one praise the name of the lord lost everything don't fight for it don't fight for it leave it alone there is something in the land of judah there is something in the land of judah better are you there are you there take roof chapter 1 verse 22 so naomi return and roof de moyabadis her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of what in the beginning not is in the season not at the end of the season but at the beginning of the barley harvest are you there but the first thing is when they left the land of moab going into the land of judah roof put herself in the hands of god because ruth say your people will be my people and your god will be my god go to chapter 2 verse 11. if you're there you can say amen and boaz answer and say to her he has fully been shown me that all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband and how you have left your father you see that a dear one a separation happened a split remember on sunday brother branham said sometimes you're going to shake hand with the dear person based on the decision you're going to take are you there he said you left your father and your mother and the land of your nativity and i'll come to a people which you knew not before like abraham get out of your country go to a country where i shall show you how can you do that by faith everybody clear verse 12 the lord will confess your work and a full reward be giving you of the lord god of israel under what whose wings that come to us so when you are moving from a split you need to learn to trust completely under the wings of god do not lean on your own understanding you need to follow the leadership of god because the decision you took is the decision of a narrow way are you there because of the decision you took because of the path you have chosen because of the narrow way a big portion of heaven is waiting you are you there there is a portion of full reward somewhere because of the decision you took you need to begin to rely into the hand of jehovah that's why paul said that god is our sufficiency now entering the land of judah there is a mystery to that land take the toroname 11. when i get like this there's no more time we're in eternity deuteronomy chapter 11. if you dare you can say amen detroit chapter 11 verse 10 we are talking about the land of judah for the land where you go to possession is not as the land of what that's what lot so remember okay from where you came from you came out where you sow your seed and water it with your foot as a garden of heaven in egypt you have to work are you there but in the land of judah you don't put your own effort you have to put on youtube remember the car wash example when you get on a car wash somebody's standing there they're gonna tell you put your car on youtube once the car is on neutral you will continue to move it is not you moving but it's the car wash moving you are there press the name of the lord verse 11 but the land where you go to possess it is the land of hills and valleys and drinks water of the reign of heaven verse 12 a land which what the lord your god care for everybody there for the eyes of the lord your god are always not sometime are you there the land you took a decision to go it is a place where god 24 hours is watching are you there because the money of israel does not sleep nor slumber so you are under full protection are you there because you trusted the wings of jehovah yeah for the eyes of the lord your god are always upon it from there even to the end of the year 360 days you are fully covered this is better than allstate it is better than geigel it is a blessed assurance jesus is mine 360. he's gonna watch off in her family he's gonna watch off with my kids he's gonna watch over my finances he's gonna watch over my business he's gonna watch off am i going out and my coming in from this step forward you gotta learn to trust into the hand of jehovah everybody here so far it was the land where barley bread was available what is wrong with this high calling brother stephen if you notice the bible mentioned barley but the bible never mentioned wheat there is a difference between barley and wheat both of them make bread everybody clear yet they are different brother obama said in the church here his balance on his scale that's revelation 6 6 you see calling out a measure of wheat for what and three measures of barley for what so we see that a measure of wheat costs a penny right but three measures of barley cost also a penny everybody clear in other words the value of a wheat is three times the value of barley i'm reading to you description everybody clear yet both of them are bread see actually that is wheat and barley is what natural stuff of life that is what bread and stuff is made from everybody clear brother branham say here we must have something fresh from who his word today for this the message he is our freshness our bread that fall every day from heaven upon the believer he is our bethlehem god's house of eternal life bread christ was born in bethlehem and became god's house of eternal life bread he is the bread of life he is our bethlehem christ is our the message is your bethlehem now natural bed is called the staff of we call the natural bread like our light bread and stuff we get is called the staff of what so we found out that here both barley and wheat both of them are bred but when roof entered into the land are you there she was entering at the beginning of bali in other words the land of judah have two sort of food are you there the land of judah has both valley and wheat but there is a mystery between barley and wheat are you there take we on roof chapter 22 take roof chapter 2 verse 22 hallelujah praise the name of the lord ruth chapter 2 verse 22 if you dare you can say amen everybody there verse 22 and naomi said to her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with the maiden that they meet you not in any other field we explained this before you must stay in the field of boaz for redemption are you there any kind of field can give you food except boss that's a different food verse 23 so she kept first by demandance of boaz to glean to the end of what so ruth would have to go from the beginning of bali to the end of bali are you there but watch what happened at the end of barley the bible say boss to clean to the end of barley harvest and of water so the harvest of garlic was connected to the harvest of wheat are you there but one but the wheat is already a step behind the belly so when you enter you're going to start with bali but as you're taking care of barley the wheat also is maturing but the wheat is a higher nutritional food three times higher than barley take exodus chapter nine praise the name of the lord at the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new book praise the name of the lord exodus chapter nine if you dare you can say amen verse 9 chapter 9 verse 31 the bible says and the flux and the body was smitten so god spoke to moses i'm going to bring judgment when he brought judgment the barley was smitten with the flats are you there for the barley was in there here and the flats was bold in other words the valley was already mature are you there so when the judgment came it destroyed the body everybody clear verse 32 but the wheat and the eye were not smitten for they were not what are you there so when these crops are growing up the wheat is always lagging behind are you there so the land of judah when you get there you're gonna find two sort of food are you there you will find a food that comes quickly are you there that's your valley you're gonna work on your body are you there but as you taking care of the years of preparation as you taking care of the first stage of brother planet ministry there is also another ministry that was following behind with the opening of the world it is still the bread but it's the bread of that is higher than the body that's why brother branham said not the years of the preparation not when he begin his message but when he begin to sound the message are you there so the message have two kind of food there is a food before 63 and there is a food after 63 the food after 63 matures slowly and comes behind but the value is three times higher than that which was before this hills are you there so when you go to the land of judah there you have a seven course meal you take what is the holy ghost what was the holy ghost giving for you take divine healing you take prophecy you take the gift and then you go to the opening of the world which separates you from the shack [Applause] everybody clear everybody here so far are you there that's what rude took a decision with that mystery hope i cannot see that oppa will stay back lord will stay back it is revealed in the land of judah when you get there you begin to eat this you begin to eat this you begin to eat this as the messenger is moving and the word is maturing then the wheat kicking and then the corner with that fell into the ground not the corner of barley but the corn of wheat which comes ready which is the unfolding of the seven seals which have a value three times higher than the other word but both of them are bread you need buff [Applause] praise the name of the lord everybody clear so far i will not be getting good did i lose anyone praise the name of the lord then when you enter into the land of judah there is a mystery of boaz let's go to ruth chapter 1 chapter 2 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord praise the name of the lord ruth chapter 2 first one i only told them there is no way for you to get married there is no husband in me even if i get married and i get pregnant are you going to be waiting all the way for the baby to be born i mean to grow up for you to get married no hope but that hope will still under the seventh year you only get in the promised land you have to take decision first then god open up when the separation happened then the lord appeared to abraham and say now abraham go back to the right go back to the left go back to the north go back to the south now investigate the entire land oh praise the name of the lord ruth chapter 2 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen and naomi had a kinsmen of her husband he was not revealed in moab a mighty man of what so wealth was in there are you there at the beginning you look poor you lost everything you lost the building don't worry boys is dead are you there boys is not revealing more please reveal after you take a decision after you stand for the message then god will back you up he said of the family of elimelech and his name was who so we found out that boras came from the tribe of judah and we know that boaz gave birth to obed our bed gave birth to jesse jesse gave birth to david on down and christ came out of it what is going on brother stephen seat belt good all right now when moa when the exodus happened for moab going to the land of israel roof by origin was a more about everybody clear so far by being a moabat there was a problem anybody care even though she took her decision there was a problem the problem lies in deuteronomy chapter 23 watch what boras does you ready lord help me strike this please lord let me strike this deuteronomy 23 are you there verse three everybody there an ammonite oh what more about shall we not enter into the of the lord even to the shall they not enter into the congress congregation of the

dare you can say amen am i is after ezra or something yeah nehemiah 13 verse 1 and 3. if you dare you can say it loudly amen so i know you're ready on that day they read in the book of who the law in the audience of the people and darwin was found within that award and the roof should not come into the congregation of god for because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired the belem against them that they should curse them however our god turned the curse into a blessing verse three now it came to pass when they have heard the law that they will did what all what they mixed multitude in other words when the priests brought the law and they read the law israel stop and say who among us is from emma who among us is moab they took all of them and sucked them away you go back to your promise uh to your land we don't need you you cannot be part of the commonwealth you cannot protect into the wealth of israel are you there so roof have that ordinance against

verse 13. are you there for of whom these things are spoken return to another trouble we're talking about melchizedek not the levitical priesthood of aaron you got to see celery oh my god he said for him of whom these things are spoken pretend to another trouble of which no man gave attendance at the altar in other words when they are talking about this priesthood this principle when you look by the law is not existing because by the law you must be a levite are you there but there was a priesthood that was hidden and that priesthood if you look it's not on the liver it is under a different tribe but when you check that trap nobody from that trap work in the altar nobody in that trap working tabernacle which trap is it a royal priesthood everybody there job for verse 14 for it is evident that our who who is our lord our lord sprung out of what oh my goodness so judah have a key to a priesthood a priesthood of mercy and you know by joining judah you are entering in the congregation and you become a royal priesthood and the mentees and death that's why brother branham preached who is this what telling you that you are entering into a royal episode which is judah are you there praise the name of the lord that's the reason you need that priesthood to enter why you are serving god and in the book of revelation he said i will make him a kingdom of what not under levitical law because under levitical law the law said a prince shall never tear his clothes are you there but when jesus was in front of caiaphas caiaphas asked a question and jesus comes they ask a question and come he said you don't understand caiaphas your kingship is finishing the levitical priesthood is going to be knelt down the machine said that he's entering so jesus actually took an effort he said i am he and when characters look he took the cross and did what disqualifying the levitical priest of iron and showing that melchizedek is entering in and mercy said that take your sin and go to the cross and take the ordinance that was against you and narrated the cross and you are forgiven let's stand [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah church

that's going to give you the valley and it's going to give you the weak a decision that's going to bring you into a union a decision that will block out your spin a decision that will justify you because the message brought justification that's why when the cloud appear when they turned it this way it was a why judge that has a white wig and why is he coming as a child because he's indicting
