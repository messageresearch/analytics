Father May touch your children may heal them may Lord Heavenly Father wake up those that are sleeping and may make them realize who they are and may they step Lord Jesus Christ to the new Lord Jesus Christ Revelation that's being showing Lord God I Bender remaining of the service unto you in Jesus Christ name I pray amen amen amen um if we could all go to our scripture Matthew chapter 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 to 19 if you thereare can you say amen amen the scripture says this when Jesus came into the coast of the queria Philippi he he asked his disciple saying whom do men say that I the son of the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophet he said unto them them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said unto said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and and the Gates of Hell shall not pre Prevail against thee and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven may the Lord God bless the reading of his word yall may be seated um from our subject this morning morning IID like to continue on the shout the cry and speak and I remember earlier I was listening to um a military Cadence which is like a song that people in the military sing and one of them goes like it says v i c t o r y victory victory that's my Battle Cry and I just want you to keep that in mind that victory victory I take that as for myself that Victory that's my battlecry for 2025 that Victory is my battlecry amen now for to start off I want to start with the Prophet The Prophet said in 1959 he says sometimes God cannot answer spontaneously how many knows that remember Daniel had prayed and I believe it and it was 21 days or something like that that before the angel could get to him but he finally gets around just leave it alone we already spoke about this I'm just going to like round that that we're going to um s so when um the subject says to shout and to speak because many time people are facing their trials instead of speaking they're just mourning and grieving well God said to speak in many occasion and sometime when people speak they they're they they have doubt in their own word instead of sticking with their word they have doubt and they're like well it's taking forever so since it's taking forever maybe it's not going to happen anymore but the prophet says sometime when God speak it doesn't happen simultaneous and God said that we're also God so when we speak maybe sometime it might not happen simultaneously so we might take our time sometime and in habakuk Chapter 2 verse3 it say for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t see it says it will not t meaning it might not come in your time but it might come in God's time and God's time is always on time even if he appears as if it's late God's time is always on time now in Exodus chapter 13 it says chapter 13:1 17 says and it come and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way of the land of the Philistine Alto that was near for God said let pre-venture the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt because if you look at this because the scripture say God's mind is above ours he knows better for us every step that we take he already pre-ordained it and God already knew that the Israelites were their faith was not at the level for them to go the shorter route to arrive at their destination God already knew that because if they were going they would already start asking back um to return because if you even look when they were crossing through the Wilderness when they didn't have bread they say oh did you come over here to kill us with Hunger see just simple things like that their faith wasn't even lifted up yet so God had to make them go through the Wilderness God God had to make them go through trials and show them to uplift their faith now in job 3: 25 for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid is come unto me I was not I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet troubled see some s c um sometimes when because speaking sometime we speak certain things in our mind you see because speaking is not just something that you uh because when you speak it's just the thought expressed you see speaking is just the word expressed and when you're premeditating certain things you're creating an atmosphere within yourself and that atmosphere will attract whatever you're pondering upon and that's exactly what Paul did I mean job did here as he was premeditating on saying that oh he doesn't have a safu or anything like that when God was protecting him because when Lucifer went up to God and he was like look at your um your son over here and God was saying look at my son and um Lucifer was like well you're prot him he has a fence full of angels but job did not see that now in 1963 God doesn't call men to judgment without first warning him paragraph 112 he says now when he speaks with when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath or whether it's healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the Lord see it might be blessing that he speaks for you might tell you a certain thing and you can't see it at all you say how can it be why it's he told me th sayth the Lord this is going to happen and that was going to happen and it ain't happen the man is wrong now you'll be judged for this believing it but it's going to happen anyhow see it's going to happen this remind me because one time I was hearing certain um Brothers they were talking over the message of um what the what brother brandham had said and talking about how brother Brena had given a prophecy talking about Russia and the United States everything like that and he and one brother was like well the United States is very powerful they have a lot of Army and military power so how can the United State lose and certain things like that and the others were like well brother Brandon say so it doesn't matter brother Brandon say so and if you read over here the prophet say it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not it's going to happen but you will be judged for your doubt you will be judged for your disbelief you see because when you add doubt to the word of God you're hybriding it you see you're hybriding the word of God with doubt and the word of God is not going to work when you have doubt with it even Jesus even Jesus own Ministry brother Jesus did more stuff in brother brenham's life than he's own white because people had doubt people's Faith was not at that level but now people us with the message that we have we should our faith should be higher we should be able to do more greater things that's what Jesus even said the Greater Works that we should do now in paragraph 113 says don't it linger the Bible said yet will it speak in in its in its season it'll come to pass the prophet's only looking off and seeing something he's talking about he's talking about that he's looking at he ain't thinking about here what you look like now he's looking what's going to be and when he speaks that if it's in the word of the lord it's already been spoke and there's no nothing in the world can stop it you see that's right only God himself that and God already said we're God that mean when we speak we should believe on what we say and there's nothing in the world in this world that can stop [Music] it now if we could go to Joshua chapter 6 verse 20 yes sir real quick if you're there can you say amen amen there's few amens amen Joshua chapter 6:2 says so the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city see if you pay attention the wall of Jericho fell down after they shouted because sometime you're going because Jericho can represent um a trial a tribulation in your life sometime you're going through certain things and instead of speaking you're just waiting there like we heard a few um Wednesday pass last Wednesday I believe when uh the word came forth he said Heaven is Waiting on you and you're waiting on Heaven instead of speaking when you're going through something you're just waiting and if you're waiting and you don't speak nothing will happen God came down God acted when they shouted you see because Jericho like I said it's a tribulation it's a war and the prophet says that if you'll notice God telling Moses about the Bible he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period how long it took that's none of our business then he goes ahead and begins to bring in his time of putting seed in the Earth but in the beginning might have been hundreds of billions of trillions of years eons of time but God God created Heaven and the Earth period that settles it that's the first step see he makes no mistake sometime when we're faced St when we say certain things we think that oh because people have this um fairy tale imagination of things that PE that things need to happen in our time need to happen really fast like in America when when you're in America time is something that's even around the world time is something that's very on the budget so you put time even in what you speak you put time in the prophecies in your blessing you put time in them and when you put time in them when it doesn't happen your faith goes down you're wearing out your faith instead of just relying on the word because brother Bram said a real believer genuine True Believer sticks with the word no matter where what because Faith doesn't move and if you have God God who is Faith that faith will not move away from the word of God now in 1963 the prophet says now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again H breed it and it dies that if you mix it with doubt the word of God will die because the scripture says you render the word of God the promises of God of none effect because you keep adding your Creeds and doctrines you're hybriding the word of God and it says paragraph 101 says and Eve the woman was the first hybrid thing that ever was now I hope you don't turn tapes you don't turn tapes off till we get down and prove that after a while see show you just why she was a hybri a bride notice through that brought death through trying to take the word of God and mixing it with some wisdom with it see you're not supposed to do that a Believer is not supposed to do that and whether you believe it got wisdom to explain it just say God said it and that settles it and God said so and that's all that it is to it if if you can't explain it leave it alone but just say it's so cuz God said so see that's it God said so I remember if few a while back when the word was coming forth and they were like everything um even brother brandom's life it's biblical it's tied to the Bible and I did not understand how I didn't know how but I just said amen and then later on the word came when I was looking and meditating and I looked at um I was reading brother Bram when he was going squirrel hunting and everything like that and if you pay very close attention when brother brenon had said two or three is a witness when he said two or three is a witness he was saying that as in the number of um as in the number of squirrel that he wanted but when as I was reading that I was like well two or three is a witness you say two or three but there's nobody with you there see there's nobody with you to M to witness the Miracles that you're doing then later on when he went against squirrel hunting and he lost one and he went back and told the other people that's when it stroke to me that oh brother Brandon's life is um attached to the Bible why because when he said two or three God did not want uh what's it called God wanted to manifest that scripture that two or three is a witness so God let that other squirrel be gone missing the one that he killed to go missing why so brother brand can now have witnesses that's when I noticed well since both of connected now brother Brandon has a witness and brother BR brother Brandon probably at the time didn't even notice that God purposely hid that other squirrel so he can have witnesses because brother Brenham himself say two or three is a witness but he was alone when he went hunting you see and now in paragraph 103 it says now notice now it will not mix it must it must not be tampered with God will punish the one that does it and it will not hybrid to to nothing else it's God's word alone alone God don't need your word with his we're not supposed to speak our word our own word we're supposed to preach his word God's word and God's word only because once again faith is God because if you look at the stature of a perfect man the whole entire thing is God himself and if you have faith you will stick with God's word and you will not deviate right and the prophet say in the spoken words The Original Seed he says what is the seed of life the word of God therefore for life you can't come through a Creed you can't come through a denomination you got to come back to the word now the seed of life all right his word is his seed and his spirit is the water see because the scripture said the power of life and death is in the tongue you see so you need to speak life into everything that you do and instead of speaking Darkness because God called us to be um to be a people to send out blessing and to inherit blessing how are you going to send out blessing if you're not speaking blessing if you're not speaking correctly if you're not speaking um positively you seeall and the prophet say in the statute of a perfect man paragraph 1886 knowledge not worldly IR reasons any kind of worldly um reasons see but faith has no reasoning God reveals to you a certain certain thing is going to happen every scientist in the world could tell you it's contrary it could not happen you believe it anyhow see yes sir it's not it doesn't risen the Bible said we cast down reasons you don't reason with faith faith has no reasoning Faith knows where it's at faith faith acts Faith holds on it can't move nothing can move it I don't care whatever says this that other it doesn't move a bit it stays right there wait wait wait wait don't make any difference it stays right there and people say well I have faith I have faith well did you wait did you stick with your own word did you stick with the word that God gave you the prophet says and speak to the mountain paragraph 36 of 1959 says now then on this scripture I could not justify myself to preach on it how did you notice Jesus said here verily I say unto you if ye shall say to this mountain be plucked up and cast onto the sea and don't doubt but believe in your heart that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you said now I could not justify that because I could not understand it how then could it be that I could say something as a man and then how what if I said something that wasn't according to his word and ask something something was according to his word then it would have to come to pass because Jesus said if if you say not if I say but if you say placing it upon his Apostles upon the Believers whosoever shall say onto this mountain be moved and don't doubt in their heart but believe that what they have sh what they have said shall come to pass they can have what you said not what he said what you said you see because many people like speaking negative things upon their own life when they see the circumstance they like speaking negative things they're like well this this this and the third they're like like if you're my friends a couple of them they would ask me sometime they like um do you ever curse and I'm like no when they asked me have you ever cursed sure I did in the past but have you ever do you ever curse now I'm like no I don't curse why is that I'm like I simply don't curse and the reason why is that is because when the word was being preached earlier um a while back and it said to be perfect and when Abraham the way Abraham was perfect because God told Abraham to be perfect and the Abraham was perfect it was because he was speaking positive he was speaking things into existence he was keeping with God so if I also want to be perfect I should speak positive that mean cursing is not C cursing is not perfect cursing is not of God because God said for us to bless and watch should our curse you see so sticking with God that mean you speak perfect you because the prophet said that God is perfect and if God is perfect his word is perfect and if his word is perfect and you're speaking his word that mean you're speaking perfect that's exactly what um abrah did that's exactly what Abraham did now in paragraph 38 the prophet says now to me that took it away from the atonement and P it upon the person I canot understand it and it's been about three or four years ago when I run so just reading over it it I noticed the three wither and I thought just the miracle of God but yet there wasn't there was something begin to pull at my mind you have you examined that scripture that you can have what you you can have what you have said if you say it and then believe that you have it you can have what you said that puzzled me I just bypassed that that part of the scripture for I realized this that I'm responsible to God for what I say before the purchase of his blood I realize that God will make me answer for it at the day of judgment therefore being sure a human as humanly as possible before I say anything I want to be right and and all through the scripture be right not just right in one place but right in every place it must be exactly the same it must come from Genesis to Revelation the same if he doesn't then I might be saying something wrong that's exactly why I said even when my friends asked me I usually speak perfect even if you ask my there's certain things certain words I don't even say even saying by and stuff like that I don't even say anymore you can ask my cousin they would tell you why but there's certain words certain phrase I don't say Al people say that oh you're being too spiritual and stuff like that I'm like well I don't care when when it's revealed to me I will act according to the Revelation that is revealed to me now in Matthew chapter 26 um paragraph I mean verse 39 it says and he this is Jesus Christ and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will as we've been learning about the human record and the Divine record Jesus was 100% men and 100% God see when he was facing a um tribulation when he was facing a trial and he saw what was coming his human part kicked in and he was like Lord God I don't want to feel this suffering I don't want to feel this pain I don't want to feel this on me but then his Divine part also kicked in and he said not my will but your will you see a lot of us when we're going through Tri instead of letting a Divine part kick in we're relying too much on our Earthly um on our Earthly uh records and if you look even at Malachi 3 where we where the inspiration of the U book of remembrance came from as it was being preached it says and now we call the proud happy yay they that work wickedness are set up yay and they that tempt God are even delivered see many people when they're going to many Believers when they're going through trials they see other people in the world how they're prospering and they're like well God you're doing this and this for them but how about us you're doing this and this for everybody else how about us you see there always keeping they're they're not they're forgetting that God even is a God because I remember if I believe it was proverb chapter 31 the first um 6 to eight verse when he was talking about the way for a king to live and he was say not to drink this and this and the third I was uh I was sharing it with s some of my coworker a while back and as I was sharing it one of the U manager supervision came by and he was like what are you doing I was like since he wanted to be nosy I was like well here's the scripture read this tell me what you think about this then he read it he was like well the scripture is saying for you to just completely drink you see and I was like when I read that scripture the thing that came to my mind was the scripture was telling people you might as well just go on I know it may sound a bit harsh but it was simply saying you might as well go kill yourself why because you're you're as a Believer you have a God why are you in a place where you're so depressed so depressed to the point where you feel like you're already killing yourself because in that way when you're thinking about those stuff and you're because the scripture says give strong drinks to those that are ready to perish you see because if you're already ready to perish you're meditating on that you're spiritually killing yourself you might as well just end it at that you see that's why I say that scripture might be strong but that's that's the way I saw it because God is God if God be God why are you that sad a Believer shouldn't be that sad when a trial is facing a Believer shouldn't be feeling like if there's a rope tied around their neck when they're going through a trial you see and then it says verse 16 it says then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord huren and heard it and the Book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name see those people that pondered upon God and they shall be mine said the Lord of hosts and in that day when I make up my jewels and I I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him see the book of remembrance God created that book because people were pondering about upon him when they're facing a trial they're pondering upon God they're not too too much face um looking at the negative they're not too much looking at the reality that's within them but they're looking at the reality of the word because there's our reality yet after there's God's reality you see when God's word comes forth automatically that's another reality coming in so you should step into that word because when that reality come in and you're not step into the the reality that's going to come you will be left behind you see amen in 1962 brother BR say paragraph 31 of the spoken word now this word of God is eternal God being infinite cannot speak one thing then later on change it to something else to be to a better decision because every decision of god is perfect he cannot once his word is once spoken it can never die it lives on and on and on and can never die because it is God he worth can no more die than he that he can die that's the reason we read in first John or St John first chapter that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh the same word that was spoken in the beginning his with his eternal purpose came on over and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God's word you see God's word does not die God and His word are the same thing and the same thing and since God said also we're um Gods when God's word goes It goes on and on that's what the scripture says and that mean how about us Believers because he said we're God that mean when we speak our words will also go go will also go on and on you see the prophet of God says some years ago I heard that a woman now this may not be authentic that licked her tongue in the uh radium while mixing it to put on hands of th of clocks and watches it killed the woman and years later keeping her skull for an autopsy like they said you could take an instrument whatever they they use and put against that skull bone and with a rumble you could still hear that radium going on in her skull after she had dead after she had been dead for years radium continuously goes on the word of God continuously goes on see when you speak see when you when you speak negative your word will also keep going on see because God said when he gave us the power that mean when you're speaking something negative that mean you're manifesting something negative and I remember a while back when I was um when I was looking to uh an element of ether and I was like I was trying to understand what it was and based on the dictionary definition of ether it's if a very rare uh it's a very rarified and a uh highly elastic substance firmly believed to be a particle of matter and to be a medium whose vibration con constitute light and all the electromagnetic radium in other words it was just like a medium um of space for light and and stuff and I remember brother Brandon spoke uh about ether also he said when you speak your word you speak it to The Ether see and brother B also gave another example um he gave an example over here actually he says I I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it that's a man's voice my voice that I speak today 10,000 years from now could still be picked up in the air you see like dropping a pedal in the middle of a pond the tiny little waves after they fail to be seen by the eyes continue until he hits the bank and the Air wave of our voice continually travels around the world around the world therefore then our voice what we say will will be or judgment you see when you're speaking curses and you're speaking negative over your life it will keep going all the way to judgment that's why you will be judged upon you see exactly Our Testimony will our testimony will rise right against us our own voices will echo in our own ears at the Judgment bar of God when his great instrument catches every voice that's been spoke every word that's been moded and now there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong see there's only one way whenever you speak negative over your life because even with my siblings I apply this even with my siblings whenever I'm talking to them if a negative thought come or I'm about to say something wrong I automatically stop my and I'm like Lord God forgive me I Repent automatically because there's only one person that can take back that word that you speak and it says and now there's only one way to stop that voice that that's wrong that's repent God Alone can stop it if he doesn't it goes on and meets up with you in eternity therefore God being perfect and his voice Eternal his own voice will have to catch up with it therefore he must be perfect in every decision for when he once say something it has to go all the way and come back to the Jud U come back to the Judgment you see when you speak negative and because brother BR was pondering upon this he like what if I say something negative that mean God gave us the PN if I say something negative it will happen then how would I take it back and the way to take it back is repent and put it up to God just bring it up to God and God is the only one that's capable of taking it because if you look at Psalms it says only God judges the god you see that mean only God is capable of taking that away the words that you spoke in the negative words that You' spoken or that somebody has spoken over your life only God is capable of taking that away just bring it back to God now in paragraph 88 brother BR says and something said to me say what you will will be done this um this was actually when brother BR was given a warning that he was going to be trapped and brother BR didn't know what the Trap was but it was two couples that were um that were casing in the U front row and just distracting the prophet and it says something said say blindness and you will be blind say death and they shall pack them they shall pack them out say what you will see I was thinking about this because I remember um if you remember the spirit of comes on five times and when he came first he was in Elijah the second time he was in in Elisha and if you pay very close attention the spirit of Elijah which is the spirit of God in the prophet the spirit of Elija of Elijah in Elisha spoke death because there were little children that were making fun of him because of the circumstance that he was in he spoke death and killed about 41 little children but watch that same Spirit came back now in brother brandham and watch what brother brandham speaks he says I could couldn't speak I couldn't move and he just left I thought God what what must I do and I turned and he stood there and his face why looking at me I thought what must I say and I turned then I turned and looked like before I knew it what i' say I said I forgive you I forgive you of your act and it must have been just the right thing to say it was God trying a reaction on an action that's that night it was revealed to me that I had said the right thing I know it was all leading to something but what was it what to do see the spirit the spirit of Elijah in Elisha spoke death but the spirit of Elijah in brother Brandon spoke life he spared them he spoke Grace he spoke mercy and since we're since we're under the since we're under the leadership in this age we're under the leadership of God under the leadership of brother brandham who's under God that mean we're supposed to repeat what he did he showed Grace and Mercy there some of us when we're facing trials and people are just cursing at us people are speaking bad towards us and some of us tend to um speak bad back back to them you see instead of speaking bad just say I forgive you you see show mercy and Grace just as your Prophet has showed mercy and Grace you see now as for the shout as for the shout because remember when you shout when you speak that's when the Wall comes down you see that's when God steps into the sin and and stuff happens it says um in 1965 lean not to your own understanding paragraph 147 lean not to your own understanding if you lean on your own understanding today when you are sick maybe sitting in a wheelchair dying with cancer heart trouble and doctor says you're going to die if you lean to that understanding you'll die but don't lean to that understanding certainly not because I have a friend who told me um his parents say oh you might have this symptoms and stuff like that they're not it wasn't his biological U family he said you um you might have their symptoms and he told me about that and when he told me that symptom they said oh you might have this disease I told him well the symptom that you just came from telling me just sound like something everyday children do that's not really a symptom they're trying to speak over your life and stuff like that you're accepting you shouldn't accept it at all you see see I have no problem with doctors and stuff like that when I'm Ill I would go to the hospital and when they will tell me what I have now I know the name of the devil that I'mma go home and speak over you see that's simply it and brother brandham says what about at what about at the walls of Jericho that they say they could run a chariot race around the top of them them great big walls God said go up there and March around it so many times and sound the trumpet and all of you let out a shout and the war is going to fall down you see well that was absolutely would be silly to the cornal mind but Joshua knowing how thick the how thick those walls was cuz he sir cuz he had built plenty of walls down in Egypt he know the cement that was in them how tight they were to hold them chariot races races on top and even houses built on top of it because if you remember back in Egypt the whole Israelites were slaved that mean all of them probably had a PhD in construction you see and but he didn't lean to his own understanding he buil he believed what God Said was true and obeyed his word and was and and the walls fell down leading not to his own understanding you see he relied on God he did not rely on that experience that he gained from being in Egypt you see and brother Brenham say in the Patrick of Abraham paragraph 58 brothers and sisters when he got over there Jericho was all walled up high enough that they could run three three chariots across the top how could these Israelites do it with barriers picked up sword and everything and stick sticks and stones how were they going to go in there but he was still in the Seed of Abraham God gave give him a vision Tau him how to do it said sound a Tropic amen that's it let let out a shout March up towards the wall and the gates will fall before you you see just let out a shout and your problem will come to an end amen he was a royal Seed of Abraham he was was God's real believer the gates will drop down before you just let out a shout and sound the trumpet that's all you have to do and what happened the gates fell down and Joshua took the city because the word said whatever you bound on Earth shall be bound in heaven so just let out your word just speak your word brother Brandon Contin continues and says in L to on understanding paragraph 149 says what if he was fighting the battle and as I was preaching on Sunday and then the sun was going down and the enemy was routed that night they would get together and they would come with another Force kill plenty of men now what if what if he would have said I need some daylight I've got to have some more sun sunlight well now wait a minute god Set this order and the sun turns so the World Turns now let's see if I would say for the sun to stop maybe if the world stops now then it lose its gravity gravitation and I'll fall you see he didn't listen to his understanding only thing he said was Sun stand still and moon stay where you are and it was and he obeyed him he didn't lean to his own understanding but he leaned to the promise of God I have given you that land go and get it because many time people tend to rely on on their own understanding based on what's Happening based on the circumstance people rely on their own understanding because many of my friends some be like in this economy you can't do this this and the third and when I look at them I'm like well God put me in this economy that mean I can't do this this and the third God cannot put you in a place where you're incapable of doing something you see and the prophet say didn't Jesus say the prophets who who the word of God came to who did the word of God come to congregation said prophets prophets didn't Jesus call them gods why why God was manifested in them what was it the spoken word manifested see that's it said how can you deny say if you had any wisdom you'd understand he said how can you say how can you say you we call them God himself called them Gods God himself called you God how would you deny that If you deny that you're you're denying your own identity you see you're denying your own position your own rights you see and the prophet continu says the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed and as long as it's laying here it it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes in the heart when it begins to manifest by the by the Holy Spirit The Works of God then Visions come Powers comes humilities come all all your know it all is gone you come nothing you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives there it is cuz he died I live and when I die he lives and when I die he promised me life and I died and I died out to myself so in order I can have his life and now and how do I do it by taking his word his seed put his seed in here by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said you see when when you die to yourself and rely on that mind that let that Mind Of God be in you and you rely on that mind it's not you living anymore but it's God in you they ask that you do is no longer your act but it's God himself acting and just like when brother Brown was pondering about how did the prophets do all that before the atonement because the holy spirit in them is the one that's speaking it's not them who's speaking but the Holy Spirit the third person of the trinity in you that's working and that's doing their works that's right and the prophet says you can't be a seed and disagree with the word because the word is the seed and if you're the if you are the word how can you disagree with it you'd be disagreeing with yourself you'd be defeating your own purpose you see like somebody said why would you why would you ever go out with them people like that and well if I didn't do it I'd be defeating the very purpose I was saying here for there's got to be a light like when they ask Jesus and Jesus were like well I'm with the poor I'm with the people that are sick because they need me you see and if you don't act upon the word that's given unto you the prophet say you're defying yourself because many people many believer many Believers when they're going through a trial instead of looking upward they're just looking down they have their head down you see I remember when the word was spoken over here he said he said young man's young sister when you're walking walk with your head up you see walk with your head up your chest to walk bold you see stop walking with your head down because God is not down there God is up there so you have to look up as you're walking you see you have to look up as you're walking look up to God you see the prophet of God said do you think it was the prophets talking have you have not you just got through preaching on this subject that the prophets was so Anointed with the holy spirit that it wasn't them that done it speaking it was the Holy Spirit in them crying out then whatever you say if you're anointed wouldn't be you saying it it would be the Holy Spirit saying it well I thought if that may that's right the person through the atonement Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with the god with God so close that he can be wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the holy spirit in speaking these things and no matter then I'd say tell the anointing the anointing of the Holy Spirit struck me like that I've never had before in my in in all my life God knows that I raised up to my feet God scared and something said now this is the beginning of your new ministry now ask what you will and it shall be done it shall be given to you you see this was the spoken word that that Revelation that you need to speak was the beginning of brother B new ministry and brother Bram needed to step into that new ministry you see because many Believers when they're walking in their Journey of Faith when they're walking through the Journey of the life of brother Brenham instead of walk because when brother Bren stepped into a a new ministry many people don't step into a new ministry see when brother BR steps into a new revelation many people don't step into a new revelation like like these past few years that's been going around when the word is coming and talking about Christmas yes brother Bram used to celebrate Christmas or speak about but when a new revelation Came Upon him and he stepped into that new revelation why must you stick to the bad re the old Revelation that brother Bram had you see you need to step into that new revelation now brother BR continues and says so going on up there that anointing struck me again and said if it isn't there say it be there and you'll find the squirrel and I said Lord I'm taking your word now I said and I shall find the squirrel on the mountain on the mountain I went and I thought no need for me to fear anymore cuz I'm going to find it that's all I done said it and the Lord said when that anointing was on me when I said anything it would be that way so I'm going I'm going on see brother Brandon from there on was stepping into his new ministry he was stepping into the new revelation so y'all tonight need to also steep into the new ministry steep into the new revelation you see when brother Brandon was in um when brother brand had the first uh oil when the second oil came he had to step into that second oil I don't know why people are still um relying on that old oil that had already burnt out you see they're relying on the burnt out oil instead stepping into the new oil the new oil which is unlimited because if you look when when the spirit of Elijah multiplied the oil the first time it was limited it was in a space of three and a half year but when he came again and multiplied oil it was until that that family had passed away you see it was unlimited brother brandom says the angel of the Covenant well you people who's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost has got a witness has got a witness Jes that Jesus Christ lives and Reign ought to be an easy thing for you to believe in Divine Healing why Joshua know just as soon as they started shouting the WS was going to drop the victory was his cuz God said so that's a said so see you need to speak that's why I say even earlier victory victory that's my battlecry that's my battlecry throughout 2025 you see and I will stick to that and I will stick to that let me just read one more um quotes then I'll will let y'all go I know it's a Wednesday night [Applause] now in closing in 1959 speak to the mountain paragraph 205 brother brandham says this brother brand says this I believe that the Christ I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to be sh that's going to shake the whole world that's right that's the first time it's been that's the first time it's been since the days of of Jesus of Nazareth to human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't see don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled being fulfilled and oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking I'm looking for it happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now just like me I'm wanting it to also happen here you see I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by a word the the sick will be healed by a word blind will see the de will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike that I believe it's going to stract that it's going to strict the Church of God soon and it's going to start a Revival that's that will shake the world I believe it the Lord God Of Heaven who made heaven and Earth who who whose servant I am and stand here now before you in the name of Jesus Christ those words are true uh oh we're near something my heart is waiting with anticipation I can't even rest in my hotel in my hotel room last night I couldn't even I couldn't sleep at all it's never left me I couldn't sleep on the road out here I didn't sleep about 2 or 3 hours a night night I couldn't I I just can't rest because I know that something is fixing to happen or God is going to move on the scene just as sure as we're standing here just as sure as he said back Yonder about the discernment in the hand of in the hand and the secrets of the heart he promised he's promised something else and here is the is and here it is already confirmed among the people and the people standing here you see and the people standing there just to sum it up the message today I want you when you go back home when you go back to your daytoday life just speak the word over your obstacles because God said the power of life and death is in your hand if if you even look at history in when you watch the France their Kingdom when they had their independence or whatever when they had it they asked the the queen what do um the people are hungry the people want something and she was like let them eat cake and what she spoke brought death onto her because she not think about what she was speaking properly she did not have the right thing to say she said the wrong thing and he brought death and C some of us were saying the wrong thing in our situation I want you to forget that and stick to the word of God and speak the right thing as many people as many Saints in the Bible has even Esther Esther when Esther was going she didn't know what the um what the king liked but when she went over there and then many people were speaking their were picking up their own garment and she spoke the right thing by asking oh can you dress me can you tell me what the king like because she's a woman she could have been like well I'm a woman I know how to dress you see I know what fits me but she relied on the uh on the um on the Chamberlain she relied on the Chamberlain and I want you to speak positive speak the right things stick to the word of God and say Amen to every word that come just like sister AR right when when the word had came and the pastor the prophet was talking about his miracles she said that's right and she didn't even know what to speak but then the spirit told her what to speak and she said the right thing you see I want you to speak under the inspiration and speak and prophesy under God I remember when I was looking at the um book of Deuteronomy chapter 2728 it was when Israelite was stepping into a new place you see there there was this whole entire law that came and he was telling them oh you have blessing on this blessing on top of blessing on top of blessing if you follow God's word you will have blessing and blessing and blessing but there's also another side to it you see when you don't listen to God because when I was listening to I was like that is very because one of the scriptures said even a man can espouse a woman to be married but that he says it wishes for them that if you ask um if you ask a woman to be married with them the curses says that I pray that even your neighbor will sleep with her before you marry him I was like that is very harsh but that's only due if you don't follow the word because there was blessing and there was Curse God blessed the Earth and bless the ground that they're with they bless their flocks and everything but at the same time if you don't stay with the word God will that same word will change and that that judgment will fall down you see because the Bible said Prosper as your spirit Prosper it doesn't say Prosper as your imagination and Fantasies Prosper it said Prosper as your soul Prosper you see because if your soul is aligned with God and the more you grow with God the more you will prosper you see the more blessing will come to you you see that's why my prayer for 2025 as we're stepping into 2025 we already stepped into 2025 for the remaining of the year some people already gave up and it's only the first month you see it's only the first month so I want you to keep pushing even if it's hard keep pushing and stay in right with the word may the Lord God bless you if we could all stand so we can pray let us let us bow ahead let us bow oure in prayer Lord heavenly father I come before you tonight Lord heavenly father to Thank You Lord God for the
