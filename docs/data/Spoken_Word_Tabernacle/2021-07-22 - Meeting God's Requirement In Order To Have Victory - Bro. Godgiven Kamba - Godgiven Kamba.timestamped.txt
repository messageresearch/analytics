[43:36] i don't want to take much of your time
[43:39] if you

[43:42] return to the book
[43:44] of exodus chapter 12.
[43:57] exodus chapter 12 we will read
[44:01] 1-13
[44:06] amen
[44:09] let us start from three
[44:12] speaking unto all the congregation of
[44:15] israel
[44:16] saying in the 10th day of this month
[44:19] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[44:23] according to the house of their fathers
[44:26] a lamb for a in-house and
[44:30] if the household bit too little for the
[44:33] lamb
[44:34] let him and his neighbor next unto his
[44:37] house
[44:38] take it according to the number of the
[44:40] souls
[44:42] every man according to his eating shall
[44:45] make
[44:45] your count for the lamb your lamb
[44:48] shall be without blemish a male of the
[44:52] first
[44:52] year you shall take it out from the
[44:56] from the sheep or from the goats
[44:59] and you shall keep it until the 14th
[45:02] day of the same month and the whole
[45:06] assembly of the
[45:07] of the congregation of israel shall kill
[45:11] it
[45:11] in the evening and they shall take
[45:15] off the blood and strike it on the two
[45:18] side post and on the upper door
[45:22] post of the houses wherein
[45:25] they shall eat it and they shall eat the
[45:29] flesh
[45:30] in the in that night wrought with fire
[45:34] and unleavened bread and with a bitter
[45:37] herbs
[45:38] they shall eat it it's not
[45:41] of it raw not sudden at all with water
[45:45] but
[45:46] roast with fire his head with his legs
[45:50] and with the prudence thereof
[45:54] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[45:58] until the morning and that which
[46:01] remaineth
[46:02] of it until the morning you shall burn
[46:06] with fire and thus shall he eat it
[46:11] with your lawns gilded your shoes
[46:15] on your feet and your stuff
[46:18] in your hand and you shall eat it
[46:20] enhanced
[46:22] it is the lord's passover
[46:25] for i will pass through the land of
[46:28] egypt this night
[46:29] and we smite all the first born
[46:32] in the land of egypt both men
[46:36] and beasts and against all the gods
[46:39] of egypt are we i will
[46:42] execute judgment i am the lord
[46:46] and the blood shall be to you for a
[46:49] talking
[46:50] upon the houses where you are and when
[46:53] i see the blood i will pass over you
[46:57] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[47:00] destroy you
[47:01] when i smite the land of egypt
[47:05] may the lord add blessing on the reading
[47:08] of its word you might be seated
[47:12] so i know you
[47:18] this scripture you know it very well
[47:25] i believe brother brother stephen went
[47:27] through this
[47:28] many times uh but this evening
[47:33] when brother bradham read it he preached
[47:35] on the token
[47:37] uh this evening by the help of the lord
[47:40] i will not speak
[47:41] on the token i would like to
[47:44] speak on meeting god's
[47:48] requirement in order to have
[47:51] victory
[47:55] meeting god's requirement in order to
[47:58] have
[47:59] victory so we see
[48:02] in life brother bradham told us the
[48:05] natural
[48:06] is a type of a spiritual so if we look
[48:10] in this
[48:11] in the natural first we found that in
[48:14] almost every day everything we do there
[48:18] we meet some requirement
[48:21] in our everyday work
[48:25] you might say i i don't i don't get that
[48:28] but
[48:31] if today you want to go maybe to
[48:35] europe or any other country you
[48:39] you always wanted to go if you do really
[48:43] want to go in that country
[48:46] you will show some interest
[48:49] and you would like to know what are the
[48:52] requirements
[48:53] for me to go to that country
[48:57] if i am an american do i need a visa
[49:01] and if you don't need a visa do i have
[49:04] my passport with me
[49:06] if you don't have a passport then it
[49:08] will be time for you
[49:09] to look for a passport then when you get
[49:13] your passport
[49:14] you have to know how much the ticket
[49:17] cost for me
[49:18] to buy then you look around and
[49:21] see your bank account if you have enough
[49:24] money
[49:25] to buy a ticket and
[49:28] when you put all those requirements
[49:30] together then you can decide if you will
[49:33] do it or not
[49:34] and we found that sometimes people want
[49:37] to do things
[49:38] but when they look on the requirement
[49:41] they become so
[49:42] limited you might say oh i want to buy
[49:47] a house or to buy a house
[49:50] is is good but it comes with a
[49:52] requirement
[49:54] you have to meet some requirement in
[49:56] order for you to buy a house
[49:59] you might go and see and say oh i need
[50:01] this type of house
[50:02] oh well oh it's good then they will ask
[50:05] you
[50:06] how much are you making
[50:10] is your income enough for you to afford
[50:12] the mortgage
[50:14] then they will give you the least of the
[50:16] requirements
[50:17] you will look you go through and maybe
[50:19] you say oh no
[50:21] i i won't be qualified
[50:25] or maybe yes i see what it did for me
[50:28] to buy this type of house then i have to
[50:31] go
[50:31] maybe work hard for my
[50:35] income to meet the requirement for me to
[50:38] obtain
[50:38] what i need so you see all of these
[50:42] is a requirement that we have to meet
[50:45] and we work hard to meet this
[50:47] requirement
[50:48] every single day
[50:50] [Music]
[50:52] you might have money on your bank
[50:54] account
[50:55] you cannot just go and present yourself
[50:57] and say i need to draw money from
[50:59] my my bank the banker will say yes sir
[51:04] do you have your atm card with you
[51:08] oh yes can you swipe and put your
[51:12] pin why because they need to make sure
[51:15] is you the owner of that bank
[51:17] and if the amount is above the limit
[51:20] they will say
[51:20] can i have your id
[51:24] you see all these are requirements
[51:27] we walk according to the law and we meet
[51:30] those
[51:31] requirements for us to receive
[51:34] whatever we have need of you can go and
[51:37] argue with a banker oh it's my bank
[51:39] account
[51:40] a hat they will look at you say yes sir
[51:44] we know is your bank account we want to
[51:46] verify
[51:48] is for your own good you might say oh
[51:52] yes
[51:52] is my but i forgot my wallet i'm sorry
[51:56] we need your id we need your
[51:59] atm we need something to identify who
[52:03] you are
[52:05] so
[52:08] schools they have a requirement
[52:11] there's some type of school that you
[52:13] cannot just go
[52:14] the way you want they say okay maybe
[52:17] apply
[52:18] put an application is a lottery or
[52:21] whatever
[52:22] or maybe for you to be accepted in this
[52:25] school
[52:25] your gpa needs to be this this and that
[52:28] all that
[52:29] are requirement amen
[52:33] job there is a job requirement oh you
[52:36] can look on the internet and you see
[52:39] a good job paying a nice pay
[52:42] but you see down there they say job
[52:46] description
[52:47] and then requirement you need to be this
[52:49] and that
[52:50] you have to be work to have experience
[52:53] of this amount of years
[52:55] you see why they want to make sure the
[52:58] guy
[52:59] who we will take what we high have
[53:02] experienced to do the job he's applying
[53:05] for
[53:07] so we have to meet this requirement in
[53:10] our daily work
[53:12] then i start to look around
[53:16] we look around the christians you meet
[53:19] people
[53:19] good people they love the lord
[53:22] when you talk to them they have a heart
[53:25] for god
[53:26] but when you look around very closely
[53:29] you find out that something is just
[53:32] missing somewhere something just
[53:36] wrong somewhere then we'll we start to
[53:39] think
[53:40] what is the problem what is going on
[53:44] amen and then we have to find out the
[53:47] reason
[53:48] the thing that is not working right
[53:52] for us to work on the thing
[53:56] for the thing to work the way it's
[53:58] supposed to
[54:00] amen you see
[54:03] god is a god of his word
[54:08] when we read the bible most of the time
[54:12] we bypass
[54:14] a lot of things we always jump
[54:18] to the promises of god we read the bible
[54:21] the bible says by his
[54:23] tribe we are healed it's the promise of
[54:27] god and then when we take that promise
[54:29] we stand before god oh lord you said
[54:32] by your stripe we are healed yes
[54:36] but you see
[54:39] but brother abraham say every
[54:42] promise in the bible every promises of
[54:46] god is always attached to a requirement
[54:50] or a condition amen
[54:54] but when we read the bible we present
[54:57] the word of god
[54:59] we take the promise then we pray
[55:02] and nothing is happening then we have to
[55:06] find out
[55:07] what the reason is why
[55:10] god made a promise but why we don't see
[55:14] a result amen
[55:18] there is a reason and we cannot stay
[55:22] and complaining complaining complaining
[55:25] like
[55:26] god has changed our god is the same god
[55:31] god never changed his word is the same
[55:35] he's the same yesterday today and
[55:37] forever
[55:39] hallelujah but you see
[55:42] we always quote hebrew 13
[55:46] we say jesus christ is the same
[55:49] yesterday today
[55:50] and forever but
[55:55] for him to be the same for you
[55:58] you have to identify yourself with
[56:01] hebrew 13
[56:02] 7. hebrew 13
[56:06] 7 is where you have to adapt for
[56:09] yourself
[56:10] because hebrew 13 8 is where god is
[56:16] amen god is
[56:20] in hebrew 13 8 but he wants you to be
[56:25] hebrew 13 7 hallelujah
[56:29] when you become hebrew 13 7
[56:32] then jesus will be the son yesterday
[56:36] today and forever for you
[56:40] oh glory be to god thank you jesus
[56:44] you see we have to come
[56:47] back to the world we have to see what
[56:51] god
[56:51] needs for you and now
[56:55] because it looks like people are so
[56:58] defeated
[57:01] people are so discouraged
[57:04] people have a lot of questions
[57:08] but no answer
[57:12] but the answer is in the word
[57:16] amen the answer is in the word
[57:21] you see there is a way
[57:25] of following jesus
[57:29] jesus you cannot just follow him
[57:32] any kind of way you
[57:36] can become a member of a church
[57:40] you can be a follower of a preacher
[57:45] that is your problem but when
[57:48] you be you want to be a follower of
[57:52] jesus jesus
[57:56] gives a requirement he gives you a
[57:59] condition
[58:02] for you to be his follower
[58:05] he says here in matthew chapter 16
[58:11] 24-26 then
[58:14] jesus then said
[58:17] jesus unto his disciple if
[58:20] any man will come after me
[58:24] let him deny himself
[58:28] oh hallelujah we can stop right there
[58:32] and finish our service right there or if
[58:35] you want to follow
[58:36] jesus jesus gives you
[58:40] a condition on how you have to follow
[58:43] him
[58:44] you cannot just walk up and say i'm
[58:46] following jesus
[58:47] no jesus tells you if you want to follow
[58:51] me
[58:52] you have to deny yourself
[58:56] not only that but take
[58:59] up his cross and
[59:02] follow me oh hallelujah
[59:06] what is a cross a cross is a symbol of
[59:10] death you cannot follow jesus being
[59:13] alive
[59:15] oh hallelujah you have to deny yourself
[59:18] you have to deny your thoughts you have
[59:21] to unite your mind
[59:23] you have to deny your existence
[59:27] you become dying to yourself then you
[59:29] can follow jesus
[59:32] jesus is the word and there is a way of
[59:36] following him
[59:38] jesus has a requirement
[59:41] each time he gives a promise that
[59:44] promise
[59:44] is always followed by a requirement
[59:48] or a condition
[59:51] o 25 say this
[59:58] for whosoever will save his life
[1:00:01] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[1:00:05] his life
[1:00:06] for my sake shall find it
[1:00:15] matthew chapter 10 38
[1:00:19] says this and he that
[1:00:22] taketh not his cross and followed me
[1:00:26] and followed after me is not worthy
[1:00:30] of me you see deny
[1:00:35] means to refuse reject
[1:00:39] decline stat that one refuses to
[1:00:43] admit the truth or existence of
[1:00:50] so you have to deny yourself
[1:00:55] in order for you to follow jesus brother
[1:00:58] brahm says this
[1:01:00] in the envision of the united states
[1:01:04] he says and the people is not
[1:01:07] at blame it is from behind the platform
[1:01:13] where it's come from exactly
[1:01:16] it's from behind the platform they teach
[1:01:20] them
[1:01:20] all kinds of rhythms and all kind of
[1:01:24] this and that and organizations
[1:01:27] and how to make youth groups and
[1:01:30] everything like that
[1:01:32] i wonder if that is paid
[1:01:36] nothing against it but i'm wondering
[1:01:39] if that is god's requirement
[1:01:43] when jesus said except a man be
[1:01:47] born of water and spirit he will
[1:01:50] in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:56] he that will follow after me let him
[1:01:59] deny
[1:02:00] himself and his own
[1:02:03] worldly pleasures take up his cross
[1:02:08] and follow after me cross
[1:02:11] is a symbol of death agony
[1:02:16] he that will be a christian let him
[1:02:20] strip
[1:02:21] strip himself off his own thought
[1:02:24] let him strip himself of his own works
[1:02:28] let him strip himself of everything
[1:02:32] denying himself and take up that
[1:02:35] consecrated cross and follow me
[1:02:40] daily a christian walk
[1:02:44] brother and sister this is a daily walk
[1:02:47] we have to die every single day
[1:02:52] oh hallelujah because we know you and i
[1:02:55] before we leave this earth
[1:02:58] this church of jesus christ will
[1:03:02] reach a perfection
[1:03:05] oh hallelujah we have to reach it
[1:03:08] in order for us
[1:03:11] we will be so perfect until
[1:03:15] grave will not be able to
[1:03:18] hold our loved one oh hallelujah
[1:03:23] we know that all the saints that died
[1:03:27] are waiting for you and me
[1:03:33] all the saints
[1:03:37] are waiting for you and me
[1:03:42] then what kind of work
[1:03:47] we should have and what type of life we
[1:03:51] should have
[1:03:55] when we are unable to take just a little
[1:03:58] bit of
[1:03:58] pressure
[1:04:02] but yet daily every day
[1:04:06] we say oh jesus is coming oh we are
[1:04:09] waiting the coming of the lord
[1:04:12] is good towards the coming of the lord
[1:04:15] but are you going to be
[1:04:16] a part of those who will be raptured
[1:04:22] you say oh is by grace yes it's by grace
[1:04:27] but if you don't know what the grace of
[1:04:30] god is
[1:04:34] you will you will miss explain
[1:04:37] and mistake the grace of god
[1:04:41] the person who knows what the grace of
[1:04:43] god
[1:04:45] is that person
[1:04:48] the kind of life he lives is a different
[1:04:51] type of life
[1:04:52] because he knows what grace means
[1:04:56] grace is not like go live all kind of
[1:04:59] life any way you want
[1:05:01] if that what grace means then i didn't i
[1:05:04] don't need that kind of grace
[1:05:08] amen to god be the glory
[1:05:13] we look job still job stood part
[1:05:18] for he knew that god well he was certain
[1:05:23] he was god for he had talked with him
[1:05:28] and he had met his requirement he
[1:05:31] searched down
[1:05:33] and found out
[1:05:38] i've made every burnt offering
[1:05:41] i said in my heart perhaps when my sons
[1:05:46] gave a feast and my daughters attended
[1:05:49] perhaps maybe they did secretly sin
[1:05:53] in their heart so i will offer a burnt
[1:05:57] offering
[1:05:58] for them and confess they sin they're
[1:06:02] wrong
[1:06:05] a christian when something happened
[1:06:09] in our lives in our family in our home
[1:06:13] or between a brethren
[1:06:17] a christian is not a someone who just
[1:06:20] jumping get in fire and start acting
[1:06:23] kind of
[1:06:23] all kind of way but a christian
[1:06:28] we stay calm and we try to find a reason
[1:06:34] we try to find out why this has happened
[1:06:39] and he will go searching until he found
[1:06:44] what went wrong and then he will be
[1:06:47] eligible if he has to make things right
[1:06:51] he will make it right and have peace in
[1:06:54] his heart
[1:06:56] but when things happen most of the time
[1:06:59] we are the
[1:07:00] first one to look the devil
[1:07:03] and start pointing fingers
[1:07:06] he is the cause he is the one he is the
[1:07:09] one
[1:07:09] he is the one
[1:07:13] where did that happen to job job knew
[1:07:17] god was god he knew that god was alive
[1:07:22] he talked with him and suddenly
[1:07:26] things that will happen in his family
[1:07:28] job
[1:07:30] went on searching to find
[1:07:33] what went wrong amen
[1:07:37] oh god
[1:07:41] oh god when a man keeps
[1:07:45] what god said do
[1:07:48] he is certain he's god
[1:07:51] he has to answer
[1:07:54] faith calls him on the sin
[1:07:58] every time
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:02] oh hallelujah i like this
[1:08:06] when a man keeps what god
[1:08:09] said do this is
[1:08:12] where the problem comes
[1:08:16] the problem is not the word of god
[1:08:20] this is what i'm trying to bring to your
[1:08:22] attention
[1:08:24] the problem is not god
[1:08:28] the problem is how you take what god
[1:08:31] said is when
[1:08:34] you skip your portion
[1:08:38] and you stand before god lord you said
[1:08:43] sometimes we make god sick
[1:08:49] when he knows that yes i made a promise
[1:08:53] but do your part then come i will do
[1:08:56] mine
[1:08:58] but we keep our part we want god to do
[1:09:02] his
[1:09:03] there is no way god can do it god
[1:09:07] will never compromise his word
[1:09:10] hallelujah we have to come the way of
[1:09:14] the lord
[1:09:15] we have to come according to his
[1:09:18] promises
[1:09:19] in order for us to see the victory
[1:09:24] oh to god be the glory
[1:09:27] jesus the son of the living god

[1:09:34] let's go to the book of mark chapter 10.
[1:09:42] mark 10 let us read
[1:09:46] 17-21

[1:10:02] there came one running notice that he
[1:10:06] was not walking
[1:10:08] he was running
[1:10:11] and nailed to him humility
[1:10:15] and asked him good master
[1:10:19] what shall i do that i may inherit
[1:10:22] eternal life and jesus said unto him
[1:10:26] why call is thou me good
[1:10:29] there is no good but one that is god

[1:10:38] adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:10:41] do not bear false witness defraud not

[1:10:49] and he answered and said unto him
[1:10:52] master all
[1:10:56] these have i observed from my youth
[1:11:01] then jesus beholding him
[1:11:04] loved him
[1:11:09] and said unto him one
[1:11:12] thing that lacketh
[1:11:16] go thy way sell whatsoever thou
[1:11:19] hast and give to the poor
[1:11:23] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:11:26] and come take up the cross
[1:11:29] and follow me
[1:11:38] this man came to jesus
[1:11:42] running running
[1:11:46] and he came and knelt down
[1:11:49] this person stood before
[1:11:53] the eternal life himself
[1:11:57] what an opportunity
[1:12:00] he was rich but he was not satisfied
[1:12:05] he knew that something was lacking
[1:12:08] he has a possession but in his heart he
[1:12:12] knew i'm lacking something
[1:12:14] and that thing was eternal life
[1:12:17] then he knew was one who was able to
[1:12:21] give him
[1:12:22] what he was lacking and that one was
[1:12:25] jesus oh hallelujah
[1:12:29] he came and stood before jesus
[1:12:32] good master should i do
[1:12:37] for me to have eternal life
[1:12:42] oh jesus look at him and say

[1:12:55] to don't have
[1:12:57] he look jesus on the face
[1:13:02] all of these i have
[1:13:06] observed since my youth
[1:13:10] jesus never questioned him
[1:13:13] of his claim
[1:13:17] but he looked his life jesus
[1:13:20] found what the problem
[1:13:24] was and he said
[1:13:28] now one thing o mine
[1:13:33] jesus can jesus look at you
[1:13:37] tonight and search your life
[1:13:41] and say i find only one thing you are
[1:13:44] lacking
[1:13:46] only one thing you are lacking
[1:13:51] this man was lacking only one thing

[1:14:00] changing him from receiving eternal life

[1:15:06] oh when i think about this man
[1:15:10] he stood face to face with
[1:15:14] eternal life
[1:15:18] jesus scanned his entire life
[1:15:23] and found only one problem
[1:15:29] jesus looked at him and loved him
[1:15:35] oh the love of god
[1:15:39] oh you say jesus loved him yes
[1:15:42] he looked him and loved him
[1:15:46] but the love of jesus
[1:15:50] was not able to compromise
[1:15:55] with his word
[1:15:59] come go sell everything you have
[1:16:04] if you want eternal life
[1:16:08] take up your cross and follow me
[1:16:14] brother and sister there is a way
[1:16:17] of following jesus and that way
[1:16:21] many of us come to church
[1:16:24] but we are not on that way
[1:16:29] we are not on that way that is the
[1:16:33] reason why
[1:16:34] we have all the up and down all the time
[1:16:39] we cry unto god lord allows you
[1:16:43] lord help me and lord say take up your
[1:16:47] cross come
[1:16:48] and follow me but when you look
[1:16:52] the cost of the cross
[1:16:57] you are discouraged but still you come
[1:17:02] lord help me how can he help you
[1:17:06] when he already told you what to do
[1:17:12] you say god
[1:17:16] is a merciful god
[1:17:19] look he knew what cain was
[1:17:23] but still he spoke to cain
[1:17:27] he said okay if you will do it like your
[1:17:30] brother
[1:17:33] if you will do just like your brother
[1:17:36] you will be accepted
[1:17:39] what was hard for ken to look what abel
[1:17:43] did
[1:17:44] and just go do what evil did
[1:17:48] and he was going to be accepted
[1:17:52] but no he didn't want that
[1:17:56] it was too much for him then he went
[1:18:00] and did what was in his heart my brother
[1:18:03] and sister
[1:18:05] this is not the time to look around
[1:18:09] and play around this is not the time
[1:18:13] to stay oh i heard the voice
[1:18:16] that rich ruler heard the voice he spoke
[1:18:20] face to face with god came
[1:18:24] god spoke to him and you say oh no i
[1:18:28] heard the fall he said
[1:18:29] yes to him the voice of god can talk to
[1:18:31] anybody
[1:18:33] god talk to satan god can talk to
[1:18:37] who he wants to but that is not the sign
[1:18:40] that you are a son
[1:18:42] or a daughter of god
[1:18:46] we should not be bind by miracles and
[1:18:50] stuff you see jesus
[1:18:55] never said believers should follow the
[1:18:59] sign
[1:19:01] he never said that but he said
[1:19:04] this sign shall follow
[1:19:08] them that believe so if you believe
[1:19:13] it's not your problem to look for signs
[1:19:16] sun will follow you why because you are
[1:19:19] holding off the world
[1:19:21] why because the word of god is on your
[1:19:24] heart
[1:19:25] you are working according to the word
[1:19:28] hallelujah but when you see people
[1:19:31] running after signs something is wrong
[1:19:35] why because
[1:19:37] god never promised you to follow the
[1:19:39] sign
[1:19:40] but he said the sign will follow you if
[1:19:43] you can believe
[1:19:50] oh the word of god is just so
[1:19:53] simple but why
[1:19:58] why is because
[1:20:02] we don't go by his word
[1:20:06] we don't live by his word
[1:20:09] we want god to do according to our
[1:20:12] feeling
[1:20:13] according to our emotion according to
[1:20:16] our vision
[1:20:18] according to our thought according to
[1:20:20] our mind
[1:20:23] and that where the crash comes from
[1:20:26] that where there is an opposition
[1:20:29] because it will never work he is
[1:20:32] expecting you
[1:20:34] to come his provided way
[1:20:37] but you you are on your own way and you
[1:20:40] want god to come and
[1:20:42] meet you on your way
[1:20:45] oh hallelujah it will never work
[1:20:53] abraham
[1:20:57] god spoke to him when he was 75 years
[1:21:01] old
[1:21:02] he and his wife sarah her being 65
[1:21:07] was childless
[1:21:10] they didn't have any children then
[1:21:14] god told him you are going to have a
[1:21:17] child
[1:21:18] by sarah but
[1:21:21] in order to do this
[1:21:24] you've got to separate yourself
[1:21:32] god spoke to abraham abraham heard the
[1:21:35] word of god
[1:21:39] he took his way god asked him to leave
[1:21:43] him and his wife but
[1:21:46] abraham instead of doing what god told
[1:21:49] him
[1:21:51] he took his nephew a lot with him
[1:21:57] brother abram say he took also his dad
[1:22:00] his dad died then they went
[1:22:04] with lot but god gave him a promise
[1:22:08] to bless him with a child
[1:22:11] as long as abraham was with lot
[1:22:16] it was not possible
[1:22:20] for him to have a child so god was
[1:22:24] waiting
[1:22:26] looking at abraham abraham waiting for
[1:22:29] the promise
[1:22:30] and god waiting for him to be separate
[1:22:34] abraham was waiting the promise sarah
[1:22:37] was waiting waiting waiting
[1:22:40] abraham we have been waiting for a long
[1:22:42] time
[1:22:43] it seems like maybe god
[1:22:47] meant it another way you see
[1:22:51] that what is the problem
[1:22:55] when god says something
[1:22:58] don't bring your own interpretation
[1:23:02] don't try to help god god
[1:23:05] does not need your help
[1:23:09] why why is god who wants to help you how
[1:23:12] you want to help him
[1:23:14] god said sarah was not
[1:23:18] a girl oh god whatever your name was
[1:23:21] but seriously oh abraham you see
[1:23:25] sometimes you have to understand the
[1:23:28] speech of god you see you have to
[1:23:31] understand how god works sometimes
[1:23:33] i think god meant that you have to take
[1:23:38] my servant here but that was not what
[1:23:41] god said
[1:23:46] god is promises are
[1:23:49] always on condition
[1:23:53] you must absolutely
[1:23:57] no matter how fundamental you are with
[1:24:00] the promise
[1:24:02] it is under conditions
[1:24:06] always not sometimes
[1:24:10] but always
[1:24:15] we could stop here and wave through that
[1:24:19] scripture
[1:24:20] back and forth for hours
[1:24:23] see that the condition is what
[1:24:27] means something
[1:24:30] did you get that
[1:24:33] the promise is good
[1:24:37] but what means something
[1:24:41] is the condition that comes with the
[1:24:44] promise
[1:24:48] but what we where we always go wrong
[1:24:52] our eyes always set on the promise
[1:24:58] that what attract our mind
[1:25:01] is the promise because we lack promises
[1:25:05] oh he said oh god said
[1:25:09] the promise is for god
[1:25:13] the promise is for god
[1:25:17] but you you do what god told you to do
[1:25:22] for you to receive the promise
[1:25:29] if we turn this light off
[1:25:33] we know the only way to turn this light
[1:25:36] is to go
[1:25:37] wherever just turn the switch on
[1:25:40] the lights will be on right so but when
[1:25:43] we if we know
[1:25:44] the only way that this light will
[1:25:47] turn on is for us to turn the switch up
[1:25:53] if we don't do that and stay just here
[1:25:56] oh god we need the light
[1:25:59] lord we need the light it's too dark
[1:26:02] it's too dark
[1:26:04] but just go go there
[1:26:08] turn it up the light should be on
[1:26:11] we don't want to do that we want god to
[1:26:15] do everything
[1:26:17] to do to do everything but
[1:26:20] as a children of god god is
[1:26:24] training us god is training you
[1:26:29] to become one with his word
[1:26:33] god wants you to have faith in his word
[1:26:38] until you know that you know
[1:26:42] no matter the condition god
[1:26:45] is going to do what he said you see
[1:26:51] we have faith we do
[1:26:54] we all have faith and sometimes we
[1:26:58] think faith is something so supernatural
[1:27:02] and so unusual
[1:27:06] you see the first time i went to
[1:27:09] winnipeg
[1:27:09] canada i never been there before
[1:27:12] but they invited us to go for a wedding
[1:27:18] the only thing they gave us was the
[1:27:20] address
[1:27:22] that the only thing they gave us the
[1:27:24] address
[1:27:27] and then i took my gps
[1:27:30] i put up gps there on my car
[1:27:34] at 23 hours driving
[1:27:39] somewhere i've never been before
[1:27:43] me and my family
[1:27:48] we trusted that gps
[1:27:52] so much we
[1:27:55] knew that after 23 hours
[1:27:59] we will be in winnipeg canada
[1:28:02] we took the address we put it there
[1:28:06] nothing to argue with that gps
[1:28:09] that gps say stay in this road for
[1:28:13] two hours no question

[1:28:28] nothing to argue oh why i'm taking to
[1:28:29] the left

[1:28:34] take the left
[1:28:36] and it took left stay here
[1:28:39] for 150 miles i stood there
[1:28:43] no matter how many turns i saw on my way
[1:28:46] that was not my concern because my gps
[1:28:50] told me
[1:28:51] stay here for 158 miles
[1:28:55] i trust that gps so much
[1:28:59] until after 23 hours

[1:32:14] jesus said to his disciple
[1:32:20] they were so surprised when they
[1:32:25] when the next day and find the fig tree
[1:32:30] dried up
[1:32:33] jesus looked at them and said
[1:32:38] if you have a faith
[1:32:43] not just not just you will do the same
[1:32:46] thing i did
[1:32:48] not only you'll be able to dry up
[1:32:52] but you see all these big mountains
[1:32:57] if you speak to that mountain
[1:33:01] and if you don't dart in your heart
[1:33:06] brother you see every promise
[1:33:10] is always with a condition
[1:33:13] with a requirement for tonight
[1:33:16] all i want you to do is to change your
[1:33:21] way
[1:33:22] of seeing the things of god
[1:33:26] look your part do your part
[1:33:32] don't mind god with his part because him
[1:33:35] he's faithful
[1:33:37] to his own word he cannot lie
[1:33:41] he cannot change so that is a deal done
[1:33:45] now you find your your part
[1:33:50] and stay right there make sure
[1:33:54] you do exactly
[1:33:58] what he said then take his promise
[1:34:06] and see if god
[1:34:11] is not the same
[1:34:14] and see if he's not the same
[1:34:18] oh my i don't even know what time i have
[1:34:22] to finish
[1:34:23] but see
[1:34:27] i okay let's do this
[1:34:31] i will finish very quick why
[1:34:35] did you ever think why
[1:34:38] he was absolute positive
[1:34:42] and the only thing he had to do was
[1:34:44] separate himself
[1:34:46] from his people and god never did bless
[1:34:49] him
[1:34:50] until he did it
[1:34:53] he took his daddy his daddy died
[1:34:58] he took lot and when after lord
[1:35:01] separated from abraham
[1:35:04] then god come to him
[1:35:08] said now walk
[1:35:12] through the land see
[1:35:15] listen obedience one
[1:35:19] promise to and the conditions
[1:35:24] three always goes with god
[1:35:28] and his word
[1:35:32] obedience why because the bible say
[1:35:37] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:35:40] so you obey
[1:35:44] the word of god after you obey
[1:35:48] then you look the promise
[1:35:52] after that you look the conditions
[1:35:56] in which you have to be for god to
[1:35:59] fulfill that promise
[1:36:01] and when you stay there on that
[1:36:04] condition
[1:36:05] that condition is made
[1:36:09] then you see the power of god the bible
[1:36:12] said
[1:36:13] these sons shall follow them that
[1:36:15] believe
[1:36:16] if they lay hand on the sick they shall
[1:36:19] recover
[1:36:20] that is exactly right now that is under
[1:36:24] conditions
[1:36:25] if you believe it
[1:36:29] you see if you believe it
[1:36:33] oh my if you've done any sin
[1:36:37] confess it make everything right
[1:36:41] god will not heal
[1:36:44] only under conditions see
[1:36:48] so call your pastor in and if you
[1:36:52] did and if you did any wrong confess it
[1:36:56] the bible say confess your fault one to
[1:37:00] another
[1:37:01] pray one for another that you may be
[1:37:04] healed you see when you have done
[1:37:07] something wrong
[1:37:09] or you are sick
[1:37:14] start looking around your own life
[1:37:18] is it something you have done wrong
[1:37:22] search go in looking
[1:37:26] to find out what is the cause of this
[1:37:30] sickness
[1:37:31] what is the cause of this problem
[1:37:35] look around search search then when you
[1:37:38] found out
[1:37:40] you make it right and after you make it
[1:37:43] right
[1:37:44] brother call your pastor
[1:37:48] don't hide any sick sin in your life
[1:37:51] and you bring your pastor a poor man we
[1:37:53] pray
[1:37:54] pray pray pray pray nothing happened
[1:37:57] i don't think i pastor have faith
[1:38:01] i don't think our pastor god hears his
[1:38:04] prayers
[1:38:05] the problem is not your pastor your
[1:38:08] problem is you
[1:38:11] how that poor man will know what you did
[1:38:14] is between you and god you
[1:38:16] confess make it right then when that man
[1:38:19] of god comes
[1:38:21] you just take the scripture lord you
[1:38:23] said by your stride
[1:38:26] it happened oh my i'm
[1:38:30] going to close now by
[1:38:34] oh
[1:38:37] jesus
[1:38:42] what was it that very dark
[1:38:46] crucial moment come but god is always
[1:38:50] on the scene if you are sure that
[1:38:53] it is god if you repented of your sins
[1:38:57] if you've met god's requirement
[1:39:01] then be sure that god will keep
[1:39:04] his promise if men
[1:39:07] and women could only realize that
[1:39:11] god is obli uh obligated
[1:39:14] to his promise and if you've met his
[1:39:18] requirement
[1:39:19] if you confessed your sins and you've
[1:39:22] made your wrong right and you've done
[1:39:26] everything god has required
[1:39:29] then hold unto god
[1:39:36] then hold on to god
[1:39:40] you've got to see the daylight
[1:39:46] no matter the situation
[1:39:49] brother and sister god's promise is true
[1:39:54] but the problem is the way we approach
[1:39:57] him
[1:39:58] the way we approach god is not the right
[1:40:02] way
[1:40:03] let us change the way we approach him
[1:40:07] we will see the glory of god
[1:40:10] will we become a super christian
[1:40:14] we will see the glory of god
[1:40:17] because you know you walk according
[1:40:20] to his law you walk according to his
[1:40:23] promises
[1:40:25] god will never fail you god
[1:40:28] will never fail you let me read the last
[1:40:34] quote
[1:40:38] you know in the prayer line many times
[1:40:42] going through and maybe offering prayer
[1:40:45] and sometimes a a case goes deeper
[1:40:49] than that see god
[1:40:52] heals on condition and
[1:40:55] there there might be something in that
[1:40:58] person's life
[1:41:00] i don't care how much medicine the
[1:41:02] doctor would give them
[1:41:06] they will never get well until that
[1:41:09] thing
[1:41:10] is cleared up
[1:41:13] and sometimes we find people going
[1:41:16] through these prayer lines
[1:41:18] out across the nation and they just run
[1:41:22] up
[1:41:22] and think that the lord ought to heal
[1:41:25] them right then
[1:41:27] but there is something maybe down in
[1:41:30] there
[1:41:31] and we set before the lord until he
[1:41:34] reveres
[1:41:37] what that is there is a reason
[1:41:42] for everything and you've got to find
[1:41:46] the reason
[1:41:47] first and then
[1:41:50] you can find what to walk
[1:41:53] on
[1:41:59] you have been wondering many times
[1:42:03] why you cannot just live a victorious
[1:42:06] life as a christian
[1:42:09] you have been wondering why this is just
[1:42:12] not
[1:42:13] working right with me
[1:42:16] you have questions
[1:42:20] but tonight the lord is asking you to
[1:42:23] look around
[1:42:25] search around found out
[1:42:30] make it right
[1:42:33] then your problem will be solved
[1:42:41] as we bow our heads this tonight
[1:42:50] i think something has been said
[1:42:55] that will help you to see things
[1:42:58] different
[1:43:01] that will help you maybe just have a
[1:43:04] closer walk with god
[1:43:12] if you think the lord has spoke to you
[1:43:15] tonight
