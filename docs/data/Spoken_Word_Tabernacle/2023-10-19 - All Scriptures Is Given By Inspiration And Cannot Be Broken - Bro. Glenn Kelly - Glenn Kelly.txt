thank you Lord Jesus amen amen amen can you be seated tonight amen amen amen we've got um two beautiful at least two beautiful birthdays today amen and we've got two wonderful testimonies today amen so first we want to say sister Divine happy birthday to you amen amen amen and we also want to say brother Robert happy birthday to you amen and amen amen amen we've got um two testimonies tonight from sister zadi and then sister Rosemary then after that we're going to call brother Michael Mar to to um bring before the Lord our prayer request and praise report tonight amen so we invite sister zadi amen God bless you okay um I just want to say um I want to give thanks to the Lord uh for so much that he's been doing um in my life uh but this specific testimony goes along with the testimony that I gave um roughly a month ago or or so um the job that I received that I told you guys about um you know I really believe that was the hand of the Lord providing at the perfect time and you know finances everybody knows how that goes and you know things were getting rough and the Lord just supernaturally provided that job but there was a lot of things that happen with the time that I um have been working there so I just completed my training yesterday uh it was six weeks of uh pure material um I felt like I was in college course at a AP class in college a lot of it was a lot of information to take in you know a lot of tests and quizzes and things that God gave me the strength and Grace to make it through um but the most significant part is this so I have to smile real hard because I said there's no way I could get this testimony because it had nothing to do with me so um of course there's going to be a test for any you know moving up to the next level of any job so there was a 100 question test that was supposed to be taken and then there was also a role play test and then there was um uh something called a nap class which basically was um a face to-face training with a group right so the first the the the nap class was supposed to be my second week of training um and somehow I kind of got out of it by things didn't seem you know correct to me of how I had to kind of put out money to to go to this training usually a job will pay for training so I told my manager I said I don't feel like that's appropriate for me to do especially me coming to a job I think they should be compensating me for the time and you know traveling things like that um and so they you know told me I didn't have to go that and I could go to the next class so the next class came around and when the next class came um I got no notifications about about the class coming up and it was actually in Atlanta the first one was in Raleigh and I would have to travel using my car my gas my time and so um with that uh what happened is when we when I went I actually went to a location um to where the training was originally supposed to be and what they would do at the last minute they would change it to um to wherever the most new hires were so when I went to the training I was the first one there at nine o'clock in the morning training was supposed to be at 10: I sat there for 45 minutes and I found out that uh that basically um to make a long story short that they exempt me from the class so that's the first one the second one is that that they um we the written exam I was supposed to take it on Monday to be able to close out my training so we're waiting for the test to show up on Friday my manager tells I'm sorry Thursday she tells me to kind of you know contact the it to get you know get everything going so we think we solve it on Monday comes we're looking for the test we can't find the exam because they switched over to a new system so you know how the Bible says first shall be last and the last shall be first I was the last one in the group but basically I was the first one to get out to get straight to to to training while everybody else was being trained so um basically I didn't have to take the 100 question exam I got exempt from that so I want to praise the Lord for that and then lastly I'm supposed to do the role play test which is basically doing a Act of what you're supposed to do when you're selling and um it was supposed to be yesterday and I got Exempted from it yesterday so then I get to my new location today ready got approved for commission um which wasn't supposed to happen it that also was so it's four parts and when I got there today uh the big guy the manager came and did the role play and that one I thought I was exempt from so I was going to give a testimony that was from three tests but that one I had to do but I missed it by one point and he pushed me through so I just want to give glory to God for making a way all the way through that because I know it had nothing to do with me and so I'm so excited and I just pray that I'll be a light in that in that um that job and I'm just appreciative of everything he's doing so I want to give amen and amen amen we're going to invite sister Rosemary amen amen then after that brother Michael will bring before the Lord our prayer request and praise report and then we have one special tonight amen God bless you Saints I um I guess today was a educational testimonies so so I I had asked foray my husband prayers for me to go do a test and uh this was a a specialty certification test and where I'm working took me five years to decide that I was going to take it and so uh two months ago two people younger than me failed the exam two weeks before I did mine somebody else did it and failed so when I heard that I said Lord it's in your hands I'm going to do my part like you expect me to do and I would I'm expecting you to do your part amen so going to the uh it's a three hour exam and I'm a slow reader just you know being brought up from home we we not trained to read as fast as the people here so I read slowly so I knew I had to really do something for me to finish all the exams the the tests I mean the questions so I'm doing the questions and I'm like Lord you have to take this will because what I read is not what I'm seeing and and so I go on and I look up there's a you know a signal and I look up and I see like you have 30 minutes and I still have 40 questions to go I did not the Lord just held me I didn't panic I just say lord it's in your hands for your own glory and to make a difference that I'm your child and I'm believing in you you just have to take control all of this so I continued on I finished with 1 minute and 30 seconds left so but because of the way the questions were abroad even something that you know it's twisted to a point where you just feel like I'm not sure anymore so I said well it's I I leave it to you so I go out and I thought honestly to God I thought I had failed that exam I mean honestly it was I felt like I passed because the Lord just changed my answers and and that's what I believe and that's why I'm giving him all the glory so I I get out of the building and immediately I step outside like just step out of the building and I get my phone you know um shows a signal that I have an email and when I look it's from them I'm like wow they couldn't even let me get into my car before they tell me I failed but something something told me look again so as I'm taking the step The Next Step I look again it's like [Applause] congratulations I left there shouting with my hands in the air I went to the parking lot where my car was I knelt down in the parking lot Just Praise the Lord and please praise the Lord with me amen and amen amen amen amen amen but Michael M amen we want to thank the Lord for our testimonies and bring before the Lord I I believe some of us are still taking test and examinations and applying to jobs and all those things and the Lord is surely going to answer our prayer amen amen praise the lord we are so happy to be in the house of the Lord um we want to

to uh second Thessalonians this little gadet up here tonight so y'all pray for me huh amen we going to look at uh these glasses out here we let the Lord have his way we read this text here and he'll come and have his way okay we got uh Second Timothy 3 and let's look at verse 16 once you have it say Amen see page is still turning we l on you we second Timothy 3:16 Hallelujah it says all scriptures see not some all scriptures is written by the inspiration huh of who of God is that right so now we by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine that's right for reproof that's right for correction that's right for instructions in righteousness now look what it'll do if you follow this now that man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto what all good works may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and then we're going to go to um let's go to Romans 10 we'll read this scripture here Romans 10 and then we'll elaborate on some things and see which way the Lord want wants to go here on tonight because we're looking Saints in this hour here now is it's getting close going home time is that right so let's look at uh verse 17 once you have it say Amen Romans 10:17 it says so then Faith cometh by what hearing hearing the what the word by the word of God now may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word see it says faith come by hearing amen hearing the what the word of God okay so faith we talking about inspiration so Faith actually comes from hearing from God is that right it's not just them because the intellectual man can read the word is that right they can read the word but the scripture says now I'm telling you I got the inspiration from when the little girl was over there right right with naming is that right when a little girl there and that quote that when brother brandom said what she did she caught the atmosphere is that right in the inspiration when you're under the inspiration in your position where you're supposed to be at the right time you'll catch the unction you'll catch the anointing you'll catch what the holy spirit is actually saying to you you huh we're talking about on tonight our topic is all scriptures is given by inspiration and cannot be broken if God said it it will come to pass is that right so we have to understand that each time that's why all the promises is yay to the bride is is that right because the promises of God what he promised you is your inspiration because God said it to you is going to happen in God's time is that right amen oh Satan you in trouble you're running up against the wrong child of God now you coming up against the Bride of Jesus Christ amen religion versus salvation religion versus salvation he's got Christ on the scene huh we got the inspiration amen come on Saints you know you got to understand you can be anointed you can be there uh what God called you to do but you could be out of position and when you get out of the position huh things won't happen won't happen the way God planned it to happen remember David wasn't David the king then David want to build God a a house for the ark he said that oh Lord you dwelling in tents uh but why can't we build you a house and David went on right he was inspired he was under the inspiration but he was not in his office is that right na was in the land at the time he was supposed to consult Nathan is that right we got the scriptures the enemy says back to the Bible we never left the Bible because the scripture says uh you wor seek the prophet is that right for your day uh especially on what what the hidden things are the hidden things only had to be revealed to to a prophet oh Hallelujah have your way Lord all scriptures that are INSP they are inspired by God is that right God said he do nothing unless he reveal it first to his servant the prophet is that right so remember you can be anointed and out of your position and but if you out of your position now you got to understand right you got some when you get out of that position then the devil I'mma get back to the scriptures we just throwing it out right now so the devil he'll come to you and when he'll come to you the one that know that he knows who God is dealing with so what he's trying to do is get you out of your position that's right so we can get you then he can confuse you is that right then he wants you to reason with them is that right but we're all part of this body no big eyes no little yous is that right see I can't take the pastor's spot and the pastor can't take my spot I'm looking for some of these young men to rise up is that right rise up so the Lord can use you God is in the camp you are not going to fail is that right God has given us a promise in these last days let me look let us look at this here by the grace of God sir look at that scripture here we'll go back to it second Timothy 3 he said look what he says and you got four things here he said the lord well thank you Jesus he said all scriptures given in Inspiration by inspiration of God yes sir she's profitable okay I'm not going to go in there we just just going to work with um inspiration by the grace of God that scripture is loaded in there maybe one of these ministers or somebody in here to picked it up right I'm just up here I'm not much of a Preacher I'm just a spirit tire on the night is that right huh look at what we said here but the spirit TI can get anointed and carry you where he need to go let's see what he say now he say look he said is is for what profitable that mean if you accept the word you accept the scripture you will always be at an advantage and not a disadvantage somewhere you rejecting the word huh there's no way we should be lacking anything in this hour here now ah he said now look he tell us now imp impr profitable For What doctrine is that right he's G given you the doctrine he said I will bring you in this age only the former rain and the latter rain is that right we will have the teaching rign that it has to come to do what to resurrect as the Holy Spirit showed us on the board down in the ground is the seede is that right that seed is hidden so now you got to come with the teaching rain and then you have what the ministers that come through is to pick up what the teacher done laid down for the people is that right because it's two different anointings on there is that right when the spirit of the Lord come is that right let me keep going so we come there and as prophit for reproof offer also if you take the inspired word said then it will bring you to a proof you will be able to stand withand any test or anything that comes up against you is that right it's for correction that he's brought in his hour here now but what we want to look at is here the inspiration inspiration that's a Divine influence because the scripture says it's from God so when you come here guess yall get a little overtime I didn't start my timer yet huh hallelujah thank you Lord he said now we're going to look at down the way but it's different Inspirations is that right so you can once you get in your position I'm trying to interpret I'm trying to move slow he's trying if you get in your position then God can use you what he actually called you to do but so we let's look at job here he looked at job was a prophet in the land is that right you know Satan's are kind of stupid you know because you get around in there you know wherever evil is good wherever uh uh good is Evil's always present so you know you have to understand huh he only could attack his wife his flesh right but he came up to God and God had already identified to him about job is that right he was a perfect and a upright man is that right it was no man like him on the earth so Satan God knew what he put inside of Satan I mean in job is that right he know you are the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right is no one else on the earth like you does thou believe it does thou believe it come on we got to come on up here though huh the Lord said what it's time to turn the corner guys is that right we got to turn this corner now it's time to move forward God got great precious promises is that right he said bless the Lord uh oh my soul and all that is is within me he said bless his what hly name why because in that name is salvation in that name is healing in that name is Deliverance in that name is comfort in that name is welfare in that name in the name of Jesus he said bless that holy name because he's our savior that's right bless the Holy Name he's your

said now look he said we're going to look at oh let's look at a few that was inspired look at Jonah I know the interpret down there I'm trying to slow down brother Mickey he get around in there look at the inter he get around there right look at Jonah Jonah right Jonah in his time uh he had a message Jonah had to go cry out is that right but Jonah couldn't move until he fully got in his position and God did what God had to anoint him Inspire him to do what to go on the mission that he was sent to do is that right so once he got in his position and he was inspired Jonah went all up and down the street preaching the gospel telling him that you need to repent is that right if you don't repent destruction is going to come upon you now the Bride of Jesus Christ we desire for no souls to be lost is that right we got to understand that God is anointing us now to warn the people warn them that destruction is soon to come you let your bride what we're sighing and crying for the condition of the land we don't believe anything we know it's coming prophecies done told us the prophet of God done preach the message is all over Saints that's why he says the Judgment seal was the six seal is that right now he's Gathering up Saints he's Gathering us up here in this seven seal is that right so we can move get ready to get up out of here he's bringing us in quietly feeding his bride uh he's feeding his bride uh getting that bride ready to meet him in the air let me keep going help me Lord he said look God will keep unfolding he said why he told Peter what he gave him the keys is that right hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah pray for us he said look I ain't claiming nothing pray for us he said look here God the eny man going to take care of it anoint him Lord God is that right huh he thought he was going to get me here tonight but God God is worthy when the enemy come in like a flood he promised to lift in a mighty standard against it is that right trying to afflict this flesh is that right but got I could bring this flesh under subjection if I want to praise the Lord I can praise the Lord I want to dance I can dance God has giv me the authority when he's giving you the Commandment to bind everything on Earth but he will bind in heaven he give us the authority to lose things on earth he will loose the things in [Applause] heaven it's our god he's a mighty God have your way Lord look what he told us he said now we're talking about Abraham let's look at Abraham here Genesis Abraham God promised something to Abraham the Lord was sharing that with us right out of Genesis 16 then he went to Genesis 21 and when he said he going to promis he was going to have a child is that right when he promised he was going to have a child and he was going to have that child there and Abraham when he got over when he got there and it was time to we do a sacrifice a sacrifice Isaac is that right when he was there about to sacrifice Isaac then what he did it was an inspiration that came on Abraham is that right when the inspiration came to Abraham Abraham said y'all wait here the lad and I shall what shall return is that right is the inspiration of God Came Upon Abraham and Abraham did what spoke it is that right Hallelujah let's give him a clap off help me Lord hallelujah he came amen let me look at these here help me Lord help me Hallelujah some of these Inspirations let's look here by the grace of God I tell you what we had here help us Lord thank you Lord we look at here let's look at Simeon we know that Simeon right he had a promise he had was revealed to him to God by God and that what he was not going to die die until he saw what saw the Christ is that right he was looking for a confirmation he wanted the Comfort he want to make sure that Israel would be all right is that right once he came in in he know Israel to be all right uh so God promised him by the what by the Holy Ghost it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost Saints you got to understand when something is revealed to you by the Holy Ghost uh you can hold on to it you can hold and beted it it's going to come to pass uh in that time uh you know your heart is clear you know you got confidence with God is that right come on Saints you can hold on to that promise of God he God said it God told Simeon he didn't have to worry about anything why he probably thought Simeon was crazy he thought he was old man and he was getting old there but he had a promise he had a promise from God is that right and the promise that he had from God that he was not going die until he saw the consolation is that right what are you waiting on Saints uh whatever you promise uh if it's your father if it's your mother if it's your sister if it's your brother if you hold him up under the altar you held them up under the blood uh you don't have to worry about if it's your son uh if it's your daughter uh you just keep claiming it Saints uh it's going to happen is that right you know last time we is all under inspiration is that right if God said it I believe it you stand on it it's going to come to pass Saints but you got to understand though God told him he made a promise and the promise that he made to Abraham what did he say uh Abraham knew is that right that he couldn't he couldn't persecute Isaac is that right he could not persecute Isaac because uh God made a promise to him in Genesis 21 is that right you should have a seed uh you had to bring a seed forth uh what he say Pastor he had to pick it up is that right then he looked at uh he said father I see the wood uh and I see that sacrifice but where is that sacrifice is that right uh what did the Holy Spirit tell us Abraham he spoke at he said the lamb and I I mean Isaac and I are going to do what Worship the Lord uh now he knew the order of God is that right so it had to be a sacrifice Saints it had to be a sacrifice so Isaac knew where is the sacrifice is that right so he said in his our here now he says God himself will do what provide what the sacrifice is that right come on Saints uh Abraham knew his position with God uh he was able to put God on the spot uh he was able to bring God down uh you tell him father my mother need to be saved uh my father need to be saved uh my sister need to be saved uh my son need to be saved uh my daughter need to be saved uh father I've been obedient to your word uh father I'm looking for you to bring it to pass have your way Lord uh Abraham brought God down uh and became a sacrifice Hallelujah hallelujah look what he says we know in this hour it's real saints this word that is come why because God said in Leo the SE a church age he said I would do what I he was going to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children is that right he had to come so that he could do what open those seals and once those open those seals what it had to come to reveal what those Thunders that was hidden in those seals is that right so we had to know that is what's going to give us the rapturing faith that we need to get out of here because it was a hidden Mystery is that right a mystery is a hidden scriptural Truth uh that God didn't hide from us God hid it for us uh you're in the right place right now now he's getting us ready Saints uh just hold your loved ones up in prayer God was able to perform the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but he grew strong in faith right holding on to the promises of God he was inspired right by the promises of God he was under the inspiration of God uh Hallelujah help me Lord look what we got help me Lord he said look we come down here now we go down there look at Michelangelo we talked about him right we got over there Michelangelo when the fellow got there and he had a sculpture come on now when he got it a sculpture and in that sculpture we know what brother brandham said he put his heart he put his mind he put his soul in it but you know uh where there's no vision the people what will perish is that right but we got a vision what is a vision a vision is a revelation where the revelation of the word is uh God promis to take you out of here and get you ready right by the revealing of the word uh so he turned around and he said Peter who do men say that I am under the inspiration of God uh who do men say that I am uh them say you Elijah some say you John the Baptist some say you one of the prophets but one thing they know is that right God says surely I will do nothing unless I first reveal it to my servant the prophet so he said who do men say that I am he said thou he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God uh he said Peter Peter spoke it under their inspiration like that little girl uh caught the atmosphere uh she caught the mind of God uh he Peter caught the mind of God uh he said Upon This Rock uh I'll build my church uh and the Gates of Hell shall not PR riled against it he said Peter is that right Flesh and Blood uh this was not revealed to you what you're getting what the pastor's ministering flesh and blood cannot reveal it unto you is that right it was revealed from my Father which is in heaven he said Peter because you got the Revelation he said Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church uh and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it Peter I'll give you the keys to to the heaven he said the keys of heaven is what un two grants for one the baptism lead them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh he said what you binding on Earth what you binding in heaven what you loose on Earth what you loose in heaven hallelujah what did he say huh what about that sopan woman what about that ill Fame woman what about the illame woman the ill Fame woman that caught it right she caught her uh uh going to the well to get some water remember ill Fame woman she couldn't go to the well with the other women is that right she had been married five times and the sixth one that she had wasn't hers uh but at that time uh Jesus said I do nothing unless the father first show it to me Jesus moved under inspiration also is that right he went there to that well is that right but in this time here what the God gave us a little more understanding in that scripture there uh what did she do when she went to the well uh Jesus knew the men was hungry he knew that they needed to get some food uh he sent them on their way but the father sent Jesus by the Samarian woman is that right at that well and when she got there she said Jesus she looked he said woman give me a drink of water she knew the law she knew it that she was Ill Fame and she know she was Samaritan and she was not supposed to be communicating with that Jew so she recognized first of all what the Holy Spirit tell us brother Robert first thing he say she met him as a Jew is that right Hallelujah huh we got the legalistic in here we got the cabalistic in here they got to get moved out is that right this message is not dos and don'ts uh huh this message is by Grace uh it's the grace of God uh that he sent us to is that right Jesus Christ uh he's a gentleman is that right he's a gentleman is that right I look at this fell they got around there on that on that uh bluet tube out there whatever his name is I don't know Jennings his name is he remind me some old preacher out there he done stole his message he know he got this message he done study this message he get in but if you listen to him it's the wrong anointing it's the wrong anointing you can't beat on the people like that God's not pleasing with that th we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places so we come recognizing we're fighting against a organized Army is that right but we got the answer for Satan don't we is that right if what we bind on Heaven bur on Earth God is matching us is that right we got all Heaven back in us but now she didn't stop there is that right she didn't stop there she wasn't just the daughter of the Prophet she kept going she said Jesus what did Jesus tell her now now he was the Christ he wasn't the Christ yet no he came there he said we know you telling me these things uh how many husbands that I have uh she said that you know that we haven't seen this in over what 400 years is that right now she saw him as a what a prophet is that right after she saw him as a prophet but she recognized here some people came into the message all they seen was the prophet all they doing is quoting the prophet but they trying to mix Pentecostal anointing huh with the word of God in this hour it will not work you have to have the second oil you got to bring the second oil now that's what he said everybody was sleeping in Slumber but God broke those seals brought those Thunders is that right that's why he told us why because when they had to go around Jericho and they went around the walls of Jericho is that right it said six times first day one time next day one time then they came what then it was the sixth day right but he said now you got to go one more time right but on the last time do what they got to shout right but he did what if you go there brother brandham said he never told him but he told he didn't tell Joshua how to do it he had to be under inspiration he then he told Joshua what he was supposed to do because Joshua was the prophet he was the man that was going to lead him is that right we got the Joshua now Jehovah savior here in our presence in this time uh so what he did 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 on the seventh time he said then what when the what kind of horn the Ram's Horn not any kind of horn the Rams Horn the Rams Horn represents the Messiah why the Messiah they had the word of the hour it was the seventh church he come around there the seventh angel messenger is the only one that had it he had to go around and fill the gaps in and once he filled the Gap we the only ones could shout and tear down Satan's King [Applause] don't have time to fuss get in your position get in your position so God can use you so he can use you when that anointing comes he come around in there what did he do only the seven after the seventh Church age then he come down open those Seven Seals God name you got to go in there that's another lesson you I want to trying to do better by staying on my point inspiration under the inspiration of God uh then the woman that was there uh at the well is that right she ran by she caught him by what inspiration then as he came there and then the woman she recognized it wasn't going to just stop at what brother brandham said is that right brother brandham now he brother Brandon was the wave sheet he was the wave sheet that God sent us he was an example to what he's going to use us for is that right he showed us sisters is that right he can use the children he can use the little sisters he can use you God has chosen all of us for a purpose is that right you got to understand uh what God called you for get before the Lord lay before the Lord and see what called you for he called you to use you Saints then after she recognized when he told her these things she said wait a minute she said thou are the what the Christ the son of the Living God uh he did what dropped her word aart instead of that right and ran on she went to testify yeah but in our time in this age here now this seventh Church age not just the seventh Church age this is the bride age we are in the bride age we're W above that when it went down in there this generation we were looking for it brother brandom said what do we in we're in a solom condition is that right we're in the jams and Janine condition is that right that two-headed Mountain St is that right he had a two-headed God is that right we got to that go there we in the uh uh James and jarine a condition but he also said the bride recognize we're in the son of man son of man condition also the son of man had to come uh and he had to perform a sign uh and the son of man came to perform a sign uh and when the son of man came uh the Gentiles was looking for that sign that bride he was looking they were looking for that sign uh that they had never seen before uh that sign uh that he promised in Abraham in up in Genesis 17 when he came to the tent of Abraham is that right inspiration MDC caring the body is that right he had to use that body down in our time Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 he promised to use that body one more time uh he told him not to drink uh not to smoke that to defile your body ever again is that right he was going to use that body he showed us the discernment is that right the discernment that was going to come he was able to do what tell you with his back turned ah there's a man uh sitting on the third row uh I believe you're coming your name is Greg uh and your wife name is Miss Cindy is that right Hallelujah the dynamite strikes down in the soul it's an explosion this is he is what we've been waiting on this is the Messiah this is the wave sheep this is he uh Christ uh back on the scene again uh we on our way out of here uh this is the son of man Ministry uh the Son of God is going this is a son of man Ministry is back here on the Earth again look what he say this thing is real saints is real real is can be God come bringing us a word that's why they sing that song put it up under your feet whatever you struggling with you know what you struggling with put it up under your feet is that right because the Lord given us a promise in this hour here now I'm the Lord thy God put no other God before me I'm a jealous God he said I come I'm going to return to get you one day he said Remember the young lady they get around in there then they want to get mad then it just show you what inside of you then you want to get upset uh because you get out there and you get among the heathens and when you get among the heathens God already told you that you're going to receive persecution is that right he said you're going to receive persecution and when you get out there and among them remember shra mesach and abot and they told them shra mesach and abot what was the first thing they did is that right they told him they they wanted them to bow down to what to that Idol but what else was in there over there in Daniel he got over there told them when they start playing that music is that right they want to get out there among the heathens and then you think we going to back up we ain't going to back up the Holy Ghost is in here the Holy Ghost sent us in here you can try to bring what you want to bring in I read the the scripture if a man leave that mean you was not of us from the beginning is that right come on Saints I'm I'm not backing down anything you're not on the hot seat I'm on the hot

there now let me tell you one of the good ones that we had in there we got around in there we had one fell he used to walk past the the bible study this is in a Cell Block too now and he go in there and he was there he was just walk by all the time because he getting a mentally insane mix with him now he just kept walking H look kind of rough looking just talking to himself one day he came in the Bible study and he came in there and he sat down just sitting there like he told I know the demon was messing with his mind I know where it was I again came back next week we work with a little lesson three stages of Grace y'all don't realize how blessed you are you have a time getting past the correct baptism with them them religious demons is rough they got a lock on them like that tradition tradition is a terrible demon and when he come in there then uh he got there and he then we was working with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he sat there the whole time now let me tell you how God does things I said nothing I never even got to the Token anything like that I said here's justification sanctification set aside for clean said baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I want that token yes [Applause] sir I thought the man couldn't [Applause] talk I'm telling you what God is doing see Eagles don't fly in bunches you don't know what he's going to send where he's going to send you at what he's going to do but they treated with respect and he prayed with him and I'm believing I'mma see him on the other side I believe that God rich in Mercy under the inspiration in God's presence is that right that's why the holy spirit said you have the grain of the faith of a mustard seed is that right when that grain grow up it's going to gray up into a big tree is that right what's that tree is a tree of what tree of life that's why he told us in this hour brother Brandon showed him what did he say Pastor he said I preach what Paul preached until what until what after the Seven Seals uh and after the Seven Seals what did he do then now he gave us an example about doing what creating What squirrels uh asking for those things speaking those things uh he said the works that I do but we should do a what a greater work is that right what is that greatest work that greater work is we going to be able to speak things into existence that's why he says after he got past Paul and he brought it up to this time now brother brandham has mooved into the Covenant Angel Ministry is that right he had to give us an example of what we going to do Saints that's why it's no longer playing church we have to turn the corner it's time to get out of here soon and very soon we are going to do a see the king I can't get through all of this Saints let's stand on let's stand Hallelujah inspir ation the inspiration of God he just took it all another way Saints he took it another way but that's okay I know the Lord did what he was going to do I didn't want to the Lord really gave me strength CU I'm not here to glorify the devil that's why he said bless the Lord all I in soul and all that is within me bless His holy name he is is our King of Kings he is our Lord of lords he is that Prince of Peace he is the almighty God uh we're moving into something brother Robert we're moving into it brother we're moving into it fast too Saints because the squee got to come that's why the Holy Spirit has what the pastor given us I tell you it's just so much it's just loaded I didn't even get on to the the other things that the Lord had been ministering there inspiration that's where I got it from from that little girl and when that little girl uh caught that inspiration she caught the mind of God uh what the pastor is doing he's under the anointing he's catching the mind of God I as you say I'll take a page from his book brother brother Steve I'll load it with c's hair didn't even get I didn't even touch the iceberg didn't touch the tip of the iceberg it's loaded you need to go in there and see with that inspiration when you're under the inspiration of God uh what the Lord when you're in his presence all that is in you you Saints uh all those things that is bringing us we're our origin is from heaven we come from heaven and we're going back to Heaven God is doing some miraculous things don't be afraid to ask God for the abundantly Don't Be Afraid don't limit those things Saints uh you know if your motive and objective is right is to glorify God uh if you come here to praise God uh if you don't have a selfish motive and you know deep down inside uh what God has called you to do uh you will be anointed he'll be anointed there you'll be anointed whatever he called you to do you'll catch the unction and when the unction grab a hold of you Saints uh that mean the Holy Spirit comes down he backs what God is bringing forth on that time uh he's backing what we had a man coming here Sunday he came down in there Sunday I want share the testimony he came down in there Sunday he came all the way from Colombia he said it remind me of the queen of the South he said I heard about the wisdom that was being brought forth up in here he said I came down I said brother how you doing he said fine uh he said brother I that anointing I haven't been in an anointing like that in a long time uh in the presence he testified they're looking he says uh brother I've been streaming all the time he said but I got to come I had to come and be in that presence Saints I'm telling you you stay prayed up uh pray for the pastor pray for the ministry pray for the musicians pray for the technicians because he's coming at you again uh Satan goes about like a roaring lion but you have to but you have to understand he said put on what the whole armor of God uh so that we may be able to withstand what the Ws of the devil so you're getting the word uh the former rain and the latter rain uh but what you have to really protect now is your character is that right that's what you want to protect uh that's the honor of God that's the supernatural Armor of God uh as the Holy Spirit told us uh they could prophesize uh they could do Miracles but they cannot what

that's why we can believe the word of God am because heaven and earth will pass away but never his word because his word will never be broken amen church we have turned the cor the time is very treacherous and whatever I have taught here because I don't teach my thought I usually bring you scripture and bring you quot to show you what the prophet says and what the Bible says if there is any interpretation in the scripture I have to wait for Malachi 4 to give me the tools to put into the Bible and unlock the the Bible and I know that I'm venturing with the authority of a Vindicated Prophet amen when he says that a woman in the Bible means the church then every time I see a woman I just unlock church and I keep moving because that's the authorized spoke man word of God himself th have been said I will never back up one in in anything amen if something is laid out here is presented I would never back up one in from it because I'm under commission I have to deliver what he tght me and I have to stay with what he Tau me regardless if it's going to cost me your friendship so be it if it if if it's going to cost me a popularity so be it whatever is going to cost me so be it amen I don't want to face him with anybody's blood in my hand amen if you never been taught before I will show Grace and I will say they don't know I need to bring it and show you this is what the word say and then we move on even if you make a mistake I will still show Grace but I have to stay with the word because I don't want anyone to call me deceiver in a hospital bed no one will do that so I'm on the commission I can back up especially if I see it in the message and in the word of God that say don't even negotiate with me I will not take it amen I will stay with it if you ask me a question I give you what brother brandham say what does it mean it means what brother Bram say what does it mean it means what the scripture says and that's what I Su stand amen so learn to take our personal stuff away and I understand that this is Brother Steven we can smile but at a certain time I have to straighten the word I have to go straight with the word and period I'm not going to change it's not anything personal I'm not fighting against you I'm fighting against a demon that is trying to destroy you amen I have people that I know that are in very serious condition Now situation now they don't even know how to to come out it will only take God all of that because they didn't hear when we told them and sometime when they tell you something you might not see the result in two month in one year in two years it looks like everything is working fine because you move on your own way but after 3 years whatever you going to reap there I will be the one suffering instead of staying with my wife I have to be there in the corner she knows praying at night 2:00 because you didn't listen to what I told you and now I'm staying up till 2:00 a.m. in the morning pleading with the Lord to make you understand or to open your eyes so you can see what I'm saying that's why every day after I finish preaching I tell you I love you love is corrective I love you but I won't back up I won't back up to the word I have to stay with what the prophet say Amen continue to meditate continue to consecrate continue to pray continue to pray for the question and answer on on Saturday and pray for the service because the Lord is bringing us higher with whatever is happening in the church now if people don't wake up I don't know again what can wake you up I don't know if you saw the video people
