TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now 2020 20 it's three almost two years now so yeah 2020 I guess it was yeah and so the first day they tested my my blood vessels had all collapsed they tried to get blood and the only finally the only places they could get blood for testing was in my groins it was so painful and they did everything and finally the first day they said uh uh the blood coagulation rate was so bad if they did it I could die so first day they didn't do it second day know that they know fourth day it got so bad until I was I could see that I was almost gone so I told them I said they should act by faith just go in there and I believe God will use their knowledge to help me out of the situation you know sometimes we get to feel that uh the doctors you know not needed I I put out this coat by the prophet and then he says that God heals in many ways a doctor asked me not long ago and said what is your opinion of medicine brother Branham I said well God is the only one that can heal say I said the Bible don't lie and the Bible said I'm the Lord that heals all your diseases and I said the Bible can't lie I said God heals by medicine God heals by love God heals by understanding God heals by care God heals my prayer and God heals my miracles the whole thing God heals that's all all there is to it he is the Healer the only healer we haven't got medicine that can create or create a cell in your hand to heal or create in your body to heal we can move a tooth we can cut out appendix or take out a gallbladder but who heals God no medicine will build tissue only God life builds tissue God is the only healer and he says we're talking on that and then in a message he cares do you care he says I hope that each one of you get that especially you people that is to be prayed for that's so uncomfortable this day with maybe troubles that the doctors cannot touch we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals by understanding God heals by love just a little love goes a long way Amen Let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them see God heals by love God heals my prayer God heals by Miracles God heals by his word he sent forth his word and healed them amen God heals whatever Source it is God heals by it God heals by proper dieting yes sir yeah it's God that heals for he said I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases so all of him should work together a man in different Ministries should work together for that see now but they don't do it because sometimes they are forbidden to take certain stance upon God's word because there are certain denominations doesn't permit them to do that but that doesn't stop the truth just the same Gods God goes on healing just the same so after struggling the head of the Cardiology Department he came over and I I said just take me in there by faith and I know my God will be there to take over so why did he took my advice they took me over and they did their surgery they had they they were looking for uh a vein to use as uh I've forgotten where they use the terminology but they found one somewhere here and they had this central line or whatever they call it where they pass all the medication and water and whatever they wanted to do so then they drilled what do you call bear hole they drilled Bear b-u-r-r right here one here one day and I tell you what the the pressure that had built up in the head let off you know Brown said letting off the pressure so push shh about 600 Mills of blood came from this side and that side and then they put catheter through and and then I had to lay on my back for the remainder of the blood to come out of my head and everything I saw every light I saw was rainbow everywhere just rainbow rainbow and I remembered a brother in the message was dying and he told Brother promise ramp all of USA is a covenant Covenant Jehovah I'm the Lord that he left thee Hallelujah and by the grace of God I put through they were expecting that I will lose their use of my limbs and I couldn't move my hands and I couldn't do this and that but here I stand a testimony of the power of the Living God [Applause] believe us all over the places we're praying you can't tell me that my God Is Not A Healer I have tasted and tested and tried and I know that my God lives Hallelujah amen God's Not Dead he is alive my God's Not Dead he is alive my God's Not Dead he is a lot I feel him in my heart I feel him in my head I feel him in my feet feeling all over me oh yeah God's Not Dead he's alive my God's Not Dead he is alive God's Not Dead he's alive I feel him in my heart feel him in my I feel him in my feet amen [Music] amen that's the grace and mercy of God to me amen so to whom shall we go they say through this away so fine before I do so let me know the substitute [Applause] if you can give me the substitute I will examine it and compare it and see if it's anywhere near this one [Applause] can you imagine people who have never had one dream that came to pass judging a prophet like this not even one dream that came to pass [Applause] oh my goodness you know Paul was Paul had a Cod Corinthians the Corinthians so there are all kinds of questions and they wanted to question you about glossoloria speaking in tongues in First Corinthians 14 he said I speak in tongues more than you are but in the church I would rather speak ten words that can be understood than ten thousand words that cannot be understood so what do I get from that before you could correct people he had to have what they had and even more so before you can correct William Branham you have to have what he had more than he had [Applause] then you'll be in a position to correct him have you ever read from the scriptures where Paul said I don't even judge myself and no man can judge me Hallelujah but you know let's go let's what do men say that I am that's Mercy but now what do you say this is Hallelujah [Music] so you know the prophet of God made a powerful full statement he said people are not digging deep enough until they hit the rock of Revelation [Music] see you are building our Christian experience the Bible describes us as God's house you know that we are called the building of Jehovah in First Corinthians chapter 3 Paul says we are God's Building and we are God's husbandry amen and we are branches in the tree of life so you can see that if we are God's boarding then there's a foundation and if you don't build on that foundation and you put up a super structure and the storms hit the superstructure because it's got no Foundation you fall off we presumed on people so much because of maybe relationships with the Prophet this that and the other so we presume that people had revelation [Music] the days of presumptions are over now we must be certain of God we must know for sure why a Believer I believe I had believed this message and I didn't know any other person that believed it and I was a school teacher in the north the northern part of our country very close to the Sahara Desert very very dry in December now remember I was in this Christian group and everybody was telling me brother Brown is a false prophet not going to follow effort false prophet and I didn't know any other person that believed the message in my country at the time so I prayed I said Lord somehow in my heart I believe this is the truth but everybody is telling me it's not so so and unite I had a dream and I had met brother pranam and he said brother Jim for you to know my message is true it's gonna rain tonight in a very dry it's gonna rain tomorrow it was in the night and it's gonna rain tomorrow for you to know this message is true and brethren in the driest season in that part of the country without any rain clouds God began to pour down rain so before I ever met anybody Jehovah had convinced me that this is the truth I don't need anybody's opinion about it I have my personal revelation I was founded on a solid rock [Applause] and nothing can move amen hallelujah so Prophet talks about the foundation he says Jesus the reason why we have nowhere else to go is because Jesus is the right foundation First Corinthians 3 no other Foundation can any man lay apart from that which is all very late Jesus Christ is that rock Foundation and we have had a prophet to teach us and train us that it's not just Jesus but the revelation of who he is and if you have the revelation of who he is it shows that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world to be part of the revealed word of this day God chose us for the last time because he has confidence in US [Applause] you know oftentimes in a relay race you know like the Jamaicans they are noted for running real fast and they have this Usain Bolt and even time they put him for the last you know and when he grabs the Baton it goes he bolts away like thunder like lightning which is gone and so if God should Reserve you and I for this end time he has confidence in US that we will not let him down he told us before the foundation of the world to carry this baton onto the rapture hold on to the Faith of Our Fathers unto the rapture and we have found it on the right foundation if you've got a little tree that is got apple trees it will bear apples if you just put it in the right foundation if you've got a heart hungering for God and you want to see the power of God you want to feel the vibrations of his eternal life you want to see if the holy ghost is real or not just plant to a little fit in his right foundation and you'll find out something goes to work oh he will begin to draw the Waters of life and that little tree will begin to Bear blossoms and fruits it will start growing certainly why because you are planted right you've got to get started right get the right Revival get the Revival right see is it just the Miracles of the prophet in my case each time I heard this prophet he was so scriptural to me our Sherry brought Stephen on phone I had visited a place in our country along the coast the British called it the cape Coast and in the night I had had a dream and I met this brother says yeah there you are brother Jim you believe that seven Thunders are revealed and the seventh seal is open brother Branham said the seventh seal or the seven Thunders who reveal the date of the rapture Christ's new name and the believer's new name in the Lamb's Book of Life so if you claim that the seven Thunders are revealed at the seven series of pain tell me the date of the Rapture tell me Christ's new name and tell me your new name in the Lamb's Book of Life and before am I seeing Jimmy there whoa brother Jeffrey God bless you oh Hallelujah okay so you know I said before I could say the word someone behind me said ask him if he thinks brother Branham was a scriptural prophet so I asked the fella I said Do You Believe William Branham was a scriptural prophet he said yes then the person said ask him where the Bible says anybody will know the date of the rapture and then I asked you tell me where let the bible promises that anybody will know the deed of the rapture he could he answered and then he said Christ had a name that no one else knew I said the Bible said no one else and you want me to to to to to to to what contradict the word and he said the new name that is revealed to the person is so personal nobody else it's not for it's not for for for it's not a kind of a Cooperative name is for the person in other words Revelation is so personal you cannot transfer it to your children it's gonna be personal to you and your children God has got no grandchildren you've got each person has to come the same way you did so the person was quiet and I woke up I said I told my brother that was with me I said we're going to have a confrontation and I tell you A lot of people are living on here say they allow somebody's misbehavior to affect their commitment to this world of their living God if this message is true will it produce this and that character tell me which age had preferred people [Music] what was it at the age of Moses when he went to the money talk for the Ten Commandments and came back all of them were worshiping idols so will you blame me to Moses was it because Moses message was false that he could produce Idol worshipers oh let me read First Corinthians chapter 5. I am great Paul how many billion Powers the Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ a great servant of the most high God all right now Paul you have raised up a church in Corinth so let's see your performance Paul I wonder if you qualify as a prophet because if these things can happen in your church it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and set fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife huh you mean to tell me that Paul's Ministry could produce such a character so you don't judge you don't judge the message by some people's behavior and the same thing is that they keep pointing to the wrong people but the grace of God some of us have been in this message for around 50 years plus and by the grace of God you can point anything like that we are doing our best to live by the word of the Living God why don't you look at the positive and we allow the negatives oh no sir it shouldn't be sold no sir by all it all goes to show that the point of entry the foundation wasn't founded right people don't even know who a prophet is [Music] you know some men expect their wives to be angels so one lady told her husband if you want me to be an angel create a Heavenly atmosphere for me because angels live in heaven [Music] [Applause] so how many want their wives to be angels in the church then is your responsibility to create Heaven around them then there will be there will be angels for you blessed be the name of the Lord there is there is a great danger in this Bible I tell you what a great danger Jesus spoke of when the unclean spirits have left people they go into dry places searching for a new Dwelling Place but if they cannot find a new dwelling conducive place they come not alone but they get seven more wicked spirits and the last entry of that person is worse than when they began so that is about where people have come too instead of going on and digging deep enough to strike Revelation and be truly Born Again by the spirit of the Living God which is a solid foundation for a Christian experience people go on and get a religious spirit and then when they begin to hear this and begin to hear that and they begin to hear that that's the Ephesians chapter 4. if I don't quit some of you cause me to preach till our faith in the problem I'm so glad about there's a big difference when people are not receiving you feel like you are hitting the wall but here I'm not hitting the world I have a home run you know [Music] so five-fold Ministry supposed to do this Ephesians 4 from verse face um there's 10 down he that descended is the same also that has ended up far above all Heavens that he might feel all things and he gave some Apostles and some profess some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God onto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now notice so that down here that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and kerning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive see wins of doctrines will be blowing cunning craftiness I I heard somebody say brother Branham must plagiarizing a plagiarized is to take somebody's work of literature or something without due reference to the person all right let's see if Isaiah was plagiarizing in Genesis chapter 3 15 the almighty God said the woman see shall preach the head of the serpent a woman has no seed but the man has so he was speaking of the Virgin conception then Isaiah is having 40 Come Thou serve the Lord amen a virgin shall conceive so Isaiah was plagiarized I tell you what he was remember there's only one Holy Ghost [Applause] and the spirit can reveal to somebody and reveal the same thing is the Holy Spirit is the author of true revelation and no individual has Monopoly on the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] yeah when brother Branham wrote the church age book and had Dr leeville to glamorize it I said I read many books or history he did not say that everything was by revelation he said I read many books on biased people history and he made references I mentioned some names but so numerous and there is there is something in literature that is if after a certain number of years books come into public domain how many know that so amen so that's how it is praise be to God however these things will continue prophet of God in the present stage of my Ministry he was saying that when a man stands true to the word not just in one meeting but in every meeting when a man stands true to the world the time will come when they will leave him let's follow the lord Jesus while she was getting closer to the end of his Road John chapter 6 he made a statement except you eat my body and dream my blood you have no life in you and some of the mixed multitudes okay he tell us that Leviticus 17. how can Jesus say a thing like that when in the Bible does this man know his Bible this man Jesus does he really know his Bible press 10 down whatsoever man that be of the House of Israel or all of the strangers that surgeon among you that eateth any manner of blood I will even set my face against that soul that eat of blood I will carry more from among his people for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your soul so for it is the blood that makeeth and atonement for the soul therefore I said unto the children of Israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that's so jealous among you eat blood and then you come around and you tell them except you eat my body and dream my blood you have no life in you so do you think those people were fundamentally wrong when they turned away from him I said this man thinks we are vampires or candy bars they forsook him and flesh no more walked with him he was approaching Calvary and it had to be him alone if Peter had been crucified with him that day you can imagine what the Catholics would be doing I've mentioned it before one time I was flying from um from Belfast to the Irish Republic Northern Ireland and before you enter the plane they were displaying newspapers and I picked one on the front page 4.3 is it 4.3 Roman Catholics are penned their signature 4.3 million or 1.3 million I forgot it's been a long while but they are painted their signature appealing to the pope to make Mary the fourth person of the Trinity so that they get a holy quartet oh my goodness yeah that's why you get if you if you get go away from that solid scriptural Foundation if you leave the way then you open yourself up for any kind of thing so that's why the prophet said if a man leaves the word leave the man because he becomes a very dangerous person very dangerous very dangerous so the foundation must be right or you are going to face problems we may not be what we ought to be we may not be what we want to be but there's one thing we know we are not what we used to be once we found Christ we come to the solid foundation amen yes sir that Foundation is so important people maturing out of childhood when I was a child he said I spoke as a child I thought as a child that when I'm a child I put away childish things that did not mean that he stopped thinking and he did not stop speaking but he thought and spoke with maturity amen amen if you are founded on the right solid foundation nothing can shake you look at an example in Jeremiah the book of Jeremiah chapter 35. something very similar and you can read all of it but I may give the summary of it the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of yahuwah came the son of Josiah king of Judah saying go on to the house of the rich abides and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the Lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink give them wine to drink thus serve the Lord through the mouth of his Vindicated Prophet to the rich advice then I took Jesus and I are the son of Jeremiah the son of habazar and I am and his Brethren and all his sounds and the whole house of the Rachel's and I brought them into the house of the Lord into the Chamber of their sons the son of IG the Lion a man of God which was by the Chamber of the princess which was above the Chamber of Messiah the Son of Shalom The Keeper of the door and I sat before the sons of the House of the Richer by his pulse full of wine and cups and I said unto them drink you wine but they said we would drink no wine for Jonathan the summer Rich about father commanded us say he shall drink no wine neither he nor your sons forever seed no plant Vineyard nor have any but all your days he shall dwell in tense that he may live many days in the land where he be strangers thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonah dab the summary Chapel our father in all that he attract us to drink no wine all our days we are wise our sons our daughters nor to build houses for us to dwell in either of weave Vineyard norfield nor seed we have dwelled intense and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonah they have our father commanded us but it came to pass when the Phuket nature king of Babylon came up into the land that we said come let's go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Guardians for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at Jerusalem then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah saying amen thus save the Lord of hosts the god of Israel go and tell the man of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem will he now receive instruction to hearken to my West save the Lord the words of Jonah Dev the son of Richard that he commanded his sons not to dream wine are performed For unto this day they drink Nam but obey their father's Commandments notwithstanding are spoken unto you Rising early speaking by hacking on unto me I have sent us unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to sell them and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers but you have not inclined your hearing or hacking unto me because the sons of Jonah died the son of Rachel have performed the Commandment of their father which he commanded them but these people are not acting unto me therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts the god of Israel behold I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that are pronounced against them because I've spoken unto them but they have not heard I've called unto them but they have not answered and Jeremiah said unto the house of the Richer by thus save the Lord of those the god of Israel because he have obeyed the Commandment of Jonah dab your dad kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he have commanded you therefore thou saved the Lord of hosts the god of Israel to adapt summary job shall not want a man to stand before me forever now what is the Revelation in this those people had a revelation of what their father meant and they stuck with it regardless of what Jeremiah a true prophet of God could not even get them away from that Foundation they knew what they were doing they were not following any man's opinion no father mother but they were following what their dad had raised them to believe the solid foundation and they stood on it and no wind of Doctrine whether from a prophet or priest nobody can could sway them from that Foundation God wants you to get a perfect revelation of the word of God that has been sent in a day [Applause] so that remember all kinds of prophets all kinds of people Revelation 24 24 the answer is Matthew 4 4. false Christ false prophet shall rise and things are going to be intensified the pressure is going to be built up stronger ways are going to blow than have been blown and If These Wings can blow certain people deacons Justice ministers blow them off their feet what would they do when the squeeze comes down to where we are pressed down what would they do when the squeeze comes down to where we are pressed down and you stand alone no church around you you will be like Daniel and his friends in Babylon and yet they had this solid foundation so nothing could frighten them not even death threats not even the threat of Fire could swear them off their Foundation they stay true to their commitment they are the solid revelation of what they were committed unto have you come to that place where you are so settled in your heart this word is your life has this message become your life you know somebody can struggle with me and get away with this jacket but it's not my life if they try to pull my arm away I'll have to struggle with them because my life this message ought to become our life the no amount of demons from the pit of Hell can sway you away [Music] you are going to go under The Crucible of testings and trials to come from left right up and down but you've got to have a revelation that you are standing on the solid rock of revelation God has confirmed to your heart that this is my voice this is my message of life to you yes sir if it gets that far come Wind come whatever you will stay true but you cannot dwell on somebody else's testimony you have to have your own personal testimony at this point in your Christian Life we are so close to the end the prophet spoke of the King of the North watch the cane of the North watch Russia and we see it all happening every prophecy is being being fulfilled right before our eyes and the prophecies included Falling Away listen the falling away had nothing to do with denominations they were they were never they were never standing [Applause] they were never standing so they're falling away it's not about them it's about those who said they were strangled blown off their feet it's where we are and it's going to continue that's why the prophet brought us one in a million [Music] watch The Exodus the first Exodus three stages they're coming out the Wilderness and the entering in just before they entered in they hit carried the spies came back and brought a bad report if democracy worked at that time then it was turned against two they were they won the election Amen in the days of my career 400 false prophets they were in elections it's not always that the majority carries the fruit praise the Lord so here we are there we are just at the closing days of time and I just want to wind up because Reverend you have to be sure I have to be certain all these very good friends of mine here then when it comes to life friendship must stay away [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and I first believe this message my brothers and everybody stood against me they wanted to but it's my life stayed with it and now I had to bury every one of them and take care of their children I'm the only the the last one died a few days ago and uh he said uh you have changed your church and change this and change that but I will remain a Methodist forever I say well I'm sorry I'll be a Christian forever I'm not interested in denomination I thought you said you'll be a Christian forever well along the line he came around and he saw the influence and impact of the word of God he said brother I want you to baptize me stay solid stay true to the world [Applause] this is the only message designed by Jehovah to produce a bride without sport without blemish without breaking [Applause] show me any other message that's a creep to do that which so I want these people give me the substitute first and now we're examine it and compare and contrast it but they don't have no substitute and yet they reject what God has said may God be merciful oh and some of the childish things that some people can say burden of the word of the Lord by Malachi to Israel let me let me ask a question which of the books in the Bible was addressed to you and I thank you through the whole Bible away we none was addressed to us here in Gastonia so it's not even for us but thanks be to God I will read you second Timothy 3 16. oh boy second Timothy chapter 3. and verse 16. from a child that has known the holy scriptures that's 15 which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of God all scripture and is profitable for Doctrine how many of them oh profitable for Doctrine for reproof for creation for instruction in righteousness that a man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works well well if Malacca is not for us and it's for the Jews then don't take ties Malachi 3 8-12 speaks about bring you all the tithes and offering and people who have dwelled on tithes and offering now they are saying that book is not for us so we are thieves oh my goodness Brethren all these things please please please please for God's sake study this Bible everything that the prophet of God can be preached out of here if there is anything you cannot preach out of here something is wrong with your revelation don't bring your laziness to studying this Bible don't bring your laziness to prayerlessness study this word thoroughly and you find out that statements that brother Branham will make that appear as though they are not there are all day [Applause] that's why I haven't found any fault yet because if this word of God is in your heart and the prophet makes a statement he picks it up it brings her back you can say Amen oh bless that be the name of the Lord we are not following cunningly device Fables We are following the Vindicated voice of God for our day and as we get closer to the end of time we are going to appreciate this message more and more can you imagine a society little children are told not to say they are boys or girls when they grow up then they will decide goodness we are getting to a place where the people have become insane the prophet said they have become neurotics and it's going to get worse it's going to get where you have to stand alone on the revelation of God's word stand alone but God will stand with you Jesus had to stand alone the disciples got to a point they had to stand alone Paul said in a way that is called heresy so worshiped by the Lord God of my fathers this way will have to be called the same heresy Insanity We are following a man people that followed Paul I'm sure people said they were following a man people that followed Moses they were following a man study to show yourself approved a white man who needs not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth that's the only way these wings that are blowing cannot blow you off your feet if you find that this is a scriptural message then you realize that to reject it is like rejecting the Bible then in that way you know your end the Lake of Fire so these rich abides will not be swayed a young Prophet sent from Samaria First Kings chapter 13. the Lord sent him to perform science and wonders and to show his power and when he did the king straight from his hand to strike him and it's weather the prophet prayed for the king he was restored the king said come home and eat with me said thus said the Lord I'm not supposed to do that then he set forth on a different route and as he was going his sons had attended the campaign they reported to their dad and dad said where did he pass and they sorrow the ass and he followed him and he met him he said hello he said yeah you die young prophecy yes I am oh come home and eat with me you always leave your foundation it's all thus save the Lord I'm not supposed to do this listen to the enticing ways stand with me in your Bible to Second Kings chapter 13. first king is 13. foreign he said unto him Verse 18 First Kings 13 and verse 18 He said unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat and drink water but he lied unto him so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water and he came to pass as they sat at the table that The Well of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah saying thus say of the Lord for as much as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the Lord now as you have left your foundation and has not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but chemist back and has eaten bread and drawn water in the place of the which the Lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy caca shall not come unto the Sepulcher of thy fathers he came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk he settled for him he asked for the prophet whom he had brought back when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcass was cast in the way and they are stood by the lion also stood by the carcass behold Men passed by and saw the carcass casting the way the lion standing by the carcass and they came and told it in the city where the old Prophet dwelled the old Prophet went took his brother and had him buried and everything he said if I die Bury Me by him for the things that he said are true but watch out right look don't allow anybody whatever his credentials are to take you off that solid foundation it's very easy to be swayed by associations relationships and this that and yeah my problem is this I'm so sorry the Jimmy Dr James Humes and Mama and Big Brother and his wife are already here because they followed the false prophet it is if that is true then all of these parents are lost that we even know better than our own parents that raised us up and we persuaded that this word is true they encourage us to walk in the light now they will turn in their graves they will turn in their graves is Vindicated Prophet that went beyond the curtain of time and came back and told us my soul is satisfied my soul is satisfied don't open your ears to any other voice this young Prophet this young brother lost his life because he allowed I'm also a prophet an angel told me that's why Paul got his code from Galatians 1 if even an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel apart from that which I have preached let him be accursed and our Prophet said I preach what Paul preached and the whole house of Heaven said we are resting on God yes sir so if you're not satisfied with this what else do you want what else should God do that he has not done God has proven his word through this end time Prophet from Genesis to Revelation and Beyond and listen this message not only did God vindicate it through the prophet but those are sincerely believed it I'm an example I will show you a few pictures that I reserved for uh I wish I had come I had remembered it early enough so that we could see them Supernatural vindications people are I was in England and we had a convention and there was this brother Barry wire and uh bro don't Bailey late Don Bailey was baptizing and Wendy's brother was coming I wish you can see it from where you are let me stand here and see see the clouds surrounding him you can see the mirror you can look at them later but this one is so clear when the brother was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and pictures were taken look at the supernatural Shield can you see it God has Vindicated oh sorry yeah can you now see it look at look at the the picture here there was no Shield there all right okay the brother is coming to take it and you you can see the stages so this is number one and number two and number three is there a supernatural vindications of the the message continuing when they said the Lord Jesus was fake and they crucified him and his anointing Came Upon the apostles and God Vindicated the message through the apostles the Believers the critics mouths were shot this is the time for us to so live this way so believe it in our hearts that God will so anoint his bride till critics mouths to be shocked and I believe that's what God is doing and will continue to do but it will be in the minority amen the prophet of God uh this is what the church we must Target we must really really Target because I built calls on what I called her the capping of the pyramid bride the capping of the pyramid bride you see the Capstone coming on listen close now and I'm closing as we close Prophet saying at Calvary God came down and took the body of his own son in which he had lived and he ripped it apart at Calvary he was bleeding wounded and cut and the spear running there and ripped him apart and his blood gushed out and he said father into thy hands I command my spirit he bowed his head and the Earth shook the lightness flashed Thunders rolled God was writing his Everlasting Covenant the same clothes very close he took his dead body from the grave on the first day of the week and brought it up into heaven and set it there as a high priest as a memorial sitting there perfect forever and this is our part and he sent the spirit that he tore out of that body right back down to the church and that church will have to have the same spirit that was in that body or it won't dovetail with it in the resurrection those two pieces must come perfectly together and if this church isn't perfectly just exactly the same spirit that was in Christ you will never go in the rapture that's where he We Stand solid Same Spirit that was in that body that was wounded and crucified and buried and Resurrected sitting on the memorial on the throne of God as a memorial he sent the spirit that was in that body upon the church and he started building a pyramid justification certification is narrowing narrowing narrowing until it's come to this point and you can you can see the brother John Noble was there coming and brother Tom Bailey was baptized you can see crowd over there we were hiding away somewhere and then let's see the next one Supernatural Vindication you see there was no shirt but when that was taken look at that Supernatural vindications not just in the prophet if we will follow the same message and do exactly what the messenger says we should do God is Duty bound to perform the same Supernatural science might not be the same level but individually we will be identified with the Risen Savior it may not it may not be you see people are expecting an overnight something and we call ourselves the Seed of Abraham and we cannot even wait for 10 years 20 years and we are spending overnight miracle and if it doesn't happen then we think the message is not true this Mercy is true we believed it and God has constantly been vindicating it and constantly proving that this word that we have believed is true amen I remember those one of our sisters in 1992 she had a ectopic pregnancies two different ectopic pregnancies are two different times and I gathered a bunch of systems that were wanting children in our house and we fasted and prayed those one sister the Holy Spirit fell on Earth that said the Lord the sister is going to give birth no fallopian tubes and she gave birth to a bouncing baby the Lord is took God don't be afraid to trust him and lean on his promises nothing is too hard for him he's still the same it might take a long while [Applause] but Hebrews 10 35 you have need or patience that after you have done the will of God you might obtain the promises patiently hang on brother yes sister I'm gonna hold on one day God will send the angels of mercy your way I need to all be over Hallelujah amen let me try

whatever he allows yes the Lord bless your Saints [Music] God bless you Stephen let's give the Lord the club open glory to God thank you very much amen enjoy the word I'm just going to read one thing and then we pray it's in uh you don't have to turn it's in Matthew 7. verse 24. the Bible says therefore whosoever heareth this saying of mine and do them hearing is good but if you don't do them it's not going to help you you might be under the word and you're hearing the word but if you don't do them you are not building that Foundation the Bible says that therefore whosoever Hearth the saying of mine which is the word of God and doeth them are liking him onto a wise man so a wise man is not somebody who's only hears of the word but he's a heareth and a doers of the word he said I would like an unto him as to where unto a wise men which buildeth his house upon a rock so if you are hearing the word of God and you are doing what God is telling you to do automatically in a spiritual realm you are building your house in a solid rock but if we are hearing the word of God and you are not doing what God is telling you to do just stand ashore that it's on the sinking sand all it takes it's a lot of blood from hell and you will realize you're on the floor we don't want to be on the floor amen this message is not complicated I was communicating with a young man last night and he's going through a lot of things and I told him I say you're too young to be going through depression because you have many things that you have to overcome in your life and you have many things you have to accomplish you're not there yet in other words if at this stage you start depression depression depression I don't know how you're going to face your future when you get married and things like that amen amen I said the problem is you don't want to give up amen amen you're just between two opinion you don't want to give up something and we go under the pretense of depression of I can't take it no more I need some time no it's not that amen because when you go get fun you don't get depressed when you go hang out you don't get depressed when you spend your time joking you don't get depressed but when they tell you this is not what you're supposed to do this is what you're supposed to do now you're getting depressed then it's too much then I can't take it no more the problem is not that the problem is you don't want to give out something because you don't want to take the way of the Lord which at this point the devil is making is convincing you that it's hard oh man amen amen you don't know what people are going in this life what they are that they are I mean people are going through a lot of headache and just being where you are today you are blessed whatever you think like it's a headache talk to the people that don't believe this message and see what kind of turmoil they are in amen amen but all all God is asking you is simple amen amen amen amen it's very easy to open the refrigerator to get a drink it becomes a problem to take the bottle of juice and put it back in the refrigerator then it's a problem but when you want to go to the refrigerator to open and to take the juice you have the strength when you sit down you drink something and Mama come and say take the bottle put it back there then we fasting and we have a tendency to stand and leave that juice right there and go around upstairs come downstairs and that juice will stay ready and when somebody comes and say can you take that back to the refrigerator we start fussing you didn't fast when he was about going to get it you only fast when they're telling you to put it back watch your life all this depression you're coming up with I'm exhausted I'm too much I'm too much watch exactly what it is you just don't want to get under headship you don't want to give out you are fussing you want your way in that's why we are suffering and we are going up and down up and down up and down because we don't want to listen whoever heareth and do what they told you to do amen if we already preach something here you already heard it do what they tell you to do even though you don't feel like it but if you just obey obedience will entitle you to the token when you do that you're showing the devil that no matter what I'm going through I'm still gonna obey God and you are building your house in a solid rock it's as simple as it is it's not complicated let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father tonight thanking you once again for speaking to us and reconfirming everything Lord that we spoke on Sunday father the hour is very late I don't know how I can cry how many times I can write or I can text or scream and tell somebody the hour is late everything is shaking the election they don't even know which way they're going shaking there is only one thing that is Christ there was only one thing that we can cherish which is the message that you have given us father may you help your children and may you be with them may you open eyes to the fathers to the married man to the mothers to the young people to see exactly and to get a revelation personally of what this message is all about so that it won't be any struggle but they will understand that it's the love of God fully expressed and display in the face of what we're hearing and what we call the word of God father may you give us travel Mercy tonight and be with us Lord protect your children and touch those that have been affected by the flu or the cold that was going around father may you strengthen brother Jimmy and be with him Lord father and his church back home Lord consecrate us and don't let anybody Lord father sleep up but may we Ponder throughout the week if you tear it until we will find ourselves so in your presence that by the time we get here you will be right there at the appointment father those that are struggling in the marriage or in their personal life those that do not want to give out just this one thing or the other Lord help them give them the strength to realize that whatever they are valued cannot be ever compared to what you're trying to offer them father I pray as a shepherd and I'm pleading that you'll be merciful to us and help us in Jesus precious name amen go ahead said then you can dismiss the church [Music] all right hallelujah amen we'll take this song Hosanna Blessed Be the rock of my salvation amen Hosanna nervous don't step in the rock of my salvation foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
