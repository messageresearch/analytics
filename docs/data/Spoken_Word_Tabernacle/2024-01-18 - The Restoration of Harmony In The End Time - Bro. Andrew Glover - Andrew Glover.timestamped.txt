[40:15] from our pastor brother Shawn Martin the
[40:17] Saints there at home send their
[40:18] greetings to you as well so amen we just
[40:21] want to get right in the word tonight in
[40:23] the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter and
[40:26] the 19th verse I know this is a very
[40:28] familiar verse to you but Jesus here
[40:31] speaking said again I say unto you that
[40:34] if two of you shall agree on Earth as
[40:38] touching anything that they shall ask it
[40:41] shall be done for them of My Father
[40:45] which is in heaven now he's speaking of
[40:47] two places one is Earth and one is
[40:50] heaven if any to agree on Earth as
[40:53] touching anything that they shall ask it
[40:56] shall shall be done for them of My
[40:58] Father which is in heaven now in the
[41:01] Book of John the 15th chapter The Book
[41:04] of John the 15th chapter and the fifth
[41:07] verse uh Jesus here speaking once again
[41:10] in John 15 verse5 and he's actually
[41:13] identifying the Believers as the
[41:15] branches of the
[41:17] vine and in John
[41:19] 15:5 he says I am the vine and ye are
[41:22] the branches now he that abideth in me
[41:25] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[41:28] much fruit for without me ye can do
[41:33] nothing now in the 15th verse he says
[41:35] henceforth I call you not servants for
[41:38] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[41:40] doeth but I have called you friends for
[41:43] all things that I have heard of my
[41:45] father I have made known unto you now
[41:48] it's almost as if he is shifting a
[41:50] dispensation to the believer in the 16th
[41:53] verse he said ye have not chosen me but
[41:56] now I have chosen you and ordained you
[42:00] that you should go forth and bring fruit
[42:02] and that your fruit should remain and
[42:04] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[42:07] father in my name he may give it unto
[42:10] you so if any two or three agree is
[42:12] touching anything on the earth it shall
[42:14] be done here he's saying what was done
[42:17] between him and his father is now going
[42:19] to be done between the Believers and his
[42:21] father and if you look in the book of
[42:23] Acts the 2 chapter and the first verse
[42:26] it's a very very familiar reading we'll
[42:28] give you our subject and let you be
[42:29] seated but in Acts the 2 chapter and
[42:33] verse number one my good atmosphere in
[42:35] the building tonight amen Acts chapter 2
[42:38] and verse one and the Bible said when
[42:41] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[42:44] were all with one Accord in one place
[42:48] and suddenly there came a sound from
[42:51] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[42:55] it filled all the the house where they
[42:58] were sitting we've gone now from the
[43:01] fatherhood dispensation to the sunship
[43:03] dispensation to where now the prophet
[43:05] said it's the Holy Ghost dispensation in
[43:09] the body amen we ask Lord this evening
[43:11] to bless the reading of his word as you
[43:12] can have your seats here uh this
[43:14] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[43:16] Lord for just a few moments to speak to
[43:18] you tonight and if I title this tonight
[43:20] I want to speak to you on the
[43:21] restoration of Harmony in the end time
[43:25] the restoration of Harmony in the end
[43:27] time I use that word harmony because I
[43:29] personally believe that there is power
[43:32] in harmony I believe there's power in
[43:34] Harmony and I believe that we can easily
[43:37] take that word power of Harmony amen and
[43:40] exchange it to the power of agreement so
[43:43] where there is harmony there is an
[43:45] agreement and where there is an
[43:46] agreement there is harmony now in the
[43:49] message question answerers 1954 brother
[43:51] BR said the main thing above everything
[43:54] is to keep the church in harmony amen
[43:56] and in love of God and moving on if we
[43:59] can all believe that the blood of Jesus
[44:01] Christ cleanses us from all sin and
[44:03] unrighteousness then if the woman
[44:05] sitting next to you or the man sitting
[44:07] next to you if he doesn't believe that
[44:09] Jesus will actually come visibly again
[44:12] then let's just believe it and go right
[44:14] ahead anyhow we don't agree with him on
[44:16] the scripture but let's make the church
[44:18] move on for harmony because in there
[44:21] we're going to catch some more people
[44:24] amen but when the church is out of
[44:26] Harmony he said then you hurt the church
[44:29] and you hurt the ca so when the church
[44:31] is in harmony amen the power of Harmony
[44:34] has the ability to catch some others
[44:37] amen but when the church is out of
[44:39] Harmony you are hurting the church as
[44:41] well as hurting the cause of Christ
[44:43] again he said I believe that everything
[44:45] in the natural line amen Works in
[44:48] harmony or should with the spiritual in
[44:51] the message the Inside Man let that
[44:53] Faith just meet the condition and it'll
[44:55] be for that thou has said as thou Hast
[44:58] believed in thy heart so shall it be he
[45:00] said and make the whole atmosphere here
[45:03] Lord make it a creative atmosphere of
[45:05] one soul of one mind of one Accord and
[45:09] one purpose amen my heart is so hungry
[45:12] to see that atmosphere see the
[45:14] atmosphere is what brings it if every
[45:16] person here would get in one Perfect
[45:19] Harmony amen it would be settled see
[45:22] like the natural way for an egg to hatch
[45:24] is put it under a h
[45:26] and then it'll hatch because it's the
[45:28] atmosphere it's warm but you just wrap
[45:30] it in a blanket keep it warm it'll hatch
[45:32] anyhow put it in an incubator it'll
[45:35] hatch anyhow amen it's the atmosphere
[45:38] that brings the results amen it's the
[45:41] atmosphere that brings the results amen
[45:44] can I give you one more he said now this
[45:46] person what if you could ever get this
[45:48] Soul on the inside so in harmony with
[45:51] God Amen that your soul and God would be
[45:54] one together amen that your soul and God
[45:58] would be one together then you could ask
[46:00] what you will and it shall be given unto
[46:03] you amen I believe that this is the hour
[46:06] amen that Harmony has been restored to
[46:08] the
[46:09] church I believe that this is the hour
[46:12] that we're not one with a denomination
[46:14] amen we're not one with a system we're
[46:16] not one with a man's idea amen but we
[46:19] are one with a word amen and there is an
[46:22] agreement between the believer on the
[46:24] earth and their father in heaven and
[46:26] they can ask what they will amen and it
[46:29] shall be given unto them amen I believe
[46:32] that God Amen desires Harmony in the
[46:35] church amen I'm going to say this
[46:37] tonight Lucifer hates Harmony amen he
[46:40] despises Harmony amen and he will do
[46:43] anything that he can Amen to see that
[46:45] the harmony is broken amen now I'll say
[46:48] this amen what Lucifer will use is he
[46:51] will use Discord Amen to break up
[46:54] Harmony
[46:56] Lucifer will use Discord to break up
[46:59] Harmony now you all know the Bible says
[47:02] there's seven things that God hates amen
[47:04] and one of them is he that sth Discord
[47:08] among the Brethren now that word Discord
[47:10] means Strife or contention so he that
[47:14] sth Strife amen or contention among the
[47:17] Brethren is a tool in the hand of
[47:20] Lucifer to break the harmony between the
[47:23] Earth and Heaven in other words Prophet
[47:26] said one thing God's hate amen is sowing
[47:29] Discord among the Brethren that's right
[47:31] he said and thems the organizations is
[47:34] what's done it amen organization has SW
[47:37] Discord amen among the Brethren he said
[47:40] we should be standing in the breach amen
[47:43] and saying that we are brothers amen now
[47:46] come on because denomination is divided
[47:48] amen they're divided on Doctrine they're
[47:51] divided on preachers they're divided on
[47:53] groups amen now let me just say it that
[47:56] devil didn't stay out there amen but
[47:58] that devil is trying to creep his way
[48:00] amen right into the ranks of our message
[48:03] amen and divide brothers and divide
[48:05] churches and divide Fellowship amen but
[48:08] I believe in the fatherhood of God and I
[48:11] believe in the Brotherhood of Man and I
[48:13] think that we're brothers together and
[48:16] that's the way we should be amen and God
[48:19] has his children now maybe some of them
[48:21] are a little odd to our belief or your
[48:23] belief or mine amen but God has accepted
[48:27] his children amen so we accept them as
[48:30] our brothers and our sisters now come on
[48:33] church amen cuz not everybody's going to
[48:35] see it the same way not everybody's
[48:37] going to see it like you or see it like
[48:39] me amen but there is one thing that we
[48:43] must see and that is the message of the
[48:46] hour we must see the message of the hour
[48:51] then the message of the hour becomes the
[48:54] basis of our fellowship
[48:56] amen now when you start when you start
[48:57] preaching about Harmony and unity in the
[48:59] body amen the devil raises his head and
[49:02] says well we got so many Revelations and
[49:05] we got so many deep things amen that we
[49:07] don't need to preach on Harmony we don't
[49:09] need to preach on Unity amen but I
[49:12] believe it's more important than we
[49:14] realize I believe that Harmony I believe
[49:17] that Unity is more important than we
[49:19] realize amen amen amen amen amen amen
[49:23] I'm just going to say it amen we must be
[49:26] in harmony or in tune with God Amen to
[49:29] declare the supernatural amen now can
[49:32] can I read you this quote the prophet of
[49:34] God said in the fourth dimension he said
[49:37] people can prove that right through this
[49:39] room now is coming radio activity see
[49:42] there's radio messages coming right
[49:44] through this building now it's coming
[49:46] television pictures but it's too fast
[49:49] for our eyes now you go a million miles
[49:52] beyond that Dimension and you'll go into
[49:54] a place that is just as real as
[49:56] television pictures is in this room this
[49:59] morning he said and there's the Lord
[50:01] Jesus Christ amen the resurrected Son of
[50:04] God standing here and the reason that
[50:07] you cannot see him is because our heart
[50:11] hasn't become tuned amen down to it so
[50:14] it's not that he's not there it's that
[50:16] our heart is not tuned down Amen to pick
[50:20] up what is there amen we're too tuned up
[50:22] to the world and tuned up to what this
[50:24] church is doing
[50:25] tuned up to what that preacher's
[50:27] preaching amen but don't you think it's
[50:29] time Amen to come back to the homeland
[50:32] of the church amen the message of the
[50:34] hour amen and tune our heart up with
[50:37] what a prophet has told what the
[50:39] scripture has spoken what the spirit is
[50:41] revealing what the anointing is
[50:44] manifesting I think it's time Amen to
[50:47] restore the harmony of the spirit of the
[50:50] Living God in the Church of the Living
[50:52] God with the authority of the Living God
[50:55] manif esting the Greater Works of the
[50:57] Living God in this generation amen amen
[51:01] amen amen amen that's the reason that's
[51:03] the reason we can't see television
[51:05] pictures he said that's the reason we
[51:07] can't see them amen is because we are
[51:10] not tuned down to them he said our
[51:12] bodies are not set as instruments to
[51:15] pick up mechanical sent things but when
[51:17] our body becomes in tune with God when
[51:21] our body becomes in tune with God
[51:24] becoming a part of him then our soul can
[51:27] pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to
[51:31] vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus
[51:34] Christ in all of his power and
[51:37] omnipotence listen you don't realize how
[51:40] powerful you are you're not just a
[51:42] church member you are here as an
[51:44] instrument on the earth to declare
[51:47] Another Dimension come on we can see we
[51:51] can taste we can feel we can smell amen
[51:54] but the only way we can declare him is
[51:57] he comes into us and our soul amen will
[52:01] pick up his power our soul will pick up
[52:03] his omnipotence and our soul will
[52:06] declare him as real in this Dimension as
[52:09] he is in that Dimension he said he has
[52:12] risen from the dead he lives among us
[52:14] today and he wants Fellowship back with
[52:17] his people again his great Majesty his
[52:20] glory is now spreading forth and he's
[52:23] Desiring to Fellowship again with his
[52:26] people like he did in the Garden of Eden
[52:29] now in the Garden of Eden you know there
[52:31] was perfect Oneness and the prophet said
[52:33] that perfect Oneness amen is God and His
[52:36] creation amen God speaking lit to ear
[52:40] amen perfect Oneness is God and His
[52:43] Creation in Fellowship amen hearing
[52:46] directly what he has to say to the
[52:49] creation amen now you know that the fall
[52:51] in the garden amen come in and Lucifer
[52:54] the serpent amen that the devil caused
[52:57] the harmony between the Creator and the
[53:00] creation to be broken and you know when
[53:02] Harmony is broken amen there are going
[53:05] to be repercussions when Harmony is
[53:07] broken the prophet of God said like this
[53:10] he said one time when the Lord was
[53:11] sending me among the Pentecostals he
[53:13] said I went and told my mother-in-law
[53:15] and she said you're not taking my
[53:17] daughter among that trash he said well
[53:19] she's my wife she said she's my daughter
[53:22] she said I'll go to my grave heartbroken
[53:25] he said now watch I listen to my
[53:27] mother-in-law instead of listening to
[53:29] God and he said sorrow said in
[53:32] immediately he said in 1937 the flood
[53:35] came up and then Sorrows begin to break
[53:38] in and things went wrong the
[53:40] congregation begin to drop amen just get
[53:42] out of harmony with God one time he said
[53:45] and friends I will regret it amen as
[53:48] long as I live now I know what you're
[53:50] thinking you're thinking he was a
[53:52] prophet so because he was a prophet amen
[53:55] he didn't have to have no correction
[53:57] amen God would let him get out of
[53:59] Harmony and then just let him go on as
[54:01] if everything was okay amen but you got
[54:03] to remember that the spirit of the
[54:05] Prophet amen is subject to the prophecy
[54:09] am now come on church and God is no
[54:12] respector of
[54:14] persons if he got out of Harmony and had
[54:17] to endure the chastisement to get back
[54:20] in harmony amen you best believe that if
[54:22] we get out of Harmony we're going to
[54:25] have to endure the correction to get
[54:27] back in harmony amen because God is no
[54:30] respector of persons amen I'll say this
[54:33] that God by the new birth and the
[54:35] baptism of the holy spirit amen has made
[54:38] a way amen for harmony to be restored
[54:42] brother said the new birth is an
[54:44] experience right it's a gift of God it's
[54:47] the Seal of your faith the holy spirit
[54:49] is a seal Ephesians 4:30 he said God
[54:52] made Abraham the promise and Abra
[54:55] believed God and was justified by faith
[54:58] and God give him the sign of
[55:00] circumcision as a seal amen so he does
[55:04] today amen we believe him and then if
[55:07] you say you believe and do not receive
[55:10] the Holy Spirit then you do not believe
[55:12] cause God promised Amen to give you the
[55:15] Holy Spirit when you did believe now
[55:18] remember what Paul said he said have you
[55:21] received the Holy Ghost since you
[55:23] believed amen see when the spirit of God
[55:26] comes into a man it quickens him he
[55:29] becomes a new creature he believes in
[55:32] the immortal God and he believes that he
[55:35] does all things and his heart is in tune
[55:38] with God when God comes in a man amen he
[55:42] makes him a new creature he quickens him
[55:45] to the Revelation that he's not a
[55:47] man-made God he's an immortal God he's
[55:50] the only wise God he's the only true God
[55:54] Amen and that man's heart becomes in
[55:56] tune with another dimension so he begins
[55:59] to declare things amen that is in
[56:02] another
[56:04] dimension Oh Glory to God he begins to
[56:07] declare Things From Another Dimension in
[56:10] this Dimension and you see a
[56:13] supernatural manifestation of a Heavenly
[56:16] God on the
[56:19] earth his heart comes in tune with God
[56:23] now let me say this no matter what
[56:25] happens no matter what happens amen you
[56:28] keep your heart in tune with God Amen

[56:48] Living God amen amen y'all know I'm
[56:52] telling the truth amen we don't see God
[56:54] like we used to cuz our heart is not in
[56:56] tune with God like it used to be we
[56:59] don't feel the anointing because we come
[57:01] to church and our heart's in tune with
[57:03] this show and it's in tune with this
[57:05] song and it's in tune with this career
[57:08] amen but why don't we come back and say
[57:10] God tune my heart up amen tune me back
[57:13] up to the supernatural tune me back up
[57:16] to that Dimension where there is a
[57:19] resurrected god with a power and an
[57:22] omnipotence to declare himself

[58:08] if you can stay in tune if you can stay
[58:10] in harmony there will be a signal
[58:13] that'll be Sent From Another Dimension
[58:16] it'll be a message of Deliverance it'll
[58:18] be a message of authority and that
[58:21] Heavenly declaration will break the
[58:23] Devil's Backbone in your
[58:27] situation if that's right with God our
[58:29] heart he said you'll come forth as sure
[58:32] and as certain as there is a God in
[58:34] heaven if it's not right with God you've
[58:36] got to take the other route so you make
[58:39] your choice today for Christ amen now
[58:43] somebody said well brother Andrew you
[58:44] know I don't think it's very important
[58:46] that my heart stays in tune with god
[58:48] well brother Ram said there was a man
[58:49] coming one time Amen to the to the
[58:52] communion table and he asked brother Ram
[58:54] a question they said brother why would
[58:56] Christ appear to me as I was about to
[58:59] take the sacraments so here's an
[59:01] individual Amen brother Steven walking
[59:03] down to the communion table and Christ
[59:06] appears to them said well no doubt amen
[59:09] that your heart was just in tune with
[59:11] God and you was coming sacredly up to
[59:14] God and that's why he appeared to you
[59:17] see that would be the only reason that I
[59:20] know not because they had a lot of money
[59:22] not because they had a lot of understand
[59:24] in but because their heart was in tune
[59:27] with God and he could speak he could
[59:30] appear he could reveal he could show
[59:33] himself as the wise God on the
[59:37] scene I believe in the power of Harmony
[59:40] I'll just tell you what the definition
[59:41] of harmony means it is the combination
[59:45] amen of simultaneously sounded somebody
[59:48] say sounded musical notes Amen to
[59:51] produce chords amen and the chord
[59:54] progress agressions having a pleasing
[59:56] effect so Harmony is bringing many parts
[1:00:00] into one part that there would come an
[1:00:03] agreement that that agreement would
[1:00:05] bring a pleasing
[1:00:07] effect oh the quality of forming a
[1:00:11] pleasing and a consistent hole amen
[1:00:14] Harmony is very important in musical
[1:00:17] Productions amen because the purpose of
[1:00:19] music is to display the ability of
[1:00:22] Harmony now let me say this Jesus was
[1:00:26] the greatest manifestation of Harmony
[1:00:29] that we ever seen the prophet of God
[1:00:31] said our lord Jesus as we're speaking of
[1:00:33] him he said I love to read after him
[1:00:36] because he never made one mistake amen
[1:00:40] everything he done was perfectly in
[1:00:43] harmony with god oh how much time we
[1:00:46] waste as we Leisure around see amen but
[1:00:49] Jesus never at one time amen was ever
[1:00:52] caught gting around every move somebody
[1:00:55] say every move every place he went amen
[1:00:59] every place he went everything he did
[1:01:02] every word he spoke it had a meaning to
[1:01:05] it and was exactly in harmony with God
[1:01:09] and the will of God come on church I Pro
[1:01:13] I proposed to you tonight that Jesus was
[1:01:16] the word made flesh he was God In the
[1:01:19] Flesh amen and every word he spoke every
[1:01:22] place he went every AC he did every move
[1:01:25] he made was a perfect reflection of the
[1:01:29] harmony between he and his father and he
[1:01:32] was not in heaven declaring that he was
[1:01:35] on the
[1:01:37] earth so in other words he come from God
[1:01:41] and he went back to God and the prophet
[1:01:43] said the very evidence the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:45] here is because the same God that
[1:01:47] descended into human flesh is the same
[1:01:51] God that ascended and sent back his
[1:01:53] Spirit Well the devil may not believe
[1:01:55] there's no Holy Ghost but he's come too
[1:01:58] late because I am a living I'm a
[1:02:01] breathing witness that there's a holy
[1:02:03] ghost in the Earth
[1:02:06] today I've got the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:02:09] the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost every place he went every word he
[1:02:14] said every mood he made everything he
[1:02:18] done had a meaning to it he said that's
[1:02:20] the reason he was so pleased with him
[1:02:22] saying this is my beloved son in whom I
[1:02:26] am
[1:02:27] well pleased what does harmony do
[1:02:31] Harmony brings
[1:02:32] simultaneously amen sounded notes into
[1:02:35] one cord to where that one chord would
[1:02:38] have a pleasing effect oh and all that
[1:02:41] was in God he poured into Christ and
[1:02:45] there was a Harmony between the father
[1:02:48] and the son that that Harmony would
[1:02:50] bring a pleasing effect amen amen amen
[1:02:54] well glory to God everything was
[1:02:57] perfectly in harmony with him now can I
[1:03:00] show you one instance in St John 5 Jesus
[1:03:04] passes by the pool of beesa there's many
[1:03:07] sick folk laying there there's many lame
[1:03:09] laying there but he goes to one man he
[1:03:12] bypassed hundreds and went to one and he
[1:03:16] healed that man and brother ca he healed
[1:03:18] him on the Sabbath day and all the Jews
[1:03:21] and Pharisees and Sadducees they got all
[1:03:23] mad and they sought to kill him because
[1:03:26] he had not only broken the Sabbath but
[1:03:29] said also that God was his father which
[1:03:32] was making himself equal with God that's
[1:03:36] right now can I show you something the
[1:03:39] man was in a sick condition he was in a
[1:03:42] lame condition but because there was an
[1:03:45] instrument on the earth who was in
[1:03:47] harmony with another dimension that that
[1:03:50] Dimension from Heaven could speak to
[1:03:52] this dimension on the earth and they
[1:03:54] could come into one heart into one
[1:03:56] agreement and they could say rise and
[1:03:58] take your bed listen there was a
[1:04:00] pleasing effect of the harmony of God
[1:04:04] That Came Upon that impotent man and he
[1:04:06] went off walking and praising God Amen
[1:04:09] and everybody got mad and Jesus looked
[1:04:11] at him and said the son can do nothing
[1:04:14] of himself but what he seeth the father
[1:04:17] do for what things he doeth amen these
[1:04:20] also doeth the son likewise now can I
[1:04:23] preach this to you
[1:04:25] brother B said when he passed by the
[1:04:26] pool he seen all the people but he
[1:04:29] healed one man amen amen amen amen he
[1:04:32] and the Jews questioned him and said why
[1:04:35] and we notic that Jesus was a kind
[1:04:38] man I'm turning the corner now take your
[1:04:40] time Jesus was a kind man take your time
[1:04:43] my brother he was a humble man yes my
[1:04:45] brother yet he was a man of power he was
[1:04:49] a kind man he was a humble man but he
[1:04:52] was yet a man of power when he spoke he
[1:04:55] was very humble and gentle but when it
[1:04:58] come time between to separate amen the
[1:05:01] truth from the error Jesus was very
[1:05:04] Stern so the same man that was kind and
[1:05:08] humble when it come time to separate
[1:05:11] amen the truth from the air he become
[1:05:13] very Stern and he platted ropes and he
[1:05:17] ran the money changers out of the
[1:05:20] temple the prophet of God said he was a
[1:05:22] man who could speak when it come time to
[1:05:24] speak he was a man who was full of love
[1:05:27] amen can we declare war here for a
[1:05:29] minute he was a man who was full of love
[1:05:32] but he loved his father so much till he
[1:05:35] stayed in harmony with his father and
[1:05:38] anything amen anything that interfered
[1:05:42] with that Harmony then Jesus drew the
[1:05:45] line that's it that's it Oh Oh Glory
[1:05:49] anything that interfered with the
[1:05:52] harmony between him and his father is
[1:05:55] where Jesus drew the line come on church
[1:05:58] he loved the Pharisees he loved the
[1:06:01] sades he was a kind man towards them but
[1:06:05] when their Traditions tried to get
[1:06:07] between him and his father he drew the
[1:06:10] line he loved the Sadducees he loved the
[1:06:13] scribes but when their rituals tried to
[1:06:16] get between him and his father he drew
[1:06:18] the line Well church a living God I
[1:06:21] think it's time for the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ am meant to get anointed with the
[1:06:26] same spirit that was Upon Our Lord and
[1:06:30] anything anything anything anything that
[1:06:35] interferes with the harmony between us
[1:06:37] and our Lord we ought to draw the line
[1:06:40] draw our sword and cut that devil's head
[1:06:45] off and make way for the harmony of the
[1:06:49] Holy Ghost amen amen amen come on I'm

[1:11:34] was Jesus and he drew the line can I
[1:11:36] show you a Vindicated prophet he said

[1:11:42] the instructions of my brothers as long
[1:11:45] as it doesn't interfere with the things
[1:11:49] that God has for me to
[1:11:51] do now I I I'm GNA I'm GNA I'm going to
[1:11:54] drive this point home for a minute your
[1:11:56] time that word interfere means to take
[1:11:59] part or intervene in an activity without
[1:12:02] invitation or necessity thank you very
[1:12:05] much thank you very much so lunch with
[1:12:08] unbelievers is not a necessity amen amen
[1:12:11] amen repeat it over again repeat it
[1:12:14] please birthday parties with reprobates
[1:12:17] it's not a necessity repeat it again my
[1:12:20] brother come on Church Fellowship
[1:12:23] Gathering with unbelievers is not a
[1:12:26] necessity come on I tell you what
[1:12:28] they're doing they're coming in your
[1:12:30] life Uninvited amen amen amen am that
[1:12:34] word interfere means to prevent a
[1:12:36] process or activity from continuing or
[1:12:39] being carried out properly it is of a
[1:12:41] thing to strike against something when
[1:12:44] it's working it is to get in the way of
[1:12:47] now watch this to handle or adjust
[1:12:49] something without permission so when
[1:12:52] something begins to interfere it means
[1:12:55] you're adjusting something or you're
[1:12:57] handling something and you don't have no
[1:12:59] permission to put your hands on
[1:13:01] it am now usually when there's some
[1:13:05] interference there's a repercussion of
[1:13:07] damage because somebody who was
[1:13:10] unauthorized to touch the thing put
[1:13:12] their hands on it and when they got done
[1:13:15] with it they damaged it amen can I just
[1:13:19] say this Satan he is the master at
[1:13:22] interfering we brother said we find
[1:13:24] Satan right quickly at work with God's
[1:13:26] program he said we see that malignant
[1:13:28] eye of the devil that serpent that's
[1:13:30] always tried to interfere with God's
[1:13:33] program before it comes on the earth so
[1:13:36] before the program of God comes on the
[1:13:39] earth the malignant eye of the devil is
[1:13:42] trying to interfere with that see but
[1:13:44] now now can I give you a Biblical
[1:13:46] example amen there was a man named Moses
[1:13:49] who was ordained to lead Israel out but
[1:13:52] there were two impersonator named Dayan

[1:14:30] deny the power thereof he said from such
[1:14:33] turn away amen do you believe that to be
[1:14:36] right I believe with all my heart he

[1:18:21] happened just now I went into another
[1:18:27] world I went into another world
[1:18:31] see it's an Unseen World we become so
[1:18:35] conscious of looking at one another like
[1:18:36] this but there's an Unseen World and
[1:18:39] it's greater than anything you can see
[1:18:41] and here is Christ in this building here

[1:19:00] spirit's moving this is what you call
[1:19:02] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but
[1:19:06] remember Satan is always a skeptic at
[1:19:10] the sons of God he always does that some
[1:19:13] of a skeptic idea when they do that he's
[1:19:16] just trying to interfere but can I can I
[1:19:19] can I dedicate something to the devil

[1:25:40] anointed to tear the devil's Kingdom
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:47] down some of y'all wonder what's on you
[1:25:50] right now it's not an emotion it's it's
[1:25:52] not a feeling it's not a sensation it's
[1:25:55] the anointing it's the anointing amen
[1:25:59] it's the anointing
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:01] amen glory I believe in the anointing I
[1:26:06] believe in the anointing I believe it
[1:26:08] like the Bible said it ran down over
[1:26:10] Aaron it ran through his beard it ran
[1:26:13] all
[1:26:15] over Oh Glory to God he that is in you
[1:26:21] has already
[1:26:22] overcome the
[1:26:24] world and who is in you the anointed
[1:26:27] word and greater greater is the anointed
[1:26:32] word in your soul than the lies of the
[1:26:35] devil in your flesh greater greater
[1:26:40] greater is the anointing of the word of
[1:26:43] God in your
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:47] soul I feel like a prophet Isaiah right
[1:26:50] now he said the yoke
[1:26:52] he said the Yoke amen amen shall be
[1:26:55] destroyed amen why because of the
[1:26:59] anointing you know what the prophet of
[1:27:01] God said Hallelujah he said we are God's
[1:27:03] fruit Bears am and we are God's
[1:27:06] lightbearers he said there is an alloted
[1:27:09] portion of the word of God that's been
[1:27:12] laid out for this season that's been
[1:27:14] laid out for this age you know what he
[1:27:16] said he said so God sends the anointing
[1:27:20] amen God sends the anointing oting into
[1:27:23] the age to find the soul that's got the
[1:27:27] seed and that anointing strikes that
[1:27:30] seed and click that seed and that seed
[1:27:34] comes to full
[1:27:36] maturity and when the pillar of fire
[1:27:39] when the Loos of God when the anointing
[1:27:43] strikes the seed the seed loses the
[1:27:48] Yol can I just say it brother Steven you
[1:27:52] never wear the Yoke
[1:27:54] again who the son has made free is free
[1:27:58] indeed ye shall know the word and thy
[1:28:02] truth is the word and the word shall
[1:28:05] make you free the word shall break the
[1:28:11] anointing glory to God can I say it to
[1:28:14] you like this amen the anointing does
[1:28:16] not break the Yol the anointing destroys
[1:28:20] the Yol amen
[1:28:22] Amen brother Steven there's a big
[1:28:24] difference there's a big difference in
[1:28:27] something broke and something destroyed
[1:28:31] when something is broken you can take it
[1:28:33] to the repair man he can put it back
[1:28:37] together and it can be fixed but when
[1:28:40] something is destroyed annihilated it's
[1:28:43] beyond repair it's annihilated yes sir
[1:28:46] it's beyond hope amen oh Church of the
[1:28:49] Living God I'm talking about the
[1:28:52] anointing of the harmony of the father
[1:28:55] and the son has come into your life and
[1:28:58] has destroyed the nature of the
[1:29:01] devil and the nature of the devil can
[1:29:04] never raise up again in your soul for
[1:29:08] the soul who has believed on God has
[1:29:12] passed amen has passed from Death unto
[1:29:17] life unto life amen amen Oh Glory to God
[1:29:21] the yoke
[1:29:22] I said the Yoke has been destroyed
[1:29:26] because of the anointing amen amen amen
[1:29:31] the Yol take your time the Yol take your
[1:29:33] time has been destroyed yes my brother
[1:29:37] take your time because of the anointing
[1:29:40] Hallelujah so what's happened go ahead
[1:29:43] the soul has passed from Death un life
[1:29:47] amen Amen brother B said you're a Triune
[1:29:49] being just like father son Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] you got a body you got a spirit and you
[1:29:54] got a soul that's right brother said the
[1:29:56] soul is the control tower of God he said
[1:29:59] now watch he said that soul is the
[1:30:02] nature of the spirit that's right the
[1:30:04] nature of the spirit that controls the
[1:30:06] body see that's right now in your inner
[1:30:09] man you're made up in the system of a
[1:30:12] Tabernacle in the outer courts the holy
[1:30:15] place and the holies of holies the Shak
[1:30:18] glory on the inside the veil yes now
[1:30:22] watch this you have the outer Court you
[1:30:24] have the inner Court you have the holies
[1:30:27] of holies but in the holies of holies
[1:30:30] you have the shik glory you have the Sho
[1:30:33] bread you have the visible manifestation
[1:30:37] of the presence of God in the holies of
[1:30:40] holies in other words the old man is
[1:30:43] crucified and the new man has been risen
[1:30:47] now I've got a bunch of scripture on it
[1:30:48] I'm just going to go through it quickly
[1:30:50] in Ephesians 3:16
[1:30:52] he said that he would Grant you
[1:30:53] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:30:55] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:30:58] in the inner
[1:31:00] man I love this one in 2 Corinthians
[1:31:02] 4:16 brother CLE for which cause we
[1:31:05] faint not but though our outward man
[1:31:08] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:31:12] by day amen now now in Colossians 3:9
[1:31:15] lie not one to another seeing that you
[1:31:18] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:31:20] and have put on the put on the new man
[1:31:24] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[1:31:28] image of him that created him then there
[1:31:31] is an anointing coming in this age and
[1:31:34] it's not just striking the outer man
[1:31:36] it's not just striking your spirit the
[1:31:39] anointing is striking your soul amen do
[1:31:43] you all know that brother said like this
[1:31:45] did you know there's another man inside
[1:31:47] of your body and that is a spirit man
[1:31:51] that's in here
[1:31:52] that's the inside man he said there's a
[1:31:55] conscience there's a subconscious and
[1:31:57] then there's God now watch this he said
[1:32:00] but way down now watch the ship going
[1:32:02] overseas the man up here gives the
[1:32:04] orders the man goes down in the ship to
[1:32:06] run the ship down here well don't see
[1:32:08] where he's going but he takes the order
[1:32:09] from up above well now he says steer to
[1:32:11] the left steer to the right give the
[1:32:12] engine more whatever it is he just works
[1:32:15] by orders but way down in the midst of
[1:32:18] us here in our heart is the subconscious
[1:32:21] and it takes orders from up here so the
[1:32:24] subconscious brother Judah is taking
[1:32:26] orders from the conscience and the
[1:32:28] conscience is taking orders from God
[1:32:30] amen amen take your time are you seeing
[1:32:33] this there's three parts coming into
[1:32:36] harmony to get the ship out of the
[1:32:38] harbor God is giving the orders the
[1:32:41] conscience is receiving them and the
[1:32:43] subconscious is acting on the orders
[1:32:46] that has come down to the
[1:32:48] line glory to God he said now now I said
[1:32:51] if that's right and the conscience is
[1:32:54] right and the subconscious is wrong and
[1:32:56] does not agree then we won't get out of
[1:32:57] Harbor he said but until that does it
[1:33:00] won't work he said see if God the
[1:33:03] subconscious and conscience is agreed
[1:33:05] then something is going to move amen
[1:33:08] something is going to move are y'all
[1:33:11] hearing me amen Jesus was the son of God
[1:33:15] he did nothing but what the father
[1:33:17] showed him so the father showed him the
[1:33:20] immitance man and Jesus manifested the
[1:33:24] orders of the father and the omnipotent
[1:33:26] man got up and took his bed and walked
[1:33:29] home as a
[1:33:31] manifestation of the harmony between the
[1:33:34] father and the
[1:33:36] son now brother says in you is God right
[1:33:39] you have the Holy Ghost God is in you
[1:33:44] let me show you then the weakness of the
[1:33:45] church now can I can I have a few
[1:33:47] minutes in closing here take your time
[1:33:49] he said let me show you the weakness of
[1:33:51] the church y'all remember Paul in the
[1:33:53] Bible received a vision and the vision
[1:33:56] said you'll stand before Caesar it was a
[1:33:59] heavenly vision in the vision it said
[1:34:01] you're going to be Shipwrecked now watch
[1:34:04] God promised Paul by a heavenly vision
[1:34:07] he was going to a certain destination
[1:34:10] now Paul was Shipwrecked and he got on
[1:34:12] an island and he was gathering some wood
[1:34:15] oh God glory and when he gathered the
[1:34:17] wood there was a serpent that come up
[1:34:20] out of the wood that's right am and bit
[1:34:22] him now these serpents were so deadly
[1:34:25] that the minute they bit you you would
[1:34:27] be dead within a minute or two minutes
[1:34:30] that's right A M go ahead would be so
[1:34:33] powerful that it would bite you and you
[1:34:36] would be dead within a minute goad thank
[1:34:38] you brother Steven it was a Mamba yes
[1:34:40] sir so he was bitten by a Mamba to kill
[1:34:43] him watch what the prophet said and the
[1:34:46] native said he escaped the storm but he
[1:34:49] won't escape the serpent go ahead other
[1:34:51] words he escaped the false church but he
[1:34:53] won't escape this situation he escaped
[1:34:56] that but he won't escape this oh but if
[1:34:59] you got God if you got the anointing in
[1:35:03] your soul if he escape the strip wreck
[1:35:06] if he escape the serpent he'll make it
[1:35:09] to the certain
[1:35:14] destination are you hearing me so Paul
[1:35:17] grabs a piece of wood a serpent comes up
[1:35:21] and es onto his arm and he's standing
[1:35:24] there with a serpent with a Mamba
[1:35:26] hanging on his
[1:35:30] arm and there's people standing there
[1:35:32] saying any minute he's going to die uh
[1:35:34] any minute he's going to die any minute
[1:35:36] he's going to kill over any minute
[1:35:38] they're going to quit any minute they're
[1:35:40] going to give up any minute they're
[1:35:41] going to quit believing let's see how
[1:35:44] long they going to hold on so Paul just
[1:35:47] stood there and after a while brother
[1:35:51] said this the subconscious amen amen was
[1:35:55] in agreement with this am the conscience
[1:35:58] and both of them was in agreement with
[1:36:01] God and the Bible said they shall take
[1:36:04] up serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:36:07] thing it shall not harm
[1:36:11] them brother said Paul just went over
[1:36:14] there and he shaken off from the
[1:36:16] fire I could preach here for an hour
[1:36:19] Church Living God it's time to get up
[1:36:22] it's time to go over and shake it off
[1:36:26] it's time to shake it
[1:36:28] off come on brother said the Holy Ghost
[1:36:31] in Paul he said his body was so full of
[1:36:33] the spirit as much as it was of the
[1:36:36] blood that the Venom of the serpent did
[1:36:40] not even affect Paul
[1:36:43] amen because he was in harmony with God
[1:36:46] the Venom of the serpent could not
[1:36:50] affect the life of Paul
[1:36:53] amen met the success now yes my brother
[1:36:57] now you all know I'm telling the truth
[1:36:59] take your time because the power of
[1:37:02] Harmony amen amen amen is when when many
[1:37:05] parts amen come into one part amen amen
[1:37:08] can I say it to you like this harmony
[1:37:12] requires more than one string amen amen
[1:37:14] amen in other words Harmony requ I'm
[1:37:17] going to close on this take your time
[1:37:18] requires many parts amen amen amen
[1:37:22] anybody can sing a solo uh-huh
[1:37:26] uh-huh anybody can sing a
[1:37:29] solo but Harmony requires another part
[1:37:33] amen amen you all know the pro of God
[1:37:35] said in the last days he said God's got
[1:37:38] a great Symphony amen he
[1:37:40] said amen amen you know what he said he
[1:37:43] said he's got three parts he's got the
[1:37:46] composer he's got the director then he's
[1:37:49] got the musicians all three must come
[1:37:53] into agreement and receive the spirit of
[1:37:56] the composure now come on because what
[1:37:59] does a symphony do he said like Peter
[1:38:02] and the Wolf he said there's not little
[1:38:03] woodpeckers flying around in wolves he
[1:38:06] said the music oh God he said the music
[1:38:10] creates the atmosphere and the symphony
[1:38:12] makes the music a reality in other words
[1:38:16] when they all get in the same key they
[1:38:19] all get in the same cord they all get in
[1:38:21] the same Spirit then Harmony comes in
[1:38:25] and harmony can take a piece of sheet
[1:38:27] music and transfer it into reality amen
[1:38:31] amen amen amen can I can I give y'all
[1:38:34] just a just a simple just a simple
[1:38:36] little illustration take your time I'm
[1:38:38] not very I'm not musically inclined okay
[1:38:41] I know that okay but I was in music in
[1:38:44] high school middle school I played the
[1:38:46] trumpet now in the in the Middle School
[1:38:48] band we had the sixth grade band and we
[1:38:50] had the seventh and eighth grade concert
[1:38:51] band in that seventh eighth grade
[1:38:54] concert band when you when you left
[1:38:56] sixth grade you went in there you begin
[1:38:57] to play together so I was in seventh
[1:39:00] grade playing in seventh eighth grade

[1:39:11] music and it was a song called The Carol
[1:39:14] I think it was Carol the bells or
[1:39:15] something like that and he put it on the
[1:39:17] on the on the music stand and he said
[1:39:18] here's your concert music when I looked
[1:39:21] at it I automatically knew that there
[1:39:23] was something different about that than
[1:39:25] anything I'd ever seen so we begin to
[1:39:27] play it well brother Stephen brother Mr
[1:39:29] Brown was my director but I had a I had
[1:39:32] a private
[1:39:34] instructor so on Tuesdays and Thursdays
[1:39:37] I would go to private instruction
[1:39:38] lessons and then I would go back to
[1:39:40] church I mean go back to the
[1:39:43] band I'd go back to concert band and we
[1:39:46] would play so one day I go in for
[1:39:48] lessons and sister zy I'm sitting there
[1:39:50] and the direct or the the instructor he
[1:39:52] says what do you want to do today I said

[1:40:17] to do I'm going to in other words I'm
[1:40:19] going to dumb it down I'm going to
[1:40:21] rewrite some parts of it it'll make it
[1:40:24] more easy for you to play the problem

[1:40:28] concert band rehearsal and we all
[1:40:31] started playing Mr Brown stopped and
[1:40:34] said something's off somewhere that's it
[1:40:37] that's it that's it so I just kind of
[1:40:40] sat there you know and I didn't look
[1:40:42] around I didn't make no motions and he
[1:40:44] said let's try it again so he got the
[1:40:46] stick up and he began to direct and he
[1:40:49] stopped again he said something off
[1:40:51] somewhere something's off somewhere I
[1:40:54] said no I said no really he said yeah
[1:40:57] something's off somewhere so he says

[1:41:00] we put our instruments down and brother
[1:41:01] Stephen he comes walking through looking
[1:41:03] at everybody's music and he comes to
[1:41:05] mine I'm thinking dear Lord don't let
[1:41:07] him look don't let him look and he looks
[1:41:09] at it and he says it's you I said me he
[1:41:11] said yeah I said no way he said
[1:41:14] yeah he looks at the Sheep music he
[1:41:18] looks at the Sheep music

[1:41:29] somebody has added Parts in here that I
[1:41:32] did not put in there so you're playing
[1:41:35] added parts and the whole thing is out
[1:41:38] of rhythm the whole key is Out Of
[1:41:41] Tune come on church I looked at him I
[1:41:44] said well Mr Brown my instructor he said
[1:41:47] he's an instructor I'm the
[1:41:49] director
[1:41:53] ahen the instructor didn't have the
[1:41:56] spirit of the composure he said listen
[1:41:59] Mr he said listen here Andrew he said I
[1:42:02] want to know why he done this I said Mr
[1:42:04] Brown it's too hard I'm closing on this
[1:42:06] he said Mr I said Mr Brown it's too hard
[1:42:09] I cannot play that he told me it was too
[1:42:11] hard it was above my level he said
[1:42:14] Andrew I gave you that music he said
[1:42:16] because I know inside of you is the
[1:42:19] potentials to play it
[1:42:21] no know I know the potentials is in you
[1:42:25] to play something harder come on church
[1:42:28] we had played the first pole we had
[1:42:30] played the second pole but it was time
[1:42:33] for somebody to get in line with a
[1:42:35] composure to get in line with the
[1:42:37] director and receive the same spirit and
[1:42:40] they would all be playing the same part
[1:42:43] amen can I say it like this the composer
[1:42:46] comes into the director and the director
[1:42:48] comes into the musicians in other words
[1:42:50] words the prophet the spirit the prophet
[1:42:54] and the bride will all be saying the
[1:42:57] same thing
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:01] amen
[1:43:03] Harmony has been
[1:43:06] restored now can I ask you this and I'm
[1:43:10] done Harmony yes sir requires more than
[1:43:13] one part am Amen in other words the
[1:43:17] walls of Jericho are tall the walls of
[1:43:20] Jericho are wide the walls of Jericho
[1:43:24] are very strong very strong you can live
[1:43:27] on them you can race chariots on them
[1:43:30] they're they're there but they got to
[1:43:32] come
[1:43:35] down can I say this but a solo ain't
[1:43:38] going to do
[1:43:42] it testing one two testing a solo ain't
[1:43:47] going to do it and we've had a lot of
[1:43:50] solo around this message they've sang
[1:43:53] Return Ministry they've sang seven
[1:43:55] Thunders they've sang perusia they've
[1:43:57] sang Two Souls they sung all kinds of
[1:44:00] things amen but the walls are still
[1:44:02] standing because a solo ain't going to
[1:44:05] bring the walls down it's going to take
[1:44:08] a
[1:44:11] symphony brother Steven the walls are
[1:44:13] there so one person let's go March
[1:44:15] around them okay one person March around
[1:44:18] them brother brandom said I'm going to
[1:44:20] interpret it for you you don't need the
[1:44:21] quot you just need me you don't need
[1:44:23] what them tapes say you just need me I'm
[1:44:26] going to bring them walls down and the
[1:44:28] walls are still standing that's exactly
[1:44:30] but in the end time the composure came
[1:44:34] down to the director and the director
[1:44:36] picked up the stick and said we're going
[1:44:38] to March around these walls seven
[1:44:42] times we are going to March around these
[1:44:44] walls seven times and on the seventh
[1:44:47] time we're going to let out a shout in
[1:44:50] other words there ain't enough power in
[1:44:52] one voice there ain't enough power in
[1:44:54] two voices but when all the voices come
[1:44:57] back into Harmony and they begin to
[1:45:00] sound out the shout the walls are going
[1:45:03] to come down well Church we've got to
[1:45:05] shout and the shout is the
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:14] message and if we can all say the same
[1:45:17] thing the walls are coming down let our
[1:45:22] musicians come
[1:45:25] tonight oh I didn't you all forgive
[1:45:31] me the word of
[1:45:34] God is a great
[1:45:37] Symphony now can I say this to you
[1:45:41] brother said watch he said if you don't
[1:45:44] understand the symphony it's a big bunch
[1:45:46] of Racket to
[1:45:48] you if you don't understand the symphony
[1:45:51] it's a big bunch of Racket it's all done
[1:45:54] by signs and motions but it acts out of
[1:45:56] drama in the symphony the only one that
[1:45:59] understands a symphony is the
[1:46:02] composure and those who are interested
[1:46:05] in knowing
[1:46:07] it they know its changes they know what
[1:46:11] takes
[1:46:13] place now brother BM says it very
[1:46:15] beautiful he says the Sheep music is not
[1:46:18] going to give an uncertain
[1:46:22] sound he said the seventh Angel's
[1:46:24] message is going to be a certain sound
[1:46:26] right right the genuine revelation will
[1:46:29] be made known made perfect in that
[1:46:32] sounding so there is the spirit in the
[1:46:35] last days and it's the spirit of God and
[1:46:38] what it's doing is it's bringing us back
[1:46:40] in tune because the composer the
[1:46:43] director must be in the same spirit and
[1:46:46] so must the
[1:46:48] musicians be in the same SP Spirit see
[1:46:52] God's Bible and a Believer will come
[1:46:58] together am amen amen amen can I say it
[1:47:03] to you like this the prophet of God said
[1:47:06] there was an auction one
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:09] time he said and they went in there and
[1:47:11] there was a violin over in the
[1:47:14] corner he said the the auctioner went
[1:47:16] over and picked up the violin it was
[1:47:18] Dusty had scars cobwebs Out Of Tune he
[1:47:22] held up the violin and he said who will
[1:47:24] give me a dollar who'll give me a dollar
[1:47:27] who will give me a dollar nobody
[1:47:31] bid who give me $2 said finally somebody
[1:47:33] said I'll give you two he said finally
[1:47:36] there was a man standing in the back so
[1:47:38] there was a man
[1:47:40] there there was a man there that could
[1:47:42] turn on the
[1:47:43] light there was a man there that said
[1:47:46] that shouldn't be sold for that amount
[1:47:48] so he went up there and he picked up the
[1:47:52] violin he dusted it off he tuned it up
[1:47:57] laid it on his shoulder got a bow and
[1:48:01] rosined up the bow and began to play one
[1:48:03] of the most beautiful sounds you ever
[1:48:05] heard but remember when he got done
[1:48:07] playing they said 2,000 5,000 10,000 he
[1:48:10] said what was it the Master's Hand
[1:48:13] revealed what was veiled in the old
[1:48:17] instrument can I say this to you he
[1:48:19] didn't put the music in it the music was
[1:48:23] already in it it just needed somebody to
[1:48:27] reveal it to unveil it and to bring it
[1:48:30] out so the pro of God said and today the
[1:48:32] word of God is laying on a
[1:48:34] denominational auction he said what are
[1:48:37] they doing he said they're bidding it
[1:48:38] away for anything he said oh but may God
[1:48:41] step forth surely and send that Prophet
[1:48:43] that'll pick up the bow you know what
[1:48:45] the bow is amen the bow is the
[1:48:49] believer the violin is the word the bow
[1:48:53] is the believer and he said can't you
[1:48:55] hear the Master's violin pull across the
[1:48:58] bow across the word he's the same
[1:49:02] yesterday
[1:49:04] today and forever won't you stand your
[1:49:07] feet with us
[1:49:09] tonight what are you saying brother
[1:49:11] Andrew I'm saying we're
[1:49:15] not manhandling this
[1:49:19] word We're In Harmony amen amen
[1:49:28] now y'all forgive me here take your time
[1:49:32] right but every
[1:49:35] spirit that confesseth not Jesus Christ
[1:49:38] is the Son of God and has come in the
[1:49:40] flesh is of the Antichrist amen amen and
[1:49:45] the Bible said there are many Antichrist
[1:49:47] right that have gone out into the world
[1:49:50] that's exactly
[1:49:52] right y'all forgive me take your time
[1:49:56] but they're passing out their own sheet
[1:49:57] music that's exactly right that's
[1:50:01] exactly right they're taking the sheet
[1:50:03] music and hacking here and cutting there
[1:50:05] and adding here and place in there and
[1:50:06] put that's why mess and now we got
[1:50:10] people trying to lead the
[1:50:13] symphony with the wrong sheet and one's
[1:50:16] playing this and one's playing that and
[1:50:18] brother so and so said this and brother
[1:50:19] so and said
[1:50:24] this but when Jesus got Stern is when it
[1:50:27] come to truth and
[1:50:29] error and everything that interfered
[1:50:32] with a Harmony he drew the
[1:50:36] line it now y'all forgive me cuz it's an
[1:50:39] age of Technology take your Liberty it's
[1:50:42] an age of it's an age of Technology
[1:50:44] crazy and Co put everybody on the
[1:50:47] internet that's exactly right every
[1:50:48] church every Ministry every preacher
[1:50:50] every direction everybody's out there
[1:50:53] and so you now what you know what we got
[1:50:54] happening now is we got people listening
[1:50:56] to this preacher here and that preacher
[1:50:58] there and this preacher there and this
[1:51:00] one's correct in this one and that one's
[1:51:02] correct in that
[1:51:03] one Spirit come on that's exactly right
[1:51:08] and what they're doing is bringing a
[1:51:09] different sound to the Sheep music
[1:51:11] exactly right so the Sheep music said
[1:51:14] there would be greater works well this
[1:51:16] guy said no that's just for brother
[1:51:17] brandom so he changed the sheet music
[1:51:20] that's right that's exactly right and
[1:51:23] now Jehovah comes in the midst of his
[1:51:25] bride and wants to sing a song and all
[1:51:27] the musicans are Out Of Tune that's
[1:51:29] exactly right can I can I get y'all do

[1:52:43] spirits so if he can get the musicians
[1:52:46] on different notes and different songs
[1:52:48] and different Tunes the devil has a
[1:52:51] stronghold in the church but when
[1:52:53] Harmony is restored and the sound of the
[1:52:56] cords Blends into one it begins to push
[1:52:59] out evil spirits what about it church we
[1:53:02] are the musicians of the message of the
[1:53:05] hour and as long as the devil's God is
[1:53:07] playing our own songs singing our own
[1:53:09] Keys playing our own Tunes in Rhythm out
[1:53:12] of rhythm in harmony out of Harmony the
[1:53:14] devil has a
[1:53:16] stronghold but when we come under the

[1:56:48] Church
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:56] hall hallelujah can you give me more
[1:57:00] volume my
[1:57:02] brother just increase the volume because
[1:57:05] of my
[1:57:06] voice amen

[1:57:14] clear somebody need to draw the line
[1:57:18] somewhere
[1:57:20] amen I'm going to read couple quotes of
[1:57:23] brother Bram this is what I felt led to
[1:57:27] and I'm going to read
[1:57:28] him
[1:57:30] amen glory to God
[1:57:34] hallelujah
[1:57:36] hallelujah thank you
[1:57:38] Jesus
[1:57:40] Hallelujah brother brandham say you hang
[1:57:43] your
[1:57:44] heart with somebody that is a
[1:57:48] thief I'm going to put this in the
[1:57:50] church group
[1:57:51] chat you shall be a thief
[1:57:55] yourself do you know how I know that
[1:57:58] your Association is wrong it's when I
[1:58:02] watch you the way you behave the way you
[1:58:05] groom yourself the way you keep your
[1:58:07] nail and all this kind of stuff I know
[1:58:10] exactly that you're
[1:58:11] drifting because the scripture says that
[1:58:15] evil
[1:58:17] communication corrupt what
[1:58:20] he didn't say that good manners will
[1:58:23] influence the evil communication so you
[1:58:26] can't beat the
[1:58:27] scripture so if you hang out with
[1:58:29] somebody in the message that is not
[1:58:32] solid don't worry that person will
[1:58:34] influence you in the wrong way you can't
[1:58:37] beat the
[1:58:38] scripture Amen brother brandham says
[1:58:42] glory to God he says that you hang
[1:58:46] around with somebody that is a thief you
[1:58:49] be be a thief yourself my old kentaki M
[1:58:52] used to say you lay down with a dog
[1:58:55] that's got fleas you get up with fleas
[1:58:59] too you take you take a woman that is no
[1:59:03] good a girl and put her with a good
[1:59:06] decent boy and the first thing you know
[1:59:10] he is as honary as a Pap turn it right
[1:59:15] vice versa you are known by your company
[1:59:20] amen segregate yourself in other words
[1:59:23] separate yourself I'm not talking about
[1:59:26] separating from the people outside the
[1:59:29] message even somebody who is in this
[1:59:32] message and who's compromising and the
[1:59:35] more you stick with that person that
[1:59:37] person is bringing you down instead of
[1:59:39] you going up you need to draw the line
[1:59:42] that's why I stand the way I stand in
[1:59:44] this church when it comes to the word no
[1:59:48] matter what you do even if I lose anyone
[1:59:51] I will stand with the word because if
[1:59:53] you compromise and that person be
[1:59:56] visited by the Lord later on that person
[1:59:59] will look at you like a hypocrite I tell
[2:00:02] people if your friend is drifting away
[2:00:05] you stand with the word because they
[2:00:08] don't understand at that time but when
[2:00:10] they understand they will love you more
[2:00:13] but what we do we have our own uh
[2:00:15] message love oh let's show love let's
[2:00:18] show love before you know it you're the
[2:00:20] one being drifted brother Branham say
[2:00:23] segregate yourself I'm just reading
[2:00:25] brother Bram he say segregate yourself
[2:00:28] come out from among them and the Bible
[2:00:31] say be ye separated that's right the
[2:00:34] second one brother Bram say Samson got
[2:00:38] into Bad Company and you always can
[2:00:42] remember that when you are in the Bad
[2:00:45] Company you are out of the will of the
[2:00:48] Lord
[2:00:49] my old southern mommy used to tell me if
[2:00:52] you lay down with a dog that's got fleas
[2:00:55] you get up with the fleas that's rather
[2:00:58] a rude expression but it's got a lot of
[2:01:00] common everyday sense to it you just
[2:01:03] can't associate yourself with the things
[2:01:06] of the world except to stay spirit and
[2:01:09] and expect to stay spiritual and humble
[2:01:12] before the Lord it won't happen that's
[2:01:15] why we
[2:01:17] struggle if the Lord and just understand
[2:01:21] this as much as we are here together as
[2:01:24] a church God deals with you
[2:01:28] individually so if God give you the
[2:01:31] Revelation onto something do it don't
[2:01:34] look at the other person don't wait for
[2:01:36] everybody to be going at the same
[2:01:39] time because this one will be today the
[2:01:42] other person will be maybe two three
[2:01:44] month down the road you move on with the
[2:01:46] Lord that's it that's it Church it is
[2:01:49] the matter of life and death draw the
[2:01:52] line I've been hanging around with this
[2:01:55] person look at the way I'm grooming my
[2:01:57] hair look at the way my high heel are
[2:02:00] but we already been preaching about high
[2:02:01] heel why are you still struggling with
[2:02:03] it it's because of the company you're
[2:02:05] going
[2:02:06] with amen you will say brother Stephen
[2:02:10] you keep coming back on this thing all
[2:02:11] the time I will sit down and draw the
[2:02:14] line I love you but I have to draw the
[2:02:16] line when it come to the word of God
[2:02:19] amen remove
[2:02:21] jealousy work together in harmony if God
[2:02:24] is blessing
[2:02:26] somebody don't attack
[2:02:28] it because God can choose one and out of
[2:02:32] that one he's going to bring everybody
[2:02:34] there if you start fighting it you can
[2:02:38] fight your own
[2:02:39] blessing because you think you should be
[2:02:41] in that place but God didn't see you
[2:02:45] there amen amen just like he showed here
[2:02:49] every musician in this spot let's work
[2:02:52] with Harmony the main thing we come in
[2:02:54] the church is about the word of God
[2:02:57] Church draw the line don't play game
[2:03:00] you're going to pick up
[2:03:03] Spirit oh we going to lunch you're going
[2:03:05] to pick up
[2:03:07] spirit amen Lord's willing because I
[2:03:11] know this step there is an N octave that
[2:03:14] God is taking this church the problem is
[2:03:17] there is an identity Crist
[2:03:20] where we don't know the value the
[2:03:23] caliber that God put in us that's why we
[2:03:26] follow
[2:03:27] people that's why young people are
[2:03:29] following this and following this
[2:03:31] because they don't know themselves up
[2:03:33] but let the master play the violin and
[2:03:36] you're going to realize what kind of
[2:03:38] caliber you
[2:03:39] are amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
