how many people love the food I'm sorry if you had a legitimate reason but if you miss it you miss the natural food and the spiritual food amen glory to God remember brother Abel and sister Destiny in prayer I just saw his text this morning so there has been uh battling in the body so I believe he's streaming by God's grace so just keep him in prayer and I believe the Lord will touch them and heal them amen we receive an invitation about a youth banquet with brother Joe Greene he malaged the program and everything and there is a form that needs to be filled out so if you're interested about

needed to be done it's a Ruth afford I believe brother Joe Green you know brother Joe Green he preached for us here so Lord's willing just keep the meeting in prayer and everything will be okay amen there was something I want to touch quickly for the sake of the church then we go straight to our scripture uh there was a question that was brought up to me before the meeting and yesterday he was brought up again about the difference between the Goga Magog in the Old Testament and the Gog and Magog in the New Testament I know some of you were not there we went in detail yesterday but uh for the sake of the church I know some didn't show up for legitimate reason so let me just touch base quickly and everything will be okay amen we have to go get Magog in the scripture amen we have Gog and Magog in the Old Testament amen you go to the Old Testament it's in Ezekiel 38. and Ezekiel 39. amen and over there he says Gog in the land of Magog the chief Prince of meshech and tuba so that is talking about a prince amen a prince and a land amen and brother Branham explained to us in the court you can review back in the Sundays that that was Russian army do you remember and if you go to Ezekiel 38 and 39 you will see specifically that the scripture referred to the King of the North he's coming from the North like a storm which Daniel 11 say it's a whirlwind and it's going to be in the um in Israel or in Jerusalem that's where the battle will be amen this is the Old Testament Amen in the New Testament there is another God in Magog and the Gog in Magog in the New Testament have happened after the millennium you remember so I should hear more amen after the Thousand Year amen so to make it easy because I know people have a tendency let me see the code let me see the code and then you don't even understand brother Branham so to make it easy on you we have Gog and Magog one hey everybody okay and go get my dog too everybody okay just like we have world the world one World War Two and world war three those that were yesterday understand this quickly amen so we got Gog and Magog one which is in the Old Testament it's in Revelator it's in Ezekiel 38 and 39 and then in the New Testament we have God get Magog 2 which is in the Book of Revelation chapter 20. everybody okay everybody okay this is the New Testament this is the Old Testament everybody okay now go get Magog one in the New Testament everybody okay it is called Armageddon everybody okay now everybody okay if I miss you raise your hand you don't want to raise your hand I'm going to start it again hey everybody okay we got to go get my dog we got go again Magog in the Old Testament and goge Magog in the New Testament in the Old Testament it's Ezekiel 38 and Ezekiel 39 in the New Testament it's revelation 20. amen so that's go get Magog one and Gog and Magog 2 but in the New Testament Gog and Magog 1 is called Armageddon and it happened before the millennium everybody okay but go get Magog 2 happened after the millennium everybody okay so if you put the Millennium right here we have a Gog and Magog B4 and after everybody okay the God gave Magog before is your Armageddon which finished the tribulation period the girl get Magog after the Millennium is gogging Magog too which is Armageddon have the prisoners which is the Beast and the false prophet anybody okay and go again Magog too have only one prisoner which is the devil everybody okay so far everybody okay so far that's why if you can never miss question and answer if there is a possibility do the best never miss question and answer because yesterday was a review of everything we went through everybody okay so the prisoners here are the Beast and the false prophet and the Prisoner right here is the devil amen over here in Gog and Magog 1 which is the King of the North we have the Beast who is packing all the kings of the Earth we went through this and we got the King of the North which is Russia amen who's packing the kings of the East we went through that if you review yesterday amen so Russia is packing the king the Beast his cup is packing the king of the earth which is the Western world which is dealing with NATO amen which work with the United States England and everybody else over there everybody okay this is why you have war in Ukraine it is the Western and the Eastern that are bumping Gates together everybody okay and then over here the king of the East is taking part case um is taking care of the eastern part that's where you have China and everybody else that is working on the other side amen so these forces both of them will come toward Israel and then the lamb and his brother will come down to fight them and Destroy both of them everybody okay so quick review go get mad dog one and Gog and Magog two Gog and Magog one is called Armageddon he happened before the Millennium two prisoners the Beast and the false prophet and he gets the king of the earth under the Beast which is the Western world and the King of the North which is the king of the East which is taking care of the Eastern world this is where you have your crew chef and as an hour you remember that one from the East one from the West so when they are in Ukraine it is not really putting fighting with Ukraine it is the eastern and the Western that are fighting together so they are positionally pressing themselves before the third world happened which is Armageddon but it won't happen if I'm here you need to put yourself it will happen if I'm here there is no atomic bomb that will be dropped on this planet if I am here as long as you see me there won't be no atomic bomb Putin can say all he wants he can threaten all he wants he's under prophecy Jesus told uh uh what is his name palate that you have no power offer me except it's been given to you no power everybody okay everybody good so whoever was confused you got your stuff clear you see how much God loves you amen amen glory to God my computer is not connected amen I know it is not you I know who's fighting came this morning the computer need to restart and everything if you don't know what it means war I don't know how to explain to you amen do the best that you can we explained to you yesterday for those that was there make sure you don't remain here when the Rapture happened it won't be good amen so don't let nothing block you I don't see the screen so don't let anything block you do you want me to touch it it's already connected there amen so don't make sure you don't stay here let's go to Genesis chapter two I always have a backup in case he start trouble this means worry amen glory to God amen are you on Harry amen so you're not going to be watching your clock because sometimes someone put in pressure get me in pressure and then you come up with question again and you were the one pressurizing amen you wanted to go you wanted to go you wanted to go and then tomorrow you come up with a question what we're dealing with today we need to be careful and we need to go slowly it's a different language okay you might feel like uh what's going on really I know just relax everything will be okay okay you probably don't hear that too much maybe you heard it before but it's a different language it's in the Bible it's nothing new it's in the message okay and if you struggle understanding this message what is really the purpose of this message you're going to understand it today so give me time let me take off on the military aircraft everybody okay that's why the devil is fighting okay you will understand things a little bit different Genesis chapter 2 wonderful can I raise the board a little bit can you give me Grace please because I'm dealing with the bread of Jesus Christ must make sure I don't upset them God now is dealing with a different I was telling a brother yesterday I said the ministry God is using now I'm not the only one I'm just among them amen God is using the backup Ministry we have nothing to build an Empire you have nothing to build a big clicks or a big Bishop our motives is one pull the word bring the word as much as we can get to the elect and let the elect get the word of God and connect with the maker and we go amen so all the the the the the clicks or all the denomination that have blocked the people in the message God opened his streaming lines of preachers they might not be in that church but they are sucking the word from where they are and you will find out you will meet people that believe exactly like you and you will realize they were following the same sermon like you everybody okay let me try this thing here because there is far away oh it's far far far yeah it's working but your hand will be tired my brother what's wrong here it's not connected let's go to Genesis chapter two it'd be okay there is nothing educated God Genesis 2 verse 18. very familiar and the Lord God said it is not good we apologize for the delay you who is uh who are streaming online we were working we had a technical issue here but everything is okay so everybody online God richly bless you where you are God bless you we part of the same family amen Hallelujah and the Lord God say it is not good that man should be what amen I will make him a you see how we start we back up again on the surface if you start checking your life and begin to clean up things on your life by the time we hit the baptism of the Holy Spirit if you don't have it you will get it so don't let anything in your life blocking you be like Brother Carlos usually say be brutally sincere with yourself make sure make sure you put you take yourself you put yourself on the chair and you sit down you say you you have pride okay you need to get it out talk to yourself you you have a problem of this if you do that by the time I get to the baptism of the Holy Spirit you will be rolling on this floor but if you want to hold your high heel or your whatever you want to hold on that's your problem or your temper or you say I have the baptism of the Holy Spirit even if your life is not really the word stop burning don't listen all kind of stuff the holy spirit will cross here and you will be left with your religious churchanity all the time so I'm just telling you do the best you can clean up if you need to talk to me see me do you understand what I'm saying you can't fight this battle without the Holy Ghost okay the Holy Ghost is not your Holy Ghost because message we believe they gave themselves the Holy Ghost and they don't live the life of God very very rude to their wives brutal to the wife and everything and still they have the Holy Ghost so make sure you take yourself out from inside open the door you say you come out sit on that chair there you know you have a problem the pastor say many times you don't listen tell him like that when you claim him up then you take him you say now we can get along together from now on make it make sure from this day forward from that time no more game I don't want to stay here in the tribulation because of you because you get me too much trouble when I want to go to church you the one that always come up with stuff that's fun this is not a church this is a homegoing Time you don't want to stay behind because the Holy Spirit doesn't tolerate longer he will be pleading pleading pleading pleading after a while that say he takes off and you will be fighting you will be you will be what fasting 40 days to find out Holy Ghost again okay so take whatever needs to be taken out be serious with God line up by the time we preach the gospel you will see the fire just before even I lay hands on you you will have it it is not complicated the Holy Ghost is never complicated when I would lay down the scripture you will begin to have the Holy Ghost yourself where you are there everybody okay everybody okay don't be afraid of it how can you be afraid of God amen it is not good that man should be alone verse 19 you might be seated and out of the ground the Lord God form every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them to who Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam call every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to ocado and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the film but for Adam there was what not found you got the microphone right praise God man you're in tune now glory to God Amen Brother John told him yesterday that you keep moving like that until the preacher struck you and then before you know it you start preaching the gospel so keep moving mama you okay right okay glory to your mama says she's okay okay amen first uh uh 20 but there was no fund a help meet for him in other words when God was creating things everybody okay everything was coming up too a pair two two two two two two and when you look at Adam Adam is just one so it was not good why is not good amen when God created the elephant he never created one elephant he created two the zebra too the dog too chicken too everything to only Adam why does Adam have to be created as one person why God made a mistake brother brother I'm saying now let it be known that scripture does not play with water words whatever is in the record in the Bible it's there for the anointed us to water see it is therefore a purpose keep that in mind job now to verse 21 and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and close up the flesh instead thereof so to create the help God never taken another material everybody okay when God created the zebra he created a male zebra and a female zebra but when God created man he created Adam now God said no no no no no no no no something is missing here Adam need the help everybody okay but to get the help of Adam amen the help of Adam was in Adam do you understand amen God have to open Adam like hey buddy sleep right here take Anastasia healing add them down say okay let me start with a surgery when he opened the surgery he searched down there he said there it is foreign what is this it's a rib a rib a rib what are you gonna do with this rib can I continue verse 20 to end the web which the Lord God has taken from who amen made he a water woman so the woman was inside the man in the form of a river whoa I told you it's a different language I told you it's a different language I know you you are still working like what is this trying to say I'm reading your Bible okay he met here a woman and brought her to water man so when God made this woman God didn't stop right there as soon as he made this woman he picked the woman quickly amen amen brought the woman back to me come on come on come on let's go let's go quick let's go quick God introduced something that was not there before it is called marriage marriage was not there before they were creating two people at a zebra go two two did you see God calling the first zebrae the second zebra and say sit down here I need to marry you did you see God doing that or he said you elephant the elephant come here I need to marry you dog hey before you go let me marry you did you see God doing that he only did that to the human everybody okay let's go to best friend interview and Adam say this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a woman because she was water taken out of a man it's a woo man w o man therefore shall man leave his water father and his water mother and shall cling to his water wife he doesn't say the woman men everybody okay and there shall be one everybody okay and they were both naked the man and his wife and was not what the reason why they were not ashamed because they have not met in the physical yet they didn't know what sex was God United them first but they were not United in the physical are you following me Adam and Eve were joined or were married in the spirit in the word only amen but they didn't go into the physical everybody okay so in between the marriage in the world and the physical the devil slipping everybody okay and destroy the marriage let's go to Ruth chapter two we back up on the surface body still in the audience glory to God Lord have mercy on me it's amazing how time is going quickly but it means to worry if you're there you can say Amen then say Boaz verse 8 to roof hear you my daughter go not to clean in another field you know this neither go from here but the bad here fast by the water made it so a roof was joined by the maiden so we got two categories of women the first category is the maiden amen and the second category is one woman called roof amen let your eyes be on the field that they do reap the maiden and go after them Havana charged the young men that they shall not touch you and when you are thirsty go to the vessels and drink of what the young men have done so somebody's working for her then she fell on her face and bowed out and bowed herself to the ground and say to him why have I found Grace in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me saying I am a stranger you remember yesterday we were all strangers out of the common health you remember yesterday okay and Boaz answered and say to her it is it has fully showed me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband and how you have left who thy father and your mother and the land of your Nativity who did that in the Bible who left his father his mother and his aha can you say who did that Abraham so Ruth behaved like who and yesterday we say Abraham was who father everybody okay he was Abraham which who was our new Adam you remember yesterday our new Adam because Abraham was the father of our faith I'm not saying Abraham was Adam you who are online I'm saying it's like a new Adam okay we have only two other the first Adam and the second who is Jesus Christ but we say here Adam because God started with Adam and a land the Garden of Eden when God destroy everything amen God picked up a new man Abraham and give him the land of Cana we have again a man and a land those that were yesterday you understand what I'm saying amen the father of our faith and this is the way wolf behave hey everybody okay and I'll come to the to a people which you knew not before the Lord recompass your words so to us to borrowers here it is work but truly it was what can you say louder face and works is what everybody okay we okay now so it was faith that was expressed by work everybody okay everybody okay so he said the Lord recompense in other words we watch reward your work and the Water full what is a fully so there is a partial reward but this reward Boaz say I want God to give you the full the complete reward what is that amen a full reward be given you of the Lord of Israel and the whose water wings thou have come to water trust so when she was moving like that she was entering the wings of Jehovah and we surrounded that the wings of Jehovah was the tabernacle if you need that scripture you see me everybody okay glory to God jump to verse 22. and Naomi said to roof her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go not out with his with his maidens that you go out with his Maiden that they meet you not in another field so keep fast by the maintenance of Boaz to glean to the end of water Harvest and of water wheat Harvest and dwell with her water mother so Ruth was working until the end of the Harvest so the work of roof was until the end of the Harvest that's when her work finished everybody okay let's go to chapter three verse one then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her after the Harvest is finished there is no more job for roof the work is finished now roof is sitting at home waking up in the morning washing dishes cooking and they sit with Naomi they watch each other now let me look you say this is not good it is not good you had some activity but now it is not good it is not good for you to be like this everybody okay I hope you see what I'm saying over there it was not good for Adam to be alone okay now it's picking up okay [Music] shall I not seek water rest what is rest everybody okay so Naomi said you need to rest was she not sleeping I thought she stopped working so she's now resting that was not the rest the rest means something else shall not seek rest for you that he may be well with you and now is not Bowers of our water Kendrick so the rest is connected to marriage it is connected to a man everybody okay the rest is connected to a man and that man in particular here is Boaz everybody okay bow has our children with whose water maidens there were other women already there beside the roof amen who with whose Maiden you were behold he we knoweth badly tonight in the water the Russian floor stop we are no longer in the field of Boaz everybody okay this work here of roof was in the field of Boaz anybody okay now we move from the field into a place called what we already went through this amen but what I want you to see is in the field of Boaz roof was working are you following me but everybody okay in the dressing floor who is doing the work are we okay do you see roof working there in the dressing floor it is boys doing the work normal roof and Naomi told her when you go there I don't want you to work you just need to go there and just sleep you sleep everybody okay jump to verse uh eight and he came to pass a war time midnight does it bring the bed and midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a water woman lay where at his feet and he said who are you and she answered I am roof your hand man do what spread spread their food that scared to offer you hence meant for you are the nearest water Kingsman everybody okay let's go to Ephesians 5 then we pray in Genesis he was about what marriage in roof he was about what in Ephesians 5 what do you think it's about stretch it's so easy let's go Ephesians 5 verse 23. for the husband is the water of the wife even as Christ is the head of the water church so now Paul is using the natural man and the spiritual man everybody okay there has been the first husband that was the head of the wife was Adam When sin entered God changed the Covenant and he said your husband shall be shall rule over you everybody okay so Paul here is using the natural man amen and the spiritual man he said in the natural man the man is the head of the wife everybody okay but spiritually speaking he says the head in the spiritual is Christ and the wife of Christ is who the church amen he said for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the what church and he is the savior of the water body the body is water this church is also called what the body if you need more scripture on that you see me it's in Colossians 1 18 and 23 424 if I'm not mistaken job to verse 28. everybody okay so ought to men to love the water wives as their own bodies do you understand that so the body of a Man Too is a wife am I reading a different Bible you know sometimes when you look at me I wonder if I'm reading a different Bible everybody okay so ought men to love their wife as their own body so that so he that loves his wife loves water himself oh so if you love your wife you are loving yourself what does it mean so when I love sister Sharon I'm loving myself what does he need if I treat her bad I'm treating myself how bad I wish I can talk to married people when you are talking to your wife you don't talk to me like this you don't know who you're talking to that's why you're talking the way you talking because in your mind you're thinking you're talking to somebody else I wish I can have married people separate I lock that door and lock this door and handle them [Music] don't talk to me like that shut up who you shot in your mouth your daughter foreign can I continue can I continue can I continue yes sir the brothers that will marry the sister will have a hard time they need to make sure they got the Holy Ghost [Music] say this marriage is not fun no it's just you didn't have the Holy Ghost everybody okay what is coming up is different let me leave it alone let's go 29 for no man ever headed his own what but he does what nourishes it and do whatever you want to wear a good suit and that and that woman goes to Salvation Army let me leave it alone we handle the man with people later everybody okay even as the Lord the Water Church for we are members of his water body so this church have many members but all those members are we are members of men of his body of his flesh and of his water bones what does he remind you in other words we are flesh of his flesh and water bounds of his bones everybody okay where did you see that Genesis everybody okay now verse uh 31 for discourse shall man leave his water father and mother and shall join to his what wife and the two shall be watered one flesh why did Paul get this and he's applying that to who so if Adam was in Genesis this one his name must be also water everybody okay so we got two atoms there everybody okay verse 32 this is a water mysterious you don't like Mysteries that's why you got trouble in marriages everybody okay this is a water greatness it is not just a mystery it's a big one a great mystery what is that great mystery but I speak concerning who the church Christ and who the church Christine the church is a big it's a great mystery what is this mystery So when you say Christ and the church it's a great mystery what is that misreading can you tell me can I remind you something amen and then we take off but uh the Bible says this that moreover the light of the moon shall be as Delight of the water son Moon wife son husband but the light of this Moon must be equal to the light of the Sun in other words this moon was not equal to the Sun but at the certain level it will become equal and the light of the sun shall be how much Sevenfold So this sun if it's time seven this Moon must be what psalm 7. everybody okay as the light of how many days seven days in that day that the Lord bandeth the breach of his people and he left the stroke of the water wounds we already explained you that let's go ahead and turn to Matthew 25. and then we pray now buckle up and let's take off it's not a commercial airplane it's a military one okay okay you ready we're ready Matthew 25 let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for this new science system that we

come and speak to this congregation we rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place and commit it all unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody okay my subject this morning so it helped me with this computer my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the groom's Oiler Karma the mystery of man what is a man let me repeat it again my subject this morning is the groom's oil the mystery of what man what is a man foreign you've seen them walking all around you have them they call them your husband or somebody call them my father or my grandpa what is a man everybody okay we are back up on the surface in the trashing floor and we are dealing with the second oil and I'm gonna get into this oil in more detail Lord help me with this everybody okay as we're moving back to our Tabernacle we found out that we are in the holiest no more deeper we back up on the surface everybody okay now when we spoke about roof we found out that when roof was coming back into Bethlehem the scripture says this in Ruth chapter 1 verse 22 that so Naomi returned and roof the more about us her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and the Bible said that they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley water Harvest so when roof returned the Harvest was already on when we talk about Harvest we need to be careful how we applying the word Harvest the Bible said in the Book of Matthew chapter 9 that but when he saw Jesus demultited he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then say he unto his disciple the Harvest truly is water plentiful when Jesus was here Jesus already looked at the field in the Harvest but usually when we talk about the Harvest we're looking at the Harvest as the end time what is going on he said but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth labors into the water Harvest so when Jesus was here the Harvest was already on everybody okay John chapter 4 verse 35 say ye not say not ye they are yet four months and then cometh what the Harvest behold I say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the water fields for they are white already to what Harvest roof went back in the beginning of what when the field were already White but it was not the time yet to pick up roof she had to go through a process everybody okay even though Jesus say that the field were already ripe that their Harvest so is ready that was not really the Harvest I'm going slowly in Matthew Chapter 13 in the parable verse 39 Jesus said the enemy that showed them is the devil the Harvest is water so we got to harvest anybody okay we got the Harvest that Jesus stated I was already ripe he just need the leverage to go and we got there Harvest of the Harvest everybody okay we got the Harvest off the Harvest everybody okay this is a harvest but this is the Harvest of the Harvest in other words it is the end of the Harvest so there is a beginning of Jarvis and the ending of water let's go to first John chapter 2. keep Matthew 20 5. glory to God first John chapter 2 verse 28. how many believe we are in the last day let me see your hand how many believe we are on the last Church age how many believe we are allowed so the last day is us but let's read this first John chapter 2 verse 28 if you dare you can say Amen at Verse 18 I'm sorry first John chapter 2 verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen who's talking here what is the name of the disciple is John somebody who is in this time no John was one of the Disciples of Jesus Christ everybody okay he was the last one that remained and wrote the Book of Revelation is John alive today let's see what John's saying at that time this is what John is saying if you work last night or something Shake Yourself okay you can be the only one doing this everybody okay Verse 18 leader children if not I will hand you the microphone too I'm not my brother here but I'm saying to keep you alive everybody okay little children it is the water last time stop was the last time over there are you okay yes sir it is the last time and as you have heard the Antichrist shall come even now are there many water Antichrist whereby we know that it is the water so at that time John called the time of the gentle the last time so there is a last time and the last time of the last time everybody okay because remember that there were 70 weeks for those that were yesterday that were determined for the Jewish everybody okay every single week was already fulfilled there was only one week that was remaining everybody okay so when that week was coming out that was the last time everybody okay everybody okay and he only takes seven years but for some reason in the middle of the week which is three and a half year you remember yesterday God pushed the break because the world could have ended there everybody okay remember yesterday God pushed the break right there and opened the gentle dispensation so the gentle dispossession started at the end of the Jewish dispensation that's why you need to come everybody okay everybody okay the end of the Jewish dispensation was there when Jesus Christ came that's why brother Branham say Israel have seven churches just as the nation have seven churches when Jesus Christ came Jesus came at the last age of the Jewish dispensation everything should have been closed and Armageddon should have taken place [Applause] everybody okay so when they begin to consume the last week of Daniel at three and a half year which is the midst of the week everything stopped because there is a roof that is not picked up yet everybody okay it was the last time he was the Harvest the field was already ripe but it was not the end timer everybody okay you remember yesterday so God begin to work with the Jew with the Gentile until the LA odisha which is the end time of the Gentile did I lost anybody praise God everybody okay and the Bible said that the reapers are The Water Angels and we found out that when roof came roof began to label and she was Levering under the reaper which are the Angels and we know that throughout the seven Church ages we have seven angels which are seven weepers and Ruth was picking up two food everybody okay there was a food that roof have to work for yes herself everybody okay and pick the food for herself and there was another food that was given by the Reapers yes everybody okay so there is a responsibility that you have brother Branham said she was gleaning from the Old Testament and the New Testament anybody here you must clean your own food and there must be a Reaper to give you a food that was intended by Boaz to give you a certain message did I lost anybody Paul was already have an intent for roof but he could not speak to roof about that intent because it was the beginning of harvest everybody okay but he have to use the Reapers everybody okay so that intentionally when roof is picking up the food the reaper will pick up something and throw it in intention what the reaper was giving it was not the food of the Reaper everybody okay he was there food of powers they failed to belonged to Boaz the food belongs to Bowen but Boaz uses a Reaper an angel to deliver a specific food for a specific period of time so every day there is a specific food everybody okay there was a food that had to come from the Reapers every single church is there was a message amen and that message have to come from a Reaper which is the Angel of the edge so as you come to FSS you must meet the reaper of the day and the reaper of the day will give you the food of the day and the food of the day is what you take to eat for that day and then tomorrow you need another food everybody okay everybody okay so as she was laboring picking up the two food she bring it home and then she was the one bringing food at home and keeping the home active everybody okay now this happened in the field of Boaz under the candlestick you remember under the seven messenger but there was a time where this dispensation everybody okay now we need to move from this dispensation from the field of Boaz we go now into another place and that place now is called the threshing floor everybody okay God help me with this computer everybody okay now when this this first session finish Naomi tell the roof he said wait a minute this dispensation is over yes yes now you cannot stay like this I need to find you water rest go to the threshing floor everybody okay when she moved from the field into the threshing floor in the tracing floor the one doing the work his powers everybody okay when you enter the dressing floor the work is not your work anymore everybody okay brother Branham says this oh God he said we see the Great Harvest field white and water ripe and no the grain is ready now for the great water refreshing time dear God we pray that you will open back the water sharks from water around us let us lay in the presence of the water son that's why roof when she entered there all she did was God to sleep in the presence of who borrowers everybody okay these next few days and what happened to the Water Kingdom of God why is the rest connected to a man let's go to Genesis let's go to Genesis chapter 1. give me a minute this thing is acting up everybody okay why is rest connected to men let me remind you this quickly as we go in there the Bible says in reverend in Matthew 25 that then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like unto ten virgin which took their lamp and went forth to meet water bridegroom let me tell you this can I erase this you know what it means we are in the great mystery now we got Ted virgins we got five of them that are wise and five of them that are what polish go to Matthew 25 first and then let's climb right there we got five virgin that are wise and five virgin that are foolish everybody okay the Bible says that the 10th virgin which took the lamp and went forth to meet who the blood group all this virgin if you remember they were his spouse oh they were fiance or they were engaged amen and engagement in the Bible means that it's already marriage you know that because the Bible said Joseph was engaged to Mary and when God said go get married that wife everybody here in other words every virgin here potentially already was a wife everybody okay and this virgin pick up lamps I'm going slowly those lamps had the oil everybody okay and that oil was already in use and the oil was burning everybody okay now let's go to Matthew 25. if you dare you can say man amen go to verse two and five of them were wise and five were what foolish day that were foolish took the lamp everybody okay and took no oil with water then so the characteristic of a foolish virgin everybody okay is somebody that have oil in the lamp everybody okay but did not take the backup oil everybody okay everybody okay so right here we got two oil that's right man hey everybody okay we got the first oil which was in the lamp everybody okay and we got the second oil which was the Bible says in the vessel everybody okay the first oil was already burning oh it was already in use everybody okay and the second one was not in use he was annoying of Reserve he was an oil of backup he was an all that was not manifested yet everybody okay so as the wise virgin were journeying They Carried that oil but you would not know that they have it everybody okay so far everybody good so far now let me tell you that are you following me the fish oil and the second oil are not different in texture everybody okay in composition you following me when you look at the fish oil and you look at the second oil buff of they all look the same but there are different toilets everybody okay if they give you the first oil and they give you the second oil both of them are the same what makes those oil different what makes the oil different is not the composition it is the ministry of the oil are you following me the ministries of the oil or the job of the oil or determine of the oil is what makes a difference between the fish oil and the second oil everybody okay so far everybody good so far now we found out that the foolish virgin when they were picking up the lamp they did not take the second oil everybody okay but the wife's virgin when they pick up the lamp they picked the second hole in other words The Vow the white virgin picked two of you the wise virgin have the first and the second oil everybody okay but the foolish virgin has only the first oil everybody okay the Bible says in verse 3 that they they were foolish took their land and took no oil with them everybody okay the foolish virgin you following me didn't see the importance of the second oil I hope you are getting what I'm going I told you I'm going slowly everybody clear so the second all you will stay but when the foolish look at all they say we don't need this oil we don't see the use of the Soul do you follow me it is an all that to them was not useful it was not necessary [Music] as long as they have the festival that's all they need to make it to the bathroom I am not talking about denomination denomination I already finished I am talking about the people in the message everybody clear hey everybody here one day they were building the Temple everybody here and they were bringing Stone and the Builder were picking up the stone and put it there pick up the stone and put it there pick up the stone and put it in pick up the stone and put it there and the building was moving and the building was moving and finally they brought another Stone everybody clear when they built they look at the stone they say what kind of stone is this do you follow me they said this stone look bizarre it's a Nordstrom we don't see where it's going to fit take that stone cast it away and Jesus said the stone that debut that rejected the storm that the foolish virgin do you follow me rejected that was the cheese Cornerstone everybody okay when they continue to build the building they found that there's a certain age something was not working right everybody okay something is not working right with this message some of the people begin to leave the message some of the preacher begin to leave the message something is the problem is the Builder the problem is the preacher they preacher they were preaching they rejected the heads down they rejected the Cornerstone that thought he was not necessary they thought we don't need those stuff what we have is an answer a foolish virgin is the one that despise the second oil that's why you heal we don't need those stuff do we need this to be saved do we need all this mystery to go to the rapture do we need all these seven the weeks of Daniel all this Revelation so that we can go to the Rapture it is a foolish talk in the message rank [Applause] everybody okay everybody clear so far glory to God now as we're moving along everybody okay those foolish virgins pick up the all and the wife pick up the all when both of them are joining you cannot make a difference between the two sometime some of the wise virgin were giving too much credit to the foolish virgin some of the White Version were looking they said if I can only be with black sisters so and so oh God only take it's a matter of time are you following me as they continue to Journey you're following me the oil was going down everybody okay everybody okay now the wise virgin were also traveling with a reserve oil but the reservoir was quiet are you following me what happened at midnight the Bible says while the bridegroom did what so the second all is the oil of overtime it is the oil of the long suffering when God lingers a little bit that's the old he says while the bridegroom Terry they all did Waters and did what which all make them slumber everybody okay now they make they were slumbered and asleep and at which time midnight there was a water crying man you know that cry is a person so they cry they shout and the message is a person and then midnight there was a cry and the Christ said behold water the bridegroom I mean go ye out to do what meet him then all those virgins did what a rose and they did what trimmed their land and the foolish say unto the water give us off your water for our water gone out can I continue what are you trying to say anybody here the second oil was putting news are activated amen when the bridegroom was coming do you follow me it's a norm that work with the bread room everybody okay it is the groom's oil everybody here everybody okay so the second oil is the oil of the bread groom everybody okay and the fish oil was the all that every woman had but all the women were what are you following me are you following me so the fish soil was a qualification of a woman do you follow me everybody that have the first oil was a wife they were fiance to the groom everybody okay this first oil was the oil the woman oil the white oil I'm going slowly but the second one is the water everybody okay so the foolish virgin had the white oil only but the wise virgin have the ones oil and the groom oil you're following me so the one who really have the husband is the one that have the husband oil we can be under the same Journey going to meet the same man going to meet the same Jesus going to meet the same husband the one that belonged to the husband is only qualified by the second oil everybody okay everybody okay roof was in the field working with the maiden the wind the maiden were women Ruth was a woman the maiden were workers roof was a worker but one of them was the wife of Boaz and another one was not the wife of powers everybody okay what makes you the wife is the groom's oil everybody okay with the wife or you can claim everything you can show the ring and tell that we are engaged everybody okay but you're not really the wife do you follow me so here we found out that the wise virgin got a groom oil or a male oil amen and a female oil both of these all are the same they are only different in the ministry I told you it's a different language my God Lord help me oh my god let's go to Genesis 1. as the computer picks up glory to God the devil the devil the devil let's go to Genesis chapter one my brother I don't know if you need a click or what glory to God still not responding go ahead and click amen I don't know what happened to this connection here I don't know if it's a battery but it's frozen there go ahead and click again if you can get me new batteries that would be great that's what I did yes my God no let's go back okay go ahead yeah let's go to Genesis chapter one if you can get me new batteries please that would be great let's go to verse 26. if you're there you can say Amen don't get that distraction we doing good amen if you're there you can say amen amen now you already understand this can I race down here we got two of you we got the groom's oil and uh bradled amen you there all right let's go to verse 26. and God say let us make what man how many men let us make man the mystery of a man let us make man in our water image so this man is made in the image everybody okay Karma after our water he is made in the image and in the likeness of who God amen glory to God now the Bible says here thank you my brother he said let them now when God say let MC man he was only one man I'm going slowly then God changed terminology he said this one man let them now man move from singular into a plural into exam who is them the Bible says this let them have dominion offer the fish of the sea thank you my brother offer the father let me see if it's still battling maybe you need to put it up again okay no it's not responding okay he did okay we'll figure it out he said let them so somebody maybe need to stay right there and work with me he said and let them have dominion over the fish of the Sea of the fall of the year and over the cuddle and over all the Earth and over every creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man everybody look at that singular in his own what image and in the image of who God in the image of God created him how and what a female created water are we okay so when God created man demand that God created was double I'm going slowly God created a door or a double man and that double man was male and female everybody okay jump to verse 28. and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and of every living thing that moves upon the Water Earth so when God created man God created man in his own image and in his own likeness when man came out man was one unit everybody okay and in that one unit everybody care he was a double there was a male and a female if God created man in his own everybody okay and he's on water likeness and if that man is male and female how is that God male and female are you having are you scared to say a man God is how and water female am I reading a different Bible God is mayor and water female everybody okay let's go to Genesis 5. I told you it's a different language but it's in the scripture everybody okay glory to God go ahead and click brother Robert Amen brother Branham says this the in the beginning there were water one God when he met man he made him a water dual person and whatever the message and the scripture are perfectly in line we prove it to you all the time he separated him in water flesh and put him here on Earth in flesh and the female part was still in the water spirit let's push the break there let's go to Genesis father this man is double his name this man is female and male just like God is female and male but this man must have a name we need to know his name amen but when the name come the name is the name of the man not your way of naming the man let's say let's use God language forget about your intellectual and your language let's say what the word say okay let's go to Genesis 5. if you're there you can say amen amen first one this is the book of the generation of who where did that name come from let's continue in the day that God created who man in his water likeness of God made he what him made He Who so the man was a hymn are you okay this man this double man here is him did the Bible say to her so God also is a what everybody okay everybody okay verse 2. verse two my brother you ready male and female created he what them and he did what bless them and call Dad are you watching your Bible Adam he called them water so what is the name of this mail Adam what is the name of this female Adam so if you step right there you say Adam how many people do you expect to come to everybody okay everybody okay so these two beings here are called Adam I mean who knows the name of God you have a problem saying that who knows the name of God Jesus and Jesus is how well female so if the man his name is Jesus what is the name of the woman Jesus is he complicated let's go to Malachi Malachi chapter 2 I don't know what to do with time father help me let's go to the Book of Malachi brother Robert you can click click again glory to God later let's go to Malachi chapter two if you dare you can say amen amen you there you there jump to verse 14. yet you say wherefore in other words why because the Lord has been witness between who you and the hope your wife the wife of your youth against whom you have dealt how cautiously yet she is your water companion and the wife of your water Covenant let me leave that alone for married people and did not he make what one God never make two am I reading a different Bible no he made what one did he not make one yet had hit the water residue of the water spirit in other word when God makes man amen God still existed are you following me when God created Adam God will still existed but Adam came out of God you following me keep that in mind verse 15 and wait for one that he must seek a good receipt therefore take heed to your spirit and let none dealt treacherously against the water of Water thy use of that youth amen for the Lord God of Israel says that he hates what putting away means what course so let me continue divorce him for one covers violence with his government say the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you dealt you deal not water preciously God is talking through Malachi he said I notice that some of you men are committing adultery and because you're committing adultery you are breaking the Covenant with the woman I want to remind you that in the beginning God created one everybody okay and God hate what divorce putting away everybody okay now if you notice you are here in the beginning God created one man you following me but that one man when you look at him he is male and what the female in Genesis 2 you following me verse 7. God decided to create a body amen and to take the man and put him in the body amen how many men did he create in Jesus is one one how many body is God supposed to create you afraid let me go slowly again your problem is you here leave this alone okay leave this alone let's go back here that's why I say I'm gonna go slow because it's hard for you to earn to to get it but you're gonna get it how many men God created one singular amen let's remain here if God need to take this man and put him in the body how many body does God need one everybody okay so when God took Adam you follow me and put Adam in the body amen if God wants to make Eve where is God gonna pull Ephraim from Adam from where Adam why everybody okay everybody okay that's the reason why when it was time to creative God was under obligation because if God created Eve separately it's gonna be contrary to the original picture do you follow me amen it cannot come from another place because Adam was a package everybody okay God never created Adam and Eve that was wrong he created Adam but he said Adam there was Adam and Eve so when creating well so when God created the body of Adam he's going to create but inside the body come on everybody okay he must react if and who that's why there are guns of thoughts and flesh of Flesh and the two shall be one because at the beginning they were one everybody okay everybody okay so when we look at man from his creation maybe stop many steward men was male and female everybody okay and God called The Man both of them Adam okay this is why I hope you're not sleeping this is why this is why almost some of a man our double this is why man in his body his ex and why everybody okay everybody okay every man in his body is at and why reflecting their original amen [Music] [Applause] did I lost anyone did I lost anyone so when God comes everybody okay check somebody's wake somebody up there I don't want to question later on because you're sleeping I don't want a question later on everybody okay everybody okay so when God put Adam into the body he looked he said he began to create two two two two two two two God got excited he said oh everything is two everything is two everything is two but Adam is one he said no no it's not good I need to create what a help made for who Adam the Holy Spirit demanded him he said be careful don't be quick to create like this remember this boy when you created him he came double so when you want to create his mate you need to make sure where you're pulling that mate out everybody okay but man and woman when they were created like this men and women were equal why did she do such a thing being in the water I ordered so this order is a higher order of men because this order was a in the image and the water likeness disorder was the order of God he says she was right with man how co-equal with him but oh no now that she lost her water co-equalness with man when she did what sin and God said man will be a water ruler but at the beginning she was what co-equal I will get to that later on but let me get where I'm trying to go everybody okay when man God came to me he said I need to create a woman God took the man put him to sleep give him anesthesia general anesthesia he opened the surgery and God pulled the woman everybody okay and then he pulled the woman out and created the woman everybody okay when God finished to create the woman as God put Adam Adam in his body was X and why you following me God entered this party and picked the wire the X and pulled the eggs out everybody okay and created a woman that's why the gene of a woman are always EX you don't see a y in a woman everybody okay in other words man is 50 percent woman and 50 percent a woman is 100 woman everybody okay everybody okay if you have the woman if you have the female everybody okay you are missing the mail but if that is female amen you have the woman and the male together the one who determined a child in the pregnancy is not the woman the man how many knows this how many have seen this it's in your Bible x and x give water 2x it's water a girl X and Y give what x y x and x give what two x X and Y give what x y X Y you only have two possibilities either you're going to have a boy or you're going to have that girl the one who determined is not the woman it is the man who determined the sex of a child everybody okay everybody Okay click the brother of it everybody okay everybody okay glory to God now brother Branham said God in the beginning when he know men and women was made one not wanting flesh and one in one you know everybody okay he knew that so in order to prove that to you when God the woman he never took some dust and met her like he did man he took a water wave out of the sad of Adam and she became a water by product man foreign let me jump here for the sake of time look for when he was first made he was made water two people together he was made water both men and female the man was the Bible said she was God made both male and female created he him notice when man was separated from that from the theophany and put in flesh he was not just all together there part of his being was still in water so he didn't look what right the Bible says that man was created in the water image of who God what is the image of God let's go to Second Corinthians chapter four women Pi product by product you need to know what you're talking about say woman body was a biproduct not your wife's spirit by putting women by product that's why you treated her the way you treat it because in your mind by product in the kitchen in the kitchen and you see the sisters in the message they like this amen you are patriarch I have a quote amen let's go to Second Corinthians chapter four verse four you there in whom the God of this world has done what the mind of water which believe water no less the light of the Glorious Gospel of who Christ stop the light of who Christ the light of who Christ Karma who is that the image of God of water God stop the image of God is who Christ yeah everybody okay amen so if Man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ that man that was created was what Christ everybody okay amen everybody okay glory to God brother Robert can you click oh God I thought this would be the quickest sermon I'm gonna preach amen amen so God the image of God is who Christ but we seen that Christ is buff water male and water female socrust is a female some are saying this some are saying this let's go to proverb I know it's a different language God In the Garden of Eden third man you can eat everything you remember you can eat of every tree except one tree which is the tree of the knowledge of what but in the midst of the garden there were two trees one of them was who the tree of life and we found out that the tree of life was who the tree of life was crushed he was the Tree of Life amen the Tree of Life Is Christ but Christ is how please can you can you tell me something request is man and what female so let's go to profitable let's go to proverb 3. it's hard brother Stephen I'm trying to see where you're going with this let's go to the proverb 3 verse 13. you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say happy is the man that found water wisdom you know the wisdom of God is who Christ and the men that gets water understanding for the merchandise of it of wisdom is better than the merchandise of the merchandise of silver and again they're off then find gold amen we know wisdom is Christ because the Bible say Christ the word the wisdom of God everybody okay now on verse 15 the Bible say he is more precious what did he say she oh the wisdom is a woman that's what he said okay let's go slowly you you want to say okay the Bible say Christ is the wisdom of God amen it's in First Corinthians 2 you can look at that but now we found out that there is another woman another wisdom but that wisdom is called her is called she hey let me say she before somebody say the Bible didn't say that let me repeat what the Bible say and the woman is she okay let's go first uh as the 15th she is more precious than Ruby
