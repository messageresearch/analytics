[45:39] and the eyes of both of them were open
[45:41] and they knew that they were naked
[45:43] and they sowed fig leaves together and
[45:46] made themselves
[45:47] aprons
[45:58] here
[46:04] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[46:06] walking in the midst in the garden
[46:08] in the cool of the day and adams and his
[46:11] wife hid themselves
[46:12] from the presence of the lord among the
[46:14] trees of the garden
[46:21] [Music]
[46:26] i just want you to keep in mind this
[46:29] very particular
[46:30] part adam and his wife
[46:33] heed themselves from the presence of the
[46:37] lord
[46:37] i want you to remember that um
[46:41] among the trees of the garden
[46:44] now we drop to verse 9.
[46:50] and the lord god called unto adam and
[46:52] say unto him
[46:53] where are the
[47:07] and i was afraid because i was naked and
[47:10] i hate myself
[47:13] eternally to your knee
[47:17] and he said who told thee that that was
[47:19] naked
[47:20] yes yes
[47:28] [Music]
[47:44] verse 21 unto adam also and to his wife
[47:48] did the lord god made coats of skins
[47:51] and clothe them
[47:57] may the lord add the blessing to the
[47:59] reading of his word
[48:02] tonight
[48:09] i have a little subject tonight and my
[48:12] title is
[48:13] position gives possession
[48:17] measurement recommended
[48:29] i would like to start with one of
[48:31] brother branham uh
[48:32] quote he was preaching a message witness
[48:35] in 1954
[48:37] on march 3rd and i'm going to start by
[48:39] paragraph 25.
[48:45] this is what i'm speaking
[48:52] jesus christ is in this building tonight
[48:54] to perform
[48:55] miracles
[49:01] but he does it through his church his
[49:04] people examples
[49:10] they shall lay their hand on the sick
[49:13] and they shall recover
[49:18] [Music]
[49:20] in my name they shall cast out the evil
[49:22] spirit
[49:23] is that right la commission
[49:28] the commission is given in the to the
[49:30] church
[49:32] cesar le problem that's what's the
[49:35] matter with the church tonight
[49:40] he does not know its position
[49:45] amen amen
[49:49] today we're speaking about your position
[50:00] if you know positionally who you was
[50:04] and what you are tonight
[50:07] in your happy in a personal favor you
[50:10] see
[50:17] there won't be a feeble person in here
[50:20] in the next five minutes the prophet is
[50:27] that if you recognize your position
[50:29] tonight yesterday i present community
[50:31] it just takes only five minutes
[50:36] there won't be any here tonight amen
[50:39] amen that's right
[50:48] they think of it is you are looking off
[50:51] into the millennium for something to
[50:54] happen
[51:00] when it's already here
[51:04] now we are the sons of god
[51:15] not we will be we are right now the sons
[51:19] of god
[51:22] is not saying that you will be the sons
[51:25] of god
[51:26] but right now you are sons of god
[51:32] because in the next five minutes the
[51:34] same version
[51:35] we must change the sin in this place the
[51:38] education shall ascend
[51:40] and the one who usually change our
[51:42] situation will do it tonight
[51:46] when tonight right now
[51:49] a certain minute to see this minute we
[51:52] are sitting together
[51:53] i see assembly celeste
[51:57] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[52:12] and the supreme authority that jesus
[52:15] christ has given to every
[52:17] believer two seconds anything you have
[52:21] desire of
[52:22] say don't forget persuade need often
[52:25] do that you live for fair only thing you
[52:28] have to do
[52:29] say demand
[52:41] you receive it and it shall be given
[52:45] unto you mark
[52:48] 11 24 amen amen
[52:53] so as we spoke in the next five minutes
[52:59] so something must happen in this place
[53:01] not replacing
[53:03] our little subject tonight
[53:10] opposition gives possession the position
[53:14] so the position you're going to take
[53:16] tonight
[53:19] will give you what you want
[53:25] where we read in genesis chapter 3
[53:29] it's a story that most of us already
[53:31] know
[53:33] they said but i want to approach it in
[53:35] this angle
[53:38] that is
[53:43] there was a tabernacle that was among
[53:46] the trees
[53:48] and the name of that tabernacle was
[53:50] trees tabernacle
[53:51] amen amen
[54:22] and the pastor was preaching the word
[54:24] coming here
[54:25] he was coming to fellowship with them
[54:28] amen
[54:28] amen
[54:32] so he was coming to check every
[54:34] situation that happened to his children
[54:37] amen amen and you and one day
[54:42] notre say our sister eva
[54:48] was visited by one of the elders
[54:52] one of the elders of the church
[55:00] that went to visit evil connect
[55:04] man
[55:24] these snakes are different than the
[55:26] serpent in the garden of eden
[55:29] who connected to cellar you already know
[55:31] the mystery about it
[55:59] so the elders say wait a minute why
[56:01] would you should i may never be blessed
[56:03] i must also bring my own bible and jesus
[56:07] i must also bring something to the
[56:09] evangelization
[56:11] my time now it is my time
[56:22] and then he went to sister eve amen amen
[56:27] ever when he met sister eva illadie
[56:32] esqueday she he asked sister eve
[56:35] did god really adire
[56:38] did god really say the question
[56:48] that you shall not eat of every tree
[56:51] that is in the garden
[56:52] amen amen
[56:55] allah and you so one day
[56:59] a prayer predication the pastor elohim
[57:02] after the sermon of brother of pastor
[57:05] elohim
[57:06] amen amen
[57:10] last season manifested the elder came
[57:13] as we've already spoken
[57:16] he said let me take my sermon
[57:20] just like i explained it to you
[57:23] he asked the question
[57:32] if you notice he never was specific
[57:34] about which
[57:35] god which fruit but he says every tree
[57:38] in general
[57:42] brother branham said when the devil
[57:44] approaches you
[57:48] usually comes with 99.9
[57:52] of the truth
[57:58] that's where the lies say voila
[58:03] that's the reason why in the garden of
[58:05] eden last year attention
[58:07] evacuation critique recommendations are
[58:09] very so the elder approaches with
[58:12] scriptures
[58:14] he brought his bible and his coach he
[58:17] like come and say i eventually said so
[58:18] he begin to preach to me
[58:20] laughing
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:33] and that's where usually the devil will
[58:36] get you
[58:37] ela
[58:40] and sister eve after listening to the
[58:42] sermon he said you know what you're
[58:44] right
[58:46] so when the elders say they always say
[58:50] that god knows that the day you shall
[58:52] eat of this tree
[58:55] you will be very smart it's going to
[58:58] open your mind
[59:00] ever ever to vegeta so my our sister he
[59:04] found that he was needed
[59:08] amen or serpent
[59:13] he was saying amen when elohim was
[59:16] preaching
[59:21] he was not the old serpent that told her
[59:24] say amen
[59:27] but she said a man out of herself
[59:31] of the sermon the serpent hallelujah
[59:40] we say amen to the sermon
[59:46] and later on she brought the fruit into
[59:49] adam
[59:49] you know the story about him
[59:56] and if you notice right after the ate
[59:59] the fruit
[1:00:00] they ran away from the church sunset
[1:00:03] food this is verse nine giles they run
[1:00:06] away from church
[1:00:08] amen amen
[1:00:11] if you notice in verse nine they run
[1:00:13] away from the church
[1:00:16] now god begin to chase after them elohim
[1:00:19] the pastor elohim was going after them
[1:00:24] when he came to the tabernacle he looked
[1:00:26] where
[1:00:27] uh brother adam who used to sit and
[1:00:30] where
[1:00:30] sister eve used to sit all their places
[1:00:33] are empty
[1:00:36] he found their place is empty
[1:00:40] he said what's going on in china is
[1:00:43] happening
[1:00:45] is keeping people at home oh what is
[1:00:47] going on
[1:00:49] amen amen
[1:00:52] frederick brother adam and sister
[1:00:56] eve they were not in service
[1:01:03] that's when god begin to scream asking
[1:01:06] the question
[1:01:08] adam adam where down why
[1:01:12] where down let the legroom say this is
[1:01:15] church time this
[1:01:18] is the time of prayers
[1:01:22] this is the time we usually fellowship
[1:01:24] escalator
[1:01:27] is this the work of your taxes that kept
[1:01:31] you at home or what are those things
[1:01:35] the church of the living room
[1:01:46] coming to church on the behalf of
[1:01:48] coronavirus
[1:01:50] amen
[1:02:06] so while elohim was shouting scripture
[1:02:09] searching for his children
[1:02:13] adam and eve were there but they were
[1:02:15] heartbreaking
[1:02:16] among the trees of the garden
[1:02:22] remember they were hidden from the
[1:02:24] presence of god
[1:02:25] in amongst the trees of the garden
[1:02:29] they're hidden from the presence of the
[1:02:30] lord amen amen
[1:02:39] but the question is here tonight god
[1:02:42] dearest
[1:02:43] when god was looking for them
[1:02:47] i'm gonna ask you a question do you
[1:02:49] think god did not know where they were
[1:02:51] you nellis are they perfect do you think
[1:02:54] god didn't see them where they were
[1:02:56] hiding
[1:02:56] pascha nous and not rejected
[1:02:58] because we know that our god
[1:03:06] and then he can see very far deeper
[1:03:10] as you one day david david stated
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:39] it is not that god did not know where
[1:03:41] they were
[1:03:44] you want to know why god was asking them
[1:03:46] the question
[1:03:50] was asking them a question in this way
[1:03:54] adam if where is your position now
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:02] you sin jacob
[1:04:05] god already know about your sin two
[1:04:08] second to your affair
[1:04:09] everything you have done in your life
[1:04:12] yet connie
[1:04:13] god already is aware of it
[1:04:16] but when you did what you already done
[1:04:19] tell a position to your priest
[1:04:21] what is the position you taken toward
[1:04:24] god
[1:04:26] and you will notice most of the time at
[1:04:29] that point
[1:04:31] instead of adam searching for god
[1:04:34] because he's in trouble
[1:04:35] said jeremy tennacious church he was
[1:04:38] actually
[1:04:39] god looking for adam who fell into sin
[1:04:42] amen amen elizo free
[1:04:46] they run away to hide himself
[1:04:51] dear
[1:05:01] no matter what happened to them dear
[1:05:07] a foreign near the predication after the
[1:05:10] last service
[1:05:11] in a position i know after my last
[1:05:14] sermon
[1:05:15] and nowhere i know that you have
[1:05:18] authority against
[1:05:20] jesus
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:45] where are you in your position brother
[1:05:48] branham
[1:05:59] he could call leo and just play with him
[1:06:16] of the question where or down

[1:06:26] where are down
[1:06:27] to your appreciated position which
[1:06:29] position do you have

[1:07:15] holy prophet
[1:07:16] we read brother in the culture amen amen
[1:07:22] you who could pray for the slaves
[1:07:26] when they were trouble in the church the
[1:07:28] problem is that they knew that there may
[1:07:30] be
[1:07:30] a problem in the society in your family
[1:07:34] there are people used to lost that we
[1:07:36] are solutions but when you come into a
[1:07:40] problem

[1:11:59] the prophet where we just read brother
[1:12:01] branham tonight
[1:12:05] brother branham was talking about david
[1:12:07] who was waiting somewhere
[1:12:09] you'll have any problems he had a battle
[1:12:12] in front of the emperor
[1:12:13] and he was waiting for the breath again
[1:12:16] he wanted to go to work
[1:12:18] but he want to be sure
[1:12:34] i'm not
[1:12:48] tonight who fair remember shows to do
[1:12:51] and perform the same thing
[1:12:53] amen amen
[1:12:57] we're going to paragraph 23 of the
[1:12:59] series
[1:13:00] in the same sermon
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:30] comes from a strength in the garden of
[1:13:33] eden lost concern on the continent
[1:13:35] when man realized he had sinned
[1:13:39] in a religion he tried to make himself a
[1:13:42] relative
[1:13:43] a covering if
[1:14:08] and since then it has been a strain of
[1:14:11] men down through the edges trying to do
[1:14:14] something
[1:14:15] to save his self the prophet
[1:14:19] what brother pranam is saying here is
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:23] bringing back to remembrance the story
[1:14:25] of adam and eve
[1:14:39] you have a covering which we call
[1:14:40] religion amen
[1:14:42] amen when god was wrong
[1:14:47] they were afraid
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:52] brother branham said they were already
[1:14:54] scared
[1:14:56] because fear got its place in today
[1:15:00] now look at god watch this
[1:15:04] god who knows the end from the beginning
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:22] the bible said god created man in his
[1:15:25] own image
[1:15:29] how can god create man in his own image
[1:15:32] let the tweet and destroy his own images
[1:15:35] on prophet sees
[1:16:04] he already
[1:16:15] [Laughter]
[1:16:18] because god could not destroy his own
[1:16:21] testimony
[1:16:23] brothers and sisters today he said you
[1:16:25] have faithfully maybe you stole
[1:16:27] something
[1:16:30] maybe you went and uh
[1:17:00] still running away the obliques you are
[1:17:02] forgetting something personally
[1:17:04] that's the really people that you are
[1:17:06] running away they will feel
[1:17:08] in a pressure if god they just want to
[1:17:10] open
[1:17:11] stand in the gap for you
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:18:23] god already knew what you were
[1:18:37] and explain his sovereignty that skill
[1:18:39] is appealing
[1:18:40] because god was a servant
[1:18:43] if adam never felt how could he say
[1:18:46] says what you need but if you were not
[1:18:49] in your
[1:18:50] country how could god serve you amen
[1:18:54] amen amen amen never give you a person
[1:18:57] may be in front of god we are always
[1:19:00] sinners
[1:19:00] may come at you unto the machine but how
[1:19:03] are you walking
[1:19:04] to listen to the man how are you keep
[1:19:07] working
[1:19:08] working with condemnation in your life
[1:19:10] and remaining
[1:19:12] instead of coming back to god
[1:19:16] and adam was scared he was scared of god
[1:19:48] he's the god that can change
[1:19:49] synchronously
[1:19:52] amen he will change it tonight
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:57] amen gloria glory be to god
[1:20:01] paragraph eventually i'm gonna go to
[1:20:03] paragraph 23
[1:20:05] of the same sermon
[1:20:09] but you are saved by grace
[1:20:13] i just want you to pay attention to what
[1:20:15] brother brothers
[1:20:17] because it's already written in
[1:20:18] scripture
[1:20:21] you are saved by grace
[1:20:24] election election
[1:20:28] god's for with knowledge
[1:20:32] amen amen the joy of god
[1:20:36] apologize allegri's the first paul tells
[1:20:38] the church
[1:20:41] that god destinated us in christ our
[1:20:45] valor foundation demanded before the
[1:20:48] foundation of the world
[1:20:49] by say think of it
[1:20:55] before the foundation so why
[1:20:58] we worry about the denim
[1:21:02] getting away
[1:21:06] get away from the worries
[1:21:12] we
[1:21:27] criminal when people were looking at
[1:21:30] paul they said that's a criminal
[1:21:32] critic because he was the one whooping
[1:21:35] christian and casting them follow jesus
[1:21:37] and but paul is saying that the murderer
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:22] find yourself in darkness because the
[1:22:24] people of fire move forward amen
[1:22:26] amen god is keep
[1:22:29] moving amen amen the prophet says
[1:22:33] he's saying this experiences
[1:22:37] you already have the loud experience
[1:22:40] you have a lot of testimony that's good
[1:22:45] but you must remember all of the other
[1:22:47] history now
[1:22:51] fresh foreign
[1:22:55] that means that you must always walk
[1:22:57] with the peter of fire
[1:22:59] second to your fear that you're going to
[1:23:00] worship yesterday you must do it again
[1:23:18] blessed be the name of the lord the
[1:23:20] prophet
[1:23:23] brother said we must be the happiest
[1:23:25] people
[1:23:28] when you're hearing this word
[1:23:32] and you were predestinated a valid
[1:23:34] foundation
[1:23:35] for the foundation of the world
[1:23:39] i'm trying to go quickly with time
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:47] there is three questions in genesis
[1:23:51] that god asked in the book of genesis
[1:23:56] question he asked adam
[1:23:59] where are them
[1:24:15] god to say what have that done amen
[1:24:18] amen and the third question
[1:24:24] god asked cain amen
[1:24:28] amen welcome friend where is
[1:24:31] your brother amen three questions amen
[1:24:36] question in the book of genesis
[1:24:40] all those three questions if you noticed
[1:24:45] god never asked those questions to a man
[1:24:49] when his position with him is correct
[1:24:52] they say he always asked those questions
[1:24:56] when men
[1:25:08] what position are you taking first to
[1:25:11] your condition
[1:25:12] basket energy intelligence because a
[1:25:14] smart
[1:25:15] child lost forte when he does something
[1:25:18] wrong
[1:25:19] eleven come appear for example he will
[1:25:22] say
[1:25:22] like peter lost questions
[1:25:26] when jesus looked at them he said what
[1:25:28] are you waiting go like everybody else
[1:25:32] peter say lord
[1:25:36] because you have the word where
[1:25:39] else can i go
[1:25:42] that was the answer of jesus
[1:25:45] that is a true position of a church
[1:25:49] let's go to the book of samuel livre
[1:25:52] somewhere
[1:26:08] and they were uh attackers
[1:26:15] so for david numbers count he wanted to
[1:26:18] recruit as many military
[1:26:20] as he could second until the the the the
[1:26:23] nombre the military lavender
[1:26:25] in other words he put his faith in the
[1:26:27] greatest
[1:26:28] army that he had yes and god
[1:26:32] god was not pleased with him
[1:26:45] i'm just going to start from verse 12
[1:26:47] you can read the whole story at home
[1:26:49] when you get time
[1:26:50] okay that dudes go and say unto david
[1:26:54] just say the lord
[1:26:55] jesus proposed to offer i offered these
[1:26:57] three things
[1:26:59] she was the one that i made
[1:27:02] unto
[1:27:10] because he wanted to correct his
[1:27:12] childhood version
[1:27:14] verse 15. later on foreign
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:30] 70

[1:28:02] the vancouver plane they gave them three
[1:28:04] options

[1:28:08] him
[1:28:08] swati jean voila either i'm gonna send
[1:28:12] feminine
[1:28:22] oh i'm gonna bring the pestilence la
[1:28:25] peste says
[1:28:27] the pestilence it was god's own
[1:28:29] responsibility to walk
[1:28:33] and if you notice in the mirror david
[1:28:36] stated
[1:28:40] he said i cannot be free amen
[1:28:43] because men will never give these women
[1:28:46] they're going to kill me
[1:28:48] i'm choosing correction to be corrected
[1:28:52] by god
[1:28:53] i want to be cooperative
[1:29:07] so it's not good for me to be in the
[1:29:10] hands of my
[1:29:10] enemy amen amen
[1:29:16] and that's what he chose he lost and
[1:29:19] when god began to kill the people
[1:29:22] they went
[1:29:36] amen
[1:30:18] he said what did you
[1:30:26] i see this sin is at the door but you
[1:30:29] have power over it
[1:30:32] but nevertheless
[1:30:46] if you can give me a little bit of time
[1:30:51] let me touch gideon who is our elderly

[1:31:07] seven verses
[1:31:11] two four all the way to seven allah
[1:31:14] now
[1:31:29] um but give you honestly
[1:31:32] position then after jesus heard the
[1:31:34] position of a child
[1:31:36] opposition he stood with the words
[1:31:40] at the sandwiches so god came down and
[1:31:43] went in to gideon
[1:31:46] and god saw him he said
[1:31:52] he said i want to bring deliverance to
[1:31:54] these people
[1:31:57] i want you to pick up some men and go
[1:31:59] fight jesus
[1:32:02] rushing quickly you can read the whole
[1:32:04] story

[1:37:17] church here let's say my courageous
[1:37:47] is free to preach his own doctrine
[1:37:52] for example maybe in the time of luther
[1:37:54] that could happen
[1:37:55] [Music]

[1:56:59] has anointed a lot of folks
[1:57:02] until they don't want to talk to nobody
[1:57:05] they don't want to respond to the deacon
[1:57:07] they don't want to respond to the pastor
[1:57:09] they don't want to even
[1:57:10] be in help they want to run away they
[1:57:14] think they can handle the situation
[1:57:16] they want so and so to handle the
[1:57:18] situation
[1:57:19] and they are missing that all that god
[1:57:22] is doing
[1:57:23] by uncovering the devil there is one
[1:57:25] thing that satan doesn't like is to be
[1:57:27] uncovered
[1:57:29] so when the scripture comes and catch
[1:57:31] him and bring him to the surface
[1:57:34] all that god is telling you is that
[1:57:36] impurity because
[1:57:38] when they take gold god usually have
[1:57:40] impurities
[1:57:42] but when they hit the gold into the fire
[1:57:45] what happened to the impurities
[1:57:46] you have to come on the surface then
[1:57:49] when
[1:57:50] everything come on the surface they
[1:57:52] would take something like uh
[1:57:54] like a wood and scrape it and when you
[1:57:57] look
[1:57:57] it's gonna shine like a glass then god
[1:58:00] can see
[1:58:01] his own reflection in the gold amanda
[1:58:07] that is all the ministry here sometimes
[1:58:10] it catches you you do something and it
[1:58:13] comes on the pulpit
[1:58:14] it is just god telling you that when you
[1:58:16] were doing it
[1:58:17] i was there it is just god telling you
[1:58:20] that
[1:58:20] you have been pretending so much that
[1:58:22] you're a christian
[1:58:24] you are not where you are supposed to be
[1:58:26] and i'm just
[1:58:27] showing you all of this so that you
[1:58:29] realize
[1:58:30] that you need help amen if you continue
[1:58:34] to hold on to your old
[1:58:36] religion life you're going to stay
[1:58:39] behind
[1:58:40] and you won't understand god is not
[1:58:42] bringing his word
[1:58:44] to the christianize you god is bringing
[1:58:46] his word
[1:58:47] to show you that you are thinking you're
[1:58:50] on level 10
[1:58:51] you are not there you are in level one
[1:58:55] understand that you're in level one when
[1:58:57] you recognize that you're in level one
[1:58:59] and you begin to pray
[1:59:01] like level one i'm gonna come down to
[1:59:03] level one
[1:59:04] and pick you up and raise you up but you
[1:59:07] can be in level one
[1:59:08] and you're trying to pretend like you're
[1:59:10] in level 10
[1:59:12] amen because that is what intellectual
[1:59:16] messages has brought in the message camp
[1:59:19] amen the people can quote the message
[1:59:22] the people can
[1:59:23] argue about the message the people can
[1:59:25] spend time
[1:59:26] on the facebook arguing debating but
[1:59:29] their life is completely
[1:59:31] torn out they cannot even pray and cast
[1:59:34] out devil
[1:59:36] everything is about medication
[1:59:38] everything our
[1:59:39] our home is filled with all kind of
[1:59:41] medication
[1:59:42] whenever something happens it's get that
[1:59:44] motrin get that ibuprofen
[1:59:46] get that trauma though get that codeine
[1:59:49] get that allergy medication
[1:59:51] so when is that allergy gonna leave your
[1:59:53] body amen
[1:59:55] so god is just showing you adam adam
[1:59:59] where are they even if you've been 40
[2:00:02] years in this message
[2:00:03] forget about it let me repeat it again
[2:00:08] maybe you didn't get it even if you were
[2:00:10] 40 years in this message
[2:00:12] even if you were born in the message
[2:00:15] this is what the devil
[2:00:16] used as a covering as a religion
[2:00:19] i was born in a message i was raised in
[2:00:22] a message
[2:00:23] i was in this church we already heard
[2:00:25] all this kind of
[2:00:26] uh doctrine before yes you heard this
[2:00:29] doctrine before
[2:00:31] where are you in your state with all the
[2:00:34] years you heard those doctrine
[2:00:36] there is nothing new we already heard
[2:00:38] about the seals okay
[2:00:39] if you heard the seals before show me
[2:00:42] the life of the seals
[2:00:44] because the one who reached their life
[2:00:46] could speak and squirrel comes
[2:00:49] so if you already heard all the dog
[2:00:51] treatments
[2:00:52] where are you at amen
[2:00:56] because there was a spirit of fight in
[2:00:58] the message
[2:01:00] fighting from the pulpit fighting from
[2:01:03] this pastor to this pastor
[2:01:05] and he brought spirit of camp there is a
[2:01:07] camp that believed this
[2:01:08] camp that believed this and the souls of
[2:01:11] the people
[2:01:12] were neglected and the intellectuals
[2:01:15] open up and begin to suck the word and
[2:01:18] people feel like
[2:01:19] they are entitled into something i
[2:01:22] remember
[2:01:23] i am a child of so and so my brother in
[2:01:26] so and so
[2:01:26] my pastor and so and so where are you at
[2:01:30] with all the knowledge you have you can
[2:01:32] come to church
[2:01:33] with all the knowledge you have you can
[2:01:36] stay five
[2:01:36] months three months you don't come to
[2:01:38] church with all the knowledge that you
[2:01:40] have
[2:01:41] look at what you're doing at work look
[2:01:43] at your tax paper
[2:01:45] look how you are treating your wife look
[2:01:47] how you are children
[2:01:48] uh uh uh uh uh how you are treating your
[2:01:52] own husband
[2:01:54] but you know the seals it's an
[2:01:56] intellectual
[2:01:57] knowledge the bible says that when he
[2:02:01] opened our heart did not burn when he
[2:02:04] opened the
[2:02:05] scripture this opening of the scripture
[2:02:08] is to hit the heart
[2:02:10] and bring you back to your original
[2:02:12] prayers not to heat up your head
[2:02:15] because you're going to be arrogant and
[2:02:17] use court and scripture to go fight
[2:02:20] we're not giving you those code to get
[2:02:22] on facebook and get into the fighting
[2:02:24] we're giving you those code to stabilize
[2:02:26] your own faith
[2:02:28] for your own self and for your salvation
[2:02:31] and your christian relationship between
[2:02:34] you and god
[2:02:35] not you and somebody else in some other
[2:02:37] churches
[2:02:38] so please forget your ages
[2:02:41] in the message forgetted what you were
[2:02:44] in the old churches
[2:02:45] because this is why you're going to meet
[2:02:47] christian and you're going to be
[2:02:49] disappointed
[2:02:50] because you're talking to somebody
[2:02:52] you're thinking oh he should be in level
[2:02:54] 10 and he does something you say wait a
[2:02:56] minute i thought this is a preacher
[2:02:58] what happened is people had that
[2:03:01] intellectual
[2:03:02] they got sucked in the message the
[2:03:04] message the message
[2:03:05] fellowship eating in the restaurant
[2:03:08] playing around
[2:03:08] things and nothing happened when a demon
[2:03:12] come we came and pray the first thing
[2:03:14] go to the emergency room go to the
[2:03:15] emergency room go to the emergency room
[2:03:17] go to the emergency room there is no
[2:03:19] faith zero faith
[2:03:21] zero faith we have more faith in loans
[2:03:27] i don't know where these stuff are
[2:03:28] coming from
[2:03:30] we have more faith in loans
[2:03:33] than to have faith that god can give you
[2:03:36] a car without anything
[2:03:38] if you ask somebody that they won't even
[2:03:40] believe it
[2:03:41] yet the third pool the third pool the
[2:03:43] turn pool
[2:03:45] the third pool is lord jesus christ
[2:03:47] would you please help me so that this
[2:03:49] loan can get approved and that loan will
[2:03:52] put you and your family
[2:03:53] in bondage and you can come to church
[2:03:56] because of darlone amen
[2:04:00] where is that prayer that you can say
[2:04:02] father
[2:04:03] i don't have anything i don't even know
[2:04:05] where to start that's why sometimes god
[2:04:07] let some of your credit report to be
[2:04:09] damaged
[2:04:10] until when you go they bounce you up
[2:04:13] when you go the bank show up
[2:04:14] then through it all you're going to
[2:04:16] learn to trust
[2:04:18] jesus then at that point he comes up he
[2:04:20] say
[2:04:21] now you know that this is nobody else
[2:04:23] this is my hand
[2:04:25] amen why because that intellectual faith
[2:04:28] is going to boast
[2:04:29] when it comes to a situation uh let's go
[2:04:32] to the marriage counselor
[2:04:34] where is your prayer because you don't
[2:04:35] believe your own prayer
[2:04:38] it is god's mercy it's coming like a
[2:04:41] whooping but it's not truly a whooping
[2:04:43] behind it there is a special grace
[2:04:47] of door that has been opened to clean
[2:04:50] you up
[2:04:50] and to move you out amen let's be
[2:04:53] humble in this church
[2:04:57] i know the spirit has seen i'm not
[2:04:59] saying everybody is having it but i've
[2:05:01] seen the spirit
[2:05:03] humble yourself before the word of god
[2:05:05] humility is when they bring you the word
[2:05:07] and you just humble yourself that's true
[2:05:09] humility
[2:05:10] just humble yourself and know that yes
[2:05:12] that's me right there
[2:05:14] father help me like the fed like the the
[2:05:18] the republican you just know you say i'm
[2:05:20] not even worthy
[2:05:21] but we have pharisees i do this we were
[2:05:24] there oh that convention i was there yes
[2:05:26] i was there i was also there yes we're
[2:05:28] the one that did this we're the one that
[2:05:30] did this nothing
[2:05:32] nothing nothing forget about it my
[2:05:35] brother
[2:05:36] get serious with god check your life
[2:05:40] make sure everything is good he's just
[2:05:42] bringing you
[2:05:43] a total deliverance to prepare you
[2:05:45] because power
[2:05:47] without character is satanic
[2:05:50] he would never give you the third pull
[2:05:53] if that character
[2:05:54] is not clean up if you not clean up you
[2:05:57] cannot get to the second banquet of
[2:05:59] esther
[2:06:00] that's why that banquet has been held in
[2:06:02] us all along
[2:06:04] i can't preach to that banquet because
[2:06:06] we gotta clean up clean up
[2:06:08] clean up clean up clean up clean up then
[2:06:10] when you get there
[2:06:12] amen is powerless who was asking for
[2:06:15] mercy
[2:06:16] mnu's the one boasting when he goes
[2:06:18] everybody burning
[2:06:19] but in the second banquet a man went
[2:06:22] into the bed where esther was
[2:06:24] and was kneeling there asking for mercy
[2:06:26] to the brother
[2:06:28] how can a big man a prime minister the
[2:06:30] first one after the king
[2:06:32] go beg for mercy not to the king to a
[2:06:34] woman
[2:06:35] a man understood the power of grace
[2:06:38] that was embedded in the bride
[2:06:41] and he want to be getting access to that
[2:06:44] grace but that grace is for only the
[2:06:46] bride misses grace
[2:06:48] to use it for her own people like
[2:06:51] rahab use that grace for her own house
[2:06:55] not to save the other seed but to save
[2:06:58] only the house of heir and go out
[2:07:02] you see the mystery heavenly father
[2:07:05] lord we thank you again for your grace
[2:07:08] for your love your mercy
[2:07:09] and for this mighty sermon that you have
