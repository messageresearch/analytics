========================================

not me you never turn me down you turn him down not me because you said I don't believe in such the word says such there you are blind Pharisees they can discern communism discern all these things but the hour they're living in they can't discern it that's exactly right now it's about to reach its my final goal Again The crucial hour here again what is it crucify we'll make with we can't all make them all Methodist we can't make them all Baptist we can't make them all Oneness we can't make them all Trinity we can't make them all this side of the other but we can have a c where you disagree as far as the East is from the west and the whole thing's wrong it's a satellite to Rome exactly right now as an individual I'm going to ask you what will you do with this anointed word which is the Christ the word that was promised for this you as an individual pilot never got it off his hands you know that he screamed cried and everything scheme he could do he failed to do it there's a legend up in switzland there where green blue water washes up where he committed suicide you know the history of it he finally running crazy and he committed suicide why didn't he repent he couldn't repent no more than Esau could repent he had done it don't you let that happen to you he's on your hands The Works is done the Bible's preached the Holy Ghost has identified fed and he sinful man Dare You To Say It Isn't So the Holy Ghost in This last days and the words that's been spoke said it would come to pass and here it is right before us don't try to do it don't let your end be like pilate no he should have accepted him in his heart that's the only way you can get him off your hands is take him in your heart oh don't make that same mistake listen Hebrews 10 says this if we sin willfully disbelieve willfully After we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin if you sin willfully after it's been identified to you and then you turn it down you are absolutely no chance of ever repenting just a moment a note here I want to bring to you before closing like this on the road to the promised land there was in an exodus coming out of Egypt come out by a promised word of God God made his word knowing by a prophet Moses sing down there he was identified that he was a God to bring him out under the conditions that he would promis to the I am when they come to the B land ktie spia the great mistake they made when they got to the land and looked over into the promised land they said we can't take it what was the other 10 they looked at the circumstances their PR they would lose we grasshoppers through the of but Joshua and Caleb checked up they went back to the word of the Lord said I've give you this land it's a good land p with milk

yesterday where everybody was quiet boom and he was like the Holy Spirit just passed amen amen amen glory to God you slept good everybody looking good praise God my CH welcome back my friend [Applause] amen Oh Glory to God glory glory let's go to Psalm 82 again my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part [Music] 302 book of remembrance slash3 sistera I believe you got the code amen let's see how far we can go Psalm 82 if you there we can say amen amen you know what let's pray because the F35 doesn't want any more time to we need to sore quickly and get into the air we are ego amen ah we're not creature of the earth amen so let's jump and SW quickly let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning Lord thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father the enemy has been battling and father fighting attacking your children left and right with Lord father either a virus or a bacteria something attacking the throat the the sinuses and all kind of things that we don't even want to give a description right now but we all know it's coming from the devil father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that whoever was affected through this weather Lord father that you touch them this morning and may you bring a total and a complete healing so that by the time they leave this building Lord may they feel refreshed and delivered completely because you are still the same yesterday today and forever you are still Jehovah Rafa you the god that heals us for all our sicknesses father we are committing this service unto th hand Lord this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but when it comes to interpret to speak to your children he only take Lord the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit Lord may you anoint me may you anoint the congregation may you anoint also the translator Lord and The Interpreter whoever is helping Lord father may you touch even the invisible audience Lord that you may speak to us in a powerful way like never before father may you move the devil completely out of this place and may the Holy Spirit alone and the elect Angel Lord minister to your children and bless us Lord father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's go to Psalm 82 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says that God verse one stand in the congregation of the mighty you know what it means amen and then he judges among the gods you might be seated remember only God judges the God we clear amen amen amen so which verdict do you listen to God's amen am you listen to the verdict of God amen amen amen if you were falsely arrested let me say even that if you were convicted and you were arrested or the police pull you aside and give you a ticket amen yes and you go to the court and when you get to the court you talk to the judge back and forth and the judge turn around and say that I'm going to drop the charge I'm going to drop the ticket amen what do you care about amen amen what about if you coming outside and you and the police officer met on the hall I meet on the hallway what are you going to do bye-bye what about if the police officer turn around and say I gave you a ticket and it's already been dismissed by the judge who do you listen to the judge do you pay attention to the police officer no sir but what about if you coming out and your friend say you got a ticket you would say go search my record my ticket has already been discharged completely everything is gone amen so you need to pick or to choose who do you want to listen amen amen because your judge is also your lawyer amen everybody clear so far am jump to verse 6 and verse 6 say I have said ye are God Amen and all of you are children of the most high we found out that in verse 6 he was talking about a Divine record now we clear on that one which we call it's a book amen spoken word anyway we got used to each other amen amen it's a book are we together and this book is without any fault it's faultless Amen am it's a clean record and it's a record that has power amen amen amen if you bring this record even the dev BS up amen amen amen because this record say who can convince me of sin amen amen amen so when you fight the devil you need to know which record you using amen and even when you approaching God you need to know which record you approaching god with amen am are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen because if you approach God as a criminal you will be complexed and even the way you talk is different but if you are B but if you approach him with boldness knowing that when I'm approaching him I am not what I'm thinking I am but I am what he says I am I don't know if you get what I'm saying so approach God not about what you thinking about yourself but approach God about what he's saying about who you [Applause] are because you won't forget am but he can forget am are we together are we together amen the Bible says in verse S but you shall die like men this is an Earthly record are we together this is an Earthly record or an Earthly book amen or what we call our natural record which is a messy one this is where all the mess are amen this is all the crying all the fall sin amen tribulations and so forth bottom line it is a bad record a bad one we clear amen are we clear amen so he says but you shall die like man and fall like one of the princes so God is mindful of your second record before you were born remember on Wednesday you do not inform God God knows about everything this Psalm was spoken before any of us were born it was spoken in the time of David amen but David only caught the Eternal mind of God and spoke it so he was already in eternity are we together so before that's why God told jeremi before you were even formed in your mother's Wom I already knew you I know I'm I'm I'm I'm going through the scripture so I can stabilize somebody so we can take off quickly God says before the children were born this is what your boss just gave me to help somebody the Bible say before the children were born you know that scripture right before they even do anything good or bad this is what the Bible say how many knows that scripture the Bible say I love Jacob are we together and I hated Esau God how can you hate a child that is not born yet how can you hate a child that have not even committed a crime in other word god knew your record already and knowing your record he L you according to our way you are slowing me down so remember to give me my time okay ah if I if I sit right here and I say that uh you know I love brother Benjamin amen amen I say I love brother Benjamin and I hate brother devil that's right have I say something wrong have I say something wrong have I said something wrong I love brother Benjamin but I hate brother devil amen if you never seen the devil and if you never seen brother Benjamin we human being you will begin to conjure up you will begin to create your own image of who Benjamin is you would say you know what if brother Steven love Benjamin so benjam must be a good boy must be a boy like this a boy like this a boy like this a boy and you will have a whole curriculum V of brother Benjamin are we together and if they turn around they say hey I hate the devil you will put horns on the devil and you will put a tail on the devil but brother Bram said the devil doesn't have a tail the devil doesn't have a home and matter of fact brother Bram say when the devil was also expressed in human flesh he looks handsome in the person of Judas is [Applause] scariot right are we together are we together but God declare he say I love Jacob that's right God didn't say I love Israel please my friend please my friend Shake somebody's hand say hey where are you at God never say I love Israel God say I love who Jacob do you know what Jacob means do you know what it means is my Bible different than your Bible God say I love who Jacob and Jacob means what a supp a cheer and God say I love Jacob in other word God didn't remove that name when he expressed his love Hallelujah and brother Bram say a name goes with a [Applause] nature now your eyes have change when I say I love Jacob you were looking at Jacob according to the predestinated seed but God look at Jacob by the name Jacob amen and when Jacob came into the word he was the bad one in other word when Jacob moved from the first record and bypass the record are we together and jump into the second record we found Joseph a bad man are we together but when es saw because in hell they got theop also let me leave that alone amen but when Esau came down he appeared to be the good one [Applause] amen amen amen so when you look you say who did God choose the bad one that's why God is telling you before you were born I already love you I saw this record already but I look he look beyond my fault and saw my need are we together am are we together are we together so this prophecy was big was given before any of us here was born sir what I'm trying to make you understand is God knew you he knew your record amen when we will get into the depth of perfection you will see that even your future sin God already saw them amen amen let me ask you a question Lord look at Judas he say heaven have did he not choose you all of so who chose Judah and he say one of you is an angel one of you is what a devil how can God choose a devil please do you need the scripture why why why did God choose a devil so you think God didn't know Judah Amen brother Bram say he already knew and he even call him friend are we together knowing what Judah would do and giving even Judah the power to preach the gospel now it's getting into different material amen so before you have done anything in this world God already knew you God knew you in a Divine record and God knew you into the natural record and God say listen even though you're going to go through this but remember you are God because there is a batt here between the two amen which is contradiction to the first sentence amen Amen in other word This Record here will never change the first record amen I am mindful of everything because Love cover how many sin that's why our love the love of God in Jacob will do what for Jacob cover how many sin are we together now we clear right we clear right hall let's go to Luke 15 glory to God Luke 15 I'm going to start to ver from verse 11 instead of 17 so we can make a point here you see how long you can read the scripture amen so when you're reading one chapter a day you don't know what is under that chapter and God is saying just read one chapter and you think you are doing some hard work oh I didn't read the chapter what about if God say read the chapter and read the things under the chapter you will stuck in one chapter for eternity amen amen let's go to verse 11 if you dare you can say amen amen amen you there amen the Bible says and a certain and he said a certain man had two sons we are focusing on the prodigal and the younger of them said to his father father if you look at this whole story the mother is not there they don't mention the man amen amen okay me leave it alone and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falls to me and he the father divided to them his living are we together are we together we say that this boy have three records you remember that right the first one is his record when he was at home the second one is a record when he was in a far away country are we together and the thir record is when he came back home amen from home outside the home back home amen amen so there is a resurrection [Music] here he left home but at the end of the day he's going to come back home amen are we together are we together a home he had a relationship yes sir with his father there was a relationship amen oh a fellowship amen with his father this fellowship at home gave him access to even ask anything including his own inheritance are we together usually when do you receive an inheritance when your father die are we together but this boy receive it when the father is not even dead are we together so when this boy is at home he have a full access amen amen amen glory to God follow me carefully my friend put a seat belt okay okay okay all right now when when do you receive the inheritance when your daddy die so the full inheritance can be given to you after the death of your father so when your father die it is [Music] finished I hope you getting me now I hope you claming with me now I hope you are claming with me if I lost you raise your hand my friend Jesus uhhuh let me go back again my friend you won't receive the full inheritance when your father is alive you can stand and you say you know what can I have I'm inan a mcdonal Daddy will buy it for you you say can I have a new bag daddy will buy for you can I have a shirt can I have a new dress daddy will give it to you amen but Daddy would tell you you know what the day I die this house here will belong to you so as long as that is alive that house doesn't belong to you are we together but the day your daddy dies everything that is the day your full possession comes to you the day your daddy will die at the cross are we to are we together on the back are we together brother the day your daddy will die at the cross that is the day that you don't nobody have to tell you what belongs to you amen you will be standing and you won't say my dad's home you will say my home I'm going back to my house amen this house belongs to me this car belongs to me why because of the death of Daddy and Paul say a testament is not in effect until the death of the one who wrote it amen and if the death of Jesus Christ is confirmed by autopsy that Jesus died it means everything that Jesus had for me and you are we together are we together are we together are we together but watch this s we read the scripture over and over it's the power of the seals that does that but watch the son daddy is not dead yet I'm giving you time to get everything soak in but without the death of daddy amen he can push Daddy oh yeah oh yeah amen and get the inheritance of daddy before his death what kind of relationship existed between this boy and his father take time now you will understand why they gave him the best [Applause] robe I hope we are together I hope we are together let me start it again my friend let me start it again my friend because you slowing me way down okay let me start it again okay okay you go to a bank you want to buy a house brother AB they say before you buy a house you need to have three years of experience and work do you follow me do you follow me whatever they told you it's not a lie that's it and it is built in the bank system that they must take those information and verify them and input them so the computer can generate an approval amen an approval through and under do you follow me do you follow me now I know clearly that brother Greg only have one year of experience yes yes sir yes sir amen amen but for some reason brother Greg is coming to me he said brother Steven I got an approval from the bank I said which bank that Bank of America right there gave me an approval from the bank but I only have one year of experience when brother CH did the same thing and they refus him before you begin to get upset you need to ask a question who does brother Greg know in the bank I I I I'm I'm going through this example so you can suck in in other word brother Greg might have a different Channel and that channel can bypass the laws of the bank are we together so he can use a different leverage that leverage need only a saying somebody give him a phone call and say I understand he doesn't qualify but go go ahead and give him the [Applause] blone we clear now together let's go back again to our prodal son according to the law according to Paul you cannot get your inheritance until your father die are we together but this boy his father is alive mama is alive because usually when you approach father like that mommy will be the one getting up said and say what are you trying to do huh your father is not even dead so you want to take everything usually it's mama who get upset amen amen amen because even a life insurance cannot be dispersed to you correctly until the death of the one that have the life insurance you can borrow from this but you won't really get the full benefit are we together are we together but this son goes to Father elive say Daddy give me what belongs to me so you are even Breaking Bad I mean uh daddy's business if Daddy owns a company you're telling him now to sell the company which brother Bram say he had to sell it amen and to divide everything what I'm trying to point out to you is there was a relationship between this boy here and his father are we together and his relationship was so strong until even before the death of his father this boy can push something amen and receive what is usually received after the death I'm going to drop where you want me to drop my friend amen amen amen Jesus came on this Earth and he looked at the disciple amen and he was walking somewhere and his weakness hid [Music] him we getting somewhere my friend and when he HD him Jesus was looking for food that's right he turned around he look at the tree and he curs the tree we all know the story everybody goes home in the morning they coming back they look Peter say hey remember it's only Peter who sees stuff like that because Peter means Faith are we together and when Peter look he said Master you remember the tree that you cursed yesterday Jesus purposely went with them through the same road to make sure they witness that's what he did yesterday amen when he spoke the tree was normal when he bypassed the tree was normal and Jesus went to sleep he never put a camera to watch if the tree is dying or not he had confidence on his word are we together and when he woke up in the morning Jesus never say wait a minute let me call who lives one day buddy go check if the tree is dead before I bring my disciple there and because I don't want to bring them there and the tree is not dead then they would say master you don't have power Jesus never had time for that he knew what he spoke happened we getting somewhere ye are Gods ye are Gods amen and then when he came he was in full confidence of what they're going to find and notice he never even told them look at the tree that are cursed he let them witness [Applause] [Music] that are we together are we together when Peter spoke Jesus pushed the break he said Peter you know one thing he said you see that mountain that is over there follow me carefully he said if you speak to that mountain not me if you speak to that mountain how do you speak just like Jesus spoke and when you speak to the mountain you cannot stop also watching the mountain you see what kind of faith we need to Heaven you see what kind of Faith you need to heaven in other words if I spoke to this hand I won't pay attention to this hand anymore Hall the hand must obey what has spok and you need to testify that I used to see your hand like this what happened to your hand brother Steven are we together are we together my friend and then he says if you speak to this mountain amen amen amen you move and throw yourself onto the sea it will happen amen and brother brother yes what about I'm say wait a minute this power amen cannot be given without the death of Jesus Christ I have the quat my friend Amen brother Bram say normally Jesus must die first follow me carefully and then his blood will cleanse men and then when the blood of Jesus Christ cleans man man comes back to the position of Eden are we together when man is in the position of Eden when he's completely without sin then man can speak like Adam but Jesus didn't wait for his death he released that power without his death so the creative power of God was released before the [Applause] atonement and brother Bram come he say no no no no no no I don't understand the scripture brother Bram say I won't even preach on that one right because I don't think that promise is in the atonement right amen and one time brother Bram was going in the wood and God came down butam was thinking about that he said I still don't understand how can this scripture be given before the atonement God came down the author of the book came down he said brother what are you thinking about he say I have difficulty with that scripture he say what what when you speak on the discernment do you think it's [Applause] you how can you have a discernment that never misses do you think it's a human being and he said brother Bram what do you think about the prophet of old because the prophet were [Applause] Gods because Jesus said if they call those to whom the word of the Lord came God that's why the Bible say the word of the Lord came to Isaiah the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the word of the Lord came to this and Jesus said if the word of the Lord comes to you you are God and according to Revelation 10 not just a portion but the full word of God came down toward [Applause] you and God say now Ro Brad take the word eat the word you are [Applause] God I hope we are moving together I hope we are moving together I hope we are moving together I hope we are moving together are we together are we together are we together in other word created Power could be taken before the death of Jesus Christ that's why Moses created I'm going slowly my friend and the Bible says God say among all the prophet Propet there is no Prophet like Moses because Moses when I talk to him I don't have a veil that's why God told Moses I'm going to do something that Abraham doesn't know Isaac doesn't know Jacob doesn't know I'm going to reveal myself to you like Jehovah you a man will become [Applause] God before the death of Jesus Christ showing you that the showing you that the relationship between Moses and God was so tight until God never allow even the body of Moses to be touched by the [Applause] devil not a living body a dead body God didn't allow the devil to even [Applause] know are we together are we together so the level of relationship detering the access into the [Applause] atonement the closer you are in the relationship is the more powerful to and this child here even though dadd is not dead yet he had the power to ask for his inheritance before the death of daddy we read this scripture over and over but it's a new book this morning amen so this boy had a full access to the atonement because he was very closer to Daddy [Music] we just start reading the scripture push the break okay take your finger like this put it in the Bible keep Luke 15 go to Revelation 19 go to revelation 19 I told you these are F35 my friend Hallelujah let's go to Revelation 19 we joke too much until we don't know what Brides mean Hallelujah those that were in married kappo yesterday understood what they brought to me amen amen amen we call somebody Brad but we put restriction on the Brad and that's the way we live our relationship with our wife until your wife is not really fully feeling like she's part of you because there is too much restriction remember yesterday my friend are we together are we together are we together are we together you going to swallow what I'm going to drop right I'm going to bring it from the Bible so don't think I'm you going to swallow it you promise you promise Naomi you promise let's go to Revelation 19 if you there you can say amen amen I wanted to give this to the married couple and he missed and the Holy Spirit remind me this this morning so the congregation will get it amen amen amen amen Revelation 19:1 and then we come back to Luke 19 father I thought I'm going to preach all of this today Lord help me you there amen and I saw what heaven open Heaven open and behold a what a white horse and he that sat upon him was called what faithful and true and in what and in righteousness he does judge and make what war his eyes were as a what a flame of fire and his head were many what crown and his head a name written that no man knew but who he himself remember Jesus have a name that nobody knows but who knows it himself keep that in mind if I can get where I'm trying to get you who think that you are lower can I continue and he has also what verse 13 and he was cl he was clothed with what a Vester so according to the scripture Jesus is dressed with what a vesture with a vesture continue my friend a vesture what D in blood uhhuh with blood amen continue and his name is called the word of God and his name is called what the word of God his name is what the word of God is the word of God the name the word of God amen amen amen so if they say you will become the word come on so which name do you have which name do you carry if we become the word in the beginning was the word who are you who are you you need to know the level of the word that you receive the word that you receive is the full book open [Applause] so which level are you you didn't receive a portion that was Through the Ages you receive the full revelation of Jesus Christ perfectly vated to [Applause] us can I continue can I continue jump to verse uh uh uh 14 let's go and the what and Army you know who the Army is what we went through this right who is that Army the can you say louder I preach with my church louder amen and that's the way I preach here invisible audience will you talk I talk you talk I talk amen amen let me leave it to the Merit couple amen and which were in heaven followed him upon what white horses cloth in what fire wom white and what which was the dress of the BR are we together verse 15 and out of his mouth goes what a sharp sword and

also written what Lord of Lord Lord the big Lord and he got also what Lord amen amen that name is King king of King and Lord of let me start it again is king of King and Lord of Lord are we together

clothing everybody can see glory to God glory to God glory to God unbeliever will see make believer will see foolish V will see the devil will see but on the ti only the BR SE that one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to [Applause] God are we okay are we okay are we okay are we okay are we okay are we okay no something notice something the name on the clothing is not different than the name on the ti so you can say Jesus and I can say Jesus but where are you reading Jesus [Applause] sister Rebecca say brother Chris brother Steven say brother Chris how do I know Chris which level do I know Chris sister Rebeca knows Chris and chis [Applause] are we together are we together are we together only one person can get in the time mer C are you with me are you with me are you with me are you with me and to see the tie the one who has the dress must unveil the unveiling of God the Mighty God being unveiled before us now I'm not a Pentecostal I call you no longer church but I call you PR because we win all the time Glory [Applause] Glory are we together are we together are we together that's why Paul say if you preach another Jesus so we need to know which Jesus we preaching we are preaching Jesus the word of the hour the message of the hour the message is Christ because the message made me know Jesus not on the surface not on the surface but in deepness now I can get in deepness and get the thoughts of God hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] amen are we together are we together are we together my body we together are we together are we together am are we
