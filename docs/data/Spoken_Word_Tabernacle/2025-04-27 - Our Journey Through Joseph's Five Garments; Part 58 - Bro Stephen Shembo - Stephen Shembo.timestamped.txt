[23:16] read. We have a testimony this morning.
[23:18] We have a couple of specials. And
[23:20] obviously with the tub out front, we got
[23:21] a baptism to do today. A water baptism.
[23:24] Amen.
[23:26] Wonderful. That's
[23:28] right. Sister
[23:31] Cynthia. Is Jesus alive? Ma'am, he's
[23:34] alive forever more, isn't he? She wanted
[23:36] to give God glory. All the glory for
[23:40] what he's done for her. Amen. And let's
[23:42] give him a clap offer. Praise God. A
[23:46] dead God don't do that. Just Just Oh,
[23:50] you going to come up and Come on.
[23:53] Amen.
[23:57] Amen.
[24:03] Good morning, saints.
[24:05] My name is Christ Cynthia. Some people
[24:08] call me Cynthia, but my nickname is Gal.
[24:12] If it's all right with you, I'm going to
[24:14] read you what I have written down
[24:17] because I didn't want to miss a single
[24:19] word of what God laid on my heart.
[24:23] Saints, I just want to take a moment to
[24:26] testify about something God showed me
[24:29] this past
[24:30] weekend. First off, my cousin looked at
[24:33] me and said, "Yeah, you look like a
[24:36] Christian woman." Amen. And I said,
[24:39] "Well, I try
[24:41] Then Sunday came. I went to take some
[24:45] food over to my aunt's house. She had
[24:47] just lost her husband. I wasn't trying
[24:50] to do anything special. Just trying to
[24:53] be helpful. Just trying to do what I
[24:56] could. But when I walked in, my first
[25:00] cousin looked at me and said, "You
[25:04] shining."
[25:06] Then she then she looked to another
[25:09] cousin who was standing at the sink and
[25:12] said, "Look at Gal. Gal is
[25:22] shining." She said, "Just look, she's
[25:26] shining." And saints, that touched me
[25:30] because I wasn't trying to shine. I was
[25:32] just trying to show up with love. Amen.
[25:35] So I just want to say this to you all
[25:38] today. You got to live in a way where
[25:41] people don't just hear about God from
[25:44] you. Amen. They see God in you
[25:47] [Applause]
[25:53] in how you walk, in how you talk, in how
[25:57] you love, in how you serve.
[26:01] Let your light shine. Amen. Let it shine
[26:05] so bright that even when you're silent,
[26:10] God is loud.
[26:13] I went back and I looked at a message
[26:16] that brother Brandham quoted
[26:19] 61
[26:21] 0903. The title of the message was, "Let
[26:26] your light so shine before men." Amen.
[26:29] And in paragraph 163, he said, "I want
[26:33] to walk so godly before men that people
[26:36] think of me the same as they did of
[26:39] him." I want to be like Jesus Christ. I
[26:43] love you all and may God continue to
[26:45] bless each and every one of you all.
[26:57] Amen.
[26:59] [Music]
[27:01] Amen.
[27:03] Amen. So, sister Sister Naomi um
[27:07] contacted me earlier this week um this
[27:10] one. We got two this and she wanted to
[27:13] uh also give a testimony this morning in
[27:21] I'm not used to get here but I had to I
[27:25] had to speak up so good. So in the past
[27:29] three weeks I've been praying but I was
[27:33] feeling like I was absent coming to
[27:35] church was good. When I get home I pray
[27:39] but I was feeling like
[27:41] something say and on Saturday last
[27:46] Saturday I pray God I was like God I
[27:50] need to see you you say you hear prayer
[27:52] I need to see you but I don't know what
[27:54] sign I'll come back at night and I'll
[27:57] tell you what sign you need to show me
[27:58] so I need that I know that
[28:01] he's on Sunday morning I wake up I pray
[28:04] the same prayer I didn't know what I
[28:05] needed from God I just knew that I
[28:07] needed God and After Sunday, I went back
[28:11] home. I was tired and I just went I was
[28:14] like, "Okay, God. My spirit is telling
[28:16] me that first I need I needed to make it
[28:20] rain. But I don't need you to make it
[28:22] rain when I'm at work." Because when
[28:24] it's raining, I'm at work. I don't know
[28:25] is winning. And when I'm driving home, I
[28:29] don't want to drive under the rain cuz
[28:30] it's it's a long drive. So, I needed to
[28:33] make it rain. But when I'm close to be
[28:35] at home, when I'm not far from from
[28:38] home. So that way I see that that's you
[28:40] and I forget about it. And on Monday I
[28:42] went to work. I was just tired working
[28:45] and then I just went for a walk. I
[28:47] repeated the same thing and I forget
[28:49] about it. And on Tuesday after work it
[28:52] was hot. It was really hot. And then on
[28:55] my way I was sweating. I was like I just
[28:57] need to go home.
[28:59] And 10 minutes away from work, I just
[29:03] felt like I needed to pray. And I put
[29:06] the music in it. And then I start
[29:07] praying. I started praying in French
[29:09] because that's my first language. And
[29:12] then I pray I I switch the language. I
[29:15] start praying in English, which is
[29:16] unusual because I don't pray in English
[29:17] most of the time. And
[29:20] then couple minutes after that, I start
[29:22] speaking in tongue, which is my first
[29:25] time ever. I tried to cover my mouth but
[29:28] I couldn't stop it and I start speaking
[29:31] in tongue and the Holy Spirit took me
[29:34] like I had to pull over because I
[29:35] couldn't drive at all. So the Holy
[29:38] Spirit took me and put me on the
[29:39] passenger seat and I was looking at
[29:41] myself speaking and I couldn't believe
[29:43] and I start crying. And then after that
[29:47] when I started driving when I was like
[29:49] okay now I need to get home because I
[29:51] can't do this. And on my way home, I was
[29:54] less than 10 minutes away. The sun was
[29:57] shining, but it started raining so hard.
[30:01] And then God told me like, "Naomi, it's
[30:03] raining." And I was like, "Yes, it's
[30:04] raining." And he's like, "You ask for
[30:06] the rain. It's raining." And I was like,
[30:08] "God, what are you saying?" He said, "I
[30:11] hear all
[30:15] prayers." I just wanted to give thanks
[30:17] to God.
[30:25] Amen.
[30:28] Amen. Praise
[30:31] God. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
[30:35] Amen. Amen.
[30:38] Hallelujah.
[30:41] Let's stand. We have one prayer request
[30:43] this
[30:45] morning. Besides all of us having an
[30:47] experience like that, right?
[30:50] Amen. Um I got word that brother smiling
[30:53] this morning. Um had a flat tire on the
[30:55] way to church. He's going to be here,
[30:57] but he's late. But they they it means
[30:59] enough for him to send me, you know, the
[31:01] prayer request. So I want to honor that.
[31:04] Amen. So I want to ask brother Charles,
[31:06] you're right here. We do have two
[31:08] specials this morning.
[31:13] Amen. bless you this
[31:18] morning like you ought to help me
[31:21] pray. God knows I don't know everybody's
[31:23] burdens and everybody's
[31:25] desires and I can't pray for you the way
[31:28] you can pray for
[31:30] yourself. I can't thank the Lord for you
[31:33] the way you can thank the Lord for
[31:34] yourself.
[31:38] Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus Christ,
[31:40] for wonderful testimonies, Lord God.
[31:44] Lord, you prove that you're the same
[31:46] yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, you
[31:49] prove, heavenly Father, that your word
[31:51] is true, Father. You prove, heavenly
[31:53] Father, that this message, Father, that
[31:55] we believe, Lord, is packed with the
[31:57] supernatural, Lord, is packed with the
[31:59] power and demonstration, Lord God. And
[32:01] we give you thanks for it, Father. For
[32:03] we are such an unworthy people, Lord
[32:05] God, but by your grace, Father, you
[32:07] elected us, Father, and you chose us to
[32:09] be worthy, Lord God. So we give you
[32:10] thanks for that, Lord
[32:12] Jesus. And Father, the best that we know
[32:15] how to do, Father, to humble ourselves
[32:17] in your presence, Lord, to give you
[32:18] praise, to give you honor, Lord God, to
[32:21] lift your name above every name, Lord,
[32:23] in every situation and circumstance,
[32:25] Lord God. Lord, we praise you, Lord God,
[32:27] for your goodness, Lord, towards us,
[32:29] heavenly father. We thank you for that
[32:31] elective love, Lord God, that you shower
[32:33] down, Lord, through this message, Lord
[32:35] God. And though we suffer many things,
[32:38] Father, Lord, you hear our prayers,
[32:39] Lord, whenever we pray, Lord God, but
[32:41] you answer in your time, and you answer
[32:43] in your way, Father, and you do
[32:45] exceeding and abundantly, Lord, more
[32:47] than we can ask or think, Lord
[32:49] Jesus. Now, Father, we pray for our
[32:52] precious brother Smiley, Lord God.
[32:53] Father, we pray, Lord God, that you move
[32:55] speedily, Lord, upon the tire being
[32:57] fixed, heavenly father, that he might
[32:59] come in, Lord, and rejoice and praise
[33:01] the Lord with us, Lord, and step into an
[33:02] atmosphere, Father, and give thanks,
[33:04] Lord Jesus Christ, for what you have
[33:06] done for him, Lord God. Father, we pray,
[33:08] Lord God, for each and every need, Lord,
[33:10] online, Lord God, and among us, Lord
[33:12] Jesus Christ, that you meet our
[33:13] requests, Father, granted us the desires
[33:15] of our heart, Lord God. Father, we pray
[33:17] for the tithes and offerings, Lord God,
[33:19] and the building fund. Father, that you
[33:21] grant us an increase, Father, for thy
[33:22] name's sake, Lord God, for all effort we
[33:24] do, Lord God. You said that offering,
[33:27] Lord, is a part of worship, Lord God. We
[33:29] want to give you all our worship and
[33:30] praise, Lord God. But, Lord, there's
[33:32] nothing we can do without you first
[33:34] doing it in us, Lord God, before you
[33:36] first, Lord God, providing, Lord God,
[33:37] the finances for us, Lord God. And we
[33:39] pray, Lord God, that you move in a
[33:41] powerful way, Lord God, touch someone's
[33:42] heart. You touch someone's heart,
[33:44] Father, to give Brother Bran money, Lord
[33:46] God, for his for his uh his ministry,
[33:49] Lord God, when he had to go on a trip,
[33:50] Father, touch someone's heart, heavenly
[33:52] Father, Lord, to provide the finances,
[33:54] Lord, for your kingdom in your name's
[33:56] sake, Lord Jesus Christ. And we promise
[33:58] to give you all the praise, y glory,
[34:00] Lord God. Bless the remainder of the
[34:01] service, Lord God, the worship, Lord
[34:03] God, and songs, Lord God, that will be
[34:05] sung, Lord Jesus. And even our pastor,
[34:07] Lord God, bless him, Lord God, that he
[34:09] might take his rest, Father. He's
[34:10] labored, Lord God. He's done his part,
[34:12] Lord God. He separated himself, Lord
[34:14] God. Lord God, and he sanctified
[34:16] himself, Lord God, for thy name's sake,
[34:18] Lord God. He's done all that a man can
[34:19] do, Father. Lord, now it's your turn,
[34:22] Lord Jesus Christ. And we look to hear
[34:23] from you. Allow him to take his rest,
[34:26] Father. Let you do the work that you
[34:27] promised, Lord. We commit all things
[34:29] into thy hands in the name of our Lord
[34:31] and Savior Jesus Christ.

[51:25] It's amazing hearing testimonies
[51:27] yesterday and what God is doing in the
[51:29] life of his children and continue to do.
[51:32] Amen. Praise God. You might be seated
[51:34] and let me go through some announcement
[51:38] this morning. I have quite a bit of it.
[51:41] So you need to bear with me
[51:44] so that everything will be all right by
[51:47] God's grace. Amen.
[51:49] We need
[51:51] time. I told Brother Robert, I say,
[51:53] "Broad Robert, I need time." And my
[51:56] charger for some reason uh and for my
[52:00] microphone is charged for 8 hours 11
[52:03] minute.
[52:07] Thank God nobody had a heart attack.
[52:11] We won't have a heart attack here. Amen.
[52:14] So, I got plenty plenty of charging. So
[52:17] I need more time. Amen. We greet you all
[52:21] in the precious name of our Lord and
[52:24] Savior Jesus Christ both visible and
[52:27] invisible audience. Any family members
[52:30] here first time, second time. God richly
[52:34] bless you and welcome to Spoken Word
[52:36] Tabernacle. Maybe I don't know your name
[52:38] but you're not a visitor. You're a
[52:40] family member. Welcome to Spoken Word
[52:42] Tabernacle. Amen. Uh I want to apologize
[52:46] for those online because uh our
[52:49] invisible audience they expressed a
[52:50] concern last Sunday. We had to turn
[52:53] YouTube off for about 30 minutes. So
[52:56] somebody was like uh we were ready for
[52:59] the word. So my apology we were giving
[53:01] an announcement and uh not all
[53:04] announcement need to be on YouTube. Some
[53:07] of them need to be for a personal local
[53:11] church. So if you hear you would know it
[53:13] but online sometime we try to watch what
[53:16] we saying especially if it's something
[53:17] really local that's the reason why we
[53:20] had to do it. So our apology maybe next
[53:23] time Lord's willing we will give the
[53:25] announcement at the end if I remember.
[53:28] So we will continue to flow with the
[53:31] service together. Amen. So I got that
[53:34] one clear. Give me some time. I need to
[53:36] go one after the other and make sure. So
[53:38] turn your clock off. Yeah, because it's
[53:41] taking my time. Amen. I believe we up to
[53:44] date with the sermon. We are reading our
[53:46] Bible twice a day. Our cood book, Church
[53:49] Ages, 70 weeks of Daniel, the seals
[53:52] adoption. Or somebody is listening or
[53:56] reading the message of the hour. Amen.
[53:59] We had a wonderful question and answer
[54:01] yesterday.
[54:03] Oh, praise be to the name of the Lord.
[54:09] [Applause]
[54:10] And not only wonderful but our sister,
[54:13] the young sister did great. They cook
[54:16] very well. So we want to always
[54:20] acknowledge
[54:21] that. Amen. Never take things for
[54:24] granted. If everything is working well,
[54:27] we had a nice fellowship and everything
[54:29] was well prepared, organized, on time,
[54:32] which I really like. On time. that one.
[54:36] I need to give you a very big thumbs up.
[54:39] So, God bless you for everything. Amen.
[54:42] And I apologize again. Next apology for
[54:45] those that were on Zoom for some reason
[54:48] the the what do you call it? The caller
[54:52] the connection keep dropping dropping.
[54:55] So before somebody sent and complain we
[54:58] we had an invisible audience. So I
[55:00] apologize again. The technician has been
[55:03] working with me to find an equipment
[55:06] with a higher capacity of hotspot. The
[55:10] equipment came yesterday. You saw me for
[55:12] those that were there bringing a big box
[55:14] to brother set yesterday. So the
[55:17] technician need to work on it and make
[55:19] sure they know what they're doing and we
[55:20] need to try it to make sure wherever we
[55:23] are now we don't depend on anyone's
[55:26] internet. We will have our own hotspot
[55:29] internet that we can move around with
[55:31] it. So that's so I apologize. It's not
[55:34] really the zoom. It's just the
[55:36] connection keep dropping dropping
[55:37] dropping. We already pay zoom for the
[55:39] whole year. So it's about the
[55:41] connection. So we working on it. By
[55:43] God's grace we will be there. So again
[55:46] our apology and the next
[55:48] um uh question and answer will be in
[55:52] July. That will be the quarterly. So you
[55:55] got a break like 3 month 3 month either
[55:58] July or August whichever one the deacon
[56:00] will communicate once they get the date
[56:03] then we bring it to you and put it on
[56:05] the group chat but the majority of the
[56:07] quotes that you needed I already put it
[56:09] on the group chat they are clear and the
[56:12] Lord helped me because I had to to to be
[56:15] on the sermon and then finishing up the
[56:17] sermon and everything. So brother
[56:19] Manhattan had couple quotes that he sent
[56:22] me. I was like praise the Lord. So thank
[56:24] you brother Manhattan for the quote
[56:26] because I use it directly and put it on
[56:28] the chat so everybody can have it. Amen.
[56:31] So if you have any question for what we
[56:33] say the quotes are there. Make sure
[56:35] whenever I put a quotes it's for you. It
[56:37] is no longer my responsibility. Some of
[56:39] you glance and they don't want to read
[56:41] it. So that's your problem between you
[56:43] and God. As far as a shepherd I did my
[56:45] part. So the ball is on your hand. Amen.
[56:48] Praise God. So either it's going to be
[56:50] July because this was uh April, May,
[56:54] June, July. So either July or August,
[56:57] whichever it's going to go, sister,
[56:59] you'll figure it out. Amen. So the
[57:01] deacon will do it. Uh our married couple
[57:05] meeting will be on May the 10th. This
[57:08] will be part six. So again, if you have
[57:12] questions, we cover a lot. If you have
[57:17] question put them on the question box so
[57:19] we review as we moving along or this
[57:23] will be your own decision with the
[57:25] deacon. If we finish this uh series that
[57:29] we going with married couple meeting I
[57:32] can take one series when we sit down and
[57:34] go one on one and you ask question where
[57:36] you miss something but some people won't
[57:39] be able to have enough courage to do
[57:41] that. So to avoid that, you can put your
[57:44] question right there in the question box
[57:47] and go ahead and I will look it up. You
[57:50] don't have to put your name. I will take
[57:51] your question and go ahead and review a
[57:54] part of something that you didn't get
[57:55] well. But if I don't receive it, I
[57:57] assume you got the me uh the material
[58:00] correctly and we move on. Are we
[58:02] together? Brother Benjamin, can you say
[58:04] amen? Amen. Uhuh. Your microphone is not
[58:07] on. Amen. Uhhuh. A little bit more. Can
[58:09] you give him a little volume? So I don't
[58:12] have to depend on someone. Go ahead.
[58:14] Amen. Ah, praise God.
[58:17] So, so if I don't hear anything,
[58:20] everything is okay. Amen. Praise God.
[58:23] So, it's May the 10th. Make sure you you
[58:25] are there. Lord's willing. The young man
[58:29] meeting will be on June the 7th. We will
[58:33] start courtship with the young men. Then
[58:35] we get into engagement. They really
[58:37] really are anxious and waiting for that.
[58:39] So I can see their faces. So don't worry
[58:41] about
[58:42] it. So we will start courtship with them
[58:46] then engagement because they are again
[58:48] behind. So just remember whenever
[58:51] something is already established in this
[58:54] church and it's already been proven by
[58:56] the Bible and by the message of the
[58:59] hour, it becomes a standard for this
[59:02] church. In other words, I will never
[59:05] dodge from the teaching or the standard
[59:08] that have been brought from the word of
[59:10] God and the message of the hour in plain
[59:13] word. If you bring to me something that
[59:17] is contrary to what we already been
[59:20] taught here, I'm not going to do it.
[59:23] Amen. Brother, can you say amen, my
[59:26] friend? Amen. Ah, so if you bring me
[59:28] something that is contrary to what I
[59:31] already been teaching here, I'm not
[59:34] going to be part of it. I'm not going to
[59:36] take it. So don't put pressure on me.
[59:39] Don't even put pressure on the song
[59:41] leader or the congregation and don't
[59:44] even come to put pressure because we
[59:45] didn't announce it here. I'm just not
[59:48] going to be part of it. Are we together?
[59:50] Amen. You can find another pastor and he
[59:53] can go bless you and do whatever he want
[59:55] to do. But as for me and my house and
[59:58] this church,
[1:00:01] we stay behind the message of the hour.
[1:00:04] Are we clear? Praise God. So don't start
[1:00:08] fasting. Everything is okay. So the
[1:00:11] youngman meeting that is June the 7th,
[1:00:14] Lord's willing, we will meet together.
[1:00:16] Now the deacon already have their uh uh
[1:00:20] computers and all the married couple
[1:00:23] meeting are already loaded there. So
[1:00:26] whoever want to review you can go ahead
[1:00:28] and talk to the deacon. They will put
[1:00:29] the dates there and then we move on. So
[1:00:31] you give them time because it's a lot of
[1:00:33] meeting. It's a four years meeting of
[1:00:36] question and answer that the technician
[1:00:38] need to download and download question
[1:00:40] and answer youngsmen. So it's a lot of
[1:00:42] work. So be patient. Once it's
[1:00:44] completed, every deacon will have it.
[1:00:46] But this is what I'm going to say
[1:00:49] because it's a tendency for human being.
[1:00:52] Whenever we put something as a backup,
[1:00:54] it's usually taken for granted. So
[1:00:57] people will purposely begin to miss
[1:01:00] Yeah. Come on, brother. That's the
[1:01:02] truth. session and meeting because they
[1:01:05] know that we got a backup. Since we got
[1:01:08] a streaming, somebody will stay home.
[1:01:10] Correct. and don't want to come to
[1:01:12] church because there is a streaming they
[1:01:15] can sit and have a coffee while they're
[1:01:17] listening to the message. So that's not
[1:01:20] going to be the case. No sir. Amen. With
[1:01:23] these things sir because the deacon are
[1:01:26] married
[1:01:29] with one wife.
[1:01:31] All the deacon are married and they got
[1:01:34] children and they got stuff to do. Amen.
[1:01:37] So the deacon will not be 24 hours
[1:01:40] available for you to keep missing
[1:01:43] meeting so that they're going to be
[1:01:46] available to wait for you to come and
[1:01:48] sit in the home four five hours to
[1:01:50] review. So we will do it. Amen. We will
[1:01:54] help you up. Amen. But do make an
[1:01:56] effort. Have a sacrifice. Whenever we
[1:02:00] have a date, be there. But if you want
[1:02:03] to review it again, no problem. the
[1:02:05] deacon will give you the date that they
[1:02:07] are available and you work around with
[1:02:09] them. So Lord willing they should be
[1:02:11] giving us date for May. You work with
[1:02:14] the deacon or with my wife and you go
[1:02:16] ahead and you see but first you start
[1:02:18] with the deacon because you cannot just
[1:02:20] say oh I'm not going to go there because
[1:02:22] I'm going to review with the deacon
[1:02:23] please. The deacon need a life too.
[1:02:27] Have I said something wrong? Can you
[1:02:29] help me my friend? Amen. I don't know
[1:02:31] what's wrong with his volume.
[1:02:34] Can you go again? Amen. Ah, I want to
[1:02:36] hear him clearly. So things are there
[1:02:40] but I have to say this. I have to say
[1:02:42] this so that no one take advantage of it
[1:02:45] like okay I'm not going to be there
[1:02:47] because I got something to back me up.
[1:02:49] So let's avoid that. Amen. But if you
[1:02:52] have a legitimate reason you cannot be
[1:02:54] there fine. But you're not going to stay
[1:02:57] home and say send me a Zoom because you
[1:02:59] just want to stay home. We're not going
[1:03:00] to send you a Zoom. Amen. Did I say
[1:03:04] something wrong? You cannot just say you
[1:03:07] need to talk to the deacon and give you
[1:03:08] a legitimate reason why you are not
[1:03:11] there before you receive it. But we not
[1:03:13] just going to be the if not everybody
[1:03:15] can stay at home and then the pastor can
[1:03:17] zoom everything.
[1:03:21] I'm sacrifying my time to be there. So
[1:03:26] somebody need to also make a sacrifice
[1:03:28] to be there so we can learn together.
[1:03:31] And every time you learn something and
[1:03:33] you go back and review it, you will
[1:03:35] understand it better. Yes, sir. So make
[1:03:37] an effort to be there. But if you cannot
[1:03:40] make it, there things are there
[1:03:42] available to help you out. So they are
[1:03:44] there, we will help you out. But I have
[1:03:46] to stress because we human being. Make
[1:03:49] an effort to be in the house of the
[1:03:51] Lord. Make an effort to be in the
[1:03:53] meeting. But if things happen, just talk
[1:03:55] to the deacon. They will kind of work
[1:03:57] with you and make sure you review
[1:03:59] things. Everybody clear? Amen. Everybody
[1:04:02] clear? Amen. So I got that one covered.
[1:04:05] The Lord's willing at the end of the
[1:04:07] service we have a water baptism for
[1:04:10] brother Boaz Namusaka.
[1:04:13] So by God's grace we're going to baptize
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:21] somebody. Praise God. Uh Lord's willing.
[1:04:25] This was given to me. We discussed this
[1:04:28] like two or three month before. So, I
[1:04:31] know people will say, "I wish I knew."
[1:04:33] No, no, no. We already discussed this,
[1:04:35] but we want to make sure that everything
[1:04:38] was working together for good because we
[1:04:40] have to take into consideration the
[1:04:42] health of our sister. But you heard the
[1:04:44] testimony yesterday. Everything is going
[1:04:47] well. So, Lord's willing on August the
[1:04:51] 30th, the venue is already been booked.
[1:04:54] It's the hotel where we do our meeting
[1:04:57] on August the 30th. Today it's what we
[1:05:00] instill in April. So you got May, you
[1:05:04] got June, you got July and you got what?
[1:05:08] Four months. August the
[1:05:10] 30th. Brother Glenn and Sister Joan will
[1:05:14] have their
[1:05:21] renewal. So Sister Joan is very excited
[1:05:24] about it.
[1:05:27] If you were yesterday, you already saw
[1:05:29] what happened yesterday. Almost a
[1:05:31] renewal of vow over there. Are we
[1:05:34] together? Are we together? How many
[1:05:37] years, brother Glenn?
[1:05:40] How many?
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:54] Do you know something?
[1:05:56] God is working in this church in a
[1:05:59] powerful way.
[1:06:01] Please give me my time. Let me be just a
[1:06:03] home.
[1:06:05] I had the quote yesterday and I didn't
[1:06:08] know how many years brother Glenn and
[1:06:11] his wife has been married. I didn't even
[1:06:14] know and I found a quote. If it was like
[1:06:16] three or four quotes and I pick one to
[1:06:20] use today and what I pick is exactly
[1:06:24] matching their ears.
[1:06:27] Brother, I I just ask him right now. I'm
[1:06:29] going to read the quote and you're going
[1:06:31] to see how God is working in a
[1:06:33] mysterious way. Yes, brother Glenn. You
[1:06:35] want to say something? One thing. Yes,
[1:06:38] sir. That's why she got away with what
[1:06:41] she did yesterday cuz it's jubilee.
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:50] So for the invisible audience, what
[1:06:54] brother Glenn is saying is Sister Joanne
[1:06:57] did what she did yesterday for those
[1:06:59] that were there because it's a jubilee.
[1:07:01] So we will be celebrating 50 years.
[1:07:06] 50 years of marriage.
[1:07:16] And if the Lord tell this is the type of
[1:07:19] marriage I want in this church.
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:31] Are we together? Are we together? 50
[1:07:35] years of marriage. Oh my God. Praise be
[1:07:39] to the name. The whole church. is
[1:07:42] invited. Amen. In a hotel. So don't look
[1:07:46] for something official. The whole church
[1:07:48] is invited. August the 30th. So make
[1:07:52] sure you be there and look nice.
[1:07:55] Have I say something wrong? Blessed be
[1:07:58] the name of the
[1:08:00] Lord. After question and answer
[1:08:03] yesterday, I linger a little bit and we
[1:08:05] ended up being in a meeting with my wife
[1:08:08] and uh one deacon was there. So I was
[1:08:10] well protected and then all the young
[1:08:14] sisters stays there and we begin to go
[1:08:16] in a meeting like a finances meeting
[1:08:19] again like a review. So we ended up with
[1:08:23] a decision like you know what if
[1:08:24] somebody is still struggling now
[1:08:27] personally in their finances and you
[1:08:29] need help because I already get you the
[1:08:31] principal talk to the deacon come let's
[1:08:34] sit let's go now one and teach you how
[1:08:36] you can get out of trouble quickly. I
[1:08:38] don't want to see any young men in this
[1:08:41] church or any young woman in this church
[1:08:44] struggling financially. That's right.
[1:08:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:50] Amen. I don't want to see anyone because
[1:08:53] sooner once I finish the first subject
[1:08:55] with the married couple, I'm going to
[1:08:57] move into finance to make sure everybody
[1:09:00] in this church is coming off of all
[1:09:02] those things because God came to deliver
[1:09:06] his children. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:09] Amen. If you hide it, that's your
[1:09:11] problem between you and God, then I
[1:09:13] continue. But it's available if you need
[1:09:15] help. Amen. Because some people want to
[1:09:18] I want my privacy. No problem. Keep your
[1:09:20] privacy till you die with it. So there's
[1:09:22] no problem with it. Amen. But when you
[1:09:25] go to your doctor, you don't keep your
[1:09:26] privacy. That's true, brother.
[1:09:29] When you go to your doctor, you tell him
[1:09:31] everything. I have this. And you check.
[1:09:33] You check. You check. And the doctor
[1:09:34] knows everything.
[1:09:37] Don't worry, my friend. Glory to God.
[1:09:40] So, before I read the quote, anyway, I'm
[1:09:43] going to read the quote and then we go
[1:09:44] from there because I didn't know this.
[1:09:46] This is really the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:49] working right here. Praise God. This is
[1:09:51] the quote. Brother Brandham says this.
[1:09:54] Can you see this clearly? He says, I was
[1:09:57] thinking I was thinking this afternoon
[1:10:01] we are going down to brother and
[1:10:04] sisterhood, right?
[1:10:07] Don't forget them.
[1:10:10] This is the golden wedding anniversary.
[1:10:16] I'm reading brother. Me and brother
[1:10:18] Glenn didn't talk last night. Amen. This
[1:10:21] is the what? Golden wedding anniversary.
[1:10:24] I believe the church
[1:10:26] they are going to have a dinner with
[1:10:29] them.
[1:10:31] Amen. This was in
[1:10:33] 1956 and it's matching what is happening
[1:10:36] today because it's the word of God. He
[1:10:39] says, "And I believe the church, they
[1:10:41] are going to have a dinner with them." I
[1:10:44] was thinking the other day, how many
[1:10:46] years? Years. How many years is brother
[1:10:49] Glenn and Sister Joanne being married?
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] Golden Jubilee.
[1:10:55] [Laughter]
[1:10:57] And I see them both how wellaged.
[1:11:01] stricken.
[1:11:04] Have I say something? They are well age
[1:11:07] and what? I thought yes I am 47 years.
[1:11:12] There was they was just married 3 years
[1:11:15] before I was born.
[1:11:19] So now, Brother Glenn, Sister Joanne,
[1:11:21] you got your golden jubilee right there
[1:11:24] with a quote backing everything that
[1:11:27] you're trying to do and having the
[1:11:29] church to have a dinner with you.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:40] Are we together? 50 divided by two equal
[1:11:44] what? 45.
[1:11:49] Why are you saying
[1:11:50] that? Sister Olga and her husband.
[1:11:55] Yes, sir. Are celebrating the 25th
[1:11:59] anniversary, wedding
[1:12:08] anniversary. You see how the Lord is
[1:12:10] working. Brother Manhattan, just stand
[1:12:13] so everybody can be happy.
[1:12:19] You can come over here, my brother. We
[1:12:22] want the church to see you. And they
[1:12:24] look
[1:12:26] beautiful. A wonderful
[1:12:34] couple. Glory. Glory. Glory. Brother.
[1:12:38] You can stand right here.
[1:12:39] Congratulation, my brother.
[1:12:41] Congratulation. Congratulations, sister.
[1:12:43] You can stand right here and face the
[1:12:45] audience so they can see how good you
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:52] look. Praise
[1:12:57] God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:13:02] You see how church is so joyful and
[1:13:05] sister Olga has a testimony. Amen. So
[1:13:08] I'm going to let sister give her
[1:13:10] testimony before we pray for them and
[1:13:13] bless them again. So that from here to
[1:13:16] 50 if the Lord Terry everything double
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:27] double that sister speak perfect English
[1:13:31] but for some reason she want me to
[1:13:33] translate. Go ahead sister I will
[1:13:35] translate.
[1:13:37] God bless you.
[1:13:43] My testimony is not really related to
[1:13:46] marriage, but it's about my daughter,
[1:13:48] Sister
[1:13:57] Joa. I was not ready to give this
[1:14:00] testimony. I kept holding the testimony
[1:14:03] to myself. But I felt pressure that I
[1:14:06] have to do this because somebody
[1:14:08] somewhere is struggling. And I believe
[1:14:10] that my testimony will help somebody
[1:14:13] who's struggling to get faith.
[1:14:19] When we got married, me and my husband,
[1:14:21] we got two children, my two son without
[1:14:25] any problem. Brother Angelo and brother
[1:14:27] Don without any problem.
[1:14:33] We didn't want to stop there. We were
[1:14:35] planning on having other kids, children,
[1:14:38] lamps, but we could not.
[1:14:44] So we try after brother Angelo, we try
[1:14:47] everything for years. Nothing would
[1:14:50] happen. I could not conceive.
[1:14:54] I went to seven doctor obgyn. Seven of
[1:14:58] them perfect completion.
[1:15:12] And the last doctor, the seventh one,
[1:15:15] fulfillment, is the one that really
[1:15:17] discouraged me. He told me that my uh
[1:15:20] male hormone are higher and there is no
[1:15:23] way it's impossible for you to
[1:15:30] conceive. He was even surprised, amazed
[1:15:33] how I even got two boys because he says
[1:15:36] according to him, women like me should
[1:15:38] not even conceive.
[1:15:53] And I was staying there living like a
[1:15:55] woman who already reached menopause
[1:15:57] because I could not even see my monthly
[1:16:00] cycle for 14 years.
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:08] My pastor prayed for me when I was back
[1:16:10] in the
[1:16:13] conga and then we waited and nothing
[1:16:17] happened. When I came
[1:16:22] here, my my husband told me, "Go and
[1:16:25] consult with another OBGYn."
[1:16:34] And uh he went through all the test and
[1:16:37] he did everything and he came up with a
[1:16:40] conclusion that what is happening to you
[1:16:42] is because of the beard that you wear.
[1:16:50] and he want to give me prescribed me a
[1:16:52] medication that will stop that from
[1:16:53] growing.
[1:16:57] I didn't want to take a medication. And
[1:16:59] I say just leave me, let me continue my
[1:17:01] life just as I am.
[1:17:10] And in the country, I still felt the
[1:17:12] pressure to have more children uh
[1:17:15] because based on our culture, the
[1:17:17] environment that we grew up.
[1:17:24] And when I came here to the United
[1:17:26] States, I found people with one child,
[1:17:28] two child. I say, well, this is normal.
[1:17:36] So I changed my mind. I told my husband,
[1:17:39] I say, "Guess what? Just forget about
[1:17:40] it. I don't want to have any more
[1:17:42] children. I'm okay
[1:17:46] now." So I continue my life and even
[1:17:50] forget about it, not even thinking about
[1:17:52] having any more children.
[1:18:01] And when I was still missing, I could
[1:18:03] not even see my monthly circle. I came
[1:18:06] and I spoke to brother Steven at that
[1:18:09] time. He was a deacon and he took me to
[1:18:11] brother Tim who was a pastor at that
[1:18:13] time
[1:18:15] and he prayed for
[1:18:20] me and after three years everything came
[1:18:23] back to normal. I begin to see Mas Maso
[1:18:32] So then my husband came later. You know
[1:18:35] the whole story because I already
[1:18:37] testify here.
[1:18:39] And today the baby's
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:49] ready. Praise God. So that baby is a
[1:18:54] miracle baby.
[1:18:56] It's a baby that have challenged all the
[1:18:59] doctors.
[1:19:02] All the doctor has been challenged by
[1:19:04] that baby
[1:19:06] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:19:09] [Applause]
[1:19:10] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:19:19] The baby is right there. So you can see
[1:19:22] that online.
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:36] Can I say something?
[1:19:38] That baby could not come until spoken
[1:19:41] word
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:50] because God is alive.
[1:19:53] Have faith in what you're going through.
[1:19:56] Never doubt God. Wait, he does
[1:19:59] everything good in his own time. Look
[1:20:03] how we are happy now. Let's give the
[1:20:05] Lord a big clap offering.
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:18] Brother Manhattan,
[1:20:21] at least do you want to say something
[1:20:23] for your 25th years of marriage?
[1:20:30] God bless you all.
[1:20:35] I cannot keep quiet.
[1:20:42] What I will ask to the young people and
[1:20:45] then the young
[1:20:50] couples in every couple we got
[1:20:54] problems but when you love one
[1:20:58] another you will go over the problem.
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:08] So we bless the Lord for it.
[1:21:14] Please the Lord
[1:21:20] so that we can go over our our ups and
[1:21:23] down.
[1:21:26] God richly bless you all.
[1:21:36] If you don't know brother Manhattan,
[1:21:38] usually he's a man of few words. Praise
[1:21:41] God. So we will pray for them so that
[1:21:44] the Lord will again bless them.
[1:21:47] Amen. So you pray with me together.
[1:21:50] Let's pray my brother. Heavenly Father,
[1:21:53] Lord, we are approaching you again
[1:21:55] humbly this morning. Father, we thank
[1:21:57] you for your grace, your love, your
[1:21:59] mercy, and for this couple that is
[1:22:02] reflecting the true marriage of the lamb
[1:22:05] and his wife. Lord, Father, there are so
[1:22:08] many things that you did to this couple
[1:22:10] that I'm even aware of, Lord. Father,
[1:22:13] Lord, you gave them a wonderful home.
[1:22:15] You brought them together when they
[1:22:17] were, Lord, Father, a distance for 11
[1:22:20] years, Lord. Father, you gave baby
[1:22:22] Joella, Lord. Father, every single day
[1:22:25] you are doing marvelous things, Lord,
[1:22:27] for them. Lord, I pray in this 25th
[1:22:29] wedding anniversary that you bless them.
[1:22:33] May the cup run over. May Lord, any
[1:22:36] sickness, any attack from the word of
[1:22:38] darkness against them, Lord, depart from
[1:22:41] them and their family and go back to
[1:22:44] heaven in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:46] Father bless them and give them the
[1:22:48] desire of your heart Lord and and their
[1:22:50] heart Lord and open any avenue any ways
[1:22:54] Lord Father that things has been going
[1:22:56] slow. May you open up Lord and bless
[1:22:58] them so that they can come back and
[1:23:00] testify more for the glory of your name.
[1:23:03] Father we bless them again Lord Father
[1:23:06] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Glory
[1:23:10] to God.
[1:23:14] God bless you. Let's give the Lord a big
[1:23:17] clap
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:23] offering. Glory, glory, glory, glory,
[1:23:26] glory, glory.
[1:23:29] Hallelujah. Amen. So this is an example
[1:23:32] for young people and for the oncoming
[1:23:35] couple. This is what we want. We want to
[1:23:38] hear 50, 20, 60 years of marriage.
[1:23:41] Eternity years of marriage because we
[1:23:44] came from eternity and we going back to
[1:23:46] eternity. Amen. This is what we want.
[1:23:50] Yes, sir. Oh my God. Now I believe it's
[1:23:53] time to get in the word. Let's stand for
[1:23:56] the reading of the word.
[1:23:58] A whole sermon now. It's already been
[1:24:00] preached.
[1:24:03] Oh, glory to God.
[1:24:06] You be gracious with me because the time
[1:24:08] has been taken and these are important
[1:24:10] things that need to be done because you
[1:24:14] will encourage somebody. It will
[1:24:16] strengthen someone and it's an example
[1:24:19] for our children to see that mom and dad
[1:24:23] can stay 25 years and go over their
[1:24:26] differences and iron everything up and
[1:24:29] still looking solid as Christian.
[1:24:32] Congratulation again. God richly bless
[1:24:35] you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to
[1:24:39] God. So, flight attendant, prepare for
[1:24:43] takeoff. My subject this
[1:24:46] morning is our life journey through
[1:24:49] Joseph's five garment part 58. Amen.
[1:24:54] Pastor, where are you
[1:24:57] going? I saw this coach yesterday and I
[1:25:00] felt led to share with you, brother.
[1:25:03] Brother say,
[1:25:05] "Listen, I have read the Bible for how
[1:25:08] many years?" 23 years. And if I had not
[1:25:12] read but one line, I could still be
[1:25:15] preaching on that one line with the new
[1:25:19] text every night.
[1:25:23] Amen. New things. How many? Every night.
[1:25:27] See, it's just so real. It's what? It's
[1:25:30] how inspired. If it's inspired, there is
[1:25:33] not. It has no end. It is for what?
[1:25:36] Everlasting. To what? To everlasting. If
[1:25:39] one word, I am the Lord. You could
[1:25:42] preach on that for a what? 100 million
[1:25:46] years. Amen.
[1:25:49] Amen. So now you understand why one
[1:25:52] scripture can go four, five months. And
[1:25:55] we continue to go from series to series.
[1:25:58] Amen. 400 million year. And it will be
[1:26:01] just as fresh as the day it was what
[1:26:04] spoke. See it is just how it just does
[1:26:08] what goes on and on and on and on and on
[1:26:11] and on and on. There is no end to it. So
[1:26:14] you just keep what ongoing.
[1:26:16] So since the seven seal has been
[1:26:19] unfolded there is no way we can put a
[1:26:22] period to the revelation of Jesus
[1:26:24] Christ. Brother Brandham say even
[1:26:26] through eternity, God will continue to
[1:26:29] unfold himself.
[1:26:32] Are we together? Hallelujah. Let's go to
[1:26:34] Genesis 37.
[1:26:39] Oh, glory to God.
[1:26:42] What a presence of the Lord.
[1:26:45] Testimonies. Marriage 50, 25. How can
[1:26:49] they match this one? 50. This one 25.
[1:26:52] Only God. Only God can do that. Amen. I
[1:26:57] will try to pick up where we stop and
[1:27:00] see if we will get somewhere and
[1:27:03] finished. If we do, then we good and in
[1:27:05] good shape because I need to show you
[1:27:08] when you are waiting for your season.
[1:27:10] What do you need to do?
[1:27:13] We need to get into that. But let's
[1:27:16] still deal with a purpose. Amen.
[1:27:18] Genesis 37 if you dare. Verse 5.
[1:27:22] Remember we're in Joseph series. Let's
[1:27:24] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:27:26] approaching you humbly this morning
[1:27:28] again. Father, we thank you for the
[1:27:31] couples in this church to see what
[1:27:33] you're doing in the middle of couple and
[1:27:35] the way you are restoring sister Joanne
[1:27:38] and what you did for our precious sister
[1:27:40] Olga and Lord what you are doing all
[1:27:42] over for sister Naomi and even your
[1:27:45] anointing touching sister Shiffra and
[1:27:48] everything that is going on in this
[1:27:50] church in this building father we thank
[1:27:52] you beyond Lord Father what we can even
[1:27:54] express Lord this is the father that I
[1:27:57] can go with the ability you have given
[1:28:00] us where when it comes to speaking to
[1:28:02] your bride, he only take the
[1:28:04] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:06] So, Father, I pray that you move me
[1:28:08] aside. May you come down in the power of
[1:28:11] resurrection and speak to our soul and
[1:28:13] bless us and transform our life and fill
[1:28:15] us and heal us and touch everything in
[1:28:19] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:22] Verse five, if you dare, you can say
[1:28:24] amen. Amen.
[1:28:26] And Joseph dreamed a dream. You might be
[1:28:31] seated. And he told it to who? His
[1:28:34] brethren. And they did what? Hated him
[1:28:36] yet the more. Did Joseph manufacture the
[1:28:40] dream? No.
[1:28:43] No.
[1:28:44] Joseph was excited.
[1:28:47] Amen. That he got a dream. And he
[1:28:51] thought everybody will say amen
[1:28:55] to God's purpose for his life.
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] He thought whenever he's going to say
[1:29:02] it, everybody will come and chime in and
[1:29:04] say yes.
[1:29:09] Joseph had a dream and when he expressed
[1:29:12] the dream, his brother hated him. There
[1:29:15] is a reason why they hated him.
[1:29:20] Because if I come and I tell you, I say,
[1:29:21] "Brother Charles, I dream
[1:29:26] yesterday that I got
[1:29:29] $20,000 and then I came and I gave you
[1:29:33] $10,000. Would you hate me?" No.
[1:29:39] We here. We already pray. I'm clamming.
[1:29:42] We already pray. Would you hate me? No.
[1:29:44] If you get if if you hate me, I take you
[1:29:46] to the mental institution.
[1:29:50] You cannot hate me because the dream
[1:29:53] goes into your benefit. But if they
[1:29:56] headed him because there was something
[1:29:59] about that dream that they didn't like.
[1:30:02] Are we together? If you move good, we
[1:30:05] move. I have plenty of material, please.
[1:30:08] Okay. All right. Verse five. And Joseph
[1:30:12] dream a dream. And he told it to his
[1:30:14] brethren and they hated him yet the
[1:30:17] more.
[1:30:19] Are we together? Amen. Verse six. And he
[1:30:22] said because they already hate him
[1:30:24] because his father love him more. Now he
[1:30:26] came and then had the dream.
[1:30:29] So the hatred doubled or triple
[1:30:32] whichever one. Verse six. And because I
[1:30:35] don't have it in the Bible so I don't
[1:30:36] want you to come and say you say double.
[1:30:39] The Bible didn't say it. So whichever
[1:30:40] number he just went more so six and he
[1:30:44] says to them here please I pray you this
[1:30:48] dream which I have dreamed
[1:30:51] for behold we were binging sheavs in the
[1:30:55] field keep
[1:30:57] moving and lo my sheath arose
[1:31:03] okay and sod and also stood upright
[1:31:08] okay keep on moving moving and
[1:31:11] behold your
[1:31:13] sheavs stood round about. Wait a
[1:31:18] minute. So, okay. Okay. No, no, no, no.
[1:31:21] Let him finish the story. Continue.
[1:31:23] Continue with the story. We're trying to
[1:31:24] see where you're going. So, I'm just
[1:31:27] giving you the way we react. Okay. Your
[1:31:29] sheep stood round about
[1:31:33] and and made obedience.
[1:31:37] Do you know what it means? Yes sir.
[1:31:39] Bowing down
[1:31:42] boy.
[1:31:45] You number 11
[1:31:50] the last one.
[1:31:52] We bowing down to you. So now you
[1:31:56] understand why they hated it. Bowing
[1:31:59] down or made obesence to my sheath.
[1:32:07] That dream was a true dream. I could not
[1:32:10] get into dream
[1:32:13] yesterday. And that
[1:32:15] dream, our theme
[1:32:19] today is the panoramic
[1:32:24] view of God's purpose for our life.
[1:32:32] You coming up with fancy word.
[1:32:38] the big picture
[1:32:43] of God's purpose in your life. So your
[1:32:46] purpose have a bigger picture than even
[1:32:49] you think.
[1:32:53] God's purpose for your life is bigger
[1:32:55] than you have not even than you have
[1:32:58] realized.
[1:33:01] Thank you Lord. You say me going through
[1:33:04] this? Of course. Give me time. You will
[1:33:06] see. So
[1:33:09] God revealed to Joseph his purpose,
[1:33:14] right? Amen. In symbols.
[1:33:18] Are we together?
[1:33:20] When Joseph saw his purpose, he got
[1:33:23] excited.
[1:33:25] He said, "Oh, so my brother bowing down
[1:33:29] and me standing up." So I will be ruling
[1:33:32] over them.
[1:33:35] Are we together? The purpose of God for
[1:33:41] Joseph of Joseph was revealed.
[1:33:48] Amen. Amen. And if you notice, God
[1:33:52] showed
[1:33:53] Joseph the final product. Yes. Amen.
[1:33:57] Amen. I hope you are with me. That's
[1:34:01] right. That's exactly
[1:34:04] Have you seen when they trying to build
[1:34:08] a building,
[1:34:10] they usually bring a big picture? Have
[1:34:13] you seen that? You know what it is? And
[1:34:16] they bring it and they put it right
[1:34:18] there.
[1:34:19] So when you see the what Bobcat or
[1:34:21] whatever is going on over there, when
[1:34:24] you pass, when everybody's passing, they
[1:34:26] look and they say, "Oh, so this is what
[1:34:27] they're trying to build. This is what
[1:34:29] they're trying to build. This is what so
[1:34:30] everybody this is how God dealt with
[1:34:33] Joseph. He took the big picture and say
[1:34:38] are we together? Amen. So Joseph woke up
[1:34:40] in the morning. Oh, I'm going to be a
[1:34:42] ruler.
[1:34:46] Did it know what that purpose also have?
[1:34:50] Yeah. Amen. Amen. That's the key. Amen.
[1:34:53] Are we together? Are we together? Please
[1:34:56] follow me carefully. Verse eight. And
[1:35:00] his brethren said to him, "Shall you
[1:35:04] indeed reign over us?" So they
[1:35:07] understood the vision,
[1:35:10] but they only understood one portion of
[1:35:14] the vision.
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] It is true Joseph will be reigning.
[1:35:22] But they never saw what is the benefit.
[1:35:27] Amen. Of Joseph reigning over you.
[1:35:32] Amen.
[1:35:34] All they could look at was like, okay,
[1:35:36] you taking over.
[1:35:38] They didn't know the taking over of
[1:35:40] Joseph was important for their life
[1:35:44] because if Joseph doesn't reign, they
[1:35:47] won't be in Go. That's right, brother.
[1:35:50] Amen. If Joseph doesn't reign, they
[1:35:54] won't be VIP in Egypt.
[1:35:57] Amen. Yes, sir. All the privilege they
[1:36:01] get into Egypt was based on that
[1:36:04] position. Yes. Amen. So the purpose of
[1:36:07] Joseph was really a package.
[1:36:12] Amen. It's a purpose in package.
[1:36:17] Amen.
[1:36:18] You can look it up. You looking at the
[1:36:20] outside but if you open you will see
[1:36:22] other purpose that are inside that
[1:36:25] purpose. Are we together? He says they
[1:36:29] say his brethren said to him verse eight
[1:36:32] shall you indeed reign over us or shall
[1:36:35] you indeed have dominion. Do they really
[1:36:38] understand it? In one way only over us.
[1:36:42] And they headed him yet the more for his
[1:36:47] dreams and for his what? words. Did
[1:36:50] Joseph stop there?
[1:36:52] God comes again to reconfirm
[1:36:55] the purpose again. Because when the
[1:36:57] dream is repeated, it's a principle in
[1:36:59] the Bible.
[1:37:01] Verse nine. And they dream and he
[1:37:03] dreamed yet another dream and told his
[1:37:06] brethren and say,
[1:37:08] "Behold, I have dreamed a dream more."
[1:37:11] They already start heading you and you
[1:37:14] go back again to them.
[1:37:16] Why?
[1:37:20] You should be careful.
[1:37:22] Yes. But God was working something.
[1:37:28] And said, "Behold, I have dreamed a
[1:37:31] dream more. And behold, the sun."
[1:37:36] You are extra uh I mean extrapolating
[1:37:38] now. You're going too far now. and the
[1:37:41] sun, the sun and the moon
[1:37:46] and the 11 stars
[1:37:49] when they were 11.
[1:37:52] So Benjamin was already popping up
[1:37:54] there. They didn't even pay attention
[1:37:56] that the dream was also revealing that
[1:37:59] there is another baby who have not come
[1:38:01] up yet. There was a Joera.
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:08] Have I said something wrong?
[1:38:10] who was not there yet. But because of
[1:38:13] the anger, they could not see the detail
[1:38:16] because Benjamin was not born yet. He
[1:38:18] say, "And the 11 star made obedience to
[1:38:22] me."
[1:38:24] Ah, how many are we? 1 2 3 4 5 6 10.
[1:38:28] They didn't even say, "Wait a minute."
[1:38:30] But we we're missing one. No, 10. He
[1:38:34] already came up with a dream like this.
[1:38:36] So 10 of us and the moon and the and the
[1:38:40] and the moon and the sun. So mommy and
[1:38:41] daddy
[1:38:45] bowing down to him. The first time he
[1:38:48] was ask now he went to the parent.
[1:38:53] You see when you read the Bible it's
[1:38:55] like a story. Now it's changing baby
[1:38:57] boy. Amen. And he told it to his father.
[1:39:03] Instead of stopping at the brother, he
[1:39:05] took it to the father and he took it
[1:39:08] when he includes the father.
[1:39:12] Are we together? He told it to the
[1:39:14] father and to his brethren and his
[1:39:16] father rebuke him. Even daddy got upset.
[1:39:21] Now what are you trying to do here?
[1:39:24] You came after me. Maybe because I love
[1:39:26] you too much. Now you start taking over.
[1:39:30] I need to recalibrate my love toward
[1:39:32] you.
[1:39:36] [Laughter]
[1:39:39] Are we together? Amen. He says his
[1:39:42] brother, his father rebuked him and said
[1:39:45] to him, "What is this dream that you
[1:39:48] have
[1:39:49] dreamed? Shall I
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:55] and your mama
[1:39:58] and your mother and your brethren? He's
[1:40:02] interpreting the dream. Indeed, come to
[1:40:05] bow
[1:40:06] down ourself to you to the earth.
[1:40:12] And his brother envy him.
[1:40:15] But his father observe the saying. So
[1:40:20] what I'm trying to point out here,
[1:40:24] Joseph position was revealed.
[1:40:29] Joseph position was revealed.
[1:40:34] Joseph placement.
[1:40:36] Amen.
[1:40:39] You were there yesterday, right? Yes.
[1:40:41] Joseph adoption
[1:40:46] was revealed when he was a nobody.
[1:40:53] So your adoption vision is already
[1:40:56] there. Amen.
[1:40:59] You are moving
[1:41:02] or being
[1:41:03] predestinated onto adoption. Remember on
[1:41:07] to means you going to it.
[1:41:11] You are not there yet, but you are
[1:41:13] moving into it.
[1:41:15] And you not even the one responsible to
[1:41:18] move there.
[1:41:20] Somebody will move you there. In other
[1:41:22] words, God will slide you into your
[1:41:26] position whether you like it or not.
[1:41:30] Because God knew that daddy love him so
[1:41:33] much. Amen. God knew how long mama
[1:41:37] waited to have that boy. So there is no
[1:41:40] way mama and daddy will agree to send
[1:41:43] this boy to study in Egypt. That's
[1:41:45] correct.
[1:41:50] My question. So what start the trouble
[1:41:54] of Joseph?
[1:41:57] What caused envy? They dream.
[1:42:03] What caused the trouble?
[1:42:06] The dream
[1:42:08] according to Joseph was the dream bad.
[1:42:11] So something that is good thought
[1:42:14] turn up to be evil.
[1:42:17] I hope we are together. Yes sir. The
[1:42:20] thoughts of God
[1:42:23] for Joseph
[1:42:25] was to put him as a ruler. Amen. But
[1:42:28] that thought has a mystery. We're going
[1:42:30] to get into it now sooner. We clear. Are
[1:42:34] we clear? Drop to verse 18. Lord help
[1:42:38] me. It looks like Tom is I'm holding
[1:42:41] Tom. You there? Verse 18. And when they
[1:42:45] saw him a far off, even before he came
[1:42:49] near, this is his brethren to them. They
[1:42:52] conspire against him to slay him. Why do
[1:42:57] they want to slay him? And they say to
[1:43:00] one to another, behold the what? This
[1:43:04] dreamer coming. So what upset them too
[1:43:07] much is not the fact that daddy love
[1:43:10] him. That one they can tolerate that in
[1:43:14] a certain sense because whoever knew the
[1:43:17] story knows that Jacob love Rachel. Yes.
[1:43:22] So they can understand they say h you
[1:43:23] know it's that old love of father and
[1:43:25] mama. Uh so now the baby's coming from
[1:43:28] there that's why father is behaving. So
[1:43:30] give him some time. Understand that. But
[1:43:32] when the dream come the dream now they
[1:43:35] can't take it. We clear verse 20. Come
[1:43:39] on now. Come now therefore and do what?
[1:43:42] Let us slay him. And do what? Cast him
[1:43:45] into some pit. And we will say what?
[1:43:48] some evil beast has devoured him. And we
[1:43:51] shall see
[1:43:54] what will become of what dream.
[1:43:58] Are we together?
[1:44:00] So they wanted to stop the dream. Glory
[1:44:05] to God. The dream.
[1:44:08] Are we together? They wanted to stop.
[1:44:12] God purpose
[1:44:14] for Joseph. Take your time, brother.
[1:44:16] Take your time, brother. Glory to God.
[1:44:19] Amen. They were coming against the very
[1:44:23] purpose of God.
[1:44:25] And they say, you know what? There is a
[1:44:27] purpose for this boy to reign over us.
[1:44:29] Let's cut him off so that we can defeat.
[1:44:33] We can destroy
[1:44:36] his purpose. But that purpose was not a
[1:44:39] human purpose. It was not Jacob purpose.
[1:44:43] Jacob purpose was for his son to stay
[1:44:45] there and grow up and get married and
[1:44:48] stay right there. But Joseph
[1:44:51] purpose from God was for him to become a
[1:44:54] ruler. And no one can destroy that
[1:44:57] purpose.
[1:44:59] Are we together? We clear so far? We
[1:45:03] clear? Let's go to Genesis
[1:45:09] 15. If you there, you can say amen.
[1:45:12] Father help me.
[1:45:17] If you dare, you can say you can say
[1:45:19] amen.
[1:45:21] Genesis
[1:45:24] 15 verse uh 50 verse 15. If you dare,
[1:45:29] you can say amen. Amen. And when
[1:45:31] Joseph's brethren saw that their father
[1:45:34] was dead, they say to Joseph, they say,
[1:45:38] "Joseph will perhaps hate us and we will
[1:45:41] certainly repay and will certainly repay
[1:45:44] us all the evil which what which we did
[1:45:47] to him." In other way, daddy's dead. So
[1:45:49] there is no buffer zone here. This boy
[1:45:52] will let us have it. Amen. Verse 16. And
[1:45:57] they sent a messenger to Joseph saying,
[1:46:00] "Your father did command before he
[1:46:03] died."
[1:46:05] Not our father. Your father.
[1:46:08] I'm reading the Bible. Not our father
[1:46:11] say. No, your father.
[1:46:15] Your father command did command before
[1:46:18] he died. Why didn't daddy tell uh Joseph
[1:46:21] himself? You are the only one that heard
[1:46:23] the the message.
[1:46:26] Can I continue? Verse 17. So shall you
[1:46:30] say to Joseph,
[1:46:33] forgive, I pray you now, the trespasses
[1:46:36] of your brethren
[1:46:40] and the
[1:46:42] sin, for they did to you evil, and now
[1:46:46] we pray you. Oh, I thought it was the
[1:46:49] father praying.
[1:46:53] So they took the father and couple it
[1:46:55] with them. Hallelujah. Are we together?
[1:46:58] So we pray you forgive the trespasses of
[1:47:02] your servant of the servant of God.
[1:47:07] Servant of God
[1:47:09] trying to kill your brother
[1:47:14] and put him in the pit and tell a lie.
[1:47:18] For the servant of the glor of the God
[1:47:21] of your father.
[1:47:23] And Joseph wept. Follow me my friend.
[1:47:26] When they spoke to him and his brethren
[1:47:29] also went and fell down before his face.
[1:47:33] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:47:38] So who ended up where
[1:47:43] I'm asking you a question. Who ended up
[1:47:45] where?
[1:47:46] Never fight God purpose.
[1:47:51] Yes sir. Are we together? And they fell
[1:47:55] before their face and say,
[1:47:57] "Behold, we be your brothers.
[1:48:01] We are now what? Thy servant." Now they
[1:48:03] begin to accept we are your servant.
[1:48:09] Did Joseph say, "Because I'm a chief,
[1:48:11] you my servant." Who's bringing that?
[1:48:15] Praise God. Verse 19. And Joseph said to
[1:48:18] them, "Fear not, for am I in the place
[1:48:21] of God, but as for you,
[1:48:25] you taught evil."
[1:48:28] So who taught evil? God or his brother?
[1:48:32] You taught evil against me, but God
[1:48:38] meant for what? Let's let's please work
[1:48:42] uh our surgery right here.
[1:48:47] When the brother of Joseph were were
[1:48:50] thinking evil,
[1:48:53] God was using that evil.
[1:48:58] Yes, sir. Glory to God. Amen. And
[1:49:01] channeling that evil toward the good. I
[1:49:04] don't know if we together.
[1:49:07] The fire that can burn you can be used
[1:49:10] to light your candle.
[1:49:13] Have I say something wrong? The fire
[1:49:15] that can burn you can be used to light
[1:49:18] your candle. So when they are bringing
[1:49:20] fire, God say, "Oh, great job. I was
[1:49:23] looking for fire." God pick up the fire
[1:49:26] and say, "Where is your candle?"
[1:49:28] So don't get mad at the fire
[1:49:32] because God will use it for good.
[1:49:37] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:49:40] If I get to this serve and it's a
[1:49:42] problem, but when people hate you, leave
[1:49:44] them alone.
[1:49:46] Leave them alone. Leave them alone. God
[1:49:49] will use that. The more they gossip
[1:49:53] about you, it will bring somebody to
[1:49:55] say, "I need to see that person that
[1:49:57] they gossip all the time about it."
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:02] So, it's a actually an advertisement in
[1:50:05] disguisement.
[1:50:08] And when they will see you, they say,
[1:50:09] "Wait a minute. Is this the one they
[1:50:11] were gossiping?" But this is a true
[1:50:13] Christian.
[1:50:17] [Applause]
[1:50:19] Are we together? Are we together? You
[1:50:22] need this type of things especially in
[1:50:24] the message rank.
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] Can I continue? Yes, sir. But God meant
[1:50:31] it to what? For your good to bring to
[1:50:34] pass as it is this day to do what? Save
[1:50:37] much people alive.
[1:50:40] Amen. So what is the purpose?
[1:50:44] What is the purpose of Joseph reigning?
[1:50:46] To save. So the dream was more than just
[1:50:50] ruling.
[1:50:53] The dream was more than what? Now let me
[1:50:57] ask you a question. Joseph is praying.
[1:50:59] Father, I went through so many things.
[1:51:02] Can you please remove me? Father, I pray
[1:51:05] you say to pray in the name of Jesus
[1:51:08] Christ. So our prayer will come to you
[1:51:11] and I will have a yes in the name the
[1:51:14] wonderful, precious, glorious name of
[1:51:18] Jesus Christ. Please Lord, deliver me so
[1:51:21] I can go back to my father.
[1:51:24] That prayer won't be answered. No sir.
[1:51:27] No sir. No sir. I I hope I'm talking to
[1:51:30] somebody.
[1:51:32] Yes, you are. God will say no. Because
[1:51:35] there is a panoramic view.
[1:51:40] There is a bigger picture of your life
[1:51:43] than what you are looking now.
[1:51:46] Now you want to go back home which is
[1:51:48] normal. But God is looking at something
[1:51:54] else. Amen.
[1:51:56] Spoken word in this church, all your
[1:51:59] blood pressure need to disappear.
[1:52:02] I don't want to hear
[1:52:05] people. We serve a true and living God.
[1:52:11] [Applause]
[1:52:13] In other word, when you take your case
[1:52:15] and you give it to God, go to sleep.
[1:52:19] All is well.
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] Yes, sir. Are we together? Quit
[1:52:26] worrying.
[1:52:27] Worry we for nothing in everything by
[1:52:30] prayer and supplication with
[1:52:33] thanksgiving.
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:39] Every prayer that is done by Joseph in
[1:52:41] prison. Lord, Lord, Lord, I stood for
[1:52:44] your word. This woman lied. You know,
[1:52:48] you know
[1:52:51] it's channeling you somewhere. Yes,
[1:52:53] there is a bigger picture than the
[1:52:55] prison. The prison is for a season.
[1:52:58] Glory, glory. Part for house for a
[1:53:00] season.
[1:53:05] The pit for a season. There was a
[1:53:08] season. Joseph was in the pit because
[1:53:11] they have to wait for his cargo. His
[1:53:15] airplane, his shipping was not yet
[1:53:19] arrived. That's why they put him in the
[1:53:20] pit. When the Ishmael had came up, it
[1:53:23] was over.
[1:53:27] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:53:30] Where are we at, my friend? Verse 20.
[1:53:33] So, the purpose of the dream is to save
[1:53:38] how many people? Much people alive. How
[1:53:40] many? Much people. Do you know what much
[1:53:42] people means? A lot. A lot.
[1:53:47] Now if you know this now correct would
[1:53:53] you worry in piper house? No
[1:53:56] would you cry in a prison? No. You are
[1:53:59] even more fortunate than Joseph. Yes
[1:54:01] sir. Because the seals has been open.
[1:54:04] Now God is showing you things that are
[1:54:06] be before over there.
[1:54:10] Are we together? Joseph was living a
[1:54:12] life Yes. not understanding but the end
[1:54:16] is something don't worry my friend verse
[1:54:19] 21 now therefore do what fear ye not I
[1:54:22] will do what I will nourish you and what

[1:54:27] comforted them and spoke with them how
[1:54:29] kindly you see the purpose now who's
[1:54:32] benefiting who's there walking in Egypt
[1:54:36] when the police officer come he say I'm
[1:54:38] Joseph brother
[1:54:41] and the police officer goes like
[1:54:43] Now, now you don't worry about the
[1:54:45] little boy and we bowing down. Now it's
[1:54:48] not. You don't know me. I'm Joseph
[1:54:50] brother. Yes. Yes. He's my brother. If
[1:54:52] you go to the bank, Joseph is my
[1:54:54] brother. And Joseph is my brother.
[1:54:57] Everywhere you are, you are going, you
[1:54:59] are bringing his
[1:55:01] identity because you know his identity
[1:55:04] means favor. It means
[1:55:07] deliverance. It means healing. It means
[1:55:10] filling of the spirit.
[1:55:12] [Applause]
[1:55:15] Everywhere I'm going. Jesus.
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:23] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:55:26] together? This airplane is climbing
[1:55:28] slowly but good. Let's go to Jeremiah
[1:55:31] 29.
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:36] Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] The problem is this stuff require time.
[1:55:44] I can't preach this like an evangelist.
[1:55:47] Got to go slowly because it's material
[1:55:49] for construction. That's right. Jeremiah
[1:55:53] 29. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:55:55] Evangelist preach preach their own way.
[1:55:57] But this type of material slowly.
[1:55:59] Correct. Cuz we got to make sure we
[1:56:01] putting the the concrete well. So when
[1:56:05] the engineering come, he say, "Wow.
[1:56:08] Who built this?
[1:56:12] We there. Amen. Jeremiah 29:8. If you
[1:56:16] dare, you can say amen. Amen. For thus
[1:56:18] sayith who? The Lord of hosts, the God
[1:56:21] of what? Israel. Let not your prophet
[1:56:24] and your diver that be in your midst in
[1:56:27] the midst of you do what? Deceive you.
[1:56:29] Neither hearken you to you uh to your
[1:56:32] dreams which you cause to be what?
[1:56:35] Dream. For they prophesy how falsely
[1:56:38] unto you in my name. I have not sent
[1:56:41] them says what? What? The Lord your God.
[1:56:45] Let's go to verse uh 10. For thus says
[1:56:48] the Lord that what? After 70 years.
[1:56:52] After 70 years. In other word, God
[1:56:55] already prophesy 70 years.
[1:57:00] Amen. So when they went into Babylon,
[1:57:04] some people got a super faith,
[1:57:09] they say, "Oh Lord, no,
[1:57:12] no, we believe God is alive. We believe
[1:57:16] Jehovah is working. So let's pray so
[1:57:19] that in two years we can come out of
[1:57:21] this." And they begin to pray. They
[1:57:23] begin to pray. They pray so much until
[1:57:26] it cause dreams.
[1:57:30] This is what the Bible says.
[1:57:32] Am I saying something? Under captivity,
[1:57:36] we do a lot of stuff until we can even
[1:57:40] fabricate vision
[1:57:43] because you trying to come out of it.
[1:57:45] God came, he say, eh, don't listen to
[1:57:48] that.
[1:57:51] There is a purpose why you here.
[1:57:54] There is a time why you here. There is a
[1:57:56] season why you here. I know when I'm
[1:57:59] going to take you out
[1:58:02] after 70 years whether you dream. Come
[1:58:06] on, brother. Amen. Amen. Okay, let me
[1:58:11] continue because uh somebody have not
[1:58:13] gotten it yet. Let's go to verse 10. For
[1:58:16] thy s that what? After 70 years be what?
[1:58:20] Accomplish that Babylon. Uh-huh. I will
[1:58:22] do what? I will visit you. Do you need
[1:58:24] to pray? So come on. After 70 years,
[1:58:29] after 70 years, whether you are dead or
[1:58:31] not, God is coming down.
[1:58:34] Not because of you, because of his own
[1:58:37] purpose.
[1:58:39] Are we together? Amen. I will visit you
[1:58:41] and do what? Perform my good word toward
[1:58:44] you. So the good word toward you will be
[1:58:47] fulfilled when after 70 years. After 70
[1:58:51] years in causing you to do what? Return
[1:58:54] to this place. to return to this place.
[1:58:57] For I know that's it. That's it. Now we
[1:59:01] clear. In other words, God had a purpose
[1:59:05] for Israel to remain 70 years. God knew
[1:59:09] that it's important for Israel to stay
[1:59:13] four years. In other words, I I know why
[1:59:15] I'm keeping you there. Amen. You are
[1:59:19] fighting to come out, but I know
[1:59:24] I know why I sent you to Egypt. I'm
[1:59:27] waiting for Herod to die.
[1:59:30] But you want to go back to Israel. You
[1:59:32] get killed.
[1:59:34] I know.
[1:59:37] For I know what the thoughts that I
[1:59:40] think toward you, say the Lord. Thoughts
[1:59:42] of what? Peace and water. And not of
[1:59:44] evil. To give you what? an expected end.
[1:59:47] You understand this? Now watch verse uh
[1:59:50] verse 12. Then shall you what? Call upon
[1:59:53] me. In other words, at that time your
[1:59:55] prayer are going green light. Yes sir.
[1:59:59] At this time your prayer are on red
[2:00:01] light. Amen.
[2:00:03] I don't know if you're getting what I'm
[2:00:04] saying. You praying I'm listening but I
[2:00:07] cannot answer you now because I know
[2:00:10] what is good for you.
[2:00:13] But after 70 years, you will think like
[2:00:17] you got more anointing.
[2:00:19] Amen.
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] But it's just the season have changed.
[2:00:25] Amen. Now everything is working. Amen.
[2:00:28] Today it seems like it's not working.
[2:00:30] Amen. Because I know but what I know is
[2:00:34] not evil.
[2:00:35] Amen. It is a thought of peace to give
[2:00:38] you an expected end. Amen. In other
[2:00:41] words, even though you in the midst of
[2:00:43] captivity, even though you are in the
[2:00:45] midst of evil, but what I'm doing is for
[2:00:49] good. This is what God is saying. Verse
[2:00:52] 12, then shall you call unto me and
[2:00:55] what? And shall go and pray unto me. And
[2:00:57] pray unto me, and I will do what? unto
[2:01:00] you.
[2:01:02] So if you pray in captivity to come out,
[2:01:05] will you receive an answer? No. Are we
[2:01:07] clear? Are we clear? Amen. Let's start
[2:01:11] climbing now. I praise God. Now, Brother
[2:01:16] Brham says this. He says, I ask him for
[2:01:19] something sometime. He does what? He
[2:01:21] shakes his head. Now, you begin to
[2:01:23] understand this. And he says what? He
[2:01:25] shakes his head. No. He says, "No." I
[2:01:29] just rejoice so much about that as I
[2:01:31] can. If he says what? Yes. Because now
[2:01:33] you begin to understand the purpose of
[2:01:35] God for your life. Please buckle up.
[2:01:37] Let's stay tight together. Amen. Because
[2:01:40] we always ought to ask what? Thy will be
[2:01:43] done. We will get to that, my friend.
[2:01:46] His nose, if that is his will, it is a
[2:01:50] whole lot of better than what? Yes. If
[2:01:52] it is what? In his will to do it. That
[2:01:55] is when you really do what? Love him.
[2:01:57] Amen. Amen. Then brother Brandham
[2:02:00] continue here in another message. He
[2:02:02] says, "And let's remember why we are
[2:02:05] obeying the spirit water." One great
[2:02:07] lesson that we that we want to learn is
[2:02:11] never be what? Hastily. In other words,
[2:02:13] never be in hurry.
[2:02:17] We want to come out of Babylon. No, no,
[2:02:19] no, no. I know. Are we together? See, do
[2:02:23] what? Take your time. And what? Have
[2:02:25] faith. Take your time means be patient.
[2:02:31] Are we together? You are slowing me
[2:02:34] down. Amen. Take your time. Amen. Take
[2:02:37] your time. Take your time.
[2:02:40] Means be patient. Go slow, my friend.
[2:02:44] And if you notice, brother Brandham
[2:02:46] said, "Take your time." And he says
[2:02:47] what? Have faith. He says, "Take your
[2:02:50] time and have
[2:02:52] faith." There is a reason why God allow
[2:02:56] brother Brham to speak like that. Yes
[2:02:59] sir. Amen. By saying take your time and
[2:03:02] say have faith because it is faith that
[2:03:07] will help you take your time.
[2:03:11] Please buckle up. Buckle up as I'm
[2:03:14] moving forward. The Bible says this in
[2:03:17] second
[2:03:19] Thessalonian verse chapter 1 verse4. The
[2:03:22] Bible said that so that we what
[2:03:25] ourselves do what? Glory in you in the
[2:03:28] churches of what? God for your patience
[2:03:32] and what? Faith. Paul say I glory in you
[2:03:35] that church. Amen. Because you are a
[2:03:37] church that have patience and faith.
[2:03:40] Yes. Why do you need patience and faith?
[2:03:44] He say in all your what? Persecution and
[2:03:47] what? And tribulation that you die you
[2:03:49] do what? Endure. So faith with patience
[2:03:52] will bring endurance. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[2:03:56] Yes sir. I'm trying to help you my
[2:03:58] friend. If you want to endure
[2:04:01] persecution,
[2:04:03] if you want to endure hardship, if you
[2:04:07] want to endure tribulation, there is an
[2:04:09] ingredient that you want to have, you
[2:04:12] need to have patience and faith. So that
[2:04:17] even when you struggling in piper house,
[2:04:20] when you struggling in the prison, when
[2:04:22] you struggling in the in in the pit,
[2:04:25] patience and faith of faith toward the
[2:04:29] purpose of God
[2:04:32] will keep your morale up.
[2:04:36] It will keep your nose out of the water.
[2:04:41] Are we together? Do you follow me? Amen.
[2:04:45] The Bible says in Hebrews 6 verse uh 12
[2:04:49] that be ye not what slothful but what
[2:04:53] followers of who? Of them who through
[2:04:56] faith and what patience did what?
[2:04:59] Inherit the promises. They inherit the
[2:05:01] promise. How faith and what? Patience.
[2:05:05] So if you want to inherit something from
[2:05:07] God you need to have what? Faith and
[2:05:10] what? Patience. Because if you don't
[2:05:12] have faith and patience, you will let
[2:05:14] the thing go.
[2:05:17] But faith keep you in the
[2:05:19] destination. And patience help you to
[2:05:22] hold on knowing that God won't lie. God
[2:05:27] will bring it in the appropriate time.
[2:05:33] I hope somebody's getting consolation.
[2:05:36] I pray for my child. It seems like he's
[2:05:38] not changing. You need faith and
[2:05:41] patience.
[2:05:43] Faith because God answers prayer.
[2:05:46] Patience is keeping you with time. Amen.
[2:05:51] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:05:54] Oh, glory to God. In the book of James
[2:05:57] 1:3, the Bible say, "Knowing what?" This
[2:06:01] knowing what?
[2:06:04] That what? The trying of your faith. The
[2:06:07] trying what? Of your faith. So you
[2:06:10] already have faith, but the trying your
[2:06:12] faith and the trying of your faith do
[2:06:15] what? Workketh patience. In other words,
[2:06:17] faith will birth. Yes. Yes. Yes. When
[2:06:21] you squeeze faith, faith goes in birth.
[2:06:25] Take your time.
[2:06:29] You are slowing me my friend. True
[2:06:32] faith,
[2:06:34] true faith has a pregnancy.
[2:06:39] Are we together?
[2:06:42] True faith have a pregnancy.
[2:06:45] Faith always carry a baby. And that baby
[2:06:49] is called patience.
[2:06:53] Are we together? Shake somebody, my
[2:06:56] friend. We need to stay focused. We need
[2:06:59] to stay focused, my friend. So, let's
[2:07:00] focus together. True faith carry
[2:07:04] patience as a baby. So when you begin to
[2:07:08] squeeze faith, you are squeezing faith,
[2:07:11] you give him birth pain. Faith will
[2:07:15] deliver patience.
[2:07:21] You are believing God for something. You
[2:07:24] want to know if you have faith. What if
[2:07:27] you have patience for what you ask for?
[2:07:30] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. If you if you ask
[2:07:34] God for something, Uh-huh. And you still
[2:07:37] anxious all the time, you don't have
[2:07:39] faith yet.
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:45] If you ask God, give me a husband. And
[2:07:48] every man that come, you don't have
[2:07:50] faith yet. When faith will kick in, you
[2:07:54] don't worry about man, man will worry
[2:07:57] about you.
[2:08:02] Are we together? Are we together? When
[2:08:05] somebody watches you and say, "Is
[2:08:06] everything okay?" You say, "Yes, I'm
[2:08:08] good." Yes, sir. All is well. You have
[2:08:11] any concern? Because faith has already
[2:08:14] produced.
[2:08:16] Are we together? Because faith and
[2:08:19] patience will help you inherit the
[2:08:21] promises. It will help you endure the
[2:08:24] tribulation
[2:08:26] and the persecution
[2:08:28] knowing that God is faithful.
[2:08:31] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:08:34] But do what? Let patience do what? Have
[2:08:38] her perfect work. Uh-huh. That she may
[2:08:40] be how? Perfect. And what? And tired.
[2:08:43] Wanting what? Nothing.
[2:08:45] In other words, when patience come,
[2:08:47] patience will make sure you get what you
[2:08:50] asking for. What you waiting for? So
[2:08:52] that you won't lack anything. So if you
[2:08:55] take faith and couple it with patience,
[2:08:58] you are guaranteed to receive what
[2:09:00] you're looking for.
[2:09:03] Because if time is taking longer,
[2:09:05] patience is telling you,
[2:09:10] patience is there to remind you, hold
[2:09:12] on. Hold on. Chill out. Everything is
[2:09:16] good. And faith say, look over there.
[2:09:18] It's coming. We're getting closer. We're
[2:09:20] getting closer. And patience say, wait,
[2:09:22] wait, wait. Keep patient. Keep keep
[2:09:24] being chill out. You need those two
[2:09:27] together. Are we together? Are we
[2:09:30] together? That's why brother Brham even
[2:09:32] said that fa patience is an outcome of
[2:09:35] faith.
[2:09:37] I have the quote my friend brother in
[2:09:40] the exposition of the church ages in the
[2:09:43] tatarian church he says now faithfulness
[2:09:46] and what patience goes how together
[2:09:51] the bible says this in the book of James
[2:09:54] behold we count them who happy which did
[2:09:58] what endured
[2:10:01] he's happy look how he is he's happy
[2:10:04] yeah he's happy because he endured
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:09] Amen. You don't know the suffering he
[2:10:11] went through before he became happy.
[2:10:17] All you see is he's happy. Brother John
[2:10:20] Paul is good. You don't know what
[2:10:23] brother John Paul went through.
[2:10:25] You don't know what brother Charles Sior
[2:10:28] went through. You don't know what sister
[2:10:31] went through.
[2:10:33] You don't know the 14 years she
[2:10:35] suffered. Yes. But you count her happy
[2:10:38] today.
[2:10:39] Because somebody endure.
[2:10:42] Are we together? Ye have heard of what?
[2:10:46] The patience of Job.
[2:10:48] Oh my Jesus. The patience of who? Of
[2:10:50] Job. You know the story, right? And have
[2:10:53] seen what? The end of the Lord. The end
[2:10:55] is an expected end. That the Lord is
[2:10:58] very what? Pitiful and what? And of
[2:11:00] tender mercy. But the God of all grace
[2:11:03] who has called us unto what? His eternal
[2:11:06] glory. So you are called into what type
[2:11:08] of glory? Eternal glory. By who? Christ
[2:11:11] Jesus. After that you have suffered for
[2:11:14] a while.
[2:11:16] God will make you how? Perfect. And
[2:11:18] what? Establish. And what? Strengthen.
[2:11:20] And what? Settle you.
[2:11:23] [Applause]
[2:11:28] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:11:32] together? And brother say, see, take
[2:11:35] your time and do what? Have faith. If we
[2:11:37] ask God for what? Anything. Remember
[2:11:40] what God answers prayer. He does it when
[2:11:44] in his time. How? The way it's best.
[2:11:46] Make what just right for who? Us.
[2:11:51] Because God is under a principle. And
[2:11:54] the principle is in Ecclesiastes 3. your
[2:11:59] everything there is a what a season and
[2:12:01] a time to water every purpose where
[2:12:04] under the heaven. If you are still
[2:12:06] living in this world if you are on this
[2:12:09] earth right here just know that there is
[2:12:12] a principle everything has a season.
[2:12:16] Every purpose have a time. If you
[2:12:19] understand this
[2:12:22] you will remove all the trouble that you
[2:12:24] have in your Christian life. Amen. Last
[2:12:27] Sunday we saw that God purpose can what?
[2:12:30] Never be defeated. There is nothing can
[2:12:32] do what? Defeated. So how what happy
[2:12:35] ought we to be today. Uhhuh. Resting
[2:12:38] upon that beautiful revelation which is
[2:12:40] what? Of the word of the living God.
[2:12:42] Uhhuh. That there is neither things
[2:12:44] present. Uhhuh. Nor things that can
[2:12:46] come. Uhhuh. There's no sickness. I
[2:12:47] won't commenting this anymore. And what?
[2:12:49] No sorrow. And what? No death and water.
[2:12:51] No peril. Or what? Nor nothing can what
[2:12:54] separate us from what? the purpose of
[2:12:57] the living God. And we found out that
[2:12:59] you and your purpose are one. Amen.
[2:13:02] That's right, brother. Are we together?
[2:13:04] What God has what? Imagined in his mind.
[2:13:07] And what God has what? Purposed in his
[2:13:10] heart to do what? To bring to pass.
[2:13:11] There is what? No demon. Glory to God.
[2:13:15] No Reuben, no Judah,
[2:13:18] no brother in this message.
[2:13:21] No preacher in the
[2:13:23] message. No family member,
[2:13:27] no demon, there is what? No power there
[2:13:29] is nothing can what ever separate God
[2:13:32] from great God's great what immortal
[2:13:36] plan eternal plan it must be as God has
[2:13:40] said are we together are we together
[2:13:44] brother Brandham says this my friend in
[2:13:46] the future home he says you were made
[2:13:49] for an eternal purpose
[2:13:54] eternal purpose not just a purpose
[2:13:57] eternal eternal Not just the purpose.
[2:14:01] Some people will disappear in the lake
[2:14:04] of fire.
[2:14:06] The lake of fire is to clean up
[2:14:10] everything that is not out of God. You
[2:14:13] will never see them from eternity. But
[2:14:16] some people won't be clean because their
[2:14:19] purpose is eternal.
[2:14:21] Amen. They are gods.
[2:14:24] Amen. Amen. Because you was I'm reading
[2:14:28] brother Brandham so keep your English in
[2:14:30] school. Because you was the what? The
[2:14:34] manifestation of an attribute that was
[2:14:37] where in God that thoughts of you and
[2:14:41] did what expressed to you. So you are an
[2:14:44] attribute of God
[2:14:48] we coming somewhere and he made what?
[2:14:51] Earth to take you out of it and to make
[2:14:54] you water a human being and sin come
[2:14:56] along and pervaded water his way you
[2:14:59] come anyhow but you was lost with water
[2:15:02] the world so he came he come and redeem
[2:15:06] you the express water added attribute
[2:15:09] and also redeem this earth we will get
[2:15:11] to that later this earth by the same way
[2:15:15] then his purpose does what rolls on see
[2:15:18] oh
[2:15:20] hallelujah Oh, that does me so much good
[2:15:24] to fix just what lays out.
[2:15:28] What is getting brother Brandham so
[2:15:30] excited?
[2:15:32] Why is brother Brandham so excited?
[2:15:34] Because the key is this my friend.
[2:15:37] Brother Brandham say being eternal with
[2:15:39] him
[2:15:41] with God when at the beginning the
[2:15:45] eternal life that you had
[2:15:48] not that you have no that you had in the
[2:15:52] past he's what thought of what you was
[2:15:55] of what you was only he wanted you he
[2:15:58] wanted me to stand where in the pulpit
[2:16:01] say he wanted you to sit where in the
[2:16:04] seat tonight then we are doing what
[2:16:06] serving serving his eternal purpose and
[2:16:08] one that left home only come to the
[2:16:12] earth to do what? Serve his purpose. Is
[2:16:14] that right? Is that right? All right.
[2:16:18] Then after it is what? Finished. It is
[2:16:21] brought back in the what? Glorified
[2:16:23] state. It's mature and brought back
[2:16:25] what? Again.
[2:16:28] When you left heaven, come on, brother.
[2:16:31] You left heaven as a touch. That's
[2:16:34] right. That's right.
[2:16:36] Brother. Yes, sir.
[2:16:39] Together, brother. But you will never go
[2:16:41] to heaven. Come on. The same way you
[2:16:44] came on earth. No, sir. You will go to
[2:16:46] heaven in a glorified state.
[2:16:50] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Lord.
[2:16:55] Are we together? No. Open Rom 8.
[2:16:59] Because we need to clarify this. We're
[2:17:02] moving on, my friend. Let's go to Roman
[2:17:05] 8. If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:17:08] Oh, glory to God.
[2:17:13] Roman 8 verse 23. Very familiar. You
[2:17:16] there? You are going in a glorified
[2:17:20] state. In other words, you won't go to
[2:17:22] heaven the same way you came out. Yes.
[2:17:25] Amen. You came out unglorified,
[2:17:28] but you are going out back to heaven
[2:17:30] glorified. In other words, when you
[2:17:32] enter heaven, the angel sees you
[2:17:34] different. They say, "Is this you?" He
[2:17:37] say, "I'm back
[2:17:40] in a glorified state."
[2:17:43] Why?
[2:17:44] Roman
[2:17:46] 8:28. For who
[2:17:48] knows? Roman 8:28. For who knows? And we
[2:17:54] know that what? All things work together
[2:17:57] for good to them that do what? Love God.
[2:17:59] And to them who are called according to
[2:18:01] what his purpose. So there is a purpose
[2:18:04] already. Verse 29. For whom he did what?
[2:18:07] For no in heaven. Right. He also did
[2:18:10] what? Predestinated to be what?
[2:18:12] Conformed to what? To the image of his
[2:18:15] son. That he might be the what? The
[2:18:17] firstborn among many brethren. Ah
[2:18:19] because we got a a a stature of a
[2:18:22] perfect man. We all will become that.
[2:18:25] Amen. Are we together? Verse 30.
[2:18:27] Moreover, whom he did what?
[2:18:30] Predestinate, he did what? He also
[2:18:32] called. Continue. And whom he called, he
[2:18:34] did what? He also justified. And what?
[2:18:37] And whom he justified, he did what? Then
[2:18:39] he also glorified. Verse 31. What shall
[2:18:42] we say then to this thing? If God be
[2:18:44] what? For us. Who can be what? Against
[2:18:47] us. In other words, the purpose of God
[2:18:49] is glorification.
[2:18:52] Everything is just a process.
[2:18:55] So you won't go back until you are
[2:18:58] glorified. And if we already know this,
[2:19:01] who can be against us?
[2:19:05] In other words, who can come against
[2:19:07] God's purpose for your life?
[2:19:13] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:19:16] Brother says
[2:19:18] this, may you take me to record this
[2:19:22] morning, friend, that there is what
[2:19:25] isn't enough. There is not enough power
[2:19:28] in all hell that can ever defeat the
[2:19:32] purpose of God.
[2:19:37] God will do it how? Anyhow, he said,
[2:19:41] "I'm sure of this tonight, my
[2:19:43] Pentecostal who friends, Methodist, and
[2:19:46] who?" Baptist and whatever you may be,
[2:19:49] if you stand still long enough
[2:19:54] and don't get what? Flustered. Stand
[2:19:57] how? Still, God will reveal his divine
[2:20:01] purpose to you.
[2:20:04] Do what? Get quiet. Get quiet and get
[2:20:08] still before him. Stand still and God
[2:20:11] will talk to you. Amen. Yes, he will.
[2:20:15] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:20:18] Brother Brandham says this. We have
[2:20:21] heard the Easter story last Sunday over
[2:20:25] and over and read it back and forth. And
[2:20:29] today on your radio last Sunday
[2:20:31] broadcast you hear different ministers
[2:20:35] even in the message approaching it
[2:20:37] because it's Easter. But what I thought
[2:20:40] for my leader group this morning the
[2:20:43] Lord has given me I would approach it
[2:20:46] from a different standpoint
[2:20:49] if I could come to a place of it in
[2:20:53] Easter everybody's preaching the
[2:20:56] resurrection of Jesus Christ. Brother
[2:20:58] Brandham say for me
[2:21:01] instead of every Easter I have to preach
[2:21:04] you an Easter message until it become a
[2:21:08] traditional
[2:21:10] [Music]
[2:21:11] glory
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:16] it is Easter the Holy Spirit is telling
[2:21:19] you do A but the people in the message
[2:21:22] got used to a B. You must bring a B
[2:21:25] message or you not preaching Easter.
[2:21:28] Brother Brandham say for me I'm going to
[2:21:30] do something different.
[2:21:34] Are we together? Instead of preaching to
[2:21:37] you the resurrection
[2:21:40] of Jesus Christ which is important. I'm
[2:21:43] going to preach something different.
[2:21:45] What is it?
[2:21:48] William Marion Brham. Why do we come to
[2:21:52] this trouble? Amen.
[2:21:55] This is what I want to talk about.
[2:21:57] What makes these things come?
[2:22:00] Why should a Christian ever be
[2:22:03] perplexed?
[2:22:06] Why wouldn't not everything just run
[2:22:09] perfect for a Christian? But he doesn't
[2:22:11] and we know it.
[2:22:14] God say, "I have the talle peace and not
[2:22:17] for evil." But we all know right here we
[2:22:21] going through things.
[2:22:23] Why?
[2:22:26] Glory to God. Where is the thought of
[2:22:28] peace?
[2:22:30] Where is the thought that are not evil?
[2:22:32] Amen. Because what I'm experiencing is
[2:22:35] evil. Open your ears please.
[2:22:39] Spoken word and listen to me carefully.
[2:22:41] Amen. Brother say, "And sometime we have
[2:22:45] more trouble
[2:22:47] when we become Christian than we did
[2:22:50] when we were sinners."
[2:22:54] That's the truth, brother. Amen. That's
[2:22:57] exactly right.
[2:23:00] I was not expecting this.
[2:23:05] I was not expecting this. I suffered so
[2:23:07] much, brother Stephen. You don't know
[2:23:09] what I suffered. Listen to me carefully
[2:23:11] my friend. He said cause it is written
[2:23:14] what? Many of afflictions of righteous.
[2:23:18] It is written in your Bible. These
[2:23:20] verses we don't want to read them. We
[2:23:22] will flip them and go to Psalm 23. The
[2:23:27] Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
[2:23:35] Are we together? Brother say many is the
[2:23:38] affliction of what? The righteous but
[2:23:41] God
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:45] deliver him from some of them. No from
[2:23:48] them all.
[2:23:50] If you know you going to deliver me, why
[2:23:52] do you allow it?
[2:23:54] Yes sir. Are we together? Brother Brham
[2:23:58] say God promise.
[2:24:01] That's it.
[2:24:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:24:12] Can you read? God promised many
[2:24:16] blessing.
[2:24:18] Pentecostal.
[2:24:19] God promised many what? Afflictions.
[2:24:23] How? Strange feelings and what? Strange
[2:24:26] things that will be beyond what? Our
[2:24:28] understanding. But it's always done for
[2:24:32] our good. Amen.
[2:24:35] Amen.
[2:24:38] Amen. I know I know the pain you going
[2:24:41] through, but I got to give you the
[2:24:43] medication.
[2:24:45] When I want to fix your tooth, the
[2:24:47] needle hurt. So, let this needle hurt.
[2:24:51] Then I'm going to fix your tooth. Amen.
[2:24:54] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:24:58] together? Brother Brandham say we can't
[2:25:00] just understand it because if we did
[2:25:04] Amen. Then it will not be a faith to us.
[2:25:09] We will go on with what? Understanding.
[2:25:14] This brand here love to understand
[2:25:17] everything.
[2:25:20] This brand here,
[2:25:24] what is the point?
[2:25:26] What are you saying? You see what I'm
[2:25:28] saying? You understand what I mean? You
[2:25:31] understand what I'm saying? Because the
[2:25:33] brain want to understand. But if you
[2:25:36] understand everything, you are killing
[2:25:39] faith.
[2:25:43] And God don't want us to lean to our own
[2:25:47] understanding. That's right.
[2:25:52] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:25:54] Amen. But God want to develop your
[2:25:57] faith. Because faith can create. Yes, it
[2:26:00] can. Your brain cannot create. No sir.
[2:26:03] When you die, your knowledge dies with
[2:26:06] you. That's exactly right.
[2:26:09] But your faith never dies. No sir. Are
[2:26:12] we together, brother? Brother say, but
[2:26:16] we do and we have it and we believe by
[2:26:19] what? Faith. What? His word. That it's
[2:26:21] going to work. How some some good thing
[2:26:24] for us. If we could grasp that when
[2:26:27] today when? This morning. If we could
[2:26:30] grasp that all of our what troubles and
[2:26:33] there is none of us immune from them
[2:26:36] even Jesus Christ and if we could
[2:26:38] realize that those things are for what
[2:26:41] are good
[2:26:44] brother Stephen I understand what you're
[2:26:46] saying but
[2:26:49] I don't know I just saying amen because
[2:26:52] we just need to say amen are we together
[2:26:56] are we together oh I'm saying what you
[2:26:59] don't want to say it loudly. Now look
[2:27:01] what God did. Follow me my friend. And
[2:27:04] then you shall love him.
[2:27:08] This is what I was waiting. Then you
[2:27:10] shall go home and in the morning you
[2:27:13] sleep a little late and you shall love
[2:27:15] him more than ever.
[2:27:18] Ah brother still brotherham tell me
[2:27:20] that. That's what I have been waiting
[2:27:22] all my life. What is that revelation?
[2:27:26] God is a contractor.
[2:27:30] That's all. Yes, sir. I thought you
[2:27:32] going to come up with something bigger.
[2:27:34] God is a contractor. And then I'm going
[2:27:36] to be in peace because you told me God
[2:27:38] is a contractor. Follow me, my friend.
[2:27:41] Follow me. God is what? Contractor. How

[2:28:14] Brham how did he ever permit the devil
[2:28:16] to make sin

[2:28:36] religious oh my he knew
[2:28:41] before the devil was created that he
[2:28:44] will be what the devil now you ask what
[2:28:47] about that what is fancy about it
[2:28:50] brother Stephen you say why did he let
[2:28:52] him be the devil that he be proven to be
[2:28:57] God. That is why he did it. Hallelujah.
[2:29:01] Why was there ever unrighteousness? Why?
[2:29:05] You ready? And here is the answer.
[2:29:09] God has an expectation.
[2:29:13] You following me? Amen. God knows what
[2:29:15] is going to happen because he's how?
[2:29:18] Infinite. So there is nothing going
[2:29:21] wrong. If all is going just exactly
[2:29:24] right because he's water infinite and he
[2:29:27] can foretell the end from what? The
[2:29:29] beginning because he's water. God, don't
[2:29:32] think Satan is putting anything on him.
[2:29:35] Oh no. Oh no. It's just what all working
[2:29:39] out to display what? His attributes is
[2:29:43] all. How could a great infinite God who
[2:29:46] knows everything and let everything it's
[2:29:49] just the attribute of God being what?
[2:29:52] Display. And you are displaying what?
[2:29:54] Your life to one side or what? The
[2:29:57] other. Brother Steven, we finished these
[2:30:00] three quotes. And you say something that
[2:30:03] I was expecting something good to come
[2:30:05] out of it, but it's just normal. What
[2:30:08] are you trying to say with this thing?
[2:30:10] This is the point. Are we together?
[2:30:13] Amen.
[2:30:15] When God think follow me now. The
[2:30:19] thoughts of God are for peace.
[2:30:24] And not for evil.
[2:30:27] The thoughts of God are for Joseph to
[2:30:29] rule.
[2:30:31] Joseph to reign. Joseph to save much
[2:30:34] life. Are we together? And it's an
[2:30:38] expression of an attribute of God. Yes.
[2:30:42] Are we together? But when that project
[2:30:46] is launched,
[2:30:48] do you follow me? That project cannot
[2:30:52] develop
[2:30:54] without certain things.
[2:30:58] Break it down. Break it down. It is the
[2:31:00] good thoughts that actually attract
[2:31:05] evil.
[2:31:06] [Applause]
[2:31:09] Come on, Lord.
[2:31:11] I'm giving you time, my friend. I know
[2:31:14] it's hard. I'm giving you time to ease
[2:31:16] up this thing and get it, my friend.
[2:31:19] Amen. Can I Can I repeat it again? It is
[2:31:23] the good plan of God, the good purpose
[2:31:26] of God for you that actually bring the
[2:31:30] trouble.
[2:31:34] Jesus, speak. I'm going slowly for you.
[2:31:39] I don't know if you getting me. She
[2:31:41] said, "Me, we there
[2:31:44] we there." And she said, "No." So, let
[2:31:46] me repeat it again. My my sister, it is
[2:31:49] the good plan of God. The plan of God
[2:31:54] develop only when there is trouble.
[2:32:03] I'm giving you time. God can never be a
[2:32:06] healer.
[2:32:08] [Applause]
[2:32:09] Come on. Come on.
[2:32:17] We
[2:32:18] now if there is no sickness. So when you
[2:32:22] say God is a healer, healer must attract
[2:32:26] sickness.
[2:32:27] [Applause]
[2:32:31] I hope we are okay. God cannot be a
[2:32:34] deliverer if everything is good. It is
[2:32:38] the attribute of God that call for
[2:32:42] trouble.
[2:32:44] Yes sir.
[2:32:46] Church, I'm taking you to another level.
[2:32:50] I don't know if you're getting me. It is
[2:32:52] the dream of Joseph that cause hatred.
[2:32:59] Come on. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:33:02] Are we together? But hatred is important
[2:33:07] to develop
[2:33:09] Joseph dream. It is hatred that put
[2:33:13] Joseph in the right lane.
[2:33:17] Amen.
[2:33:21] Amen.
[2:33:22] I know this is hard but we are not
[2:33:26] Pentecostal babies. Hallelujah. The
[2:33:28] angel said, "Do not teach Pentecostal,
[2:33:31] baby, spiritual things." I'm talking to
[2:33:34] message believer.
[2:33:36] [Applause]
[2:33:38] No hatred, no Egypt.
[2:33:42] Yes, sir.
[2:33:44] Do you do you understand me? Do you
[2:33:46] understand me? Do you understand me?
[2:33:49] When Joseph got in Egypt, Podify pick
[2:33:52] him up and put him in his house. And
[2:33:56] Pifa begin to love him more. And the
[2:33:59] love of Pifa was a blockage to Joseph.
[2:34:11] Big boss. We good? Yes sir. Are we
[2:34:14] together? Yes sir. Are we together? If I
[2:34:18] keep Joseph, he will never reach his
[2:34:22] purpose.
[2:34:23] Yes sir. I don't know if we together. I
[2:34:27] don't know if we together. In other
[2:34:29] words, the purpose of God in your life
[2:34:33] is what is upsetting the devil all the
[2:34:36] time.
[2:34:38] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Brother Robert, I
[2:34:42] got to spit this out.
[2:34:45] If you don't have no trouble, I wonder
[2:34:49] if you got a purpose.
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:35:00] Brother Robert, there is a little bit
[2:35:02] the spit left. If you don't have no
[2:35:05] trouble, I wonder if you worth
[2:35:08] something.
[2:35:14] [Applause]
[2:35:16] But if you are somebody, that's why the
[2:35:19] devil hate you.
[2:35:25] Glory, glory, glory, glory. Are we
[2:35:27] together? Are we together? In other
[2:35:30] word, the purpose and you are what?
[2:35:34] So when Joseph is there at home, the
[2:35:38] purpose of God is watching Joseph life.
[2:35:41] That's exactly right. He's protected by
[2:35:43] his father. So his father would never
[2:35:46] understand this. Mama love him to death.
[2:35:50] Mom is boy and the purpose look the
[2:35:52] purpose look he say I'm I'm block I need
[2:35:56] to go to Egypt but there's too much love
[2:35:59] here too much blessing too much blessing
[2:36:02] today court of many color today this
[2:36:05] this the purpose say get a dream
[2:36:09] and he put up the dream in a way to
[2:36:12] cause trouble that's right that's right
[2:36:14] that's right I don't know if we together
[2:36:16] this is a m a major surgery Yes, I'm in
[2:36:20] the heart surgery, my friend. So when
[2:36:22] the trouble comes and Joseph begin to
[2:36:25] cry, the purpose is jubilating.
[2:36:28] Like now I'm going.
[2:36:31] Praise the Lord. That's what I was
[2:36:34] waiting for.
[2:36:35] [Applause]
[2:36:38] Suddenly they say, "Let's take him.
[2:36:41] Let's sell him to Egypt." The people
[2:36:43] say, "Oh, finally God, you heard my my
[2:36:45] prayer." And over there, Joseph
[2:36:50] And the purpose
[2:36:52] say my name is in the book the book of
[2:36:55] man life. Are we together? I'm giving
[2:36:59] that so you understand. Are we together?
[2:37:02] When he reach Egypt in piper house
[2:37:05] everything comfortable they love him.
[2:37:08] Promotion promotion after promotion
[2:37:11] until he became the second CEO.
[2:37:17] Everything moving good. The people say
[2:37:22] I don't see any podify house inheritance
[2:37:25] here. This house is not your position.
[2:37:29] You were not supposed to be second to
[2:37:31] pify.
[2:37:33] You were supposed to be second to
[2:37:34] Pharaoh.
[2:37:38] So the purpose
[2:37:40] begin to send some stuff
[2:37:44] and suddenly the boss woman say that boy
[2:37:47] look cute.
[2:37:52] [Applause]
[2:37:54] Do you do you do you follow me? Do you
[2:37:57] follow me? He was the purpose that did
[2:37:59] that.
[2:38:01] And suddenly he got in trouble.
[2:38:04] It looks like a child that was cursed,
[2:38:08] but you not cursed.
[2:38:10] Your purpose is pulling trouble
[2:38:14] and using the trouble to put you in the
[2:38:17] right place.
[2:38:22] [Applause]
[2:38:26] I have not even started with Lazarus.
[2:38:29] Where we stop? Listen to me.
[2:38:32] Their purpose stop and look and say he
[2:38:36] need to interpret the true dreams of
[2:38:40] Pharaoh's officer because this gift need
[2:38:43] to be known
[2:38:45] and the purpose look at Pharaoh officer
[2:38:48] they're doing everything good in Pharaoh
[2:38:51] the purpose say no problem so the
[2:38:53] purpose put a drone in Pharaoh's palace
[2:38:57] to watch those two officer
[2:39:02] The day they begin to get in trouble,
[2:39:05] the purpose begin to move right here
[2:39:07] because both of them must meet at the
[2:39:09] prison for a purpose.
[2:39:16] [Applause]
[2:39:18] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:39:22] So when that trouble happened, it pushed
[2:39:24] him toward the prison. What type of
[2:39:26] prison?
[2:39:30] Not a lower type of prison, a higher
[2:39:33] rank prison where the battler and the
[2:39:36] baker are sitting right there. So even
[2:39:39] the future Bible of Jesus Christ. He's
[2:39:43] projecting Jesus Christ and he's also
[2:39:46] projecting Joseph.
[2:39:50] Joseph was enjoying his purpose but his
[2:39:53] purpose was also the purpose of Jesus in
[2:39:55] the future.
[2:39:56] So the purpose, the panoramic view was
[2:40:00] not just Joseph. He was expressing Jesus
[2:40:03] Christ.
[2:40:07] [Applause]
[2:40:08] [Music]
[2:40:09] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:40:13] If Jesus say when you were hungry,
[2:40:17] when I was hungry, you came to give me
[2:40:19] food. How can Jesus say that? Because
[2:40:22] he's not here. You must be hungry. Amen.
[2:40:26] So that you become Jesus to that person.
[2:40:30] So Jesus will say the Jesus Deon that
[2:40:33] you give food
[2:40:35] was fulfilling my scripture.
[2:40:39] [Music]
[2:40:40] Hallelujah. I don't know if you get it
[2:40:43] because God must point somebody that
[2:40:46] they did good to him in the name of
[2:40:48] Jesus.
[2:40:52] I don't know if you're getting me. I
[2:40:54] don't know. So the attribute your
[2:40:57] purpose cannot function without evil.
[2:41:03] [Applause]
[2:41:06] Evil is needed to fuel goods. That's
[2:41:11] exactly right.
[2:41:13] Amen. Amen. How can he be a savior?
[2:41:17] Hallelujah. Everything is good. Nobody
[2:41:20] have ever sin. Right. What is savior
[2:41:23] for? It is the name savior that brought
[2:41:27] sin.
[2:41:32] If God keep savior in himself no sin. If
[2:41:37] God deliver a savior savior say me I
[2:41:41] don't exist without sin. That's what
[2:41:44] cause sin. So your purpose your your
[2:41:46] your your plan cannot be developed
[2:41:50] without trouble.
[2:41:53] The trouble that comes to your life are
[2:41:56] coming based on who you are in your
[2:41:59] purpose.
[2:42:05] Hallelujah. That is true.
[2:42:08] Look at everything in Joseph. Why did he
[2:42:12] only only Pharaoh officer pick him up?
[2:42:16] Why? It was the purpose and that purpose
[2:42:20] took him to a certain prison and they
[2:42:22] put him there and he even beg please
[2:42:25] remember
[2:42:26] me and now when you go remember what I
[2:42:29] say to you. You see everything I I
[2:42:31] display the dream. So put Joseph say at
[2:42:33] this time tomorrow
[2:42:36] I'm going to
[2:42:37] hear Pharaoh need you. It was not time
[2:42:40] yet. Not time yet. In the morning,
[2:42:43] Joseph boom boom boom. He say
[2:42:46] hallelujah. They open they say for your
[2:42:48] food.
[2:42:52] Amen.
[2:42:54] You see people in this world, you see
[2:42:56] people in this world, they are so
[2:42:58] ungrateful.
[2:43:00] You can help them and they will forget
[2:43:02] even what you did for them. There is a
[2:43:05] purpose. You keep doing what is right.
[2:43:14] Don't expect something in return. Look
[2:43:17] out to God.
[2:43:21] [Applause]
[2:43:24] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:43:27] together? Because it's not time for the
[2:43:29] dream yet. The dream will come. And when
[2:43:32] the dream comes in an unexpected time,
[2:43:36] unexpected way, unexpected place, this
[2:43:39] is when they came, they say, "Pharaoh
[2:43:40] need you."
[2:43:43] [Applause]
[2:43:44] The Bible say that man came out and
[2:43:46] forgot. How can you forget something
[2:43:49] that was fulfilled? If I tell you, I
[2:43:51] say, "Brother Charles, tomorrow at your
[2:43:54] job, they're going to give you a
[2:43:55] promotion." And you go tomorrow and it
[2:43:57] happened. Who do you call first?
[2:44:00] Brother Steven. Brother Stephen,
[2:44:02] hallelujah, happened. But this man went,
[2:44:04] he got a promotion and the purpose came
[2:44:07] and say,
[2:44:09] "It's not time yet.
[2:44:11] [Music]
[2:44:13] It's not time yet." But when the dream
[2:44:16] is coming, the paper say now it's time.
[2:44:20] Oh, remember two years. No, there is a
[2:44:24] time, there is a season, there is a
[2:44:27] purpose.
[2:44:31] Yes, Glory to God. Come on, Lord. Are we
[2:44:35] together? Are we together? Can we
[2:44:38] continue? Yes, sir.
[2:44:41] I'm over time.
[2:44:46] I know this is always a mixed multitude
[2:44:49] than this. Yes and no. The nos are
[2:44:53] usually, but I was trying to say quick
[2:44:55] right there. So, let me find a way to
[2:44:57] learn. I have not started in Lazarus
[2:44:59] where we stop. So I'm going to try. Are
[2:45:02] we together? So the key that you take
[2:45:05] here, his thoughts for you are for
[2:45:08] peace, not for evil. But remember that
[2:45:12] thought when they say peace. Don't be
[2:45:15] too much caught up by the name peace.
[2:45:19] Peace means there is trouble.
[2:45:23] Peace will cause trouble. But just know
[2:45:26] it's
[2:45:29] peace. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:45:32] Yes sir. Let me give this illustration.
[2:45:35] Very good.
[2:45:39] Flight attendant prepare for landing.
[2:45:41] Let me give this illustration my friend.
[2:45:44] Can I give this illustration? Can I give
[2:45:46] this illustration?
[2:45:48] You
[2:45:49] know some of you were here when we show
[2:45:54] what we trying to build outside.
[2:45:57] Did you see how beautiful that was?
[2:45:59] Beautiful. Say,
[2:46:01] "Wow, finally we're going to have some
[2:46:04] of those things up there. I'm on
[2:46:07] YouTube." So, we're going to have some
[2:46:08] of what is behind there. So, we're going
[2:46:11] to have a
[2:46:12] fellowship and we're going to have this.
[2:46:15] It looks beautiful.
[2:46:17] It looks great. When we talked about it,
[2:46:20] we excited. Do you see how much
[2:46:22] excitement we have? Do you see? After
[2:46:24] church, every time after church, where
[2:46:26] you go, we all go in the back.
[2:46:30] We can't wait.
[2:46:32] Amen. But let me give you a different
[2:46:34] view.
[2:46:36] When that picture was given, that
[2:46:39] picture was given as a final product.
[2:46:44] Yes, sir. Amen. It was a big picture.
[2:46:49] But that picture didn't tell you we
[2:46:51] going to cut the ground.
[2:46:54] That beautiful picture was hidden. In
[2:46:57] that beautiful picture was hidden. The
[2:47:00] cutting of the ground, the digging, the
[2:47:04] hammer,
[2:47:06] the building found gone,
[2:47:10] the misunderstanding,
[2:47:13] the impatience.
[2:47:15] Amen.
[2:47:16] dead,
[2:47:18] a mess outside. Now we look messy. All
[2:47:22] of that was in the beautiful picture.
[2:47:28] So when they show you the picture, you
[2:47:30] are excited. Now that God begin to
[2:47:33] develop the picture, it is mercy.
[2:47:37] Look over there. Mercy here. Everything.
[2:47:40] Brother John cannot go over there
[2:47:42] tomorrow and now nothing is working. But
[2:47:45] wait, wait.
[2:47:47] We got a vision. We got a purpose. We
[2:47:51] are moving towards something.
[2:47:53] [Applause]
[2:47:55] Are we together? It is the picture that
[2:47:59] brought the bobcat.
[2:48:01] It is the picture that brought the
[2:48:03] digging. All the trouble and the mess
[2:48:06] and the and the noise and the
[2:48:09] disturbance we have outside is caused by
[2:48:12] the beautiful picture.
[2:48:20] Why the trouble in my life? Why the
[2:48:23] difficulty in my life? Why the messy in
[2:48:26] my life? Now I ask you a question. Does
[2:48:29] it look pretty back there? Do you get
[2:48:32] mad?
[2:48:34] Do you do you get mad? Because you know
[2:48:37] uh some yes, some no. Because you know
[2:48:39] that at the end That's right. It won't
[2:48:42] look like that. Amen.
[2:48:47] Amen. If you keep it clean,
[2:48:51] you will never have that.
[2:48:54] If you keep your life good, perfect
[2:48:57] without trouble, your purpose will never
[2:49:00] be developed. In order to develop the
[2:49:03] purpose, you got to let the hammer come.
[2:49:06] You got to let the chisel come. You got
[2:49:08] to let the cutting, the shaping, the
[2:49:12] everything. Don't worry, it is going
[2:49:15] somewhere. At the end, you will dedicate
[2:49:18] the building.
[2:49:22] [Applause]
[2:49:24] At the end, it will be good.
[2:49:27] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:49:31] together?
[2:49:33] No, I got to stop.
[2:49:36] Amen. Yeah. Let me stop here. Brother
[2:49:40] say it is written in one of the
[2:49:43] scripture in the Bible that the what
[2:49:45] trials are brought upon us are more
[2:49:48] precious
[2:49:51] to us than what gold itself. For it is
[2:49:54] what God giving us these trials after we
[2:49:58] become his what? Property. Our what?
[2:50:00] Confession. Our water. Our baptism. Our
[2:50:03] water. Our promise to walk in the life
[2:50:05] for him. Then every trial that comes
[2:50:08] upon us is to what? Perfect us for his
[2:50:11] glory. It is to bring us to a place
[2:50:15] where God can make himself more real to
[2:50:20] us than he was before the trial come.
[2:50:24] [Applause]
[2:50:33] 40 minutes has been taken before of
[2:50:35] everything that happened, but I'm a
[2:50:38] shepherd. I'm going to stop
[2:50:40] here. So, bear with me. We need to pick
[2:50:42] up Lazarus next Sunday where we stop and
[2:50:45] move on. What is a take-h home
[2:50:51] message? What is a take-h home message?
[2:50:58] You want to be a doctor?
[2:51:00] Great idea.
[2:51:03] Everybody happy. Mama look say I have a
[2:51:06] smart boy.
[2:51:08] You know daddy I'm so chill. He came out
[2:51:11] from
[2:51:12] himself and the boy goes to the hospital
[2:51:15] and he's
[2:51:16] mesmerized by how the doctor
[2:51:19] coming this this this nerve optical
[2:51:23] nerve and then trigramment on earth and
[2:51:25] he's
[2:51:26] like tomorrow it's me later did you know
[2:51:32] to develop that picture the name doctor
[2:51:36] called for suffering of
[2:51:38] study sir called for no sleep. Call for
[2:51:42] pressure. Call for no vacation.
[2:51:46] Call for no entertainment. No hanging
[2:51:49] around. Cooped up in the room with a
[2:51:52] bunch of books until you cannot read
[2:51:54] anything. That goes with the name
[2:51:57] doctor.
[2:51:59] You want to develop that picture, you
[2:52:00] must take that in. Amen. But if you take
[2:52:03] that in actually whatever pain is coming
[2:52:06] with it, it's actually the
[2:52:08] development of the picture. You want a
[2:52:11] baby, a baby looks cute. But wait for
[2:52:14] the morning sickness. Wait for the
[2:52:17] clinging on the stair. Wait for you
[2:52:19] cannot sleep the way you were sleeping
[2:52:20] before. Wait for a change in diet. If
[2:52:24] you don't want that one, there's no
[2:52:25] baby. But when the baby comes, you
[2:52:28] forget everything else that was in the
[2:52:30] back. Your purpose in life is what bring
[2:52:34] whatever is going on.
[2:52:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. So now Satan is
[2:52:42] working for you. Amen. Yes sir. Satan is
[2:52:47] working for you.
[2:52:51] [Applause]
[2:52:53] When Satan comes, you say, "Hey buddy, I
[2:52:57] believe it's time to work on my purpose
[2:52:59] again. Glory of God.
[2:53:02] Amen. Because I needed you. Where were
[2:53:04] you all this time? I need to go quickly
[2:53:07] where God want me to be. Go ahead and
[2:53:11] heat up the word.
[2:53:13] Increase the tariffs.
[2:53:16] Increase the tariff.
[2:53:18] Start war with China. Destroy Canada. Do
[2:53:22] this. Do this. It is bringing me closer
[2:53:25] to the third pool. The more you squeeze
[2:53:28] in, the more life become uncomfortable.
[2:53:32] The more I'm expecting the dead pull.
[2:53:39] Let's stand. Let's stand my friend. We
[2:53:41] got a water baptism outside.
[2:53:44] [Applause]
[2:53:47] [Music]
[2:53:51] I'm sorry my friend, I went 19 minutes
[2:53:54] over.
[2:53:57] minus the time you took.
[2:54:02] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Go ponder on
[2:54:06] this. The Lord didn't want me to get
[2:54:08] into uh uh uh Lazarus. We will pick up
[2:54:13] because I thought I get in Lazarus. Then
[2:54:15] next Sunday I will show you. What do you
[2:54:17] do when you waiting? But God knows why
[2:54:20] he was moving. Amen. Amen. Change the
[2:54:24] perspective of your life. Look at your
[2:54:26] life different. Amen.
[2:54:30] There is something bigger. There is a
[2:54:33] bigger picture. There is a panoramic
[2:54:35] view than what you're looking at.
[2:54:37] Hallelujah.
[2:54:39] God want to fulfill more through you.
[2:54:42] Yes sir. Than the single request you're
[2:54:44] looking for. Now you are looking at one
[2:54:47] thing. That's right. But God is looking
[2:54:48] at seven things. God will not sacrifice
[2:54:52] six thing for one. He want to make sure
[2:54:55] whenever it's accomplished what you ask
[2:54:58] plus the other one will be all
[2:55:01] fulfilled. Wait till we get in the life
[2:55:03] of Lazarus and the resurrection and you
[2:55:05] see what was in the resurrection of
[2:55:07] Lazarus. You'll see what the sickness of
[2:55:10] Lazarus, the mystery behind the sickness
[2:55:12] of
[2:55:16] Lazarus because Jesus already knew and
[2:55:19] he purposely left so that the sickness
[2:55:22] can strike.
[2:55:25] How can a creator leave a sickness
[2:55:30] struck when he was supposed to
[2:55:33] protect? No, there is something in that
[2:55:36] sickness. There is something in Lazarus
[2:55:38] that is calling for
[2:55:40] that and out of that God will do
[2:55:45] something for it.
[2:55:50] Do you know that when Sarah was changed,
[2:55:53] God didn't just change her?
[2:55:58] God remove also barness.
[2:56:02] Do you know that Lazarus died sick? Yes.
[2:56:05] Do you think when he resurrected he
[2:56:07] resurrected sick? Because father
[2:56:09] Brandham say resurrected is not
[2:56:11] replacement. It's whatever went there
[2:56:13] came out. Do you think when Lazarus was
[2:56:15] coming up he was coughing?
[2:56:17] So he was not just a resurrection.
[2:56:20] There was a healing that was bundled
[2:56:23] with that resurrection. So Lazarus came
[2:56:26] up better than what than the way he went
[2:56:29] in. Yes. Amen.
[2:56:32] You will come up better than the way
[2:56:34] you're going in. You won't go home
[2:56:36] without being in a glorified state.
[2:56:39] Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching
[2:56:42] you this afternoon. Father, we thank you
[2:56:44] for your grace, for your love, for your
[2:56:47] mercy, and for everything you have been
[2:56:49] doing for us. Father, this is as far as
[2:56:52] you wanted me to go, and I have to obey
[2:56:56] the spirit. But you know what you spoke
[2:56:59] to your children, what you spoke to all
[2:57:01] of us. Things Lord that are bringing a
[2:57:04] panoramic view, a different view than
[2:57:07] what our brain can conceive about your
[2:57:10] purpose in our lives. Lord, that's why
[2:57:13] now those scripture like everything is
[2:57:17] working together for good. We begin to
[2:57:19] understand them more now because we know
[2:57:21] that there is nothing that will come
[2:57:24] that won't be working towards your
[2:57:26] purpose because you orchestrate
[2:57:28] everything to work according to your
[2:57:31] divine purpose. Father, may you touch
[2:57:33] your children. May you help us even in
[2:57:36] the water baptism outside so that Lord
[2:57:38] your child can be sealed in your kingdom
[2:57:41] as he expressed the desire to be Lord
[2:57:44] father baptized. Bless this church.
[2:57:46] Father, protect us. Give us travel mercy
[2:57:49] throughout the week. Lord, Father, we
[2:57:51] commit it all unto thy hand in the name
[2:57:53] of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you,
[2:57:57] church. We love you, brother
[2:58:00] [Applause]
