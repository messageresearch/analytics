[29:52] okay for in them is philip the wrath of
[29:55] god
[29:56] and i saw as he wear a sea of glass
[30:01] mingled with fire
[30:03] and them that had gotten the victory
[30:05] over the
[30:06] beast and over his
[30:10] and over his
[30:12] and over the number of his name
[30:15] stand on the sea of glass having the
[30:17] harps of god
[30:19] and seeing the song of moses
[30:22] the servant of god
[30:24] and the song of the lamb
[30:26] saying great and marvelous are thou
[30:28] words
[30:30] lord god almighty so they understand
[30:33] that the lamb is lord god almighty
[30:36] so they have a
[30:37] understanding of a deity now
[30:40] just and true or that way is that king
[30:42] of the same
[30:43] so this is the two things that draw me
[30:46] to a different direction
[30:48] so keep that in mind revelation 12 13 14
[30:52] if we get chance so lord's willing we
[30:54] have to touch on that one before we go
[30:56] to the lake of fire amen
[30:58] so just bear with me i follow the gps
[31:02] amen
[31:02] i can give you what you want but it
[31:04] won't be under the gps i want to stay
[31:07] under the supernatural gps and make sure
[31:11] i'm following because he knows exactly
[31:14] and i have never seen him missed
[31:17] every time he comes you hear somebody
[31:18] saying that was what i was praying for
[31:20] that was what was going on that was
[31:23] telling me it is not me it is the gps
[31:25] amen
[31:27] so keep speaking the right thing
[31:29] keep speaking it loud keep repeating it
[31:33] if you don't have faith yet
[31:35] if you already have faith so continue
[31:37] moving to the right direction amen
[31:40] saying the right thing will pull god
[31:42] down
[31:43] amen
[31:44] abraham believed god he believed number
[31:47] two then he start confessing calling the
[31:50] things that doesn't exist as they do
[31:53] exist
[31:54] then he start praising god for those
[31:56] things that he have not even received
[31:58] yet and then he get into the action and
[32:01] moving on those are the
[32:04] the steps of abraham now you know your
[32:06] step if you need something you know
[32:09] where to get it just get a man
[32:11] bottom sometimes say like a mental
[32:14] attitude
[32:16] you frame your own picture
[32:20] you know that right you know the story
[32:22] about the three boys that were watching
[32:23] uh
[32:24] [Music]
[32:25] a boat
[32:27] you know that story
[32:29] you don't know
[32:31] you don't know
[32:34] how many knows this place
[32:36] okay
[32:38] okay if you don't know let me just tell
[32:40] you
[32:41] there were three boys in their bedroom
[32:43] they had a picture
[32:45] of a boat selling peacefully
[32:48] and every time they woke up they look at
[32:49] the picture they go to sleep they look
[32:51] at the picture they wake up they all
[32:52] came to a picture they go to sleep they
[32:53] look at the picture and after a while
[32:55] there were like four boys if i'm not
[32:57] mistaken all of them went to the navy
[33:00] and they wondered they say what was
[33:01] going on and they found out it was a
[33:03] picture there
[33:04] how can a picture put a profession in
[33:06] somebody's heart
[33:10] a picture
[33:12] moved from the wall
[33:13] got into the heart and when he got into
[33:16] the heart he even gave those boys the
[33:18] endurance and the
[33:20] uh
[33:22] perseverance to go all the way to the
[33:24] navy and read it
[33:26] because their
[33:29] eye was
[33:31] looking in other words the picture was
[33:34] speaking
[33:35] you remember we said a picture worth ten
[33:37] thousand well
[33:38] so when they were looking at the picture
[33:40] he was talking about navy navy navy navy
[33:43] navy navy until the inward man
[33:47] called it like okay it's navy
[33:50] he got them when he got the navy on the
[33:53] heart
[33:54] he flipped the boys and everything the
[33:56] boys are seeing is just navy
[33:58] navy and navy and all of them fulfill
[34:01] exactly that
[34:02] if an image can do that what can do this
[34:05] thing
[34:08] you see
[34:09] amen so when you look at the image
[34:12] that's why paul said it's going to be
[34:14] you'll be transformed into the
[34:18] how you are looking at them
[34:22] you see

[38:53] we won't prolong the time i know it's
[38:55] wednesday let's turn to um
[38:58] galatians 5.
[39:01] and
[39:03] what you have to say amen
[39:06] and where's read verse six galatians
[39:09] five and six he says for in jesus christ
[39:12] neither
[39:13] avail anything nor uncircumcision but
[39:16] the faith which worketh by love you may
[39:19] be seated
[39:20] here you know i tell you i didn't know
[39:23] about the grace of god which way we were
[39:25] going but uh
[39:26] you know been hearing so much about
[39:28] faith
[39:29] and the lord's been unfolding in the
[39:31] word is that right
[39:32] i'm telling you we should be claiming
[39:34] every promise that's all is that right
[39:37] every promise that that's ours in this
[39:39] hour here now you know he told us it was
[39:42] faith is that right abraham started he
[39:44] said the faith of abraham and then he
[39:47] come and told us it had to be a
[39:48] confession is that right and then after
[39:50] you have told us to be a confession then
[39:53] he said but it had to be a work is that
[39:55] right you see my you know my faith by my
[39:58] works and my works demonstrates my faith
[40:00] is that right so we're in here now we're
[40:03] going to leave here those that come and
[40:05] hear trouble you will leave him
[40:06] victorious tonight is that right because
[40:09] we come the holy ghost is positive is
[40:12] that right when the holy ghost coming in
[40:14] positive we claiming everything that
[40:16] belongs to us in this hour here now now
[40:19] we're going to look into the scripture
[40:21] and we're going to show you it this
[40:23] faith that's in this hour that we're
[40:25] talking about now is controlled by the
[40:29] love of god is that right the agape love
[40:32] not the affiliated love it's a faith
[40:35] that's working by love so i heard the
[40:38] holy ghost say one time that redemption
[40:40] has to come in what for is that right so
[40:43] we come around and then now we're
[40:45] talking about this faith that's working
[40:47] by love we want you to look at this and
[40:50] we're going to take our time and just
[40:52] pray with us by the grace of god the
[40:54] devil fought me all last night and all
[40:57] the days but i'll tell you but we are
[40:59] overcomers is that right
[41:01] greater is he that is in me than he that
[41:04] is in the world so we're coming this
[41:06] hour here now we got to understand what
[41:09] god has called us to
[41:11] now i want you to read
[41:13] something here from our prophet
[41:15] and i want you to know in this hour here
[41:17] i see i got the inspiration from the
[41:20] message desperation
[41:23] that's where i got the inspiration from
[41:25] you know it's it's sad to say
[41:27] but most people don't move until they're
[41:29] desperate
[41:31] until they got pressure on them until
[41:33] you have to come in here you know when
[41:35] god likes a humble soul though but
[41:38] that's what most people have to trouble
[41:40] but god showed us suddenly what that you
[41:42] don't have to get weary because you're
[41:44] going through troubles is that right but
[41:47] it's perfecting you it's moving you
[41:49] closer to what the lord has called us to
[41:51] do
[41:52] so we want you to look at his hair
[41:54] by the grace of god
[41:57] and god help me
[42:02] and this is the faith that's worketh by
[42:05] love
[42:07] and
[42:08] love when we know when you're desperate
[42:11] you know it's pain you're extremely pain
[42:14] suffering you're really really desperate
[42:17] to get what you need
[42:19] but what struck me in this message that
[42:21] the prophet of god was working with
[42:23] but he was joe showing us but how this
[42:26] faith is working in this hour here now
[42:29] he had just got finished preaching the
[42:31] token and when he preached that token he
[42:34] came and he was talking about how great
[42:36] that it was a message that god had given
[42:39] him and we know that token is the
[42:41] baptism of the holy ghost is that right
[42:44] we know most of them even in jacob in
[42:46] his time when he swindled esau out of
[42:49] the birthright is that right he thought
[42:51] he was all right at that time but he
[42:54] didn't realize it just began is that
[42:56] right we have to realize now once you
[42:59] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:01] now your battle just begins is that
[43:04] right
[43:04] but you have to understand greater is he
[43:07] that is in thee than he that is in the
[43:09] world we're going to show you that
[43:11] you've got to in this hour here now we
[43:14] have to come but you have to come humbly
[43:18] you got to come to god humbly saints and
[43:21] when you come to him humbly you're going
[43:23] to see by the scriptures what you can
[43:25] receive in this hour here now right
[43:28] so it's too many coming to the
[43:30] confession with dry life confessions
[43:33] that's not going to get it with god is
[43:35] that right you're going to see some of
[43:37] your brothers and your sisters that
[43:39] you're going to see on the other side
[43:41] how they really really suffered and
[43:43] prevailed is that right how they cried
[43:46] out to god because they needed something
[43:48] from god
[43:50] they needed a promise to be
[43:52] revealed to them is that right but look
[43:55] at all that we have you can't get it
[43:57] even in abel's time in abel's time we
[44:00] got to understand you can only get it by
[44:03] what revelation is that right both of
[44:06] them came you got these religious demons
[44:08] that's running around here now because
[44:11] we were bringing you into this hour here
[44:13] now what the lord is bringing his elect
[44:16] into and we're going to show you god
[44:18] chose you you had nowhere you couldn't
[44:21] get out of it god chose you that god
[44:25] chose you to perform a work on here so
[44:28] you have to understand you think that
[44:30] the pastor's love that that wordy some
[44:33] things he's been too hard with or
[44:35] something he's a he shouldn't bring it a
[44:37] certain way the holy ghost be picking up
[44:40] some of your thoughts you gotta get out
[44:42] of your flesh is that right he told you
[44:45] that satan can operate through the flesh
[44:47] by faith and he said you can operate
[44:50] through the spirit through the heart and
[44:52] thy faith is that right so now what we
[44:54] have to understand and it's out here now
[44:57] god is bringing and moving you and
[44:59] getting you ready for that rapture is
[45:01] that right because it's going to be a
[45:04] rapture and i'm going in the rapture
[45:07] we're always looking for the coming of
[45:09] the lord so we should be the happiest
[45:11] people in the world is that right
[45:14] that's why if you go in there one day
[45:16] i'ma show you why they say restore the
[45:18] joy what by salvation why should he have
[45:21] to restore the joy of my salvation some
[45:24] of y'all can keep singing it all you
[45:25] want to i'm going to keep preaching it
[45:27] too because i got scripture to show you
[45:30] what you need to keep your mind on and
[45:32] then he won't have to restore the joy of
[45:34] your salvation
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:40] so you keep doing it because you think
[45:42] the word is false i'll get in trouble i
[45:44] got to be held accountable for what i
[45:46] preach
[45:48] is that right the way he's coming he's
[45:50] moving he's driving his demon forces
[45:53] like the holy spirit said through the
[45:54] pastor he's changing your way of
[45:56] thinking
[45:58] so does a man think of in his heart so
[46:01] is he malachi 4 came to turn the hearts
[46:05] of the children to who the fathers is
[46:07] that right hallelujah
[46:13] look what he said
[46:14] desperation
[46:16] faith that's working by love in this
[46:18] hour here now you know what
[46:20] we want to see perfect love how about
[46:22] perfect love came into the temple and
[46:24] turned them tables over huh
[46:30] thank you jesus how about when he came
[46:32] down in there and they tried to come
[46:34] into the house of the lord is that right
[46:37] no it isn't you've been hiding behind
[46:39] religion too long is that right now god
[46:42] says everything that's hidden he's going
[46:45] to uncover it see so you got to realize
[46:48] every i only die every key going to be
[46:50] crossed he's unfolding all the promises
[46:54] of god in his hour here now when he did
[46:57] what
[46:59] property god said when he called the
[47:01] devil she said what it was a pastor is
[47:03] that right he said when he told him to
[47:05] go get the coin out of their mouth that
[47:07] was the trustee is that right when it
[47:10] came turning over the tables he said
[47:12] that was the anointing of a deacon watch
[47:14] out now you don't want that anointing to
[47:16] get on the beacon sometimes

[48:02] was about to die
[48:03] with cancer
[48:05] he knows that god
[48:07] could heal her
[48:09] and if god could heal his wife
[48:11] god can heal the boy and it throws it
[48:13] into the state of what desperation
[48:16] you must come and when you're desperate
[48:19] then god is going to listen to you

[50:50] then that's different you say to you but
[50:52] it takes desperation to do it
[50:57] look what he said he said i believe
[51:00] this is brother brandon
[51:02] he said i believe
[51:05] the reason
[51:06] we don't have desperation it's because
[51:08] it's a lack of love
[51:17] that's strong ain't it
[51:20] let's see what else he said
[51:22] see the word can't offend the word
[51:24] huh
[51:25] the word can offend the word because we
[51:28] know it's only making us better
[51:30] he said now look
[51:32] he says the lack of love god the love of
[51:35] god
[51:37] i think that the love of god calls his
[51:39] desperation
[51:40] [Music]
[51:41] he said if god is in you the token
[51:44] inside of you and you see the conditions
[51:46] of the times and the people willing in
[51:48] sin in the way that they are it'll throw
[51:51] you into a desperation let's look at
[51:54] ezekiel 9 let's go to ezekiel 9.
[51:58] amen hallelujah
[52:06] lord
[52:06] have your way
[52:10] ezekiel time four and seven
[52:14] ezekiel nine
[52:16] let's look at verse 4 he says and the
[52:18] lord said unto him go
[52:21] go through the midst of the city
[52:23] through the midst of jerusalem and set a
[52:25] mark upon the foreheads of the men that
[52:27] sigh and that cry for all the
[52:29] abominations that are done in the midst
[52:31] thereof
[52:33] he says unto the others he said in in in
[52:35] my hearing go ye after him he says
[52:39] through the city and smite let not your
[52:42] eyes spare neither have ye pity see
[52:45] we're talking about we're wrestling not
[52:47] against flesh and blood
[52:49] but against principalities and powers
[52:51] and wickedness and rulers in high places
[52:54] we got 200 million demon forces out
[52:57] there
[52:58] and those demon forces if you're
[53:00] ignorant to them if you're just trying
[53:02] to walk by the letter you can forget it
[53:04] you won't defeat satan in his trickery
[53:07] because he told us to put on the whole
[53:09] armor of god so that you may be able to
[53:11] withstand against the wiles and the
[53:13] trickery of the devil is that right so
[53:16] we have to understand in this hour here
[53:18] now that god is preparing getting his
[53:20] bride by what opening his word is that
[53:23] right with understanding see when he
[53:26] start opening the word with
[53:27] understanding this is your glory the end
[53:31] your and and your word is part of your
[53:33] inheritance that's being opened up to
[53:36] you
[53:37] now we're saying that brother steve i
[53:39] tell you i won't mess with it but i'll
[53:40] tell you i was tempted to go in there
[53:42] and look at some of them clouds but i
[53:44] ain't gonna forerun the pastor and i'll
[53:46] tell you when they got around in there
[53:48] you start running clouds through there
[53:50] is that right when you start running
[53:52] clouds through that i didn't see the one
[53:54] in in um psalms 133 oh how sweet and
[53:57] beautiful that it is to brothers to
[53:59] dwell together in unity is that it come
[54:01] down in there you could just see that
[54:03] cloud you could see christ you could see
[54:05] that hoffman head you could see that
[54:07] anointing you could see the revelation
[54:09] of anointing i mean you can see the
[54:10] revelation of um of unity or mainly
[54:14] among the brethren and that's why we
[54:16] come and we we say we pray for one
[54:19] another we hold one another up in prayer
[54:21] when god bring them to our heart in in
[54:24] prayer we're family saints
[54:26] let me keep going i don't want to get to
[54:28] get behind because i got my timer up
[54:30] here
[54:30] he said now look
[54:33] hallelujah he said in verse 7 it says
[54:36] and he bought me no verse seven
[54:40] he says and he said unto them defile the
[54:42] house and fill the courts with the slain
[54:45] go ye forth and they went forth and slew
[54:48] in the city what we're working now we're
[54:50] talking about in this hour out here now
[54:53] you and i now we got our brothers we got
[54:56] our sisters bound up with these demon
[54:58] forces out here in that world they're
[55:00] struggling but we're going to show you a
[55:02] faith that's working by love if you guys
[55:04] bear witness he already showed us you
[55:07] got to have the faith of abraham and
[55:09] then you confess your thoughts one to
[55:11] another is that right and after you
[55:13] confess to
[55:14] confess your faults one to another i'm
[55:16] gonna show you what the prophet of god
[55:18] said here
[55:19] he says now
[55:21] the word plainly states
[55:23] if you want to put this down
[55:26] galatians 5 and 6 faith
[55:28] worketh by love
[55:31] he says faith worketh love
[55:35] and the only way that you can have faith
[55:38] is to have love first
[55:43] beginning to see how simple it is
[55:46] god hidden in simplicity and revealed
[55:49] the same way
[55:52] he said now he said because after all
[55:55] faith is love's incentive
[56:00] let it sink in
[56:03] that thing is simple but it's powerful
[56:07] he said he said that's in sinner i'ma
[56:10] hit some of y'all now what is your
[56:12] incentive i'ma stop the impulse
[56:15] what is your incentive
[56:17] is your incentive are you more excited
[56:19] when it's time to go to work
[56:22] are you a more regather your incentive
[56:24] motive is there when it's time for you
[56:26] to what eat
[56:28] see if you're incented but it's time for
[56:30] you to be entertained what is your
[56:33] incentive your spirit see that's what
[56:36] drives you control your nature is that
[56:38] right
[56:40] they have to you have to realize what is
[56:42] that incentive that's driving you
[56:45] instead of having a desire to read your
[56:48] bible having a desire to pray having a
[56:51] desire to pick up the cod book
[56:56] he's not just telling your pastor just
[56:58] not telling you these things just to
[56:59] tell you he's sharing these things with
[57:01] you because down the road what did he
[57:03] say up on that board
[57:05] on sunday he said it's a pressure that's
[57:07] going to come
[57:08] and when that pressure come you'll be
[57:10] ready you see
[57:12] you're going to be ready for it we're
[57:14] not backing up off of no devil we taking
[57:16] everyone and we're not losing a hoof is
[57:19] that right
[57:20] so your incentive should be with the
[57:22] gift that god put inside of you what did
[57:25] god put inside of you whatever you do
[57:28] without looking for a reward if it just
[57:31] comes to you naturally go pray that's
[57:34] what god put in you to do you just it
[57:37] just comes naturally the holy spirit
[57:39] told us suddenly more i don't know why
[57:41] i'm going this way but i'm going the
[57:43] holy spirit just told us this sunday
[57:45] morning he said because that desire
[57:47] that's in your heart is that right
[57:50] with that desire to live in his heart
[57:51] you can't get rid of it you didn't put
[57:54] it there is that right that's what the
[57:56] lord told us so now you have to realize
[57:59] daddy
[58:00] mama
[58:02] sister brother
[58:04] when you recognize someone that loves
[58:06] you is struggling in that area somewhere
[58:09] somebody's seen that behavior you
[58:11] understand what i'm saying somewhere
[58:14] someone's seen that behavior in that
[58:16] life so now you got to pray
[58:19] against that thing you pray until god
[58:22] come and reveal him to you he's going to
[58:24] what deliver you from that he's still
[58:27] with me
[58:30] i think brother branham preached the
[58:32] message before he left the scene first
[58:34] faithful works worked for works faith
[58:36] work you know i'm talking about that
[58:38] message that he preached
[58:40] the word thank you brother
[58:42] works is faith expressed if he's that in
[58:44] 65
[58:46] right around
[58:47] let me keep going because i don't want
[58:49] to rush past this
[58:51] see there's no way you can have this
[58:52] kind of love without the baptism of the
[58:54] holy ghost
[58:56] there's no way you can't even love your
[58:58] life that's a high calling when he said
[59:01] love your wife as christ loved the
[59:03] church how are you going to love your
[59:05] wife that christ loved the church if you
[59:07] don't have the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:09] in your life that's why when it came he
[59:12] preached that token it was heavy on his
[59:14] heart because he's seen now in his hour
[59:16] here now you wouldn't be falling apart
[59:19] he said that's what happened to him when
[59:21] jacob jacob thought he was all right is
[59:24] that right but it just began the fight
[59:26] just began
[59:28] and then he got to begin he knew that he
[59:30] knew in this hour here now i mean in his
[59:32] time esau was going to come and get him
[59:35] is that right well it's the same thing
[59:37] with us in our time you've been
[59:39] justified justified what does justified
[59:42] mean to a denominational person someone
[59:45] looking in and they can say oh yeah a
[59:46] visitor looking in they can say oh yeah
[59:49] justification justification yeah we got
[59:51] that no no no no our revelation of
[59:53] justification you never did it is that
[59:56] right you never did it what can wash
[59:59] away my sins nothing but the blood of
[1:00:01] jesus so now you've been sanctified
[1:00:04] filled with the holy ghost is that right
[1:00:06] we know now once you've got the holy
[1:00:09] ghost now when the battle begins for you
[1:00:12] is that right so you must receive ye the
[1:00:14] holy ghost and now once you have it it
[1:00:17] will demonstrate what your life your
[1:00:20] life will change you'll know them by
[1:00:22] their what fruits is that right
[1:00:25] of faith
[1:00:26] that's working by love
[1:00:30] let it sink in
[1:00:33] self-examining time
[1:00:38] some of you're ripping and running and
[1:00:40] you in
[1:00:41] and some of them out there people all
[1:00:43] confused you know what you need to do
[1:00:45] and then shooting then they want to
[1:00:46] throw darts they want to throw darts
[1:00:48] this way i love you brother
[1:00:52] i appreciate you
[1:00:54] brother jesus said pray for your enemy
[1:00:59] love your enemies pray for those that
[1:01:01] despitefully use you do good to those
[1:01:03] that do evil to you
[1:01:05] you guard that anointing you make your
[1:01:07] love circle just bigger is that right
[1:01:09] you make it bigger because we're going
[1:01:11] somewhere we're going places is that
[1:01:14] right god is unfolding the word because
[1:01:16] you're hungry for the word that's in the
[1:01:19] scriptures now we're talking about faith
[1:01:21] now we understand what that faith of
[1:01:23] abraham is that right now we come about
[1:01:26] what confession is that right we got to
[1:01:28] confess those things next and then and
[1:01:30] now and so what it's a work that
[1:01:32] demonstrates your faith and the work
[1:01:34] that he's calling for us is the love of
[1:01:38] god
[1:01:43] it comes through humility
[1:01:45] you see it comes through humility
[1:01:48] reverence
[1:01:49] especially preachers too
[1:01:51] he told him when isaiah was in the
[1:01:53] message influence he said he had the six
[1:01:55] wings remember
[1:01:57] he said he had to have the two to put on
[1:01:59] on
[1:02:01] on his eyes
[1:02:02] okay
[1:02:03] reverence he has two two uh for his feet
[1:02:08] humility reverence
[1:02:10] and the other two he had to do with put
[1:02:11] him in what service is that right
[1:02:14] so even you got to be put in you have to
[1:02:16] have those designs you got to have those
[1:02:19] characteristics before you start talking
[1:02:22] about doing the work of the lord
[1:02:25] people who are are examining your life
[1:02:29] let me keep going help me lord
[1:02:31] he said now look he says after all faith
[1:02:34] is love and sinners
[1:02:37] it says incentive that's exactly what
[1:02:39] faith is
[1:02:41] it's an incentive to love
[1:02:45] he says now you if you don't have love
[1:02:47] you can't have faith
[1:02:51] he says so now you
[1:02:53] say what let's turn over to uh first
[1:02:55] corinthians
[1:02:57] 13.
[1:03:03] hallelujah
[1:03:04] faith
[1:03:05] that worketh by love
[1:03:09] i read i read over that for years
[1:03:12] god anoints things when he wants to
[1:03:14] anoint
[1:03:15] when god's ready to bring something it's
[1:03:16] his time they want the spoken word
[1:03:19] someone cried about spoken word spoken
[1:03:21] word yeah we got a spoken word wait on
[1:03:23] the holy ghost you can't speak the word
[1:03:25] on your own
[1:03:26] huh you got to wait on the holy ghost
[1:03:28] jesus said i do nothing unless the
[1:03:29] father tell me is that right he said i'm
[1:03:31] about my father's business he went over
[1:03:33] to martha
[1:03:35] and and joseph was asking come running
[1:03:37] where you been where you been he said
[1:03:39] i've been about my father's business is
[1:03:41] that right they're looking for him at
[1:03:43] the passover and then he would they
[1:03:46] probably wouldn't have to pass over
[1:03:47] traditionally jesus jesus was about his
[1:03:49] father's business is that right we're
[1:03:51] talking about the scriptures in there
[1:03:53] hallelujah
[1:03:55] faith
[1:03:56] that workers by love look at first
[1:03:58] corinthians 13.
[1:04:02] he says though i speak with tongues of
[1:04:04] men and of angel it had not charity i
[1:04:07] become as what sounding brass or a
[1:04:10] tinkling symbol
[1:04:12] he says and though i have the gift of
[1:04:14] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[1:04:15] and all knowledge and though i have all
[1:04:18] faith so that i can remove mountains and
[1:04:21] i have not what charity i'm what
[1:04:24] now you see where brother brandon was
[1:04:26] getting this from
[1:04:30] he said now he's and i look and and
[1:04:32] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:04:36] poor and though i give my my body to be
[1:04:38] burned and have not charity it profit me
[1:04:41] nothing
[1:04:42] charity suffers long
[1:04:45] you see and it's kind
[1:04:48] see in charity if not
[1:04:52] i get around there all that worry all
[1:04:54] that work that's coming around there now
[1:04:56] in me
[1:04:57] brother my prayers is with you and
[1:04:59] buying every demon for us when i pray
[1:05:01] that come against you
[1:05:04] no man can't unfold those things
[1:05:09] it has to be christ
[1:05:11] back on the scene again
[1:05:13] unfolding his word
[1:05:16] let me keep going he said look
[1:05:18] envy not
[1:05:20] charity born if not itself
[1:05:22] not puffed up
[1:05:24] do if not behave itself unseemly seek is
[1:05:27] not her own it says it's not easy
[1:05:29] provoked think it's no evil
[1:05:32] you get around that you do some
[1:05:34] parenting you know the hardest thing for
[1:05:36] us was raising our children was to make
[1:05:37] a judgment decision
[1:05:39] we know what was right we knew what was
[1:05:41] wrong
[1:05:42] but sometimes you had to go to him and
[1:05:43] say well you know son daddy didn't make
[1:05:45] the best judgment decision on that
[1:05:48] you know forgive me
[1:05:51] and you're back in the middle road with
[1:05:52] your children because they already love
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:55] they just want you to tell them the
[1:05:56] truth
[1:06:00] hallelujah help me lord he says rejoice
[1:06:03] not in iniquity but rejoice in what the
[1:06:06] truth
[1:06:07] bear for all things believing for all
[1:06:09] things hope all things and do it for all
[1:06:11] things charity what
[1:06:13] never faileth
[1:06:15] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:06:17] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:06:20] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:06:22] it shall vanish he says for we know in
[1:06:25] part and we prophesize in part he said
[1:06:28] but when that which is what
[1:06:32] i think they desire to say
[1:06:34] that which is perfect has come then that
[1:06:37] which is in part shall be what done away
[1:06:40] see that's why god had to send malachite
[1:06:43] for luke 17 30 revelations 10
[1:06:46] revelations 19 he had to come wide to
[1:06:49] tie in all the loose sins and unfold
[1:06:51] those mysteries to us it was the son of
[1:06:53] man getting it from the son of man is
[1:06:55] that right the son of man come down and
[1:06:58] was bringing it down to him is that
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:01] huh he came in when he broke those seals
[1:07:04] and he came and he came with those ages
[1:07:06] ain't no seal as you hear the pastor
[1:07:08] saying it's a new book
[1:07:10] you see because those things that was
[1:07:12] hidden in there now he's making it known
[1:07:15] to us through his precious bride
[1:07:17] let me keep going he said look
[1:07:20] let me go back to this here faith
[1:07:22] worketh by love
[1:07:24] he said now you if you don't have love
[1:07:27] you can't have faith see how can you
[1:07:29] have faith in your wife if you don't
[1:07:31] love her
[1:07:33] he said that's that's in philly he said
[1:07:35] now how about the agape to god how can
[1:07:38] it be if you don't love if you don't
[1:07:41] love god he said now look help me lord
[1:07:44] he says don't
[1:07:46] he says don't do that
[1:07:49] she'll never know it
[1:07:51] that's the way if you if you do love her
[1:07:54] you express it
[1:07:57] tell your wife you love her
[1:08:00] tell her how pretty she is
[1:08:02] tell her how you appreciate her
[1:08:04] oh honey rest your legs
[1:08:07] you know you you you you share those
[1:08:09] things don't let the fire die out it
[1:08:12] gets sweeter and sweeter the same as you
[1:08:14] walk with christ
[1:08:15] as he continued to unfold himself you
[1:08:18] get humble and humbler and humbler is
[1:08:20] that right
[1:08:21] look what he says
[1:08:23] he said that's the way
[1:08:24] we do to god
[1:08:27] he said when we love him we tell him
[1:08:29] about it
[1:08:31] we sat down and we adore him and worship
[1:08:33] him and see love drives us to that
[1:08:37] he says now
[1:08:39] you know he says now now you look here
[1:08:42] he says and that's the same thing that
[1:08:44] it is
[1:08:45] we must love
[1:08:47] we must have love before we can have
[1:08:49] faith
[1:08:50] we have genuine love what does it do it
[1:08:54] pushes faith it pushes our faith
[1:08:58] out into the battle front of god
[1:09:07] he said in the battlefront of god
[1:09:09] genuine godly faith love for god and for
[1:09:14] his word and for his people will push
[1:09:17] faith out
[1:09:18] there what about david
[1:09:21] in first samuel 17.
[1:09:23] when david was in there
[1:09:25] and his daddy told golden to check on
[1:09:27] his brothers when he was out there
[1:09:29] and look at david and david was then i'm
[1:09:32] paraphrasing it you can go to first
[1:09:33] samuel 17 and look at it i got too many
[1:09:36] scriptures to determine but david knew
[1:09:40] down inside he had the love for israel
[1:09:42] and god's people and his for and his
[1:09:44] brethren
[1:09:46] and so david what did he do david ran
[1:09:48] towards the battle after he heard
[1:09:50] goliath boasting his words is that right
[1:09:53] if the words it was enchanted the words
[1:09:56] that we're battling that's why the lord
[1:09:57] been telling us about the mouth
[1:09:59] the tongue
[1:10:01] you got to have faith you speak those
[1:10:03] things by faith and you expect it to
[1:10:05] come and pass building up your most holy
[1:10:07] faith doing what praying in the holy
[1:10:10] ghost
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] i don't know why he's going this way but
[1:10:14] i'm just following him
[1:10:16] he says you look
[1:10:18] he said so
[1:10:19] god loves
[1:10:21] his word is people and love
[1:10:24] just takes hold of faith
[1:10:28] it say come on let's go
[1:10:31] we got the victory
[1:10:33] god said so
[1:10:35] see
[1:10:36] but when you're desperate
[1:10:39] when you when when you become desperate
[1:10:42] and just bear with me i want you to see
[1:10:44] some of these scriptures how they
[1:10:45] operated when they got desperate
[1:10:49] it's too many of us letting our children
[1:10:51] struggle with certain things you mean if
[1:10:54] your child is struggling with something
[1:10:56] you can't stand in the gap you got the
[1:10:58] love that's your child and god has given
[1:11:01] you the authority what you buying on
[1:11:03] earth shall be buying in heaven what you
[1:11:05] loose on earth they'll be loose in
[1:11:07] heaven
[1:11:10] what is your incentive
[1:11:12] what is your motive
[1:11:17] he said now look he said look what john
[1:11:20] said john 14 he said jesus said if a man
[1:11:23] loves me he'll keep my what my words now
[1:11:26] you can keep his words without
[1:11:28] without you can't keep his word without
[1:11:30] having faith in what he said
[1:11:33] so you see if he loves god then he keeps
[1:11:36] god's word
[1:11:38] he said if he said i am the lord that
[1:11:41] heal of thee he believes that love makes
[1:11:44] him what believe it he said because love
[1:11:47] dominates all
[1:11:48] see he says thou he says thou
[1:11:51] i speak you call the pastor and you
[1:11:53] can't get him
[1:11:56] what's his voicemail say
[1:11:59] about love
[1:12:02] he knows that he knows the scriptures he
[1:12:04] knows why you think he put it on his
[1:12:06] phone just to be putting it there no
[1:12:08] he's dropping the seed on you
[1:12:14] the demon the devil can't even get
[1:12:15] through that
[1:12:17] he says now god then he keeps god's word
[1:12:21] if he said i am the lord that heal of
[1:12:24] thee
[1:12:26] he believes that
[1:12:29] i'm the lord thy god
[1:12:31] that healeth all thy diseases
[1:12:34] does thou believe it
[1:12:36] now what love pushes us out there right
[1:12:39] because god so loved the world he gave
[1:12:42] his only begotten son
[1:12:44] so now all you're doing is claiming it
[1:12:47] you're professing these things what god
[1:12:50] said any illness any diseases when i
[1:12:52] first started i feel great up here now
[1:12:55] some of you heard my voice when i first
[1:12:57] started the devil fought me all last
[1:12:59] night he fought my body he me
[1:13:02] cold he's trying to sing cold out on my
[1:13:05] body but i'm compressing lord thy god
[1:13:08] you're the you're jehovah raphae you're
[1:13:11] the lord thy god the hill of all night
[1:13:14] diseases lord i stand on your word
[1:13:18] because you said you love me you said we
[1:13:21] are overcomers you put the love that
[1:13:23] pushes the faith that's all out there
[1:13:29] you think i wasn't gonna be tested i had
[1:13:30] to be tested too what i'm preaching
[1:13:33] he came right at me
[1:13:35] he don't care
[1:13:36] he don't care done about it you ain't
[1:13:38] getting no sleep you ain't gonna sleep
[1:13:40] you gotta preach well i'm gonna mess
[1:13:42] with you as much as i can
[1:13:44] huh but what greater is he that is in me
[1:13:46] than he that is in the world is that
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:50] when the enemy come in like a flood he
[1:13:52] will lift up the mighty standard against
[1:13:54] it
[1:13:57] hallelujah
[1:14:01] he said look what he says
[1:14:03] he says
[1:14:05] the lord that heal is deep
[1:14:07] he believes that see
[1:14:09] love makes him believe it
[1:14:14] let's sink in
[1:14:16] because now that's what the holy spirit
[1:14:19] is working
[1:14:20] he's working on that heart
[1:14:22] so if a man think of in his heart the
[1:14:24] holy spirit come around in there
[1:14:26] what about that shooter what about that
[1:14:28] shulamite man holy spirit told us about
[1:14:31] what he started down here at this level
[1:14:33] down here at the cardinal mind of faith
[1:14:36] he said then it moved up to another
[1:14:37] level of faith spiritual he said then it
[1:14:40] moves up to a vision is that right he
[1:14:42] said paul testified i no longer he said
[1:14:45] i pray that you come into knowledge in
[1:14:48] the wisdom of the lord jesus christ he
[1:14:51] moved up to another level you know what

[1:15:04] desperation when that sister raised her
[1:15:07] baby according to the will of the lord
[1:15:10] she raised that baby and she got there
[1:15:13] and he had a social disease and that
[1:15:16] social disease that he had she knew
[1:15:18] wasn't that she had right

[1:15:23] desperate now but it was love that drove
[1:15:26] her it was love that drove her it was
[1:15:29] love that drove her her side that's my
[1:15:32] child uh i raised him to according to

[1:24:28] jesus is in control
[1:24:32] i'm boasting in jesus you should have
[1:24:35] seen them fall away from me all i've
[1:24:38] seen was demon forces saying this man is
[1:24:40] crazy
[1:24:42] you see because when someone is sitting
[1:24:45] up some of you nurses sister fanny and
[1:24:48] some of y'all know that someone is
[1:24:50] sitting up after a thyroid storm in
[1:24:54] three days and ready to eat something
[1:24:56] glory be to god
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:01] don't tell me about my resurrected god

[1:25:10] tell your children loose hold on little
[1:25:13] bride your love is what's driving you
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:22] look what he said
[1:25:24] he says we know it's true he says god
[1:25:26] will meet a desperate soul
[1:25:28] he says now we all know that but it
[1:25:31] usually takes something to drive us into
[1:25:34] that
[1:25:34] to despair desperation it takes
[1:25:36] something to do it he says we find out
[1:25:39] in james 5 15 he says the fervent prayer
[1:25:42] of a righteous man does what a veil is
[1:25:45] much when the righteous said good man it
[1:25:48] gets travailing you see
[1:25:51] he says but when a soul
[1:25:54] gets
[1:25:55] travailing
[1:25:56] you see remember hannah they thought
[1:25:59] hannah was drunk didn't she but hannah
[1:26:02] you look at these you look at each one
[1:26:04] of these ones we're going to look at
[1:26:05] some scriptures we're running good but i
[1:26:08] want you to see but they was not in
[1:26:11] desperation for themselves
[1:26:18] it was not for themselves because i'ma
[1:26:20] read to you at the end we know who we
[1:26:22] are we know where we come from we know
[1:26:25] where we're going is that right so we
[1:26:27] could tell them about the goodness of
[1:26:29] the lord jesus christ is that right
[1:26:31] someone is out there troubling his many
[1:26:33] souls out there we shining and crying
[1:26:36] for the condition of the land saints

[1:35:43] yourself
[1:35:44] you look you'll see it's always for
[1:35:46] someone else
[1:35:50] then the prophet of god say that we what
[1:35:53] he said we know he said we don't live
[1:35:55] for ourselves we sin here to live for

[1:36:37] talking about she wanted to know what
[1:36:40] was going on and he wanted to know also
[1:36:43] because neither one of them knew at the
[1:36:45] time is that right god don't always show
[1:36:47] his servants everything
[1:36:49] he said then she said that i desire of
[1:36:52] my lord did i not say
[1:36:54] do not deceive me now what's she doing
[1:36:57] huh

[1:37:16] that she can get him to go back to god
[1:37:19] and raise that child back up again
[1:37:26] that's what she says
[1:37:28] he said i i told you don't deceive me i
[1:37:30] didn't want that child
[1:37:32] he said then he said to get his eye
[1:37:34] going up thy lawrence take my staff and
[1:37:36] thy hand and go thy way i'ma jump down
[1:37:39] to 30 and the mother of the child said

[1:37:44] will not do what leave thee and he arose
[1:37:47] and followed her see we're not going

[1:40:28] we're talking about a faith that's
[1:40:31] working by love
[1:40:33] but it comes by
[1:40:35] reverence and humility
[1:40:38] he said them he says and when jesus was
[1:40:40] passed over again by the ship and to the
[1:40:42] other side and he was not

[1:40:48] the rulers of the synagogue jurors by

[1:40:55] reverence
[1:40:57] how do we come into the house of the
[1:40:59] lord
[1:41:00] what's your cause for coming here
[1:41:03] are you coming expecting something from
[1:41:05] the lord
[1:41:06] or you're coming just to be coming
[1:41:09] there is a need when i come to there i
[1:41:11] come for a need
[1:41:13] i need to become a better christian each
[1:41:15] time i come through the door he said now

[1:41:21] my my little daughter alive at the point
[1:41:23] of death he said i pray thee come and
[1:41:25] lay thy hands on her and she be healed
[1:41:28] and she and shall live and jesus went
[1:41:31] unto him much people followed him and
[1:41:34] and thronged him he said let's drop down
[1:41:36] to he said now look verse 27 he says
[1:41:39] when he had heard of jesus came into the
[1:41:41] press behind and touched and touched his
[1:41:44] garments now remember he done here he
[1:41:46] this way he performed two miracles from
[1:41:48] jairus's daughters and it comes from the
[1:41:50] woman but each time i'm showing it here
[1:41:52] they came in reverence they came in
[1:41:55] humility
[1:41:57] they came knowing that they was going to
[1:41:59] get something from god but it wasn't for
[1:42:02] themselves

[1:45:48] want to pray for him
[1:45:49] and we got there and i prayed with him
[1:45:52] and you know the lord teaches us
[1:45:54] subconsciously they can still hear
[1:45:56] so i was made sure except that christ
[1:45:58] asked the lord to forgive him for
[1:46:00] anything that he's done his wife and
[1:46:02] them has accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:46:04] save it pray for him pray for the nurses
[1:46:07] and everyone was there
[1:46:09] i went back wednesday
[1:46:11] and when i went back wednesday
[1:46:13] i waited and waited something told me
[1:46:15] something that happened well
[1:46:17] he he transitioned over
[1:46:20] but so i called
[1:46:22] his wife when i got in touch with his
[1:46:23] wife
[1:46:25] and she said
[1:46:26] oh you went up there and prayed
[1:46:28] with him i said yes ma'am
[1:46:30] she said i went up there tuesday i
[1:46:32] didn't know she went

[1:46:35] him to forgive me
[1:46:37] she said anything that i had done she
[1:46:39] said i'll forgive you
[1:46:42] she said if you hear if you hear me he
[1:46:45] said blink your eyes and he blinked his
[1:46:47] eyes and that's why
[1:46:49] and that's what with the testimony they
[1:46:51] wanted to share how you don't give up on
[1:46:54] anyone
[1:46:55] when you're out there that's why we say
[1:46:57] you're living the life before someone is
[1:47:00] out there
[1:47:01] you live that life and god will allow
[1:47:03] you and it's been seven years that that
[1:47:06] we worked there together and that's why
[1:47:08] she said she really wasn't my daughter

[1:48:00] midst of samaria in galilee and as he
[1:48:03] entered into this shitarian village
[1:48:05] there met him ten men that were lepers
[1:48:08] which stood afar off he said and they
[1:48:10] lifted up their voices and said jesus
[1:48:12] master have mercy on me and when he saw
[1:48:15] them he said go show yourself unto the
[1:48:18] priests he says and it came to pass that
[1:48:21] as they went
[1:48:23] we're cleansed he says in one of them
[1:48:25] where he saw that he was healed he said
[1:48:28] turn back with the loud
[1:48:30] voice that's right brother a loud voice
[1:48:36] he turned back with a loud voice doing
[1:48:38] what
[1:48:39] glorifying god

[1:48:44] [Music]

[1:49:02] at his feet and give one what
[1:49:04] thanks and he was a what
[1:49:07] a samaritan
[1:49:09] and jesus answered and said we're not
[1:49:10] the tens but
[1:49:12] but where where's the other 9 see
[1:49:16] he's saying in verse 19
[1:49:18] and he said unto him arise
[1:49:21] he said and go thy way
[1:49:23] thy faith have made thee whole
[1:49:26] we know over there in revelations we're
[1:49:28] 19 when he fell down there at the feet
[1:49:30] of brother branham and he told him why
[1:49:32] he said but i'm just your brother but
[1:49:34] they just wanted to reverence him is
[1:49:36] that right
[1:49:38] and musicians y'all can come forward if
[1:49:40] i want to read this last one and then
[1:49:42] that's it
[1:49:43] hallelujah
[1:49:45] i want to read this here
[1:49:47] out of the smyrna age
[1:49:49] they want to show you
[1:49:51] sometimes
[1:49:53] when you come
[1:49:56] give me five minutes thank you jesus
[1:50:01] over there this is the smyrna church age
[1:50:04] and it says
[1:50:06] now
[1:50:07] we know that our age they're blind
[1:50:09] miserable wretched naked and rich of
[1:50:11] good and say they don't need god
[1:50:14] but god has promised us
[1:50:16] that we're going in the rapture
[1:50:18] he promised us
[1:50:19] that he's going to have a bride not a
[1:50:21] spider blemish
[1:50:23] he didn't have an ear let him hear what
[1:50:24] the spirit is saying is that right he
[1:50:26] said now but this desperation said to
[1:50:28] this age is most evidently tribulation
[1:50:31] with the tribulation in the first
[1:50:34] he says age there is nothing predicted
[1:50:36] in intensified tribulation throughout
[1:50:38] the second he said there is no doubt but
[1:50:40] what the following words of paul applied
[1:50:42] to the mass christians were in the world
[1:50:45] in every age you can go to hebrews 10
[1:50:47] and 32 he says but call to remembrance
[1:50:50] the former days in which after he were
[1:50:52] illuminated he says now i'm gonna drop
[1:50:55] down he says for ye had compassion of me
[1:50:58] in my bonds and took joyful of spoil of
[1:51:02] your goods
[1:51:04] he said now you look he says now the
[1:51:06] lord uh now the lord almighty says i
[1:51:09] know there he's walking in the midst of
[1:51:11] his people there he is the chief
[1:51:13] shepherd of the flock
[1:51:15] he says now he says i know i know your
[1:51:19] tribulations i'm not all unmindful of
[1:51:22] your suffering see he said he's not
[1:51:24] unmindful of it he's moving as the holy
[1:51:26] spirit told us this morning he's moving
[1:51:28] you into maturity
[1:51:30] he says what a stumbling block this is
[1:51:32] so many people like israel they wonder
[1:51:35] if god really loved them he says how can
[1:51:37] god be just and loving if he stands by
[1:51:40] and watches his people suffering now
[1:51:42] remember that's when the satan tactics
[1:51:44] especially women that get by himself he
[1:51:46] always tell them that god don't love you
[1:51:47] people don't love you he's a liar he
[1:51:50] says wherefore thou has love see
[1:51:52] he says was not esau jacob's brothers he
[1:51:56] said the lord ye have loved jacob and i
[1:51:59] hated who esau and laid his mountain and
[1:52:03] i laid his mountain and his heritage
[1:52:05] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:52:07] he said they could not figure out what
[1:52:09] god's love
[1:52:12] he said they thought that love meant no
[1:52:15] suffering
[1:52:19] he said they thought that love meant
[1:52:21] that they thought that love meant a baby
[1:52:24] with their parents who care
[1:52:26] he said but god said that his love
[1:52:29] was what elective love that's right
[1:52:32] brother sam his love was elective love
[1:52:36] you have been elected by god you have
[1:52:39] been chosen by god
[1:52:41] he said now look the proof of his love
[1:52:44] is what election
[1:52:47] ah
[1:52:50] look how simple it is
[1:52:52] see how simple it is
[1:52:54] he said he said no matter what happened
[1:52:57] his love was proven truly by the fact
[1:53:00] that they were chosen unto what
[1:53:03] salvation
[1:53:07] why do you have to restore the joy
[1:53:10] of the bride's salvation when you have
[1:53:14] been chosen and elected by god for
[1:53:18] salvation
[1:53:23] amen
[1:53:24] we're trying to bring you into something
[1:53:26] when that script if you pull that
[1:53:27] scripture up when brother branham used
[1:53:29] that scripture when when it was there in
[1:53:32] there is when that fellow came there on
[1:53:34] that platform and when he came on that
[1:53:36] platform and you look at you pull it up
[1:53:39] he got god between him and that man
[1:53:43] that was that come in there and was
[1:53:44] spinning his face
[1:53:46] all he said was lord
[1:53:49] he knew he needed to get god between him
[1:53:51] and that man
[1:53:53] so that he wouldn't speak something
[1:53:55] harmful on that man
[1:53:58] you understand why that why that that
[1:54:01] that song was in there no that scripture
[1:54:03] was there for that point in that message
[1:54:06] can't remember the mess i think it was
[1:54:08] in the breach under brother steve i
[1:54:09] think it might have been the breach
[1:54:10] y'all could check in and see him could
[1:54:12] pull it up and see why he said that
[1:54:15] hallelujah
[1:54:19] god
[1:54:20] hallelujah help me lord
[1:54:23] i got about two minutes
[1:54:26] and we got it
[1:54:28] he says no matter what happened his love
[1:54:31] was proven by the fact that we're chosen
[1:54:34] unto salvation because god have chosen
[1:54:37] you to salvation through sanctification
[1:54:40] of the spirit and belief of the truth he
[1:54:43] says he may commit you to death as he
[1:54:45] did paul he may commit you to suffer as
[1:54:48] he did job
[1:54:49] he said that is his pr his prerogative
[1:54:52] that's right brother sam he is sovereign
[1:54:55] but it is all with a what purpose
[1:54:58] and he says he that's right brother
[1:55:00] steve always he did not have a purpose
[1:55:03] then he would not offer a frustration
[1:55:06] and not of peace his purpose is that
[1:55:09] after we have suffered a while
[1:55:12] we would be made perfect be established
[1:55:15] strengthened and settled as job said
[1:55:19] he put strength in us i'll stop there i
[1:55:22] believe we got the point help me lord
[1:55:25] hallelujah let us bow our heads

[2:01:09] ghost
[2:01:10] which is given unto
[2:01:12] us

[2:02:00] exactly what he is giving you amen and
[2:02:03] what is giving you is actually built
[2:02:06] it's like god already pre-built god can
[2:02:09] never put a message in this end time
[2:02:13] without tested the material
[2:02:16] amen
[2:02:17] if they would have put luther in this
[2:02:19] age we will be in trouble
[2:02:21] because justification you cannot stand
[2:02:23] in that level of luther today
[2:02:26] amen
[2:02:27] because we see lutheran today look where
[2:02:29] they are
[2:02:31] we see pentecostal today look where they
[2:02:33] are
[2:02:34] we see methodists today we see
[2:02:36] presbyterian there is nobody they can't
[2:02:38] get control over what is coming up in
[2:02:40] the world there is only one message that
[2:02:43] has been predestinated
[2:02:46] fit
[2:02:47] built prepared
[2:02:49] built for this age
[2:02:51] it's only the message of william marion
[2:02:56] amen
[2:02:58] i can't tell you enough you've seen
[2:03:00] people that left the message go see them
[2:03:04] go see them not me just go see them
[2:03:08] amen they thought if the back
[2:03:11] from the message they leave the message
[2:03:12] the backup of the message they're going
[2:03:14] to stand
[2:03:16] it doesn't work
[2:03:17] we try they try before you know it
[2:03:19] somebody's in the paint somebody's
[2:03:21] indeed somebody's in this somebody
[2:03:23] because they didn't understand the
[2:03:25] spirit of laodicea
[2:03:29] amen
[2:03:30] the whole hell the lead of hell has been
[2:03:32] opened up that's why brother branham
[2:03:34] said in 63 when he went in just a penny
[2:03:37] he saw that coming as a
[2:03:40] from there from the water
[2:03:42] escalador coming up he said i saw this
[2:03:45] in hell he said hell is on earth
[2:03:48] amen if hell is on earth what else do
[2:03:50] you need you need heaven on earth
[2:03:53] amen
[2:03:54] but not only hell came down
[2:03:57] came up here but heaven also came down
[2:04:03] amen
[2:04:05] and when the heaven comes down what does
[2:04:08] it bring to you
[2:04:09] a book
[2:04:12] why why why are they bringing you a book
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:18] why didn't the mighty angel bring
[2:04:20] something different
[2:04:22] why didn't he come up with maybe a baby
[2:04:25] or maybe a car or maybe a house or
[2:04:29] coming down from heaven and say this is
[2:04:31] your house
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:34] he came with a book
[2:04:36] that book contains everything that you
[2:04:39] need
[2:04:42] amen
[2:04:43] amen
[2:04:44] it is the book of redemption
[2:04:47] oh my god and not only even not just a a
[2:04:52] a a book
[2:04:53] an open book
[2:04:56] that's why you heard john say give me
[2:04:58] the book
[2:05:00] not please
[2:05:01] may i have the book he was talking to
[2:05:03] god
[2:05:06] how can you talk to god and you say give
[2:05:08] me the book
[2:05:11] and god said no you take it
[2:05:17] amen
[2:05:18] so originally god never even want to
[2:05:21] keep the book
[2:05:24] originally he never even want to keep
[2:05:27] the book to begin with
[2:05:29] because brother branham said he was the
[2:05:30] god of the universe
[2:05:33] and command was the god of the earth
[2:05:37] and the earth was given to man as a
[2:05:40] domain
[2:05:41] so if god is giving you a domain if
[2:05:44] you're giving me a house that is paid
[2:05:46] off
[2:05:47] um i need to see the title d
[2:05:51] i'm not
[2:05:52] i'm not just gonna go in the house and
[2:05:54] then tomorrow somebody will come and say
[2:05:57] show me the paperwork this is not your
[2:05:58] house get out no i need to see the title
[2:06:01] of thee
[2:06:03] amen god created everything finished
[2:06:06] took man put him there and say you in
[2:06:09] charge take the book
[2:06:11] easy clear
[2:06:13] amen
[2:06:14] but the book could be taken back to adam
[2:06:17] and he came back again now bringing the
[2:06:19] book not sealed an open book now take it
[2:06:23] again
[2:06:24] but this time don't just take it
[2:06:29] don't just hold it like this
[2:06:32] you remember on sunday when you eat the
[2:06:34] book you and the book become
[2:06:36] and then what happened the anointing
[2:06:38] drop
[2:06:39] amen
[2:06:41] do you remember how many stuff were put
[2:06:42] in the in the temple in the old
[2:06:44] testament
[2:06:45] they put this nothing happened they put
[2:06:47] this nothing happened they put this
[2:06:48] nothing happened they put this and when
[2:06:50] they put the ark of the covenant
[2:06:53] as soon as the ark entering
[2:06:55] that was it the pillar of fire followed
[2:06:58] the ark boom and nobody was able to
[2:07:01] minister
[2:07:02] in other words god took control
[2:07:04] he was no more in the hands of man he
[2:07:07] was god himself filling his temple amen
[2:07:12] so that message that you receive the
[2:07:14] book that god is bringing you
[2:07:16] if you realize what this message is
[2:07:23] if you realize what this message is
[2:07:26] you're going to have one penny in your
[2:07:29] bank account and you go to sleep
[2:07:35] you don't believe me right
[2:07:36] you will look at your bank account and
[2:07:38] it says 0.01
[2:07:40] and you're sleeping very good
[2:07:44] and you wake up in the morning nice
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:52] amen
[2:07:53] there are people who have money they
[2:07:55] can't sleep
[2:07:59] so it's not about money
[2:08:01] amen
[2:08:02] in other words your heart is confident
[2:08:05] that's what naomi told the roof he said
[2:08:07] what did he give you he gave me six
[2:08:10] measure of
[2:08:12] say girl
[2:08:13] go to sleep
[2:08:15] don't worry about it anymore
[2:08:17] you see that man he will not rest
[2:08:20] until he had finished the work of
[2:08:22] redemption
[2:08:24] boaz was a rich man
[2:08:26] right
[2:08:27] why was he not married all this time
[2:08:33] there was pretty young women in israel
[2:08:36] why was he not married all this time
[2:08:39] he had money he was rich what was
[2:08:41] holding him
[2:08:46] you see now
[2:08:48] maybe somebody look at him this man is
[2:08:50] crazy all these women that were in the
[2:08:52] church he just waited for a widow
[2:08:55] and not only a jewish widow a gentile we
[2:08:58] don't because our first husband must die
[2:09:02] so that we can be married to boaz
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:06] you see now your first husband your
[2:09:09] first nature must die so that you can be
[2:09:12] married to
[2:09:13] jesus christ
[2:09:19] so when they say we do it doesn't mean
[2:09:21] we don't the way you see it it's the
[2:09:22] first husband that's why paul say as
[2:09:24] long as that husband is alive if you get
[2:09:27] married you're in trouble so we gotta
[2:09:28] kill the first husband
[2:09:30] when you kill the first husband when he
[2:09:32] is dead then you can be married to boaz
[2:09:38] you see now
[2:09:39] it is all different story altogether you
[2:09:43] have the book
[2:09:45] you have the message
[2:09:47] stop worrying
[2:09:49] amen
[2:09:50] take the tension off
[2:09:52] the devil is trying to make you think
[2:09:55] that the trial you're going through
[2:09:57] is god punishing you
[2:10:01] you will see that on on sunday the
[2:10:04] lord's willing
[2:10:05] you will see that on sunday he's trying
[2:10:07] to make you think that you did something
[2:10:08] wrong
[2:10:10] amen
[2:10:12] that's what he's trying to do we saw
[2:10:14] abraham his stuff was hidden
[2:10:17] he was a man of like passion they took
[2:10:19] his stuff and hide it
[2:10:20] and you thought oh abraham was always a
[2:10:23] just man
[2:10:24] he lied
[2:10:27] did they say anything about it over
[2:10:28] there
[2:10:30] you see what i'm saying
[2:10:32] it is not your perfection
[2:10:34] it is who's sitting on the tronde
[2:10:37] that's the one who's taking care of our
[2:10:39] profession all we do we confessing him
[2:10:43] and we're just pointing to him
[2:10:46] and that's it because that's the statue
[2:10:48] the the stature of a perfect man
[2:10:51] that's the man that man christ that's
[2:10:54] all
[2:10:55] perfection in this body no it's waiting
[2:10:57] for the redemption of the body but to
[2:10:59] remember you have an open book
[2:11:03] use it you have an open check
[2:11:05] use it
[2:11:06] if not you're going to suffer
[2:11:09] and while we're heading to heaven you
[2:11:10] begin to regret ah give me ten minutes
[2:11:13] i'm gonna show these people it's too
[2:11:14] late we we need to go
[2:11:16] we need to go it's the time of the
[2:11:18] rapture amen
[2:11:20] so don't live under your privilege the
[2:11:22] people in the old testament did great
[2:11:24] things a lot of things with the old
[2:11:27] atonement
[2:11:28] without we thought
[2:11:30] not even what we have here
[2:11:32] in the old atonement this woman didn't
[2:11:34] have jesus christ in flesh
[2:11:37] but she said all is
[2:11:40] how can you say all this well when
[2:11:41] somebody's dead
[2:11:44] you see
[2:11:45] you see
[2:11:46] how did you know that it's always gonna
[2:11:48] be well
[2:11:49] how
[2:11:51] in the old testament
[2:11:53] so speak good things about your
[2:11:55] situation
[2:11:57] no matter how bad it is
[2:11:59] speak what is good
[2:12:01] amen
[2:12:03] something looks bad in your eyes i'm not
[2:12:05] living in a humanistic level i am in the
[2:12:07] realm of revelation in the realm of
[2:12:10] revelation god gave me the power to
[2:12:12] speak the word so i'm going to speak the
[2:12:14] word based on the authority of the word
[2:12:18] period
[2:12:21] and we're going to wrestle brother
[2:12:22] branham say one time they therefore give
[2:12:24] him a coffin he give him back they never
[2:12:25] give him back and he keep giving back
[2:12:27] back but until he starts somewhere but
[2:12:30] not on me he's going to go back to the
[2:12:32] original owner
[2:12:33] amen because in the garden of eden there
[2:12:35] was no inheritance that say cough or
[2:12:38] coved
[2:12:40] that came from here
[2:12:42] amen we're not going to have that in
[2:12:44] your new world we won't have no sickness

[2:13:11] there is things that god built in you
[2:13:14] that's the reason why you reject certain
[2:13:17] things
[2:13:18] because god beat you for something you
[2:13:20] will see somebody is not having a
[2:13:22] certain faith and you do have it because
[2:13:24] god already built that in you so when
[2:13:26] it's that time you will feel like
