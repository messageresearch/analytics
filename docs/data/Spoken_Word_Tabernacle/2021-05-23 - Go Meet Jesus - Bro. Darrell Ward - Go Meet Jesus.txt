morning you might be seated for a minute there's only one service so give brother daryl his own time amen how many enjoy the fellowship yesterday do you did you really enjoy it okay few people okay now i can tell amen that was very very very helpful a lot of questions we went through most of them probably there were two left by the grace of god so we'll catch up on the next time lord's willing but it's very encouraging it gives us a little bit of time we can sit with brothers and sisters just talk and laugh and have a sense of humor [Laughter] if you were not there yesterday you won't understand this code so it's a special code for those that were there yesterday we had a sense of humor amen so you better be there because we don't record this and if you're not there you are losing a lot of questions and a lot of answers and sometimes you might come back again and we already answered that maybe two three times ahead or something like that already in the past so make sure you can make up your time you're there it's not only for young people adults are there just give us a time to fellowship together and have a good time amen we go to work we go through a lot of things in life sometimes we just need to sit eat talk laugh and spend some good time and we go home refresh amen and you ready to start the week everything in the sanctuary is moving pretty good they already painted the ceiling i don't have the pictures with me maybe brother david can upload it and send it he probably is streaming today so the ceiling is really is already painted they're working on the walls so lord's willing brother mike daley this week right probably this week the walls all four walls to the best of my understanding if everything goes well should be completed so the trustee had to be there look at the color and like it because the trustees and they have to agree with it and lord's willing will finish everything we put up the chandelier and they look good and everybody loved them so either we keep it secret until you get there and you're gonna see it but everything is looking pretty good it's moving well by the grace of god so you keep praying for it we're moving slowly as the finances are giving us time but one of this day if the lord terry we will be in the building amen so we have brother daryl ward if you see him preaching today it's just a miracle if probably there was somebody else he would have dodged budget and probably not being able to be here this morning he had an injury to his foot and that happened if i'm not mistaken on friday and despite that injury his leg was swell his foot was swelling and everything he still say that i'm gonna get on the road and drive and come here so at least amen amen so he made it yesterday the lord has been gracious for him and he's able to wear a shoe this morning so but daryl if you feel like you want to take off the shoe take it out we are free here amen amen so he's preaching despite the pain this is a real soldier of god i have been looking for him i know him since the old church that's the first time i saw him and for some reason over the year it seems like when they were coming and preaching the lord was breaking into my heart their caliber and i knew brother wayne and i learned most about them so i knew him by face but could not put the name with the face so i didn't know that that was bodhidero so i kept looking for him and i could not locate him and i asked my wife i say who is that preacher that when he preaches there is an anointing that usually flows like oil my wife and my and my wife look at me she said that's brother there award i say are you sure he said by the day or what i say can you show it to me so we went to youtube and brother darrell we found one of your servants okay that's him i said that's the one i was looking for so i have to chase for his number and by the grace of god we got a hold of him so if you don't know him many of you should know brother daryl here but if you don't know him just stay up and you're going to see before the end of the service you'll feel like the anointing all is dropping all over the building amen that's brother darrell so if he goes into prayer don't leave early stay with prayer because i know his ministry i know how he preaches let's give him his time his liberty his freedom brother you're not a stranger you're a part of my family so you hear take your liberty preach like home take your time there is only one service and let's bring some deliverance from heaven amen so let's stand as we're going to bring guarded all again we've only believed oh lee believe yes brother [Music] [Music] things are possible only believe me only all things are possible [Music] only believe [Music] jesus is here jesus is here now all things are yes lord jesus hallelujah jesus is here [Music] jesus is here jesus now all things are possible jesus [Music] praise the lord praise the lord i'm certainly glad that that's not just a song that we sing but that's a reality amen with the revelation that we have in this hour we certainly know where he is amen and what a privilege it is to serve the living god to know that no matter what we face in life we do not have to face it alone for he said i'll never leave thee nor will i forsake thee what a privilege it is to serve the living god this morning and uh kind of an honor to be here we're grateful that we got to come and slip fell down the steps in the in the basement and oh my boogered myself up real good and broke my big toe on my left foot and uh couldn't uh it was pretty painful but the swelling went down some this morning i was able to get my dress shoe on and so we it's kind of an honor to be here and we serve a god who can certainly touch the big toe amen amen you know i was even thinking you know the bible says that the bible says that every devil is under our feet you know so even even with the broke toe he's still under the foot amen praise the lord for that this morning if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of saint john we want to read from saint john chapter 11 this morning starting at verse 17 this little thought the lord gave us here just a while back and we trust to be a blessing to you and we just count it's such an honor to be able to serve the living god today amen just believe no matter what you have need of we serve a god who's certainly able to do exceedingly above all that we could ever hope for knowing that he keeps his word today amen saint john 11 starting at verse 17. the bible says this then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about 15 followings off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever that will ask of god god will give it thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on go meet jesus heavenly father we bow in your wonderful presence this morning and we want to thank you lord for your mercy and your grace that's been given to us for thy word says that while we were yet sinners christ died for us lord we thank you lord for the privilege we have to come and serve the living god to know lord that there's no chains of denominations and organizations upon us but whom the son hath made free is free indeed [Applause] and we are gathered here under the liberty of the holy spirit today believe in dear god that you will back up every promise of your word [Music] that we will not leave defeated for we are overcomers in this hour bless your people here lord we pray bless our brother stephen lord in his ministry and use him in a great way bless the saints of god here today lord that no matter what need they would have god may they realize today lord their need may be the greatest need in the building but it's not greater than you lord so we cast all of our cares upon you today because we know you care for us bless your word today lord that when we leave the building may we say did not our hearts burn within us as you met with us along the way granted lord for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says god bless you saints you may be seated this morning i want to call your attention back to verse 20. it says then that martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went out to meet him but mary set still in the house i believe that these two sisters that we read about in the scripture this morning represents everyone that is in this building today for the way i see it we can do one or two things we can do like martha when she heard that jesus was coming she got up and went to meet him or we can be like mary and set still in the house because you see we're going to do one or the other things we're going to be moved by one atmosphere or another atmosphere amen jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their midst amen you know many people come to church for many different reasons we know the devil comes to church to aggravate everybody amen but when he comes hallelujah when jesus comes the he comes in the power of his resurrection he sends healing in the form of his word he comes to pour out the holy ghost he comes to fulfill every promise that he's made to the believer he comes to bring deliverance he comes to bring healing he comes to bring forgiveness he comes to bring joy unspeakable and full of glory when jesus comes the tempted power is broken and when he comes we can either get up and go meet him or we can sit still in the house but i say to you this morning let's not sit still he's here his word says he's here amen he's hearing the promise of his resurrection let's get up let's step out let's possess what belongs to us this is our day this is our hour this is our time amen hallelujah the promises of god's word they are for us they belong to us amen when christ died in calgary every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer and is in our possession today amen amen we're like the sister in the communist country well they wasn't allowed to have church and the baker man was a believer and he would bake a certain bread he would leave a message to where the meeting was to be that night and so the sister went and brought the bread and she broke the bread and got the revelation of where the media was to be held and on the way to church she ran into a communist soldier aren't you glad we could still gather in the freedom but she ran into a soldier and he said where are you going she said my brother died and i'm going for the reading of the will and she goes to church and they sing the songs of zion and somebody gets healed and somebody gets saved somebody got the holy ghost somebody got delivered amen they had foot wash and then they had communion and oh my and on the way home she was singing joy is mine the holy ghost is mine peace is mine all mine just rejoicing in the lord and she ran into the same communist soldier and he stuck the rifle up in her face and said what did your brother leave you she said oh he left me everything hallelujah he left me everything every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer let's let the devil rob us of none of them amen i say to you and i brother and sister let's get up today and go meet jesus you see jesus is the answer to every problem [Music] amen i don't know who started covent china says america did america says china did i don't know who started it i just know who can stop it this morning hallelujah he's the inoculation jesus is the vaccination this morning you say i'm sick i said get up and let's go meet jesus i'm discouraged let's get up and go meet him amen [Applause] whatever you have need of this morning he is the answer amen you see all mary knew all that mary knew was death had come to their house sorrow and fear had all come to their house but martha oh my she called a revelation that caused her to get up now in our bible story death had struck this home of mary and martha and no doubt they thought how could this happen to us jesus is our friend he's slept in our spare room he's he's set at our table we're message believers we've left everything to follow him how could sorrow come to us how could the doctor's report be so bad we're his people we should never have trials we should never have troubles every day should just be blue skies and smooth sailing every day should be a picnic well those are real nice thoughts a sunny picnic does sound pretty good but you see the problem of it is jesus never promised us that come on somebody he never said we wouldn't cry he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he never said we wouldn't bury loved ones he never said we wouldn't suffer he never said we wouldn't get sick he never promised move salem he never said there wouldn't be storms he never said that but he did say i will never leave you nor will i forsake you and sometimes god allows things to come into our lives so that he can come to us and show us just how great he is you may have a great problem you may have a great trial you may have a great cancer but our god is greater this morning hallelujah he's greater than any problem this morning amen listen i'm not taking light of your suffering we have real tears we have real pain you fall down the basement steps it really hurts real tears real sorrow real pain that sciatic nerve pain going down your legs [Music] drive you crazy [Applause] [Music] real tears real sorrow real fear real loneliness but a real god hallelujah but a real god who's bigger than all of it this morning hallelujah mary and martha in this great time of sorrow in this great time of need it was their darkest hour that was mary and martha just these two girls left alone in the world their mother and their fathers done dead and they looked to their brother lazarus you know as their security blanket the one who would pay the bills the one who would look out for him it was big brother he would take care of him now he was gone the world had come crashing down around them just these two girls left alone in the world the brother was gone they said in sackcloth and black veils and weeping and mourning over their brother it was the darkest hour but the prophet of god said it's always the darkest hour that's when jesus shows up that's just the way he does it in the darkest hour amen he comes alone just at the darkest hour it was the darkest hour that the woman with the blood issue had ever seen 12 years of bleeding and the bleeding would not stop she tried everything she tried herbs essential oils young living she tried everything but she couldn't stop the bleeding and when she spent all her money sold her land and everything then the doctor said he couldn't help her wouldn't it be nice if he told that the first visit it's to the factory got all her money and then he said he couldn't help her oh but i know someone whether i've got money whether i don't got money he can still help me amen it was her darkest hour when every hope was gone that's when jesus showed up it was jairus darkest hour his little girl laying it dead but that's when jesus showed up amen and it was the darkest hour that mark the god word that jesus said come you said brother now you know i want to rejoice this morning with everybody else but i live in such a dark time i'm having such a hard time you know what that's telling me it's just about time for you to get a visitation amen amen don't quit now just keep pressing on amen just break through the barriers amen there's a blessing for you this morning there's healing for you this morning there's joy here for you this morning there's deliverance here for you this morning amen hallelujah just keep pressing on amen [Applause] it was in that dark hour that martha got word that jesus had come you see martha realized the answer to her sorrow was jesus the answer to her darkness was jesus the answer to her fear was jesus she realized god had a way provided and jesus was the answer for everything she was going through he was the answer then he's the answer now and if there's a tomorrow he will be the answer tomorrow and when she got word that he had come she got up and went to meet him because the answer to her sorrow had come it reminds me of blind bartimaeus sitting there on the rocks of the walls of jericho he wore a beggar's robe that identified him as a blind beggar and standing there in the sun trying to get a few pennies he got to thinking about his life he got to thinking you know sometimes it's good brother sister if we just slow down a little bit and think about our lives what do you really want young man in life what do you really want young cyst in life what do you really want to achieve you look at most people that strive for riches and strive for success and there's nothing wrong with having money and nice clothes and a nice car thank god for everything that we've got but when that becomes our god there's something wrong with that and you look at most of the people that sells they're sold out for popularity and fame end up hanging themselves in a hotel room somewhere because there's no life and money but sitting there he got to thinking about his life and he got to thinking about these doves that he wants he said what happened to those doves oh i remember my little girl got sick and i went behind the house and lifted up my eyes to god i said father my little girl's sick but don't take her from me lord i need her i see the world through her eyes i hear a bird sing she tells me what it looks like the color of its feathers she tells me what the clouds look like in the different images that they make i see the world through her eyes if you let her live i'll give you my dubs and she got well and he kept his promise to god oh let us be like that if we make a promise to god let us do everything within our power to keep that promise and she got well and it wasn't long after that that his wife took sick perhaps it was a pandemic or whatever it was his wife had got it too and he slipped out behind the wall of the house there and he looked up to heaven he said father my little queen is sick and i need her lord don't take her from me she cooks my food she keeps my clothes clean she puts my cup where i can always find it she puts my fork in the exact same place so i always know where it's at i need her lord if you let her live i'll give you my lamb and she got well you know the story and on the way down to the temple he read it to the priest he said blind bartimaeus we're going thou he said i'm going down to the temple to give jehovah my lamb they said you can't do that you need that lab to help you get around you know they use lambs in that day like they use dogs today is it a service animal you need that service animal to help you get around sit here here take this money go buy a lamb and give it to jehovah he said i never promised god a lamb i promised god islam and if i give god this lamb he will provide a lamb for my eyes and set him on the rock that day you know what made me say that what inspired me to say that god would provide a lamb for me and sitting there on the rock thinking about those things he began to hear a noise he said hey what someone could you please tell me what's going on and someone said it's jesus of nazareth the lamb of god he's come and we blind barnabas heard that the lamb the provided way had come he began to cry out the lamb that's my lamb amen [Applause] and he began to cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy upon me someone said hey hold your peace we don't act like that around here we just we just nod our head if we agree or just a couple of fingers if it's an amen or maybe raise a hand for a hallelujah so you need to calm down we don't get but let me tell you any word jesus is there's always a lot of noise amen [Applause] and someone said hey hold your peace but the bible said he cried the louder jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and the bible said jesus stood still but you see it wasn't his voice that stopped jesus he was more than 150 yards away and all the commotion of the crowd he would have never physically heard his voice it wasn't his voice that stopped jesus it was his faith that stopped jesus and if his faith can stop jesus your faith can stop him this morning amen right here in north carolina if his faith could stop him your faith can stop him the bible said that jesus stood still and they said he stopped and he calls for you now blind bartimaeus is left with this decision either set on the rocks or get up and go meet him [Music] the choice was his jesus had done stopped the situation was set that the two ends had come together hallelujah the channel was open but now he would either get up and go meet him or sit still on the rock but the bible said that he casting away his garment he got up he took that blind beggar's robe and before he ever got to jesus he done threw it away he was already identified himself as a seer oh hallelujah he was already testified of his healing i don't need a blind beggar's robe i'm not blind amen i've got a lamb provided for me casting away is blind beggar's robe i don't need it no more can you see what he saw he was blind as he could be he saw more than most people standing around that day he was blind as blind could be but he saw a lamb provided and i say to you my brother my sister can we this morning rise up and step towards the promised word for our day amen cast off the fear cast off asthma cast off high blood pressure cast off back trouble i don't need an arthritis rope i don't need a depression robe i don't need an asthma room i don't need a high blood pressure rope i've got a lamb provided amen [Applause] that's god's way provided for us the prophet said it's to go meet jesus got sorrow in your home go meet jesus got sickness in your home go meet jesus got heartache in your home go meet jesus hallelujah if you've got a need for anything go meet jesus go meet him he's got all the remedy and everything and then the prophet says he ain't got the remedy he got the cure jesus is the cure of everything that ails us this morning you know what the answer is for this nation it ain't the democrats or the republicans the answer for this nation is jesus christ amen [Applause] then if god provided a way for us to meet him there has to be a way for us to do that in the day we're living in or he wouldn't be just he would not be a just god to make us a promise and then not be able to keep the promise that he made us so if he made a way for us he sent a prophet in this hour to tell us he told us right here in the quote i read you the prophet of god said you got need of anything go meet jesus then there has to be a way for me to do that or he would have never anointed the prophet to say it [Applause] so when the devil will tell you there's no hope and there's no way and there's no future you're just telling me he's a liar i said the devil is a liar the answer to every problem is go meet jesus but in order to meet him you got to know where he's at if i told brother stephen brother stephen i'll meet you tomorrow at 10 o'clock what's the next thing he's going to say we're at where you want me to meet you at if i don't he'll be at starbucks and i'll be at wendy's or something so in order to meet him you've got to know where he's at [Music] now notice what jesus said in a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me how lord how will i see you you see if there's a biblical question there must be a biblical answer little while the world see me no more but you shall see me how lord how will i see you for i'll be with you even in you then where is he at he's right here in this building right now [Applause] hallelujah just like he said he would be a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me i'll be with you even in you [Applause] oh god open our eyes this morning it's not something that's going to happen it's happening right now amen [Applause] someday some happy day i say why not today why not now [Applause] [Music] amen open our eyes lord let us see if we could ever get a revelation an understanding that all he did i went to the store the other you know everybody wearing a mask of course thank god we're starting to get away from him and i went into a store and i was sitting there and a man came in the door and he must have been a local because the lady behind the cast just said john you've changed your mask and when she said that how about had a spell right there behind the cheetos don't you see my brother my sister that's exactly what he's done the same god that was with jesus he was veiled behind the mask of jesus but that same god hallelujah is now veiled behind the mask of his people making him the same yesterday today and forever he's just changed his mask same character same god same power same holy ghost hallelujah making him the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] well we want to see jesus you can only see him in the manifestation of his word that's promised in the hour that you're living in [Applause] jesus said i'm the vine you're the branch the vine doesn't bear the fruit the branch bears the fruit of the life of the vine there's no beauty in the vine the bible said there was no beauty that we should desire him the beauty's not in the vine where is his beauty it's in the branch [Applause] nobody walks up to a grapevine and says my god look at that vine but we do say look at them grapes amen the the fruit of the branch testifies of the life that's in the vine verily verily i say unto you the works i do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do because i go to the father amen now we couldn't do nothing greater than raise the dead and open blinded eyes he's done done that but the greater it doesn't mean something greater than opening the blinded eyes or raising the dead it means more amen the mystery is not it's not in the it's not the quality the quantity the quality never changes it's the same holy ghost but it's the quantity what he did in one body he's now doing in a mini membered body around the world what kind of fruit would it bear it would bear the life amen and if we're the branch amen of that vine will bear the life that he bore when he was here making him the same yesterday today and in the person of the holy ghost manifesting among the branches the prophet said your lips are his lips when you're energized your hands or his hands when you're energized your feet is his feet when you're energized from the life of divine amen [Applause] making him the same yesterday today and forever for the glory of the lord i was in nicaragua here a couple of years ago there's about 600 in the meeting he was going to have a prayer line that night it was just so many i said this we will not have a prayer line we'll have a mass prayer for everybody in the building so i told the people lay hands on one another and i was on a platform about four or five foot off the ground something like that and just as i got ready to pray i told people lay hands on each other and bow our heads we'll say one prayer and just as i got ready to bow my head a voice spoke to my heart and said go lay your hands on her and i looked and about halfway back on the end was a sister with her hand up and the voice said go lay your hand on her and i jump off the platform and i go back to where he she's at and i've not prayed so people start peeking out of their eye you know to see why the preacher ain't praying you know how we do sometimes hey man i'm from tennessee you ain't too far from me and so i got back to where she was and i just put my hand in her hand and we begin to pray and the saints begin to pray and after service the sister said can i speak to you so through an interpreter i said yes ma'am she said tonight when you told the people to lay hands on one another she said nobody laid hands on me and she said i thought lord why don't nobody want to lay hands on me why don't nobody care enough about me to lay their hand on me and she said i begin to cry because i just wanted somebody to pray for me and she said i began to cry and a voice spoke to my heart and said i'll lay my hand on you [Applause] she said that voice no sooner spoke then you put your hand in my hand and begin to pray now friends i'm not jesus you're not jesus but i believe that the anointing of christ is in me i believe it's in you using my hands using your hands using my lips using your lips [Music] the prophet said his ministry his ministry is in his bride which is his body amen we are his body on the earth today question answers the seals the bride will be the flesh and bones of christ bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit then where is he at where is he at he's right here with us now just like he said he would be just like he said it would be a little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you then look around well if i could just see jesus he'd been sitting beside you the whole service [Applause] let's go back to mary and martha just for a minute jesus said unto martha speaking to martha said thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her but i am the resurrection had the life he that believeth in me though he did yes you shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this and she said unto him yea lord that's what we need to say this morning it's not maybe not could be not hope so well i don't know we need to put all that aside and just say yeah lord [Applause] she said unto them yeah lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said the bible said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly she come to her dna oh god she come to her blood relation you see the message ain't for everybody but it is for the kind of god it is for the cg come on somebody it is for the seed genes of god amen bone of his bone flesh of his flesh genetics of his genetics she come martha came to marry her sister secretly the message wasn't for everybody but it was for the one she sought out to give it to did not jesus say you have not chosen me but i have chosen you well that ought to make you happy we're not here by accident this morning god placed us here for such a time as this [Applause] the bible said in verse 28 and we so sad she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master has come and he calls for thee and as soon as mary as soon as mary caught the same revelation that martha had the bible said she rose quickly and went to meet him [Applause] martha the church the church the water types the church martha the church comes to mary who's still sitting in the house says mary listen to me i know you're hurting i know you have sorrow i know you feel depressed i know 20 20 was a terrible year i know you're nervous i know you feel like your world's caving in i know the mask in the quarantines and the social distance is driving you crazy but listen mary listen listen to me mary he's here [Applause] he's here he's here mary and when that revelation struck her heart she rose quickly and went to meet jesus listen to me little bride i know it's a dark time i know it's a nervous time i know it's an unusual time and an evil time and a lawless time what i say to you this morning be of good cheer the master is here hallelujah he's here this morning hallelujah god's body united as a bride being one him and christ together as the spirit works in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of jesus christ because it's a part of his body not twain but one they are one a husband and wife no longer two but one and christ and his body is one and the same spirit that was in christ is in his blood his body that unites them together with all the word god living in there god living in there manifesting himself you are manifesting your creator think about this this morning think about what he's saying to us this morning oh god was he poured into christ christ was the mystery of god revealed all christ is he has poured into his church and the church is the revelation of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] think about it friends finisher listen the prophet said this the same as it is today there's many people many people today that love the lord and don't reel us you can tell them about it and yet they can't recognize he's alive forevermore tonight that he is here listen to this quote that he is here in this church tonight that he is in the midst of us and will be till he comes in the physical corporal body you say what are you saying i'm saying this he has appeared among his people but he is coming he is coming amen and he will be with us little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you you are not forsaken amen he will be in the midst of his people till he comes in a physical corporal body got trouble in your home go meet jesus god sorrow go meet jesus you got need of anything this morning he's not the remedy this ain't essential oil this is the oil [Applause] now i ain't got nothing against sensual oil i use that too i'm not kicking against that but i'm just saying friends that when the oils and the doctors and the x-rays and the mris when everything else fails us there's jesus [Applause] my daughter was struck by a train two of my family was killed every dog i worked with the doctors i worked in surgery i've did thousands of operations working with doctors in surgery for years and years i worked in surgery i'd operate on people i go to church with i used to tell them i know you inside and out i said brother i've never seen your gallbladder but when the doctor said there's no hope when the doctor said there's nothing they could do there's jesus the doctor said my daughter would always be blind but there was jesus but the doctor said my daughter would never walk again but there was jesus they said she'd never go to school but she graduated from high school because there was jesus they said she'd never drive a car but she drives a car because there's jesus amen whatever we have need of jesus christ is the answer amen [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] amen oh blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] listen to me i thank god i thank god for every miracle we have on tape just to listen to the discernment and the prayer lines oh my it's powerful and i thank god for every miracle that's on tape and i would in no wise want to do away with that the great things god done in the 60s and the 50s and the 40s but i'm so happy to know that the same god who did that back in 1965 is doing it the same thing today that same god is doing the same thing right now working through his body on the earth all around the world in poland in france in south africa in north carolina [Applause] working through his body on the earth making saint john 14 12 a reality let me share if i can if i can just for a couple of minutes some of the things that i've seen the lord do i had nothing to do with it i was simply there when it happened it's all jesus but i was in pennsylvania a sister by the name of sister betty had glaucoma that was so bad she had to wear sunglasses to come to church because the lights hurt her eyes she came up for prayer one sunday morning and the saints of god prayed for sister betty she goes to the doctor on monday that a specialist with for glaucoma he goes and examines sister betty's eyes you know what he said whoever sent you here needs their eyes examined there's nothing wrong with your eyes you're completely ill i gave that testimony in oregon at brother rich cobb's church up in salem oregon and there was a man sitting in the back who had cataracts on both eyes who was scheduled for surgery and he said if god did that for sister betty god could do that for me and the cataracts fell off of his eyes [Applause] [Music] healed him right there in church i was in france and my sister came to church her hair was shorter than mine big old earrings and had old pants and she wore a cane she was probably in her 70s she sat on the second row about right here where her sister sits and i felt sorry for her although poor woman probably had a rough life and i preached the little message the lord gave me for the sake of one what god would be willing to do for one soul and i went down and i just laid my hand on her head and i said father this poor woman probably had a rough life and now she's here on this cane i said for the sake of this one poor woman would you take her off the cane lord she didn't understand the word i said i spoke english barely she spoke french we didn't understand each other she comes to church the next morning she says i want to testify she said i got up this morning and i didn't need my cane [Applause] i was in france last year before the pandemic struck and that sister was there since that time her hair has grown out it was way down her back she repented of her sins been baptized in the
