[6:40] Lord Jesus good morning again sir we
[6:45] thank you father for putting it in our
[6:48] heart, Lord, to be here this morning in
[6:50] your presence, Lord God.
[6:52] And Lord, that's our desire this
[6:54] morning, Lord, is to trust you, Lord.
[6:58] To trust you with our our life, Lord,
[7:00] our decisions, Lord, with every step
[7:04] that we walk, Lord, every word that
[7:06] comes out of our mouth, Lord. And Lord,
[7:09] as the song says, where you send us,
[7:12] Lord, let us go, Lord God. Let us obey,
[7:15] Lord. Father, sometimes we get in the
[7:18] way, Lord God. Sometimes we doubt, Lord
[7:22] God. We just question whether or not
[7:23] it's really you even speaking to us,
[7:25] Lord. But Lord, in this little assembly,
[7:28] Lord, we've come to learn that, Lord,
[7:31] that we can trust you, Lord God. You've
[7:34] brought us through so much, Lord God,
[7:35] and you've brought us here to this
[7:38] wonderful place that you've prepared for
[7:40] us to meet you every time we come
[7:42] together, Lord. And that sweet
[7:45] fellowship does follow, Lord God. For
[7:48] the love in this congregation, Lord,
[7:50] exceeds a human realm, Lord God. It's
[7:55] agape, Lord God. It's your love that we
[7:57] have in us, Lord, that we're able to
[7:59] share with each other, Lord God, and to
[8:02] pray for each other, Lord, and to help
[8:05] each other, Lord God,
[8:07] and to worship our mighty God, together,
[8:10] Father, in unity, Lord Jesus.
[8:14] So we ask one more time Lord just one
[8:16] more time as Samson said. Come amongst
[8:20] us this morning Lord God. Make your
[8:23] presence known Lord and manifest
[8:25] yourself Lord and vindicate the word
[8:27] Lord God. We love you Lord God. We want
[8:32] to worship you this morning Lord.
[8:35] Lord if we if we have trouble with that
[8:38] trust Lord God help us Lord. Speak to us
[8:40] this morning, Lord, and let us trust
[8:43] you, Lord God, even to the things that
[8:46] might even not even sound rational,
[8:48] Lord. Just have your will and help us,
[8:52] Lord God, to obey every step. We thank
[8:56] you, Father. We ask that you bless our
[8:58] musicians this morning, Lord God. That
[9:01] you bless our singers, Lord Jesus. That
[9:04] you bless our technicians as well, Lord.
[9:06] that everything not only goes perfect
[9:08] here inside the building but across the
[9:10] stream Lord for we know it reaches many
[9:12] places Lord around the world and many
[9:15] people. Let that anointing go through
[9:16] the wire, Lord. And above all, Lord God,
[9:20] go to that little front room up there,
[9:22] Lord, and sit there with our pastor,
[9:25] Lord, and bless him, Lord God, and
[9:27] anoint him this morning, Lord, and let
[9:30] him bring forth the word as you and him
[9:31] have prepared, Lord, together, probably
[9:35] overnight, Lord God. We thank you. Bless
[9:38] him, Lord. Bless him in a special way.
[9:39] bless his family, Lord, for we know,
[9:42] Lord, it's not just his calling, but
[9:44] it's theirs also
[9:46] for a pastor. We thank you, Father. We
[9:48] give every bit of this service to you in
[9:50] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen
[9:53] and amen. Let's give him a clap offering
[9:55] this morning. Turn around and greet your
[9:57] neighbor as well and say, "Welcome to
[9:59] the house of the Lord." Amen.
[10:03] Praise God.

[10:24] [Music]
[10:30] Alas,
[10:32] and did my savior bleed and did my
[10:38] sovereign die?
[10:41] Who would he devote that sacred head for
[10:47] such a worm as I?
[10:51] Oh, at the cross at the cross where I
[10:55] first saw the light and the burden of my
[10:59] heart it brought away.
[11:02] Yes, it was there by faith. I receive my
[11:07] sight and now I'm happy all the day.
[11:13] Was it for crimes that I had done? He
[11:19] grown up on that tree.

[11:42] heart it run away.
[11:46] Yes, it was my faith. I received my
[11:50] sight and now I am. Let's sing that last
[11:55] verse. Amen. But drops of grief can
[12:00] never repay the debt of love I owe.
[12:08] Dear Lord, I give myself
[12:12] away is all that I can do.
[12:18] Oh, at the cross at the cross where I
[12:22] first saw the light and the burn of my
[12:26] heart it roll away.
[12:29] Oh, it was there by faith. I receive my
[12:34] sight and now I am happy all the day.

[12:44] quickly comes. Sweeping over the

[32:34] "Let's begin with praise."
[32:37] I just began to praise the Lord and this
[32:39] came back to me. Something happened to
[32:41] me last night. I was working the yard
[32:44] and then just before like about 8:30 the
[32:47] sun began to go down and with a
[32:49] thunderstorm coming. So I wrapped up all
[32:52] my tooth, put them away, but um had a
[32:55] little assembly to do a chair for my
[32:58] wife. So I said, "Well, I'll just sit
[33:00] here and work on that until the rain
[33:01] comes."
[33:03] So working, it was dark by that time. So
[33:05] just sitting there, open everything out,
[33:07] the screws, everything. Um,
[33:11] and the the bits to turn the the nuts,
[33:13] you know, and then one of the screws
[33:18] and some of the washers fell into the
[33:21] grass.
[33:22] Now, I've had challenges with my
[33:24] eyesight recently. I told the doctor
[33:28] when I went to the I doctor last month,
[33:31] this late earlier this month, he said,
[33:34] "The scan in my eye shows damaged optic
[33:37] nerves." And um
[33:40] the testimony of the man who was born
[33:43] blind just came at the right time for
[33:46] me. He said, "Never from the foundation
[33:48] of the world has someone who was born
[33:50] blind receive sight."
[33:52] Um, and I told that doctor, "Never
[33:56] before, but you will see regenerated
[34:00] optic nerves in my eyes pretty soon." I
[34:03] really believe that. And he looked at
[34:05] me. He said, "You and me both, you
[34:07] know." So, last night, I'm looking for
[34:11] stuff. It's dark. Using my phone. I
[34:14] mean, grass is everywhere. Things fell
[34:16] inside the grass. Um, I couldn't see
[34:19] any. I just something inside me said
[34:21] just say you will you'll find it and
[34:23] something else say by this I know that I
[34:26] have received my healing for my eyes
[34:27] fresh eyesight I don't want to prolong
[34:30] it but God is my judge I found every
[34:32] single piece
[34:34] just like that boom boom boom not one
[34:38] time but then the bit fell into the
[34:41] grass as I pick it up from the package
[34:44] it fell I didn't see where it fell so I
[34:46] took another bit I say well you know the
[34:49] scripture that Jesus said, "I have lost
[34:50] none. I I hate losing things." Jesus
[34:53] doesn't lose anything. So I said, "Lord,
[34:55] I will find it. It's getting late.
[34:57] Minister 10. I'll find it sometime." He
[34:59] said, "No, persist." And sure enough, I
[35:03] just I found that one too. Then another
[35:05] one fell. I said, "Lord, this is too
[35:07] much." But Lord, I believe you. I'm not
[35:09] going to give up. And by God's truth, I
[35:12] found that also. Thank God. Amen.
[35:18] Wonderful. Wonderful.
[35:20] Amen.
[35:24] Amen.
[35:26] Amen. Let's stand this morning. Wasn't
[35:29] it three times with the squirrels with
[35:30] brother Brandham? It's three times with
[35:32] the bits for brother Robert. He found
[35:34] every one of them. Hallelujah.
[35:38] Amen.

[40:20] with your husband, brother Micah Curtis.
[40:22] Yeah. God bless you and welcome again
[40:25] from brother Jason Watkins. So when you

[40:35] him. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. And
[40:38] those online, invisible audience, God

[40:42] subscriber online. God bless you. I
[40:44] believe I got that cover. I believe we
[40:46] are all up to date with the sermon.
[40:49] We're reading our Bible twice a day. Our
[40:51] cood book, Church Ages, 70 weeks of
[40:54] Daniel, the seals, adoption, or somebody
[40:58] is listening to the message of the hour.
[41:00] Amen. I'm going to go through my
[41:03] announcement quickly. on July the 19th.
[41:07] This is the first one coming up. It's
[41:09] our question and answer. I believe it's
[41:10] the third one if I'm not mistaken. Same
[41:13] place, July the 19th. And then on August
[41:17] the 9th, that is the Youngsman meeting.
[41:19] We start courtship part two. Then August
[41:23] the 30th, that's the renewal of vow for
[41:26] brother uh Kelly and sister Joanne. That
[41:29] is 50 years of marriage. Amen. So the
[41:32] whole church is invited. You don't need
[41:34] any official invite, I mean invitation.
[41:36] Just know that you invited, you be
[41:38] there. It's going to be in a hotel, same
[41:40] way uh same facility that we have the
[41:42] married couple meeting. Amen. I believe
[41:45] you already received the date for the
[41:47] married couple meeting. So the married
[41:49] couple meeting by God's grace, the date
[41:51] was open for September the 20th, 20
[41:55] September 20th for part seven. And then
[41:59] because of the difficulty of the venue,
[42:01] I just anticipated and then we went and
[42:04] booked December the 13th for part 8. So
[42:07] just remember September the 20th and
[42:09] December uh the 13th. So you got like
[42:12] five month and three month to make all
[42:15] your arrangement and everything to be
[42:17] there. Amen. Praise God. Uh sister
[42:20] Lurel's birthday is coming up next week.
[42:23] I believe it's the 4th. And uh the
[42:27] reason why is uh you see what's going on
[42:29] on the ground. We got things laid up
[42:31] left and right. So it's going to be
[42:32] difficult for us to have the fun day for
[42:35] the children going back to school. We
[42:37] don't want anybody to get hurt with the
[42:39] material because the ground is under
[42:41] preparation for construction. So sister
[42:43] Lurel offered up so we can do that at
[42:46] her home. So if you're not having any
[42:48] program, just head to Sister Laurel's
[42:51] home and then we will have some
[42:53] fellowship together and good time. The
[42:54] whole church is invited. You just be
[42:56] there by God's grace and continue to
[42:58] play to pray for the building project.
[43:01] Sometime it's going quickly, sometime
[43:03] it's not depending on on us. We have to
[43:05] wait till we cross all the check mark
[43:08] checkpoint by the city before you move
[43:10] on to the next one. We were trying to
[43:12] get the sheetrock finished, but when we
[43:14] ordered the sheetrock, the order split.
[43:17] So some came on uh Friday and the other
[43:20] one have to come on Monday. So the
[43:22] guy have to come on Tuesday. So
[43:24] everything has been pushed up. So just
[43:26] be patient. God knows everything is
[43:28] working together for good. And I want to
[43:31] apologize that last Sunday I had to take
[43:34] care of certain business after service
[43:36] as a pastor. So you could not wait for
[43:39] me to be there for my wife birthday to
[43:41] cut the cake. So pastor's wife, I mean
[43:44] life is a little bit complicated, but
[43:46] everybody got a cake. So because of
[43:48] that, we have to come back again.
[43:52] [Laughter]
[43:54] Because I want to set up a good example
[43:57] for the children in church knowing that
[43:59] when mama have a birthday, daddy must be
[44:01] there. So you're going to have a second
[44:03] cake today.
[44:11] So sister Joella, those who missed last
[44:15] Sunday, God gave you a double grace. So
[44:18] if you were not there, you got a cake
[44:19] for this Sunday. And those that were
[44:21] there last Sunday, you got a double
[44:22] portion. So, it's for free after
[44:25] service. I'll make sure this time I'm
[44:27] there. I'm I didn't tell her anything.
[44:30] So, I believe in the laws of redemption
[44:34] that you can get you you can redeem
[44:36] yourself and go back to the original
[44:38] position. Amen. So, after service,
[44:41] everybody's invited the cake there. So,
[44:43] I'll make sure to rush quickly and to be
[44:45] there. At least we can sing happy
[44:47] birthday to Sister Sharon. Amen. Oh my
[44:50] god. All the credit we give it to her.
[44:53] Amen.
[44:55] Any problem? Anyway,
[44:58] [Laughter]
[45:00] [Applause]
[45:03] brother Glenn, I believe I got
[45:04] everything covered. By God's grace, I
[45:07] don't want to get in trouble. So, you
[45:08] stay tuned and let's go straight to the
[45:10] reading of the word. This is again, we
[45:13] will pick up where we stopped last
[45:14] Sunday. So, pay attention because we
[45:16] need to dig into this thing. I hope you
[45:19] will allow me to have plenty of time and
[45:22] you would do good. Uh oh
[45:27] because I'm having difficulty with you.
[45:29] Every time I beg you doesn't end up
[45:32] being the same way. So please focus and
[45:36] by God's grace everything is well. So
[45:38] flight attendant prepare for takeoff. My
[45:42] subject this morning
[45:45] is our life journey through Joseph's
[45:48] five garments part 67.
[45:54] Our subject this morning is a thorn in
[45:58] the flesh.
[46:01] A thorn mim.
[46:04] A thorn
[46:06] in the flesh.
[46:09] Now these are the type of lesson
[46:14] if you stop halfway it's a problem.
[46:18] So we got to go all the way. We are
[46:21] going all the way right sister divine
[46:24] all the way. We have to go all the way.
[46:26] So you promise to go all the way. You're
[46:29] not going to get tired.
[46:32] Few people.
[46:36] Let's pray my friend. Heavenly Father,
[46:38] Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[46:41] morning. Father, we thank you for your
[46:43] grace, for your love, your mercy, and
[46:45] for everything you have been doing for
[46:47] us, Father, this is as far as I can go
[46:50] with the ability you have given me,
[46:52] Lord. Father, but when it comes to
[46:54] speaking to your brother, Father,
[46:56] interpreting the word of God, it's only
[46:58] a supernatural action of the Holy
[47:00] Spirit, Lord, I pray that you move me
[47:03] completely out of the way, please. And
[47:05] may you move the audience also visible
[47:08] and invisible out of the way that you
[47:10] may come down and speak to our soul and
[47:12] bless us Lord. Father revive us Lord.
[47:16] Encourage us Lord and remove every
[47:18] attack from the world of darkness Lord.
[47:21] Father we commit this service unto thy
[47:23] hand. Be the alpha and the omega in the
[47:26] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's go to
[47:30] Job chapter 14
[47:33] again.
[47:35] Glory to God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[47:43] I hope you slept well, right?
[47:48] Praise God,
[47:50] my friend. We there. Glory to God. Amen.
[47:52] All right.
[47:55] Job chapter 14 verse one. If you dare,
[47:58] you can say, "Amen." Amen. The Bible
[48:01] says a man that is born of a woman,
[48:05] everybody here is born of a woman. The
[48:08] only one The only one that was not born
[48:12] of a woman was Adam and Eve.
[48:18] He's Eve was born from Adam.
[48:22] Let me leave it alone. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[48:26] A man that is born of a woman is of a
[48:30] few days. So our time are very limited.
[48:33] In other words, short leave. Come and
[48:37] full of trouble. You might be seated. So
[48:40] by default, we getting into unchartered
[48:43] territory. We're getting into the world
[48:46] full of trouble.
[48:48] Into a world full of trouble.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:56] So who put us in this world
[49:00] full of trouble? Let's go to Jeremiah 29
[49:03] verse 11.
[49:07] I'm just coming the same scripture then
[49:09] we take off.
[49:11] Jeremiah 29 verse 11. If you dare, you
[49:14] can say amen.
[49:18] Glory to God.
[49:21] The Bible say, "For I know
[49:24] the thoughts that I think toward you."
[49:27] We clear on that one, says the Lord.
[49:30] Thoughts of peace
[49:32] and not of evil to give you an expected
[49:37] end. Amen. So even though we are in the
[49:40] world full of trouble, nevertheless, the
[49:43] thoughts of God toward us are thoughts
[49:45] of peace, not of evil. Amen. but to give
[49:49] us an an expected end. In other words, a
[49:52] a good end. Let's go to John chapter 9.
[49:57] Praise God. You're moving very fast
[50:00] today. Glory to God.
[50:04] John chapter 9 verse one. If you dare,
[50:08] you can say amen.
[50:10] The Bible says, "And as Jesus passed by,
[50:13] he saw a man which was blind from his
[50:17] birth.
[50:19] And his disciple asked him saying,
[50:21] "Master, who did sin?" We already went
[50:25] through the scripture. "This man or his
[50:28] parent that he was born blind?"
[50:32] Jesus answered, "Neither has this man
[50:35] seen nor his parent." But in other
[50:39] words, the blame is not on a man. The
[50:42] blame is not on his parent. M but we
[50:44] need to find where is the origin of the
[50:47] I mean the cause who who who who started
[50:49] this problem. Amen. He say but that the
[50:53] works of God should be made manifest
[50:56] where in him. So the man was victim of
[51:00] the works of God.
[51:03] Amen. He was victim of the plan of God.
[51:07] Amen. It is the plan of God that open up
[51:09] to this issue this trouble the trouble
[51:12] of his eyes. Amen. In other words, who
[51:15] is the or the the the the the cause?
[51:18] Uhhuh. Of the problem. Uhhuh.
[51:22] It's who? God.
[51:26] God.
[51:29] Being responsible
[51:35] for an illness.
[51:43] Huh?
[51:45] And go preach to this young man. You say
[51:47] God have a good thoughts about you.
[51:54] Thoughts of peace
[51:56] and not on evil.
[51:59] Would you have an amen from that boy?
[52:01] No. I'm just asking you because this is
[52:05] how we behave when trouble comes. when
[52:08] you are going under problem when they
[52:09] say God loves you, you say I guess
[52:15] because you're going through headache.
[52:16] Amen. Amen. But the Bible says the
[52:18] reason why this boy is suffering is
[52:21] because God picked this boy. Uhhuh. God
[52:25] chose this boy. God predestinated this
[52:29] boy
[52:32] to trouble. Uhhuh. Right. Amen. And God
[52:36] will use the trouble to glorify his
[52:39] name. That's right.
[52:41] Yes, sir.
[52:43] There is no ministry greater than the
[52:46] ministry of Jesus Christ. No.
[52:49] And the ministry of Jesus Christ was
[52:52] connected to this boy. Amen.
[52:56] Are we together? Amen. So when God was
[52:59] uh putting together the ministry of
[53:01] Jesus Christ, he also inserted this boy.
[53:05] Amen. So this boy was part of the
[53:07] ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[53:11] Amen. Amen. His testimony will vindicate
[53:14] the Messiah. Amen.
[53:18] You can refine again sister Adasa. Amen.
[53:21] His testimony was connected to the
[53:24] Messiah. Amen. In other words, God
[53:26] needed the testimony of this boy to
[53:30] convince certain people. Uhhuh.
[53:33] So your testimony has a purpose. That's
[53:36] right. The trial you're going through
[53:38] has a purpose. That's right. God is
[53:40] going to use that trial to help somebody
[53:42] else. That's right.
[53:44] And not only to help, even to condemn
[53:46] the Pharisees. Amen.
[53:52] Are we together? Amen. Why only my
[53:54] child?
[53:57] Everybody goes to the hospital, they
[53:59] came up with a child without any
[54:00] problem. Mine came up blind. Oh God,
[54:03] what have I done?
[54:05] What is going on in my life? Have I
[54:07] sinned? Did it not walk in your ways?
[54:10] What have I done? You going to go all
[54:12] along going, claming here, seeking for
[54:15] prophecy everywhere to find out what is
[54:18] going on. What have I done that my child
[54:21] is born that way? Sometime it doesn't
[54:24] have anything to do with you.
[54:27] It doesn't have anything to do with
[54:29] grandfather.
[54:30] You will find witches everywhere. Uhhuh.
[54:35] Maybe was so and so who was in the
[54:37] hospital that day. Maybe was that
[54:39] doctor. You will blame everybody. It's
[54:41] not about it's about God. That's right.
[54:45] Are we together? Amen. Let's go to John
[54:49] 16.
[54:53] Oh, glory to God.
[55:01] Go preach to this family. You say, "God
[55:04] have thoughts of peace." Mhm.
[55:07] And not of evil. Mhm. Will you have an
[55:11] amen? Amen. They will be sitting on me.
[55:18] Amen. Amen.
[55:20] Let's go to John 16:33. Then we take
[55:23] off. If you're there, you can say amen.
[55:26] Amen. I'm warming the engine.
[55:30] These things I have spoken to you, this
[55:33] is Jesus talking. That in me
[55:38] in Christ. Amen. Amen. You might have
[55:41] peace. Remember, so peace is where? In
[55:44] Christ. In Christ. If you're not in
[55:46] Christ, you cannot have this peace.
[55:48] Uh-huh. Amen. Amen. Amen. So make sure
[55:51] you in Christ. Amen. Because there are
[55:54] trouble in this world. This world is
[55:56] full of trouble. Amen. And you need a
[55:59] peace that can stand any trouble. Amen.

[56:12] clear? Amen. Amen. The Bible says,
[56:15] "These things I have spoken to you that
[56:19] in me you might have peace
[56:22] in the world."
[56:26] So there is one of you in Christ. Amen.
[56:30] Amen. And one of you in the world. Amen.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:37] One of you That's right. is in the
[56:39] world. Uh-huh. And one of you That's
[56:42] right.
[56:43] is in Christ. Amen. The one who have
[56:46] peace is the inner man. And he need to
[56:49] stabilize the outer man. Uh-huh. He need
[56:52] to tell the other man, "Chill up."
[56:54] Uh-huh.
[56:56] Quiet. All is well. Uh-huh. That's
[56:59] right.
[57:01] Amen. Amen. So, make sure the inner man
[57:04] is connected in Christ. Amen. Because if
[57:06] he's connected in Christ, then he has
[57:08] peace. Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[57:12] Peace doesn't mean that there is no
[57:14] trouble. That's right. Matter of fact,
[57:15] when you say peace, Uh-huh.
[57:19] Somehow there were trouble. That's
[57:20] right.
[57:23] Come on. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[57:25] together? Amen. When you say peace, it
[57:27] means war is somewhere. Uh-huh. But in
[57:30] the middle of war, you have peace. Amen.
[57:34] Amen. Amen.
[57:37] Glory to God. Come on. In the world, you
[57:41] have what? Tribulation. But be of good
[57:44] cheer. Remember last Sunday? Uh-huh. I
[57:48] Uh-huh. I'm glad it's not me and you. I
[57:51] have overcome the water, the world. So
[57:53] Jesus is already telling you ahead of
[57:55] time, just know you're going to have
[57:57] tribulation. Amen. Know that a man born
[58:00] of a woman is full of trouble. But just
[58:03] know that I am your peace. Amen. And

[58:16] able to overcome. Amen. Matter of fact,
[58:18] he will not overcome. He already
[58:20] overcame. Amen. That's why he meant
[58:23] that's why he say at the cross, it is
[58:25] finished. Come on. So don't make Jesus
[58:28] work again. No, he's already finished
[58:31] the job. Amen. The problem is up to you
[58:33] to have faith. That's right. To the
[58:36] finished work. Uhhuh. So you can reap
[58:38] the benefit of it. Amen.
[58:41] Are we together? Amen. Are we clear?
[58:43] Amen.
[58:45] Like I said, my theme this morning is a
[58:48] torn in the flesh. We have been dealing
[58:51] with this series right here. Amen. With
[58:54] the three element that are connected
[58:56] with our prayer. According to
[58:58] Ecclesiastes 3 verse one, the Bible says
[59:02] that to everything there is a season and
[59:06] a time to every purpose under heaven. So
[59:10] when you living under heaven or in this
[59:12] earth here, we dealing with our time.
[59:15] When it come to prayer, we're dealing
[59:18] with season. And the third element that
[59:20] we dealing with is a purpose. Amen.
[59:23] Amen. And with the purpose, I have
[59:25] insisted a lot. and I will continue to
[59:28] do it until the Lord tells me not to do
[59:31] it. According to Ephesians 1 verse 11,
[59:34] the Bible says that in whom also we have
[59:37] obtained what? An an inheritance being
[59:40] predestinated according to the purpose
[59:43] of him. Uhhuh. Who workketh how many
[59:45] things? All things. How? All after the
[59:49] council of his own what? Will. So your
[59:52] purpose goes with predestination. That's
[59:54] right. And that predestination goes with
[59:57] the will of God. Uh-huh. Amen. That's
[59:59] why everything in your life. Uh-huh.
[1:00:02] Whether it's good. That's right.
[1:00:07] Uh-huh. A blessing. Uh-huh. Whether it's
[1:00:10] bad. That's right. Amen. And it looks
[1:00:12] really bad. Uh-huh. It looks very bad.
[1:00:15] Uh-huh. Bad. Amen.
[1:00:19] He
[1:00:21] Uh-huh.
[1:00:22] who is working according to the purpose.
[1:00:24] That's right. Your bad might not be my
[1:00:28] bad. Uhhuh. Your bad is depending on
[1:00:31] what God will fulfill in your life.
[1:00:32] Amen. Amen. Man depend on what God will
[1:00:36] fulfill in my in my life. Amen. But we
[1:00:39] know that everything will orchestrate
[1:00:41] together toward one direction. That's
[1:00:43] right. For my good. That's right. That's
[1:00:46] why Paul says in Romans 8 verse 23, what
[1:00:50] we know. How many people know? We know.
[1:00:53] How many people know? We know. Uh don't
[1:00:56] don't look at me. I'm going to say it to
[1:00:57] myself. I know. I know. I know. What do
[1:01:00] I know? I know that everything Uh-huh. I
[1:01:03] know that all things does what? Works
[1:01:06] together. For what? For the good. So the
[1:01:09] purpose of God is for what? The good.
[1:01:12] Ah. So that's why everything in my life
[1:01:14] work together for what? The good. If you
[1:01:16] bring fire for good. That's right. You
[1:01:19] bring sickness for good. That's right.
[1:01:21] You bring trial for good. That's right.
[1:01:23] You bring blessing for good. That's
[1:01:24] right. It doesn't matter what is coming
[1:01:26] in. What is coming out will be always
[1:01:29] good. Amen.
[1:01:31] Amen.
[1:01:35] Talk to the devil. Tell the devil.
[1:01:38] Everything that will come from you
[1:01:40] toward my life. Uh-huh. will be always
[1:01:43] for good. Amen. So the devil is working
[1:01:46] for you. That's right. Amen. The more
[1:01:49] trial, the more good. That's right. The
[1:01:52] more trial, the more good. That's right.
[1:01:54] The devil.
[1:01:56] Come on. Come on. Say, "Pray for your
[1:01:59] enemy." Uh-huh. Your enemy work for your
[1:02:02] good. That's right. Whatever Satan will
[1:02:05] do for good. That's right. In other
[1:02:07] words, Satan is your instrument. Amen.
[1:02:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:16] Come on. I don't know if we together,
[1:02:20] brother Charles. Here. Your place is
[1:02:21] here. Come and say amen. Here. Come on.
[1:02:24] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:02:28] Uh-huh. Sorry. Are we together? Yes.
[1:02:31] Hallelujah. Praise.
[1:02:33] Now you starting pulling me out. Uh-huh.
[1:02:36] Who is the king of all animal? The lion.
[1:02:39] Lions. The lion. The lion. That's
[1:02:41] correct. If you need the quote, I will
[1:02:43] give it to you. Uh-huh. Who is the king
[1:02:45] of all animal? Lion. It doesn't mean
[1:02:48] that the lion is the most powerful. No.
[1:02:53] Uh-huh. I hope you're understanding.
[1:02:56] Uh-huh.
[1:02:58] If you take a big tree Uh-huh. and you
[1:03:01] give a lion, the lion will never push
[1:03:03] the tree. That's right. And bring it to
[1:03:05] the ground. I don't know if you
[1:03:07] understand. Uh-huh. But an elephant will
[1:03:10] do that. That's right. So if you look at
[1:03:12] the lion and the elephant, the elephant
[1:03:15] the elephant is more stronger. That's
[1:03:17] right. He's even more bigger. That's
[1:03:19] right. He can even do things that the
[1:03:21] lion cannot do. Uh-huh. But when the
[1:03:23] lion is walking Uh-huh. Come on. Come
[1:03:27] on.
[1:03:30] Uh-huh.
[1:03:33] When the lion is walking Uh-huh. and the
[1:03:36] lion sees the elephant. Uh-huh.
[1:03:38] Come on. The lion look at the elephant.

[1:03:47] No matter how big the elephant look to
[1:03:50] the lion, the elephant is a steak. Come
[1:03:53] on. In other words, the lion have the
[1:03:56] ability to reduce the elephant. Amen.
[1:04:00] Into a come on.

[1:04:39] right. A true leader doesn't look at the
[1:04:42] problem. No. A leader reduces the

[1:13:38] friend. We entering the surgery. You did
[1:13:40] very good. Amen. Amen. But we know that
[1:13:43] according to the atonement, the Bible
[1:13:46] says in Matthew 8:16
[1:13:48] that when the evening was come, they
[1:13:51] brought unto him many that were
[1:13:52] possessed with water, devils, and he
[1:13:55] cast out the spirit with his word, and
[1:13:57] healed all that were water. that it
[1:14:00] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:14:02] Isaiah the prophet saying himself did
[1:14:05] what? Took our infirmities and bear
[1:14:07] what? Our sicknesses.
[1:14:09] Amen. In other words, Jesus is
[1:14:12] anti-infirmity.
[1:14:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:17] Jesus doesn't like infirmity. He would
[1:14:19] take infirmity away from you. Amen. The
[1:14:21] very atonement remove Amen.
[1:14:25] And the Bible says in Hebrew 4, for we
[1:14:28] have not a high priest which cannot be
[1:14:31] touched with water, the filling of our
[1:14:32] infirmities, but was in all point
[1:14:35] tempted like as we are, yet without
[1:14:38] water. So even Jesus standing on the
[1:14:41] throne, sitting on the throne there, his
[1:14:44] anti- infirmity. Amen. But Paul come and
[1:14:47] Paul say, you know what, I glory in my
[1:14:50] infirmity. Amen. How can you glory in
[1:14:53] something Jesus is taken away? Uh-huh.
[1:14:57] Welcome to the surgery, my friend. Let's
[1:14:59] go to second Corinthian chapter 11.
[1:15:04] Oh, glory to God. You've been doing
[1:15:07] good, so don't slow me, please.
[1:15:13] If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:15:15] Follow me very carefully, my friend.
[1:15:18] If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:15:20] Verse one, it is not expedient for me
[1:15:25] doubtless to glory. In other words, it's
[1:15:28] not necessary to boast. Paul already
[1:15:32] understand that of a truth. It's not
[1:15:35] good to boast. Paul understand that. But
[1:15:38] we know the reason why he's boasting
[1:15:39] because somebody else begin to boast.
[1:15:42] And Paul say, you know what? We shut our
[1:15:43] mouth too much. It looks like we are
[1:15:45] nothing. Let's let let's at least say
[1:15:47] something so you understand that. Don't
[1:15:50] worry about what they are boasting. 2
[1:15:52] Corinthian 12 verse one. Amen. Amen. It
[1:15:55] is not expedient for me doubtless to
[1:15:58] glory. I will come to vision and
[1:16:02] revelations of the Lord. Remember in
[1:16:04] chapter 11 he explained everything how
[1:16:06] he was bigoted and all the apostle and
[1:16:08] how he suffered for Jesus Christ. Now he
[1:16:11] reached a point he say now let me boast
[1:16:14] about vision and revelation.
[1:16:17] This is what Paul is saying. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:19] So now I'm going to talk about vision
[1:16:21] and revelation. He say I will come to
[1:16:24] visions and revelation of the Lord.
[1:16:28] I knew a man where in Christ. Notice he
[1:16:32] is in Christ.
[1:16:35] Because when brother Brandham was not in
[1:16:37] Christ, he went to hell. Amen.
[1:16:42] [Laughter]
[1:16:46] Is that a problem? No. Is that a
[1:16:49] problem? No. Jesus went to hell because
[1:16:51] he died as a sinner. That's right.
[1:16:54] Uh-huh.
[1:16:59] Somebody, let me help you. Don't worry.
[1:17:01] Let me help you. Help me. Let me help
[1:17:02] you. Don't worry. In the garden of
[1:17:04] Gethsemane, Uh-huh. the the pillar of
[1:17:06] fire left him. That's right.
[1:17:09] That's why he was crying, "My father, my
[1:17:11] father, why have thou what? Forsaken
[1:17:13] him." In other words, the father left
[1:17:15] him. That's right. And the reason why
[1:17:16] the father left him is because he took
[1:17:18] your sin. That's right. And my sin, he
[1:17:21] took the cup and drunk it. That's right.
[1:17:22] So, so from Gethsemane, Jesus became a
[1:17:26] sinner. Amen. That's right. Amen. Not
[1:17:29] the sin he did. No. But the sin he
[1:17:31] carried. That's right. Amen. Are we
[1:17:34] together? So when you die as a sinner,
[1:17:37] Uhhuh. automatically your ticket is
[1:17:40] toward hell. That's right. But God was
[1:17:42] working for a purpose. That's right.
[1:17:45] Because there was no way to send the
[1:17:47] atomic the B2 bombers. Uhhuh. The bunker
[1:17:51] buster bomb could not enter hell. And
[1:17:55] the one who carried that bomb was Jesus
[1:17:57] Christ. Amen. So we got to find a way to
[1:17:59] insert Jesus Christ. Amen. As a Messiah
[1:18:03] agent. Amen. Into the territory of the
[1:18:06] devil. Amen. So God can flesh Jesus.
[1:18:10] Amen. As a sinner. Amen.
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:13] I don't know if you understanding me. So
[1:18:15] when Jesus is coming from her in her the
[1:18:18] daughter the sinner is coming. That's
[1:18:20] right.
[1:18:22] Come on. I don't know if we together.
[1:18:25] When he knock the door Lucifer say
[1:18:27] another one. Uhhuh. But when he openhu
[1:18:30] he was the holy one. Amen. He came with
[1:18:33] his theophony. Amen. That's right.
[1:18:39] Are we together? Amen. And when the
[1:18:41] devil realized he was too late, That's
[1:18:43] right. Israel already penetrated Iran.
[1:18:46] Amen. He took the keys of hell. Uhhuh.
[1:18:49] And the keys of death and kick the
[1:18:52] devil. That's what brother. That's
[1:18:53] right. That's what he said. Uh-huh.
[1:18:59] Are we clear so far? Amen. We clear so
[1:19:01] far. So when you die as a sinner, you go
[1:19:03] in where? To hell. Straight to hell.
[1:19:07] That's why Jesus went to hell. That's
[1:19:09] right. But the problem is to drop a
[1:19:12] banker based
[1:19:14] it then he came out. Amen. And he
[1:19:17] emptied paradise and he went back up
[1:19:20] again. Are we together? Amen. Brother
[1:19:22] Branom was shot by his friend by
[1:19:24] accident. Then he lost conscience. Then
[1:19:27] he dropped down to hell. Uhhuh. Because
[1:19:29] he was not saved yet. That's right.
[1:19:35] I hope we together. Amen. But when
[1:19:37] brother was saved, brotherham went to
[1:19:40] the sixth dimension. That's right.
[1:19:44] I hope we are together. Amen. So if you
[1:19:46] are saved, you have no ticket toward
[1:19:49] hell. That's right. Amen. If anything
[1:19:52] happen to you, straight to the six
[1:19:55] dimension. That's right. Amen. Thank
[1:19:57] you, Lord.
[1:19:59] Are we together now? We clear so far.
[1:20:02] Now Paul is saying anoint man.
[1:20:05] Verse two where? In Christ. In Christ.
[1:20:09] We clear now. Because to see this thing,
[1:20:13] you must be in Christ. Amen. If you a
[1:20:16] sinner, you cannot go there. Amen. Are
[1:20:19] we together now? Amen. He says, I know a
[1:20:21] man in Christ above water 14 years ago.
[1:20:26] Whether in the body, you follow me?
[1:20:28] Amen. I cannot tell. or whether out of
[1:20:31] the body. Mhm. If you don't understand
[1:20:34] clearly, Paul is breaking something
[1:20:36] there. Yes, sir. Mhm. In other words, a
[1:20:38] prophet can see vision two ways. Yes,
[1:20:41] sir. Uh-huh. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. He
[1:20:44] can see vision being in his body. Amen.
[1:20:47] Or sometime the prophet can come out.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:51] Reading the Bible. My friend, the
[1:20:53] message of brother Brandham is perfectly
[1:20:56] with the Bible. Amen. That's why brother
[1:20:58] Brham saw himself coming out. Amen. And
[1:21:01] he turned around, he saw brother Brham
[1:21:03] laying there. Amen. But brother Brham is
[1:21:05] in another dimension talking to the
[1:21:07] center. Amen. Because a prophet can see
[1:21:10] vision in the body or out of the body.
[1:21:12] Amen. Brother Brham vision are
[1:21:14] scriptural. Amen.
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:19] Have I lost somebody? Okay. He says
[1:21:22] where they in this body I cannot tell.
[1:21:25] Where they out of the body?
[1:21:27] I cannot tell. Who knows? God knows. God
[1:21:30] knows. Such a one was caught up where?
[1:21:32] In to the third heaven. So the first
[1:21:35] experience of Paul, he went to the third
[1:21:37] heaven. Amen. We will deal with that one
[1:21:39] day. We started and we stopped. We will
[1:21:42] deal with that. You will know what is
[1:21:43] the third heaven. Uhhuh. If the Lord
[1:21:45] tell you, you will know what is the
[1:21:47] third heaven. Amen. Because this is
[1:21:48] where we going. That's right. And you
[1:21:50] will know what is the third in heaven.
[1:21:51] You cannot with the message of brother
[1:21:53] Brandham. cannot enter in heaven and be
[1:21:56] surprised. No.
[1:22:00] Even if you die today, Uh-huh. when you
[1:22:02] go into the sixth dimension, we already
[1:22:05] have the map. Amen. You will see trees.
[1:22:08] Uhhuh. You will see a creek. And you
[1:22:10] know this is the sixth dimension.
[1:22:11] Uh-huh. Where are you guys? And you will
[1:22:13] see them coming up. To welcome you.
[1:22:16] Amen.
[1:22:18] We have them up, my friend. Amen.
[1:22:20] Because the seals are broken. Amen.
[1:22:22] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Let's
[1:22:26] continue to climb, my friend. That was
[1:22:28] the first vision. Uh-huh. Verse three.
[1:22:31] And I knew such a man. Yes. Whether in
[1:22:34] the body, again, a second experience or
[1:22:38] out of the body, I cannot tell. What?
[1:22:40] God knoweth. How he was caught up into
[1:22:43] what? Paradise. So Paul went to two
[1:22:45] places. Uhhuh. He went to the third
[1:22:48] heaven. Then he went to paradise. Amen.
[1:22:50] This paradise is not the Old Testament
[1:22:53] paradise. No. Because the Old Testament
[1:22:55] paradise was done with Jesus Christ.
[1:22:58] That's right. Jesus Christ removed all
[1:22:59] the scent and took them to heaven. This
[1:23:02] is the sixth dimension for us. Amen. Are
[1:23:05] we together? Amen. Because now we are
[1:23:07] going with the blood of Christ. Amen. No
[1:23:09] more the blood of bulls of goat that
[1:23:11] kept them under Lucifer. Uhhuh. Are we
[1:23:14] together? Amen. Paul says, "And then I
[1:23:17] heard water unspeakable words which is
[1:23:20] not lawful for a man to but brother
[1:23:23] Brandham told us the conversation
[1:23:27] and of such a one without glory. So the
[1:23:30] man that went to heaven is not Paul the
[1:23:33] physical. No, it's not brother Brandham
[1:23:36] the physical.
[1:23:38] I don't know if you're understanding me.
[1:23:40] Brother Brham said he turned around and
[1:23:43] he saw himself laying there. But on this
[1:23:45] side, he was young. Uhhuh. That's what
[1:23:48] brother Brandham said. Amen. Because he
[1:23:50] enter his theophony. That's right.
[1:23:54] Are we together? Amen. So it's a
[1:23:56] guarantee that brother Brandham is
[1:23:58] saved. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:24:02] Yes, sir. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:24:05] together? So Paul is saying, I'm
[1:24:07] glorying for that person. Amen. Uhhuh.
[1:24:10] Not this one. Yes, Lord. Amen. the man
[1:24:14] in Christ, not the man in the world.
[1:24:17] Follow me, my friend. I'm growing for
[1:24:19] that man. For that man, I can say big
[1:24:22] things about him. Amen.
[1:24:25] I'm going slowly, my friend. This is a
[1:24:27] heart surgery, my friend. We clear. He
[1:24:30] said, I will glory of such a one. Yet in
[1:24:34] myself, you see the flesh. Yes. In Paul,
[1:24:37] the flesh, yet in my flesh, I will not
[1:24:40] glory. But by but in my what?
[1:24:43] infirmities. So Paul is dividing the
[1:24:46] spiritual man. Uh-huh. Amen. Amen. And
[1:24:50] the natural man. Amen. When he come to
[1:24:53] the spiritual man, Paul say, "I will
[1:24:55] glory." Amen. But when it comes to the
[1:24:58] natural man, Paul say, "I will glory
[1:25:00] here about my infirmities." That's
[1:25:02] right. So these infirmities are
[1:25:04] infirmities of the flesh. Uhhuh.
[1:25:08] Amen. Amen. Of the body. Amen. of the
[1:25:12] flesh, of the physical man.
[1:25:16] We clear so far? Amen. Paul says, "For
[1:25:19] though verse six, I desire to glory, I
[1:25:23] shall not be a fool." You understand
[1:25:25] this now? Amen. For I will say so I will
[1:25:28] say the truth
[1:25:30] but
[1:25:32] and now but now I foray lest any man
[1:25:36] should think of me above that which he
[1:25:39] sees me to be or that he hears. In my
[1:25:42] word if I begin to unfold this stand of
[1:25:44] stuff, you will begin to look at me like
[1:25:47] a big guy. Amen. Like whoa Paul. Wow.
[1:25:51] Uhhuh. Wow. I wish I can be like Paul.
[1:25:54] Uh-huh. I wish I can be like Elijah.
[1:25:57] Elijah pray and and the heaven was shut
[1:26:01] down. And James say, "Hey, chill out."
[1:26:05] He was a man of light pass. That's
[1:26:07] right. As you. That's right. In other
[1:26:10] words, you can do it. That's right. Come
[1:26:12] on. You can do it, too. You can do it,
[1:26:14] too. You see your up and down. Don't
[1:26:17] look at your up and down. You can also
[1:26:19] do it. He He did it with an up and down.
[1:26:21] Amen. And as a matter of fact, they
[1:26:23] didn't have the Holy Ghost seal in them.
[1:26:24] That's right. But you got the Holy
[1:26:26] Ghost. If a man without the Holy Ghost
[1:26:29] is up and down can close the heaven,
[1:26:32] what will you do with the Holy Ghost in
[1:26:33] you? Amen. Amen.
[1:26:37] Do you understand? Amen. He was a man of
[1:26:40] light passion like you. And in other
[1:26:41] way, he make mistake sometime, but the
[1:26:44] mistake didn't change him. Amen.
[1:26:48] The mistake never remove his confidence.
[1:26:50] Uh-huh. Amen. Hallelujah. Are we
[1:26:54] together? Amen. Verse seven. And lest I
[1:26:58] should be exalted
[1:27:00] above measure through the abundance of
[1:27:03] revelation. So this man have a really
[1:27:06] channel of revelation. There was given
[1:27:08] me a what? A thorn. A thorn where in the
[1:27:12] flesh. So this thorn is not in the
[1:27:14] spirit of Paul. We going slowly my
[1:27:17] friend. The thorn is where? in the
[1:27:20] flesh. So the throne affect the physical
[1:27:23] part. That's right.
[1:27:26] [Music]

[1:27:32] The messenger of Satan. We know a
[1:27:34] messenger means what? Angel. Are we
[1:27:37] together? Amen. A messenger means what?
[1:27:40] An angel. An angel of Satan is what? A
[1:27:42] demon.
[1:27:45] So now, who sent the demon? God did. Oh

[1:28:28] But we will see really that mean. Amen.
[1:28:32] Lest I be exalted above what? Measures.
[1:28:35] So the purpose of this guy

[1:28:53] Paul goes, "Ah,
[1:28:57] he humbles Paul a little bit." Uhhuh.
[1:29:01] Amen. So if a demon is poking, what does
[1:29:04] he mean to Paul?
[1:29:07] Revelation. Amen. Too much revelation.
[1:29:12] Too much revelation. Uhhuh. When the
[1:29:14] poor the poor the poor they remind Paul
[1:29:16] they say you just got too much stuff
[1:29:18] there. I mean too much delivery from
[1:29:20] heaven. Uhhuh.
[1:29:24] If no poking no delivery. Uhhuh.
[1:29:28] Amen. We will go there. I hope we are
[1:29:30] together. Amen. Amen. So when Paul
[1:29:34] received so much revelation because you
[1:29:36] need to understand this thing because
[1:29:39] the angel that opened the book of
[1:29:41] revelation Uhhuh. to John.
[1:29:44] You know that angel, right? We went
[1:29:46] through that angel, the angel with the
[1:29:48] seven vow. You know who he is, right?
[1:29:51] And we demonstrated by the scripture
[1:29:53] that he was brother. That's right. Amen.
[1:29:55] He he showed John so much revelation.

[1:30:09] angel. That's right. And the angel said,
[1:30:11] "Don't do it." No, I am just one of the
[1:30:14] fellow the prophet. Amen.
[1:30:18] Are we together? Amen. And Paul preach
[1:30:21] in part. Uhhuh.
[1:30:24] Amen. Are we together? And Paul preach
[1:30:27] in part. But brother Brandham preached
[1:30:30] the fullness. That's right.
[1:30:32] Are we together? Amen. If Paul had a
[1:30:35] turn because of the part of revelation.
[1:30:39] Amen. What do you think will happen to

[1:30:53] Job 2 verse 8. For this thing, because
[1:30:57] of this trouble here and we need to know
[1:31:00] what was that trouble today. For this
[1:31:03] thing, I did what? Besought the Lord. I
[1:31:06] seek the Lord how many times? Thrice.
[1:31:08] Jesus prayed how many times? Thice.
[1:31:10] Three times. Bail and pay how many
[1:31:12] times? Three times. And Paul is praying
[1:31:14] how many times? In other words, Paul is
[1:31:16] begging, please remove this thing right
[1:31:18] here.
[1:31:21] And God comes. Amen. Amen. Trust that he
[1:31:25] might depart from me. Do you see the
[1:31:28] word Paul is using that he might do
[1:31:30] what? Depart. When you want somebody to
[1:31:33] depart, where is that person?
[1:31:36] Uh-huh. He's closer to you to love.
[1:31:38] Uh-huh. Yes, sir. So, where Paul is
[1:31:41] going? Who's following Paul? The thorn.
[1:31:43] Uh-huh.
[1:31:46] Yes, sir.
[1:31:49] You have a problem? No. You don't
[1:31:51] understand that.
[1:31:54] Inside of Paul is the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:31:56] right. Outside of Paul is a demon.
[1:31:59] That's right. You got two trees. That's
[1:32:01] right. That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] Uh-huh.
[1:32:06] Are we together? Uh-huh. Amen. Oh my
[1:32:10] God. Let's go to verse nine. And he said
[1:32:12] to me, this is the Lord, my grace is
[1:32:15] what? Sufficient for thee. For my
[1:32:17] strength is made how? Perfect in
[1:32:20] weakness. In weakness. So Paul, when you
[1:32:23] going through this demon crisis here,
[1:32:26] Mhm. this is when my strength Amen.
[1:32:29] Uhhuh. is now perfected. Amen.
[1:32:34] Ah, so you mean when I'm sick?
[1:32:38] Hallelujah. That's when you get stronger
[1:32:41] in me. Amen.
[1:32:44] God say, "What do you think?" Amen. Paul
[1:32:46] say, "I thought when I am sick, it means
[1:32:49] I didn't have enough faith."
[1:32:52] Amen.
[1:32:57] Uhhuh. I thought when I am sick, it
[1:33:00] means I did something wrong. Uhhuh.
[1:33:04] And I'm getting punished for it. Uh-huh.
[1:33:08] This has nothing to do with Paul
[1:33:10] sinning. It goes with the revelation of
[1:33:14] God. It is the revelation of God that is
[1:33:18] bringing problem to Paul. Amen. I don't
[1:33:21] know if we together. Amen. Lord help me.
[1:33:25] If you don't understand this, don't
[1:33:27] serve God.
[1:33:32] I don't know if you understand what I'm
[1:33:34] saying. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:38] Let's go, my friend. He says, "My
[1:33:40] strength is made perfect." How? In
[1:33:42] weakness. Most gladly, therefore, in

[1:52:23] How do you say that Paul? How how can
[1:52:25] brother Brandham say he had problem with
[1:52:26] his eyes? You don't take the scripture
[1:52:29] to challenge Malachi 4.
[1:52:33] You need to ask brother Brana to take
[1:52:36] you to the Bible. Amen. If you see a

[1:52:44] Brandham say, leave that church.
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:54] Let me start it again. Let me start it
[1:52:57] again. If brother Brandham say a

[1:53:02] that way. No preacher can challenge
[1:53:05] Malachi. Amen.
[1:53:10] Amen. If you don't see it yet, maybe
[1:53:12] you're not the one to preach it. Maybe
[1:53:15] it's not your time yet. Amen. But never
[1:53:18] take the written word to challenge the
[1:53:21] word made flesh. Amen. You go to the
[1:53:24] word made flesh and let him take you to
[1:53:26] the written word. Amen.
[1:53:31] It is absurd.
[1:53:36] The Bible says this brother said this
[1:53:38] brother we need to stick with the Bible.
[1:53:40] So you are more than brother.
[1:53:44] So you know more than brother.
[1:53:48] Amen. What a proud. You humble yourself.
[1:53:54] When Moses say look at the serpent.
[1:53:57] Which scripture does he have? Scripture.
[1:54:00] Matter of fact, a serpent represented
[1:54:02] sin. God challenge Moses. You challenge
[1:54:06] him, you die.
[1:54:09] Amen.
[1:54:12] I don't know what's wrong with
[1:54:13] ministers. They're sitting and making
[1:54:16] video, video, video. We're trying to
[1:54:17] prove that what brother Brandham says
[1:54:19] here is not correct because the Bible
[1:54:21] says this. We still message believer.
[1:54:23] But in in this point, who are you?
[1:54:26] Hallelujah.
[1:54:28] Amen. If you begin to correct brother
[1:54:31] Brham, so you are more than brother
[1:54:33] Brham. So we need to listen to you to
[1:54:36] tell us what to believe in the message.
[1:54:44] Yes sir. I don't know what's wrong with
[1:54:45] ministers.
[1:54:47] Repeat the message. Stay under the
[1:54:50] brother. Brother, if you don't
[1:54:51] understand it, leave it alone. Amen. Go
[1:54:55] to prayer. Study and pray God to open
[1:54:59] your eyes. Amen. Because at the end you
[1:55:02] found out brother was right. Amen.
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:10] The Bible say Paul got healed. Brother
[1:55:14] Brandham say he had the trouble of his
[1:55:16] life. Where is that in the Bible? Amen.
[1:55:20] Can I continue? Amen. Wow. He says and
[1:55:23] he said one time except I should be
[1:55:25] exalted above what? The abundance of
[1:55:28] revelation there was given to me a what?
[1:55:30] A thorn in his flesh a messenger of
[1:55:32] Satan to do what? Because he was the
[1:55:35] abundance of what? The revelation. So
[1:55:38] brother Brham begin to connect the
[1:55:40] throne with the eyes.
[1:55:45] But the Bible say Paul was healed. Amen.
[1:55:48] True sir. But Paul says there is a thorn
[1:55:52] in me.
[1:55:54] Where is that tone coming from?
[1:55:58] Glory to God. Brother Brham says Paul
[1:56:01] saw what? Delight in so much that he
[1:56:04] even did what? Blinded him. He could not
[1:56:06] see for several days, three days. It was
[1:56:09] such a reality to him and he could not
[1:56:12] see for several. Later on when he wrote
[1:56:15] the letter, his eyes did what? Bothered
[1:56:18] him. Now you see, you see now, you see
[1:56:21] now bother him how so bad until he wrote
[1:56:25] with what? Bigger letters. He said,
[1:56:28] "Seeing that I have written to you with
[1:56:30] what? Large letters." He couldn't hardly
[1:56:33] see it.
[1:56:37] Now the prophet begin to connect you.
[1:56:41] You who are quick on the trigger.
[1:56:45] Amen. Galatians 6:1. See how large what
[1:56:50] large letter I have written unto you
[1:56:52] with my own what? Why was he riding with
[1:56:55] large letter?
[1:56:57] [Applause]
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:00] But brother Steven, I thought he was
[1:57:02] healed. Yes, he was healed. But he came
[1:57:05] back again. Amen.
[1:57:08] So are you insinuating
[1:57:11] that
[1:57:13] this problem of the eyes is what the
[1:57:15] infirmity was all about?
[1:57:18] me. I need a scripture.
[1:57:21] Let me nail you on the scripture.
[1:57:24] Galian water. Four. Galian water. Four.
[1:57:28] First water. 13. You know how through
[1:57:31] what? If you're meeting of the flesh.
[1:57:34] Now we clear now. I preach the gospel
[1:57:37] unto you at what? The first. And my
[1:57:39] temptation which was where in my flesh
[1:57:42] ye despise not what? rejected but
[1:57:45] receive me as a what? Angel of God. Even
[1:57:48] as who? Jesus Christ. Christ Jesus. They
[1:57:52] receive Paul as who? Christ Jesus.
[1:57:59] If I get into that, we won't go nowhere.
[1:58:03] They receive Paul as who? Christ Jesus.
[1:58:07] So we will receive brother Braham as
[1:58:10] Christ Jesus.
[1:58:13] Let me start it again. Would they
[1:58:15] receive Paul as who? Christ Jesus. And
[1:58:18] so brother Brandham is receive as who?
[1:58:20] Christ Jesus. Was Paul Jesus Christ? No.
[1:58:24] Did they worship Paul? So where is the
[1:58:26] problem?
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:30] Amen. He says you receive me as Christ
[1:58:33] Jesus. Where is then the blessedness you
[1:58:37] speak of? For I bear you record that if
[1:58:40] I had been what? Possible. You would
[1:58:42] have done what? Block out your own eyes.
[1:58:45] And have done what? Gave them to me.
[1:58:49] Are we now together? Amen.
[1:58:53] Please help me up.
[1:58:56] Paul is now describing his infirmity.
[1:59:00] Brother only gave you one quote. But me,
[1:59:04] when brother says something, I humble
[1:59:06] myself. If I have a revelation and I
[1:59:09] look at brother Brham and brother
[1:59:11] Brandham say A, I say B, I take B, I put
[1:59:13] it in the trash. Yes, sir. Amen. Because
[1:59:16] this one is vindicated. Amen. And
[1:59:18] because I did that, God open another
[1:59:20] scripture. Are we together? Now Paul is
[1:59:23] explaining his infirmity. He say you saw
[1:59:26] me preaching with infirmity and if it
[1:59:29] was possible, you would have done what?
[1:59:31] Bluffed out your own eyes. So the
[1:59:32] infirmity was what? his eyesight. If
[1:59:35] Paul was today, he would be wearing
[1:59:37] glasses.
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:48] Amen.
[1:59:54] So, are you calling yourself Paul?
[1:59:57] I didn't say that. If Paul was living
[1:59:59] today, he will boot to the eye doctor.
[2:00:02] Matter of fact, he was walking with
[2:00:03] Luke, who was a doctor with him,
[2:00:07] preaching the gospel with a doctor.
[2:00:12] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:00:14] Amen. So me and you, we are clear now.
[2:00:17] Are we together? That's the problem of
[2:00:19] Paul was what? His eyesight. And who
[2:00:22] started the problem? The light. The
[2:00:24] light.
[2:00:26] And who heal him the first time?
[2:00:28] And God let a demon to continue with his
[2:00:31] eyes.
[2:00:33] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:00:36] Hallelujah. Now we begin to understand.
[2:00:38] And Paul went he say I cannot read good.
[2:00:41] I cannot read good. God say
[2:00:48] tomorrow. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[2:00:51] Jesus. Lord I can see better. I can pick
[2:00:55] up those screws better.
[2:00:58] Amen.
[2:01:01] I didn't tell him to give the testimony.
[2:01:03] He gave the testimony himself. I didn't
[2:01:05] tell him. Amen. I didn't tell him to put
[2:01:07] the testimony. He came together. Amen.
[2:01:12] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:01:16] Why was he given to him that problem?
[2:01:20] Hallelujah. Paul, brother, brother say
[2:01:23] we notice that Paul the great revelation
[2:01:27] that he heard of Jesus Christ, who he
[2:01:30] was. He was so great to know. Well, God
[2:01:34] put it in the Bible. That is how great
[2:01:36] he was. That is the reason he was given
[2:01:39] a thorn in the flesh. To keep him how?
[2:01:43] Down. So he would not get big
[2:01:47] and exalted.
[2:01:49] God kept him how? Down. And how? Small.
[2:01:52] So he can use him in different part of
[2:01:54] the country.
[2:01:56] Amen. We moving on my friend. Do for him
[2:02:00] what he want to because he had the
[2:02:02] revelation of Jesus Christ who he was.
[2:02:06] Are we clear? Amen. Paul understood that
[2:02:08] Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus.
[2:02:11] Brother Brandham say Paul had more
[2:02:15] by revelation than Peter
[2:02:18] than James than John than any of them.
[2:02:22] Amen. Because he seen him when after
[2:02:26] after he had been gone for how many
[2:02:28] years? Two years or more standing where?
[2:02:31] In the pillar of fire talking to him.
[2:02:33] How much greater today?
[2:02:38] 2,000 years. He's still alive. The
[2:02:41] pillar of fire that was with Paul
[2:02:44] returned back again. Amen. What do you
[2:02:46] think it's coming? Yes, sir.
[2:02:51] Oh, glory to God. He say there was
[2:02:55] giving me except I get what? Exalted
[2:02:57] above. Saying now, brother, I'm above
[2:03:00] you all. See, I see him after he was
[2:03:02] raised from the dead. I talked to him.
[2:03:05] Except I got exalted above there. They
[2:03:08] was giving me a what? Some something
[2:03:10] they was giving me to keep me how
[2:03:12] humble. He was the one who taught them
[2:03:14] to rebaptize
[2:03:16] again in Jesus name. And he said if an
[2:03:19] angel from heaven
[2:03:25] and brother Brham say the disciple in
[2:03:27] the age of Ephesus were challenging the
[2:03:30] minister by telling them you don't say
[2:03:32] what Paul say
[2:03:34] if you preach even if an angel come down
[2:03:37] from heaven you preach different than
[2:03:39] brother Brham
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:44] let him be a curs. Amen.
[2:03:47] And because of the big office, God say,
[2:03:51] "Uh-uh." Boy, oh boy, he's still in the
[2:03:53] flesh.
[2:03:55] Help dispatch one.
[2:03:58] Which one? The one that attack optic
[2:04:01] nerve. Bring him here.
[2:04:05] Ah, come on now.
[2:04:08] Come on now. Bring him here.
[2:04:11] Bring him here.
[2:04:14] And suddenly, brother Paul said, "But
[2:04:16] Lord, you hit me. this before. I was
[2:04:19] healed. I remember praying last year for
[2:04:22] this headache you heal me. But the
[2:04:23] headache came back again.
[2:04:30] Can I continue? Amen. Can I continue?
[2:04:33] Amen.
[2:04:36] I hope we getting the point, my friend.
[2:04:39] He was in jail and he asked the Lord to
[2:04:41] heal him of it and he consulted him how
[2:04:44] many times? Three times. But what did
[2:04:46] the Lord say? My grace is what?
[2:04:48] Sufficient. Sufficient. Paul. Paul said
[2:04:51] then without glory how in my infirmity.
[2:04:54] Because he said except I will be exalted
[2:04:57] above the abundance of revelation. There
[2:04:59] was given me what? A messenger of the
[2:05:01] devil. A what? A thorn in my flesh to do
[2:05:04] what? Buffet me. He get better for a
[2:05:07] while and then away they go again.
[2:05:13] Here it is.
[2:05:15] Hallelujah. I hope we are together. So
[2:05:17] this problem is periodic
[2:05:25] my friend. Help me preach it. It is a
[2:05:28] periodic
[2:05:30] seasonal
[2:05:34] seasonal allergies.

[2:05:44] forward.
[2:05:48] Are we to Can I continue? Amen. My
[2:05:50] friend, you need to minimize everything
[2:05:53] the devil is doing. And knowing that
[2:05:56] even seasonal allergy work together for
[2:05:59] good. Amen.
[2:06:02] [Applause]
[2:06:05] Are we together? Amen. Why do you get
[2:06:07] better after a while? Uh-huh. And then
[2:06:09] he comes again. Then you get better
[2:06:12] after a while. Are we together? Amen.
[2:06:16] My friend, are we together? Amen. But
[2:06:19] the problem say means what? Blown after
[2:06:23] blow.
[2:06:26] Are we together? So it comes
[2:06:31] and then thank you Jesus for healing me.
[2:06:34] It feels so good. Praise the Lord. And
[2:06:37] after a while,
[2:06:40] Lord, what is wrong?
[2:06:44] There is a mystery, my friend.
[2:06:47] I have it. Let me leave it. Amen. Like
[2:06:50] the ship on the sea. Yes. You know the W

[2:06:59] then have it again. Then he get better
[2:07:02] then what? Have it again. Then he said,
[2:07:04] "Lord, what's the matter? You don't take
[2:07:07] this away from me.
[2:07:13] Who's doing that? God. Amen. And then he
[2:07:17] says my grace is how
[2:07:20] just what? Keep.
[2:07:23] In other words, God is telling Paul,
[2:07:26] don't mind him.
[2:07:28] You keep moving.
[2:07:31] Ah, Lord help me.
[2:07:34] He said
[2:07:36] Jesus. He said now if he was just what
[2:07:40] perfect and everything what? Perfect.
[2:07:42] Then when I went along I get puffed up
[2:07:45] and say you see nothing is wrong with me

[2:08:10] Then when brother Mick is sick, you will
[2:08:12] understand. When brother Greg is sick,
[2:08:15] you will pray for him. Amen.
[2:08:20] In other words, when I come, I say, "Oh,
[2:08:22] my brother, are you going through the
[2:08:23] humbling process? Don't worry, you're
[2:08:26] going to come out right."
[2:08:30] Amen.
[2:08:31] Can I continue my friend? Amen. Can I
[2:08:34] continue? Amen.
[2:08:37] Brother said God has to give you a
[2:08:40] little something
[2:08:43] once in a while to kind of what?
[2:08:47] Full of strength, my friend. To make you
[2:08:50] up a little, you know. That's why I kind
[2:08:52] of make you realize he is what? The
[2:08:54] boss. Oh, isn't he wonderful? Yes, sir.
[2:08:59] Just watch. Glory.
[2:09:09] [Applause]
[2:09:12] I have opened the right atrium. So I
[2:09:15] need to go to the left one. Okay. So
[2:09:17] brother Steven, you mean that problem
[2:09:20] are periodic?
[2:09:23] Me I'm having a hard time understanding
[2:09:25] this. Let's go to second Timothy.
[2:09:28] First Timothy 5, please help me so we
[2:09:31] can go quick. First Timothy 5.
[2:09:35] Hey, hey, hey. I have an analogy the
[2:09:38] Lord drop on me. But some of you are
[2:09:41] super super spiritual. So it's difficult
[2:09:45] for me to drop it.
[2:09:48] You know, you need to be careful what
[2:09:51] you say on the pulpit.
[2:09:53] Let's go to First Timothy 5.
[2:09:57] When I do this, it just kind of
[2:10:00] loosening you up so you can soak what is
[2:10:02] coming.
[2:10:03] First Timothy 5:23. If you there, you
[2:10:06] can say amen. Are we there? Are we
[2:10:09] there? Are we there?
[2:10:13] This is the the scripture drunker use.
[2:10:19] Amen. Amen.
[2:10:24] To drink. To drink.
[2:10:27] Like a brother say, "I got two wives, so
[2:10:29] I need to drink whiskey." Who told you
[2:10:31] to marry two wives? Polygamy is wrong.
[2:10:35] [Applause]
[2:10:36] Brother Brandham say it's a life of a
[2:10:38] pig.
[2:10:40] Hallelujah.
[2:10:42] You get two wife, you deal with them.
[2:10:44] But polygamy is wrong.
[2:10:47] Deal with them. Yes. Amen. I'm going to
[2:10:50] drink whiskey. That's your problem. Soo
[2:10:52] yourself. Amen.
[2:10:55] First Timothy 5:23. This is Paul
[2:10:58] advising Timothy. He said, "Drink what
[2:11:01] water
[2:11:03] but use a little water." He was leader.
[2:11:06] Yours is a whole bottle.
[2:11:11] Every day.
[2:11:13] He said, "Drink no longer water but use
[2:11:16] a little water." Why? for your stomach's
[2:11:20] sake and your
[2:11:24] what how are those infirmities
[2:11:28] the infirmity are
[2:11:31] so Timothy will get better
[2:11:35] and after a while
[2:11:37] Timothy got problem with his stomach
[2:11:44] why is God not taking that off That's
[2:11:49] I don't know if we together. Amen. I
[2:11:51] don't know we together. Amen. Paul
[2:11:53] looked at him. He said, Timothy, no, no,
[2:11:54] no, no. Don't continue like this because
[2:11:56] God is using Timothy a lot. But often
[2:11:59] Timothy got a problem with his stomach.
[2:12:03] So that was another buffeting
[2:12:06] that was given to Timothy to keep the
[2:12:09] gospel moving. Oh my God. Amen.
[2:12:14] Paul says this in Romans 5. And not only
[2:12:17] so, but we glory in what? Tribulations
[2:12:21] also knowing that tribulation work what?
[2:12:24] Work it patience. Amen. How can you
[2:12:27] glory in tribulation? So if you in
[2:12:29] tribulation, you go see Paul. Paul is
[2:12:31] laughing.
[2:12:34] Paul, what happened? Something good to
[2:12:35] you? Of course, my brother. What
[2:12:37] happened, man? They put me in jail
[2:12:39] yesterday.
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:12:48] I don't know if you understanding me. I
[2:12:50] don't know if you understanding me. What
[2:12:53] God is showing here is when tribulation
[2:12:56] come, if you cry,
[2:13:00] nothing will happen.
[2:13:02] Hallelujah.
[2:13:05] I hope you understanding me. But if you
[2:13:07] change your attitude
[2:13:10] in the midst of the tribulation, then
[2:13:13] God come down. Amen. Amen.
[2:13:17] I hope you understanding me. Because
[2:13:19] that tribulation is necessary. That's
[2:13:22] why Paul and Silas were not crying.
[2:13:28] They have every reason to cry.
[2:13:31] 100% they should have cried. But when
[2:13:34] they look Paul remember he say ah
[2:13:37] Timothy hey don't cry it hurt silence
[2:13:41] don't cry men you can clap hand right
[2:13:46] uhhuh go over there to that corner let's
[2:13:49] go beat the wall let's go
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:55] I'm going to get the glory go
[2:14:01] when the jailer heard He said, "What
[2:14:04] kind of people are this?" Everybody that
[2:14:07] is here is sad, is desperate, but not
[2:14:11] Paul and Silas. Regardless of the
[2:14:14] circumstances, they show their color.
[2:14:20] I don't know if we together. I don't
[2:14:22] know if we together. Amen. Everybody's
[2:14:24] crying. It doesn't mean you need to cry.
[2:14:28] Amen. They have every right to be sad
[2:14:30] like any prisoner because they were
[2:14:32] innocent.
[2:14:34] Those that were there, some of them were
[2:14:36] guilty. Are we together? But they never
[2:14:39] look at the circumstances. They begin to
[2:14:41] glorify God in the midst of trouble. And
[2:14:45] when you are weak,
[2:14:48] then he is what? Strong. What did God
[2:14:50] do? He shook the prison. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:14:55] And he saved the jailer and his entire
[2:14:57] family.
[2:14:59] So, was going to jail a problem or bad?
[2:15:04] It was a good problem because God wanted
[2:15:06] to save that jailer. Amen.
[2:15:15] Let me continue. He says, "For knowing
[2:15:17] that tribulation produce what?
[2:15:20] Patience." So how do you get patience?
[2:15:23] Tribulation.
[2:15:25] No tribulation. No patience.
[2:15:29] Is there any problem? No. So and
[2:15:31] patience does what? Experience. And
[2:15:34] experience does what? Hope. And hope
[2:15:36] maketh what? Not a shame. So to bring
[2:15:39] forth all these things, you need
[2:15:41] tribulation. And Jesus say you will have
[2:15:44] tribulation.
[2:15:45] Because tribulation is a blessing.
[2:15:49] Yes sir. When tribulation comes, it
[2:15:51] comes with a package. If you handle
[2:15:54] tribulation right, tribulation will be
[2:15:57] changed into patience.
[2:16:00] So when tribulation comes, God is
[2:16:03] bringing you patience.
[2:16:05] Amen.
[2:16:09] Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't have any
[2:16:12] choice. I have to use this example.
[2:16:14] Amen. that I say I don't want to say but
[2:16:17] I don't have any choice because I need
[2:16:18] to move forward so you need to catch up

[2:16:38] and she's grown up
[2:16:40] read between the line
[2:16:43] when the time of love come and she's
[2:16:45] grown up. She begin to see her period.

[2:17:08] problem.
[2:17:10] It is a sign of life.
[2:17:13] [Applause]
[2:17:16] Are we together? And it comes every
[2:17:18] month.
[2:17:21] At the beginning, the young sister
[2:17:23] panic.
[2:17:25] She's uncomfortable. She doesn't like
[2:17:28] it. It's an infirmity.
[2:17:31] Connected to life. I hope you begin to
[2:17:34] understand now. After a while, she begin
[2:17:37] to get used to it.
[2:17:40] And she cope to live with it. until you
[2:17:43] will never know when she's going through
[2:17:45] that or not.
[2:17:49] I hope now I together. If you see her,
[2:17:52] she's always happy. You don't know when
[2:17:54] she got period or not. This is what God
[2:17:57] want you to understand.
[2:18:00] [Applause]
[2:18:02] Whether you going through problem or
[2:18:03] not, you don't see it on my face. Amen.
[2:18:12] I learned to live with it. It become
[2:18:15] part of womanhood.
[2:18:17] She take pride on that.
[2:18:21] Amen. Jesus.
[2:18:24] That's why Paul say, "I learn to leave
[2:18:26] when I'm at based." Amen. And when I am
[2:18:29] full. Amen. I'm fine. The devil, no
[2:18:31] matter what you're doing, I'm fine. Oh,
[2:18:33] it's a period. Yes. I'm a woman.
[2:18:36] I'm working. Amen. It's a blessing.
[2:18:40] After a while, it's finished. Next back
[2:18:42] again tomorrow.
[2:18:44] Amen. This is what Paul is saying.
[2:18:48] I hope you understand it now. If you
[2:18:51] stop, you go to the doctor.
[2:18:54] You go to the doctor, something is
[2:18:56] wrong. Something is wrong. You go to the
[2:18:58] doctor. Now it become a blessing.

[2:19:15] you removing life.
[2:19:20] Are we together now? But I'm going to
[2:19:23] show you a different way. But if it's an
[2:19:25] issue of blood,
[2:19:28] it is no longer periodic.
[2:19:31] Now we become a disease. That one must
[2:19:34] go.
[2:19:36] I'm going to get you to that. I'm going
[2:19:39] to get you to that. Yes, sir. If it
[2:19:41] become an issue of blood, don't accept
[2:19:43] it anymore. We're going to get to that.
[2:19:49] Lord, help me. Paul says, "For our what?
[2:19:53] Affliction. Light affliction which is
[2:19:55] but for a what? A moment." Periodic.
[2:19:59] Remember the word periodic which is but
[2:20:02] for a moment workketh for us a far what
[2:20:05] more exceeding exceeding an eternal
[2:20:08] weight of what? Glory. So affliction is
[2:20:12] putting what? Glory. Glory.
[2:20:15] Amen.
[2:20:18] What is uncomfortable is just cleansing
[2:20:21] the system for another blessing. Another
[2:20:25] blessing is coming next month. Another
[2:20:27] blessing is coming next month. Amen. Are
[2:20:29] we together? He says wherein ye greatly
[2:20:32] rejoice though now for a season. Do you
[2:20:35] see that? Now if it be ye are in what
[2:20:39] heaven a heaviness through manifold
[2:20:41] temptation that the trial of what your
[2:20:44] faith be much more precious than what
[2:20:46] gold that has what perish though it be
[2:20:49] try with what fire but might be found
[2:20:52] unto praise and honor and glory to the
[2:20:54] appearing of what? Jesus Christ. So
[2:20:56] everything that is coming up is always
[2:20:58] working for good. It is for glory. It is
[2:21:01] for glory. It is for glory. Yes sir.
[2:21:03] Hallelujah.
[2:21:05] William Marion Brham he said then I will
[2:21:09] glory in my infirmity. I will glory in
[2:21:12] it. I know you are the healer. I have
[2:21:14] seen you heal the sick, raise the dead
[2:21:17] and cast out devil. Open the eyes of the
[2:21:19] blind. But I have consulted you and you
[2:21:22] tell me it is your grace. It's your
[2:21:24] grace is sufficient. Then this devil
[2:21:28] that bothers me.
[2:21:30] This is brother brand I'm explaining
[2:21:32] Paul. So this devil that bothers me is a
[2:21:35] water growing pain of water your grace
[2:21:38] then I will glory on water in my
[2:21:40] infirmity. Why if lest I get exalted
[2:21:43] above the abundance of water the
[2:21:45] revelation? See he had something the
[2:21:48] other disciple didn't have. Yes. He saw
[2:21:51] him after his death, burial,
[2:21:54] resurrection, and what? He saw him. Some
[2:21:58] of them say, "Well, I walk with him." So
[2:22:00] did everybody on the street. But after
[2:22:02] he was dead, buried, rose, and ascended
[2:22:05] up and returned back in the form of the
[2:22:09] pillar of fire, he talked to Paul. That
[2:22:13] was more than any of the rest of them.
[2:22:17] Amen.
[2:22:18] [Applause]
[2:22:19] He had a superior revelation.
[2:22:24] Do you follow me? Amen. Brother Brandham
[2:22:26] say except I get exalted and want to
[2:22:30] build a great big seminary and
[2:22:32] everything else and great big something
[2:22:34] another. Let's get exalted above the
[2:22:37] abundance of this revelation. God let
[2:22:39] the messenger of the devil to kept me to
[2:22:43] keep me beat down. Yes. Then when I am
[2:22:46] weak, I am what? Strong. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:50] Amen. What is it? Growing pains of
[2:22:53] grace. Amen. We could stay on that a
[2:22:56] long time and we are suffering his grace
[2:23:00] pen. Oh, he may permit crossroad. Amen.
[2:23:05] He may permit crossroad to trials to do
[2:23:09] what? Perfect us for his service. He may
[2:23:13] permit that now church both here and on
[2:23:16] tape. He may permit the gross word for
[2:23:19] our what? Service.
[2:23:22] Paul had a problem with his eyes.
[2:23:25] William Brham had also a problem with
[2:23:28] his eyes.
[2:23:34] Amen. Brother says this. Oh my. What is
[2:23:39] tension?
[2:23:42] If I could have been born without
[2:23:44] distension,
[2:23:46] Lord, I wish I was done without
[2:23:47] distension. Well, if I would not have
[2:23:50] distension, I would not have been what I
[2:23:53] am.
[2:23:55] Amen. I would not have been a Christian
[2:23:57] perhaps. It was distension that drove me
[2:24:02] to Jesus Christ. See, it's been a
[2:24:05] blessing thing to me.
[2:24:07] I hope you are following me. Amen.
[2:24:10] Please buckle up my friend.
[2:24:12] So then as Paul say as though when he
[2:24:16] had a tension or something or another he
[2:24:19] had consulted the Lord to take it away
[2:24:21] from him how many times? Three times.
[2:24:23] And the Lord say Paul my grace is what?
[2:24:27] Sufficient. Listen to brother Brham
[2:24:29] about his life. Brother Brham say then I
[2:24:33] glory in my infirmities. Then when I am
[2:24:36] weak I'm what? strong as long as it is
[2:24:40] to the will of God. All right. Now, I
[2:24:43] consulted him one time when he used to
[2:24:46] bother me so bad. He scared me. He told
[2:24:51] me about 8 or 10 years ago. He said, "He
[2:24:55] shall never scare you again." And he
[2:24:58] never has did. No, sir. Don't worry
[2:25:01] about it. I just feel it, but I know
[2:25:03] it's there. But I just go on
[2:25:07] because it don't scare me no more. So
[2:25:11] thankful for that. So brother Brandham
[2:25:14] had a problem himself. Amen. That used
[2:25:17] to bother him all the time. And brother
[2:25:20] Brandham pray God and God did not remove
[2:25:23] it. No. God said no. Brother Brandham
[2:25:27] that thing is going to be there but
[2:25:30] don't be scared of it. Amen. In other
[2:25:32] words, continue living your life.
[2:25:36] Amen. Don't worry about it. It is
[2:25:38] necessary.
[2:25:40] Are you there? Amen. Brother say he
[2:25:44] could have say he won't be no more.
[2:25:48] Just all is well. You won't be scared no
[2:25:50] more. In other words, God could have
[2:25:52] taken away from brother Brandham. But
[2:25:54] God say William Brana don't take that
[2:25:56] one away. That one just know it won't
[2:25:59] scare you. You continue your life,
[2:26:01] brother. Continue your life with a
[2:26:03] demon. So it is his will that it happen.
[2:26:07] So adjust do what? Embrace it and say,
[2:26:11] "Thank you, Lord. I walk walk that way."
[2:26:15] Amen. Just like a woman is walking that
[2:26:19] way. Without being bothered by her
[2:26:22] circle, that's the same way you need to
[2:26:24] walk. And brother Bradam says this. He
[2:26:28] says everywhere through every n through
[2:26:31] nation every time I have a turn in the
[2:26:35] flesh
[2:26:37] everywhere brotherham going he had a
[2:26:40] problem brother say an angel of Satan
[2:26:44] who follows and tried to buffet or to be
[2:26:47] set but he has been defeated how many
[2:26:50] cases in every case by what? The Holy
[2:26:53] Spirit and God come out and do what?
[2:26:56] triumphant winning 100,000 of Christ
[2:27:00] 100,000 to Christ in the time brother
[2:27:03] say everywhere he was going to preach
[2:27:05] the gospel he had the throne in the
[2:27:07] flesh but if you notice every time the
[2:27:10] throne come God will come and heal him
[2:27:14] because it is there to buff it
[2:27:18] blow after blow you get healed it come
[2:27:22] back again you get healed it come back
[2:27:25] again. Now we have a problem with this
[2:27:28] brother of Stephven.
[2:27:29] We pray for people to get sick. I mean
[2:27:32] to get healed. We pray we casting out
[2:27:35] devil from people. Now you brought us
[2:27:38] something that is very
[2:27:40] uh unique. Not to mention strange
[2:27:47] that there are problem in our life that
[2:27:50] we need to just accept
[2:27:53] and walk with it.
[2:27:55] So now, how am I going to know
[2:28:00] that this is a turn or this is not a
[2:28:03] tone? Amen.
[2:28:07] Are we together? Amen. How am I going to
[2:28:10] know that this sickness here, it is God
[2:28:13] giving me sickness? Oh, this is not from
[2:28:16] the Lord. Because now I'm confused.
[2:28:21] I'm going through a trial right now.
[2:28:22] Yes, sir. But you're saying certain
[2:28:25] things you just need to swallow it up
[2:28:27] and just leave them alone and keep
[2:28:29] walking. But by the same token, we need
[2:28:32] to pray for the sick. We need to cast
[2:28:34] our devil. So the problem is who can
[2:28:37] tell me what is a tone or what is not a
[2:28:40] tone. Buckle up and I'll go to the
[2:28:42] airport.
[2:28:44] If you ready, you holler. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:47] Few people, my friend. Amen. A few
[2:28:50] people again. Amen. Ah, now you ready?
[2:28:55] Number one, a thorn is periodic.
[2:29:03] Are we together? Amen. A thorn is
[2:29:06] periodic.
[2:29:10] It is seasonal. It is never permanent.
[2:29:18] Are we together? Amen. And every time a
[2:29:21] turn come, are we together? Amen. God
[2:29:25] will heal you. Amen. Amen. When you pray
[2:29:29] for it and it will go away. Are we
[2:29:32] together? Amen. Then it will come back
[2:29:34] again.
[2:29:40] This month you might have cramping.
[2:29:45] You might go through pain.
[2:29:47] You might need some Tylenol.
[2:29:50] God can take that pain away, but next
[2:29:53] month the circle will come again.
[2:29:58] I hope we together. Amen.
[2:30:02] Amen. Amen. Time are periodic,
[2:30:06] seasonal, not permanent because God will
[2:30:10] heal you. Amen.
[2:30:13] Amen.
[2:30:14] Number two,
[2:30:17] it is God who determine what is atone.
[2:30:22] Amen. Not you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:30:27] Yes, sir. Amen. Let me go back again.
[2:30:30] Paul didn't determine his turn. Yes,
[2:30:34] sir. It is God who gave Paul that say
[2:30:37] the Lord. Amen. And say this is me.
[2:30:41] If God didn't tell you, don't take it.
[2:30:45] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:30:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:30:52] It must be
[2:30:54] It must be that saith the Lord.
[2:30:59] Amen. Amen. If not, the devil will play
[2:31:02] with your mind. Why are you saying that,
[2:31:05] brother Steven? Brother Brandham says
[2:31:08] this. Now I'm heading to the airport. I
[2:31:11] will admit there is sickness unto death.
[2:31:14] Uhhuh. And that is why prophetic gift
[2:31:17] are in the church to know these things.
[2:31:20] But to say that our father that a man
[2:31:25] had rumatism
[2:31:28] arthritis
[2:31:29] say yes lord I'm just glad to have it.
[2:31:34] Glad you give it to me. I embrace it. I
[2:31:38] love it. I glory in tribulation.
[2:31:45] I'm now trying to help you, my friend.
[2:31:47] Break it down. Are we together? If I
[2:31:49] leave you going up, you will say, "I
[2:31:52] take this thing. I embrace it." Brother
[2:31:54] Steven said they are certain.
[2:31:57] Number one, it must be periodic. Number
[2:32:00] two, it must be that safe the Lord. If
[2:32:03] God didn't say anything, Amen. Don't
[2:32:06] start confessing. Amen. Amen. Can I
[2:32:09] continue? Amen. Can I continue? Amen.
[2:32:12] Brother Bradam say Paul stone in the
[2:32:15] flesh was no more diseased than nothing
[2:32:18] else.
[2:32:21] If he was not healing, he got well. And
[2:32:24] he said the messenger of the devil that
[2:32:27] buffet me. What does the word buffet
[2:32:30] means? Blow after what? Blow. See, then
[2:32:34] he heal him. He got well. He healed him
[2:32:37] again. He got sick. And he healed him.
[2:32:39] He got sick. Blow after blow. He said a
[2:32:43] messenger of Satan. Not an infirmity
[2:32:48] as he meant
[2:32:50] as he said there, but as people tried to
[2:32:53] interpret it.
[2:32:56] Brother said, don't take that as the
[2:32:58] word infirmity because the atonement
[2:33:02] remove infirmity. I I hope you are now
[2:33:05] understanding. Amen. It is a thorn,
[2:33:08] something periodic, but God will heal
[2:33:10] you anytime it happen. Amen. Are we
[2:33:13] together? Amen. Brother Brandham says,
[2:33:16] "I will let brother Bster take that
[2:33:19] thorn in the flesh for you some
[2:33:21] afternoon." And some of these what
[2:33:23] teachers? Brother Brandham say that
[2:33:26] people are using this scripture, Paul,
[2:33:29] to begin to say, "Oh, I'm I'm having
[2:33:32] diabetes. Oh, praise the Lord. That is
[2:33:35] my turn in the flesh. I'm having
[2:33:37] arthritis. Oh, praise the Lord. That is
[2:33:40] my turn in the flesh. But said, "No, no,
[2:33:42] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:33:43] no, no." He said, "That's not the way
[2:33:45] it's taken." He said it was not an
[2:33:47] infirmity.
[2:33:49] Amen. It was not something permanent.
[2:33:52] It was something that comes and God heal
[2:33:55] you and it goes away. Amen. It was an
[2:33:58] allergy that come and hit you and the
[2:34:00] allergy goes. But if that allergy
[2:34:03] continues on
[2:34:05] and it doesn't go away, you need to wake
[2:34:08] up. Amen. I hope we are together. Amen.
[2:34:11] What brother say? What is disease? He
[2:34:15] say what this dreadful thing that come
[2:34:18] upon people. Let's diagnose it just a
[2:34:21] moment. Some people has went has went so
[2:34:26] much to say that sickness was a
[2:34:29] blessing.
[2:34:31] because of this scripture.
[2:34:34] Amen.
[2:34:35] Amen. I'm I'm I'm balancing now
[2:34:38] everything back. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are
[2:34:41] we together? Amen. Oh, brother Stephen.
[2:34:43] So, it's a turn in my flesh. So, it's a
[2:34:45] blessing. Brother Brandham say
[2:34:50] are we together? Amen. Oh my god.
[2:34:52] Everybody's now calm. We heading to the
[2:34:54] airport. Brother Brandham say some
[2:34:57] people has went so much to say that what
[2:34:59] sickness was a blessing. I heard a
[2:35:02] minister on the radio here not long ago
[2:35:05] say that God put sickness on people to
[2:35:08] show their humility.
[2:35:13] Now you're not saying amen.
[2:35:18] Are we together? Amen. Why? Because Paul
[2:35:21] say I glory in the infirmity. Paul is a
[2:35:24] different thing. It's a periodic thing.
[2:35:27] It is not a permanent sickness. Amen. I
[2:35:30] hope we are together. Amen. He says he
[2:35:33] said that God put sickness onto people
[2:35:36] to show their humility and to suffer for
[2:35:39] him to show patience.
[2:35:42] If that will be the truth, then Jesus
[2:35:44] defeated his own cause.
[2:35:48] Amen.
[2:35:49] He defeated what? His own purpose. Never
[2:35:52] one place
[2:35:54] in the Bible is that scriptural. Amen.
[2:35:57] Amen. Any apostle or any prophet or even
[2:36:02] Jesus himself ever declared that to be
[2:36:05] the truth. That is negative thinking.
[2:36:08] Amen.
[2:36:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:36:14] Brother Steven, slow down.
[2:36:19] You say God put a devil Yeah. To buffet
[2:36:23] people, to keep them humble like he did
[2:36:26] Paul. Paul pray, he goes. He comes back
[2:36:30] again. He goes, he come back again. The
[2:36:32] point is it's going. It's going. He have
[2:36:35] to go. Then when he come back again, you
[2:36:38] go back again. You cast it away. He
[2:36:41] comes back again. But nothing to stay.
[2:36:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:36:46] Are we together? Nothing to stay. In
[2:36:49] other words, your body cannot receive
[2:36:51] any permanent sickness. Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:36:54] I don't know if you getting me. If
[2:36:57] somebody begin to draw you that way,
[2:36:59] that's a problem. Amen. Because the
[2:37:02] atonement is there. I am the Lord your
[2:37:05] healer.
[2:37:06] [Applause]
[2:37:07] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Uh-huh.
[2:37:10] Brother Brandham say that is negative
[2:37:13] thinking and you are only trying to
[2:37:16] excuse your unbelief.
[2:37:22] A preacher who doesn't have faith to
[2:37:25] cast out devil now he begin to say you
[2:37:27] know there is a turn in the flesh
[2:37:31] you need to take the tone in the flesh
[2:37:33] brother you need the Holy Ghost to cast
[2:37:35] devil
[2:37:37] amen the tone in the flesh the one who
[2:37:40] have the tone will cast that tone away
[2:37:44] amen are we together amen he says that
[2:37:48] is an excuse for your unbelief,
[2:37:51] preacher, by hiding behind such a what
[2:37:54] theory as that. That is not God's word.
[2:37:58] What we need today is what old fashioned
[2:38:02] God send what back to the water Bible
[2:38:06] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:38:07] preaching the water
[2:38:10] of Jesus Christ to bring the people back
[2:38:13] to a water living faith and a
[2:38:15] resurrected God. Not some dead theology
[2:38:19] that has been gone what years ago and
[2:38:22] hatch off of different denomination. We
[2:38:25] need a Bible living faith.
[2:38:28] [Applause]
[2:38:30] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:38:34] And if sickness is a blessing and Jesus
[2:38:37] come and heal the sick everywhere that
[2:38:39] he defeated his purpose
[2:38:42] in coming. Which would you which would
[2:38:44] you say would be a blessing? If a loving
[2:38:47] God, a father who gave you life and
[2:38:49] promise you a long life on earth if you
[2:38:52] obey him, then he would come and strike
[2:38:54] you down with a devil and let's lay
[2:38:57] there and eat you up on the bed with
[2:38:59] cancer.
[2:39:01] No way. That's not a turn.
[2:39:04] Are we together? Amen. TB, that's not a
[2:39:08] turn or something. Say now, oh God, this
[2:39:11] is your love to me.
[2:39:14] Or would you rather say the devil struck
[2:39:17] me down and a loving God came and did
[2:39:20] what? Healed me. And give me what? Life
[2:39:23] again. Why a child will know better than
[2:39:26] to say that God put sickness on people?
[2:39:29] Don't never pin that on God. Amen. Amen.
[2:39:34] Amen.
[2:39:38] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:39:40] Amen. How do I know it's a turn? Yes,
[2:39:42] Lord. Periodic.
[2:39:44] But I must be healed. And God must tell
[2:39:47] me Yes, sir. That is my turn. If God
[2:39:51] didn't tell you, it's your turn.
[2:39:52] Hallelujah. Pull the sword. Amen.
[2:39:58] I don't know if you're understanding me.
[2:40:00] If God didn't tell you put your it's
[2:40:02] it's a tone. If I'm having something and
[2:40:05] you come, you say, "Okay, brother
[2:40:06] Stephen, you got this because God want
[2:40:08] to humble you. That's your problem. Me,
[2:40:10] I'm going to pull this.
[2:40:12] until God tell to me if not that thing
[2:40:14] must go. Yes sir.
[2:40:20] Brother say Jesus never did tell his
[2:40:24] disciple never preach at anywhere or ask
[2:40:27] the disciple to tell people they must
[2:40:29] stay pinned down with sickness to obey
[2:40:31] him.
[2:40:33] No sir never
[2:40:36] today this thing is clear. Amen. He sent
[2:40:38] them to liberate the sickness and to
[2:40:41] preach to those where captivity. In
[2:40:43] captivity and to those in what? Bondage.
[2:40:46] He come to bring what? Deliverance. And
[2:40:48] he can bring deliverance. He can do the
[2:40:51] two things opposite one from another.
[2:40:53] He's either got to be the author of life
[2:40:55] or the author of water. Yes. And if he
[2:40:58] and if you put and if and if you put
[2:41:01] sickness onto God and say if if that is
[2:41:05] God making you sick to die then you got
[2:41:07] to make him the author of death when
[2:41:10] death and life cannot associate how?
[2:41:12] Even together. Are we together? Amen. We
[2:41:15] getting somewhere my friend. Disease and
[2:41:18] affliction are all the result of what?
[2:41:21] Sin. Maybe not in your life but in
[2:41:24] somebody else life before you. The devil
[2:41:27] is the altar of what? Sickness and
[2:41:30] water. Affliction. Before we had any
[2:41:32] devil, we had no sickness or affliction.
[2:41:35] But when Satan came, he brought with him
[2:41:38] water. Sickness and water. Affliction.
[2:41:40] There is so many times that we refer to
[2:41:43] them as blessing. I never could think
[2:41:46] that God could get a blessing out of a
[2:41:48] sick person. Amen. Unless he was what? A
[2:41:52] sinner. Driving him what? To God. or a
[2:41:55] disobedient child bringing him back to
[2:41:57] be reconciled to what? His father. But
[2:41:59] sicknesses are the result of the devil
[2:42:02] and of the fall. Amen. Amen. Amen. Are
[2:42:06] we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:42:08] Amen. We getting my friend. I found a
[2:42:11] lot of people that say that sickness is
[2:42:13] a blessing.
[2:42:15] Ask some doctor if it is. Why is it then
[2:42:18] you go if you got your appendicitis and
[2:42:21] have the blessing cut out?
[2:42:27] It's a tone in my flesh. It's a tone in
[2:42:29] my flesh. So you the one diagnosing the
[2:42:31] tone. So why do you go to the doctor to
[2:42:34] remove the tone? Your best.
[2:42:39] Are we together? Amen. As sure would not
[2:42:42] want to do that. That is against your
[2:42:45] own theory. Have the blessing cut out. I
[2:42:48] would not want to do that. I just kept
[2:42:50] it. And what? God. See, but sickness is
[2:42:54] no blessing.
[2:42:56] Sickness is what? A curse of the devil.
[2:42:59] And Jesus say it was what? All right.
[2:43:02] Now, here it is. A man one time in South
[2:43:05] Africa. All right. Where we was having a
[2:43:09] meeting at the Dutch Reform Church. He
[2:43:12] stood up.
[2:43:14] First the pepper blasted everywhere. But
[2:43:17] when they found out that the member
[2:43:19] become so spiritual
[2:43:22] when they went back they haul a water.
[2:43:24] Amen. So member that are spiritual
[2:43:27] hauler what? Amen.
[2:43:32] Some are not non-spiritual.
[2:43:34] Those that are spiritual haul what?
[2:43:36] Amen. They holler. Amen. In church and
[2:43:40] everything they thought that then he got
[2:43:43] fanatical.
[2:43:45] Amen. So he went to church and say,
[2:43:47] "Talk about such a blessing. How the
[2:43:49] Lord blessed the people with sickness."
[2:43:53] And the man's wife a couple days later
[2:43:55] they had a pandicadness,
[2:43:58] rush her to the hospital and cut the
[2:44:01] blessing out.
[2:44:05] Why? Yes. If such a blessing to be sick,
[2:44:10] if it's such a blessing to be sick, let
[2:44:13] her go and be sick.
[2:44:15] Don't do nothing about it. You be doing
[2:44:18] something God would not want you to do.
[2:44:20] If it's such a blessing to have a
[2:44:22] cancer,
[2:44:24] why take radium, chemo or anything? Just
[2:44:29] let it go and be a blessing. If you are
[2:44:31] more blessed when you are dead and you
[2:44:34] can do more for the Lord when you are
[2:44:36] dead than when you are alive, well, go
[2:44:39] ahead and die. But God want you here to
[2:44:43] fulfill his program. Amen.
[2:44:46] [Applause]
[2:44:49] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:44:51] Amen. The Bible say above what? All
[2:44:54] things. I will that you do what? Prosper
[2:44:56] in hell. And be in what? In health.
[2:44:59] Above all things that you prosper in
[2:45:01] what? Health. the rathers of the
[2:45:03] scripture inspired by the Holy Spirit
[2:45:06] which the scriptures say all scripture
[2:45:08] is given by inspiration of God. Amen. So
[2:45:12] what do we do now my friend as a
[2:45:15] conclusion it is to him that believe and
[2:45:19] if he can find somebody who will uh who
[2:45:22] will believe his word he will prove his
[2:45:24] word by you
[2:45:27] this is after the seal and sometime
[2:45:30] sickness and thing happen to us that way
[2:45:33] that God can prove himself
[2:45:37] that's good amen John nine my friend do
[2:45:40] you remember the blind Amen.
[2:45:43] That Jesus found they say who sin he or
[2:45:48] his father his mother he said in this
[2:45:51] case neither but that the what works of
[2:45:55] God may be made known. See it happened
[2:45:59] to the boy so that Jesus could be
[2:46:02] glorified. Sometime
[2:46:06] sickness is not a curse.
[2:46:11] It is what a blessing.
[2:46:18] That we must.
[2:46:21] It is not a blessing for you to accept
[2:46:25] and begin to tell the people I'm blessed
[2:46:27] with cancer. No, no, no, no. It's a
[2:46:30] blessing for a reason. Yes, sir. And
[2:46:33] what is that reason?
[2:46:35] Amen. Brother Brandham say it's a
[2:46:37] blessing that we can do what? Stick our
[2:46:40] faith out there and call those things
[2:46:44] which are not as though what they were.
[2:46:46] So when sickness come to your life, God
[2:46:49] is trusting in your faith. Amen.
[2:46:57] I don't know if you understanding me
[2:47:00] whether it's a tone
[2:47:02] or it's not a tone. Every time sickness
[2:47:06] happen to your life, it is an
[2:47:08] opportunity
[2:47:10] that God is giving to your faith. It is
[2:47:13] the trial of your faith.
[2:47:16] God is trying your faith. Amen. God want
[2:47:20] you to exercise your faith. Whether it
[2:47:23] be a turn or not turn, he must go. Amen.
[2:47:29] That's right.

[2:47:34] It is a blessing that we can do what?
[2:47:36] Stick our faith out there. Out there and
[2:47:39] call those things which are not as
[2:47:40] though what they were. God said so and
[2:47:44] he shall prove it so if you suggest not
[2:47:47] weaken under the water. First, let's go
[2:47:49] to 2 Corinthian and let's finish.

[2:48:23] know it's a turn, it will come back. But
[2:48:25] it doesn't just come back. He come back
[2:48:27] and go. It's a ping pong between me and
[2:48:29] the devil.

[2:48:50] my home, not in my business, because
[2:48:53] it's an opportunity. It is the exercise
[2:48:57] of your faith. Amen. The more you
[2:48:59] exercise, the more muscle. So you bring

[2:55:57] mountain." He said, "You, yes, you are
[2:56:00] 80 years old. What are you going to do
[2:56:02] with a property? It is for me and my
[2:56:04] children. Give me my mountain. For me
[2:56:08] and my grandchildren. Give me my
[2:56:10] mountain."

[2:56:17] accept kidney problem. I need to accept
[2:56:20] the liver problem. I need to accept the
[2:56:22] backachche. No sir, you must be strong
[2:56:26] going to heaven.
[2:56:28] Why does God have to give you a body
[2:56:30] change?
[2:56:32] Why is God going to give you a body
[2:56:34] change? Because no sickness will enter
[2:56:36] heaven before we go to heaven.
[2:56:39] Everything clean up.
[2:56:42] Amen. But the Holy Spirit is giving you
[2:56:45] as a down payment to take care of your
[2:56:48] house and bring your house captive under
[2:56:52] the obedience of Christ.
[2:56:57] Many of us here, we have not pay our
[2:57:00] house off.
[2:57:02] Even though you didn't pay your house
[2:57:03] off, do you let somebody get in? No. You
[2:57:06] still call that my house. You still
[2:57:08] claim it. You can tell somebody get out.
