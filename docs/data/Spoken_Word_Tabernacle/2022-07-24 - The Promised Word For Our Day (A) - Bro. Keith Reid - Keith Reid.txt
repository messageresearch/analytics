he's got the clothing on today amen everybody happy this morning are you really happy this morning amen amen glory to god and i'm not preaching this morning [Laughter] amen everybody's still meditating on the second oil you got it very well one title d two evidences the evidences that are open one open and one close you got that pretty good it's one sword but it appears to be too sword anybody okay oh my god you better make sure you get everything pretty good because your boss opened up the trail of the serpent again you see now it is not me i was just starting something else and then then he opened up amen if i get brother brother i'm saying you would take him four hours for him to preach that so i'm trying to touch just the surface and stay on where we are amen if i dig into it then it's going to be a lot of convention amen it took me to revelation 13 and revelation 17 and revelation and then i say my god now i see why brother branham said he was a beast and you can chase it from genesis all the way down amen blessed be the name of the lord it's amazing how the holy spirit is moving there are things that are opening up and you wonder i was talking to brother chad i said but there are things in this message that if you tell folks they will spin their head like where are you getting them from yet it's in the scripture and it's in the message he said but stephen i seen that i was worrying i thought i was the i hope i'm not the only one saying these things amen oh my god blessed be the name of the lord i was talking to my wife yesterday you remember on sunday the scripture says that the priests have to sprinkle the mercy seat eastward but the ark of the covenant was on the west right how can you be on the west sprinkling the mercy seat on the east everybody okay everybody okay no you're not okay i know my church everybody okay it's sunday you the one that usually starts stuff not me amen this is the tabernacle right you enter the tabernacle from there which was the gate of judah right when you enter you have the brazen altar everybody okay then you got the lever right then we go to the holy place right then in the holy place you got the candlestick here everybody okay then over there the table of the showbread right then over here the altar of the essence right then the ark of the covenant was right here so the ark was on the west side everybody okay on the north was here there were different gates but the tabernacle you get there here and then the sapphires right here and the bible says in leviticus 16 last sunday that when the priest uses his finger which we know the finger means the spirit of god he needs to sprinkle the mercy seat seven times that you sprinkle the mercy seat toward the east and brother branham says that the brazen altar was on the east and brother branham said that the mercy seat which was here on the ark was on the east if you want to start trouble with brother branham you can start right there you say no the scriptures say it's on the west brother branham say it's on the east you need to listen to the prophet very carefully amen everybody okay everybody good now how can you sprinkle the mercy seat toward the east because the mercy city is toward the west you need to be looking at the mercy seat to sprinkle it but if you sprinkle that way you are sprinkling toward the west let's make it easy on you this is the west okay this is the mercy seat everybody good and the door over there is the east everybody okay so if the priest come and he need to sprinkle the mercy seat toward the east if he does this the mercy seat is behind him so he's not really sprinkling the mercy seat everybody okay so the priests have to go behind everybody okay everybody okay then the priest is watching east now the mercy seat is on the east and the high priest is on the west that's the only time the mercy city is on the east anybody here so now when the high priest stands here he begins to sprinkle the mercy seed he's sprinkling the mercy seat eastward because he's behind the mercy seat everybody okay you good or you want me to dig a little b you're going to give this the preacher time right everybody okay now this mercy seat brother branham say he was the throne of god why was he the throne because there was a caribbean on one side a caribbean on the other side and the pillar of fire was standing right in the midst of it which was a reflection of heaven because in heaven you have a throne and the four beasts was around it everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so if the high priest is behind the mercy seat and the mercy seat is here and the mercy seat is the throne of god and the pillar of fire is stealing on the mercy seat so when you come in the tabernacle when you enter the holiest who do you see first can you speak a lot who do you see first you see the mercy seat and the pillar of fire do you see the high priest he's where stop john was in heaven and he saw somebody sitting under you now alive i know what is causing that i was communicating to her sister she asked me a question i say look at the scripture and tell me what you see she said brother stephen i see it's a she but i'm overthinking i say you're not overthinking you're just afraid to accept what your eyes are telling you because you were taught differently the problem you are afraid where am i going anybody okay all right when you get to heaven there was somebody sitting on the throne holding a book in his writing they called for the kingsman redeemer they say who is worthy to come take the book and do what break the seals john look in heaven did he see somebody john look a on the earth did he see somebody he looked underneath the earth did he see somebody but they told him they said the lion of the tribe of judah have prevailed to take the book and to do what so when john turned around because he was crying he saw what where was the lamb [Applause] where was the lamb where was the lamb that's why you heard under the seals brother branham saying that he was in the intercessory box he was working the work of redemption so he has to come out from there the lamb was on the melchizedek priesthood on the backside sprinkling the mercy seat by the seven messenger everybody here and when it's time to break the seal then the lamb himself come out [Applause] the old testament is not difficult with a prophet did you get that that's why john was looking he can't see him because the high priest is hidden behind and brother branham would never tell you that he just said he was in the intercessory box and he left you figure that out it takes the holy spirit the second awhile not the first it takes the second oil to go down and to pull that stuff up and to show you saying this is what was hidden there now you understand why john could not see him because he came out of heaven so he was somewhere in heaven where was it john never said he came out but branham said he came out from the throne but where was he at he was behind somewhere and when you look you see the pillar of fire but i and my father we are everybody okay did i lose somebody amen i kept it to preach on that now you got it before even the sermon i was thinking at home i say i have a hard time is to keep secret from you i don't know what you did i would say i'm going to keep it i'm going to keep it before you know it it's already out amen there is so much in this message the opening of the seals have opened the scripture in the way that you never seen before that's why when you heard brother branham say the bible became a new book brother branham knew what he was talking about everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord so you keep praying because we're gonna dig more amen that sister asked me a question she didn't know it was the holy spirit using her to show me something differently and when i saw it i said my god now i see what it was amen it is very difficult but it is in the scripture and it's in the message if i give you the court you will begin to question brother branham until i give you the scripture and you will see that brother brother most perfectly in line but he never gave you the scripture i keep it you will understand that better by and by amen we appreciate all the family members that are here this morning we do not have visitors we got family member so all our family members god richly bless you we got brother teddy here this morning for montreal he's here this morning he's a deacon in brother marcon church in montreal he's here you're not a visitor

jamaica amen he's coming for the meeting but he purposed to stop by and to encourage the church and to be with us this is a big pastor in jamaica and him taking his time coming like this to just be a

hallelujah shake somebody in beside you and said god bless you i'm glad to be in the house of the lord what a privilege it is for believers to be in the house of god amen people of like precious faith come together because god has sent a messenger in this time to turn our hearts back to the word of god hallelujah and that word has become our absolute in this hour amen no man no person no church no denomination but the word hallelujah absolute jesus christ being restored to us in this hour i'm certainly glad to see you this morning you maybe see just for a while amen just certainly i think the last time i came to north carolina was 19 2019 and i certainly didn't know when i would be back the pandemic has changed so many lives and uh so many of our ministers and our brethren are no longer with us who have passed and gone but we are still here amen to wave the banner high for the lord jesus christ amen praise god back home our lives are certainly changed it's unusual that i travel without my wife you know and so but now we because of the pandemic we had to start a business and now somebody's got to stay back to take care of things while the other is gone so i mean i'm here she's back there and so but she did give me a list though and says she wrote she said my husband please when you wrote this shirt you ought to wear this suit so i i i'm kind of on that kind of management you know amen you know i tell her really i said sometimes you know it's all right when i just arrived somewhere and um you know i can put them together but you know then their wash and the tie move from the shirt and so and so i'm going to get them together again and sometimes we may we don't have the patience to look and to go back and read what was said [Music] because so somebody sent a list and a sister sent a list of them she said the name of the men that don't listen and i'll tell you what my name was in it so god bless all my friends this morning am i just glad to be in the house of the lord amen praise god and um you know our house is empty today and so the girls are gone you know so we're empty nesters really and so so you're all welcome to come to jamaica you've got a place to stay i i've got so many rooms that you've got to find something to do with it so you might as well pass by sometimes amen praise god so i'm glad to see my friends from way back you know and and glad to see you all together and um i miss so many people but i try while i'm here to visit everybody and to see all they're doing and and so the greatest thing is to see the believers in the word of god i believe you have a wonderful pastor amen brother stephen and um i've never heard you preach until you were at uh that special meeting uh in ohio uh that's the first time i've heard you preach because you know i've traveled and i come and i'm preaching and you're there interpreting so and i said my god god knows what he's doing amen and if god has given you a solid pastor pray for him lift him up i know sometimes you you all break down your pastor really you know he's encumbered with all kind of stuff but i said in all that pray for him amen that god would feed him the word to feed you amen because one desire that we have is to see the bride of jesus christ in the rapture amen god bless you my brother amen praise god hallelujah so we we thank god for everything and so we just want to go to the word this morning amen there's nothing strange nothing new i couldn't bring anything the way brother stephen bring it or better than the way he brings it really amen i just say thank god for the men of god amen and each of us do a little portion for the bride of christ amen to to see to it hallelujah that god this bride that god has called we didn't call the bride he called the bride and she's elected to stand and she will stand i don't care what man does it it can't stop the bride amen for the bride is already elected to stand she's predestined for her position in jesus christ really and so i don't care what complex you have in your life god before the foundation of the world he has set you there and for this purpose you were born nobody can stop you nobody can take your place and you can't take nobody's place really amen so why worry amen we might as well just have a good time amen hallelujah your names were written under those seals and the opening of the world is releasing your name putting you in position hallelujah i thank god for my position i don't want to be in your position i thank god for my position amen praise god and thank god for my little portion for that reason he called me amen and i'm conscious of that amen so we want to turn the bibles this morning first scripture will be used in the book of exodus chapter nine then we'll go to uh ii peter chapter 4 amen and just see what god would say to us this morning as we find the scripture maybe just by our heads everywhere our great god and father lord we thank you god for this day that you have given to us we thank you lord god not for the 24 hours but lord god for the age in which your god your cause us to be here and lord god we thank you for the leadership of eternal life we thank you lord god that in this day you have sinned a voice and lord god you had foreordained before the foundation of the world that we should catch the vision and hear that voice and our soul responding to that voice for that hour the lord god there's even others who are better than we are but lord god you chose us by your sovereign grace it's no good that our father or mother has done or we've done but lord god it's all that you have done for us god and for that we thank you this morning lord god to consider us lord god you have been a great savior a great healer lord god you have been a great provider oh god lord we even move to the realms of disappointments but lord god you know when to rise us of god and for that lord god we thank you lord god we pray this morning that you'd heal the sick among us that oh god you rise up the oppressed the lord god may the weak say that i am strong lord god may we find our place or position in the kingdom of almighty god the lord god may we stand up for god as a pillow in the temple of our god anoint your word this morning and lord god ever hears that hear your word lord god and we forever thank you for that which you've done in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen praise god you're glad to be here amen in exodus chapter 9 just want to read a small portion then the lord said unto moses going on to pharaoh and tell him thus say the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they might serve me hallelujah then we turn over to ii timothy chapter 4. let my people go that my people might serve me and in second timothy chapter 4 i read from verse 1. i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom he said preach the word the instance in season and out of season reprove rebrook rebuke exalt with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn onto fables but watch thou in all things endure affliction he's now talking to the church as the messenger to the first church age he said watch though in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry then paul said for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand but he said i've fought a good fat i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only i like that part amen but unto all them that love is appearing by the law that is blessing to the reading of the word to all them that love is appearing you may be seated this morning you don't want to thank god for the legacy of the world that we have received we we thank god we're not just here teaching social psychology or psychology no but we thank god that there was a message for the bride we thank god that we have been called out and so this morning i'm going to speak on the promised word for today hallelujah they're asking a word for every age every age has got a ministry every age has got a song that reflects the anointing for that time and we've got songs for our day we've got words for our day there's a message for today there's a ministry which carries an anointing for today which is leading the bride hallelujah into a rapture is it right brother branham said redemption has two part there's a coming
