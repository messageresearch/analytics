[10:05] say happy Mother's Day this morning amen
[10:07] praise the Lord
[10:10] Hallelujah
[10:14] Hallelujah
[10:20] I thought about reading a a secular poem
[10:23] like we usually do this morning
[10:26] but I decided we're just going to read
[10:28] proverbs 31 this morning amen
[10:32] Hallelujah
[10:34] glory to God
[10:38] Hallelujah
[10:40] so proverbs 31 verse 10 starts out
[10:45] amen
[10:49] proverbs 31 verse 10 starts out who can
[10:52] find a virtuous woman
[10:54] and I was thinking about that this
[10:56] morning a little bit and I said you know
[10:58] brother Kalima you did
[11:00] you know brother Charles you did you was
[11:03] raised by one too brother Charles you
[11:06] know
[11:07] the pastor found one we all we all did
[11:10] or we wouldn't be here in this room amen
[11:12] praise God
[11:16] for the Lord is good
[11:18] and I started thinking he he has found a
[11:21] virtuous woman as well
[11:24] and that's we are we are that the Bible
[11:28] says for her her price is far above
[11:31] rubies
[11:32] the heart of her husband doth safely
[11:34] trust in her so that he shall have no
[11:36] need of spoil
[11:38] she will do him good and not evil all
[11:40] the days of his of her life
[11:43] she seeketh wool and flax and worketh
[11:45] willingly with her hands
[11:47] she's like the Merchant's ships she
[11:49] bringeth food her food from afar
[11:52] she Rises also while it is yet night and
[11:55] giveth meat to her household in a
[11:57] portion to her maidens amen she
[12:00] considereth a field and buy it with the
[12:02] fruit of her hand she planted the
[12:04] vineyard she girdeth her loins with
[12:06] strength and strengtheneth her arms
[12:09] she's perceived that her merchandise is
[12:12] good her candle goeth not out by night
[12:15] she layeth her hands to the spindle and
[12:18] her hands hold the staff
[12:20] she stretches out the her hand to the
[12:23] poor yay she reaches forth her hands to
[12:26] the needy
[12:27] She's Not Afraid of the snow for a
[12:29] household for her house all of her
[12:31] household her clothed with Scarlet
[12:34] she maketh herself coverings of tapestry
[12:38] her clothing is silk and purple hey man
[12:41] find linen and royalty amen
[12:45] her husband is known in the gates
[12:47] when he sitteth among the Elders of the
[12:50] Lamb
[12:51] she maketh fine linen and sellot it and
[12:53] delivereth girdles into the merchant
[12:56] strength and honor are her clothing
[12:59] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[13:02] she openeth her mouth with wisdom
[13:06] and in her tongue is the law of kindness
[13:09] she looketh well to the ways of her
[13:11] household and eateth not the bread of
[13:13] idleness
[13:15] her children arise up and call her

[30:14] yes sir
[30:16] yep come on up I was wondering if you
[30:18] were gonna go ahead with that she fell
[30:20] asleep so uh I just wanted to thank the
[30:23] Lord for the last couple months
[30:27] yeah this is this might be a little
[30:29] lengthy I apologize but the before the
[30:32] baby was born things just started going
[30:34] wrong one after another our HVAC went
[30:37] out in our house we had to get it
[30:38] replaced and then we got it replaced and
[30:40] then
[30:41] um right after that our washing machine
[30:43] went out and then we had to get it
[30:44] replaced and then after we got it
[30:46] replaced then uh our kitchen sink
[30:48] started leaking water and started
[30:50] flooding our sink a little bit and this
[30:52] is all throughout a couple month period
[30:54] and then we fixed it well that was the
[30:56] whole process because it had to be
[30:57] custom made for our you know countertops
[31:00] and stuff whatever we got it fixed and
[31:02] then two days after I fixed the kitchen
[31:04] sink then a refrigerator went out which
[31:06] we haven't had one for a couple days and
[31:08] then after also in the meantime the
[31:11] mower that I have broke down so I
[31:12] couldn't mow my grass it got three foot
[31:14] tall it was just one thing after another
[31:15] after another Destiny was sick with an
[31:18] infection and then she got better and
[31:20] then she had bad allergies which turned
[31:22] into something else for two weeks and
[31:24] then the baby was on and off sick and I
[31:26] was like Lord I don't know what you're
[31:27] you're doing but I'm going to maintain a
[31:29] positive attitude and I'm going to just
[31:32] you know seek you and and just like
[31:34] continue to persevere and not complain
[31:36] not be negative we got a new vehicle and
[31:39] I had to sit in the driveway for two
[31:41] weeks because there was a title issue
[31:42] and it was just I was like Lord I know
[31:45] you know what you're doing and when
[31:46] Andrew Glover came and preached on
[31:48] Wednesday it just something struck my
[31:50] heart and I was like you know throughout
[31:52] all this process I saw myself kind of
[31:54] pull away from the tapes a little bit
[31:56] and because I was busy and stuff and I
[31:58] wasn't like listening the message like I
[31:59] used to and I was like Lord you know get
[32:02] me back in the tapes that I told Andrew
[32:04] after service I was like if that wasn't
[32:05] for anybody else in our church that was
[32:06] for me because the you know the the need
[32:10] for you know those tapes in our lives
[32:12] you know Church our walk with the Lord
[32:14] is in just a Sunday and Wednesday thing
[32:16] but it's a day-to-day thing and I was
[32:18] like war with the busyness of my life
[32:20] and the things going wrong I need to get
[32:22] back into the tapes well after Wednesday
[32:24] we got the car issue figured out we got
[32:27] the same fixed I got my mower started
[32:29] yesterday just everything falling back
[32:30] into place I'm like Lord I don't know
[32:32] why it took me so long to figure out
[32:34] what you were telling me but I
[32:35] appreciate you and God is good through
[32:37] it all I'm thankful for everything he's
[32:39] done for us and for the baby and you
[32:41] know just my wife and I'm just thankful
[32:43] for everything that God's done and just
[32:45] wanted to share that it was burning on
[32:47] my heart I was like Lord I'm not going
[32:48] to forget to thank you so
[32:51] foreign
[32:58] God he is in control I I did not ask
[33:02] permission for about this next prayer
[33:04] request but I was looking what speaking
[33:06] with brother um Isaiah falby this
[33:09] morning he's got something in his eye
[33:11] and he just really looked painful I've
[33:13] had eye issues in the past and I I felt
[33:16] you know felt to reach out so I wanna I
[33:18] wanna remember him this morning as we
[33:20] pray amen if y'all could stand we're
[33:22] going to go before the Lord yes ma'am
[33:24] okay let me give you this
[33:28] another praise report that's what we
[33:30] like amen
[33:33] it may seem small but to our family it's
[33:36] great
[33:37] our baby son Elijah has been struggling
[33:41] with reading since last year
[33:45] we've prayed about it as a family but
[33:48] you know sometimes God wants to get us
[33:50] by ourselves and strengthen our prayer
[33:53] life so
[33:54] he got with his dad it was a burden on
[33:56] his heart and he talked to his dad about
[33:58] it and his dad's been praying with him
[34:00] and then he's been praying and you see
[34:01] his little prayer life growing
[34:03] he got his progress report which is
[34:06] fourth quarter this week and I am happy
[34:09] to say that he brought his grade from an
[34:12] F to a b
[34:14] and as God
[34:22] amen
[34:27] I know if I got to be I was happy amen

[35:28] spiritual wickedness in higher places
[35:30] Lord and continue to be with us and

[35:51] service Lord especially for the tithes
[35:53] and offers the ones who who gives and

[46:35] somehow she will be streaming she's more
[46:37] up to date than many people
[46:40] amen glory to God you know she used to
[46:46] pray
[46:48] when she was a little that if she get a
[46:51] son may one of them be a preacher
[46:55] so being coming from a Catholic
[46:59] background so they took my brother first
[47:02] and send them to be a priest
[47:05] and they didn't work out he came out
[47:08] from there he said no I cannot be a
[47:10] priest and he came out from there so
[47:13] they were looking at me and they began
[47:14] to call me all kind of name they say
[47:17] okay this one is quiet he's probably
[47:19] this is the one that we go to the priest
[47:21] and everything and the kind of you know
[47:24] how parent they kind of work you up
[47:26] trying to go there and he didn't work up
[47:30] amen then I ended up being in a message
[47:34] and when I began to preach she realized
[47:36] she said okay my prayer has been
[47:38] answered not to be a priest but to be
[47:40] now a preacher under the priesthood of
[47:43] Melchizedek
[47:48] amen
[47:50] glory to God how many are up to date
[47:53] with the sermon if you didn't listen to
[47:56] Wednesday you need to go back and listen
[47:58] that was a masterpiece on Wednesday amen
[48:00] we're still reading our question and
[48:02] answer
[48:04] and one question a day we're still
[48:06] reading our Cod book
[48:08] we're still reading our church ages
[48:11] we're still reading our 70 weeks of
[48:13] Daniel
[48:14] I had somebody who is who already
[48:16] started the seals now okay three people
[48:20] started this years praise God glory to
[48:23] God that's what I did you do it will be
[48:27] okay amen
[48:28] it is the message of the hour these
[48:33] things will remove you from the air and
[48:35] stabilize you until you solve it and you
[48:38] know exactly why you believing and many
[48:41] of the questions brother Brian I'm
[48:43] already answering them in question and
[48:44] answer so by going through the question
[48:46] and answer automatically you begin to
[48:48] have question amen our religion is not a
[48:51] Catholic religion
[48:53] in a Catholic religion like brother
[48:56] Abraham explained the priest does
[48:58] everything
[49:00] and then the congregation just sit home
[49:02] and we do your homework
[49:04] in other words you send me a question I
[49:06] give you an answer you send me a
[49:08] question I'll give you an answer you
[49:09] don't do anything no that's not the way
[49:10] you work amen I'm digging the word you
[49:13] also are digging
[49:15] amen so sometime when I need a question
[49:18] or when I need an answer you give me the
[49:20] answer
[49:21] amen because we have the same Bible the
[49:24] same message book the same Cod
[49:26] everything is the same
[49:28] amen and matter of fact how are you
[49:30] going to know that what I'm preaching is
[49:31] right
[49:34] if you don't read the message on your
[49:36] own
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:38] because the disciple in Berea they
[49:40] always verify whether what they were
[49:43] preaching was coming from it that's why
[49:45] when I say open the Bible you all open
[49:48] the Bible so you can verify it for
[49:50] yourself that's why we put the quotes
[49:53] right here so everybody can see clear
[49:55] that this is where it comes from we
[49:58] don't want men opinion we don't want man
[50:01] idea we don't want men explanations we
[50:04] only want the word of God man opinion
[50:07] brought a lot of headache in this
[50:08] message
[50:11] amen I was talking to somebody about the
[50:15] message and they asked me to say what is
[50:17] Stephen but in this message they're
[50:18] preaching this they're preaching I said
[50:19] listen the way I'm training the church
[50:22] is I'm giving you the scripture and I'm
[50:25] giving you what brother Branham said if
[50:28] any preacher
[50:30] I don't care how big he is
[50:34] oh how long he has been in the message
[50:36] if what he says
[50:39] he cannot back it up by the scripture
[50:42] and the message of the hour you have the
[50:46] right to refuse it
[50:48] do not take it
[50:51] if it's his own opinion that him
[50:55] if it's a testimony that somebody met
[50:58] with Brother Branham and that testimony
[51:01] is not in the messages
[51:03] leave it right there
[51:05] stay with what is on the books
[51:08] and what is on the table
[51:14] everybody okay
[51:16] because we don't want after a few years
[51:18] then the testimony change
[51:20] then people were hanging on the
[51:22] testimony if you have something show me
[51:25] that if you give me the scripture I say
[51:27] Amen you give me the quote I say Amen if
[51:30] you don't have it I don't care how big
[51:32] you are
[51:33] I stay with what is what God told me to
[51:36] say amen because that is the message of
[51:39] the hour amen
[51:41] glory to God on May the 20th at 2 30 we
[51:45] gave the young men's meeting it's going
[51:47] to be here in church so please make sure
[51:50] everybody is on time so we can start on
[51:52] time amen amen patriarch okay praise God
[51:57] Amen on May the 27th we got a question
[52:02] and answer I believe brother Kelly our
[52:05] secret place room has been repaired
[52:08] so you know where it is we will send you
[52:10] the address again so that's where we
[52:12] will meet on the 27th what is the time
[52:15] again 2 30 2 30 so 2 30 on the 20th for
[52:19] the young man and two 2 30 on the 27th
[52:23] for question and answer amen glory to
[52:27] God I was talking to somebody asking me
[52:29] a question and I say I answer that
[52:31] question in the question and answer you
[52:33] were not there
[52:36] so you're bringing me question again
[52:38] that I already answering question and
[52:40] answer because you don't show up in
[52:42] question and answer then you come up
[52:43] with the same question again making me
[52:45] work double amen so make sure you there
[52:49] and everything will be okay the Deacon
[52:51] will let me know the next uh Wednesday
[52:53] prayer meeting and then for those that
[52:56] are waiting for music part one and two
[52:58] and three we finally got the software to
[53:01] put everything and upload the the code
[53:04] because it was already uh streamed and
[53:07] it was hard to find how to upload the
[53:10] code again we had to buy it's called
[53:12] electronic passport or something that
[53:14] the technician told me so just give me
[53:16] some time and they will upload the code
[53:18] they never think so we will release it
[53:20] amen so you listen to music part one
[53:23] part two part three and you know what
[53:25] kind of music you need to listen in the
[53:28] message and outside the message
[53:30] so don't say because the message
[53:32] believer the music is right
[53:35] it doesn't make them right you need to
[53:37] go by the same calibration because what
[53:40] is the source of their inspiration where
[53:42] are they getting the music for Who are
[53:44] they trying to imitate when they're
[53:46] singing are they trying to imitate the
[53:48] people of the world the Pentecostal or
[53:50] are they trying to sing Under the
[53:52] inspiration when you're dancing you're
[53:54] dancing for what
[53:56] it's already spoken and everything got
[53:59] clear amen is my volume okay
[54:02] I learned to check on the volume
[54:04] everybody okay I'm not blasting
[54:06] somebody's here so let's go ahead and
[54:08] bless the devil
[54:13] amen the Book of Esther chapter 2.
[54:18] [Laughter]
[54:21] amen we're trying to preach this
[54:24] something coming up we're trying to
[54:26] preach this something came up so it was
[54:29] like a delay going on so today by God's
[54:33] grace it looks like we will lend into it
[54:35] like I said with pilling another layer
[54:39] of Matthew 25 so
[54:43] I will please ask you to stay alert
[54:48] okay
[54:50] okay
[54:51] this is very difficult
[54:55] but if you don't have this element
[54:59] you'll have trouble putting things in a
[55:01] message and you will see brother Branham
[55:03] one time say something here and one time
[55:06] brother Brian I'm saying something else
[55:07] and you don't know how to put them
[55:09] together then one message church will
[55:11] take this side and God with it and
[55:13] another message church will take this
[55:15] side and go with it and we put people
[55:17] under confusion there is no
[55:19] contradiction in the message
[55:22] the contradiction is in our mind
[55:25] there is no contradiction in the Bible
[55:28] if you see something that looks like
[55:30] it's contradicting itself just know it's
[55:33] something you have not caught it yet
[55:35] if you give a time you stay under prayer
[55:37] the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you amen
[55:40] so Esther chapter 2 if you dare you can
[55:43] say Amen verse one we went deeply in the
[55:46] Book of Esther
[55:48] stop somewhere but I believe you should
[55:51] have a beautiful good background here
[55:54] the Bible says in verse 1 after these
[55:57] things
[55:58] when the Wrath of the King ahazarus was
[56:01] appeased he remembered vastra
[56:06] and what she has done
[56:09] and what was decreed against her you
[56:12] might be seated you need to keep your
[56:15] Bible today
[56:17] and say the king's servant that
[56:19] ministered to him
[56:21] let there be fair young virgins
[56:26] sought for the king
[56:28] so not any woman could be bring that
[56:31] could be brought there she has to be a
[56:34] virgin and Matthew 25 is dealing with
[56:36] the virgin
[56:37] everybody okay
[56:39] praise God he says and let the king
[56:43] appoint
[56:45] verse 3 let the king appoint officers in
[56:50] all the provinces of his kingdom that
[56:53] they may gather together all the fair
[56:57] young virgins to shushan the Palace
[57:00] to the house of the women to the custody
[57:04] of hege the king's Chamberlain Keeper of
[57:09] the women and let their things for
[57:12] purification be given them
[57:16] so the first qualification they had to
[57:19] be virgin
[57:20] but if you look even though they are
[57:23] picked
[57:24] they cannot be brought into the presence
[57:26] of the king
[57:27] they have to go through a purification
[57:30] so to be picked
[57:33] is not good enough
[57:36] hi everybody okay
[57:38] everybody okay so if they picked you
[57:43] to be a member of the Bride it doesn't
[57:48] means that you made it
[57:50] foreign
[57:52] [Music]
[57:55] because
[57:57] okay let me keep it everybody okay so
[57:59] number one you gotta be picked
[58:04] amen and we know picked mint water
[58:09] everybody okay
[58:11] it means justification because Brother
[58:14] Brad I'm saying justification if it's a
[58:17] glass of water that has been dropped
[58:19] somewhere when you pick it up they
[58:21] justify you they qualify You by
[58:24] depicting it goes with the calling
[58:29] so you have been called
[58:31] you have been selected
[58:37] everybody okay
[58:38] but
[58:39] regardless of how much you are put in
[58:42] the pool
[58:43] of the virgin
[58:44] you still
[58:46] not sure whether you're gonna make it to
[58:48] the king or not
[58:50] everybody okay
[58:52] praise God now from after the picking up
[58:55] you go through the Chamberlain
[58:59] everybody okay in the Chamberlain you go
[59:02] in there for the purification
[59:08] amen
[59:11] glory to God
[59:13] you're going to the purification
[59:15] purification means water
[59:19] are we okay
[59:22] sanctification
[59:27] amen
[59:29] being picked
[59:31] called selected doesn't qualify you
[59:37] being
[59:39] sanctify still doesn't qualify you
[59:42] but you on the right Channel
[59:46] but it doesn't mean you're gonna make it
[59:50] everybody okay
[59:52] everybody okay
[59:54] let me help you with this sanctification
[59:56] job to verse uh
[1:00:00] job to verse 12 then I will call back
[1:00:02] again
[1:00:05] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:00:08] now when every maid's turn was come to
[1:00:11] go into the king
[1:00:14] ahazarus after that she had been 12
[1:00:17] months according to the manner of the
[1:00:21] women
[1:00:21] for so were the days of their
[1:00:24] purification accomplished that is six
[1:00:27] months with oil of Mary we've already
[1:00:29] went through this and six months with
[1:00:32] sweet order and with other things for
[1:00:34] the purifying of the water
[1:00:37] so you gotta go through the purifying so
[1:00:39] you are still you are no longer with
[1:00:42] your parent you are selected they put
[1:00:45] you in the king Palace you are going
[1:00:48] through the sanctification but you have
[1:00:50] not seen the king yet
[1:00:55] everybody okay everybody okay so you
[1:00:58] can't stop there
[1:01:00] you got to move forward
[1:01:01] we okay now let's go back to verse four
[1:01:04] and let the maiden which do water please
[1:01:08] is who
[1:01:10] the king is God
[1:01:13] it is the it is a representation of
[1:01:16] Christ here
[1:01:17] amen so the problem is you gotta please
[1:01:21] the king
[1:01:24] you can be a virgin
[1:01:28] you can be selected
[1:01:30] you can be purified
[1:01:32] you can go through the purification but
[1:01:35] if you don't please the king
[1:01:40] everything is gone
[1:01:42] everybody okay how do you please the
[1:01:45] king
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:49] if the king if king of hazardous is God
[1:01:53] is Christ and the bread that is coming
[1:01:57] is going to be the bread of Christ how
[1:02:00] do you please God
[1:02:03] because without water it is impossible
[1:02:07] to do water
[1:02:10] so being picked
[1:02:13] is not enough being justified is not
[1:02:17] enough there is something in you
[1:02:20] that the king is looking for
[1:02:22] when the king will see that thing then
[1:02:25] you will please him
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:28] everybody okay
[1:02:30] pleasing by faith
[1:02:34] because with that Faith the Bible say it
[1:02:37] is impossible to please God it's in uh
[1:02:42] Hebrew chapter 11. everybody okay
[1:02:45] and let the maiden which pleases the
[1:02:48] king big Queen instead of faster and the
[1:02:51] thing please the king and he did so
[1:02:54] everybody okay
[1:02:56] now job to verse 13.
[1:03:00] Hallelujah
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:04] after the purification of verse 12 verse
[1:03:07] 13 say then thus came every Maiden to
[1:03:12] the king
[1:03:13] whatsoever she desired was given her to
[1:03:18] go with her out of the house of the
[1:03:20] women to the water King's house
[1:03:23] so when the purification is finished
[1:03:25] amen you gotta carry something with you
[1:03:30] am I reading a different Bible
[1:03:33] and whatever you desire they will give
[1:03:36] it to you for you to go there
[1:03:38] amen the bottom line is you are picked
[1:03:43] you are purified then you are carrying
[1:03:46] something
[1:03:47] with you
[1:03:49] and that is what puts you in the

[1:07:49] in other words

[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:59] praise be to the name of the Lord
[1:09:02] the Bible say she required nothing but
[1:09:05] what hege the king's Chamberlain The
[1:09:08] Keeper of the house appointed in other
[1:09:11] words advised and Esther obtained favor
[1:09:16] in the sight of all of them that do
[1:09:20] water were they just looking at her
[1:09:23] beauty
[1:09:24] they were also looking at water
[1:09:26] the dress code
[1:09:33] when the head gets saved put this you

[1:10:26] to the will of the Chamberlain
[1:10:29] you will please the king
[1:10:32] everybody okay
[1:10:34] let's go to Matthew 27.
[1:10:44] stubbornness is a bad thing
[1:10:48] stubbornness
[1:10:56] and stubbornness
[1:10:58] is linked with a high opinion of
[1:11:01] yourself
[1:11:04] and it's usually backed up with
[1:11:07] intellectualism
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:14] Amen in other words if it doesn't make
[1:11:17] sense to me I won't do it
[1:11:22] versus if it's the word of God where
[1:11:25] they make sense to me or not because
[1:11:29] it's the word of God I'm Gonna Take It
[1:11:32] but I don't see what is wrong with it
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:37] you're in the deadly walk
[1:11:40] Matthew 27 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:11:44] I'm gonna go slowly because this is uh
[1:11:48] something that need to be loaded pretty
[1:11:50] good verse 50. if you dare you can say
[1:11:52] Amen
[1:11:54] Jesus
[1:11:56] in verse 50 the Bible says Jesus
[1:12:02] when he cried again
[1:12:05] with a loud voice
[1:12:08] he yielded up the ghost
[1:12:11] so on the cross
[1:12:13] we found out that Jesus cried
[1:12:17] and he cried with a loud voice
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:23] so there is a shout
[1:12:29] everybody everybody okay
[1:12:31] praise God
[1:12:33] verse 51 and behold
[1:12:36] the veil of the temple was renting too
[1:12:40] from the top to the bottom and the Earth
[1:12:43] did quick
[1:12:44] and the Rocks red
[1:12:49] everybody okay
[1:12:51] keep those events and the grave
[1:12:54] were open and many bodies of descent
[1:12:59] which slept a rose
[1:13:02] the way we are interpreting this
[1:13:05] by a denominational understanding and by
[1:13:09] our movie that we have watched
[1:13:12] is as soon as Jesus Christ at the cross
[1:13:15] oh
[1:13:18] the veil of the temple Pew and then in
[1:13:21] the cemetery
[1:13:22] and then the people begin to come out
[1:13:27] that's why we get in trouble
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:33] amen very important watch verse 53. and
[1:13:38] came out of the water
[1:13:41] How can there be a rose so what happened
[1:13:44] so were they awake and they were waiting
[1:13:49] wait when are we waiting
[1:13:55] do you know why I'm saying all of that
[1:13:57] because brother Branham says this he
[1:14:00] says but as usual when one regard a
[1:14:04] verse hell superficially he comes up
[1:14:07] with a water superficial officially
[1:14:09] standing
[1:14:12] everybody okay so let's peel off The
[1:14:15] Superficial layer let's get a little bit
[1:14:18] deeper and see what happened verse 53
[1:14:21] say and came out of the Grave those that
[1:14:25] were uh dead that Rose
[1:14:28] after his water Resurrection in other
[1:14:31] word in other word when Jesus Christ
[1:14:36] screamed at the cross those people were
[1:14:39] still there
[1:14:44] so you need to watch what you see on the
[1:14:45] movie
[1:14:47] or in the cartoons
[1:14:49] everybody okay
[1:14:51] according to the way we read the Bible
[1:14:53] Jesus screamed they went uh there was
[1:14:56] wet and then the people came out that's
[1:14:58] not the way Jesus was the firstborn
[1:15:03] the water
[1:15:06] so nobody can come before Jesus Christ
[1:15:09] [Applause]
[1:15:10] in other words even though they shout
[1:15:13] was released and that shout did
[1:15:17] something in Paradise
[1:15:21] yet
[1:15:23] the Fulfillment
[1:15:25] of the opening of the grave didn't
[1:15:28] happen until Christ Rose
[1:15:31] I don't know if it's okay
[1:15:33] in other words between the shout
[1:15:38] and the resurrection
[1:15:41] of the sleeping virgin of the sleeping
[1:15:44] scent everybody okay
[1:15:48] everybody okay there is a gap
[1:15:55] there is a gap
[1:15:57] there is a space of time
[1:16:02] everybody okay
[1:16:04] why is space of time because there is a
[1:16:07] Ministry
[1:16:10] I'm going slowly I preach all of this
[1:16:14] roof to get where I'm getting
[1:16:17] everybody okay it is not that the shout
[1:16:21] and the people resurrected and they
[1:16:23] begin to go no no no no no no no no no
[1:16:25] no Jesus first must go to hell
[1:16:30] Jesus must preach to the souls that were
[1:16:33] in prison
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:35] when he finished that's when he have to
[1:16:38] beat the devil down
[1:16:39] then he moved from the devil and go to
[1:16:42] paradise and pick the scent out so there
[1:16:46] is a Ministry there are something in
[1:16:49] between
[1:16:53] if you don't understand what I'm saying
[1:16:55] today you're gonna have a hard time in
[1:16:58] this message
[1:16:59] everybody okay so there is a gap there
[1:17:02] is a space of time there is a Ministry
[1:17:09] everybody okay
[1:17:11] so whenever a shout come
[1:17:14] amen there will be a break
[1:17:19] there is a work to do
[1:17:24] and this is the problem it's gonna be
[1:17:27] I'm going by the scriptures so we don't
[1:17:29] go left and right thinking about any
[1:17:31] opinion we're going by the scripture
[1:17:34] let's go to verse 53.
[1:17:37] and came out of the Grave after water
[1:17:40] his so after the resurrection of Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ that's when the Sleepy sin came
[1:17:46] out
[1:17:47] now
[1:17:49] the day came out and went to the rapture
[1:17:54] are we okay are you following me so
[1:17:57] between the resurrection I'm going
[1:18:00] slowly
[1:18:04] everybody okay
[1:18:06] between the resurrection and the rapture
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:11] there is again a gap
[1:18:16] oh Lord
[1:18:18] spoken word I know what I'm talking
[1:18:22] about
[1:18:23] I don't know why I come across a lot of
[1:18:25] Doctrine in this message
[1:18:27] but I want you to get what I'm saying
[1:18:30] and you would never have a trouble in
[1:18:32] this message
[1:18:35] everybody okay
[1:18:36] so
[1:18:37] let's read it
[1:18:39] that's fine let's go to verse 53 and
[1:18:42] they came out of the Grave after his
[1:18:44] water Resurrection comma and went into
[1:18:47] the water holy city and appeared water
[1:18:50] meaning so the people that Rose never
[1:18:53] just Rose and took off to Heaven no
[1:18:56] Abraham and Sarah sat and they went into
[1:18:59] Jerusalem and they begin to appear to
[1:19:01] people before they go out
[1:19:05] because after Resurrection there was
[1:19:09] another Ministry
[1:19:14] let me help you up
[1:19:16] it's a different language I understand
[1:19:18] it do you know that when Jesus Christ
[1:19:21] resurrected he multiplied fishes again
[1:19:26] who doesn't know that raise your hand
[1:19:31] who doesn't know please raise your hand

[1:20:17] know that you need it okay
[1:20:20] okay

[1:20:26] verse uh
[1:20:30] verse 24.
[1:20:34] are you there
[1:20:36] but Thomas one of the 12 called the
[1:20:38] demos was not with them when Jesus came
[1:20:42] the other disciple therefore said to him
[1:20:45] we have sinned the Lord but he said to
[1:20:47] them except I shall see in his hand the
[1:20:51] print of the nail and put my finger into
[1:20:54] the print of his nail and trust my hand
[1:20:56] into his side I will not water
[1:20:58] in other words what I'm trying to show
[1:21:00] you here is chapter 20 Jesus already
[1:21:03] Resurrected
[1:21:05] and his appearing and disappearing okay
[1:21:08] okay now let's go to chapter 21.
[1:21:12] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:21:15] are you there
[1:21:19] job 2 verse uh three
[1:21:24] Lord help me I don't know which
[1:21:26] direction we're heading now
[1:21:28] but I'm going to follow the spirit
[1:21:30] Simon Peter said to them I'll go a
[1:21:34] fishing this is after the resurrection
[1:21:37] remember before the resurrection Jesus
[1:21:40] multiply fishes he borrowed the boat of
[1:21:44] Peter and after he finished preaching on
[1:21:46] the boat he went and he multiplied
[1:21:48] fishes
[1:21:49] I'm not talking about multiply the bread
[1:21:51] of fishes Peter told him that a sale all
[1:21:55] night I didn't find anything but at that
[1:21:58] word I'm gonna cast out the net and he
[1:22:01] put that was before
[1:22:02] he was there now we are after The
[1:22:05] Resurrection everybody okay
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:10] everybody okay
[1:22:12] they went forth so Peter told the guys
[1:22:15] you know boys what are we doing nothing
[1:22:17] he said come on let's go fish
[1:22:21] everybody okay
[1:22:22] day white verse three and enter into a
[1:22:25] ship immediately and that night they
[1:22:28] caught water nothing after the
[1:22:30] resurrection
[1:22:31] verse 4 but when the morning was now
[1:22:34] come Jesus stood on the show but the
[1:22:38] disciple knew not that he was hooked
[1:22:41] because he has Crew He has resurrected
[1:22:44] now he got to open your eyes for you to
[1:22:46] see him everybody okay
[1:22:48] verse uh Our Father then Jesus said to
[1:22:52] them children
[1:22:54] if you notice he's calling them children
[1:22:56] because Judah is no longer there
[1:23:01] he doesn't call them children when Judah
[1:23:04] is there
[1:23:05] because Judah was not his child
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:08] everybody okay everybody good he said
[1:23:12] children have you any meat they answer
[1:23:15] him water no so they thought they were
[1:23:17] answering somebody
[1:23:20] and he said verse 6 to them help me up a
[1:23:23] little bit brother uh David cast the net
[1:23:26] on the right side of the ship
[1:23:29] the same thing he did before everybody
[1:23:31] okay and you shall fund
[1:23:34] nobody thought he was Jesus they thought
[1:23:37] maybe somebody saying that
[1:23:39] they cast therefore and now they were
[1:23:43] not able to draw it for the multitude of
[1:23:46] water fishes so Jesus created fishes
[1:23:50] after his resurrection
[1:23:53] verse 7 therefore that disciple whom
[1:23:56] Jesus loved said to Peter John it is the
[1:24:00] Lord now when someone Peter heard that
[1:24:03] he was the Lord he gird his fishes quote
[1:24:07] to him for he was water what a brother a
[1:24:11] brother and did cast himself into
[1:24:13] the water see
[1:24:15] so what happened Jesus multiplied bread
[1:24:19] when he multiplied I mean fishes after
[1:24:23] the resurrection so when Jesus Christ
[1:24:25] Rose
[1:24:27] he didn't just rise and go to heaven
[1:24:31] Jesus was doing things and matter of
[1:24:34] fact he also did miracle
[1:24:37] I don't know if you get me so if we go
[1:24:40] back to Matthew 27
[1:24:45] verse 53 the Bible say and came out of
[1:24:50] the Grave after his resurrection and
[1:24:53] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:24:56] water meaning so what I'm trying to say
[1:24:58] is before the Rapture of Jesus Christ
[1:25:02] and the Old Testament sent between the
[1:25:06] resurrection and the Rapture itself
[1:25:09] there was a gap
[1:25:13] or a space of time
[1:25:18] amen and Jesus did certain things again
[1:25:25] amen so coming back to what we read when
[1:25:30] Jesus shouted now
[1:25:34] nothing happened
[1:25:39] but what was needed already came out
[1:25:44] but even though it came out the
[1:25:47] Fulfillment of it doesn't come out at
[1:25:50] the same time he came here
[1:25:53] everybody okay
[1:25:54] let's go to Matthew 28.
[1:26:00] if you dare you can say Amen verse 1 in
[1:26:03] the end of the Sabbath as he begin to
[1:26:06] join to down toward the first day of the
[1:26:09] week
[1:26:09] can marry Magdalene and the other Mary
[1:26:13] to see the Sepulcher and behold there
[1:26:16] was a great earthquake
[1:26:18] and for the angel of the lord we went
[1:26:20] through this
[1:26:21] did what descended descended from heaven
[1:26:25] and came and rolled back the Stone from
[1:26:28] the door
[1:26:28] his countenance was like lightning and
[1:26:32] his Remnant white as water no so even
[1:26:36] though the shout was released
[1:26:39] amen the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:26:43] needed a descending
[1:26:46] all right
[1:26:49] of an Angel
[1:26:51] everybody okay so between the shout of
[1:26:54] the Cross and the resurrection of the
[1:26:57] sand there is a period of time
[1:27:00] and between the resurrection of the
[1:27:03] center and the Rapture there is also a
[1:27:07] space of time if you don't get these
[1:27:10] gaps this space of time you're gonna get
[1:27:12] in trouble with William Marion Branham
[1:27:14] let's go to uh Revelation 19 then we can
[1:27:18] pray
[1:27:24] so when you see somebody telling you
[1:27:26] Jesus shouted in the Old Testament said
[1:27:28] came out no
[1:27:30] Jesus shouted something happened with
[1:27:33] the Old Testament sin but nobody could
[1:27:36] come out
[1:27:38] they just like
[1:27:41] but nobody can come out until
[1:27:44] Jesus Christ be the first one so that in
[1:27:48] everything the Bible say he must be he
[1:27:50] must have preeminence everybody okay
[1:27:52] because he was the first born from the
[1:27:54] dead and when he come out before he goes
[1:27:58] up slow down again what happened Abraham
[1:28:02] David Jobe all of them say hey

[1:30:24] blessed are they which are caught you
[1:30:29] see the word call
[1:30:31] to the marriage supper of the lamb and
[1:30:35] he says to me these are the true sayings
[1:30:38] of who
[1:30:41] God so to go to the marriage you must be
[1:30:44] called you must be invited but we found
[1:30:48] according to the S to Esther invited is
[1:30:52] not enough
[1:30:55] amen you must also be chosen
[1:31:02] you can be invited but you are not
[1:31:05] chosen
[1:31:08] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:31:11] approaching you humbly again father this
[1:31:14] morning Lord thanking you for your grace
[1:31:16] for your love for your mercy and for
[1:31:19] everything you have been doing for us
[1:31:21] father this is as far as I can go and
[1:31:25] Lord we are surrendering ourselves and
[1:31:27] the audience where the visible here and
[1:31:30] invisible unto their hand so that the
[1:31:32] Holy Spirit can come and unfold your
[1:31:34] word Lord may you move me completely
[1:31:37] Assad may you lock every demonic spirit
[1:31:41] away from this place but father come as
[1:31:45] the esad teacher and open your word to
[1:31:48] your children and bless us touch those
[1:31:51] that needed a touch whether in the body
[1:31:53] in the spirit or in the soul in the name
[1:31:56] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:00] glory to God my subject today this
[1:32:04] morning
[1:32:05] is the four phases of roof the voice of
[1:32:09] the archangel
[1:32:11] and the Trump
[1:32:14] everybody okay the voice of the
[1:32:16] Archangel and the Trump we are very very
[1:32:20] deep
[1:32:22] in Ruth chapter four which is the last
[1:32:25] phase of roof which is roof rewarded
[1:32:27] when roof will be United in the body
[1:32:31] because in the threshing floor roof was
[1:32:34] United in Word with Boaz but in roof
[1:32:37] chapter 4 now Boaz removed the King's
[1:32:41] Men Redeemer which was the devil the
[1:32:43] near one until they can both marry
[1:32:45] together and have a baby by the name of
[1:32:48] Obed amen into the Tabernacle we have
[1:32:53] roof into the holiest where roof is
[1:32:55] resting and we understand by resting it
[1:32:59] is when roof received the baptism of the
[1:33:01] Holy Spirit
[1:33:02] and the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:33:05] the translation of the Soul
[1:33:09] it is the rapture of the Soul
[1:33:12] it is the transformation of the Soul
[1:33:16] it is the glorification of the Soul it
[1:33:20] is the quickening of the soul and it is
[1:33:23] the resurrection of the Soul
[1:33:26] so translation quickening transformation
[1:33:30] all these words are saying about the
[1:33:32] same thing
[1:33:35] because you cannot have redemption in
[1:33:37] the body without having Redemption into
[1:33:39] the soul and in the soul it is the
[1:33:42] earnest
[1:33:43] of your Resurrection you will receive
[1:33:45] the down payment you remember that and
[1:33:48] the down payment started in the saw
[1:33:49] before you receive your body change
[1:33:52] which take you from Wonder from one
[1:33:54] dimension into an invisible Dimension
[1:33:57] when you go to heaven and you see your
[1:33:59] Maker Now why are we dealing today with
[1:34:04] the voice of the Archangel and the Trump
[1:34:07] because we know that we got three things
[1:34:10] we got the shelter we got the voice of
[1:34:13] the Archangel and the chomp but today we
[1:34:16] are only dealing with the voice of the
[1:34:18] Archangel and the Trump why pastor
[1:34:21] let's go to first Thessalonians chapter
[1:34:24] 4. you need your Bible as we're coming
[1:34:27] now
[1:34:30] Hallelujah

[1:43:11] let me ask you before I read verse 16.
[1:43:13] When Jesus Christ is coming he's coming
[1:43:16] alone
[1:43:17] he's coming with who is coming with the

[1:52:39] if you stay alive and you not change you
[1:52:42] doom
[1:52:43] if you die and you don't change you do
[1:52:48] so there are people that will die and be
[1:52:51] changed and there are people that won't
[1:52:53] die and will be changed because when
[1:52:55] Jesus Christ is coming Paul say some of
[1:52:58] the people will be alive and remain
[1:53:01] everybody go there let's go to verse 52
[1:53:04] now
[1:53:06] Paul just say that we shall not all
[1:53:09] sleep but we shall be have
[1:53:12] if you notice after change do you have a
[1:53:15] Karma or a period
[1:53:18] what should kill you what do you have a
[1:53:21] period or a comma
[1:53:22] it means that whatever started is water
[1:53:27] everybody okay watch it now now but we
[1:53:31] shall be all how
[1:53:33] change in the water so he's continuing
[1:53:37] the idea
[1:53:39] in a momentum in the water twinkling of
[1:53:42] an eye at the last water sure
[1:53:45] do you see Paul speaking about the shout
[1:53:48] here
[1:53:49] do you see the voice of the Archangel
[1:53:51] here
[1:53:52] Paul is talking about what
[1:53:56] according to Paul in First Corinthians
[1:53:59] 15 the Trump of God follow me carefully
[1:54:04] is what will bring the change
[1:54:09] I'm just reading
[1:54:11] index
[1:54:14] I told you it's a difficulty
[1:54:16] Paul say we shall all be changed in the
[1:54:20] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:54:24] last water so the last job will bring a
[1:54:27] change
[1:54:28] in the moment and in the tweaking of an
[1:54:31] eye
[1:54:33] are we together
[1:54:34] are we together
[1:54:38] the last Trump according to First
[1:54:42] Corinthians he brings water he brings a
[1:54:45] change
[1:54:47] Amen in a moment
[1:54:50] in a twinkling of an eye amen
[1:54:54] fine let's continue
[1:54:57] you there
[1:54:59] verse 52 in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:55:04] an eye at the last water sure
[1:55:07] the last Trump
[1:55:10] watch now for the water trumpet
[1:55:14] not the Trump
[1:55:20] everybody okay for the water trumpet
[1:55:23] there is a difference
[1:55:27] between a trumpet
[1:55:30] and the Trump
[1:55:34] everybody okay a trumpet is an estimate
[1:55:40] and the Trump is the sound of the
[1:55:44] trumpet
[1:55:46] [Applause]
[1:55:47] everybody okay
[1:55:49] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:55:54] everybody okay now let's go he said for
[1:55:59] the trumpet
[1:56:01] the Trump brings the change
[1:56:04] but for the trumpet shall be water sound
[1:56:07] but I thought there was already a I mean
[1:56:11] a sound of the Trump over there that
[1:56:13] already changed the people why is the
[1:56:15] trumpet sounding again
[1:56:24] now according to First Corinthians 15
[1:56:28] what is rising the Dead
[1:56:31] insurance
[1:56:33] brother Branham say what is rushing the
[1:56:36] Dead
[1:56:44] according to First Corinthians 15 the
[1:56:48] trumpet
[1:56:51] everybody okay and bring the
[1:56:54] resurrection of descent everybody okay
[1:56:58] bring the resurrection of the sand
[1:57:01] and there will be less Incorruptible and
[1:57:04] we shall be housed
[1:57:07] ah so Paul is saying even though we will
[1:57:11] change we don't change like that
[1:57:14] first the people must be raising again
[1:57:17] from the dead then after the rise from
[1:57:21] the dead that's when we change
[1:57:24] everybody okay everybody okay I just
[1:57:27] read it in the scripture let me read it
[1:57:29] over Paul said and the dead shall raise
[1:57:33] Incorruptible and we shall be held so
[1:57:37] the changing happen after the
[1:57:39] resurrection
[1:57:43] but the one who caused the change is the
[1:57:47] Trump but the one who calls the
[1:57:49] resurrection is the trumpet
[1:57:53] so in other words in second in first uh
[1:57:57] uh First Corinthians we have the trumpet
[1:58:00] and we got the Trump
[1:58:03] everybody okay the Trump is matching the
[1:58:07] Trump of first Thessalonians
[1:58:09] in according to first Thessalonians 4
[1:58:12] the resurrection is done by the voice of
[1:58:15] the Archangel but according to First
[1:58:18] Corinthians the resurrection is done by
[1:58:20] the trumpet
[1:58:25] so which one was the Dead
[1:58:28] the voice of the trumpet let's go to
[1:58:31] revelation 1.

[1:59:32] it's the water
[1:59:36] The Voice everybody okay

[2:00:46] Corinthian does not contradict first
[2:00:49] Thessalonians
[2:00:52] Paul just use a different terminology
[2:00:55] but Paul is saying the same thing
[2:00:59] The Trumpet of the voice is what rides

[2:02:37] power to take John from the Earth
[2:02:41] immediately and pull him and put him in
[2:02:44] heaven

[2:06:14] to know what water to do
[2:06:20] Paul say if a trumpet give a water
[2:06:25] we don't know what to do
[2:06:27] we need to know whether it's War whether
[2:06:30] it's telling us exit of the building
[2:06:35] you must have the heartbeat of the
[2:06:37] spirit
[2:06:38] you must have the earnest of the
[2:06:41] Resurrection because a voice will send
[2:06:43] the signal
[2:06:45] everybody okay and you must know what to
[2:06:48] do with the sound you're hearing
[2:06:52] listen to this we reach our water alive
[2:06:56] and remain shall not prevent or heal the
[2:06:59] doors that are water I sleep so the
[2:07:01] water
[2:07:03] all those soldiers laying here on the
[2:07:05] house across through the water but when
[2:07:09] the trumpet son don't they be dead in
[2:07:12] water sleep it shall not hinder for the
[2:07:16] trumpets
[2:07:20] those unprepared don't know their sound
[2:07:24] when the sound of the coming of the Lord
[2:07:28] water bless is sex water heaven and what
[2:07:32] the hell when he does water but those
[2:07:35] who are in hell don't know who those who
[2:07:38] are water no don't know their water they
[2:07:41] don't know what to do
[2:07:46] in other words when the sound of the
[2:07:50] trumpet is released is Shake everywhere
[2:07:53] even hell will hear it but it's only
[2:07:57] coded
[2:08:02] everybody okay it is not a general sound
[2:08:06] if it's a generous hand everybody will
[2:08:10] be awakened it is only to the Bride of
[2:08:13] Jesus Christ those that are sleeping in
[2:08:17] Jesus Christ they know what to do with
[2:08:20] that sound
[2:08:22] those in hell will hear it
[2:08:24] but they won't move because they have to
[2:08:27] wait for another sound
[2:08:29] of the general resurrection that will
[2:08:32] raise them up that's why the Bible said
[2:08:34] those that were in the grave heard the
[2:08:37] sound of the son of man it is no more
[2:08:39] the bread the bread have a specific
[2:08:41] sound like Lazarus
[2:08:43] but your name that God calls you is not
[2:08:47] the name we carry here
[2:08:50] everybody okay when you are buried in
[2:08:52] your husband you pick up your husband
[2:08:54] name
[2:08:55] so when Jesus Christ is coming he
[2:08:58] doesn't have to sit and come one two
[2:09:00] three four five six seven no when we are
[2:09:03] baptized we are baptized in the name we
[2:09:07] pray in that name we bless our food in
[2:09:10] that name when you are in the name if
[2:09:13] Jesus call one name
[2:09:15] everybody that is connected to the name
[2:09:18] will rise up together because you slept
[2:09:22] in class
[2:09:25] how do you enter in Christ by one Spirit
[2:09:28] are we well into water so when they call
[2:09:32] Jesus whoever have Jesus in the heart
[2:09:36] whether you are alive or whether you are
[2:09:39] working something will ring the bell in
[2:09:42] you and say that oh the Lord is coming
[2:09:47] the Lord is coming the Lord is coming to
[2:09:50] pick me up how do you know something in
[2:09:54] me just told me that God is coming
[2:09:57] [Applause]
[2:10:01] glory to God brother Adam say that same
[2:10:05] voice that sound when the day did Christ
[2:10:08] did what wise for the trumpet the water
[2:10:12] what is a trumpet the voice of who
[2:10:15] Christ everybody clear now the same one
[2:10:19] that sounded and summoned him up he
[2:10:22] heard the voice like water and said the
[2:10:25] water come up hither see how the
[2:10:27] resurrection will be it will be how a
[2:10:29] moment in a twinkling of an eye that
[2:10:32] clear sounding voice and he shall do
[2:10:34] water summon the church calling and
[2:10:36] doing water that great summoning voice
[2:10:39] God help me to water hear it that day
[2:10:45] how do you hear it brother Branham say
[2:10:48] the heartbeat of the Holy Spirit must be
[2:10:51] in other words a modem
[2:10:53] must be put in you
[2:10:56] so when they send the signal from Heaven
[2:10:58] you have a decoder that can receive and
[2:11:01] then unfold completely
[2:11:04] everybody okay
[2:11:06] we have established three things
[2:11:09] according to the Cross we have the shout
[2:11:12] we have the resurrection of descent and
[2:11:15] we have the Rapture in between them we
[2:11:17] found out that we got what gaps now
[2:11:20] according to first Thessalonians we got
[2:11:23] the shout we got the voice we got the
[2:11:26] trumpet of God and Paul confirmed the
[2:11:29] same in First Corinthians by calling the
[2:11:31] voice of the Archangel the trumpet and
[2:11:34] the Trump is still keep the same
[2:11:35] terminology everybody okay now we know

[2:11:42] sequence of those elements
[2:11:46] I'm good in time everybody okay what is
[2:11:50] the sequence
[2:11:51] William William
[2:11:53] saying no matter he fall asleep in the

[2:12:00] or water six or water wherever he fall

[2:12:30] everybody okay if this is the way
[2:12:33] brother Branham spoke here
[2:12:36] so we should see the dead in Christ
[2:12:38] but they are not there yet
[2:12:40] brother Branham himself died we see our
[2:12:43] loved one continue to die

[2:17:03] to a cave
[2:17:05] so ahoreb had the cave
[2:17:09] everybody okay
[2:17:11] and Lodge dead
[2:17:13] and behold the word of the Lord came to
[2:17:16] him and he said to him what do you hear
[2:17:21] Elijah
[2:17:22] and he said I have been very jealous
[2:17:26] in other words zero
[2:17:28] for the Lord God of hosts for the
[2:17:31] children of Israel have forsaken your
[2:17:33] Covenant
[2:17:35] throw down your altars and slain your
[2:17:37] Prophet with the sword and I even I only
[2:17:41] am left and they seek my life to take it
[2:17:44] away and he says do what go forth
[2:17:48] and stand upon the Water if you notice a
[2:17:52] large Jack when he got to mahoreb first
[2:17:56] he went and sat under a cave in a cave
[2:18:01] and God asked him a question what is he
[2:18:03] doing there
[2:18:04] and he answered the question and God
[2:18:07] will not talk to Elijah now in the cave
[2:18:10] but God told Elijah move from the cave
[2:18:13] and go stand upon the
[2:18:16] Mountain
[2:18:18] so the ministry of Elijah here is moving
[2:18:22] from a cave Ministry
[2:18:27] everybody okay into a mountain
[2:18:36] that he was praying into it under the
[2:18:39] first pool and the second pool brother
[2:18:41] Bradham had a cave that he was growing
[2:18:44] and praying into it but now the ministry
[2:18:47] is moving from a cave Ministry into a
[2:18:51] mountain Ministry
[2:18:54] everybody okay

[2:19:25] wind did water
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:29] everybody okay everybody okay everybody

[2:21:06] craziness of uh of uh of crazy website
[2:21:10] to attack the message you need to know
[2:21:12] how to fight
[2:21:14] and you need to know where to stand
[2:21:17] it's like brother Branham was making up
[2:21:19] stories
[2:21:21] Ellen are you okay and the great strong
[2:21:24] wind rent the mountain and broken water
[2:21:27] The Rock before the Lord but the Lord

[2:21:46] water earthquake and after the
[2:21:48] earthquake woke up fire a fire

[2:22:33] and went out and stood at the entering
[2:22:37] in the cave and beyond their coming
[2:22:39] voice to him and said what do you hear
[2:22:42] Elijah repeating the same word watch
[2:22:45] Elijah first repeating the same thing
[2:22:47] that he spoke in the cave and he said I
[2:22:50] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[2:22:52] of host because of the children of
[2:22:54] Israel because the children of Israel
[2:22:57] have forsaken your Covenant thrown down
[2:22:59] your altar and slain the prophet with
[2:23:01] the sword and I even I only am left and
[2:23:05] they seek my life to take away
[2:23:08] everybody okay let's stop there
[2:23:11] before I go to the next one
[2:23:13] when God met Elijah the first thing that
[2:23:17] came was what a whirlwind that is what
[2:23:20] went the mountain and from there The
[2:23:23] Rock came up in pieces and it was
[2:23:25] followed by an earthquake and then a
[2:23:27] fire then God spoke
[2:23:29] brother Branham says this in marriage
[2:23:31] and divorce according to what happened
[2:23:34] in sunset Mountain brother Branham say
[2:23:37] and to build record here today of many
[2:23:39] people sitting here that even saw the
[2:23:42] sun where in the mountains in the

[2:24:37] Lord in a whirlwind

[2:24:42] William Branham brother Branham say that
[2:24:46] morning when those seven angels came
[2:24:48] down and did water the Earth
[2:24:52] flew everywhere

[2:25:41] Seven Seals everybody okay the Whirlwind
[2:25:44] and The Rock are renting they're rolling
[2:25:47] down
[2:25:47] brother Branham continues he says
[2:25:50] picking up a of an off or a little
[2:25:53] bald head of my leg like I was there
[2:25:57] star seven Angel broke through from the
[2:26:00] sky and shook the place till what what
[2:26:03] waiting 50 or 60 pounds roll down the
[2:26:07] hill there stood seven Angel there
[2:26:10] commissioned me go back to bring this
[2:26:13] water messages
[2:26:15] so we found that in sunset Mountain The
[2:26:19] Rock warrant they were wound came the
[2:26:22] rock rolled down we need to see the
[2:26:24] earthquake and the fire
[2:26:27] everybody okay
[2:26:28] brother Branham said he told me that I
[2:26:32] will be a Tucson be early in the morning
[2:26:34] I'll be picking up a cocoa bear what we
[2:26:37] call a good header off of my trouser leg
[2:26:40] there is a mystery to that and seven
[2:26:42] angel came and did what and the ground
[2:26:46] did water and everything and rock begin
[2:26:49] to do water and seven angels stood water
[2:26:53] the whole earth did watch
[2:27:01] everybody okay he shook everywhere rock
[2:27:06] that sasted water that's the flying like
[2:27:09] that and I look at standing before me
[2:27:11] stood seven Angel just exactly the way
[2:27:15] it was I felt like I was standing where
[2:27:19] way up off the ground
[2:27:22] hey everybody okay
[2:27:24] we're going slowly we need to see the
[2:27:27] fire then we get to the message
[2:27:31] the other day or about a year ago and
[2:27:35] told you about that message on what time
[2:27:37] is it sir
[2:27:38] and I told you seven angels will meet me
[2:27:41] out there and be the opening of the
[2:27:43] water
[2:27:44] of the seals and there the Life Magazine
[2:27:48] packed the article of it right there
[2:27:50] this great water play
[2:27:57] brother Stephen when I look at that
[2:27:59] picture there it is a cloud
[2:28:03] but brother Branham is calling that a
[2:28:05] flame
[2:28:06] is a cloud the flame
[2:28:09] in the Bible my friend when the pillar
[2:28:13] of fire was leading Israel when he was
[2:28:17] the daytime the pillar of fire will
[2:28:20] change into the cloud
[2:28:23] and when they begin to get dark and
[2:28:26] night that same clad will turn into a
[2:28:30] fire
[2:28:31] so the cloud and the fire are the same
[2:28:34] thing depending on the time of the day
[2:28:38] since the Fulfillment of sunset Mountain
[2:28:41] was during the day that's why the Lord
[2:28:44] took the form of a cloud but that cloud
[2:28:47] is a fire by night if the Lord would
[2:28:50] have come in the night he would have
[2:28:52] been a circle of Fire
[2:28:55] foreign
[2:29:00] everybody clear so what I'm trying to
[2:29:03] draw here is what happened in horrible
[2:29:07] is exactly what happened on Sunset
[2:29:09] Mountain
[2:29:12] everybody okay everybody okay and we
[2:29:15] know that in sunset Mountain as the Lord
[2:29:18] is coming down he's coming himself he's
[2:29:21] doing how many things
[2:29:23] which is the shout the voice of the
[2:29:25] Archangel and the water the problem is
[2:29:28] the sequence of those things
[2:29:31] we okay now let's see the message that
[2:29:35] followed the sons
[2:29:37] The Rock flu the way we shook the Earth
[2:29:40] shook with an earthquake what was the
[2:29:43] message behind
[2:29:44] everybody okay first king 19 verse 15.
[2:29:47] lemon I'm gonna wind up let's follow the
[2:29:50] sequence
[2:29:52] Lord help me now
[2:29:53] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:29:56] verse 15 and the Lord said to him go
[2:30:00] return on your way God is talking to who
[2:30:05] he's talking to who Elijah he's
[2:30:08] commissioning who
[2:30:11] thank you
[2:30:13] God is talking to Elijah he's giving
[2:30:15] Elijah and instruction and a commission
[2:30:18] brother Branham after all this hand The
[2:30:21] Voice came and give him instruction go
[2:30:23] back to Jeffersonville and go preach the
[2:30:25] seventh here because brother Brown I'm
[2:30:27] sorry that he won't preach a new message
[2:30:29] until he goes back in East but he was
[2:30:32] not brother Brandon because the son of
[2:30:34] the dollar son the pyramid is on the on
[2:30:37] the left side and on the right side
[2:30:38] there is an eagle with a scroll open so
[2:30:41] he must preach the seals on the east
[2:30:44] everybody okay everybody okay now let's
[2:30:47] see the message that follow Elijah
[2:30:49] brother Branham say that the Bible says
[2:30:51] this and the Lord said to him go return
[2:30:54] on your way to the Wilderness of
[2:30:56] Damascus and when you come do whatever
[2:31:00] anointed Hazel to be the king of the
[2:31:03] water Syria the first thing they told
[2:31:05] Elijah according to God God told him
[2:31:09] that you Elijah you Elijah not anybody
[2:31:12] else you Elijah you Elijah you are going
[2:31:16] to do something for me everybody okay
[2:31:19] everybody okay
[2:31:21] the first thing you're going to do in my
[2:31:23] message that I have for you today after
[2:31:25] all the sun you must anoint Hazel
[2:31:30] Amen to be a king
[2:31:33] we okay what else do you want to say God
[2:31:38] verse 16
[2:31:40] and jehu the son of nimsha shall you are
[2:31:44] known to be king of the water Israel
[2:31:46] You're Gonna anoint the king of Syria
[2:31:48] everybody okay then you will also anoint
[2:31:52] jihu
[2:31:54] as the king of Israel everybody okay
[2:31:58] everybody okay
[2:31:59] then what else do you have if you notice
[2:32:02] his message also have three pointers
[2:32:05] everybody okay
[2:32:07] first and then you suffer 16 and she who
[2:32:10] the son of nimsha shall you are known to
[2:32:12] be king of Israel and Elsa
[2:32:16] the son of shafat of a bear Hollow shall
[2:32:21] you are known to be prophet in your
[2:32:23] water so there is three tasks that
[2:32:26] Elijah was commissioned
[2:32:28] not the one he must anoint Hazel to be
[2:32:32] the king of Syria number two he must
[2:32:34] anoint jihu to be the king of Israel and
[2:32:38] number three he must anointed to be the
[2:32:41] king of what to take the place of Elijah
[2:32:46] after all the quaking the splitting of
[2:32:49] the rock the the fire and the earthquake
[2:32:53] and everything that happened a message
[2:32:55] came and the message came in three
[2:32:58] points to Elijah
[2:33:01] and when the message came in three-point
[2:33:03] the first point is a larger Master
[2:33:06] anointed Hazel
[2:33:08] Elijah must anoint jihu and Elijah must
[2:33:13] anoint Elisha three anointing has to be
[2:33:17] released
[2:33:18] this message was given in one time
[2:33:24] together
[2:33:25] as a package
[2:33:28] everybody okay
[2:33:30] God didn't speak to Elijah in three days
[2:33:34] God spoke to Elijah at the same day but
[2:33:37] he gave him three points
[2:33:40] anoint this one anoint this one anoint
[2:33:42] this one and God left
[2:33:44] door those three points were given in
[2:33:47] one time in one day but how those dots
[2:33:51] to repent came to pass
[2:33:55] question
[2:33:58] Elijah you know the story went across
[2:34:02] Jordan and he went there and he left his
[2:34:06] mantle and Elisha picked up and he
[2:34:08] picked the double portion so according
[2:34:12] to what we know Elijah fulfilled this
[2:34:15] one
[2:34:17] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:34:20] okay because Elijah and Elisha were
[2:34:23] going together Elijah said I need a
[2:34:25] double portion of your spirit the Cross
[2:34:27] Jordan he left the mantle and then the
[2:34:30] anointing Came Upon Elijah so that was
[2:34:32] fulfilled by who Elijah but God told
[2:34:35] Elijah he must fulfill one two and three
[2:34:39] right the problem is
[2:34:41] do you follow me after Elijah anointed
[2:34:46] Elisha God took a larger home
[2:34:53] everybody okay Elijah left but God said
[2:34:57] it's Elijah who's gonna anoint jihu it's
[2:35:00] Elijah who will anoint Hazel but Elijah
[2:35:03] only Anointed The Lasha and went away
[2:35:07] was the word of God fulfilled yes or no
[2:35:12] who anointed Hazel
[2:35:16] who anointed jihu
[2:35:23] everybody okay when Elijah took his
[2:35:27] anointing and jumped upon Elisha was she
[2:35:31] who there
[2:35:32] was Hazel dead
[2:35:34] they were they anointed at the same time
[2:35:37] in other words the instructions come in
[2:35:40] one time but the Fulfillment have gaps
[2:35:44] [Applause]
[2:35:46] [Music]
[2:35:50] serious
[2:35:51] ly
[2:35:56] let's go to second king
[2:35:58] then I'll Rush quickly to finish
[2:36:01] let's go to second king chapter eight
[2:36:06] ah my my
[2:36:09] amen
[2:36:10] amen
[2:36:12] amen okay Shake somebody's hand and say
[2:36:16] just get prepared
[2:36:18] amen
[2:36:20] glory to God
[2:36:22] second king chapter eight if you dare
[2:36:25] you can say Amen let's go to verse seven
[2:36:27] are you there
[2:36:30] you there
[2:36:31] and Alaska came to Damascus
[2:36:34] not Elijah and Ben Haddad the king of
[2:36:37] Syria was sick and he was told him
[2:36:40] saying the man of God is come here
[2:36:43] and the King
[2:36:45] say to Hazel which was a servant
[2:36:49] amen remember here's the least they want
[2:36:51] to become king do you remember right
[2:36:54] take a present in your hand and go meet
[2:36:57] the man of God and inquire of the Lord
[2:37:00] by him saying shall I cover of shall I
[2:37:03] recover of this disease everybody okay
[2:37:08] and so as I went to meet him and took a
[2:37:11] present with him even every good thing
[2:37:13] of Damascus kill for the camel's burden
[2:37:16] and came and stood before him and say
[2:37:18] your son better than king of Syria has
[2:37:20] sent me to you saying shall I recover of
[2:37:23] this disease and Elisha said to him go
[2:37:26] say to him you may certainly recover
[2:37:29] however the Lord had shown me that he
[2:37:33] shall surely die for the contradiction
[2:37:36] hey everybody okay let me leave that
[2:37:38] alone and he said his countenance
[2:37:41] steadfastly until he was ashamed and the
[2:37:45] man of God wept so the king of Syria has
[2:37:48] a servant by the name of Hazel he took
[2:37:51] his or he said go the man of God is
[2:37:53] there go give him present so he can pray
[2:37:55] for me I want to be healed when the king
[2:37:58] when the servant went there he gives the
[2:38:01] present they give him the message and
[2:38:03] suddenly Elijah begin to look at him
[2:38:07] and he looked at the Hazel he looks so
[2:38:10] much and he began to cry
[2:38:13] everybody okay Hazel data they said why
[2:38:16] is he crying verse uh verse 12.
[2:38:22] and heso say why whip my Lord and he
[2:38:25] answered because I know the evil that
[2:38:28] you will do to the children of Israel
[2:38:30] their stronghold will you set on fire
[2:38:33] and the young man will you say slay with
[2:38:36] the sword and with and will Dash their
[2:38:39] children and whip up their women with
[2:38:41] child and Hazel say but what is your
[2:38:44] servant a dog that he would do such a
[2:38:46] great thing in other words me I will
[2:38:48] stand here
[2:38:49] as a messenger me doing such big things
[2:38:53] and ripping and attacking a nation like
[2:38:55] Israel
[2:38:57] remember the anointing of Elisha is the
[2:39:01] anointing of Elijah
[2:39:04] everybody okay everybody okay and Elisha
[2:39:08] answered the Lord has shown me that you
[2:39:12] shall be king of the waters
[2:39:16] who took the mother of Hazel Elijah or
[2:39:19] Elisha
[2:39:21] after Elijah is already gone
[2:39:24] the remaining of the prophecy is
[2:39:27] fulfilled with Elisha job to verse 15.
[2:39:30] and he came to pass on the moral that he
[2:39:34] took a sickle of Hazel and deep in the
[2:39:36] water and spread it on his face so he
[2:39:39] died and Hazel reign in his water so the
[2:39:44] anointing of Hazel came not by a larger
[2:39:48] who met
[2:39:52] but he came with Elisha who followed the
[2:39:57] message of Elijah
[2:40:01] the Prophet Elijah only fulfilled one
[2:40:04] thing
[2:40:05] but the two other things was not
[2:40:08] fulfilled by Elijah he was fulfilled by
[2:40:12] Elijah that received the anointing of a
[2:40:15] Raja
[2:40:20] brother Branham saying Elisha is a top
[2:40:24] of the church
[2:40:25] [Applause]
[2:40:28] there is three things that is given to
[2:40:31] Elijah but Elijah will only fulfill one
[2:40:35] the remaining of the prophecy will be
[2:40:39] fulfilled in sequence
[2:40:42] not with Elijah but we feel Asha
[2:40:47] what the Lord descended on Saturday he
[2:40:51] met brother Branham alone
[2:40:53] [Music]
[2:40:56] the three things came down
[2:40:58] but only one have to be handled by
[2:41:01] William Mayon pranam the other two must
[2:41:05] be handled by the brother
[2:41:08] slow down
[2:41:11] let's go to chapter nine
[2:41:16] let's go to chapter nine
[2:41:18] we understood now that Elisha was
[2:41:21] anointed by Elijah but Hazel was
[2:41:24] anointed by Elisha not Elijah we need to
[2:41:27] find out jihu who anointed jihu verse 9.
[2:41:32] are you there
[2:41:33] verse one and then last shall the
[2:41:35] prophet called one of the children of
[2:41:37] the prophet and said to him gird up your
[2:41:40] loans and take this box of water
[2:41:42] in your hand the oil came from who
[2:41:48] and when you come there look out there
[2:41:52] for who the son of Jehoshaphat the son
[2:41:55] of nimshi and going and make him Rise Up
[2:41:59] from among his Brethren and carry him to
[2:42:02] an inner chamber then take the box of
[2:42:05] oil the anointing that is coming from
[2:42:07] Elisha and pour it on his head and say
[2:42:11] that says the Lord I have anointed you
[2:42:15] King Of Who
[2:42:18] then open the door and flee and tarry
[2:42:21] who anointed jihu
[2:42:24] Elisha by the son of the prophet
[2:42:31] so when we go back to more horrible if
[2:42:35] you take that prophecy God say Elijah
[2:42:38] you're going to do three things you will
[2:42:40] anoint Elisha you will anoint jehu you
[2:42:43] will anoint Hazel
[2:42:44] but when God begin to fulfill those
[2:42:47] things
[2:42:48] Elijah only does one
[2:42:51] and the remaining Elisha doesn't touch
[2:42:54] them
[2:42:55] it is left to be fulfilled when Elisha
[2:42:59] is no longer on the scene
[2:43:06] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:43:10] okay let me wind up because we have to
[2:43:13] stop brother brought up say three things
[2:43:16] happen and Shout a voice and a water has
[2:43:20] to have happened before Jesus water
[2:43:22] peace Jesus does water all three of them
[2:43:26] when he's water descending a shout what
[2:43:29] is a shout it's not the water going
[2:43:31] forth first the living bread of life
[2:43:33] bringing forth water and God has a way
[2:43:37] of doing things
[2:43:45] everything happened where are they dead
[2:43:48] in Christ
[2:43:51] [Applause]
[2:43:53] where is Paul
[2:43:54] where is Peter yeah where is Columbus
[2:43:57] where is Martin Luther they are still
[2:44:00] not awake
[2:44:01] because when something happened there is
[2:44:04] a sequence that goes with a gap
[2:44:09] he never changed he's he's an unchanging
[2:44:12] God in Amos 3 verse 7 he said he will do
[2:44:16] water nothing on the earth until he
[2:44:19] first revealed his servant water and
[2:44:21] just as certain as he promised he shall
[2:44:23] water do it brother Branham said there
[2:44:26] are three things
[2:44:27] amen number one there is a shout and
[2:44:31] then there is a voice and there is a
[2:44:33] water and notice that while the problem
[2:44:35] say what is a shout he explained the
[2:44:38] water he said he said the shot is there
[2:44:41] message and when brother Branham speak
[2:44:44] about the shot being the message he does
[2:44:47] not explain the voice of the archangel
[2:44:51] he opened Amos 3.
[2:44:55] to tell you that that shout is a message
[2:44:59] and the message is to gather the bread
[2:45:02] before we move to the voice of the
[2:45:05] archangel
[2:45:06] we must first push our break they gotta
[2:45:09] be a prophet
[2:45:12] because Jesus said when the son of man
[2:45:14] will come shall he find Faith how can
[2:45:18] you bring Jesus if the people don't have
[2:45:20] faith yet
[2:45:23] that's why brother Bradham said when the
[2:45:25] seals are water and the Mystery is how
[2:45:28] we feel down came water the angel the
[2:45:31] water oh Christ crushed us water angel
[2:45:36] setting his foot on the land and upon
[2:45:38] the sea with a water remember now
[2:45:41] remember these seven Angel is on water
[2:45:44] on the time of water the coming of Jesus
[2:45:48] Christ as a nature
[2:45:52] because if Jesus Come In the Flesh he's
[2:45:55] gonna bring death
[2:46:03] everybody okay why is this Gap important
[2:46:07] why is the gap important let's close
[2:46:10] here Matthew 25.
[2:46:14] and that's it
[2:46:17] oh God
[2:46:20] foreign
[2:46:24] let's close here
[2:46:26] Matthew 25
[2:46:28] I can get deep to this
[2:46:30] if you dare you can say man
[2:46:33] you there first one and then shall the
[2:46:36] Kingdom of Heaven be like an unto ten
[2:46:39] virgin which took the lamps and went
[2:46:42] forth to meet the water
[2:46:45] these were virgin
[2:46:48] they were selected
[2:46:50] they also have lamp they had three
[2:46:53] things
[2:46:55] but let me leave it because of the time
[2:46:58] job to verse I have to skip all of this
[2:47:01] because of the time let me make my point
[2:47:03] here job to verse uh
[2:47:07] five because if I open this it's
[2:47:09] something else it's a different layer
[2:47:11] first of all what the blood groom Theory
[2:47:14] they're all slumbered and did what sleep
[2:47:18] at a midnight
[2:47:20] there was a cry made below the
[2:47:23] bridegroom comes
[2:47:26] meet him
[2:47:28] but if you notice the blood group never
[2:47:30] came
[2:47:34] everybody okay job now
[2:47:38] job now to verse 10. and while they went
[2:47:42] to buy
[2:47:43] they brought them did what came
[2:47:46] but I thought the bridegroom already was
[2:47:48] coming
[2:47:49] so between the coming of the bridegroom
[2:47:52] that is detected by the messenger and
[2:47:57] the coming of the bridegroom that will
[2:47:59] meet the Virgin there is a period of
[2:48:02] time
[2:48:05] and that period of time is a period of
[2:48:08] time that was given as a grace period
[2:48:13] so that the Virgin can wake up and clean
[2:48:17] up the lamp and prepare themselves and
[2:48:20] make sure everything is in order
[2:48:24] before the bridegroom comes
[2:48:27] [Applause]
[2:48:28] everybody okay so the gaps that we are
[2:48:32] talking here before are between the
[2:48:35] shout and the resurrection it is a grace
[2:48:38] period
[2:48:40] and that grace period is always a
[2:48:43] trumpet
[2:48:45] of Jubilee that is blown as a mercy of
[2:48:50] God
[2:48:51] to awaken to gather the bride
[2:48:54] from everywhere in other words God gave
[2:48:59] you a Grace by putting a Watchman
[2:49:03] is a messenger there
[2:49:05] because sometimes you might wait too
[2:49:09] long
[2:49:10] I won't touch it because the timing of
[2:49:14] the bridegroom will change
[2:49:17] the bride group never came in the time
[2:49:19] they were waiting
[2:49:21] I won't touch it today let me leave it
[2:49:24] alone I won't touch it today I know what
[2:49:26] it is everybody okay there was a timing
[2:49:29] that the bridegroom have to come that's
[2:49:31] why the foolish virgin didn't need the
[2:49:33] oil they knew that what they have will
[2:49:36] meet that coming
[2:49:37] [Music]
[2:49:39] but the Bible said the blood group
[2:49:41] Theory in other words Jesus will come
[2:49:44] more than the correct time he should
[2:49:47] come I will leave it alone let me leave
[2:49:49] it alone here everybody okay
[2:49:52] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:49:56] okay so if you see laodicea lingering
[2:49:59] you need to be careful
[2:50:00] [Music]
[2:50:01] you need to be careful
[2:50:05] I don't know if you're getting what I'm
[2:50:07] saying
[2:50:11] let me say yes and then we stop
[2:50:14] when the Virgin were going to meet the
[2:50:18] bridegroom Jesus Christ the bridegroom
[2:50:21] was coming on a specific day
[2:50:24] in a specific place and on a specific
[2:50:27] time
[2:50:29] everybody okay and based on the
[2:50:32] information that was given the foolish
[2:50:35] virgin
[2:50:37] everybody okay didn't see the importance
[2:50:41] of the second oil
[2:50:46] everybody okay
[2:50:49] let me wind up quick
[2:50:51] because somebody's trying to pull so
[2:50:53] hard
[2:50:55] every virgin was now one they were
[2:50:58] virgin
[2:50:59] number two they were all chose all
[2:51:01] called
[2:51:03] amen and number three they all have lamp
[2:51:07] and in those lamp there was oil
[2:51:10] hey everybody okay so there was enough a
[2:51:14] measure of the holy spirit that was
[2:51:17] working already and they thought what
[2:51:20] the heck was a nurse
[2:51:22] [Applause]
[2:51:23] tell me
[2:51:26] yes sir hey everybody okay everybody
[2:51:29] okay according to the timing of the
[2:51:32] bridegroom the oil that they have they
[2:51:35] found out that we don't need an extra
[2:51:42] if we can get to the people that are
[2:51:44] saved
[2:51:45] that's good enough
[2:51:48] everybody okay so because of the timing
[2:51:52] they look at the lamp and if you notice
[2:51:55] do you take the lamp during the day
[2:51:57] so the Virgin were going at which time
[2:52:02] evening time because that's when you
[2:52:04] need the light amen so if you look at
[2:52:08] the light all of them qualify virgin see
[2:52:11] all of them qualify called all of them
[2:52:14] clarify now the less qualification was
[2:52:17] whether you carry the second oil or not
[2:52:20] [Applause]
[2:52:20] [Music]
[2:52:25] everybody okay everybody okay but
[2:52:29] according to that time that they have to
[2:52:32] meet the bridegroom the bridegroom never
[2:52:35] came in that time
[2:52:38] man
[2:52:41] let me now open this up since you wanted
[2:52:44] to open it everybody okay the bridegroom
[2:52:48] came at midnight
[2:52:50] it was no longer the day that they were
[2:52:54] supposed to meet him
[2:52:56] he was another day
[2:53:01] everybody okay everybody okay so Jesus
[2:53:04] will not come at the day that human
[2:53:09] being has been given in description
[2:53:11] [Applause]
[2:53:17] everybody okay everybody okay whatever
[2:53:20] they give you in the church ages
[2:53:23] it's the landmark if you are calibrating
[2:53:26] that the Lord will link it
[2:53:29] [Applause]
[2:53:33] everybody okay
[2:53:35] he will go a little bit
[2:53:37] of a timer
[2:53:42] and the reason for going through the
[2:53:45] overtime is to make the fish oil run out
[2:53:49] [Music]
[2:53:52] so those who despise the second one
[2:53:58] amen will find out they are missing the
[2:54:02] bridegroom
[2:54:05] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:54:09] okay everybody okay
[2:54:12] everybody okay because if the bridegroom
[2:54:15] would have come even the Virgin would be
[2:54:18] lost because all of them were lost but
[2:54:21] God allowed a gap
[2:54:25] he give a period of Grace
[2:54:28] he sent somebody that he put there and
[2:54:32] tell that person when I'm getting closer
[2:54:35] I love the bride so that they can get
[2:54:38] ready because I don't want to find them
[2:54:41] not being ready
[2:54:43] so they shout when he comes when the
[2:54:47] shout is coming the shout doesn't go
[2:54:50] quickly to the resurrection the shot
[2:54:53] will open a period of Grace
[2:54:55] for you to be able to fix yourself to
[2:55:00] correct your life to make yourself ready
[2:55:02] before the bridegroom comes and meet you
[2:55:05] because when the bridegroom comes the
[2:55:08] bride will make herself
[2:55:12] who made you ready because God put a
[2:55:15] Watchman
[2:55:16] God put an alarming sound there
[2:55:19] amen because if Jesus would have come
[2:55:22] and the dead of Saint risen they will
[2:55:24] find you in a nightclub
[2:55:28] everybody okay and you will miss the
[2:55:29] Rapture but the shout is coming the
[2:55:32] shout is the brother
[2:55:34] because the shout is the message the
[2:55:36] message is your mercy seat the message
[2:55:39] is your blood the messages the giving
[2:55:43] time that God is giving us today to make
[2:55:47] sure we correct everything we prepare
[2:55:50] ourselves before he showed up
[2:55:55] but remember the whole package is
[2:55:57] already released
[2:55:58] if you tell it too long it's gonna pick
[2:56:02] the voice of the archangel
[2:56:04] and when you begin Tuesday to see the
[2:56:06] scent of God begin to rise up just know
[2:56:09] that you miss it
[2:56:11] because it's too late
[2:56:14] so before you see brother Branham one
[2:56:16] day
[2:56:18] you need to correct your life
[2:56:22] let's stop here let's stand
[2:56:27] the voice of the archangel and the Trump
[2:56:29] of God
[2:56:31] you go home
[2:56:32] and review this slowly
[2:56:38] I know we have to approach it slowly
[2:56:42] because of the confusion
[2:56:44] over the years in the message
[2:56:49] that's why he preacher in this message
[2:56:51] preaching that they are in the
[2:56:52] millennium
[2:56:55] I heard it
[2:56:57] they are preaching they are in the
[2:56:58] millennium
[2:57:00] and I don't have any problem if they
[2:57:02] come to me I would take them to the zoo
[2:57:06] and put them where the lion is
[2:57:12] and see whether they are in the
[2:57:14] Millennium or not
[2:57:17] everybody okay why are we preaching
[2:57:20] things like this
[2:57:21] because you never understood the
[2:57:23] sequence of the scripture
[2:57:25] the shout came behold the bridegroom
[2:57:28] cometh yes but where is the bad gum no
[2:57:30] trim your lamp
[2:57:33] the midnight shout is streaming left it
[2:57:35] is a signal fix yourself fix yourself
[2:57:38] quickly fix yourself quickly because
[2:57:41] Jesus is coming he will not appear unto
[2:57:44] you until the three things are done
[2:57:47] when the last thing is done then you're
[2:57:50] gonna see your maker but you won't meet
[2:57:52] him here you're gonna meet him in the
[2:57:54] sky and the Trump of God will pick you
[2:57:56] up to pull you up there but between all
[2:57:59] of these things we got gap between the
[2:58:02] shot and the resurrection there is a
[2:58:04] Ministry between the resurrection and
[2:58:07] the meeting of the Lord in the sky there
[2:58:09] is also a gap
[2:58:12] if you put them together
[2:58:15] you're going to be confused because our
[2:58:18] loved one are still standing there
[2:58:21] let's pray
[2:58:24] this message
[2:58:26] is not another religion
[2:58:29] this message is not a cult
[2:58:32] this message is not about you were born
[2:58:35] in it
[2:58:37] and this is the religion that you know
[2:58:39] from your father your mother this is
[2:58:41] what you do
[2:58:42] this is not it if you will have that
[2:58:45] conception you are missing yourself and
[2:58:48] you're going to find yourself left here
[2:58:50] while the remaining of the church is
[2:58:53] gone
[2:58:54] this message is an alert
[2:58:58] this message
[2:58:59] is a period of Grace yes this message is
[2:59:03] God
[2:59:04] in his who is rich in Mercy
[2:59:08] that I have sent you something a signal
[2:59:12] to prepare you
[2:59:14] this message is God who have put hege
[2:59:17] to make sure he give you all the
[2:59:19] instruction so that you don't miss the
[2:59:22] test
[2:59:23] so that you cannot miss going into the
[2:59:26] rapture
[2:59:27] but what we have to do we have to
[2:59:29] surrender we have too much of ourselves
[2:59:34] amen
[2:59:35] for never something that God tells you
[2:59:39] to do you don't do it it means your
[2:59:41] opinion is still above the word of God
[2:59:46] if God shows you something
[2:59:49] in this church or maybe you're listening
[2:59:51] to a tape or maybe you're listening to a
[2:59:54] preacher and God unfold to you that stop
[2:59:56] doing this this is wrong if you continue
[2:59:59] to do that it is telling God you are
[3:00:02] taking your will above his will
[3:00:05] you know what you're doing that you know
[3:00:07] you're not supposed to be doing
[3:00:09] you know what you're doing that you're
[3:00:11] giving every reason you can give to
[3:00:14] prove that I cannot do this yet you know
[3:00:17] it's the things of God
[3:00:19] amen
[3:00:20] the time of Mercy is going into overtime
[3:00:24] amen before you begin to see the dead in
[3:00:27] Christ Rising
[3:00:29] please
[3:00:30] check your life
[3:00:32] you don't want to stay in this earth
[3:00:35] because of a skirt
[3:00:37] you don't want to stay here
[3:00:39] because of your job you don't want to
[3:00:41] stay here because of a shoe a
[3:00:43] high-heeled shoe you don't want to stay
[3:00:45] here because of your opinion you don't
[3:00:48] want to stay here because of a makeup or
[3:00:50] an earringer
[3:00:53] you don't value your soul
[3:00:56] you don't want to stay here because you
[3:00:58] want to please everybody you want to be
[3:01:00] to every party you want to be to
[3:01:02] everything and the last thing you have
[3:01:03] to do is to be in church
[3:01:06] you are in church when all your agenda
[3:01:08] are fulfilling there is nothing to do
[3:01:10] that's when you go to church if there is
[3:01:12] one thing you drop church you go do it
[3:01:14] if there is something you drop church
[3:01:16] you do it if they call you on the cell
