[33:32] slowly and you read
[33:34] line by line you're gonna see things
[33:37] differently than the way things were
[33:41] portrayed
[33:42] but we thank god for his grace bringing
[33:44] these things into more clarity
[33:47] now you understand what is the designing
[33:49] from the devil

[34:01] that's the teaching he put on here amen
[34:04] so the eve at the creation was not the
[34:07] eve

[34:10] different eve that was an
[34:12] eve that was now designed by
[34:15] the devil amen abraham never wanted to

[39:55] in revelations 2 and 20 and once you
[39:58] have it you can say amen
[40:03] okay it says notwithstanding
[40:06] i have a few things against thee because
[40:10] they suffered that woman jezebel which
[40:13] called of herself a prophetess
[40:16] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[40:18] commit
[40:19] fornication and to eat things
[40:22] sacrificed unto idols and let's go to
[40:26] ephesians chapter six
[40:30] and then you may be seated after this
[40:31] scripture
[40:34] he says and we'll go to verse 10 we'll
[40:38] start at verse 10.
[40:40] finally my brother be strong in the lord
[40:43] and in the power of his might put on the
[40:46] whole armor of god
[40:48] that ye may be able to stand against the
[40:50] wiles of the devil
[40:51] remember now we're talking about our
[40:53] topic tonight
[40:54] is is going to be us uh um it's going to
[40:58] in influence but it's going to be
[41:01] enticing spirits okay but
[41:04] but as we're going to country so you be
[41:06] prayerful with us because you're in
[41:08] there because it's all going to tie
[41:10] together
[41:10] by the grace of god we're going to let
[41:12] him just tie it together and have his
[41:14] way
[41:14] verse 12 he says for we wrestle not
[41:17] against flesh and blood
[41:19] but against principalities against
[41:21] powers
[41:22] against the rulers of darkness of this
[41:25] world against spiritual wickedness in
[41:27] high places
[41:28] may the lord add a blessing to the
[41:30] reading of his word you may be seated
[41:35] yeah we're here by the grace of god we
[41:38] thank him for his grace and his mercy we
[41:40] didn't
[41:41] really know the direction it was a lot
[41:44] of thoughts coming through
[41:45] but then i had an opportunity to listen
[41:48] to the
[41:49] message there on sunday and i'll tell
[41:51] you it was really
[41:52] rich it was a confirmation because when
[41:55] i was up about five that morning
[41:57] i was telling brother um steve i was
[41:59] just
[42:00] i got stuck there on on subtle
[42:03] that's subtle it worked subtle and i
[42:05] just looked at it you know they always
[42:07] talked about subtle
[42:08] but something what what struck me was
[42:10] you know that devil he's smart
[42:12] too he's smart you know so the only
[42:16] thing that you see only thing that's
[42:18] going to
[42:19] overpower him in his kingdom is ye
[42:22] having the baptism of the holy ghost the
[42:25] spirit of god
[42:26] in your life you've got to have it so
[42:28] there's no reason for us to live
[42:30] okay moping around living not a
[42:33] victorious life
[42:35] is that right everything that god has
[42:37] given us
[42:38] in this hour here now so we don't want
[42:40] to get ahead of ourselves
[42:43] but we want to what you want to look at
[42:45] let me pull these out here
[42:47] god help me
[42:52] okay here's the one
[42:55] i want to start with because we got a
[42:59] lot and i want to
[43:01] just get through as much as we can if
[43:04] not i'm going to just stop where he tell
[43:06] me to stop at
[43:07] okay influence
[43:10] we here talking about
[43:14] look at enticing enticing is something
[43:17] it's attractive or tempting okay
[43:21] an attack of attempted and just bear
[43:24] with me because brother branham worked
[43:25] there but we know with influence he went
[43:27] over
[43:28] to uh second chronicles and and he was
[43:31] over in 26 but we're going another way
[43:33] we want to
[43:33] look at this the spiritual aspects of it
[43:36] i believe the holy spirit have told
[43:38] us sunday morning he identified to us
[43:41] way back to how the devil attacks and
[43:44] his tactics is that right
[43:45] so we're going to read some things that
[43:47] brother branham claiming he's telling us
[43:49] his people don't really know how to
[43:51] fight these devils
[43:52] and how these devils that's down in
[43:55] their soul
[43:55] is that right so we're not talking about
[43:58] demons in the spirit
[43:59] we're talking about demons in your soul
[44:01] tonight you know when he preached the
[44:03] message of
[44:04] the holy ghost what is the holy ghost
[44:07] and why was it giving for
[44:08] and how do you know that you have it he
[44:11] said that was a
[44:12] soulful meeting is that right so when we
[44:15] read we got a lot of reason to do
[44:16] tonight so be prayerful with me but i'm
[44:18] not going to take you past the time
[44:20] is that right we're going to be mindful
[44:22] you know brother steve
[44:23] when you go into the conducting order
[44:25] you love your conduct in order
[44:27] those that haven't see you're going to
[44:28] find out some of the things in there
[44:31] we're doing it maybe brother branham
[44:34] didn't agree but he still saw the grace
[44:37] it has to be grace that was given him is
[44:39] that right
[44:40] he said he know that the message just
[44:42] shouldn't have been longer than a
[44:44] certain period of time
[44:45] but he have a message to get out is that
[44:48] right
[44:48] so that's why you hear me say don't put
[44:51] the pressure on your pastor
[44:53] when he's up there because i'm gonna
[44:55] read some things tonight see we're gonna
[44:57] ambush the devil tonight
[44:58] he's in trouble tonight there's some
[45:01] people in condition
[45:02] and they don't want to be that way but
[45:04] the word in the beginning was the word
[45:06] the word was god the word was with god
[45:09] and the word was made flesh is that
[45:10] right
[45:11] so it will defeat the devil anywhere or
[45:13] any place at any time
[45:18] they're the enticing in these spirits
[45:23] and god help me we looked at these now
[45:26] we know the devil
[45:28] we're talking about the the demons of
[45:30] doctrine
[45:32] the demons of doctrine we know
[45:35] doctrine is the teachings it's the
[45:38] teachings
[45:39] so you're wondering why you want to go
[45:41] home if you're ready to go home and get
[45:44] out of here
[45:45] the holy spirit showed us that first we
[45:47] was in the mind of god is that right
[45:50] we was in the mind of god before the
[45:52] foundation of the world
[45:54] and when he spoke us now out there let
[45:56] there be light is that right
[45:58] the logo he said it went out and when it
[46:01] went on out there
[46:02] and after when i've been the lord
[46:04] brought his people and they sent
[46:05] adam and eve's sin is that right the
[46:08] lord showed us that they're
[46:09] sunday so what we're doing they teach
[46:12] brought us
[46:13] and then we needed a redeemer is that
[46:15] right we needed the kinsmen redeemer to
[46:17] redeem us back
[46:19] so now we're walking we don't want to
[46:21] rush tonight
[46:22] i want to take the time because i said
[46:24] lord even if i have to come back
[46:26] i said brother steve i want to i have to
[46:28] come back because i believe
[46:30] that the lord has something for all of
[46:33] us it's something that was hidden
[46:35] down in there and when brother steve was
[46:37] saying that you have to catch it and see
[46:39] why
[46:40] when he said slow down and when you slow
[46:43] down and you study in this message
[46:45] and once you pray and you invite him
[46:48] in once you invite him in in that
[46:52] presence
[46:52] he's obligated to meet you there because
[46:55] you met his conditions is that right
[46:58] the last time that we were here we were
[47:01] saying
[47:01] we were talking about that mental
[47:03] attitude is that right
[47:04] but we said everything was based upon
[47:06] the conditions
[47:07] i don't want to get ahead of myself
[47:09] because we want you to realize
[47:11] you are the bride of jesus christ son
[47:15] god did not hide this from you
[47:18] god hid this for you he waited and he
[47:21] saved
[47:22] the best for last stop huh we're in a
[47:25] war but we got the victory
[47:27] is that right you got some battle scars
[47:30] down in your soul
[47:32] but god come to shut your feet tonight
[47:36] hallelujah
[47:40] look what it says doctrine
[47:44] the demons of doctrine see the nature of
[47:47] these
[47:48] demons that we're talking about they're
[47:50] intelligent and they're wise
[47:52] they're powerful and then bond is
[47:54] spirits
[47:55] they're not angels they're not humans
[47:58] they look
[47:58] to get in a body that's what they're
[48:01] looking to do
[48:02] they want to dwell in a place is that
[48:04] right satan has an
[48:05] organized army but we're going to expose
[48:08] some things on him tonight
[48:09] how he's been troubling some people
[48:11] making you think
[48:12] that this is something some doctor i
[48:15] mean some kind of trees or dogma
[48:18] this is not a tree or dogma this is the
[48:21] word that's being
[48:22] straightened up that had been messed
[48:24] that satan
[48:26] satan deformed but god sent a word to
[48:29] transform
[48:30] bring you back but it had to be restored
[48:33] and it has to be restored
[48:34] back to the original world is that right
[48:37] [Music]
[48:40] hallelujah help me lord
[48:44] he said now look enticing
[48:48] doctrines of devils he says here in the
[48:51] message 7
[48:53] 24 he says where brother branham
[48:56] he was saying here now may the lord have
[48:59] a blessing to his word is the reading
[49:01] he said we'll call it enticing spirits
[49:03] or the word of god
[49:06] we're going to drop down he said now
[49:07] knowing he says
[49:09] i want to speak on enticing spirits
[49:13] which would be really titled the
[49:16] demonology
[49:17] so we're really you're dealing with
[49:19] satan's kingdom
[49:20] you know so you have to understand now
[49:23] it's going to go a little
[49:24] deeper than when we first started when
[49:27] he first started in this ministry
[49:29] because this is laodicea i can't go
[49:32] through all those we're going to do that
[49:33] and later we're going to go through that
[49:34] later but we want to see you show you
[49:38] that that teaching has to be tore down
[49:41] that old teaching has to be torn down
[49:44] because it was an influence in every age
[49:49] it was an influence hallelujah
[49:53] he said now look he says you hear so
[49:56] much about demons
[49:58] of these days but you hear so little
[50:00] about
[50:01] how to get rid of them ah
[50:07] he said what did he say he said it has
[50:10] so much
[50:11] how to get rid of it he says we are well
[50:13] aware
[50:14] that devils but the next thing is how to
[50:17] get rid of that thing
[50:18] he said having by the grace of god much
[50:22] opportunity to deal with these things
[50:24] called demons he says they're meeting
[50:26] them at the platform
[50:28] excuse me and in a daily walk and why i
[50:31] like to look
[50:32] into the scripture this morning and find
[50:35] out where this evening
[50:36] and find out just those things what they
[50:38] are
[50:40] now look we know that he talked about
[50:42] for the
[50:43] the demons in the flesh is that right
[50:46] the atomic the demons in the flesh which
[50:49] we know is cancer tuberculosis
[50:51] and all these things but when that
[50:53] cancer
[50:54] or when it pops up on you or not
[50:57] that what you're not looking at is the
[50:59] knot
[51:00] what you're after is the life that's
[51:03] inside of there
[51:05] it's the life that's inside of that then
[51:07] that knot
[51:08] so what we have to understand that
[51:10] somewhere
[51:11] along the line unless a man is born
[51:14] again
[51:15] you're going to trouble with something
[51:17] that one of your parents
[51:19] trouble with in that flesh and that
[51:21] natural is that right
[51:23] so you have to understand so that's why
[51:25] you know
[51:26] our parents when we grew up they didn't
[51:28] have what we have
[51:29] they used to look at and say oh boy
[51:31] could acting like your daddy
[51:34] you know when they wasn't living right
[51:35] or something you know because what they
[51:37] was recognizing
[51:39] the behavior that was there is that
[51:41] right
[51:42] they was recognizing the spirit and the
[51:44] holy ghost said
[51:45] faith come by hearing hearing the word
[51:48] of god is that right but he also said
[51:51] you know each and every one of us has
[51:53] the spirit of discernment
[51:55] you could discern what's right and you
[51:57] can discern what's wrong
[51:59] is that right now once you get the holy
[52:02] ghost
[52:02] come inside of you you are going to be
[52:05] able to be discerned
[52:06] if the word is of the if if it's the
[52:09] word of god
[52:10] for your hour is that right hallelujah
[52:15] he said now look he says this
[52:19] he said that's in the physical form now
[52:21] we're getting ready to jump down to the
[52:23] spiritual form
[52:24] he said now this morning we're going to
[52:27] talk about
[52:28] demons in the spiritual form in the soul
[52:31] and this is what is evening he says
[52:34] they're in the soul
[52:35] the same as they're in the body he says
[52:38] and and we are bound to admit that we
[52:41] see them
[52:42] in people's bodies such as cancer and
[52:44] different diseases
[52:46] within the human bodies he says just
[52:49] reached
[52:49] and said now but now
[52:53] cancer in the body or cancer in the soul
[52:56] the demon can come in either place now
[52:59] there's many
[53:00] times and many peoples who who have good
[53:03] thoughts now you catch them here they
[53:06] got good
[53:12] thoughts
[53:14] he said help me good thoughts and good
[53:17] people who tried many times
[53:20] rest upon some little theology see some
[53:23] little theology
[53:25] some wrong teachings something that
[53:29] couldn't move the devil
[53:30] some organizational teachings that's why
[53:34] the ministry here
[53:35] is not telling you not to stay away from

[59:45] we got another part of the line whether
[59:47] they brother steve when you slow down

[59:52] to you hallelujah
[59:55] look what we got here the religious
[59:57] devils
[59:58] they get around the doctrines of devils
[1:00:00] so when you come in there
[1:00:02] let me read it
[1:00:05] look what he says he says now if i could
[1:00:08] just quit lusting
[1:00:10] if i could just only quit this he said
[1:00:14] that's the devil
[1:00:15] and now they come in the form of
[1:00:18] religion
[1:00:19] many times now they come in the form of
[1:00:23] religion
[1:00:23] many times now you see see
[1:00:27] it was a mixed multitude came out of
[1:00:29] here
[1:00:31] the lord came and showed us
[1:00:35] about a certain office having a right
[1:00:39] he's got that book isn't that right
[1:00:42] here's the other right
[1:00:44] when paul was saying that it was not by
[1:00:46] the commandment
[1:00:47] when he was talking about the marriage
[1:00:49] and he was talking about a young man
[1:00:51] getting married
[1:00:52] he said but it's rather for him to get
[1:00:54] married and burn but what he was saying
[1:00:56] because
[1:00:57] god gave me the permission
[1:01:01] because of his position you say right
[1:01:04] brother polycarp
[1:01:05] you might be out of place but we're
[1:01:08] never out of position
[1:01:09] you're always a son and a daughter of
[1:01:12] god no matter what you struggling with
[1:01:14] no matter what you're dealing with no
[1:01:16] matter what you're going through no
[1:01:18] matter what the devil accuses you
[1:01:20] you're never out of position
[1:01:26] look what he'd tell him he'd come around
[1:01:29] in there
[1:01:30] see he knew that he could get that grace
[1:01:32] so when he came there
[1:01:34] he knew about his position so when it
[1:01:37] came you got to realize you don't want
[1:01:39] to come with an intellectual
[1:01:40] a conception moving up in here if you go
[1:01:43] back and you have to realize that the
[1:01:45] lord says
[1:01:46] christ and god is what what
[1:01:49] is that right when christ and god is one
[1:01:53] he says now then the pastor of the age
[1:01:58] it has to be the one that brings the
[1:02:00] message of the age
[1:02:02] so he is round in this hour here now
[1:02:06] we've got a message that has tied up
[1:02:10] all the loose ends that can tear down
[1:02:12] any
[1:02:13] doctrine any false teaching any
[1:02:16] antichrist spirit
[1:02:18] is that right so then he's the pastor
[1:02:22] is that right of the age if it's a grace
[1:02:26] this is the age of grace and god has put
[1:02:29] it in you
[1:02:30] god has put it in me is that right now
[1:02:33] when the
[1:02:34] prophet of god he knew if he would have
[1:02:37] stuck to the letter of the word
[1:02:40] i'm trying to help you brother i'm
[1:02:41] trying to keep it slow if he held me by
[1:02:43] the letter
[1:02:44] of the word then they were to torch some
[1:02:47] families up it would have tore
[1:02:48] homes up it was torn up but he went
[1:02:51] and did what he went and prayed
[1:02:55] he went and got with god he needed a
[1:02:58] answer
[1:02:58] for his people the pastor of the age is
[1:03:02] that right
[1:03:03] what did he tell us a pardon is not
[1:03:06] a pun unless you accept that
[1:03:10] is that right he went and got grace
[1:03:13] for his children he went up there
[1:03:16] and he says now be on your way
[1:03:20] and do what the lord doubt
[1:03:23] no more what are you doubting about this
[1:03:26] day and time
[1:03:27] huh oh death where's thy sting oh grave
[1:03:31] where is thy victory
[1:03:32] glory be to god is that right keep your
[1:03:36] mind on the blood now
[1:03:37] keep your mind on calvary what can wash
[1:03:40] away my sins
[1:03:41] nothing but the blood of jesus what can
[1:03:44] make me whole again
[1:03:46] nothing but the blood of jesus and the
[1:03:48] blood today
[1:03:50] is the baptism of the holy ghost down in
[1:03:52] your soul
[1:03:55] hallelujah let me keep reading
[1:03:58] help me lord he said now look
[1:04:02] he says there is a religion he said now
[1:04:04] in the scripture
[1:04:06] once there was a man by the name of
[1:04:08] jehoshaphat
[1:04:10] a great man he was a religious man and
[1:04:13] he went over to
[1:04:14] another king which was the king of
[1:04:16] israel
[1:04:17] and jehoshaphat being the king of judah
[1:04:20] and he went down to ahab the king of
[1:04:23] israel
[1:04:23] and they got all buckled up together
[1:04:26] and made an alliance with one another to
[1:04:29] go
[1:04:30] to fight at guild get raymath gilead
[1:04:34] and they did it without
[1:04:37] praying first
[1:04:42] you had to meet the condition at the
[1:04:46] time
[1:04:47] and the condition it was a prophet in
[1:04:49] the land
[1:04:50] and with the prophet in the land they
[1:04:53] should have went
[1:04:53] and prayed and they would pray god would
[1:04:57] have sent
[1:04:57] him to the right man is that right joe
[1:05:00] hasselfactor
[1:05:01] my wife and i we were in a place a
[1:05:03] couple of weeks ago
[1:05:04] and it was a sister she came out and
[1:05:07] when she came
[1:05:08] and she she's in still in the message
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:11] she still have her family in the message
[1:05:14] and we just asked we hadn't seen her in
[1:05:16] a while
[1:05:16] and she's the lord that brought us to
[1:05:18] her heart we were riding down the road
[1:05:20] and we got to the church she was there
[1:05:22] and my wife was asking her
[1:05:24] you know how's she doing she said such
[1:05:27] and such you know since she left from
[1:05:28] over the church that she was at
[1:05:30] but she says well i called someone so
[1:05:33] you know she's still my friend
[1:05:35] so you know you look at those things i
[1:05:38] thought about
[1:05:39] jehoshaphat and ahab ahab was a
[1:05:42] make-believer
[1:05:44] is that right now you're seeing through
[1:05:46] the scripture what the holy ghost is
[1:05:48] giving the pastor like how can
[1:05:51] unless you can't possibly walk together
[1:05:54] unless you agree that's bible
[1:05:57] the word cannot offend the word if you
[1:06:00] get off the wall
[1:06:02] now you're going to move on the ground
[1:06:04] for the devil is that right
[1:06:06] she says she's going over there with him
[1:06:09] going over and visit them she's calling
[1:06:11] her
[1:06:12] i thought about that what the holy ghost
[1:06:14] said yeah how many times do they come to
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:17] huh they're not coming to you is that
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:21] yeah and i don't come over there you
[1:06:24] keep talking about jesus
[1:06:26] you keep telling them about jesus you
[1:06:28] keep telling them about the goodness of
[1:06:30] jesus
[1:06:31] you tell them about the message for the
[1:06:32] hour is that right
[1:06:34] you're getting the word of the prophet
[1:06:36] wisdom comes from god
[1:06:38] one day we're going to get in a series
[1:06:39] and show you about that wisdom
[1:06:41] christ is the wisdom of god but it's a
[1:06:43] lot of channels to that
[1:06:45] to christ you know a lot of channels
[1:06:47] that you can go through there
[1:06:48] and so god will teach you these things
[1:06:50] is that right
[1:06:52] that's why he's saying with faith virtue
[1:06:55] what knowledge is that right i remember
[1:06:58] when the holy ghost stopped me right
[1:06:59] there in knowledge he said
[1:07:01] you can't go no further he said you got
[1:07:03] to have
[1:07:04] wisdom and understanding to handle the
[1:07:06] knowledge that i'm giving you

[1:07:24] question something then you're doubting
[1:07:26] about it
[1:07:27] just don't do it just don't even do it
[1:07:30] don't even thinking about do it
[1:07:32] he said now look he said because you get
[1:07:35] he said i'm positive sure if
[1:07:38] men and women could only get into the
[1:07:41] position
[1:07:42] of where their soul their thinking
[1:07:46] their attitudes he said we'll be perfect
[1:07:49] in the sight of god he said that would
[1:07:52] be
[1:07:53] one of the most powerful churches that
[1:07:56] ever
[1:07:56] exist
[1:08:00] when the holy ghost when the prophet of
[1:08:03] god
[1:08:04] has instructed us to come in early
[1:08:08] about 30 minutes and get reverence
[1:08:12] and pray and get yourself set in your
[1:08:16] position
[1:08:17] we understand situations occur
[1:08:20] but you're only cutting yourself short
[1:08:22] is that right

[1:08:27] his vomit go what
[1:08:29] on all the tables is that right let's

[1:08:49] devil because we can't do it without you
[1:08:52] but i want to lay a foundation i don't
[1:08:55] want to rush because we want to lay a
[1:08:56] solid foundation with the bible say what
[1:08:58] the prophet says
[1:09:00] and when they come in there and you
[1:09:01] bring it because why because the prophet
[1:09:03] is saying what god has given him to say
[1:09:06] hallelujah he said now look at
[1:09:09] isaiah 28 and let's start for the sake
[1:09:11] of time let's look at verse 5.
[1:09:13] he says in that day shall the lord the
[1:09:15] host be where he crown of glory and for
[1:09:18] his
[1:09:18] diadem of beauty unto the
[1:09:22] residue of his people who for a spirit
[1:09:25] of judgment
[1:09:26] to him that sitteth in judgment and
[1:09:29] for strength to them that turn the
[1:09:32] battle to the gate
[1:09:33] he said but they also have error
[1:09:37] through wine through strong drink
[1:09:40] and out of the way he said the priest
[1:09:43] and the prophet ah
[1:09:47] how are they going to get uh how are
[1:09:49] they going to get it thus say to the
[1:09:51] lord brother steve

[1:10:04] error through strong drink
[1:10:06] and they are swallowed up uh of of wine

[1:11:15] vomit and filthiness so that there is no
[1:11:18] place clean you can shut your bible and
[1:11:22] just start
[1:11:22] running that god has put you in the

[1:19:43] if a man or a woman could ever get their
[1:19:47] thoughts and their testimony
[1:19:51] and their lives so line up with god
[1:19:55] until the channel of the holy spirit
[1:19:59] will be perfectly one with god
[1:20:02] what would take place if the man
[1:20:06] and the woman could ever get lined up
[1:20:10] we're with the freedom from their heart
[1:20:14] with faith from the innermost
[1:20:18] huh down in your heart we got to get out
[1:20:21] of this
[1:20:22] intellectual walking with the word of
[1:20:24] god
[1:20:25] the devil should have no authority over
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:29] remember when they went especially a
[1:20:31] demon remember god
[1:20:33] jesus gave those the apostles authority
[1:20:36] when he gave them those authority they
[1:20:38] came back rejoicing
[1:20:39] they came back rejoicing because the
[1:20:41] devil was subject to them
[1:20:43] but he said so you're supposed to be
[1:20:46] this but that was supposed to be subject
[1:20:48] to you
[1:20:48] huh he's supposed to be subject to you
[1:20:51] but we rejoice because our name is
[1:20:53] written
[1:20:54] in the land's book of life before the
[1:20:56] foundation of the world
[1:20:58] is that right the blood of jesus he knew
[1:21:00] he knew that you was going to get in
[1:21:02] situations
[1:21:03] hallelujah let me keep going help me
[1:21:06] lord
[1:21:07] he said now look many people come to the
[1:21:10] altar to be prayed for
[1:21:12] they have intellectual faith i'm getting
[1:21:14] ready to hit home now
[1:21:16] huh they have intellectual faith
[1:21:19] they believe in their mind
[1:21:22] they believe it because they heard it
[1:21:26] they believe it because they know it's
[1:21:28] the best policy
[1:21:31] but that's not what god looks at
[1:21:34] he looked down at your intellect down oh
[1:21:38] he
[1:21:38] don't look he don't look at your
[1:21:41] intellectual faith
[1:21:43] he looks on your heart he says that's
[1:21:46] why he said love thy god with all thy
[1:21:48] heart and all thy mind and all thy soul
[1:21:50] and all thy strength
[1:21:52] do you have a burning desire in your
[1:21:55] heart
[1:21:56] for winning souls do you have a burning
[1:22:00] desire
[1:22:01] to read your bible do you have a burning
[1:22:04] desire
[1:22:06] to stand in the gap and pray for someone
[1:22:09] do you have a burning desire in there
[1:22:12] see where there's no desire there's no
[1:22:15] temptation
[1:22:16] if satan cannot tempt you the scripture
[1:22:19] says daniel did what purposed in his
[1:22:22] heart
[1:22:23] is that right even though he had the
[1:22:25] word
[1:22:26] but daniel was going to purpose in his
[1:22:29] heart
[1:22:29] not to go against his god if his oracles
[1:22:32] was to pray
[1:22:34] three times a day is that right daniel
[1:22:36] was going to do it is that right
[1:22:38] because he was going to look he knew if
[1:22:40] he looked towards that temple
[1:22:42] anytime because of what solomon had
[1:22:45] prayed
[1:22:45] and asked god for is that right in the
[1:22:48] finishing of the temple
[1:22:49] hallelujah let me keep going help me
[1:22:52] lord
[1:22:53] he says but when your confession see
[1:22:56] that's what i was saying
[1:23:02] all those within that and hear me good
[1:23:06] hear me with your spiritual ear
[1:23:10] the whole world is waiting for the
[1:23:12] manifestations of the sons and daughters
[1:23:14] of god
[1:23:18] if someone come here
[1:23:21] and i see all my saints most of my
[1:23:24] brothers and sisters
[1:23:26] standing here in a bad light
[1:23:30] i'm gonna tell you it hurts
[1:23:34] because you have to understand what
[1:23:36] times we're in now
[1:23:40] and they even extended the grace

[1:23:45] testimonies

[1:23:50] testimonies
[1:23:54] that just came to me he said now you

[1:24:01] the authority
[1:24:03] god has given it to us

[1:24:10] morning
[1:24:11] is the same spirit that's in your pasta
[1:24:16] that's in your dickens that's in any one
[1:24:19] of
[1:24:19] y'all remember the lady she came
[1:24:22] i'm gonna tell you my wife i'm gonna
[1:24:24] tell you about it was a lady
[1:24:26] and i heard she had twins and the babies
[1:24:28] died i'm talking about a month ago
[1:24:30] some of y'all may know about it right
[1:24:32] there in america a baby died
[1:24:35] and then one of them died and it was the
[1:24:37] boy i believe
[1:24:38] and the girl lived and they came in and
[1:24:41] the doctor told her a baby died and when
[1:24:44] she came and she said
[1:24:45] doctor i want to see my baby

[1:24:53] she called her husband and she got her
[1:24:56] husband

[1:25:00] god honors faith when he got in there
[1:25:04] and he got in and he gave it she said i
[1:25:06] want to see my baby
[1:25:08] they lay the baby on the hospital bed
[1:25:10] her husband got up there and laid
[1:25:12] between her
[1:25:14] and she said lord you're the life giver
[1:25:18] she said lord you gave me the son
[1:25:22] he said lord you have to come back
[1:25:26] bring life back into her so he can take
[1:25:29] care
[1:25:30] of her sister booming god brought the
[1:25:32] life back
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:39] i huh don't tell me it's not in you it's
[1:25:42] based upon the condition
[1:25:44] it was the lady that was waiting for her
[1:25:46] prayer
[1:25:47] and when she was waiting near before her
[1:25:49] baby her baby had died early that day
[1:25:52] and brother brennan was having a meeting
[1:25:54] and when he was having that meeting
[1:25:56] and he got there and in that meeting the
[1:25:59] lady sat
[1:26:00] there and she sat there she got there
[1:26:02] and there's a lady sitting next to her
[1:26:05] and she was saying ma'am if you want me
[1:26:07] can i pray for you baby
[1:26:09] she said yes you can pray for him you go
[1:26:11] and pray for him
[1:26:12] so he got over there the lady made it up
[1:26:14] into the altar
[1:26:16] when she made it into the altar when she
[1:26:18] got there
[1:26:19] he said sister she said your baby is
[1:26:22] already healed
[1:26:24] it was a lady sitting out there next to
[1:26:26] you
[1:26:27] she laid hands on your and your baby got
[1:26:30] healed
[1:26:31] and he said the reason why god did that
[1:26:33] is because she's a mother
[1:26:35] and she can feel your unfairies better
[1:26:38] than what i could have
[1:26:41] he's your pastor who else can feel your
[1:26:44] family
[1:26:45] more than your pastor the same spirit
[1:26:49] that's in him we ain't pushing the devil
[1:26:53] this is how i preach when i go out to
[1:26:55] the jails in the prisons i need to pray
[1:26:57] my wife always give me but i can't help
[1:26:59] i got many testimonies there
[1:27:01] many testimonies there we take it in
[1:27:03] there
[1:27:04] we bring it down and you know why
[1:27:06] because they never heard one speak
[1:27:08] as they spoke such as this because
[1:27:11] jesus comes in there he gets the honor
[1:27:14] he gets the glory in your position i'm
[1:27:17] not boasting
[1:27:18] i'm boasting in him because i know who i
[1:27:21] am
[1:27:21] i know where i come from i know what
[1:27:23] he's given me
[1:27:24] in this end time
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:30] you don't go out there playing with the
[1:27:31] devil right now you're dealing with
[1:27:33] doctrines of
[1:27:34] devils doctrines of devils
[1:27:37] hallelujah look what he says he said but
[1:27:40] when your confession
[1:27:41] say one thing and your life lives
[1:27:44] another
[1:27:46] there is something wrong somewhere
[1:27:49] this is our this is our prophet huh
[1:27:53] so i don't worry about the devil i don't
[1:27:55] care nothing about him
[1:27:56] you know why because you think that some
[1:27:58] of the devil thought he was going to run
[1:27:59] me off when i first came here
[1:28:00] oh i know you think god don't give us
[1:28:02] been the spirit of discernment
[1:28:03] well i can't help but i come around
[1:28:05] there preaching when we go into prison
[1:28:06] you don't do a lot of quoting i preach
[1:28:08] the same message
[1:28:08] you just don't do a lot of quoting you
[1:28:10] got to give wisdom
[1:28:12] he said it take wisdom to win a soul he
[1:28:14] said when you got around in there
[1:28:16] you preaching why they got all the books
[1:28:19] they got the seals they got the ages
[1:28:21] they can get free bibles they can get
[1:28:23] anything
[1:28:24] now you see you do what god says do
[1:28:27] then god when he tells you the minute
[1:28:29] you minister that way the way he thought
[1:28:31] you get yourself out of the way i let
[1:28:33] him use this gift
[1:28:34] is that right oh i want to be in the
[1:28:36] message i want to visit the message you
[1:28:38] think the holy ghost didn't tell me
[1:28:40] huh the same holy ghost was back then is
[1:28:41] the same holy ghost right now i'm not
[1:28:43] moving on my own i'm moving by him
[1:28:45] the spirit the footsteps of the
[1:28:47] righteousness is ordered of the lord is
[1:28:48] that right
[1:28:49] that's what we're talking about in this
[1:28:51] hour here now so you come around here
[1:28:53] you know why he's sending us here
[1:28:54] because god knows for it to come at the
[1:28:56] right time i know he's the man
[1:28:58] you know why because i got thus say the
[1:29:00] lord i got it from god
[1:29:03] and i'm not ashamed to say it you better
[1:29:05] have contact with god yourself
[1:29:07] this is an individual walk they're
[1:29:09] looking for the revival
[1:29:10] huh what are you talking about i'm
[1:29:12] looking for souls to be crying out
[1:29:14] i'm looking for them to come around
[1:29:15] there to the altar how could they come
[1:29:17] around it was individuals sitting back
[1:29:19] in there they know they want to be set
[1:29:20] free
[1:29:21] they were sitting there like this they
[1:29:22] didn't know which way to go
[1:29:24] because beam is a doctrine hat
[1:29:32] when you have to face them you'll face
[1:29:33] them first time brother brandon had to
[1:29:35] face the more devil too
[1:29:36] running that old demon was in that woman

[1:29:42] devils huh
[1:29:43] i'm just talking about him me the first
[1:29:44] time i call myself getting out there

[1:29:52] a fellow the devil looked and raped my
[1:29:54] face
[1:29:54] ha ha i'm still here
[1:29:59] he knew he was right i was still
[1:30:00] learning he knew was right
[1:30:02] so you see what about the seven sons of
[1:30:04] skipper you think they ain't alive
[1:30:06] come on now huh they tried to handle
[1:30:08] this holy ghost they tried to go up
[1:30:09] against them devils they saw something
[1:30:11] they saw something that they needed they
[1:30:13] saw a power that they wanted
[1:30:15] is that right the seven sons of skeeper
[1:30:17] skipper mean intellect
[1:30:19] they try to handle that word through
[1:30:21] intellectual and when they come around
[1:30:23] in there
[1:30:24] and they couldn't move that devil he
[1:30:25] said jesus we know paul we know but who
[1:30:28] are you
[1:30:28] he said them demons jumped on them and
[1:30:31] whooped them naked is that right
[1:30:32] tell me the devil ain't real you better
[1:30:34] but we got a greater power
[1:30:36] greater is he that is in thee than he
[1:30:38] that is in the world
[1:30:40] god has given you a word and i'm telling
[1:30:42] you what you got you want to go home
[1:30:43] let me float around there look what he
[1:30:45] says let's see what's down in that soul
[1:30:47] let's see what's down in that soul some
[1:30:50] of you brothers don't bend around
[1:30:51] get in your position moved in your
[1:30:53] position
[1:30:54] let god be able to use you come on it's
[1:30:57] almost going home
[1:30:58] time is that right look what he says he
[1:31:02] said now he says
[1:31:03] but there is something where he said
[1:31:04] that's because you've got an
[1:31:06] intellectual faith
[1:31:08] and not a faith from your heart and that
[1:31:11] shows that outside here
[1:31:12] is a knowledge of god see that's what
[1:31:15] brother branham when his brother
[1:31:16] preached in the hebrew series
[1:31:17] he said they're coming to the knowledge
[1:31:19] of the truth is that right
[1:31:21] they never came and received the baptism
[1:31:23] of the holy ghost
[1:31:24] it was only an intellectual conception
[1:31:27] of the message
[1:31:28] and the only one knew it was that person
[1:31:30] in god is that right
[1:31:32] because god is the only one can give you
[1:31:34] the holy ghost
[1:31:35] he gives you he knows you're soaking
[1:31:37] your heart is circumcised
[1:31:39] by what by faith is that right
[1:31:41] hallelujah
[1:31:43] look it's not hard faith is a revelation
[1:31:47] you want the revelation what the past
[1:31:48] what the lord has given the pastor
[1:31:50] you want to go too deep huh you want to
[1:31:52] go to the deeper
[1:31:54] all you got to do is believe all you got
[1:31:57] to do is believe
[1:31:59] when i return to the earth shall i find
[1:32:01] what faith
[1:32:02] you got to believe on whom now i've sent
[1:32:04] some of you dropping some of the some of
[1:32:06] the devils dropped in your spirit
[1:32:07] you come wondering is that right that's
[1:32:10] like you got the message from the men in
[1:32:12] the in the message here
[1:32:13] you know some of them over there
[1:32:14] streaming who has some of them live
[1:32:16] streaming
[1:32:17] because they're wondering you know why
[1:32:18] you're wondering you know why you're
[1:32:20] wondering
[1:32:20] because the demons the doctrines got to
[1:32:22] hold to you
[1:32:23] so when you got around in there they're
[1:32:25] looking rather than when god has given
[1:32:27] us
[1:32:28] you're going to tell me that i'm going
[1:32:29] to worry about the mass
[1:32:31] sure we respect the laws of the land but
[1:32:33] we had a prophet
[1:32:35] that told us way before the pandemic
[1:32:38] came is that right he told us
[1:32:40] they was going to be doing what a stern
[1:32:43] war
[1:32:44] he called it a germ war
[1:32:47] a demon war is that right
[1:32:50] so that demon that come in there he told
[1:32:53] us
[1:32:54] something was going to do what stay home
[1:32:59] son was going to stay home he said
[1:33:02] something
[1:33:02] was going to do well had to put a mask
[1:33:05] on
[1:33:06] is that right some is going to do what
[1:33:08] we couldn't even keep light saw on the
[1:33:10] shelf at walmart
[1:33:12] huh some say that we was going there was
[1:33:14] going to buy about a light saw
[1:33:16] and he said something was going to have
[1:33:18] a what a mask
[1:33:21] and then to get around this is that
[1:33:23] right didn't he prophesy
[1:33:25] that but he told us the only thing
[1:33:28] that's going to keep it all for you
[1:33:30] is the blood of jesus christ the baptism
[1:33:33] of the holy ghost i'd rather stick with
[1:33:36] the words of the prophet
[1:33:38] that's what i'd rather stick with
[1:33:43] you know what jesus wasn't popular
[1:33:46] i ain't want your money i don't want
[1:33:49] popularity
[1:33:50] i don't want no position you're going to
[1:33:52] let god
[1:33:53] people go with your false teaching in
[1:33:56] this out here
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] god sent this god's opening this up
[1:34:02] this church says you had to be ready we
[1:34:05] shaking them up around here
[1:34:06] researching these message people up
[1:34:08] around here they never heard of
[1:34:10] teachings like this like they heard
[1:34:12] before
[1:34:13] tell them to come against it how can you
[1:34:14] come against it when they're ready to
[1:34:16] from the dead
[1:34:17] we don't came from the dead mixed
[1:34:19] multitudes came out of here
[1:34:21] you had the son of god and the sons of
[1:34:23] the prophets the sons of the prophet
[1:34:25] stood far off for the rally they never
[1:34:27] really believed uh
[1:34:28] they stood off and they wondering is
[1:34:30] that right elijah but he lucia
[1:34:32] he saw what he saw the spirit that was
[1:34:35] on him we didn't see the man
[1:34:36] we ain't worshiping the man we saw the
[1:34:39] spirit that was wrong the man
[1:34:40] the spirit of elijah huh
[1:34:48] thought they was getting away brother
[1:34:49] steve you know why well brother branham
[1:34:51] is not here
[1:34:52] that gift's not here that gift's not
[1:34:55] here
[1:34:55] he don't care he can discern those
[1:34:57] things we got a man uh
[1:34:59] one two three four we got a man sitting
[1:35:01] back in here
[1:35:02] he's got a blue jacket and bailey's
[1:35:04] pants his name is polycarp is that right
[1:35:09] yeah believe go on your way you know
[1:35:11] what but what they're missing is now
[1:35:14] when the third paul claimed it's the
[1:35:16] opening of the word is that right
[1:35:18] they just didn't open now we got
[1:35:20] understanding of it
[1:35:21] when understanding comes your confidence
[1:35:24] comes when confidence comes
[1:35:25] your faith come we have faith come it's
[1:35:28] a revelation
[1:35:29] is that right so we have to fight in
[1:35:31] this war that's why he said cast
[1:35:33] down every imagination that try to exalt
[1:35:35] itself
[1:35:36] against the word of god obsession
[1:35:38] oppression
[1:35:39] possession obsession is receiving the
[1:35:42] wrong start
[1:35:43] stay away from them doctrines of the
[1:35:45] devil is that right
[1:35:46] then if you receive it he'll oppress you
[1:35:48] with that thing and then you know what
[1:35:50] he'll grab ahold of you
[1:35:51] is that right but now we still got the
[1:35:53] discernment
[1:35:55] the word of the lord is able to discern
[1:35:58] the thoughts
[1:35:59] and the intents of the heart is that
[1:36:01] right and able to go down between the
[1:36:03] muscles and the morals of the bones
[1:36:05] hallelujah you want to go home with this
[1:36:09] had to come
[1:36:10] you don't see this had to come let me
[1:36:11] read something to you i know i'm jumping
[1:36:13] around but that's okay how your way lord
[1:36:16] he said now look look this had to come
[1:36:20] this message the way is coming through
[1:36:23] here now

[1:36:27] him for 13 14 15 years
[1:36:29] hit him as a deacon hidden brothers
[1:36:32] there is that right
[1:36:33] they thought they they thought they had
[1:36:35] us no no no no no no
[1:36:37] god is in control of everything look
[1:36:39] what they say
[1:36:40] this is in the uh seven churches now you
[1:36:43] can read this out of the old
[1:36:44] blue book church age on page 377.
[1:36:48] he says and i'm gonna jump a little bit
[1:36:50] he says now the true
[1:36:52] church will take away from this this
[1:36:54] world to be with the lord
[1:36:56] see we're looking for the lord that's
[1:36:58] why the lord told us
[1:37:00] and when abraham got in the promised
[1:37:02] land you would think that was
[1:37:03] it is that right but the scriptures
[1:37:05] didn't say that
[1:37:06] it's natural to abraham it's the same
[1:37:09] thing with us the spiritual abraham
[1:37:11] he told us he was what looking for a
[1:37:13] city and a builder and a maker and a
[1:37:15] foundation that was who it was
[1:37:17] god is that right this is not our home
[1:37:20] don't get comfortable here is that right
[1:37:22] hallelujah he said now he says they
[1:37:26] they god will catch away his bride for
[1:37:29] the great marriage supper
[1:37:30] of the lamb he said now as the
[1:37:32] concluding chapter was given
[1:37:34] in order to these two churches and two
[1:37:37] spirits
[1:37:38] from pentecost to their consummation
[1:37:41] we will take this final time to show
[1:37:44] this in the lay of the sea age
[1:37:47] is that right it had to come in this age
[1:37:50] he chose you because you're going to be
[1:37:52] victorious
[1:37:53] you are overcomers in this age is that
[1:37:56] right
[1:37:57] he said this age started just after the
[1:37:59] turn of the 20th century
[1:38:02] as it was to begin this age the true
[1:38:05] church
[1:38:05] will return to being the bride she was
[1:38:09] at pentecost
[1:38:10] our pentecostal experience is that right
[1:38:13] we know
[1:38:14] that there must necessity be a return
[1:38:17] of the dynamic power huh
[1:38:21] it must be a return of the dynamic
[1:38:24] power but how is it going to return
[1:38:28] something got to happen and god put you
[1:38:31] in the place
[1:38:32] hallelujah the believers sensed this
[1:38:36] in their spirits and began crying to god
[1:38:39] for a new outpouring such as was in the
[1:38:43] first century
[1:38:44] what seemed to be the answer came as
[1:38:47] many began to speak in tongues manifest
[1:38:49] the gifts of the spirit
[1:38:51] the restoration they thought this was
[1:38:53] the restoration
[1:38:54] but it wasn't the restoration yet huh
[1:38:58] look what has to come still with me
[1:39:01] let me slow down look what has to come
[1:39:05] it was then believed this was indeed the
[1:39:09] long-awaited restoration he was talking
[1:39:11] about the pentecostal
[1:39:12] denomination he said it was not
[1:39:16] for the latter rain can come only
[1:39:20] after the former rain
[1:39:24] i'm
[1:39:28] and you're sitting in the midst of it he
[1:39:31] said
[1:39:31] which is the spring or the teaching
[1:39:36] huh they got to come to tear down
[1:39:40] the teachings of the devil of the
[1:39:42] doctrine of the demons
[1:39:44] that these denominations them poisoned
[1:39:47] people with
[1:39:48] amen got to come
[1:39:52] and god joshua god have you in the midst
[1:39:56] of it
[1:39:57] god is cleaning us up
[1:40:01] he says now the latter rain then is the
[1:40:04] harvest ring
[1:40:06] how could this be the real thing when
[1:40:09] the teaching reign
[1:40:10] had not come
[1:40:15] look what you're getting now this
[1:40:18] is that
[1:40:22] this is that what we've been waiting god
[1:40:28] you can't have the mechanics and you've
[1:40:30] got to have the dynamics and the
[1:40:31] mechanics
[1:40:32] got to go in one according to the
[1:40:34] scripture everything
[1:40:36] had to be restored god said i shall
[1:40:38] restore
[1:40:39] what the palmer worm the cankerworm the
[1:40:41] caterpillar

[1:40:59] help me lord he said it has to come
[1:41:02] thus was that what he says teach the
[1:41:05] people
[1:41:06] he says now how could this be the real
[1:41:09] thing
[1:41:10] when the teaching reign had not come he
[1:41:12] said the prophet messenger
[1:41:14] who was to be sent to teach the people
[1:41:18] and turn the hearts of the children back
[1:41:21] to the pentecostals fathers
[1:41:23] had not yet come see how the lord said
[1:41:26] malachi 4 luke 17

[1:41:51] to keep you pure to keep you right until
[1:41:54] your
[1:41:54] husband coming to you is that right

[1:42:01] talked to us
[1:42:02] over there in what ecclesiastic i mean
[1:42:04] song of solomon 4
[1:42:06] when he told us is that right paul
[1:42:08] talked about first son

[1:42:12] sarah when you come around in there your
[1:42:15] husband first got to be your brother
[1:42:17] is that right and after you become your
[1:42:19] brother then he become your husband
[1:42:21] ain't that what the lord has told us you
[1:42:23] see so now
[1:42:25] god is restoring all of these things
[1:42:27] back
[1:42:28] he's bringing back the absolute when
[1:42:31] malachi
[1:42:31] 4 came the absolute it will not be moved
[1:42:35] is that right it's infallible hallelujah
[1:42:41] help me lord my god my god trying to
[1:42:44] follow somewhere
[1:42:46] help me lord the harvest ring it says
[1:42:49] it says thus what was thought to be the
[1:42:52] restoration
[1:42:53] and the final quickening unto the
[1:42:55] rapture had not come
[1:42:58] in it was a mixture of unrighteous
[1:43:00] partaking of the spiritual blessing
[1:43:03] and manifesting in the holy ghost
[1:43:06] hallelujah nicely brother charles nick's
[1:43:10] multitude
[1:43:11] always been always was prophet god said
[1:43:14] it was twins
[1:43:15] the holy ghost as we have kept pointing
[1:43:17] out to you
[1:43:19] in it also was
[1:43:22] devil power as men were
[1:43:25] under the control of devils see why the
[1:43:28] pastor keeps saying
[1:43:29] the devil with demons is hiding demons
[1:43:32] is hiding and
[1:43:33] demons was hiding in you hallelujah let
[1:43:35] me let me
[1:43:36] let me jump back to where i was at
[1:43:38] because i want you to see this here
[1:43:41] you can go if you want to finish reading
[1:43:43] that like i said it's on page 377
[1:43:45] in the old church age book he says now
[1:43:48] look
[1:43:49] he says he says now when the kings
[1:43:58] he says let me read this once more so
[1:44:01] you can get it
[1:44:03] when your confession says one thing in
[1:44:05] your life lives another
[1:44:07] what's in there see here it's a demon of
[1:44:10] doubting
[1:44:12] i believe in divine healing but my life
[1:44:14] is showing something else
[1:44:17] somewhere is a demon of doubting you
[1:44:19] went through justification
[1:44:21] you went through sanctification and now
[1:44:24] you're swept clean
[1:44:25] still with me and now by your being
[1:44:28] swept clean
[1:44:29] he says now he said the devil said the
[1:44:31] house is clean
[1:44:33] and he said i'm going to come back
[1:44:35] because you never moved to get the
[1:44:37] baptism of the holy ghost and got sealed
[1:44:40] and now when you move in there because
[1:44:42] now somewhere
[1:44:43] you didn't get the holy ghost is because
[1:44:46] you
[1:44:46] doubt it you're doubting something
[1:44:50] and god cannot give it to you cannot
[1:44:52] seal you like that
[1:44:53] so the demon of doubt comes back with
[1:44:56] that demon of doubt
[1:44:58] and it comes back seven times worse
[1:45:00] seven other demons
[1:45:02] you're worse off than when there once
[1:45:03] was before is that right
[1:45:05] so we have to understand in the garden
[1:45:08] of eden
[1:45:09] that's what got even trouble don't
[1:45:10] reason the word
[1:45:12] just believe the word if you don't
[1:45:14] understand it just believe
[1:45:16] it and god will bring it to you gotta
[1:45:18] break it open
[1:45:19] remember brother branham talked about
[1:45:21] that you just keep confessing
[1:45:23] remember the man that came up into the
[1:45:25] prayer line
[1:45:26] he was old catholic he had blinded he
[1:45:28] was around and never been to a holy
[1:45:30] ghost field meeting and when he never
[1:45:32] been to the holy ghost field meeting
[1:45:34] he got there and he came up in there to
[1:45:36] brother branham spoke
[1:45:37] just paraphrasing it for the sake of
[1:45:39] time he told me he came in the prayer
[1:45:40] line
[1:45:41] go on your way you're healed said he
[1:45:42] went out there he said he was blind
[1:45:44] the man said he was blind is that right
[1:45:46] he went out there they mocked him it got
[1:45:48] right scoffers came at him then he came
[1:45:50] back to the meeting the next night
[1:45:52] he said he came up in there he said you
[1:45:54] told me i was healed
[1:45:55] he said you told me you believe why you
[1:45:57] back in the prayer line
[1:45:59] hallelujah why are you back in the
[1:46:01] prayer line
[1:46:02] you said god said when he returned to
[1:46:04] the earth shall i find what

[1:47:38] source if you're not communicating with

[1:47:46] like a lion i don't know if i had that
[1:47:49] in there god help me
[1:47:50] he said like a lion like a roaring lion
[1:47:54] satan is the influence he got always
[1:47:56] here
[1:47:59] hallelujah nothing to
[1:48:03] what brother brandon was working with
[1:48:05] here brother steve when you was talking
[1:48:08] there
[1:48:08] i tell you that thing came to me
[1:48:13] and i was looking to listen to the
[1:48:15] message invading of the united states
[1:48:19] he said invading of the united states
[1:48:22] and but steve you said something we
[1:48:23] would fellowship he didn't realize
[1:48:26] he said you had to come through
[1:48:27] hollywood i said hollywood
[1:48:31] but but remember
[1:48:34] the scripture says like a roaring lion
[1:48:38] and hollywood the number one uh
[1:48:40] producers at the time
[1:48:42] was mgm
[1:48:45] mgm juiced the lion
[1:48:49] and when they came around in it and
[1:48:51] their locals was aurora
[1:48:54] and when they came in there brother
[1:48:56] branham said he entered in
[1:48:58] through the television he entered into
[1:49:00] the movies
[1:49:01] let me read it to you i'm trying to
[1:49:03] start rushing because of time
[1:49:05] help me lord he said he was like a
[1:49:08] roaring lion
[1:49:09] he said he came through hollywood he
[1:49:11] just came through the movies
[1:49:13] he said he came through the fashions he
[1:49:15] said he came through
[1:49:17] the television and now i entered and i
[1:49:19] and i added the internet
[1:49:22] so when he came there she went a lion
[1:49:25] ross
[1:49:26] what he's doing is saying this is my
[1:49:28] domain now
[1:49:30] now i'm starting to take i'm going to
[1:49:33] move
[1:49:33] in now i'm going to invade your home
[1:49:38] i'm going to invade your privacy
[1:49:41] that's why when we call it the
[1:49:42] television you got to monitor my
[1:49:45] grandchildren and my children i let them
[1:49:47] watch christian movies and different
[1:49:48] ones
[1:49:49] but i made sure that i don't have no
[1:49:52] television there
[1:49:53] because you have to realize what the
[1:49:55] prophet i don't have time to get into it
[1:49:57] right now
[1:49:58] but you can go in the first i mean first
[1:50:00] peter five and eight
[1:50:01] and you see why the prophet of god
[1:50:03] started talking about this
[1:50:05] because when they invaded the united
[1:50:07] states these demon forces
[1:50:10] was now coming out and all these
[1:50:13] different movies
[1:50:15] all these things now it was supposed to
[1:50:18] be entertaining the people
[1:50:20] they were demons forces getting in their
[1:50:23] souls you see what he was doing so
[1:50:26] now sooner or later remember he also
[1:50:29] taught us
[1:50:29] what did he say he said those demons
[1:50:33] that he saw on that woman then sears and
[1:50:36] robots
[1:50:36] when he went down there to hell now all
[1:50:39] these demons that people have been
[1:50:41] watching
[1:50:42] for years is now is being manifested out
[1:50:45] of their lives
[1:50:46] is that right so now these now what
[1:50:49] they're looking to do
[1:50:50] is get back to their normal sinful life
[1:50:53] back to the filthy beaches back to
[1:50:56] running around on their filthy garments
[1:50:58] walking around and these things are
[1:51:00] demons of the of the the doctrine demons
[1:51:03] of the devil
[1:51:04] so these demons doctrines of the devil
[1:51:06] we have to realize
[1:51:08] they're real they are full i tell you
[1:51:10] what let's just look at a couple
[1:51:12] uh scriptures if you give me by the
[1:51:14] grace of god god help me
[1:51:16] first um timothy i think it's first
[1:51:19] timothy four
[1:51:22] he said lord it's time for him
[1:51:26] it's time to take off the the the uh uh
[1:51:29] training gloves
[1:51:30] it's over with saints we're getting
[1:51:32] ready to get out of here
[1:51:34] god showed us the teaching the teaching
[1:51:36] reign is here
[1:51:37] so they got to under un understand the
[1:51:39] the true believer been waiting on this
[1:51:42] hallelujah let me see is that the one i
[1:51:44] said was the first corinthian
[1:51:45] first timothy four did i say
[1:51:49] help me lord he said
[1:51:53] get to it so we have to realize
[1:51:56] the time and the hour that we're living
[1:51:58] in hallelujah
[1:52:00] come on now thank you jesus
[1:52:08] thank you lord
[1:52:20] thank you jesus he said now look
[1:52:24] he says i charge thee therefore before
[1:52:26] god
[1:52:28] and they let me see was that the
[1:52:30] scripture no that wasn't a scripture
[1:52:34] god help me i don't think that was
[1:52:38] the scripture for the second oh i'm in
[1:52:41] second timothy yeah
[1:52:42] i said first
[1:52:46] thank you jesus
[1:52:50] he says now the spirit is speaking
[1:52:53] expressively
[1:52:55] that in the latter times some shall
[1:52:58] depart from the faith
[1:53:00] see he already told us he says giving he
[1:53:02] to what
[1:53:03] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:53:07] he said speaking lies in hypocrisy
[1:53:10] so you're looking at these tactics of
[1:53:12] the devil
[1:53:13] the first thing the holy ghost told us
[1:53:15] what rusty
[1:53:16] he told a son he told you sunday
[1:53:19] the first thing he come to do is allow
[1:53:21] you to get you off of
[1:53:23] the message of the hour is that right he
[1:53:25] come to get you off the message of the
[1:53:27] hour
[1:53:28] and try to make you think this message
[1:53:30] of the hour is not true
[1:53:32] and just bear with me we bring the
[1:53:33] musicians you can come on up please
[1:53:36] it says speaking what lies see
[1:53:39] lies in hypocrisy now we're showing you
[1:53:42] his tactics
[1:53:43] he said his proxy having their
[1:53:45] conscience seared with a
[1:53:47] hot iron see they ain't going to listen
[1:53:50] to nothing you can't bring them into
[1:53:52] nothing
[1:53:52] he says he says darling souls that their
[1:53:55] souls their souls are mocked with sin
[1:53:58] with
[1:53:58] unbelief he said now forbidding to marry
[1:54:02] and commanding to abstain from meats
[1:54:04] which can have created
[1:54:06] to be received with thanksgiving of them
[1:54:09] which believe and know the truth
[1:54:11] for every creature of god is good and
[1:54:14] nothing to be refused
[1:54:15] if it be received with thanksgiving for
[1:54:18] it is what sanctified by the what the
[1:54:22] word of god with what with prayer
[1:54:25] he says if you put the brethren
[1:54:28] in remembrance in these things thou
[1:54:30] shall be a good minister
[1:54:32] of jesus christ nourish all in the words
[1:54:36] of faith
[1:54:36] and of good what doctrine whereunto thou
[1:54:40] has obtained he says but refuse profane
[1:54:43] and old wise fables and exercise
[1:54:47] thyself rather unto godliness
[1:54:50] for bodily exercise prophecy but godly
[1:54:53] is profitable
[1:54:54] unto all things having promised of the
[1:54:58] life
[1:54:58] that now is and of that which is to come
[1:55:02] it says this is a faithful saying
[1:55:05] and worthy of all acceptations
[1:55:08] he says for therefore we both labor
[1:55:12] and suffer reproach because we trust
[1:55:15] in the what living god who is the savior
[1:55:18] of all men
[1:55:19] especially of those that believe
[1:55:22] these things command and teach you know

[2:03:20] i kept the first team on t4 and here
[2:03:23] brother kelly search it
[2:03:24] all up and pull it amen
[2:03:29] the doctrines of devils
[2:03:34] matthew chapter 16
[2:03:37] today
[2:03:40] verse 6 are you there
[2:03:45] then jesus say unto them
[2:03:48] take heed and be aware
[2:03:51] of what the leaven
[2:03:55] of the pharisee and
[2:03:59] of the sadducees this was two class
[2:04:02] of people under the law of moses
[2:04:06] but they were separated by doctrines
[2:04:09] if you want to know their doctrine shoot
[2:04:10] me a text i'll give you scripture
[2:04:13] and you're going to see what the
[2:04:14] pharisees believe and what the side you
[2:04:16] see
[2:04:16] one did not believe in angels and
[2:04:18] resurrection and the other one did
[2:04:20] believe it
[2:04:21] so he formed a doctrine but both of them
[2:04:24] still under moses
[2:04:27] that's why jesus said he listened to
[2:04:30] what they say but don't watch them
[2:04:33] because they sit on moses see they're
[2:04:35] going to tell you brother brother i'm
[2:04:36] saying brother brother i'm saying.
[2:04:41] but when you watch them it's contrary to
[2:04:44] what moses says
[2:04:48] now then jesus said unto them take heed
[2:04:51] and be aware of the leaven of the
[2:04:54] pharisee
[2:04:55] and of the sadducees what is the leaven
[2:05:00] of the pharisee and the sadducees
[2:05:04] what does steven say no
[2:05:07] job to verse 11.
[2:05:10] how is it that she do not understand
[2:05:13] that i speak it not to you concerning
[2:05:18] i'm not talking about the yeast
[2:05:22] amen it's right here in the scripture
[2:05:24] i'm just reading you the scripture
[2:05:27] amen sometime i see it i read the
[2:05:29] scripture i'm just wondering what was
[2:05:31] going on in this message
[2:05:33] amen concerning bread
[2:05:36] that you should be aware of the what the
[2:05:39] leaven
[2:05:40] of the pharisees and of the sadducees
[2:05:43] so lord jesus would you please explain
[2:05:45] us verse 12
[2:05:48] then understood today how that
[2:05:51] he begged them not
[2:05:55] be aware of the leaven of bread
[2:05:58] comma but of the water
[2:06:02] the dog train of the water and off the
[2:06:06] water
[2:06:09] you see the trouble and doctrine means
[2:06:12] what
[2:06:13] the teaching
[2:06:16] when i got in the message back home i'm
[2:06:19] moving came in here
[2:06:21] i ordered sermon books and i began to
[2:06:24] sit down and read myself
[2:06:27] the first sermon book that was handed to
[2:06:29] me was the seven seal
[2:06:30] [Laughter]
[2:06:32] maybe that's why i love the seals amen
[2:06:36] and when i got here i order more and i
[2:06:38] begin to read and as i was reading and i
[2:06:40] was reading
[2:06:41] and i stop i call the minister say wait
[2:06:43] a minute
[2:06:44] i'm just asking a question what was the
[2:06:47] problem
[2:06:47] back home because there were
[2:06:50] this one believed this this one believe
[2:06:52] this and it was
[2:06:53] war all over the message wars of
[2:06:57] doctrine
[2:06:58] all over amen and the souls of the
[2:07:01] people were neglected
[2:07:04] and that spirit of war got into the
[2:07:07] congregation
[2:07:08] and the congregation be we begin to
[2:07:10] fight one with another congregation
[2:07:13] then there were names all over the
[2:07:15] country big names
[2:07:16] that pop up and there were ministers
[2:07:19] under the name
[2:07:20] minister under a certain person and
[2:07:23] those ministers have the churches behind
[2:07:25] them and it was
[2:07:26] like a war zone and this one said the
[2:07:28] seven seal is being revealed this one
[2:07:30] said it's not revealed
[2:07:31] all over like 20 30 years people just
[2:07:35] have been so when people sit and they
[2:07:38] are fellowshipping about the word
[2:07:40] of god they don't fellowship for
[2:07:42] revelation
[2:07:44] they are fellowshipping for argument
[2:07:47] and debate it's all over debate
[2:07:50] they can sit and argue three hours when
[2:07:53] they
[2:07:54] leave this one kept their position and
[2:07:56] the other one kept their position
[2:07:58] and not they didn't learn anything they
[2:08:01] go back and live the same way and the
[2:08:02] people were caught up
[2:08:04] under that amen and begin to talk about
[2:08:07] what is
[2:08:08] going on in the message instead of
[2:08:11] talking about what is going on in the
[2:08:14] message
[2:08:14] in the world amen when i begin to read
[2:08:18] i ask a minister a question and say what
[2:08:21] was going on back home
[2:08:24] he said what do you mean i say look
[2:08:26] brother branham says this here
[2:08:28] brother branham said this here brother
[2:08:30] branham says this here
[2:08:31] brother branham says this here the
[2:08:32] minister told me say i don't understand
[2:08:35] i said but the problem is so clear and i
[2:08:38] come to find out it was
[2:08:39] battles of individuals
[2:08:43] and that got the congregation into a
[2:08:45] fight
[2:08:47] and the same thing happened all over the
[2:08:50] world
[2:08:51] and god now is shaking everything
[2:08:55] up and down amen everything has been
[2:08:58] shaken
[2:09:00] amen now it's no longer about a
[2:09:02] personality
[2:09:04] it's about the word of god amen
[2:09:07] we heard so much we don't see the power
[2:09:11] we heard so much we still we're having
[2:09:14] demon
[2:09:15] we're still struggling amen why because
[2:09:19] that religious
[2:09:20] devil got onto the people
[2:09:24] the people got comfortable with demon we
[2:09:27] know also and so we are fine too so and
[2:09:29] so
[2:09:30] we ate with saw and so we slept in so
[2:09:32] and so how
[2:09:33] we dine with so and so we fellowship
[2:09:36] with so and so
[2:09:37] and they think with that they are
[2:09:39] entitled to go to heaven
[2:09:42] amen amen and when you bring the message
[2:09:46] you say brother branham says this
[2:09:48] watch how they fight you with brother
[2:09:50] brother message
[2:09:52] amen you can bring 20 coats and the
[2:09:55] people still
[2:09:56] hanging on to what they believe because
[2:10:00] so and so who has a big name
[2:10:03] told them that he was right you can
[2:10:06] bring 11
[2:10:07] coats and they still hang on to that why
[2:10:10] because so and so say that
[2:10:12] religious demon amen
[2:10:16] the temple did not change the life did
[2:10:19] not
[2:10:19] change the demon are still there the
[2:10:22] attitudes are not changing
[2:10:24] and before you know it the younger that
[2:10:26] are coming up on this church
[2:10:27] will begin to challenge the older one
[2:10:30] amen because when they're going to see
[2:10:32] the scripture they will turn around and
[2:10:34] look at mom and say
[2:10:36] but what you're saying is not what is
[2:10:38] written here
[2:10:39] and you're going to wake up amen
[2:10:42] when the younger one will turn around
[2:10:44] and say wait a minute daddy you say this
[2:10:46] but
[2:10:47] the pastor showed us in the scripture in
[2:10:49] the message that brother branham said
[2:10:52] this it is amazing how i sit with people
[2:10:56] and they still reason with the word
[2:10:58] after everything that the lord
[2:11:01] opened their priority is what is logical
[2:11:04] to their mind
[2:11:07] amen in other words if it doesn't make
[2:11:09] sense they don't care
[2:11:13] but branham is just a man ah we already
[2:11:17] know that
[2:11:18] amen david was a man the whole bible was
[2:11:22] written
[2:11:23] by the lives of men now how can you take
[2:11:27] this
[2:11:27] bible and show me which part of death
[2:11:31] within the bible
[2:11:32] is human and which part is not human
[2:11:35] while it's in the word of god
[2:11:38] the life of david is right written in
[2:11:41] here
[2:11:41] how can you demonstrate to me that
[2:11:43] brother stephen
[2:11:44] from chapter 1 till chapter 13
[2:11:48] it's not inspired that's just the man
[2:11:50] david
[2:11:51] the bible says all scripture is what
[2:11:55] which one are you going to take off
[2:11:59] amen you see david crying my god my god
[2:12:03] why have that forsaken me oh brother
[2:12:06] stephen this is just a man that was
[2:12:07] going through depression
[2:12:11] later on somebody had a cross crying my
[2:12:13] god my god
[2:12:14] why have that forsaken me what are you
[2:12:17] gonna do
[2:12:19] no no this is not brother branham this
[2:12:21] is the human part
[2:12:22] even the people that work with brother
[2:12:25] branham if you look at their name
[2:12:28] if you just humble yourself you just
[2:12:30] look at leo
[2:12:34] you see what i'm saying how can two
[2:12:36] homosexuals work
[2:12:38] on the tapes and god let it go
[2:12:42] you see how we pass other people you
[2:12:45] know that leo and gene were
[2:12:46] we're homosexual right and who are
[2:12:48] taking care of the tapes
[2:12:51] how can god let two people like that
[2:12:53] taking care of the trips
[2:12:54] before they get kicked out later on
[2:12:58] amen look at their name you will
[2:13:01] understand
[2:13:02] look at their name one is leo
[2:13:06] one is gene look at their name and they
[2:13:08] were homosexual
[2:13:10] and they were handling the tape seed
[2:13:15] amen because the ministry of malachi 4
[2:13:19] comes with luke 17 30
[2:13:22] under a sodomite condition
[2:13:27] you see what i'm saying and because he
[2:13:29] comes under the sodomite condition
[2:13:32] leo speak of the second coming amen
[2:13:36] the gene the message of the second
[2:13:38] coming
[2:13:39] is coming when the world is under the
[2:13:42] sodomite condition
[2:13:44] that's why you see leo and gene together
[2:13:48] handling the tape yet under that
[2:13:50] anointing of homosexuality
[2:13:52] because that's the seed that's gonna
[2:13:55] break that anointing
[2:13:56] and present you before your grandmother
[2:14:01] fight brother branham again
[2:14:04] you see you see now it is a prophetic
[2:14:09] message all you do humble you're proud
[2:14:13] humble your knowledge humble your
[2:14:14] education humble your experience humble
[2:14:17] all your knowledge your friends in the
[2:14:20] message
[2:14:20] just humble yourself when somebody shows
[2:14:23] you the scripture and the message
[2:14:25] just say amen and move forward amen
[2:14:30] if not you're going to be left behind
[2:14:32] with demons
[2:14:34] that's why i can't pull toward the
[2:14:36] surface i tried to pull
[2:14:38] and he keep holding me because
[2:14:40] somebody's still there hiding something
[2:14:43] and the more i preach the more i
[2:14:44] preached pop it pop up the more i preach
[2:14:47] the more i preach it pops up until
[2:14:49] everything is clear then we go back up
[2:14:51] to the surface
[2:14:52] amen it is not to belittle you it is
[2:14:55] just the grace of god he doesn't want
[2:14:58] you
[2:14:59] you suffer so long with holding yourself
[2:15:02] i don't want to look at this i don't
[2:15:03] want to look at that's too much that's
[2:15:04] stress
[2:15:05] that's a lot of headache amen
[2:15:08] that's a lot of headache you have that
[2:15:10] desire still burning
[2:15:12] burning burn and you are controlling
[2:15:14] that by law it's a headache
[2:15:17] if you gotta get upset get upset amen
[2:15:22] because you're cussing within yourself
[2:15:25] you don't want to cuss
[2:15:26] because people will see you but in
[2:15:27] yourself
[2:15:29] no it's too much let that thing come out
[2:15:32] let it be exposed let it come on the
[2:15:35] surface
[2:15:36] and let's go and clean it up then you
[2:15:38] won't have to worry about it
[2:15:39] but i'm saying when somebody casts him
[2:15:41] he turn around he said i'll pray for you
[2:15:44] but
[2:15:44] i'm stop he say then i knew something
[2:15:46] happened to me
[2:15:48] it was no longer by the bottom it was
[2:15:51] somebody else who was holding brother
[2:15:53] branham
[2:15:54] that's where we want you to be
[2:15:57] that's where we are taking you to amen
[2:16:00] where the burden of christ is light
[2:16:04] you bring your burden you give it to him
[2:16:06] he gives you his burden
[2:16:07] and then you ride in your life easily it
[2:16:10] is no longer you that lives it's going
[2:16:11] to be christ that lives in you
[2:16:13] period amen let's pray heavenly father

[2:16:36] people
[2:16:37] and lord protecting demon lord

[2:16:49] realizing that they were crucifying the
[2:16:51] very word
[2:16:53] that was made flesh and i was promised
[2:16:56] in
[2:16:56] lord the old testament lord father they
[2:16:59] could sit with the old testament

[2:17:27] no comfort
[2:17:28] zone beside being in christ jesus
[2:17:32] father may all that we have in our mind
[2:17:35] everything that we hold dear that we
[2:17:38] thought lord

[2:18:21] make sure that we started
