I forgot you not intentionally just know that you're welcome amen amen I believe we are up to date with the sermon and the you and the reason why I usually say we up to date because everything we're preaching the Holy Spirit keep building one thing after the other so if you lose if you never listen to 1 2 3 4 5 you can get easily lost when we in Seven 8 N9 and 10 so new subscriber everything is on YouTube so if you had a chance just go back and then catch up yourself so we make sure we on the same page amen amen so I believe we're reading our Bibles every day twice a day one chapter in the morning and one chapter and night that's the recommendation of William Marion Branham and if you believe his Prophet then you can prosper that's right amen amen we are aware of our struggle in the body but still let's aim to do what the prophet said regardless of what you're doing if you can discipline yourself yourself to look at your phone every day why can't you discipline yourself to read the Holy Scripture huh why can't you discipline yourself to read the Holy scripture when it come to your phone you don't forget it when it come to the Holy Scripture then ah I miss something no no no no no no no put it on your budget and make sure we do it and we stay with it amen so we reading our Bible twice a day we reading the C Church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or someone is Somewhere listening to the message of the hour in other word keep your head in the word when you're driving cut on the tape when you cooking put on the sermon whatever you doing doing amen when I want to sleep and I don't get no sleep it's easy for me I just C on bride brandham and the devil hates that amen amen because he knows if I can get only 10 minutes or brother Bram I can get 20 sermon amen so I know how to get sleep very easily amen if I get 30 minutes then he's in really really good [Laughter] trouble amen our next question and answer the quarterly one Lord's willing we shooting for April the 26 so you just keep that in mind and brother Glenn is working on it to confirm with the venue and uh Lord's willing on um February the 1st that is the young men meeting and then that's a Saturday then on that Sunday which is February the 2nd that's when we will have our church voting for the officer so it is this coming Sunday are we clear so February the 2nd Church officer for voting so February 1st it's the young man meeting and February the 22nd it's the young sisters meeting and then March the 22nd that's the part five of the married couple meeting like I said if your pastor is okay with it so you let us know on time we can welcome you you there because we believe in the Brotherhood amen so the Voting is next uh uh Sunday Lord's willing uh have to wait on uh brother Robert and the Deacon to work on the appreciation dinner because it's uh it's depending on the venue so when whenever we got something clear we give you the date and at the end of the service Lord's willing we will be baptizing two young sisters after the service amen so we had some time yesterday to sit and to go through water baptism and everything so God's willing then we will do it I like I said I I'm very careful to do things that pertain to God because we there was too much looseness in the message amen and I don't take chance for it amen if I want to put you in the water I need to make sure you're understanding what you're trying to do if you're not well taught I need to sit with you and make sure you understand then we can baptize you if I need to lay hand on you for marriage I need to make sure you're understanding what you're getting into you need to understand what is a husband you need to understand what is a wife because you don't want to get there and then you're trying to get out no when you get there you stay right there until the Rapture comes so I want to make sure you know exactly what you're getting into it if we need to sit 7 hours we'll sit 7 hours with you and I want to make sure you understand what is a man and what is a woman amen if you're not ready you pull back if not you find another Pastor who's going to lay hand on you not me brother Bram preached marriage and divorce because brother Bram already found the care that was already there but with this new generation I'm not preaching you so you can divorce again I'm preaching you for one shot you getting marriage and that's sa are we together the divorce cases I would deal with the old folks but the new one you get there one shot yes sir are we together so I'm not sweating here for nothing I'm not taking my weekend for nothing I'm minimizing my work so that when you married everything is happy when I ask you I say how is everything you say Pastor I never been so happy in my life I say that's it right there because the best marriages should come in this message the best marriages in this planet should come in this message those that has been in mared couple one two and three and four and four you know exactly what I'm talking about amen we need to change our perspective hallelujah hallelujah when I came this morning sister Sheron came she said we need to take a picture I say sister Sharon a picture again and then I put my suit on and she sat on my lap glory to God I have quates after Coates after Coates that I can show you your wife need to be sitting on your life don't say Amen amen are we together are we together don't worry I'll meet you on March the 22nd and I'm going to give you quot after quot after quot you need the change my friend amen happiness is not outside of your wife your wife got your happiness and your husband got your happiness now it's time to draw our own happiness and leave our marriages happily every D end am are we together are we together oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I didn't have any more question about the lollipop so I believe everybody's clear with Christmas now amen we don't celebrate Christmas always is of the devil's excuse I gave you quote after quot so that one is clear we good so now let's stand for the reading of the word ah God bless the young sister that sang this morning you were under the inspiration it is God in the singers amen when you were talking about the blood the blood the blood it was God himself amen am Oh Glory to God my subject this morning it is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 46 that's why I say I we up to date with the sermon amen amen if I get a chance where I'm supposed to go the theme today is the three applications amen of the blood of the calf or the bulock it's Sunday you usually have one service so get your pressure off of me are we together are we together uh praise God flight attendance so let's prepare for take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us to even giving us a day that is not too cold and that will be warming up Lord by the time we finish and a time that we can gather together with scent of Life precious Faith both in the visible and invisible audience father I have done what I can do by the grace that you have given me Lord I pray that now you lead me may you remove every obstacle away from us may you come Lord father and speak to our soul and move me and the audience so that you will be the one speaking and the one also listening and interpreting Lord father I have done what I can and I'm depending completely upon you Lord father seal the devil out of this place and bless your children Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God let's go to Psalm 82 almost four month with one scripture amen glory to God Amen praise God sister rof you can cut this off you can cut the one on the top of let me go with my own in the ear thank you praise God let's go to Psalm 82 if you thereare we can say Amen brother Stephen how can you stay on one scripture for four month and every day it looks like something keep coming up keep coming up when are we going to come back in the surface in P for house when you get this soaked in that's right amen glory to God verse one God stands in the congregation of the mighty he God judges among the gods you might be seated verse six I have said this is God saying you can cut this off I'm going with my thing yes please thank you I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high amen am we say this multiple time that verse six it's pertaining to our D part our divine part our clean part are we clear and then verse seven this is where the trouble is the Bible says but God himself is saying but so there is a problem right there but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes so this one is our human part or our Earthly part which is connected to sin and to fall Etc everything bad and basically last week last Sunday this is the Beast amen amen amen amen this is the quote we read last Sunday and according to this quote brother Bram say that let us make men in our own image and if if he made man in his own image he made a supernatural being we clear it together amen yes indeed Genesis 1:28 read and see if this is not right and then when he made man in his own image he had ruler over the beasts so the supernatural being amen rules the Beast the supernatural being rule have rulership over the Beast over the Beast we okay okay praise God he says and he led the beasts around them like the holy spirit is supposed to lead the church so man was the Holy Ghost of the Beast there [Applause] is my friend can you say amen amen let me go back again and read brother Bram it's the same quote now I'm going deeper if you start like this I won't even preach what I'm trying to preach right brother Joshua okay so he leted the Beast R then like the water holy spirit is supposed to lead what that is what so the one that was leading animals was not God come take time please can you say Amen the one that was leading animal was man man became the Holy Ghost to the animals I know it sounds like that's why I'm still in this place until you swallow it then I move on are we together man the supernatural being here became the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost off the Beast the Holy Ghost off the Beast I thought last Sunday you already swall good but it looks like I need to sh that again Hallelujah brother Bram say and then he say there is no man to do what so I'm trying to refrain myself from saying something here there was no man to do what and if you notice when Cain and Abel came K was a tealer of the Soul he Master on the Beast [Applause] side it's written in your Bible do you know that do you know that you don't know how many knows okay some don't know open Genesis 4 you the one that started this thing read your chapter one in the morning one before you go to bed amen Genesis chapter 4 if you dare you can say Amen Adam and Eve have two supposingly children come on now brother according to denomination one is abble one is Cain but for some reason for some reason abble doesn't tilt the ground for some reason abble who is in brother Abel he's back there who is in the lineage of Adam the lineage of God sir doesn't K the soil he became a [Music] Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd I am the shepherd to the shipold that's where abble went don't worry my friend uh let's go to verse one and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bore who and he said I I have gotten a man from The Lord of course it's a law you can get a baby in wedlock or in adultery it's still a baby but the ACT is wrong in adultery don't say Amen my friend let me continue and she again bore his brother who ab and Abel was a keeper of what she but can was a tealer of what can master in Genesis 2:7 yes he did am amen he improved more on the beastly side because he was among the Beast don't worry my friend you can read this at home amen he says there is no man to K the soul so he created remember even their offering he offer the offering from the ground and he was rejected right and Ever by faith ever by by faith offer a sacrifice excellent than C because C offered by the beast wow amen are we together are we together when Adam sinned did God curse Adam he cursed what he cursed what and Kain when he was born he's working way on the curse [Applause] side are we together when Adam sin God kill a lamb right why did AB burn and he love [Applause] [Music] Lambs now now I hope we together ah glory to God brother Bram said there is no man to til the soul so he created man Out of the Dust of the earth now he might have given him a hand like what a monkey and a foot like what a bear I don't know what he did but he put him into what s and he put this supernatural being amen which was called what the third person of the Trinity I read this last Sunday the third person of the Trinity the what holy spirit so man is what Holy [Applause] Spirit put your seat belt my friend you're taking too long to leave the airport amen father means god with what God above us and then son mean what Emmanuel God With Us amen and the Holy Spirit is God where in us God in us amen are we together this one Jesus fulfill it hallu are we together thenes Jesus say it is expedient for me to go so that I can send you the what the comforter which is the holy
