sermon let me see your hand thank you foreign book and their Church ages yeah I need to do more praying yeah we need praying there is no more time we need to go home amen yes this is not a message like a Catholic message where the priests have everything and the congregation do nothing that's not the message of the hour we have the same material the same Bible the same resources so it's your duty as a Believer to be able to read the message to listen to the tab the same as we do so when we're preaching we are together on the same page amen even though you don't understand something then the Holy Spirit when he quickens that portion of the word that you already have in you it's going to be easier for you to catch it so I will encourage you it's not a good habit for your hand to be always down okay I can prove you are more busier than you amen glory to God our question and answer will be on February the 18th brother Kelly will let me know by God's grace when the if our secret meeting place is back uh uh to working then we will go ahead and do it there if not so you will receive on the chart on the WhatsApp chat the young sister's meeting is on February the 25th make sure you get your question as soon as possible and it's going to be at three o'clock you know the place I'm on YouTube I'm not going to tell you amen amen I don't know who was struggling for this quote but it's not connected my brother the computer is not connected but I'm going to put it up there I don't know whether it's in this church or it's somewhere into the world somebody was looking for this code but the big boss told me to put it again so whoever was looking for this coat who has been mistreated or something here it is brother Branham says that another thing after she does that after she has fulfilled her vow talking about a woman and took her marriage and took her husband to be named the braj gum name then she is water I need a microphone here and I need the brother right here amen she is hair of water so whoever is looking for this may be in Africa maybe in America maybe in South America God wants you to get it amen your prayer has been answered and the big boss reminded me so she's air of water everything he watered so whatever you have brother it belongs to your wife so stop saying it is my car it is my house it is our car it is our house it is our money whether you work as a sister or whether you work as a brother both of your money goes together oh my God did you hear me in this message we don't believe in separate accounting everybody okay where the wife have her money doing her own thing and the husband have his money doing his own thing that is wrong Mama bring your paycheck daddy bring your paycheck and mix it together [Applause] so young sister if you get a lot of money before you get married don't worry when you're married you take that money and his money and you put it together [Music] money anyway I'm talking to this church is one of the major things one of the other one I'm quiet because I know why I don't want you all to know that I will talk only to married people okay there are certain things that causes headache in marriage everybody okay the other one I keep it quiet okay I will talk to the couple if you want to know about it get married okay then I'll talk to you over there everybody okay but money is one of them that causes a lot of headache in the couple let me help you out money is one that causes predict in the couple in the message foreign [Applause] it's nothing that argument is nothing chase the argument down because that's the ministry we got I'm not somebody that you call my wife say shut up and I'm mad that's not the problem I'm not going to stop there I need to know why did your wife say shut up [Applause] brother Branham say Aura Robert they just bring people pray for them and you go and before you know it the sickness come back not this message when brother Branham you come to your case he need to see why are you sick because sickness is a result of sin we need to know what was the problem so when you come in you say my wife say this my husband said this I need to stop and hear from the other side what happened everybody okay everybody okay so stop saying my car foreign I am fully independent [Applause] everybody okay I don't have a big preacher that I need to please I don't have a bishop there is only one Bishop that I have it's written in the Bible the bishop of my soul and his name is Jesus Christ everybody okay that's what the scripture say Amen so I don't have something that's what makes me really really happy because I'm not going to preach somebody something here and be afraid so and so over there we get mad on it I'm free if it's in the Bible and if it's in the message you're gonna get it where they understand or not then she's here of water everything hippo says she is the hair of water everything your wife is an air of water everything you possess so whoever was praying for this keep it take a screenshot frame it and put it on a living room [Applause] when I speak like this you have a problem when CNN tell you show you two men kissing you don't have a problem you only have a problem with me amen don't worry my friend all right glory to God already announced the church the young Sisters Meeting I give you the quote for whoever was praying for it and after the voting today I will set up a date I will try to see if I can coordinate I miss there is a meeting coming up for the technician and the musician on Saturday I missed that but you already planned for something you go ahead and do it but I will try to find one where I can sit with all the technicians all the church workers and let's talk about how does the church operate and what do we require for you to be operating in the church amen and how do we move people in the church and how have things happen amen amen all right we go into our voting brother Branham say now with our head bowed not only our head but our hearts and as every member of which church this church dot comes to hear how regular number one Ellen supported with your water and water offerings so you know what you're doing with God money you know where you are whether you come regular or whether you support it with your task and offering some people are sick they can't make it here but they're regular on streaming I understand that one the problem I have is when you come and I say what was the last sermon then it's three weeks down that's the problem everybody okay so a member according to brother Branham is somebody who come out regular and who supported with water and watering that's the one who's going to vote this morning everybody okay so the Deacon are gonna pass you the ballot the new trustee that I have after looking at many things there is one that I could not take because I won't tell you the name because of certain reason I'm not going to tell you why there's only one it's going to be

brother Kalima you might be seated my brother thank you brother John Porter and brother Kalima you will pick up the uh offering basket and you take the ballot you write your choices whether it's yes or no and Buddy John and Buddy Kalima whatever you see you go to heaven with it okay brother John whatever you see it's not going to your family or to your wife you go to heaven with it the only person you can tell is me and when you finish you put it up together no officer we'll see that you give it to me and I take it home and I'll keep it as a backup for the church in case they say did you do the vote I say these are the vote and these are how we get the officer amen if I get a 3 000 people church or something then we can go with the raising of the hand but I have to move the camera to make sure they see people raising hand for my bike up everybody okay so if you need to vote let's go ahead and bow ahead while we praying Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we are human being subject to error but we are serving the great God who is infallible and who doesn't make error father that's why we pray that you must run out the human element may you move our feelings away every carnal thinking away but may the holy spirit in the lives of your children Express his own will through this voting according to the order that you have given us by the messenger of this attack father we humbly ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen raise your hand and they give you the ballot and then brother Kalima brother John you pick it up you know what to do I will get it toward the end thank you you follow the leading of the holy spirit in your heart don't look at somebody else you do it for yourself when you finish please fold it and then they will get it glory to God mm-hmm Soldier in the department of the Lord in the army I'm just giving you your time in the army of the Lord in the army of the Lord hmm in the army of the Lord if I preach that mystery in the army of the Lord I was thinking that at home myself putting my own things let's say it's the seven seal reveal in the army of the Lord I was singing that myself the third Pope the seven thunders in the army so don't say to her that's my own inspiration at home when I get excited and the word is opening up then I can sing in the army of the Lord um praise the Lord foreign if you got it you can all already get prepared for the scriptures you would need your bubble today you will need your Bible today okay okay I told you could be an Avenue you have not traveled so stay up stay awake everything will be okay yes sir any more anybody else clear praise God anyone okay let's go to our scripture Genesis chapter 18. glory to God verse 1 if you dare you can say amen amen Oh Glory to God and the Lord remember on Sunday appeared to him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day God appeared we need to work with some words today God appeared to Abraham amen that's the first thing we can see there is an appearance of God but that appearance God made himself flesh not in Jesus the man okay verse 2 and he lift up his eyes and look and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he run to meet them from the tent door and bow himself toward the ground you might be seated and say my Lord so the one who appeared we know it's the Lord which we understand now that it's Elohim everybody okay thank you glory to God and say my Lord if now I have found favor in your sight pass not away I pray from your servant job to verse 9. he came you know the story eating and everything he says and they say to him where is Sarah your wife and he say behold in the tent I explained this last week and he say I will certainly water return so after the appearing God have to leave and who turn so there is an appearance in appearing and a return but when he returned we don't know amen there is only one way you would know that God return how are you going to know and he said I will certainly return to you according to the time of what life the time of life is not one day so we don't know which day but we can now calibrate everybody okay glory to God and Lord Sarah your wife shall have a water the Sun so if Sarah got pregnant it means that God return everybody okay but Sarah cannot get pregnant because she's already old stricken in years the Bible says and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well watered shrickening in other words there is no way Grandma can have a baby but if you see Grandma changing and becoming Young amen then you know God return so if this return is not a public return everybody okay it is a secret return and it's a return that will be accompanied with a body change correcting the bareness of Sarah because Sarah now is not just going to be a young woman because if Sarah is only turned to a young woman she's going to be Barren again everybody okay because she was young and buried so the changing doesn't change her only to normal but I mean to be young but it changed also Sarah by correcting whatever was wrong in her body we okay now praise the name of the Lord while streaking in age verse 11 and he sees to be with Sarah after the manner of water woman women plural amen you know what he means job to verse 14. is anything too hard for the Lord at the time water appointed I will water return so God knows that time himself he didn't say to Abraham I will return in January the 23rd he didn't say that he himself knows and it's a specific time it's a specific date it's a time appointed it's specific but known only to God not everybody amen in other words you stay on the expectation one of this day I will return When you don't know I don't know but if you stay on the expectation that day you will not take you anywhere you can tell that hey Abraham what's going on somebody's here you turn around oh I'm looking different then you know the master is back everybody okay that was verse 14 at the appointed time I will return to you according to the time of life we already went through this the number 28 and Sarah shall have a son if you notice Sarah was married all along but never had a song despite how many Intimate Relationships she had with her husband zero the son only come after the appearing of the Lord everybody okay roof was married before did she has a baby she only have a baby with Boaz after she received the sixth measure of barley then boys return to pick her up that's when rufa got a baby we okay now praise the Lord put the election behind you okay just relax and the Lord please and the Lord say because the Cry of Sodom verse 20 and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very water Grievous God was coming to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah you know the story so this coming disappearing of the Lord amen when he finished with Abraham God went and destroyed Sodom so it's an appearing that is coupled with judgment you will need this thing let's go to John chapter 12. mm-hmm Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus you dare you can say amen amen verse 23. and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the who son of man should be how glorified we know the son of man have two forms now we're clear on that one the son of man need to be glorified and we know the son of man have to form his first water what the word which we call the logos which we call the theophany which we call the pillar of Fire everybody okay and Melchizedek Etc or he is the flesh which we know is the body which we call the corporal everybody okay he says the son of man should be glorified jump to verse 27 I'm skipping you can read this at home yourself now is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I to this hour verse 28 father glorify your name if you notice in verse 23 he said the son of man which is the man Jesus Christ must be glorified but if you see here he say glorify your name everybody okay we got the person and we got the name amen it's not complicated my friend he said father glorify your name verse 28. then came there a voice from Heaven saying a voice you remember this from Sunday I have both water glorify it so the name of God was already glorified because remember when he was created he was created better than angels you remember that and he was giving a name better than the name of the angel that's why even the disciple when they were sent they came back rejoicing saying Master we noticed something when we cast our devil in your name something is happening so the name of Jesus was already glorified everybody okay I have both glorified comma and I will glorify it how again so the name must be glorified again are we together the people therefore that stood by and heard it say that he thundered so the voice is a thunder and others say an angel spoke to him so the voice is a thunder it's an angel we clear on that one everybody okay go to chapter 13. let me skip this because Jesus is saying the son of man the person is going to be glorified then he says the name is going to be glorified if you're on chapter 13 you can say amen amen verse 31. therefore when it when he was gone gone out Jesus said now everybody okay is the Hope son of man how glorified another word the name and the person goes together everybody okay you cannot magnify or glorify the person without exalting his name everybody okay everybody okay when Jesus was both glorified here the son of man his name already was also glorified amen but God said that he will glorify his name again meaning that he's going to glorify the person again everybody okay the Bible says this in the book of act that John say on verse 7 chapter 7 verse 39 but this speak he of the water spirit which they that believe on him should water receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet how given because that Jesus was not yet what glorified but Jesus is saying here that I he already have glorified him foreign can we read it again verse 31 therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now not in the future is the son of man how glorified and God is glorified in water in him so Jesus was already glorified the first time which glorify his name everybody okay but there is a second glorification watch verse 32 if God be glorifying him God shall future a second glorification everybody okay shy also glorify him in water himself and shall immediately glorify water him so there is two glorification we okay now that's why the Bible says here that he's going to be glorified after his glorification that's when the Holy Ghost comes that's not the first glorification because I have both glorify him and I will glorify him again everybody okay the Bible says in the book of act 3 after the Holy Ghost came on act two right okay when the Holy Ghost come it means that Jesus is what glorified so act three is after act two the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of our father has done water glorified his son who Jesus so the first glorification happen during your life you remember the son of man and glorification but the second glorification happened at the resurrection when his body have changed everybody okay the first glorification touches your soul the first translation touches your soul the first change you receive touches your soul the first Rapture you receive I have the quote you are raptured first in your soul that's why you live above the things of the world that's why you don't belong to this world again that's why you became air traveling a stranger a pilgrim on this Earth because inside of you you are from another world everybody okay but you need to be also glorified translate change on the outside amen and when Jesus was glorified the second time the Bible says this Philippians 2 verse 8 and 11 and being found in a fashion as a man he did what humble himself and became how obedient death even the death of water because Jesus is dead now what happened after his death because after his death his glorified what happened to Jesus let me ask you a question you slowing me down okay let me ask you a question when you say Jesus when Jesus was alive when he was approaching a man that has Devils what was the demon saying what have we to do with you Son of God you are coming to torment us before our time his name was already bigger he was already exalted everybody okay everybody okay but if you go to Pilot and you say power to Jesus was he making palliative Fred when you talk to the Pharisee you say do you know there is a man Jesus Christ did he make them afraid but watch what the second glorification does are we okay now are we okay now today the demon are subject to you but your neighbor is not afraid of you that's right your boss at work doesn't feel you he can yell at you because you are not glorified the second time yet do you follow me do you follow me but when you are glorified the second time then your boss will know who you are everybody okay then you never would know who you are look at the second glorification after the death of the Cross amen what happened wherefore in other words as a result of this God also has water highly exalt him everybody okay and giving him a water which is above water every name which he already has everybody okay that at the name of who Jesus how many nieces every knee not at the beginning some people didn't bow to him amen every knee should water wow or figs in the water heaven and things in water and things where and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus is water lord so after the glorification of Jesus Christ Whoever has a tongue one of this day Whoever has it all if you are born you have a tongue don't worry when Jesus come you're going to recognize him to be king whether you like him or not whether you hate him or not you will bow down before him everybody okay everybody okay [Applause] glory to God go to Romans chapter 8. he got glorified the first time and he was glorified again and the bride also is glorified but we need to see when is the bride going to be glorified again everybody okay amen amen hallelujah Romans 8 chapter 18. if you dare you can say amen amen oh my God for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory you see which shall be revealed in water so there is also a glory a glorification that will be revealing you and the suffering you're going now as a Christian being glorified already inside by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you cannot compare that to the glorification that is coming we okay have I lost anyone let's pray and may God keep you up Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us Lord we are committing once again this service unto their hand father you blessed us through the song of Zion and Lord you have given us such a good opportunity that we can be found in the message of the center father may you move me completely out of the way may you come Lord and minister to all of us may every demonic Spirit be outside of this place but may the Holy Spirit only and the elect Angel come in this place and father unfold your word to your children in Jesus precious name amen my subject this morning is the subject of that was supposed to be handled last Sunday the four phases of roof the son of man revealed or coming let me say it again the son of man revealed it is also called a coming everybody okay we are navigating between the threshing floor Ruth chapter 3 and roof chapter 4 where the son of man boas unfolded himself into roof by six measure of Bali then we found Boaz coming back again everybody okay and to pick up roof and from there like I already explained it roof had a baby not before everybody okay in a tabernacle language when we move from this era of roof and we're going to the Tabernacle we are now in roof resting from roof deciding roof serving now roof resting and we are also in between the resting and the rewarding and the rewarding of Ruth is taking her out completely which means the Rapture brother Branham explained to us everybody okay now open Matthew chapter 16. as we begin to climber I want you all to have your scripture if I get to where I'm supposed to get that would nail your headache in the message your 50 years of headache of 50 more years of headache in the message Matthew chapter 16. if you dare you can say amen amen verse 27 follow me carefully please if you need to take note take note Matthew 16 verse 27 if you dare you can say amen amen for verse 27 for the son of man shall come it's in the future follow me carefully he shall come in glow in the glory of his father with his water Angels Angels so there is here a coming of the son of man I'm going slowly stay up the son of man will come the son of man will come and when he come he's coming with who Angels plus angels which coming is this hmm we need to know I'm going slowly now which coming the son of man shall come with his angels and then he shall do what reward every man according to his water works so this coming God is coming to bring judgment to every man everybody okay is Jesus At The Rapture is he coming to bring judgment to every man a Rapture is a sacred you know that right so this coming the first coming of Jesus Christ when he came as a man did he brought judgment to every man can you work with that light please just relax it's the devil it's not whoever touches the light okay they didn't do anything I know what is coming up here okay so just relax he's at he's upset okay this coming Jesus is coming with Angel to reward every man everybody care in other words to bring judgment to every man the first coming Jesus came to die for you did he bring judgment to everybody no no the second coming will everybody see him so this is the third coming of God everybody okay come on are we together this coming is the third coming of God I want you to follow me carefully everybody okay verse 28 that was verse 27 verse 28. verily I say unto you you learn now how to read the scripture okay verily I say unto you there be some when they say Psalm it means it's more than one person if you have a problem I have a quote brother Branham says some is more than one person so I can you can get it now from the dictionary or I can back it up with the code you tell me I put it on WhatsApp okay Sam means it's more than one person we clear please stay up there will be some there be some standing here so these people were with Jesus which shall not test water in other words some of the Apostles won't die some of the disciples won't die until what comma until they see who the son of man how coming in his Water Kingdom so there is another coming here verse 27 the son of man is coming but he's coming to bring judgment that's not for us because the bride is judged with him at the cross it doesn't belong to me but we found out that Jesus said the son of man is coming in his Water Kingdom stay up I know what I'm talking about now there is another coming of the son of man and he's coming in his kingdom that's what he says right that's right in his kingdom what does he mean coming in his kingdom God is saying that among my disciples some of them won't die until the sea the son of man coming in his Water Kingdom who's speaking Jesus Christ so some of the disciples must see that we okay let's go to chapter 17. verse 1. glory to God father please help me with time foreign this is not something I have to preach and cut off okay it is loaded for Generation until the Rapture it will help you up you there amen first one and after how many days six days stop [Applause] the first day [Applause] recognizing you and each one message on the Book of Genesis chapter one a day was called a light [Applause] so Jesus waited the first day the second day the third day the fourth day the sixth and the fifth day the sixth day after that after the sixth day we can argue eight is after six right no no not oh yes eight is after six that's correct nine is after six a hundred is after six a thousand is after six one million is after six all we know here ask the water six days let's stop there [Applause] God after sixth day is bringing how many disciple three disciple in other words this coming Jesus is now fulfilling it because he says some of you won't die I'm gonna until they see me how coming now he's fulfilling it but this happened after 60. glory to God verse one and after sixth day Jesus Takes hope Peter and who James and who John how many three he fulfilled some at the beginning when Jesus says some everybody can speculate you can say 10 disciple to disciple five disciple is some but now the son must be through him everybody okay you cannot bring us in full because Jesus picked the son so let's repeat Jesus three disciples I'm gonna I'm not gonna even touch them because it's a problem with their name who they are let's stay on the surface everybody okay everybody okay some of them are the sons of Thunders but let me leave it alone okay the boss is is moving here everybody okay and he took them and brother and bring them up to a water high mountain are you following me are you following me in other words Jesus is not fulfilling this he's fulfilling this because some of you must see me verse 2 and he was how transfigurated trash figure metamorphosis that's what the scripture says you know the Frog you remember the Frog okay so somebody's changing remember the Jesus that is climbing in the mountain is a human being I'm going slowly are we okay [Applause] so the Jesus that is going to fulfill this is a corporal he's a human being relax my friend it's a human being a human Jesus a flesh Jesus a natural Jesus glory to God and that natural Jesus begin to change are you following me he was transfigured before them and his water face shine as the water so when Jesus was changed Hallelujah his face begin to rise yet like the sun [Applause] you need to know who you're gonna see and how you gonna see him [Music] I want to see my husband buddy so when I mean the cloud I say that's him right there [Applause] everybody okay I don't want to guess so his face look like water the Sun remember that and his water was white as the water light so it's a Jesus natural but when you look at him he saw his son like the sun and his clothing are like light his clothing are like the light what happened I want you to speak the scripture don't play with words so when they enter the mountain something happened to Jesus amen Jesus changed follow me carefully Jesus is fulfilling he's coming amen when he change number one his face changed his government changed okay discharge trigger something else are you following me would you give me time I cannot run with this I have to go slowly what is the trigger verse 3 and behold there appear to her damn who Moses and water Elias talking with water so Moses and Elijah never appeared until Jesus changed are you following me so the change of Jesus activate Moses and Elijah the Bible didn't say Elijah and Moses scripture don't play with words the Bible says who Moses and who Elias glory to God [Applause] so this changes when it happened it triggered Moses in other words when Jesus is the human being said Moses left where he was Elijah also left and they hold the hand they come they say what is going on [Laughter] Elijah oh Lord help me you there you there we on verse three we there job 2 verse 9. and follow I'm skipping if you dare you can say amen amen verse now and as they come down from the mountain you know the remaining of the story Jesus charged them saying tell the water the vision stop so what happened in the mountain was the water vision make sure you got your bubble so this is a vision Jesus told them that some of you won't die until they see who the son of man coming in his Water Kingdom and he picked Peter John and uh and James and showed them a vision and in the vision they see Jesus changing and when he changed Moses and Elijah comes stop right there what's going on everybody okay everybody okay until the son of man be risen again from the water dead watch and his disciple ask him saying why them they never ask him this question so when they were in Monte civilization they saw Moses and who Elijah but the disciple we're more triggered toward Elijah are you following me so when they come they ask not Moses why then says the script that who a lion must do whatever so this Vision here of the coming of the Lord has a connection with the coming of Elijah foreign ER is perfectly in line with the scripture the message and the Bible are one everybody okay so there is something to do with the coming of God in his kingdom bless Elijah [Applause] but the disciples are saying you show us the second coming but how can the second coming come but Elijah must come [Music] [Laughter] if you left this message and you sneak in some time to watch me to monitor me today is your day [Applause] keep watching my friend I will re-baptize you again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to accept this message as the Vindicated right for this hour [Applause] we okay Jesus now answer verse 11 and Jesus answered say to them Elijah truly water means water shall first come and do whatever restore all things in other words Jesus said yes that coming is coupled with Elijah and that Elijah must come first and restore water all peace [Applause] [Music] a restoring Elijah [Music] this is where Pentecostal get trouble watch now verse 13 if I stop here they say brother Stephen skip verse 12 he's afraid no I'm not afraid I'm gonna get in verse 12. let's go to verse 12. in other words it's a contradiction but not end but hey I say to you that Elijah is what come already this is where Pentecostal trouble and they knew him not but have done to him whatsoever the water likewise shall also the water son of man or son of man suffer of water damn Jesus is saying Elijah came and they kill him the same way Elijah died that's how they're gonna kill me which Elijah is this let's look at verse 13. then the disciple understood that he spoke of to them of who John the Baptist so John the Baptist is the Elijah that was already came and that the kill already and Jesus is saying they're gonna kill me like they killed John the Baptist [Applause] but verse 11 is an Elijah [Applause] you situated you see two Elijah's glory to God where am I at go to Luke chapter 9. father help me let's go to Hope Luke chapter 9. when I say father help me is the the pipe that is the pressure that is coming to come out is so high and as a Shepherd I have to make sure I don't bust any pipe so you need to receive water according to the size of your pipe okay so I need to look at the pressure everybody okay so now me I'm the one who's about to bust because I have to say to monitor the pressure everybody okay but the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet hey everybody okay Luke chapter 9 verse 26 if you dare you can say amen amen you there amen Hallelujah for whatsoever shall be a shame of me and of my word of him shall the who son of man remember we're talking about the son of man the son of man be water a shame when he shall come in his own glory and in his father and of the Holy Water Angels now we found out that when he come with the Holy Angel which coming is it again the same scripture the third coming but remember in Matthew after the third coming what follow the second coming watch again in Luke what is following verse 27 but I tell you the truth a contradiction that not a contradiction to the scripture but something open something separate yeah no he said the Bible have contradiction ah but I tell you a truth there'd be some standing where here which shall not test death until they see the kingdom of water God over here he called that the coming in his kingdom over there they say the kingdom of who God everybody okay watch carefully verse 28 you there amen and he came to pass about eight day come on now brother did you see that he came to pass a bad water if they stop let's take Matthew and look and let's put him together are we okay now we okay now you know your math right according to Matthew it was after six days amen according to Luke it is about what about eight day so which number is missing in the middle [Music] which number is missing seven so this event happened on which day seventh day everybody okay everybody okay but it doesn't happen at the beginning of the 70. it happened when it's about in other words almost at the end in other words the coming of the Lord in the age of laodicea won't be at the beginning when laodicea is just that bad to be finished that's when Jesus Will Come [Applause] everybody okay now this is the show the James let me leave that alone I don't want to handle that now everybody okay everybody okay so the second coming of Jesus Christ when it happened it will happen not on the first age recognizing your day and his message not on the first age not on the first message not on the second message not on the third message it will happen on the seventh message toward the end of that day when it's just about there and eight is the number of water so just about that time we're gonna blend with eternity [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay my glory to God where am I at God help me verse 28 and he came to pass about Eighth Day after this saying he took her Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to do what pray and as he prayed that water fashion remember that word the fashion of his continence was water altered and his remainment was white and water and be all dare talk with him of two men which were who Moses the first one it's always Moses and who Elias stop what does this mean everybody okay with your Marion brother you know what the real Greek says he done interest figure before them he did what changed his fashion everybody okay now this only thing he done he took off his water of Water humanity and become in the water glorified state oh I will show you how glorification happened not today How You Gonna Change okay amen he changed his water fashion what was he redoing here he was revealing himself in another fashion what was he in eh glorified transfigure water condition he is coming the way he is coming a water glorify Christ how transform his womb that shine like the sun my oh he stood in the crowd and he's coming in the cloud of water Glory of a shadow by water the cloud not only the white turned the head up here but a cloud that he came in is a cloud of water Glory all his water angels with him Hallelujah Mike that is the way he is he's coming in the water Cloud of Glory everybody okay now so we found out that this is a glorified Jesus what does he mean my friend offer in this place then he saw the water coming all the water rehearsal because he was a vision God took them and played the movie put the tape put the DVD and push play and when they look they say oh so this is how the second coming will be but if you notice it was sealed what does Moses mean what does Elijah mean everybody okay he says what was the first think he saw the first thing he saw in the camp in the coming was who Moses represented the water that will be how Resurrected because Moses died and he rose again everybody okay so when Jesus demand the human cents and become glorified everybody okay he will pull the scent [Music] from the graveyard everybody okay he did it with the Old Testament Moses represented the dead center that will be resurrected Elijah was standing where oh I want you to notice what will take place there was who Moses first first that is all the water six ages that slept the water six Church ages not only that but Elijah was the messenger of the water last day with his water the water amen now in the future awaiting the water coming [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so now we found out that Moses and Elijah represented the church Moses represented that scent that I Elijah represented those that would not die but won't remain until the coming of the Lord but they will be changed in the twinkling at the trumpet of God or the dead of Christ will do what and we together will meet the Lord in there both of them are represented in what Moses and Elijah stop the first application of Moses of Elijah is the church who preached to the hundred and forty four thousand [Applause] so Moses of Elijah have two companies everybody okay in other words when Jesus the glorified Jesus come who Sean likes the Sun and his Remnant is like the light that Jesus will first Resurrected you follow me and then he would change those that I love everybody okay and then he will also open Moses and Elijah to go back to the Jewish people are folding the sixth Hill okay [Applause] let's go slowly William Marion Branham I do know that this Minister behind me may be wondering because in water so he was showing the water second coming of who Christ that is the water we'll wait to approach it it is the second coming of Christ because Jesus said I will show you none of some of you won't die until I show you brother Branham say for it showed Facebook Jesus glorify second the message to the water Jews which will be the water of Revelation water eleven Moses and water and when they look back they saw who Jesus only but the word of God is so his power I guess that's the entire water Bible ties together on everywhere you could preach the water Second Coming you could preach water Divine Healing you could preach water Resurrection oh anywhere in the Bible from any place in the Bible show me another book that can produce that in other words Moses and Elijah are most that directional they can be applied to the second coming they can also be applied to the two witness that is going back to the Jews to take the hundred and forty four thousand help me Father glory to God here is the two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to water the nature they want to and they set the Earth and it shows exactly who does it it is who Moses and who Elijah because there is the water Ministry we impersonate it again it is who both men see what the six seal is it is just what prophets don't let it shock you but watch what opened that seal the water prophets why because after the Rapture the blood is removed from the Altar and the tribulation Period start then Moses and Elijah must appear straight ahead and begin to bring judgment to the word and take the 144 000. everybody okay so now we understand the order of the second coming number one do we must see an appearance of the human being Jesus in a glorified State he is appearing well where's the dead change those that He Love pick up the bread and give way to Moses and Elijah to go and to stop preaching to the Jews and to open the tribulation everybody okay so far but when they saw Jesus his face shine like water the sun opened revelation 10. [Music] father help me glory to God Revelation 10 verse 1. are you there are you there amen are you there amen and I saw another Mighty water angel in Transfiguration it was a human being are we okay 50 years of trouble in one Transfiguration it was a vision The Book of Revelation is also air vision that's right The Book of Revelation is also a vision and in that Vision this one was the human the flesh now we find that that it is a mighty angel means an angel amen what happened to that angel a mighty angel came also water so there is a coming down let me make it simple there is a coming a mighty angel coming down coming down from where Heaven Jesus also will be coming down from where Heaven everybody okay coming that so we got two Vision the first vision is the order of the rapture now we found another Vision here with another angel a man the angel coming down from heaven cloth with a water cloud so the description also is about the clothing remember more Transfiguration it was a description of the face and the clothing remember that here they start with the clothing we must see his face also cloth with a cloud and a rainbow rolls upon his head and he is what face was as he were there son and his feet as water Pillar of Fire this one his face also looks like the sun his clothing all like the cloud and his feet are like what pillars of Fire everybody okay in more Transfiguration did Jesus that have the fish that look like a son was the second coming which triggered the rapture now we found an angel his face also like the sun what is this and he's also coming which coming is this when he comes verse 2 he head in his hand a little water book open what is that book the book of redemption which is what your Bible okay but the Bible that is how okay he come with a little hand a a a book in his hand open and he set his foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth we went through that and he cried with fill out voices as when a lion roeth and when he had cried seven Thunders did water I heard their voice let's stop right there more Transfiguration face like the sun this one face like the Sun but we know that monk Transfiguration is the second coming in preview in vision and Jesus said I will show them now there is another Vision where energy comes with a face like a son what coming also down what is this coming let's see first who is this angel with the American brother if you notice that is who Christ because he in the Old Testament was called the angel of the water Covenant he is directly coming to the water Jews now for the church is what finish brother Branham you need the Holy Ghost to listen to him relax read the scripture he said his face as the world the water son and his feet has water you remember that angel in Revelation one which was the judge let me keep it quiet ER messenger and he's a messenger to what Israel the church has been watered watch William Branham now all he is fixing to be raptured he come for his Water Church brother pranam is saying this Angel is coming when the church is fixing to be rapture it is not the Rapture but the church is fixing to be let's go slowly this coming is before the rapture what for why I'm going slowly it is crushed as the angel over there he was crushed as a human are we okay now we saw the same thing which was who Christ but these quotes are in the seals so I don't have argument okay we saw the same thing maybe not you maybe online okay we saw the same thing which was who Christ and we know Christ is always the messenger to the church all right he is caught the water Pillar of Fire the angel of water Covenant the son of man as the word is the water or the water Pillar of Fire who is Christos we Okay we okay if this coming is like the Sun but brother Branham say it is not the rapture but in the rapture we see him the face like the sun a human being here we saw a ninja a pillar of fire face like the sun coming brother Brian I'm saying he comes when the church is fixing to Rapture why is he coming Luke chapter 18. if I can cross this then we begin to go quickly let's go Luke chapter 18. glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen everybody there pages are turning I have to wait for you you got to see this maybe you won't understand this but if the Lord tell you in two years you turn around you say praise the Lord now I see and it will clear the foolishness everybody okay everybody okay verse two you there amen Jesus is saying there was in the city and what a judge the parable is about a judge a judge which field not God need a regarded man and there was a water Widow it's a widow woman and a judge I'm still waiting for it to soak it is roof a widow woman and a judge we okay now we okay this is what the Parables say we okay job 2 verse 6. and the Lord say hear what the ancestor judge says verse 7 and shall not who God do what avenge stop stop stop God is doing water so God become the judge everybody okay everybody okay God start with a parable about a widow woman who lost her first husband because Paul said that our first husband also Must Die so that we can be married to the next husband now that has been Paul is saying there is a widow woman and a judge and Paul is not oh I'm sorry Jesus is applying God himself as the just judge he's saying look at the unjust judge God who is the child shall he not what avenge so God as a judge bringeth judgment he's bringing judgment to those that are opposing the way the woman and he is justifying the cause of the widow woman are you following me God as a judge must defend a widow woman against her opposite party bring judgment on the opposite party and free the widow woman everybody okay verse 7 and shall not God avenge his own water elect so that woman with the woman is an elect woman are we okay an elect woman which cried day and night to him though he bear along with them you ready I tell you that he will do what avenge them how speedily nevertheless when the who son of man stop not Son of God Son Of Who man when the son of man do what come here stop so there is a coming of the son of man everybody okay and this coming the son of man is coming as a judge to justify a woman and to attack her body are you following me are you following me the son of man is coming watch the son of when the son of man cometh comma shall he find water faith on water the Earth stop Jesus say the son of man will be coming we know that amen we know the son of man who are coming in human flesh when he come he will be in the air and the resurrection will take place and we go to the Rapture Jesus is saying the son of man coming but Jesus is concerned he said the son of man cometh but I wanna make sure before me coming to resurrect descent and to translate to the sand I need to make sure there is a faith this faith is not the faith of healing [Applause] everybody okay it is a faithful that concerned the coming [Applause] in other words there must be a faith in the church that will pull Jesus down [Applause] that you must be a faith for the coming a faith for the rapture [Applause] everybody okay so before the second coming Faith must be founded not any kind of Faith but rapturing faith but Faith cometh by water hearing hearing what the word stop in Revelation 10. when the angel came he came with a book that is what open to produce water faith Have I Lost You let me start it again first cometh by water hearing hearing water the world so before Faith Comes A word must come to produce let the faith [Applause] the problem we're trying to find which coming is this this one we know but Revelation 10 this one of Matthew Matthew and Luke we know it is the second coming but Revelation 10 which coming is it all we know is a nature that came with a book that is what open and the book is the Bible that become what everybody okay and Jesus said before I come according to Matthew and look there must be a safe that's why the disciple were worrying about Elijah [Applause] they say hey we saw Elijah there but Elijah must come Jesus said yes Elijah will come and restore water all things and Jesus now begin to worry about their faith here but Faith cometh by water hearing hearing water and in reference in 10 we see the mighty angel coming with the word to produce death that is needed for the coming of the Lord are you there I see some of you like this so I don't know where is your interest everybody okay everybody okay what are you trying to say brother Branham he says this the Bible says this our church did before God the Lord Jesus Christ who shall what judge so the judge is who Christ they're quick and the dead add his water appearing evil is Water Kingdom stop eight has four days laid up for me a crown of righteousness which there Lord the righteous who judge shall give me at that day and not only me me only but all to all also who love his what appearing that is true looking for that blessed hope of a water watches appear glorious glorious appearing of the wolf great God and who I'll save you Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from our iniquity and purify unto himself a water peculiar people jealous of water good work so there is a glorious appearing and that appearing is a church about that glory to God brother Branham interpret look he says I tell you that he will avenge them who's nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find water Faith now that is the question 65. here is where I want to get in water revelation 10. everybody okay so Revelation 10 according to brother Branham is the fulfilling of Luke 18. happy to bring the faith before they coming everybody okay he says we shall get into a few minutes to another water scripture he says in the days of the message of the Water Seven Angels the mystery of God ought to be water finish here is the water question is if you follow in that line in which hour this hour will it be water finish we laugh and water the faith will water Malachi 4 be what fulfill to restore the faith of the water children back to the water faith of the fathers the original the water the word Jesus cannot come without the faith to bring him down everybody okay everybody okay the Bible says and he shall send who Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the water the Heaven Must water receive the heaven are holding him until the times of the restitution of what all things Elijah must come and restore all things the book of actors say the heaven are blocking Jesus even if Jesus wake up and say I'm going they haven't said you cannot go until there is a faith there will restore all things but to restore office Elijah must come first so Revelation 10 is fulfilling look at him to restore the first person of the Rapture for you to go in the rapture [Applause] everybody okay this is where the message gets yummy and juicy everybody okay he says but God is just now water Loosely loosening up the water the church where everywhere getting in order so he can get into what the Rapture God to give it how rapturing Faith before he can go in the water you don't go to the Rapture with healing faith foreign [Applause] everybody okay you get it these people who die in here are depending and waiting on us so the state has to come to water perfection in order to bring water resurrection and they are on the source under the hotel waiting for this church to come into water it's Perfection that will cross that's water come that's when Christ does come in other words class cannot come if the church have not reached what Perfection God depressing provides some benefits for us that day without us must not be made perfect but when that we choose water perfect is water come then that which is what Paul is water done away what happened in Revelation 10 it is the coming of the Lord not to resurrect the Dead but to bring the faith everybody okay everybody okay glory to God and now I'm in good head Shake somebody's hand before I load what is coming up again [Applause] now you're going to hear things differently okay okay you want to hear some different sounding but it's in the message and

water one of these days one of their day stop so the son of man has days I told you it's gonna be like a different language the son of man has days okay in other words he has a period of time a period of time for his ministry amen but Jesus is saying that the day will come that you would desire this is Jesus as a human being to see one not all the days one of the singular are we okay are we okay we deciding to see one day off the water of the son of man this son of man is a human being so he said to the disciple someday you will desire to see one day when I am human am I reading a different Bible am I have I lost if I'm not sure everybody okay one of this day you will desire I have been with you many days that I'm a human being I'm about to go you will desire to have only one day when I

lighten out of the one pot on the heaven shine to the other part and the heaven so shall be the son of man in how many days how many days one day everybody okay let's understand the scripture correctly the Bible doesn't say that the lightning is flashing that's not what the Bible is saying that's Pentecostal understanding the Bible is saying that the lightning will come on one end not all the end can we read it let's go verse 24 for us the lighting that light and out of Harmony so the lightning will come on one part amen everybody okay but when he come on one part he will not stop in one part [Applause] [Music] at the opening of the sevenths here my friend let's read it again so your eyes are changing for us the enlightened the light and Out of Water one part on the heaven Shadows to the water all the parts so the lightning is not coming to the other part is not the word Jesus is dividing the world into are you following me there is one part and there is another part and Jesus is saying the lightning will come on one part okay but when it come on one part the effect of the lightning will begin to God to the other part that is the way the son of man woke up in that the way Jesus will come on one part are you following me and he's coming on one part the effect of his coming woke God to the other part which party is he coming are we okay are we okay job to verse 25. glory to God are you there amen but first if you if you see but it's an opposition now it's another coming but first must he water suffer that's the first coming that's when he came to bleed remember many things and be rejected of water this generation that's when he was alive amen and as he was in the days of Hope no so let's go slowly 15 miles an hour so shy future social be also in the days plural

two men shall be in there United they feel the night the one shall be taken and the other shall be watched again the world is divided into parts one part versus the other one part is in light and other parties in what Darkness but Jesus said when the son of man come he come on one part and then his effort will go to the other part that which part is he coming because the first coming he come to the water yes the second coming he come to the water we need to know the second coming I mean the third coming he come to the east the second coming he's coming on which direction Matthew 24. let's go to Matthew 24. I'm not afraid because I have the scripture and the message of the hour Matthew 24 26. if you dare you can say amen amen you there amen wherefore if they say to you behold he is in the water desert demand Jesus Christ God not forth behold he is in the water secret chamber believe it not so the people that attacked the message the man Jesus cannot be in the desert of Arizona that's not the man that's a revelation 10. that's the angel but I'm gonna get to that amen watch verse 27 are you ready amen are you ready amen are you ready according to Luke the lightning was in which part one part what is one part I don't know and it affected the other part watches they want the other part I don't know if it's north south west east I don't know I don't want to say anything that the Bible didn't say let me say what the Bible says by Matthew 24 27 you there amen now Matthew's talking as the lightning come out of the water is come out of the water and shine after the water yes son of man be so the son of man will come as the lightning does that where in the east I miss him you never heard that before calm down the first coming happen where is the second coming happen where is the third coming happened according to Matthew 24 the son of man will come as the last thing that come where yes the the lightning doesn't come to the West he come today and he will affect the everybody okay so the second coming is coming on the east brother Stephen the east really I never heard that before in the message me me I need to verify that I need to verify that I never heard that in a message brother pranam did you know Judas will come from from the water is where did Brother Branham get this this message if you're tired you tell me I can stop here Jesus will come from the water is where did Brother Branham get the scripture did he give you the scripture there's light to us from the water yes everything's civilization started in there yes and traffic house until it revolves around and catches itself out again we are in the water Western Hemisphere that is the water West Eastern Eastern the Eastern is the oldest civilization China is the oldest civilization known by the historian in the world today how is then after he did that then he let them go in the slaughter that was the persecution under who now you see he is the same Angel come forth again coming from the water and where Jesus shall come brother brother when you come in the front from the front you know where each Street runs up this way you are going right to East then then if you shall stand up when I'm preaching I'm preaching toward the what West slow down I told you it's a different material so when brother brother was building the Branham Tabernacle he built the Branham Tabernacle as the Tabernacle of Moses so that when he preaches brother brother will be preaching looking West I told you it's a different language and the congregation will be facing everybody okay see now I do that so the author will be today is so as you coming here and you sit here praying brother brother made sure that you looking because Jesus is coming from the East the altar we buy always today well usually I don't know it's just what I always did I send it in the Bible usually back there Daniel said he went and pulled up the window you know and everything like that and pray to that and notice the old Mosaic Temple I think first how is the order yeah and of course God will heal you wherever you are I don't want you to say that God won't heal you when you're looking at enough but for some reason I'm putting the Tabernacle Facing East I know at this time you are holding the chair where is he going at don't forget that word which word is word where is Jesus coming from there is in the water Cloud of Glory where does the sun rise up when will the sun rise where was The Mercy Seat sitting towards why have I got you all sitting this way toward the east everybody okay the first coming he's coming the second coming he's coming he's the third coming he's coming on Sunset Mountain it's which away which direction did Jesus that came on the east on the first coming he will say what amen the Jesus that is coming on the second coming is what amen the Jesus that is coming on the third coming is his help but who came on Sunset Mountain on which direction we Okay we okay if I will be facing this which are really a traditional that are just to face today is because he's coming from there when a baptized are usually baptized them how their way always to my right side because each time that light comes he come from the water right side and I and so I always try to keep the people come coming to me from the water and I'll be standing kind of this way I suppose positionally the way the building is water sit it out there so when brother Branham is on the pulpit the angel Comes This Way have to turn this way and let the people come this way I'm going to leave the right side everybody okay my friend but one of this day there is a great water magnet coming from the water is called The Who Son of God sweep this land and every person that is dead in Christ shallow rise with him so your boss is coming from the and bringing the resurrection from there amen go Yonder and do this old body will be out transformed and made in his water likeness and to his honor glorious where we shall live

everybody okay but he will not be on earth now the Messiah will not be on earth until the water Millennium sets in because the church we are caught up together to meet him where in the end he never come to that he catches his water by the way everybody okay first coming human how is Second Coming human house is third coming human how is the coming of sunset Mountain is on the west side [Applause] it is not the man Jesus Christ who came on Sunset Mountain this secret coming of the Lord sad and secret going of the church watch there shall be how to the field he shall take one and

let's leave it just like that some of this time to show that the resignation is going to be how Universe there shall be two in the field and it shall take one two in the bed and it shall take one it shall be a night in water one place and the day that on the other side of the earth be a universal water Resurrection let's stop there you can read this at home let me get this quickly notice the Rapture will be how Universal because he said there will be two in the field it shall take one and leave one it shall take two in the bed there shall be two in the bed he shall take one and leave what one you see when it's dark on one side of the Earth well it's two in the bed it shall be a what Harvest Time the Precision is increasing so decide that will be there will be in Harvest Harvest Time on the other side of the water earth when it shall be too under fear it shows it shall come one great big Rapture it shall come rather from the water we wanna know where in the morning you there the night was not divided in ours in the Bible time he was divided in water watches there was three watches the first watch started from water nine until 12. the second word started from water well until three and the Third Watch of the night started uh uh was counted from water three to water six now we got three trees which is water nine yeah you okay can I erase this you're not going home tied up this is your clock three nine six twelve let's go the first watch started from what nine until 12 here to here everybody okay the second watch started from water 12 until three here the Third Watch of the night was counted from water three to water six there is an enconnito here this is the night let me help you out go to John 11. and then we're gonna finish I have to cut it off because you're getting tired let's go to John 11. let's go to John 11 if you're there you can say amen amen John 11 verse 9. are you there amen Jesus answered brother Branham said the night was divided in watches verse 11 verse 9 John 11 verse 9. Jesus answer I did not 12 hours in the day how many hours in the day 12. everybody okay brother Branham say here the night is what one two three everybody okay and we have 12 hours staying watch three three twelve this space is still empty have you noticed that the day started here six o'clock okay Jesus in the Bible says there are how many hours of the day six to three to nine is three nine to twelve three it's six now twelve two three it's nine and three to six again is what it's finished this space is still buffing the day and buffing the night they all match together what is that specific then we come back to the seven for the water Rapture which will take place I believe between six six and what nice some morning wow everybody okay so Jesus will come east the human Jesus being he will appear East in the morning between now six and nine o'clock in the Eastern Time and this Assad of the world will be a night that says the scripture and that save the message of the hour [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] what time I don't know between six and water nine which side is a what I'm in the east in the morning when it's harvest sauce [Laughter] all right let's go to the airport for us the Sun shineth from the Eastland to the water where social the coming of the son of man be he shall appear and it shall be how Universal thing let me skip this you can get it home when the son of man shall appear it shall be like the water light that sounded from the water is unto the water and the whole thing there shall be a water a water and we shall water away go everybody okay everybody okay let me close here with what happened on Sunset Mountain on the west side can you give me 10 minutes okay and then I land the ship in the very day that the son of man is what revealed Revelation water one to seven that's a real feeling I'm going slowly now okay read it when you get home the seven Angel message doing water opening up the sea what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the water son of man can you get it separately now that is where it seems water for you see not the man himself but the Water Seven Angels the seven messenger is revealing to the water the water son of man because he left the water Lord help me everybody okay I want you to notice to know this issue and you that listen to the table you might have a thought today that I was trying to say about myself being that I was packing this word message I have no more to do it than nothing no more than just a water voice let me skip this this you know you can read it at home my brother on the computer make sure it's appearing okay they can catch up this at home let me go to this one what happened on Sunset Mountain he shook the Earth and when he did I was still looking where Westward not East because Jesus come from the water yes and way of in eternity I saw a constellation of something how come so this coming is coming on the west right not taste we need to separate the son of man word and the son of man's flesh the son of man flesh always come at the East but the son of man word will come on the west to restore the faith before the coming of the East [Applause] there's West there's the East is the sun rise the West is there sunset on the sunset Mountain on the sunrise East [Laughter] oh my you can read the rest of home the angel walks to my left would be really the water last or the seven angels if you would cut them from the left to the right because he was on my left me looking to him toward the what West him toward the water East so when brother Branham saw the seventh angel he was on the west looking East and brother Branham looking West that's not the man Jesus it is the word everybody okay West toward me looking toward the west him looking toward water the East will be on my left and so that will be the last Angel message very notable and that is the seventh seal it is a notable thing almost my friend this is the scripture they quote the people use a lot Jesus come on Sunset Mountain let's look at the court when the seals are what and the Mystery is what revealed done come there angel did he say come the man who's coming Angel the man Jesus Christ the Angel The Who messenger who Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow of a water his head now remember this seven Angel is all the Earth but the problem at the time of this what can mean the coming of who the angel not the coming of the man Jesus Christ Jesus come on the east not on the west it is the coming of the Angel fulfilling Revelation 10 Jesus come on the west yes Jesus as the angel [Applause] any Bible reader knows that that Pillar of Fire wants the water Angel of the Covenant the elongos that went out of water God which was who Jesus Jesus as the angel Jesus as a human being he always come is I love this church man I love this church let's go here he says oh God God is an object of what worship the logos the word that were enough of God that was the water Angel of the Lord oh the water word of the Lord that followed the Israel like through water Wilderness the angel of the water Covenant the logos that went out of water God so who came on the west the logos Christos not the man with this car the man with this car always come is everybody okay everybody okay button because I'm gonna go to the airport I hope you swallow this what happened on the west which coming is it brother Branham say it is the coming of the Angel which coming is it you swallow this and you think over it this afternoon I was going to speak on the second what coming after who Lord Jesus I say maybe I would maybe I may have to postpone it until Monday or Tuesday for what I was trying to do in talking on this subject is to

to do it in Fair why which year is this 55. okay let's see this quote my friend come on up which year is this it is the water science took the water which coming is it science took the picture all the way from water Mexico as he moved from the North in Arizona where the Holy Spirit say it would be water for the mass Northeast of water he went into the water and Life Magazine did water pack the picture a Mystic something way in there where there could be no water wait there could be no water evacuation of anything tell them us how 27 miles out and coming right up from dwells What Angels science the one of them in water wanted to know any water significance buddy I didn't tell them you all knew it taught before but it was not for them it was for what you but who took the picture signs the picture of who who is in that picture that science too all right everybody okay everybody okay what is happening on water God doing what confirming his word that is what this noise is all about it is God doing what fulfilling his promise we're the game of water Revelation then what's the water in the day off the water afterwards seven angels the mystery of God shall be water finish the hidden Mystery of what Revelations to the water fulfilling water exactly in which church said to Luke 17 30. the day the son of man will be revealed all right [Applause] you read this at home time is gone let me pull you to this one if you turn the picture who took the picture science like this and look you can probably see it from the water audience it is all Christ who took the picture science a witch coming of Jesus Christ how scientifically foreign not the man but the word and science took the picture and he shows the Lord Jesus Christ naturally the picture is what scientific everybody okay see his water ice scientific looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the water why wait of water Supreme deity of what judge remember his judge or for heaven and water can you see his what ah scientific is what no scientific is what scientific just turn the picture from what yes that is the way to head it he is the Supreme judge there is none other but what him that is the water perfect identification it can a water Vindication that this message is what you choose [Music] foreign how many days was the son of man revealed the Revelation Luke 17 30 only happened in one one day father I'm skipping all of that any blood that will come from Christ will be from the water then his couple of bodies here then the water Second Coming is over and the second cup and the Corporal body can go from which direction [Music] you're going to read the remaining at home we believe in the water second coming of Christ how the visible body of the Lord not the water spirit not that one live forever [Music] Hallelujah this copper body can do it when that comes time is what over time is over come here you're going to reach the home when a man stand and say that he is a minister a pastor of the church somewhere and does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in water every detail except the water physical body he same yesterday to them forever that is the water the seed of discrepancy whoever preaches that's what happened in South segmental is the coming of a physical Jesus Christ that minister in the message is a seed of discrepancy everybody okay Jesus cannot be here in the water because when that body returned the time here the time the water ends he can be here in the water but he is here in the spiritual body in the form called the water Holy Spirit everybody okay which year is this 64. Jesus also who made the promise and as we will say this same hope Jesus that was water taken out from you will come again in like manner as you have seen him go to water heaven we are watching for that glad day to come future last one and we finish here have lived which year 64 after the seals after sunset Mountain I have lived since I was a water a little boy my only achievement I ever had is to see who Jesus Christ is coming in 64. is still looking for Jesus I gave my life for water that purpose I'm still in the Pulpit as an old man I believe the same story and that greatest thing I think our faith is to see who Jesus Christ coming from water heaven to the water receive his own [Music] from his childhood until he died he was expecting to see Jesus Christ to come and to take the bride what happened on Sunset Mountain what happened in the Coronado Forest it is the coming of the Lord scientifically science have to prove it but that's not the man Jesus Christ demand Jesus Christ in his first coming he came East and he was human in the second coming he's coming and he was a human in the third coming he's coming yes and he will be human what happened in South Saint Martin Is Not a Human Being it is the word because the son of man when he come shall he found Faith there must be a word to produce the faith to prepare us for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ let's stand my friend [Applause] a lot to chew my friend some of you already spilled food on the floor so go home and clean it lets the dog pick it up this is to stabilize you when Jesus is coming which Jesus come for our body to be changed we need to see the man a glorified Jesus not a glorified angel the angel came on the west we are expecting somebody to come from the East everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father there is no way I as a human being can be able to see all of this [Music] the glory is not to me it is you that have pity your brother and you came through the scripture and to the message to stable us not only your children here but I know it's going to go worldwide so that the confusion can be left off because the hour has come when we gotta be prepared and now through this clarity foreign we can see the very purpose of the message it is a message that have been sent to give us rupturing faith a message of a preparation a message to give us what we need so that we can meet you into the air [Music] father may all our life all ambitions all our purpose and motive never miss this whether we go to work whether we launch into a business whether we have project to accomplish may we never lose sight of this great thing that you have put in the hand of the believer which is the message of the center to prepare us for the coming of the Lord father may we realize the importance of this message [Music] May everything that try to exalt itself above what the message say may we let it go may we put it down may we humble ourselves may we stop being stubborn may we stop wrestling with the very thing that is changing us that is preparing us that is molding us that is shaping us so that we might be able like Esther to be approved by the kingdom yes to find favor be found before the king and to be sure that that day we will be found clothed and not be naked and a shame into that presence father May the Holy Spirit continue to minister to your children may you continue to Quicken the word May your children go home and study and Ponder on this and realize that the son of man is looking for a fifth and we have someone who came to restore the faith to bring the heart back to the origin of faith and that's the faith you are looking at because you are the author and you are the finisher of that Faith father thank you for this church thank you for the time thank you for the Revelation thank you for the unfolding thank you for putting these things together like this so that our eyes might be clear and we can see face to face as in the mirror Lord the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you and commit everything unto the hand father may you prosper us and keep us throughout the week away from our sickness away from our trouble away from every devil but may we stay consecrated again if that Terry so that we can meet again about the things of the Kingdom we humbly ask it father in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother you got the result thank you there is no contradiction in the message there is no contradiction in the Bible it is the ministry that get contradicted themselves
