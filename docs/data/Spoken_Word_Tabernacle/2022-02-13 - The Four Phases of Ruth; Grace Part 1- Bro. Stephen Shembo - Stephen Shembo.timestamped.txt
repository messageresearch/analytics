[21:17] i've got another song it's a kids song

[21:31] i don't know i've got two testimonies

[21:39] request come on up brother charles and
[21:41] then we'll get you up sister lorell
[21:43] and then we'll pray over these things
[21:44] and then um
[21:46] we have one song special this morning
[21:50] do you
[21:51] okay i'm gonna get you sign up first
[21:55] i was asking him about i kind of felt i
[21:57] said i know what this is about
[22:00] after last week
[22:02] okay i said but don't tell me
[22:04] i don't want to know yet you tell us

[22:20] but i want to first say thank you for
[22:21] all your prayers
[22:23] and all the supplication
[22:25] and i came to a decision that i'll be
[22:27] going to chapel hill
[22:29] and the reason why is because so chapel
[22:32] hill was the first college i applied to
[22:35] but it was the last college during my
[22:36] decision
[22:37] but then it was the first college to
[22:39] giving my financial aid offer
[22:41] and my financial aid offer was a full
[22:43] ride to chocolate hill so all expenses
[22:46] paid i'll say nothing
[22:56] that's awesome
[22:57] that's awesome
[22:59] you want to give yours right there sis
[23:00] just you know and then
[23:04] we are told that you know when we are
[23:06] fought very very hard that the lord has
[23:09] a blessing waiting on us amen
[23:12] and
[23:13] my daughter has been being fought very
[23:16] very very hard every way she turns she
[23:19] gets up at five in the morning she has
[23:21] her time with the lord she prays she
[23:23] reads a bible
[23:25] and she is only 11 in the sixth grade
[23:28] but what an 11 year old has to deal with
[23:30] in this time
[23:32] oh my god
[23:34] it will keep a parent on their knees
[23:36] she was in she had a situation this week
[23:40] it actually started two weeks ago and a
[23:42] little girl for whatever reason
[23:45] just had an issue with her was turning
[23:47] the whole sixth grade against her and
[23:49] she was really it was really tough on
[23:50] her i said well you keep it before the
[23:52] lord then the situation came to our
[23:55] little girl put her hands on her
[23:57] back to back school officials still were
[24:00] dragging their feet
[24:01] i said lord i don't know what to do as a
[24:03] mom you know the bear claws come out
[24:06] i said oh father
[24:09] sarah you know self-defense kicks in
[24:12] that's the mother's recourse but i'm
[24:13] still praying
[24:15] and so she she handled it the day i went
[24:18] to the school to talk to the school
[24:19] official she came home and she said mom
[24:21] she said the lord told me how to handle
[24:24] it like this she said i didn't hit her i
[24:26] didn't jump on her i didn't do this and
[24:28] she just followed the leadership of the
[24:30] lord so
[24:32] she before she gave me the testimony the
[24:35] school officials had called me and
[24:36] teachers had called me within hours
[24:39] telling me how her little light at
[24:41] eleven was shining so as a mother that
[24:45] is the or parent that is the greatest
[24:47] testimony
[24:48] that we can get how kind she is she's
[24:50] sweet she puts others knees before hers
[24:53] so y'all just keep our children in your
[24:55] prayers but that is a testimony tell
[24:58] it's working amen
[25:07] god bless scenes um
[25:09] john just bear with me just about two to
[25:11] three minutes but
[25:13] i have to go in a little detail
[25:15] amen um yesterday
[25:18] brother robert and i we went to get some
[25:20] mattresses
[25:22] from one of the properties
[25:25] and we bought with three box springs and
[25:29] did three mattresses
[25:31] they brought it out we loaded up on the
[25:33] wagon he tied it up and you know tied it
[25:35] up really good and
[25:37] we left so as we were leaving
[25:40] he says um
[25:41] law i think the top need to strap down
[25:44] also so we stopped by food liar not far
[25:46] from here
[25:47] and
[25:49] i went in and get something to eat
[25:50] because we were hungry and he said okay
[25:52] we're ready let's go
[25:54] so we kept looking in the review mirror
[25:56] and looking at the green
[25:58] ties that's that are on it to make sure
[26:00] that it's on
[26:01] and we just looked
[26:04] and i took out a piece of meat give it
[26:05] to him and as we took the bite and we're
[26:08] eating
[26:09] somebody at the side of us
[26:11] flag him down and he pointed to the back
[26:14] when we look there was no mattresses
[26:17] on the back of the wagon
[26:21] so we couldn't reverse we had just
[26:23] passed the exit we couldn't reverse so
[26:25] we had to go all the way down but we
[26:27] have to drive three miles to get to the
[26:29] next exit turn and come back up and
[26:31] we're coming back up there's this guy
[26:33] with a red truck loading the mattresses
[26:36] on it
[26:37] we had to go
[26:39] another two miles turn on another oh a
[26:42] mile
[26:43] get back up and we're coming i said oh
[26:44] robert look there's two
[26:46] in the woods but how the lord had it
[26:48] they were behind the trees so we say
[26:50] thank the lord i said he wanted to stop
[26:51] i said well let's go see if we could
[26:53] meet the guy but time we got there the
[26:54] guy was gone
[26:56] so we had to turn around again we came
[26:57] back we loaded the other two mattresses
[27:00] and as we come in i said robert look
[27:01] there's another one on the other side of
[27:03] the road
[27:04] so he had to run across the 85 to get
[27:07] the mattresses
[27:08] and he called me and he said come along
[27:11] with the truck and the wagon and says i
[27:14] cannot maneuver the wagon in the back so
[27:16] he i said
[27:18] you have your knife
[27:19] and just make a hole in the box spring
[27:21] and put your finger through it and when
[27:23] the road is clear we just pray and run
[27:24] across the road with it
[27:26] so he ran across 85 with the matchers we
[27:29] put it up we load it up so i told him i
[27:32] think i saw another one in the woods
[27:33] back there here he says
[27:35] we sat in the car getting ready to drive
[27:37] off so he said you know what let me go
[27:40] back and just for your piece and see if
[27:42] it's in the woods so he's walking at the
[27:43] side of the highway and i'm standing at
[27:45] the side
[27:46] and he called me he said is it by the
[27:48] sign i said go a little further he went
[27:50] a little further he said he's not seeing
[27:52] anything so he's coming back
[27:54] he's coming back and i'm looking in this
[27:56] direction to see him but i nothing
[27:59] passed so when i turned this way there
[28:02] was
[28:03] a rare truck
[28:04] and a man but while i was going we were
[28:06] praying lord jesus
[28:08] how in the world this man is going to
[28:09] find us with this mattresses or i said
[28:12] may he report it to the police or take
[28:14] it back to the store because the sticker
[28:16] is on it or everything to do something
[28:18] for us and robert and i we were just
[28:20] praying but i said how are you feeling
[28:22] you said praise the lord so we would
[28:24] just praise the lord and say okay
[28:27] so there comes the man and he walks on
[28:29] the
[28:31] highway side and he came around he said
[28:33] excuse me
[28:34] um are those mattresses yours i said yes
[28:37] sir he said there were two in the woods
[28:39] i said we got the two in the woods

[28:48] but a true christian this man is 70
[28:49] something years old
[28:51] he said he saw the mattresses in the
[28:54] road and he stopped and he picked it up
[28:56] and put it in his truck he said it was
[28:58] hard getting it up but i did he said i
[29:01] took it home and i'm praying and saying

[29:14] mattresses those people are right there
[29:16] waiting
[29:18] he's coming back but he's thinking to go
[29:20] back between exit eight and five maybe
[29:23] some more came off and we're picking it
[29:25] up but he said when he was coming he saw
[29:28] the truck with the wagon and he saw me
[29:30] standing there so he reversed under 85

[48:08] you his name
[48:10] amen i don't mean it to be that way
[48:14] but i believe that we are living at so
[48:17] close

[57:08] sung
[57:09] the service was not there the preacher
[57:11] was not preaching yet he was after the
[57:13] song service before the preaching so
[57:16] it's good
[57:18] but we gotta talk
[57:20] verse one
[57:22] if you notice i give you a scripture
[57:24] then i put the three dots there
[57:26] it means this is the first part
[57:29] i'm not going to give you the second
[57:30] part
[57:32] because people need to grow if i give
[57:34] you the second part you will not
[57:36] understand it
[57:38] and you think i'm doing something else
[57:40] so i have to stop there
[57:42] your boss want me to stop there
[57:46] okay
[57:47] so baby will jump
[57:49] all right 14 follow after charity
[57:56] and do water
[58:03] did i say it
[58:05] why we don't desire them
[58:08] what was preached across the pulpit
[58:11] against a gift
[58:16] how are you going to desire something
[58:18] you don't know you don't even like
[58:22] because they say pentecost to pentecost
[58:24] it's true
[58:26] but you got to be very careful
[58:27] [Music]
[58:30] follow after charity that's the top one
[58:34] the
[58:34] capstone and
[58:37] desire spiritual gift you don't go in
[58:39] the capstone and reject the other one
[58:43] but rather that you may want him
[58:48] paul
[58:49] paul
[58:51] the top
[58:52] love
[58:55] brother i don't know the top is love
[58:58] that's charity
[59:00] amen
[59:01] paul say
[59:03] look at the top but also remember their
[59:06] spiritual gift
[59:09] amen
[59:10] how many are they
[59:12] nine he says among the nine
[59:16] i want you to prophesy
[59:20] why
[59:23] why prophecy
[59:26] he continues he says
[59:29] why prophecy
[59:32] he said for he that speaks
[59:35] in an unknown tongue
[59:38] speak not to men
[59:41] but to who
[59:44] if somebody somebody's speaking here i'm
[59:46] just taking an illustration blah blah
[59:47] blah blah blah blah you're not going to
[59:48] use anything he's talking to god
[59:51] not you amen
[59:54] for no man understand him
[59:57] anybody here
[59:59] however
[1:00:00] in the spirit he speaks water
[1:00:04] because nobody understand him they
[1:00:07] didn't say he has a devil
[1:00:11] it's the holy ghost
[1:00:13] it's speaking
[1:00:14] but the problem is we don't understand
[1:00:17] anybody here
[1:00:19] but branham continued he said the bible
[1:00:22] continued he said but he that prophesies
[1:00:28] speak to who
[1:00:31] so when somebody speaking in tongue you
[1:00:33] don't hear it
[1:00:34] it's a secret communication between the
[1:00:37] person and god but if i'm prophesying
[1:00:40] i'm speaking in a language that you can
[1:00:43] hear
[1:00:44] anybody here
[1:00:46] and that prophecy
[1:00:48] is to edification
[1:00:52] or to build somebody up
[1:00:55] to edify
[1:00:56] anybody here
[1:00:58] karma
[1:01:00] and exhortation
[1:01:03] it's to exhort somebody
[1:01:06] so when somebody prophesy
[1:01:09] they can bring something to edify you
[1:01:14] or when somebody prophesy they can bring
[1:01:16] something that will exhaust you
[1:01:21] everybody okay i want you to listen to
[1:01:23] this because we're moving somewhere down
[1:01:25] the road amen
[1:01:26] or
[1:01:28] to comfort
[1:01:31] am i reading a different bible
[1:01:35] make sure you look at your bible young
[1:01:37] people you look at your bible
[1:01:38] okay
[1:01:43] so prophecy
[1:01:45] can either edify somebody
[1:01:48] it can either exhort somebody
[1:01:51] or he can either comfort somebody the
[1:01:54] lord can speak something to comfort you
[1:01:59] the lord can speak something to edify
[1:02:01] you
[1:02:02] the lord can speak something to exalt
[1:02:05] you and brother branham even said the
[1:02:07] word prophecy means to foreter
[1:02:12] something that is happening the lord can
[1:02:14] warn you into something that is
[1:02:17] happening in the future
[1:02:19] or the lord can unfold something in your
[1:02:21] life that is blocking you
[1:02:25] everybody okay
[1:02:27] that's come with
[1:02:29] prophecy
[1:02:30] i don't want you to be children anymore
[1:02:32] that's right
[1:02:33] to grow up amen
[1:02:36] he continued verse 4
[1:02:38] he does speak in an unknown tongue
[1:02:42] eddie fire for himself
[1:02:44] there is none spiritual gift but it
[1:02:47] seems like paul
[1:02:48] is more talking about the tongue
[1:02:54] and prophecy
[1:02:58] did you see that
[1:02:59] praise god
[1:03:01] he said he that speak in an unknown
[1:03:04] tongue
[1:03:05] edifies himself
[1:03:07] but he the prophesy he defies the church
[1:03:12] that's why i want you to prophesy so the
[1:03:16] people in the church can get some
[1:03:18] comfort some will know what is wrong in
[1:03:20] their life some will know what is the
[1:03:22] direction to take some will get some
[1:03:24] exhortation somebody will get some
[1:03:26] comfort that's why i want you to do that
[1:03:30] but i want you to desire a spiritual
[1:03:32] gift
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:35] everybody okay
[1:03:38] verse five i would that you all spoke
[1:03:41] with tongues
[1:03:42] i thought paul didn't want the tongue
[1:03:47] paul say i want everybody in this church
[1:03:50] to speak in tongues
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:54] and when i'm gonna teach you in tongues
[1:03:55] you're gonna see that if you really
[1:03:57] receive the holy ghost
[1:03:59] somehow you're going to speak in tongues
[1:04:03] if you have spoken in tongues yet
[1:04:06] it's not the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:04:10] but you have been seven years
[1:04:12] slow down
[1:04:14] you need to check yourself all right
[1:04:16] anybody okay
[1:04:17] i would that you all spoke with tongues
[1:04:20] but rather that you prophesied
[1:04:24] for greater is he that prophesied
[1:04:27] everybody okay
[1:04:29] then he that does water
[1:04:32] he's greater because what he's speaking
[1:04:34] is edifying the church
[1:04:36] the other one is in communication with
[1:04:39] god anybody okay
[1:04:41] we okay so far
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:44] except
[1:04:46] everybody okay
[1:04:48] the one who prophesied
[1:04:50] is greater than the one who speak in
[1:04:53] tongues in the accept
[1:04:55] this is the exception when he is not
[1:04:58] greater
[1:05:00] do you hear me
[1:05:01] what is that exception except he does
[1:05:05] what
[1:05:06] so when the one who speaks in tongues
[1:05:10] interpret
[1:05:13] then him
[1:05:15] and the prophets
[1:05:17] the one who have the gift of a prophecy
[1:05:19] not a prophet
[1:05:20] him and a prophet is something different
[1:05:23] i will teach you on that
[1:05:26] anybody okay
[1:05:27] that's why i put
[1:05:29] okay
[1:05:30] if he interpret
[1:05:32] the one who speak in tongues and the
[1:05:35] prophet now uh and the one who have the
[1:05:37] gift of prophecy both of them are the
[1:05:39] same now
[1:05:41] if not the other one is higher because
[1:05:43] he's bringing something into the church
[1:05:45] to help the church
[1:05:47] except he interpret that the
[1:05:51] church may receive water
[1:05:54] because when a tongue is interpreted the
[1:05:58] message now is given to the church then
[1:06:00] it's exactly like somebody who's
[1:06:03] prophesying in other words a one who
[1:06:06] professor speak directly to the language
[1:06:10] the people can hear
[1:06:13] any question
[1:06:15] the one who speaks in tongues speak in a
[1:06:18] language that the people do not hear
[1:06:22] everybody okay
[1:06:24] or a language that that nationality
[1:06:28] doesn't know
[1:06:30] yet that language existed somewhere else
[1:06:33] and he needs somebody to interpret
[1:06:39] did that look somebody
[1:06:42] job to verse 12.
[1:06:47] you there
[1:06:48] even so
[1:06:50] for as much as you are zealous
[1:06:54] of spiritual gift
[1:06:56] seek that you may excel
[1:06:59] to the edifying of the
[1:07:02] so whatever you do with the gift the
[1:07:04] lord put in your heart in your life
[1:07:07] remember
[1:07:09] give that gift
[1:07:11] so that he can edify and build the
[1:07:13] church up
[1:07:14] anybody okay
[1:07:16] when you're home no problem
[1:07:18] anybody okay
[1:07:20] verse 13 wherefore
[1:07:22] let him that speak in an unknown tongue
[1:07:26] pray that he may water
[1:07:29] because if he interpret the church knows
[1:07:32] what he's talking about
[1:07:33] i stop there
[1:07:35] if i continue we're gonna preach about
[1:07:38] the gift and i won't even get to what
[1:07:39] i'm trying to preach
[1:07:41] this is where you need to hear as far as
[1:07:43] today
[1:07:45] and later on when the lord continued to
[1:07:47] open up this one this one this one this
[1:07:49] one when i see you 10 people then now
[1:07:51] we're going to sit and then unfold the
[1:07:53] whole thing everybody here brother
[1:07:56] branham say
[1:07:58] god about god he will send
[1:08:00] his gut gift in the church
[1:08:03] there is none spiritual gift
[1:08:06] to set into the local
[1:08:09] each
[1:08:11] local body
[1:08:14] anybody okay
[1:08:15] you need a scripture for the nine you
[1:08:17] let me know
[1:08:18] should be in full operation
[1:08:24] you see where we gotta go
[1:08:26] do you see where we got a clam
[1:08:28] in full operation in everybody
[1:08:32] every water
[1:08:36] go ahead and travel around the churches
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:42] travel around the churches i'm not
[1:08:44] boasting i'm just boasting in the lord
[1:08:47] and go see how many times you're going
[1:08:49] to see that
[1:08:54] this is what brother branham said amen
[1:08:56] why did we kill it
[1:09:02] so something is wrong
[1:09:04] somewhere
[1:09:07] around the churches something is wrong
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:16] and in that
[1:09:18] is gift of tongue and interpretation of
[1:09:21] time
[1:09:23] brother branham starts with the nine and
[1:09:25] he narrows down just like paul narrows
[1:09:28] down
[1:09:29] what's wrong with this gift
[1:09:31] and now that it is just not repeating
[1:09:35] something or making a van
[1:09:39] repetition
[1:09:41] it is saying something directly to be
[1:09:44] interpreted for a certain person in that
[1:09:48] congregation or something to make a way
[1:09:52] tongue
[1:09:53] by
[1:09:54] interpretation is what
[1:09:57] that's why paul say accept
[1:10:01] because strong when it's interpreted
[1:10:03] it's in the same level as prophecy
[1:10:06] anybody clear it's just using different
[1:10:09] channels
[1:10:10] prophecy goes straight
[1:10:13] tongue goes to one and the second
[1:10:15] interpret then it goes to you everybody
[1:10:17] okay
[1:10:21] let's continue i know you tense like
[1:10:23] where is he going relax amen
[1:10:26] tongue by interpretation is prophecy and
[1:10:30] it's prophetic utterance given to the
[1:10:33] people to tell them what to do
[1:10:36] or something to correct
[1:10:39] either it's going to edify exhort
[1:10:42] comfort or foretell something
[1:10:44] anybody okay
[1:10:46] blessed be the name of the lord where
[1:10:48] are you going pastor brother branham to
[1:10:50] speak in tongues
[1:10:53] is a gift of god to edification
[1:10:57] as paul said in the scripture
[1:10:59] that it's to edify the church you got
[1:11:02] the scripture you can read the whole the
[1:11:04] whole chapter so it had to be some
[1:11:07] direct message
[1:11:10] my question to you if somebody is
[1:11:13] speaking in tongues
[1:11:15] how do you know it's a direct message
[1:11:19] you don't understand it how do you know
[1:11:21] it's a direct message
[1:11:22] for you to know that it's a direct
[1:11:24] message the one who interpret
[1:11:27] must give the message when he give the
[1:11:30] message then we're gonna gage the
[1:11:32] message by the interpreter
[1:11:38] relax everybody okay
[1:11:41] brother branham say so he had to be a
[1:11:44] direct message from god to the church
[1:11:48] outside of what is wrote in the bible
[1:11:55] if you could ask me brother branham how
[1:11:58] must i be baptized i can tell you right
[1:12:01] quick you don't have to speak in tongues
[1:12:04] and to tell me that it's wrote right
[1:12:06] here in the bible what to do about that
[1:12:10] i don't have you don't have to ask no
[1:12:12] question on that and have somebody speak
[1:12:15] in tongues and tell you if that is
[1:12:17] already water
[1:12:20] relax
[1:12:22] we're talking about tongues
[1:12:24] being interpreted
[1:12:25] it must be a direct message
[1:12:29] sometimes the lord wants to edify
[1:12:31] somebody
[1:12:32] sometimes the lord won't exalt somebody
[1:12:35] sometimes the lord want to comfort
[1:12:37] somebody sometimes they go lord want to
[1:12:39] tell you something that is happening in
[1:12:42] the future but you gotta have an
[1:12:44] interpreter brother branham continue
[1:12:46] when you go in a meeting
[1:12:48] the first thing you do you go in there
[1:12:51] and they have a bunch of tongues and
[1:12:53] interpretation tongue and interpretation
[1:12:56] and somebody raise up and keep coding
[1:12:59] the scripture
[1:13:00] that is colonel
[1:13:06] everybody okay
[1:13:07] absolutely god said for us not to use
[1:13:11] then repetition what about him if he
[1:13:14] wrote it once you believe it you don't
[1:13:17] have to say it again
[1:13:18] tongue and interpretation is right
[1:13:22] but it's god it's it is to be a direct
[1:13:26] message to the church
[1:13:27] and to somebody not just carnal and
[1:13:30] things like that and then you get ahead
[1:13:32] in all these other things
[1:13:37] brother stephen
[1:13:39] where are you going with me
[1:13:41] the bible says the spirit of the prophet
[1:13:45] is subject to the prophet
[1:13:47] god is no author of confusion
[1:13:50] when i'm standing here or a minister
[1:13:53] here under the anointing of god
[1:13:55] no matter how much you want to speak in
[1:13:58] tongues
[1:13:59] with tongues you urge your peace
[1:14:02] until god is finished here
[1:14:07] everybody okay
[1:14:09] the spirit of the prophet is subject to
[1:14:12] the prophet what it means is the one who
[1:14:15] have the gift
[1:14:17] can have an ability to block it
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] i'm going on the surface when i'm gonna
[1:14:24] teach you on the gift i'm gonna get
[1:14:26] deeper and you will understand that
[1:14:28] better anybody okay anybody okay so when
[1:14:31] the tongue is coming
[1:14:33] and the preacher is preaching brother
[1:14:35] branham say you push your break
[1:14:38] because the holy ghost cannot speak
[1:14:40] there and speak here at the same time
[1:14:42] and bring confusion everybody okay you
[1:14:45] gotta push your break until the sermon
[1:14:48] is finished then you open up everybody
[1:14:50] care
[1:14:51] question on wednesday was it during the
[1:14:54] service when the preacher was speaking
[1:14:58] was he during the song service
[1:15:01] did he interrupt anybody
[1:15:04] chill out
[1:15:05] everybody okay
[1:15:07] when i'm standing here or a minister
[1:15:10] under our editor then if you speak with
[1:15:12] tongues
[1:15:13] it can be some repeating of scripture
[1:15:16] because god don't use then repetition
[1:15:19] but it's a message directly to somebody
[1:15:23] ask me one time put your finger on one
[1:15:26] time that the holy spirit ever under the
[1:15:29] discernment taught somebody repeated the
[1:15:31] scripture over and over he told them
[1:15:34] something that was wrong with them and
[1:15:36] something that they have done and
[1:15:38] something that they must do or something
[1:15:40] that had happened and something like
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:47] after the service
[1:15:49] so speaking in tongues can happen before
[1:15:56] i have a quote
[1:15:58] or it can happen after
[1:16:01] it's in order
[1:16:03] anybody okay
[1:16:05] what we don't want he cannot interrupt
[1:16:07] the service then you go to the confusion
[1:16:09] of pentecost
[1:16:11] after the service if the person just
[1:16:13] raise up and give a message the pastor
[1:16:17] if you want to stop just a minute and go
[1:16:19] ahead very well that's up to the pastor
[1:16:23] but then immediately brother kelly let
[1:16:26] the deacon
[1:16:27] before that person gets out of the
[1:16:30] building take them to one side and talk
[1:16:33] to them about it
[1:16:35] so when you speak in tongues in this
[1:16:37] church
[1:16:39] except brother robert or brother kelly
[1:16:42] to talk to you not to rebuke you
[1:16:44] but they just want to gain more
[1:16:46] information before we bring it to the
[1:16:48] church
[1:16:49] everybody okay
[1:16:51] so don't get frustrated
[1:16:53] the deacon are not calling you to
[1:16:54] condemn you they're calling you to ask
[1:16:56] you some questions then they'll gain
[1:16:59] some detail and from there on we go
[1:17:01] everybody okay
[1:17:03] now the problem is brother stephen
[1:17:06] somebody speak in tongues
[1:17:09] we don't understand what they are saying
[1:17:12] another one professor anybody here
[1:17:15] brother branham said normally there must
[1:17:17] be a judge
[1:17:20] to judge that message
[1:17:22] it is in the book right here it is in
[1:17:24] the bible
[1:17:25] i'm not going to get there because i
[1:17:26] told you i don't want to touch it
[1:17:28] anybody okay i don't want to touch it
[1:17:30] now amen there must be somebody to judge
[1:17:34] anybody okay
[1:17:35] to tell us whether it's god or not
[1:17:39] because the tongue
[1:17:41] and the prophecy have a mystery in the
[1:17:43] midst of it because there is something
[1:17:46] in the supernatural that we don't really
[1:17:48] get
[1:17:49] it's different than if a ghetto say
[1:17:51] brother angelo the lord say stand up
[1:17:53] that's directly but if i speak in
[1:17:56] tongues
[1:17:57] we don't know what the tongue is
[1:18:01] everybody okay
[1:18:03] brother branham say so my question is
[1:18:06] who knows what is real
[1:18:12] who understood the language
[1:18:15] to know what was spoken
[1:18:18] how are you going to judge somebody
[1:18:19] speaking in tongues
[1:18:20] you don't even know what they were
[1:18:22] talking about
[1:18:24] how do you know it's real
[1:18:26] you didn't hear what it's talking about
[1:18:28] anybody okay
[1:18:30] who has the gift of discernment
[1:18:33] to know
[1:18:35] now when you get those answers we will
[1:18:38] have something to go on
[1:18:40] but until then we have to wonder about
[1:18:43] the source of the tongue
[1:18:46] in other words if you are not sure
[1:18:48] whether that tongue you understood it or
[1:18:51] not
[1:18:51] if you are not sure and you don't have
[1:18:54] the gift of discernment to discern that
[1:18:57] tongue
[1:18:58] hold your peace
[1:18:59] because you don't have those elements
[1:19:01] that's why the deacon have to call you
[1:19:04] and then talk to you everybody okay
[1:19:06] because if you don't have those elements
[1:19:08] you cannot make a correct judgment
[1:19:11] if you judge wrong and it was god you
[1:19:13] get in trouble
[1:19:15] did you hear me
[1:19:16] did you hear me
[1:19:21] oh my god don't worry my friend now
[1:19:23] buckle up pretty good okay i'm gonna get
[1:19:25] you to the airport on the tongues okay
[1:19:28] question
[1:19:29] brother branham if a person
[1:19:32] or person speaking in unknown tongues
[1:19:35] in the same tone
[1:19:37] of voice each time
[1:19:39] so every time we hear that person it's
[1:19:41] like they're repeating the same speaking
[1:19:43] in tongues anybody okay
[1:19:45] the same thing but the interpretation
[1:19:49] is different by the interpreter each
[1:19:52] time could that be the holy ghost
[1:19:58] by the pronoun now let me read that
[1:20:00] again if a person or person speaking in
[1:20:03] unknown tongues in the same tone of
[1:20:05] voice in other words just saying the
[1:20:08] same thing like certain words over and
[1:20:10] over and over each time and the same
[1:20:13] thing each time but the interpretation
[1:20:15] by the interpreter is different each
[1:20:17] time could this be the holy ghost
[1:20:20] in other words we have a sister or we
[1:20:22] have a brother every time they stand and
[1:20:24] speak in tongues they keep saying the
[1:20:26] same thing but if somebody translate
[1:20:29] today they spoke something the
[1:20:31] translation is giving a message tomorrow
[1:20:33] they repeat the same thing until you can
[1:20:36] memorize
[1:20:37] how they speak in tongues but every time
[1:20:40] the interpretation is different can that
[1:20:42] be the holy ghost
[1:20:48] your seat is good mind is more harder
[1:20:50] than yours
[1:20:52] okay so you relax
[1:20:54] everybody okay
[1:20:56] now let me say this in this case
[1:20:59] remember god be my judge
[1:21:03] i
[1:21:04] this is william marion branham
[1:21:06] this is paul
[1:21:08] it is i i already told you about it
[1:21:11] i couldn't say it but in experiences
[1:21:14] that i have witnessed while under the
[1:21:17] anointing of such a meeting in other
[1:21:18] words humanly speaking me brother
[1:21:20] branham
[1:21:22] i cannot tell but by my experience
[1:21:25] i paul everybody okay that's where the
[1:21:27] ipod goes sorry i believe that the
[1:21:30] person that is saying the same thing
[1:21:33] over each time
[1:21:36] the same tone of voice is really
[1:21:39] speaking in tongues
[1:21:41] can you say man
[1:21:45] this message
[1:21:46] don't worry my brother you're gonna be
[1:21:48] turned into real people amen
[1:21:51] you're already people but i know what
[1:21:52] i'm talking about amen
[1:21:56] the same tone is really speaking in
[1:21:59] tongues i do
[1:22:01] i believe by the spirit they are
[1:22:03] speaking in tongues if they are
[1:22:07] if you're not christian
[1:22:11] then we begin to question you
[1:22:14] you understand that's how you judge
[1:22:16] gifts slowly you don't go quick
[1:22:19] go slowly
[1:22:20] everybody okay
[1:22:22] they are speaking with tongues no doubt
[1:22:24] but i believe that you get the wrong
[1:22:28] strength of water
[1:22:30] but branham is saying that
[1:22:32] as far as strong is concerned for that
[1:22:36] person i put a check mark it's okay
[1:22:39] brother branham said the problem that
[1:22:42] you get in confusion
[1:22:44] is with the interpreter
[1:22:50] tongue plus
[1:22:53] interpreted
[1:22:56] equal prophecy
[1:22:58] that's your equation
[1:23:01] anybody okay
[1:23:02] anybody okay
[1:23:05] is it complicated when somebody speaks
[1:23:07] in tongue and somebody interpret it's
[1:23:10] the same as prophecy that's the equation
[1:23:18] amen now brother branham is saying that
[1:23:22] this one
[1:23:23] is from god
[1:23:24] as far as this question
[1:23:26] where you get confused
[1:23:29] it's this guy here
[1:23:31] the interpreter
[1:23:32] what is going on brother branham
[1:23:37] hallelujah amen
[1:23:39] brother branham continued he said now
[1:23:42] but i'm not trying to flood him or to
[1:23:45] shake down i'm only trying to make a
[1:23:47] truth now someone speaking in tongues
[1:23:50] and another one get up
[1:23:53] to interpret tongue now listen close
[1:23:57] in the in interpretation of tongue now
[1:24:01] i'm going to have to get down in some
[1:24:03] doctrine now with this
[1:24:04] listen close now
[1:24:06] in the interpretation of tongue
[1:24:10] many people interpret tongues
[1:24:13] by an extraordinary
[1:24:16] expression
[1:24:18] of them feeling to say such a thing
[1:24:21] that is not interpretation
[1:24:26] i'm going slowly
[1:24:28] do you hear me you hear me
[1:24:31] if something come over you
[1:24:34] anybody here after somebody spoke in
[1:24:37] tongues
[1:24:39] everybody
[1:24:40] and you interpreted
[1:24:43] without
[1:24:44] understanding the language of the one
[1:24:47] speaking in tongues
[1:24:49] you are not interpreting
[1:24:52] can i repeat myself again
[1:24:55] in other words if somebody spoke in
[1:24:58] tongue
[1:24:59] blah blah blah blah blah blah anybody
[1:25:01] okay
[1:25:02] the one who interpret
[1:25:05] must
[1:25:06] not understand blah blah blah
[1:25:09] do you hear me
[1:25:10] the ear of an interpreter understand
[1:25:14] different
[1:25:15] they remember of the church understand
[1:25:18] blah blah blah
[1:25:20] but if you see somebody speaking in
[1:25:23] tongues
[1:25:24] and another one interpret
[1:25:26] and if you call the interpreter and you
[1:25:29] speak to the interpreter the first
[1:25:32] question you you ask the interpreter did
[1:25:35] you hear
[1:25:36] that person speaking in tongues yes or
[1:25:39] no
[1:25:40] did you hear me now
[1:25:42] if they say yes
[1:25:44] anybody care
[1:25:46] then that is interpretation then we
[1:25:49] gotta judge that
[1:25:51] we need to call the person and say you
[1:25:54] said sister samantha did this she said
[1:25:56] samantha come here do you recognize
[1:25:58] doing this this this this if she said no
[1:26:02] we got to pray for you
[1:26:03] you got a wrong spirit
[1:26:05] and we need to cast it out
[1:26:07] anybody okay
[1:26:08] anybody okay if you are right
[1:26:11] and the sister lie
[1:26:13] you will know how god whoop people
[1:26:16] because you made the holy ghost lying
[1:26:19] then ananias and sapphira
[1:26:24] in other words when they call you in
[1:26:26] this church and they ask you always
[1:26:30] speak the truth
[1:26:32] i don't want to bury you
[1:26:36] i want to bury you in christ
[1:26:39] so you can meet him in the air
[1:26:42] do you hear me
[1:26:43] do you hear me but if the person
[1:26:46] genuinely say that is not me
[1:26:49] we catch the interpreter
[1:26:52] everybody okay
[1:26:53] hallelujah
[1:26:56] let me continue he says
[1:26:58] interpretation
[1:27:00] is when they are speaking in an unknown
[1:27:03] tongue
[1:27:05] you are hearing them in water
[1:27:08] and just repeating over what their water
[1:27:11] so if you speak english if somebody is
[1:27:15] speaking in tongues you will hear them
[1:27:17] in english
[1:27:19] if you speak spanish
[1:27:21] and somebody is speaking in tongues you
[1:27:24] must hear them in your mother tongue
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:31] on the day of pentecost when peter was
[1:27:34] preaching
[1:27:36] the bible said they were hearing them in
[1:27:39] their mother's tongue
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:45] hallelujah
[1:27:47] what are we going to do brother branham
[1:27:50] use the question was
[1:27:52] if somebody's speaking tongues and
[1:27:54] repeating the same thing
[1:27:56] everybody
[1:27:56] and the interpreter giving something
[1:27:59] different easy
[1:28:01] correct is he the holy ghost
[1:28:04] now brother branham comes back he
[1:28:05] already checked they're speaking in
[1:28:06] tongues we're now dealing with the
[1:28:08] interpreter
[1:28:10] i believe in this statement that is made
[1:28:12] here same thing over i believe in that
[1:28:15] statement that they are both what
[1:28:19] so somebody can be speaking the same
[1:28:21] thing and the interpreter is giving
[1:28:22] something different it is correct
[1:28:25] if it's under the correct spirit
[1:28:28] anybody okay
[1:28:29] but i do not believe that the
[1:28:32] interpreter
[1:28:39] is interpreting
[1:28:41] the language
[1:28:42] of the person
[1:28:46] brother problem is saying
[1:28:49] somebody speak in tongues
[1:28:51] this message is true
[1:28:53] anybody okay
[1:28:54] anybody okay and they keep repeating the
[1:28:57] same thing
[1:28:58] you hear me and they interpret they're
[1:29:01] prophesying
[1:29:02] something different
[1:29:04] it is the holy ghost but brother branham
[1:29:06] said i want you to understand something
[1:29:09] here
[1:29:10] ever here even though the interpreter is
[1:29:14] interpreting something i don't think
[1:29:17] that interpreter
[1:29:19] is understanding the language
[1:29:24] did you hear me
[1:29:26] in other words the holy ghost is
[1:29:28] anointing the one with the tongue
[1:29:31] and he's speaking or she's speaking in
[1:29:33] tongues
[1:29:34] checkmark amen
[1:29:36] but it seems like this one also
[1:29:40] get up and does something
[1:29:42] and brother branham said both of them
[1:29:44] are correct
[1:29:45] but i don't think this interpreter
[1:29:48] understand this one
[1:29:53] in other words the interpreter this is
[1:29:57] doing a
[1:29:59] and this one is doing b
[1:30:01] but they are happening at the same time
[1:30:10] do you want me to repeat again
[1:30:12] do you want me to repeat again
[1:30:14] in other words somebody is speaking
[1:30:17] remember brother branham said the slant
[1:30:18] is at the interpreter anybody care
[1:30:21] it could be that somebody speak in
[1:30:23] tongues and the interpreter hears them
[1:30:26] and go but if you see something going on
[1:30:28] after a while brother branham said it is
[1:30:31] a signal that the one you thinking is
[1:30:34] interpreting
[1:30:35] is not really understanding in other
[1:30:38] words that interpreter also is hearing
[1:30:41] tongue
[1:30:45] did you hear me in other words when the
[1:30:48] anointing comes
[1:30:50] the whole church heard tongues
[1:30:54] yet they interpreted rose
[1:30:57] and spock something
[1:30:59] but she didn't heal the interpretation
[1:31:02] of the language
[1:31:04] did you hear me
[1:31:10] i'm almost done
[1:31:12] i believe that the spirit is present
[1:31:16] and the interpreter is water
[1:31:22] somebody
[1:31:24] is truly speaking in tongues
[1:31:27] but there is no interpreter
[1:31:30] did you get it
[1:31:32] and the interpreter that you think is
[1:31:34] interpreting because the interpreter
[1:31:38] followed the tongue
[1:31:39] because usually somebody speaking tongue
[1:31:42] the interpreted follow and by default
[1:31:45] you assume that the one that follow is
[1:31:47] interpreting brother branham says
[1:31:49] sometimes the one that follow does not
[1:31:53] understand the language
[1:31:55] and if they don't understand the
[1:31:58] language they are not interpreting they
[1:32:01] are actually prophesying
[1:32:06] if it's the holy ghost
[1:32:11] you okay now
[1:32:12] so somebody can speak in tongues
[1:32:16] the first question
[1:32:18] somebody follows and interpret
[1:32:20] pull the interpreter ask the question
[1:32:23] did you hear the tongue if they say yes
[1:32:28] both of them are together in one accord
[1:32:31] anybody okay
[1:32:32] but if the interpreters say i didn't
[1:32:35] hear the tongue then the interpreter was
[1:32:38] not interpreting the interpreter was
[1:32:41] prophesying and if you prophesy either
[1:32:44] you edify
[1:32:46] either you exhort
[1:32:49] either you comfort either you foretell
[1:32:55] anybody okay
[1:32:58] all right
[1:32:59] brother robert you put me on this seat
[1:33:01] anybody okay
[1:33:03] i believe he is prophesying instead of
[1:33:07] interpreting if he does not hear the
[1:33:10] voice in his own water
[1:33:13] and brother branham give the scripture
[1:33:14] how he we every man in our own language
[1:33:17] where when we were
[1:33:19] in the day of pentecost so you got to
[1:33:21] hear the same thing you got to hear it
[1:33:24] in english
[1:33:25] if you speak in english
[1:33:27] and if you are speaking in an unknown
[1:33:29] tongue and interpreting you are hearing
[1:33:32] in the language that you were born in
[1:33:35] because that is the only way you can
[1:33:37] interpret what they are saying because
[1:33:40] the holy spirit has interpreted to you
[1:33:43] and you are just speaking for the holy
[1:33:45] ghost you become a month that the holy
[1:33:48] ghost is speaking to tell the church
[1:33:51] what he's speaking in another tongue
[1:33:54] anybody okay
[1:33:56] almost
[1:33:57] brother branham saying
[1:33:59] i certainly i say certainly it's of god
[1:34:03] certainly i believe it's of god but he
[1:34:06] was speaking in tongues
[1:34:08] but could not say what he was saying
[1:34:10] because i don't know but
[1:34:12] and the presence of the spirit was there
[1:34:15] so when something happened
[1:34:17] first check the anointing in the room
[1:34:20] do you hear me if it's the holy spirit
[1:34:23] genuine
[1:34:25] everybody here if it's a wrong spirit
[1:34:27] then your red flag goes up
[1:34:30] but if it's nothing genuine
[1:34:33] be careful now you need to go in the
[1:34:34] detail
[1:34:37] everybody okay
[1:34:39] so if the presence of the spirit is
[1:34:42] there
[1:34:43] and this person just saying one word
[1:34:46] over and over and over speaking in
[1:34:48] tongues and this one just jump up this
[1:34:51] other one jump up and try to give
[1:34:54] try to give
[1:34:56] interpretation yet they don't know what
[1:34:59] he's saying in other words they didn't
[1:35:01] hear the language in interpretation if
[1:35:04] this man is not giving the
[1:35:06] interpretation he is what
[1:35:09] the spirit of prophecy is upon him and
[1:35:12] he's prophesying not giving a water
[1:35:17] what is the conclusion
[1:35:21] brother branham so therefore dear
[1:35:24] christian you who asked the question
[1:35:28] to you who said could that be the holy
[1:35:31] ghost
[1:35:33] are you sleeping already
[1:35:36] it could be the holy ghost
[1:35:39] using water
[1:35:46] don't be quick to judge
[1:35:50] it could be the holy ghost using two
[1:35:53] offices
[1:35:54] why because the anointing drop down
[1:35:58] and somebody gets so happy
[1:36:01] until they don't know how to express
[1:36:03] themselves and they pick up in tongues
[1:36:06] and automatically because of the way we
[1:36:09] were trained we are waiting for an
[1:36:11] interpreter
[1:36:12] anybody care
[1:36:14] because the tongue went there but we
[1:36:16] don't know if it's the holy ghost
[1:36:18] wanting to give a message or it's
[1:36:20] somebody who's caught up into the holy
[1:36:22] ghost rejoicing themselves
[1:36:25] anybody okay
[1:36:26] everybody okay then sometimes an
[1:36:29] interpreter follow but we gotta make
[1:36:31] sure did that interpreter here or no if
[1:36:34] they heard prophecy it cannot be the
[1:36:37] repetition of the scripture if they
[1:36:39] didn't hear
[1:36:41] then it's two separate offices because
[1:36:44] the anointing dropped down it is
[1:36:46] quickening the spirit the gift here the
[1:36:48] gift here the gift here and they can't
[1:36:50] control themselves and this one let
[1:36:52] loose and the other one let's lose it's
[1:36:54] like they have a gun they are not in
[1:36:56] hate them and they just shoot
[1:36:58] because they cannot control
[1:37:04] it could be the holy spirit using two
[1:37:06] offices
[1:37:08] one blessing a soul
[1:37:11] in speaking in tongues
[1:37:13] and another one prophesying
[1:37:16] not have to be interpreting what he's
[1:37:18] saying but yet he said the holy spirit
[1:37:21] came upon him in prophecy just the same
[1:37:25] time
[1:37:26] that this one was speaking in tongues
[1:37:29] and he thought it was an interpretation
[1:37:33] what a difference does it make it's the
[1:37:36] spirit of god giving a message to the
[1:37:38] water
[1:37:39] by the interpretation it's got to
[1:37:41] understand in water
[1:37:43] and repeat back exactly what the person
[1:37:46] say that is the gift of water
[1:37:50] last one
[1:37:51] many times in our churches we permit
[1:37:54] people just to rise up even when you are
[1:37:56] preaching and speaking tongues and
[1:37:58] making an altar call somebody speaking
[1:38:00] in tongues and somebody to give an
[1:38:02] interpretation merely one of them i
[1:38:06] believe i believe the person is
[1:38:08] genuinely speaking in tongues but i
[1:38:10] believe the other one more or less is
[1:38:13] water
[1:38:14] because some will speak in tongues maybe
[1:38:17] for five minutes
[1:38:19] another decoder
[1:38:21] and the other one give four words of
[1:38:23] interpretation
[1:38:25] it has to be the same
[1:38:27] the same
[1:38:29] and
[1:38:31] so when somebody is speaking in trunks
[1:38:35] the deacon need to take that help
[1:38:38] if they are in the room they need to
[1:38:40] click their cell phone and put their
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:47] here
[1:38:48] and when the interpreter comes the deal
[1:38:50] can put the time
[1:38:52] if it's five
[1:38:54] and five
[1:38:56] it is prophecy it gotta be charged
[1:39:00] if it's two minutes
[1:39:02] and here it's five minutes you're
[1:39:04] dealing with an operation of two spirits
[1:39:12] i called the sister that spoke
[1:39:15] that
[1:39:19] gave the interpretation
[1:39:21] and i asked the sister a question
[1:39:24] i say sister tell me what happened
[1:39:28] did you hear
[1:39:30] what
[1:39:31] were you hearing
[1:39:33] she told me i was hearing
[1:39:36] somebody speaking in tongues
[1:39:38] i said did you hear what they were
[1:39:40] saying she said no
[1:39:42] i was just hearing
[1:39:43] somebody speaking in tongues and
[1:39:45] suddenly
[1:39:46] something took over me
[1:39:48] and i tried to block it and i let it
[1:39:51] loose
[1:39:53] so it was not
[1:39:55] interpretation
[1:39:57] if the anointing is genuine it is the
[1:40:00] holy spirit using two offices
[1:40:03] one just got caught up under the joy of
[1:40:06] the lord and begin to speak in tongues
[1:40:09] and the other one just caught up and the
[1:40:11] lord is maybe comforting somebody who
[1:40:14] was going through something
[1:40:16] let's stand
[1:40:26] if i need to teach you on gift how long
[1:40:28] will it take
[1:40:32] how long
[1:40:34] how long
[1:40:37] oh my god
[1:40:38] what do you do brother stephen
[1:40:41] brother stephen
[1:40:43] for the present time
[1:40:45] let them speak
[1:40:48] if he goes out of hand then ian you have
[1:40:51] to watch that sometimes it could be god
[1:40:54] and those leader fellow just like little
[1:40:56] kids trying to walk if he falls down
[1:40:59] four or five times i have seen this i
[1:41:01] have been in the church just leave it
[1:41:03] like that
[1:41:05] when billy paul back
[1:41:06] back there first started to walk he was
[1:41:09] up and down and down more he was up but
[1:41:11] he didn't know how to walk but i believe
[1:41:14] he had the gift of walking and let him
[1:41:16] walk a little while and then when he got
[1:41:18] to stumble his big feet i tell him about
[1:41:21] it so if the holy spirit comes on you
[1:41:24] don't be afraid brother stephen is going
[1:41:26] to stay on sunday
[1:41:29] let him loose
[1:41:30] let the holy spirit use you
[1:41:32] when it comes more frequently then we
[1:41:35] sit and put everything in order because
[1:41:37] we got certain situation that we need an
[1:41:40] answer direct from god
[1:41:42] to decode the situation it doesn't need
[1:41:45] the scripture he doesn't need the quote
[1:41:47] we need to hear from god directly then
[1:41:50] you can take advantage of those gifts
[1:41:52] and we can call them and sit down and
[1:41:54] they can pray pray pray until god comes
[1:41:57] down and say sister brother so and so
[1:41:59] what is blocking you you stole
[1:42:01] somebody's stuff over there two years
[1:42:03] ago go repent that thing will go
[1:42:07] everybody okay
[1:42:09] so we need that
[1:42:11] lord help me
[1:42:12] i don't know where my time is let's go
[1:42:14] to genesis 24.
[1:42:28] it's a hard thing if the people don't
[1:42:31] understand how we operate
[1:42:33] brother branham spoke it all over the
[1:42:35] message if you don't sit
[1:42:37] to study
[1:42:39] you will kill
[1:42:41] a gift in churches
[1:42:43] you're going to hammer on people
[1:42:45] and then you don't know you are choking
[1:42:47] the holy spirit that is opening channel
[1:42:50] to help you up
[1:42:52] and that's all over the message
[1:42:54] because somebody didn't understand how

[1:47:26] rapture coming up
[1:47:27] that elijah went with elisha from water

[1:53:02] get that
[1:53:03] everybody okay
[1:53:05] and the two went by jordan
[1:53:08] there is a key here that is powerful and
[1:53:11] elijah took his mentor
[1:53:14] brother mike daley asked me this
[1:53:16] question and he opened up a message but
[1:53:18] one of this day we will speak about the
[1:53:19] mystery of the 24 stones of jordan that
[1:53:22] you will see while this opened and
[1:53:24] elijah took his mantle and wrap it
[1:53:27] together and smote the waters and they
[1:53:31] divided here and there jordan means
[1:53:33] death
[1:53:34] so they too went over on dry ground
[1:53:38] and he come to pass
[1:53:40] when they were gone over
[1:53:44] that elijah
[1:53:46] said to elisha
[1:53:49] ask what i shall do for you
[1:53:52] before i be taken away from you
[1:53:56] they never ask elijah elijah that here
[1:54:00] they didn't ask him here
[1:54:02] they didn't ask him here he have to
[1:54:05] cross jordan
[1:54:07] over jordan
[1:54:09] that's when something opened up
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:13] everybody okay
[1:54:16] and elisha said i pray you let what
[1:54:19] a double portion of water
[1:54:23] so the spirit was over jordan
[1:54:29] anybody care
[1:54:30] everybody here
[1:54:32] the coming of the spirit
[1:54:35] in the life of elisha
[1:54:37] cannot happen here
[1:54:43] are we okay
[1:54:44] remember it's the same revelation
[1:54:46] unfolding it cannot happen here it
[1:54:50] cannot even happen here even both of
[1:54:53] them have prophetic utterances but they
[1:54:56] cannot give the spirit
[1:54:58] you have to go to jordan
[1:55:01] and cross death
[1:55:04] because that snake was still there
[1:55:08] you remember that snake when that snake
[1:55:10] is taken off
[1:55:11] then the holy ghost is ready to come
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:19] everybody okay so far
[1:55:21] my god that's why i tell you keep up
[1:55:23] with the sermon
[1:55:25] everybody okay
[1:55:26] a double portion of your spirit be upon
[1:55:29] me and he said you have asked a hard
[1:55:32] thing
[1:55:33] nevertheless if you see me
[1:55:37] the word see
[1:55:38] if you see me
[1:55:40] when i am taken from you it shall be so
[1:55:44] to you but if not it shall not be so
[1:55:47] anybody care
[1:55:49] you gotta see me being taken out
[1:55:51] for you to receive the spirit
[1:55:54] so if you cross over here
[1:55:56] and you don't see me
[1:55:58] you lost it it's like the other road
[1:56:02] that enter into the holy authorities and
[1:56:04] that came out without burden
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] ever here you got to be a special road
[1:56:11] that when you cross jordan because the
[1:56:14] veil also was death
[1:56:17] everybody here you gotta cross that veil
[1:56:21] and over there
[1:56:22] we're gonna check whether you see him
[1:56:24] taken up or not
[1:56:26] whether you have a revelation or not
[1:56:32] hallelujah let's go to john chapter 6

[1:57:15] me except he were given to him of my
[1:57:18] father
[1:57:20] from that time
[1:57:22] few of his disciple
[1:57:29] how many stayed
[1:57:31] how many really will make it
[1:57:37] many of his disciples went back
[1:57:41] jesus said something to cause them to go
[1:57:44] back
[1:57:47] and walk no more with him
[1:57:50] john 6
[1:57:52] 66

[1:59:04] gonna meet him in the upper room and who
[1:59:07] preached in the upper room

[2:03:05] so why
[2:03:08] didn't anybody
[2:03:10] from another tribe leave
[2:03:12] israel
[2:03:14] why he was not from the tribe of den
[2:03:18] why he was not from the tribe of
[2:03:20] issachar
[2:03:21] why he was not
[2:03:23] coming from the tribe of ruben he only
[2:03:26] came from the tribe of judah and
[2:03:28] specifically from bethlehem
[2:03:32] they had to leave bethlehem
[2:03:34] they have to cross the sea
[2:03:37] they have to cross the river to go over
[2:03:40] to the land of moab
[2:03:43] brother branham said the word bethlehem
[2:03:46] let's break it down
[2:03:48] b-e-t-h
[2:03:50] means house
[2:03:52] e-l means god
[2:03:55] e-l-h-m
[2:03:57] means bread
[2:03:59] so the house of god's bread
[2:04:04] so this family
[2:04:05] comes from the house
[2:04:07] of god's bread out from the tribe of
[2:04:11] judah
[2:04:13] what abraham continued he said
[2:04:15] half feeding he was then for the bread
[2:04:19] of life to come out of water
[2:04:22] house of water because when jesus christ
[2:04:25] came jesus said i am the living bread
[2:04:29] that came down from heaven
[2:04:32] and jesus also was born in bethlehem
[2:04:36] so bethlehem spoke about christ
[2:04:42] who was the living bread that came down
[2:04:45] from heaven
[2:04:47] he said your father did eat manna and
[2:04:50] they are dead but i am the bread that
[2:04:52] came down from heaven and the house of
[2:04:55] god's bread was in bethlehem and if
[2:04:58] jesus is the living bread so jesus must
[2:05:01] be born where the bread naturally was
[2:05:04] because what happened in the nature was
[2:05:07] a foretelling of christ that is coming
[2:05:10] in the future that's why jesus was born
[2:05:12] in bethlehem
[2:05:14] because jesus was the bread the living
[2:05:17] bread of god that came down from heaven
[2:05:20] oh it's a beautiful story
[2:05:23] if you notice how bethlehem was formed
[2:05:27] don't want to get on that subject
[2:05:29] actually rehab the harlot her son was
[2:05:33] the one her son was the one who founded
[2:05:35] bethlehem
[2:05:37] he was a wheat center
[2:05:40] and a lot of fine water day
[2:05:43] and he founded the little city and he
[2:05:45] was the smallest city of all the cities
[2:05:50] because the prophet said out of
[2:05:52] bethlehem of judea
[2:05:54] aren't you the least among the princes
[2:05:57] of judah
[2:05:58] but out of this shall come the water
[2:06:01] that governor was jesus christ
[2:06:05] which means the priest
[2:06:07] the governor
[2:06:09] hey
[2:06:10] that shall rule my people out of that
[2:06:14] little one so now we begin to understand
[2:06:18] that out of this bethlehem
[2:06:21] everybody here of judah because judah
[2:06:24] spoke about the royal seed
[2:06:28] the scepter shall never leave judah
[2:06:31] until who shallow comes and shallow was
[2:06:35] jesus christ
[2:06:36] but shallow cannot be born any place in
[2:06:40] judah he must be in the place where the
[2:06:43] bread center is that's why shallow
[2:06:46] entered judah but specifically in
[2:06:49] bethlehem because he was god's bread
[2:06:52] that came down from heaven everybody
[2:06:54] here so far
[2:06:56] so why are we using judah
[2:06:59] why it was a family from judah that have
[2:07:02] to depart from israel and go into the
[2:07:06] land of moab
[2:07:08] when we come back to the tabernacle that
[2:07:11] we are still in
[2:07:12] if you notice under the uh the
[2:07:17] at
[2:07:17] that circle right there the way the
[2:07:20] tabernacle was built
[2:07:25] if i can put it up here
[2:07:28] to make it easy on somebody
[2:07:30] you remember it now there are three
[2:07:32] places we have the other court we have
[2:07:35] the holy place and the holiest everybody
[2:07:38] and the gate was on the east side
[2:07:43] this was east
[2:07:45] this was north
[2:07:48] this was south
[2:07:50] and this was
[2:07:52] west if you need scripture on everything
[2:07:55] here you see me
[2:07:56] everybody okay
[2:07:58] now if you look here this tab and our
[2:08:00] call is placed this way but they kept
[2:08:04] the same direction to show you that
[2:08:06] there is side is coming this way because
[2:08:10] that's where the gate is
[2:08:12] here
[2:08:13] and if you remember when we talked about
[2:08:16] the inner veil of the tabernacle we
[2:08:19] found out that this veil that jesus
[2:08:22] right here everybody here
[2:08:25] was the same
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:27] color
[2:08:28] the same material as this door here
[2:08:32] you remember that and it was the same as
[2:08:35] the gate
[2:08:37] anybody here the only difference between
[2:08:40] this one
[2:08:41] and this one was that there was no
[2:08:44] caribbean
[2:08:46] anybody here in other words there was no
[2:08:48] blockage everybody care
[2:08:51] about here
[2:08:53] so
[2:08:54] if that is the case where are you taking
[2:08:56] me
[2:08:57] in the book of number chapter 2 verse 1
[2:09:01] the bible say and the lord spoken to
[2:09:03] moses
[2:09:04] and unto aaron saying
[2:09:07] every man
[2:09:08] of the children of israel shall pitch by
[2:09:12] his own standard
[2:09:15] so when the tabernacle was placed like
[2:09:18] this
[2:09:19] israel was around the tabernacle
[2:09:23] anybody care
[2:09:24] but israel was not around the tabernacle
[2:09:28] any kind of way
[2:09:31] they were around the tub and now caught
[2:09:34] by order
[2:09:36] anybody here there were three tribes
[2:09:39] that pitched on the north
[2:09:42] three tribe that pitch on the east west
[2:09:45] three tribes here and three tribe there
[2:09:49] three
[2:09:50] six
[2:09:52] nine twelve which brings worship
[2:09:57] anybody okay
[2:09:58] anybody
[2:09:59] everybody okay
[2:10:01] now
[2:10:02] among those three tribes
[2:10:04] one of the tree was the top of the traps
[2:10:09] everybody okay
[2:10:10] and that top of the tree
[2:10:13] had a standard or a flag
[2:10:17] anybody okay so when they were camping
[2:10:20] that tribe will put up its flag
[2:10:24] and this one among the three one of them
[2:10:28] will put up the flag
[2:10:29] and this one over here the one that is
[2:10:32] greater put up the flag and the one that
[2:10:34] is greater put up the flag so there were
[2:10:37] four flags
[2:10:39] around the
[2:10:40] tabernacle anybody okay
[2:10:44] i'm not gonna get in detail i'm trying
[2:10:45] to stay on the highway
[2:10:47] he said
[2:10:48] pitch by his own standing
[2:10:52] with the inside of their father's house
[2:10:55] so the flag was not just a blank flag
[2:10:59] it was a flag that have a figure or an
[2:11:03] image
[2:11:05] and the image was talking about the
[2:11:08] patriarch
[2:11:09] in other words if right here
[2:11:12] they choose
[2:11:13] reuben
[2:11:14] but here the image of rubrik was a man
[2:11:18] so this flag will have a man ready
[2:11:21] anybody okay
[2:11:23] on the west side
[2:11:24] it was ephraim
[2:11:26] and the flag of ephraim was a knox
[2:11:29] so you're gonna see a knock showing over
[2:11:32] there
[2:11:34] everybody okay
[2:11:35] if you need scripture see me
[2:11:38] on the north side they picked them
[2:11:41] and then
[2:11:43] was an eagle
[2:11:47] anybody here so now you can see that
[2:11:50] they kerry beams
[2:11:52] were actually camping on top of the
[2:11:56] traps
[2:11:57] everybody here
[2:11:59] so these three tribes were controlled by
[2:12:02] a caribbean
[2:12:03] and these three tribes were controlled
[2:12:06] by the caribbeans and this one caribbean
[2:12:09] and this one caribbean therefore the
[2:12:12] throne of god
[2:12:14] must be in the midst of them because in
[2:12:17] heaven the caribbeans are around the
[2:12:20] full throne that's why god was dwelling
[2:12:23] in the tabernacle
[2:12:24] and the
[2:12:25] kerry beams were around him
[2:12:29] everybody okay
[2:12:31] now who was on the east side on the
[2:12:34] inside
[2:12:36] to all the water
[2:12:39] the sun
[2:12:40] rises on the east
[2:12:45] but the sunset
[2:12:47] is on the waist
[2:12:52] on the east side
[2:12:54] to all the rising of the sun
[2:12:57] shall they of the standard of the camp
[2:13:00] of who
[2:13:03] so
[2:13:04] judah when do you want
[2:13:07] to enter the tabernacle do you follow me
[2:13:12] there was only one gate
[2:13:16] everybody okay
[2:13:18] that gate
[2:13:19] was on the inside
[2:13:21] did you get it
[2:13:23] and that gate
[2:13:25] the one who was chief
[2:13:28] that was protecting that gate towards
[2:13:30] judah
[2:13:32] amen
[2:13:34] anybody okay
[2:13:36] so for you to get into the tabernacle
[2:13:42] did you fail do you follow me
[2:13:44] you must pass by judah
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:50] are you okay
[2:13:51] if you go by ruben you're not gonna see
[2:13:54] the gate
[2:13:55] if you go by ephraim you're not going to
[2:13:59] see the gate
[2:14:00] if you go by them you're not going to
[2:14:02] see the gate the gate was only one gate
[2:14:05] and they get must come out of judah
[2:14:10] because the savior must come out of
[2:14:13] judah
[2:14:19] everybody okay because jesus said i am
[2:14:22] the door
[2:14:25] everybody here
[2:14:27] when the veil of the tabernacle was
[2:14:30] ripped the bible said they ripped his
[2:14:32] own veil
[2:14:34] and jesus said straight is the gate
[2:14:39] jesus was the gate
[2:14:41] so this guilt is crushed
[2:14:45] this door is crushed
[2:14:48] this veil is christ
[2:14:52] and the tabernacle is christ
[2:14:56] that's why brother branham said when you
[2:14:58] read the bible and you don't see jesus
[2:15:00] christ in every passage yes you are
[2:15:03] reading the bible wrong
[2:15:09] if you want to enter the gate you must
[2:15:12] enter by judah
[2:15:15] ever here
[2:15:17] hallelujah
[2:15:19] but
[2:15:21] uh uh
[2:15:22] the number 338 bad dose
[2:15:29] take number 10
[2:15:32] i cannot go under pressure i'm going to
[2:15:34] go straight if we stop we stop where
[2:15:36] we're going to start
[2:15:38] let's go in number
[2:15:41] chapter 10
[2:15:43] the gate
[2:15:45] is judah
[2:15:47] you want to enter the tabernacle judah
[2:15:50] must give you the permission
[2:15:53] if not judah will kill you
[2:15:57] everybody here
[2:15:58] so when you entering the tabernacle you
[2:16:01] passing judah then you see the gate
[2:16:04] anybody okay
[2:16:06] number chapter 10 and the lord spoke to
[2:16:08] moses saying
[2:16:10] make you two trumpets of silva i'm not
[2:16:13] going to touch that i'm trying to stay
[2:16:14] on the main line
[2:16:16] of all pieces shall you make them that
[2:16:19] you may use them for the calling of
[2:16:22] assembly
[2:16:23] and for the journey of the camp
[2:16:27] are you okay
[2:16:29] so this trumpet
[2:16:31] if god want to speak to the people when
[2:16:33] they blow the trumpet he gathered the
[2:16:35] people
[2:16:37] or if they blow the trumpet he tells you
[2:16:41] everybody need to move
[2:16:43] so now you need to know which sound is
[2:16:45] it a sound to gather you up or is it a
[2:16:48] sound to tell you everybody stand up we
[2:16:51] need to start moving
[2:16:54] verse three and when they blow with them
[2:16:57] all
[2:16:58] assembly shall assemble themselves to
[2:17:01] you at the door
[2:17:03] now you begin to understand the door
[2:17:05] they didn't say the gate the door
[2:17:08] the door of the tabernacle of the
[2:17:11] congregation
[2:17:12] verse 4 and if they blow but with one
[2:17:16] trumpet then the princes which are the
[2:17:19] head of the thousand of israel shall
[2:17:21] gather themselves to you i'm trying to
[2:17:23] stay away
[2:17:25] verse five
[2:17:26] when you block an alarm
[2:17:29] an alarm is telling you now it is not to
[2:17:32] gather the people because god is trying
[2:17:34] to speak an alarm means everybody need
[2:17:36] to stand because we need to move
[2:17:39] the whole camp israel needs to move he
[2:17:41] said when you blow an alarm
[2:17:45] then the camps
[2:17:47] that lie on the water
[2:17:50] who was the camp that was on the east
[2:17:53] side
[2:17:54] part shall go water
[2:17:57] so
[2:17:58] when
[2:17:59] you want to move israel
[2:18:02] and you want to move the tabernacle
[2:18:05] the first camp
[2:18:07] that begin to show the direction in
[2:18:09] other words they want to have the gps
[2:18:12] everybody here they want to move first
[2:18:15] the one that is ahead
[2:18:17] is judah
[2:18:20] so not only is judah protecting the
[2:18:24] interest
[2:18:26] but judah is the first one to move
[2:18:29] if you go home
[2:18:31] and you and you read this entire chapter
[2:18:34] you will see that the first one was
[2:18:36] judah and then the second one was ruben
[2:18:40] and then the third one was ephraim
[2:18:44] and the last one was then
[2:18:47] they were moving like a clock
[2:18:51] because the clock goes this way
[2:18:53] that's why brother branham said if you
[2:18:56] want to know the time of god
[2:18:59] look at the movement of the jew
[2:19:01] they will tell you the time of god
[2:19:04] because the way israel does things it is
[2:19:07] a clock to us
[2:19:11] if you see the jews doing something they
[2:19:14] are giving you a clock
[2:19:16] and the first one that moved was judah
[2:19:19] and the gate was judah
[2:19:23] everybody okay
[2:19:25] we have not finished yet
[2:19:27] number chapter 3 verse 38 it's on the
[2:19:29] board
[2:19:31] but those
[2:19:33] that guarding camp before the tabernacle
[2:19:35] to all the water
[2:19:38] we already know in the east who was
[2:19:40] camping there
[2:19:41] judah
[2:19:42] even before the tabernacle of the
[2:19:45] congregation his word shall be who
[2:19:49] and who
[2:19:50] and who
[2:19:56] let me push your tabernacle here
[2:19:58] okay
[2:19:59] your tabernacle is right here
[2:20:03] are the robert don't betray me everybody
[2:20:05] okay
[2:20:06] are you there
[2:20:08] we have the heart the other coat
[2:20:10] we have the holy place we have the holy
[2:20:13] of holies we got three tribes here
[2:20:16] three here three here here we got the
[2:20:19] gate
[2:20:20] and there is a tribe here that is chief
[2:20:23] and that tribe is judah
[2:20:26] and this tribe was the tribe from where
[2:20:28] the king were coming out
[2:20:31] that's why when everything moved judah
[2:20:33] must be there because he's the king
[2:20:36] everybody okay
[2:20:37] and not only that
[2:20:39] now in number chapter 3 we found out
[2:20:42] that on the same angle
[2:20:45] on the east side
[2:20:47] was a place here for moses
[2:20:51] a prophet
[2:20:53] [Music]
[2:20:56] are we okay are we okay
[2:20:59] and there was a place for aaron
[2:21:03] plus
[2:21:04] his sons
[2:21:06] the high priest
[2:21:10] and his son
[2:21:12] anybody here
[2:21:14] judah spoke about the king
[2:21:18] anybody here
[2:21:20] everybody okay
[2:21:21] so when you trying
[2:21:23] to get in the tabernacle
[2:21:26] you are actually passing the king
[2:21:30] and the priest
[2:21:37] anybody here ever here because what
[2:21:40] happened in the old testament was only
[2:21:43] an image
[2:21:45] of what is happening on the future
[2:21:47] telling you that the door to the true
[2:21:51] tabernacle of heaven
[2:21:53] must be
[2:21:54] through a priest who is king.
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:01] everybody okay
[2:22:02] and we found also in hebrews 7 that
[2:22:07] there was a man called melchizedek
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:11] and mckinsey that was king and water
[2:22:15] he was speaking about melchizedek right
[2:22:18] here
[2:22:19] because melchizedek was jesus christ
[2:22:27] everybody okay
[2:22:29] so if you want to enter the tabernacle
[2:22:31] you will pass a man
[2:22:33] that is both king and priest and he's
[2:22:37] also a prophet
[2:22:39] [Music]
[2:22:43] do you hear me
[2:22:45] son of man prophet
[2:22:48] priest son of god
[2:22:50] king son of david all three were
[2:22:53] gathered up here
[2:23:01] ever here
[2:23:03] and this image of melchizedek
[2:23:06] is an image that opened the door to the
[2:23:10] gentler
[2:23:13] because melchizedek when he died who was
[2:23:16] jesus christ he ripped the tail and we
[2:23:19] found last sunday that he broke the
[2:23:22] the wall of partition he broke the
[2:23:25] enmity that was between us and the
[2:23:28] jewish people now god can get his
[2:23:31] children from the jews and from the
[2:23:33] water
[2:23:36] everybody here because the levitical
[2:23:38] priesthood was restricted to the jewish
[2:23:40] people now melchizedek have to do it
[2:23:44] ever here
[2:23:45] so god has a daughter
[2:23:51] who was not you
[2:23:55] but she was jew
[2:23:58] she was not jew by birth
[2:24:02] because paul told us they choose you
[2:24:05] you remember the true israel ever here
[2:24:08] so that's why
[2:24:10] when god wanted to rescue his children
[2:24:13] he could not get this levitical here
[2:24:18] because the levitical priesthood was
[2:24:20] restricted to the jewish people
[2:24:24] but we found that out of judah
[2:24:27] come david
[2:24:30] everybody okay and david begin to behave
[2:24:34] differently
[2:24:37] everybody okay
[2:24:39] david even went and took gentile
[2:24:42] and brought them into the tabernacle
[2:24:45] and god never killed him
[2:24:47] everybody care about here so the tribe
[2:24:51] of judah had the scepter and according
[2:24:54] to the uh to esther acceptor have a
[2:24:58] power to override the law
[2:25:00] [Music]
[2:25:02] everybody okay
[2:25:03] so in order to redeem a child of god
[2:25:08] that is not born in israel
[2:25:10] the door must leave israel
[2:25:16] judah must go
[2:25:19] ever here
[2:25:20] somebody out of judah must move out
[2:25:24] to take the door and to bring the door
[2:25:27] into agenda
[2:25:29] [Applause]
[2:25:32] because if you enter by judah nobody
[2:25:35] will touch you in israel
[2:25:37] if you enter by any other tribe you're
[2:25:40] gonna get in trouble so somebody from
[2:25:42] bethlehem judah must leave israel and go
[2:25:47] to the gentile
[2:25:48] [Applause]
[2:25:50] [Music]
[2:25:54] everybody okay
[2:25:55] everybody okay and the emblem of judah
[2:25:58] was water
[2:25:59] the lion of the tribe of water
[2:26:02] have prevailed
[2:26:04] everybody okay
[2:26:06] everybody okay
[2:26:08] what are we going with brother stephen
[2:26:11] brother branham said we are building a
[2:26:13] house you must put your right upright
[2:26:18] and everything else brother wood and
[2:26:20] some of this carpenter and contractor
[2:26:23] here could tell us how to build your
[2:26:25] house
[2:26:26] but i'm going to tell you how to build
[2:26:28] your spiritual house
[2:26:31] because the tabernacle was a house
[2:26:34] according to exodus 25 god told moses
[2:26:38] build me a house i want to dwell among
[2:26:40] you
[2:26:42] everybody
[2:26:44] but i'm going to tell you how to build
[2:26:48] your spiritual house where god can dwell
[2:26:51] he wants you to dwell in he want to make
[2:26:54] you like himself
[2:26:56] he wants you to be he wants you to be
[2:26:59] reflected
[2:27:00] reflecting rather his being
[2:27:03] just like god live in the tabernacle
[2:27:07] just like god live in jesus christ god
[2:27:10] now want to live in you
[2:27:13] and use you as a tabernacle or a
[2:27:16] dwelling place where he can reflect
[2:27:18] himself
[2:27:19] [Music]
[2:27:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:27:25] now brother branham say we want to give
[2:27:28] one more illustration little
[2:27:30] illustration in the fifth verse here
[2:27:33] and then we shall start over get our
[2:27:35] sixth verse and start off now i want you
[2:27:38] to notice in the plan of redemption
[2:27:42] because remember
[2:27:44] whatever happened in the tabernacle
[2:27:48] was only showing us the step of god how
[2:27:52] to save men
[2:27:54] you remember that
[2:27:56] and now we are in the book of ruth
[2:27:59] brother branham say i want you to notice
[2:28:02] in the plan of redemption how god
[2:28:05] foreshadowed it
[2:28:07] he worked it out perfectly in who
[2:28:10] and who
[2:28:11] so just as we saw the steps in the
[2:28:15] tabernacle the life of roof also is
[2:28:18] showing you steps
[2:28:19] why do we need this to unfold you more
[2:28:23] something
[2:28:26] hallelujah
[2:28:27] blessed be the name of the lord now we
[2:28:30] found out that on the process of time
[2:28:35] elimelech died you read it in the bible
[2:28:39] then the two sons of elimelech got
[2:28:42] married to two women
[2:28:45] the door moved
[2:28:47] and out of all moab the door pulled two
[2:28:50] people
[2:28:52] and hooked them
[2:28:53] and pull them up
[2:28:55] but remember they are not in israel
[2:28:57] they are still outside
[2:28:59] the door must take them
[2:29:01] to pull them back into the promised land
[2:29:07] everybody okay
[2:29:08] they are not in israel
[2:29:10] anybody okay
[2:29:11] so when the two nuts went
[2:29:14] and hooked the hook to oppa
[2:29:17] and they also
[2:29:19] uh
[2:29:20] uh hooked to roof
[2:29:22] now if you notice this entire story it's
[2:29:25] only four chapters
[2:29:27] none of them
[2:29:28] got pregnant
[2:29:32] anybody okay
[2:29:33] when they were married in more album
[2:29:36] no life
[2:29:40] anybody here
[2:29:42] how much how much intimate relationship
[2:29:46] happen
[2:29:47] for some reason there is no children
[2:29:54] so the first marriage of roof
[2:29:58] i don't know what happened to this
[2:30:00] they keep going in the first marriage of
[2:30:03] rufus have no children
[2:30:06] the first marriage of oprah no children
[2:30:10] the marriage is there but no children
[2:30:13] and does these two women
[2:30:16] enter into this family by
[2:30:20] marriage
[2:30:23] what is going on
[2:30:26] anybody care
[2:30:29] the interest in the family
[2:30:32] is very important
[2:30:35] amen
[2:30:37] when you enter
[2:30:38] by marriage outside the promised land
[2:30:47] he got it i'm waiting for it
[2:30:50] when you enter by marriage outside the
[2:30:54] promised land
[2:30:55] anybody care
[2:30:59] you are in the family
[2:31:02] you are in the environment
[2:31:07] everybody
[2:31:08] you are gracious to be part of the
[2:31:10] family
[2:31:12] all part of an environment
[2:31:17] anybody here anybody here
[2:31:20] but
[2:31:21] you silly moab
[2:31:28] okay
[2:31:29] anybody okay
[2:31:30] the door left israel
[2:31:33] and went into the gentile
[2:31:35] because the door is trying to rescue the
[2:31:38] children of god
[2:31:39] that were born into gender and pulled
[2:31:42] them back again to israel everybody when
[2:31:45] they don't went there with the religion
[2:31:48] of israel because israel even them if
[2:31:52] they move to another nation they always
[2:31:54] keep their religion that's why esther
[2:31:57] and mordecai got in trouble because they
[2:31:59] were keeping their religion wherever
[2:32:01] they were ever so the religion of israel
[2:32:04] went with the tribe of judah america so
[2:32:08] when you enter there you are at the
[2:32:11] first interest of roof was an interest
[2:32:14] by marriage
[2:32:20] and an interest by filial marriage

[2:48:15] women crossed water
[2:48:17] job to verse 30
[2:48:19] thus cleansing them from all water
[2:48:24] and appointed the words of the priest
[2:48:26] and liver everyone into his water
[2:48:29] they took all of those children
[2:48:33] and they kicked them out all of you go
[2:48:36] back where you came from
[2:48:41] getting married into the family you are
[2:48:44] still
[2:48:45] vulnerable to be kicked out
[2:48:51] you're not there yet
[2:48:53] and let me stop here because i'm gonna
[2:48:56] go go to first king chapter 11
[2:49:03] the gift took time
[2:49:06] first king chapter 11
[2:49:09] and then i'll let you go home and you
[2:49:11] chew on this
[2:49:14] look how you get into the message
[2:49:20] if you're staying in that marriage
[2:49:22] because you just need a husband
[2:49:24] something is wrong
[2:49:28] you need to go now beyond your marriage
[2:49:32] everybody care
[2:49:34] because sometimes some of the marriage
[2:49:35] because you are a lot of trouble
[2:49:40] verse 11
[2:49:42] 11 verse 1
[2:49:44] but king solomon
[2:49:46] loved many strange women
[2:49:51] let me ask you a question was solomon
[2:49:55] from the land of judah
[2:50:00] from which trouble
[2:50:02] because he was the son of david
[2:50:05] right
[2:50:06] how can judah marry a woman and god is
[2:50:09] striking
[2:50:11] by roof garden and nobody say nothing
[2:50:18] yet both of them are judah
[2:50:23] this message
[2:50:26] this message
[2:50:28] let's go
[2:50:30] and king solomon love many strange women
[2:50:33] together with the daughter of pharaoh
[2:50:36] women of moabites
[2:50:39] ammonite
[2:50:41] edomite
[2:50:42] zardonian
[2:50:44] and high tax
[2:50:46] of the nations concerning which the lord
[2:50:50] said to the children of israel you shall
[2:50:52] not go into them neither shall they come
[2:50:56] into you for surely they will turn away
[2:50:59] your heart after the what
[2:51:02] we already talked about this in a hotel
[2:51:04] so solomon clung to this
[2:51:07] in what
[2:51:09] your filio
[2:51:10] he's just so cute
[2:51:12] he's better than some of the message
[2:51:14] believer you know
[2:51:18] i just sit with them we've been working
[2:51:20] together she's good
[2:51:22] i didn't see anything wrong
[2:51:24] with her because our women have high
[2:51:26] temper
[2:51:28] you money the zipporah sometimes
[2:51:32] if you need a coach you see me
[2:51:35] everybody here
[2:51:36] everybody
[2:51:37] oh no no no they're good that's why i
[2:51:39] married her and she said she has nothing
[2:51:41] with coming to our church
[2:51:51] and he had 700 wives
[2:51:55] it takes two years or something for him
[2:51:58] to come back to the first one
[2:52:00] princess and three because there's 365
[2:52:03] days so
[2:52:06] [Music]
[2:52:09] that's why stay away from polygamy
[2:52:13] stay away
[2:52:18] the men can the man can demand can one
[2:52:21] you already have blood pressure
[2:52:24] you wanna handle too
[2:52:27] i'm going to bury you
[2:52:31] and 300 concubines
[2:52:34] stay with your wife
[2:52:37] and 300 concubine and his wife turn away
[2:52:42] his heart
[2:52:43] look at the wisdom of solomon
[2:52:45] but he could not control them
[2:52:48] anybody care i'm almost done
[2:52:51] for he came to pass when solomon was old
[2:52:57] when his strength
[2:52:59] began to decrease
[2:53:02] do you know why they were there till he
[2:53:04] was old
[2:53:07] do you know how solomon was
[2:53:09] do you remember when solomon was taken
[2:53:11] out of the throne
[2:53:13] when his son got into the throne
[2:53:16] israel came to solomon and said please
[2:53:20] your father yoke upon us was too strong
[2:53:25] please decrease what your father did
[2:53:27] solomon was a strong disciplined man
[2:53:31] he makes israel work harder and the
[2:53:33] economy of israel went higher
[2:53:37] but under legalistic
[2:53:39] because he went outside of the word of
[2:53:41] god he tried to control things by law
[2:53:44] they waited till he get tired
[2:53:46] then when they see his gun don't shoot
[2:53:48] good no more they say we got him now
[2:53:52] now he's not as strong he can't yell
[2:53:54] anymore
[2:53:55] anybody care
[2:53:57] and he's that his wife verse 4 turn away
[2:54:00] his heart after the water
[2:54:03] and his heart was not perfect with the
[2:54:06] lord his god as was the heart of david
[2:54:09] his father for solomon went after
[2:54:11] asterisk the goddess of the sardonia
[2:54:14] and after malcolm the abomination of the
[2:54:17] ammonite and solomon did evil in the
[2:54:20] sight of the lord and went not fully
[2:54:22] after the lord as did david his father
[2:54:26] then did solomon built a high place can
[2:54:29] you imagine for chemos
[2:54:32] the abomination of the moabite of moab
[2:54:35] in the hill that is before jerusalem and
[2:54:39] for moloch
[2:54:40] is the abomination of the children of
[2:54:42] water
[2:54:43] question and then i close here and we're
[2:54:46] going to pick it up
[2:54:48] these women
[2:54:50] came married to judah brother stephen
[2:54:52] you said judah was the door
[2:54:55] why
[2:54:56] are these children god even remind the
[2:54:59] children of israel in nehemiah telling
[2:55:02] them you remember what solomon did
[2:55:04] that was bad i thought if you married
[2:55:07] through judah you're okay and matter of
[2:55:09] fact brother stephen you say that
[2:55:11] roof was married outside the promised
[2:55:13] land
[2:55:14] but if you look at this they were they
[2:55:17] were married in the promised land so why
[2:55:19] are they bad
[2:55:24] i'm helping you with your question
[2:55:26] before you ask me i'm just asking myself
[2:55:30] okay why
[2:55:31] why why before you reason don't go home
[2:55:34] reasoning let me
[2:55:35] handle it
[2:55:36] why
[2:55:38] you ready then i close here
[2:55:41] you ready
[2:55:43] these women got married
[2:55:46] when they were younger
[2:55:51] and solomon was tough
[2:55:55] and solomon could control the home
[2:55:58] solomon could control the wife
[2:56:01] and for advantage of a wealthy man like
[2:56:04] solomon
[2:56:05] for advantage of a wealthy of having a
[2:56:08] husband because i stood so long nobody's
[2:56:11] coding me for advantage of trying to
[2:56:14] find a wife because i like her the way
[2:56:16] her shape looks like
[2:56:18] for advantage that woman hold off
[2:56:21] because she want to get a husband
[2:56:23] that men hold off because she just want
[2:56:25] to get a good wife those children hold
[2:56:27] off because if you don't do what daddy
[2:56:30] say in the message my daddy will kick us
[2:56:32] out of home so we gotta stay in our home
[2:56:34] and do what daddy do by law
[2:56:37] so that we can stay with our home and
[2:56:38] daddy will pay my school fee and he will
[2:56:40] buy me my car but one day when i will go
[2:56:43] i will get 18 years old when i can go to
[2:56:46] my home i will do what i want to do
[2:56:51] everybody okay
[2:56:53] what i'm trying to say is
[2:56:56] no matter the years these women live in
[2:56:59] israel they never were converted
[2:57:05] [Music]
[2:57:08] they were in israel condoning to the
[2:57:11] religion of israel but they were still
[2:57:14] hiding their gods
[2:57:16] waiting for an opportunity to show up
[2:57:19] the color
[2:57:20] as soon as they are independent they can
[2:57:23] come to church no more
[2:57:25] and daddy cannot tell them anymore
[2:57:27] because daddy doesn't pay my bill i live
[2:57:29] in my own apartment i can choose what i
[2:57:31] want i don't have to be in your church
[2:57:33] anymore
[2:57:34] [Music]
[2:57:39] i was just waiting to transfer to
[2:57:41] transfer to another university then i'm
[2:57:44] off
[2:57:46] if i transfer to another university i'm
[2:57:48] going to move away from my parents then
[2:57:50] i can live my own life
[2:57:52] [Music]

[2:57:56] ruth said naomi where you go i will go
[2:58:00] with you when you die i will die your
[2:58:03] god your god will be my god
[2:58:07] in other words i'm rejecting the other
[2:58:09] god i'm clinging to a new god that is
[2:58:12] the difference let's stand
[2:58:27] which step are you in with the lord
[2:58:30] the tabernacle help you see whether you
[2:58:33] are in the other court

[2:58:42] somebody who lived in a holy place if
[2:58:44] you miss this sermon you need to go back
[2:58:46] and listen to it and if you're a young
[2:58:48] man go back and review it two three

[2:58:52] god i don't care if my now roof is
[2:58:55] unfolding as more and giving us more
[2:58:58] clue how to really enter the tabernacle

[2:59:04] come in the message
[2:59:05] you came in the message because you were
[2:59:07] born into it
[2:59:10] and that's why you come to church
[2:59:12] you need now to leave that state
[2:59:15] if you're coming to this church because
[2:59:17] mommy and daddy are brought in here
[2:59:19] brought you here they bro they are
[2:59:21] bringing you to this church you need to
[2:59:23] move from there and see the god that

[3:00:26] going to hell because of you if my wife
[3:00:29] doesn't want to come to church i would

[3:00:37] your car i'm going to drop the other one
[3:00:39] i don't want to be late in church
[3:00:41] that's where you want to be
[3:00:43] how did you enter in the message
[3:00:47] did you enter by meeting the door
[3:00:50] did you meet judah or you enter by
[3:00:53] relationship
[3:00:54] or you enter because you are looking for
[3:00:56] a wife or you enter because you are
[3:00:58] looking for a husband or you enter
[3:00:59] because you were friend to the people in
[3:01:01] the message and the more you want to
[3:01:02] hang out with them you suddenly find
[3:01:05] yourself believing what they believe in
[3:01:07] but you truly don't understand why you
[3:01:09] believe in what they're believing you
[3:01:10] just found yourself doing everything
[3:01:12] they want to do
[3:01:13] [Music]
[3:01:14] this is why you see the carnality in the
[3:01:17] message
[3:01:19] why you see the prejudice in the message
[3:01:21] why you see people acting the way they
[3:01:23] acting why you see preacher acting the
[3:01:26] way that they're acting why you see
[3:01:27] people forming clicks people that don't
[3:01:30] like other or if that pastor is white
[3:01:33] i'm not going to be his pastor
[3:01:35] you see that if that pastor is black no
[3:01:38] my pastor have to be black or my pastor
[3:01:40] have to be white or my person have to be
[3:01:42] hispanic or he must be canadian or he
[3:01:44] must be this all other carnality
[3:01:47] go check them
[3:01:48] how did they believe the message
[3:01:52] how did they enter in the message
[3:01:56] because your first husband must die
[3:02:00] marion must die killian must die
[3:02:03] that relationship must be ended
[3:02:07] i am not saying divorce your husband but
[3:02:10] what but but but the hook you are
[3:02:12] holding to you must cut that off you
[3:02:14] need something more sure
[3:02:16] you need an anchor
[3:02:20] that if my husband goes to hell not me
[3:02:26] a bigger husband god kill
[3:02:28] him but they have about every girl move
[3:02:31] on
[3:02:32] she didn't say i love my husband if you
[3:02:35] kill my husband kill me too no you're
[3:02:36] going to the grave yourself
[3:02:42] i'm telling you why you wearing tight
[3:02:44] dresses because my husband loved it
[3:02:48] why are you wearing a splitter my
[3:02:49] husband didn't say something is wrong
[3:02:52] [Music]
[3:02:58] let's pray heavenly father
[3:03:01] lord we are approaching you humbly this
[3:03:03] morning again
[3:03:05] father thanking you for your grace
[3:03:07] for your love and for your mercy
[3:03:10] father i don't want to hold the people
[3:03:12] too long
[3:03:13] i have to stop where i stop
[3:03:15] but lord at least one point was taken
[3:03:17] across
[3:03:18] that they need to examine their self
[3:03:21] whether they are in the faith
[3:03:23] no there is a lot of shaking that is
[3:03:25] happening
[3:03:26] there is a lot of things that are coming
[3:03:29] because the coming of the lord is
[3:03:31] imminent and we can see clearly prophecy
[3:03:34] we can see how the pressure are building
[3:03:36] up for another third world war but we
[3:03:39] know we're not going to be here
[3:03:41] because lord before any atomic bomb drop
[3:03:43] will be outlawed but we don't want to
[3:03:46] say that because it's just a coat
[3:03:48] because it thinks that the preachers say
[3:03:51] but father we want to examine ourself
[3:03:54] whether we truly believe
[3:03:56] whether we really met you
[3:03:58] whether we had a personal experience
[3:04:01] that we can say that it's true i was
[3:04:03] born in this message but i remember one
[3:04:06] day
[3:04:07] i had an experience with god
[3:04:09] it's true something happened to me i was
[3:04:11] brought by a son i was brought by a
[3:04:14] friend i was brought to the message by a
[3:04:16] neighbor because i saw them living good
[3:04:19] but one of this day i met a god of this
[3:04:22] message and today the one who brought me
[3:04:26] the message is already backslidden but i
[3:04:28] am still there because i met the god
[3:04:31] that's what we want to see that's where
[3:04:34] i want the young men to see that's where
[3:04:36] i want the order to see whether they
[3:04:38] were born in the mercy whether they were
[3:04:40] 20 years in the message whether 40 years
[3:04:43] in a message father bring them a
[3:04:45] searching in their life that this can
[3:04:48] live from the religious send point of
[3:04:51] going to sunday in the morning
[3:04:53] versus it becomes a relationship a life
[3:04:56] that you are speaking to them when they
[3:04:58] are cooking you are speaking to them
[3:05:00] when they are driving you are speaking
[3:05:02] to them when they're sitting at home you
[3:05:04] are speaking to them all the life began
[3:05:07] to get wrapped up around you lord may
[3:05:10] you help everybody in this church may
[3:05:12] they don't miss this opportunity to
[3:05:15] examine their life lord and to make sure
[3:05:18] that they're standing in the faith and
[3:05:19] if there is somebody lord father this
[3:05:21] morning that is not where they are
[3:05:23] supposed to be father may you touch the
[3:05:26] heart
[3:05:29] the altar
[3:05:30] is if you know your life
[3:05:34] that you were born in this message
[3:05:36] and if you know in your heart
[3:05:38] that you are not where you supposed to
[3:05:40] be doing
[3:05:41] because the life that you live is
[3:05:44] telling you exactly that you are just
[3:05:47] wearing those dresses because that's how
[3:05:49] you grow up
[3:05:50] but truly your heart
[3:05:52] is pulling for things of the world
[3:05:54] your heart your desire your appetite
[3:05:57] is to project yourself in some kind of a
[3:06:00] world
[3:06:01] because the message world is too boring
[3:06:03] for you
[3:06:04] may you wake up
[3:06:05] may you fix and make your life correct
[3:06:09] with the lord the soldier is open if you
[3:06:12] need to pray you need to come and pray
[3:06:14] if you have to pray where you standing
[3:06:16] you need to stay right there because the
[3:06:18] true altar is in your heart where you
[3:06:21] can make peace with god where you can
[3:06:24] check your life where you can make sure
[3:06:27] that really i know i am in this world i
[3:06:30] didn't follow my daddy
[3:06:32] i didn't come here because my daddy left
[3:06:34] that's why i left and i have to follow
[3:06:36] him but i came because i know the god
[3:06:39] that my mommy was telling me i know the
[3:06:41] god that my daddy was telling me i know
[3:06:44] the god that my friend was telling me
[3:06:46] now i know because the challenge are
[3:06:48] coming where elijah was given many
[3:06:51] challenges to stay behind but that
[3:06:54] prophet keep following keep following
[3:06:56] keep following while later on giazi had
[3:07:00] the same opportunity but he ended up in
[3:07:02] leprosy because he was after the things
[3:07:05] of the world lord may you granted unto
[3:07:07] them the desire of the heart and if
[3:07:09] somebody need to make peace with you
[3:07:12] father we still have time this morning
[3:07:14] that we can bring them to the altar and
[3:07:16] father lord jesus christ they can die at
[3:07:19] the brazen altar and they can rededicate
[3:07:21] their life again and make sure they're
[3:07:24] moving quickly because sooner that door
[3:07:27] is going to be closed sooner lord father
[3:07:29] that throne won't be a lamb anymore but
[3:07:32] surely it's going to be the lion and
[3:07:34] lord there won't be blood on the mercy
[3:07:36] seat
[3:07:37] father we commit them unto their hand in
[3:07:39] the name of jesus christ
[3:07:42] hallelujah
[3:07:45] [Music]
[3:08:03] shout to the lord
[3:08:08] let us
