[31:16] um y'all forgive me for my
[31:18] nervousness um I had a situation that
[31:22] happened on Thursday where I was at a
[31:24] gas
[31:25] station and um this homeless man
[31:29] he saw me and he randomly pulled a knife
[31:31] out on me and he started walking towards
[31:34] me just making a direct beine and my
[31:38] first instinct was to just yell at him
[31:40] and say Sir Put The Knife Down and
[31:43] luckily I was close enough to my truck
[31:44] where I could get in and I put it in
[31:46] drive and I just took off but before I
[31:49] took off he came up to to the side of my
[31:51] truck and it was just this emotionless
[31:55] dead look on his face and I just wanted
[31:58] to thank the Lord for his
[32:00] protection but I felt such a sense of
[32:03] compassion for the
[32:05] man and I don't know what was going on
[32:07] in his life I don't know what was going
[32:09] on in his mind but I just ask that you
[32:11] all to keep him in prayer and just and I
[32:14] don't you know only God knows what he's
[32:16] going through but you could just
[32:18] remember
[32:19] him and I just want to sing this song
[32:22] for the glory of the Lord

[50:36] Christian okay so Christian say okay so
[50:39] you are already doomed
[50:41] amen so it's March the 29th for the
[50:44] young men meeting so we don't take too
[50:46] long again like we did last year and
[50:49] then on April the 26 that is our next
[50:53] question and answer the second quarterly
[50:55] and the appreciation dinner is April the
[50:59] 12th so you know who you are you who
[51:02] have been doing work in the Church
[51:04] musician technician whoever everybody
[51:07] you know who you are so just know that
[51:10] April the 12 that is the appreciation
[51:13] dinner we will put the information in
[51:16] the church group chat and you get
[51:17] everything together the bonfire I'm
[51:20] still not sure on that we will work on
[51:22] that by God's grace uh sister Destiny
[51:26] was the dismiss she's at home baby's
[51:29] doing good am I saw some nice picture
[51:32] for the pastor baby looks really really
[51:35] really good amen but the doctor
[51:38] recommended for them to stay because of
[51:40] the flu going on that they need to stay
[51:43] a little bit away from uh uh the people
[51:47] so the baby's at home doing wonderful I
[51:50] saw Ariana carrying the baby he was
[51:53] really so these are the secret of the
[51:54] pastor and it looks very very good and
[51:57] the fight already started at home who's
[51:58] going to hold the baby first so we try
[52:01] to figure out who's going to hold the
[52:03] baby first amen but brother abble and
[52:05] sister Destiny and the baby are doing
[52:08] wonderful by God's grace amen Amen on
[52:11] Wednesday I mention about brother Sean
[52:14] Martin's meeting and if you can you can
[52:18] go and I say that you can go on Friday
[52:21] you can go on uh Saturday but on Sunday
[52:25] you need to be back to your church so I
[52:29] didn't get more amen so automatically my
[52:34] uh enter missiles load and they just
[52:39] move into the air automatic that's the
[52:42] way they were wire amen because I
[52:44] believe this message came to educate
[52:48] us the message came to correct our ways
[52:52] amen meaning we were doing certain
[52:54] things ignorantly but when the message
[52:57] come and the truth come and the truth is
[53:00] presented then from that time we are
[53:03] Duty bound to conform to the truth and
[53:07] begin to walk according to the truth
[53:09] once the truth is disclosed if you don't
[53:12] walk according to the truth now you
[53:14] walking in iniquity and you become a
[53:17] worker of iniquity I don't know if we
[53:20] clear together amen so I realize there
[53:23] are seven several things that has not
[53:25] been t
[53:27] in this message or he was taught but he
[53:30] was not properly taught amen and we got
[53:33] people 30 years 40 years 20 years in the
[53:36] message and some don't even know to
[53:39] differentiate from their left and the
[53:41] right amen so the time have come that my
[53:44] people will not be again in confusion we
[53:47] have to know what is the truth we need
[53:49] to know how we need to uh worship and
[53:53] adore Our God if not we won't be
[53:56] different than the
[53:57] denomination amen so what about the
[54:00] Sunday issue brother Steven me I don't
[54:04] have anything I only have the Bible and

[1:12:37] be somebody in the back who feel now I
[1:12:39] really understand what it is and God is
[1:12:41] lingering waiting on one another so we
[1:12:44] all come to the revelation of who we are
[1:12:47] amen verse six he says I have
[1:12:51] said ye are gods and all of you are
[1:12:55] children of who the most high you see

[1:13:25] then you begin to
[1:13:27] hesitate amen so you have more faith on
[1:13:30] the natural man than the spiritual
[1:13:33] father so God is telling you you are my
[1:13:36] child what does it mean to be a child of
[1:13:38] God and not only a child of God by the
[1:13:41] child of the most

[1:13:46] everything you came out from his l in
[1:13:50] other word you were to be a child of God
[1:13:52] you must be in God so if God is saying
[1:13:55] you are my child it means you came out
[1:13:57] of God and Jesus say I come out from God
[1:14:01] and I'm going back to God in other word
[1:14:04] if you came out from God it means one of
[1:14:06] this day you're going to go back where
[1:14:08] you came
[1:14:09] from that's why your life is different
[1:14:13] that's why your life seems to be

[1:15:59] same that's why you say something it

[1:16:50] he can fall like one of the princes and
[1:16:53] they destroy the Prince of Life they him
[1:16:55] amen but this one is
[1:16:58] Forever This one is God but he's also

[1:17:49] were handling the man they even slap him
[1:17:52] they say prophesy they didn't get
[1:17:55] nothing but there was a woman with an
[1:17:57] issue of blood when she was
[1:18:00] coming she didn't touch the man she
[1:18:04] touched the
[1:18:05] [Applause]

[1:18:11] when she touched the other Jesus the
[1:18:13] other Jesus responded and made this
[1:18:17] Jesus weak and this Jesus say I become
[1:18:21] weak virtue have come out of me he
[1:18:26] want I hope we together I hope we are
[1:18:32] together both of them are
[1:18:37] Jesus my friend I don't have any choice
[1:18:40] I'm going to Shack this very hard
[1:18:42] brother Bram say the person Jesus was
[1:18:45] doing what was talking and God was doing
[1:18:47] what talking in him sometime he was who
[1:18:50] Christ himself sometime he was the
[1:18:53] father that dwelleth where in him they
[1:18:56] could not understand some things he
[1:18:58] would say he talks what in riddles to
[1:19:01] them Jesus finally said when he was
[1:19:04] talking to them one day he said I come
[1:19:07] from what God I come into this word and
[1:19:10] go back again to what how can somebody
[1:19:13] who was born in a
[1:19:15] hospital somebody who was born in a man
[1:19:18] the people were there and that person is
[1:19:21] telling you I'm coming from God
[1:19:29] h brother Bram say Christ seems to be a
[1:19:33] what a dual
[1:19:38] personality Christ seems to be a what
[1:19:41] dual personality there is a Divine
[1:19:45] personality and there is a human
[1:19:48] personality amen remember last Sunday
[1:19:50] that's why he could
[1:19:52] cry and then he turned around he said
[1:19:54] take of the stone the same person you
[1:19:57] need to know who is talking you need to
[1:19:59] know who is crying there is a time you
[1:20:02] cry and there is a time you don't cry

[1:27:47] understand him they say you speak how in
[1:27:50] riddles it was some who Jesus speaking
[1:27:54] sometime who the father is speaking that
[1:27:56] is the way it is with you it is yes
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] sir you see when I say Jesus you happy
[1:28:06] when I say it happened to you you see
[1:28:07] how you hesitated that's why we hear
[1:28:10] three
[1:28:11] month that's why we still hear three
[1:28:13] month until when they say this things
[1:28:16] you say
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:20] yes are we together he says that is the
[1:28:24] way what it is with you if you are what
[1:28:27] filled with the Holy Spirit any man that
[1:28:30] is filled with the Holy Spirit say
[1:28:33] things that he what hardly
[1:28:35] knows sometime what he's what is he
[1:28:38] saying if he's what truly carried away
[1:28:41] to the spirit exactly
[1:28:44] right have you noticed that sister when
[1:28:47] she say something he
[1:28:49] happened why does he
[1:28:52] happen because you always thought she's
[1:28:54] your
[1:28:57] sister amen but when she say something
[1:29:00] it happen when she tell you something it
[1:29:02] happened but you don't you you you you
[1:29:05] are not able to decode yet why is he
[1:29:07] happening until you will understand that
[1:29:10] that sister is more than a human in that
[1:29:13] sister there is a
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:18] God don't worry my friend William Marion
[1:29:21] Bram brother Bram say and they answer
[1:29:24] him and say for not these good works but
[1:29:28] because that did what blashe it being a
[1:29:31] man you make yourself God now
[1:29:38] watch they say you
[1:29:40] blashe why are you blaspheming because
[1:29:43] you a man and you making yourself God so
[1:29:47] if I say we are God to the people we are
[1:29:51] blaspheming brother Bram say watch
[1:29:54] because that's the problem they had with
[1:29:56] Jesus amen they were reading the Bible
[1:30:00] and the Bible say Emmanuel will be
[1:30:02] coming God will be coming when God come
[1:30:05] they say
[1:30:06] m you a man making yourself God so where
[1:30:10] were they
[1:30:12] believing we believe in this message we
[1:30:14] need to go back to Eden we need to go
[1:30:16] back to Eden now let's go back to Eden
[1:30:19] it's a problem you don't want to go back
[1:30:21] to heeden so I wonder who really
[1:30:25] came from
[1:30:26] [Applause]
[1:30:28] God because the surprise in this message
[1:30:32] we don't know who's going to leave
[1:30:33] tomorrow so you might be leaning to
[1:30:36] somebody who's going to leave the
[1:30:37] message that's why I don't care who's
[1:30:40] beside
[1:30:41] me me I want the word I want
[1:30:45] yes because this message is not for
[1:30:48] everybody this material is not for
[1:30:52] anyone only God will swallow
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:31:01] this saying now watch watch
[1:31:05] what the principle is God where in the
[1:31:10] people that's the matter the third
[1:31:13] person of the Trinity God in the people
[1:31:16] not in Christ not in Christ he already
[1:31:20] did that now with God in the people
[1:31:26] God in Charles
[1:31:28] Hamilton God in K Hamilton God in
[1:31:35] Elijah God in
[1:31:39] Sarah that's the principle that's where
[1:31:42] we
[1:31:46] are the principle is what God in the
[1:31:49] people how could God being what
[1:31:52] supernatural being this man they have
[1:31:55] never heard of that
[1:31:57] before but Jesus was what opening a gate
[1:32:02] a door to who the race of Adam him being
[1:32:05] what the Son of God in other words Jesus
[1:32:08] opened the gate so that every Son of God
[1:32:12] can follow
[1:32:13] him if he was God in human flesh you
[1:32:17] must be God in human flesh
[1:32:27] how can you believe that the work that
[1:32:29] he done you can do more than him because
[1:32:32] you don't even believe the
[1:32:34] basics how are you going to believe you
[1:32:36] can do more than him your human brain
[1:32:38] will tell you no he's God you are lower
[1:32:40] than God how can you do more than God
[1:32:42] but that's what God says so you want me
[1:32:45] to reason or to take him at his word if
[1:32:49] God want me to do more than him who am I
[1:32:53] [Applause]
[1:32:57] yeah listen Jesus 2434 verse Jesus
[1:33:03] answered them is it not written in your
[1:33:05] law now here himself being a Son of God
[1:33:09] yet I said see the personal pronoun I
[1:33:13] said ye are what God ye yourself are
[1:33:16] what God it is written where in your law
[1:33:19] so they they read it but they don't
[1:33:21] understand it that I said ye what God
[1:33:24] back to what God again we are going back
[1:33:27] to what they could not understand one
[1:33:31] time he was God speaking next time he
[1:33:35] was who Jesus speaking he was a dual
[1:33:39] personality as to what this is what
[1:33:42] happened to you that's why you
[1:33:45] confused that's why you don't know what
[1:33:47] when to speak and when not to speak
[1:33:50] sometime when you didn't even think you
[1:33:52] speak that's when even happen

[1:47:54] of knowing who his father was is what
[1:47:57] kept his chest up so the chest
[1:48:01] up had a meaning the chest up had a
[1:48:07] mystery a chest stop means someone who

[1:48:37] conduct as a child based on their
[1:48:40] position and he give them power to
[1:48:43] overcome everything and to keep the

[1:48:49] block to their cell
[1:48:51] [Music]

[1:57:18] that ah number one it was appli upon the
[1:57:23] ve number two he was applied upon the
[1:57:26] horns sir thank you my brother
[1:57:29] appreciate it thank you it was applied
[1:57:31] upon the Horn of the
[1:57:34] altar which is the golden altar or the
[1:57:38] altar of ense and number three he was
[1:57:41] put at the
[1:57:43] bottom of the Brazen
[1:57:45] altar amen the blood was the blood of a
[1:57:49] young
[1:57:50] bulock you remember that which is a
[1:57:54] calf the FED calf amen and it was for a
[1:57:58] sin
[1:57:59] offering you remember that and the off
[1:58:03] the sin was the sin of
[1:58:05] ignorance we clear on that one now
[1:58:09] follow me carefully because now we're
[1:58:10] going to get
[1:58:12] deeper you there according to John I'm
[1:58:17] going to go through this quickly
[1:58:19] according to John 9 verse3 1
[1:58:23] amen and according to
[1:58:26] Psalm
[1:58:28] 66:8 and according to proverb 15: 29 we
[1:58:34] find out that sin blocks
[1:58:39] prayer we clear on that one we clear we
[1:58:43] clear because in John the bible say that
[1:58:47] God does he Hearth not sinners in PS if
[1:58:51] I iniquity in my heart the Lord will not
[1:58:54] hear me the Lord is far from the wicked
[1:58:56] we clear on that one I'm trying to move
[1:58:59] on according to Isaiah
[1:59:02] 1 are we together Isaiah 1 verse 15 and
[1:59:08] Isaiah 59 verse1 the same thing goes
[1:59:12] together God doesn't hear the prayer of
[1:59:16] a sinner in other words sin blocks
[1:59:19] prayer the Bible says I will hide eyes
[1:59:22] from you yeah when you make many prayer
[1:59:25] I will not what why because your hands
[1:59:28] are full of but according to 59 behold
[1:59:31] the Lord's hand is not shortened that it
[1:59:34] cannot save neither is his ear uh his
[1:59:37] ear heavy that it cannot hear but your
[1:59:40] iniquity have separated between you and
[1:59:43] your God in other words God is always
[1:59:47] available always God is available the
[1:59:50] help of God is always is available to
[1:59:53] you but the reason why the help is not
[1:59:56] dispatched is because there is something
[1:59:59] that is blocking the help are we clear
[2:00:02] together we clear then when we enter
[2:00:05] into the altar of Ence we find that this
[2:00:09] altar have many things he have the shim
[2:00:12] wood you know what it means we clear he
[2:00:15] it's for square the four corners of the
[2:00:17] earth you understand that four horns
[2:00:20] which means power he was overlay with
[2:00:22] pure gold which was human overlay with d
[2:00:26] and a crown and the last things that was
[2:00:28] remaining was the incense everybody
[2:00:32] okay the last thing is the incense this
[2:00:35] is where we stopped last Sunday now
[2:00:38] follow me carefully you can back up now
[2:00:40] we clear according to Exodus 30 we found
[2:00:44] out that the altar was put before
[2:00:48] theil follow me my friend according to
[2:00:52] Exodus 30 the altar was before
[2:00:57] the amen and According to Hebrew n you
[2:01:02] remember that Paul put the when we say
[2:01:05] before the the altar was in the Holy
[2:01:09] place you understand this now and then
[2:01:14] according to Paul Paul put the altar in
[2:01:17] the
[2:01:19] holiest you understand this now because
[2:01:22] remember Paul was after the death of
[2:01:24] Jesus Christ the veil of the temple was
[2:01:26] split and the ense was burn in the
[2:01:32] morning we clear and at
[2:01:36] evening are we together yes and then the
[2:01:40] the the the altar itself was atoned at
[2:01:44] the horn and he was Aton yearly once
[2:01:48] every year we clear on that one we clear
[2:01:53] now when we look at Luke chapter
[2:01:57] one follow me my
[2:01:59] friend the Bible says that according to
[2:02:04] the custom of the priest office this is
[2:02:06] Zechariah his lot was to burn what when
[2:02:10] he went up into the Temple of the Lord
[2:02:14] and the whole multitude of the people
[2:02:16] were praying
[2:02:17] where now Zechariah was is
[2:02:22] follow me my friend and the people were
[2:02:26] outside one was within one was without
[2:02:32] amen inside the temple there were
[2:02:35] burning

[2:03:29] meet everybody together but they were
[2:03:34] going at the same
[2:03:36] time are we together one inside one

[2:03:44] same time the timing is the same yes

[2:15:53] me do you follow me there were prayer of
[2:15:57] the scent which were incense and the
[2:15:59] angel brought another
[2:16:02] incense are we together and that incense
[2:16:05] have to be
[2:16:07] mixed with the prayer of the S so now
[2:16:11] when they're
[2:16:13] burning are we together what comes out
[2:16:16] from there is incense mixed with prayer
[2:16:20] now the prayer of David
[2:16:23] [Applause]
[2:16:27] isere what are you trying to say it's a
[2:16:29] different gear my friend in the Old
[2:16:32] Testament the true atonement was not
[2:16:35] there that's right he was a substitute
[2:16:38] God was using lamps right he was using
[2:16:41] goats and everything are we together so
[2:16:45] the prayer and the incent were
[2:16:47] separate but when Jesus Christ came
[2:16:52] when John was baptized in Jesus Christ
[2:16:55] he says behold what L the Lamb of God in
[2:16:58] the word all lamb were represented in
[2:17:01] Jesus Christ now that Jesus is the
[2:17:04] perfect sacrifice now the incense is no
[2:17:08] longer
[2:17:09] separate because the veil of the temple
[2:17:12] has been ripped now the incense and the
[2:17:15] prayer are matching
[2:17:17] together do you follow me because the
[2:17:21] sacrifice have come the Old Testament
[2:17:24] could not do that only the blood of
[2:17:27] Jesus Christ which is our
[2:17:33] Bullock if I let you raise your hand my
[2:17:37] friend follow me my friend the Bible
[2:17:40] says they was giving him
[2:17:43] what that he should offer it with what
[2:17:46] the prayers of all the saints upon what
[2:17:49] the golden altar with which is where
[2:17:52] Before the Throne which is where Before
[2:17:54] the Throne the altar is now where Before
[2:17:57] the Throne Moses put the altar after the
[2:18:01] throne but when we go originally in
[2:18:04] heaven the altar was before the throne
[2:18:07] but because of the Old Testament the
[2:18:10] lamb was not there Moses had to
[2:18:12] separate are we together but when the
[2:18:15] lamb was dying on Calvary the veil was
[2:18:19] divided now PA we store everything back
[2:18:23] like in
[2:18:24] heaven because in heaven the Earth
[2:18:27] always been Before the Throne it is no
[2:18:30] longer the law the Tabernacle of Moses
[2:18:33] now we turn the Grace Grace The Altar
[2:18:37] and the throne are in the same
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:42] place are we together amen let me start
[2:18:46] it
[2:18:47] again in the Old Testament he was under
[2:18:50] the law the sacrifice was not perfect
[2:18:54] are we together boses was T what you see
[2:18:58] in heaven do it on Earth do you follow
[2:19:01] me amen but In Heaven There is no
[2:19:05] Veil The Tabernacle in heaven don't have
[2:19:08] Veil are we together but when Moses
[2:19:11] begin to put the Tabernacle Moses begin
[2:19:14] to put Veil and he took the Altar and
[2:19:17] put it outside but in heaven that altar
[2:19:20] is before for the throne so when Christ
[2:19:23] died Christ came and ripped the
[2:19:26] veil and opened The Mercy Seat in other
[2:19:29] words the holy place and the holiest
[2:19:31] became
[2:19:35] one are we together are we together now
[2:19:39] the altar is Before the Throne in other
[2:19:42] words Paul is restoring back Heaven
[2:19:45] because Paul was Moses in the more time
[2:19:49] that's why Paul was the one interpreting
[2:19:51] the law he was the Moses of the New
[2:19:55] Testament that's why he preached the
[2:19:57] book of Hebrew and going through the law
[2:20:00] the law of Moses it's Paul that
[2:20:03] understood that and Paul knew that now
[2:20:06] that the lamb has come we cannot put the
[2:20:09] veil anymore the altar must be Before

[2:31:03] Bram say he was blocking prayer that's
[2:31:06] are we together amen are we together
[2:31:08] Amen brother Bram said the prayer could
[2:31:11] not come up because the atonement what
[2:31:14] wasn't made my question is so how was
[2:31:16] the Old Testament prayer being answered
[2:31:23] God was answering their Prayer by type
[2:31:28] that's right because they didn't have
[2:31:30] any better than that so God have to
[2:31:33] answer that prayer yes sir amen amen if
[2:31:37] the prayer of the Old Testament was
[2:31:40] answered by the blood of Boo and
[2:31:47] goat and sheep hmer day blood of Jesus
[2:31:53] Christ will do to your
[2:31:55] [Applause]

[2:32:05] prayer my friend if it takes seven
[2:32:08] sermon I will go slowly amen until you
[2:32:10] get this because I don't want to preach
[2:32:13] this and you go tomorrow you still
[2:32:14] struggling Amen brother Bram say but he
[2:32:19] broke through
[2:32:21] follow and he did what open up the way
[2:32:24] so when God when Jesus was going
[2:32:29] up this is what brother Bram is saying
[2:32:32] this is what brother Bram is saying
[2:32:35] amen amen do you know that when Jesus
[2:32:38] resurrected he went to heaven and he
[2:32:41] came back again because he thought Mary
[2:32:43] he said do not touch me I have to go
[2:32:46] before the father then at the evening
[2:32:49] when he came he said say now you can
[2:32:50] touch me brother Bram said because he
[2:32:52] went there and as he was going brother
[2:32:55] Bram said because the sacrifice must be
[2:32:58] accepted that's right because Paul say
[2:33:03] he doesn't enter the Tabernacle made by
[2:33:06] men According to Hebrew he must enter in
[2:33:09] the Tabernacle of Heaven Amen to go put
[2:33:12] the blood not in this altar go in heaven
[2:33:16] where the true alter is and put the
[2:33:22] amen
[2:33:26] amen do you know the Bible says
[2:33:29] that if you don't know raise your
[2:33:32] hand open the the book of
[2:33:35] Hebrew if I have to stop here I don't
[2:33:38] have any problem let's go to Hebrew
[2:33:43] now let's go to Hebrew now yes
[2:33:47] sir glory Lord amen
[2:33:52] than we cannot serve God in
[2:33:56] ignorance Hebrew 9 if you thereare you
[2:33:59] can say amen amen let's go to verse 11
[2:34:01] then I'm going to stop because I have
[2:34:04] one minute
[2:34:05] left let's go Hebrew n
[2:34:08] than we need to understand these
[2:34:12] things right you think the priest was
[2:34:14] just playing in the Tabernacle there
[2:34:16] were
[2:34:18] Mysteries God God doesn't hear sinners
[2:34:21] we all say Amen what about if I'm no
[2:34:25] longer a
[2:34:26] sinner
[2:34:28] Lord guess what guess
[2:34:31] what God doesn't heal sin what about if
[2:34:35] I'm no longer a sinner in other word sin
[2:34:40] blocks prayer if you resolve
[2:34:44] sin prayer also is
[2:34:48] resolved that's why the blood is put on
[2:34:50] the there and on the altar of the ense
[2:34:54] that's where prayer is coming up they
[2:34:56] have to unlock I'm not getting in the
[2:34:58] bottom of the altar yet we will get to
[2:35:00] that and you will see why that altar
[2:35:02] have to be also applied and not on the
[2:35:05] altar under there is a reason why he
[2:35:07] goes under there

[2:35:32] things to come by a what greater and
[2:35:35] what more perfect perfect what
[2:35:38] Tabernacle not this Tabernacle of Moses
[2:35:41] the original Tabernacle that Moses copy
[2:35:44] after a more perfect Tabernacle not made
[2:35:48] with water
[2:35:51] hands that is to say not of what this
[2:35:54] building nether by the blood of what
[2:35:57] goats and whats and what but by his own
[2:36:02] blood he enter in how many times into
[2:36:05] what the holy
[2:36:07] Place having what obtained Eternal
[2:36:11] Redemption ET Eternal Redemption for who
[2:36:14] drop to verse 19 now get it my friend
[2:36:17] flat attend and prepare for landing
[2:36:20] for when Moses had spoken every precept
[2:36:23] to all the people according to the law
[2:36:25] he took the blood of calves young bulock
[2:36:30] amen and of goats with water and Scarlet
[2:36:34] wood and H up and sprinkle both the book
[2:36:38] and all the people saying this is the
[2:36:41] blood of the testament which God has
[2:36:43] what enjoy unto to you moreover he
[2:36:47] sprinkle with blood both what the
[2:36:49] Tabernacle and all the vessel of what
[2:36:52] ministers so the Tabernacle and the
[2:36:54] vessel were sprinkled with blood that
[2:36:57] was done on Earth by Moses watch verse
[2:37:00] 22 and almost all things are by the law
[2:37:05] Purge with what blood so he was a
[2:37:08] purging and without what shed shedding
[2:37:12] of the
[2:37:13] blood is no
[2:37:15] what it was therefore necessary that the
[2:37:19] power
[2:37:20] of things in what heaven no more on
[2:37:23] Earth should be how
[2:37:26] purified purify with what these my
[2:37:29] question is why do you purify things in
[2:37:33] heaven where God is question on Earth
[2:37:36] it's human being but in heaven God dwell
[2:37:39] there why does Jesus need to purify
[2:37:42] things in
[2:37:44] heaven do you see now do you see now my
[2:37:48] friend he said
[2:37:50] and was therefore necessary that the
[2:37:52] pattern of things in the heaven should
[2:37:54] be purified with this but the Heavenly
[2:37:57] things themselves with better what
[2:37:59] sacrifice than the than what than these
[2:38:02] in other words the things in heaven had
[2:38:05] to be purified by a better excellent
[2:38:09] sacrifice and there is no excellent
[2:38:12] Sacrifice by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:38:14] and why was Heaven why must we purify
[2:38:18] Heaven because look
[2:38:20] started sin over
[2:38:22] [Applause]
[2:38:25] there do you understand amen sin brother
[2:38:28] Bram say sin
[2:38:30] originated so God must go everywhere
[2:38:34] that Lucifer was and clean up
[2:38:39] everything are we together amen are we
[2:38:42] together so the true alar of AES was
[2:38:46] also purified there why because Jesus
[2:38:50] have to open the way am and the gloomy
[2:38:53] atmosphere that was on the top Jesus
[2:38:56] have to remove it because your prayer
[2:38:58] was blocked blocked blocked so Christ
[2:39:02] must open the way so that when you pray
[2:39:06] your prayer are answer listen my friend
[2:39:11] but he broke through what that Veil he
[2:39:14] opened up what the way he broke the veil
[2:39:16] of what sickness he broke the veil of
[2:39:18] what sin he broke the veil of what weary
[2:39:21] he broke the veil of what depressed he
[2:39:23] broke every Veil and made a what highway
[2:39:27] for who the warfaring man walking up in
[2:39:30] the king's what highway oh my when he
[2:39:33] pass what the moon and the stars and
[2:39:35] what on and on God have to open a

[2:50:02] again about who we are and and about
[2:50:06] what the blood is Lord father May the
[2:50:09] Holy Spirit take these few words that
[2:50:12] has been spoken and may you drive it
[2:50:15] down deep in the soul and now fold this
[2:50:19] Revelation more than what we have done
[2:50:22] so that Lord father even though we
[2:50:23] didn't do it more what than what you
[2:50:25] have done yourself so that father they
[2:50:28] can see you clearly and understand the
[2:50:31] power of the blood upon our sin and upon
[2:50:36] the consequences that sin have brought
[2:50:38] in our
[2:50:40] life the main root was to deal with the
[2:50:43] sin whatever remaining was only branches
[2:50:48] and fruit Lord and if the root is
[2:50:50] already cut off automatically it's just
[2:50:53] a matter of time the Fig Tree will
[2:50:55] wither away father the blood has been
[2:50:59] applied upon us and that same blood
