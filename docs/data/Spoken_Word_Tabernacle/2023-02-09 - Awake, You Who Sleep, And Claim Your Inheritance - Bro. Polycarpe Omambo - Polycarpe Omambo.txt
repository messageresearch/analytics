understand the son of man revealed so when they say the Lord came down on Sunset Mountain it's clear now no more confusion blessed be the name of the Lord he is first the word and then the word is made flesh and in this hour he's the word on Sunset Mountain but he's going to be flesh when he's coming from the East amen and we will meet a literal Corporal natural fleshly husband Jesus Christ in the air but he wanted to have faith before he comes according to Luke chapter 18 shall I find faith today we will say this scripture has been fulfilled why because Malachi 4 came and now we have the faith that have been restored back again to the church and we are ready for the coming of the Lord amen sister said the God richly bless you I amen it's like we are already experiencing the power of transformation because Divine Healing is actually the earnest of the Resurrection amen glory to God praise be to the name of the Lord what a tremendous blessing to be able to see you tonight amen it means a lot we're coming from way off but praise be to the name of the Lord she is here tonight and everything is good amen remember the meeting it's on Saturday or at three o'clock I push it to three because he loaded my weekend if you home with me like my wife you will understand when I say you Lord in my weekend so there is a whole lot to do I will try my best to pull the court together but I will do a little bit more of the speaking because if I go back with the code it will turn to a sermon and we probably won't uh deliver what we want to deliver so if on Saturday I say something that you need the code always you know feel free to reach out and you let me know and I will put it up either on the group chat so everybody have access to it or just send it to you according to the leadership of the holy spirit so keep me in prayer so we can talk as a family and things getting in line and then for the better of the church amen it's always easy to talk in a family that's the good thing if I was in politics then it's a hard platform to talk because I need to watch what I'm doing and this and this no but when you're in a church that is like a family we talk freely we understand one another even if I make mistake I know somebody will understand he really didn't mean that amen and then you tell me I say oh I'm sorry I didn't really mean that that's the way we work in the family and the family continue to grow and then we move forward amen I am not preaching tonight brother polycarp is preaching I will be translating him in English so I'm his voice in English amen so God richly bless you we're going to call by the polycarp with I can't help it only believe oh believe me [Music] all things are possible [Music] oh maybe this [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord I believe Lord [Music] I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible [Music] do you believe in tonight [Music] it's not possible to him that believe without faith it's impossible to please God [Music] [Applause] only believe Hallelujah [Music] musician we thank all the musicians tonight because they are the one bringing the anointing first in the church it's an office on itself in the Church of the Living God if you go on the scripture in the Bible God David that sin when David was dancing he was under the anointing and when he was singing demon always left Saul he didn't pray for Saul hello so when we come into the house of the Lord it is very important to respect every step of the service the preacher can come up here to preach and maybe you're not gonna be healed through the preaching of them but maybe when the singer are already singing before the service there could be a word coming out from the singer and then when you believe it secretary you can receive your blessing before the service that's why he was [Music] closing of the history of this world and it's always a good thing to be found in the house so as you are standing let's go to the Book of Genesis chapter 29. [Music] Genesis chapter 29 verse 25. if you dare you can say Amen okay we are reading in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I Alaba foreign behold he was Leah and he said to Lemon what is this that has done unto me did not serve uh did not did not I serve with thee for Rachel wherefore has stopped begani [Music] it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn let's pray eternally Heavenly Father Knows we are approaching you just as We Are Tonight We would like for you to move us completely and that you can come and speak to your children we want to be found just as instrument in your hand we are giving you our mouth no long our tongue our heart do not being unto the house and come and help us in this time and the word stated that it was moved by the holy spirit that holy man spoke from God we want to speak from foreign [Music] foreign [Music] is awake you who sleep and claim your inheritance in the Book of Genesis 29 25 the Bible says that in the morning Jacob spoke to Lebanon first of all he start questions what have that done unto me [Music] when he woke up from his sleep he found that he was layer Leah instead of Rachel while he worked for Rachel [Music] you might ask me a question how come Leah was already there and he could not even figure it out this is not Rachel less money is it okay with my microphone okay when Jacob saw the people he could not tell who was who and later on when he went to his bed there was a woman laying there he could not recognize in his mind he taught that it should be Rachel right there amen amen but when he woke up in the morning when he woke up no he realized that somebody changed my blessings is not what I work for because according to the tradition you cannot marry a sister a young woman without you doing or rendering a service unto the families without them making sure that the man that is marrying our daughter is able to take a job make sure that you are able to work with a work of seven years for rich is they never told him that in this country we always start with the firstborn because he went straight ahead and he said I want Rachel and now watch the consequences of Darkness [Music] the consequences of the night the consequences of being slipped he didn't know if you recall the Lord Jesus Christ one time chapter 8 from verse 22. 22 to 26 if we can go there amen Mark chapter 8 . it's speaking about the healing of a blonde man in bedside and he come after and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him amen amen [Music] and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had Spit on His Eyes he put his hand upon him and he asked him if he saw Alt is he says this is Jesus taking a blind man out of the city he first touched him the first time to heal this uh blind man we don't know America and after he administered the treatment he asked the uh blind manners what do you see verse 24 and he looked up and say I see men as three walking flu this happened when your sight is not clear enough something happened to his vision that he could not tell the difference between Leo they gave him something he didn't desires that's why when he woke up in the morning with a Clear Vision he said no I cannot take this I have to claim my inheritance I have to claim my blessing amen amen I've met she is after that he had put his hand again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and so every man clearly [Applause] was touched by Jesus himself the first time Jesus asked him do you see me yes yes it's a flu but even though he was touched by Jesus he could not see clearly Jesus says stop rather somebody will take advantage of you sentences that's why Jesus have to give him a second touch not hesitated to go back to the master amen amen Jacob had to claim he has so many questions he say and work according to the tradition of the place you told me to work for my in-laws before I take uh my wife to marriage but at night time they switch his Blessing amen amen he only recognized that only in the morning because at night his eyes were as blind as this blind man here he saw a woman make the difference whether it's but in the morning we he began to claim certain personality many people in their lives when they see something wrong going on in them they don't even care illness they just neglect the situation they just neglect the difference they don't even care about it they say oh well that's my name is [Music] he's still taking everything as being normal Jacob say not me I have to claims tonight you must take a decision where they block your healing we are inherited somewhere you must claim them you must take a decision to live Darkness to leave to leave the world you're not working for a loss of France Jacob said you know what I have now worked seven years to suffer like this I work so that I can be blessed amen amen [Applause] you must wake up let's go to first king chapter three first king chapter 3 verse 16 to 21. we are talking about awake and you can see the consequences of falling asleep there are consequences that follow amen amen first king chapter 3 first king chapter three verse 16. versus says okay beginning verse 16. Allah then came there two women and that were harlots unto the king and stood before him and the one woman say oh my Lord I and this woman dwell in one house and I was delivered of a child with her in the house [Music] and he came to pass the third day after that I was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there were no strength there was no stranger with us in the house save we too in the house amen amen and This Woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it foreign [Music] [Music] behold he was dead but when I consider it in the morning behold it was not my son which I did best she had her blessing but she could not stay awake to watch over her blessing amen amen amen amen the story that we just read said that the family prostituated it's two women that were harlots living in the same in the same place amen amen the first deliver her child midnight in family and a normal woman fell deep into sleep I tell us until she reached she went to a point of killing her own son she destroyed her own Blessing by the way she is but because of sleepiness she killed her own blessing and the other woman was sleeping while she was sleeping the one who killed her own Sons based because of sleeping she went and swapped the children Satan will change your intelligence the devil will even change your womb you find yourself with a troubles and then he begin to tell you you know what you got something here and because of this state you cannot conceived but if you go to that state your blessing will go we'll pass but if you wake up you say and you begin to claim your blessing amen amen and what happened to this woman that Destiny City door they can change your blessing if you're sleeping amen amenities they can sweep your health if you're sleeping Jesus says that a man who have opposition from his own house from his own family amen amen most of the time our trouble Administration they don't really come from maybe it comes from your own house [Music] maybe it's the person very next to you maybe it's the one that you use this is my body from high school this is my body at work you gotta wake up that could be the one okay the testimony of this woman that came in the house we were only two in the same house don't even know how to claim their own inheritance when Jesus Christ sent the disciples go and deliver the captives I give you the power party the disciple went so party when they went there they never realized that the power was already backing them second is it down to the ferry whatever they were doing the devil they noticed that Satan is not always that when Jesus spoke to them they were already empowered [Applause] to take control over all these things somebody going to work [Applause] before you even came I already seen Satan coming down from heaven like lightning [Music] those kind of things amen amen and this woman was sleeping what is sleeping maybe you went throughout the way uh throughout the day you worked so hard and then it's night time you need rest because you already spent so much energy throughout the day that's how we fell asleep you see but the sleepness we are talking about tonight even though in the scripture is to us it's something that is spiritual amen amen spiritual a spiritual sleepness where children of God are not taking things into consideration the secularism of what happened to them in their lives amen amen you see something not working well in your life he just say well that's normal you saw a bad dream oh you saw a vision of something wrong but everybody who was in the scripture even John Elizabeth the whole book of Revelation how did he came and happened to be in the island apartment but he was there and he was caught up into Village secretary but what happened in your life all you say is just a dream oh it was just a vision instead of waking up and saying and then you can claim your position and claim your inheritance you always take things and you say it was just a dream but everybody in the description God spoke to people in dreams because the scripture says speak one way or another but we don't take it God can't speak to you through the sermon that's that God is telling you [Applause] you must claim the correct condition amen amen that's what we're talking about tonight and claim your inheritance sleepiness have a lot of consequences in the book of Samuel away blessed be the name of the Lord we will see something there David David amen we see David here preposition it's first Samuel chapter 26.

unto them ready to depart on the moral and continue his speech until midnight amen amen he says Paul this is Paul Elizabeth they were in church just like we're in church now and they were there for the Lord's supper and at that time the time of the service Paul is Paul understood something okay that the true bread is the word of God it's the teaching it's the word of God it's the preaching so he
