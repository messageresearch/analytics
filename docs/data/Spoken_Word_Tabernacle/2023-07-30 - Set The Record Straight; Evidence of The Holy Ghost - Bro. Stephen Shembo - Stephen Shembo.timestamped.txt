[28:18] gone off no amount of words of
[28:20] forgetting to pay or having the money
[28:22] will mean anything because the police
[28:24] would have been called it would have

[58:53] reading your church ages you're reading
[58:56] your 70 weeks of Daniel you're reading
[58:58] the seals and you're listening to the
[59:00] message of the hour amen I will remind
[59:03] you always and make sure your head is on
[59:06] the word amen
[59:07] we have a wonderful young men's meeting
[59:10] yesterday wonderful what you heard them
[59:13] [Laughter]
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:17] a wonderful we have young men meeting
[59:20] but yesterday it was super
[59:24] can you say Amen
[59:26] super in everything
[59:29] sister Laurel sister Joanne God richly
[59:32] bless you for the sacrifice we never
[59:35] seen something like that that was the
[59:37] first biggest sandwich we ever seen in
[59:39] our life if you have no clue what I'm
[59:42] talking about you need to see one of
[59:44] them it was how many this long
[59:48] how many free
[59:50] five foot
[59:54] so it's only for men
[59:59] so that was a man sandwiches
[1:00:02] I couldn't keep it to myself
[1:00:05] amen you might be seated a little bit so
[1:00:09] I took the I took a shot
[1:00:11] and put it on the young
[1:00:14] in the youth group of spoken words
[1:00:17] Tabernacle and had some pretty
[1:00:19] interesting discussion going on there
[1:00:22] amen wonderful but I could not help it
[1:00:25] that was wonderful everything went fine
[1:00:28] by the grace of God and it generated a
[1:00:31] lot of questions so I told them the same
[1:00:33] thing I told to the younger sister put
[1:00:35] your question together so the next
[1:00:37] meeting instead of moving forward we
[1:00:39] need to go back again and get the
[1:00:41] question and then answer and make sure
[1:00:43] everybody's there amen
[1:00:46] I'm sorry I didn't tell them this but I
[1:00:49] had to download a portion of the married
[1:00:52] couple
[1:00:53] material there because I was dealing
[1:00:56] with patriarch
[1:00:58] so they need to know certain things
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:03] amen they were not aware of it I
[1:01:06] switched the USB I have to put another
[1:01:09] USB and download it just a portion
[1:01:11] enough amen the remaining when you get
[1:01:14] married I will handle it amen because
[1:01:17] they need to know how to deal with their
[1:01:19] mother
[1:01:20] everybody
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:27] you need to know how to deal with your
[1:01:29] sisters
[1:01:31] because a woman is an entire mystery
[1:01:36] let me leave it alone okay let me leave
[1:01:40] it alone okay amen it's an entire
[1:01:43] Ministry amen this whole message is
[1:01:46] about a brother
[1:01:49] the entire message that we have the
[1:01:52] entire word of God is about God coming
[1:01:55] to take his blood back
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] glory to God Amen
[1:02:05] so as patriarch I had to give them a
[1:02:08] little glance of the world of women
[1:02:12] so they know how to deal with Mama
[1:02:14] they know how to deal with sister and
[1:02:17] they're going to be better husband to
[1:02:19] the wives amen he was just a portion
[1:02:21] that I downloaded and I have to take the
[1:02:24] USB quickly out amen the remaining
[1:02:28] you'll get it when you get married but
[1:02:30] I'm proud of them it was so relaxing
[1:02:32] brother Kelly thank you for your place
[1:02:34] everything went fine by God's grace how
[1:02:36] many hours was that brother brother Abel
[1:02:39] brother Kelly how many hours
[1:02:41] four and a half hours
[1:02:43] so somebody really got downloaded amen I
[1:02:48] look at brother Benjamin and say is this
[1:02:50] heavy he said a brother Stephen That's
[1:02:52] Heavy
[1:02:55] amen so somebody got really really good
[1:02:59] Mateo and they stretched pretty good
[1:03:01] because I don't want you to Google
[1:03:03] anything
[1:03:05] I don't want you to buy anything on
[1:03:07] Amazon I am here as a father
[1:03:10] as a spiritual father and a pastor is a
[1:03:14] full package
[1:03:16] so there is no area that we cannot cover
[1:03:19] we need to befriend
[1:03:21] and we need to be brother
[1:03:23] that's what was lacking in this message
[1:03:26] amen no judgment nothing open up and
[1:03:30] let's talk and move forward amen glory
[1:03:33] to God you should be there my friend
[1:03:36] amen four hours they got the one so I
[1:03:40] have to wait for the next Generation
[1:03:41] when they grow up a little bit when they
[1:03:44] start reaching 1617 then I downloaded
[1:03:47] again so do your best never to miss this
[1:03:50] kind of thing because I can't sit now
[1:03:51] four hours and start everything back up
[1:03:54] again amen so you got it you can deliver
[1:03:57] that and move forward then everything is
[1:03:59] good amen I am not afraid one bit
[1:04:03] because everything I deliver it's backed
[1:04:07] up in the Bible and back up by the
[1:04:09] message of the hour so I'm ready to go
[1:04:12] so if somebody won a war welcome
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:17] so the best thing to do is just stay
[1:04:19] away so the next oncoming meeting for
[1:04:22] the Young's men meaning that's me I'll
[1:04:23] just speak playing so the next song
[1:04:25] coming meeting for the young men will be
[1:04:28] on September 9th amen how many heard
[1:04:31] that so September 9th we will be there
[1:04:35] at 2 30 again and then I'll get your
[1:04:38] question and move forward the reason why
[1:04:40] we have to push it in September 9th is
[1:04:42] on on August the 26th it's the young
[1:04:46] sister meeting follow-up on the meeting
[1:04:48] with their questions amen
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:53] I'm not saying war that I'm ready to
[1:04:58] fight but what do I do with a sword
[1:05:04] why did they hand me the solder
[1:05:07] I'm fighting demon and I'm fighting
[1:05:10] religious spirit it is not a flesh and
[1:05:13] blood fight it's a spiritual war
[1:05:16] you got it so before somebody come up
[1:05:19] and say he's ready to fight
[1:05:22] everybody okay the next question and
[1:05:25] answer meeting will be on August the
[1:05:28] 12th which is this coming month so
[1:05:30] August 12th question and answer and
[1:05:32] August 26 the young Sisters Meeting on
[1:05:35] the follow-up of their last meeting and
[1:05:37] September 9th will be the Young's men
[1:05:40] meeting amen if possible do the best to
[1:05:44] check the announcement the Deacon sent
[1:05:46] an announcement before and they send
[1:05:48] another amount uh announcement this
[1:05:51] morning it's about the traffic so make
[1:05:53] sure you read it instead of us saying
[1:05:56] that on YouTube so you know how to keep
[1:05:58] the traffic flowing and everything
[1:06:00] moving pretty good after service amen so
[1:06:03] it's your responsibility to read it and
[1:06:06] make sure you understand what it's
[1:06:07] saying if you don't read and you're not
[1:06:09] on the page so don't mind to see a
[1:06:12] deacon coming and helping you on the
[1:06:14] shoulder to remind you that you need to
[1:06:16] keep moving and make sure the traffic is
[1:06:18] Flowing pretty good amen
[1:06:20] amen okay we are in the Minister season
[1:06:25] so you will see Minister coming back up
[1:06:28] back and forth so be patient with us on
[1:06:32] prayer teach us how to pray we already
[1:06:34] went with part one part two part three
[1:06:36] so just I'm gonna slow down just a
[1:06:39] little bit to make sure the brother have
[1:06:42] a flow of easy traffic and then we will
[1:06:45] come back again and continue on our
[1:06:47] teaching on how to pray amen so if you
[1:06:50] got some emails you got some text
[1:06:52] messages things that you sent me and I
[1:06:55] have not responded yet I am super loaded
[1:06:58] amen there was someone who sent us a
[1:07:01] message from South Africa and know that
[1:07:04] you're listening we already responded to
[1:07:06] your message back but we don't see any
[1:07:08] response back again so check your email
[1:07:11] you should see the message coming up by
[1:07:13] God's grace amen
[1:07:15] I'm gonna approach a very
[1:07:18] difficult subject this morning I have to
[1:07:21] push a break and to open up a door that
[1:07:25] I have to deal with something and then I
[1:07:28] will come back again where we are and
[1:07:30] continue to move forward because if I
[1:07:32] move forward I don't want you to get
[1:07:34] ambushed because I know what is around
[1:07:37] me and what I'm fighting against amen
[1:07:40] it's very easy for you to be pulling sad
[1:07:43] or somebody to send you a quote or shoot
[1:07:45] or or inoculate something just in order
[1:07:49] to trouble you amen so I'm gonna open
[1:07:52] that door I try to use four coats and
[1:07:55] move forward but I can't because the
[1:07:57] spirit of the Lord keep opening things
[1:08:00] more and more so I have to listen to the
[1:08:02] leadership of the holy spirit it's a
[1:08:04] question that was handled in question
[1:08:06] and answer before but there are several
[1:08:10] people that were not there and then as a
[1:08:12] moving question begin to pop up again so
[1:08:16] make sure when we have question and
[1:08:18] answer I'm encouraging you as a pastor
[1:08:20] make sure you're there because when
[1:08:22] you're missing I'm moving up with a lot
[1:08:25] of questions and then when we are right
[1:08:27] in the middle of a fight you begin to
[1:08:29] ask me question again of things that
[1:08:31] have been already dealt with in the past
[1:08:34] it's like you are slowing us from moving
[1:08:37] forward so make sure you are there the
[1:08:40] last time we dealt with a question about
[1:08:42] Elijah you remember that about the
[1:08:45] spirit of Elijah says the man Elijah
[1:08:48] coming back up again and then when they
[1:08:50] ask him in question and answer he say it
[1:08:52] might be the anointing of Elijah upon
[1:08:54] man these are questions that have
[1:08:56] trouble people all around the message
[1:08:59] for years
[1:09:00] so when I'm dealing with them I'm
[1:09:02] putting them together and the day I'm
[1:09:05] going to preach the seals one of you
[1:09:07] will come up again with the same
[1:09:08] question and say brother Stephen look at
[1:09:10] this brother but I'm saying in other
[1:09:12] words you're making me work double So to
[1:09:15] avoid working double whenever we set up
[1:09:17] a time also give God the preeminence
[1:09:21] take whatever you have a little bit
[1:09:23] Assad let's come sit and talk and deal
[1:09:25] with subject and we move forward when
[1:09:27] you don't it's gonna be on your
[1:09:29] responsibility but this time I felt led
[1:09:32] by God that I have to handle this
[1:09:34] because somebody need to get free amen
[1:09:36] so I'm gonna ask you a favor
[1:09:41] let me download whatever I need to
[1:09:44] download
[1:09:45] until I finish it
[1:09:47] it's very easy for this to go from part
[1:09:49] one to part two
[1:09:50] but give me some Grace let me download
[1:09:53] what I have to download let me deliver
[1:09:56] what I have to deliver
[1:09:58] amen if you feel like you're trying to
[1:10:00] sleep or you tired just stand even
[1:10:02] beside the wall I'm fine but let me
[1:10:05] handle what I have to handle
[1:10:08] we promise
[1:10:10] everybody's okay with it
[1:10:12] everybody's comfortable with it Vada
[1:10:14] Kelly you heard them right
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:19] glory to God so make sure we stay in
[1:10:23] tune and uh everything will be okay by
[1:10:27] the grace of God Amen and once we finish
[1:10:30] this if there is time go back home again

[1:13:33] I will make known my words to you you

[1:13:39] according to what Solomon is saying here
[1:13:42] Solomon says that God is giving us a

[1:13:48] and his promise is that he will pour His
[1:13:52] Spirit upon us

[1:15:17] God promised to pour His Spirit upon us

[1:15:29] there should be a making known a
[1:15:33] revelation of the word unto you
[1:15:37] so please do the best that you can
[1:15:41] and make sure before you leave this
[1:15:44] church your computer have been
[1:15:46] downloaded properly
[1:15:49] I'm speaking common language today not
[1:15:53] that we are computer but you know what
[1:15:55] I'm saying
[1:15:56] Isaiah 44 verse 3 if you dare you can
[1:15:59] say Amen
[1:16:02] for I will do what my friend poor water
[1:16:05] I will pour water upon him that is how
[1:16:09] thirsty
[1:16:11] so if you're not thirsty do you expect
[1:16:13] water to come down
[1:16:18] so if you want what they're done what
[1:16:21] happened
[1:16:22] because tests have a mystery
[1:16:30] yeah
[1:16:31] test
[1:16:33] doesn't mean you don't have water
[1:16:39] when you're testing for water it doesn't
[1:16:42] mean you don't have water
[1:16:46] everybody okay
[1:16:47] if I take something that looks like a
[1:16:50] recipient
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] and it's calibrated somehow
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:58] and at the beginning this recipient was
[1:17:01] filled or this job whatever you want to
[1:17:03] call it was filled with water
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:07] as long as there is water here filled
[1:17:10] all the way to the top
[1:17:12] test will never appear
[1:17:17] everybody okay
[1:17:19] but if your water begin to go down
[1:17:23] as it goes down there is a threshold
[1:17:29] I'm preaching the message just now there
[1:17:32] is a threshold
[1:17:33] amen and this threshold is a limit your
[1:17:38] car have it
[1:17:40] when your gasoline are going down
[1:17:42] there is a certain level when your car
[1:17:45] will give you a signal your car doesn't
[1:17:48] do your car doesn't give you signal when
[1:17:52] there is no more gas
[1:17:55] can I can you say Amen your car gives
[1:17:59] you signal when your gasoline reach a
[1:18:02] certain level
[1:18:03] it doesn't mean the gasoline is
[1:18:05] completely out
[1:18:07] the gasoline is still there but the
[1:18:10] gasoline have Rich air treacherous level
[1:18:17] everybody okay then the red light comes
[1:18:20] on
[1:18:22] telling you that hey you need to get
[1:18:24] gasoline
[1:18:25] you still have gasoline
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:33] everybody good so when you reach this
[1:18:36] threshold here when this water Reach
[1:18:39] This threshold here amen it will trigger
[1:18:43] the mystery of tests
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:49] it will trigger the mystery of thirst
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:54] the mystery of thirst is what
[1:18:57] this word right here amen create what we
[1:19:02] call a deep
[1:19:06] everybody okay and there is now
[1:19:08] emptiness that is right here amen and
[1:19:13] this deep here will begin to come
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] to another deep
[1:19:22] and there should be another dip
[1:19:24] somewhere to respond to that deeper
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:30] so when you are testing for water it
[1:19:33] doesn't mean you don't have water
[1:19:35] when you are testing for water it means
[1:19:38] you got water but in a insufficient
[1:19:42] level
[1:19:44] that can cause you trouble
[1:19:50] let me pull this if you testing for the
[1:19:54] Holy Ghost foreign
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:11] let me start it again
[1:20:14] when the gasoline comes up it tells you
[1:20:17] there's still gasoline but they need
[1:20:19] more gasoline so when the engine tell
[1:20:22] you you need gasoline it means you
[1:20:24] already have gasoline
[1:20:27] but you need another gasoline to fill
[1:20:31] you
[1:20:33] you need a Feeling
[1:20:36] you need a feeling of the gasoline
[1:20:41] the feeling of the gasoline means
[1:20:44] they're already gasoline there what
[1:20:46] you're getting is a Feeling
[1:20:49] is a baptism of gasoline
[1:20:52] [Applause]
[1:20:58] everybody okay so when you testing for
[1:21:01] water inside of you there is water in
[1:21:03] your body because if you take all water
[1:21:06] out you drop down the water is there but
[1:21:09] you need more water to be added that is
[1:21:12] the mystery of thirst
[1:21:14] test means you already have it
[1:21:19] but your body is calling for the feeling
[1:21:25] when this measure come in you have been
[1:21:29] filled
[1:21:31] with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:38] when you're gonna review you will
[1:21:40] understand me
[1:21:42] let's go to verse three for our poor
[1:21:44] water upon him that is half thirsty so
[1:21:48] when you thirsty means what happened in
[1:21:50] you there is water
[1:21:53] that's why they're trying to bring water
[1:21:56] with the water and the water that is in
[1:21:58] you and the water that is outside of you
[1:22:01] they are the same
[1:22:08] when you put that water in you you
[1:22:10] cannot make a difference
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:18] Lord Jesus
[1:22:20] if you will get this quickly I will move
[1:22:22] quickly
[1:22:24] for our pour out

[1:22:47] what is in the seed
[1:22:52] so why are we pouring life on life

[1:23:06] ah yeah yeah the seed
[1:23:11] has life
[1:23:13] and the spirit
[1:23:15] is also life
[1:23:17] amen and God say I will pour my spirit
[1:23:21] upon what
[1:23:23] upon water

[1:23:50] you remember that right they're not
[1:23:53] pouring the spirit on you but on you
[1:24:00] amen because if they pour the spirit on
[1:24:03] you you can go as a Pentecostal
[1:24:06] but if they pour the spirit on you
[1:24:09] not this to you but they knew that is
[1:24:12] inside
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:16] that's where God targeted because it's
[1:24:20] the spirit because in the new there is
[1:24:22] also life

[1:25:15] been poorer then what followed

[1:25:44] Matthew 13 verse 15. you there
[1:25:48] for this people's heart
[1:25:51] is how wax grows and their ears are dull
[1:25:55] of water and the eyes
[1:25:58] they have water closed so there are
[1:26:02] three parts today
[1:26:04] we are dealing with the heart
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:10] then God is talking about the eyes
[1:26:14] and the ears
[1:26:17] amen one two three follow me carefully
[1:26:23] the Bible says the heart get trouble
[1:26:27] the ears trouble
[1:26:29] their eyes trouble
[1:26:33] so they got trouble in three area
[1:26:36] everybody okay
[1:26:39] let me put this in order
[1:26:42] because somebody would say they say ears
[1:26:44] first
[1:26:47] Years first then eyes
[1:26:49] just the way the scripture put it
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:53] for this people's heart is what's gross
[1:26:56] and their ears are dull of hearing it's
[1:26:59] a problem and the eyes they have done
[1:27:02] what clothes lest at any time they
[1:27:06] should do what
[1:27:08] with water their eyes
[1:27:10] their eyes they should see
[1:27:13] continue my friend and what here with
[1:27:16] their ears there is a hearing here
[1:27:19] and what and should understand with
[1:27:22] their hearts so they are so the
[1:27:24] understanding is in the heart
[1:27:26] how do you understand with the heart
[1:27:29] I thought we understand with the brain
[1:27:37] understand with the water
[1:27:40] what happened if you see with your eyes
[1:27:44] you hear with your ears and then you
[1:27:47] understand with your heart
[1:27:49] amen what happened if those three things
[1:27:53] are coupled together if one if three
[1:27:57] is activated two activated one activated
[1:28:02] what is the result
[1:28:05] we okay
[1:28:06] he says and here with the ears and
[1:28:10] should understand with their heart Karma
[1:28:12] and should be how
[1:28:15] so to get converted you need what
[1:28:26] to be converted
[1:28:29] in other words to be born again
[1:28:34] you need to have your ear your eyes open
[1:28:38] your ears open
[1:28:40] and your heart
[1:28:45] understand with their heart and should
[1:28:47] be how and I should do it so healing and
[1:28:52] conversion are a package
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:28:58] I mean
[1:29:07] it's also
[1:29:11] what happened to the healing of the body
[1:29:14] is also for the water
[1:29:19] I want you to prosper and to be in good
[1:29:23] as your soul
[1:29:28] we okay we good
[1:29:30] have I lost anyone
[1:29:32] good job to verse 16.
[1:29:35] but watch now Jesus gave the formula if
[1:29:40] you want to be converted
[1:29:41] you need three things
[1:29:43] amen you need your eyes need to see your
[1:29:47] ears need to heal
[1:29:49] and the main thing is
[1:29:51] your heart need to water
[1:29:54] remember
[1:29:56] Solomon say he will pour your spirit
[1:29:59] upon you and make you know
[1:30:02] his word
[1:30:04] we okay
[1:30:06] verse 16 but blessed are what your eyes
[1:30:11] stop how many part do we have here three
[1:30:15] the eyes I'm checking this up
[1:30:18] everybody okay
[1:30:19] so the disciple are on the good
[1:30:22] Direction
[1:30:24] but we still have to see all three
[1:30:27] everybody good
[1:30:30] blessed are your water for the water and
[1:30:34] your water for the water did you see
[1:30:37] Jesus touching the heart no
[1:30:42] so the disciple fulfill number three
[1:30:46] the fulfill number two but they never
[1:30:50] Jesus never say your heart have
[1:30:53] understood
[1:30:56] because if your heart understand the
[1:31:00] disciple should have been converted
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:07] in other words if the heart of the
[1:31:10] disciple were already understanding the
[1:31:13] Holy Spirit should have entered the
[1:31:16] disciple
[1:31:17] so Jesus knew they don't have the Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost yet that's why Jesus pushed the
[1:31:23] break
[1:31:23] and say three you gather two you gather
[1:31:26] but the day of Pentecost is not yet
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:35] this side is on fire
[1:31:37] are you on fire on this side
[1:31:39] are you on fire
[1:31:45] we okay
[1:31:49] listen to John here chapter 7 in the
[1:31:54] last day
[1:31:55] that great day of the feast
[1:31:57] the Feast of Tabernacle Jesus stood in
[1:32:01] Christ saying if any man do it remember
[1:32:04] Old Testament let him do whatever
[1:32:08] he that belief is on me as the scripture
[1:32:12] has said out of his water which barely
[1:32:15] this one that we put McDonough
[1:32:21] out of his water shall flow water rivers
[1:32:25] of Living Water but this whatever he
[1:32:27] speaks this Becky of the water which day
[1:32:32] that believe on him should receive for
[1:32:34] the water Holy Ghost was water
[1:32:38] because Jesus was not yet water
[1:32:40] glorified Jesus have not received the
[1:32:43] glorified body yet no Holy Ghost
[1:32:46] that's why Jesus never say your heart
[1:32:49] have understood
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:52] but wait on the day of Pentecost say
[1:32:55] Jerusalem wait for the holy spirit
[1:32:58] because when the Holy Spirit will come
[1:33:00] then the missing part here will
[1:33:03] understand
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] everybody good you ready to take off
[1:33:15] let me do this and as the engine of the
[1:33:18] airplane is kicking up Amen brother
[1:33:21] Branham saying now how can I tell you
[1:33:23] these things which are see I want to
[1:33:26] preach one of these nights on water
[1:33:28] counterbalance
[1:33:33] man could tell you something and just
[1:33:36] keep building like that but if the end
[1:33:39] no scripture to do what
[1:33:42] he will finally water fall down if the
[1:33:46] desert if this discernment and this
[1:33:48] vision and things that I have told you
[1:33:51] about if there had not been the truth
[1:33:53] first thing there is a water a Bible
[1:33:56] that is doing water to back it up and
[1:33:59] who there was the Holy Spirit to prove
[1:34:01] that I have told you what the truth the
[1:34:03] message your brother Branham is
[1:34:05] perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:34:08] amen everything brother Branham spoke is
[1:34:12] backed up by the word of God
[1:34:16] so it's up to the preacher to know how
[1:34:19] to balance the two together take the
[1:34:22] scripture and the message and put them
[1:34:24] together because the message won't
[1:34:27] contradict the Bible and the Bible won't
[1:34:30] contradict the message because the
[1:34:32] message in the Bible are one
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:41] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:34:44] are approaching you humbly this morning
[1:34:46] Father once again thanking you for your

[1:34:58] to us and move us completely out of the

[1:35:05] yourself as you always do father in the
[1:35:08] name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:35:11] my subject this morning
[1:35:19] he set the record
[1:35:24] upon the evidence of the water
[1:35:28] we want to set the record straight
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] because we went to so many conventions
[1:35:37] we went to so many meetings and we have
[1:35:40] been told that you must receive the Holy
[1:35:43] Spirit
[1:35:45] now how do we know we got the Holy Ghost
[1:35:51] what is the evidence that we got the
[1:35:53] Holy Ghost
[1:35:56] it has been a struggle all along the
[1:35:59] years in the message and everybody put
[1:36:02] their own interpretation based on the
[1:36:05] denomination they came out
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:12] everybody okay I'm not saying we don't
[1:36:15] have the Holy Ghost in this message the
[1:36:17] true Holy Ghost is in the message but
[1:36:20] there is a mixed multitude that traveled
[1:36:22] the campus
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:30] until does that came from Pentecostal
[1:36:34] that describe the holy ghost in a
[1:36:37] Pentecostal way
[1:36:39] and those that came out of the
[1:36:41] Presbyterian are using the Presbyterian
[1:36:44] measurement and those that came out from
[1:36:47] the Baptist are using the Baptist
[1:36:49] measurement how do we know we got the
[1:36:52] Holy Ghost
[1:36:54] this one said it is this way this one
[1:36:56] said it is this way this one said it is
[1:36:59] this way how do we know we got the Holy
[1:37:01] Ghost
[1:37:06] oh yeah
[1:37:09] how do we know
[1:37:11] brother pranam says this
[1:37:14] I believe this
[1:37:16] what do you believe brother Brown let's
[1:37:19] go brother Benjamin that out of water in
[1:37:22] many of those great fine churches
[1:37:24] tonight great water denominational
[1:37:26] churches people who has not yet received
[1:37:30] the water Holy Spirit how many people
[1:37:33] but I believe that way in their heart
[1:37:36] many of them has a warm feeling toward
[1:37:39] who and Desiring the water
[1:37:44] you know the main thing is with our
[1:37:47] water
[1:37:48] it is not the water that is hindering it
[1:37:53] is the way it is how presented sometimes
[1:37:58] if we can present it right in the power
[1:38:02] and the water
[1:38:06] man will be glad to do whatever
[1:38:10] amen
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:15] where are you coming from with this in
[1:38:18] the midst of roof
[1:38:21] last Sunday
[1:38:22] we were talking about the couple Sunday
[1:38:25] before we were in roof dealing with roof
[1:38:29] in the holiest
[1:38:30] in the last phase of roof where roof is
[1:38:33] preparing for the union with Boaz which
[1:38:36] is roof rewarding roof preparing to take
[1:38:39] off for the rapture
[1:38:41] everybody okay
[1:38:42] and I mentioned a quote that brother
[1:38:46] Branham used in reference to the love of
[1:38:49] God
[1:38:50] because according to Jesus they asked
[1:38:53] Jesus a question they say what are the
[1:38:55] great Commandments
[1:38:58] you remember Capo San Diego Jesus said
[1:39:01] You shall love the Lord your God with
[1:39:04] all your heart we follow your soul we
[1:39:06] follow your man and you shall love your
[1:39:08] neighbor as water
[1:39:09] and John put those two Commandments
[1:39:12] together and say there is no way you can
[1:39:14] love God who you don't see if you cannot
[1:39:17] love your brother who you see in other
[1:39:19] words that love goes together
[1:39:21] I will handle that mystery maybe next
[1:39:24] Sunday Lord dwelling everybody okay amen
[1:39:27] so we found out that in order to have
[1:39:30] that love that God was talking about you
[1:39:33] must have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:35] because it's the holy ghost that will
[1:39:37] bring the love of God in your heart
[1:39:40] amen and by the court of brother Branham
[1:39:44] the court that was dealing with the two
[1:39:47] Commandments is what I used couple weeks
[1:39:50] ago on that quote brother Branham says
[1:39:52] this
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] brother Barnum said that love one
[1:39:57] another
[1:39:58] this is we are this will all men know
[1:40:01] you are my disciple when you get water
[1:40:04] love one for the other this is when all
[1:40:06] men will know that you are mine disciple
[1:40:09] got love one for water the other and
[1:40:12] brother Branham said that is the water
[1:40:13] greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost that
[1:40:16] are not of when you can love water one
[1:40:19] another yes sir that is the Great Water
[1:40:21] great water so I took the great
[1:40:25] commandment and coupled this court in
[1:40:28] 1961 to show that in order to fulfill
[1:40:32] the great commandment of God that that
[1:40:35] Jesus spoke of to love God and to love
[1:40:39] your neighbor you need to have the Holy
[1:40:41] Ghost because when the Holy Ghost come
[1:40:43] he brings the bond of perfection you
[1:40:45] remember that now somebody got caught
[1:40:48] right here and reminded me on this and I
[1:40:51] thought he was the Holy Spirit brother
[1:40:53] Barnum said that is the great evidence
[1:40:56] of the water
[1:40:57] goes
[1:40:58] so what is the problem with great
[1:41:01] evidence
[1:41:03] let's go to Hebrew chapter one
[1:41:10] if you dare you can say amen amen glory
[1:41:14] to God
[1:41:23] you there
[1:41:24] first one the Bible says God whoever
[1:41:30] and in water diverse manners spoke in
[1:41:34] past by the water and to the father by
[1:41:36] The Who Prophet God didn't speak one way
[1:41:46] when God spoke to Israel God was not
[1:41:50] using one way
[1:41:55] God spoke to Israel in diverse manner in
[1:42:00] other words in various ways
[1:42:03] in other words if you look at the way
[1:42:06] God spoke to Abraham it's not going to
[1:42:09] be the same way he spoke to Noah foreign
[1:42:18] so if you take your experience and you
[1:42:21] put it on Abraham when Noah will bring
[1:42:25] his experience you won't miss God
[1:42:35] everybody okay everybody together so the
[1:42:38] way God spoke to Abraham is different
[1:42:41] than the way he dealt with Joseph
[1:42:44] the way he dealt with Joseph it is
[1:42:47] different than the way he dealt with
[1:42:48] Ezekiel
[1:42:49] the way he dealt with Ezekiel is
[1:42:52] different than the way he dealt with
[1:42:53] Isaiah but he was God in Isaiah God in
[1:42:57] Abraham God in Moses God is Ezekiel but
[1:43:01] God spoke in various ways
[1:43:09] so those that came under the ministry of
[1:43:12] Ezekiel if you ask them how do God speak
[1:43:15] they will always tell you what God did
[1:43:17] with Ezekiel
[1:43:19] but they will miss God in Abraham
[1:43:23] and those that were in Abraham will miss
[1:43:26] God in Joseph
[1:43:27] and those that were in Joseph will miss
[1:43:30] God in Moses and those is Moses will
[1:43:33] misguard in Jeremiah because God spoke
[1:43:37] to us in various way through the prophet
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:45] in other words in the Old Testament you
[1:43:48] cannot pin God in one spot
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:57] you cannot look at the Old Testament and
[1:44:00] say God is Abraham
[1:44:02] because God will show you his color in
[1:44:05] Joseph
[1:44:06] if you say it's Joseph he shows David if
[1:44:10] you say it's David he shows Isaiah if
[1:44:13] you say Isaiah he shows Ezekiel if you
[1:44:16] say Ezekiel he shows Malachi so it's
[1:44:19] hard to pinpoint God
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:27] because God in diverse manner
[1:44:32] in various ways
[1:44:34] spoke to Our Father by water
[1:44:36] now we got a problem
[1:44:39] if you ask somebody in the Old Testament
[1:44:41] how do God Speak
[1:44:45] some will tell you it's Isaiah
[1:44:47] some will tell you to Jeremiah some will
[1:44:50] tell you it's one of the prophet
[1:44:52] amen but how do we where can we have
[1:44:56] something fixed
[1:44:59] that we can say now we got something
[1:45:02] that contains Isaiah
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:15] take Moses take Jacob take Abraham take
[1:45:20] whoever it is mix them together give me
[1:45:24] one person
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:35] we Okay we okay Mama let's keep calming

[1:46:11] but in this last day he's using the
[1:46:15] prophet
[1:46:16] [Applause]
[1:46:18] he was using sons of man but now he's
[1:46:21] using this son of man

[1:47:57] okay okay
[1:47:58] yeah I have to recalibrate things
[1:48:01] sometimes okay yeah
[1:48:06] it's a language
[1:48:08] amen

[1:48:13] yourself
[1:48:14] bear me witness that I say I am not who
[1:48:17] the Christ that's John the Baptist
[1:48:20] but I am sent before who
[1:48:23] hidah has the bread is the bridegroom
[1:48:27] but the friend of the Bride which stand
[1:48:29] and hear with him which is John the
[1:48:31] Baptist amen re Joseph greatly because
[1:48:35] of the whose voice let's leave that
[1:48:38] alone this my joy therefore is how in
[1:48:42] other words they ask John the Baptist
[1:48:43] are you the Messiah are you the crust
[1:48:45] are you that person that we want to put
[1:48:49] our finger ready and say this is they
[1:48:52] this is God
[1:48:55] because when we want to worship Abraham
[1:48:57] Abraham saying
[1:49:00] that's right amen we look at uh Daniel
[1:49:02] we said Daniel
[1:49:04] this must be God we want to go there and
[1:49:06] say
[1:49:07] keep moving forward I'm just pointing
[1:49:10] you let's go forward
[1:49:12] so there's so John the Baptist they say
[1:49:13] Ah that's you tell us the truth is it
[1:49:16] you John say it's not me I am just
[1:49:19] saying to for running
[1:49:21] we there
[1:49:23] we there watch first study he must do
[1:49:26] water increase but how much how
[1:49:30] he must increase
[1:49:33] amen job 2 verse 34.
[1:49:36] to save time
[1:49:38] for he
[1:49:39] whom God has sent speak the water the
[1:49:43] words of God for God gives not the water
[1:49:47] spirit by water measure to who
[1:49:53] so this son
[1:49:55] that John the Baptist introduced his
[1:49:58] anointing have no measure
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:04] amen
[1:50:05] Joseph you can measure him
[1:50:08] because God only show a color
[1:50:11] Abraham God only demonstrated something
[1:50:15] Daniel God demonstrated something but
[1:50:18] this one if you looking for
[1:50:20] demonstration
[1:50:22] you don't know where to go because he is
[1:50:25] the fullness
[1:50:28] of everything
[1:50:29] everybody good listen to brother Branham
[1:50:33] glory to God
[1:50:34] in the message now I'm in 64.
[1:50:38] that was 61. I'm now after the seals
[1:50:41] now you see when the man was anointed
[1:50:45] like who
[1:50:46] Joseph he portrayed who
[1:50:49] your microphone working good when Moses
[1:50:52] was how anointed he portrayed who Christ
[1:50:55] when David was he portrayed him Christ
[1:50:59] all leading up to who Christ and he was
[1:51:02] the fullness of the water the world was
[1:51:05] made manifested where he was the
[1:51:08] Complete Water anointed one they had it
[1:51:12] by how we have it by how but he wants
[1:51:16] water the anointed one
[1:51:21] so before Jesus Christ you can point
[1:51:26] anyone to portions
[1:51:31] and All Those portions are God
[1:51:35] [Applause]
[1:51:37] everybody okay everybody okay because
[1:51:40] all of them died and they went into
[1:51:43] Paradise you're following me and they
[1:51:46] stuck right there
[1:51:47] amen Jesus also died
[1:51:51] and Jesus dropped down to Paradise
[1:51:54] Jesus never dropped to Paradise as a man
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:04] Jesus was the world made in the
[1:52:08] beginning was what and the Word was with
[1:52:11] her and the Word was made Jesus was
[1:52:15] Melchizedek made flesh Amen in other
[1:52:18] words if you cut the Flesh of Jesus
[1:52:20] Christ and you open him on the east side
[1:52:23] you will see melchized amen
[1:52:28] do you follow me but when Jesus died the
[1:52:32] body of Jesus Christ
[1:52:34] the Flesh of Jesus Christ Jesus Took the
[1:52:37] Flesh and lifted at the tomb
[1:52:40] so did Jesus that went into Paradise is
[1:52:45] not the man Jesus Christ but the word
[1:52:48] that worked with the prophet
[1:52:55] the man Jesus Christ didn't meet Abraham
[1:53:00] foreign
[1:53:05] Jesus Christ that was born from Mary
[1:53:08] never meet Joseph
[1:53:12] the man Jesus Christ that was born out
[1:53:15] of Mary never met Daniel he was the
[1:53:19] Jesus in the Jesus
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:24] everybody okay that was the Jesus of the
[1:53:27] Autumn that Jesus met Abraham that Jesus
[1:53:31] met Daniel that Jesus met Jacob that
[1:53:35] Jesus met a Malachi or the prophet but
[1:53:38] when he come to the order to the New
[1:53:41] Testament that Jesus prepare himself a
[1:53:43] body
[1:53:45] do you follow me and Jesus entered on
[1:53:48] the inside and closed the body
[1:53:51] and I know so when they ask him who are
[1:53:53] you he said I am
[1:53:59] and when they look at him they say but
[1:54:01] this one came from Mary
[1:54:03] amen so the veil was causing the trouble
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:11] when he looked at them he said wait a
[1:54:14] minute you know Abraham before Abraham
[1:54:17] was I was there
[1:54:23] they look at him they say wait a minute
[1:54:25] you're not even 50 years old
[1:54:28] you say you've seen Abraham the man
[1:54:31] didn't see Abraham but the one that was
[1:54:33] in Islam was the one with Abraham
[1:54:37] [Applause]
[1:54:41] everybody okay amen so in order to go to
[1:54:45] paradise if the man goes to Paradise
[1:54:48] Abraham don't remember him
[1:54:50] [Applause]
[1:54:52] because Abraham never met Jesus in the
[1:54:55] body
[1:54:56] Jacob never met Jesus in the body they
[1:55:00] met Jesus as the word
[1:55:03] that's why when he goes to Paradise he
[1:55:06] have to go in his day off honey Amen in
[1:55:09] the word and when he opened the door
[1:55:11] brother Branham say everybody was
[1:55:14] looking at him the way he met them in
[1:55:18] the Old Testament
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:22] everything
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:26] in other words if you put Jesus right
[1:55:30] here in Paradise amen I'm giving an
[1:55:34] illustration when Abraham look
[1:55:37] he sees the same thing that you see but
[1:55:40] when Abraham spoke he said hey Sarah
[1:55:43] come here you remember the man that came
[1:55:46] in now in uh in Genesis 18. the one that
[1:55:50] came that you cook food
[1:55:52] you remember him that's him right there
[1:55:54] Ezekiel said Abraham let me see he said
[1:55:58] what are you talking about Abraham this
[1:56:01] is the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:15] when Daniel came he said move move guys
[1:56:18] move like he said he said in the lion
[1:56:22] then this is the man
[1:56:25] [Applause]
[1:56:34] everybody good shot drag me
[1:56:38] they say move move move move
[1:56:41] they say ah Daniel you remember the
[1:56:44] fourth man we were talking about this is
[1:56:47] him right here
[1:56:48] because he appeared as the word
[1:56:51] according to the personal experience
[1:56:54] [Applause]
[1:57:04] everybody okay everybody okay another
[1:57:08] word all of them were looking at the
[1:57:11] same thing but according to their
[1:57:14] personal experience
[1:57:16] and each one has their own experience
[1:57:18] different than another one but still the
[1:57:21] same God
[1:57:26] what is the happiness of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:30] is
[1:57:31] the Abraham is it Joseph is he is easy
[1:57:36] yes
[1:57:38] who has the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:41] according to your revelation
[1:57:43] [Applause]
[1:57:55] Holy Ghost
[1:57:57] Abraham shouting God the Holy Ghost
[1:58:00] [Applause]
[1:58:09] can I continue Mama we're good let me
[1:58:12] change please my friend Amanda listen to
[1:58:15] brother Branham glory to God
[1:58:19] therefore after who the water we cannot
[1:58:24] point to water something else
[1:58:29] in other words
[1:58:30] in the Old Testament
[1:58:32] Daniel can speak
[1:58:34] Abraham can speak Jacob can speak all of
[1:58:39] them can speak according to their
[1:58:40] experience but when Jesus came
[1:58:43] amen Jesus Took Abraham and put him
[1:58:47] there took Jacob and put him there took
[1:58:49] Daniel and put him there Jesus meets all
[1:58:52] of them together and produce one
[1:58:55] revelation
[1:58:57] that's why brother Branham say when
[1:58:59] Jesus come you can no longer point to
[1:59:02] Jacob
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:06] everybody okay because the fullness is
[1:59:08] there before Jesus you can point to
[1:59:11] anybody but when Jesus come there is no
[1:59:14] one else you can point to you only have
[1:59:16] one person now you can point to if they
[1:59:19] say who is God no longer Abraham no
[1:59:22] longer Jacob God is one person is Jesus
[1:59:25] Christ
[1:59:26] everybody okay
[1:59:29] [Applause]
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:31] let's go brother Branham say he points
[1:59:35] back to who him him the what the word
[1:59:40] not the man
[1:59:42] the word because the word is what gives
[1:59:45] you experience
[1:59:48] amen and brother Brahman pick up water
[1:59:51] his Bible this is the Complete Water
[1:59:54] Revelation the Bible nothing can be or
[1:59:57] whatever taken away this is a complete
[2:00:00] water Revelation all that a shadow of
[2:00:03] him to come but when he come he was the
[2:00:07] water perfect
[2:00:09] everybody portion but when he come he's
[2:00:13] the fullness he's the complete in other

[2:01:00] if your Holy Ghost doesn't line up with
[2:01:04] Jesus Christ your Holy Ghost God problem

[2:01:50] what he said God in Central Time spoke
[2:01:54] to the father through the water God
[2:01:56] spoke through water well the first
[2:01:59] but in this last day through his water
[2:02:02] Jesus Christ there you are I'm very well
[2:02:10] that is the point the final point of
[2:02:13] reference of everything now is the Lord
[2:02:16] Jesus Christ
[2:02:18] amen why is this evidence a problem why
[2:02:23] do we have to handle this evidence why
[2:02:25] do we have to put a record straight on
[2:02:27] this evidence what is going on
[2:02:32] you ready now
[2:02:33] all righty
[2:02:35] brother Branham says this
[2:02:37] glory to God please follow me let me
[2:02:41] download this USB it's big Amen brother
[2:02:45] Branham say in 19 water
[2:02:48] after the seals
[2:02:50] he says what is the fruit of the spirit
[2:02:53] it is what love and water joy and water
[2:02:57] peace and water and water gentleness and
[2:03:00] water goodness fruit of the water spirit
[2:03:03] many people do water rely upon that all
[2:03:07] the time it is the devil sometimes
[2:03:15] we're trying to set the record straight
[2:03:18] everybody okay brother Branham say how
[2:03:21] many times sometimes that is
[2:03:26] he can do whatever
[2:03:28] to the water push your brick
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:35] you ready
[2:03:37] you ready you ready
[2:03:39] impersonation is not original
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:50] let me drop it again to impersonate
[2:03:53] something doesn't know
[2:03:58] eradicate the original
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] that's it the devil doesn't create love
[2:04:07] but he can impersonate love
[2:04:13] so when it is impersonate even though it
[2:04:17] look like it but it's not the original
[2:04:25] when you have a bogus dollar
[2:04:28] amen it looked like a real dollar that's
[2:04:31] why he can deceive but it's still not
[2:04:34] the original
[2:04:35] amen so if you have a bogus dollar it
[2:04:39] doesn't make the original dollar wrong
[2:04:44] why are you saying this because we have
[2:04:48] meteorated
[2:04:50] they're working off the holy spirit in
[2:04:53] this message
[2:04:55] until
[2:04:56] people who have the Holy Ghost are
[2:04:59] afraid to express the Fruit of the
[2:05:01] Spirit
[2:05:01] [Applause]
[2:05:06] because all we hear is speaking in
[2:05:09] tongue is wrong
[2:05:10] speaking in tongue is wrong as any
[2:05:13] appersonation but there is a genuine
[2:05:17] speaking in town
[2:05:18] [Applause]
[2:05:24] to impersonate his what
[2:05:28] what has to impersonate me
[2:05:31] huh to impersonate he means to pretend
[2:05:38] it means to mimic
[2:05:40] it means to imitate
[2:05:43] in the purpose of a show
[2:05:46] an entertainment or in the purpose to
[2:05:49] deceive
[2:05:52] amen so when something is impersonated
[2:05:57] it is no longer an original because God
[2:06:01] is the only one that can create
[2:06:06] there is only two sources
[2:06:09] the First Source is God
[2:06:11] and the other source is the devil amen
[2:06:14] God have the original
[2:06:18] and God can create
[2:06:21] they therefore only impersonate
[2:06:26] amen or he perverts
[2:06:30] amen but that perversion doesn't
[2:06:35] remove the original
[2:06:37] it doesn't discredit The Originals man
[2:06:41] the fact is truth and the original
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:49] amen everybody okay everybody okay so
[2:06:53] brother Branham is saying here
[2:06:55] he says that sometimes that is what the
[2:06:58] devil if it's the devil is that the love
[2:07:01] of the Holy Spirit or the love of the
[2:07:04] impersonation
[2:07:16] if the devil produces a capital you gave
[2:07:18] the devil for the Holy Ghost
[2:07:22] so we need to know what we're talking
[2:07:24] about
[2:07:26] because we got true love
[2:07:29] [Applause]
[2:07:30] amen and brother Branham added two more
[2:07:33] and we end up with four
[2:07:35] you remember the hotel we got a couple
[2:07:38] of
[2:07:41] we got feel your love
[2:07:44] and brother Branham said there was a
[2:07:46] lustful of and the fifth love amen amen
[2:07:50] if the devil want to produce a love do
[2:07:53] you think he's going to produce a
[2:07:55] capital
[2:07:56] agape love can only come from God
[2:07:58] because God is love
[2:08:01] [Applause]
[2:08:03] so the impersonation of the devil is not
[2:08:07] actually the real thing
[2:08:13] cannot continue
[2:08:15] glory to God brother Branham say he can
[2:08:19] impersonate water
[2:08:20] why is he impersonating it because the
[2:08:24] original speaking in tongue came on the
[2:08:26] day of Pentecost now that the original
[2:08:28] has been released he can look at the
[2:08:31] original and manufacture it but it
[2:08:33] doesn't remove the original
[2:08:38] amen he said to the water
[2:08:41] interpretation of it to the water any of
[2:08:45] those gifts he can do whatever
[2:08:46] impersonating
[2:08:50] um or Along come the water
[2:08:54] body brand I'm saying it's a great dark
[2:08:57] Arrow
[2:08:59] and said it is water the water fruit of
[2:09:02] the spirit many of them shows what the
[2:09:04] fruit of the spirit and don't water
[2:09:06] heavy what kind of fruit of the Spirit
[2:09:09] original or impersonated impersonator
[2:09:14] I know why I'm saying that because we
[2:09:16] always say they can they can produce the
[2:09:18] fruit of the spirit like they have the
[2:09:20] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is
[2:09:22] producing the Fruit of the Spirit
[2:09:26] Amen brother Branham said those
[2:09:28] Pharisees could show how
[2:09:31] the fruit the water Jesus could
[2:09:36] [Applause]
[2:09:44] who had the original
[2:09:47] who had the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:49] Jesus when Jesus had the fullness who
[2:09:51] had the Holy Ghost
[2:09:53] even John the Baptist said God asked him
[2:09:56] was it the true one in other words
[2:09:58] everything that was existed Jesus pulled
[2:10:01] everything and put it in himself no one
[2:10:03] have the Holy Ghost that's why he said
[2:10:05] it's expedient for me to go because as
[2:10:08] long as I'm here none of you get it I
[2:10:11] got the whole thing
[2:10:12] amen if he got the Holy Ghost the
[2:10:15] fullness well where did the Pharisee get
[2:10:18] the fruit
[2:10:21] [Applause]
[2:10:23] did they get the fruit from the Holy
[2:10:25] Ghost because the Holy Ghost was not
[2:10:27] given yet
[2:10:28] so which fruit were they coming from you
[2:10:30] need to know how you handling brother
[2:10:33] you need to know how you're using this
[2:10:35] message
[2:10:36] I'm sorry I'm using this but I know what
[2:10:39] I'm talking about I can use it to the
[2:10:41] camera you need to know how to hand the
[2:10:43] brother brother
[2:10:46] amen because no one had the Holy Ghost
[2:10:49] beside Jesus Christ but the Pharisee
[2:10:52] produced 10 times
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:57] what they produce
[2:10:59] brother Branham said the word Pharisee
[2:11:02] means an actor
[2:11:03] so they produced by impersonating
[2:11:09] in other words what they show to be love
[2:11:12] the day you're gonna come in contact
[2:11:15] with them and you begin to live closer
[2:11:17] to them you will realize that it was not
[2:11:20] love
[2:11:20] [Applause]
[2:11:22] he was a manufacturer love
[2:11:26] amen
[2:11:29] [Applause]
[2:11:30] are we good are we good
[2:11:33] this is why brother Branham is saying it
[2:11:36] is not the fruit of the spirit because
[2:11:38] the Holy Ghost brings love
[2:11:41] but they can impersonate it so brother
[2:11:43] Branham doesn't want you to put your
[2:11:45] hand today
[2:11:46] because they're gonna produce that and
[2:11:49] you'll be confused and tomorrow the
[2:11:52] brother that you thought was a brother
[2:11:53] will bite you
[2:11:56] and when you look at the bite it looks
[2:11:59] like the thief of a wolf
[2:12:01] [Applause]
[2:12:03] and you want the hack and a sheep bite
[2:12:06] like a wolf
[2:12:07] he was a wolf in sheep clothing
[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:14] you the one that gave him the Holy Ghost
[2:12:16] because of his expression of love
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:25] we Okay we okay we're good we're good
[2:12:30] we're good in the back
[2:12:34] brother Branham says this
[2:12:36] that is not 64. that is what no
[2:12:39] everything off the water Holy Ghost you
[2:12:42] can rely upon that you can rely upon the
[2:12:45] water fruit of the spirit because the
[2:12:47] first fruit of the spirit is what and
[2:12:49] the Christian Science exercises more
[2:12:52] love than water anybody I know of and
[2:12:55] then even deny who Jesus Christ
[2:13:02] please let me handle this subject to my
[2:13:04] friend
[2:13:05] brother Brandon is saying something here
[2:13:07] before we move on because in the message
[2:13:10] we read quote and we just close and we
[2:13:12] go

[2:13:15] Prophet you need to slow down
[2:13:18] and pray to understand what is the
[2:13:21] prophet saying
[2:13:24] brother Branham is saying here that the
[2:13:27] Christian Science shows more love but
[2:13:30] they are denying Jesus to be divine in
[2:13:33] other words their love amen is contrary
[2:13:38] to the word
[2:13:43] a love that contradicts the word is not
[2:13:48] a genuine love
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:51] it is an impersonation of love it is a
[2:13:56] profession of love and it doesn't I know
[2:13:59] the genuine love of God

[2:14:09] seat belt because I'm gonna uh Dodge an
[2:14:12] asteroid okay okay we somewhere in the

[2:18:07] not The Devil Himself devils
[2:18:09] amen
[2:18:11] when we say devil
[2:18:13] most of the time we look in that Spirit
[2:18:16] like a flooding something like a ghost
[2:18:20] coming
[2:18:21] that's a devil let's look at the Devil a
[2:18:24] little bit different
[2:18:26] are you there
[2:18:28] are you there go to John chapter 6 verse
[2:18:31] 70.
[2:18:33] if you dare you can say Amen verse 70.
[2:18:38] 77 0. amen you there Jesus answered them
[2:18:44] and say what have I now chosen you
[2:18:47] twelve stop he's talking about who
[2:18:50] the disciple where the spirit they were
[2:18:53] water
[2:18:54] continue let's start again have I not
[2:18:57] have not I what chosen
[2:19:00] chosen you watch it well continue my
[2:19:02] friend and what one of you is a devil
[2:19:08] is my Bible different than yours so the
[2:19:12] devil now is how
[2:19:14] it is in skin now thank you my brother
[2:19:17] amen he's in skin now
[2:19:20] amen let's continue
[2:19:23] we want to know who's that devil
[2:19:26] don't take my word we have to know who
[2:19:28] is that Jesus said one of you the
[2:19:30] disciple one of you is the devil we need
[2:19:32] to know who is it
[2:19:34] verse 30 verse 71 let's go he spoke of
[2:19:37] who Judas is scarier
[2:19:40] the son of who Simon for he was for he
[2:19:44] he was that should water betray him
[2:19:47] being one of the waters wow so Judas was
[2:19:50] a devil
[2:19:51] [Applause]
[2:19:53] yes okay
[2:19:56] the Judas cast our devils
[2:19:59] [Applause]
[2:20:01] did you just pray for the sick and they
[2:20:03] got here
[2:20:04] did you see Jews at in the upper room
[2:20:09] the devil belief
[2:20:11] but what kind of belief
[2:20:13] what can the faith did Judah have
[2:20:17] because Judah was justified and
[2:20:20] Sanctified he only missed the Holy Ghost
[2:20:24] did he have
[2:20:26] that's why brother Branham saying You
[2:20:28] must have a what kind of person
[2:20:30] imagine what there is two sort of Heaven
[2:20:34] [Applause]
[2:20:35] there is two sort of love
[2:20:38] there is two sources
[2:20:46] okay listen to brother Branham if who in
[2:20:49] 1965 after the seals if Judas was the
[2:20:53] water see off the water the enemy and
[2:20:56] the water discrepancy he also become and
[2:21:00] dwell Among Us in the person of water
[2:21:03] Judas is scary he never had no real
[2:21:07] water real pain he had what he thought
[2:21:10] was there is such a thing as Heaven a
[2:21:15] water and a make-believe baby and a
[2:21:18] genuine Faith Of God will do it believe
[2:21:22] in God and God is the water and he shall
[2:21:25] never
[2:21:30] take away one our path will be water
[2:21:33] taken from The Book of Life in
[2:21:35] revelation 22
[2:21:43] now when we go back the proof that you
[2:21:47] have the genuine Holy Ghost brother
[2:21:49] Brian I'm saying is to have genuine
[2:21:51] not Faith genuine because you can have
[2:21:55] faith like a devil
[2:21:57] you can have faith like a Judah you can
[2:21:59] have a make-believe Faith or
[2:22:01] intellectual faith
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:06] and that intellectual faith of Judah
[2:22:10] could pray for the sick and they get
[2:22:12] healed
[2:22:18] was that the Holy Ghost
[2:22:21] can I continue can I continue is there
[2:22:25] any here that has not received the
[2:22:27] baptism of the spirit yet and you say
[2:22:30] brother Brian I'mma tell you I shouted
[2:22:32] one time that is very good I spoke in
[2:22:35] tongue once that is very good but still
[2:22:38] that ain't what I'm not talking about
[2:22:40] how can you shout and speak what and
[2:22:44] what deny the word do you see
[2:23:00] push the brick I'm gonna handle what is
[2:23:04] believing and what is receiving
[2:23:10] believe
[2:23:12] amen you already understood what kind of
[2:23:15] faith we have and receive
[2:23:18] amen
[2:23:19] but the devil belief
[2:23:22] [Applause]
[2:23:23] so they therefore God the Holy Ghost
[2:23:29] amen amen the devil believe one God just
[2:23:34] like you
[2:23:36] does he have the Holy Ghost
[2:23:37] do you see now because William Marion
[2:23:40] Branham preached the deity of Jesus
[2:23:42] Christ and the devil also believed the
[2:23:44] deity of Jesus Christ
[2:23:47] is he your brother
[2:23:50] can I continue those priests had Jesus
[2:23:54] what beat a million miles when he comes
[2:23:57] to the water
[2:23:58] how gentle and water and water and water
[2:24:03] Jesus was the one that was whipping
[2:24:05] people
[2:24:06] the pastor whipping people that's a bad
[2:24:09] pastor a pastor should be gentle

[2:24:19] that took and whooped the people
[2:24:22] but they are the person never the people

[2:25:17] Bible okay okay you're my weakness okay
[2:25:21] yeah
[2:25:23] can I continue
[2:25:25] cannot continue can I continue we're
[2:25:28] talking about believing in water
[2:25:32] brother Branham says this in which year
[2:25:34] my friend 64 after the seals
[2:25:37] brother Branham said today I was talking
[2:25:39] with a good friend Dr living who is
[2:25:42] present now he's quite a theologian and
[2:25:45] so we usually have some pretty water
[2:25:47] good discussion not nasty discussion
[2:25:49] good discussion about water the
[2:25:52] scripture very water he asked me one
[2:25:55] time what I thought about the initial
[2:25:57] evidence of the water Holy Ghost was he
[2:26:00] speaking in tongue I have been many
[2:26:02] years it has been many years I said no I
[2:26:06] can't see that he said neither do I say
[2:26:09] though I have been taught that he said
[2:26:11] what would you think about being the
[2:26:14] evidence
[2:26:16] he said I said the most perfect evidence
[2:26:19] I can fake is what love we okay follow
[2:26:23] me carefully he said and so we got to
[2:26:26] talking on that and then I thought that
[2:26:29] sounded pretty good so I just held on
[2:26:32] that if a man has got what love but what
[2:26:35] one day the Lord in the water did water
[2:26:45] slow down okay just stay with me okay
[2:26:49] I'm gonna take you in a higher uh you're
[2:26:52] gonna feel the the the the spaceship
[2:26:55] going again higher okay now and he said
[2:26:58] that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was
[2:27:01] for those who could do what
[2:27:06] we need to Define what is received away
[2:27:11] we need to Define that
[2:27:13] I know why
[2:27:15] okay
[2:27:16] need the water love no water but
[2:27:21] receiving water
[2:27:22] and then Dr Phil was saying to me that
[2:27:25] that is water scripture because in John
[2:27:28] 14 Jesus said we'll continue when he the
[2:27:31] Holy Ghost has come upon you he will
[2:27:33] reveal these things
[2:27:36] I'll show you things to come so there is
[2:27:39] there is the water the genuine evidence
[2:27:42] of the Holy Ghost he has never taught me
[2:27:44] what anything wrong yeah it is the
[2:27:47] evidence of the Holy Ghost is who can do
[2:27:49] what believe the word who can you can
[2:27:52] water
[2:27:56] you ready now let's see what does he
[2:27:59] receive me and believe me you ready my
[2:28:02] friend you ready my friend brother
[2:28:04] Branham says this in which he and my
[2:28:07] friend
[2:28:08] let's go notice and when you are out
[2:28:11] truly baptized it to him the true
[2:28:14] evidence is that water
[2:28:16] the water stop
[2:28:20] watch this now
[2:28:22] make water no mistake about it a person
[2:28:25] that is how truly baptized by the water

[2:28:31] Christ receiving the water fullness of
[2:28:33] the spirit we'll be in the word

[2:29:02] brothers
[2:29:04] that preached this message 20 years

[2:40:31] okay this is the seed
[2:40:34] and in the seed where is what is it
[2:40:37] which life
[2:40:39] because this seed comes from another

[2:41:07] disease
[2:41:10] why do they perish
[2:41:13] why do they perish because they receive
[2:41:16] not the love of the truth stuff what is
[2:41:19] the truth
[2:41:21] the truth is Jesus Christ which is the
[2:41:26] huh
[2:41:28] the truth
[2:41:30] is the word which is Christ
[2:41:33] I am the truth the Lord life and way
[2:41:36] amen so Paul is saying that people are
[2:41:40] perishing
[2:41:42] they don't get saved why because they
[2:41:45] have never received what
[2:41:47] are true so for you to be saved
[2:41:52] for you to receive water
[2:41:54] you must have water
[2:41:58] [Applause]

[2:42:11] must also have eternal life already
[2:42:13] [Applause]
[2:42:15] can I continue now Paul is saying that
[2:42:19] the reason why you are saved is because
[2:42:22] you have the love of the truth
[2:42:26] in other words in your seed here
[2:42:30] the eternal the eternal life that is
[2:42:34] there is already giving you the love of
[2:42:37] God foreign
[2:42:46] ER when you do something something
[2:42:48] struck you
[2:42:50] but you don't know God yet
[2:42:52] but you are sad because something is new
[2:42:55] is already God
[2:42:57] [Applause]
[2:42:59] and love God and hate the devil
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:06] cannot continue
[2:43:10] and he says the love of the truth that
[2:43:13] they may be have so to be saved you must
[2:43:16] have love
[2:43:17] of the truth the truth which is the word
[2:43:23] now for this cause God sent them water
[2:43:25] strong delusion that they should believe
[2:43:28] what because there is no love there
[2:43:32] in other words you are immune
[2:43:36] to believe a life

[2:46:15] message here the opening of what that
[2:46:18] Capstone where does water seven voices
[2:46:22] that is not wrote in there so the
[2:46:25] message of the seven pandas which is the
[2:46:29] message that broke up this Hills is the
[2:46:31] Capstone Ministry that is lost
[2:46:39] can I continue I'm gonna ship I'm gonna
[2:46:42] move the ship again
[2:46:44] we clear
[2:46:45] which Year my friend
[2:46:47] after the seals please explain First
[2:46:50] Corinthians 13 is okay 13. First
[2:46:54] Corinthians 13 speak about what
[2:46:57] you speak about what love which is what
[2:46:59] charity everybody here brother Branham
[2:47:02] interpret us what does this mean because
[2:47:06] he is the perfect interpreter as a
[2:47:09] prophet of the hour
[2:47:10] we says 13 8-12 now that that perfect
[2:47:14] word is restored are these verse for
[2:47:17] fear they ask him a question but when
[2:47:19] I'm saying now I think I just went
[2:47:21] through that didn't I and when that
[2:47:23] which is what perfect has come that
[2:47:26] which is in part shall be how Paul said
[2:47:29] do I speak with tongue of men and Angel
[2:47:31] I do all these things but when that
[2:47:34] which is water is come in the Bible it's
[2:47:37] talking about love listen to brother
[2:47:39] Brown I'm in 624 he says now is there
[2:47:43] anything perfect but who God
[2:47:48] because God is water yes no sir is God
[2:47:52] perfect in the beginning was the word
[2:47:55] and the Word was with what and the Word
[2:47:58] was water the word is still God so when
[2:48:02] that which is perfect is come that which
[2:48:05] is his part is water so brother Branham
[2:48:08] replaces the word love with the word
[2:48:11] [Applause]
[2:48:15] because the love is also the Capstone

[2:50:12] word we already went through that and
[2:50:14] that word is love in you you have
[2:50:17] eternal life so when God meet God

[2:51:38] God so loved the word that he gave his
[2:51:41] only one so we need to see Jesus in your
[2:51:44] life
[2:51:47] so saying I believe the message is not
[2:51:49] enough
[2:51:54] cannot continue
[2:51:55] [Applause]
[2:51:58] can I continue
[2:52:00] listen to brother Branham brother
[2:52:02] Branham says this he says so you are in
[2:52:05] love with uh with Christ and believe

[2:52:29] that loveth is of what
[2:52:31] divine Holy Love not dirty love but how
[2:52:36] and how and how love of who dare the
[2:52:42] word
[2:52:43] [Music]
[2:52:48] you cannot separate love
[2:52:50] from God you cannot separate love from
[2:52:53] the word because the Capstone himself is
[2:52:56] love
[2:52:57] the very essence of deity is love
[2:53:01] the word is love
[2:53:03] [Applause]
[2:53:04] so if you claim to believe the message
[2:53:06] and you don't like the message you don't
[2:53:10] have the Holy Ghost
[2:53:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this

[2:53:21] if you receive the message the message
[2:53:24] will suck you to him
[2:53:27] you receive the message the message will
[2:53:30] receive you because it's love towards
[2:53:32] love
[2:53:32] [Applause]
[2:53:36] it is not an intellectual believing an
[2:53:40] intellectual receiving but it's an
[2:53:42] experienced believing
[2:53:45] an experience receiving
[2:53:49] [Applause]
[2:53:51] [Music]
[2:53:53] we see Theologian in this message
[2:53:56] they're working out like this Theologian
[2:53:58] in this message I believe the message I
[2:54:00] believe the message look how they treat
[2:54:02] one another
[2:54:03] look how you treat your wife
[2:54:05] look how you treat your neighbor
[2:54:07] and your children look at you they say
[2:54:10] the way I'm gonna reach a team I'm out
[2:54:12] of this home because then because they
[2:54:14] want to believe in the message and
[2:54:16] receiving the message never display love
[2:54:26] cannot continue
[2:54:28] cannot continue which here my friend
[2:54:32] after this year that is the water
[2:54:35] evidence of the water the Holy Ghost
[2:54:37] when God does what reveals to you and
[2:54:40] you do what
[2:54:43] how can you accept if you don't have the
[2:54:45] love of the truth to suck the Holy Ghost
[2:54:48] you must have the love of the truth to
[2:54:50] suck love
[2:54:54] now what you are
[2:54:56] not what you are what you was or nothing
[2:55:00] about it it is who what God has done for
[2:55:03] you now there is the water it is not
[2:55:07] your believing it
[2:55:09] believing God
[2:55:13] is that the word it is not you receiving
[2:55:16] God it is guarding you receiving God
[2:55:21] the evidence
[2:55:22] [Applause]
[2:55:26] because you can receive it

[3:16:36] one singer no I'm not the same person
[3:16:39] that I used to be I'm not where I'm
[3:16:41] supposed to be yet because we don't have
[3:16:42] the Redemption of the body but I can
[3:16:44] tell a change
[3:16:48] you know that somebody's working in your
[3:16:50] life that is greater than you any
[3:16:53] question let's stand
[3:17:04] thank you very much for the sacrifice
[3:17:06] I have to lay it down
[3:17:08] like I told you go home
[3:17:12] go home tonight you can even go take a
[3:17:14] break and sleep
[3:17:16] go home
[3:17:18] review this I loaded
[3:17:20] amen
[3:17:22] all our Worth to go through every
[3:17:24] direction I went is to knock out things
[3:17:27] that are going on in this message that
[3:17:29] are confusing the people
[3:17:31] amen we need to come up to a place where
[3:17:34] we can rest our soul and know for
[3:17:36] another child of a doubt that it is I
[3:17:39] have a quote brother Branham saying he
[3:17:41] lay hands on the people and when they
[3:17:43] receive the Holy Ghost they fell like
[3:17:45] flies in these messages people fail like
[3:17:47] flies they say it's Pentecostal
[3:17:52] so your experience don't wait to be
[3:17:54] matching somebody experience
[3:17:57] somebody must scream when the Holy Ghost
[3:17:59] comes somebody will be quiet and tears
[3:18:01] are coming down somebody will be sitting
[3:18:04] and fell on the floor somebody will be
[3:18:06] rolling on the floor because Abraham
[3:18:08] experience is different than Joseph
[3:18:10] Joseph experience is different but all
[3:18:12] together when the Capstone will come to
[3:18:15] come to pick us up we are with our
[3:18:17] individual experience like brother
[3:18:19] Samuel say your work is a individual
[3:18:23] Pilgrim we will find ourselves suck
[3:18:25] according to all our different
[3:18:27] experiences and we're gonna meet the
[3:18:29] bridegroom and all our experiences will
[3:18:31] be represented when we see him when we
[3:18:34] see him your experience will be there my
[3:18:36] experience will be there because it was
[3:18:38] God in brother Charles God in Benjamin
[3:18:41] God in brother so God insisted so and so
[3:18:44] God insisted so and so it's God in his
[3:18:46] people God in the bread but in the
[3:18:50] various way just like he did to the
[3:18:52] prophet Heavenly Father Lord we are
[3:18:54] approaching you again humbly this

[3:19:25] coming unfolding itself inside our own
[3:19:29] being when we know without a shadow of

[3:19:35] from there on we can express the love we
[3:19:38] can express the joy we can express all

[3:19:43] father that there is a genuine anchor
[3:19:46] that have anchored to the soul and we're
[3:19:48] not laying that on a preacher or a
[3:19:51] church or anyone but it's a personal
