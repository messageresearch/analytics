[44:36] the reason that we'll be married to him
[44:38] is because we should know jesus how did
[44:41] you lord i don't pray you see this
[44:43] tonight saying hallelujah there's no one
[44:45] like jesus tonight how do you deal with
[44:48] god
[44:54] the bible says see he said there would
[44:56] be an invisible you
[44:58] and he said before we get there it must
[45:00] take place first healing
[45:03] and so that you may know him and the
[45:06] power of his
[45:08] hallelujah lord god that you see my
[45:11] brother to know him his life tonight
[45:14] hallelujah i just i just said i just
[45:16] greet your name on jesus christ i said
[45:18] lord i said i said lord just please
[45:21] leave me i just wanted to share some
[45:23] testimonies with the saints amen and
[45:25] just say lord it's good to have
[45:26] fellowship this is to have fellowship
[45:29] with him amen so
[45:30] before we do so i just want to read a
[45:32] little bit of the word to you amen
[45:35] so as you're standing amen let's just
[45:37] turn over to to uh let's just say
[45:40] matthew matthew 11.
[45:42] and um
[45:43] and matter of fact uh
[45:44] let's kind of jump around a little bit
[45:46] matter of fact let's first let's turn to
[45:48] revelations
[45:49] i'll read this and then we'll jump back
[45:51] to matthew
[45:56] when i say lord
[45:59] let's say which scripture i just want to
[46:00] read to you before i just let you have
[46:02] your seats
[46:03] 12 and 11
[46:06] and then we'll jump back amen to matthew
[46:10] so just look at this here amen tonight
[46:16] and the bible said i started verse 10.
[46:19] it said and i heard a loud voice saying
[46:21] in heaven
[46:22] now has come salvation and strength and
[46:24] the kingdom of our god
[46:27] and the power of his christ
[46:29] why for the accuser
[46:32] of our brother is cast down
[46:35] and so now when satan is cast down now
[46:37] you can get victory
[46:39] you see now he said i heard a brother
[46:41] sing a song and say hallelujah anyhow he
[46:43] said he don't belong to your right he
[46:45] don't belong to your left satan don't
[46:47] belong in front of you but he belongs
[46:49] under your feet
[46:51] so here he's telling us the accuser has
[46:53] been cast down
[46:55] now tonight it's already a finished work
[46:58] and he says which accused them before
[47:00] our god day
[47:02] and night
[47:03] so he's always got an accusation for you
[47:05] just think about this
[47:07] but in the bible in verse 11 and they
[47:09] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[47:12] and by the word of their testimony
[47:17] each and every person's own testimony
[47:20] and he said and they love not their
[47:22] lives unto death
[47:24] can you say amen
[47:26] amen let's just turn back to matthew 11.
[47:29] amen
[47:31] in matthew 11
[47:33] it says uh
[47:35] i'll just i'll just drop down to verse 4
[47:39] and it says and jesus answered and said
[47:41] unto them
[47:43] go and show john again those things
[47:46] which ye do hear
[47:49] and see
[47:50] let us pray
[47:52] oh lord gracious heavenly father lord
[47:54] anyone can turn the pages of this book
[47:56] lord god but heavenly father it takes
[47:59] you lord the author to come lord and
[48:01] break the bread of eternal life to our
[48:03] hearts lord lord with nothing here
[48:05] tonight lord but we just have need that
[48:07] you pass by this way lord you know the
[48:10] needs heavenly father of your children
[48:12] lord you know heavenly father lord their
[48:14] ups their downs with all they have need
[48:16] of and lord even tonight lord we ask you
[48:19] the heavenly father come and speak to
[48:21] our hearts for your glory in jesus
[48:23] christ's name lord we say amen amen yes
[48:26] lord amen
[48:28] you know as you just have your seats
[48:30] tonight we just greet your name of jesus
[48:32] christ you know i'm a i'm from columbia
[48:34] south carolina my parents moved further
[48:37] north and i guess i moved further west
[48:39] so i don't know maybe some god will
[48:42] bring us we meet in the middle somewhere
[48:43] you know but but now we live in alabama
[48:47] and to come down and i was thinking i
[48:48] had a chance to it was maybe almost a
[48:51] month ago um my mother-in-law had been
[48:54] diagnosed with kovid she's an assistant
[48:55] living she's like maybe 75 or something
[48:59] so she had dementia at all times just
[49:00] struck her early so we were going to go
[49:03] down there and we said well laura how
[49:05] can we do this so we um but by the time
[49:08] we got here we couldn't go there so we
[49:10] came to my parents and i got a chance to
[49:12] come visit
[49:14] and i said uh lord i said now um all the
[49:17] wonderful ministers and i said boy
[49:19] awesome
[49:21] i said my so i said lord what can i say
[49:24] amen with such astounding teaching and
[49:26] preaching that you all have been hearing
[49:28] i said lord i said maybe i just share
[49:31] you know a testimony to encourage your
[49:33] faith tonight amen and i say you know
[49:35] from my heart um
[49:37] you know brother branham he said
[49:38] teaching establishes the people
[49:41] and you say it's a lot of things that
[49:43] you know you you grow and as you as you
[49:46] said you might you hear the gospel
[49:47] preach and it's the net that's cast out
[49:50] and brings all kind of stuff in
[49:52] but then now along your way you need to
[49:54] be settled
[49:56] and god gives you a way to sell you
[49:58] and i say lord i say so may he do that
[50:01] this amen and continue to do that
[50:03] amongst you all to see amen
[50:06] and i say um
[50:07] so i i say i mean to start to tell you i
[50:10] just
[50:11] i just want to share
[50:12] um
[50:13] if we'll come back to this i want to
[50:15] share something brother brandon uh he
[50:16] read i was going to read let me see here
[50:19] i have it
[50:20] it was on i think victory day
[50:23] and
[50:24] i want you to realize you know
[50:27] in this journey there are many ups and
[50:29] downs
[50:30] and god allows it brother carl loves us
[50:35] he say brother i will serve him even if
[50:37] there's no reward
[50:41] you know amen hallelujah
[50:43] see him amen
[50:45] um
[50:46] and he said this he says uh brother
[50:48] brown he said this this is
[50:50] victory day and he says god lets
[50:52] disappointments happen
[50:54] to show victory
[50:59] now you know you don't really know how
[51:00] to win until you've taken a loss before
[51:04] the law stings when you take a loss
[51:07] nobody takes likes to take a loss
[51:09] and you see in my current job you know i
[51:11] so i trade energy right and every day we
[51:13] get graded on did you make money or lose
[51:16] money
[51:17] that's all we care about
[51:19] we want to see green and we don't want
[51:21] to see a loss
[51:23] right and so i was thinking i said now
[51:25] he said but god allows you
[51:28] to suffer losses along the way
[51:30] because he wants to show his might
[51:33] he wants to show his strength he wants
[51:36] to show what victory really is
[51:40] and he says oh if we could only see that
[51:44] he said if we could see that he said you
[51:46] see you only see that these things that
[51:49] seem to be burying you
[51:51] that seem to be upsetting you along this
[51:53] way
[51:54] he said they're only trials
[51:57] now a trial is something you go through
[52:00] but the trial is not the judgment
[52:02] you see going to the prison there's many
[52:05] people that are locked up
[52:07] they've already been to court they
[52:09] already know they're sentenced they know
[52:10] they're fine so now they're serving time
[52:14] and i want you to know you see when i
[52:15] went to the prison started in alabama
[52:17] it's like it changed the bible looks a
[52:19] little different to me because you see
[52:21] when jesus said he said no man would
[52:24] make it
[52:25] none of us
[52:26] would make it as much as you say you
[52:28] love god
[52:30] none of us would make it unless jesus
[52:32] shortened the time
[52:34] now look at this now my brother so you
[52:37] are what you are by grace and you are
[52:39] saved by grace what he said now we love
[52:42] him and his faith operating by love in
[52:45] this hour that's bringing us unto him
[52:48] and jesus had to shorten the time so you
[52:50] see everybody that's sitting in prison
[52:52] they're doing different bids
[52:54] they're doing different amount of time
[52:56] and some guys that say i've been there
[52:57] 22 years i got 10 more to go he said one
[53:00] guy said i've been there five years i
[53:02] can't barely make it
[53:04] but he says you have to learn how to do
[53:07] your time
[53:08] you have to learn how to go through the
[53:11] trials
[53:12] and he says now remember it's only he
[53:14] said don't count these trials that you
[53:16] go through as nothing
[53:18] but he told us it says count him he said
[53:20] more precious than gold
[53:23] that's been tried by a fire
[53:26] you see i remember when i was at brother
[53:28] tony's we was in atlanta so i was living
[53:29] there for many years and you know we
[53:31] have people there from the congo and
[53:33] from cultivoir and ivory coast and ghana
[53:36] and we would enjoy food and pepper soup
[53:39] and oh rice jello off all kinds of great
[53:41] dishes and fellowship
[53:44] but the one thing you know you would see
[53:46] is that you know it's something to see
[53:48] that people are going through different
[53:50] trials someone have husbands or wives
[53:52] that are overseas they're waiting on the
[53:54] lottery they're in prayer they're
[53:56] bringing the kids to church you know
[53:58] they're waiting they're waiting on god
[53:59] to make a move
[54:02] they're going through trials oh i pray
[54:03] you see me
[54:05] and so when somebody now would come and
[54:08] join the fellowship my brother oh it
[54:11] would be a good time
[54:13] because you would see that god had moved
[54:16] over those prayers at night he had moved
[54:19] over the family he had brought joy into
[54:21] the whole opera he brought joy why
[54:24] because he said this is now nothing that
[54:26] we're going through is not eternal it's
[54:28] only temple
[54:30] it's holy temple
[54:32] so god remember he likes to sit back
[54:35] sometimes and see what you will do
[54:38] in the midst of your child
[54:42] he wants to see what you would do
[54:44] remember god he told by the burden he
[54:46] said that you're sitting there and he
[54:48] went to go pray for a little boy little
[54:50] ricky and he said he said he went in
[54:52] there and he saw his tongue was sticking
[54:54] out and how he had they had to put a
[54:56] hole because it was cancer in the mouth
[54:57] and he was sitting there and he said
[54:59] lord he said god you mean to tell me
[55:01] that you get joy out of seeing this
[55:06] he said then the lord spoke to him
[55:08] and he said i've given the power to the
[55:10] church
[55:12] he said now i want to see what you're
[55:14] doing
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:17] he said i want to see what you do with
[55:20] what i've given you in the midst of your
[55:22] trial
[55:23] [Applause]
[55:25] hallelujah
[55:27] you see some people lose hope in the
[55:29] midst of their child some people lose
[55:32] joy in the midst of their child somebody
[55:35] will lose their faith in the midst of
[55:36] the trial and it shows because you can't
[55:39] stop praising god just because you're
[55:42] going through a trial
[55:44] hallelujah
[55:45] hallelujah
[55:47] you see it shows do you really believe
[55:50] my brother
[55:51] it shows if you believe if your
[55:53] bridegroom has come and spoke to you it
[55:56] shows that you believe that he told you
[55:58] that he's going to be there
[56:00] it shows that you believe that he said
[56:02] he's going to come and pick you up so
[56:04] it's time to get your dress ready it's
[56:06] time to get your hair back it's time to
[56:09] fix your tie because the bride guru is
[56:12] coming my brother hallelujah
[56:15] hallelujah i pray you see my brother
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:19] is what he said he said these things he
[56:22] said what you should do is stand still
[56:26] he said just stand
[56:29] and focus your glasses on the word of
[56:33] god hallelujah lord god
[56:35] focus your glasses because it's easy
[56:38] sometimes will stop getting your eye
[56:39] it's hard you forget where you're going
[56:42] but remember the gps is guiding you
[56:47] the gps is guiding you
[56:49] he's comforting you
[56:51] he's keeping you he's leading you and
[56:54] guiding you into all truth hallelujah
[56:59] and when it comes it brings rejoicing my
[57:01] brother
[57:02] it brings joystick you see we first
[57:04] started the church was in atlanta it was
[57:06] a little church and it was maybe this
[57:08] big
[57:09] and i was playing the drums and the drum
[57:11] is right next to the bathroom door

[57:32] yelling out with a fan
[57:34] but god something said

[57:54] different all these people look hear me

[57:59] blessing the people as we saw the boat

[58:05] the people begin to pray and people god
[58:07] was saying black people and african and
[58:10] chinese hallelujah spanish what was it
[58:13] it was god doing a work in the city of
[58:16] atlanta
[58:18] now i want to tell you something when
[58:20] you see that you say lord what are you
[58:23] doing
[58:24] one night we're sitting there praying
[58:26] for the air conditioner
[58:27] and brother james he came by and god had
[58:30] touched me praying said lord then we
[58:31] need about three thousand dollars for
[58:32] the air conditioning
[58:34] and god came by he touched brother thank
[58:37] you anybody nobody james but the parents
[58:38] brother
[58:39] he touched them to sow a seed
[58:43] and i said lord why would you have this
[58:45] man drive all the way from over town
[58:47] and he said just to plant a seed
[58:50] but he wasn't in prayer that night
[58:54] he wasn't there with the other brothers
[58:56] and all whoever wanted to come sisters
[58:58] included he wasn't there when we were
[59:00] praying saying lord we have a
[59:02] need and when you see god move over the
[59:06] knee it gives you faith to know that
[59:09] through the child god is still what he
[59:12] still cares about his people
[59:15] hallelujah my brother
[59:17] they said man what kyle you know why are
[59:19] you here i said lord i'm just being led
[59:21] by god
[59:22] and you learn how to pray
[59:25] you learn how to fast
[59:27] you know
[59:29] god shout he takes you to something so
[59:31] you can learn something
[59:33] hallelujah
[59:35] to learn because you don't know what's
[59:37] ahead
[59:38] and look what he said i just kind of
[59:40] keep reading when you focus your glasses
[59:42] on the word when you go to the
[59:43] optometrist right
[59:45] all they're trying to do
[59:47] is get corrected what you already have
[59:50] they can't put light in your body
[59:53] right they can't do anything if you get
[59:55] lasik they can change the lens
[59:58] they can change the contour of your eye
[59:59] but what they cannot do is make you see
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:04] so when god shines the light with you on
[1:00:08] the word and he gives you the glasses
[1:00:11] the eye sounds they'll point to your
[1:00:13] eyes to be able to see in this hour what
[1:00:17] god is doing do you see how blessed you
[1:00:20] are even though the glasses got a little
[1:00:22] foggy
[1:00:24] they just got a little foggy
[1:00:26] and that happens along the way
[1:00:28] i just call hallelujahs keep reading so
[1:00:30] what he said is speak the word and then
[1:00:33] just walk forward
[1:00:36] that's all you have to do
[1:00:38] speak the word and walk forward in it
[1:00:41] believe in him who sent you
[1:00:44] who called you who's keeping you
[1:00:47] believing
[1:00:48] and then he said he said we get to a
[1:00:51] time we say god i don't know what to do
[1:00:53] i'm up against it speak the word lord i
[1:00:55] believe
[1:00:56] just start walking forward god does the
[1:00:59] opening up of the sea
[1:01:02] you just keep walking
[1:01:04] you see
[1:01:05] it's something you know when i was i was
[1:01:08] thinking about this this evening
[1:01:10] down
[1:01:11] in the prison
[1:01:13] it's such a dark environment
[1:01:17] and the person that come to my heart
[1:01:19] look at john the baptist
[1:01:22] now we know by the birth of john you
[1:01:24] could say naturally he was a cousin of
[1:01:26] jesus
[1:01:27] born of six months apart
[1:01:29] you know and and we know john the bible
[1:01:32] says that john wasn't just anybody
[1:01:35] john was a man sent from god
[1:01:38] he was born by sex but sent from god
[1:01:42] and john had a miraculous ministry
[1:01:45] john the bible said thank you my brother
[1:01:47] the bible tells us that john was to come
[1:01:50] in malachi 3 it tells us that he was the
[1:01:52] messenger that he said behold i said
[1:01:54] before what my face so he was come to
[1:01:57] prepare the way of jesus christ
[1:02:01] and he came in the power of spirit of
[1:02:02] elijah and he did everything and guess
[1:02:05] what the people missed him because he
[1:02:06] did no miracles
[1:02:09] because he didn't i said oh hold on how
[1:02:11] could this be if he was elijah if he had
[1:02:14] the same spirit that he's supposed to be
[1:02:16] doing miracles
[1:02:23] but what could be greater than john the
[1:02:25] baptist as he took all the rebuke from
[1:02:28] zacharias and understanding that his
[1:02:30] father was a priest but god took him on
[1:02:33] the back side of the desert and wanted
[1:02:34] to use john as what to show that now i'm
[1:02:37] not going to bring you up to a
[1:02:39] denomination i'm going to have you on
[1:02:41] the backside to call you out because i
[1:02:43] want to use you in a special way to
[1:02:46] bring what to turn the hearts of the
[1:02:48] fathers to the children
[1:02:50] i gotta bring them back
[1:02:53] i gotta deal with some of those
[1:02:54] religious demons hallelujah
[1:02:57] i gotta get them to start seeing how
[1:02:59] they went and got my people to go in the
[1:03:01] era
[1:03:03] so you see they came out everybody was
[1:03:05] getting baptized they rolling around in
[1:03:07] the dirt dirt in their ears dirty water
[1:03:10] in their nose and they say oh we're
[1:03:11] getting baptized in dirty joy
[1:03:15] i'm repenting and god loves me
[1:03:18] he said why did god sit into that almost
[1:03:20] nastiest little little place brother
[1:03:23] brown remember he said he said sometimes
[1:03:25] this is that little mission corner that
[1:03:26] you drive by
[1:03:28] and you say ain't nobody no hotel
[1:03:30] serving god
[1:03:31] we're just going to keep driving he said
[1:03:33] that's a little place where god is right
[1:03:36] there
[1:03:38] he said i went into that little place he
[1:03:41] said it was a it's a church that used to
[1:03:43] be a saloon and he said i remember in
[1:03:45] that old donkey he said an eagle at that
[1:03:48] he said he came into my face and he said
[1:03:50] sir have you received the holy ghost
[1:03:52] since you believe
[1:03:54] and he said i looked at that colored
[1:03:56] black man i looked his head huh i didn't
[1:04:00] and he said even with my friends didn't
[1:04:01] want to go he said i knew what they had
[1:04:04] is what i needed
[1:04:08] i knew that's what i that's what i
[1:04:10] needed oh i pray you hear me tonight
[1:04:12] brother
[1:04:14] go tell john
[1:04:16] go tell you
[1:04:19] you see
[1:04:20] as great as his ministry was
[1:04:23] he introduced the messiah you know the
[1:04:24] story he's standing there on the banks
[1:04:26] john didn't know who he was he said
[1:04:29] there's one among you
[1:04:31] but he said but one day he said with the
[1:04:34] spirit of god he showed me he had to who
[1:04:36] you see the spirit of god descend and
[1:04:39] remain he said that is him so it's not
[1:04:43] enough for you just to get the holy
[1:04:45] ghost and start your journey
[1:04:47] but the holy ghost when it falls on you
[1:04:50] it must remain
[1:04:52] it must remain
[1:04:55] you know hallelujah greed not the holy
[1:04:57] ghost whereby you've been sealed to the
[1:05:00] day of redemption so you see don't
[1:05:02] grieve it don't grieve it but remember
[1:05:04] he wants to abide and remain hallelujah
[1:05:07] so he begins walking and i want you to
[1:05:10] see one day he looks up he didn't know
[1:05:13] but he saw him
[1:05:15] and he said behold
[1:05:17] the lamb of god who come to take away
[1:05:20] all the sins of the world
[1:05:24] now maybe everybody couldn't see
[1:05:26] but you see the bible doesn't say the
[1:05:28] spirit like a dove
[1:05:30] it says the bible said the spirit of god
[1:05:33] like adult it wasn't anything but god
[1:05:36] himself coming down on the prophet
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:41] that's why brother burnham he could say
[1:05:43] he said he wasn't one he said this was
[1:05:46] your whole pain as a baby this was him
[1:05:48] growing up pomona but he said he wasn't
[1:05:50] what anointed until he came and got
[1:05:53] baptized
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:56] he's hallelujah that's every believer
[1:05:58] must come to money joy
[1:06:01] every believer
[1:06:03] and when he said the spirit of god
[1:06:04] descended like a dog
[1:06:07] as he told that's how oh i pray not not
[1:06:10] the third person not the second person
[1:06:13] not the first or maybe two and a half
[1:06:16] it was god himself
[1:06:18] and it's so like a dog the lamb and the
[1:06:21] dove
[1:06:22] coming one
[1:06:24] and as he's there in the water
[1:06:26] now the bible says then straightway and
[1:06:28] being full of the holy
[1:06:30] ghost now the holy ghost leads him into
[1:06:34] the wilderness
[1:06:36] john shaw all of that he said i must
[1:06:38] decrease so he can increase
[1:06:42] he can increase
[1:06:43] he said i'm not that light i'm just here
[1:06:45] to testify of that life
[1:06:47] so here's john
[1:06:49] he goes on he you say man john is mighty
[1:06:52] he had people following him
[1:06:54] he had a wonderful ministry
[1:06:57] but
[1:06:58] everybody couldn't go on with jesus
[1:07:01] some were blinded by john
[1:07:04] they were blinded by the lesser light
[1:07:06] some of you have been blinded because
[1:07:08] they got stuck on brother branham but
[1:07:11] they can't see the revelation of who
[1:07:13] brother browning was introducing you to
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:17] they get stuck on the man it's always
[1:07:20] been that way
[1:07:21] it's always been that way
[1:07:23] so it's not new
[1:07:25] but what we can see a bride is only she
[1:07:28] cares about seeing her husband
[1:07:31] i pray you see esther she listen to hey
[1:07:34] yeah she angry i told her what to wear
[1:07:37] she had a choice she could wear anything
[1:07:39] she wanted but for some reason it was
[1:07:42] something predestinated in esther to say
[1:07:45] i'm only going to do what i'm only going
[1:07:47] to put on what the king's chamberlain
[1:07:50] told me to wear
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:53] i pray you see
[1:07:55] so she had to make a choice she could go
[1:07:57] into the house of just gas she could be
[1:08:00] like all the other concubines or she
[1:08:02] could have fellowship with her lord
[1:08:06] for some reason she took him at his word
[1:08:09] she took him at his word
[1:08:11] if all the king's life is this a little
[1:08:14] long hair
[1:08:16] if long he wants me to get out of them
[1:08:17] high heels that's fine
[1:08:19] if he wants me to take up all this
[1:08:21] makeup that's fine
[1:08:22] if i don't need no bling or no blouse to
[1:08:25] please him that's fine
[1:08:27] but if what you say just please the king
[1:08:30] i'll take you at your word
[1:08:34] i pray you see my brother i pray so
[1:08:37] that's what she did she took him at his
[1:08:39] word and i pray tonight you and i have
[1:08:41] to do the same thing
[1:08:44] you and i have to do the same thing
[1:08:48] [Applause]
[1:08:50] you see
[1:08:52] along the journey sometimes you will get
[1:08:54] weak
[1:08:55] sometimes you'll go through ups and
[1:08:57] downs
[1:08:58] and i'll think about as john his
[1:09:01] ministry decreased
[1:09:03] we know that
[1:09:04] a woman rises up
[1:09:06] she had a spirit like jezebel alona
[1:09:09] and she wanted
[1:09:11] she had her her daughter danced before
[1:09:13] the king
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:15] you can imagine it's probably some kind
[1:09:16] of provocative type of dance
[1:09:19] and when she did the king was so moved
[1:09:21] he said he said assistant i'll give you
[1:09:23] up to half of my kingdom tell me what
[1:09:25] you want
[1:09:27] and she runs back to her mother oh we
[1:09:29] don't have time
[1:09:31] but she runs back to her mother
[1:09:33] and her mother said ask for one thing
[1:09:35] the head of john the baptist
[1:09:37] that's all that's all just bring it to
[1:09:39] me on a platter get a charge and just
[1:09:41] bring it to me all i want to see is head
[1:09:44] and you see here
[1:09:46] she knew
[1:09:47] now the person that was bringing rebuke
[1:09:49] it was god
[1:09:51] because of what she was doing and the
[1:09:53] king he said you can't it's unlawful for
[1:09:55] you to marry her
[1:09:56] he was telling he said look i'm i hate
[1:09:59] that guy that same spirit of jezebel i
[1:10:01] hate that guy i hate him i can't stand
[1:10:04] him so bring me what the head of him on
[1:10:06] the planet
[1:10:08] and that's what happened
[1:10:11] john didn't know that when he started
[1:10:12] out
[1:10:14] he didn't know that when he was in
[1:10:15] prison
[1:10:16] he had a feeling that it'd be maybe this
[1:10:18] will happen and that but he didn't know
[1:10:20] that
[1:10:21] oh thank you brother so what happened
[1:10:26] before all of that
[1:10:28] john was in prison and he got weak one
[1:10:30] day
[1:10:32] and he got so weak
[1:10:34] can you imagine there wasn't no
[1:10:35] electricity there wasn't no tv
[1:10:37] there wasn't no concession there wasn't
[1:10:40] somebody putting money on the books
[1:10:42] there wasn't no we're gonna give you
[1:10:43] this parole day it wasn't none of that
[1:10:45] give him the blood the brain of
[1:10:47] affliction
[1:10:48] don't even talk to him that's not that's
[1:10:50] i say so
[1:10:51] john was in prison suffering
[1:10:54] and as he was there
[1:10:56] maybe some two disciples would come
[1:10:58] around every now and then say
[1:10:59] john
[1:11:01] how you doing john
[1:11:03] sometime in your life god made sense
[1:11:04] just somebody give you a little
[1:11:05] encouragement
[1:11:07] how you doing bro
[1:11:09] sister is everything going okay
[1:11:12] we still believe god with you
[1:11:14] [Laughter]
[1:11:18] we still believe god with you we we can
[1:11:20] see god is still with you
[1:11:23] but this one day it says john was so low
[1:11:25] he said
[1:11:28] james
[1:11:29] james i got a question for you whatever
[1:11:30] you need me he said whatever you need
[1:11:32] what he said just didn't say let's just
[1:11:34] ask him he said ask him
[1:11:37] so john he says
[1:11:39] peter james i'm just
[1:11:41] i got this question
[1:11:44] go ask him
[1:11:46] and you know who him is
[1:11:48] go ask him
[1:11:50] is he the one
[1:11:52] or shouldn't we look for now
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:56] oh
[1:11:58] how could you how could he ask this
[1:11:59] question
[1:12:00] you know brother bram said he was honest
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:08] he said he was honest
[1:12:10] he just wanted to know
[1:12:12] he said sometimes down in the valley
[1:12:14] remember the eagle gets scales over his
[1:12:16] eye
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:18] he's still an eagle
[1:12:19] but he got
[1:12:20] scales time
[1:12:22] and he's sitting there he got a little
[1:12:23] weak he said just go ask him is he the
[1:12:26] one
[1:12:27] or should we look for somebody else
[1:12:30] now notice
[1:12:32] john didn't say
[1:12:34] ask him he's my cousin
[1:12:37] tell him to come get me out of jail
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:40] tell him to bust his face down
[1:12:43] no he didn't need that
[1:12:46] he's he didn't mind being in his
[1:12:48] situation
[1:12:51] he knew that all things worked together
[1:12:54] for the good
[1:12:55] for them that loved the lord and there's
[1:12:57] no way that he was there in prison
[1:13:00] unless god allowed it so he never asked
[1:13:03] him to bust him out of jail
[1:13:05] but he said just reveal to me are you
[1:13:08] the one
[1:13:11] all he wanted to know was are you the
[1:13:14] one
[1:13:16] you see along this christian journey you
[1:13:18] will have to know you're going to come
[1:13:19] to a place is he the one
[1:13:22] did brother branham introduce you to him
[1:13:26] is he the one
[1:13:28] there are many other jesuses jesus
[1:13:31] different denominations but have you
[1:13:34] been introduced to him
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:39] ask him how do you
[1:13:41] ask him
[1:13:42] and he says he's sitting here and now he
[1:13:45] says go ask him they said
[1:13:47] okay john
[1:13:48] we're going to do this for you
[1:13:50] we know in your situation we know how
[1:13:52] tough it is
[1:13:54] just hold right there
[1:13:56] maybe take home
[1:13:58] let's go ask jesus
[1:14:00] we got a question for jesus
[1:14:02] let's see what jesus said about this
[1:14:04] let's go to the word
[1:14:06] let's see what the word says
[1:14:09] let's see it doesn't answer in the word
[1:14:12] because john we know he's a prophet and
[1:14:15] he always point us to nothing but the
[1:14:17] word let's go ask jesus
[1:14:20] so he comes
[1:14:22] and he gets there brother and he said
[1:14:25] jesus
[1:14:26] we got a problem with y'all
[1:14:28] john's got a question for you
[1:14:30] john just want to know something he's
[1:14:32] down to prison
[1:14:34] and he ain't blaming you for not coming
[1:14:35] to see him
[1:14:37] he don't need you to put no money on the
[1:14:38] book
[1:14:39] he said you could just stay where you at
[1:14:42] he said you ain't gotta do nothing for

[1:14:49] for uncle zachariah you ain't gonna do
[1:14:50] nothing like that all i wanna know
[1:14:53] he just wants to know are you the one
[1:14:57] so jesus i got can i just read to you
[1:15:00] matthew 11. i gotta just read it
[1:15:02] jesus says
[1:15:04] he says now look
[1:15:06] go

[1:15:09] going to get go and show john again
[1:15:13] those things which she do here
[1:15:16] and see
[1:15:18] he didn't give john just a book

[1:15:23] didn't give him just a church change he
[1:15:25] didn't give him just a letter he said i
[1:15:27] want you to go tell john about the
[1:15:30] manifestation of god in your day
[1:15:34] hallelujah

[1:18:23] jesus began to say to the multitude
[1:18:26] jesus began to ask them what did you go
[1:18:28] out in the wilderness to see
[1:18:30] what did you go out to see do y'all
[1:18:32] really know who john was
[1:18:34] so jesus is dealing with the people that
[1:18:37] are not locked up
[1:18:38] he's dealing with those people on the
[1:18:39] outside
[1:18:41] who want to hear the truth
[1:18:43] everybody didn't want to hear jesus
[1:18:45] maybe he's 31 32 at this time and they
[1:18:48] may not want to hear everything this 31
[1:18:50] 32 year old guy that the city that in
[1:18:52] the synagogue the pharisees saggies have
[1:18:54] not approved of they don't want to hear
[1:18:56] everything he got to say because they
[1:18:57] say he believes that william branham he
[1:19:00] believes that john the baptist ministry
[1:19:02] stuff
[1:19:04] he
[1:19:05] how can he believe all of that
[1:19:07] he said you know has he i mean he didn't
[1:19:10] do no what miracles did he do
[1:19:13] you say did he really fulfill all the
[1:19:14] scripture
[1:19:16] he said no well you know what let's talk
[1:19:18] about his prophecy
[1:19:21] he said he was going to introduce the
[1:19:23] messiah
[1:19:24] you believe he the messiah
[1:19:27] but jesus is there standing
[1:19:29] through the midst of the trial
[1:19:32] he's staying to the midst of the trial
[1:19:35] meanwhile the disciples are running back
[1:19:37] of john to go give the news
[1:19:41] now look
[1:19:42] they were supposed to listen to jesus
[1:19:46] but john still need to hear a word from
[1:19:48] god
[1:19:51] as john
[1:19:52] is still in his trial
[1:19:55] as john is still in his hold
[1:19:59] the bible tells us that
[1:20:02] all they did was depart
[1:20:05] but you know
[1:20:07] if no one stopped those brothers
[1:20:11] they went straight to the prison
[1:20:14] and they went straight to go tell john
[1:20:17] let me tell you what jesus said
[1:20:21] let me tell you what jesus said
[1:20:24] and they could say hold on right there
[1:20:28] the dead are raised john

[1:20:35] cleansed john

[1:20:39] john i got so many pages here john
[1:20:42] there's so many people to report let me
[1:20:44] tell you he said now the blind eyes are
[1:20:46] open john
[1:20:48] john
[1:20:50] the poor have the gospel
[1:20:52] priesthood hold on the poor

[1:21:25] now he knew his lord now he knew that he
[1:21:29] was blessed because jesus said the last
[1:21:32] thing he said blessed is he who is not
[1:21:35] offended in me

[1:26:58] i tell them how
[1:27:00] all of us have to be prisoners
[1:27:02] you're a prisoner to somebody

[1:27:06] and i was telling as he said
[1:27:08] as a prisoner they tell you when to wake
[1:27:11] up they tell you when to go to sleep
[1:27:12] they tell you what to eat they tell you
[1:27:14] what to do
[1:27:15] and you give up all your rights you have
[1:27:17] to do what somebody tells you to
[1:27:19] and i want you to see here i know you
[1:27:21] guys know what it's like to be inmates
[1:27:23] but i'm a prisoner too

[1:27:39] sweet spirit we're in the middle of
[1:27:40] prison y'all or something
[1:27:43] and so then we left the group we walked
[1:27:45] across maybe about 50 yards across the
[1:27:47] prison yard and i remember as a black
[1:27:49] guy white guy standing by the basketball
[1:27:51] court

[1:31:48] church he said that for some strange
[1:31:50] reason that morning he said just a a
[1:31:53] peace came upon
[1:31:55] that i could baptize in the name of
[1:31:56] jesus christ and you know i said you
[1:31:59] know lord he said god will give you and
[1:32:01] do exceedingly and abundantly above all
[1:32:05] you can ask or even think
[1:32:08] according to your faith
[1:32:10] according to your faith and they said
[1:32:12] the brother said of all people that got
[1:32:14] baptized they were the only two god that
[1:32:16] that got baptized by a man that said he
[1:32:18] wouldn't even do it in the name of jesus
[1:32:19] christ
[1:32:20] and i say i said lord this is something
[1:32:23] it's something to see that god still has
[1:32:26] children anyway
[1:32:28] we had a brother that got out of that
[1:32:29] got out of prison and basically
[1:32:32] i had asked a pastor but at home i asked
[1:32:34] him he baptized him and he said he would
[1:32:36] and this and he got sick
[1:32:38] and that suddenly he wasn't there and he
[1:32:39] said brother kyle you can baptize me
[1:32:42] and what happened the guy he it was a
[1:32:44] drug thing he ended up going to prison
[1:32:47] and so now it was like march or
[1:32:49] something it was a sunny morning it was
[1:32:50] so cold
[1:32:51] i knew it was icing that box out back
[1:32:54] and not only did he come he said he said
[1:32:56] macau i got out and i started going to
[1:32:58] my home church
[1:33:00] and he said i asked him would you
[1:33:02] baptize me in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:04] and he said
[1:33:05] he said they said we couldn't do
[1:33:08] and he said someone just i should call
[1:33:10] you
[1:33:11] and see if i can come down
[1:33:13] i said well come on brother talk to the
[1:33:15] pastor we can come on see and get you
[1:33:17] baptized
[1:33:18] so then the sunday morning he was sick
[1:33:20] and this and say well come on not only
[1:33:22] did he come he said his wife came
[1:33:24] his eleven-year-old daughter came
[1:33:27] and he said they got through that got in
[1:33:29] that water and let me tell you they're
[1:33:30] gonna shake you i said oh lord they were
[1:33:33] shaking
[1:33:34] and i said lord isn't this something
[1:33:37] that if god touches someone's heart if
[1:33:39] he touches your heart do you realize
[1:33:42] what god will do for you if you only
[1:33:45] believe
[1:33:47] if you only believe i wish i had time to
[1:33:49] go through all the testimony but what
[1:33:52] touched me in it is that it was a
[1:33:53] brother he's a brother in there you
[1:33:55] would think look at him real dark guy
[1:33:57] gold teeth he was sad he was there and
[1:33:59] he said how he said i started coming he
[1:34:01] said something it's something about what
[1:34:03] you're saying
[1:34:05] and he said he he asked his brother he
[1:34:07] said you ever heard of this william
[1:34:08] branham guy and his brother's a street
[1:34:10] preacher down in uh that back home
[1:34:12] mobile
[1:34:14] and he said he told me he said he said
[1:34:16] no brother brown he said watch you where
[1:34:17] you hear that from he said this guy that
[1:34:19] come from to come to the prison he said
[1:34:22] you should listen to that guy
[1:34:24] he knows what he's talking about
[1:34:28] and he said now here's a prisoner
[1:34:30] he said his he said he said my dad asked
[1:34:33] me my dad asked me can you send me some
[1:34:35] of the books you've been reading in
[1:34:37] prison
[1:34:39] i said lord in this something that you
[1:34:41] say hey my brother one thing i i just
[1:34:44] realized if i go to jail
[1:34:46] i'm still going to hear about brother
[1:34:48] brad
[1:34:49] [Laughter]
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:54] if if i get locked up i'm still going to
[1:34:57] hear about brother brad
[1:34:59] so the question is you free right now
[1:35:02] you have a choice
[1:35:04] the question is do you really believe
[1:35:07] you see because you see the old text is
[1:35:09] everywhere people hear these prophecies
[1:35:11] see you can't put everything in the
[1:35:13] bible together
[1:35:14] people that call themselves christian
[1:35:16] don't have the whole bible put together
[1:35:19] and if you know everything but the
[1:35:21] brethren say you better run from that
[1:35:22] man
[1:35:24] and i want you to see here you see you
[1:35:26] see when you look at prophecy it's the
[1:35:28] oldest trick of the devil you're trying
[1:35:29] to come and try to put together prophecy
[1:35:31] something that even if it's a personal
[1:35:33] prophecy or testimony to you god didn't
[1:35:36] even tell you to look at that
[1:35:39] but that may be for you to share and if
[1:35:42] we believe it's a blessing
[1:35:44] but you see when when isaiah was there
[1:35:46] and he was talking to the king
[1:35:48] and he was sitting there and he said to
[1:35:50] the king he says king i want you to ask
[1:35:52] a sign from god
[1:35:54] and he said give me a sign and he said
[1:35:56] okay he said i don't want to bother god
[1:35:58] he said i don't want to i don't want to
[1:36:00] bother god you know he said but you
[1:36:02] asked people to do this you guys will do
[1:36:04] this but now you want to play the game
[1:36:05] or you don't want to ask god
[1:36:08] he said i'm going to tell you something
[1:36:10] anyway
[1:36:11] so isaiah looked at the king and he said
[1:36:13] i'll tell you what he said a virgin
[1:36:16] shall conceive
[1:36:18] and he said god himself will show you a
[1:36:20] sign
[1:36:22] that king never saw jesus
[1:36:24] that king never met man
[1:36:27] isaiah died
[1:36:29] and they said isaiah went to the tomb of
[1:36:31] a false prophet
[1:36:35] they said hold on where is it show us
[1:36:38] bring it through yeah and show me you
[1:36:40] would be sitting there if you believe
[1:36:41] brother brendan's fault you'll be
[1:36:43] reading your bible and you will stumble
[1:36:45] at the very same thing
[1:36:48] you better be careful how you listen to
[1:36:50] a
[1:36:50] prophecy but i'll tell you something i
[1:36:53] love what brother branham preached he
[1:36:55] said when you receive the holy ghost
[1:36:59] it'll lead and guide you into all truth
[1:37:03] when you get the holy ghost you don't
[1:37:05] know if it's a lie now
[1:37:09] you'll nervous alive now when you get
[1:37:11] the holy ghost
[1:37:13] when you get the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:37:15] god himself can't lie
[1:37:17] i want you to see something hallelujah
[1:37:19] just say hallelujah just as we just code
[1:37:21] we won't want to keep you
[1:37:22] you see what touched me is
[1:37:25] god himself if the sister was singing
[1:37:27] the song he's going to have a breath
[1:37:31] and you see sister the bride
[1:37:33] she's going to be beautiful
[1:37:35] she'll have no spots
[1:37:36] paul said i'll present to you a chase
[1:37:38] verge
[1:37:39] he said we've kept ourselves he says wow
[1:37:42] in the word of god
[1:37:43] he said what to bring you until what the
[1:37:46] very image the very thing of what god
[1:37:49] has been destined to be
[1:37:52] can i read something to you
[1:37:54] i'm gonna read this be finished it says
[1:37:56] this is jeremiah jeremiah he said in
[1:37:58] verse one chapter three they say if a
[1:38:00] man put away his wife and she go from
[1:38:02] him and become another man's shall he
[1:38:04] return to her again shall not that lamb
[1:38:07] be greatly polluted but thou has played
[1:38:09] the harlot with many lovers
[1:38:12] yet
[1:38:13] return again to me said the lord
[1:38:19] what kind of god do we serve
[1:38:22] yet return
[1:38:24] unto me
[1:38:28] hallelujah i always wanted to have
[1:38:31] brother bram in the prayer lines he
[1:38:32] always dealt with that woman after will
[1:38:35] and you think about we know the story
[1:38:38] he had to go by psycho the end he had to
[1:38:41] go by check him
[1:38:43] and he goes by this place by this whale
[1:38:45] about midday and brother brown will
[1:38:47] always talk about how he said before the
[1:38:49] prayer line you hear him always talking
[1:38:51] about this
[1:38:53] and he's sitting there
[1:38:55] and as he's as he's sitting there he's
[1:38:57] waiting on this woman to come
[1:38:59] and he would always use that for some
[1:39:01] reason to contact the spirit
[1:39:06] to contact the spirit
[1:39:08] this woman he's sitting there said come
[1:39:11] and give me something to drink
[1:39:13] who you who you think you are
[1:39:18] dealing with each other
[1:39:20] why are you even talking to me
[1:39:22] and he says
[1:39:25] hold on he said woman if you knew who it
[1:39:27] was
[1:39:31] he says that you would have asked
[1:39:33] me
[1:39:34] to give you something
[1:39:37] he said you mean that
[1:39:38] he said what do you mean he said sir the
[1:39:40] well is deep
[1:39:42] it's a very deep well
[1:39:46] and i don't see no bucket
[1:39:48] where is your bucket sir
[1:39:50] where is your bucket to get water
[1:39:54] what kind of water is this you talking
[1:39:56] about anyway everlasting water
[1:39:59] life you're saying that why bring you
[1:40:00] this water you have everlasting life
[1:40:02] what kind of what are you talking about
[1:40:04] and the woman he says he looks he says a
[1:40:07] woman he said if you only knew
[1:40:10] who was speaking to you
[1:40:12] he says look
[1:40:14] he said look i know
[1:40:16] i don't have no bucket
[1:40:19] but
[1:40:20] you think that the god of your father
[1:40:22] and of jacob you think because i i well
[1:40:25] you don't you don't believe me yet
[1:40:28] yes i gave them that well
[1:40:30] he didn't reveal it all to at once
[1:40:33] he's talking to a contact in the spirit
[1:40:36] trying to give her something better than
[1:40:38] what she thought she had caught
[1:40:41] she thought what she had carly and what
[1:40:43] she needed was all she needed she
[1:40:45] thought that was good
[1:40:47] but jesus wanted to give her something
[1:40:49] better
[1:40:51] this word that we have in this hour
[1:40:54] is for the bride
[1:40:57] it's for the bride it's not for the
[1:40:58] unbeliever
[1:41:00] it's for the bride
[1:41:02] and you see it was it's a special word
[1:41:06] because she knows and she appreciates
[1:41:08] everything that her lord has done for
[1:41:11] her
[1:41:13] she knows that she will be lost without
[1:41:15] it
[1:41:16] she knows that she'd be finished without
[1:41:20] so she doesn't run when she hears
[1:41:22] something that seems a little weird
[1:41:24] but once she does she says
[1:41:26] uh
[1:41:27] faith always says the word of god is
[1:41:29] right
[1:41:31] she sits there a little long
[1:41:33] he said lord i'll just sit and chew on
[1:41:35] it so maybe you'll explain it to me
[1:41:38] so she sits there and he says
[1:41:41] woman the wealth the water i got for you
[1:41:43] you ain't never had water like this she
[1:41:45] said sir i'm tired of coming to this
[1:41:48] well i'm tired of coming to get this
[1:41:50] natural water you said i want if you got
[1:41:53] water like you said you got let me have
[1:41:55] some of that one
[1:41:57] let me have it i would love to have it
[1:42:00] let me see what you got
[1:42:02] so she stopped and and now he don't just
[1:42:05] give it to him
[1:42:07] he has to paul he contact he said he
[1:42:09] looks in her life
[1:42:11] he says woman go get your husband
[1:42:15] before god can move first he's got to
[1:42:17] deal with the sin in your life
[1:42:20] before god can give you all that he
[1:42:22] wants to give you he's got to deal with
[1:42:25] where you are at right now
[1:42:29] he has to and that's what he did he
[1:42:31] contacted her spirit
[1:42:33] and he told her he said go get your
[1:42:35] husband say hey he said whatever you he
[1:42:36] said oh he said i ain't got no husband
[1:42:39] he said woman
[1:42:40] you had five
[1:42:42] the man you went right now is not yours
[1:42:46] and so then he says and i want you to
[1:42:48] say this just as we close i want you to
[1:42:50] just hear this
[1:42:51] he says he's saying he said right now
[1:42:55] i've got something for you but let me
[1:42:57] deal with your life
[1:43:00] so
[1:43:01] he goes past the front door the living
[1:43:03] room and he comes into the bedroom of
[1:43:05] your heart
[1:43:06] and he says do will you really allow me
[1:43:08] to have fellowship
[1:43:11] and this woman she stops and she says
[1:43:14] how how in the world could this man
[1:43:15] notice about me
[1:43:17] because he was the lord
[1:43:20] because he was the lord tonight
[1:43:23] i want to tell you this just in closing
[1:43:25] he contacted her spirit
[1:43:28] because he wanted to now enter in
[1:43:31] he wanted to give her something that she
[1:43:34] never had before so that she would know
[1:43:37] what a real man was like
[1:43:40] so she would know who her true father
[1:43:43] was how she would know what real joy was
[1:43:46] like how she would really know what it's
[1:43:49] all like to be called a bride
[1:43:52] that's what he was doing for
[1:43:54] he said woman you don't even know what
[1:43:56] you're worshiping yes they say you can
[1:43:57] go here and there in that time going
[1:43:59] they said your father they said you said
[1:44:00] go in the mountain my father said go
[1:44:02] worship here he said you say go worship
[1:44:03] in jerusalem but he says to he says her
[1:44:06] woman you don't even know what you're
[1:44:08] worshiping
[1:44:09] right
[1:44:10] you don't even know he don't call her
[1:44:12] name
[1:44:14] he calls who she is
[1:44:16] and he says i want you to catch it as we
[1:44:19] close he says he's contacting her spirit
[1:44:21] tonight if you want god to do something
[1:44:24] for you
[1:44:26] you have to let god enter in and deal
[1:44:29] with your spirit
[1:44:31] and as he deal with your spirit he looks
[1:44:33] down in your heart he looks down in your
[1:44:35] life and you say lord remove all the
[1:44:38] unbelief lord god help me to see cast
[1:44:41] off all the cares of this life and let
[1:44:43] me say oh hallelujah lord use me for
[1:44:46] your glory and lord i'll do whatever you
[1:44:49] have me do
[1:44:50] lord i'll go tell john
[1:44:53] she says here he began to talk to he
[1:44:55] said god is a spirit and those that
[1:44:57] worship god that come to a hotel a
[1:44:59] church in a prison they must worship god
[1:45:02] in spirit and in truth for the father
[1:45:05] seeking such to worship him so he says
[1:45:07] here he says and the woman said but when
[1:45:10] the messiah has come
[1:45:11] he said he should tell us all things
[1:45:14] and jesus said
[1:45:15] it is he who's speaking with thee
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] oh
[1:45:21] ah

[1:53:25] verse 27
[1:53:26] that the spirit of a man is a candle of
