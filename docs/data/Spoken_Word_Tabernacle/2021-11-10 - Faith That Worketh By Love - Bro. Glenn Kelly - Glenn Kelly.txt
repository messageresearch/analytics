pen remember you got a pain right there you better take your pain and use it if we go into the rupture that's it amen this is the time you need the healing this is the time you need deliverance this is the time you need your blessing so this is the time to use your god given right amen and change your life blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen what a traffic on the road but thank god we made it amen blessed be the name of the lord you continue to remember sister rosemary in prayer she made it to kenya without any problem and lord's willing on saturday that we have the barrel so she sent the link for those who want to watch it it's going to be live streaming so lord's willing tomorrow we must send the link so just keep a look on an eye on uh on your text message if it's going to be though we can send the link tomorrow but you have to be streamed on uh on saturday so keep the family in prayer lords willing one more week and she will be back amen yeah my wife is not here tonight taking care of you again amen she's back there with her mother-in-law with her two children amen so somebody out somebody blessed be the name of the lord you keep praying for us for the oncoming meeting lords willing it's going to be next week so keep praying for me so we get the right thing to speak there is a lot of things that we can preach on but we want to have the real mind of god amen yeah i was planning really to preach tonight and i begin to start is something on the lake of fire and it took me into a different direction completely amen so i hope we will have more time on sunday but if you can just if you can just read revelation 12 13 and 14. okay it's only three chapters it's a little bit deeper because they concern the lake of fire but when i tried to get to the lake of fire it took me the boss man changed direction go to revelation 19. yes my brother i get to get everything ready and thank god brother kelly was right there to step on amen always handy revelation 19 verse 20 if you dare you can say amen the bible says and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet thou wrote miracles before him with which he deceiveth he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worship his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with you see now so you got the beast first and the false prophet are cast first into the lake of fire and they are cast because with them before him which the bible say with which he deceived them that have received the mark of the beast and them that worship his image these both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone why is the beast and the false prophet cast first into the lake of fire amen let's go to revelation 15. i'm just giving you clue make your life easy amen the book of revelation you need malachi 4 without any question amen you try to get there you're going to get lost quickly only malachi 4. revelation 15 once we begin to to get into these books people get scared like oh it's scary it's not scary it's actually the book of the bread [Laughter] revelation 15 verse 1 and i saw another son in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having seven last parts you remember that one you remember that in a hotel okay for in them is philip the wrath of god and i saw as he wear a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his and over his and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god and seeing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thou words lord god almighty so they understand that the lamb is lord god almighty so they have a understanding of a deity now just and true or that way is that king of the same so this is the two things that draw me to a different direction so keep that in mind revelation 12 13 14 if we get chance so lord's willing we have to touch on that one before we go to the lake of fire amen so just bear with me i follow the gps amen i can give you what you want but it won't be under the gps i want to stay under the supernatural gps and make sure i'm following because he knows exactly and i have never seen him missed every time he comes you hear somebody saying that was what i was praying for that was what was going on that was telling me it is not me it is the gps amen so keep speaking the right thing keep speaking it loud keep repeating it if you don't have faith yet if you already have faith so continue moving to the right direction amen saying the right thing will pull god down amen abraham believed god he believed number two then he start confessing calling the things that doesn't exist as they do exist then he start praising god for those things that he have not even received yet and then he get into the action and moving on those are the the steps of abraham now you know your step if you need something you know where to get it just get a man bottom sometimes say like a mental attitude you frame your own picture you know that right you know the story about the three boys that were watching uh [Music] a boat you know that story you don't know you don't know how many knows this place okay okay if you don't know let me just tell you there were three boys in their bedroom they had a picture of a boat selling peacefully and every time they woke up they look at the picture they go to sleep they look at the picture they wake up they all came to a picture they go to sleep they look at the picture and after a while there were like four boys if i'm not mistaken all of them went to the navy and they wondered they say what was going on and they found out it was a picture there how can a picture put a profession in somebody's heart a picture moved from the wall got into the heart and when he got into the heart he even gave those boys the endurance and the uh perseverance to go all the way to the navy and read it because their eye was looking in other words the picture was speaking you remember we said a picture worth ten thousand well so when they were looking at the picture he was talking about navy navy navy navy navy navy until the inward man called it like okay it's navy he got them when he got the navy on the heart he flipped the boys and everything the boys are seeing is just navy navy and navy and all of them fulfill exactly that if an image can do that what can do this thing you see amen so when you look at the image that's why paul said it's going to be you'll be transformed into the how you are looking at them you see amen praise be to the name of the lord there is a lot in this message a lot of stuff revealed that can make your life easy so start using it not only hears of the word but also doers of the word amen let's call brother kelly musician already out okay only believe oh believe only believe [Music] all things are possible only building [Music] only believe [Music] only believe all things are possible [Music] only lord i believe lord [Music] oh [Music] lord i believe [Music] lord i believe let us pray lord god we thank you for your grace we thank you for

we give you honor we give you glory so lord jesus they come to hear from you tonight lord god lord god it's the middle of the week father and they've pressed away i know the devil's been fighting them lord god because that's his job lord god but we found out lord god in the scriptures that we are overcomers so he's just a bluff lord god and you were giving us to fight the good fight of faith lord jesus so we thank you lord god we thank you for those father who had a desire to be here was not here tonight lord jesus and lord god remember brother michael's sister rose mary lord god and all those lord jesus that's streaming lord god that love to be here and it's not able but strengthen them keep them father send the word of grace lord god from your throne to my throne to their throne lord

things here in the midst of us father been unfolding your word father so we give you praise we give you honor we give you thanks lord god we know you'll never let us down father so father any demon

god continue to strengthen them so father we give you praise and on and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the lord good to see y'all smiling faces tonight hallelujah hallelujah i thought i heard brother abel around here too huh he's rather able huh i thought that was him i i thought i heard him back there there he is god bless you brother hey amen good to see you we won't prolong the time i know it's wednesday let's turn to um galatians 5. and what you have to say amen and where's read verse six galatians five and six he says for in jesus christ neither avail anything nor uncircumcision but the faith which worketh by love you may be seated here you know i tell you i didn't know about the grace of god which way we were going but uh you know been hearing so much about faith and the lord's been unfolding in the word is that right i'm telling you we should be claiming every promise that's all is that right every promise that that's ours in this hour here now you know he told us it was faith is that right abraham started he said the faith of abraham and then he come and told us it had to be a confession is that right and then after you have told us to be a confession then he said but it had to be a work is that right you see my you know my faith by my works and my works demonstrates my faith is that right so we're in here now we're going to leave here those that come and hear trouble you will leave him victorious tonight is that right because we come the holy ghost is positive is that right when the holy ghost coming in positive we claiming everything that belongs to us in this hour here now now we're going to look into the scripture and we're going to show you it this faith that's in this hour that we're talking about now is controlled by the love of god is that right the agape love not the affiliated love it's a faith that's working by love so i heard the holy ghost say one time that redemption has to come in what for is that right so we come around and then now we're talking about this faith that's working by love we want you to look at this and we're going to take our time and just pray with us by the grace of god the devil fought me all last night and all the days but i'll tell you but we are overcomers is that right greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so we're coming this hour here now we got to understand what god has called us to now i want you to read something here from our prophet and i want you to know in this hour here i see i got the inspiration from the message desperation that's where i got the inspiration from you know it's it's sad to say but most people don't move until they're desperate until they got pressure on them until you have to come in here you know when god likes a humble soul though but that's what most people have to trouble but god showed us suddenly what that you don't have to get weary because you're going through troubles is that right but it's perfecting you it's moving you closer to what the lord has called us to do so we want you to look at his hair by the grace of god and god help me and this is the faith that's worketh by love and love when we know when you're desperate you know it's pain you're extremely pain suffering you're really really desperate to get what you need but what struck me in this message that the prophet of god was working with but he was joe showing us but how this faith is working in this hour here now he had just got finished preaching the token and when he preached that token he came and he was talking about how great that it was a message that god had given him and we know that token is the baptism of the holy ghost is that right we know most of them even in jacob in his time when he swindled esau out of the birthright is that right he thought he was all right at that time but he didn't realize it just began is that right we have to realize now once you receive the baptism of the holy ghost now your battle just begins is that right but you have to understand greater is he that is in thee than he that is in the world we're going to show you that you've got to in this hour here now we have to come but you have to come humbly you got to come to god humbly saints and when you come to him humbly you're going to see by the scriptures what you can receive in this hour here now right so it's too many coming to the confession with dry life confessions that's not going to get it with god is that right you're going to see some of your brothers and your sisters that you're going to see on the other side how they really really suffered and prevailed is that right how they cried out to god because they needed something from god they needed a promise to be revealed to them is that right but look at all that we have you can't get it even in abel's time in abel's time we got to understand you can only get it by what revelation is that right both of them came you got these religious demons that's running around here now because we were bringing you into this hour here now what the lord is bringing his elect into and we're going to show you god chose you you had nowhere you couldn't get out of it god chose you that god chose you to perform a work on here so you have to understand you think that the pastor's love that that wordy some things he's been too hard with or something he's a he shouldn't bring it a certain way the holy ghost be picking up some of your thoughts you gotta get out of your flesh is that right he told you that satan can operate through the flesh by faith and he said you can operate through the spirit through the heart and thy faith is that right so now what we have to understand and it's out here now god is bringing and moving you and getting you ready for that rapture is that right because it's going to be a rapture and i'm going in the rapture we're always looking for the coming of the lord so we should be the happiest people in the world is that right that's why if you go in there one day i'ma show you why they say restore the joy what by salvation why should he have to restore the joy of my salvation some of y'all can keep singing it all you want to i'm going to keep preaching it too because i got scripture to show you what you need to keep your mind on and then he won't have to restore the joy of your salvation [Applause] so you keep doing it because you think the word is false i'll get in trouble i got to be held accountable for what i preach is that right the way he's coming he's moving he's driving his demon forces like the holy spirit said through the pastor he's changing your way of thinking so does a man think of in his heart so is he malachi 4 came to turn the hearts of the children to who the fathers is that right hallelujah look what he said desperation faith that's working by love in this hour here now you know what we want to see perfect love how about perfect love came into the temple and turned them tables over huh thank you jesus how about when he came down in there and they tried to come into the house of the lord is that right no it isn't you've been hiding behind religion too long is that right now god says everything that's hidden he's going to uncover it see so you got to realize every i only die every key going to be crossed he's unfolding all the promises of god in his hour here now when he did what property god said when he called the devil she said what it was a pastor is that right he said when he told him to go get the coin out of their mouth that was the trustee is that right when it came turning over the tables he said that was the anointing of a deacon watch out now you don't want that anointing to get on the beacon sometimes the law started in the church with the deacons you know that huh that's where it started at somebody come in there dick can body slam you put handcuffs on you and call the police he said now look help me lord he said now you look he said desperation when the wife was about to die of cancer now i'm coming out of um paragraph 66 if you're writing them down want to go back and check i'm not trying to hide anything from i want you to know where it's coming from he said desperation he says when the wife was about to die with cancer he knows that god could heal her and if god could heal his wife god can heal the boy and it throws it into the state of what desperation you must come and when you're desperate then god is going to listen to you but if you're just slow fool see what are you coming to church for in the house of the lord for uh oh huh what do we come here for we got to have a purpose what you coming here for worship god to become a better christian is that right i see some of you out there you think you're going to stop preaching you commuted if you want to david i'm just opening my mouth letting it fly tonight you got to understand the thing over this i see some of you with them garbage on huh you think that's a man trying to tell you you know what you're doing you drawing the devil to you you know what i'm saying the devil is looking and seeing that you are void of understanding somewhere you say you void of understanding somewhere so now you bring an embarrassment to who to your family name the lord jesus christ we want to show you about being a christian when you're being a christian it is our god have chosen you before the foundation of the world will try to have peace and live holy without holiness no man shall see god so that's what's on that bible it's a holy bible is that right our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name holy be thy name thy kingdom come so that thy will could be done on earth as it is in heaven don't fool yourself when you grit on them tight garments and your rear in shape like a mule and you're going to come and think you got the holy ghost no you ain't got the holy ghost in there you need to say help me lord don't come in the house of the lord slow food what about a sinner if a sinner coming in and if a sin is struggling and if they're struggling in an area and our men are missing we're going to show you our mission is to win souls to bring them to the kingdom of god i don't know where that came from but it came let me tell you we're talking about now faith that's working by love is that right hallelujah i tell you i'm excited you know that's only a couple of testimonies thank you jesus he said now but if you're just lawful you don't care whether he does it or not then that's different you say to you but it takes desperation to do it look what he said he said i believe this is brother brandon he said i believe the reason we don't have desperation it's because it's a lack of love that's strong ain't it let's see what else he said see the word can't offend the word huh the word can offend the word because we know it's only making us better he said now look he says the lack of love god the love of god i think that the love of god calls his desperation [Music] he said if god is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of the times and the people willing in sin in the way that they are it'll throw you into a desperation let's look at ezekiel 9 let's go to ezekiel 9. amen hallelujah lord have your way ezekiel time four and seven ezekiel nine let's look at verse 4 he says and the lord said unto him go go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof he says unto the others he said in in in my hearing go ye after him he says through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity see we're talking about we're wrestling not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places we got 200 million demon forces out there and those demon forces if you're ignorant to them if you're just trying to walk by the letter you can forget it you won't defeat satan in his trickery because he told us to put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to withstand against the wiles and the trickery of the devil is that right so we have to understand in this hour here now that god is preparing getting his bride by what opening his word is that right with understanding see when he start opening the word with understanding this is your glory the end your and and your word is part of your inheritance that's being opened up to you now we're saying that brother steve i tell you i won't mess with it but i'll tell you i was tempted to go in there and look at some of them clouds but i ain't gonna forerun the pastor and i'll tell you when they got around in there you start running clouds through there is that right when you start running clouds through that i didn't see the one in in um psalms 133 oh how sweet and beautiful that it is to brothers to dwell together in unity is that it come down in there you could just see that cloud you could see christ you could see that hoffman head you could see that anointing you could see the revelation of anointing i mean you can see the revelation of um of unity or mainly among the brethren and that's why we come and we we say we pray for one another we hold one another up in prayer when god bring them to our heart in in prayer we're family saints let me keep going i don't want to get to get behind because i got my timer up here he said now look hallelujah he said in verse 7 it says and he bought me no verse seven he says and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city what we're working now we're talking about in this hour out here now you and i now we got our brothers we got our sisters bound up with these demon forces out here in that world they're struggling but we're going to show you a faith that's working by love if you guys bear witness he already showed us you got to have the faith of abraham and then you confess your thoughts one to another is that right and after you confess to confess your faults one to another i'm gonna show you what the prophet of god said here he says now the word plainly states if you want to put this down galatians 5 and 6 faith worketh by love he says faith worketh love and the only way that you can have faith is to have love first beginning to see how simple it is god hidden in simplicity and revealed the same way he said now he said because after all faith is love's incentive let it sink in that thing is simple but it's powerful he said he said that's in sinner i'ma hit some of y'all now what is your incentive i'ma stop the impulse what is your incentive is your incentive are you more excited when it's time to go to work are you a more regather your incentive motive is there when it's time for you to what eat see if you're incented but it's time for you to be entertained what is your incentive your spirit see that's what drives you control your nature is that right they have to you have to realize what is that incentive that's driving you instead of having a desire to read your bible having a desire to pray having a desire to pick up the cod book he's not just telling your pastor just not telling you these things just to tell you he's sharing these things with you because down the road what did he say up on that board on sunday he said it's a pressure that's going to come and when that pressure come you'll be ready you see you're going to be ready for it we're not backing up off of no devil we taking everyone and we're not losing a hoof is that right so your incentive should be with the gift that god put inside of you what did god put inside of you whatever you do without looking for a reward if it just comes to you naturally go pray that's what god put in you to do you just it just comes naturally the holy spirit told us suddenly more i don't know why i'm going this way but i'm going the holy spirit just told us this sunday morning he said because that desire that's in your heart is that right with that desire to live in his heart you can't get rid of it you didn't put it there is that right that's what the lord told us so now you have to realize daddy mama sister brother when you recognize someone that loves you is struggling in that area somewhere somebody's seen that behavior you understand what i'm saying somewhere someone's seen that behavior in that life so now you got to pray against that thing you pray until god come and reveal him to you he's going to what deliver you from that he's still with me i think brother branham preached the message before he left the scene first faithful works worked for works faith work you know i'm talking about that message that he preached the word thank you brother works is faith expressed if he's that in 65 right around let me keep going because i don't want to rush past this see there's no way you can have this kind of love without the baptism of the holy ghost there's no way you can't even love your life that's a high calling when he said love your wife as christ loved the church how are you going to love your wife that christ loved the church if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost in your life that's why when it came he preached that token it was heavy on his heart because he's seen now in his hour here now you wouldn't be falling apart he said that's what happened to him when jacob jacob thought he was all right is that right but it just began the fight just began and then he got to begin he knew that he knew in this hour here now i mean in his time esau was going to come and get him is that right well it's the same thing with us in our time you've been justified justified what does justified mean to a denominational person someone looking in and they can say oh yeah a visitor looking in they can say oh yeah justification justification yeah we got that no no no no our revelation of justification you never did it is that right you never did it what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus so now you've been sanctified filled with the holy ghost is that right we know now once you've got the holy ghost now when the battle begins for you is that right so you must receive ye the holy ghost and now once you have it it will demonstrate what your life your life will change you'll know them by their what fruits is that right of faith that's working by love let it sink in self-examining time some of you're ripping and running and you in and some of them out there people all confused you know what you need to do and then shooting then they want to throw darts they want to throw darts this way i love you brother i appreciate you brother jesus said pray for your enemy love your enemies pray for those that despitefully use you do good to those that do evil to you you guard that anointing you make your love circle just bigger is that right you make it bigger because we're going somewhere we're going places is that right god is unfolding the word because you're hungry for the word that's in the scriptures now we're talking about faith now we understand what that faith of abraham is that right now we come about what confession is that right we got to confess those things next and then and now and so what it's a work that demonstrates your faith and the work that he's calling for us is the love of god it comes through humility you see it comes through humility reverence especially preachers too he told him when isaiah was in the message influence he said he had the six wings remember he said he had to have the two to put on on on his eyes okay reverence he has two two uh for his feet humility reverence and the other two he had to do with put him in what service is that right so even you got to be put in you have to have those designs you got to have those characteristics before you start talking about doing the work of the lord people who are are examining your life let me keep going help me lord he said now look he says after all faith is love and sinners it says incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love he says now you if you don't have love you can't have faith he says so now you say what let's turn over to uh first corinthians 13. hallelujah faith that worketh by love i read i read over that for years god anoints things when he wants to anoint when god's ready to bring something it's his time they want the spoken word someone cried about spoken word spoken word yeah we got a spoken word wait on the holy ghost you can't speak the word on your own huh you got to wait on the holy ghost jesus said i do nothing unless the father tell me is that right he said i'm about my father's business he went over to martha and and joseph was asking come running where you been where you been he said i've been about my father's business is that right they're looking for him at the passover and then he would they probably wouldn't have to pass over traditionally jesus jesus was about his father's business is that right we're talking about the scriptures in there hallelujah faith that workers by love look at first corinthians 13. he says though i speak with tongues of men and of angel it had not charity i become as what sounding brass or a tinkling symbol he says and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and i have not what charity i'm what now you see where brother brandon was getting this from he said now he's and i look and and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing charity suffers long you see and it's kind see in charity if not i get around there all that worry all that work that's coming around there now in me brother my prayers is with you and buying every demon for us when i pray that come against you no man can't unfold those things it has to be christ back on the scene again unfolding his word let me keep going he said look envy not charity born if not itself not puffed up do if not behave itself unseemly seek is not her own it says it's not easy provoked think it's no evil you get around that you do some parenting you know the hardest thing for us was raising our children was to make a judgment decision we know what was right we knew what was wrong but sometimes you had to go to him and say well you know son daddy didn't make the best judgment decision on that you know forgive me and you're back in the middle road with your children because they already love you they just want you to tell them the truth hallelujah help me lord he says rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in what the truth bear for all things believing for all things hope all things and do it for all things charity what never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish he says for we know in part and we prophesize in part he said but when that which is what i think they desire to say that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be what done away see that's why god had to send malachite for luke 17 30 revelations 10 revelations 19 he had to come wide to tie in all the loose sins and unfold those mysteries to us it was the son of man getting it from the son of man is that right the son of man come down and was bringing it down to him is that right huh he came in when he broke those seals and he came and he came with those ages ain't no seal as you hear the pastor saying it's a new book you see because those things that was hidden in there now he's making it known to us through his precious bride let me keep going he said look let me go back to this here faith worketh by love he said now you if you don't have love you can't have faith see how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her he said that's that's in philly he said now how about the agape to god how can it be if you don't love if you don't love god he said now look help me lord he says don't he says don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you if you do love her you express it tell your wife you love her tell her how pretty she is tell her how you appreciate her oh honey rest your legs you know you you you you share those things don't let the fire die out it gets sweeter and sweeter the same as you walk with christ as he continued to unfold himself you get humble and humbler and humbler is that right look what he says he said that's the way we do to god he said when we love him we tell him about it we sat down and we adore him and worship him and see love drives us to that he says now you know he says now now you look here he says and that's the same thing that it is we must love we must have love before we can have faith we have genuine love what does it do it pushes faith it pushes our faith out into the battle front of god he said in the battlefront of god genuine godly faith love for god and for his word and for his people will push faith out there what about david in first samuel 17. when david was in there and his daddy told golden to check on his brothers when he was out there and look at david and david was then i'm paraphrasing it you can go to first samuel 17 and look at it i got too many scriptures to determine but david knew down inside he had the love for israel and god's people and his for and his brethren and so david what did he do david ran towards the battle after he heard goliath boasting his words is that right if the words it was enchanted the words that we're battling that's why the lord been telling us about the mouth the tongue you got to have faith you speak those things by faith and you expect it to come and pass building up your most holy faith doing what praying in the holy ghost [Music] i don't know why he's going this way but i'm just following him he says you look he said so god loves his word is people and love just takes hold of faith it say come on let's go we got the victory god said so see but when you're desperate when you when when you become desperate and just bear with me i want you to see some of these scriptures how they operated when they got desperate it's too many of us letting our children struggle with certain things you mean if your child is struggling with something you can't stand in the gap you got the love that's your child and god has given you the authority what you buying on earth shall be buying in heaven what you loose on earth they'll be loose in heaven what is your incentive what is your motive he said now look he said look what john said john 14 he said jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my what my words now you can keep his words without without you can't keep his word without having faith in what he said so you see if he loves god then he keeps god's word he said if he said i am the lord that heal of thee he believes that love makes him what believe it he said because love dominates all see he says thou he says thou i speak you call the pastor and you can't get him what's his voicemail say about love he knows that he knows the scriptures he knows why you think he put it on his phone just to be putting it there no he's dropping the seed on you the demon the devil can't even get through that he says now god then he keeps god's word if he said i am the lord that heal of thee he believes that i'm the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases does thou believe it now what love pushes us out there right because god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so now all you're doing is claiming it you're professing these things what god said any illness any diseases when i first started i feel great up here now some of you heard my voice when i first started the devil fought me all last night he fought my body he me cold he's trying to sing cold out on my body but i'm compressing lord thy god you're the you're jehovah raphae you're the lord thy god the hill of all night diseases lord i stand on your word because you said you love me you said we are overcomers you put the love that pushes the faith that's all out there you think i wasn't gonna be tested i had to be tested too what i'm preaching he came right at me he don't care he don't care done about it you ain't getting no sleep you ain't gonna sleep you gotta preach well i'm gonna mess with you as much as i can huh but what greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world is that right when the enemy come in like a flood he will lift up the mighty standard against it hallelujah he said look what he says he says the lord that heal is deep he believes that see love makes him believe it let's sink in because now that's what the holy spirit is working he's working on that heart so if a man think of in his heart the holy spirit come around in there what about that shooter what about that shulamite man holy spirit told us about what he started down here at this level down here at the cardinal mind of faith he said then it moved up to another level of faith spiritual he said then it moves up to a vision is that right he said paul testified i no longer he said i pray that you come into knowledge in the wisdom of the lord jesus christ he moved up to another level you know what the holy spirit told us this sunday morning come on saints the satan done heard it now is that right he's going to fight you every way he can to stop you from getting to that level but desperation when that sister raised her baby according to the will of the lord she raised that baby and she got there and he had a social disease and that social disease that he had she knew wasn't that she had right to go to garden because she was desperate now but it was love that drove her it was love that drove her it was love that drove her her side that's my child uh i raised him to according to the word of the lord you can have them satan claim your children claim your grandchildren claim your father claim your mother it's love that's driving you to do that [Applause] look what she said possums huh all night she was desperate she stayed up she didn't even have what we have [Music] she was a true believer brother branham said after mountain transfiguration when they came down and they said what they casting out devils in your name they hear him in your name now what did jesus say he said let them be if they're not against us they let them before us he said let them be what was wrong with the disciples he said they were jealous [Applause] he turned the prophet of the hour he was able god showed her what a vision she went to that level when he came there she described possums walking up that road how do you know i was the apostles and how you know i was bothered she knew why because god showed you i don't think that was the only time she went up to that level neither i bet you she was familiar with getting up in there at a desperate time many times at night when you lay in there and your child and your hearts get heavy and you know your heart is heavy and you concerned about your child you can say lord i need comfort lord will you just come and comfort me lord that my child is alright lord you can sigh and you can cry because why you got the message of the hour we got christ in the midst you are his bride the word look what she did she didn't do that she brought the word of the hour to her house huh ain't that what the holy spirit said of sunday what did he say brother steve we pray is that right elijah prayed and said blind their eyes father yeah what more can we ask for isn't that right some of you that's pressing your way out and you gotta go get out there on the road all you can say is lord give me strength father because i come father i made it into the house of the lord tonight i come to support your work lord jesus so lord you can ask him to give you strength you can ask him to touch your body you can ask him to give you the amount of hours that you need resting we serve a supernatural god we serve a resurrected god go around there and say what brother steve i'm just catching the mind of god now you go around there and say brother yeah i heard brother steve preach that brother you think what you bringing across that pool pit i don't go out there and preach it huh because i know it's not you huh [Applause] huh you think i don't go out there and preach it why because god showed me a long time ago the hidden things belong to god deuteronomy 29 is that right he said the hidden things belong to god he said what is revealed is what is mine it's my message now i'm looking forward to produce it's just like elijah said i want to see the same god of elisha [Applause] [Music] hold on little bride don't get discouraged hold on we got a promise is that right god who's what rich in mercy what did he say huh see how valuable you are huh he took it back from adam ah holy ghost said he took it back from adam the devil thought he was getting it but an abstract title d had to go back to god he told you the book huh but when it's time to stand on it it's going to be bigger but don't worry about it you got all heaven on your side [Music] what god's bringing you that's ours now god opened that book for us i saved the best wine for last yeah he said look let's give him a clap off it [Applause] help me lord he said look it's now you know look at john 14. he said now jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my word i'm dropped down he says we know it is true that god will meet a desperate soul you don't have to fear anything we know we don't move from believing we know that god will meet a desperate soul if god said that a woman you should not be on fruitful or burn then you get ready to have your child you desiring a child then you get ready huh start setting it up huh start moving forward don't listen to the doctor i went to the doctor the other day to get around there i guess my wife she just hit me like oh i got in there we went in and i got in there we went to a doctor and he was telling us about the kidneys and different things and the level that it was at and he was there saying you know it won't get any better things just stay right there at that level so wait a minute doc i don't agree with that i said it wasn't her time to die and they got the records in augusta georgia in the hospital and he rose her up again don't tell me he can't make a kidney don't you tell me that because why it's a faith that's working by love that's exactly right see now you speak the word when that time came and we were sitting there and we were sitting there and we was in that hospital and that doctor and that nurse and they came in there and they said sit down here mr kelly i said yeah he said you know your wife passed away i said okay he said did you hear what i said i said i heard what you say see this my getting ready i was already ready he was already inside of me he didn't tell me anything that she was going anywhere [Applause] we got to understand the grace and mercy of god and i said doc i appreciate the hospitals i appreciate the nurses i appreciate the equipment i said but you're going on back there and i said you let me know when i could come come come back to me and i could talk to him and he was all there in that emergency room laying when i went back there i said honey they said you know we were taught subconsciously you could still here said said honey everything is going to be okay cause jesus is in control i'm boasting in jesus you should have seen them fall away from me all i've seen was demon forces saying this man is crazy you see because when someone is sitting up some of you nurses sister fanny and some of y'all know that someone is sitting up after a thyroid storm in three days and ready to eat something glory be to god [Applause] don't tell me about my resurrected god huh don't tell me what our god can do you pray for your children god's gonna tell your children loose hold on little bride your love is what's driving you [Applause] [Music] look what he said he says we know it's true he says god will meet a desperate soul he says now we all know that but it usually takes something to drive us into that to despair desperation it takes something to do it he says we find out in james 5 15 he says the fervent prayer of a righteous man does what a veil is much when the righteous said good man it gets travailing you see he says but when a soul gets travailing you see remember hannah they thought hannah was drunk didn't she but hannah you look at these you look at each one of these ones we're going to look at some scriptures we're running good but i want you to see but they was not in desperation for themselves it was not for themselves because i'ma read to you at the end we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're going is that right so we could tell them about the goodness of the lord jesus christ is that right someone is out there troubling his many souls out there we shining and crying for the condition of the land saints here god is fully taking care of us first he's unfolding his word to us he's meeting all of our needs here and then you think the trustee just asked you made that statement sunday just to be making that statement no you're cutting off your blessing cutting off your blessing we're going to show you about that shooting mike woman in a minute you cutting off your blessing hallelujah anyhow he said now look he said now look my wife said i need to smile more i'm trying to do better i'm trying to be better he said now he said notice what the bible says he also he says confessing our faults getting right making ready for it confess our faults one to another it is having asked people to pray for you confessing our faults one to another and praying one for the other there you are this is instructing too from god to us saints god is building the church you're teaching these young children you're teaching them about praying you're teaching them about reading their bibles is that right that's why he's raising up some is going to be ministers we don't know what god's going to call them to do but god has blessed you to be in the praise in a place with no schism he said now look he says and praying for one another there you are he says we love that see we love that i got confidence i can confess you my wrong and you can confess me you're wrong and i love you enough that i'll pray for you and you pray for me ain't that what you told me that they went back there brother john one day said but tell me if you love me pray for me that's exactly what he said look what the lord is doing in here look what the lord is doing here huh huh the lord is doing some great things in here huh bro john you got away from the grunt job and even god sent you some help didn't he hallelujah look what he says he says now he says that we say that if affection fervent prayer until it's it's answers he said that's desperate he said that's what we we should have let me show you something here by the grace of god turn it over to um what is the first kings chapter four nowhere is that he said first kings chapter was the first king just i think it might have been second kings second king saints hallelujah second kings chapter four and let's look at this shooting mike woman so we should always be we should be saying just what she's saying let's look over there we're familiar with the story here shooting my woman here they got there and she was oh her and her husband but she recognized the prophet of god she recognized he was a man of god and she recognized him being a man of god coming down through there she would um feed him give him something to drink and and and take care of him and then she even build him a place with a little room on it on the side of our house gave him a table gave him a can newt in there she recognized he was a man to god and gahaziah when he he recognized the prophet of god wanted to do something for him if he wanted to do something for him he says well um gahesha said they don't have any children he said well he was speak the word then is that right he went and he spoke the word and he said that they should have a year from now and that season they should have a child so now let's look here what happened along the way let's look at verse nine you start at verse nine he says and she's and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is a holy man of god which passes by us he says and uh drop down to uh i'll tell you what we for the sake of time help me lord let's go to verse 16. he says and he said about this season according to the time of shall embrace a son and she's named my lord thou man of god do do not lie unto my handmaid and the woman conceived and bear a son at that season and elias elijah had said unto her according to the time of life and when the child was grown it fell it fell dropped down to verse 21 and she went up and laid him on the bed of that man he said we know the story that he passed away and brother branham said he had a stroke and he believed it was a stroke that he had he says and he and said and called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the who the man of god and come again and say and he said where there thou go he says that day it is neither near moon new moon sabbath she said it shall be what well he said now he says then when you look he said this shall be well she got a dead son she got a dead child ah and she said this should be well and you maybe got a little finance trouble and you worry you got a little illness and you worry you maybe got car trouble and you worry you're looking for a place to stay and you're worried and you're looking for a job and you worry and her child has died it's dead and she said it is well is that right it is well it is well with my soul it is well let me finish let me keep reading i'm going to show you [Applause] hallelujah he says now verse 24. then she sat her in ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not by writing for me except i bid thee so she went and came unto to the man of god when we're at mount carmel you know you got to go pull up mount carmel don't have to get in time and all that but you see if you pull it up you'll see what happened other things happen on mount carmel he says and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off he said gahaziah is serving behold jonah the shooter might he said run now i pray thee to meet her and said unto her it is well with thee it is well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she said answer is what ah why when you come in here into the house of the lord and you know you've been troubling all day and i made it to the house of the lord it is well i'm getting the word my need is going to be met done i come and expecting a word from the lord it is well because he promised with two or three were gathered in my name i will be in the midst of it it is well whatever you ask you can receive it is well we should be the happiest people now you see why so restore unto me the joy of my salvation you know what i told my wife if the lord called me home two ways we got to go home by the way the graves sometime or he gonna call me in the rapture you know what i told him i said oh it's time to go to those organizations denominations going home service they sing that old same song i won't complain i said don't sing no song like that for me huh that's the door huh that's a joyful time honey out of this pest house no more worries no more headaches no more problems no more they hand them in she's resting she's waiting on her children to come she's waiting on you if you ever go on the other side she could want to come back anyway no way you want to come back to this [Music] it is well he said look he said that she said well he said she said it is well help me lauren and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the what remember this love it has to come through what humility and reverence and it's coming through humility and reverence is because it's for you know what it takes because it's not for yourself you look you'll see it's always for someone else then the prophet of god say that we what he said we know he said we don't live for ourselves we sin here to live for others because it is well with our soul it is well we know where we're going we got eternal life is that right hallelujah help me lord he said now look at when she came to the man of god to the hill get hazy i came in and him by by the feet but the hazy i came to the dresser and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is what vexed within her and the lord had to hid it from me and have not told me see if you're going to even brother brandon was talking about she wanted to know what was going on and he wanted to know also because neither one of them knew at the time is that right god don't always show his servants everything he said then she said that i desire of my lord did i not say do not deceive me now what's she doing huh i'm just paraphrasing it now why you giving me that child pastor i didn't ask for that child you say you're gonna give me a child she would bring it right back to him the one that spoke it and spoke the blessing she turned right around if it was he saw it right back to him why because she know that she can get him to go back to god and raise that child back up again that's what she says he said i i told you don't deceive me i didn't want that child he said then he said to get his eye going up thy lawrence take my staff and thy hand and go thy way i'ma jump down to 30 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and thy soul liveth i will not do what leave thee and he arose and followed her see we're not going anywhere we're not leaving this message because we are the message we're written episcopal's right upon oh man is that right when god tells you to speak you're going to speak he said you get in a situation take no thoughts to what you're going to say i'm going to put the words in your mouth we wait on thus say the lord we can't push thus say the lord we wait on thus say the lord look what he said help me lord verse 32 and when elisha was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went and therefore shut the door upon twain and prayed unto the lord and when he went up and laid up the child and did what put his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon his hands and he stretched them upon the child and the flesh of the child was what waxed warm and then he returned and walked into the house to and fro and went up and stretched him upon him and the child sneezed seven times and what did it drop down the verse um uh um well you know 36 36 and he called gahesa and said call this shooter might so he called her and when she was coming to him he said he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his right feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out them hallelujah she what she spoke the word he spoke the word she spoke the words she said all is well never not seen the man the man of god all is well we got the message of the hour all is well uh we gonna jump a little bit help me lord let's look around in here um god god help me just look over there turn to look at something in the new testament let's go to mark 5. hallelujah oh glory be to god said look at here he said now we look at the two we we look at the two miracles he says and we're talking about a faith that's working by love but it comes by reverence and humility he said them he says and when jesus was passed over again by the ship and to the other side and he was not yeah and and behold there come the rulers of the synagogue jurors by name and he's he saw him and fell where at his feet reverence how do we come into the house of the lord what's your cause for coming here are you coming expecting something from the lord or you're coming just to be coming there is a need when i come to there i come for a need i need to become a better christian each time i come through the door he said now look he says and besotted greatly saying my my little daughter alive at the point of death he said i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her and she be healed and she and shall live and jesus went unto him much people followed him and and thronged him he said let's drop down to he said now look verse 27 he says when he had heard of jesus came into the press behind and touched and touched his garments now remember he done here he this way he performed two miracles from jairus's daughters and it comes from the woman but each time i'm showing it here they came in reverence they came in humility they came knowing that they was going to get something from god but it wasn't for themselves you see the woman knew she came even the woman with the issues of blood she knew at the time there she had been struggling for 12 years she wanted to go in the house with the lord and worship you can't go in the house of the lord and worship like that you see so she knew that she heard about the miracles of jesus oh if i can just touch the hem of their garments is that right oh if someone is watching your life and you're on your job and they're watching you and they're watching you and they're watching you i'm telling you sooner or later they'll come to you privately when the issue come in their house when they have situations they're going to ask you to take it to your church bring it to the church bring it to the pastor and pray for them we have a sister i was telling brother steve we had to go to a funeral wednesday uh sunday and we then i worked with her sister she was the only lady on the um on on the team on the maintenance team and she was there and i and i tell you she well anyway she was the only woman on the maintenance team and when you get around in there and and so we was there we lived that we lived the life before by the grace of god we worked together for seven years and her husband he got a rough fellaini did two years in prison she knew that their prison ministry we did two years in in in prison and they got around they're drunk and they got the blessing but anyway something happened and um after it there he came out they got back there together but then he left her and she was working two full-time jobs and she's working two full-time jobs but i didn't cut her any slack i was firm on her i was real firm i always practice the three f's fair friendly and firm affair when you're supervising people you listen to them you always listen to them can't be a good salesman unless you listen and then friendly you tell them what you're going to do in a situation and you firm you keep your word and you do it when we got over there so she called and i told my wife i said miss so-and-so left a a message on the phone she said well it's all right honey go ahead and call her back so i let my wife know i was in the car so i called her and i called her she said and and and and on the message she always called me her sister i had and i was hard on her and i'm saying this because i want you to hear this because she no longer there i'm no longer there if god help me y'all give me a minute and and then i can show you what the lord did and how you doing this is your daughter jackie when you get this message give me a call all right bye bye and she called and i left that on me i just always witnessed to her husband and when i witnessed to her husband he was in the hospital and she told me he was in the hospital and she didn't know that i was going to go up there i said okay thank you for telling me and they've been and they've been separated for three years and when she got over there went up there he was in icu and we was there and the nurse was there and i said well how's he doing she said who are you i said i'm just one of his christian buddies he said oh then i can't tell you and i said okay i just want to pray for him and we got there and i prayed with him and you know the lord teaches us subconsciously they can still hear so i was made sure except that christ asked the lord to forgive him for anything that he's done his wife and them has accepted the lord jesus christ save it pray for him pray for the nurses and everyone was there i went back wednesday and when i went back wednesday i waited and waited something told me something that happened well he he transitioned over but so i called his wife when i got in touch with his wife and she said oh you went up there and prayed with him i said yes ma'am she said i went up there tuesday i didn't know she went she said when i went up there i asked him to forgive me she said anything that i had done she said i'll forgive you she said if you hear if you hear me he said blink your eyes and he blinked his eyes and that's why and that's what with the testimony they wanted to share how you don't give up on anyone when you're out there that's why we say you're living the life before someone is out there you live that life and god will allow you and it's been seven years that that we worked there together and that's why she said she really wasn't my daughter but i treated her like a daughter i was firm on her and she knew that because in this hour here now there's so much going on but it's so many souls out there but i just wanted you to see that god help me he said lord help me hallelujah well let me see who's we at lord jesus let's look around here help me lord and we're about to come to it we're about to come too close we're talking about we want you to see just look over here in in in luke let's turn to luke 17 and we got over there to luke and we want you to see all these souls what they did they had the love of god in their hearts and let's look at the uh there are 10 leopards in verse 11 it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria in galilee and as he entered into this shitarian village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off he said and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on me and when he saw them he said go show yourself unto the priests he says and it came to pass that as they went we're cleansed he says in one of them where he saw that he was healed he said turn back with the loud voice that's right brother a loud voice he turned back with a loud voice doing what glorifying god thank you [Music] thank you jesus he wasn't ashamed he said he said and fell down on his face at his what at his feet and give one what thanks and he was a what a samaritan and jesus answered and said we're not the tens but but where where's the other 9 see he's saying in verse 19 and he said unto him arise he said and go thy way thy faith have made thee whole we know over there in revelations we're 19 when he fell down there at the feet of brother branham and he told him why he said but i'm just your brother but they just wanted to reverence him is that right and musicians y'all can come forward if i want to read this last one and then that's it hallelujah i want to read this here out of the smyrna age they want to show you sometimes when you come give me five minutes thank you jesus over there this is the smyrna church age and it says now we know that our age they're blind miserable wretched naked and rich of good and say they don't need god but god has promised us that we're going in the rapture he promised us that he's going to have a bride not a spider blemish he didn't have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying is that right he said now but this desperation said to this age is most evidently tribulation with the tribulation in the first he says age there is nothing predicted in intensified tribulation throughout the second he said there is no doubt but what the following words of paul applied to the mass christians were in the world in every age you can go to hebrews 10 and 32 he says but call to remembrance the former days in which after he were illuminated he says now i'm gonna drop down he says for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyful of spoil of your goods he said now you look he says now the lord uh now the lord almighty says i know there he's walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock he says now he says i know i know your tribulations i'm not all unmindful of your suffering see he said he's not unmindful of it he's moving as the holy spirit told us this morning he's moving you into maturity he says what a stumbling block this is so many people like israel they wonder if god really loved them he says how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffering now remember that's when the satan tactics especially women that get by himself he always tell them that god don't love you people don't love you he's a liar he says wherefore thou has love see he says was not esau jacob's brothers he said the lord ye have loved jacob and i hated who esau and laid his mountain and i laid his mountain and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness he said they could not figure out what god's love he said they thought that love meant no suffering he said they thought that love meant that they thought that love meant a baby with their parents who care he said but god said that his love was what elective love that's right brother sam his love was elective love you have been elected by god you have been chosen by god he said now look the proof of his love is what election ah look how simple it is see how simple it is he said he said no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto what salvation why do you have to restore the joy of the bride's salvation when you have been chosen and elected by god for salvation amen we're trying to bring you into something when that script if you pull that scripture up when brother branham used that scripture when when it was there in there is when that fellow came there on that platform and when he came on that platform and you look at you pull it up he got god between him and that man that was that come in there and was spinning his face all he said was lord he knew he needed to get god between him and that man so that he wouldn't speak something harmful on that man you understand why that why that that that song was in there no that scripture was there for that point in that message can't remember the mess i think it was in the breach under brother steve i think it might have been the breach y'all could check in and see him could pull it up and see why he said that hallelujah god hallelujah help me lord i got about two minutes and we got it he says no matter what happened his love was proven by the fact that we're chosen unto salvation because god have chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he says he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffer as he did job he said that is his pr his prerogative that's right brother sam he is sovereign but it is all with a what purpose and he says he that's right brother steve always he did not have a purpose then he would not offer a frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us i'll stop there i believe we got the point help me lord hallelujah let us bow our heads thank you lord thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you father we know it was a lot said saints but if you just need prayer whatever right where you at you can just raise your hand and we'll pray god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you lord god you've seen the hands lord god you know all things father lord god i pray father i said nothing to

lord god the hands went up father let their faith work by love increasing their lives lord jesus let them claim every promise lord god that you have for them let them lord god continue to humble their self lord god reverence to the word of god lord god reverence to the word let them recognize it's not a man father because he said that the prophet of god said the hardest thing for another human being to do is to follow another man but paul also said follow me as i follow christ lord god because you said all scriptures are written by the inspiration of god lord god we thank you for our precious pastor brother polycarp lord god and the deacons the trustees lord god the laity the musicians the song leaders lord god and all that you're doing in the midst of us here lord god just let

come across their path lord god because you called us we we read just in your word because we are the elected so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory thank you for all that you're doing in this building and thank you for those that's going to come lord god continue to allow us to operate in the spirit of faith that worketh by love thank you lord god in jesus name we pray amen amen brother steve [Applause] let's stand faith that worketh by love amen so now you know it's faith you have love you have confession and you got work you got the whole package and the holy spirit didn't want you to miss one amen he brought one a greatest element the capstone itself amen which is faith that is working by love and that love comes by the holy spirit you know that right it's in romans 5 5. amen blessed be the name of the lord i'm just going to read it romans chapter 5 verse 5 and hope make us not ashamed amen because of the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us that loves come from the holy ghost take no thought because the holy ghost everything the holy ghost so if you got the holy spirit you should take care of everything amen so keep believing and one thing i will insist keep praying and keep confessing we need prayer more than anything amen the devil is fighting left and right but greater is in him that is in us than he that is in the world amen you know the word god gave you have a power over every thing that the devil will bring on you amen just the word god gave you you might not realize it but god knows exactly what he is giving you amen and what is giving you is actually built it's like god already pre-built god can never put a message in this end time without tested the material amen if they would have put luther in this age we will be in trouble because justification you cannot stand in that level of luther today amen because we see lutheran today look where they are we see pentecostal today look where they are we see methodists today we see presbyterian there is nobody they can't get control over what is coming up in the world there is only one message that has been predestinated fit built prepared built for this age it's only the message of william marion amen i can't tell you enough you've seen people that left the message go see them go see them not me just go see them amen they thought if the back from the message they leave the message the backup of the message they're going to stand it doesn't work we try they try before you know it somebody's in the paint somebody's indeed somebody's in this somebody because they didn't understand the spirit of laodicea amen the whole hell the lead of hell has been opened up that's why brother branham said in 63 when he went in just a penny he saw that coming as a from there from the water escalador coming up he said i saw this in hell he said hell is on earth amen if hell is on earth what else do you need you need heaven on earth amen but not only hell came down came up here but heaven also came down amen and when the heaven comes down what does it bring to you a book why why why are they bringing you a book [Music] why didn't the mighty angel bring something different why didn't he come up with maybe a baby or maybe a car or maybe a house or coming down from heaven and say this is your house amen he came with a book that book contains everything that you need amen amen it is the book of redemption oh my god and not only even not just a a a a book an open book that's why you heard john say give me the book not please may i have the book he was talking to god how can you talk to god and you say give me the book and god said no you take it amen so originally god never even want to keep the book originally he never even want to keep the book to begin with because brother branham said he was the god of the universe and command was the god of the earth and the earth was given to man as a domain so if god is giving you a domain if you're giving me a house that is paid off um i need to see the title d i'm not i'm not just gonna go in the house and then tomorrow somebody will come and say show me the paperwork this is not your house get out no i need to see the title of thee amen god created everything finished took man put him there and say you in charge take the book easy clear amen but the book could be taken back to adam and he came back again now bringing the book not sealed an open book now take it again but this time don't just take it don't just hold it like this you remember on sunday when you eat the book you and the book become and then what happened the anointing drop amen do you remember how many stuff were put in the in the temple in the old testament they put this nothing happened they put this nothing happened they put this nothing happened they put this and when they put the ark of the covenant as soon as the ark entering that was it the pillar of fire followed the ark boom and nobody was able to minister in other words god took control he was no more in the hands of man he was god himself filling his temple amen so that message that you receive the book that god is bringing you if you realize what this message is if you realize what this message is you're going to have one penny in your bank account and you go to sleep you don't believe me right you will look at your bank account and it says 0.01 and you're sleeping very good and you wake up in the morning nice [Music] amen there are people who have money they can't sleep so it's not about money amen in other words your heart is confident that's what naomi told the roof he said what did he give you he gave me six measure of say girl go to sleep don't worry about it anymore you see that man he will not rest until he had finished the work of redemption boaz was a rich man right why was he not married all this time there was pretty young women in israel why was he not married all this time he had money he was rich what was holding him you see now maybe somebody look at him this man is crazy all these women that were in the church he just waited for a widow and not only a jewish widow a gentile we don't because our first husband must die so that we can be married to boaz [Music] you see now your first husband your first nature must die so that you can be married to jesus christ so when they say we do it doesn't mean we don't the way you see it it's the first husband that's why paul say as long as that husband is alive if you get married you're in trouble so we gotta kill the first husband when you kill the first husband when he is dead then you can be married to boaz you see now it is all different story altogether you have the book you have the message stop worrying amen take the tension off the devil is trying to make you think that the trial you're going through is god punishing you you will see that on on sunday the lord's willing you will see that on sunday he's trying to make you think that you did something wrong amen that's what he's trying to do we saw abraham his stuff was hidden he was a man of like passion they took his stuff and hide it and you thought oh abraham was always a just man he lied did they say anything about it over there you see what i'm saying it is not your perfection it is who's sitting on the tronde that's the one who's taking care of our profession all we do we confessing him and we're just pointing to him and that's it because that's the statue the the stature of a perfect man that's the man that man christ that's all perfection in this body no it's waiting for the redemption of the body but to remember you have an open book use it you have an open check use it if not you're going to suffer and while we're heading to heaven you begin to regret ah give me ten minutes i'm gonna show these people it's too late we we need to go we need to go it's the time of the rapture amen so don't live under your privilege the people in the old testament did great things a lot of things with the old atonement without we thought not even what we have here in the old atonement this woman didn't have jesus christ in flesh but she said all is how can you say all this well when somebody's dead you see you see how did you know that it's always gonna be well how in the old testament so speak good things about your situation no matter how bad it is speak what is good amen something looks bad in your eyes i'm not living in a humanistic level i am in the realm of revelation in the realm of revelation god gave me the power to speak the word so i'm going to speak the word based on the authority of the word period and we're going to wrestle brother branham say one time they therefore give him a coffin he give him back they never give him back and he keep giving back back but until he starts somewhere but not on me he's going to go back to the original owner amen because in the garden of eden there was no inheritance that say cough or coved that came from here amen we're not going to have that in your new world we won't have no sickness everything will be burned up completely so refuse what is wrong refuse it say no even if everybody say it's normal refuse it somebody said no they don't they can't give you money say no me they can give it to me the children of israel they gave them stuff for free when they were asking say yes refuse something that is wrong there is things that god built in you that's the reason why you reject certain things because god beat you for something you will see somebody is not having a certain faith and you do have it because god already built that in you so when it's that time you will feel like something is pushing you like i think i can do this i think i can do don't let nobody stop you from doing that amen because they might not be the one doing it but this is me that's why brother branham say everything god leads your soul to believe belongs to you why did you bring it to me why was i sitting and then suddenly i begin to think about this why why no i'm not gonna let it go i'm not gonna let it go if you bring it here that's your problem i didn't ask you for now you got to get in trouble i'm going to bring this to pass let's keep preaching you're going to learn god very very simple you can talk to him just like the way i'm talking to you and he understands you don't have to be straining yourself for nothing you can strain or you can speak clearly normally you can even put a chair for him do you know the us used to do that in the constitution in a congress do you know they used to do that and what do you think tell him sit down here i'm tired of this it is your husband it is a love issue faith that worketh by love just like the way you talk to your husband talk to god but this is a perfect husband the one who understands us even more than we understand ourselves amen amen he's going to put somebody else to divorce men not me he did luther he did wesley he did but he moved with the further part of the world and then we pregnanted with there's nothing else you can do he's the second adam adam never rejected even do you think our second adam will reject here eve church use the word on your benefit and refuse everything that is negative on your children on your husband on your wife on the church on your friend on your family refuse it your aunt your grandpa whoever say no i refuse it you have a right to claim them amen god richly bless you let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for everything you are still doing for your children and you will continue to do lord father you spoke to us about the faith of abraham and lord tonight you came and father added the element of love because without it what else can we do lord father the lord for the souls the love for the loved one the love for a brother and a sister lord that can drive us through desperation lord father to cry for their need lord because the people are seeking love in this end time lord father you say that when iniquity will go up the love of many lord shall go down father that love will be only seen in the true brother that is filled with the oil with the holy spirit father shedding that love in the heart lord may you help this church to be a church that is bonded by the bonds of love and like your prophet stated lord father about the baptism of love may you baptize this church with love father may that love be the center force that is driving everything we're doing lord whatever we do lord may you be always anointed by that love father remember your children lord strengthen them lord it's a great sacrifice lord especially nowadays father to be coming to church lord on wednesday but they pray the way through lord father to give you honor and glory and father remember your blessings lord because you're more than able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all we can think and ask glory father strengthen brother kelly lord and give him more strength i usually look at him like a caleb of old lord father where he's pressing on despite lord father what the devil is bringing on his way father quicken and renew again lord father his strength and remember his family as well and remember your children we commit the remaining of the weak to the hand father asking you that you continue to consecrate us you continue to anoint us you continue to speak to us you continue to bless us you continue to deliver us and you continue to do more miracles in our life until by the time we come here on sunday if that terry is going to be testimony followed by testimony lord left and right for the goodness of the lord upon his children lord we humbly ask it and commit everything unto thy hand may you anoint this song lord father that will be sung by your servant in jesus precious name amen but abel if you can lead with one song please god reach you bless you stay in prayer all is well all is well amen he said fear not my child for you are part of me and i'll not rest till you are at my [Laughter] [Music] virtuous woman you are my bride let's sing that one more time he said fear not my child for you are part of me and i'll not rest till you are at my side [Music] virtuous woman [Music] and so i'm casting all my cares on you oh [Music] redemption by your blood that's the greatest the story [Music] and it's full restoration for redemption that's what seven angels in the cloud testify that my redeemers [Music] this evening god bless you and so i'm casting all my cares on
