[1:02:10] things that the battler of the king of
[1:02:14] Egypt and his Baker had offended their
[1:02:17] lord the king of Egypt amen amen and
[1:02:21] Pharaoh was angry you know this now
[1:02:24] against two of his officers against the
[1:02:27] chief of the Butlers and against the
[1:02:29] chief of the Bakers and he put them in
[1:02:33] Word In The House of the captain of the
[1:02:36] Guard into the prison the place where
[1:02:40] Joseph was bound so it's a possibility
[1:02:45] to bind
[1:02:48] Joseph you might be
[1:02:51] seated there is a possibility that you

[1:03:27] Christ so you can bind Christ
[1:03:34] amen

[1:03:48] amen amen jum to verse 14 amen and the
[1:03:54] chief Butler told his dream to Joseph
[1:03:58] and said to him in my dream Behold a
[1:04:01] Vine was before me and in the vine were
[1:04:05] three branches and it was as though he
[1:04:08] battered you know what it means now the
[1:04:10] road of haon he was a Divine
[1:04:13] inversion and her Blossom shut forth and
[1:04:16] the claster thereof brought forth ripe
[1:04:19] grapes and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand
[1:04:22] and I took the grapes and pressed them
[1:04:25] into Pharaoh's cup and I gave the cup
[1:04:28] into Pharaoh's hand amen amen and Joseph
[1:04:31] said to him this is the interpretation
[1:04:34] of it the three branches which you
[1:04:37] understand now are three days you know
[1:04:39] what it means now yet three days shall
[1:04:42] Pharaoh lift up your head and restore
[1:04:45] it's a
[1:04:47] restoration restore you to your place
[1:04:50] and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into
[1:04:52] his hand after the former manner when
[1:04:55] you were his battler verse 14 number one
[1:05:00] but after this restoration after this
[1:05:04] Deliverance after whatever God is doing
[1:05:08] have done or is about to do in your life

[1:05:56] four what is it and bring me out of this
[1:05:58] house and bring me out of this house
[1:06:02] bring me out of this
[1:06:05] house which house is it prison house in
[1:06:09] other word take me out of
[1:06:12] prison amen amen let's reread that again
[1:06:17] the Bible says but think on me when it
[1:06:21] shall be well with you
[1:06:24] come on and show kindness I pray you to
[1:06:28] me and make mention of me to who Pharaoh
[1:06:33] Joseph is very
[1:06:36] specific make mention unto Pharaoh
[1:06:40] because Pharaoh is the king amen Pharaoh
[1:06:44] is the
[1:06:46] president he has a power to
[1:06:49] Pardon amen he has a power to override
[1:06:53] the law amen he he only has the power to
[1:06:57] free
[1:06:58] Joseph Joseph didn't want his testimony
[1:07:01] to go back to part
[1:07:05] for are we together talk to Pharaoh Amen
[1:07:09] in other word the Deliverance is in the
[1:07:11] hand of pharaoh
[1:07:14] amen testify of me to
[1:07:18] Pharaoh amen amen Pharaoh got the
[1:07:21] Deliverance Pharaoh got theth authority
[1:07:24] to take me out of this place amen and
[1:07:27] when you talk to Pharaoh When you
[1:07:29] mention of me to pharaoh and bring me
[1:07:32] out of this place but actually it's not
[1:07:35] going to be the battler bringing him out
[1:07:37] it's going to be Pharaoh bringing him
[1:07:40] out after the testimony of the battler
[1:07:45] because the testimony of the battler in
[1:07:47] Pharaoh brings Faith amen that's right
[1:07:51] he brought Faith to Pharaoh amen
[1:07:56] okay praise
[1:08:00] God we clear amen that was verse uh 14
[1:08:05] job to verse 23 yet did not the chief
[1:08:09] battler do what remember Joseph but he
[1:08:11] did what forgot
[1:08:13] him somebody didn't remember the
[1:08:17] instructions chapter 41 verse 1 and it
[1:08:21] came to pass at the end of what two full
[1:08:25] years so two years have passed wow two
[1:08:28] years gone completely two
[1:08:31] years and he came two years this man
[1:08:34] doesn't
[1:08:35] remember so Joseph is staying there two
[1:08:39] years whose fault is
[1:08:42] it but whose fault is it the
[1:08:46] Butler and it came to pass at the end of
[1:08:49] two year two full years that Pharaoh
[1:08:53] dream
[1:08:54] dream and behold he stood by the what
[1:08:58] river if you know this we went through
[1:09:00] this before this dream came from God you
[1:09:03] know that Joseph said that it's God who
[1:09:06] gave you the dream amen so Joseph say go
[1:09:09] to
[1:09:10] Pharaoh mention of me to pharaoh and get
[1:09:13] me out of this place when he left he
[1:09:17] forgot amen and God followed the
[1:09:20] instruction of Joseph amen hallelujah
[1:09:23] and took the
[1:09:25] dream and sent a package of dream yes
[1:09:29] sir straight to Pharaoh with the address
[1:09:31] of pharaoh and the Amazon delivered the
[1:09:35] dream unto
[1:09:37] Pharaoh not to Piper to Pharaoh the
[1:09:41] dream must come from
[1:09:43] Pharaoh two years amen amen jop to verse
[1:09:48] uh8 because you know the remaining and
[1:09:51] it came to pass in the morning that his
[1:09:54] Spirit the spirit of pharaoh was trouble
[1:09:57] and he
[1:09:58] sent and call for All The Magicians of
[1:10:02] Egypt and all the wise men thereof and
[1:10:05] Pharaoh told them his dream but there
[1:10:08] was none that could interpret them to
[1:10:11] who Pharaoh because the thing was sealed
[1:10:14] by God himself amen Only God Can
[1:10:16] interpret it amen but this dream is just
[1:10:19] not a dream it's a dream to bring Joseph
[1:10:23] out of the
[1:10:25] are we together God calls it verse 9
[1:10:29] then spoke the chief battler so this
[1:10:31] dream brought him back to remembrance
[1:10:35] because the dream is specific to Pharaoh
[1:10:37] if maybe the dream went to somebody in
[1:10:39] the street he will not probably remember
[1:10:41] that but to remember he have to come
[1:10:43] from pharaoh and when everything is
[1:10:45] locked up then something begin to ring
[1:10:48] in his mind like hey I remember somebody
[1:10:52] God knows how to put you back in his
[1:10:54] remembers amen when you forget God God
[1:10:57] knows what to do to get you back again
[1:11:00] amen amen he says then he spoke then
[1:11:02] spoke the chief battler sorry to Pharaoh
[1:11:05] saying I do remember my fault this day
[1:11:08] if you notice this man have a tendency
[1:11:11] to acknowledge his wrong that's good he
[1:11:15] acknowledges his wrong just like the one
[1:11:19] on the cross
[1:11:21] amen amen a knowledge his wrong
[1:11:26] amen amen amen he acknowledged his wrong
[1:11:30] first before he gave the
[1:11:35] testimony Lorden okay that's fine you
[1:11:38] suck that him Pharaoh was angry with his
[1:11:42] servant and put me in word in the
[1:11:45] captain of the guard's house both me and
[1:11:48] the chief Baker and we dreamed the dream
[1:11:52] in one night I and he we dream each man
[1:11:56] according to the interpretation of his
[1:11:58] dream now he begin to do what they told
[1:12:00] him to do amen he begin to testify of
[1:12:03] what happened amen amen and there was
[1:12:07] there with us a young man a Hebrew
[1:12:09] servant to the captain of the guard and
[1:12:12] we told him and he interpreted to us our
[1:12:15] dreams to each man according to his
[1:12:18] dream he did interpret it amen verse 13
[1:12:22] and he came to as he interpreted to us
[1:12:26] so he was me He restored to my office
[1:12:30] and him he hanged verse 14 then Pharaoh
[1:12:35] send no more the battler it's Pharaoh
[1:12:39] now after he received the testimony he
[1:12:42] built
[1:12:44] Faith now Pharaoh say wait a minute this
[1:12:46] is the man we were looking for all this
[1:12:49] time where is this man everybody here is
[1:12:52] unable to interpret the go ahead and get
[1:12:54] me them but before they can get Joseph
[1:12:57] out somebody must speak somebody must
[1:13:00] testify and that testimony bring Faith
[1:13:03] am and it's the faith of
[1:13:06] pharaoh that is pulling Joseph out from
[1:13:10] the prison the faith of pharaoh amen
[1:13:13] that is taking Joseph out from prison
[1:13:16] amen amen he says then Pharaoh sent and
[1:13:19] called Joseph and they brought him hly
[1:13:23] out of of the dungeon do you see where
[1:13:24] he was two years and he shaved himself
[1:13:28] so you can tell what kind
[1:13:30] of condition that he was there amen he
[1:13:35] shaved himself and he changed his what R
[1:13:39] so he changed
[1:13:41] garment and came in to Pharaoh because
[1:13:45] Joseph have different garments he have
[1:13:48] one from his father they took it away
[1:13:50] then he went to the prison to give him
[1:13:52] another one then the take this one off
[1:13:54] and they put another one so there is a
[1:13:56] sequence of garment it's a whole sermon
[1:13:58] on that amen but that's not what I'm
[1:14:01] touching today he says and he shaved
[1:14:05] himself and changed his Remnant and came
[1:14:08] into Pharaoh everybody clear let's go to
[1:14:11] the Book of Luke then we
[1:14:14] pray you would need your
[1:14:18] Bible The Book of Luke chap
[1:14:22] 23:39 if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:14:25] and one of the mfactor which were hang
[1:14:29] railed on him saying if you be Christ
[1:14:34] save yourself and us but the other
[1:14:37] answering rebuke
[1:14:39] him on the cross saying do not you fear
[1:14:45] God so this man somehow has a little
[1:14:50] something about God in him that even if
[1:14:53] he's wrong but yet something is ringing
[1:14:56] into him that knows that man we messed
[1:15:00] up amen do not you fear God seeing you
[1:15:05] are in the same condemnation so he
[1:15:08] acknowledged his fault just like the
[1:15:10] butler amen
[1:15:12] amen and we indeed justly yes justly for
[1:15:19] we receive the due reward of our Deeds
[1:15:23] but this man now the
[1:15:26] testimony first acknowledging your own
[1:15:29] fault then
[1:15:31] testifying amen he says but this man has
[1:15:36] done nothing a miss so it looks like
[1:15:40] this was a true reflection of the
[1:15:44] battler amen because that's exactly what
[1:15:46] the battler did he acknowledged his
[1:15:48] fault and testify he says this man has
[1:15:52] done nothing nothing wrong nothing a
[1:15:54] miss and he said to Jesus
[1:15:58] Lord remember me when you come into your
[1:16:03] kingdom do you know that this man was
[1:16:05] going to
[1:16:08] prison if he ever died a sinner he will
[1:16:12] go to
[1:16:13] hell do you know that hell is a prison
[1:16:16] do you know that Jesus went to preach to
[1:16:18] the souls in prison
[1:16:21] amen amen amen amen so when he says
[1:16:25] remember me it is Jesus to pull him out
[1:16:28] of
[1:16:28] prison
[1:16:31] amen are we together are we together
[1:16:34] over there Joseph wanted to be pulled
[1:16:36] out of prison over here this one wanted
[1:16:39] to be pulled out of prison amen and
[1:16:41] Jesus said verse 43 verily I say to you
[1:16:45] today amen you come in out of a prison
[1:16:48] today shall you be with me in what
[1:16:51] Paradise so they took him from the
[1:16:53] prison right there at the cross and
[1:16:55] automatically give me a board and and
[1:16:58] give him a boarding pass to Paradise
[1:17:00] amen right there on the
[1:17:02] spot so when he died the destination
[1:17:05] changed
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:08] am there is no too late for God Amen
[1:17:12] even at the last minute

[1:17:17] last minute because he is an on time God

[1:17:38] neighbor there you say I belong to God I

[1:23:27] continues and he says this in the
[1:23:29] message the infallable word of God
[1:23:32] brother Bram say God's word declares
[1:23:36] Jesus Christ to be who the same how
[1:23:39] yesterday today and forever same in what
[1:23:43] power same in what principle same in
[1:23:46] what healing same as he ever was here
[1:23:50] now and always was and and always what
[1:23:53] will be and his attitude has to be what
[1:23:57] the same toward who every case that he
[1:24:00] has dealt with or he did it how wrong at
[1:24:04] the first time when he dealt with the
[1:24:06] case the way he did it got to be
[1:24:10] Amen in other word God's word we know
[1:24:13] that God and His word are one and God's
[1:24:17] word have a 100% predictability amen oh
[1:24:23] 100% predictability he have a perfect
[1:24:28] predictability in other word whatever
[1:24:30] God say must happen am and the way God
[1:24:34] treated the case the first time he
[1:24:36] actually lcks
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:42] God when we are talking about
[1:24:45] predictability we are talking about
[1:24:48] consistency something that can be
[1:24:50] repeated again something a course of
[1:24:53] action a behavior that is possible to
[1:24:56] know in advance what to expect
[1:25:03] am brother Bram says this again in the
[1:25:06] message expectation he say if God was
[1:25:10] ever called on the sin to what a sick
[1:25:13] man and he did and he does what healed
[1:25:15] him upon the basis of what his pain if
[1:25:18] another sick man comes to him he's got
[1:25:23] to do what the same thing or he acted
[1:25:26] wrong when he healed the first man amen
[1:25:28] so if God bless you because of a certain
[1:25:31] condition everybody that come that way
[1:25:34] must receive the same result amen if you
[1:25:38] don't receive the same result then God
[1:25:40] did
[1:25:42] wrong yes sir everybody together brother
[1:25:45] brother say if he give the one the holy
[1:25:48] ghost that obey him in the Bible EX
[1:25:52] exactly as he promised there in act he
[1:25:55] said the promis is how unto you and what
[1:25:58] to your children and then them are for
[1:26:00] all even as many as the Lord our call
[1:26:03] Our God shall do what call if the man
[1:26:06] meet those
[1:26:08] qualifications God is how obligated in
[1:26:11] other word God have no choice
[1:26:15] amen and know these kind of statement
[1:26:17] are strong but I know my God Amen I know
[1:26:21] my father amen and this is the way he is
[1:26:24] amen and let's approach him the way he
[1:26:26] is amen not the way we think he is but
[1:26:29] the way he is and his way was expressed
[1:26:32] by the prophet amen everybody okay he
[1:26:36] said if the man meets those what
[1:26:38] qualification God is obligated by what
[1:26:42] his word to fill him with what the Holy
[1:26:44] Ghost because if he didn't then he made
[1:26:47] a
[1:26:50] mistake and if God made a mistake he's
[1:26:53] what amen he's no longer God he's finite
[1:26:57] like what we are so see as Abraham
[1:27:00] children uh-huh we take God's promise
[1:27:03] and just do what hold on to it no matter
[1:27:06] what take place uhhuh we do what hold
[1:27:09] right there just what the same because
[1:27:12] God said so and that does what settles
[1:27:14] it the Bible says in the Book of Malachi
[1:27:18] that I am God and I change not Amen in
[1:27:21] other way God is
[1:27:25] predictable you can send an input and
[1:27:28] expect an
[1:27:29] output
[1:27:31] amen everybody okay God told Joshua that
[1:27:36] as I was with who Moses with Moses so
[1:27:39] shall I be with what you and with Moses
[1:27:42] god opened the right sea that's
[1:27:46] right which was an obstacle for Moses
[1:27:49] and the children of Israel so when
[1:27:52] Joshua face Jordan do you think Joshua
[1:27:54] have to think twice if God is going to
[1:27:57] be with me like
[1:28:02] Moses in Moses he opened the Red Sea
[1:28:05] this also is water even though the name
[1:28:08] is narrow at sea but it's still water
[1:28:11] what do you expect God to
[1:28:14] do he have to open the water of Jordan
[1:28:18] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:28:21] and forever the same in principle the
[1:28:25] same in essence the same in power the
[1:28:28] same in healing the same in
[1:28:33] everything as I was with Moses so shall
[1:28:37] I be with you so when God speak like
[1:28:40] that he put Joshua under
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:48] expectation one day there was a younger
[1:28:50] Prophet who took 10 years to be molded
[1:28:53] and the prophet was following another
[1:28:55] Prophet that was Elijah and Elisha amen
[1:29:00] when they reach Jordan Elisha noticed
[1:29:03] that Elijah took his mantle wrap it
[1:29:07] together sir and SM the water of Jordan
[1:29:09] what happened to the water the water
[1:29:12] parted together and they went together
[1:29:14] but when they went to the other side
[1:29:16] Elijah was taken up but Elijah left the
[1:29:20] mental
[1:29:24] and because God is
[1:29:26] predictable that same mant got to do the
[1:29:29] same thing
[1:29:30] amen
[1:29:32] Amen brother Bram is not here but
[1:29:35] brother Bram left the message
[1:29:42] amen and the message is the mental of
[1:29:45] the Prophet amen so whatever what that
[1:29:48] ment did with
[1:29:50] brother he must do do for
[1:29:54] you
[1:29:57] amen everybody together and do you know
[1:30:00] what happened when Elisha came back and
[1:30:04] faced Jordan the same river that was
[1:30:07] faced by Elijah with the same Mentor do
[1:30:10] you know what he says did you see him
[1:30:15] praying did you see him kneeling down
[1:30:18] because Elijah never pray and if God
[1:30:22] opened the Jordan without a prayer for
[1:30:25] Elijah Elijah also cannot pray because
[1:30:28] he's under the same anointing even more
[1:30:32] so the double por
[1:30:34] am
[1:30:36] amen amen if one person can do that how
[1:30:40] much more the double portion that's why
[1:30:43] Elijah stood he wrapped the mantle again
[1:30:46] and he said where
[1:30:48] is the god of Elijah a amen because
[1:30:54] where is that God that open again that
[1:30:57] open the Jordan he can also do it again
[1:31:00] amen and restuck the water and what
[1:31:03] happen 100%
[1:31:08] predictability that's why we can put our
[1:31:10] faith in God that's why we can trust God
[1:31:14] that's why we can believe God am because
[1:31:16] God is predictable
[1:31:20] amen let's go to to the Book of
[1:31:24] Matthew let's go to the Book of Matthew
[1:31:27] chapter
[1:31:28] 9 let me give you three so we can
[1:31:33] continue
[1:31:34] Hallelujah Matthew chapter
[1:31:38] 3 glory to God Matthew

[1:32:16] behold a woman which was
[1:32:20] diseased with a isue of blood how many
[1:32:23] years 12 years came how behind
[1:32:28] him there is even a mystery why she
[1:32:30] approaches
[1:32:33] behind because she approaches God On The
[1:32:36] Backs
[1:32:39] side the backside of God got a
[1:32:44] mystery when Sarah had an issue God gave
[1:32:48] Sarah the
[1:32:50] backside
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:55] are we together are we
[1:32:59] together he says and he was 12 years
[1:33:02] came behind him and touched the what h
[1:33:06] of his G there is a whole mystery to
[1:33:08] this because the Garment that Jesus wore
[1:33:11] was according to the way Jesus is in
[1:33:14] heaven yes sir Jesus had a garment thou
[1:33:18] never had
[1:33:20] any any
[1:33:24] he was whole that was his intimate
[1:33:27] garment amen and then Jesus had another
[1:33:30] the Garment on top of that I don't know
[1:33:33] who's pulling this kind of stuff I'm
[1:33:34] trying to stay in it amen and Jesus had
[1:33:37] not the Garment on top of that and that
[1:33:39] garment was cutting
[1:33:46] for do you know
[1:33:48] that the Bible predicted that
[1:33:52] they parted my
[1:33:54] garment you remember that and when they
[1:33:57] caught Jesus Christ they took the top
[1:33:59] garment and they cuted in four part
[1:34:02] among the soldier but when they got the
[1:34:05] intimate garment they look at that they
[1:34:07] say this one we cannot cut it and they
[1:34:11] and they and they did what what do you
[1:34:13] call it cast L on and they pick it up so
[1:34:16] Jesus had many garment There Was An
[1:34:18] Intimate garment and another one that
[1:34:21] was cutting for and there is also the
[1:34:25] Hem of the Garment all of this reflect
[1:34:30] Heaven are we together because the
[1:34:33] intimate garment brother Bram say that
[1:34:35] was the top of the Holy
[1:34:37] Spirit you have no no nothing you cannot
[1:34:41] see like my my shirt you can see that
[1:34:44] they saw so the put this peace and they
[1:34:46] put that garment has no peace it's one
[1:34:48] Spirit but the other one have to be
[1:34:51] divided in four because you got four
[1:34:53] living creature around the
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:59] throne then you got the Hem of the
[1:35:01] Garment let's continue my friend we okay

[1:35:24] of Jesus Christ you're going to be
[1:35:26] healed brother Bram said there was no
[1:35:28] scripture in the Old
[1:35:29] Testament everybody okay so now the
[1:35:32] scripture came

[1:35:41] touch and say within herself if I may
[1:35:45] but touch his what garment I shall be

[1:35:52] turned him about and when he saw her he
[1:35:55] say what daughter be of what good
[1:35:58] Comfort be of good cheer be of good
[1:36:01] Comfort your

[1:36:07] if I can only touch the Garment Jesus
[1:36:10] called that Faith amen Amen on and a
[1:36:14] faith is a revelation amen so it was
[1:36:18] revealed to the woman that there is a
[1:36:21] secret about this man don't worry about
[1:36:23] touching him because you can't make it
[1:36:26] there go ahead and touch the H of His
[1:36:28] Garment amen it was God who revealed to
[1:36:31] this woman because Jesus recognized that
[1:36:34] as faith and Faith come from God Amen
[1:36:38] that's right that's right are we
[1:36:40] together and remember this Faith was not
[1:36:43] written in the Bible it was not written
[1:36:45] in the Old Testament this is the first
[1:36:48] time such case happened
[1:36:50] Ames do you follow me we're talking
[1:36:52] about a 100%
[1:36:54] predictability everybody okay and the
[1:36:57] Bible say and Jesus turned him about and

[1:37:03] good Comfort your faith has made you how
[1:37:06] whole and the woman was made whole from
[1:37:10] that what hour so from this time another
[1:37:13] scripture is added in the Bible right

[1:37:20] beautiful don't worry my friend you can
[1:37:22] choose steak you good amen at the
[1:37:24] beginning there was no scripture in the
[1:37:27] Old Testament that says that when the
[1:37:29] Messiah will come if you touch his H
[1:37:32] garment you're going to be healed never
[1:37:35] happened but this woman by faith amen
[1:37:38] God gave her a scripture amen that was
[1:37:42] not given in the Old Testament amen and
[1:37:45] that scripture was given to her and that
[1:37:47] scripture become part of the New
[1:37:49] Testament Amen in other what a case open
[1:37:53] up and God dealt with that case a
[1:37:56] certain way and the way God dealt with
[1:37:59] that case is that if you touch just the
[1:38:02] H of Jesus
[1:38:06] Christ you can get healed amen so from
[1:38:10] now on Jesus Christ oh God is locked
[1:38:15] amen God will never change that
[1:38:18] scripture anymore sir no sir in other
[1:38:22] word whoever
[1:38:24] comes am with an issue and approaches
[1:38:28] God the same way am and touch the H of
[1:38:32] garment must be healed amen if not God
[1:38:35] did

[1:38:55] 14:35
[1:38:57] Hallelujah if you thereare you can say
[1:38:59] amen amen the Bible says in verse 35 and
[1:39:04] when the man of that place had knowledge
[1:39:07] of who him him who Jesus Jesus they knew
[1:39:11] that Jesus was there when they had
[1:39:15] knowledge of him that head knowledge
[1:39:16] means when they
[1:39:18] recognize him amen they sent out into
[1:39:22] all that country roundabout and brought
[1:39:26] to him what all that were diseased it
[1:39:29] doesn't matter what you are troubling as
[1:39:31] long as you sick all that were what
[1:39:34] disease and they besought him Jesus that
[1:39:37] they might only do what Touch the Hem of
[1:39:40] His Garment everybody okay now everybody

[1:40:49] language that if somebody else in this
[1:40:51] church approaches God the same way as
[1:40:55] the one that got healed God is under
[1:40:58] obligation to repeat or to do the same
[1:41:02] way amen because God is predictable if
[1:41:06] he doesn't do it then God is wrong he

[1:42:11] predictability
[1:42:12] causes
[1:42:14] expectation that's right that's right
[1:42:17] amen because of the fact that God is
[1:42:21] predictable because of the fact that God
[1:42:25] can repeat himself
[1:42:27] over because of the fact that God is the
[1:42:30] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:42:34] that automatically put the people of God

[1:52:31] behind the prophet there is a God that
[1:52:33] is coming

[1:53:43] prophet speaks Deliverance must come but
[1:53:46] it looks like after the message on on on
[1:53:50] the people condition seems to be like
[1:53:53] they're not
[1:54:00] changing can I continue then the Lord
[1:54:05] himself step on the scene and find out
[1:54:08] the people in that condition of fear
[1:54:11] that they have to hide stuff from the
[1:54:15] medion listen to what brother brandham

[1:57:42] did we believe it but why are we like
[1:57:48] this
[1:57:50] because predictability give
[1:57:53] expectation but when expectation is not
[1:57:55] met it CS confusion
[1:57:58] [Music]

[1:58:12] strength okay they are telling us that
[1:58:14] God is this God this this God is why are
[1:58:17] we in this condition then come
[1:58:21] on let's go my friend verse 13 and
[1:58:25] Gideon said to him oh my Lord if the
[1:58:28] Lord be with us why then is all of this

[1:58:51] Miracle which
[1:58:53] Our Father did what us saying did not

[1:58:59] but now the Lord have done what forsaken
[1:59:02] us and Deliver us into the hand of what
[1:59:05] Med so the man was confused that's right
[1:59:09] come on because the expectation is not
[1:59:12] met I listened to the prophet I heard
[1:59:15] what he says our father told us that God
[1:59:18] did so and so so why are we in this
[1:59:21] condition then and you are coming you

[1:59:36] god of
[1:59:41] Elijah hallu I want to see him now
[1:59:45] because I'm still hiding
[1:59:48] food

[2:00:11] what sent thee verse 15 and he said to
[2:00:14] him oh my
[2:00:15] Lord wherewith shall I save Israel now
[2:00:19] the complexes begin to come
[2:00:21] out behold my family is how poor they
[2:00:25] were already poor everybody was
[2:00:30] poor the Bible say Israel was in
[2:00:33] poverish so what is povery have to do

[2:01:39] GNA it is not about whether your father
[2:01:42] is which or not it's about what did God
[2:01:45] plan for
[2:01:48] you
[2:01:52] in other word God is speaking according
[2:01:54] to his plan you are speaking according
[2:01:57] to what you see here God is saying Mary
[2:02:00] Men of Valor you say look at me Mary Men
[2:02:02] of Valor God is not looking at you like
[2:02:04] that God is not looking at your
[2:02:08] muscle it is not the size of the

[2:03:26] strength it bring question it brings
[2:03:29] confusion it bring discouragement like

[2:03:33] preaching about this but why are we in
[2:03:35] such a condition it is

[2:41:09] let's go to Genesis
[2:41:13] 41 prise the Lord
[2:41:17] I'm two minute
[2:41:21] over let me drive this so we can go home
[2:41:24] amen amen amen
[2:41:28] amen Genesis 41 if you there you can say
[2:41:32] amen amen verse 38 you there amen after
[2:41:37] Joseph came out of the
[2:41:39] prison and he display everything because
[2:41:43] God is
[2:41:44] predictable I'm amen that's why the
[2:41:46] dream was sent back to Pharaoh because
[2:41:50] what God what Joseph did to the battler
[2:41:54] he interpreted a dream so God sent the
[2:41:57] dream to be interpreted again because
[2:42:00] God is predictable Joseph said the
[2:42:02] interpretation belong to God if he
[2:42:05] interpreted the first Dream he must
[2:42:07] interpret the second dream no matter how
[2:42:10] hard that dream seems to be because
[2:42:13] Pharaoh had a double dream
[2:42:16] but the other one had only one so even
[2:42:18] if it's a double dream the same God is
[2:42:22] predictable Joseph never thought Pharaoh
[2:42:25] let give me time to pray the same way he
[2:42:28] reacted with the battle the same way he
[2:42:30] was introduced to Pharaoh is the same
[2:42:34] way he's going to replicate
[2:42:36] himself with his result and he opened up
[2:42:40] and and and broke the seal and interpret
[2:42:42] the dream again because what God open
[2:42:45] and another the opportunity to get him
[2:42:48] out of trouble you think you put to the
[2:42:52] corner you think things are tight it's
[2:42:55] another opportunity for you to get him
[2:42:57] out of prison remember him you left him
[2:43:01] in prison you are tight in a corner you
[2:43:04] don't know what to do things don't work
[2:43:05] the way you want it it's a way he want
[2:43:08] to remind you that remember you left me
[2:43:09] in the prison you only thought I can do
[2:43:12] in your life only one time I'm still
[2:43:15] there get me out of the prison and I
[2:43:17] will prove to you what I can do again
[2:43:19] the same way I did for you if I can take
[2:43:21] care of that
[2:43:23] [Music]

[2:43:32] just just limited to dialysis I can do
[2:43:35] more for you dialysis was just the
[2:43:39] [Applause]
[2:43:44] beginning amen hallelujah let's see when
[2:43:47] you get him out of prison what happened
[2:43:50] amen verse 38 and Pharaoh said to his
[2:43:53] servant can we find such a one as this
[2:43:57] is a man in whom what the spirit of God
[2:44:01] is and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as
[2:44:04] much as God has showed you all of this
[2:44:08] how did Pharaoh know that God show
[2:44:12] him amen as much as God has showed you
[2:44:16] all of this there is none so discret and
[2:44:20] wise as you are you shall be over my
[2:44:24] what house the potential of Joseph now
[2:44:27] begin to increase from the prison to the
[2:44:31] house of pharaoh now he have when he's
[2:44:34] out of the prison and he performs
[2:44:36] something now he's taking control of the
[2:44:38] House of pharaoh if he's in prison he
[2:44:40] cannot control the house of pharaoh but
[2:44:42] when you take him out of prison he take
[2:44:44] a hold of the House of phoh because now
[2:44:47] he's free he's unlimited
[2:44:51] now amen Pharaoh says that you shall be
[2:44:55] over a my house come on and according to
[2:44:58] your word shall who all my people now

[2:45:59] am from the spirit of heaviness to a
[2:46:02] Garment of Praise to a fine lenen
[2:46:05] because Joseph now is free as he's free
[2:46:08] he's taking control and you know the
[2:46:10] story he never only took control of
[2:46:13] Egypt he took control of the ire world
[2:46:15] even in the land of Canaan because he
[2:46:18] was free from the prison your God is
[2:46:22] powerful your God is mighty the God of
[2:46:25] this message is real the God is this
[2:46:28] message is alive this message is not a
[2:46:31] history this message came to take to
[2:46:34] lift God out of history and brother Bram
[2:46:38] preach that
[2:46:40] message brother brandham did his part he
[2:46:43] took God out of his history brother Bram
[2:46:46] is gone but the god of brother Bram that
[2:46:49] Pillar of Fire is with you now it's your
[2:46:52] turn to take God out of History amen for
[2:46:55] your own life amen for your own family
[2:46:58] amen for your own children amen for your
[2:47:00] own church amen take God out of your own
[2:47:05] history take the limit off of
[2:47:08] God and let him take over your job let
[2:47:12] him take over your house like he did for
[2:47:14] the house of pharaoh and everything in
[2:47:16] Egypt
[2:47:19] Prosper have you noticed that the year
[2:47:22] of Plenty started only after Joseph
[2:47:25] interpreted the dream that's right
[2:47:27] that's right right amen he didn't
[2:47:30] started only after Joseph interpreted
[2:47:32] the dream and when they gave Joseph the
[2:47:35] appropriate position then the years of
[2:47:37] plenty started and there was more weight
[2:47:40] that they could not number for you to
[2:47:43] reach a point where you got more we that
[2:47:46] you cannot number get Joseph out of
[2:47:48] prison put him in his position and let
[2:47:51] him do what he want to do take God out
[2:47:54] of your prison am let God have his way
[2:47:57] am and let God do what he want to do for
[2:48:00] your own life God richly bless you let's
[2:48:03] stand
[2:48:05] [Applause]
[2:48:08] amen as you bow ahead talk to that God
[2:48:13] call him off the sin call him for your
[2:48:16] own
[2:48:18] life and remove those
[2:48:26] limitation in our families we are always
[2:48:30] this that is the limitation you put on
[2:48:37] God that's not what God
[2:48:40] says God didn't tell you
[2:48:43] that yeah
[2:48:47] amen Jesus himself when he came he says
[2:48:50] the work that I
[2:48:53] do you will do also and you will do even
[2:48:55] greater work God wants you to do greater
[2:48:58] things than himself so why do you limit
[2:49:03] God the Bible says that there are many
[2:49:06] things that Jesus have done that was not
[2:49:09] written in this
[2:49:11] Bible so you are restricting God
[2:49:16] to operate only a certain
[2:49:21] way brother Bram say what you see in me
[2:49:25] temporarily you're going to see it
[2:49:28] how in its fullness in the
[2:49:31] BR if what he had is
[2:49:35] temporary what expectation do we have
[2:49:38] then and if that expectation is not
[2:49:41] satisfying we begin to have
[2:49:43] questions because we were taught wrong
[2:49:46] today you taught that God is predictable
[2:49:49] today you taught that God can do even
[2:49:52] exceedingly and abundantly above all
[2:49:55] that you can ask and
[2:49:57] think get him out of your prison talk to
[2:50:01] him as they playing
[2:50:13] Softly
[2:50:19] [Music]
[2:50:37] Hallelujah you didn't speak this word he
[2:50:40] spoke it and he Duty bound to his word
[2:50:49] don't P
[2:50:53] God like he's not able to do what you
[2:50:56] want to ask him to do don't pity him God
[2:50:59] don't want to be pity he want to be
[2:51:02] recognized as
[2:51:07] [Music]
[2:51:13] God
[2:51:18] no matter what God does in your life
[2:51:21] never leave him in a prison bring him
[2:51:24] out for something
[2:51:26] [Music]
[2:51:38] greater
[2:51:43] Hallelujah
[2:51:45] [Music]
[2:51:54] when they brought Joseph out the
