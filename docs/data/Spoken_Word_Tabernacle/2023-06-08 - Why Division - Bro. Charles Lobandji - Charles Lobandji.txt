are amateurs God I'm not sure God means a little God and the scriptures say ye are God and all of you are the children of the most high God amen before I come up here brother Sam Mal sent me a text he said brother Stephen I'm up to date with amateur God so somebody is really really staying tight amen glory to God I am not preaching tonight but we have a special visitor all the way from the Congo his name is uh brother Charles lebanji this is the pastor that introduced my family-in-law to the message so my wife and her entire family and my sister coming out there everybody believed the message through this man so this is his first time being in the United States and the Lord opened the door so that uh he will be leaving this weekend so he will be ministering for us and not only that we got a lot of family members here I got uh his daughter right here and the husband so what I'm gonna say is for the entire family to stand up so spoken word Tabernacle can welcome you so just stand up there is no visitor tonight thank you very much you might be seated God richly bless you the pastor wife is beside my wife and my wife younger sister the one that she went to the Congo to for the for the marriage she's right there sister Mary and her husband so the first time in spoken words so God richly bless you and welcome to spoken word Tabernacle my sister is back there and everybody is a family we don't have visitors in this church so you home you pull like home we preach like home we behave like home and we are fed like home amen glory to God let's go with only belief as we're

Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible oh Lord [Music] I believe Lord I believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] Lord I believe amen we pass through I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ God richly bless you know we are so glad to gather together in this church and we thank the Lord for this fellowship and I would like to thank brother Stephen for his Hospitality his love and his confidence you know love will express that to everyone because the Bible say love even your enemies but the Bible never say trust your enemies amen amen so to let someone to your Pulpit it is even more than lost so it's a son of a trust because the pulpit is like a bad chamber so you don't let anybody come in especially at this time where the devil is rising because as the bride has been awakened the devil also is away so everything is going to maturity as the bread goes to maturity the church also is uh the devil also is going to maturity because the seed of God will reach maturity so the seed of the devil also will do the same complicated so it's very complicated so to make it so you must be the seed of God so that God will keep me to always keep his Trust so God richly bless you yes let's go straight to the scriptures John chapter 4. Beginning by the fifth verse John chapter 4 is then come he to a city of Samaria which is called sakar near the parcel of grand that Jacob gave to his son Joseph Jesus Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat Das on the well and it was about the sixth hour read from the summary event without there come a woman of Samaria to Joe water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciple were gone away unto the city to buy meat foreign for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans foreign give me to drink that Waters have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water foreign foreign Jesus answer and say unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall test again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never Thirst by the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up until everlasting life foreign I have no husband Jesus say unto her that is well said I have no husband for I have five husbands and he whom that has now has it not the husband in that say that truly foreign here the language is changing the first he called she called Jesus and there is no relationship between the Jews and the Samaritans there is no relationship between American and French between the belgians and uh uh Germany but here if you notice the language have changed so now she's calling him Lord sir Jesus our father worshiping this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where a man ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father you worship ye no not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father's sake of such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is the woman say unto him and know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things and Paula de Messi or Messi she's talking about the Messiah to the Messiah himself not knowing that she was talking to them to the Messiah about the Messiah not knowing it's the Messiah we are talking about God without even knowing that we are addressing our thanks to God foreign because she was repeating what she heard from the Pharisees the one that they were waiting of his coming was already there and she was not aware of it she began to preach Jesus Christ about Jesus himself Jesus say unto her I that speak unto thee I am he Ard from and upon this came his disciple and Marvel that he talked with a woman yet no man say what sick is that or what talk is that with her you see the thought of God always quick to think about it they already live a long time with Jesus Christ and they already pee they even mentioned that he was the president but now he begins to be suspicious about Jesus Christ talking to a woman a lot of men always quick for evil is mentioned that the thoughts of men are always turned toward evil even the scriptures mentioned about it the woman then left the water part and went her way into the City and said to the man come see a man which told me of all things that I ever did is not this the crust then they went out of the city and came unto him verse 41 and many more believe because of his own word and say unto the woman now we believe not because of that saying for we have heard him ourself and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world let's pray heavenly father father I just read your word but you are the one that can give a context give it to us for the blessing of our souls father may you move me out of the way because your children want to hear your voice because in your word that's the only place that we can find life from the beginning to the end of this service may you be the only one directing this service and speaking to your children father speak to us so that at the end thank you every heart be convinced that's really God have spoke to us and that we are really blessed in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you and ask it amen amen God bless you you might be seated tonight that was my scripture Foundation and I would like to add Genesis 1 verse 26. we did thee God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air over the counter and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth I'm gonna add First Corinthians chapter 13. you will understand the Harmony between those scripture hours we blend them together first Corinthians 13 verse 8. 8-13 charity never fellas foreign is charity may the Lord bless the reading of his word we already prayed we read the scripture and from those scriptures I would like to take a title tonight for my sermon why division in the message of the hour amen amen because reading the message of it several times so it is our duty to repeat the prophet if the prophet spoke he was not brother he was the talk of God that was expressed and if that thought was delivered it means that somewhere there is a problem [Applause] is to pray for them amen that's why I gave a title The Division in the message we are reading the message we all are catching the thoughts sometimes we repeat the same thoughts we are manifesting something else and the greatest responsibility is started with the pastors that's why brother Branham says [Music] [Applause] not because he can preach God because he's living what he's preaching that's why it is better to leave a sermon than to preach one [Applause] amen amen that's why you just bear with me back home we don't use computers so just bear with me I will be using books so as my introduction I'm gonna read Hebrew chapter one it was preacher August the 21st 1957. this is brother Branham says this is paragraph 60. major Los s and I believe when he was speaking to this is Brother Brown I'm speaking that God have predestinated us to be sons and daughters and God have adopted us a Christian so that we children of Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world now notice this 61. and then when he spoke about in the Roman them they were adults yes they had the other sons of the Holy Spirit but they never frame made their Productions they never made up Sensations or some kind of feelings or some kind of funny feelings they never made up stuff is only sales Center speakers they let the Holy Spirit works so they only stop where the spirit of the Lord they never added their own thoughts continues 62. Paul says you you are going further with this you should be Master but you are still babes [Music] it has been more than 50 years meaning that we went beyond the very time of the Rapture that now we are in the long sufferings so the blood of Jesus Christ is supposed to be already mature but when we're looking at what is going on between the children of God we can tell that we are still children a lot of time a problem here we have [Music] we are still like in a backyard with children playing that's why brother Brian I'm adding paragraph 63. So I'm also reading [Music] and brother Branham say I always try do not come down with it so that this Tabernacle be like that not a bunch of babies we must be adults stay on the road oh my that's it that's why the blood of Jesus Christ The Secret of our success is in the message something somebody to take the message away we must cherish the message the problem is are doing something else that's why we that's why we get the problem well today massage the message we are supposed to know all the Mysteries that were revealed to us but we're still acting like babies a lot of tiny problems all conflict here conflict left and right we have enemies that in this age God did not hide anything to his brother amen amen we yes I gave you the complete the full advice of God do you understand we yes and he revealed unto us all the secrets of God foreign how to stand how to react come on say how to do how to walk and how to live why basket because we are not meant to live like the rest of the world worship like other churches because we have all the secrets of God and we know what God wants and what God is expecting from us reproducing that that's the problem we yes I'm already showed us what to do how to live but we are still looking at it do you follow in the sermon the Messiah I will just stay with me and be very uh pay attention and you will understand why the Messiah preached in 1961 paragraph three oh this is Brother Brown I'm saying I'm sure you Prophet a promise that the prophet prophesies that at the evening light time they will be like so the light that came at the evening is this message and at that time when everything is dark in the world and knowing that we are living and working in the lights the light that he promised to bring that he did promise and to see yourself a privileged people who feel this is to Rejoice of these things in the end time [Applause] and it's almost the same thing in this age in this age of laodicea so how many American people knows that God sent us a prophet over there in our country in America and one uh an American original from Jeffersonville but he's an American and the message started here to show you that message that this message it's not to the Americans it is the message of the children of God we have children of God [Applause] [Applause] and the messenger has always been a secret to the sovereign foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] but we are not doing what the courts are saying [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah do you follow me carefully I'm still at the introduction [Applause] is having more we miss you brother Branham say yes sir legless the church is not God's mouthpiece a lesson she become her own mouthpiece [Applause] that's why God is turning against her [Applause] [Applause] it is the description of the life of the brother Hallelujah the world will hear directly from God as in the day of Pentecost but it's evident that as in the first age that bad will be rejected so don't worry about it even people are rejecting it it's the word being fulfilled so he spoke in this age you have the word than ever but you're not doing anything else but to dislocate it to cut it here and there taking what you wanted and living what you don't want I'm gonna give you an example just tell us another one the foreign how many people are doing that today is sinning it is not up to us to tell God what we want to be done it is up to us to submit to what God wants us to do [Applause] there is nothing to modify everything but today the Christians they come to church every day later there is no guiltiness because the one who's supposed is when the Holy ghosts the Holy Ghost will tell you that you're going out of the line that's why we see everything that we can see so what is matter to us is to do what we want brother pranam said it is not living the world it is about debating [Music] to do why are we discussing the fossil group everyone each one is defending his Clips because we have many clips and each one wants to show that my brothers now listen to me carefully when the message says that the seven Thunders they're bringing bags together it is this is not the Gathering of this the body of Christ not a local church God doesn't recognize you because you are going to a certain Church no no God will recognize when you are baptized in the body amen hallelujah hallelujah you following me listen today in the sermon the attitude toward God preached in 1950 August the 5th in paragraph three brother brand I'm saying you know I believe that when God Jesus Will appears he will not ask us if we are a member of a certain denomination we will be judged according to what we have done with Christ in our heart the christianism Christianity doesn't mean to be a member of a particular Church unless it means you are born in the Kingdom the kingdom of God that's why the summit we are in the same church body yes the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] so we should not be arguing [Applause] [Music] amen amen are you still following me it is not living that is uh discrete it is about debating I would like that be called and you rejected I will support us if you want to know the truth of the word then I will praise you foreign [Applause] amen agency and brother Branham says 356 brother Branham says we yes this is the last warning La vertices this is the warning of the church it is a message doesn't belong to us but the problem is when we see the so at that point we need to scream like the prophet yeah the spirit will never speak in another way because the age of clothes [Applause] so that certainly we are at the end blocking him says we learned oh how true that is [Music] and then bring that man to perform miracles Spirit shall be very close it should even deceive the very like seriously was possible but it's impossible we yes [Music] just as Judah have a true Ministry in the Holy Ghost and he was declared that he was a devil [Music] and miracle and gift and friendship [Applause] be careful be careful with that gift Salah to accompany the world [Applause] be careful with that yeah Hallelujah we must be very careful about it we yes it's not Judah Judah went to preach in the group that Jesus said he was among them he preached he you heal the sick he came back and he gave a report to Jesus and Jesus because the the spirit is but his name was taken out meaning that is that the gift is not the primary thing I know why I'm saying that because today when we pray for the sick when we do this and this we think that we got the true thing and look at what the Pentecostal people do they pray about the sick and the things they don't have those promises that's the difference that's the difference amen amen we got promises we are living in the promises we cannot receive any other learning but he will listen in order to come against it [Applause] [Music] foreign it and we cannot receive the thought of a man when brother Branham speaks on we stop here now today we have nothing to happen nothing to remove amen amen amen so what have we not have seen yet what kind of behavior have we seen we are uh casting one another as a critical we are criticizing one another elect yes maturity [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] today as we only consider the prophet listening to the advices there is only one voice that we can listen it is you must trust him I don't know why am I insisting there because there are many voices rising up and we must be very careful and brother Branham says this in the sermon the spoken word is the Original Series in our second part paragraph 436. going to 437. listen carefully it's the same line no now the million many people are are doing wonders in these last days we have the denominational churches maybe you don't see it here come back they have uh I mean full gospel meeting on big stages where they are they are pretending to bless the people they're calling people to bring money and I mean big masses are following that religion and they have big religious questions and the people are going to concert not even about his word in this last day they believe everything they believe it but listen to me we are not in this church because we are here because of the world that are following the world amen amen I can preach you the word like a sense but if I don't like brother Stephen where am I going to go with my gift I'm gonna follow Judah Judas have a gift yes he was an apostle because that's our behavior and attitude amen we praise until Lord the demonstration present them all these happy all kind of corner demonstrations whether it's according to the scripture or Not Jesus warn us yes it's the same Spirit very close you should deceive the very elect if it was possible it's like one day I saw a Believer coming Pastor he said I met someone on the road and he told me I say why I said why I say so follow him we are not attracted by songs amen amen amen don't be intimidated we yes how can you distinguish between them gives them the word how to recognize it speak the word foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] but it's always the word that itself that the Holy Ghost gives the energy that's what brother Branham you want to get it first start a favor toward him the words of everything that is following your ministry [Music] keep your eyes on the message keep your eyes on the message [Applause] only the Prophet the word himself and we want to stick with the teaching of the prophet yeah I'm gonna say something listen to me carefully we are in the time that the word let me say it clearly we are in the time that the word and the sun alone are not sufficient I'm gonna show you that let's come back to our lesson are you following me so now let me go back to the scripture let's look at this John let's look at this woman from Samaria we yes jean-ship John chapter 4. then say the woman of Samaria how is it that that being a Jew which I am a woman of Samaria yes for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans said the father this woman was praying said the fam this woman know the words and she was also segregationist foreign do you follow me carefully because she never met the Messiah Jesus said [Applause] if you know the gift yes what is the gift of God John 3 Verses says verse 16. God so loved the world in other words and you won't perish that called me when I was in Kentucky from England and she asked me a question can someone be uh saved without the message there is no salvation that came out of Mary they did this is I won [Applause] he's not greater than his word and the form God took today this is the form of the message that is finishing its course in the children that's why he missed yeah God a dead manifested us that God has manifested in the Bible God by his words many bodies [Applause] the end time God is manifesting in Many Bodies many members [Applause] and I thank God because the sister finally understood she said thank you so now listen verse 25 La Familia the woman says unto him now the woman is preaching Jesus to Jesus vegetables the same Pastor that was preaching about Jesus Christ told the woman that that one is bearable that's why I said the family that woman left her home as a Samaritan to the world as a prostitute the very gift of God amen do you follow me he say when he come he will tell us so because Jesus can never hide before his own seed s Jesus said I am he [Music] hallelujah hallelujah we yes I am denominational and she told away thank you [Applause] and she ran when she was leaving home he was a prostitute [Applause] with the knowledge of the pastor prostitute prostitutes segregationists and everything trouble problems but when she met the Messiah amen amen let me save yourself [Applause] forgiven foreign another place if Jesus was no longer a jealous he was not the Messiah Amen to somebody that she was no longer somebody president and the Bible says they all came out hallelujah amen amen do you listen ing do you really get it now she had a new experience brought the Forgiveness of all her sins so what happened to us we are in the world but we are not really in the word we are in the message but we're not really within the message we are in the church but we are not in Christ we have a confusion between the church and the mystical body of the Lord and I want you to know that for that Pastor Jesus was the devil may God said the family but when that word experience it's individual [Applause] might be just like a bridge taking you from one place to another example let me give you an example there is a uh everything and that is separating two cities and they put a a bridge there is but listen to me carefully okay let me explain it okay let me explain this if you have two cities and there is a river in the middle there is no communication between the two cities so when they spend a bridge there the bridge is the one that is bringing communication between the two cities but the bridge will never enter either cities but you're a fun Pastor that will be only there to help you abide themselves won't get there [Applause] do not stay in a group stand in Christ [Applause] that's why brother Branham says this is It's a preaching 19 uh 56. in October the 4th 1957. paragraph 55 brother Brandon says this is a good preacher yeah can preach more than you anytime no more than you that than you will ever know and yes 10 more certainly foreign says that's not right amen to know the word is not life [Applause] to know about your Creedence to not the doctrine of your church that is not life let you know him that is life no Jesus Christ in theology [Applause] and that was it that settlement amen go to The Villages if you go back home to our Villages brothers and sisters who don't know even how to remember but they have the Holy Ghost they don't know how he would manifest a Christian on Earth and they will show you question they must say believe but they don't know if there is that they know Jesus but they know Jesus say Amen oh man [Applause] I mean to whip Brothers instead of helping people okay let's go ahead but you are not one with the scriptures are speaking about the gift of God the gift of God nobody can die before the gift of God if he was you and me if we had the discernment of this place do you know why everybody will be like you a procedure no you Jesus Jesus never go in a rush way with her tell me a little bit Among Us here tonight let me explain you this Among Us here tonight who among us if you know who will kill you in 10 years you already know this man in 10 years will kill me and you will live with him like Jesus did with Judah and and God already told you that in 10 years are you going to live with him but Jesus three and a half years knowing that it's gonna be Judas never even criticize Judah says Jesus even gave him in a job as a treasure in the church that is going to be Judas was calling him but Jesus also bear with him amen but as today for a small mother I'm upset no we speak everything any kind of words will come up foreign ah though but Jesus known set of me see he knew that this man will kill me he knew that is you know that this man will kill you and you still bear with him and can you do it can you tell me twice and he took him and responsibility let me explain you Jesus never even talk about it Jesus never even asked him for the inventory I'm enough a report he just let him continue do you have a scripture of a report that was given about Judah yeah so you take a child of God you give him a job in your face and if he does an error you start saying this is your brother talk about talk to his God and then shut up [Music] I mean I mean do you understand that well do you understand that well listen to this Mercy oh thank you Jesus I'm going to go to paragraphs I'm not going to read everything brother Branham says no matter if you spoke in terms every all that goes together with the things speaking in tongue gifts it's always following them and if that word I'm not going to be caught by that in the message when the angel came to me it is this listen to me come online this is the truth we can have gift without knowing god God obey awards are connected you you can have gift without knowing god Japan I thought people will say Amen even says in 1965 in Paradox Bradham says he said Divine Healing is the children's bread and Paradox in January the 17th 1965. it's a different paragraph whether you take it from the uh healing is the children it's in the atonement and the atonement first applied to your soul always forerun every message and every message in order to gather the people Madam Jesus many people come to a healing meeting or maybe at a musical concert many people can fall survey but when it comes to save a poor soul you won't see many people that will be interested why that girl is not even healing like concern oh music account they're fine that's not uh that's uh you show the fish debate of the Sun this is [Music] church because of science be here

we can fellowship with them God preached to a denomination church and go and preach to them amen amen do you understand we yes that's why brother Branham says maybe we will never meet again maybe we will leave and never see each other but I want my word to be written in the book of Heaven is invited each one of you to receive Jesus even though sometimes it hurts but I'm gonna give uh uh I'm gonna make a statement and I'm free from your blood the blood of men are you ready to receive Christ one more time listen to me brother Brandon is clear if somebody died today it's not the fault not the

Baptist Church they went all over the country to show that the baptism going all over the country saying the Baptists were good people they say yes sir yes because they are it's a picture do I disagree with them in many things at least I can choose before I can take a communist but we all Believe In Christ that is what matter Equity listen this we have to respect one another [Music] do you follow me on the experience let's look at the experience of this woman and her clothes and I'm gonna close by this the Mighty God being unfair before that's where I'm gonna close okay this is brother Brandon look at this priest Mighty God being unveiled before I'm going to talk about the woman of Samaria again look at this priests so the preacher of the Samaritan woman called Jesus showing for him from where word this one was reflecting the modern opinion of the time but that little prostitute woman that he met and say is he will tell us all things so she recognized the anointed one why because he was fulfilling the scriptural requirement since Sun said it is the two China pepper that met together [Music] we know that when the Messiah comes what was the blending of the scripture with that experience that Jesus gave to her what was the result he produced the Messiah did you see that oh as soon as everything that she have was forgiven Pasco come on Smart because at the beginning she was redeemable in the thought of God at the beginning when she saw the manifestation of the spirit expressing Jehovah what he was and what he is do you know what Messiah means the union of the old scriptures plus the experience and set the farm and that woman [Music] change her opinion so look at this message and meet Brothers he wants to show me something he give me a quote I give him a quote back second meaning something is wrong between us [Applause] [Music] I am also his brother do you understand the quotes that we are pulling out we have it that means experience but without experience

for all of us [Applause] carefully put the manifestation every manifestation of of power you must avoid every manifestation of power that is produced in the life of a person that is not surrendered to God things yes yes yes oh nothing should be you know today we have advertisements when I'm not uh uh in one Accord with my brother Stephen what happened to us every time in my church we will be

a big clap [Applause] thank you and amen what a message of unity the biggest trouble we have is because of lack of Revelation amen that's why I told somebody I say in order to preach this message you need to make sure you got the spirit that was with William Marion Branham and from there you will really catch what the prophet was saying and what the prophet saw that's why brother Branham saying he can never over emphasize the need of a revelation to the believer once you receive the true revelation of this message then there is no more fasting you are heading toward heaven and moving forward praying one for another let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking to our local church and to the people that were streaming and all over the world there are many people that will tune in maybe later and I will be blessed and edified by the sermon that was preached tonight father it's a heart searching testimony a heart searching sermon where Lord father each one of us should spend their time in the quietness of the day thinking over their life and checking to see whether we are in the faith like brother Branham say we didn't come to be in a message but to get into the message father may you unfold the revelation to those that don't have it because the hour is very late and we can see clearly that you're coming is coming Lord father may you help this church may you help each individual here tonight and those that will be streaming to wake up because this is a wake-up call to realize Where We Are where we have failed and father to recalibrate ourselves and stand in the middle of the road Lord may you strengthen brother Charles may you give him more strength and may you help him in his ministry and you may you bless the family and each one that was able to come and support the meeting tonight
