here uh our main focus here or apart from the word of god is uh we're looking for a place of worship as you can see we're so tight here and uh we've been looking at some lands we just missed one me and brother michael and what stephen has been looking at it we lost it somebody somebody built it and beat us on it so lenders are having a hard time financing churches these days we've covered 19. so our main our only option we have now is look at our members here congregation if you can consider offering or do something we need some cash to buy the land so we need some cash we want you guys to consider that we um we will be taking offering now for church for the church building and let me see here so that's that's all i wanted to say brother so consider it please we need cash they don't they don't lend now to churches because covet 19 people are staying off church so we count on you god bless you [Applause] let's stand this morning i i hope i haven't made our new pastor mad because we listen we we're expressing joy when we see him i'm trying to justify the time but we can't we can't hide the joy so let's bring him up and we'll pay extra if we stay over right let's just let's just enjoy the word of god now amen praise god so let's sing only believe in a sequel [Music] oh oh leaving me that all things are possible [Music] oh believe [Music] only believe all things are

lord for the musician amen praise the lord that will be all for the music before you know it you'll be professionals brady angelo welcome to the team he was able to play the keyboard god weakly bless you [Applause] who has despised the days of small things oh my goodness praise the lord to just clarify what brother chamber was trying to express we dedicated the tough money to go to the building this church we don't have a history and i talked to a banker and they say they usually lend money for church that has been established for 10 years we are not 10 years law yet but we have a god of miracle so if you have something like a building fund dedicated just for the building and you want to give it just right on your check building fund and we're going to put that aside and it's going to be that plus the top money and see if we can get something bigger that we can present to the bank and they can change their mind by the grace of god so just trying to clarify and make sure everything is good brother john you are good this is a house of worship you've seen a lot of people popping up here that were not popping up before so everybody's getting loose and free so we want you to be free this is the house of god it is not the house of brother stephen it is the house of god it's a family of god everybody should be free to worship god according to the leadership of the holy spirit if you don't mind let's go to joshua chapter six last week we clearly identify who zero the bell was so every brother in this church should be able to preach jeroboam and every sister should be able to exhort the rubber bear brother elijah would you help me we can move this a little bit forward joshua chapter six this is a very tough and difficult uh teaching today just a little bit more so i want you to stay awake because the message has been attacked also through what we're gonna be speaking joshua chapter six verse one and jericho was straightly shut up in other words he was closed he was sealed because of the children of israel none went out and no one came in so there was no children of israel so jericho was sealed out and israel also sealed out you might be seated in other words the world was sealed out from the children of israel and the children of israel also were sealed out from the world no communication and the lord said to joshua see i have given into your hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor and you shall compass the city all you men of war so the one hour marching or compassing the city where the man of war not everybody the man of war in other words it was an army that were marching onward christian soldier it's going to come up and go round about the city once does shall you do six days in other words there is jericho and israel were given instruction by the angel of the lord to go around the city every day one time for six days so on the first day one time second day one time third day one time up to the sixth day only one time verse four and seven priests shall bear before the ark 7 trumpet because we're going to get in the trumpets today of rams horn so we have an army marching before and beyond the army there are seven priests but each priest was carrying a trumpet but those trumpets were made out of harm rams horn so if you take a rams horn to make a trumpet that means you have to kill darren right it takes the death of a ram to produce the horn and that horn was taken by seven priests not five not four not six not eight but seven remember jeroboam zero baby always work with joshua the high priest right and this is joshua also but he had preached under him but they only chose seven out of all the priests there were seven special priests that have been chosen out to carry the ram's horn trumpet and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times so the first day one time second day one time third day one time sixth day one time but on the seventh day one two three four five six seven you shall compress the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpet after seven times and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast so those trumpets unite together into wine the seventh sound of the trumpet united together into one sound and he made a long blast if you remember when moses was pulling the children of israel to monsanta there was a trumpet that were making a long blast because god was talking everybody there with their rams horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout so nobody was permitted to speak on the first day on the second day nobody was permitted to speak everybody must come past the city but be quiet the power of the spoken word was released on the seventh day after they turned the city seven times then the shout is released everybody there and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend every man straight if you start if you study the four beasts you'll find that when the four beasts move they always move straight they don't move sideways we will get into that later and joshua's son the son of noon called the priest and said to them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear the seventh trumpet of rem's horn before the ark of the lord and he said to the people pass on and compass the cd and let him that his arm pass on before the ark of the lord everybody clear job to verse nine and the armed man went before the priest that blew with the trumpet and the real word in other words the real guard came after the ark the priest going on and blowing with the trumpet so in other words there was an army before then after the army followed seven priests and after the priest there was an ark of the covenant and after the ark of the covenant there was another army so if you sit down and you watch israel when there is a march going on the army comes first are you there and then when the march or the parade is finished there is another army last so there was an army at the beginning and there was also an army at the end and in between those army there were seven priests are you there praise the lord verse 10 and joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth everybody quiet no power of the spoken word until the day i beat you shout then you shall shout job to verse 16. and he came to pass at the seven times when the priest blew with the trumpet joshua said to the people shout for the lord has given you the city and the city shall be a curse even it and all that are doing to the lord only rehab or harlot there was a woman there under a spirit of prostitution under a babylonian spirit everybody there she all she and all that are with her in her house because she heed the messenger that were sent i will send you elijah the prophet you must be able to cherish the messenger because your life is connected to how you handle that messenger and not only your life but the life of your family are you there the way help handle the messenger protect or save the hair and her entire family praise the lord verse 18 and you in any ways will keep yourself from the accursed things lest you make yourself a curse when you take off the accursed things and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it verse 19 but all the silver and gold and vessel of brass and iron are consecrated to the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord so inside jericho there is four medals we have what what is the first one we have silver we have gold we have brass and we have iron inside jericho everybody clear let's go to daniel chapter 12. okay somebody called it already [Laughter] in this church make sure you read your bible every day and you listen to the message and you pray if not you're going to be lost your gps will be like signal lost signal lost daniel 12 verse 4 jericho have a spirit of babylon and jericho have four medals together in one city everybody there daniel chapter 12 verse 4 but you are daniel shut up the word and seal the book like revelation 10. even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased everybody there they're not daniel luke and behalf there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river and one said to the main club in what in linan which was upon the water of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders so daniel is speaking about a vision where there is a river and there is water in this river but on one side of the river there is somebody there on the other side of the river there is also another person and on the middle of the river upon the order there is also somebody standing there so there is three people in vision of daniel 12. everybody clear verse seven and i heard the man clothing lining which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and left hand to heaven like revelation 10 and stole by him that lived forever that it shall be for a time time and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished this man again finished in revelation 10 when he shall sign the trumpet all the mystery must be finished everybody clear and i heard just like john but i understood not if you notice daniel did not understood the meaning but not john okay then i said oh my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go your way daniel for the words are closed up and still till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and try but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand by the wise shall understand everybody clear last scripture but you need to keep your bible revelation chapter 11 you need to keep your bible i don't want you to say brothers even say the bible say brother brother i'm saying everybody there revelation chapter 11 verse 3 if you dare you can say amen and i will give power to my two witnesses we already preach about this it's moses and elijah and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in south cloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth we went through this so in revelation 11 this is daniel 12. in revelation chapter 11 we found two people again remember elijah and moses are the ones that are on the right and the left side we already proved to you all of that are you there and if and if any man will hurt them fire proceeded out of their mouth we already declared to you who's elijah and devour their enemy and in if and if any man will hurt them he must in this man be killed these have the power to shut heaven we prove to you it was elijah that he went not in the days of their prophecy elijah did that and have power over the water to turn them to blood that's moses and to smite the earth with all plants that moses as often as the will two people jump now to verse 15 this is where the problem is and the seven angel sounded so we have a third person in revelation 11. we have two anointed and there is another person here which have a trumpet right in revelation 10 we only have the mad danger right and we have the seven angel but this angel also is called the seven engine and the people say that this seven angel is the same as this one therefore brother branham is not fulfilling malachi or revelation 10. we want to correct that in proper teaching and the seven angels sounded and there were great voices and in heaven saying the kingdom of this world i become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever another and the four and 20 elders if you go to revelation 5 when they took the book it was the 4 and 20 elders plus the four beasts the bow down but in revelation 11 the four beasts are omitting because the four beasts only belong to the churches they don't belong to israel so no mention of them here everybody clear fell upon their faces and worship god let me jump to verse 19 and the temple of god was opened in heaven there is an opening of the temple and there was sin in that in his temple the ark of the testament so the word was revealed under this trumpet right and there were lightning and voices and thundering an earthquake and great wealth so daniel 12 have three people one here and two over there revelation 11 have three people there is two anointed but there is also the seven angel these two anointed we know that they are moses and elijah they are human and they're gonna kill them in other words they are earthly messenger and this one is an angel he comes from heaven he is a heavenly angel let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace you love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us lord you've given us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may the holy spirit the inside teacher come and unfold and reveal your word to your children father minister to your children according to their need as we commit everything sealing the devil out of this place all spirit of virus coronavirus or whatever disease is lord father we will build them from this place in the name of jesus christ may your blood protect each one of us and remember those that are streaming in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all how many enjoy the service on wednesday praise the lord that was a masterpiece from a dot to a destination today we have a small room i got used now to double room so hang tight with me we are dealing with this subject this morning the last trump versus the great trumpet so the problem is in revelation 10 there is a mighty ranger that came down put one foot upon the earth and one foot upon the sea but in the book of daniel we found out that there is an angel that have both feet upon the sea upon the waters everybody clear then in revelation 10 7 we have an angel there which is brother branham if you have a problem with that after all this teaching you see me are you there and we call him the seven angel over there but the problem is they say when these seven angels sound the trumpet in other words brother branham will be sending a trumpet everybody clear then when you go to revelation 11 we found out that there is moses and elijah there and we have another angel there which have a trumpet also and that engine over there is called the seven engine so people attack the message saying that this seven angel is the same as this seven angel because they know clearly that this one speak about the jews so by saying that they are saying that revelation 10 belongs to the jews and it does not belong to the gentiles rejecting the fulfillment of malachi 4 through brother branham and the fulfillment also of revelation 10 through brother branham but we are trying to clarify who is this seven angel and here we already know it's brother branham everybody clear now before we start with this since we are dealing with the last trump angel and the great trumpet angel which is this angel we have two terminology there the first one is a trump that's donald trump the other one is a trumpet now what is a trump and what is a trumpet everybody clear praise the lord when we speak about the trumpet usually we think about an instrument that look like this or sometime in our modern day something that looked like this but a trumpet in the bible does not look like that this is wrong why brother branham speak about the bible he say in the oriental it's an oriental book we are teaching it in a western way and it's an oriental book written in the western way and our parable or not in the eastern way thank you and our parable and the things that we teach out of there sometimes is as far as the east from as far as there is from the west of being right the way we're teaching it in our world brother branham is saying that this book is written under an eastern culture but we are trying to interpret that according to the western culture that's why you need a prophet are you there you have to see have to go to the country where the book was written to understand what they mean so when they say trumpet it doesn't look like that a trumpet in the bible look like a harm horn everybody there so before we get to the armhorn what is a trumpet take number chapter 10. if we teach this thing quickly you're gonna live here you don't understand what it means and we come back into the same mess over again number chapter 10 you need to keep your bible verse one if you dare you can say amen and the lord spoke to moses saying make you two trumpets of silver of the whole piece shall you make them that you may use them for the calling of the assembly so the trumpet are used for the calling of the assembly everybody's following me and for the journey of the camp because when israel camp in the wilderness israel camp like a everybody follow me there were the tabernacle in the middle and on the east there were three traps here that were camping on the north there were three traps here that were camping on the east three tribes and also on the south there were three traps on the east the banner of the tribe were the lion banner on the top he was done which was the ego this was then and this was jude around here on the south it was ruined and reuben was the main banner and on the west side it was ephraim and ephraim warhead the banner of an ox so when they were blowing the trumpet in israel number one the trumpet were blown to gather the people together everybody follow me then number two it was to give a signal for israel to begin to depart it's on number 10. you can read the whole chapter at home so when the trumpet were blowing the first time israel gathered together but when they blow an alarm trumpet are you there then the first tribe that was moving was judah everybody following me when you go home read number chapter 10 the entire bible you're gonna find it are you there and when they blow another trumpet the second tribe that move was rubbing down here everybody there when they continued to blow the third one was ephraim are you following me when they continue to blow they last on me that was moving was done are you there so judah was the first army that was moving are you there and the last army that was moving was done in other words when you see israel moving the first army is a lion are you there and the last army is an ego are you there remember in joshua there was an army before and there was also enough me after are you there so the movement or the moving the displacement of israel follow the clock okay if you put 12 o'clock right here you put three o'clock right there you have six o'clock there and you have nine o'clock there you find that the first one to move was right here then the direction followed this way then the direction followed this way then the direction followed this way in other words the move of israel is god time peace that's why brother branham said if you want to know the time you need to look at the jews because the displacement of israel was moving like the clock praise the lord i'm trying to find my clicker it's right here buddy branham now notice the trumpet that we are speaking of is a call together for either a feast for war for a person some sacred day or something like that notice you say for a person yeah for the year of jubilee of jubilee the announcing of the coming of freedom when they could go back now we could take a complete morning on just one that one thing but now getting into the trumpet you get the background now of the seals and the church now we are going into the trumpet the trumpet sunderland and the trumpet did not either a war or a feast day or what it means is a what gathering together of their people you saw that in number right the brother branham gives you a scripture was he lying perfectly in line with the scripture the trumpet is to cut together the people you saw it in the bible assembling themselves together for something sometimes he announced an important person like in joseph they sanded the trumpet and joseph was appearing which is a symbol of the great trumpet revelation 11 that we speak of and get to after a while in isaiah when the great trumpet will be sanded and all the nation will gather there is always a gathering to jerusalem that is when the millennium stopped the great what trumpet so brother brown i'm saying here that the great trumpet started the millennium what's going on in the seventh seal he said everything ran out in this time the end of this seventh hill notice it's the end of the church ages it's the end of the seventh hill it is the end of the trumpet it is the end of the vow and even and the ushering in of the millennium that is on the seventh seal it's even the time for all these things and they are showing in of the millennium brother branham just said that the great trumpet asher the millennium here brother branham said that the sevens here are sure the millennium that's why brother branham said that the seventh seal to the bride is the seventh trumpet to israel are you following me i know we're in deep order notice now joseph before joseph went forth they had to sound the trumpet first and people screamed bowed their knee for joseph where is this in the bible no matter what a man was doing he was selling a product on the street when that trumpet sound he bowed his knee a man was just about ready to reach out and get his money but he bowed his knee joseph was coming the mimic was just about to uh just about ready to make his act and what did he do he had to stop joseph is coming the trumpet sounded we know in the bible that when joseph was coming out the trump i mean people were bowing down but brother branham said not only were people bowing down but the trumpet was sounding where is that in the bible what rana was saying take genesis chapter 41. i will continue to say this and the only thing the only purpose i'm saying this is when the prophet speaks even if you don't see it yet just believe and move forward are you there especially when he's already ventilated because the bible says once a prophet speaks and what he speak happened from there on you must listen to him when joshua was going around jericho he met the angel of the lord with a sword joshua pulled his sword the angel had the revealed soul joshua had the written soul and he was trying to challenge the revealed sword by the written sword you don't challenge the review word by the written word [Applause] this is the arrow the pharisee did are you there you must go to the review word and the review word will show you your position in the written word [Applause] [Music] that's why jesus said go search the scripture are you there we want the bible we want the bible god search your bible your bible testify of malachi 4 [Applause] are you there when the captain unveiled himself you know what joshua did he took the sword he put it down and he bowed his name [Applause] [Music] let's go to genesis chapter 41 moses said moses said paul said paul said if you have believed moses you will believe me [Music] you don't even understand the bible genesis 41 41. and pharaoh said to joseph see i have set you over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his wing from his hand and put it upon joseph ring we talked about the ring and the robber there and they ran him in the virtue of fine lenin and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him what by the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of what egypt where does he say that a trumpet was standing brother branham said there was a trumpet standing then the people by their knee when we read the bible he only said that the people by their knee where is the trumpet we need to see it in the bible go to psalms 81. even the very concept of brother branham it's always lined up with the bible some anyone if you dare you can say amen let's see if brother brother ever give you the scripture everybody there blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on the solemn fist for this was a statute for israel and the law of god to jacob what is that law blowing of what trumpet watch verse five this he ordered in who did brother branham ever show you this when a prophet speak just say amen this was a statute at this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of what where i heard the language that i understood not so when brother branham said there was a trumpet standing he knew what he was talking about but you want to challenge him by that written word unbelievable go to exodus chapter 19 a trumpet calling together a trumpet presenting somebody like joseph everybody understood that let's go to exodus chapter 19. everybody should be familiar with this if you dare you can say amen all right the bible said in verse 9 that and the lord said to moses lord i come to you in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with you and believe you forever we believe this message forever like a ring forever and moses taught the words of the people to the lord and the lord said to moses god to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes all the people upon mount sana and you shall send a set bond to the people roundabout saying take it to yourself that should go not up into the mountain or touch the border of it whosoever touches the man shall be surely put to death watch verse 13 they shall not hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shut through whether it's be whether it be a beast or man it shall not leave when the trumpet shall sound they shall come up to the mountain god wanted to speak to israel but when god is telling israel when i brought the trumpet you gather together so the trumpet also was gathering the people together before the lord reveal unto them his word a trumpet gathered a people a trumpet presents somebody a trumpet gathered the people because god wanted to speak brother branham trumpet trump at this end announcement gabriel at the coming of the lord gabrielle shall sign the trumpet of god this was god's trumpet blowing in other words he is fixing to announce the eternal destination of the world a trumpet what is it get ready i am going to give you the revelation of jesus christ you understand the trumpet to give to the church i shall speak to you what will be the destination of the word for those who receive and those who reject a trumpet of god attention every man won a trumpet blow he grabbed his sword and stand to a place attention rather than here same voice of revelation 21 it's verse 5 or something if you check revelation 21 revelation 1 10 and 13 the voice that he heard speaking to him had the clearness of a trumpet you know how a trumpet sound he gave a shrill sound what does a trumpet mean in the bible whoa anytime you see a trumpet blow in a war in the bible time it's stunning means uh whoa come on either revelation or something to take place everybody clear praise the lord go to revelation chapter one because brother branham said it you have two choices i can rush to this or we can go slowly thank you revelation chapter 1 verse 10. if you dare you can say amen and i was in the spirit of the lord day and heard behind me a great voice as of uh everybody clear jump to verse 15. and his feet like the fine brass as it were as if they were burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of what he sounded like a trumpet he sounded like many waters no problem go to revelation chapter four verse one when john saw the vision when he was on the earth a voice of god came to him and sanded when that voice blew it blew like a trumpet are you there that was on the earth in revelation 4 chapter 1 the bible say after this after the church ages i look and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as aware of her so the same voice that spoke to john under was the same voice that was calling john up for the rapture are you there are you following me which said come up here and i will show you things which must have come brother branham help me revelation 10 1 and i heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet john was in the spirit and when he was he saw the great and wonderful day of the lord jesus and all his holy power the future was just about to unfold for god for god was about to teach him john did not say he was a trumpet he was like a trumpet now when a trumpet is blown he has an urgency about it it's like a heron the king's messenger coming to the people he blows on a trumpet it's an urgent call the people gathered to listen israel was always assembled by the sound of a trumpet something important is a hand listen to it so this voice had the same urgency of appeal as did the trumpet clear and sound and strong it was startling and awakening oh that we might hear the voice of who as this day are you there for it is the gospel trumpet so we have two kind of trumpet we have natural trumpet that are blown for the jews are you there but the church whatever happened to israel natural happened to the church spiritually are we building together it's the gospel trumpet sending forth the word of prophecy to make us aware of or prepare and prepare for what is coming upon thee earth brother branham the same voice that simon john come up the same voice that said to john come up is the same voice that's come on the church someday amen someone the church also the same voice that summoned john to come up that's revelation 4 1 is the same voice that summons the dead dead lazarus out of the grave that same voice is of the archangel remember brother branham was irish remember last sunday and we found out that micah the archangel was irish christ is the voice of the archangel voice of the archangel see oh that show that voice of who praise the lord not brother stephen saved that's the same thing that takes place right here the church was taken up into heaven and john now is brought up with it with it as a top of the resurrected as we took it last night and found out that this same voice that summon him to look back on earth revelation 1 10 was the same voice that summoned him to come up revelation 4 1 every christian the very voice charlie that summon you one day down there in kentucky to turn around is the same voice that shall summon you come up in other words the same god that spoke to you and turn you again is the same god that's gonna kill you out of the rapture are you there the same cable the same camera that rebecca gave water is the same camera that carried rebecca to her husband are you there aren't you glad of that brother evans the voice that said turn around the voice that caught you out of babylon into this message is the same voice that's going to take you in the rapture what a reality clear distinct like a trumpet turn around serve me after you finish serving him come up to where i am are you there no problem brother bottom says here that a trumpet to represent war a seal a mystery unfolding and a plague is what follows every war in other words it follows the trumpet now and by god's help and with the book of history i can prove to you that we are living at the there is seven trumpet in revelation 10. there is also seven trumpet in revelation 11. seven trumpet for the seventh plug and the seventh still to be open and the seventh vowed to be poured out nice job here the sounding of the trumpet means gospel trumpet that's to the church and the standing of a trumpet in the bible means get ready for scripture so israel when a trumpet sounded to him he was to get ready for a natural war but to us when he signed it is to get ready for a scriptural world are you getting it down scripture world paul said if you want to put it down first corinthians 14 8 paul say if the trumpet gives her certain son how will a man know what to prepare for if he does not have a scriptural son vindicated vindication of the word of god made manifest how will we know we are in the end time take jeremiah ford we cannot rush with this you heard trump a trumpet trumpet trumpet jeremiah 4 verse 19 if you dare you can say amen everybody there my power my bowel i am panicked at my very heart my heart making noise in me i cannot hold my peace because you have heard all my soul the sound of what few people are you there because you have heard the sound of the command the alarm of what so when brother branham said trumpet mean to all did he give you the scripture when the prophet speak open your ears and listen are you there clear here in the bible and clearly in the message the bible say brother branham say are you there first corinthians 14 paul said that if a trumpet gives her an uncertain son who shall prepare are you there so brother branham just told us that that was a spiritual world all right now and then because the trumpet sounds at the same time the seals it's just the same thing the church ages just the same thing now a trumpet always did not work we saw it otherwise political disturbance so when you see war it is trumpet standing but those war must be connected to israel i'm going slowly the trumpet does a political disturbance and that causes war when you go to messing in politics and get all them messed up like we gathered now look at worries at hand but see because the kingdom belongs still belong to satan all right the trumpet means political disturbance world matthew 24 jesus spoke of you shall hear war and rumors of war all the way down through it was rumors or wars and rumors and wars and plum on down to the end now that is trumpet standing not every war is a trumpet that war must be connected to israel we shall go back there and pick up each one of them wars and show you that follow them churches show you they follow this seal to save time now wins the four wins in the bible means war and 11 years 11 months 11 this 11 this the first world war right like in jobs time you remember winds came down and took the sun and you know what it means it's trouble on the fork on four corners of the earth holding the four wings speaking about the angels in other words here went the wings blowing in the walls and stuff that come all over the world when did that ever happen never until the first world war so when you see the first world war striking cleaning up the land of israel the second world war striking mussolini italy killing the jewish people though i trumpet something but he hits israel naturally everybody there now those trumpets were made of her ramshorn and rhymes if you look at that we spoke in the zodiac of aries you should be comfortable with the zodiac here he spoke of the depths of rem a way must be killed and deliver his own are you there and we know that jesus was the realm of god that came and was killed at the cross what does a ram means and what has a a horn means notice there is seven horns on this lamp did you notice it having seven holes we've been just through that horns means what to the animal job down here a ram he had to be a ship a man a ram type of who so a rams speak of the power of christ [Music] take romans chapter one i prayed god at home that he won't be tedious romans chapter 1 verse 18. if you dare you can say amen are you there every time you come to church make sure you get your bible romans 1 verse 18 for the wrath of god let me see 16 okay thank you for i am not a shame of the gospel of what [Music] okay for it is that the power of god are you there so the power of god is the gospel of jesus christ and the trumpet were made out of ram horns which is the power of christ so the trumpet is a gospel trumpet what a brand i've never explained you he was in the bible take first corinthians chapter one sooner we're going to navigate and move on first corinthians chapter one if you're there you can say amen verse 18 for the preaching of the the cross speak of the depths of the realm remember the cross means the ram christ is killed you see that and the horn is released so the preaching of the cross are you there is to them that perish foolishness but to us with yourself it is the power of god amen everybody clear jump to verse 24. but to them that are called both jew and greek crushed their power off so the rams on spoke of the power of christ which is the gospel that's why brother branham said a trumpet means god's spell we clear all right now when a trumpet blast everybody here the noise of the trumpet is called a trump a trumpet is an instrument that trump is the sound of the voice of the trumpet take first corinthians right there verse chapter 15 if you dare you can say amen verse 51 are you there behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all should be changed in a moment in the tweaking of an eye at the last if you say the last trump that means that they were reviews trumps so somebody bloom somebody blew somebody blue then the last trump you cannot have lust without first but god emphasized about the resurrection that is connected only to the last trump when he shall begin to are you are you there take first thessalonians 4. same thing over again if you're there you can say amen we're going to score sooner chris alone in chapter 4 verse 16. are you there for the lord himself shall be sent from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the what everybody clear everybody here so that trump of god is always connected to the resurrection and we know first thessalonians 4 happened in our day when the mighty engine came down with a shot with a voice and a champ off but if you remember in jericho there were seven priests going with also trumpet now it's clear right in jericho we found out that the city of jericho god told israel when you get into that city pick up four medals for me are you there you take gold you take silver you take breasts and you take karen are you there if you go to daniel chapter 2 you found out that the image of daniel have all those four kingdoms put it down you can read it at home are you there and those kingdoms were the world kingdom but they all fall were found in jericho you following me gentile kingdom so jericho gentile that seven priests must blow seven trumpet are you following me god was babylon silver middle person brush grease iron and in the bottom iron mixed with clay branham we could go back to daniel and get the image look at the image the head of gold the babylonian kingdom brass silver meadows and persian brass alexander the great which is greek and so forth the grecian kingdom then the roman empire eastern and west rome the two feet down here there was iron and clay mixed together and that iron come from the legs which was wrong and there is a church so we found out here that the four kingdom were in jericho are you following me then on daniel 7. let's read this let's go to daniel chapter seven see why you need to read your bible then it's gonna click quickly daniel chapter seven if you dare you can say amen daniel seven verse one the bible said the first year of beltazer king sausage of babylon then daniel had a dream and a vision upon his head on his bed then he wrote the dream and told the mother thereof let's go on verse three and four beasts came up from the sea that verse one from another the first was like huh so we have four beasts here the first beast was like a lion you can remember this praise god job on verse 5 and behold another beast a second was like here there verse six and after disability law and now they like hell so we have a lion we have a bear we have a leopard now verse seven and after this i saw in the night vision and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible strong exceedingly and had great eye on teeth which beast we don't know the first lion the second bear the third leopard but the fourth no it's a mystery it's a mystery to daniel not john are you there go to revelation 13. if you're there you can say amen revelation 13 verse 1 and i stood upon the sea and saw a beast was up out of the sea having seven hounds seven heads and ten horns and upon his ten horns crown at his tent his horns ten ten clans and upon his head the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like uh and his feet were like a feet of air and his mouth as the mouth of her so here john saw those three separate beasts mixed together into one remember when we went through the seal we have the white horse rather than the red then the black but the pearl horse was a mixture of the tree are you there brother branham the dragon we got two things under consideration now watch this beast he had four different characters in it if you shall take daniel 7 which we went through you the marking down daniel 7 daniel saw the same vision 800 years before saw the vision he saw those beasts separate one from another in the beginning of the gentile ruling are you there john seeing it at the end of the gentile ruling all four beasts represented in so the meaning what happened in jericho here is the top of the end time of the gentiles are you there where the four kingdoms are gathered together in one place you're following me let me skip that one now when aiken stole the stuff in the camp they can stop three things but one of them was a babylonian government you can check your scripture yourself what i'm trying to point out here is jericho represent the end time under rome dominion everybody clear where are we going on so we have a pattern now when they're still broke in heaven a thunder is revealed are you following me this standard contain a message that the messenger of the edge comes and catches the revelation and he blows the trumpet everybody there when he blows the trumpet that trump at his gospel trumpet he declares war we follow me war between the children of god and the children of satan it is a scriptural world now we get it there then god will send his anointing are you there to anoint his children and the devil also will send his anointing to anoint his camp when god finished his message his children will which are the wheat and they are the children which are details god gather his children together and take them away and he drop a plug on the other one or a file what i'm trying for you to remember is a plug is dropped upon those that rejected the message where do you get this stuff here is the plan of it the first thing happened there is an announcement in heaven first what happened a seal is open what is it a mysteries are for and when a mystery unfold then a trumpet sound he declared whoa a plug fall and the church opened you've seen where i stand i usually make my slide according to brother branham what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed that's why paul said i preached in part all messenger part part part part but at the last time elijah must come and we stole our own things are you there he catches the mystery of god then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and what does he start a war a spiritual war and then god take his messenger with the elect of that age lay them away asleep and then he dropped the plug upon those who rejected a temporary judgment then after that is over then he goes the denominator and bringing the nomination by the brandon sales deal with religious disturbance a seal is open a message is dropped and when that will message drop down their message that messenger goes forth and shake them to pieces that's why it's a religious despair the disturbance when a seal is open that's what happened the first messenger and he preached and a trumpet standing the trumpet was declaring war trumpet always did not work the messenger the engine come on earth the messenger of the hour like looter like any of the messenger that we talk of what does he do here rav a seal is open with you a trumpet war declared a way they go and the messenger dies and it still awaits this group they put it in a plaque fall upon those who rejected plague fall upon those who rejected paul was the first messenger when the first trumpet standed and the first seal was told lose paul was the first messenger as we found out declared war the orthodox church for not believing the messianic son that jesus had produced to them he blasted those synagogues from place to places with the scripture and was put out of every one of them till finally he shook the dust from off his feet and turned to the gentile what is it standing off shopping an angel messenger standing there with the word don't you miss that now the word and paul with the are not an adulterated interpretation of god's word blasted every one of them synagogue everybody clear okay until he come to the last angel so there was a first trumpet by paul a second trumpet arenas a third trumpet columba then it goes all the way to the last shopping until he comes to the last trumpet now he had no certain mysteries how was this justification period wesley sanctification period pentecost restoration of this period but the seven ninja you cannot stop him in one thing he gathered up all that has been lost in their middle ages all the truth that was not truly revealed yet because they all preach in part as the revelation come then we reveal those things in his day revelation 10 1-4 text the book and seal and break them and show the seven angel for this alone not everybody else the mystery of god is the ministry of the seven angel this angel's message of the seventh church all right reveal all the mystery that has been passed all the things passed revelation 10 1 through 7 in the days of the seven angel he's standing forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet not the jewish one this is poor upon those that reject the message what are you trying to say in revelation 5 verse 6 the bible said that there is a ram there you can look at that at home they say that the ram have seven ohms and those horns have seven eyes what does the horn represent seven ohms was the seven [Music] the seven church ages because that was the lamb's protection what he protected his right with for nerf was god said group of people that protected seven eyes are the seventh messenger of the seven churches drop down here the seven eyes ice means sing sing means prophet seer this lamb had seven horns and on each horn had seven eyes what is it christ and his brother the seventh churches praise the lord so these represent the blood of christ you remember the two sticks there is a cross right there are you there which is the dispensation of the seven church angel with what seven eyes which are there that's why in jericho are you there there were seven priests blowing seven trumpets are we clear together now brother branham said that the seven homes represent the seven churches in other words every horns was a church but are you ready the trumpet also was a horn in other words the church the true brother is the horn of the messenger made flesh what are you saying it's god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his brother for the bread and the husband is the same self flesh these two are and the church is becoming the bread all the time by believing that as you receive the message you become the message you are what you eat are you there we see the bride uniting uniting with the word why the word is god as the brotherhood being the word and the broad bringer he of the world they come together in union they unite like a wedding they are getting ready for wedding they become one the world becomes you and you become the world are you there that's why the horn and the horn of the messenger are the same thing jesus had perfect faith he had it he come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the so that's why the horn of the messenger are nothing but what the material the blood is made out of it you are the message of your day are you there then in jericho there is seven horns seven messenger going around the city are you there and we found out that there was an army on the front and there was an army on the back but the front of me was judah are you there and judah was a lion and the last time it was done which was an ego and the first messenger was paul under the lion anointing and the last one was brother brown up under the ego and nothing are you there salute the power one day he marched the city luther one day westlake one day but the seven ninja he must go seven times to pick up everything that paul left that we are in this level that colombia and gather everything together for the bride praise the lord [Music] are we clear together the first day one time the second day one time but the seventh day he must go to paul and pick up what's not left pick up this one left pick up what this one left one two three four five six seven then you can shout [Applause] [Music] are you there are you there so we have an army here and they normally behind praise the lord what was banned at pentecost is bound forever that's the reason the blood coming in re-preview the second the bride the army on world cruise stand it was an army that passed before but they have to be another army at the end time that must come again that's why there was an army and the army paul and brother branham they're two prophets moses and elijah i heard it coming again and coming up on this side come the same pride that went around this way here come the little ladies again and each one of them was dressed in the national garb from where they come from like switzerland germany and so forth each one wearing that kind of garb all the way all along here just exactly like them first one and here they were coming onward christian that's why joshua say only the soldier they are marching around jericho onward christian soldier only soldiers the soldier of paul but the last hero guard is the ego he's dead are you there but when those of paul went they only turn around behind brother branham but when the second group come brother branham said they start to going right into the in other words the last one are the one that's going to initiate the rapture are you there what is wrong with this trumpet let's go to revelation 8 and we're going to drop sooner revelation eight so you understand now the trumpet that sounds in the churches for the gentile paul had his trumpet arrenius is trumpet columba is trumpet all the way to brother branham there's election 10 seven belong to brother branham he gotta go all the mysteries the seven thunder seven times you gotta go around the city and then the wall of babylon are broken so this message was built to destroy the nomination when you start building denomination around this message you make it even more powerful because he was built to entire denomination are you there czech revelation chapter eight everybody there we have seven angel there brother michael and they also have seven trumpet who are they everybody here remember when paul blow the trumpet it is a spiritual war are ready to blow the trumpet spiritual war but when the trumpet hit the israel nature okay let's go revelation 8 chapter six and the seven angels which had said trumpet prepared themselves to sound the first angel sounded and they follow hell and fire mingling with blood and they were cast upon the earth so the first trumpet affected the earth everybody clear on my board clear there jump to verse 8. and the second angel sounded anywhere as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the so the second trumpet affected the sea everybody clear job to verse uh job to verse 10. and the third edge just sounded brother michael and they felt a great start from heaven burning as he wear a lamp and he fell upon the third part of there so the third trumpet affected what everybody clear on the board watch verse 11 and the name of the star was wormwood so in here there is a star that appeared here his name is wormwood which is the star that affected the waters are you there now let's go to verse 12. and the fourth angel standing and the third part of the sun this angel affected what everybody clear with me on the board let's go to chapter nine verse one and the fifth vengeance standing and as foreign from heaven to the earth and to him was giving the key to the bottomless pit so here there was a ninja falling down from heaven brother branham said that angel was lucifer because the bible said how have that fallen from heaven heaven or lucifer a falling angel everybody there we clear now job to verse 14. and the six angels sounded and i heard the voice of the fall from the forehound of the golden altar which is before god saying oh i'm sorry yes 13 13 saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet lose the four engine which are bound in the great river what so this engine affected what you see your trumpet now in revelation 11 watch he stopped at the sixth trumpet and he never touched the seven are you there then revelation 10 stop them with another trumpet these are the mathematics of god you need a prophet are you there now in revelation 11 verse 15 we saw that the seven angel dropped and when he affected there on verse 19 we found out that the temple of god was open you remember and the ark of the covenant was seen right everybody there let's go to revelation 16. so this is a platform for next sunday are you ready now we're almost dropping to the airport revelation 16 verse one you might have to go home and review this verse 1 and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angel going away and pour out the vows of the wrath of god upon the earth over there there were seven india with seven trumpets but over here there are seven ninja with seven plug who are these angel are you there let's go to verse one and the first one and pour out his vows upon thee few people watch your bible upon thee are we okay let's go to verse three and the second edger pour out his eyes upon

the fifth angel poured his vow upon the seat of the the pope which is the devil incarnated are you there are you there because he comes from the bottomless pit let's go to verse 12. and the six angel poured out his val upon the great what watch your board why is these things like this why are they like that let's go to verse 17. and the seven angel poured out his va into the air and there came a great voice out of thee from the saying it is the trumpet are reflecting the vow are you there but we know that devours our gentle judgment when the seal broke a thunder is revealed a messenger come he pick up the thunder blow the trumpet called the elect of god those who rejected the message evaluates why are the gentile judgment reflecting the jewish calling why take galatians 3. so today you know the difference that revelation 10 7 belongs to the gentile and that seven angel of revelation 11 is not for the gentile let's go to galatians 3 and then we're going to drop at the airport if you dare you can say amen galatians 3 3 verse 10 for as many as are of the work of the i'm waiting for somebody who are still working on me are you there for as many as out there of the work of the are under there god came to monsanto and gave israel opportunity to receive the grace of god are you there israel rejected and said ah we want the law and matter of fact when you talk to us always use a prophet and when the law came he put israel under a curse are you there and the curse for it is written curses everyone that continues not in all which are written in the book of the law but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the judge shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that does them shall live in them christ has redeemed from the curse of the law so when christ was coming he was coming to remove the curse of the law but israel rejected christ are you there from the curse of the law being made a curse for us the sixth seal he made the cross you remember for it is written curses everyone that is hanging on a tree so those that are under the law are under earth curse now let's go to matthew 27. this is where we're gonna see why is god talking to israel in judgment are you there once god sends a message if you reject the message of god god don't talk to you anymore by grace he talk to you by whooping are you there go turn the water off if you go do it no problem if you say ah then daddy pulled the belt the belt is love but it is a language that is painful bringing you into obedience to what you rejected matthew 27 verse 20. you don't pay your tax no problem he pulled the belt car broken down supervisor angry at you you turn around kids sick when you learn that language the first thing tight he's bringing you to the same thing but by whooping are you there verse 20 he's preaching on top they go to the church building verse 26 chapter 27 verse 20. but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for who and destroy who these are the jews doing that they go from the answered and said to them whether of the two were you that are released to you they say barabbas he was a murderer pilate said to them what shall i do then with jesus which is called cross they all say to him let him be crucified and the governor said why in other words they are still pleading with israel are you there why what evil have he done but they cry lord the most saying let him be crucified so god is pulling block he spoke to the wife of palette and the wife of pilate came and said don't play around with this man and pilate politically is playing to stop them still israel is attacking attacking who the messiah are you there when pilate saw that he could not prevail nothing but that rather the turmeric was made he took water and washed his hand before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this judgment see you to him watch now then answer some of the people all the people and say his blood be upon us and upon our in other words willfully israel say curse us i send the messiah the lord your god will send you a prophet like unto me john the baptist came and present the messiah israel said kill him israel rejected the messiah now listen close let's turn to matthew 24 and here is where israel made the federal mistake here is where she done here so israel rejected god no problem god sent judges rejected no problem because jesus was giving the pharisee a parable he says that there was a man that owned a vine and he left the vine to some people and he began to send them servant do you know that parable when he sent the first debate him send the second they kill him send the third and men say let me send my only son maybe when they see him they will listen when they send they say oh the air is coming let's do what jerusalem jerusalem how many times have i tried to hover you as a hand but you would not you the one that killed the prophet and i sent you myself for the last time the last hope you destroyed that's why brother branham said the last sin and the reason she is in the condition today matthew 27 verse 25 that's the reason why deval is speaking to israel that's why god is speaking to the jewish true whooping because they are under a curse he's not going to come and preach to the jewish he just anointed italy italy kill them and bring them to the promised land until that curse is removed and that curse will be removed under the last angel which is the spirit of grace going to israel to remove the ungodliness from jacob are you there the brother of joseph sold him and joseph went to egypt and marry a gentle wife and god turned farming on and famine was what brought the brother of joseph back to him but benjamin was born after benjamin was innocent of the sin but the crop of joseph was put in benjamin he was blamed for something he did not do that's why zachariah said they will ask him where did you get this wound we were not there he said in the house of my friend he took the cup in benjamin to bring them but before joseph revealed to his brother he told his brother get out of here are you there because at the beginning he was talking to them through interpret and brother branham said a prophet is an interpreter of the world he will talk to them first through moses and elijah interpreted are you there when naomi left the promised land his her husband died children died trumpet standing whooping naomi and when naomi found out that there's no way she begins to go back and suffering as she go back roof is behind there are you there are you there that's why revelation 10 hooked between revelation 11 roof stepping when they got to israel instead of powers being attracted to naomi which they are blood family the eyes of god left revelation 11 he began to look at that woman saying she looked good he went to the gentle woman that's why revelation 10 is before revelation 11 are you there it's a language to the jews to us it is the vow he's talking to them as a vow because they rejected the messiah this trumpet standing is not for the gentile for the jews our trumpet is our seventh messenger that goes around jericho what are we talking about in revelation 10 there is a cloud that came down this cloud was made of seven angel are you there on the earth it was enough free angel are you there i have to sound the trumpet among those seven angels one of them was the mighty angel in revelation 11 there is a seven ninja off the trumpet of the jews are you there and that angel also have two men these are human they are earthly this i'm gonna skip those scriptures these are human they are earthly men this engine is not human are you there he's a heavenly angel this is a heavenly angel this is a human ninja this is a heavenly angel this is a human angel if you look here there is one and one here there is one and two in the book of daniel there was one and two are you there what are you saying heavenly earthly one of the seven ninja was one over there he was crossed the one with the seven still that was bursting his chest like this that's why brother branham say all the six were familiar in other words i already know what paul preached i already know what aren't you spiritual i already know what columba preached i already know what luther preached i already know whatever pentecostal saying i just need something different than him when he look he see one looking at him right there but what i'm saying that's the stuff i was looking for all my life that was the one week there seven still are you there and these angels also are seven we just saw them with seven trumpets these also were seven one of them were crossed these are seven one of them have a big trumpet but he worked with two men he bring you to daniel 12 where there is one angel who work with two men if you look there is a river one man is on this side one is on this side if you remember you ready elijah cross jordan do you remember he hit the mountain and crossed jordan moses never crossed jordan he stayed outside of the promised land that's why one angel is there and another angel is there are you there are you there in revelation 10 when when that engine came down one foot on the earth one foot under there was a beast coming out of the earth he blocked it there is a service coming out of the water he broke it but when the bride is gone the tribulation period starting he remove his foot from the earth are you there and he put both feet right here because he need to crush babylon but the mark of the beast will be given in the tribulation period releasing america to give the mark of the beast are you there are you there so this center is what we call is nothing but this one going to the jewish people you follow me and this angel is this guy right here he was the one in the cloud here he's the same one in the cloud of seven engine here when he's here he's called the seventh seal when he's over there he's called the seventh trumpet are you there the same child a roof gave to birth naomi took that child with her and begin to nurse her because the seventh seal is the seventh trumpet to the bride when rachel is birthing benjamin rachel died she moved out of the sin and a hundred and forty four thousand ushering are you there praise the lord are you there so revelation 10 revelation 10 7 revelation 10 11 is this angel he always have two people messenger two people this ninja two people it is that same angel who's blowing the trumpet to the jews to remove the curse are you there from the jewish people and to give them the baptism of the holy ghost this seven angel is brother branham this is the seven engine which is the seventh trumpet to the jews it is not the same thing next time we're gonna see who is the angel with the vast let's stand so if you get on the internet and somebody begin to tell you revelation 10 doesn't belong to us give him the link if they say malachi 4 doesn't belong to us you have 19th sermon are you there if they say revelation 10 7 doesn't belong to you give him the link he need to check his scripture they are trumpet for jews he affected the jews naturally they are trumpet for the he affected the bread spiritually seven trumpets for the bread which are the seven messenger and seven trumpet for the jews which are the angel trying to bring israel back to the promised land but under whooping because israel rejected the messiah god would talk to them through judgment he will always anoint whooping until the last one i will open a fountain in the house of david and i will drop the spirit of grace upon the house of david to do what the six-fold purpose of daniel to remove the transgression ungodliness from israel then the eyes of the jews will wake up like what did we do you killed the messiah are you there but he would tell them don't do it you have to do it to save the gentile i have to go joseph have to be sold to save everybody are you there you did it you were blind that's why they are souls under the altar waiting for the hundred and forty four thousand to receive the holy ghost are you there and the cells under the altar need the resurrection and the only ministry that have a resurrection this time is our ministry which have the voice of the archangel that's why he deal with the bride move here completely out of the way then he goes to the jews not only to remove the curse but to pull those in the fifth dimension out and to resurrect all of them so they're gonna be with us in the millennium let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace you love your mercy father i never even thought i'm gonna be able to finish this sermon but by your grace father you answer my prayer and you open up the doors that this can be established from this church father if there is any question there should be an answer a question was lord father brought to this church and we know how the devil is attacking lord father every kind of way but you spoke to us through the prophet that the only way you defeated the devil lord father when he attacked you was by the word that's why we gave the word to your people because when the devil attacked you you always say it is written it is written it is written you went back to the word to show that any christian when they can cling to your word lord father they can defeat the devil anywhere any place under any circumstances we gave this word going lord by a teaching to make sure people get it and they understand lord because you say when the foundation are shaken what will they just do that's why we went back to the foundation explaining showing clearly the difference between this angel and i know that you the holy ghost you can lord unfold this beyond what we even look at father we ask you lord father that you be merciful to us lord may nobody lord father fall under the whooping but may we be children of god and the obedience lord that when you speak we listen lord we don't want to go through the hard hand lord father the jewish were been killed the jews were being cremated but lord your prophet said that he was the tender hand of man of jehovah how can that be a tender hand it was you through love of a father rebuking your son by just trying to bring him back to where he can get redemption even the prophet in the old testament whenever somebody was dying they always requested to be buried in the promised land because they knew that the messiah come and this end time lord father you knew that israel was scar the lord you didn't want to leave them out of the promised land and you sanded the trumpet to bring them back home it was hard it was difficult lord but redemption have to happen there under the ministry of moses and elijah father you send us our ministry which is malachi 4 we cherish it lord because we know this is the message that will take us home may we always lord respect keep lord our eyes our mind center into this message lord giving the message a higher respect and preeminence in our life knowing like that the message that we cherish today is the same that will take us home father we thank you and we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you brother [Applause] it's better and better and better amen better you know i thought i
