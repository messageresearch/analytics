[35:41] heart or the new spirit i don't know
[35:43] what troubled him
[35:44] [Laughter]
[35:47] i know for sure he doesn't like the
[35:49] clarity on the new birth
[35:52] he wants people to get confused
[35:54] until you don't know what is the holy
[35:56] ghost how to receive it what happened in
[35:59] your new birth he doesn't want it
[36:02] he put all the confusion around this
[36:04] thing for years and years we don't
[36:07] understand brother branham spoke a new
[36:09] heart and the youth spirit by the brand
[36:11] i'm saying you need to have the holy
[36:13] ghost then you need to have the baptism
[36:14] of the holy ghost until you don't know
[36:16] what's going on but today it's a
[36:18] different story amen you're not the only
[36:21] one learning i am learning myself
[36:24] i see thinks that i've never seen before
[36:27] amen
[36:28] now you understand that justification
[36:31] does a lot
[36:32] than just being justified amen being
[36:35] justified means a lot of things he kills
[36:38] the law
[36:39] he stopped the law he changed the
[36:42] priesthood for you he even changed the
[36:44] law from the law of moses to the law of
[36:47] jesus christ

[40:58] i just want to
[40:59] say i'm honored and privileged to be
[41:01] here this evening i thank you for the
[41:03] invitation to come brother stephen you
[41:05] know i must admit when i when i first
[41:07] came here
[41:09] and you know i brother i already feel
[41:11] insufficient enough as it is but and i'm
[41:13] going to tell one on myself it's going
[41:15] to make me look real bad but i don't
[41:17] care
[41:17] but when i got here you know and i was
[41:19] waiting for brother tim to get up and
[41:21] brother stephen gets up man and he's
[41:24] he's wearing that bible out he's got
[41:25] scripture scripture and he's tying it
[41:27] all together and he's putting all these
[41:28] types together and everything and i feel
[41:30] so insufficient watching him doing that
[41:33] one my brother and i'm so nervous i
[41:34] think i built up a complex brother
[41:36] stephen
[41:37] because you know i'm like i'm like
[41:39] brother branham you know i always say
[41:41] you know i don't know the scripture real
[41:43] well but i know the author well brother
[41:44] stephen knows them both
[41:46] and and i was like goodness gracious
[41:49] so
[41:50] when i got you know then brother i was
[41:52] just i guess i built a complex there and
[41:54] i was so nervous you know
[41:56] i don't really know why but i was and i
[41:58] was sitting there going man i you know
[42:00] you just it really humbled me and it
[42:02] really gave me and i'm not just trying
[42:03] to lift him up because he let me preach
[42:05] this is my heart now you don't you don't
[42:07] think none of that that ain't my heart
[42:09] or my goal i'm just telling you the
[42:10] impression that i had of the church when
[42:12] i came
[42:14] and and you know i was so nervous after
[42:16] watching him and you know he's tying all
[42:18] these scripture together and everything
[42:19] else and i can't even find ezekiel in my
[42:21] bible when tim
[42:22] calls for ezekiel
[42:24] and i'm sitting there going i've turned
[42:26] to it a thousand times why can't i find
[42:28] it you know
[42:29] so i was just and then you know just the
[42:32] so at the end of the service i was
[42:33] saying lord i'm so insufficient don't
[42:35] let him ask me to pray
[42:38] lord do not let him ask me to pray
[42:41] and he said brother seth will you come
[42:43] oh man
[42:44] so i start working my way up here and i
[42:46] don't know what i just did but
[42:48] that'll be all for the music by the way
[42:50] but i start working my way up here and
[42:52] i'm nervous and then he says brother
[42:54] seth come pray and then he said
[42:55] something about another brother seth and
[42:57] i say good lord am i even supposed to be
[42:59] the one up here praying
[43:00] i don't know what's going on and about
[43:02] the time i get up here and this is just
[43:04] something else too you know we uh

[43:08] ain't as tall as brother shango so i got
[43:10] up here behind i'm used to a pulpit

[43:15] thing's up to my chest and i'm like i
[43:16] don't even deserve it i can't even feel
[43:19] this spot and but i'll tell you what

[47:46] to you in the name of the lord jesus
[47:47] christ we pray
[47:49] you may be seated i'd like to
[47:51] read that again
[47:53] and we'll start
[47:54] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[47:56] from the west and his glory from the
[47:57] rising of the sun i want to read this
[47:59] part when the enemy shall come in like a
[48:02] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[48:05] up a standard against him
[48:08] i'd like to read a quote here
[48:10] now god cannot make a decision today and
[48:13] tomorrow and come back with a make a
[48:15] better decision tomorrow
[48:17] because his first decision is perfect
[48:20] his first decision is perfect he never
[48:23] has to change it so therefore we can
[48:25] rest upon whatever god says is that
[48:27] right that's the reason that i believe
[48:30] the bible
[48:31] is god's word now the reason i believe
[48:35] that god has to judge the world by some
[48:38] standard now tonight we're going to be
[48:40] preaching on the standard tonight and if
[48:43] and if it's my church which one is it
[48:45] see there's hundreds of them in
[48:46] different churches and organizations and
[48:48] lutherans say we have it and the
[48:50] baptists say no we got in the press the
[48:52] presbyterians say we got it and the
[48:54] pentecost will say no this is it and
[48:56] nazarene say no this is it he said you'd
[48:58] be confused but you see it's the word i
[49:02] just believe it's the word see just take
[49:05] it the way it's wrote and believe it
[49:09] just take it the way it's wrote and
[49:13] believe it
[49:14] and it's of no private interpretation it
[49:17] says it's just written there
[49:20] and there's only one way this is another
[49:22] quote there's only one way that you can
[49:23] ever know that you're right stay with
[49:26] god's eternal blueprint
[49:29] stay with the word what god says that's
[49:32] right don't take nothing less or nothing
[49:35] more why should we have substitutes for
[49:38] this
[49:40] that and the other when god's word is
[49:43] full of promises i want you to know fool
[49:46] what does that mean look here church
[49:48] it's full
[49:49] it's full it's not lacking anything this
[49:51] bottle is full
[49:53] this evening it is full of promises yes
[49:55] sir we don't take any substitutes this
[49:58] is the truth god keeps his word no
[50:00] matter how unreasonable it may seem god
[50:04] keeps his word i can say amen to that
[50:07] church of the living god
[50:08] hey man i better get my get my
[50:10] foundation started here before i get
[50:12] going but i just want to get going
[50:14] matthew 24 35 heaven and earth shall
[50:16] pass away
[50:18] but my word shall not pass away
[50:21] so we can so i can say here to you if
[50:23] he's going to raise up a standard what
[50:24] is the standard this evening the
[50:26] standard is the word of god
[50:29] we have a standard here this scene and
[50:30] the other thing about the word of god
[50:32] the word of god is eternal it says
[50:34] heavens and earth will pass away and we
[50:36] know that that brother branham would
[50:38] look at that and he said i always
[50:39] wondered how how it would mean pass away
[50:41] and he said not pass away like a
[50:43] obliteration i believe he said but to
[50:45] change from one form to another but god
[50:48] is saying you know heavens and earth
[50:50] might change but my word will never
[50:52] change the eternal god when the eternal
[50:54] god makes an eternal promise you can
[50:56] hold on to that
[50:58] the problem that people have is they get
[51:01] stuck in this time listen church of god
[51:04] god's promises do not have a time
[51:06] element on them
[51:08] but they are yeah and amen you can grab
[51:10] a hold of any one of them you want and
[51:12] when the enemy comes in like a flood you
[51:14] can grab a hold of the standard and say
[51:17] satan you can't go any further
[51:20] glory to god
[51:24] but you know people are this is this
[51:25] message that i that the lord gave me
[51:27] this evening was actually the message
[51:29] that the lord put on my heart and
[51:30] brother abel can testify this when i was
[51:32] here with brother tim he said something
[51:34] that struck my heart and buddy i just
[51:36] started writing stuff down as fast as i
[51:38] could
[51:39] and you know i was beginning to think of
[51:40] that the standard the standard there's
[51:43] many standards and you know
[51:45] i'm a i myself am a cnc machinist and
[51:48] i'll make this as simple as i can
[51:50] because nobody ever hears about it or
[51:52] knows what it is
[51:53] but i i i have a
[51:56] they give me a part
[51:58] a piece of metal
[51:59] and they give me a print
[52:01] and they say seth we want you to program
[52:03] that machine to cut what's on this print
[52:07] on that part so by the time i get done
[52:08] with this chunk of metal it's going to
[52:10] look like this print right here
[52:12] so that's what i do and you know when i
[52:14] was thinking about that when i got the
[52:16] inspiration you know people are always
[52:18] trying to change the standard
[52:21] people why are denominations failing why
[52:23] are they not have revival why are things
[52:25] down because they put a period on the
[52:27] word of god
[52:28] they're they're not taking the word of
[52:30] god they're saying well you know the
[52:31] bible don't really mean that church of
[52:33] the living god when jesus himself says
[52:36] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[52:38] words shall not change and they're
[52:40] saying oh he doesn't really mean that
[52:42] the word don't really mean that i hope
[52:43] you know the word was made flesh and
[52:45] dwelt among us if you don't like
[52:47] something in this bible you might as
[52:48] well be cutting jesus's arm off brother
[52:52] because the word of god is the standard
[52:54] you know and i was thinking about that
[52:56] that there was once a time a long time
[52:59] ago that there was always this story at
[53:01] work and there was this guy that that he
[53:04] had a gauge to go into a part and the
[53:07] gauge was the standard and he had to
[53:09] modify the part he had to make the part
[53:12] to fit that gauge but you know what he
[53:14] did
[53:15] he took that gauge and he modified it to
[53:18] fit the part
[53:21] and you know he thought he did something
[53:22] great you know he got this part and the
[53:24] gauge wouldn't go in it so he just took
[53:26] the gauge over to the grinder cut off a
[53:28] little bit of here cut a little bit of
[53:29] word off here cut a little bit off there
[53:31] until it fit what he thought was right
[53:33] and he took it to the qc inspector
[53:36] and he said you know the part wouldn't
[53:38] fit but don't worry i ground down the
[53:41] gauge to make it fit
[53:43] and you should have seen the qc
[53:45] inspector's jaw drop
[53:47] you did what
[53:49] i took the gauge and i ground it down
[53:51] and now it fits in that part he said
[53:54] listen there is a great engineer
[53:57] somewhere that knew what he needed
[54:00] and he made that gauge specifically to
[54:03] fit that part
[54:05] in church of the living god he took that
[54:07] gauge he put his own ideas in it he put
[54:10] what he thought it should be and he took
[54:12] that gauge and he tried to stick it in
[54:13] that part and you know it might have fit
[54:15] his ideas but it didn't fit the original
[54:18] engineer's design
[54:22] glory to god
[54:24] satan might say you're sick but jesus
[54:26] said oh he said he's the god that
[54:28] healeth all thy diseases
[54:31] that's the standard
[54:32] that's the gauge
[54:34] oh church of the living god you know
[54:36] what he said you know what the qc
[54:38] inspector said about that part he said
[54:40] that part is dead and there's too many
[54:43] dead churches too many dead christians
[54:46] because they refuse to take the word of
[54:48] god as a standard
[54:50] you'll take your ideas you'll take how
[54:53] you're about where's brother robert adam
[54:55] i'll tell you what when i was back there
[54:56] i said brother robert pray for my
[54:58] shoulder my shoulder was hurting but he
[55:00] prayed for it i took the standard and
[55:02] now my shoulder is feeling pretty good
[55:04] brother rob
[55:05] because that's the standard that's the
[55:07] word of god
[55:13] if you ever got to change it hope this
[55:14] is all right brother if you ever got to
[55:16] change the word of god to fit your
[55:18] standard you need to raise your standard
[55:20] a little bit
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:26] numbers 12 25-33 this is the spies going
[55:30] out
[55:31] and when they return from search into
[55:33] the land 40 days and they went and came
[55:35] to moses and into aaron into all the
[55:37] congregation of the children of israel
[55:39] in the wilderness apparent to kadish and
[55:41] brought back word unto them and to all
[55:43] the congregation and showed them the
[55:44] fruit of the land
[55:46] just like the blueprint said it would be
[55:47] there
[55:48] and they told him and said we came into
[55:50] the land whether thou sentenced us and
[55:51] surely
[55:53] man that's crazy ain't it what god said
[55:55] was actually there
[55:58] and surely it floweth with milk and
[56:00] honey
[56:01] and this is the fruit of it nevertheless
[56:04] nevertheless
[56:06] the people be strong that dwell in the
[56:08] land and the cities are walled and very
[56:10] great and moreover we saw the children
[56:12] of enoch there and the amalekites dwell
[56:13] in the land of the south and the
[56:15] hittites listen the amalekites the
[56:18] hittites and the jebusites and the
[56:19] americas dwell in the mountains and the
[56:21] and the canaanites dwell by the sea
[56:24] and by the coast of jordan so it looks
[56:26] like they're surrounded on every side by
[56:28] evil in church if i ever could say that
[56:30] there was a time that we are surrounded
[56:32] by evil on every side it's in this
[56:34] layout of sin church age
[56:36] everywhere you look evil
[56:38] little demons big demons giant demons
[56:41] all around us but church you know what
[56:43] what their standard was they began to
[56:45] look at the problems they began to look
[56:47] at their ideas of it but caleb steps up
[56:50] and it said and caleb stealed the people
[56:52] caleb was about sick of their standard
[56:57] caleb stealed the people before moses
[56:59] and said let us go up at once and
[57:02] possess it for we are well able to
[57:05] overcome it
[57:07] caleb said i don't care what your
[57:09] standard is
[57:10] when god spoke through the prophet
[57:13] and when he made a promise and he said
[57:15] we can have that land
[57:18] those those those other spies they were
[57:20] looking at giants
[57:22] they were looking at the enemy
[57:25] they were looking at strongholds they
[57:27] were looking at everything
[57:29] but caleb was looking at the standard
[57:32] caleb was looking at the promise
[57:35] caleb didn't they said you know what
[57:37] they got they said we can't do it and
[57:39] they got wilderness but caleb said i can
[57:41] do it because god said i can and he said
[57:44] give me my mountain
[57:46] is there anybody willing this evening to
[57:48] say give me my mountain
[57:50] listen church
[57:52] this is your promised land right here
[57:55] there's a ton of promises in here
[57:57] there's some it's flown with milk and
[57:59] honey it's flowing with grapes but every
[58:01] devil out of hell is trying to tell you
[58:03] you can't have it you can't obtain it
[58:05] you can't get it but let me tell you
[58:07] something if you want to be like caleb
[58:11] give me my mountain
[58:13] when your shoulder hurts say brother
[58:15] give me my mountain
[58:16] [Music]
[58:17] and let me tell you something tonight
[58:19] when you don't feel like serving the
[58:21] lord give me my mountain

[58:28] evening
[58:29] i'm going to tell you something church
[58:30] of the living god
[58:32] if i can say it this way people say you
[58:34] know brother you're just you're just
[58:35] trying to get an amen
[58:39] i'm gonna be honest with you
[58:41] i am trying to get an amen
[58:45] i'm trying to get an amen for the king
[58:47] of kings the lord of lords
[58:50] i'm trying to get an amen for the one
[58:52] that died for you that took away your
[58:55] sin so that you could be here i ain't
[58:57] trying to get no amen for me
[59:00] i want to amen for the standard
[59:02] jesus christ
[59:04] the same yesterday today and forever
[59:10] when the enemy came in like a flood god
[59:13] still had a standard
[59:16] caleb was staying caleb and joshua were
[59:18] standing there and they said this is my
[59:20] land this is my inheritance and that's
[59:24] where you're at this evening every devil
[59:26] out of hell every devil in laodicea is
[59:28] trying to say you can't have it it ain't
[59:29] yours you won't make it oh come on
[59:31] church
[59:34] it's not going to be your land god's
[59:36] promises are eternal it's already your
[59:39] land
[59:40] brother branham said if jesus christ
[59:42] walked in here he could no more heal you
[59:45] because he's already healed you
[59:48] accept your healing
[59:50] can i tell you the standard of mark 16
[59:52] this evening
[59:54] brother there was a time that i hurt my
[59:55] back i was moving a grill and i hurt my
[59:57] back real bad
[59:58] and for about three years i had back
[1:00:00] problems
[1:00:01] and you know brother isaiah sheffield i
[1:00:03] don't know if any of you know him or not
[1:00:04] but he was preaching over at tim
[1:00:05] hayden's and i decided to go over and
[1:00:07] support him you know on the way there
[1:00:09] you know the enemy came in like a flood
[1:00:11] brother
[1:00:12] oh man i love this now i'm starting to
[1:00:14] see it everywhere
[1:00:15] the enemy came in like a flood on the
[1:00:17] way there and he began to say you know
[1:00:19] you've had back pain for too long
[1:00:22] you've had back pain for too long you
[1:00:24] know if the lord was going to heal you
[1:00:25] would have already had to do it because
[1:00:26] now it's really set in
[1:00:28] and then and you know being in and i say
[1:00:30] i don't know it's either the devil or
[1:00:31] you know it could have been my own mind
[1:00:32] because the carnal mind is an enemy
[1:00:34] against god
[1:00:35] and i was sitting there but you know i'm
[1:00:36] so glad there was something deeper down
[1:00:38] there and that's so real
[1:00:40] and it began to say what are you talking
[1:00:43] about
[1:00:44] and i began to say you know what god
[1:00:46] you're absolutely right if you want to
[1:00:48] heal me today or 20 years from now you
[1:00:50] can just as easily heal me
[1:00:53] because that's the standard that's mark
[1:00:54] 16. lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:00:57] recover
[1:00:59] and i went to that service that night
[1:01:01] and i was in there
[1:01:02] and he preached that does that serve
[1:01:04] that service looking from the right
[1:01:05] angle
[1:01:06] let me tell you something i wasn't
[1:01:07] looking from the right angle at first i
[1:01:09] was looking at what satan said look at
[1:01:10] what my cardinal mind said but when i
[1:01:12] began to look at the standard church
[1:01:14] when i began to change my focus and i
[1:01:16] began to look at that standard
[1:01:19] you know he he kind of said oh he gave
[1:01:21] he gave this little you know if anybody
[1:01:23] wants prayed for i'll pray for you and
[1:01:25] you know me i'm sitting back and i'm
[1:01:27] going man i should i should get prayed
[1:01:29] for but i miss my chance i said but god
[1:01:31] if you'll just have brother tim
[1:01:33] say something along the lines of
[1:01:35] somebody getting prayed for i said
[1:01:36] brother i'll be the first one in the
[1:01:38] pool
[1:01:39] i'll be the first one to jump in the
[1:01:40] pool and he came up and he said you know
[1:01:42] when atmosphere is like this people can
[1:01:43] be healed
[1:01:45] first one in the pool i was gonna get my
[1:01:47] blessing and he began to pray for me
[1:01:51] church three years of back pain
[1:01:53] every day going to sleep laying down
[1:01:54] waking up in back pain every day
[1:01:57] chiropractor couldn't fix me
[1:01:59] things couldn't fix me
[1:02:02] but glory to god there was one
[1:02:04] there was a greater there was a standard
[1:02:07] in the land
[1:02:08] and he began to lay hands on me and he
[1:02:10] began to pray and you know what i
[1:02:12] realized brother stephen i wasn't
[1:02:13] waiting for god to heal me god had
[1:02:15] already healed me
[1:02:17] he was just waiting for me to accept my
[1:02:19] healing and when i accepted my healing i
[1:02:22] walked away from that building
[1:02:24] and i haven't had back pain since
[1:02:28] because he's the standard the standard
[1:02:30] still holds
[1:02:36] there's promises
[1:02:39] if you've got some family in the land
[1:02:41] go get them
[1:02:43] it's your standard it's your promise
[1:02:46] it's yours
[1:02:50] confidence in
[1:02:53] oh brother
[1:02:55] if you wanted to see someone dancing you
[1:02:56] should have been in my study when i read
[1:02:58] this when i started thinking of the
[1:02:59] standard
[1:03:01] luke 1 37
[1:03:04] for with god
[1:03:06] some things are possible
[1:03:08] for with god
[1:03:10] nothing shall be
[1:03:13] impossible
[1:03:14] church of living god is about time we
[1:03:16] throw down our excuses
[1:03:20] oh somebody said something i hope this
[1:03:22] is okay
[1:03:23] somebody said something about me and you
[1:03:25] know i don't really know i don't want
[1:03:26] them to think i'm a hypocrite or
[1:03:28] something else
[1:03:29] i just want to say this this this this
[1:03:31] this evening
[1:03:33] are you really going to let let someone
[1:03:36] affect the way that you worship somebody
[1:03:38] that died for you
[1:03:40] are you really going to think well
[1:03:42] somebody across the building might think
[1:03:44] i'm just a little emotional and i'm not
[1:03:46] forget about that
[1:03:48] don't let the devil bring you down
[1:03:50] don't let the devil take your worship
[1:03:54] that worship belongs to god
[1:03:57] and you give it to him
[1:03:59] he rightly deserves it
[1:04:01] you know what you deserved and i deserve
[1:04:03] we deserve to die we deserve to go to
[1:04:05] hell but through grace and mercy he
[1:04:07] reached out and saved us so how much
[1:04:09] more can we worship him
[1:04:12] glory to god
[1:04:14] seth coffey good for nothing but he
[1:04:17] saved me by his grace
[1:04:19] it don't take much reason to worship
[1:04:21] jesus
[1:04:23] you start thinking about jesus you'll
[1:04:25] find some reason to worship him
[1:04:28] think about what he's done in your life
[1:04:30] think about when you were sick and he
[1:04:31] healed you think about when you were
[1:04:33] depressed and he gave you joy oh think
[1:04:35] about when you were distraught and he
[1:04:37] gave you that peace in your life it
[1:04:40] don't take much thinking to have a
[1:04:41] reason to worship jesus
[1:04:44] hallelujah
[1:04:47] glory to god
[1:04:54] hallelujah
[1:04:57] you show what confidence you have
[1:04:59] brother branham says you show what
[1:05:01] confidence you have in your doctor by
[1:05:03] taking his medicine
[1:05:06] you don't even know what it is
[1:05:10] you show your confidence in the doctor
[1:05:12] by submitting yourself to an operation
[1:05:15] you know when i was 16
[1:05:17] when i was 16 15 16 years old and i had
[1:05:20] that operation
[1:05:21] i never knew that man in my life i never
[1:05:23] seen him before
[1:05:25] but somebody told me
[1:05:27] that he was a medical expert and he was
[1:05:30] great at doing surgery
[1:05:32] so i put my confidence in him barely
[1:05:35] knew the man
[1:05:38] and you know what the funny thing was
[1:05:40] he didn't guarantee success
[1:05:44] but i still put my confidence in him
[1:05:50] and the doctor by submitting yourself to
[1:05:52] an operation that proves your confidence
[1:05:53] in the doctor
[1:05:56] but when it comes to christ
[1:05:59] you're scared to take him at his word
[1:06:04] here's a big amen from seth coffey
[1:06:07] been there before
[1:06:09] you're scared to take him at his word
[1:06:11] how is it
[1:06:12] faith is the victory
[1:06:15] you could submit your case to jesus
[1:06:17] christ tonight
[1:06:19] just submit your case to the doctor
[1:06:22] give me anything you want to lord
[1:06:25] you're the doctor on the case
[1:06:28] then you've got the victory
[1:06:32] church
[1:06:33] if we can trust a doctor that we barely
[1:06:35] know
[1:06:36] to do a major surgery on us or or give
[1:06:39] us a pill we don't even know what's in
[1:06:40] that pill
[1:06:42] we ain't got a clue i ain't against
[1:06:44] doctors y'all brother branham plainly
[1:06:46] taught that
[1:06:47] but
[1:06:48] we don't even know what they're giving
[1:06:50] us
[1:06:51] but let me tell you something
[1:06:53] if you took your hand on your left side
[1:06:55] and you felt that heartbeat right there
[1:06:57] there was someone greater that gave you
[1:06:59] that heartbeat
[1:07:01] there was someone greater through every
[1:07:03] trial of your life when you thought i
[1:07:06] don't see how i'm going to make it but
[1:07:07] you made it
[1:07:10] i don't see how i can make it through
[1:07:12] this but he brought you through it
[1:07:16] but we put more confidence in a doctor
[1:07:19] than we put in jesus christ
[1:07:22] that doctor didn't die for you
[1:07:24] that doctor didn't take stripes for you
[1:07:27] what jesus christ did and he's saying
[1:07:30] this evening i'm the standard
[1:07:32] just look to me
[1:07:34] don't look to the things of the world
[1:07:36] look to me
[1:07:38] glory to god
[1:07:42] know i started thinking of that can i
[1:07:43] just can i just give some testimony this
[1:07:45] evening
[1:07:46] you know i was thinking of that standard
[1:07:47] and there's a little there's a little
[1:07:49] boy back there
[1:07:50] and you know when he was born
[1:07:52] they did a test on his ears and they
[1:07:54] said one of his ears has failed
[1:07:57] and i would not have it
[1:08:02] that might have been what the doctor
[1:08:03] said but that wasn't my standard
[1:08:05] that wasn't my standard
[1:08:07] you know what i began to do i began to
[1:08:09] get out my phone and i began to play
[1:08:11] that song i speak jesus
[1:08:13] and i said boy you're going to hear the
[1:08:15] name of jesus
[1:08:17] if it's the last thing i do you're going
[1:08:18] to hear the name of jesus and we kept
[1:08:21] playing it and playing it and playing it
[1:08:23] and you know he had to come back later
[1:08:24] for you know actually he when he was
[1:08:26] listen they came back and they said
[1:08:27] we'll come back in an hour and test it
[1:08:29] again and he failed again
[1:08:32] i said those are lying vanities
[1:08:35] let me tell you something
[1:08:37] god prom this is this is a different
[1:08:38] testimony but god promised me that boy
[1:08:42] when i was in the mountains of virginia
[1:08:43] and i looked up at the sun coming over
[1:08:46] and i was so distraught i hope this is
[1:08:48] okay telling with my wife here but but
[1:08:51] but we went through a miscarriage and i
[1:08:52] was sitting there going god i don't
[1:08:54] understand this i don't know i said but
[1:08:56] god if you could just let me look in the
[1:08:59] message and let me see something god
[1:09:01] that would help me i just need it right
[1:09:03] now
[1:09:04] and i don't even know what tape it was
[1:09:06] or where i was but i scrolled through
[1:09:08] you know randomly scrolled pick one
[1:09:09] randomly it's called half through and
[1:09:11] and click play and it said now remember
[1:09:14] abraham had to wait for the promised son
[1:09:17] he had to wait for the promised son but
[1:09:20] it was a promise
[1:09:22] and i've seen the sun coming up i began
[1:09:24] to thank god your mercies are new today
[1:09:27] and i and i knew i was going to have a
[1:09:29] son because god promised me
[1:09:33] and as i would we did that early early
[1:09:35] tests to figure out what it was and i
[1:09:37] heard my wife upstairs and they said
[1:09:39] would you like to know what it is and
[1:09:40] she said yes and she's in the nurse said
[1:09:43] it's a boy
[1:09:45] and i begin to say praise god because
[1:09:47] church this is god's standard and he
[1:09:50] says in his word and whatsoever ye shall
[1:09:52] ask in my name that will i do if you ask
[1:09:55] anything in my name i will do it
[1:09:59] so i said forget what the doctor said
[1:10:01] the doctor ain't the standard
[1:10:04] and i prayed and i believed and she went
[1:10:06] back for the test and he passed with
[1:10:08] perfect hearing in both ears
[1:10:11] because jesus christ is the same
[1:10:13] yesterday today and forever that's why i
[1:10:16] believe this message brother it don't
[1:10:18] put god in a bag on day it don't put god
[1:10:21] in the future but he's a god of right
[1:10:23] now he's my god he's my portion he's my
[1:10:27] standard
[1:10:31] glory
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] hallelujah
[1:10:41] brother seth i'm sick in my body but he
[1:10:43] was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:10:46] was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:10:48] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:10:51] and with his stripes we
[1:10:54] are
[1:10:55] healed
[1:10:57] reach out and claim that promise in the
[1:10:59] name of jesus christ
[1:11:01] you ain't got to live with that devil
[1:11:04] that devil's on your land
[1:11:06] you ain't on his land he's on your land
[1:11:10] kill that devil
[1:11:13] he ain't got no right

[1:12:52] i got a little girl back there
[1:12:55] i think she took her out but i got a
[1:12:56] little girl back there three years old
[1:13:00] and she woke up in the middle of the
[1:13:02] night
[1:13:03] crying daddy my feet my feet
[1:13:06] and i went to grab her feet and she had
[1:13:07] a bump come up on her foot
[1:13:10] and it was swollen

[1:13:16] but i began to cry out
[1:13:19] and i said lord
[1:13:21] i really need you right now
[1:13:23] and i began to think of that captain
[1:13:25] that was on his deathbed

[1:13:31] taught me how to read isaiah 53 5
[1:13:34] and said he was wounded and you know the
[1:13:36] name for such and such transgressions

[1:13:45] but he was wounded
[1:13:46] for jolie faith coffee's transgressions
[1:13:50] he was bruised for jolie faith coffee's
[1:13:52] iniquities
[1:13:53] the chastisement of jolie's faith's
[1:13:56] peace was upon him
[1:13:58] and with those lovely stripes joe lee
[1:14:02] faith coffee is healed
[1:14:05] and buddy the presence of god came down
[1:14:07] in that room and that girl when i was
[1:14:09] praying as i was reading that scripture
[1:14:11] she was continuously getting louder in
[1:14:13] pain but when i said and by those lovely
[1:14:15] stripes joe lee faith coffee is healed
[1:14:18] she instantly stopped went to sleep i
[1:14:20] tried to feel swell and i tried to find
[1:14:23] that bump but it was nowhere to be found
[1:14:27] he said i am a he said he would be
[1:14:29] present when we needed him
[1:14:33] not a tomorrow help he's a help right
[1:14:35] now
[1:14:36] he's a help in this service when you
[1:14:38] need him
[1:14:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:40] forever you said seth
[1:14:44] but the body was declaring that she was
[1:14:46] sick
[1:14:48] yes but the standard declared that she
[1:14:50] was already healed
[1:14:54] when you don't change the standard
[1:14:56] you get the results
[1:15:04] and god wrought special miracles by the
[1:15:06] hands of paul so that from his body were
[1:15:08] brought unto him sick hanker the sick
[1:15:10] handkerchiefs of aprons and the diseases
[1:15:12] departed from them and evil spirits went
[1:15:14] out of them i hope this is okay this is
[1:15:16] just the way i felt led to preach this
[1:15:18] evening was to give some testimonies if
[1:15:20] you want me to be at home let's just be
[1:15:21] at home
[1:15:23] we're all a part of the family of god
[1:15:29] one night about three in the morning my
[1:15:30] daughter woke up screaming all screaming
[1:15:32] as bad as she could scream and i
[1:15:34] couldn't comfort her and i began to
[1:15:35] realize that that was an evil spirit on
[1:15:37] my daughter and you know what
[1:15:40] i have weaknesses in this life i'm gonna
[1:15:41] go ahead and tell you i know you think
[1:15:43] because i'm a preacher i'm perfect but
[1:15:44] i'm not
[1:15:45] hard to believe preachers ain't perfect
[1:15:47] ain't it brother steve but i was sitting
[1:15:49] there and
[1:15:50] and you know i i began to
[1:15:52] i began to realize in the moment i
[1:15:54] didn't have enough faith to pray for my
[1:15:56] daughter
[1:15:57] but you know what i did realize that was
[1:15:58] my grandma gave me a prayer cloth from
[1:16:00] brother branham's meetings
[1:16:02] and i began to realize you know i said i
[1:16:04] might not have a lot of faith in myself
[1:16:05] right now but i've got a lot of faith in
[1:16:08] that cloth because i believe that that
[1:16:10] anointing is still on that cloth and i
[1:16:12] went and i grabbed that cloth from
[1:16:14] downstairs and i went back upstairs and
[1:16:16] i found i found my daughter laying there
[1:16:18] with my wife and she was screaming and
[1:16:20] and we we quoted that same scripture
[1:16:23] and after when as i was trying to read
[1:16:25] buddy that spirit tried to act up and
[1:16:27] got loud don't tell me spirits and
[1:16:29] demons ain't real brother i've seen it
[1:16:31] and then she started to act up more and
[1:16:33] more screaming more and more and more
[1:16:35] and as i began to pray i read that and
[1:16:38] she screamed more and i began to pray
[1:16:39] and quote the scripture and then the
[1:16:41] last thing i said i said in the name of
[1:16:44] the lord jesus christ we rebuke this
[1:16:46] spirit and she was screaming and
[1:16:48] screaming and screaming but when that
[1:16:50] prayer claw touched her leg she stopped
[1:16:52] instantly and that devil went flying out
[1:16:54] there because that's the standard you
[1:16:56] can turn to that when your children are
[1:16:58] sick when your family are sick you can
[1:17:00] grab that standard you can throw the
[1:17:02] devil out of your house
[1:17:04] with the word of god nothing is
[1:17:06] impossible
[1:17:08] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:17:10] churches might do all these different
[1:17:12] things i joined in church and all this
[1:17:13] but let me tell you something hear it
[1:17:15] from my voice so you don't have an
[1:17:17] excuse acts 2 and 38 is still the
[1:17:19] standard you must repent
[1:17:22] oh and be baptized in the name of the
[1:17:24] lord jesus christ
[1:17:27] you must be born again
[1:17:30] you can have all the riches like the
[1:17:32] rich young ruler had
[1:17:36] you can keep all the commandments and be
[1:17:38] a pretty good boy
[1:17:40] but when it comes down to it
[1:17:43] you'll walk away empty
[1:17:48] but if there's ever one time in your
[1:17:49] life
[1:17:52] that you line up with a standard
[1:17:55] and get the indwelling of the holy ghost
[1:17:59] watch out devil
[1:18:01] i hope you realize
[1:18:03] there's a reason you keep people
[1:18:04] overcoming and it ain't because of you
[1:18:08] because greater is he that is in you
[1:18:10] than he that is in the world

[1:21:32] if it was or was it so don't even ask me
[1:21:34] i don't care
[1:21:36] but everybody kept saying the election
[1:21:38] was rigged the election was rigged it
[1:21:40] may have been or may not but if you want
[1:21:41] to see a rigged election
[1:21:43] look right here
[1:21:45] look at these people
[1:21:47] we didn't deserve to make it we didn't
[1:21:49] deserve to eternal life
[1:21:52] but god by his election that we were yet
[1:21:56] sinners christ died for us
[1:22:00] you're looking at a rigged election
[1:22:03] hallelujah
[1:22:05] when satan says he's guilty jesus said
[1:22:08] they're free
[1:22:09] hallelujah
[1:22:18] glory to god
[1:22:22] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:22:24] may be able to stand against the wiles
[1:22:26] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:22:28] flesh and blood look at your neighbor
[1:22:30] and say you ain't my enemy
[1:22:33] they are not your enemy
[1:22:35] but against principalities against
[1:22:37] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:22:39] this world against spiritual
[1:22:42] wickedness in high places
[1:22:44] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:22:46] of god that you may be able to withstand
[1:22:48] in the evil day and having all done all
[1:22:51] to stand
[1:22:52] stand
[1:22:54] that's a commandment of the standard
[1:22:57] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:22:58] with truth
[1:23:00] and having on the breastplate of
[1:23:01] righteousness
[1:23:02] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:23:04] of the gospel of peace
[1:23:06] above all
[1:23:08] taking the shield of faith
[1:23:11] wherefore ye shall be able
[1:23:14] ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
[1:23:18] darts of the wicked
[1:23:20] let me tell you something little sister
[1:23:23] you might feel overwhelmed
[1:23:25] you might feel like you can't go no
[1:23:27] further you might feel like the weight
[1:23:29] of the world is on your shoulders and
[1:23:30] satan's gonna win but let me tell you
[1:23:32] something he will never overcome you
[1:23:35] because greater is he that is in you
[1:23:38] than he that is in the world
[1:23:40] he has lied to you over and over and
[1:23:44] over again
[1:23:45] but he will not prevail because god
[1:23:48] already has an overcomer and he will not
[1:23:51] blot your name out of that book
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:24:02] you can say what you want to
[1:24:04] but when i was in my study
[1:24:07] the lord said put that in your notes
[1:24:09] because there's going to be a sister
[1:24:11] that needs it
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:13] i still believe in the inspiration of
[1:24:15] the holy ghost
[1:24:16] i still believe god can speak to men's
[1:24:19] hearts
[1:24:20] i still believe in the standard
[1:24:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:24:25] listen congregation he's hit you with a
[1:24:28] lot of darts
[1:24:29] and they hurt but you will not be
[1:24:32] overwhelmed you will not be overcome
[1:24:35] jesus has already won the victory
[1:24:40] but thanks be to god which give us the
[1:24:43] victory through our lord jesus christ
[1:24:48] ye are of god little children and
[1:24:50] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:24:53] is in you
[1:24:55] than he that is in the world
[1:24:57] oh
[1:24:58] church
[1:24:59] nay and all these things we are more
[1:25:01] somebody say more
[1:25:03] than conquerors
[1:25:05] through him
[1:25:06] that loved us for i am persuaded
[1:25:09] i stand with paul on this can anybody
[1:25:12] stand with paul on this for i am
[1:25:14] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:25:17] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:25:20] nor things present nor things to come
[1:25:23] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:25:26] creature
[1:25:27] shall be able
[1:25:29] it can try but it won't be able
[1:25:33] to separate us
[1:25:35] from the love of jesus christ
[1:25:39] glory
[1:25:42] i've been through a lot of trials i've
[1:25:45] had a lot of problems but it never
[1:25:47] separated me from the love of jesus
[1:25:50] christ
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:26:00] hallelujah
[1:26:01] you say why are you dancing
[1:26:06] i went through the red sea brother
[1:26:08] you know what that red sea it was the
[1:26:10] blood of jesus christ
[1:26:14] and when i looked back
[1:26:16] every single one of my enemies was dead
[1:26:23] i serve a risen savior
[1:26:31] i serve a risen king
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:38] this body must come subject to the word
[1:26:40] of god that's why my shoulder don't hurt
[1:26:44] that's why my wrists don't hurt that was
[1:26:46] hurting on the way here
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:50] because the standard said
[1:26:52] i was healed
[1:27:13] now faith
[1:27:16] faith is a conqueror
[1:27:18] faith is an overcomer
[1:27:20] it just isn't a peacemaker
[1:27:23] you ain't got to cope with that problem
[1:27:26] it isn't a peacemaker it overcomes
[1:27:29] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[1:27:31] world
[1:27:32] what does it
[1:27:34] what is it
[1:27:36] it's faith
[1:27:38] what is the conqueror concrete is
[1:27:40] victory
[1:27:41] to conquer it means to beat down someone
[1:27:44] put that devil under your foot right now
[1:27:46] to override to handcraft to throw it
[1:27:49] into prison
[1:27:51] it means that the sin the sin that once
[1:27:53] ruled you you rule it
[1:27:56] it means that you've overcome it you are
[1:27:58] you've whipped it you are greater than
[1:28:01] it is
[1:28:02] he said oh i feel religious right now
[1:28:04] and i can agree with that
[1:28:06] which was which was first a sinner or a
[1:28:09] savior
[1:28:10] a savior for a savior is more powerful
[1:28:13] than sin which was first the healer or a
[1:28:16] sickness
[1:28:18] oh church of the living god he couldn't
[1:28:19] be a healer unless he was over the
[1:28:21] sickness
[1:28:22] it's a healer
[1:28:24] it can conquer the sickness
[1:28:26] and faith is the victory that overcomes
[1:28:28] every curse of the devil
[1:28:30] every cursed church
[1:28:32] faith is the victory faith in what not
[1:28:35] faith in your church
[1:28:37] not faith in your creed
[1:28:39] not faith in some man
[1:28:41] but faith in jesus christ
[1:28:44] who made the promise
[1:28:52] you know what
[1:28:58] when a man tells the truth he can tell
[1:29:00] the story the same every time
[1:29:05] when a man tells the truth he can tell
[1:29:08] the story the same every time you tell a
[1:29:10] lie you got 20 different interpretations
[1:29:13] but when you tell the truth and there's
[1:29:16] no lie in you
[1:29:19] it's the truth every time
[1:29:23] that's why these promises never wear out
[1:29:30] i just bought i bought i bought a little
[1:29:32] card from my sister and it says valid
[1:29:35] from this date to that date for coupons
[1:29:38] i'm so glad we are we are serving a god
[1:29:42] that is not bound from date to date
[1:29:44] but he tells the truth every time
[1:29:47] the bible does not have an expiration
[1:29:49] date on it the word of god will never
[1:29:51] have an expiration date on it because it
[1:29:53] was written by an eternal being
[1:29:58] do you realize
[1:30:00] there's a lot of people that say a lot
[1:30:02] of things about you
[1:30:04] a lot of people that say a lot of
[1:30:06] negative
[1:30:08] but if the king of the universe
[1:30:12] could look down on us
[1:30:15] and see us in the sinful nature that we
[1:30:17] were in
[1:30:19] and he could say you know what brother

[1:30:37] how they see you worship
[1:30:39] [Music]

[1:30:43] now i was a 15 year old drinking smoking
[1:30:45] woman chasing man but jesus christ came
[1:30:49] into my life 12 years ago
[1:30:51] and completely changed me from the
[1:30:53] inside out
[1:30:58] is the message alive
[1:31:01] is the message dealing in young people
[1:31:04] you ain't got to have no modern message
[1:31:06] or say the message don't work if you
[1:31:07] just believe the standard believe the
[1:31:09] message it'll change your life
[1:31:14] stop listening to the devil
[1:31:20] ain't no truth in him ever since the
[1:31:22] beginning he's been telling lies in
[1:31:24] heaven trying to convince the angels
[1:31:26] follow me don't follow this jesus go to
[1:31:28] the garden lied deceived eve
[1:31:31] still trying to do it today but we try
[1:31:33] to lend the ear to him what do you want
[1:31:35] to say oh i'm sick oh my shoulder won't
[1:31:37] be made well oh i don't feel good okay
[1:31:40] no
[1:31:41] he ain't never told the truth
[1:31:43] and the truth ain't in him
[1:31:45] but jesus said i am the way
[1:31:48] i am the truth i am the life
[1:31:53] his power is
[1:31:56] unmatched all the devil can do is
[1:31:59] pervert all he can do is speak lies and
[1:32:01] pervert let me say this church of the
[1:32:03] living god i believe that god is so much
[1:32:05] greater than the devil and i say this if
[1:32:08] satan has ever perverted something with
[1:32:10] his power how much more
[1:32:12] can god restore
[1:32:14] with his power
[1:32:16] how much more
[1:32:17] if god is so much greater i don't care
[1:32:20] how far satan has took you i don't care
[1:32:22] how many roses took you down there is
[1:32:25] nothing that is greater than the grace
[1:32:28] of god
[1:32:34] all satan can do is lie
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:40] all satan can do is lie
[1:32:42] and his words have no power
[1:32:45] but let me tell you something
[1:32:51] jesus words
[1:32:56] oh
[1:32:57] there was a dead man behind a tomb named
[1:32:59] lazarus one day
[1:33:05] but when the standard
[1:33:07] old church i want you to know death was
[1:33:09] the standard
[1:33:11] until the standard walked in
[1:33:16] and when the standard walked up to the
[1:33:18] two
[1:33:22] his body said he was dead they said he
[1:33:24] stinketh by now
[1:33:26] jesus said what's that to me
[1:33:29] i thought you said you believed
[1:33:33] now listen you came here to church
[1:33:34] tonight tonight because you said you
[1:33:36] believed that's why you're here
[1:33:40] but this man's words
[1:33:42] this man's standard when a body was dead
[1:33:45] behind a tomb laying in a tomb
[1:33:49] when he was laying there
[1:33:51] and he said loose him
[1:33:54] and let him go
[1:33:55] lazarus come forth
[1:33:58] death had to give way to the standard so
[1:34:01] don't ask jesus christ is the same
[1:34:03] yesterday today and forever
[1:34:05] you hear me right now if you hear
[1:34:06] anything you hear this right now
[1:34:08] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:34:10] and forever and if jesus's words could
[1:34:13] bring a dead man back to life he could
[1:34:14] bring jarice's daughter back to life
[1:34:16] could bring his own life that he laid
[1:34:18] down and resurrected again if jesus's
[1:34:21] words can do that don't you dare tell me
[1:34:24] that your situation is too bad for my
[1:34:27] jesus to bring you out
[1:34:33] this is why
[1:34:34] i believe the message of the hour
[1:34:39] there is still people raised from the
[1:34:41] dead
[1:34:42] there is still sick
[1:34:44] healed and soon and very soon there's a
[1:34:47] people gonna take a body chance
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:56] one more we'll go
[1:35:01] brother brandon said there may not be a
[1:35:02] chance for you to live
[1:35:04] you may be dying with cancer you may be
[1:35:06] bound to a wheelchair
[1:35:08] you may be totally behind i don't know
[1:35:10] what your trouble is
[1:35:12] but if you'll take the chief doctor's
[1:35:14] prescription
[1:35:16] whatsoever thing you desire when you
[1:35:18] pray believe
[1:35:20] you receive it and shall have it
[1:35:22] and believe that faith will overcome any
[1:35:25] difficulty that there is
[1:35:27] you may be so burdened with sin until
[1:35:29] your soul is smutty as it can be
[1:35:31] you may have tried to get rid of that
[1:35:33] ill temper and slandering tongue that
[1:35:36] gossip on the telephone hello
[1:35:39] you might have tried every remedy you
[1:35:42] know
[1:35:43] but if you just let jesus christ come
[1:35:45] into you tonight
[1:35:47] he'll operate on your faith
[1:35:49] and give you a faith that will climb
[1:35:51] beyond
[1:35:53] anything that the world can produce
[1:35:56] why
[1:35:57] faith
[1:35:58] is the victory
[1:36:00] that overcomes the world
[1:36:03] faith by what
[1:36:05] hearing
[1:36:06] of the word of god
[1:36:10] my faith don't come from apostolic
[1:36:12] tabernacle
[1:36:14] that's not where i draw my faith from
[1:36:17] come from the eternal word of god
[1:36:21] as long as i'm here
[1:36:23] as long as we're here
[1:36:25] let's lift up the standard
[1:36:29] over every trial
[1:36:31] over every devitt devil
[1:36:33] over every principality over every
[1:36:37] we lift up the standard
[1:36:40] over every lost family member
[1:36:42] over every sickness
[1:36:45] over every need in our church
[1:36:47] over every need in my body
[1:36:50] i don't care i don't care what these
[1:36:52] senses say
[1:36:56] as jonah was
[1:36:58] these are all lying vanities
[1:37:00] but this is the truth
[1:37:04] i take my life on this
[1:37:07] this is the truth
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:14] i finished with this
[1:37:18] why
[1:37:19] would you battle the devil
[1:37:24] how many years
[1:37:26] has the devil told you you wouldn't make
[1:37:27] it
[1:37:30] and still
[1:37:32] but every time he knocks you down
[1:37:35] you get back up
[1:37:41] you are an invincible army church
[1:37:47] not because seth coffey
[1:37:49] not because brother stephen as much as i
[1:37:51] admire this man
[1:37:53] but i admire a greater woman
[1:37:56] and his name is jesus christ
[1:37:58] and he said this church
[1:38:01] i will be with you
[1:38:03] even in you
[1:38:07] church what life is on the inside of you
[1:38:10] it's the very life giver
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:14] that's why you can't be defeated
[1:38:18] because he's in you
[1:38:21] you would have confidence if jesus
[1:38:24] christ came and stepped in this building
[1:38:26] and walked down the street to a bunch of
[1:38:28] devils you would say he's going to get
[1:38:30] them he's going to wear them out
[1:38:32] and even when he came
[1:38:34] to the legion of devils
[1:38:37] they recognized the standard
[1:38:40] as much as they tormented that man
[1:38:43] when they came running to him they said
[1:38:45] thou son of god
[1:38:48] why have you come to persecute us before
[1:38:50] our time
[1:38:51] now if you believe that jesus could do
[1:38:53] that if he was in the building walking
[1:38:55] i'm here to tell you that that same
[1:38:56] jesus through the holy ghost is dwelling
[1:38:58] on the inside of each and every one of
[1:39:00] you let it be a legion of devils
[1:39:03] let it be what it be
[1:39:05] but there is nothing that can stand in
[1:39:07] the way of a holy ghost field child of
[1:39:10] almighty god
[1:39:14] i believe in one place brother branham
[1:39:17] said if the holy ghost is in you you
[1:39:18] have the requirement for the rapture if
[1:39:21] you can have that requirement for the
[1:39:22] rapture how much more can you have the
[1:39:24] requirement to step on some devil's
[1:39:26] heads
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:39] you say i feel worthless
[1:39:43] it's all in the
[1:39:44] value is in the eyes of the beholder
[1:39:48] look around
[1:39:50] you're the reason he died
[1:39:53] you're the reason he went down to hell
[1:39:55] you're the reason he kicked the devil in
[1:39:57] the face and took the keys
[1:40:00] and said these are for my people
[1:40:07] he thought that much of you
[1:40:11] if you ever wonder
[1:40:14] when you look when you go to purchase
[1:40:16] something
[1:40:17] you say how much does it cost
[1:40:19] how much is the value how much are you
[1:40:22] willing to pay for this
[1:40:24] and jesus said i'll pay with my own
[1:40:26] blood
[1:40:28] i want them
[1:40:30] you're worth it
[1:40:38] you are
[1:40:40] the purchase
[1:40:42] of god's
[1:40:43] own
[1:40:44] life

[1:47:45] their church
[1:47:48] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:47:50] flood
[1:47:51] when the enemy
[1:47:54] shall come in like a flood
[1:47:57] the spirit of the lord
[1:47:59] shall lift up a standard
[1:48:02] against him
[1:48:26] oh
[1:48:40] oh
[1:48:58] oh
[1:49:00] let's pray
[1:49:02] heavenly father
[1:49:05] lord we can never
[1:49:07] over emphasize
[1:49:10] the brazen altar
[1:49:13] for your children lord
[1:49:16] now we understand again more
[1:49:19] why the very entrance of the tabernacle
[1:49:22] that's the first thing that was put
[1:49:24] right there
[1:49:26] to always begin from the cross
[1:49:29] because from the cross you did
[1:49:31] everything
[1:49:33] no wonder at the end lord
[1:49:36] you spoke you say it is finished
[1:49:39] because you know that the remaining of
[1:49:41] the journey through the tabernacle
[1:49:44] is going to be nothing else but the
[1:49:46] result of what happened the consequences
[1:49:50] of what happened at the brazen altar
[1:49:53] father many lambs were killed
[1:49:56] in the old testament
[1:49:58] from hours after hours lord
[1:50:02] many blood has been shed
[1:50:04] in the temple order
[1:50:06] father trying to satisfy
[1:50:10] the requirement for sin
[1:50:12] but lord all that the blood of bulls and
[1:50:15] goat could do
[1:50:17] was only lord a covering
[1:50:19] and your children has been held in
[1:50:21] paradise
[1:50:23] but father one day
[1:50:25] you walk toward jordan
[1:50:27] the very river lord father
[1:50:30] that was representing death
[1:50:32] and father you brought a different
[1:50:34] standard
[1:50:36] where the lamb was no longer a an animal
[1:50:40] but the lamb was a human being
[1:50:43] and he was not any ordinary human being
[1:50:46] it was god himself
[1:50:49] that was made flesh in the body
[1:50:52] and that body was the body of jesus
[1:50:55] christ
[1:50:56] and father you went to the water
[1:50:59] and you came out
[1:51:00] and you were presented as the lamb of
[1:51:03] god
[1:51:04] the perfect atonement
[1:51:06] the anti-type lord
[1:51:08] the one every lamb from evil
[1:51:11] all the way to you lord was representing
[1:51:15] and father when you entered the cross
[1:51:18] father you nailed everything that was
[1:51:20] against us
[1:51:22] you took care of our sins
[1:51:24] you took care of our sicknesses
[1:51:26] you took care of our trouble
[1:51:29] you took care of every problem every
[1:51:32] depression every foot problem every pain
[1:51:36] every tragedy in the family there is
[1:51:39] nothing that was not incorporated in the
[1:51:41] atonement father
[1:51:44] and lord you didn't stop there
[1:51:46] you went down below hell
[1:51:49] father you went very at the very gate of
[1:51:52] hell itself
[1:51:54] father you pondered at that door
[1:51:57] and lord when the devil opened
[1:52:00] he found a different match
[1:52:03] he was not able
[1:52:05] he was not abraham
[1:52:07] he was none of them lord none of the old
[1:52:10] testament said
[1:52:12] he was this tender himself
[1:52:14] that was standing and knocking at the
[1:52:17] very gate of hell
[1:52:19] father you went through those gates
[1:52:21] as a testimony to those that rejected
[1:52:24] the power of either the gospel of noah
[1:52:27] and you came out from there
[1:52:29] and father you went to paradise and when
[1:52:32] they opened the door what a standard was
[1:52:34] it to the old testament saying
[1:52:37] that you could rescue them lord and
[1:52:39] father bring them back again on the same
[1:52:42] earth that they bury them lord
[1:52:45] lord you never stop there
[1:52:47] you took them lord father and you rise
[1:52:50] up with them all the way to heaven and
[1:52:53] you sat down on the throne of god
[1:52:56] ever victorious lord showing lord father
[1:52:59] that you have completed everything
[1:53:01] and lord jesus christ when that book was
[1:53:04] sealed
[1:53:05] and no one was worthy to take a book
[1:53:08] to even look at the book lord
[1:53:10] father when john was crying seeking for
[1:53:14] a kingsman redeemer
[1:53:15] there was no one on the earth
[1:53:18] there was no one under the earth there
[1:53:20] was not even anybody in the heaven yet
[1:53:22] you were in heaven
[1:53:24] but father
[1:53:25] when the call
[1:53:27] turned into the presentation
[1:53:30] here you came forth lord
[1:53:32] as this standard
[1:53:34] the one who was worthy to come up
[1:53:37] to take the book
[1:53:38] and to break the seal
[1:53:40] and father you sent that book back again
[1:53:43] that tata did the property that was
[1:53:46] taken from the hand of adam now it's
[1:53:49] back again in the hand of adam
[1:53:52] because of the lamb of god
[1:53:54] father what else can we say
[1:53:57] there is no sickness there is no trouble
[1:54:00] there is nothing that can stand before
[1:54:02] the robber
[1:54:03] nothing

[2:00:55] father i rebuke every witchcraft spirit
[2:01:02] that will try to play again with the
[2:01:05] present altar
[2:01:07] like paul say galatians who have
[2:01:10] bewitched you
[2:01:13] in the eyes whose jesus christ was
[2:01:16] clearly
[2:01:17] stated as crucified
[2:01:19] somebody was trying to get them away
[2:01:21] from the cross
[2:01:23] from the power of the cross
[2:01:26] and paul
[2:01:27] look at that spirit as a witchcraft
[2:01:35] father remove it away from this place
[2:01:41] because the cross nailed the law
[2:01:44] and he changed the priesthood

[2:01:49] priesthood we are under the melchizedek
[2:01:52] because of the cross

[2:02:13] bloody lamb
[2:02:14] and the cross provided
