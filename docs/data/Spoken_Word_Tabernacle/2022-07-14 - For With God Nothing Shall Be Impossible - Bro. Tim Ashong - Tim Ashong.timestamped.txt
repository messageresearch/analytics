[23:56] thought I was dying
[23:58] but I was able to get to the sink so I
[24:01] threw up all on me and I got to the sink
[24:03] and I rinsed my face for like 50 to one

[48:23] I love to encourage the people of God to
[48:26] keep pressing on
[48:30] Lester from Genesis
[48:36] chapter 17.
[48:46] Genesis chapter 17.
[48:52] let's just read from
[48:55] verse 15.
[48:58] Genesis 17 from verse 15. yes my brother
[49:04] and God said unto Abraham
[49:09] as for Sarai
[49:12] thy wife
[49:14] that shall not call a name Sarai
[49:18] but Sarah
[49:21] [Music]
[49:24] may be
[49:27] and I'll bless thee
[49:30] and I'll blessed her
[49:32] and give thee a son also of air
[49:38] yay
[49:40] I will bless her
[49:42] and she shall be a mother of Nations
[49:49] Kings of people
[49:52] shall be of Heaven
[49:56] then Abraham fell upon his face
[50:01] and laugh
[50:04] take notes
[50:06] and Abraham fell on his face and laughed
[50:13] and said
[50:14] in his heart
[50:19] a child
[50:21] be born unto him that is 100 years old
[50:28] Sarah
[50:30] that is 90 years old bear
[50:36] and Abraham said
[50:38] unto God
[50:40] oh that Ishmael might live before thee
[50:47] and God said
[50:52] Sarah
[50:53] thy wife
[50:56] shall bear thee a son indeed
[51:00] and thou shall call his name Isaac
[51:05] amen and I will establish my Covenant
[51:09] with him for an Everlasting Covenant
[51:14] and with his seed after him
[51:17] amen amen shall we be seated as I read
[51:22] from the gospel of Saint Luke
[51:27] chapter 1.
[51:31] it's a familiar scripture there
[51:43] look chapter one
[51:46] let's just read Luke chapter one a few
[51:49] lines
[51:52] um
[51:53] they say Mary unto the angel
[51:57] how shall this be
[51:59] seeing I know not a man
[52:04] and the angel answered and said unto her
[52:07] the Holy Ghost
[52:09] shall come upon thee
[52:12] and the power of the highest
[52:14] Shah overshadow thee
[52:17] therefore also that only thing which
[52:20] shall be born of thee shall be called
[52:22] the son of God
[52:25] and behold thy curse in Elizabeth she
[52:28] have also conceived a son in a old age
[52:34] and this is the sixth month
[52:37] who was called Barry
[52:41] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[52:45] amen amen
[52:48] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[52:54] whatever your condition
[53:00] remember that for with God nothing shall
[53:04] be impossible
[53:07] so we start from the book of Genesis
[53:11] and we this is we've read about
[53:15] uh
[53:16] Our Father Abraham
[53:19] the father of faith
[53:22] Hallelujah
[53:24] it was Abraham and at a point in time
[53:28] God came down and said your name shall
[53:32] no more be called Abraham but Abraham
[53:36] shall be your name amen
[53:40] Abraham and we have been taught that
[53:42] that means father of Nations
[53:46] and this is a man that was
[53:50] he like he was saying that a child be
[53:53] born to somebody that is hundred years
[53:56] so God told him
[53:59] again I said and also not you alone
[54:03] because you and your wife are one
[54:06] so your name has been changed and your
[54:09] wife name must be changed
[54:12] so the blessing that came to Abraham
[54:14] fall upon Sarah too
[54:17] so God said you will not call a name
[54:21] Sarai but Sarah shall be a name
[54:25] praise the Lord
[54:27] Hallelujah
[54:30] and then
[54:32] the story goes on and he said and I will
[54:35] bless her
[54:39] and are we blessing amen
[54:44] God is speaking
[54:47] and our
[54:49] and give thee as soon also of air
[54:55] I will bless her
[54:57] and I'll give you a son also of her
[55:03] what is he saying
[55:07] and
[55:09] she shall be a mother of Nations
[55:14] of people shall be of air
[55:20] a mother of Nations
[55:22] and things of people shall be afraid
[55:26] [Music]
[55:28] and Abraham fell
[55:31] on his face
[55:37] and laugh
[55:47] s
[55:48] April fell on his face and laughed
[55:53] and he didn't just stopped there and he
[55:56] said
[55:59] hit his heart

[56:52] to bear and he said it should be a
[56:55] matter of Nations
[56:57] and places

[57:02] brothers and sisters with God nothing
[57:05] shall be impossible
[57:06] [Music]
[57:12] Hallelujah
[57:16] Hallelujah he said
[57:22] Sarah and not me I am 100 years old a
[57:26] man that is 100 years old
[57:31] if it was common
[57:33] he would not have questioned
[57:39] if it was common it would not have
[57:42] questioned it
[57:45] but it was not common then
[57:50] but God Can Make The Uncommon to become
[57:53] common
[57:56] God can make the impossibility to be
[57:59] made possible

[1:38:31] for God to blessed in the place of the
[1:38:35] son that God is promising
[1:38:42] everybody here a permissive will
[1:38:47] anybody care
[1:38:48] now Abraham is calling Ishmael
[1:38:54] anybody here he was talking to God he
[1:38:58] introduced the name Ishmael
[1:39:01] so God also upgrade his language God
[1:39:04] have also to bring out a name
[1:39:09] have you seen that
[1:39:11] Abraham started he said Ishmael God said
[1:39:15] okay I all I told you before you shall
[1:39:17] have a son I never say the name
[1:39:19] I told you again that Sarah is going to
[1:39:21] bury his son I didn't give you the name
[1:39:23] so since you're getting more precise let
[1:39:26] me also get more precision
[1:39:31] [Laughter]
[1:39:34] you love the Bible
[1:39:35] what can make you love the Bible like
[1:39:37] this
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:40] everybody here
[1:39:42] and God verse 19 and God say Sarah look
[1:39:46] at his language God already flipped I
[1:39:49] told you Sarah I'm not going to repeat
[1:39:50] Sarah again it's already gone no more he
[1:39:53] said Sarah thou wife
[1:39:56] shall bear thee
[1:39:58] a son indeed like the brother timoshong
[1:40:02] preach indeed in other words that means
[1:40:05] sisting Sarah anybody here
[1:40:08] and that shall call his name who now you
[1:40:13] start with a name I pull up a name now
[1:40:17] why Ishmael have to hate Isaac
[1:40:22] and mistreated him because Isaac was the
[1:40:25] opposite
[1:40:28] of Ishmael amen
[1:40:30] so God precise them more clearly you
[1:40:33] know now I'm not gonna be vague you're
[1:40:34] going to have a child a son so let me
[1:40:37] give you even the name
[1:40:39] so when he's born you don't have to
[1:40:41] worry about praying for a name
[1:40:44] everybody you don't have to worry about
[1:40:46] the name I God give you the name and you
[1:40:50] carry that name and you give it to the
[1:40:51] child so go to sleep this promise have
[1:40:54] nothing to do with you Abraham
[1:40:57] because to begin with normally you don't
[1:40:59] have any more strength
[1:41:01] your age is past
[1:41:03] and back here I gave you a promise
[1:41:06] you're gonna have a child when normally
[1:41:07] you cannot have a child in other words I
[1:41:10] remove all your power all your abilities
[1:41:14] out but there was still one ability left
[1:41:18] for you to do you should have given that
[1:41:20] child a name I'm gonna take that ability
[1:41:22] away from you you're not gonna even give
[1:41:25] him a name in other words Isaac from
[1:41:27] start to finish it's all God
[1:41:32] there is nothing in Isaac that have to
[1:41:35] do with Abraham even the name Isaac he
[1:41:38] came from God
[1:41:43] Hallelujah he said his name Isaac and I
[1:41:47] will establish my Covenant with him for
[1:41:49] a never lasting Covenant and with his
[1:41:52] seed after him
[1:41:55] with God nothing
[1:41:58] shall be what
[1:42:00] I don't know what's going in your life
[1:42:02] but God spoke tonight
[1:42:05] amen whatever you are going through your
[1:42:09] life is just a part of the story it must
[1:42:12] seems impossible God is not telling you
[1:42:16] about things that make sense to you
[1:42:19] what God is telling you tonight it's not
[1:42:22] about stuff that you can go apply
[1:42:25] because you have a good credit store
[1:42:27] you're gonna have it that one you can go
[1:42:29] ahead and do it
[1:42:31] do you hear me in other words God is not
[1:42:34] talking about you getting approved for a
[1:42:37] car when your credit score is 800. God
[1:42:40] is not talking about you buying a car
[1:42:43] because you have money in your bank
[1:42:44] account that's not what God is saying
[1:42:47] God is speaking specifically tonight
[1:42:50] about things that you are locked
[1:42:54] things that you don't know how you're
[1:42:56] gonna come out of it things that you
[1:42:58] don't know how even you're gonna have a
[1:43:00] solution things that when you look you
[1:43:03] already give up
[1:43:05] it's already done there is no way
[1:43:08] something else things that you already
[1:43:11] bury you put a tombstone on it and you
[1:43:15] even finish the story
[1:43:16] those are the stuff God is talking
[1:43:19] tonight
[1:43:22] everybody here anybody here

[1:44:19] it's easy to believe Resurrection when
[1:44:22] you still in the hospital it is easy to
[1:44:24] believe Resurrection when you still on a
[1:44:27] casket on a viewing day but when they
[1:44:30] bury you and they put a tombstone on you
[1:44:33] it becomes impossible
[1:44:36] everybody here that's why Marta was
[1:44:39] thinking about the resurrection in the
[1:44:42] last day because the last day will pull
[1:44:45] the people from the tomb Jesus said I'm
[1:44:48] not talking about that one I am the
[1:44:51] resurrection

[1:45:27] if you never cook and you don't know how
[1:45:29] to cook then you put it on the list
[1:45:31] God is telling you about the situation
[1:45:33] that are impossible it is impossible for
[1:45:37] a woman that is Virgin to give birth
[1:45:41] Impossible by the spoken word impossible

[1:46:08] those hopeless situations that you
[1:46:11] already put on the shelf that you
[1:46:13] already shredded

[1:46:38] because indeed with God
[1:46:40] nothing will be impossible be together
[1:46:45] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:46:48] Lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:46:50] father tonight
[1:46:53] Lord thanking you for your grace
[1:46:56] for your love and for your mercy
[1:47:00] father it takes only Grace
[1:47:03] to override the human weakness
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:06] and then Grace goes with your mercy
[1:47:09] father
[1:47:10] to come down and send your servant
[1:47:13] to remind your children of who they are
[1:47:18] that just the way we choose our own
[1:47:21] spouse on this world
[1:47:22] that's the same way you chose us before
[1:47:25] the foundation of the world
[1:47:28] so we already existed in your mind and
[1:47:31] we are Eternal creatures
[1:47:33] creature that are above what is called
[1:47:36] material and natural father
[1:47:39] and Lord you are reminding us that our
[1:47:41] life has been already been decided
[1:47:46] before we were even conceived in our
[1:47:48] mother's home
[1:47:50] because that's what you told Jeremiah
[1:47:52] you say you already called him you
[1:47:55] already ordained him to be Prophet over
[1:47:57] the nation so if you already are dead
[1:47:59] and Jeremiah to be Prophet who can stop
[1:48:02] Jeremiah for being a prophet because you
[1:48:05] already spoke
[1:48:06] and when you spoke everything have to
[1:48:09] happen exactly to the dot because you
[1:48:13] spoke in your word that no one ayoda of
[1:48:15] the word will fail without him being
[1:48:17] accomplished
[1:48:19] father may you help your children
[1:48:22] tonight
[1:48:23] help all of us
[1:48:25] to realize
[1:48:27] the greatness of your power
[1:48:30] and to understand that we are serving a
[1:48:32] mighty a big God
[1:48:35] to whom nothing
[1:48:38] is impossible
[1:48:40] father whatever situation that they gave
[1:48:43] up
[1:48:44] but down in the subconscious it's still
[1:48:48] bothering them
[1:48:49] Sometimes they come across those
[1:48:51] situation and they are dodging
[1:48:54] or they are escaping they are avoiding
[1:48:57] those situation because they already
[1:48:59] gave up they know that there is no more
[1:49:02] Redemption there is no more solution to
[1:49:05] this
[1:49:06] but tonight you are showing us that not
[1:49:09] only can you restore Abraham
[1:49:12] for one woman but when his child when
[1:49:15] his wife died
[1:49:17] and was buried you continue to prove to
[1:49:20] Abraham
[1:49:21] that I can still give exceedingly and
[1:49:25] abundantly above all you can ask and
[1:49:28] think
[1:49:29] may you Quicken that Faith tonight
[1:49:32] and may father your children continue to
[1:49:35] live under great expectation knowing
[1:49:39] further that it's the time that you are
[1:49:42] changing the story
[1:49:44] we humbly ask it father and committed in
[1:49:47] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:50] Hallelujah
[1:49:52] [Music]

[1:50:40] I've learned to depend upon
[1:50:44] his word y'all are dismissed we're gonna
