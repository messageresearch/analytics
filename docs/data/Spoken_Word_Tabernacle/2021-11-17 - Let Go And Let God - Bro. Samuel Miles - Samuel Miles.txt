hallelujah everybody happy tonight are you really happy tonight amen amen amen amen hallelujah sister joanne we appreciate that song walk with jesus amen when brother caleb was speaking tonight he just caught rad at what i was looking in the scripture because the bible say enoch walk with god amen he walked with god and the bible say he was not for god took him what else do you want in this hour but working with god do you know the power of working with god do you know where it is it's in hebrew in the book of genesis the bible say enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him that's all how did he walk with god let's go to you 11. amen brother david can you give me a little bit more i love it when it's plain hebrew chapter 11 verse 5. you're there the bible say by what you see how he walked with god amen by faith enoch was translated if enoch was translated by faith faith is a revelation so enoch must have have the revelation of translation and the revelation of translation we know where he lies no wonder brother branham say enoch have rapturing faith because rapturing faith is the faith that can translate you and the bible say he was the seventh from adam everybody died adam died able died said that this one died that when he reached the seventh one somebody broke the circle amen showing that in the seven church ages the last one somebody must break the circle we are not all going to sleep someone is going to stay alive and meet jesus in the air amen the bible says by faith enoch was translated that he shall not see death and was not found because god had translated him why for before his translation he had this testimony which testimony that he pleased how can you please god with our faith because the bible say without faith it is what impossible to please god so there was a certain faith that god had that when god looked at that faith god really admired that faith do you know that faith do you know where it is it do you know in the scripture you know where it is yet it is not in the jewish people one day jesus was coming up and a roman centurion came to him and spoke to him and when he spoke jesus was martha by that faith like wait a minute what kind of faith is this he say not even in israel i have found such a faith the faith of the gentiles amen so it's good to walk with god not just the normal work but a work of faith remember not a humanistic work but you must be in the realms of faith in the realms of revelation that's when things happen hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord so continue to remember us in prayer lord willing we will be leaving going to brother church lamb for the meeting i believe we will send a text that will tell you the program who's preaching when he's preaching as i communicated with brother chad today and he told me that his services are streamed through his website so maybe we might put up a text and send you a message and the link of their website so if you want to stream we will start on friday evening you just go to their website and stream if you miss that so it's going to be on youtube later so usually the stream so if you want to stay on board you just go to the website friday night saturday morning saturday night and sunday morning amen back to back [Laughter] so you pray for us amen yeah you need to pray for us but i know that the lord is gonna have his way amen blessed be the name of the lord how many have been chewing on the sermon on sunday have you finished chewing why are you still chewing things continue to come out it's more than even what i started with amen i wrote stuff i keep writing stuff i said brother robert the text i said but robert i need to vent this to somebody it's a lot coming up here amen so if you miss it go ahead and review if you didn't catch it pretty good go ahead and review at least you have a sunday before we add more so review catch it pretty good because it's like a sermon that is gathering everything and putting them together everything from the beginning all the way it's a sermon that is pulling everything together amen so make sure you have time sit down open the scripture and once you do that you will see how much the holy spirit will continue to unfold to you amen yeah lord's willing i will be discussing this with the deacon we will see whether i know next week it's thanksgiving usually we have service on tuesday by tradition so we will talk to the deacon and see if we're going to have a service on tuesday so it's allowing the people on wednesday to go do what they got to do for thanksgiving so be on the loop lord's willing i believe we can make that decision before sunday so on sunday they will confirm it to you and if we confirm on monday we will send you a text again just to remind you that the middle service won't be on wednesday it's going to be on tuesday or we're going to keep it on wednesday everybody clear so far so make sure don't come here and say i was not aware check your your text message amen blessed be the name of the lord trustee who asked me to remind you about the building fund this oncoming weekend so please remember that i believe the text was already sent so lord is willing so we can finish up the work that we have here we still have a little tiny work left and right we need to finish it up here and then get into the next project and start looking at extending the building everybody clears so far so tonight we have one of our local minister here who have not ministered for us yet but he's gonna break that silence tonight amen amen his name is by the same mouth so you all know brother simmer we all came up from the same church there's nothing i can introduce him all i can tell you he's a wonderful brother amen so brother sam you home take your liberty preach like home i am free amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go only believe oh we believe only [Music] believe all things are possible [Music] [Music] all things are possible [Music] just close your eyes now oh lord i believe [Laughter] [Music] and all things are possible oh [Music] [Music] now jesus is here [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] and we're depending on that amen if he's here we're going to be blessed and if you hear from me well we'll have a good time anyways i i just was amazed at what the brother kelly and brother steve was sharing and uh this was not in my notes but it was in a bible study that uh teresa and i had the other morning we've been going through the book of thessalonians and if you just turn there for a minute to first thessalonians chapter 4 i want to show you something that the lord showed us uh i guess when was this trees last week maybe about two or three days ago we've been through this and so here we see in first thessalonians 4 is the rapture is that correct brother verse 13. let's just read that for a minute and then we're going to go back to the beginning that's what we're going back to anyways how many knows that we're going back to are ought to be conditioned god ain't taking nothing away from us except for what we shouldn't had in the beginning god has come to restore to us everything that we had with him when we was in adam in the garden how many knows you were in adam put your hand up if you know you were an adam all right how many knows that you were in christ when he hung on the cross how many knows that brother branham said that you paid for your debt of sin in christ when he was on the cross you were right brother it doesn't take long well i just want to thank excuse me thank my wife she's really precious to me and uh it was um quite a day today you know when you're trying to do something for the lord the apple cart upside down right trees today no matter what we touched it was upside down upside down and so i knew i was on the right track [Laughter] verse 13 it says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that yes or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we everybody say we which are alive and remain i believe it's that close i believe it's that close do you know that we're being surrounded by rome you the spiritual know what i'm talking about the early disciples when titus came down and surrounded jerusalem they had a word from the lord that it was time to get out of town and i'm telling you we're being surrounded by rome we got a roman catholic president who's in there by fraud all of our of our of our of our supreme court roman catholic we're a protestant nation why is every one of our roman er every one of our supreme court roman catholic and another thing our congress is is a great uh percentage of it is catholic and the ones that aren't catholic belong to the harlot sisters we're being surrounded by rome but our commandment is not to get into the field or run into the mountains our commandment and brother and sister we need to take this very seriously is to get into christ we need to be that's you don't have to be anywhere else but you get into christ it's a full surrender so anyways let me finish this anyway so he says so we're going to gather together them with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words all right now i told you he was gonna go back to the beginning so let's turn to verse 1. he was preparing the thessalonians for the end of the chapter furthermore he says then we beseech you brethren and exhorts you by the lord jesus christ as you have received of us how you ought to walk enoch had a testimony that he walked with god and he was not because god took him and how you ought to walk and to please he walked by faith he pleased god and that got him ready for the so what's paul telling the thessalonians to do walk with god and please him that'll get you ready for the rapture amen i saw that the other day i just about came unglued i said theresa look at this let's turn over to matthew this is a very simple message tonight if anybody's struggling this message is for you because the walk with christ is a very simple walk but we have to know what we're doing we have to know what it is that we're looking for and a lot of times the question goes out to so many people do you have the holy ghost do you have the holy ghost but i believe that the real question that we should be asking ourselves is does the holy ghost have us it was it's his arms wrapped around us he is keeping us and we have to know that we was in his mind before the foundation of the world and origen determines amen amen this is a very very simple you know i believe that um the sermon on the mount is uh is is actually christianity 101 you know if christianity 101. and and it's so simple and it's so simple and the thing about christianity is that there's not a christianity 102 103 104. there's christianity 101 and it just gets simpler and simpler and simpler and simpler and don't let anybody ever get you thinking that you have to have a lot of knowledge a lot of education what we need is a walk with god and that by faith and by god's grace that's what we're going to try to get to and so now very simply uh verse verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest let me read that again don't let these words slip through your mind as they're overly simplistic he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light lord jesus christ we're just here reporting for duty just asking father that you will feed the sheep here tonight with your word make it so digestible may our hearts be lightened may our souls be encouraged and may we know lord god that you have your ever loving arms wrapped around us lord god when they when when when they stretched out your arms you didn't have aaron and and and and her uh holding up that your arms as moses but you made sure they stayed there you let them nail them to the cross father lord so that we could have the victory tonight in christ jesus and so now lord let us learn to appreciate you lord for your meekness for your gentleness and spirit lord and may we as christians realize that we are possessors of the literal life of jesus christ come back upon the believers and we receive that by faith in your word in your promises as did joshua and caleb they just rested in your promises they claimed the possession and they was the only ones to move on into the promised land lord god we just pray that you'll help us lord it's time to turn northward lord it's time lord god to get out of katish barnia it's time lord to move away from the brazen altar it's time to move in past the the inner court lord god and it's time to come into your presence lord and to abide in your presence because in your presence is the fullness of joy lord god and at your right hand with you at our right hand lord god we will never be moved so help us lord jesus we want you lord to have a place in our hearts of authority to where that you can come in and walk down the channels of our attitudes walk into the the the our the conduct in our lives in our character lord and lord when we open the door and let you come in at your bidding father we don't just pull up a chair next to the door and tell you to sit down and be quiet and don't you dare go looking into my closets father we give you permission tonight we open up the channels of our lives walk down the hallways of our of our conduct walk down the hallways of our attitude walk down the hallways of our behavior lord god and lord if you find anything in there that's not pleasing to you father please don't come back and ask us permission father we give you permission to throw it away put it in the trash can as they did with the priests garments they just put it in a trash can why because there was a new garment coming lord jesus and father we just pray tonight lord jesus that you'll take your liberty lord to speak to our hearts and help us to humble ourselves before you lord we ask in jesus name amen and you all can be seated let's turn as you're being seated over to hebrews chapter 10 and i'd like to read a short reading here because the way in to the holiest is is there it's there hebrews chapter 10 and let's uh start with verse 16. he said this is the covenant i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their hearts and in their minds will i write them their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now friends that's good news that ought to make everybody happy their sins and their iniquities i will remember no more now where the remission of these is there is no more offering for sin look what paul says now having therefore brethren boldness you remember in the old testament that only the high priest could go into the holiest of holies and that once a year and he could he had to go in he sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice on the on the altar and it became a mercy seat and he did that for his sins and the sins of the people and then he had to come back out but friend i don't see anywhere here where paul's telling us to come back out he's telling us to enter in he's not saying come back out friends we are to live brother branham said that there was hardly a day went by in the camp of abraham but but that god didn't come down and make himself known to abraham and to his camp and i'm here to tell you that a young middle-aged old god wants you to walk with him every decision that you make every action that you take it should be in meditated prayer you say can i pray all the time paul said pray without ceasing we're called to live in his presence amen come boldly and how are we going to come in come with boldness and enter into the holiest that's the holiest of holy by what the blood of jesus it's all in jesus he made the way he is the way and the only thing that we have to do is walk in the provided way which was through the shed blood of the innocent one because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin but this offering was once and for all and brother branham said in the in the adoption series he said this is where the church is failing they're failing on that walk that every day walking with god so i want to bring to you a little message today tonight by the grace of god let go and let god let go and let god and for a subtitle let's pray i am i am convinced that the way that we're going to maintain this relationship this walking this talking is to have a a a prayer life with god that is not just uh how would we say uh help me get through the day and god bless mommy and god bless daddy this is a this is just an intimate walking and talking it's something when you get up in the morning god is in your mind on your mind when you go to bed at night god is on your mind and and that's where god is trying to get us to and if you go back and you go through the book of acts you'll find out that the disciples the the apostles they were constantly in prayer and there came up a little murmuring between the grecian widows and the hebrew widows and they were murmuring amongst themselves and so then the apostles kept getting pulled away to answer these these simple questions of daily life and that's when they said wait a minute wait a minute we can't take ourselves away from prayer and the word of god just to serve tables and they sought themselves out seven men's and that's how we got the deacons amen so we want to talk about walking talking letting go and letting god i'd like to go to a quote brother branham brought out in the restoration of the bride tree he said now now the only way he can work is when you let him work the only way that god can work is when you let him work he said you've got to believe it there's a law now listen to this there's a law he said there's a law given amongst everything now listen to this now this is a very simple message it's not deep but it's for anybody that's struggling to live an everyday walk with christ there's something that's built into you when if you're the child of god there is something that's in you that if you learn how to control that you or you allow it to control you it'll take care of every situation that you come into in your everyday life he says now there's a law he said you know the fish has a law and that fish can stand up here in the water and he has a law within him if he'll let go of that law that's in him he can sink plum to the bottom of the sea won't bother him a bit won't break one cell now you try to do that any swimmers in here i used to like to swim when i was young i could only go down so far and you know it gets cold once you get down there a little bit and it gets really dark when you get down there a little bit but anyways i couldn't go to the bottom and just sit there like a fish he said that law is not in you you can't do it but a fish can he deflates himself with that air such a way that he can there's nothing in him to burst open technology is good when it works brother stephen he deflates his there's he deflates himself with the air in such a way okay and he he made that way he's made that way he knows it he can enforce that law to take him plumb to the bottom of the sea and then raise back up again now listen to this there's a law in christ there is a law in christ now listen to what he says next that law is in men amen did you hear that that law is in men there's a law in christ that laws men he said you can bury him in the deepest grave or in the deepest sea or the lowest hell there's a law there's a law of the spirit of christ that will raise him up again so we saw the fish and we saw christ and then he says a bird has a law now its body is material it's earthbound sets on the earth here but it has a law within it that the way it spreads its wings it can fly plum out of sight that's against science they claim it's an earthbound bird gravitation has to hold it but it can defy gravitation lift itself right off of it and go right on out because it has to put that law in its it has to put that law that's in it to work let me say it again because it has to put that law that's in it to work now if the bird has to put that law that's in it to work so that he can fly and we know that there's a law in us then we have to put that law to work no stress no worry there's no virtue in worry if you find yourself worrying you're not exercising that law the word of god says cast all your cares on me [Music] because i care for you i remember one time i was helping my friend do tree work and his wife is just a thin framed woman brother steve and i don't guess what she weigh about 95 pounds teresa and but yet she pulls tree limbs she she she can handle a chainsaw i'm telling you this girl's she's a rugged little girl and she was pulling this great big limb brother stephen and she was just and i walked up to her and i said i said do you want me to pull that for you and she said i got i got i said now look i said you can carry that load if you want to but if you want i'll carry it for you and that's what the holy ghost does with us do you want to carry your burdens do you want to carry your anxieties do you want to carry your trepidations and your fears or you just want to give them over to him amen this is what walking and talking with god does for the believer we learn it's a law that we have to learn let me tell you something saints of god we carry a lot of stress on us that we don't have to carry god doesn't want his children he wants us to be able to go into the fiery furnace without any fear he wants us to be able to go into a den of hungry lions and know that he's there we we just pick up the see the the hebrew children live by that law and that's the reason that they was able to stand there and tell the king we know our god is able but whether he delivers us from this furnace or he doesn't deliver us from this furnace the one thing we know is that we're not going to bow down to your image why why why because that would break the law of god and we're not going to break the law of god we would rather just die in this fire than to break the law of god remember esther when she went in before the king she said if i die i die but to this end i was born and so she she went in before the king and if he hadn't held out that golden scepter it meant her life but she was determined that she was not going to break the law of god she wasn't going to be subdued by fear she wasn't going to be subsumed by anxiety i want to tell you something brothers and sisters when you get to walking with the holy ghost the way the holy ghost wants to walk with you satan has no power over you as a matter of fact brother branham said that he will become as powerless when you get the revelation that you can do the greater works amen and you know that there's two spirits that's working in the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit you discern and you withstand the evil spirit then satan is going to be completely powerless before us that's a law of god but we have to do what it says and we take the spirit of god which is the word of god and the word of god is the discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart and when you discern a bad spirit you you withstand it but you don't withstand it with vengeance and bitterness and wrath and anger you exercise the law of god and the law of god is love and with divine love and feeling in your heart for the most aggravating soul that ever comes against you and you pray for that man's soul so that he too can understand the law of god and be saved now we know there's only a certain certain seed that can be saved but we pray for all men irregardless so now this there was a law there's a law in this bird and he says now he says he has to know how to operate that law and it's built to he's built to possess that law and brother brahm says well i'm feeling religious he says now we have a law he said we have a law and the law of life is in us you remember what paul said he was sitting there struggling in romans 7 and he said the things that i would do i find myself not doing and the things that i don't want to do i find myself doing and he said oh oh wretched man that i am he said who's going to deliver me from the body of this death he said i thank god through jesus christ what did he do he came into the holiest of holies sprinkling the blood of jesus christ on the mercy seat he said so then with my mind i serve the law of god but with my flesh i serve the law of sin and one of the greatest understandings that you will have is that no matter how close you get to god your flesh is still going to be sticky and your flesh has got to be kept in control that's why paul told the romans in romans 6 16 he said that to whom you yield your remembered servants to obey he said his servants you are whether it be obedience under life or or or sin unto death those two laws are still with us the law of sin and death but what did he do he went on hallelujah and he broke into romans chapter 8 and he said the law of the spirit of life in jesus christ [Applause] i stole that hive from brother kelly i'm sorry brother kelly they say imitation they say they say they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery [Laughter] oh that's all good i started i'm starting to feel religious myself the law of the spirit listen to this the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus has made us free is that right is this right and he whom the son has made free is free do you see the law the law of the spirit this is the life that's in us it's a resurrection and it's in you you don't have to knock down to the devil you don't have to give in to fear you don't have to give in to anxieties somebody comes along and says you've got stage four cancer i want to tell you something brothers and sisters if you're walking with god every day of your life just a simple every day walk walk walk one step at a time so then the doctor says well you got stage four cancer you got six months to live you know what you say i had a friend of mine that had that same thing happen to a brother stephen but she was she came down with leukemia she had just come from did you know sister friend sister kelly from from down there around dc anyways you may not have known her but but she she had uh she went out to the ohio youth camp with us and she spent the whole week out there we had a wonderful time and when she came back she started feeling a little bit sick and so she went to the doctor and got an examination and after she got the examination the doctor said well you got leukemia and says you've got about uh what'd she say six weeks to live six weeks to live that was it she went from being perfectly healthy out there in in in the ohio youth camp to having six weeks to live and brother stephen she looked at her husband his name was richard and she and he said she said to him she said richard she says this is a win-win situation win-win well her husband didn't have the faith that she did brother stephen and he said what are you talking about the man just said you've got six weeks to live and she said richard just think of it so just think of it richard six weeks from now i'm either going to be in the presence of the lord jesus christ [Applause] or we're gonna have one of the biggest testimonies to spread around the world because that man just said i'm gonna die in six weeks let me tell you some saints of god when you operate this law that's in you it's in you just like a bird can spread its wings and defy the law of gravity i want to tell you something you can spread your wings of faith and you can defy the law hallelujah of sin and death it has no more power over you [Applause] and i want to tell you something saints it makes you live holy all your desires all your desires i wish we had time to read the rest of that in second corinth second thessalonians or uh second first thessalonians chapter four the rapture chapter he's talking about getting rid of all the the nonsense and possessing your vessels and sanctification this is not a dirty god we're servant we're serving a holy god and i want to tell you something we have permission by the blood of jesus christ to enter into the holiest of holies but brother don't go in there with a filthy spirit he set us free we're free we're free we're no longer bound now he says i'm starting to feel religious the only thing you have to do now listen carefully these words these are powerful powerful words and i want to tell you something i love this prophet i love this prophet i want to tell you something you know what i feel bad for i feel sorry for people who have walked away from this message i really do i pray i pray that if there's now there's some that's walked away i don't think there's any hope for them that they've crossed the line but i do believe that there are some that have followed their bad example and those are the ones i pray for my heart is yearning for those seeds i want those brothers to see the error of their way and i don't ever want to lose that burden because i believe that there's some good people that have turned away from this message and all they need to do is get turned back around and they're going to be all right amen hallelujah so pray with me on that i pray for a lot of them dear souls because i and sometimes you don't know who is and who isn't but we pray for him and we believe so he says here he says um let me catch my point here he said you're you are made and born and placed here the body of christ as sons and daughters of god you don't have to knock down to the devil there that's what he said i was i was just saying what he said you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law and that's the law of the holy spirit the only thing you know only thing you have to do the only thing you have to do [Music] is to know how to let go and let god now listen to this as brother steven's been saying take your car off the steering wheel and put the car in neutral my son's got this saying whenever he gets in a bit of a pinch he says oh jesus take the wheel yeah he said jesus take the wheel i looked at him i said what'd you take the wheel from him for to begin with you didn't have no business taking out his thing to begin with if you hadn't took it out of his hands you wouldn't be able to ask him to take it back and maybe he'll listen to this tape you don't have to knock down to the devil we got a law that's the law of the holy ghost the only thing you have to know how to do is let go and let god you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let god that's all if the fish say wait i'll catch my breath uh uh real good and i'll breathe up a little bit auction and see if i can go down no he does that and he'll burst open see because he doesn't work on a human law in order for me to go down i gotta suck all the air and i can and then you gotta swim twice as hard because now you're trying to pull yourself down with all that air inside your lungs so you learn how to let it out a little bit of time as you go down you know what i'm talking about brother kelly but that's the way a human does it but fishes don't do it that way they got another law they live by you see and the birds they got another law they live by but i'm here to tell you the rest of that story because we living underneath the anointing of the mighty eagle amen and i want to tell you something all we have to do is set our faith old testament set our faith new testament and then don't turn your back to the wind you just face the wind so we got into a bible study the other day in the living room we have a good time in our living room don't worry trees we have a great time in our living room now look remember we were talking he was talking the other day about congress used to have a chair for god to sit in okay well my chair is on on this side of the room on the other side of the room and there's an empty chair right there and i've told her many times i said teresa i didn't have any of that on my mind when we sat down here to talk about him i said he's here in this room and he's talking to us and she's a hungry little soul because i want to tell you something when she starts to pulling on side of me and stuff starts pouring out of me and i'm thinking where did all of this come from it's just those springs that jesus said will be bubbling up and they asked the little brain they said what bubbles use it because i'm drinking premium he says no there's just something that's bubbling me it's a law saints and we got this law of the eagle now look the holy spirit is here to take care of every problem that you have and the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death where did the law of sin and death get started where did the lost and death get started the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die and to eat of it she had to disbelieve god's word and sin is to disbelieve god's word and because that she disbelieved god's word she walked away from life and the only thing left was death and from that day the day you shall surely die somebody says well adam and eve didn't die on that day well i beg your pardon the bible says that one day with god is as a thousand years with man and a thousand years with man is one day with god and the oldest man that ever lived was methuselah and he was 969 years so then not one man has ever lived a full god day not one man he keeps his word he knows what he's talking about and i want to tell you something when you think brother branham said something that ain't in the bible i just want to tell you you just keep on looking because it's in there amen and if you have trouble finding it come find brother shimbo because he's got a quote i tell you that brother got a quote [Applause] but there's one thing that brother won't do he won't make a quote up when he says he got a quote he got a quote and he'll bring it to you and if you could hear what the quote says and you can align it with the word now we're talking about rest we're talking about resting in his promises now i want to show you something here over in isaiah 28 it says line okay how many points does it take to make a line how do you get this thing i always wanted i wanted to do this i knew there'd be something in my service i just had to come over here to the board you know i just line up online you say brother sam you're just putting a bunch of dots up there it takes at least two dots to make a line right anybody and remember they're how about some of you younger ones is that right it takes two dots to make a line two points two points at least two points you don't have a line if you don't have two points if you just gotta that's why we know baptism in the name of the father son holy ghost isn't any it isn't a revelation because it's only once in the bible that's just one point but now you take baptism name of jesus christ you got point on point on point on point and it just keeps on going we still baptizing that way on out into eternity but look this is what i'm trying to show you here a line upon line lying upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little and he said this is the rests this is rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and you shall find rest unto your souls that's right so so when we can see the word of god lined up genesis all the way to revelations revelations 10 1 seven what was it eight eleven see down here we're eating the book we're eating the book down there but there's a desperation that has to come into our souls and you know what brother branham said the reason that we lack desperation he says it's because we lack love we lack love and we need to have more uh intimate close relationship with this god of love i told i was telling teresa the other day the closer i get to god the richer my love for her gets the more i i want her to be happy i i don't care if i'm happy it doesn't matter if we go out to eat if i can't eat at my restaurant it doesn't matter i want her to be happy and i want to tell you something that's exactly what christ love is for us because the evidence that i love my wife that way is that's the evidence that christ loves us the way i love her because he said husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself for it was that in your class with the young men you know you don't have to say so that's all right i think it was i think it was it has to be but you know what i like about brother shambo now brother stephen yes and i used to think it was just his african way of talk you know take take take revelations 10. take take take matthew chapter five take i thought that was just something that they did in africa or something like that i never ever heard anybody say take take take take this scripture take but he's saying take the book he's saying take it take the book and when you take the book [Applause] see you're forgetting that when he's speaking up here it's not him speaking he'll tell you that it's the holy spirit that gives him an utterance and it's because jesus christ now look it take this the right way but we can understand all the mysteries paul said this and if we don't have charity it profits us nothing nothing so with all of our getting let's not forget the main thing the main thing is the literal life of jesus christ which is the love of god come back upon the believers and i'll never forget how many times i've talked to theresa and i said honey i don't i i'm glad for the victories that god has given us and i'm glad that i like that woman said she says i thank god she said i want to give us a testimony she says i praise the lord she says i ain't what i want to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to be and that's the way i feel about it but i'm not satisfied i am not satisfied with just little victories in my life i am not going to be happy my brothers and sisters until i look into the mirror of god's word and i'm like that little boy that came up out of the country remember brother brown talked about that talked about the little boy come up out of the country and he did he didn't know what a mirror was and he was walking through his grandma's hallway there and she had a full-length mirror and she come up there and he started looking and he saw a little boy in there and he waved his hand the little boy waved his name [Music] and he shook his head and the little boy shook his head and then he turned around and said mama that's me that's me and what i want to do is i want to look into the life of jesus christ i'm not talking about the have my hair the way his hair is but i want my conduct i want my character i want my behavior do you know something that in this holy ghost in this law that we have we've been given fruit and jesus didn't just give us any kind of a fruit he said my peace i give unto you he said my joy i give unto you and paul said this over in galatians chapter 2 and verse 20 he said i'm crucified with christ amen now does anybody know what it means when somebody's crucified one by one give it a stab a try what does it mean if somebody's crucified it means they're dead they're dead somebody that's crucified is dead right but he said yet i live he said i'm crucified with christ yet i live but the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god the life that he was living on isaac was not that his faith it was the faith of jesus christ because he had the life of jesus christ came back upon him and that's what the holy spirit is you have his love you have his joy you have his peace now the the struggle that we have is that each of us have our own will it's called self-will jesus had his own will and what did jesus do when he surrendered his will to the father he prayed sincerely for three hours he prayed he went away for an hour he come back he found his disciples sleeping and what was his prayer nevertheless not my will but thy will be done what time are we supposed to be finished brother shambo i'm just i'm just enjoying myself he said and then he come back again and he he went out and he prayed and he said father if it be possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done now he did that three times and if jesus was that sincere in his prayer to surrender his will to the father then i just want to ask you a question how much more sincere must we be let's go over to the book of jude amen it's only got one chapter and i'll find it i don't think i wrote it down let me get there jude down there in verse 20. he says but you beloved let me just stop there this word beloved this is not just a word that he uses for any whole body this word beloved you know what the greek word for beloved is it's agapeto you take the word agapo it's agape my dearly beloved one and that's what you are in the eyes of god you're a cherished child of god he knows he watches for when you wake up in the morning because he wants you to be smiling he said but she beloved bri building up your selves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life now let's turn back over to matthew and the sixth chapter he said building up yourselves in your most holy faith praying in the holy spirit in matthew chapter 6 and verse 7 jesus is teaching us he says and when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathens do for they think they shall be heard for much speaking be not like unto them now listen your father your father knows what things you have need of before you ask now let's watch this how in this prayer jesus teaches us to bring our will subject to the father okay that's what this prayer is all about and this prayer if you can get alone in a closet you know why jesus told us to go into a closet because when you're alone in the closet you've already cut off five of your senses that can interfere with you you can't see anything you can't taste anything you can feel anything but but that isn't gonna hinder you you see you're cutting off you're cutting yourself off and this is what we need to do that's why just i mean i pray when i'm going down the road i pray when i'm on the job i pray when i'm when i'm mowing the yard because the bible says pray without ceasing but there's that time where you just set aside and brother branham said the problem of it is is so many times we do all the talking and he says we don't do any listening when when jude is talking about building up your most holy uh faith in the praying in the holy ghost he's talking about when you isolate your soul you isolate your soul and so let me show you what happens so you get down before you're before the lord in your closet you close the door behind you it's quiet there's nothing can disturb you you you got the phone turned off you told your wife look honey i'm going to be gone for a little bit i'm going to talk to papa god i'll i like han and papa gone you know the value of real estate is based on location location location the value of your relationship with god is your relationship your relationship your relationship if to you he's a big fierce monster that wants to squash you every time you make a mistake you're not gonna have a very intimate relationship with that guy but boy when you see him as papa god when you see somebody you can go to and he hears you do you know what he said he loves you so much this is it boggles my mind satan's got to be good at what he does boggles my mind how can satan convince people that a god of love wants to squash him you know even if you go back in in the old testament when when god was given moses the law and he introduced himself he said that he was a god that was plenteous in mercy and gracious and kind and tenderhearted as he was giving him the the ten commandments written in the stones where was i at where was i at help me out here matthew 6 7. yes so yeah i know where i was at thank you brother that pulled me back on track and so so now you're alone now you got your five senses they're they're they're they so they can't interfere with you you're in a dark room it's quiet you're all by yourself your eyes are closed but then what happens then your your reasoning starts to work and your imagination starts to work and you start memorizing your memory starts kicking in all those five senses that contact your spirit realm and it's hard to block them things out because they're just there and so the other morning i got up to pray and i wanted to pray i want to get my my soul i want to get my soul isolated with god i didn't want my my my my five senses of the flesh to interfere and i didn't want the five senses of my spirit to interfere because there's only one sense there's only this is why we have to build up our most holy faith when we're praying because there's only one sense oh my god that will contact god that will put you in this relationship with god that you can refer to him as your papa god you don't like and he's watching over you and he wants you to cast all your cares on him because he cares for you and all you have to do is learn how to operate that law that's already in you and so i was there and i was starting to pray and all of a sudden oh this imagination was coming up and that imagination was coming up and it was so much interference and i thought i just wasn't going to be able to get isolated alone with god and i wanted just uh i just wanted to spend some time i wanted my soul to bask in his presence because in his presence brother stephen it's the fullness of children and i don't have a hangover i don't i get addicted but it's to him and so you know what i did i said devil i i did i said devil i know you're here and i said i'm going to talk to god and i said if you want to pray with me i said there's room right here i said just pull yourself get down here on your knees and i said we'll pray together now i'll pray for a little while i'll listen you pray for a little while you know what it wasn't too long i was alone with god i was all alone with god he didn't want none of that he didn't want not because i was going to pray whether he was going to stay there or not now let me give one last uh a bit here before we close sometimes i'll get up to pray and usually it's early in the morning about two one thirty two o'clock i get up to pray i want to tell you something that's a good time to pray all the devils have gone to sleep and i got up and i went out in the living room and i got down on my knees where i normally pray brother stephen i couldn't feel nothing it's just like i thought what am i doing i said i don't feel god god's not here i said i'm gonna get down on my knees what am i doing talk to the couch you know do you ever get just you just feel like you're all by yourself and then just like that now listen this is very important because this is walking by faith this is what faith in god's word will do for you now i couldn't feel him i felt like there was nothing in the room but i remembered in his word and in his word he said i will never leave you and i'll never forsake you and i said devil you're a liar you're trying to contend tell him tell me because i can't feel him in my spirit or i can't feel him in my my senses that he's not here but i've got his word and he said that he'll never leave me and he'll never forsake me and so i started to pray and i had one of the best times of prayer with god that i've ever had in my life but if i would have just given him because it couldn't feel him i couldn't sense him it just didn't feel like he was there there was nothing there see it's walking by faith and when we can rest he said come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and you shall find rests rest unto your soul and so let's say that you're going through your day and you're starting to go into a hard hard trial do you know what the bible says about the hebrew children it said that they did not enter into his rest though the works were finished from the foundation of the world because when the word was preached it wasn't mixed with faith they didn't have any faith in it and therefore because they didn't have any faith in it it didn't do many good they never could rest on his promises but when you come up against the problem it just seems like like today it just seemed like everything that theresa and i tried to do it just seemed like it just went upside down and so it would have been very easy for us just to get discouraged and say well not i don't maybe maybe some something's wrong here but god left us great and precious promises and peter taught us it's by these great and precious promises that we become partakers of his divine nature but if we don't believe what the bible says we will never become a partaker of his divine nature he wants you to have his peace he wants you to have his joy he wants you to have the love of god in your heart not just a little bit of love but he wants you to have passionate love and he wants you to be able to look in the most impossible situations and still be able to believe his word and how do you do it you do it by faith and i'm going to tell you something here saints that we're going to take the rapture the same way that we overcome a common cold just by simple faith in what god said god's the one that said this mortality will put on immortality [Music] god's the one that said this corruptible will put on incorruption now if we're alive and remain we're still mortals we're not corrupted yet because we ain't been dead four days so we're the ones that are alive and remain will be the mortals that put on immortality and those that's gone on before us they corrupted so they're going to put on incorruption they're going to be raised up first we're going to be changed in a moment in the 20th clinton eye and we'll be joined together with them in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen now i just want to give you a little insight here the way that your body is going to be changed from mortal to immortal listen closely here because satan is trying to get us to believe that we can put off till tomorrow before we start getting this intimate walk with god and if he can convince you that then when it comes time for the rapture there will be nothing inside of you to quicken your mortal bodies if you read with me romans 8 11 it said if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he said if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you then he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by what by the spirit that dwells in you how did the spirit get in you do you ever think about that how come the spirit's in you and it's not in somebody else i'm going to tell you how can i come in can i come in can i come in he keeps knocking and knocking and one day you're walking along and you hear that knock he says can i come in and he said why sure and you went over he opened up the door and jesus come in you have to open the door but let's be honest friends we don't want to just open the door and then tell him sit down and and don't you mess with my personal life don't you start messing with my the way that i look i'm an american woman if i want to have a bossy spirit i'll have a bossy spirit but but the bible says that a meek and a quiet spirit is of great price in the sight of the lord well i'll have you to know i'm i'm yeah i don't want to hear that well you're not going to get it because he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says now look it's a it's it's a walking and it's a talking with god and we're going to be tested along the way but i want to tell you how easy god makes it on you how many has ever been in school and the teacher said friday we're going to have a test friday we're going to have a test but on this test you bring your textbook in and you can open the book he gave us an open book right he gave us an home book [Applause] it gets better it gets better it gets better oh my somebody say it gets better and better so anyways well he knows some people have a hard time finding things in the book like me oh i do i have a hard time finding sometimes sometimes i'll read write over something i'll say where's that answer where's i'm looking right at it i can't see it but our god loves us so much he said my yoke is easy he said my burden is light he said come learn of me now if you're learning of him what's that make you a student you're a student and this teacher he loves you so much he gives you an open book so you can just open the book and you can find the answers but if you have a hard time finding the answers do you know what else he said he could do he said you could come up to him quietly now don't talk out into the class but come up and whisper in his ear and say jesus i'm having a problem finding this answer and you know what he'll do if you ask he'll give it to you if you seek you'll find and if you knock it shall be open and he told you if you just come to me in your prayer closet and you'll talk to me you see sister kelly i appreciate the fact that brother kelly has got such a lovely spirit and he's always excited and exuberant and in the holy ghost but that's brother kelly brothers even what brother kelly god ain't helping me none i want it for myself i want it for myself brother seth i got to have this jesus for me and i don't care how what whatever your situation that you're in right now no matter how troubled your soul is this peace it's for you but it has to be you have got to want it more than you want your necessary meat the bible and you want it with all your heart and all your mind and it reminds me of one time i was walking through walmart not through walmart but in the parking lot and this man came running across the parking lot brother stephen just as hard as he could go just running running running around and he stopped saying hey yo brother i said yeah i said what what can i do for you he said see you got any spare change he says i i i i'm homeless i said you look pretty healthy to me why are you homeless he said i can't give me a job i said you kidding me have you looked around here you can't go by one of these establishments but they looking for help what you mean you can't find a job i said you ain't looking very hard young man amen i want to tell you something this holy spirit is here and it's in he said that if you lack wisdom if you lack wisdom all you have to do is ask you ask and he will give it to you how will he give it to you anybody know liberally and you know what he won't come around and see chastise you and say what you've been in this message for 40 years and you asking a simple question like that he's just happy you finally turned around and asked and then i'm preaching to myself so anyways and then james goes on to say that when you get this wisdom it'll be peaceable and it will be gentle and it will be easy to be entreated there's no bitterness there's no god there's no jealousy there's no envy when you get this holy spirit the way god wants you to have it you want everybody to have it and you just want to pour it out and let me just say this jesus said it's more blessed to give than to receive didn't he well i want to tell you something you're more you're more blessed you're more blessed when you're giving love than when you're being loved and that's the truth the more that you give the more that you'll have love is the one thing that you can't give too much of and the most unlovable people they're the ones that need it the most remember brother branham went into a restaurant and the server they didn't give him very very good service and and so at the they were getting ready to leave and he left i think like a five or ten dollar tip was a big tip back in those days and he left it there and the brother looked at him said why did you do that she gave us terrible service and he said because she needed it he he was able he knew she needed it and that's why that he gave it to her and brothers and sisters this world this world that we're living in now you know what they need more than anything else you know what they're craving for and they don't even know it they want to be loved they want to be loved and they have no love the only true love there is is amongst the bride amen there's no lack of love amongst the bride y'all can stand the musicians can come god bless you i hope a little bit of something was said that can encourage somebody all i know is that it's very simple this walk is very simple and it's it's it's an open book test and if you have any questions finding any of the answers all you got to do is ask him let's bow our heads and pray father god in jesus name we're so grateful father to you for your mercy and for your grace and our lives lord and lord there's none of us that deserve to have you in our lives lord but lord jesus we sure do appreciate all that you've done for us lord lord when we look and we see your life making itself known in us father it gives us such a desire lord god to stay in your presence it gives us a hunger and a thirst and for righteousness sake lord and father we just pray lord jesus christ that we can yield ourselves to your spirit so that you can express yourself out through us to this lost into this dying world and we ask this all in the name of jesus christ amen amen how many enjoy the service amen [Applause] let's go and let god have what easy amen easy without any headache amen blessed be the name of the lord so god gave us a law amen and the law of the spirit of life we know that it's greater than the law of sin and death it is not true that is greater it's the law in you that is greater amen uh repeat it over and over and the holy spirit wanted to emphasize over and over this walk is not a complicated walk amen the message itself is not complicated amen the purpose of the ministry is not to make the message complicated it is to actually take the message and then break it down until you can see it clearly and say now i can see you can see not the preacher but you're seeing your husband amen i don't know what you're going through but somebody is struggling somebody is still living on the humanistic level and they don't want to go they don't want to let it go amen somebody's still struggling trying to use their own mind to leave a christian walk that's what i have been hammering just keep telling you to take your hand off your will amen it's difficult brother branham say it's hard because man have a tendency to always do something because since the garden of eden when men fell before even god come to help him he already figured out something to cover himself he never even could wait and say okay we already messed up what do we do let's wait for god to come then we're going to explain god what happened as soon as he messed up the first thing that happened he started fixing stuff his own way and he thought that work but when he approached the presence of god humanistically you could look at adam and eve and see them covered by fig leaves it worked for them humanistically but when god came to adam where are you adam never responded to god and say god i am clothes i am clothed here he never say that where are you why are you hiding yourself i thought he was closed already he saw fake leaves if god calls you tonight are you gonna tell him i'm naked no you have clothes you're not gonna say that why was adam dressed and then he can tell god he was closed because he showed that what man can do is not able to stand in the presence of god amen god was not coming down to just chase them or kill them or whatever he was just coming down looking for his children amen coming down to rescue his children god already knew what's going to happen amen so it is not a difficult walk it has that's why you heard brother branham say the greatest enemy that i have is not my neighbor brother branham say the greatest enemy that i have is myself it's that person that when they preach and they say stop wearing nails that person doesn't listen that person keep going and putting nails that person is looking for every single way out or excuse to run away amen that's your enemy that's the person it doesn't mean that you need to take a gun and shoot yourself no brother branham say if you can overcome that person you can overcome every enemy amen because the real trouble that start start really within us brother branham say the battle has been raging since eden brother branham is raging in us not outside of us inside of us amen so the easiest way the brother gave uh examples here tonight is very simple very simple amen it's not complicated just take god at his word you remember a few sunday but i'm saying when you take god at his word it's the biggest blow that the devil is receiving amen take god that his word doesn't mean that what you have is gone did you hear what i say did you hear what i say when michael angelo had the vision of moses he wanted to build the image of moses the masterpiece the first thing he did he went into a place and saw a bunch of rocks amen when he saw rocks he went there and he picked up one rock why didn't he pick up the other one and pick to that one amen because michelangelo looked at different rocks and he saw that this one can reflect moses amen when he picked up the rock and pull it but random is telling you that is what is called justification but if you look at the rock he doesn't have anything that looks like moses matter of fact there is filthy or whatever was around where the rock was laying for years amen but in the process of time when michelangelo brought that rock he began to chip away not moses do you know what he was chipping away everything in that rock that was not moses amen amen did you hear me oh my blessed be the name of the lord this is the rock moses is inside here everybody clear when monkey angelo picked the rock moses was there if michelangelo tells you this is moses you'll be looking at where is moses but through vision he can see moses in the rock amen but moses was covered with different parts of the rock that didn't belong to moses do you hear me so the work of michelangelo michael angelo michael angelo michael the archangel did you hear that now why did brother branham pick michelangelo do you think he just picked michelangelo because the name is good he was telling you it's michael the archangel why was he talking about why did that man michelangelo had to uh uh sculpt a man called moses why only moses why he didn't pick up joshua go look in the book of jude you're gonna see michelangelo talking about the body of moses anybody clear so when michelangelo picked this all he was doing over the year was removing every rock that is not moses do you hear me and after a while the image begin to come up clearly like okay this is the cheek of moses this is the nose of moses and until you reach a point where every single portion of the rock that was not moses was completely off then he himself got stirred up and he wanted that moses to do what you see where the power of the spoken word lies amen all you have to do is just accept his chipping and let him do the chipping that's the problem if he says stop makeup don't stop makeup in church and go home and do makeup and then post it on facebook don't do that you're wasting your time when he's when he's talking about stop your filthy living just stop it don't go there leave a fearful living and come here i'm trying to act like christian just stop it when he says stop a bad friendship stop it you can go up there and before you know it you're not fooling anybody at the end of the day you're gonna find yourself that you were fooling yourself we all knew we were just watching you why are you hiding why is he hard you don't have to feel it how many times sometimes you're trying to pray and you start praying you feel like you can't pray and if you start forcing you pray a little bit you pray a little bit after a while you just feel free why did you feel free because you were persistent amen there's two ways either you can stay persistent and the devil will understand that this really mean business and he takes away but if you're not persistent then you're gonna go back again and say maybe i don't feel good i just need to go ahead and sit maybe the holy ghost is not here i'm not feeling anything i need to go ahead and sit by the same would have missed that prayer meeting amen so whether you feel it or not the senses whether it's you you you smell it or not if god say take it away take that tight dress away just take that dress and put it in the garbage when you do that automatically you have called heaven to come and back you up just by doing that but if we look at you we're gonna see the desire of that dress that's not your problem you cannot remove the desire and say desire come out no you cannot do that you need a higher power you need a higher law that need to come into your life and swallow that desire like the snake of moses god need to send something to take it out but the first thing is you must obey you must obey very easy god told israel don't go to work stay home that's it what is the problem did i give you food yes did that double your food yes tomorrow do not go outside to pick up the manner did you hear me yes in the morning israel woke up again and pick up the mana trying to find the manner the what was the motive of going outside did you have money did you have food yes why did you go all he asked you training israel in obedience but israel would not listen until you say you know what let me get a whooping a little bit babylon come and take them whoop them a little bit then bring them back whoop them a little bit and bring it back it's so easy but stephen i cannot overcome this but stephen this is keep coming over and over what is the desire of your heart what do you want are you really at the point of decision to say i'm sick and i'm tired of this thing i wanted to go if you get to that point and you just take god at his word god will send a backup from heaven and you will see that it won't be complicated and it will go when it happened to the first thing the second thing the third thing everything will go away why is somebody else living a christian laughing you are the only one struggling why i want to be happy i want to live a clean life i want to be happy in my marriage why should i suffer all the time amen why should i suffer at home why why am i the only one struggling why learn to obey obedience is better than sacrifice amen when god unfolds something here through a minister and show you you need prayer we're not telling you when you go home you're going to be professional praying five hours that's not what we're saying but if you go home and you sit you say father you spoke to us about prayer i'm gonna take my time and spend time in prayer with you today might be five minutes tomorrow fifteen tomorrow twenty before you know it you're gonna break in channels of prayer when you don't even know what time you started and what time you're gonna end and before you know it the lord will begin to unfold things over and over remember hypocrisy you're just hurting yourself you're just fooling yourself you're just wasting your time somebody's growing with the lord you're just missing the great blessings all you have to do is not to force your christianity is not to run away from it like brother sam say you spread your wing you spread your wing you need to face that situation you need to face the storm and you will see that same storm that you think is coming to pull you down god will use that and then shoot you up again to the higher level amen all god wants you to do is do just a load of obedience amen obey him you don't have to feel it i put the tape asleep that's not your problem if you did that tape by obedience not because of duty that's a that's a law no i'm doing this because you told me to do it that's a different story it's up to god to back his word not back you back his word when he's backing his word and you're standing on that word automatically you get backed up so young people older whoever is streaming tonight remember stop fooling yourself you're wasting your time god is requiring the walk every day take your struggle take your problem go with them in the closet and tell that problem me and you we will talk with the maker that is the secret we have not gotten into it yet but that is the secret of the second banquet of esther that is the secret because she took heaven not me talking to the king him and he's not there no human must be there when i'm talking to the king you see that is the secret and you need to see where did esther took heaven later on we're going to get into it and you will remember some of the stuff our brother spoke tonight that is the key take that problem pull it to the lord drag him if he say you don't want to go you say no no no no no you were with me all this day i was smoking all day now that i'm trying to go to church you trying to stay outside and me going to church and being like a hypocrite no you come with me let's go to church because when i was in when i was in closet you were with me when i was in the kitchen you were with me when i was in the work you were with me come with me let's go back again everywhere i'm going you got to be there and let's see how he's going to stand amen but don't take that and put it there and come here and make holy no you're wasting your time you're wasting your time bring that here and say father you see this this is the problem i don't know how to get rid of this problem and you'll see the problem begging you amen he got to go by the same give a clear example i was sitting here the devil you want to pray with me no problem you take your place there let me pray let's pray together when i pray i finish i say oh okay you start again it didn't take long and it's going to go amen amen i know someone from my family my mother's family back home was smoking smoking smoking and this is not even preach this is just normal and i'm gonna close here so he got sick and they went to see the doctor and they took opportunity of that uh uh that sickness and they told the doctor tell him he got sick because of cigarette which was not the truth do you hear me and the doctor said you got sick because of the cigarette if you don't leave it this is what's gonna happen to you they use a doctor lying okay he thought the doctor was telling him the truth do you know what he did do you know what he did he took apart he went and bought a pack of cigarettes and brought it home and put it in a table and he spoke to the pack of cigarette he said you cigarette this is the last day you got into this month you're gonna sit right there and we're gonna see between me and you who's gonna touch the other and that was the end of that man never smoke again under a lie what about you under the vindicated truth of the hour when the seals are open when the book is plainly open and cigarette can continue to linger and pornography can continue to linger and the nails continue to linger and uh and the short dresses continue to linger and all these uh craziness continue to linger why why god want that personal walk talk to him walk with him every day he will take care of your problem let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love and your mercy for speaking to us tonight lord father using your servant father there is no way you can speak like this without someone still stubborn in their own way and don't want to let go and let you have the control of their life but lord we also know that when you speak like this your word when it's sent to your children it is sent to heal them and to judge the sin that was in their life lord father may you bring that healing power in the body and may you give that special grace that will unfold a special revelation to your children to know how to take the law of life the law of the spirit of life and put it into action in their life so that they can be freed completely lord and live a victorious life lord father you spoke to us through this humanistic lord and father you pointed how humanistic is causing us all the trouble lord father with our five senses and lord the father outlet of the spirit but father this is the time we cannot continue to say that the bride will live under privilege the bride will live under privilege they gotta be a place where we gotta stop and say now it is the time that i'm gonna be living at the level that you have predestinated me to leave because your word stated lord father that we overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony it is time to confess that which you have lord predestinated us to be lord and to walk into that vision lord and father experience the benefit of the cross lord i pray in the name of jesus christ that you protect your children may you continue to consecrate them lord and may lord you protect them are they going to their respective place father remember the meeting lord and those that are already on the road traveling lord and those that will stay here father we commit everything unto the hand and we claim the blood of the lamb for the protection of those traveling and the church remaining here thank you lord father for speaking to us tonight strengthen your father your servant lord and thank you for using him lord we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen by the caliph we can lead us with one song and dismiss place i just give the lord a hand of praise amen the whole time they were preaching i was just thinking of god hiding within himself in simplicity amen god is just so simple you just sing one song before we go [Music] in the presence [Music] you know it just helped me out [Music] [Music] in the prayers [Music] of the kings [Music] [Music] of me [Music] are
