[42:41] different atmospheres

[42:49] just as a ritual
[42:54] but became lord because we're in need of
[42:56] all of you
[42:59] you know each one of us father
[43:02] you know all about us
[43:06] you know all of our prayers
[43:10] the burdens that are upon our hearts
[43:13] the stresses the strengths the questions
[43:21] and by your grace lord as you've been
[43:23] working with each one of us throughout
[43:25] our journey in this life
[43:28] you've brought us to a place lord and
[43:30] you're still bringing us to a
[43:33] more of a clarity father god to realize
[43:36] that you really are the all-sufficient
[43:38] god
[43:41] there's nothing too hard for you
[43:43] [Music]
[43:44] you are present among us lord you're

[43:49] you're within us heavenly father
[43:55] many times as we walk in life lord
[43:57] [Music]
[43:59] just by the course of life father we're
[44:01] not as mindful of that as we should be
[44:05] we're not as mindful of your presence
[44:10] but still you're there so father we ask
[44:13] tonight that you would help us
[44:17] help us in only the way that you can
[44:20] lord
[44:22] you know exactly how to minister to our
[44:25] hearts
[44:27] and lord we invite you tonight to just
[44:30] have your way
[44:31] [Music]
[44:33] we don't know what we need lord just
[44:35] like my children at home
[44:37] many times they think they know what
[44:39] they need lord or they don't
[44:41] really know what they really need
[44:45] and many times we may have a thought as
[44:47] to what we feel we may need lord but
[44:49] [Music]
[44:51] you know all things you know exactly
[44:53] what we need lord so i pray that you
[44:55] help us to be open to that
[44:59] and even if if it may not seem like it
[45:01] lord let us be prayerful
[45:05] that your will might be revealed
[45:09] that your word might be understood in
[45:11] our hearts
[45:12] and that we might receive something
[45:14] farther
[45:16] that'll help us a little more along the
[45:18] way

[49:10] they get it and they can take a gander
[49:12] at it a little later
[49:14] praise the lord amen but nonetheless
[49:16] let's get right into the words i know
[49:18] it's a wednesday night
[49:20] and uh and people still have to go to
[49:22] work on tomorrow
[49:24] i'm one of them but i will say this
[49:28] it's when when everything was together
[49:31] still over at
[49:32] living word i the times that i would
[49:35] actually come
[49:36] and minister there i was working third
[49:39] shift
[49:41] and so when i would finish ministering
[49:43] there i would go straight to work
[49:45] and i when i would get to work i would
[49:48] be i would get to work
[49:49] several hours late because third shift
[49:52] starts at about seven eight o'clock
[49:55] so i would get to work several hours
[49:57] late but my frame of mind was lord if
[49:59] you called me to this you would take
[50:01] care of
[50:01] me so i would come and i would do what i
[50:04] felt in my heart god wanted me to do
[50:06] and then i would get to work and we had
[50:08] a point system so i knew they would take
[50:10] points away and i was just kind of
[50:11] counting the points down in my mind
[50:14] because when you get to a certain point
[50:15] you get terminated so i was counting the
[50:17] points up and one day i was talking to
[50:19] my manager and i asked
[50:21] i said i just wanted to ask you so i can
[50:23] be clear how many points do i have
[50:25] remaining
[50:26] you know coming to work two hours late
[50:28] all kind of stuff you know
[50:30] she looked at me and she said uh don't
[50:33] worry about it you're doing a good work
[50:37] i was like excuse me i've been late
[50:40] and i know i only have so many points
[50:43] say she wasn't taking no points for me
[50:45] from me
[50:47] and she was paying me for the time that
[50:49] i wasn't there
[50:54] praise the lord
[50:56] [Applause]
[51:00] amen so you know that was god praise the
[51:04] lord
[51:05] thank god for brother kelly amen a real
[51:08] soldier i thank god for him and his wife
[51:11] amen and brother kyle he's not here of
[51:13] course but
[51:14] i always thank god for him all right
[51:16] let's get into the word now
[51:19] uh in our bibles let's turn to luke
[51:21] chapter six
[51:27] luke chapter six
[51:35] we want to start at verse 27.
[51:43] luke 6 and 27 he says but i say unto you
[51:46] which here
[51:47] love your enemies do good to them which
[51:51] hate you
[51:52] bless them that curse you and pray for
[51:55] them which despitefully use you
[51:59] and as you would that men should do to
[52:01] you verse 31
[52:03] do ye also to them likewise
[52:07] for if you love them which love you he
[52:09] says what thank have you
[52:12] for sinners also love those that love
[52:14] them
[52:16] he says and if ye do good to them which
[52:18] do good to you
[52:19] what thank have you for sinners also do
[52:22] even the same and if ye lend to them of
[52:26] whom ye hope to receive
[52:28] what thank have you for sinners also
[52:31] lend to sinners to receive as much again
[52:36] he says but love your enemies and do
[52:39] good
[52:40] and lend hoping for nothing again
[52:44] and your reward shall be great and
[52:46] listen to this
[52:48] and ye shall be the children of the
[52:50] highest
[52:53] for he is kind unto the unthankful and
[52:56] to the evil
[52:57] father let's pray once more heavenly
[53:00] father
[53:02] help us lord have your way we ask in
[53:05] jesus christ's name
[53:06] amen god bless your saints
[53:20] as a topic tonight i want to
[53:23] try to approach the subject of the
[53:26] challenge
[53:27] of love
[53:30] amen the challenge of love
[53:42] i want to start off by just kind of
[53:46] bringing this to your remembrance from
[53:47] the message of that day at calvary
[53:51] he says now the first thing i want to
[53:53] say is jesus never lived for himself
[53:56] his life was spent for others
[54:01] it says that's perfectly eternal life
[54:04] when you say you go to church
[54:06] and you do good things that's fine he
[54:08] says but when you live your life to
[54:10] yourself you have an eternal life
[54:13] eternal life is living for others
[54:16] he says it proved it when it come in the
[54:19] lamb of god
[54:21] he lived and had eternal life because he
[54:23] did not live for himself
[54:25] he lived for others and you receive
[54:28] eternal life
[54:29] by receiving that day and you don't live
[54:32] for yourself no more you live for others
[54:35] he says someone said how can't now
[54:38] listen this is
[54:39] we're not going to be long tonight and i
[54:42] i didn't i didn't come just like i said
[54:44] i didn't come
[54:44] for a ritual um you know
[54:48] sometimes we get used to coming to
[54:50] church and things of that nature but
[54:53] god is he's alive
[54:56] and he speaks and he has specific things
[55:00] that he wants to communicate to his
[55:01] people
[55:03] you see the devil sometimes gets in our
[55:06] minds and we get into these routines and
[55:08] things of that nature
[55:09] and we have these schedules you know
[55:12] when we become religious
[55:14] and i'm not saying that about anybody in
[55:16] here per se but it's just
[55:18] it's the way things go we become
[55:20] religious and then and
[55:22] and in church church loses its value
[55:26] it's we kind of go through as they say
[55:28] the formalities of it
[55:31] but our minds and our hearts are not
[55:33] really engaged
[55:36] like it needs to be and that's the
[55:38] devil's tactic
[55:40] he want to put any and everything on our
[55:42] minds that shouldn't be on our minds
[55:45] to distract us because he doesn't want
[55:48] us to get closer or to climb high
[55:50] in the things of god and man so tonight
[55:54] i i came to yield myself that god might
[55:57] help me because he's ministered this to
[55:59] me
[56:00] so when i'm communicating to you tonight
[56:02] is something that he ministered to me
[56:03] himself
[56:04] so it's a burden on my heart i just want
[56:07] to be a help and a blessing to somebody
[56:10] so now notice this real carefully he
[56:12] said someone said
[56:14] how can you stand he says let anybody
[56:17] call you such bad name
[56:22] now the devil knows how to punch he's
[56:25] been around for a long time
[56:29] he's a master psychologist
[56:32] if there is a such but he he knows the
[56:36] human makeup he knows the human mind
[56:39] and he knows how to work with each
[56:40] individual
[56:42] each one of our courses of life are
[56:44] different amen but we
[56:46] we each have a man he he strategized
[56:49] remember the prophet taught us that he
[56:51] studies us
[56:53] he studies how you respond the thing he
[56:55] doesn't know you per se but he can throw
[56:58] certain things at you and then he sits
[57:00] back and watches how you respond to
[57:03] he watches your habits and brother
[57:04] branham said he watches how you handle
[57:06] the word
[57:10] so he sees when you're not praying like
[57:12] well i'm
[57:13] i'm gonna make it like a you i'm gonna
[57:14] say we
[57:16] he sees when we're not praying like
[57:18] we're supposed to
[57:19] he sees when we're not in the word like
[57:21] we're supposed to be
[57:23] and when he sees that we're at that
[57:24] point he noted at that time we're most
[57:27] vulnerable if he comes in at that time
[57:30] he he can draw from us the response he
[57:34] desires
[57:35] pulling us into his world and his frame
[57:38] of mind
[57:43] but likewise god is doing the same thing
[57:46] when we submit ourselves to god we
[57:48] humble ourselves before god
[57:50] allow ourselves to enter into prayer and
[57:53] into the reading of his word
[57:54] entering into that right atmosphere
[57:57] those same trials can come to us
[57:59] but the response would be different
[58:01] because there is more of a control that
[58:03] god has over your mind
[58:04] and your thoughts your reactions would
[58:08] be different
[58:10] you can't put that on
[58:13] you can act it out for a while
[58:16] but when it's when it's man-made when
[58:19] it's by willpower it ain't gonna last
[58:24] it'll reach its limit
[58:27] a person will find themselves unzipping
[58:30] and what was being bottled up on the
[58:32] inside will come pouring out
[58:38] so the way god designed this you can't
[58:40] make it you can't satisfy his will
[58:42] outside of what we're talking about
[58:44] tonight
[58:46] it's impossible how can you stand let
[58:50] anybody call you such bad names he says
[58:52] you don't live for yourself
[58:55] even though this is brother branham
[58:56] speaking this is not brother branham
[59:02] speaking
[59:04] what you're hearing right now as i as i
[59:06] as i quote these things to you
[59:09] is experiences in a place that brother
[59:12] branham
[59:12] climbed into by the grace of god but it
[59:16] was through
[59:16] many hard battles
[59:20] he didn't always get it all right
[59:23] his life story has been well explained
[59:25] to us isn't that right
[59:27] when he had chances too amen he was
[59:29] going to shoot the bull isn't that right
[59:31] when he had chances too he was going to
[59:33] kill human beings
[59:36] a long hard road but every bit of it was
[59:39] for his good
[59:41] i don't care how rough your road has
[59:43] been what you've gone through
[59:45] every bit of it was needful for you to
[59:47] become the person
[59:48] that god had in his mind from the
[59:50] beginning
[59:54] he told brother bradley he said you
[59:55] chosen the right way it's a harder way
[59:59] but it's my way
[1:00:03] it ain't easy
[1:00:08] but it's worth it
[1:00:14] he says you don't live for yourself you
[1:00:16] live for others that you might redeem
[1:00:19] that man casting your name out for evil
[1:00:24] amen this is beyond the human spirit
[1:00:29] when somebody has drugged your name and
[1:00:31] put your name out there
[1:00:32] spoken evil about you
[1:00:39] listen now this response that we we we
[1:00:41] can't study the message now
[1:00:43] you can't you can't study this and then
[1:00:45] when you're going through something try
[1:00:47] to remember what the prophet is saying
[1:00:49] no sir it's got to be by nature
[1:00:53] it's got to be from the inside of the
[1:00:55] inside they got to be a part of who you
[1:00:57] are
[1:01:04] so in these cases saints god listen god
[1:01:08] knows that we ain't going to always get
[1:01:10] it he knows that we're going to fail
[1:01:14] but in those failures god is helping us
[1:01:16] to see ourselves
[1:01:20] many times he got to deflate us
[1:01:23] sometimes we see ourselves in this place
[1:01:25] and we have such high thoughts of
[1:01:27] ourselves
[1:01:28] but god got to bring us to a place where
[1:01:30] we realize we
[1:01:31] are nothing you don't have no confidence
[1:01:35] in yourself
[1:01:38] amen brother branham said when god
[1:01:41] knocked paul down to that ground and his
[1:01:43] face was in that dirt
[1:01:44] he said that's where he was supposed to
[1:01:46] stay and that's where each one of us
[1:01:48] ought to go and to stay right there
[1:01:56] you live for others that you might
[1:01:58] redeem that man that's a whole nother
[1:02:00] thought
[1:02:01] they're persecuting you they're casting
[1:02:04] your name out for evil
[1:02:06] but the love of god is so in your heart
[1:02:11] until listen gentiles live like the old
[1:02:14] testament
[1:02:16] and i-49 are 2-4-2 if you talk about
[1:02:20] me i'm going to talk about you back uh
[1:02:22] whatever you do to me
[1:02:23] i want to get what we call it revenge
[1:02:27] amen but how many realize god don't work
[1:02:30] like that
[1:02:32] god will allow his children to respond
[1:02:34] like the world
[1:02:41] so while you're being talked about the
[1:02:44] spirit of god pulsating in your heart
[1:02:46] has you with thoughts of redeeming that
[1:02:48] person
[1:02:52] amen says we know how it feels when
[1:02:55] somebody hurts our feelings
[1:02:57] isn't that right when you catch wind of
[1:02:59] things of that nature
[1:03:00] you know how it feels it hurts you
[1:03:04] isn't that right you get caught up in
[1:03:05] your fear listen that's what the devil
[1:03:07] comes in
[1:03:10] you catch thing you catch wind of things
[1:03:12] that hurts you and that's very
[1:03:14] disturbing to your spirit and satan
[1:03:17] comes when you're in your
[1:03:18] long times or whatever and he ministers
[1:03:20] to you
[1:03:23] he tries to make you feel justified
[1:03:26] in in the way in which he's trying to
[1:03:29] lead you to feel
[1:03:31] you didn't even do nothing wrong with
[1:03:32] them
[1:03:34] all you've done was good why they
[1:03:36] talking about you like that
[1:03:38] why they handling you like that you have
[1:03:41] a listen
[1:03:41] you have a right you ain't got to say
[1:03:43] nothing to them no more
[1:03:47] you need to just avoid them as much as
[1:03:49] you can ain't the holy ghost
[1:04:00] remember he talks about living for
[1:04:01] others
[1:04:03] watch how he says these saints amen
[1:04:06] he says you become sons and the trouble
[1:04:09] of it is the church has forgotten they
[1:04:11] are they were sons
[1:04:13] you're a son you're taking christ's
[1:04:15] place you're a son so don't live for
[1:04:17] yourself live for others
[1:04:19] well brother branham i can live for this
[1:04:21] brother because he sure is a nice man
[1:04:25] isn't that how it rolls you meet
[1:04:28] somebody
[1:04:29] they got a good spirit about them very
[1:04:31] nice or whatever
[1:04:33] that kind of a person you enjoy being
[1:04:35] around
[1:04:36] that kind of person your mind's spending
[1:04:38] time with are doing things for
[1:04:40] they seem worthy of whatever it is you
[1:04:42] feel to do for them
[1:04:45] amen but watch how the prophet says this
[1:04:48] now
[1:04:49] he says well i can live for that brother
[1:04:51] because he sure is a nice man
[1:04:52] he says that's not it live for that man
[1:04:56] who hates you
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:02] i'm talking about amen i'm talking about
[1:05:04] grooming
[1:05:05] of sons and daughters of god being
[1:05:07] raised up to step into adoption
[1:05:10] with the mind of christ with the heart
[1:05:12] of god
[1:05:14] that's able to handle the father's
[1:05:16] business appropriately
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:23] he ain't asking us to do nothing that he
[1:05:25] didn't do himself
[1:05:28] he knew judas was a devil he knew he was
[1:05:30] going to betray him
[1:05:32] isn't that right but how did he conduct
[1:05:35] himself
[1:05:36] around judas he didn't slam the judas's
[1:05:38] name
[1:05:40] he didn't try to put nobody on to judas
[1:05:44] he let everything play out he let
[1:05:46] everything take his course
[1:05:49] amen now the brother said how hard was
[1:05:52] that
[1:05:53] for him to swallow that and knowing he
[1:05:55] was the one that was going to betray him
[1:05:58] but he held it that's what love of ducey
[1:06:02] i'm talking about a challenge of love
[1:06:04] i'm talking about god requiring
[1:06:06] something
[1:06:07] and then allowing your life to be set up
[1:06:09] in such a way
[1:06:10] where you encounter things that you have
[1:06:13] to overcome
[1:06:20] but the beauty of it is if he allow you
[1:06:23] to come in contact with it
[1:06:26] he gives you what you need to be able to
[1:06:28] overcome
[1:06:31] but you have to surrender well branham
[1:06:34] said you ain't even got a right to your
[1:06:36] own thoughts
[1:06:40] do you believe that let this mind be in
[1:06:43] you who's also in christ jesus
[1:06:49] amen he says live for that person who
[1:06:51] would kill you if they could
[1:06:54] that's what they done to him they killed
[1:06:56] him and he died
[1:06:57] that he might save them
[1:07:04] in the time that we're living in saints
[1:07:07] i've seen
[1:07:08] things that i never thought i would see
[1:07:12] and i know what god was doing when
[1:07:15] you're younger coming up in the way
[1:07:17] god knows you can't handle certain
[1:07:18] things amen
[1:07:21] that's why things that are happening now
[1:07:23] he didn't allow it to happen before
[1:07:26] you want to know why because he was
[1:07:27] nurturing his children
[1:07:29] he was building you up just like he did
[1:07:32] israel
[1:07:33] isn't that right he didn't take him the
[1:07:35] way he could have took them before amen
[1:07:37] he said that's when they saw battle they
[1:07:39] would repent and try to go back
[1:07:42] he took them another way so that they
[1:07:44] can gain experiences with him
[1:07:47] they can begin to know him amen in a way
[1:07:49] they never knew him before
[1:07:52] so that when they met them with their
[1:07:54] biggest battles
[1:07:55] they'll be fit now and ready to be able
[1:07:57] to
[1:07:58] move into it there's many things god
[1:08:02] kept
[1:08:02] us wrong amen
[1:08:05] i don't know about you but my battles
[1:08:07] now have become more and bigger than
[1:08:10] what i ever saw before
[1:08:12] amen but obviously if god is allowing
[1:08:15] that to come like that
[1:08:17] he knows you're ready for it greater is
[1:08:20] he it is in me
[1:08:21] than he that is in the world you ain't
[1:08:24] depending on yourself
[1:08:25] you need about this ain't about how
[1:08:27] witty you are how smart you are or how
[1:08:29] much you can retain or
[1:08:30] or none of that this is about the holy
[1:08:33] ghost
[1:08:35] dwelling on the inside of individuals
[1:08:37] that's able to yield to god
[1:08:40] that don't want their way no more you've
[1:08:44] died to yourself
[1:08:45] ashamed you've crucified your will
[1:08:49] you don't want your way no more
[1:08:52] you don't even know what you need no
[1:08:54] more
[1:08:56] every day you tell me tomorrow what you
[1:08:58] need where do you need to go where are
[1:09:00] you gonna go tomorrow
[1:09:01] well brother i'm gonna go to work that's
[1:09:03] what you say you don't know what
[1:09:05] tomorrow's
[1:09:06] going to bring
[1:09:09] throughout my course of life i've been
[1:09:10] laid off three times
[1:09:13] i was in the military for quite a period
[1:09:15] of time there what have you
[1:09:16] i didn't know what no layoff was in the
[1:09:19] military you just
[1:09:20] hired and you get paid and i get out
[1:09:23] here in the civilian world i got a good
[1:09:25] job making more money than i ever made
[1:09:26] before
[1:09:28] and all of a sudden i had a dream
[1:09:31] and in his dream i saw my team leader he
[1:09:33] was sitting at it that's what his back
[1:09:34] turned to me
[1:09:36] and in a dream it was clear to me that
[1:09:37] there was a layoff
[1:09:39] his name was vaughn height and i'm
[1:09:41] looking at the back of his head as he's
[1:09:43] sitting at this desk and in the dream i
[1:09:44] know it's a layoff
[1:09:45] but in my mind i'm saying man varna get
[1:09:47] ready to get laid off
[1:09:50] so i came to work the next morning he
[1:09:52] stepped out of the office and he looked
[1:09:53] me up he looked me right in my eyes
[1:09:55] he came walking toward me when he came
[1:09:57] walking toward me it clicked
[1:10:00] and all i could do things would smile i
[1:10:03] was getting laid off
[1:10:06] i got a family new car
[1:10:09] just bought a house i'm like
[1:10:12] late oh what is this i got bills to pay

[1:10:25] black interior stick shift leather
[1:10:29] the lord let all kind of stuff happen
[1:10:32] see i didn't know him
[1:10:34] but that was his way of beginning to
[1:10:36] deal with me and work with me
[1:10:38] so that i could begin to look at things
[1:10:40] in a different light
[1:10:43] now let come whatever's going to come it
[1:10:46] don't matter
[1:10:47] i don't know why because i've seen my
[1:10:49] god in action
[1:10:50] i've seen him provide amen
[1:10:54] i had time since well i didn't have no
[1:10:56] money
[1:10:57] and i needed a certain amount of money
[1:10:59] as a matter of fact when i bought that
[1:11:00] car
[1:11:02] i had eight hundred dollars property
[1:11:03] taxes that i know was gonna be attached
[1:11:05] to it
[1:11:06] i didn't have that money i'm like man
[1:11:08] where i'm gonna get this money from
[1:11:10] you know what the lord did i came from
[1:11:13] california that's why i was stationed at
[1:11:14] last
[1:11:15] i had a bank account over there in a
[1:11:17] bank called marine corps west
[1:11:19] my direct deposit never hit that bank i
[1:11:21] only use that bank to put a little money
[1:11:23] in that
[1:11:24] the cash checks from or the right checks
[1:11:25] from
[1:11:27] i get a bank statement in the mail from
[1:11:29] marine corps west from california
[1:11:31] at the very time i needed it you know
[1:11:33] what they said on that bank statement
[1:11:35] it said i had 800 in that account
[1:11:41] i wasn't working with much money back
[1:11:43] then so i know i know
[1:11:45] full well i didn't forget about eight
[1:11:46] hundred dollars
[1:11:49] so i got scared i said i ain't spending
[1:11:52] this money
[1:11:53] i know i ain't had that money now the
[1:11:54] council i'm gonna call the bank and let
[1:11:56] them know what happened i called the
[1:11:57] bank
[1:11:58] let the bank know what happened they
[1:12:00] searched it out called me back said miss
[1:12:01] mcbride we don't know what happened but
[1:12:03] that's your money
[1:12:04] i said well praise the lord was god
[1:12:08] doing since he was given experiences
[1:12:12] in each one of our lives we got many
[1:12:14] testimonies along that lines
[1:12:16] where god has come he's been revealing
[1:12:18] himself to you amen
[1:12:20] and you now stand in a better place than
[1:12:22] you did at the beginning you ain't the
[1:12:24] same person no more
[1:12:28] now listen i believe you're more
[1:12:30] equipped to meet the challenges
[1:12:32] than what you think you are
[1:12:40] we tend to lack a lot of confidence in
[1:12:42] that area but god knows what's in us
[1:12:47] i'm talking about the challenge of love
[1:12:49] i'm talking about god
[1:12:50] permitting troublesome
[1:12:54] hard situations allowing his children to
[1:12:58] meet them
[1:12:58] face on but by his grace and wisdom
[1:13:02] waiting until you were at a place to
[1:13:05] where you can actually
[1:13:06] handle them
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:12] seeing his wisdom he reigns from ohio he
[1:13:14] knows exactly what's he what he's doing
[1:13:18] praise the lord that's what they done to
[1:13:21] him they killed him and he died
[1:13:23] he says that he might save them that's
[1:13:26] eternal life when that's in your
[1:13:28] when that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:13:30] heaven then
[1:13:31] but you sacrifice your own things give
[1:13:33] them love
[1:13:34] like the sheep gives its wool you look
[1:13:36] on towards calvary
[1:13:39] praise the lord
[1:13:44] so the closer we get down to the end
[1:13:47] because we're in a rapturing time right
[1:13:48] now
[1:13:50] the closer we get down to the end
[1:13:53] amen we haven't seen nothing yet
[1:13:57] so we're all still able to gather here
[1:13:59] in this building
[1:14:01] amen have a little service have not nice
[1:14:05] little service going on or whatever all
[1:14:07] over the world the bride is gathering
[1:14:08] here and there
[1:14:09] but the time is coming soon when that's
[1:14:11] going to be stopped
[1:14:14] there are many things working right now
[1:14:16] much of which i'm sure god has made you
[1:14:18] aware of through various ministries
[1:14:20] that he's brought through and is
[1:14:22] bringing his word through whatever amen
[1:14:24] posting his bride as to where things are
[1:14:27] right now
[1:14:30] amen but our prophet had an experience
[1:14:36] where he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:39] and when he went beyond that curtain of
[1:14:40] time
[1:14:41] it was something that was told them it
[1:14:44] says nothing
[1:14:45] can make it here without perfect love
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:52] so now that's more than just a feeling
[1:14:54] we're not talking about a feeling per se
[1:14:57] it brings a feeling but it's more than a
[1:14:59] feeling
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:06] as the lord help us to understand in
[1:15:07] these last days since there's two
[1:15:09] different kinds of love right
[1:15:11] there's a familiar love and there's an
[1:15:13] agape love
[1:15:16] many times brother branham says we're
[1:15:18] deceived
[1:15:20] into thinking that we have a gospel love
[1:15:23] when it's actually filial love
[1:15:27] now there is a difference that he
[1:15:30] actually talked about
[1:15:32] praise the lord there is a distinct
[1:15:34] difference
[1:15:35] that he spoke about concerning this
[1:15:39] he says love should be governed should
[1:15:41] govern a home love is the greatest force
[1:15:44] that was ever put into the power of a
[1:15:45] man he says the home should be
[1:15:48] disciplined by love
[1:15:49] he says if the husband and the wife
[1:15:51] doesn't solemnly love each other
[1:15:53] they cannot trust each other that's why
[1:15:55] i think that instead of resting our
[1:15:57] faith upon some emotion
[1:15:59] he says which is all right or a gift
[1:16:01] which is all right like shouting
[1:16:02] speaking with tongues or
[1:16:04] with other things that we take for
[1:16:05] saying that that we have the holy spirit
[1:16:08] when we when we do the when we do this
[1:16:10] he says those things are all right
[1:16:12] but if we would come back to the
[1:16:13] principle love first
[1:16:15] and then those things i think our church
[1:16:18] will progress
[1:16:19] a lot faster if we would get god first
[1:16:22] and god is love
[1:16:23] he says now love is in two different
[1:16:25] words two different meanings in the
[1:16:27] greek one of them
[1:16:28] is called filio that's the lord that you
[1:16:31] have for your wife
[1:16:32] a golfer is a love divine love now the
[1:16:35] love you have for your wife
[1:16:37] and the love of god is so contrary
[1:16:42] with filial love you wouldn't be able to
[1:16:44] take persecution
[1:16:51] amen it's able brother barum said that
[1:16:54] that feeling of love
[1:16:56] is able to be accompanied by devils
[1:17:01] with feel your lord if a man would
[1:17:03] insult your wife he said
[1:17:05] you would you would desire to kill that
[1:17:08] man
[1:17:11] but with a god for love that same man
[1:17:15] it'll lead you to pray for his sinful
[1:17:17] soul
[1:17:20] so now two different things
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] the things i've come in contact with
[1:17:28] saints
[1:17:29] convinced that what this prophet said
[1:17:31] here is exactly right
[1:17:34] people that proclaim to have godly love
[1:17:37] when you see how they handle other
[1:17:38] people and how people respond to things
[1:17:42] it shows you something is wrong
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:52] if we've been guilty of gossiping
[1:18:02] if we've been guilty of gossiping
[1:18:06] if we've been guilty of saying things
[1:18:09] that would hurt
[1:18:10] another brother or sister's character
[1:18:16] they don't have to be bribed this is not
[1:18:19] a thing where where i know if they're
[1:18:21] blind see they deserve a certain
[1:18:23] treatment
[1:18:24] know what the bible says that god is
[1:18:26] good to the unthankful
[1:18:28] and to the evil the rain falls upon the
[1:18:32] just and the unjust
[1:18:36] he doesn't hold it back because it's a
[1:18:38] cocker barrel
[1:18:40] or a thorn bush he lets that same ring
[1:18:43] come down
[1:18:44] and bless their lives give them life
[1:18:51] but regardless of how much he allows his
[1:18:53] spirit to come down upon them
[1:18:55] their end is still going to be a bitter
[1:18:57] ink
[1:19:01] but as we're walking through this life
[1:19:03] regardless of how sticky somebody may
[1:19:05] seem to us amen
[1:19:09] we're supposed to treat them like we
[1:19:12] would
[1:19:13] somebody we did it all
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:20] i'm talking about something that's
[1:19:22] beyond the flesh
[1:19:24] beyond the beyond willpower listen
[1:19:26] beyond learned behavior
[1:19:32] well even your listen not just
[1:19:34] refraining in your
[1:19:36] body well i'm not going to say that with
[1:19:38] my mouth but in your mind you're saying
[1:19:39] everything
[1:19:44] what we're talking about says is
[1:19:45] something that's real this is the very
[1:19:48] thing that god came down amen
[1:19:50] to die for
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:53] we can't satisfy god's will with a
[1:19:56] feeling your love
[1:19:57] in a cultural frame of mind
[1:20:00] you can't do it it won't allow you to do
[1:20:02] it when you're talking about you'll find
[1:20:05] yourself
[1:20:06] talking back again however somebody help
[1:20:10] if somebody insurance you
[1:20:11] don't shake your hand you next time you
[1:20:13] see them you're out like you'll vote
[1:20:14] you'll go somewhere
[1:20:15] like you see something else somewhere
[1:20:17] avoid go around
[1:20:20] amen and god is watching you
[1:20:25] remember your thoughts are heard louder
[1:20:27] in heaven and your words are in the
[1:20:29] earth
[1:20:30] it ain't enough to sit to look the part
[1:20:33] and play the part
[1:20:34] you got to be it
[1:20:41] now what i found
[1:20:44] well the love of god is not present
[1:20:48] individuals are able to lock into a
[1:20:52] carnal frame of mind
[1:20:55] and they can't be shaken from it
[1:20:58] hardened hard heart they could
[1:21:02] can seem to be the nicest person just
[1:21:04] like brother brandon talked about that i
[1:21:06] think he took that pentecostal cannot
[1:21:07] believe he said
[1:21:08] as long as you're rubbing it in a
[1:21:10] certain direction it's all purring and
[1:21:11] everything you know how a cat do
[1:21:13] when you're when you're rubbing his back
[1:21:14] rolling with you and everything you know
[1:21:16] he said but you rub it the wrong
[1:21:18] direction
[1:21:20] and that's how some people are
[1:21:25] now i want to stop for a moment here and
[1:21:27] i want to say this
[1:21:29] that's okay if that's
[1:21:32] that's a person person's current state
[1:21:34] of being
[1:21:36] is actually okay because all god is
[1:21:38] doing is helping them to see who they
[1:21:40] are now if their bride
[1:21:42] when he shows them who they are it'll be
[1:21:45] a pricking in the heart
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:49] it'll hurt them they're like lord have
[1:21:52] mercy on me what am i doing
[1:21:54] see when you're under the anointing of
[1:21:55] an evil spirit you don't think like that
[1:21:58] we're just reacting under a wrong
[1:22:01] mindset
[1:22:06] but the bible says when christ was
[1:22:07] reviled he didn't revile again
[1:22:11] listen science when he was being
[1:22:13] crucified
[1:22:16] he didn't have to try to say well i got
[1:22:18] a lot of people looking at me right now
[1:22:20] i know i know the bible is going to be
[1:22:21] written so let me make sure i say the
[1:22:23] right thing
[1:22:24] so people can hear me have a right
[1:22:26] response no sir
[1:22:29] when the nails with his hand it was
[1:22:32] killing him to breathe
[1:22:35] he said father listen
[1:22:44] for they know not what they do
[1:22:48] and that same power wasn't
[1:22:51] stephen amen
[1:22:55] when he was being killed stoned with
[1:22:57] stones
[1:22:58] that power of love the love of god
[1:23:02] whole saving that man the bible said he
[1:23:04] was full of the holy ghost
[1:23:08] and the bible says that the love of god
[1:23:10] is shattered brought in our hearts
[1:23:12] by the holy ghost and being filled with
[1:23:15] the holy ghost
[1:23:16] as he was being hit across the head and
[1:23:19] his skulls being
[1:23:20] fractured
[1:23:24] the very one is killing him
[1:23:27] it just flow come on somebody
[1:23:33] he says forgive them
[1:23:36] and our prophet in the spirit picks it
[1:23:38] up it says that god was doing that amen
[1:23:42] as a witness for what but there was a
[1:23:45] young apostle sitting right now
[1:23:48] blinded by seeing a witness
[1:23:52] brother brandon said when he came out of
[1:23:54] that experience he wasn't able to shake
[1:23:56] away from that too easy
[1:23:58] he said paul staggered like a drug man
[1:24:02] because he's seen such a life such a
[1:24:04] display
[1:24:06] he wasn't able to take away from that
[1:24:11] stephen was living his life for others
[1:24:15] that was eternal life on display
[1:24:19] and my question to you tonight is what
[1:24:21] does your life display
[1:24:25] it's a serious question
[1:24:29] this ain't something where you got to
[1:24:30] try to you know you know how it is you
[1:24:32] know
[1:24:34] you ask certain questions or whatever
[1:24:36] and everybody know what the right answer
[1:24:37] is supposed to be and they don't want to
[1:24:39] be seen as not having that right answer
[1:24:41] so everybody raise their hand and agree
[1:24:43] and whatever but i'm talking about where
[1:24:45] you really are
[1:24:47] see we're going down to where the rubber
[1:24:49] really meets the road now
[1:24:52] the rapture is an individual affair you
[1:24:55] can't fake it you can't put yourself
[1:24:57] into it you can't take yourself out of
[1:24:59] it
[1:25:00] if you're ordained for it it's going to
[1:25:01] happen anyhow
[1:25:03] so i want to encourage you tonight also
[1:25:06] no matter how you see
[1:25:07] no matter where you are right now you
[1:25:09] might say brother i don't mess up so
[1:25:10] much
[1:25:13] brother i i i i know my conduct ain't
[1:25:16] been good
[1:25:18] i'm guilty of this that and the other
[1:25:22] encouraged he says his word has gone out
[1:25:26] and it shall not come back to him void
[1:25:29] he said but it's going to accomplish
[1:25:32] it's going to accomplish what he's
[1:25:33] sending out to accomplish
[1:25:35] and it's going to prosper in the thing
[1:25:37] where until he sent it
[1:25:41] that's why you got to only believe amen
[1:25:44] so as i'm ministering tonight
[1:25:46] even if the word is touching upon your
[1:25:48] life in a certain way be encouraged
[1:25:51] and have faith in god
[1:25:57] amen by nature having the right response
[1:26:01] listen it's simply listen
[1:26:05] he says the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:10] is god in you living his own life
[1:26:14] through you
[1:26:17] so i don't i don't have a reason to
[1:26:18] doubt that we all in here have the holy
[1:26:20] ghost
[1:26:22] i don't have a reason to doubt that why
[1:26:24] would i want to think anything any
[1:26:26] different
[1:26:28] why would you want to go around and try
[1:26:30] to determine who's circumcised and who's
[1:26:32] not
[1:26:34] if your mind is in that place pull it
[1:26:36] back out
[1:26:38] pull it back into the middle of the road
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:42] the bible says god is not willing that
[1:26:44] any man should perish
[1:26:47] but that all might come what to
[1:26:50] repentance
[1:26:52] so that life is on the inside of us
[1:26:56] who do we want to see fail or not make
[1:26:58] it
[1:27:00] who is it that we want to point our
[1:27:01] fingers at and say i told you so
[1:27:04] no sir god is displeased
[1:27:07] with that kind of a behavior
[1:27:12] that's not the behavior of raw
[1:27:18] it's bigger than that
[1:27:24] amen praise god it's bigger than that
[1:27:30] saints
[1:27:33] and he displayed it when he came down
[1:27:36] and he
[1:27:36] showed it to us amen even in our prophet
[1:27:41] god working with him in his life he had
[1:27:43] many things he had to encounter
[1:27:45] remember the one in particular where he
[1:27:47] was being hardly pressed by the
[1:27:49] attorneys
[1:27:52] and by the government in certain
[1:27:54] situations
[1:27:56] and i believe it was dr level the one of
[1:27:58] the brothers that were around him
[1:28:00] and they were all together and all of a
[1:28:03] sudden he got a call
[1:28:05] from somebody that was really pressing
[1:28:07] him i believe it was the government at
[1:28:08] that time
[1:28:09] concerning his taxes i believe it was
[1:28:12] and he's being pressed and he's under
[1:28:14] all this pressure and the devil trying
[1:28:16] to really get a hold of him
[1:28:17] trying to disturb his atmosphere
[1:28:21] pull him out of that place where god
[1:28:23] would be welcome how many realize that
[1:28:25] listen every day of our lives that's an
[1:28:28] atmosphere that we can create
[1:28:32] and you got to be very careful with that
[1:28:35] remember
[1:28:36] the holy ghost is timid
[1:28:41] you get to snarling like a wolf he said
[1:28:42] he'll take his flight
[1:28:44] he said but don't worry he's not far off
[1:28:46] he's right there
[1:28:47] waiting for you to become a lamb again
[1:28:52] so our prophet is in there and he gets a
[1:28:54] call of concerning these taxes again
[1:28:56] and one of the other brothers was a
[1:28:57] little hot-tempered look at hot-headed
[1:29:01] ready to give somebody a piece of his
[1:29:03] mind
[1:29:05] and when he saw it brother branham had
[1:29:07] received that call he began to react
[1:29:11] now brother brown i'm in his life god
[1:29:13] was grooming him
[1:29:15] amen bringing him amen he was growing in
[1:29:18] the things of god amen
[1:29:19] he was maturing amen growing up into
[1:29:23] that place
[1:29:24] amen the way he can more reflect the
[1:29:27] life of god
[1:29:29] even though he was the one under
[1:29:31] depression and the brothers response was
[1:29:33] real
[1:29:33] sharp and strong
[1:29:37] under that anointing of the holy ghost
[1:29:40] he said let him alone
[1:29:42] maybe the lord told me
[1:29:45] and when he said that saints
[1:29:47] supernaturally god
[1:29:49] came in and gave him a further
[1:29:51] instructions
[1:29:52] as to where to go
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:57] what wrote that about his response
[1:30:01] to a phone call
[1:30:06] would you even have thought that god
[1:30:07] would have allowed that to be the thing
[1:30:09] that that determined
[1:30:11] among him receiving further instruction
[1:30:15] advancing in his ministry to fulfill
[1:30:17] more of the will of god
[1:30:18] a phone call and his response to that
[1:30:28] you might be at work tomorrow you don't
[1:30:30] know it could be any
[1:30:31] natural occurring situation and god
[1:30:34] allowed that thing to be specially
[1:30:36] designed
[1:30:37] for your advancement when he was having
[1:30:41] a service and god told him to be careful
[1:30:43] what he said
[1:30:45] isn't that right there's a trap the
[1:30:47] devil has set for you
[1:30:49] here come the young couple in there at
[1:30:51] an armory in the service
[1:30:53] hey man whatever you say
[1:30:56] that'll be what it is you say pack them
[1:30:59] out
[1:31:00] they'll pack them out you say blindness
[1:31:03] that's what it'll be
[1:31:05] amen but that brother had come up to
[1:31:08] such a place
[1:31:09] he didn't have no confidence in himself
[1:31:12] hey he wasn't being too quick with it
[1:31:15] but he
[1:31:16] said unknowing lord i don't know what
[1:31:18] that's exactly what had it right did
[1:31:22] hey maya she knew what to ask for
[1:31:25] she was just viewed as searching for the
[1:31:27] will of god that's all she wanted
[1:31:30] and then out of her mouth under those
[1:31:32] words which is right in line with the
[1:31:34] mind of god she called the spirit
[1:31:36] spoke god's will and we see the results
[1:31:40] not as prophetic standing there asking
[1:31:43] them to stop please
[1:31:45] this is a service please don't do that
[1:31:48] the devil pokemon it's the trap be
[1:31:51] careful what you say
[1:31:55] whatever you say that's what happened
[1:31:57] came to him again
[1:31:59] now he's standing there yielded
[1:32:02] not warning his own way died to himself
[1:32:06] he said the next thing you know i heard
[1:32:08] my mouth say
[1:32:10] i forgive
[1:32:23] you're not supposed to be in control
[1:32:27] amen that's what the third pool is all
[1:32:30] about
[1:32:32] it's not you in control it's not you
[1:32:34] saying whatever you want
[1:32:36] if you saying whatever you want guess
[1:32:38] what it'll just be mere words going out
[1:32:41] nothing will materialize
[1:32:46] but when the anointing of god when amen
[1:32:48] when you've humbled yourself
[1:32:50] and that anointing of god is resting
[1:32:52] upon you
[1:33:07] and you've yielded yourself so
[1:33:08] completely until that's all you want is
[1:33:11] his will
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] can we say praise the lord says amen
[1:33:20] i'm talking about the challenge of love
[1:33:23] well you don't respond like the devil
[1:33:25] wants you to respond
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:29] when you're being cursed you turn around
[1:33:31] and bless naturally
[1:33:37] like when you have a chance to place a
[1:33:39] black ball upon somebody's name
[1:33:41] you take advantage of it no sir
[1:33:44] it's not you living no more now that's a
[1:33:47] power it's the power of love himself the
[1:33:50] person with the love of god
[1:33:51] expressing himself through you now you
[1:33:54] ain't yourself no more
[1:33:56] now is christ on display perfect
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:00] amen the beater of the gold has beat the
[1:34:03] goal and beaten the goal but the brandon
[1:34:05] said through trial after trial
[1:34:07] test at the test trial like a trial
[1:34:10] to bring his reflection into it
[1:34:15] you might say in your life right now
[1:34:16] brother i got it too hard right now too
[1:34:18] many things hit me left and right
[1:34:20] you don't know what's going on brother
[1:34:22] let me ride it it's easy to preach that
[1:34:24] brother but you ain't living my life
[1:34:27] those are excuses
[1:34:31] because the living god that we serve is
[1:34:32] able to do all things
[1:34:35] but you have to have a mind to want his
[1:34:37] will
[1:34:39] see that's why he has those things set
[1:34:40] up in our lives things to break us down
[1:34:42] break us down break us down break us
[1:34:44] down break us down
[1:34:46] till we get to that point and say you
[1:34:48] may have a desire
[1:34:50] amen christ was at gethsemane
[1:34:53] if it be thy will let this cup pass from
[1:34:55] me
[1:34:56] but nevertheless let thy will be done
[1:34:59] and not mine
[1:35:01] isn't that right that's the place that
[1:35:04] god is
[1:35:05] pressing his bride into that climax
[1:35:08] amen amen that capstone praise the lord
[1:35:12] well he has full preeminence
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] and he's able to he he's able to express
[1:35:19] themselves so clearly
[1:35:23] that's why they actually thought brother
[1:35:25] branham was jesus christ
[1:35:29] amen that brother's life was so
[1:35:32] surrendered
[1:35:33] and christ so listen brother branham
[1:35:36] said because
[1:35:37] christ knew who he was the word flowed
[1:35:40] through him
[1:35:44] when we realize who we are
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] amen and allow ourselves to be humbled
[1:35:51] by god
[1:35:52] amen then we'll have that same testimony
[1:35:56] where the word of god will be able to
[1:35:58] come down listen no matter where you are
[1:36:02] no matter what situation you find
[1:36:04] yourself in
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] you will come into such a place with god
[1:36:08] where god can actually
[1:36:10] flow through you
[1:36:16] that final witness and final voice
[1:36:20] to this final age
[1:36:24] we are that people do you believe that
[1:36:28] america greater received it is in you
[1:36:31] and he that is in the world
[1:36:33] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:36:36] spirit of god will
[1:36:37] his saints and raise a standard empower
[1:36:40] his people
[1:36:43] to be able to rise above the tactics of
[1:36:46] the enemy and be able to overcome
[1:36:48] and step out victoriously the word of
[1:36:50] god
[1:36:54] how many believe you're the word of god
[1:36:56] how do you believe you're the word of
[1:36:58] god sayings
[1:36:59] amen you got to believe that trust god
[1:37:02] for your outcome
[1:37:03] it no matter where you are right now god
[1:37:06] is able
[1:37:07] amen amen
[1:37:17] i'ma stop right there let us all stand
[1:37:22] amen i believe you understand
[1:37:26] this ain't nothing you ain't already
[1:37:28] heard already it's just what was
[1:37:30] impressed upon my heart
[1:37:32] it's a challenge of love for you to love
[1:37:35] those that hate you
[1:37:37] too good to actually do good to those
[1:37:39] that do wrong to you
[1:37:41] pray for those from your heart that
[1:37:44] despitefully use you
[1:37:46] and persecute you
[1:37:53] the world can't they can't deal with
[1:37:54] this kind of a challenge here
[1:37:57] amen amen but god
[1:38:00] said it like that saints because he knew
[1:38:02] he was going to bring enemies into your

[1:38:04] people that didn't like you people that
[1:38:07] turn on you
[1:38:09] all kinds of things going on but he's
[1:38:11] allowing every bit of it and he's
[1:38:13] sitting back and he's watching your

[1:38:21] praise god amen let us all bow heavenly
[1:38:24] father

[1:38:30] i believe lord in all of our hearts
[1:38:32] father we realize our great need for
[1:38:34] more of you
[1:38:37] the things that we've spoken about on
[1:38:38] tonight lord
[1:38:41] as we've said by your grace lord god is
[1:38:43] not humanly possible
[1:38:46] as our prophet lord god step into that
[1:38:49] cafe
[1:38:51] on that particular night during times of
[1:38:53] his service as lord you allowed him to
[1:38:55] step into that cafe
[1:38:58] lord and even though your spirit was
[1:39:01] anointing him at times
[1:39:03] at that particular time lord or wrong
[1:39:05] spirit came to a prophet
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:08] and as he looked out upon the group that
[1:39:10] was within the cafe of the police
[1:39:12] officer at the slot machine and
[1:39:14] the elderly lady sitting with the two
[1:39:16] young men he began to have a critical
[1:39:19] spirit
[1:39:21] and he began to look out and he began to
[1:39:23] condemn
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:25] he even he even spoke lord that that
[1:39:28] that why don't you wipe
[1:39:29] such off the earth so his little
[1:39:31] daughter wouldn't have to deal with it
[1:39:34] in that moment lord he forgot all about
[1:39:36] how precious life was he didn't have
[1:39:40] your mind at that particular time
[1:39:43] he was speaking by the mind of a devil
[1:39:47] causing him to look at your creation and
[1:39:49] even a daughter of god
[1:39:54] and the way you straighten your profit
[1:39:56] out
[1:39:57] you told him to step aside
[1:40:00] and as he stepped aside lord god the way
[1:40:03] you corrected him
[1:40:05] you begin to show him himself
[1:40:09] you begin to show him his own sins
[1:40:12] and how he needed forgiveness and how it
[1:40:15] was his sins that was causing the blood
[1:40:18] to fly
[1:40:21] as you was being here it was for him
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:24] and you showed him a picture of himself
[1:40:29] that was your way of correcting your
[1:40:30] prophet lord
[1:40:32] and as he saw his own sins was causing
[1:40:35] you that pain
[1:40:38] and then he saw you graciously reach
[1:40:40] down and
[1:40:41] put your own blood right across his
[1:40:48] heart
[1:40:50] it made him feel good he was so grateful
[1:40:52] he began to give you thanksgiving
[1:40:56] but then you stopped him in the middle
[1:40:58] of his praise
[1:41:01] and told him you feel good because
[1:41:06] but she wants to feel the same thing
[1:41:10] your mommy got a change son she ain't
[1:41:13] she's a daughter
[1:41:18] you just didn't realize that because
[1:41:19] your human vision is limited
[1:41:23] you were proud you could see visions but
[1:41:25] you couldn't see in her life at that
[1:41:26] time

[1:41:30] lesson

[1:51:26] love
[1:51:27] how many enjoy the service tonight
[1:51:30] praise the name of the lord
[1:51:36] i believe you can see how the holy
[1:51:38] spirit is orchestrating everything
[1:51:40] god is calling you to a high calling
[1:51:44] and that high calling there was
[1:51:45] something you need to tweak a little bit
[1:51:48] the challenge of love we spoke about how
[1:51:51] we've been hurt
[1:51:53] how we've been treated bad but there was
[1:51:55] one thing that
[1:51:57] caught my attention when he said when a
[1:51:59] challenge came
[1:52:00] or come to you you need to understand
[1:52:04] that it's the time appropriate for you
[1:52:07] to handle it
[1:52:09] in other words it's a language of god we
[1:52:12] usually want god to speak like in an
[1:52:14] audible voice
[1:52:15] like calling you abraham abraham god
[1:52:18] speak in many different ways
[1:52:21] so if a challenge is facing you it is a
[1:52:24] time
[1:52:25] appropriate that god deemed necessary
[1:52:29] and see you fully equipped
[1:52:32] to handle that challenge so don't back
[1:52:36] up
[1:52:37] don't get frustrated just relax
[1:52:40] and let the holy spirit take over the
[1:52:42] brother didn't even know
[1:52:44] what we preached here we went through
[1:52:47] many challenges hard one
[1:52:51] and i remember talking to brother robert
[1:52:53] he said brother stephen
[1:52:55] you're going to a challenge of the third
[1:52:57] pool
[1:52:58] just like he was given to brother
[1:53:00] branham to speak the word
[1:53:02] and he spoke about the same thing
[1:53:04] tonight not even knowing
[1:53:07] why why it didn't happen years ago
[1:53:10] why because you are maturing you
[1:53:13] underestimate yourself
[1:53:15] more than what god sees you god is
[1:53:19] seeing a bride
[1:53:20] with potential god is looking at a broad
[1:53:24] predestinated fully equipped he's
[1:53:27] bringing you to a high calling
[1:53:29] because there is something in you that
[1:53:32] is already prepared
[1:53:34] for the occasion for the time for you to
[1:53:37] handle business
[1:53:38] i don't know why last sunday i stopped
[1:53:41] not even touching the
[1:53:42] seal the signet of judah it was because
[1:53:45] of this sermon
[1:53:46] because the signet of judah gives you a
[1:53:49] power to seal
[1:53:50] something you have a right to enforce
[1:53:52] something and it's gonna happen
[1:53:55] and that power need to be handled by
[1:53:57] love
[1:53:58] because if you enforce death death is
[1:54:01] gonna happen to somebody
[1:54:02] if you enforce life life is gonna happen
[1:54:05] to somebody
[1:54:06] the power of that signal god wants me to
[1:54:10] stop where i have to stop
[1:54:11] open a door for a family member preacher
[1:54:16] to come and insert the love
[1:54:19] of the third pool so you understand
[1:54:22] forget about those things behind you
[1:54:25] get clannish but always keep that arm
[1:54:28] out
[1:54:29] that arm of love to meet the challenge
[1:54:32] and to pull whoever is redeemable
[1:54:34] according to the plan
[1:54:36] of god god richly bless you may he
[1:54:38] continue to bless us
[1:54:40] may he protects our families many things
[1:54:43] happening here and there
[1:54:44] god knows one of this day we're gonna
[1:54:47] see our loved one
[1:54:48] may the holy spirit strengthen you may
[1:54:50] he keep you on the road
[1:54:52] may the blood protect our family
[1:54:54] wherever they are
[1:54:55] our bride family may you protect the
[1:54:58] bride family
[1:54:59] continue to pray continue to consecrate
[1:55:02] yourself
[1:55:02] continue to release yourself continue to
[1:55:05] relax
[1:55:06] there is nothing you have to do in this
[1:55:09] thing
[1:55:10] you don't have to work on it there is no
[1:55:12] work
[1:55:13] you don't have to sweat you don't need
[1:55:15] your wool
[1:55:17] you just need to relax put on neutral
[1:55:20] and let god drive you through i was
[1:55:23] talking to a brother
[1:55:25] actually communicating with him on uh on
[1:55:27] a text
[1:55:28] i told him i said you know when you
[1:55:30] enter the car wash

[1:55:34] there
[1:55:35] you go to the gate first and you have to
[1:55:37] pay the price
[1:55:38] and when you enter you put neutral
[1:55:41] because the wash you're gonna have
[1:55:43] is gonna be according to the amount of
[1:55:46] money you paid
[1:55:47] and our price was paid in calvary it was
[1:55:51] a full price for redemption
[1:55:53] so don't even worry the car wash you're
