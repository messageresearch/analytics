Isn't it just good to serve the Lord this morning? Amen. Maybe before we open the word, we could just bow our hearts for a word of prayer. Amen. Let's just approach him this morning. And maybe you have a special need upon your heart, something that you uh would desire from the Lord and from his word this morning. I know if you have a need, he has the answer this morning. So, let's just approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers have gathered here on this resurrection Sunday morning. Father, we've not gathered here out of tradition. Lord, we've not gathered here out of form or fashion. But Lord, we've gathered here this morning out of a call, a deep calling to the deep. And Lord, your prophet told us that before there was a deep calling to the deep, there had to be a deep to respond. And Lord, before we woke up this morning with that something in our hearts, Lord, hungering and desiring to be in your house. And Lord, to be gathered with believers of like precious faith and Lord, that little something inside of us, oh God, that was desiring for more of you. Lord, we're so thankful to know that there was already more of you for us to have. And Father, as we come here this morning, your prophet has taught us, Lord, that we'll either leave better or we'll leave worse. And Lord, we know this morning that we can leave better because your word is here. And Lord, I pray that you would come among us this morning in a special way. Father, if there would be one bound among us, you said you sent your word. And Lord, your word healed, your word delivered, oh God. And Lord, as your word goes forth this morning, may it bring deliverance to every captive, Lord. May it bring freedom to those who would be bound, oh God. Lord, for those who would be sick, I pray the power of healing, oh God. Lord, by the preaching of your word would flow through their bodies this morning. Father, if there be one at home today, Lord, unable to be here. Maybe one in the hospital laying there in a sick bed that'll hear this service, Lord. Father, may the angel of God passed by that hospital room. And Lord, may you raise them up, oh God. If there be one that's grown cold upon you, Father, and Lord, maybe just somewhere by accident, they would stumble across this sermon, Lord, at this service, I pray a cola of fire, oh God, would come up off the altar of your word, Lord, and it would melt the ice, oh Lord God, off of their hearts, Lord. It would bring that zeal and that passion, Lord, to serve you and bring them back in the house of God before the hour be too late. Lord, we pray you forgive us this morning of our failures. Forgive us of our shortcomings. Lord, may you move me aside, Father. Lord, may you not just be a spectator, but may you take an active part in this service this morning. Lord, may you bring, Lord, revelation to every heart that Lord, when we would leave this place, we would be able to say, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" Not as brother Andrew talked to us along the way, but as you come, oh, the son of man come and spoke to the hearts of your children. Now, Father, we commit this meeting today in thy faithful hands. have your way among us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, we want to go to the book of Luke, the book of Luke, the 19th chapter. I want to turn to Luke chapter 19. And then also, we're going to look in 1 Peter chapter 2. Uh Luke chapter 19. You love the Lord this morning. And in the 41st verse of Luke the 19th chapter, and when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it. Now notice what he said. If thou hadest known, even thou at least this thy day. Now I want you to notice that when he says, if thou had known, he's speaking of the spiritual ignorance. If thou hadest known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace. Now I want you to catch here. What he's saying is the things which make for peace. In other words, your peace depends on these things. But now they are hid from your eyes. For the day shall come upon thee, that thine enemy shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee. And they shall not leave in thee one stone upon one another. Now, that's a very dark scene. &gt;&gt; And it's all because thou kneest not the time of thy visitation. Thou kneeest not the time of thy visitation. In the book of first Peter, 1 Peter chapter 2. I want to look there in 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number 12. 1 Peter 2 and verse 12. Peter here writing, he says, "Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may your they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation." glorify God in the day of visitation. So, one generation didn't know their day of visitation, but here's another generation that's going to glorify God in the day of thy visitation. We ask Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word. As you can have your seats here today, uh if the Lord would help me this morning from those passages of scripture today, if I would if I would take a text here to speak to you for a few moments this morning, I want to talk to you on this. Recognizing your day of visitation. recognizing your day of visitation. In the sermon, the uncertain sound, brother Ram's praying and he says, "Heavenly Father," he says, "I pray the prayer for them all with all my heart. I give them to you." He says, "They are trophies of the message." Amen. I love that. They are trophies of the message. He says, "They are trophies of your visitation." They are trophies of your visitation. Being here tonight, seeing you walk among us, Amen. doing the works that has never been done since the foundation of the world until these days. He says, "Here they are." Excuse me. He says, "Here they are. They're your children. I commend them to you, Lord. You give them to us and we give them to you. Now, in the name of Jesus Christ, watch over them and raise them up at the last day." He says, "I may never be able to shake their hands on this earth, but when the battle is over," how many believes that's coming and the last trumpet has sounded and the dead has risen from the grave. He says, "And the live has been called up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. Then may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ and them around the throne and through the eternal ages it is to come." He says, "Grant it, Lord. They are yours in the name of Jesus Christ. Now I love that because the prophet is saying that there has been amen visitation of God in this generation and that visitation has not gone unnoticed by everybody. There has been a lot missing. There has been a lot not acknowledge it. But there will be some amen who will acknowledge it and will recognize what God is doing in the hour they're living. In 1960, brother Ram says, "We've had healings and speaking with tongues and miracles and so forth." He says, "But that visit is what we are looking for tonight." So, amen. We're not looking for healings or the speaking of tongues or the miracles so much. Amen. But it's that visit that we are looking for. Again, is your life worthy of the gospel? When God is making a visit to the church and to the people, receive it then. Amen. When God is making a visit to the church and to the people, receive it then. Don't put it off until next year. Amen. Or the next revival. Receive it right then. Now, amen. You realize that a visitation is a special, amen, dispensation of divine favor or wrath. Amen. Amen. A visitation will either bring the favor of God upon you. Amen. Or it will bring the wrath of God. Now in blind Barnameus brother says Christ is visiting amen the gentile church. Christ is visiting the gentile church. It's the evening lights that's a is shining now. Amen. The prophet said in the evening time it'll be light. Now he said this is the hour. This is the time. And if you'll just take that little some kind of little something that wants to make you kind of halfway believe it. Amen. Or halfway doubt it and brush that thing aside. Amen. And come now. Amen. It's Christ. Amen. Jesus Christ, the son of God. Amen. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, amen. You've got to realize that we're not, Amen. fully redeemed. Our souls have been redeemed. Amen. But we're still got that old sticky nature, right? We still got that old carnal flesh nature. Amen. That wants to make us halfway believe and wants to make us halfway doubt. Amen. But you will never receive the benefit of the visitation of God halfway believing. Amen. AND HALFWAY DOUBTING. AMEN. AMEN. YOU'VE EITHER GOT TO FULLY BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AND FULLY DOUBT THE DEVIL. AMEN. OR YOU'RE FULLY BELIEVING the devil AND FULLY DOUBTING THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AMEN. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN. We're either believers. Amen. Or we're unbelievers. I SAY THIS MORNING, IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A TIME, AMEN, TO FOLD THE THING ASIDE, AMEN, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU DOUBT THE VISITATION OF GOD, AMEN, now is the time to do it. He said, it's been proven God is visiting the people today. &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION. It's already been proven that God is visiting the people today. HE SAID GOD IS IN HIS CHURCH. AMEN. And he's trying to purge the thing. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE OUT the leaven out of it. HE'S SENDING MESSENGERS AND SIGNS and wonders and miracles, everything trying to prove, amen, that he loves them and he wants them to clean up. Now, amen. When you begin to study in the Bible, you will find, amen, that the Bible specifically speaks of visitation. In the book of Job, the 10th chapter, the 12th verse, amen, Job says, "Thou hast granted me life and favor." AMEN. AND THY visitation has preserved my spirit. Amen. In Psalms 102:13, David said, "Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion." Now, who is Zion? Amen. Zion is a type of the bride. Amen. Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion. Listen. For the time to favor her. [laughter] Amen. Amen. The time to favor her. Amen. Yay. The set time is come. Amen. This is not an accident. AMEN. YOU DID NOT stumble into the favor OF GOD. YOU DID NOT BUMP INTO THE FAVOR OF GOD. AMEN. BUT IF GOD HAS FAVORED your life, AMEN. THERE WAS A TIME THAT HE SET FROM BEFORE the foundation of the world that HE WOULD FAVOR YOU AND YOU'RE LIVING in that time. Brother said, "May the power reach down and may it pick up the people and may it shake them, Lord, and let them realize that this is the day of their visitation." Listen, this is the time, amen, that the Lord HAS SET. AMEN. I LOVE THAT. THIS IS NOT A MAN'S SCHEDULE. AMEN. AMEN. THIS IS NOT A MAN'S TIME, AMEN. This is not a church's time. Amen. BUT THIS IS GOD'S TIME. AMEN. GOD SET THIS TIME. AMEN. GOD ARRANGED THIS TIME THAT GOD WOULD COME UNTO THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS. AMEN. I think it's powerful. Amen. That every generation is going to receive a visitation. &gt;&gt; Now, you realize what that visitation is. Amen. IT'S WHEN THE PROMISES of that age, amen, begin to come to pass. Brotherson, I thank thee tonight. Amen. for the Holy Ghost and for the visitation of him right here IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT here even right here now. The very spirit according to the word of God WHICH IS INFALLIBLE AND CANNOT FAIL. LISTEN, the same spirit, somebody say the same spirit. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in our midst now. Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. THAT'S NOT A REFORMER. AMEN. THAT'S NOT A PREACHER. THAT'S A VINDICATED PROPHET MAKING A declaration over the CHURCH THAT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING THIS MORNING. OR I SAY, WHAT DEVIL CAN HOLD YOU? I SAY, WHAT SPIRIT CAN BIND YOU? I SAY, WHAT CHAIN OF UNBELIEF, AMEN, CAN LIMIT YOUR FAITH IN THE HOUSE OF GOD? LISTEN, THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED OUR LORD FROM THE DEAD is right here in this building this morning confirming his word. Amen. If there's ever been A TIME, AMEN. NOW'S THE TIME TO BELIEVE, AMEN, to realize the seriousness. TO REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE VISITATION of God. Amen. I tell you what a prophet said. HE SAID, "MAY MEN AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS of this visitation of God." AMEN. THE GOSPEL is being preached like it was in the days of Noah. AMEN. IT'S FANATICISM TO THE WORLD, but it's glorious and it's welcome to those who are willing to come in. He said, "NOW WE COME INTO THE ARK OF SAFETY, AND THE ark of safety is Christ." AMEN. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS. AMEN. THAT ZION IS A TYPE of the bride, right? Amen. Then I can say unto you, amen, that your time of favor is NOT COMING. AMEN. YOUR TIME OF FAVOR HAS NOT BEEN HERE. AMEN. BUT YOUR TIME of favor IS NOW. AMEN. NOW IS THE TIME OF DIVINE FAVOR FOR THE SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD. COME ON. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF CATHOLICS. AMEN. Putting this IN THE FUTURE. AMEN. MY BIBLE SAYS NOW WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORD NOW MEANS? THAT WORD NOW MEANS AT THIS TIME. AMEN. AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT. AMEN. LISTEN. NOT FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW. NOT 30 MINUTES FROM NOW. NOT WHEN THE ALTAR IS OPEN. AMEN. NOT WHEN ANOTHER PREACHER SHOWS UP. BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE THE SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD. LISTEN THEN. IF YOU ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, THAT EVERY PROMISE THAT IS LAID IN THE LAND OF INHERITANCE, AMEN, BELONGS UNTO THE SEED OF ALMIGHTY GOD. LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU, NOW IS THE HOUR. AMEN. NOW IS THE TIME. AMEN. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED HOUR. LISTEN, THIS IS NOW THE ACCEPTABLE year of the Lord. HE SAID, NOW IS WHEN HEALING IS SUPPOSED TO BE. NOW IS WHEN MIRACLES TAKE PLACE. NOW, ARE YOU HEARING ME? NOW IS WHEN CHRIST IS REVEALING HIMSELF. AMEN. NOT TOMORROW, NOT NEXT WEEK. AMEN. BUT RIGHT NOW, THE SON OF MAN IS ALIVE [screaming] AND WELL IN THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION, REVEALING HIMSELF, CONFIRMING HIS WORD. These things are not in the future. He said, "Here we are." Now, &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "REVELATION'S COMING." NO REVELATION'S HERE. Come on. SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, THE PROPHET'S COMING." NO, THE MESSAGE IS HERE. AMEN. The things that we are seeing today, BROTHER SAID, COULD NOT HAPPEN 20 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful point. AMEN. IT COULD NOT HAPPEN 40 YEARS AGO. It's today. It happens. THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS THE TIME. He said, "NOW IT'S THE TIME. IT'S FULFILLED." AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE GOD PROMISED it &gt;&gt; and here it is. &gt;&gt; MY THEN TO THINK, AMEN, THAT THIS IS THE HOUR THAT A PROPHET. NOW YOU SAY, PREACHER, AMEN, you said these things COULDN'T BE DONE 20 YEARS AGO OR 40 YEARS AGO. YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. REMEMBER THE PROPHET OF GOD STOOD THERE AND HE PREACHED THE MESSAGE, THE INDICTMENT. REMEMBER THAT? AND HE SAID THERE THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. He said, "See, I couldn't preach this six months ago." He said, "But I CAN PREACH IT NOW." AMEN. WELL, I COULD LISTEN. THINGS HAVE GOT TO LINE UP, FOLKS. AMEN. THINGS HAVE GOT TO HAPPEN. AND WHEN THINGS HAPPEN, AMEN. IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENINGS, BUT THERE'S A MEANING BEHIND WHAT'S HAPPENING. COME ON. THERE'S A MEANING BEHIND WHAT'S HAPPENING. DO YOU KNOW WHY HE COULDN'T PREACH THAT 6 MONTHS AGO? BECAUSE the word had to &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU ALL KNOW WHEN JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED, AMEN. Today the movie writers, AMEN, THEY COVER HIM BUT IN REALITY HE WAS HANGING THERE IN PLAIN VIEW. HE WAS FULLY EXPOSED. AMEN. THERE WAS NOTHING HIDING HIM. HE WAS HANGING THERE. AMEN. DO YOU REALIZE WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "AMEN. THEY CRUCIFIED HIM." BECAUSE THE WORD WAS FULLY THERE. AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. HE SAID, "I COULDN'T PREACH THE INDICTMENT 6 MONTHS AGO, BUT I CAN PREACH IT NOW." YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THE WORD HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE PREACHING OF THE SEVEN SEALS AND THE WORD WAS IN FULL VIEW. OH CHURCH OF the living God, LET ME SAY IT AS PLAIN AS I KNOW HOW. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS BRIDE IS NOT AN ACCIDENT. SHE IS HERE. SHE HAS STEPPED FROM THE PAGES OF THE BIBLE. SHE IS FULFILLING THE word spoke of her IN THE HOUR THAT SHE'S LIVING IN. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I LOVE WHAT A PROPHET says at the end of his sermon, the token. He's praying and he SAYS, "NOW, NOW I WANT Y'ALL TO HEAR THIS, OKAY?" He's at the end of the token and he's praying AND HE SAYS, "IF THERE BE A SEED ANYWHERE, &gt;&gt; if there be a seed anywhere &gt;&gt; that's predestinated, &gt;&gt; HE SAYS,"LORD, TO HEAR THE word &gt;&gt; of this last day, &gt;&gt; may they COME NOW. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; MAY THEY COME NOW &gt;&gt; sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH HIM TURN A CORNER OR THEIR YOURSELF AS A TROPHY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT YOU BRINGING something and laying it AT THE ALTAR, BUT IT'S YOU YOURSELF. SEE A TROPHY OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT'S CALLED THEM AND MAY THEY BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND DISPLAY THE TOKEN OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN HIS RESURRECTION AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN HERE ON THE EARTH. NOW I WANT Y'ALL TO CATCH SOMETHING. A TROPHY IS TO BE DISPLAYED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. A TROPHY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU GET AND HIDE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU GET AND PUT IN A CORNER. AMEN. BUT IT'S SOMETHING IT'S SOMETHING YOU DISPLAY. AMEN. NOW LOOK AT WHAT THIS WORD TROPHY MEANS. It means something gained, achieved, or given in victory &gt;&gt; or conquest, ESPECIALLY WHEN PRESERVED OR MOUNTED AS A MEMORIAL AS A REPRESENTATION OF SUCH A MEMORIAL. AMEN. NOW LISTEN. A TROPHY IS A game animal or a fish &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUITABLE FOR MOUNTING AS A TROPHY. NOW COME ON FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW I'M IN THE MESSAGE. THERE WAS A FIRST PULL AND IT GOT SOME LITTLE FISH. AND THERE WAS A SECOND PULL AND IT BROUGHT SOME MORE LITTLE FISH. BUT THERE WAS A THIRD PULL AND IT SCATTERED THE LITTLE FISH BUT IT GATHERED THE RAINBOW TROUT. COME ON. YOU DON'T MOUNT A LITTLE BLUEGILL. YOU DON'T MOUNT A LITTLE A LITTLE CARP. AMEN. YOU MOUNT A RAINBOW TROUT. YOU MOUNT SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH MOUNTING. OH, MAY I SAY UNTO YOU, WHEN GOD HOOKED YOU WITH THIS MESSAGE. IT WAS NOT JUST FOR A MEETING. [laughter] IT WAS NOT FOR JUST A YEAR. IT WAS NOT FOR JUST A GOOD SERVICE. IT WAS FOR the rapture of THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. WE'RE GOING HOME AND THERE AIN'T NOTHING THE DEVIL CAN DO ABOUT IT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; A trophy SIR &gt;&gt; IS AN EXPRESSED ATTRIBUTE OF VICTORY. &gt;&gt; When you see a trophy, it is the display. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF VICTORY. NOW, BROTHER SAID GOD HAD A SECRET MYSTERY. HE SAID NOW IT WAS IN THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WAS TRYING AND WAS GOING to achieve. &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing it. &gt;&gt; In order to let himself be expressed &gt;&gt; HE SAID NOW THERE WASN'T A STAR, A MO, A MOLECULE OR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS GOD. &gt;&gt; So in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed. See, in him was love. In him was TO BE A FATHER. IN HIM WAS TO be a son. In him was to be a savior. In him was to BE A HEALER. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE THAT COULD MANIFEST THE VICTORY OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES. &gt;&gt; Come on. THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN LOST, FOLKS. The angels HAD NEVER BEEN SICK. THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN BOUND BY DRUGS. THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN BOUND BY COMPLEXES. AMEN. BUT IN HIM WAS THE ATTRIBUTE TO BE A SAVIOR. IN HIM WAS THE ATTRIBUTE TO BE A DELIVERER. IN HIM WAS THE ATTRIBUTE TO BE A DELIVERER. COME ON, CHURCH. AND I CAN SAY TO YOU THIS MORNING, AMEN. WHAT THE ANGELS COULDN'T GIVE HIM, HIS BRIDE CAN. WHAT THE ANGELS COULDN'T PULL OUT OF HIM, HIS BRIDE HAS PULLED OUT OF HIM. LISTEN, I KNOW YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE A FAILURE. I KNOW YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE WORTHLESS. I KNOW YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, BUT I'VE GOT THE WORD OF THE LORD. YOU ARE A TROPHY OF THE GRACE OF GOD. [screaming] WHEN THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE HAD YOU, WHEN THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE WAS TAKING YOU DOWN FOR THE FINAL TIME, THERE WAS A SEED IN your soul. And today, YOU ARE NOTHING BUT THE MANIFESTATION OF THE GENE of life THAT WAS IN GOD. HALLELUJAH. He says, "WHEN THE WORD OF GOD, AMEN, lit our souls, WHEN THE WORD OF GOD LIT OUR SOULS, we become the SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD." NOW, AMEN. IF YOU, IF YOU STUDY MUCH IN the message, Amen, brother speaks a lot about trophies. &gt;&gt; And it's usually IN PRAYER, AND I JUST TOOK TIME TO LIST IT. HE SAYS, "TROPHIES OF THE MESSAGE." AMEN. TROPHIES OF THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. Trophies of the grace of God. Trophies of the spirit of grace. TROPHIES OF THIS REVIVAL. Trophies of CHRIST'S LOVE AT CALVARY. AMEN. TROPHIES OF THE GOSPEL THAT'S BEEN PREACHED. AMEN. I LOVE THIS ONE. TROPHIES OF YOUR WORD BEING MADE MANIFEST. Preached by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; TROPHIES OF THE MESSAGE. TROPHIES OF THE EVENING LIGHT TIME. OH, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE. TROPHIES OF THE MINISTRY OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL. I'M NOT A FANATIC. I'M A TROPHY. I'M [screaming] NOT A MAN FOLLOWER. I AM A TROPHY OF THE RESTORING GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HAS COME IN MY GENERATION. WELL, GLORY TO GOD. YOU'VE LEFT THE DEVIL LABEL YOU A FANATIC. YOU'VE LEFT THE DEVIL LABEL YOU A C. WON'T YOU TAKE THAT DEVIL'S LABEL OFF AND PUT YOUR real label on? a trophy. [cheering] TROPHIES ARE NOT OBJECTS, FOLKS. THEY'RE PEOPLE. And and I AND AND I JUST SAY THIS JUST TO JUST TO LAY this in there. When brother Brand REFERS TO TROPHIES, I LOVE HOW HE CONNECTS THESE SCRIPTURES to them. IN ST. JOHN 5:24 HE SAYS, "HE that heareth my word trophy &gt;&gt; AND BELIEVETH ON HIM THAT SENT me hath everlasting life AND SHALL NOT COME INTO CONDEMNATION, [cheering] but is passed FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE." THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; JOHN 6:37, "ALL THE FATHER GIVETH ME SHALL COME, and him trophy." &gt;&gt; THAT COMETH TO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT. &gt;&gt; ST. JOHN 10:28, I GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL LIFE, AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH. TROPHY, neither shall any man PLUCK THEM. TROPHY OUT OF MY HAND. MY FATHER WHICH gave them ME TROPHY IS GREATER THAN ALL AND NO MAN IS ABLE TO PLUCK THEM TROPHY OUT OF [screaming] MY FATHER'S HAND. [cheering] OH CHURCH THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID YOU ARE TROPHIES THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO HIS SON CHRIST JESUS BY THE POWER OF HIS PRESENCE AND THE WORD OF GOD. WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE? IT IS THE RETURN OF THE POWER OF GOD AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD BY [screaming] THE WORD OF GOD. SEE, THEN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS MORE THAN A GOOD IDEA. &gt;&gt; IT'S MORE THAN A SUGGESTION, BUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS A CLAIMING MESSAGE. Come on. CAN I CAN I SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "I CLAIM THEM FOR YOU TONIGHT, JESUS. AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL TREASURE, AS GEMS IN YOUR CROWN, AS MEMBERS OF YOUR BRIDE, I claim [screaming] their LIVES &gt;&gt; NOW. NOW, COME ON, FOLKS. What is claiming you?" &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAINTS. WHAT IS CLAIMING YOU? AMEN. SOME OF THE SOME OF YOU ALL COME IN UNDER A PREACHER THAT AIN'T EVEN PREACHING THIS MESSAGE NO MORE. WHAT claimed you? It's &gt;&gt; kind of funny. These guys get so big they don't need brother Brandham no more &gt;&gt; and they go over TO AFRICA AND TAKE TOURS. &gt;&gt; WELL, I might as well preach. THEY GO OVER TO AFRICA AND TAKE TOURS. AMEN. TRYING TO PROVE THE MESSAGE IS WRONG. BUDDY, NOBODY WOULD KNOW YOUR NAME WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE. [cheering] SEE, NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO YOU ARE WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE. SO, IT WASN'T A MAN CLAIMING YOU. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T A CHURCH CLAIMING YOU. THAT'S WHY MEN SAY, "IF YOU LEAVE ME, YOU'LL NOT MAKE IT." BUT I'M STILL HERE. THAT THAT THAT'S WHY PREACHERS, THEY GET UNDER THIS IDEA. WE DON'T NEED TO QUOTE BROTHER BRANDHAM. AND IF YOU QUOTE BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU WON'T HAVE A PULL PIT. WELL, I'LL STAND ON A ROCK AND QUOTE, "BROTHER BRANDON, THIS MESSAGE CLAIMED ME." [cheering] I WASN'T CLAIMED BY SOME PERSONALITY. I WASN'T CLAIMED BY SOME CAMP MEETING. I WAS CLAIMED. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "MAY EVERY CALLED CHILD OF GOD THAT'S IN HEARING DISTANCE OF HERE or either the tape SHALL STRIKE, MAY AT THAT TIME, COME ON CHURCH, MAY AT THAT TIME I CLAIM THEM FOR THE kingdom of God [cheering] UPON THE BASIS OF KNOWING THIS, THE word that's being revealed." &gt;&gt; Now, now, NOW THAT'S WHY I STILL BELIEVE IN THE CLOUD. BROTHER KIMMA, BECAUSE A MAN EXPLAINING IT DID NOT CLAIM ME. &gt;&gt; THE NEWS ARTICLE DID NOT CLAIM ME. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOME SCIENTIST OUT THERE TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT. DIDN'T CLAIM ME. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT CLAIMED ME. THE REVELATION OF IT. BECAUSE REVELATION IS GREATER THAN EDUCATION. IT'S GREATER THAN SENSATION. IT'S GREATER THAN INTELLECTUALISM. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, PRAY TO GOD FOR A REVELATION BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. I'LL JUST SAY THIS. YOU DIDN'T CLAIM THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE claimed you. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND IT CLAIMED YOU ON PURPOSE FOR A PURPOSE BY A PURPOSE. LISTEN, YOU WERE NOT CLAIMED BY ACCIDENT. YOU WERE CLAIMED IN THIS AGE to be a trophy. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say THIS TO YOU. NO MAN CAN TALK US OUT OF IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN DIDN'T CLAIM US. &gt;&gt; REVELATION CLAIMED US. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH THINGS THAT SHOOK YOU TO THE CORE, YOU'RE STILL STANDING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REVELATION GOT A HOLD OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] REVELATION GOT A HOLD OF ME AND IT WON'T TURN ME LOOSE. ON MY GOOD DAYS, I'VE GOT IT. ON MY BAD DAYS, I'VE GOT IT. WHEN I'M ON THE MOUNTAIN, I'VE GOT IT. WHEN I'M IN THE VALLEY, I'VE GOT IT. THIS IS NOT A CHURCH. THIS IS NOT A DENOMINATION. IT'S A REVELATION FROM THE WORD OF GOD AND IT HAS CLAIMED ME FOR ITS FULFILLMENT. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD IN SIN. &gt;&gt; I WAS BURIED IN TRESPASSES AND THIS MESSAGE WALKED INTO THE GRAVEYARD OF MY LIFE AND CALLED MY NAME. [cheering] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW FOLKS, YOU ALL know what Paul said. He said, "Ye were dead in sin and trespasses, &gt;&gt; but hath been quickened together with Christ, &gt;&gt; quickened." [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I love that word dead. It means spiritually dead. &gt;&gt; It means you're destitute &gt;&gt; of a life that recognizes &gt;&gt; and is devoted to God. &gt;&gt; You are inactive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? YOU ARE DESTITUTE OF FORCE OR POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You are inactive. You are inoperative. &gt;&gt; Now, BROTHER B SAID, HERE IS THOSE who were dead. &gt;&gt; Were dead &gt;&gt; and has been raised up. &gt;&gt; THERE IS THOSE WHO WERE IN ACCIDENTS. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SMASHED UP, BUT THEY'RE HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, church of the living God. I can leave that in the natural, BUT WHY NOT BRING IT to the spiritual? AMEN. SOME OF Y'ALL BEEN IN SPIRITUAL CAR WRECKS. Come on. You is &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL CAR WRECKS. AMEN. SOME PREACHER WAS DRIVING AND HE GOT HIS EYES OFF THE MESSAGE AND HE DROVE YOU IN A DENT SOMEWHERE. AMEN. AND THE DEVIL TRIED TO SMASH YOU UP. HE TRIED TO SMASH YOUR FAMILY UP. HE TRIED TO SMASH YOUR FAITH UP. BUT HERE YOU ARE TODAY. [cheering] SEE, BROTHER SAID ALL AROUND HERE, LAME, BLIND, CRIPPLED, in wheelchairs, everything. But they're standing tonight AS LIVING TROPHIES. WHY? IT'S JESUS CHRIST WHO LIVES THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. AMEN. I WANT TO SAY THIS. IN THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN, THERE HAS been innumerable &gt;&gt; innumerable SUPERNATURAL MANIFESTATIONS. that have been done through THE VISITATION OF THE ANGEL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, I GUESS IN CANADA ALONE, [clears throat] THERE WAS AT LEAST 250 OR MAYBE MORE CASES OF CROSSEYED PEOPLE WITH THEIR EYES STRAIGHTENED, &gt;&gt; MUTE, INNUMERABLE TO COUNT THEM, FOR THERE WAS MULTIPLIED SCORES OF THEM that came. There were some deaf, THERE WERE SOME DUMB, THERE WERE SOME HEART OF HEARING, BUT EVERYTHING THERE WERE MADE PERFECTLY WHOLE. &gt;&gt; SEE, NOW THAT'S ONLY DONE THROUGH the visitation of the angel. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE ANGEL, YOU'RE DEAD. WITHOUT THE ANGEL, YOU'RE DESTITUTE OF FORCE AND POWER. LISTEN. BUT WHAT GOD DOES IS GOD GIVES A FOREWARNING SIGN OF HIS VISITATION. AMEN. NOW LET ME SAY THIS. THE FIRST POOL AND THE SECOND POOL WAS NOT THE BRIDE'S POOL. &gt;&gt; THE THIRD POOL WAS THE POOL THAT BELONGED TO THE BRIDE. SO THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL WERE THE PREPARING years or they were the forewarning signs of the oncoming visitation. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD DOES NOT SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED. &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. BROTHER SAYS, "IF I COME HERE TO PHOENIX IN THE NAME OF A PROPHET AND I DO NOT THE THINGS that a prophet does, then don't believe me. BUT IF I COME IN THE NAME OF the Lord Jesus, IN THE NAME OF PROPHECY, AND AS HIS SERVANT, I DO THE THINGS THAT'S written of his servant, then you believe me. Will you do that? LISTEN. IF THE DEAF DON'T HEAR, HEY, &gt;&gt; IF THE DUMB DON'T SPEAK, &gt;&gt; IF THE BLIND DON'T SEE, &gt;&gt; IF THE CRIPPLES DON'T WALK, IF PROPHECIES OF SIN ISN'T FORETOLD, THE PEOPLE AND YOUR SINS FROM THE TIME YOU WAS A CHILD FORETOLD, THEN believe that THIS ANGEL THAT COME TO ME IS FALSE. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; NOW, you want to put Brother Ramy's ministry on trial? Let's preach a minute. &gt;&gt; AND I'M FALSE WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S A MINISTRY I CAN FOLLOW. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING A MINISTRY FOR 40 YEARS, TELLING me something was right, and all of a sudden it was wrong, and now I'm supposed to follow it. &gt;&gt; MOVING ON. [laughter] BUT IF IT MANIFESTS ITSELF HERE ON THE PLATFORM &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU, you believe it and repent of your sins &gt;&gt; AND DISBELIEF FOR THE HOUR OF HIS VISITATION IS DRAWING NEAR. HE ONLY DOES THOSE THINGS TO CONFIRM HIS WORD. SO WHAT WAS IT? ALL THAT WAS IN GOD, HE POURED INTO CHRIST. AND ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST HAS BEEN POURED INTO YOU. REMEMBER WHAT JESUS SAID? HE SAID, "IT'S NOT ME THAT DOETH THE WORKS." BUT THE FATHER THAT DWELLETH IN ME, HE DOES THE WORKS. LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. NOW IN JESUS MINISTRY, HE SAID, "I DON'T DO THE WORKS, THE FATHER DOES IT." &gt;&gt; And greater works than this shall ye do. Now let me just say what what the Bible says in St. JOHN 21:25. AND there are also many other things &gt;&gt; which Jesus did [cheering] &gt;&gt; the WHICH &gt;&gt; IF THEY SHOULD be written EVERYONE &gt;&gt; I SUPPOSE EVEN THE WORLD &gt;&gt; COULD NOT CONTAIN THE BOOKS. I got that devil right where I want him. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN THE BOOKS COULD CONTAIN WHAT HAD BEEN DONE. B SAID, "NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO SAY OF MY OWN MINISTRY. HE'S HAD MORE SUCCESS [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; in my ministry than HE DID IN HIS OWN." NOW REMEMBER, HE HAD MORE SUCCESS. &gt;&gt; NOT ME. HE HE HAD MORE SUCCESS IN JEFFERSONVILLE THAN HE DID IN NAZARETH. HE FINALLY BROKE THROUGH. HE HAD MORE SUCCESS RIGHT HERE IN JEFFERSONVILLE THAN CAPERNIUM OR NAZARETH. HE SAID, "NOW REMEMBER, he &gt;&gt; he IT'S NEVER SAID I DONE IT CUZ I DIDN'T DO IT. I JUST LOVED HIM, [cheering and applause] SUBMITTED MYSELF TO HIM AND SAID WHAT HE SAID. THE HOLY SPIRIT WENT TO THE OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY BELIEVED what he said and then he DONE THE WORK. &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, MAY I ANNOUNCE UNTO YOU THIS MORNING THAT SAME SPIRIT IS RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING THIS MORNING. THE ANGEL OF GOD IS STILL WITH THIS MESSAGE. HE'S STILL DISCERNING HEARTS. HE'S STILL FORETELLING THINGS. HE'S STILL HEALING THE SICK. HE'S STILL SAVING THE LOST. HE'S STILL FILLING WITH THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE VISIT OF A MAN. IT'S THE VISITATION OF ALMIGHTY GOD. Luke 19, 1 Peter 2 is all speaking of the day of visitation, &gt;&gt; the hour of visitation, the time of visitation. Now, IT'S ALSO CALLED THE DAY OF SALVATION. I WANT Y'ALL TO NOTICE THIS. IT'S THE HOUR OF visitation was speaking of the coming of the Messiah. Now, I want you to watch this. the very presence of God's Messiah, &gt;&gt; the son of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember, he only appears to those who are looking for him. &gt;&gt; HE ONLY APPEARS TO THOSE who are looking for him. NOW YOU SAY, "PREACHER, THEN I'VE GOT TO BE OF SOME STATUS OR I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME PRESTIGIOUS APPROACH." WELL, LOOK AT THE WOMAN AT the well. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IN JOHN 4:25? THE WOMAN SAITH UNTO HIM, I KNOW THAT MESSIAH COMETH, WHICH IS CALLED CHRIST. I KNOW THAT THE VERY GOD HIMSELF HAS COME IN THE FLESH OF JESUS CHRIST. NOW I WANT Y'ALL TO WATCH THIS. OKAY, LOOK AT THAT WORD KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? IT means to see. It means to have an interview. It means to visit. &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH THROUGH THE MESSIAH DISCERNMENT WAS THE MESSIAH VISITING WITH INDIVIDUALS. OH, church of the living God. HOW ELSE CAN I SAY IT BUT THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE HAS BEEN FULFILLED. THE MESSIAH HAS RETURNED in this generation AND HAS VISITED WITH THE NEEDS OF GOD'S PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. I LISTEN TO TAPES. I'VE HEARD A PROPHET STAND THERE AND SAY THESE WORDS. HE SAID, "NOW LOOK," HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT THE WOMAN AT the well, right?" He said, "It's another woman at the well situation." He said, "You're not the woman at the well. You're not she." AND HE SAID, "I'M NOT HE, BUT HE'S RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE NOT SHE, AND I'M NOT HE, BUT HE'S RIGHT HERE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAITH UNTO HER, I THAT SPEAK unto thee am he. BUT SAID, THE WOMAN ATTH, SHE RECOGNIZED HER DAY BY THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED THE HOUR OF HER VISITATION, SHE BECAME A TROPHY. SHE BECOME AN EXPRESSION OF THE MESSIAH'S VISIT TO THE EARTH IN HER GENERATION. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. SHE BECOME THE DELIVERED. SHE BECOME THE FREED. SHE BECOME THE HEALED. SHE BECOME THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO BEHAVE MYSELF. BUT HOW CAN I HOLD MY PEACE WHEN THE SAME MESSIAH HAS RETURNED TO MY AGE? AND I'VE GOT OVER 8,000 RECORDED INTERVIEWS WITH THE MESSIAH HIMSELF, VEILED IN THE FLESH OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, REVEALING THE SECRETS OF THE HEART, DELIVERING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. When God re &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD MAKES A VISITATION, you'll either receive him &gt;&gt; or reject him. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. He came to his own &gt;&gt; and his own received him not. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; as many as received him, &gt;&gt; TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME THE SONS OF GOD, even to them that believe on his name. BROTHER RAM SAID SO MANY OF THEM MISSED IT IN THAT DAY. DON'T YOU MISS IT IN YOUR DAY. NOW THIS IS A PROPHET. NOT ME. NOW &gt;&gt; HIM. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; ANY MAN THAT SAYS THIS MESSAGE IS worshiping William Brandham is a liar. [cheering] IT'S A LYING DEVIL FROM THE PITS OF HELL. WILLIAM BRANDHAM STOOD ON THE PLATFORM AND THOROUGHLY DECLARED, "IT'S NOT ME, IT'S HIM. IT'S THE DAY OF HIS VISITATION, NOT ME. I'M JUST A POOR SUBSTITUTE OF ANYTHING, BUT it's him MOVING AND IT'S HIM WORKING." LISTEN, HE JUST GAVE ME AWAY, A GIFT TO YIELD MYSELF TO HIM AND DO THESE THINGS FOR YOUR BENEFIT. WHAT DOES THE PROPHET SAY? THOSE WHO RECEIVE A PROPHET IN THE NAME OF THE PROPHET WILL RECEIVE A PROPHET'S REWARD. THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE AND THE PROPHET WILL ALL BE SAYING THE SAME THING. THEY WILL RECEIVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF A PROPHET'S MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; In other words, &gt;&gt; AS MANY AS recognized him. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, DO YOU ALL KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO recognize something, &gt;&gt; but it's another thing to entertain it? Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, A LOT OF GUYS RECOGNIZE BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'VE never entertained. [applause] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE NEVER ENTERTAINED WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE I IT'S LIKE I INVITE ZACH OVER TO THE HOUSE, BROTHER ZACK. I INVITE HIM OVER AND I SAY, "BROTHER ZACK, COME OVER. I want your fellowship. &gt;&gt; You're the honored guest of the house." &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER ZACH COMES OVER &gt;&gt; AND HE SITS down &gt;&gt; and I say, "He's here." &gt;&gt; And then I go over there and get some I get on the phone and call somebody &gt;&gt; and he's sitting over there and I'm over HERE ON THE PHONE TALKING to somebody. &gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE HE'S IN MY HOUSE. BUT IF I'M GOING TO ENTERTAIN HIM, I'VE GOT TO HAVE CONVERSATION WITH HIM. I'VE GOT TO FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST GOD SENT A PROPHET. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A BELT BUCKLE. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A HAT. THERE IS A MESSAGE. THERE IS A CONVERSATION THAT THEY HAD WITH THE BRIDEGROOM AND HIS BRIDE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. LISTEN. DO YOU KNOW ABRAHAM AND SARAH RECEIVED A VISITATION? AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's in Is this okay? &gt;&gt; It's in Genesis 18. &gt;&gt; And the Lord appeared. &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK WHAT ABRAHAM DID. HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES. &gt;&gt; BROTHER KYLE, HE RECOGNIZED. &gt;&gt; HE LOOKED AND LO, THREE MEN STOOD BY HIM. AND WHEN HE SAW THEM, YES, SIR. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HE WENT BACK TO ORAL ROBERTS AND BILLY Graham and &gt;&gt; now I'm JUST GOING TO STOP HERE AND say it. &gt;&gt; WE GOT a message, folks. &gt;&gt; And if WE BELIEVE IT, IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH STUDYING. &gt;&gt; It ought to be worth reading. &gt;&gt; It ought to be worth preaching. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm here. I might as well preach. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ENTERTAINING NOT THE IDEAS OF WILLIAM BRANDON. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT RECOGNIZING THE DOCTRINES OF WILLIAM BRANDON. THIS IS THE MIND OF GOD. THIS IS THE REVEALED WORD. THIS IS DOCTRINES THAT'S BEEN LAID IN THIS HOLY RIT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN SCRUPLED UP BY THE MINDS OF THEOLOGIANS BEING MADE PLAIN IN THE HOUR WE'RE LIVING IN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now I [laughter] know I know uh brother STEVEN WOULD TELL ME I'm at home. &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to PREACH LIKE I'M AT HOME. I THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STAND FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TIME TO BECOME ASHAMED BECAUSE OF YOUTUBERS. &gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BECOME ASHAMED OF WHAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF SOME YOUTUBER. SOCIAL MEDIA WILL NOT INTIMIDATE ME TO A PLACE THAT I WILL NOT PREACH THE AUTHORITY OF THE OFFICE OF A PROPHET BECAUSE SOME MAN THINKS WE'RE SAYING TOO MUCH ABOUT BROTHER BRANDON. &gt;&gt; NOW, now y'all know where I'm at. &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY THEY ATTACK YOUR PASTOR. THEY ATTACK ME. THEY ATTACK US ALL THE TIME BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO WATER THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO MAKE DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS comfortable [cheering] around THE RANKS OF THIS MESSAGE. THIS IS NOT A BAPTIST MESSAGE. THERE'S A THOUSAND BAPTIST CHURCHES. THIS IS NOT A CHARISMATIC MESSAGE. THERE'S A THOUSAND CHARISMATIC CHURCHES. THIS IS AN EVENING LIGHT VISITATION BY THE RESTORING POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TIME FOR IS THE MESSAGE. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Now I'm here. I might as well say it. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL Y'ALL EVER Y'ALL EVER HEARD A word psychology? &gt;&gt; Y'all ever heard a preacher just blast the spirit of psychology? You heard preacher do that. &gt;&gt; Now, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, don't you? &gt;&gt; Is people get all nervous? &gt;&gt; He shouldn't say that. &gt;&gt; He shouldn't He He shouldn't preach against that. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I remember as a kid, I'm just going to slow down here for a second because I want to lay something in here. &gt;&gt; I remember as a kid when you couldn't go to a meeting without hearing a preacher take a sword to psychology. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And for the longest time I wondered why, you know, &gt;&gt; and and then and then one day I God called me in the ministry and I started studying Brother Bram's message and preaching it and I started hearing him say things like psychologyy's of the devil. &gt;&gt; And then HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HE WOULD SAY, "PSYCHOLOGY IS PERFECT GUESSWORK." &gt;&gt; So any MAN THAT LABELS THE MINISTRY OF BROTHER Brandham psychology is saying his ministry was perfect guesswork. AND THEN THEY'LL START SAYING THINGS LIKE, "WELL, WELL, NOT EVERYTHING'S a spirit." You know, &gt;&gt; we can approach things by psychology. &gt;&gt; We can fix things by psychology. We can we can we can remove the anointing and fix situations and and we can remove the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and we CAN OVER &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S PSYCHOLOGY, FOLKS. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND AND AND SO SO YOU ALL I REMEMBER IN World War I, I read a book of a soldier and he said these words. He said he said you know he said when I was on my front porch he said I was just sitting there as a young man as a kid and in his in his biography and he or autobiography however it is. And he says but I heard that our nation was being attacked and he said something pulled me into the battle. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He said something pulled me. AND HE SAID, "I WENT DOWN THERE AND I GOT A weapon &gt;&gt; and I got a uniform." He said, "I didn't put myself in." He said, "The love of my country pulled me &gt;&gt; into the battlefield." Come on. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN SOMETHING YOU REALLY LOVE IS ATTACKED, [cheering] &gt;&gt; if it's really in your genes, IT WILL PULL YOU [screaming] INTO THE BATTLEFIELD. LISTEN, I'M NOT TRYING TO FIGHT. I'M TRYING TO PREACH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND MEN HAVE ATTACKED THIS MESSAGE. THEN I REFUSE TO SIT ON THE PORCH WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN MY HAND. I KNOW WHERE I AM TODAY BECAUSE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; The attack pulled me. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; somebody somebody says, "Well, then why is all that PREACHING AGAINST PSYCHOLOGY?" WELL, IT'S real simple. Okay, you ready? &gt;&gt; It's real simple. &gt;&gt; And and and and don't don't misunderstand me, &gt;&gt; but just a few days ago or months ago, and God rest your soul, but uh Dr. Dobson passed away, James Dobson. WHICH WAS A SOURCE of where this psychology stuff come into the message from. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not being mean or nasty, but I'm saying God bless Dr. Dobson. &gt;&gt; He did what he felt God called him to do. &gt;&gt; But you [laughter] is this okay, brother? &gt;&gt; But you know what blows my mind is people will lay aside message books &gt;&gt; and they'll GO PICK UP DR. DOBSON'S books &gt;&gt; and they'll BRING THEM IN MESSAGE CHURCHES &gt;&gt; AND STAND BEHIND PULL PITS and read stuff from a man. &gt;&gt; I WONDERED WHY COULD ONE LITTLE THING SUCH AS PSYCHOLOGY CAUSE MUCH SO MUCH CONFUSION. Brother Cle, I found out what it WAS WHEN HE PASSED AWAY. The article said this. It said he was a politically influenced and motivated religious teacher. I SAID, "OH, THERE'S THE SOURCE OF THAT SPIRIT." &gt;&gt; POLITICS. &gt;&gt; WE JUST FOUND THE SOURCE OF IT. NOW, COME ON. I'M IN THE MESSAGE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT POLITICS DOES? IT BRINGS DIVISION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID? HE SAID, "THERE I WAS IN THAT FOREIGN COUNTRY." HE SAID, "AND ALL THEM people were against each other." He said, "The day before they were shooting each other." HE SAID, "BUT ONE MIRACLE, ONE SUPERNATURAL MANIFESTATION OF THE ANGEL OF GOD," HE SAID, "AND THEY LAID THEIR SWORDS DOWN." THEY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND ONE ANOTHER AND THEY WERE SINGING, "OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS." &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WORSHIPING GOD. SEE, BECAUSE ANYTHING WITH THE POLITICAL influence brings division. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going somewhere. Stay with me. OKAY? THEY LAY ASIDE THE MESSAGE BOOKS &gt;&gt; AND GET A PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. &gt;&gt; BUT [laughter] but &gt;&gt; you know what blows my mind, brother Kyle, is them guys ain't getting future home. &gt;&gt; You're right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; THEM TV EVANGELIST WHEN THEY GOT A PROBLEM IN THEIR CHURCH, THEY AIN'T GOING AND GETTING THE seal book. ARE WE &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE LAYING OUR WEAPON DOWN AND BRINGING DULL THINGS IN THE PULL PIT? &gt;&gt; CAN I TELL YOU WHY? BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZED IT, BUT WE HAVE NOT ENTERTAINED IT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE RECOGNIZED IT'S A MESSAGE. WE'VE RECOGNIZED HE FULFILLS MALACHI 4. HE FULFILLS REVELATION 10. BUT WE HAVE NOT ENTERTAINED THE FACT THAT THIS MESSAGE IS THE WORD OF GOD AND IT WILL DEFEAT THE DEVIL ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANY PLACE, UNDER any conditions. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But you KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ABRAHAM RECOGNIZED THAT WAS ELOHIM? YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE SAYS HE RAN. [laughter] He ran AND HE SAID, "I FOUND FAVOR IN THY SIGHT." HE SAID, "LET ME WASH YOUR FEET." HE SAID, "LET ME FETCH A MORSEL OF BREAD AND AND let me let me let me get here." HE SAID, "LET ME GO GET SARAH." &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "NOW MAKE READY QUICKLY THREE MEASURES OF FINE MEAL AND KNEAD IT AND MAKE cakes upon the earth. And he took BUTTER AND THE CALF WHICH HE HAD DRESSED AND SET IT BEFORE THEM. AND HE STOOD BY THEM UNDER THE TREE, AND THEY DID EAT." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT WAS MORE THAN A RECOGNIZING. IT WAS AN ENTERTAINING. NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID? &gt;&gt; He said right before the blessing come, he said Satan tried to block the blessing. &gt;&gt; Now, now can I can I got a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; He says, "What is the blessing?" He says, "In the hour now, now I want y'all to catch this, okay? In the hour of Elohim's visitation, &gt;&gt; Satan is trying to block the oncoming blessing." &gt;&gt; Now, look what he does. He says he was trying to tempt them to feel &gt;&gt; that they had done wrong &gt;&gt; and was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give Abraham and Sarah. Church of the LIVING GOD. WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS HE KNEW THE BLESSING WAS THE BODY CHANGE that would bring forth THE PROMISED SON. SO RIGHT AT THE TIME OF VISITATION, HE TRIED TO PULL THEM OUT OF THEIR FAITH into their feelings and make them feel. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING RIGHT NOW MORE THAN ANYTHING? FEELINGS. I don't feel like I'm saved. I don't FEEL LIKE I'M AN OVERCOMER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOD'S BLESSING ME. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M RECEIVING ANYTHING. I DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO CHURCH. I DON'T FEEL LIKE RAISING MY HANDS. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WORSHIPING. I DON'T FEEL LIKE SINGING. I DON'T FEEL LIKE COME ON. PREACHERS ARE BATTLING. I DON'T FEEL LIKE PREACHING. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU ARE A ROYAL SEAT OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND YOU ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY YOUR FEELINGS. YOU ARE CONTROLLED BY THE ENTERTAINING OF THE VISITATION OF ELOHIM. COME ON. YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT, BUT GET UP AND FETCH SOME BREAD. YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT, BUT GET UP AND GO GET SOME MEAL. YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT, BUT DRESS THE CALF. YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT. IT'S NOT JUST A PREACHER. IT'S NOT JUST A CHURCH. ELOHIM. [cheering] ELOHIM. ELOHIM HAS RETURNED. HE'S AT YOUR TENT DOOR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Make her feel &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's not worthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm preaching RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; MAKE HER FEEL SHE'S NOT worthy &gt;&gt; of Elohim's visitation. How many services do we come to? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And we sit there under a cloud of condemnation. &gt;&gt; Under a cloud of guilt. &gt;&gt; Under a cloud of oppression. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy. &gt;&gt; I'm not good enough. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THIS IS A VISITATION. I KNOW NOW IS THE TIME OF MIRACLES. I KNOW NOW IS THE TIME PRODICALS are coming home. I KNOW NOW IS THE TIME THAT GRACE IS BEING dispersed to the seed of Abraham. I KNOW NOW IS THE TIME, BUT I'M SIMPLY NOT WORTHY OF THIS VISITATION. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT WASHED JESUS' FEET? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT WASHED JESUS' FEET? YOU THINK SHE FELT WORTHY? YOU THINK SHE DID THAT BECAUSE SHE FELT WORTHY TO DO IT? BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU BEGIN TO ENTERTAIN ELOHIM? IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM YOU. DO YOU REALIZE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO ENTERTAIN ELOHIM, IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU FEEL. IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK. CAN I SHOW IT TO YOU? WHILE SHE WAS DOWN THERE WASHING HIS FEET, YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID? HE SAID HER SIN WAS GOING ON HIM AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS COMING ON HER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [screaming] &gt;&gt; OH BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, ELOHIM IS HERE THIS MORNING. IT'S MORE THAN A PREACHER. IT'S MORE THAN A PROPHET. IT'S MORE THAN A GROUP OF PEOPLE GATHERED IN A RELIGIOUS SETTING. ELOHIM IS MATERIALIZING. ELOHIM IS IN THIS BUILDING THIS MORNING AND HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL RUN FAST AND THEY'LL FETCH A MORSEL OF BREAD. THEY'LL make a cake. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL ENTERTAIN HIM. ELOHIM. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said? &gt;&gt; He said, "Elohim, come down." &gt;&gt; To visit Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said it would return again. Elohim, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; not another person, &gt;&gt; the same person [cheering] &gt;&gt; returning into the church and would do the same thing. THAT WOULD BE THE SIGN AND THE VOICE WOULD BE CALL THEM BACK TO THE WORD, RESTORE THE FAITH OF THE CHILDREN to the fathers. There is the sign and the voice. What is it? The same God who came down in human flesh and eat milk and drink and eat meat and drink milk and Abraham said rather he was Elohim God manifest in the flesh revealed the son of man. Listen just &gt;&gt; before your bodies. [cheering] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT TO YOU? IT'S TIME [screaming] TO GET OUT OF YOUR FEELINGS. IT'S NOT RAPTURING FEELINGS. IT'S RAPTURING FAITH. If you can believe THAT THIS THIRD PULL IS ELOHIM MATERIALIZING, THE REVELATION OF GOD RETURNING TO THE CHURCH, THE SON OF MAN. THERE HE WAS STANDING THERE IN FLESH AT THAT TIME LIKE A THEOPHONY. HE SAID, "WATCH." HE WAS STANDING THERE DISCERNING SARAH WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IN THE TENT BEHIND HIM. He promised. &gt;&gt; Watch &gt;&gt; the royal seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; is promised to see &gt;&gt; the same thing. The royal &gt;&gt; royal &gt;&gt; seed &gt;&gt; royal seed &gt;&gt; of Abraham &gt;&gt; is promised &gt;&gt; is promised &gt;&gt; to see &gt;&gt; SOMETHING LIKE IT &gt;&gt; SOMETHING CLOSE TO IT &gt;&gt; SOMETHING SIMILAR SOMETHING RESEMBLING IT THEY ARE TO SEE THE SAME THING COME ON CHURCH. WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN IT, THEN YOU KNOW THE NEXT THING IS THE CHANGING OF YOUR BODIES. HALLELUJAH. WELL, IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I'D TRY TO BE GETTING YOU IN YOUR FEELINGS, TOO. IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I WOULD TRY TO BE MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WAS UNWORTHY, TOO. BUT I AM THE ROYAL SEED OF ABRAHAM. I HAVE SEEN THE STAR. I HAVE SEEN THE RETURN OF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. AND I'M GOING TO ENTERTAIN HIM. I'M GOING TO WASH HIS FEET. I'M GOING TO SERVE HIM A MEAL. I'M GOING TO BLESS HIS NAME. I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT HIS PROPHET SAID. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S ELOHIM. HE'S HERE. HE'S VISITING YOU. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you talking about?" &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you? THE GENTILES message started &gt;&gt; by a visitation. &gt;&gt; WELL, I GOT ON MY SHOUTING SHOES THIS MORNING. THE GENTILES MESSAGE. IT STARTED BY A VISITATION. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE. ARE you ready for it? And it ENDS THE SAME WAY. NO, Y'ALL DIDN'T HEAR ME. THE GENTILES MESSAGE, IT STARTED WITH A VISITATION OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE and it ends the same way. OH, BROTHER, I CAN HEAR BROTHER BRAM SAY IT THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? HE SAYS, "THOSE who follow THE PILLAR OF FIRE WILL HAVE A HARD WAY TO GO." HE SAID, "BUT THEY WILL BE READY FOR THE TRANSLATION at that time." [applause] &gt;&gt; Listen, CAN I JUST PREACH IT TO YOU? &gt;&gt; This visitation brought a restoration for a translation. &gt;&gt; WILL YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THOSE THREE WORDS? VISITATION, RESTORATION, TRANSLATION. THIS VISITATION OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE BROUGHT A RESTORATION OF THE WORD and the restoration of the word &gt;&gt; is bringing A TRANSLATION TO YOUR BODY. [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE. THE PILLAR OF FIRE has come. Now, &gt;&gt; yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I got to skip over something here, &gt;&gt; but let me say this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angelic visitation, &gt;&gt; I like to say this way, &gt;&gt; the Elohhemic, &gt;&gt; the Elohim, &gt;&gt; the the the Elohim, &gt;&gt; THE MATERIALIZATION OF ELOHIM, &gt;&gt; THE ELOHIM VISITATION, &gt;&gt; to Abraham AND SARAH'S TENT WAS TRUE. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER, &gt;&gt; how did you know &gt;&gt; that Abraham and Sarah &gt;&gt; had had a visitation &gt;&gt; with Elohim? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Sarah's body changed. BROTHER KYLE, HER BODY CHANGE &gt;&gt; WAS AN EVIDENCE THAT ELOHIM &gt;&gt; HAD BEEN TO THEIR TENT. OH, GLORY. YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "IF A MESSAGE COMES AND IT'S THE SAME OLD THING," HE SAID, "IT DIDN'T COME FROM GOD." HE SAID, "BUT IF A MESSAGE COMES AND IT BRINGS A CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO HEAR IT, IT IS AN EVIDENCE THAT MESSAGE HAS COME FROM GOD." AND OH GOD, AND SARAH'S BODY BEING CHANGED BECOME A VISIBLE EVIDENCE. ELOHIM HAD BEEN BY THEIR TENT. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, NOW, NOW, can I say this to you? &gt;&gt; The people who recognize &gt;&gt; and receive their visitation. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; They're always criticized. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ALWAYS CRITICIZED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PETER SAID. HE SAID, "HAVING YOUR CONVERSATION HONEST AMONG THE GENTILES, THAT WHEREAS THEY SPEAK AGAINST YOU AS EVILDOERS, THEY MAY BY YOUR GOOD WORKS WHICH THEY HAD SHALL behold &gt;&gt; glorify God &gt;&gt; in the day of visitation." &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; can I tell you what criticism means? &gt;&gt; You know what criticism means? &gt;&gt; It's the expression of disapproval &gt;&gt; of someone &gt;&gt; or something. Now you know where that criticism comes from. &gt;&gt; Based on perceived &gt;&gt; NOT BASED on facts, &gt;&gt; NOT BASED ON ANYTHING OF TRUTH, JUST perceptions &gt;&gt; perceived. NOW, YOU READY FOR THIS? CRITICISM COMES from perceived faults &gt;&gt; or mistakes. &gt;&gt; See, they say, "How can you hold your head up so high? &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU WORSHIP GOD LIKE YOU DO? HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU PREACH THAT MESSAGE? AND HOW CAN YOU GO IN ALL THOSE AREAS OF THAT REVELATION? LISTEN, YOU WILL NOT CRITICIZE ME OUT OF MY POSITION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID? HE SAID, "CRITICISM ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE WORD IS THE GROWING PAINS OF THE GRACE OF GOD." &gt;&gt; NOW, now I just got to say it. Amen. Critics are going to criticize whether you do good or do bad. They're just going to criticize Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; They're critics. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. &gt;&gt; THE WHOLE BASIS OF THEIR CRITICISM IS SOMETHING THEY ARE PERCEIVING. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT PERCEIVING COMES FROM? IT COMES FROM IMAGINATION. SO THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING. AND AS THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING, THEY BEGIN TO PERCEIVE SOMETHING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's kind of like YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL TALKING ABOUT somebody &gt;&gt; cuz &gt;&gt; cuz you don't KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT MIGHT already be under the blood. &gt;&gt; And the blood removes your foundation for criticism. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say this to you. &gt;&gt; They can criticize you, &gt;&gt; but they can't stop you. I'm not going to preach all day, but I want you to hear this. &gt;&gt; They can criticize you, [applause] &gt;&gt; but criticism don't stop life. &gt;&gt; LIFE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN CRITICISM. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAID? HE SAID, "AND HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY OF the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence." Now watch this. Life coming into the body is the vindication &gt;&gt; that the rapture is at hand. &gt;&gt; There's no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily. Now listen, it couldn't do it in Luther's age. &gt;&gt; It couldn't do it in Wesley's age. It couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; But in the day &gt;&gt; when the son of man will be manifested, revealed, brought back, the church together &gt;&gt; with the entire deity of God amongst his people. We'll be showing the same visible signs, manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifest on earth in a form of a prophet. God, oh glory, promised by Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the scriptures where you worship at. the house of God. &gt;&gt; Seated. &gt;&gt; Somebody say seated. &gt;&gt; Seated. &gt;&gt; Now, can I say this to you? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; In present tense. &gt;&gt; Criticism, &gt;&gt; it's okay. &gt;&gt; It can't remove you from your seat. When you know who you are, [cheering] &gt;&gt; when you know where you come from, &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE STANDING, [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE ENTERTAINING, &gt;&gt; when you know what you're believing, WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING, WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE FOLLOWING, &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; You can stand in your position. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you. &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't struggle with the message &gt;&gt; because of the message. They struggle with it because of what men have done with it. &gt;&gt; They don't struggle with the message because of it. &gt;&gt; They struggle with it because what men has done &gt;&gt; with it. &gt;&gt; But if you ever see this message is not a man [cheering] If you EVER SEE IT'S NOT BROTHER BRANDHAM SIR, &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PREACHER. &gt;&gt; It's the word revealed. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Can Can I tell you and I'm going to CLOSE ON THIS, BUT I want you to catch something. If you can ever see this message is your way out. &gt;&gt; WHEN NOTHING ELSE COULD BRING YOU OUT, THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; BROUGHT YOU OUT &gt;&gt; WHEN NOTHING ELSE COULD GIVE YOU THE PROMISE OF TOMORROW. THIS MESSAGE GAVE YOU THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER DAY. [cheering] When you CAN SEE THAT THIS MESSAGE IS NOT BROTHER BRANDHAM, IT'S ELOHIM VISITING this generation and YOU BEGIN TO ENTERTAIN IT. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't mean to slow down on you, &gt;&gt; but but can I just share something with you and I'm sorry I'm I'm bringing something to you from home if that's okay. But but just the other day I was preaching at home along these lines on God making a visitation and I was sitting in my office studying some things and I was just going through some quotes and I was just I was going through some quotes and I was listening to a tape and I had my Bible over there and I was reading I was reading my Bible and I was tying them quotes and scriptures and all of a sudden just in my little office there I heard brother Brad on tape and it wasn't it wasn't directly connected but he says these words. He says in in this one paragraph he says Arkansas God's visiting you. And I said, "Wait a second. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS." &gt;&gt; I REWOUND IT AND I HEARD IT AGAIN. ARKANSAS, IT'S GOD VISITING YOU. &gt;&gt; AND I GOT TO THINKING, "OH YEAH, NOW NOW I KNOW PEOPLE." AMEN. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING, "YOU'RE TAKING THAT TOO FAR." WELL, LET ME TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING. I CAN'T TAKE IT TOO FAR. [cheering] I can't TAKE IT TOO FAR BECAUSE THE TRUTH CAN NEVER EXPIRE. &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT THERE IN MY OFFICE, YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I PAUSED THAT TAPE AND I SAID, "COME HERE, DEVIL. COME HERE, DEVIL. COME HERE. I WANT YOU TO HEAR SOMETHING." AND I REWOUND IT. [clears throat] AND I SAID, "NOW, DEVIL, WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THAT? YOU CAN CRITICIZE ME ALL YOU WANT TO.

I CANNOT SEE, &gt;&gt; BUT I HEARD HEARD. HE THAT HATH AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT HAS TO SAY UNTO THE CHURCHES. I'M BLIND. I CAN'T SEE. BUT I HEARD I HEARD THERE WAS A MAN OVER HERE [laughter] AND HE WAS PRAYING FOR PEOPLE AND THEY WERE GETTING HEALED. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY FOR THE TRIAL? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY FOR THE TRIAL? ARE YOU READY FOR THE TRIAL? &gt;&gt; YOU don't believe THAT, DO YOU? &gt;&gt; YES, I DO. I DO. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID? &gt;&gt; WITH ALL MY [screaming] HEART, [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL MY HEART, I BELIEVE IF YOU GET ME TO THAT HEALER, [screaming] I'LL FIND MY DADDY.

COULDN'T FIND ISAAC UNLESS SHE FOUND ELEAZAR. AND WHEN SHE MET ELEAZAR, SHE SAID, "TAKE ME TO ISAAC. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.

I promise. &gt;&gt; What about when a prophet of God walked into a mute school? &gt;&gt; Now, now, saints, this wasn't a mute hospital. It was a mute school. &gt;&gt; What do you go to school to do? &gt;&gt; Learn. &gt;&gt; He walks into a mute school &gt;&gt; where there are 150 dumb and deaf children in the school &gt;&gt; learning. I'm done preaching. I'm just having fun now. LEARNING &gt;&gt; LEARNING HOW TO REMAIN IN THIS CONDITION. &gt;&gt; HOW TO PUT UP WITH THIS CONDITION, HOW TO LIVE DEAF, HOW TO LIVE AS A MUTE, HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT BEING THEY WERE NOT, IT WAS NOT A HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE ADMINISTERING MEDICINE TRYING TO MAKE them better. [clears throat] IT WAS A SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE TEACHING THEM HOW TO LIVE IN THAT CONDITION. &gt;&gt; But then Elohim &gt;&gt; REVEALED IN THE FLESH OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL COMES WALKING IN A HOSPITAL. NO, IN A SCHOOL WHERE THEY'RE SITTING THERE TELLING THEM, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND AND YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HEAR AND YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO TALK." AND HE WALKED IN THERE AND ONE PRAYER, ONE PRAYER, AND 150 DUMB AND DEAF CHILDREN GOT UP OUT OF THE CHAIRS AND BEGIN TO TALK AND BEGIN TO SPEAK. [applause] Come on, CHURCH. ARE YOU ALL HEARING ME? I [laughter] I CAN SAY THIS. AMEN. SOME OF YOU ALL WAS IN THE DENOMINATION WHERE THEY WERE TEACHING YOU HOW TO BE AN ADULTERER AND STILL BE A CHRISTIAN. THEY WERE TEACHING YOU HOW TO LIVE WITH YOUR CIGARETTES AND LIVE WITH YOUR ADULTERY AND LIVE WITH YOUR THIS and but the word &gt;&gt; made a visitation &gt;&gt; and there was a seed in your soul &gt;&gt; and you begin to hear that word &gt;&gt; and brother Ariel that word it begin to claim you. It begin to claim you. You begin to say, "I can live right. I CAN LIVE HOLY. I CAN BE SANCTIFIED. I CAN BE SEPARATED. I CAN LIVE ABOVE REPROACH. I CAN LIVE ABOVE LEOTYA." OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, IF THIS MESSAGE HAS CLAIMED YOU, YOU OUGHT TO STAND ON YOUR FEET AND RAISE YOUR HANDS AND SAY, "THANK GOD. [applause] THANK GOD. [screaming] I HAVE BEEN CLAIMED. The visitation &gt;&gt; of Elohim, &gt;&gt; Elohim's revelation. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Elohim's re revelation &gt;&gt; brought a restoration. &gt;&gt; And that revelation &gt;&gt; has prepared you &gt;&gt; for translation. Listen as our musicians come this morning. &gt;&gt; Whatever condition you're in, &gt;&gt; Elohim's in the building. &gt;&gt; Somebody run quick and get some bread. &gt;&gt; It's Elohim. &gt;&gt; Somebody run quick and get a morsel. &gt;&gt; Somebody go quick. [music] &gt;&gt; Somebody go quick and knead the meal. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY GET THAT CALF OUT THERE AND DRESS IT. ELOHIM'S HERE. &gt;&gt; Elohim's in the building. &gt;&gt; ELOHIM'S IN THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; Whole church of the living God. &gt;&gt; How can you sit there this morning entertaining those thoughts of condemnation &gt;&gt; when Elohim's in the building? [music] I ask you this morning, &gt;&gt; you know what a visitation is? &gt;&gt; A visitation [music] is a divine encounter. &gt;&gt; It's a divine intervention. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but this morning I remember where I was. [music] How many can you say, "I remember where I was." I remember where I was. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't you allow the devil Don't you allow the devil to water this message down. [music] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you don't want to entertain Elohim, that's fine. But as for me [music] and my house, &gt;&gt; we're going to entertain Elohim. [music] &gt;&gt; We're going to entertain this message. &gt;&gt; We're not just going to recognize it. [music] We're going to entertain it. &gt;&gt; We're not just going to recognize [music] the angel of God was with the prophet. &gt;&gt; We're going to entertain that angel. [music] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, you all make too much out of the message. &gt;&gt; I don't make any more out of it [music] than what God did." [music] &gt;&gt; It's a visitation. &gt;&gt; Now is the time. Now is the hour. &gt;&gt; What What are you What are What are you doing this morning with your visitation? [music] &gt;&gt; I I I don't have time to preach it to you, but I'll just say it to you real quick. A visitation is a divine [music] opportunity. &gt;&gt; What What are you doing with your divine opportunity? [music] &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are you Are you entertaining it? &gt;&gt; Are you washing Elohim's [music] feet? Are you are you are you are you pouring all that you are out on this word? [music] &gt;&gt; Are you giving everything you got to it? &gt;&gt; Are you allowing it to transform you? [music] Are you allowing it to bring the grace and power of translation upon your life? Listen, I think it's time we recognize I want y'all to catch something in that in that scripture in Luke 19. [music] Brother, brother Kelly, the Bible says that because thou did not recognize him [music] in the day of thy visitation, the Bible said that they would be laid in a trench. [music] You know what else it said? And thy children, &gt;&gt; thy children [music] within thee. &gt;&gt; Because mom and daddy didn't recognize &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Because mom and daddy didn't recognize that this is Messiah's visit. &gt;&gt; Their children, their unborn children. &gt;&gt; Their children laid in the trench with them. [music] &gt;&gt; Folks, when are we going to realize that this is more than just a Wednesday night and a Sunday [music] morning? Come on. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's more than just getting together and saying amen. &gt;&gt; But it's a life outside the four walls of this building. &gt;&gt; It's a Nazerite vow of separation upon your heart. [music] &gt;&gt; See, when you recognize it, &gt;&gt; when you recognize what it is, [music] it'll cause you to give your life to it. Listen, I believe this morning I believe Elohim &gt;&gt; has made a visitation &gt;&gt; in this generation and I believe he's here this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; And I want to entertain what he's had to say. &gt;&gt; Criticize me all you want to, &gt;&gt; but your criticism will not cause me to leave Jesus in the corner &gt;&gt; with dirty feet. &gt;&gt; I'll entertain him. [music] I'll entertain him. Let's bow our hearts this morning. I'll entertain him. &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning, would there be one could say, "Lord, I hear your word. [music] I feel your presence. I hear you speak into my heart this morning. I'm not here to be ugly. I'm not here to be mean. I'm not here to be rude. But I am passionate about what I believe in. [music] And I believe this message has brought a separation between denomination and the word. I believe this message has brought a clear a clearcut [music] decision to the church of the living God. I believe this message has restored [music] the truths of this holy Bible. And I believe if a prophet said it, we ought to have the courage to stand behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Men can go on world tours. They can go around the country holding seminars and going across seas and putting [music] forth their efforts &gt;&gt; to destroying the faith of God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amazes me. &gt;&gt; But what about you here this morning? &gt;&gt; What' you say? I'm tired of being on [music] the I'm tired of being on the passive side of this. I want to take the initiative side of what I believe in. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; I want to stand with conviction. Not arrogant, not mean, not hateful, not nasty, but truthful with conviction in my heart. I believe this message is the Elohim visitation. &gt;&gt; To this generation, a prophet has come. The word has been revealed. It's not about a man. It's not being in Brother [music] Bram's presence or any other preacher's presence. It's about being in the presence of the word. But oh, I say it very plainly this morning. Without Noah, you didn't get on the ark. Without Moses, you didn't leave Egypt. [music] &gt;&gt; And without this seventh angel's message, &gt;&gt; you will not see a rapture. &gt;&gt; It's [singing and music] rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith is not in the flesh of brother Brandham. It's in the [music] word that he revealed. &gt;&gt; And if you can sit down and turn on them tapes and open up your Bible and begin [music] to pray and open your heart before God, I challenge you. Spoken word tabernacle. I challenge you. [music] I challenge you to get serious before God. I challenge you to recognize the [music] seriousness of the visitation of God in the hour you're living in. I challenge you to open your Bibles. [music] &gt;&gt; I challenge you to turn on a tape &gt;&gt; and sit there with your heart open, &gt;&gt; listen to that word, &gt;&gt; and as that word begins to strike something in [music] your heart, &gt;&gt; let that word claim you. &gt;&gt; Let that word claim you. He's sitting there in your house and your kids are away from God and [music] you begin to hear a prophet talk about buying thy house and he takes it from the book of Acts. Let that word strike that seed in your soul and let it claim that wayward child. You're sick in your body. Turn that word on and begin to read Isaiah 53 and let the spirit of God strike that word in your soul and let [music] it claim healing in your life. Elohim's visitation. And almighty God, we bow our hearts in your presence this morning. Father, all across this building, Lord, as believers of like precious faith, [music] Lord, your sons and daughters are standing before you this morning, Lord, with open hearts, Father. Not looking to a man, not looking to a church, [music] Lord, but looking to the word, the word that can save our souls, [music] the word of life that can transform us. Now, Father, I believe as we speak your word this morning, I believe lives are being claimed right here. [music] Father, what's claiming the lives of these believers to believe this message, Lord, it's not the personality of a preacher. Lord, it's not the it's not the the [music] uniqueness of a church or or the beauty of a building, Lord, but Father, what's claimed these eagles, what's claimed these believers [music] is the revelation of your word. Father, I don't think I just have to preach it and leave it there in Arkansas. But [music] Lord, I think of how your prophet come right here in North Carolina, right over there in Spindel, North Carolina. And he begin to call out our brother [music] Mike orders. I believe it was his mother in that meeting, Lord, in that revelation. Claimed that family. And Lord, for many years they've served you. And brother Mike has gone on to his reward. But Lord, there's still generations from that visitation. Lord, Father, this message has visited generations. Lord, I think of how it's went to Africa. It's went to India. Lord, it's it's [music] went to Europe. It's went to New Zealand, Australia, Father. It's gone into the jungles of [music] Africa, Lord. It's gone into Alaska, Lord. It's gone into the uttermost parts of the world, Father. And Lord, everywhere there was a seed, everywhere this message has visited, Lord, it's claimed [music] them, Father. Lord, I think of in Russia, Lord, where where there was walls of of political divisions, but your word went right in there and it claimed believers there. Father, I believe right there in Japan and right there in Korea, Father, in China, Lord, I I think of our brother Murphy Wong there in CLOVERDALE BIBLE WAY. LORD, OUR BROTHER WAS there [music] in the in the church and and he was a part of that church. I thank the state church in China. And Lord, this message come by his way. This message made a visitation. And Lord, there was a seed in his soul. And Father, it claimed him, Lord. Father, from all over this world, Lord, now Father, men will set out today. And they'll make excursions into foreign lands. And they'll make trips around the world trying to disprove this. But Lord, they will never stop it. [music] It's already claimed flesh. Life is already moved into the body. The rapture is at hand [music] now. Lord, give us strength to work until that last seed comes in. Father give us courage to stand without ashamed this father [music] without confusion but stand with revelation and strength [music] in Jesus name we pray. In Jesus name we pray. Oh [music] want you raise your hands this morning. The angel of the Lord is in the building today. [music] The angel of God is right here in this building this morning. He's passing by your way. Say, "Lord, help me. [music] Help me." God bless you there. Hands up all over the building. Lord, help me. Help me to recognize the hour [music] of visitation. He is here. [music] Amen. [singing] He is [music] here. You can you can entertain him [music] and you [singing] will never be [music] the same. Before we sing that again, I want to say this to [music] you this morning and I want to say it very plainly and I want to say it very [music] very passionately. Quit entertaining the devil. &gt;&gt; Quit entertaining criticisms. &gt;&gt; Quit entertaining nonsense. &gt;&gt; Entertain Elohim. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The time you spend entertaining what somebody's saying about this message [music] is time you could be spending growing deeper in the roots [singing] &gt;&gt; of truth and grace. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many say, I'm going to leave here today with a renewed vision of entertainment. Yes, sir. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm done entertaining what they're saying. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on believing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going [singing] to keep on worshiping. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on loving God, loving his people. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what's in my heart. [music] &gt;&gt; Because it's in my heart to do it. &gt;&gt; It's in my heart to serve [music] God. Amen. [singing] &gt;&gt; If God puts something in your heart, &gt;&gt; if God puts it [music] in your heart, &gt;&gt; it don't matter how many people misunderstand you. [music] &gt;&gt; If God put it in your heart, &gt;&gt; follow God. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing] &gt;&gt; Entertain the &gt;&gt; entertain [music] the bidding of the father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray something was said to bless you today and to help you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I pray something was said to encourage you. We thank you this morning for your [music] time. We thank our brother Stephen for the confidence, the opportunity to stand here once again and we sure [music] love you with all of our hearts. And amen, all of our all of our heart, everything we are, we love the bride of Christ [music] and we love God's people. And amen, I I say we thank you for your prayers and your support. [music] And Amen. Many of you we've been we've been speaking to since just a young man, but the grace of God has kept us. [music] Amen. And kept us together. Amen. We might have been in some wrecks, but the grace of God brought us out. &gt;&gt; And we're still standing &gt;&gt; because this word, &gt;&gt; this revelation claimed [music] us. Make sure you've been claimed by the revelation and not a man. &gt;&gt; And no matter what comes your way, you'll overcome it. [music] You love him this morning. Until we meet again, God bless you, brother. Did you come [music] [music and singing] [singing and music] here? He [music and singing] is here. And [singing] close we [music] calling [singing] your [music] name. [singing] You [music] can touch me your name. [singing] [music] You can [singing] touch [music] him. You will [singing] be touching. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Can we sing one more to him this this morning before we go? He's here. So, we want to entertain him just a couple of minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] We want to sing Set Your Wings. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You may take one by [music] side, [singing] one by [music] faith.
