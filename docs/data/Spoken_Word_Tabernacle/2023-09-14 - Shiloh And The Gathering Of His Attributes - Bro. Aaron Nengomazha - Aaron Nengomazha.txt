Miss Tracy amen amen um we're gonna invite brother Michael to share with us his testimony tonight amen so brother Michael and again one two praise the Lord everybody well praise the Lord for this word praise the Lord for the message of the hour so we know you and you right so my wife and I we went out to her sister's house done some things for her there and then we went and did some other things and on the way home you know that rain Sunday was just pouring down it's like buckets and so we're approaching home and it's just pouring down so much I said I don't feel like I want to get wet so I was listening to brother Branham and he says you don't cast out demons with hate because the devil is hate he cast them out with love so I said Mr rain I know you have to do what you have to do because the Earth you know drink it's up the water according to the word of God so I know you got to do but I don't feel like I want to be wet at this moment so if you would kindly stop and let me get out my car into the house I'll be so grateful we pull up to the driveway the rain just stopped amen amen and um the testimony is you remember the woman with the issue of blood for was it 12 years and um again Jesus said were they not ten where are the nine well I don't identify myself with the nine I'm going to identify myself with the wine so as you can see I got a nice walk amen so I just want

believe we have unspoken requests tonight amen we bring all that before the Lord amen can I give a little quick little quick testimony I wasn't going to do it but we you know we've got our little farm going on our cows are eight months old now we had trouble with them when they were about a week or two last week we bought 10 chicks 10 to add to the chicken well we got up yesterday and one was dead the little chick we keep them in a little bucket in the house and one was completely dead and we watched another one wither and die and die right before us we just you know I guess it's just part of the well I went outside to do something and my wife went in there keeping them in the laundry room and she started she got that little chick and she said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I what a I I don't know how the song goes I give to thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk well we got we had ten if we lost one we still got nine the chick the chick was fine I was in shock I think we're going to call our place the miracle Farm because everything is just a miracle amen let's pray let's stand God is good he's mindful amen we want to thank him for protecting our brother Charles again today the third and probably another potentially very scary scenario so let's let's um thank the Lord for that Lord we just Lord It's just overwhelming sometimes to um just to witness your

name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so happy to be with you tonight this is our second home and we love it so much we bring you greetings from our church and our pastor brother Barry coffee they they're sending their greetings to you and we came with our family and today we have a special not a visitor but family member my mother-in-law my wife's mother she all the way from Zimbabwe you can wave your hand sister Elizabeth God bless you wonderful that was a good welcome please make it comfortable want you to feel the good Southern Bible hospitality praise be to God amen so if we could stand upon our feet to go straight to the word of God I believe my wife is in the nursery let's read from [Music] I need to change this light this is meant to be Genesis not Galatians all right so Genesis 49 verse 9. the Bible says here Judah is a lion's world from the prayer my son Thou Art gone up he's stooped down he encouraged as a lion and isn't is an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be amen you may have your seats for a little uh title we want to talk about Shiloh and the Gathering of his attributes praise be to God praise be to God I believe tonight we I am speaking to the attributes of almighty God the Bible says I have saved your gods and all of you are children of the most time though you shall die like all men though you shall fall like the princes but I have said you are gods so you are the attribute of God and God's attributes are Eternal because God is eternal and his thoughts are Eternal and his attributes are eternal and eternal gods an infinite God can only have infinite attributes praise be to God so when you receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving the quickening power that is quickening the life that already was in shoe and you didn't know about it that's what the prophet teaches as friends amen praise be to God Amen so here in Genesis Jacob was blessing his sons right and and the father he still has the blessing tonight to bless his children amen and if you are a child if you want God to bless you you have to receive your blessings from your father amen you need the blessings from your father you need the blessings from your pastor amen you need the blessings from your from from your mother those are blessings that come through the scriptural Channel amen praise be to God yes sir you have to get the blessing from your father amen if you marry right your father will bless you if you do things right your father will bless you yes sir praise be to God preach the father was given authority to bless you yes sir because the father is the priest the father so he can bless you and he can also curse you that's right if you are a son if you are a daughter yes you want to make sure that you secure your father's blessing amen amen so Jacob was old yes sir but he still had the blessing that's right he was becoming blind because he was older but he still had the blessing yes by the virtue of his office right and he was blessing the children of of his sons and he starts with Reuben yes sir says Reuben you are unstable as the water because you climbed up and took my my wife and you defiled my bed that's right he did what he did but he didn't know that his father was gonna pick it he forgot that his father was a prophet and at the time of receiving the blessing right God remembered and this you are not going to prosper you are going to be unstable like water and the blessing went from from Reuben and it went to Joseph that's right because the the blessing of the firstborn is to come from the person that comes from the mothers whom the first Yes master right so Joseph was the first born yes Rachel that's exactly praise be to God yes sir but Ruben forfeited the blessing right because of his conduct and sometimes you will not lose eternal life but you will lose the blessing that's right because of your contact pray to my brother sometimes you will lose the adoption because of your contact that's it sometimes you use the promotion right because of your contact that's exactly reaction comes through the conduct also amen praise be to God glory to God the prophet says for example under no circumstance must a Believer marry an unbeliever go ahead my brother if you do it the prophet says there will be troubled down the road yes my brother yes there will be troubled down the road yes sir you try it's guaranteed yes trouble down the road yes my brother yes sir yes my brother praise be to God bless so the scepter is a symbol of sovereignty amen it's a symbol of power right it's a symbol of authority right because God is Sovereign you cannot be a king unless you are sovereign if you're not sovereign that's why Jesus Christ is the only true king amen because he is the only one that is Sovereign amen praise be to God Amen so for you to be a king you have to be Sovereign yes my brother amen and Judah was given the stewardship right now stewardship means that you don't own something but you are only keeping it for for a season on behalf of someone right so this scepter belongs to Shiloh Hallelujah that's the true owner of the scepter yes sir but he is saying it shall be with Judah for a meantime until Shiloh comes that's right because Shiloh is the original owner of the serp amen amen [Applause] it was given to Adam for a season that's right but Adam forfeited it by conduct right right Hallelujah right but it could not go back to the devil it went back to God original because he is the original owner of the title yes my brother so the scepter belongs to Shiloh and who is Shiloh Shiloh is Christ Shiloh is Christ Shiloh is Jesus Christ this is the one that is the scepter he is the one that is the road of righteousness [Applause] praise be to God so he says the scepter shall not depart from between your feet Now put on your spiritual caps to the spiritual caps shall not depart from between your feet means that it shall not depart from your descendants because that's it's not it's not gonna depart from your loins your descendants amen so the kingship belongs to Judah that's and his descendants until Shiloh comes yes sir praise be to God Amen just like the church the church was given the scepter right at the day of Pentecost right because that's remember the church does not have power but the church has Authority right because the scepter is a symbol of authority that's right but the king himself he does not have power but he has Authority amen you just say God's arrest him right God do this the king himself may not have the power to fight the battle that's right but he has the word that commands amen so Judah was supposed to keep deception right and I want you to know that God takes things very seriously yes sir and the church was given sacred virtues the church was given Authority that's right to be the representative of Christ on Earth that's right until Shiloh comes amen again the second time that's right praise be to God amen go ahead brother Hallelujah yes sir so Judah is a lion's world right a lion's world is the son of a lion right now in question and answers yes sir now I've been going through the question and answers from 1953 the the first happened to 1965 and I've been having a wonderful time there are about 26 of them and I have been having a wonderful time and I hope all of you are up to date with your service [Applause] praise be to God the prophet says yes sir now the Gathering will be unto the Lord is Jacob in the 49th he said when Shiloh comes right and the Gathering will be unto him amen there will be no longer from between the feet until Shiloh comes speaking of Judah right and unto him shall the Gathering be amen that's what the prophet says yes because people were saying but the prophet was saying we are not going to be God that under a denomination no sir we are not going to be gathered under a group but we are going to be God that and in Christ that's exactly because remember there was a question that came to the prophets yes sir and he said and he said shall we come to Tucson or shall we be in Jefferson that's right and he says you shall not be in Jeffersonville or in Tucson but you shall be in Christ so people were looking for a physical place to gather right Hallelujah people were looking for a physical place to Beach but here the prophet he says we shall be gathered under the revealed message of the earth Amen in other words it's not as in a physical Gathering no sir it's a spiritual Gathering hallelujah amen so when we say we are gathering together in heaven we are gathering in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because you could be in this church right now but your mind is in France that's exactly you could be in church right now but your mind is in Africa Praise You should be in church right now but we are gathered in Christ amen I have seen people who change churches eight times a year you will never have a Revival right the Revival comes if you accept the word by faith amen the Revival does not come from changing churches and changing pastors comes from accepting the word of the hour yes my brother yes not a place amen just like young people sometimes they go from Camp to camp preacher 41 one came in January one came in separate one came you two will never do you any good pray to my brother because Christ is not in campus is revealed in his own words amen Hallelujah yes my brother the attributes of Christ yes gather around Shiloh yes Shiloh is the Refuge message of the hour yes my brother yes sir gloriously to God Ephesians 1 verse 9 yes sir having made known unto us the midst of his will today I'm gonna go slowly and you'll be reading the the scriptures in the slides according to his good pleasure which he has purposed yes himself amen he purposed this in himself amen so this is all about Christ yes sir that in the dispensation of the fullness of times right amen can I pause here for a second yes my brother the prophet in the message called adoption there is a Time code that dispensation of the fullness of time it's actually a dispensation that is called the fullness of time yes sir and he says this is the time that we are living in right this dispensation is called the dispensation of the fullness of time amen so what Paul was prophesying in Ephesians 1 verse 9 is actually fulfilled in our days yes my brother he says it's called that that dispensation of adoption that's right because remember nature is groaning yes sir it's it's groaning the Earth is groaning yes sir it's waiting for the manifestations right of the sons of God Amen but the sons of God they are manifested at the fullness of time that's exactly and this fullness of time it's a dispensation yes my brother some call it the dispensation of the seventh seal yes but it's the same thing that in the fullness of times he may gather together in one of things in Gastonia in Jeffersonville in Tucson in what in Christ both which are in heaven yes sir and where which are in Earth and even in him so everything shall be gathered in Christ amen amen hallelujah amen so all the ministers they came through the ages yes sir they were holding the scepter of the word right they were holding the church right until Christ comes Hallelujah yes sir and at the opening of the sales he steps out and he makes his claim and he gathers all things together in shame amen amen amen that's why the seals are such a big deal because the cross he is purchasing but the sales is coming to claim that's it righteous amen what is the point of paying for something if you can't claim it that's right amen flaming is more important than purchasing amen [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah if you are approved go ahead for for a house or for a credit card for a car and you don't go and claim it what is the use [Music] but when you go to claim that that's when your joy is full amen amen that's why the happiest day of every girl yes sir it's a wedding Hallelujah because that's when the bride steps up and claims The Pride the bridegroom comes and claims the bride and be and checks there to be with him that's right you can buy ice cream you can buy pizza you can do this but she wants to teach Hallelujah yes and breaks the seal and claims yes my pride Hallelujah yes sir yes my brother and you change your last name from sorry to sorry that's what Christ does when he opens the seals he steps forth and he's taking what he precious amen amen amen amen hallelujah yes my brother praise be to God yes sir keep moving my brother Colossians 1 verse 25. wherefore I am made a minister right according to the dispensation of of God which is given me for you and yes now this dispensation was given to Paul right it was given to the angel right it was not given to everyone no sir it was given to God that's right it was given to me for sure that's right and the word dispensation if you look it up in the Greek it's actually stewardship dispensation is a stewardship which was given to power right and in our age it was given to William Branham amen hallelujah amen to fulfill the word of God Amen praise be to God Amen it was not given to anyone else a dispensation is given to the age of Amen that age amen that's the Bible yes my brother now so many people are looking for a church a great group of people be caught up together at church a denomination some Creed something to be caught up that's not it that's not it at all right the Gathering of people and God's causes flock together he may take two out of Jeffersonville that's right two out of Indiana two out of Kentucky two out of Mississippi but he will they will all gather together in Jesus Christ amen so it's not a group Revelation it's an individual Revelation to show of what Christ is amen it's not what is happening at this Camp no at that church no it's what Christ is to show amen your personal revelation amen what you catch that personal revelation you are baptized into the body of Christ amen and you are gathered in Shiloh yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir we are gathered in Jesus Christ amen now the reason why it's a stewardship right it's because everything belongs to Christ amen amen we'll get back to that let me guess let me continue here the prophet says and the rod that Moses had in his hands it was not the road of Moses it was the road of God God's judgment wrought Moses held it out over Egypt and flies came he held it out and fleas came up right wherever he dumped his Rod it was judgment Road right it brought judgment Upon A disobedient people so so so so the scepter of Moses was the scepter of God Amen but the scepter itself was just a symbol right but God told Moses take the road and gather the people that's exactly because it's the road that gathers the people it was a Shepherd yes the flock by a staff yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah yes praise be to God Amen and the staff of every Shepherd is the word of God if you don't have the word of God you have no Ministry if you don't have a Doctrine you have no Ministry amen how are you going to gather the flock without the road pray to my brother Hallelujah preach because remember in the restoration of the bright tree that's right the prophet says there were four the Palmer worm the caterpillar and in the locusts amen and the king of whim amen one at the leaves one else the the the back right one at the fruit right and the prophet says the back is the doctrine that's it of the church that's it and the leaves are the fellowship that's correct amen amen so to restore the church it also means to restore the doctrine amen amen amen hallelujah yes sir because some church is there for the leaves but there's no back preachers some Churches they have the back but they have no fruits that's right hallelujah amen amen everything amen amen and the Bright Tree yes can also be a marriage tree some marriages have no back there is no boundaries everything everyone does whatever they want preachers their children have no curfew Bridge there are no standards they can wear whatever they want they can go wherever they want they can slip off away if they want the home has no Doctrine that's right Hallelujah pray to my brother in some homes yes they have no leaves there is no Fellowship yes that leaves the prophet says the leaves is the fellowship that say my brother everyone everyone is on their phone their phone nobody talks to the next person that's right everyone is busy this one is doing their homework this one there is no time to sit at the dinner table together that's right Everyone is always busy that's right foreign says the Lord amen amen amen amen amen some homes they have no fruits go ahead brother go ahead keep moving Hallelujah keep moving my brother there's no fruit there's no buying chocolate there's no honey I love you the Locust has eaten the fruit there's no sweetheart [Applause] anyway [Applause] stay right there preach my brother [Applause] Hallelujah that's what the kinkowm did that's it that's what the Palmer went did Hallelujah yes my brother when God restores Amen he restores everything he restores the fruit the Baka that leaves everything else amen amen [Applause] what good is it to have the leaves when there is no fruit that's why Jesus Christ cursed the Fig Tree because it was full of leaves no fruit but there was no fruit Amen in that home they were wearing matching outfits but they were fighting every day Hallelujah anyway let me move pray to my brother preaching let's let's go to my brother Hallelujah yes sir and Moses took the Judgment Road and smart The Rock to bring forth water therefore it was the Judgment Road of God that's more Jesus and killed him right now let's continue I I see people love this anyway it's the spirit one time when they killed the Prince of Peace the prophet says they put him in a grave and sealed up the tomb right and death helped him for three days and nights but on Easter morning he had the scepter in his hands so Christ has the scepter we're just building a foundation here right to my brother the prophet says he'll recognize your day and this man she says here is my I said Parker my word here is my scepter rather take my scepter go forth and bring the message amen so so the prophet in our day is our Moses that's right and he was given the scepter Amen to gather the people amen so the people are gathered by the word of God I don't gather the young people with soccer you don't gather the young people with barbecue Hallelujah they are gathered by the sector of the message of young men amen preach my brother Hallelujah preach the prophet says he says when it comes to a place where I have to play Banco games to keep people in the church sure she says I will quit the ministry because the gospel has lost his power amen that gospel is the main
