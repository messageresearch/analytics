[29:38] our prayer on spoken prayer request
[29:40] tonight amen
[29:44] amen
[29:46] amen yes I just remembered I was
[29:48] supposed to to write this testimony but
[29:52] I forgot and just came back on my heart
[29:54] this
[29:55] morning um as I was reading the
[29:58] scripture you know I've been diagnosed
[30:01] with
[30:03] glaucoma and the doctor said it is uh
[30:06] there's no way they can stop it nothing
[30:08] they can do I don't have any underlying
[30:11] causes for it because normally it's
[30:13] caused by diabetes but I don't have that
[30:16] but I do remember that my mom used to
[30:19] talk about
[30:20] it she having it and um one of my uncles
[30:24] is
[30:25] blind so the enemy said you can't get
[30:28] away it's in your jeans regardless of
[30:31] what you have and I have been resisting
[30:34] that
[30:35] thing and there's another a sister here
[30:37] that give a testimony about it so they
[30:40] gave me these eye drops to keep taking
[30:42] but um it doesn't really help anything
[30:45] but I am so
[30:48] convinced that the power that lays in me
[30:52] greater than
[30:55] thata so I already began
[30:59] when I when I to the um scan of my eyes
[31:02] there already parts of you know like a
[31:04] computer screen and some of the pixels
[31:07] are missing already began to get that
[31:10] kind of thing coming around my focal
[31:12] view so I I'll not see everything I'm
[31:15] looking at some things would be missing
[31:17] like a black line here and there but
[31:19] this moment I was reading and this eye
[31:22] is the one that is the bad one so I
[31:24] covered this one I was reading I said
[31:26] man I am seeing what I'm looking at so
[31:30] happy I say thank God I have the victory
[31:34] OFA praise God praise God thank you Lord

[51:28] his word and his word is the obsolete
[51:31] amen amen that's exactly right so that
[51:34] um because of that testimony I want to
[51:37] read a scripture I want to go to if I
[51:39] open your scripture it's going to be 2
[51:41] Corinthians 4 verse
[51:47] 18 amen when you get there say amen
[51:52] amen all right while we look not at the
[51:56] things which are seen But after the
[51:58] things which are not seen but for the
[52:01] things which are seen are temporal but
[52:03] the things which are not seen are
[52:05] Eternal am amen you may be seated May
[52:09] amen
[52:10] so the things that are not seen are
[52:14] Eternal that's right and we know that
[52:16] before the foundation of the world the
[52:18] lord had us in the back part of his mind
[52:21] and we know that that when the situation
[52:23] may look one way we're not looking at
[52:25] that situation we're looking at the
[52:27] promise that the Lord has made for us
[52:29] you see and and just like you know what
[52:32] did what how did Paul look at the
[52:34] situation when situation came upon him
[52:36] he L at he looked at the promise that
[52:37] the lord gave him see see when something
[52:41] happens see it see if Satan don't hold
[52:44] back I'm not going to hold back okay I'm
[52:47] not if Satan if if Satan is going to try
[52:51] and and and and and stop me from
[52:53] preaching this word I'm going to preach
[52:55] with all that amen amen see I'm going
[52:58] preach I'm going to preach this way with
[53:00] authority because the Lord has given me
[53:02] that Authority before the foundation of
[53:04] the world I was a Son of God and and and
[53:06] in job 38:7 he said where were you when
[53:09] the when when the stars was when the
[53:12] stars gave Praises in the in the in the
[53:14] sons of God singing see that was get
[53:17] that was us right there that was me see
[53:19] because and we know the Stars when when
[53:21] God had Abraham look at the stars he
[53:24] said though those were us that that was
[53:26] a seed see and if we're that seed that
[53:29] Faith seed that means that when when
[53:32] Satan's lie came and took those third
[53:34] part of those Stars see we were the ones
[53:37] who fought against him see we were the
[53:39] ones who kicked him in the mouth and put
[53:40] him down here and and and and uh on the
[53:43] world see see because because the Lord
[53:46] said our feet will be on the neck of our
[53:47] enemies see see see death words thy
[53:51] death wears thy Victory grave death
[53:53] wears thy steam grave wears thy Victory
[53:55] amen amen so um I want to go to a to a
[53:59] to a message that uh brother brandham uh
[54:01] preached um uh on uh Christ is the
[54:04] mystery of God revealed see um see okay
[54:09] U my title is manifestation of his
[54:11] threefold purpose amen we are the
[54:14] manifestations of that okay so so it it
[54:18] reads it reads uh that was his one of
[54:21] his great three-fold purposes which to
[54:23] express himself identify himself with
[54:26] human beings to reveal himself in Christ
[54:29] see and we know that see secondly to
[54:31] have the preeminence in his body of
[54:34] Believers that in his bride that he
[54:37] might live in people see first to
[54:39] express himself completely God in Christ
[54:43] second to have preeminence by this in
[54:46] his church which is his body his bride
[54:48] so he could have the preeminence to
[54:50] express himself through them all right
[54:52] and thirdly to restore the kingdom to
[54:56] rly position that fell by sin by the
[54:58] first adom back to where he walked in
[55:00] the cool of the evening evening with him
[55:02] and his people talked with them
[55:04] fellowship with them amen that's what
[55:06] we're Believing on amen amen amen uh I
[55:09] want to go to I want to go to Ephesians
[55:12] 1 four four the
[55:15] five
[55:18] amen amen see Satan is just a tool see
[55:21] he he's just a tool to express what God
[55:24] has in US amen
[55:26] amen because because in in the Garden of
[55:29] Eden we know that that when when when
[55:32] Eve fell see God knew it was going to
[55:35] happen see the whole purpose for the
[55:38] fall was because if everything was
[55:40] perfect how could he Express himself to
[55:42] human how could he Express himself to us
[55:44] if everything was perfect it couldn't
[55:46] happen that way it wouldn't it work
[55:49] amen amen I got to get there myself
[55:52] Ephesians 1
[55:57] Ephesians 1:4 when you get there say
[56:02] amen amen
[56:07] amen all right it reads according as he
[56:10] hath chosen Us in him yes sir before the
[56:12] foundation of the world see before the
[56:15] foundation of the world that we should
[56:17] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[56:20] love amen having predestinated us unto
[56:23] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[56:26] am to himself see according to the good
[56:29] pleasure of his will see it was his will
[56:32] for this to happen it was his will for
[56:34] us to express Christ on Earth amen amen
[56:38] and and and what is what is Christ
[56:41] Christ means anointed one see we are to
[56:45] be Anointed with with with God see
[56:49] because because we are God that's that's
[56:52] amen amen amen amen uh just drop drop to
[56:57] verse n see having made known unto us
[57:00] the mystery of his will the mystery of
[57:03] his will so the mystery of his will to
[57:05] express Christ amen the mystery amen the
[57:09] mystery of his will according to his
[57:11] good pleasure which he have purpose in
[57:13] himself see it's him that does it we
[57:15] don't we don't do it because we weren't
[57:17] worthy see the lamb had to take the book
[57:20] because no man was worthy to take the
[57:22] book see in man because because we were
[57:25] born by sex we're not not worthy amen
[57:28] amen um and and then it says in that
[57:31] dispensation of the fullness of times
[57:33] see in the fullness of times which is
[57:35] now that he might gather together in one
[57:38] all things in Christ all things in
[57:41] Christ in one both which are in heaven
[57:44] and both and both which are on earth
[57:46] even in him amen amen amen I want to go
[57:51] to I I want to go to um Ezekiel
[57:54] 4 I mean I sorry Isaiah 14 I'm sorry
[57:58] Isaiah
[58:02] 14 because we know that Christ is the
[58:05] mystery of God revealed and that if
[58:08] Christ see it didn't say Jesus is the
[58:11] mystery of Christ revealed Christ is the
[58:14] mystery of of God revealed because
[58:16] Christ is the anointing and we are to
[58:19] have that anointing to express Christ
[58:22] see so we are the mystery of God
[58:24] revealed because
[58:27] what what what was in in in in
[58:31] Revelations 5 when the book when see it
[58:34] wasn't a literal book God doesn't need a
[58:36] book it wasn't a literal book the book
[58:40] was the revelation of God the book was

[58:55] about a little book it was talking about
[58:58] the revelation of what it means to be
[59:00] God Amen and and what does it mean to be
[59:04] God Amen and that's what those seven
[59:07] seals are see because because our
[59:09] Prophet told us that brother Benham told
[59:11] us that that that that that seven seal
[59:13] when it was silent see that was Christ
[59:17] see he said that was Jesus that was

[1:02:31] because of that we are Kings we are
[1:02:33] priests so we know that when we

[1:02:51] Millennium rule he's going to be B bound
[1:02:53] up and as Kings and Priests we're going
[1:02:55] to rule amen amen now I want to I want
[1:02:59] to read from uh the questions and
[1:03:00] answers law having a shadow um brother
[1:03:03] bam says and Michael the Archangel the
[1:03:06] great one that stands in the presence of
[1:03:07] God and his angels fought against Satan
[1:03:10] and his angels the red dragon that was
[1:03:12] the church that's led by the Holy Spirit
[1:03:14] and the angels of God fought against the
[1:03:16] organization and his angels and
[1:03:18] Ministers of light that was us see
[1:03:19] seeing how seeing how see how it was
[1:03:22] perfect if they're speaking of something
[1:03:24] up into Glory it's thinking of the
[1:03:26] Spiritual Beings in Rome the red dragon
[1:03:28] that stood before the woman to devour
[1:03:29] her children amen I was uh I was reading
[1:03:33] I've been reading recently the book of
[1:03:35] Acts and I've I've read it before but
[1:03:36] I'm I'm reading it again and as I'm
[1:03:39] reading it I'm the Lord the Lord just
[1:03:41] shown me
[1:03:43] that the second book of Acts is supposed
[1:03:46] to happen
[1:03:48] because they
[1:03:49] understood they caught the revelation
[1:03:53] after after God after Jesus left of what
[1:03:56] it means to express Christ and with that
[1:04:00] they worked signs they did wonders and
[1:04:02] they were able to have boldness see they
[1:04:05] were so bold to the point to where when
[1:04:08] the when the the the his when Phillip's
[1:04:13] no when Steven's persecutors persecuted
[1:04:15] him in the in the in the uh in the court
[1:04:19] that instead of answering them he gave
[1:04:21] him a whole sermon like he preached to
[1:04:23] them a whole sermon instead of answering
[1:04:26] the question so he answered the question
[1:04:28] in the sermon he told them the all the
[1:04:30] Old Testament up to that point then I
[1:04:33] was like wow see that's boldness see we
[1:04:35] ought to have that boldness amen because
[1:04:38] we have the revelation of who we are see
[1:04:40] we're being told who we are see if if if
[1:04:43] we can see the the the five garments of
[1:04:46] of Joseph in our lives then we must be
[1:04:48] able to we must be able to apply that
[1:04:50] and we must be able to see where we are
[1:04:51] in our own lives and that also means
[1:04:54] that if we're looking at those Seven
[1:04:56] Seals that means that if we can see the
[1:04:59] the five garments of Joseph in our lives
[1:05:00] those Seven Seals must be brought in our
[1:05:02] lives as well because it's personal it's
[1:05:05] it's it's individual God God works with
[1:05:08] with with Israel as a church he works
[1:05:11] with the Gentiles as individuals
[1:05:14] amen amen so I want to go to uh
[1:05:17] Ephesians 5 uh 8- 18
[1:05:26] Ephesians
[1:05:38] 58-18 we get there say
[1:05:40] amen for ye for ye were sometimes for ye
[1:05:44] were sometimes Darkness but now ye are
[1:05:46] light in the in the Lord walking as
[1:05:49] children of light amen for the fruit of
[1:05:52] the spirit is in all goodness and
[1:05:54] righteousness and TR truth that's right
[1:05:57] proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
[1:06:00] and have no fellowship with the
[1:06:01] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:06:03] reprove them amen for it is a shame even
[1:06:06] to speak of those things which are done
[1:06:08] of them in secret amen but all things
[1:06:10] which are reproved are made manifest by
[1:06:13] the light for whatsoever doth make
[1:06:14] manifest is light wherefore he saith
[1:06:17] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:06:19] the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:06:22] light see then that ye walk circumspect
[1:06:25] not as fools but as wise Redeeming the
[1:06:28] time see walking circumspectly meaning
[1:06:32] we're walking carefully see in all
[1:06:34] things we we we look and see so when
[1:06:37] something happens Lord why is this
[1:06:38] happening Lord why why am I in this
[1:06:40] predicament what are you trying to show
[1:06:42] me see you go when when something
[1:06:44] happens to say you don't want to happen
[1:06:45] or say um something something bad
[1:06:48] happens um process of process of
[1:06:50] elimination Lord did I do something
[1:06:52] wrong if you see that your life lines up
[1:06:54] Lord what are you trying to show me oh
[1:06:56] what is the lesson in this amen amen and
[1:07:00] then then it says uh Redeeming the time
[1:07:02] because the days are evil amen wherefore
[1:07:05] be not unwise but understanding what the
[1:07:08] will of the Lord is amen and the will of
[1:07:10] the Lord amen the whole purpose that I
[1:07:13] I'm trying to get the whole thought that
[1:07:15] I want to express tonight is that the we
[1:07:19] want to get the will of the Lord that
[1:07:22] that's that's what I want to focus on
[1:07:24] Amen let's go to um Psalms
[1:07:32] 3723 because if you have the will of the
[1:07:34] Lord if you know that still silent voice
[1:07:38] when all the Thundering is going on just
[1:07:40] like when when uh when uh Elijah was in
[1:07:43] the cave all the thunderings all the
[1:07:45] winds all the hows was was was going on
[1:07:48] yes we know that's how the Lord speaks
[1:07:49] but Lord how are you speaking to me
[1:07:51] personally see that's the still smiling
[1:07:53] voice amen and that's will personally
[1:07:56] for
[1:08:00] you what to
[1:08:03] Psalms Psalms
[1:08:05] 37:23 amen yes
[1:08:09] sir
[1:08:11] amen amen amen all right I want
[1:08:16] to are we get there say amen amen all
[1:08:21] right it
[1:08:24] reads the step of a good man are ordered
[1:08:26] by the Lord and He
[1:08:29] deliver and he delighteth in his way
[1:08:32] amen so we know that our steps are
[1:08:34] ordered of the Lord so we know that
[1:08:37] whatever happens whatever is going on in
[1:08:39] our in our lives that all things work
[1:08:43] together for the good of those that love
[1:08:45] the Lord that walk in the spirit and
[1:08:48] that walk not after the flesh but after
[1:08:49] the spirit amen which are in Christ
[1:08:51] Jesus amen which are in Christ Jesus see
[1:08:54] because we know that when you're hearing
[1:08:56] the word and you hear that deep calling
[1:08:58] into the deep you feel that pull in your
[1:09:00] heart see that's you hearing from your
[1:09:03] theophany amen that's exactly what that
[1:09:05] is because brother bam said that's
[1:09:06] exactly what that was you're hearing
[1:09:07] from your theophany amen because our
[1:09:10] theophany beholds the father's face amen
[1:09:12] and when we're hearing from our
[1:09:13] theophanes that means that our we're
[1:09:17] becoming one with the word more and more
[1:09:20] amen because our Theo godfy part of form
[1:09:24] of our form of God is calling drawing
[1:09:27] more to us amen amen because that's why
[1:09:30] we know that theosis is man becoming God
[1:09:33] and and and what kyos is was God
[1:09:35] becoming man amen amen now um I want to
[1:09:39] read I want to read uh greater than
[1:09:41] Solomon is here um it reads now we
[1:09:44] notice before we get to our text he
[1:09:46] referred back to Jonah and a lot of the
[1:09:48] people has always thought of Jonah as
[1:09:49] being a man that missed the will of God
[1:09:52] I don't believe that any man walking in
[1:09:54] the will of God can miss the will of God
[1:09:56] I don't believe that any man walking in
[1:09:58] the spirit can miss the will of God he
[1:10:00] might think he did but God makes it all
[1:10:02] work together right he brings everything
[1:10:04] out right amen let's go to uh Ephesians
[1:10:07] 2:10 amen want to go to Ephesians
[1:10:10] 2:10
[1:10:23] amen get there saying amen
[1:10:26] amen okay it reads we for we are his
[1:10:30] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:10:34] good works which God hath before
[1:10:36] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:10:38] amen now I want to go to uh Romans 4 20
[1:10:41] to
[1:10:49] 2 amen because it says that we were
[1:10:51] created in Christ Jesus and we know that
[1:10:55] when the foundation of the world before
[1:10:58] the foundation of the world when the
[1:10:59] world was being made and that logos was
[1:11:01] sweeping over the world that we were
[1:11:04] part of that logos amen
[1:11:08] amen amen so uh Romans 4 20 to
[1:11:18] 25 it reads he stagger not at the
[1:11:21] promises of God this is talking about
[1:11:22] Abraham he staggered not at the promises
[1:11:25] of God through unbelief but were strong
[1:11:27] in faith giving glory to God and being
[1:11:30] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:11:32] promised he was able also to perform
[1:11:35] amen see because and I I like this
[1:11:39] scripture because when you read it we
[1:11:41] can go back in Genesis we can see two
[1:11:44] times when naturally we say he staggered
[1:11:47] at the promise that's right see because
[1:11:51] because we know we have a natural record
[1:11:54] we know we have
[1:11:56] a Divine record amen and we know that
[1:11:59] our our our divine record our our
[1:12:03] Prophet says that the Lord sees our
[1:12:05] finished product he sees our finished
[1:12:07] work amen see because our theophanies
[1:12:09] behold the father's face so that's what
[1:12:11] he sees amen so so if he if he's seeing
[1:12:15] that so and in this tossing the see of
[1:12:19] God's for forgetfulness when God goes
[1:12:22] back and he looks at it he says he
[1:12:23] staggered not at the promise amen so so
[1:12:27] even when it may seem at times to when
[1:12:29] our faith May falter amen we know that
[1:12:33] we know that when God when God goes back
[1:12:35] in his roex and looks back at it he sees
[1:12:37] that we stagger not at his promise amen
[1:12:42] amen and and it says that in being fully
[1:12:45] persuaded that what he had promised amen
[1:12:48] he was also able to perform amen because
[1:12:51] we know that it's impossible for God to
[1:12:53] go back on his word we know that God
[1:12:55] does not change his mind about his word
[1:12:57] because his word is eternal and when
[1:12:58] something that Eternal is set in stone
[1:13:00] it cannot be be erased amen amen now I
[1:13:04] want to go to uh Isaiah 30 verse
[1:13:10] 26
[1:13:18] amen Isaiah 30 verse 26
[1:13:28] yeah when you get there say amen amen
[1:13:31] all right amen it reads moreover the
[1:13:35] light of the moon shall be as the light
[1:13:38] of the sun and the light and we know the
[1:13:40] moon types the
[1:13:42] bride that's us amen it says moreover
[1:13:45] the light of the moon shall be as the
[1:13:47] light of the sun and the light of the
[1:13:49] sun shall be Sevenfold as a light of
[1:13:52] seven days amen see that's the
[1:13:54] revelation of all the seals in one amen
[1:13:58] see and that in the day that the Lord
[1:14:01] bindeth up the breach of his people and
[1:14:03] health The Stroke of their wound amen
[1:14:06] amen I want to go to uh Revelations 3
[1:14:10] 20-
[1:14:16] 22 amen valians 3
[1:14:23] 20-22 amen
[1:14:26] it reads behold I stand at the door and
[1:14:29] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:14:33] the door I will come into him and will s
[1:14:36] with him and he with me to him that
[1:14:39] overcometh see that's the promise with
[1:14:41] the with the um that that's the promise
[1:14:44] with the seventh Church age Amen to him
[1:14:47] that overcometh will I grant to sit in
[1:14:49] my throne even even as I also overcame
[1:14:54] and am set down with with my father in
[1:14:56] his throne amen he that hath an ear let
[1:15:00] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:15:02] church unto the churches amen we know
[1:15:05] that when the Lord is saying this right
[1:15:06] here we know that Throne is the when
[1:15:09] we're sitting in his throne we have the
[1:15:10] power to rule amen so when we overcome
[1:15:14] and what are we overcoming brother bam
[1:15:17] said the hardest thing for men to
[1:15:18] overcome is that human part amen we're
[1:15:21] trying to overcome this flesh amen and
[1:15:24] be and the only way we can do that is by
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ amen and when we overcome
[1:15:30] this flesh
[1:15:32] amen that's when we have the right to
[1:15:34] rule
[1:15:36] amen help me Lord help me Lord help me
[1:15:40] Lord and what I want to get to is that
[1:15:43] yes
[1:15:45] sir the thought I'm trying to express is
[1:15:49] that once we see the seals in our lives
[1:15:53] because we know the first seal was the
[1:15:54] wife white horse rider we know that's
[1:15:56] the Catholic church amen we know the and
[1:16:01] um we know the second horse rider is the
[1:16:04] the red horse rider you know that's
[1:16:05] that's that's the Catholic church again
[1:16:07] because the rider did not change that
[1:16:09] that's the Catholic church but now is is
[1:16:12] using has a sword in his hand and it's
[1:16:14] using war and is killing amen amen
[1:16:17] that's that was the ox amen and then we
[1:16:19] know that the the black horse rider that
[1:16:22] was u i mean yes the black horse rider
[1:16:25] we know that uh that was the that was
[1:16:28] using uh the the political power and
[1:16:32] church power to rule of the people amen
[1:16:34] and then we know that that the the um
[1:16:37] the the the fourth horse horse horse
[1:16:40] rider was given a name under the under
[1:16:44] the the the eagle a prophet amen you
[1:16:48] know he was given a name which is death
[1:16:50] amen that's conglomerate of all of them
[1:16:52] that's what makes the callor pale of the
[1:16:53] horse rider amen
[1:16:55] and we know that once we um we know that
[1:16:58] that that was you know the maturing of
[1:17:01] all those horse riders together and then
[1:17:04] and then then we know that the the fifth
[1:17:06] seal we know that uh that was the the
[1:17:10] the Jews amen um with the the Vengeance
[1:17:13] amen we know that that the six hill we
[1:17:15] know that that that was um the the
[1:17:18] tribulation period and then then there
[1:17:20] was a silence in the seven seal but the
[1:17:23] prophet tells us that was Christ amen
[1:17:25] because Amos 3:7 says that nothing is
[1:17:27] done except first shown through a
[1:17:29] prophet amen and and that and to see
[1:17:34] that in our lives see to take it off the
[1:17:36] book of the pages to make it personal
[1:17:38] amen that means that from the first seal
[1:17:42] to the fourth seal that is the religious
[1:17:45] spirit that be working with you
[1:17:47] individually amen and then we know that
[1:17:50] that the that that that fifth seal
[1:17:53] that's that's your uh your nature of
[1:17:55] wanting to Vengeance amen we know that
[1:17:59] that the sick seal that's when things
[1:18:00] are going wrong in your life when you're
[1:18:02] sick when you're when when when you're
[1:18:04] um things of that nature amen and then
[1:18:06] we know that that um that once you get
[1:18:10] past all those seals overcome those
[1:18:12] seals you know that uh you get into that
[1:18:15] silence that's when you're your you and
[1:18:17] Christ are with each other um in the
[1:18:19] holies of holies or the silence you
[1:18:21] don't know what's going on behind there
[1:18:23] amen and and that and that's what I want
[1:18:26] to get that's what that's what that's
[1:18:28] the thought I want to get across amen
[1:18:30] that's what was hitting upon my heart
[1:18:31] greatly amen because that we know that
[1:18:34] um because Christ's mief got revealed in
[1:18:36] Revelations 10 uh let's go to
[1:18:38] Revelations 10
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:47] amen amen get there say amen amen it
[1:18:52] reads and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:18:54] come down from Heaven clothed with the
[1:18:57] cloud and the rainbow was upon his head
[1:19:00] and his face as it were the Sun and his
[1:19:02] feet as an anim of fire
[1:19:04] amen and then uh drop down to eight it
[1:19:08] says in the voice which I have heard
[1:19:10] from Heaven spake unto me again saying
[1:19:12] go and take the little book which is
[1:19:14] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:19:16] standeth upon the sea and and upon the
[1:19:18] Earth and I went the angel and I said
[1:19:20] unto him give me the the little book see
[1:19:23] give me that re Revelation amen and it
[1:19:28] said and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:19:32] it up amen and it shall make thy belly
[1:19:35] bitter and it shall be in thy mouth
[1:19:37] sweet as honey amen and I took the
[1:19:39] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:19:41] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:19:44] as honey and as soon as had eaten it my
[1:19:47] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:19:49] this is what I'm going to get you he
[1:19:50] said unto me thou thou must prophesy
[1:19:54] again
[1:19:55] before many peoples and Nations and
[1:19:57] tongues and Kings
[1:19:59] amen amen amen and we know that when
[1:20:04] John here I also like this part of the
[1:20:07] scripture too when John said give me
[1:20:10] give me the little book amen we know
[1:20:13] that when we were looking at the
[1:20:16] prodigal son he did the same thing he
[1:20:19] said give me my inheritance amen and
[1:20:23] when the prodical said that you know we
[1:20:26] know that the father didn't say take it
[1:20:28] you know that's not what I'm want to
[1:20:30] highlight on what I'm saying is the
[1:20:31] boldness that was with knowing what's
[1:20:33] yours and you taking it amen that's what
[1:20:37] I want to highlight on Amen what I want
[1:20:39] to highlight on is that knowing that we
[1:20:42] were fashioned in Christ amen knowing
[1:20:45] the promises which are given unto us
[1:20:48] amen knowing that we were before the
[1:20:50] foundation of the Earth with Jesus
[1:20:53] Christ and we and we knock Satan Out of
[1:20:55] Heaven knowing that I want this is what
[1:20:59] I want to get to that knowing the will
[1:21:01] of God is
[1:21:02] knowing that and having the confidence
[1:21:05] to when something happens when Satan
[1:21:08] comes and and tries to challenge your
[1:21:10] faith and you say no but do you remember
[1:21:13] before the foundation of the world who I
[1:21:14] was and what I did amen that's that's
[1:21:17] what I want to get get get through to
[1:21:19] you amen amen and and also
[1:21:26] also that the the scriptures just like
[1:21:29] the song said only believe amen we know
[1:21:32] that it says that um in I believe it's a
[1:21:35] Matthew uh Matthew 45 I believe it is
[1:21:38] when it says it's how to deceive the
[1:21:40] very elect if it was possible amen see
[1:21:42] so knowing that and if you if you have a
[1:21:45] fear of say of say um oh am I one of
[1:21:48] those amen am am I uh am I actually U do
[1:21:53] I actually have have what I say I have
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:57] see God can't do anything with that God
[1:22:00] can't God cannot do anything God cannot
[1:22:03] do nothing with someone who can't take
[1:22:04] him at his word and believe it amen amen
[1:22:08] see God God can't do any nothing with
[1:22:11] anybody who every time something happens
[1:22:13] they fret and they and and and they
[1:22:15] falter and and they're they can't see
[1:22:19] because Satan's God's Army cannot have
[1:22:22] cowards amen see
[1:22:25] see we're supposed to have a boldness
[1:22:28] amen see we're supposed to believe in
[1:22:30] whom he sent amen and and and and if if
[1:22:35] if if we know that if we have that
[1:22:37] boldness then that's when if we have the
[1:22:39] mechanics God will come and bring the
[1:22:41] Dynamics amen if if we have the word and
[1:22:45] we're believing in the word in which in
[1:22:47] which he said that and we know that once
[1:22:50] once the word comes the spirit follows
[1:22:52] the word because the the word kill the
[1:22:54] Spirit giveth life you know that know
[1:22:56] that the spirit will come behind it and
[1:22:58] give life to it so that's that's what I
[1:23:01] want to get through amen that that's
[1:23:04] that's the thought I'm trying to get
[1:23:05] through to you amen amen amen and and
[1:23:11] um and to that's that's the thought
[1:23:14] that's the thought I I want I want to
[1:23:15] get through amen amen so um I want to I
[1:23:19] want to go back I want to go back to um
[1:23:23] Ezekiel no I'm sorry Isaiah 14 I want to
[1:23:27] go back to that amen Isaiah
[1:23:32] 14
[1:23:34] for let's not pick up let's let's pick
[1:23:36] up at
[1:23:41] 12
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:52] amen Isaiah 14
[1:23:55] 12 yes
[1:24:05] sir amen it reads it reads um how art
[1:24:09] thou fallen from Heaven on Lucifer son
[1:24:11] of the morning how art thou cut down to
[1:24:14] the ground which this weaken the Nations
[1:24:17] amen so Satan does not have spiritual
[1:24:21] Amnesia Satan knows what happened
[1:24:24] before the foundation of the earth we
[1:24:26] were the ones who had spiritual Amnesia
[1:24:29] amen and because we miss our theophanies
[1:24:32] amen Satan plays on that amen he he
[1:24:35] plays he plays on the fact that we may
[1:24:38] not uh uh um um um how how that um the
[1:24:43] man's thought of like how Jesus was be a
[1:24:46] high and mighty and and super humble and
[1:24:48] always doing the right thing at every
[1:24:50] given moment amen Satan plays on that
[1:24:52] see he plays on that natural
[1:24:54] amen but we know that but but we know
[1:24:58] that because we have a Divine record we
[1:25:00] know that because see and in this when
[1:25:05] when when our sins are toss and toce
[1:25:06] God's for forgetfulness we know that in
[1:25:09] the New Jerusalem that there's no water
[1:25:12] so on top of it being toss in the sea
[1:25:14] god forgetfulness that sea that sea of
[1:25:16] God forgetfulness is is gone after that
[1:25:19] too so so so
[1:25:22] so amen I don't know where that came
[1:25:24] from amen amen amen
[1:25:28] amen amen amen
[1:25:32] amen amen amen amen amen
[1:25:39] amen amen it says how art thou fallen
[1:25:41] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[1:25:43] morning yes sir how art thou cut down to
[1:25:45] the ground which is weaken the Nations
[1:25:47] for thou has said in thine heart I will
[1:25:49] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:25:52] throne above the stars of God
[1:25:54] amen see so he was looking at us too he
[1:25:57] wanted to be exalted above us as well he
[1:25:59] was jealous of us he he was jealous of
[1:26:03] what of of of the of the authority that
[1:26:05] we had he was jealous of the
[1:26:07] relationship we had with with Christ he
[1:26:09] was jealous of that amen amen amen so
[1:26:13] that's why he wanted that's why he
[1:26:14] wanted to be above us because remember
[1:26:16] Throne is is throne is the authority to
[1:26:18] rule amen so he wanted that Authority
[1:26:21] that we had but he wanted more on top of
[1:26:23] that amen and then and then he says I
[1:26:25] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:26:27] congregation see so he wanted to be that
[1:26:29] one brother that everybody knew of in
[1:26:31] the church amen amen uh in the Sid of
[1:26:33] the north I will Ascend above the
[1:26:35] heights of the clouds amen and I will be
[1:26:37] like the most high amen so this makes a
[1:26:40] lot of sense because right after right

[1:28:46] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:28:48] will to praise the glory of his grace
[1:28:51] where he hath made us accepted in the
[1:28:55] beloved in the Beloved amen so we know
[1:29:00] that the Beloved is the bride
[1:29:03] when when uh I believe he this this
[1:29:07] starts out with the Beloved when we're
[1:29:10] addressed to as a beloved that's not
[1:29:12] talking to anybody that's reading the
[1:29:14] Bible That's speaking to his elect bride
[1:29:17] that's reading the Bible amen amen that
[1:29:20] speaking to the ones that know who they
[1:29:23] are amen amen and it says it says in
[1:29:27] whom we have Redemption through his
[1:29:29] blood amen because the lamb was the only
[1:29:31] one that could take the book amen for
[1:29:34] the Forgiveness of sins amen according

[1:30:00] of times he may gather together in one
[1:30:02] all things in Christ amen both which are
[1:30:05] in heaven amen and which are on earth
[1:30:07] even in him in whom also we have

[1:30:13] that that's that uh uh that's that
[1:30:16] prodical son he obtain his inheritance
[1:30:19] amen and and once you obtain your
[1:30:22] inheritance you see um I lik how the
[1:30:24] Lord had Brothers even say there was a
[1:30:26] power in asking amen and we know ask you

[1:30:34] you shall find and knock and it shall be
[1:30:36] open amen amen and and the and that's
[1:30:38] what Jesus said he he said it and then
[1:30:40] he gave the acronym for it amen amen of
[1:30:42] what asking means what prayer is amen
[1:30:45] amen so so and we know that there's a
[1:30:47] power in that and we know that when
[1:30:50] we're praying to when we're praying to
[1:30:52] God we're not praying in a in a old
[1:30:56] higher higher the now sense of prayer
[1:30:58] amen we're praying in a sense of a son
[1:31:00] talking to his father amen of a daughter
[1:31:03] talking to their father amen because we
[1:31:05] know the relationship relationship we
[1:31:06] have with Christ because because of uh
[1:31:09] of of of of of of his of his grace amen
[1:31:12] and now uh it reads continues it
[1:31:14] continues to read it says that we should
[1:31:16] be to the praise of his glory who first
[1:31:19] trusted in Christ and whom he also
[1:31:21] trusted after whom he also trusted after

[1:31:48] of his glory amen amen amen amen now I
[1:31:53] want to read this also uh uh this Queen
[1:31:55] of Sheba it reads well if the Holy
[1:31:58] Spirit done that in the book of Acts
[1:32:00] it'll do the same thing today because
[1:32:03] the book of Acts is not the Acts of the
[1:32:05] Apostles it's the acts of the holy
[1:32:07] spirit in the apostles amen amen it's
[1:32:10] supposed to be the act of of the holy
[1:32:12] spirit in US amen and it's the same Holy

[1:32:17] yesterday today and forever amen amen
[1:32:20] it's it's it's the same Holy Spirit in
[1:32:21] the church today it will act the same
[1:32:23] way and give the same results why accept
[1:32:26] a substitute when the skies are full of
[1:32:28] the real real Pentecostal power amen we
[1:32:31] don't have a substitute we have we we
[1:32:34] don't have to have a substitute we can
[1:32:37] have the real amen I know it's the truth
[1:32:39] my brother my sister it's true it's true
[1:32:41] now the acts of the holy spirit amen see
[1:32:44] why why not what why not when um um when
[1:32:49] you want to debate within yourself
[1:32:50] whether you're um the elected or not
[1:32:54] why not just believe that you are amen
[1:32:58] because because I would rather believe
[1:33:01] that I'm the elect amen and and and

[1:33:06] rather I would
[1:33:08] rather um believe I'm the elect fulfill

[1:33:49] expression of God when Jesus was on the
[1:33:52] scene see cuz Jesus was the expression
[1:33:55] of God he was the example he was the
[1:33:58] example expression that's why he said he
[1:33:59] was a brother a little higher than the
[1:34:01] other brothers amen he was he was the
[1:34:03] big fellow amen see because he was the
[1:34:05] example of this is this is see that's
[1:34:08] why in on the six day he rested amen
[1:34:11] because his plan was that we would we
[1:34:14] would have dominion and we would and we

[1:34:23] more because he knows who he left on
[1:34:25] Earth amen he he left part of himself on
[1:34:28] Earth he left God on Earth amen but when
[1:34:30] we we forfeited that that that's why
[1:34:33] we're in the predicament we're in now
[1:34:34] we're trying to get back to that amen

[1:34:43] we want to get back to that and to get
[1:34:46] back to that is we have to we have to

[1:41:19] born
[1:41:23] you kept God single for a long
[1:41:26] time and it was not good for God to be

[1:41:38] single the second Adam remains single
[1:41:42] and as he was not good for the first

[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:51] alone are we together together oh glory
[1:41:55] to God are we together I'm just
[1:41:58] refueling on the air brother brother
[1:42:00] John let's go he say according as he has
[1:42:03] chosen us where
[1:42:06] when before the foundation of the water
[1:42:10] in other words you were chosen before
[1:42:12] your natural
[1:42:14] record God chose you before you
[1:42:17] existed God chose you before you
[1:42:20] lied God chose you before you
[1:42:24] still God chose you before you commit a
[1:42:28] crime when you were blameless God chose
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:36] you are we together are we together the
[1:42:39] Bible say he chose you when before the
[1:42:42] foundation of what that we should be
[1:42:46] how God chose you to be holy God wants
[1:42:50] you to be how holy
[1:42:53] holy let me ask you a question God chose
[1:42:57] you where in Christ how is Christ is
[1:43:00] Christ holy or not holy H how can God
[1:43:04] chose you in Christ to be holy when you
[1:43:07] are already
[1:43:10] holy are we together Christ is Holy
[1:43:15] because that's what the Bible says amen
[1:43:17] it's spoken in the book of Peter if I'm
[1:43:19] not mistaken the Bible said that we
[1:43:21] should be how holy and without what
[1:43:25] blame without what blame we should be
[1:43:30] blameless amen God chose you to be
[1:43:36] holy and to be without blame he did this
[1:43:41] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:43:45] amen you cannot choose somebody who's
[1:43:47] already Without Blame to be without
[1:43:50] blame
[1:43:53] means that person will have
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:58] blame if God want you to be without
[1:44:01] blame it's saying that you will have
[1:44:04] blame that's the reason why he want you
[1:44:07] without blame in other word God knew
[1:44:10] that when you come in this world you
[1:44:12] will get
[1:44:14] dirty that's why he prepare a plan to
[1:44:18] redeem you back again to his
[1:44:22] holiness so your trouble your record
[1:44:24] doesn't impress
[1:44:26] God God already knew what you're going
[1:44:28] to do that's why he chose Jacob knowing
[1:44:31] that Jacob is going to be a
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:38] supplanter are we together are we
[1:44:41] together are we together why do you say
[1:44:44] that I want you not to
[1:44:46] fall so you already have fall in your
[1:44:48] mind God knew something is going to
[1:44:50] happen but beside that because of of
[1:44:53] that God already chose you amen the
[1:44:56] bible say that according as he has chose
[1:44:58] us where in him before what the
[1:45:02] foundation of the world that we should
[1:45:04] be how and Without Blame before who how
[1:45:10] the title of this sermon tonight is the
[1:45:14] manifestation is the
[1:45:17] manifestation amen amen of his what
[1:45:22] three threefold
[1:45:24] purpose are we together we know that the
[1:45:27] three-fold purpose of God was expressed
[1:45:30] first in Jesus Christ where Christ get
[1:45:34] the preeminence because he's our example
[1:45:38] amen he's the standard product and God
[1:45:42] have to start with him so that every
[1:45:44] other product that will be manufacture
[1:45:47] in this manufacturer must match the
[1:45:50] standard we cannot have something less
[1:45:53] than a standard everybody that come out
[1:45:56] must match the standard the formula of
[1:45:58] One Coca-Cola is not different than the
[1:46:00] second one if you test them they test
[1:46:03] together they test alike my Coca-Cola
[1:46:07] and Jesus Coca-Cola is still the same
[1:46:10] because we are God we came from the F
[1:46:13] from the same Source are we together the
[1:46:16] second purpose was for God to have
[1:46:18] preeminence where in the bread in you
[1:46:24] amen and the third one is to express to
[1:46:27] restore back Eden so that we can go back
[1:46:31] to the Millennium amen so to manifest
[1:46:34] means that something was first
[1:46:38] hidden something was first
[1:46:41] covered something was first
[1:46:44] unknown something was first
[1:46:47] ignoring and that thing need now to be
[1:46:51] displayed you were ignore you were
[1:46:54] hidden you were buried in your first
[1:46:56] nature and they thought you were bad in
[1:46:59] your family but you had another record
[1:47:02] and because of the record it is time
[1:47:05] that the Son of God be manifested again
[1:47:08] so that Christ can have a preeminence in
[1:47:11] you are we together are we together
[1:47:15] let's go to the Book of Romans chapter
[1:47:19] 8 glory to God
[1:47:23] glory to God the book of Romans chapter
[1:47:26] 8 if you thereare you can say Amen I'm

[1:47:34] and then begin to come back again are we
[1:47:36] together Roman 8 chapter 29 if you dare
[1:47:39] you can say Amen the bible say that for
[1:47:43] whom he did what for none he also did
[1:47:47] what to be
[1:47:49] what conformed to the image of what
[1:47:54] if you want somebody let their on in the
[1:47:56] future to be conformed to the image of
[1:47:59] Christ it mean that person will not come
[1:48:01] out in the image of
[1:48:05] Christ that person will first come in a
[1:48:07] different image and then you going to
[1:48:11] take make that person to be conformed to
[1:48:14] the image you wanted to are we together
[1:48:18] because we got two parent we got our
[1:48:21] natural parent
[1:48:23] and a spiritual parent and a spiritual
[1:48:26] parent knew that he want you to be like
[1:48:28] him so he predestinated you to be
[1:48:32] conformed to His Image but when we are
[1:48:35] born we are conformed into the image of
[1:48:37] our parent we looks like our parent we
[1:48:41] looks like Daddy and Mommy but in you
[1:48:44] there are material that have been placed
[1:48:46] to make sure you can be in
[1:48:48] morth you can be changed you can be Tren
[1:48:53] from the kingdom of your family from the
[1:48:56] curses of your family from the glaucoma
[1:48:59] of your family to another family where
[1:49:02] we don't have gloma
[1:49:08] in are we together are we together God
[1:49:12] already wired you for that
[1:49:14] transformation for that translation he
[1:49:17] was done you were predestinated for then
[1:49:21] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:49:23] to be ConEd in the image of
[1:49:26] what his who so at the finished product
[1:49:31] you will look like
[1:49:34] who you will look like who you will look
[1:49:37] like his son he say at the image of his
[1:49:40] son that he might be the what the
[1:49:44] firstborn the standard product remember
[1:49:47] the beginning product the example amen
[1:49:50] that he might be the firstborn
[1:49:52] among only one brother among how many
[1:49:56] brother so Jesus is not the only PE on
[1:50:00] the
[1:50:02] beach say amen that's why we and Jesus
[1:50:06] will sit on the same
[1:50:09] throne and that Throne only one person
[1:50:12] sit right
[1:50:14] there so that's why the Bible say he
[1:50:17] will gather everything in heaven and on
[1:50:21] the earth into one
[1:50:23] on the earth It Is Us in the heaven it
[1:50:26] is him and all of us will gather
[1:50:29] together and become one and qualify for
[1:50:32] one person on one
[1:50:34] Throne that's why the Bible say One
[1:50:39] S the Oneness of God is different than
[1:50:43] the Oneness of man according to Man 1
[1:50:46] plus one equal 2 but according to God 1
[1:50:50] + 1 equal 1 so when they say one will
[1:50:53] sit it doesn't mean one person it means
[1:50:56] it's Christ and his
[1:50:58] PR Adam and AD and Eve back again on the
[1:51:03] scene are we together are we together
[1:51:07] let's go to now Roman 8 chapter 12 if
[1:51:11] you thereare you can say
[1:51:13] amen glory to God let's go to verse uh
[1:51:17] uh 19 actually the Bible say for the
[1:51:22] Earnest expectation of the what Waited
[1:51:26] For What the
[1:51:28] manifestation of the son son s o
[1:51:34] n the how many
[1:51:36] sons plural so this doesn't belong to
[1:51:40] Jesus Christ say Amen this scripture is
[1:51:44] not for Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:51:46] already manifested the Son of God
[1:51:50] because God who was the father Bec son
[1:51:53] in Jesus Christ Jesus already manifested
[1:51:56] the Son of God but this is no longer
[1:51:58] Jesus Christ he already finish his
[1:52:01] ministry but there are other sons of God
[1:52:04] that are not yet manifested
[1:52:07] yet amen so the manifestation is for you
[1:52:11] and
[1:52:12] me when we say son it doesn't mean women
[1:52:16] are not there because Eve was in Adam
[1:52:20] and God call Eve the same name as
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:27] Adam are we together are we together jop
[1:52:31] down to this next verse verse 20 for the
[1:52:34] creature was made what subject to vanity
[1:52:37] the creation not willingly amen the
[1:52:41] trees I mean did not do anything the the
[1:52:44] elephant didn't do anything he was men
[1:52:46] so because they were under men they
[1:52:49] automatically by default fell amen the
[1:52:52] Bible say not willingly but by reason of
[1:52:54] him that has what subject the same how
[1:52:58] in Hope because the creation itself also
[1:53:01] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:53:04] what corruption into the Glorious
[1:53:07] Liberty of what children of God now they
[1:53:10] don't call it the sons of God they call
[1:53:12] them the what children of God ye are God
[1:53:15] and all of you are children of the most
[1:53:17] high so God is expecting God to be on
[1:53:20] display
[1:53:25] a child of God is a
[1:53:28] God and a child of God means equal with
[1:53:33] god
[1:53:35] oh don't worry it makes the devil angry
[1:53:38] when you say me and my father we are
[1:53:41] one tell him I was chosen in my father

[1:59:15] amen the devil attack with A continuous
[1:59:18] stroke let's look at this stroke let's

[1:59:47] say amen amen moreover the light of the
[1:59:51] Moon which is is the church shall be as
[1:59:54] the light of what so the light of this
[1:59:57] Moon won't be lesser than the
[2:00:01] son say Amen because you trying to think
[2:00:04] you are lower than Jesus
[2:00:07] Christ I already preach and I'm going to
[2:00:10] push this again harder amen the bible
[2:00:13] say that the light the intensity of the
[2:00:17] sun will be equal to the light of what
[2:00:21] will be equal to the light of what amen
[2:00:25] amen amen okay if this light is 1,000
[2:00:29] kilow what do you expect the moon to
[2:00:33] be what do you expect the moon to
[2:00:36] be 1,000 kilowatt so if you look at the
[2:00:40] Sun and you look at the Moon which one
[2:00:42] is
[2:00:44] sun which one is sun which one is Moon
[2:00:48] because both of them look alike
[2:00:52] so the moon will be exactly like the sun
[2:00:55] that's why the sun can be
[2:00:58] out the sun can be resting on the
[2:01:02] seventh day and there is a moon that
[2:01:06] will be a sun on the
[2:01:10] Earth are we together are we together
[2:01:14] are we together so what we are trying
[2:01:17] this manifestation of these sons of God
[2:01:20] are going to be exact L
[2:01:26] Crist that's why they ask you to swallow
[2:01:29] the book because the book is
[2:01:35] Christ are we together are we
[2:01:40] together glory to God let's go back my
[2:01:43] friend and the light of the Sun the moon
[2:01:46] shall be as the light of what Hallelujah
[2:01:50] okay the light of this Moon moon is
[2:01:53] exactly like the sun it means other
[2:01:55] moons have different
[2:01:58] light the Moon that were previous to
[2:02:01] this moon were different from their
[2:02:09] Sun Church all right let me just pick up
[2:02:12] how many moons do you want me to pick
[2:02:15] let me p i mean pick seven there is a
[2:02:18] first moon a second one a third a fourth
[2:02:20] a fifth uh I mean a six and a seven amen
[2:02:24] all these moons have light but you can
[2:02:28] tell the difference between the lights
[2:02:30] and the light of the
[2:02:33] Sun but there is a moon that when you
[2:02:37] look at that Moon you get confused
[2:02:39] between the Sun and the Moon you can
[2:02:42] swap one to the other and you still have
[2:02:45] the same
[2:02:49] effect are we together there
[2:02:54] amen verse 26 moreover the light of the
[2:02:57] moon shall be as the light of what and
[2:03:01] the light of the Sun that sun shall be
[2:03:07] how this light this light of the sun
[2:03:12] amen that will look like the Moon is
[2:03:16] Sevenfold it's the intensity of
[2:03:20] Sevenfold so the Moon is also
[2:03:26] Sevenfold amen it's one moon but
[2:03:31] Sevenfold are we together are we
[2:03:34] together so if you got one fold you
[2:03:36] cannot reach that Moon if you got the
[2:03:38] second fold you cannot reach that Moon
[2:03:41] you need seven
[2:03:43] lights seven lights to make that sun and
[2:03:47] an angel in the Bible appears as a light
[2:03:52] are we together and we have a picture
[2:03:55] right here amen that was made by seven
[2:03:59] angels it was seven lights that were put
[2:04:02] together and he produces the image of
[2:04:06] Christ so the light of this Moon must be
[2:04:09] the last of the
[2:04:14] constellation the constellation was made
[2:04:17] out of seven angels seven lights and
[2:04:20] when the seven lights were made together
[2:04:22] he produces Christ it is a Christ with
[2:04:26] seven lights the Christ with seven
[2:04:29] lights will produce a bride with seven
[2:04:33] lights are we together this light never
[2:04:36] came in Paul time never came in arus
[2:04:39] time never came in colba time it came
[2:04:43] only in laisha time at the end time when
[2:04:47] it promised to the Overcomer to sit on
[2:04:49] the throne of God so if a light if a sun
[2:04:53] is coming as a constellation of seven
[2:04:56] light they got to be a
[2:04:58] moon they got to be a moon that will
[2:05:01] look like that light so that the head
[2:05:04] and the body can be United
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:11] together are we together our flight
[2:05:15] attendant prepare for landing my friend
[2:05:17] the Bible says moreover the light of the
[2:05:20] moon shall be as the light of the sun
[2:05:23] and the light of the sun shall be how
[2:05:24] many fold seven f as the light of how
[2:05:27] many days seven days so how many days do
[2:05:30] we have and every day we had a
[2:05:34] moon am can you say Amen there were
[2:05:38] seven days with seven moons amen so the
[2:05:43] moon of the first day the second the
[2:05:45] third by the last moon will have the the
[2:05:48] intensity of the light of all of them in
[2:05:51] other word the last day will gather all
[2:05:55] the light of the other
[2:05:57] [Applause]
[2:06:01] ages are we together are we together the
[2:06:05] Bible say as the light of seven days in
[2:06:08] the
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] day that the Lord there is a day that
[2:06:14] the Lord will do
[2:06:16] what up B up what the bridge of
[2:06:22] what B so there was a bridge somewhere
[2:06:25] there that's why before the seals we
[2:06:28] have to preach the bridge between the
[2:06:31] seven Church ages and the Seven seal
[2:06:34] because somebody need to bind the
[2:06:42] bridge amen amen are we together are we
[2:06:48] together the Lord the Bible say and the
[2:06:50] Lord shall B the breach of his people
[2:06:53] come out and
[2:06:55] what heal
[2:06:57] what heal what the stroke of what the
[2:07:02] devil is pH on continuous stroke but

[2:07:31] it's depression come to the message if
[2:07:34] it's trouble in the marriage come to the
[2:07:36] message if it's the intimate life in the

[2:07:42] devil answer because this message is
[2:07:45] sent to heal the stroke of the devil he

[2:07:52] great physician on our side every time
