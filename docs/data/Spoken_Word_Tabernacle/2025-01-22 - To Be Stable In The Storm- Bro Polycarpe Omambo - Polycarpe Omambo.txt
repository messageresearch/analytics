are just as religious with those sacraments as they could be but God said they stink in my nose see there was no sincerity there was nothing to it that should be you've got to come upon basical promise and then upon your mental attitude towards you look at those uh 400 priests that day are prophets Ahab had out there they said ramoth Gilead belongs to us Joshua by the Holy Spirit divided this and the syrians has got it and one Prophet said now look here that's fundamentally right now he was a real Baptist and he said that's exactly right that's the fundamental prop promise that land

with cystic fibrosis uh what I don't know if everybody knows what that is but it attacks the lungs fluid builds up it gets real thick and I remember they used to have to have a vest put on him to keep vibrating to keep everything loose well I was talking to this brother I ran into him in town last week and we were talking and I asked him how his son was doing who is now 14 years old and he said he's doing great and when he told me this I just I said isn't that just like the Lord to shove this in the devil's face of all the instruments this brother could play he is playing the bag pipe yeah and I'm thinking what would drive him to play a bagpipe of all things you know yeah I said take that devil you know so yeah and I also got a prayer request uh my mechanic who has been very good to us over the years uh I was over there yesterday day and he was telling me about his wife who she's only in her 40s um they're they're saying she needs a valve replaced in her heart and he was telling me if they do that they're going to split her open cut her heart open and go in there and do all this stuff I told I said she don't need all that well today I I dropped my truck off over there and for the first time in a very long time uh she was coming out of the driveway I was going over the car to get in the car with my wife and here she come so I was talking to her and I I told her I said we're

as you are standing I want to use this to read something l in the Book of Luke chapter 8 we're going to start from verse 22 to verse 26 we will read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples he said unto them let us go on to the other side of the lake and they launch forth but as they sailed he fell [Music] asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in Jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and Reb and rebuked the wind and the Raging Water and They seized and the was C [Music] come and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey [Music] him and they arrived at the country of the Gans which is over against Galilee may the Lord God bless the reading of his word Lord Heavenly Father Of Heaven and Earth before you this evening knowing that before you there is life there solution you're the master that's why we come this evening so you may speak to us so you may assist us so you may fortify us maybe there's someone who find who find themselves find themselves are in need of you and in need of you there's someone in the boat and the boat is trapped by the wind and they're scared and they need of you it's this time here we see ourselves have nothing to bring to your people we all waiting upon you bringing to your so you so you may f for you always served your from nothing to make something truly we are empty we waiting on you this evening there's someone that's empty I don't know if it's in or those that are online if someone is Si he receive their if someone is in trouble you're the solution we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated my message for this evening to be stable in the storm to be stable in the stor tell your tell your neighbor that Jesus is in the boat you will notice where we read Jesus was in the the boat and when he was in the boat he was sleeping if Jesus was sleeping that also says that Peter was also tired Jesus was doing sleeping meaning the disciples were also tired why was Jesus sleeping because they were taking a long journey he told them let's go to the other side and from the other side there was a fool Not only was this man a fool but he was also a pagan a heathen but as you already know Jesus had already started with the Jew and then to the nation who are us the bride and Jesus was with the Jew he was with the Believers but now he had to go look for the Heathen this fool that's why he said let us go to the other side amen amen and then Jesus was tired says you already know the storm the storm storms or events that happens when someone is tired when the enemy is approaching when the enemy wants to attack you the enemy won't attack you when you have strength it's only when you're tired it's the time the darkest time of your life that the enemy will come to combat you and that's what happened Jesus was sleeping he was with his disciples and then water got into the boat now the disciples weren't scared of the water but now when the wind starts to blow the storm that's when they start being scared and Peter said we cannot perish I have to wake up the master amen they said master master we're perish waking him up he was menacing the wind and the waters that were calm and the return and then he told them where is your faith you will notice here Jesus Christ he spoke to the wind he spoke to the and now he's also speaking to Peter he said what did Peter do Jesus I'm asking Jesus what did Peter do because you said to pray non nonstop now Peter was in prayer what he did was simply to wake you up and Jesus reproached him what did Jesus reproach Peter because Peter had ignored the presence of Jesus Jesus said let's go to the other side just like you this evening I don't know what Jesus had told you [Music] maybe he promised you a job maybe he promised you education maybe he promised you a wedding when he promises you it's all the way to the end amen amen and Jesus is not in the detail when he tells you something he's not into the details amen amen that's what Jesus had told them let's go to the other side he did not say that there will be storm or or wind amen amen and Peter had forgotten the power of the presence of Jesus [Music] Christ Peter was in the middle of the performance of Christ if Peter had recognized the power of His presence he would don't realize there's no way that Jesus could have drowned because Jesus had said this I came here so you may have life and life in abundance and now you're in front of him and you have fear for death but his word was before that I came to give you life and this life in abundance then you have to believe in that and Jesus and Peter had fear and it the fact that Jesus is with you it's a sign that you will go through a trial a living and Jesus was in the boat and Peter had forgotten that Jesus was the responsible but he came over here as someone that's that's panicking Jesus God wanted that Peter to learn to be stable God wanted Peter to learn to be stable in front of situations FR of amen amen Satan cannot do anything even to take your life you know what Satan does he will create something in you so you may have fear that way from your own mouth you may destroy yourself from your own mouth so you may confess from your own mouth amen amen may God be praised why abandon when there's frustration you should never abandon because God gave you power so you should never give up may God be praised the problem is a lot of things starts out good calmly you may start a fiance calmly you may start a marriage and you're marrying them and start out calmly peacefully you may start enter calmly peacefully there's no problem you may start your education calmly with there's no problem you can have a child a baby calmly this child is pretty it's very cute there's no makeup when she start going to school you bring her to the bus stop you're putting everything that she's in need of but when she's going to go to school in the midst of the school in the midst of life that storm will come and that's when the problem but in the beginning you married someone after you're in the marriage and that there's absolutely nothing then all of a sudden a storm comes and that's the problem and Jesus said this evening Jesus says this in when this storm comes you have to be stable Don't Panic the master is there don't panic the disciples in the river in the lakes in the waters with Jesus were started out calmly Jesus gave one order saying let's go to the other side but Jesus doesn't carry himself in little details Jesus said let's go to the other side and along the way there will be stuff that will come it will it's not the problems that will start it will not be the situation depart the departure that will bring fear or worriness usually stuff when they start they start out calmly they start very good like I said earlier that the Enterprise may have started out easily calmly your education has started out very well but in the middle the storm will come amen amen it's certain things that will happen in the middle there are stuff that that troubles there are stuff that comes in the middle will defy your capability to be stable to be stable we don't choose the storm to face none of y'all to tonight have chosen your stor Peter in the boat did not choose the storm he didn't even vote for the storm so I don't know if you had voted for the storm me in my in my life I did not vote for any storm I don't know if someone here voted for a storm in their life now since you did not vote for the storm you have to be calm the master is in the boat this evening the master is in the boat the master is in the boat may God be praised know that every storm that has hit the um Earth the planet the storms that have hit the planets they caused destructions enen you see some of them that will be called Helen zo zoo they have many names they caused a lot of problems they destroyed a lot of homes they have killed a lot of people even animals and trees but you have to know they ended by coming they ended by passing that mean doesn't matter this storm God is capable God is with you no matter the the um the fierceness of the storm amen amen may God be praised how many times in your life how many times in your life have you gone through a storm you thought you would have died in that situation but today you're alive the same God is here tonight he will not leave you alone he will not abandon you you have to know that the tempet that the storm will come to

windows of Heaven were open now look at the provision of God from the deep God opened the water water comes here water comes from Heaven to flood the Earth to tell you that God has Reserve everywhere from from places that you not expect maybe you're waiting for a fiance here but he will be somewhere else maybe you're waiting for something just here but he know how he will do it he know how he will bring it to pass because he has reserves he's capable of everything but the problem to you is you should not you know that a lot of people we have uncertainty amen amen when it comes to living we live the same traumatize traumas from the same condition but what I want you to understand from ourself we cannot draw anything amen amen amen amen we cannot draw strength from ourselves we cannot draw the goodness from from ourselves we cannot draw you cannot draw it from around yourself amen amen may God be worshiped you have to you have to draw it from yourself amen amen you have to go to the opposition you should not find strength from someone that's beside you amen amen we'll see it very soon may God be worshiped you need to have water in your soul you remember in John chapter 4 verse 1 to9 it speaks about the Samaritan woman the woman that well was with Jesus and you know the story when Jesus was talking to her when Jesus was talking to her when Jesus was talking to her and what had happened was she did not draw water from somewhere else because Jesus had said if you believe in me there will be rivers of flowing [Music] water what rivers will not come out of your house or from your neighborhood no neither from your community neither from your surrounding but from within you from within you meaning you have to arrive at that level if you believe like how the Bible says rivers of water rivers of water will flow in your belly not from your house not from your surrounding but from within you may God be worshiped but from your very essence the soul of human the human soul will become a rock may God be worshiped The Rock had nothing special listen our Rock he had nothing special The Rock has nothing special but God who is the Living Water who was flowing through the rock it's like here in this church we have our pastor there's nothing special in our pastor but God who is the Living Water who enters into the pastor and when he's standing there's Mysteries one verse can be preached from months and months a source that a source an unlimited Source because there's a source inside there because that Source inside there you cannot um pull it from your neighborhood like I said because it's within you may God be worshiped there's nothing special in the Rock it's water it's God who was the living water in the um in the Rock I will read a bit of the Prophet to see something here in 1960 Elijah and offering paragraph 34 God sent him up on the mountain and said go and tell th old Wicked King the lord it's not going to rain or even do will fall until you call until you call fre give it unto into Elijah's mouth to call for the rain when he when it was time but he but he had the keys of heaven he could close it or open it he said I want you to go up out of the Wilderness of this into the Wilderness you see it's God who has sent him to go into the Wilderness you find yourself in the wilderness you find yourself in in the storm and you're trying to find a solution yourself but look at the person who put you in that situation stop trying to find the solution by yourself God has sent him to the mountain he said get out from among them you you've preached to them and they won't listen to [Music] you and they continually getting worse go on up into the Wilderness and they set down by the rock CH and Al already commanded the Ravens to take care of you amen now look at the provision of God in the mountain and he's commanding the the Ravens because usually You're Expecting oh it's Pastor Steven who will bless me you're blocking yourself you're looking at someone you're saying it's him who will bless me God has a provision in places that are unexpected look at how he's nurturing feeding through the Ravens who made food it was God himself and the crosss came to him gave it to him I want to read something else in in the prophet I can jump certain things okay [Music] continue God can do what he wants to he said I've commanded the Ravens and they're going to feed you and they brought him flesh and bread you see it wasn't a restaurant day someone said one time where did they get it brother brandham 39 paragraph 39 I said I don't know the only thing that I know they brought it they brought it they got it from the same place that Jesus brought it they got it from the same place that Jesus did when he took five five fish five biscuit and two fish and fed 5,000 it come from the same creative hand of God Almighty they brought him fish and [Music] bread the crow sat down and hand it over to Elijah and he ate it and stooped down and drank from the fountain God was resting his Prophet oh I'm so glad that God has a way of escape and when they thought he was crazy that old prophet and old kill Joy [Music] always trying to take the joy out of their of their little happy parties they were having telling them that there telling them that it was sin and God dot dot dot [Music] [Music] him following God's commission went into the mountains and sat down on the high place the drest place in the [Music] country but God kept the Brook running and they were down there knowing their their tongue for water look how God his servant or you somewhere over there in a dry place and God is capable he has resources everywhere he can bless you he can do everything for you he is capable we will jump something in paragraph 42 the prophet says this you know there we could get a lesson from that that if you have prayed and met all the requirements that God requires you to and he and still he silent he doesn't say anything and yet you've met the requirements now what happens then if you know that you have met his requirements and you've done all that you know to do then Faith doesn't waver it just sits still and thinks positive Faith takes Everlasting grip around the Rock of Ages and doesn't [Music] move that great fellow called Faith I've often said Faith got hair on the chest when he speaks everything else shuts up when faith says shut up then everything stops because he's the [Music] [Applause] boss and she had met every requirement she had lived clean she had lived she lived honorably and she had met all of God's requirements but look like he was silent God does that sometimes to T to see what kind of reaction you'll have don't forget it that's how God had put job in Trials amen amen he had po job in child he offered sacrifices for his children for those that are prophets it was a holocaust but it was everything that God had asked he ped job to see what of reaction he will see from Jo maybe God can give you a husband or a wife or children or something and then something happens you start thinking maybe it's this is this man this husband this wife that doesn't have a head maybe this person when they were engaged with you they didn't have their mind they didn't have a head meaning he put job into trials to see his reaction he would find in him but when he took his sheep and took his ox and took his camels and took his children I'll see what job says now now listen to the answer and he said the lord gave and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord God be praised will come down a bit to close as you know Jesus Hado reproached Peter because in Luke chapter 10 verse 19 Jesus had said I will give you power I have given you power to walk upon the and Scorpion and and all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall and nothing shall by any means hurt you Propet now the prophet said why was the Holy Spirit given in paragraph 55 he says this he gave them the power against unclean spirits God had given you power over sin any type of abomination God had given you power against sin against failure against sickness against any type of situation when you find yourself in front of a storm why are you panicking just use the power just use the power refuse rebuke everything that you have to rebuke rebuke anything that the enemy May propose to [Music] [Applause] you and speak to existence anything that you can speak to existence because God said we're in the time like the pastor says here we're in the time where the Earth speaks and then the heaven executes he said everything that you will tie bound on Earth it's not the heavens that will bind it you're just circling around just because you're waiting for heaven to react for you you waiting for heaven to bind it for you when he already gave you the power he gave men the power that we are Gods he said that y are Gods why are you waiting for Heavens to bind it while you're waiting for heaven to open why Heaven is the one waiting for you it's saying what is this child why is this child does not know his position because we're ready to execute heav said we're ready to come down we're ready to come down we're waiting to come down because there's power and he said everything that you will bind without exceptions everything that you will bind the heavens will say amen and the prophet has said he had given them power against unclean spirits they went out he put their names in the Lamb's books of life and he sent them out John or Matthew 10 he gave them the power over unclean spirit [Music] it's where we read recently in Luke chapter 10 19 casting casting out evil spirits and do works and so forth and they came and they come back rejoicing said even the Devils is subject to us see God have given power and I will close God had given us power against our enemy he said our enemies will be our [Music] first why do we not want to use that power when we returning to say Genesis in the beginning you notice when Adam and Eve had fallen Jesus had came down God had came down and he started calling them he said where are you and they were hidden and they say we have sinned and he said who told you that you were naked he said who had told you that you were naked and look at something together with me in the Bible every tree when the man had sinned every tree had dried up every tree was dried up but there was a tree that had worked with men that had given men um leaves to cover themselves to make clothes it was a fake tree every other tree when man had sinned it was dried amen but are you understanding what I'm saying and in the New Testament when Jesus had came he saw the Fig Tree he saw the fig tree with the leaf it was a rematch amen amen God remembered that match that old match that you in the Garden of Eden when it was not the time to give clothes you you had provided clothes to my children now you shall give me fruit season or no season you will give me fruit and the Bible says it was not even the time of the of the season of figs and the Fig Tree had ignored that Jesus is the season that that a season is a person where there is the sun that's where the fruits are that's why Peter had fish all night he thought probably it was a different season a different period but it was not the period but when the person who's called season has stepped in has said throw cast out your cast out your net and he caught fish and now we're returning to the Fig and Jesus had said you in a time before we could have given man clothes you had provided them clothes now I shall curse you that's why he had cursed the Fig there was not another tree that Jesus had cursed it was only the fake tree that he had cursed because the fake tree had perit himself to serve man while every other tree was dried up and when Jesus had came he said to his disciples you had seen when he was giving recommendation how the world has treated me I am the tree and y'all are dried up tree you have to very be paying attention you have to be careful wherever you will be him who was the Green Tree he came to save to save us who are dried up trees that's why what he had carried it was just not it wasn't it wasn't a ready tree it was a dried up tree you will notice on the cross he was he was put up on a dried tree because he came to die for us we were dried when it pierced his side blood had came out that blood that came out it touched the wooden the dried wood it touched the cross I was looking for if we had a cross and then the blood of Jesus Christ it was dried up in the wood it was dried up from his body they had separated him from the wood they buried him three days on the third day on the third day he resurrected that me the life that was out of Jesus it was it came back that blood that was also in the tree is also what gives us life also in his resurrection that's why we have life that we also have victory that mean also this evening we also have Victory we also have power in every aspect of our life in every situation in every problem that we have we have power it's up to us to speak the word because the heaven is for us what we shall speak what we shall bind I don't know about you but but doesn't matter the storm that you're going through the master is in the boat just speak the word and you shall see what the Lord may God richly bless you hallelujah hallelujah may God be blessed may God be blessed Pastor praise God Amen wonderful thank you thank you amen amen amen amen amen amen wonderful my brother God bless you praise God Amen let's give the Lord a big clap amen amen amen do you think I can take a r from translating so finally I'm [Laughter] free because when Brother P the C preach it's like I have to preach but now it it seems like for the first time he did very very very well and if he do it over and over and over then he's going to be a PhD so congratulation my friend amen the Fig Tree provided the clothing when it was not time for the clothing and God asked the Fig Tree to provide fruit when it was not time for the fruit amen time or not you need to provide it because he was the season amen amen when you do everything and you can't catch anything he's still That season That season that can create the fishes amen amen when men fell nature fell amen but the trees were still trees amen there were still trees they were still alive but it was a chaos that enter into hidden but what you want to understand God rebuked the wind he rebuked the water and he also rebuked his disciple and the reason why he rebuked them because he already gave them power before Amen to master all circumstances so while he was resting they should have taking things in charge they should be in charge and say you know what he's sleeping let leave the Lord sleep let's handle this storm ourselves amen amen amen and do you know the good thing about God do you know the good thing about God he knows us very well he knows that when I'm they will come and poke me and they will come and wake me up when brother Bram is around everybody will travel to [Applause] Jeffersonville you didn't get that one if brother Bram remain alive every day we will have a prayer line in Jeffersonville everybody trying to even touch him people will come all over the world trying to see brother brandham God say I know what to do he takes brother Bram out he takes Jesus Christ out so now you can be in charg now you can look at within yourself and look at the source that is in you and draw word from yourself to handle the situation because God have confidence in you amen amen glory to God it's like a child who's uh who's learning how to drive he always depend on an another driver to be there but one of these day you're going to drive yourself right and guess what the more you drive yourself the more you become better and the more you learn things that no one will teach you but experience will begin to teach you and it won't be Daddy around it won't be mommy around you will be yourself on the highway and before you know it if you were too scared after while fear begin to remove begin to go now you begin to have confidence you begin to pick up the cell phone and you can talk while you driving and the beginning you were like this after a while you begin to relax after a while you begin to relax after a while you begin to relax after a while you begin to do this some will begin to do this that's what God is expecting from you at the beginning you were trembling but now when the situation come in your life you don't panic you are stable you know how to handle it you say I seen it before because it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God bless you my brother glory to God you
