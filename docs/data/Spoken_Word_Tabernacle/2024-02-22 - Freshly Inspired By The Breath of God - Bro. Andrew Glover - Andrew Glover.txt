and stay away from the sport arena Amen brother BR me and say that when he was going to those Arena to have uh uh meetings and things he have to fight a certain way compared to the church because he say Spirit stays there he said that's why when you go to church it's h the Angel that's staying there and the way he break through in the church is different than if they use a big stadium so if the prophet himself self preaching have to fight through just the the uh I mean the the spirit in the building of the stadium how much more that is coming in through television amen we are not wrestler my friend you cannot sit down and watch wrestling yeah it's somebody with an hand were fighting it is no different than somebody at the beach so don't tell me your Holy Ghost is sitting there and say

the pillar of fire and come to church and say I love Jesus Christ so much this is the color of the pillar of fire but people do that in sport I'm not saying for you to do it I'm just showing you the

Grace father we thank you for the warm feeling that we feel in this building tonight Lord knowing that we're not gathered here under confusion or under man's ideas but Lord Jesus we have gathered here under the Vindicated word of this hour in which we are living and Lord we believe that you're not in a grave we don't believe that you're buried in some tomb somewhere but father we believe you're the living Living God we do not believe your wood or stone but Lord we believe Lord that you're Supernatural and we believe that when you begin to move things begin to change father we're inviting you to come in this service tonight I feel your presence is already here Lord as the Believers have endeavored Lord by the gifts and talents and abilities that you've given unto them Lord to create an atmosphere in this building that your word could find Lord uh right away in the hearts of your children we pray that you would be pleased oh god with the atmosphere that's been created and father we pray now as we Endeavor to look into your word may you send the spirit of wisdom Revelation into the building oh God and Father may you take the hands of Satan off of your children Lord may you take the spirits of the evil one the influences of the age may you rip the grip away from him oh God and Lord may you take your blood and may you remove every stain from our hearts and from our lives oh God lord may we leave here with a greater appreciation a stronger determination to serve you Lord and to walk in your ways and to acknowledge you in all of our ways father and Lord we commit this meeting in th faithful hands have your way among us tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen St John chapter 20 and verse 18 the Bible says Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things un to her then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for Fears of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst amen now I love that came Jesus and stood in the midst yes sir we said like this came the word and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you that's right and when he had said and he when he had so said he showed un them his hands in his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord yes sir then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you amen and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost In other words he breathes on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost now watch right after after he breathes on them and they receive the Holy Ghost he says now whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sends you retain they are retained so when he breathed upon them he breathed Authority into them we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen I want tonight if I could to share with you a few things here and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on freshly inspired by the Breath of God freshly inspired by the Breath of God you know I believe if there ever was a time that we could use a refreshing amen I believe we could use it right now amen I believe we could use a refreshing in our homes we could use a refreshing in our churches we could use a refreshing in our families amen I believe if we ever could use a refreshing from the presence of the Lord we could use it right now now when you think of this word fresh the definition of fresh it is having its original qualities unimpaired amen it is full of or renewed in Vigor it is not stale not sour or decayed it is not faded nor altered by processing so when something is fresh it is still carrying the same qualities that it had in the beginning no matter how long it has been in existence so amen like you go to the store and you you purchase some meat amen when you go buy that meat you're not looking to buy something that's processed and then because when it's processed you know it loses qualities it loses uh certain things that it had in the beginning now here the prophet of God speaking to us in 1956 in a message hear ye him from Matthew 17 when he's speaking on Jesus on the mount Transfiguration I normally don't read this much to lay a foundation but I want to tonight if that's okay he said now you know God's word is so Eternal it's just inspired it's not just for one occasion or for one generation he said the word of God is so Eternal it's the same and it's the truth amen the word of God is eternal the word of God is the same and the word of God is the truth he said this same word inspired the disciples it inspired the first world of disciples and then the next is they follow down to the Lutheran age through the Methodist age and every age and is just as sufficient and inspiring today to us amen as it was the first day that it was given he said now watch if the world should stand a million years the word would still be just as inspired to the generations that will follow as it is to us because it's perfect amen and it's always given for the time amen so let me let me break in and say this we are not feeding tonight amen on processed word we are we are not feeding on the hybrid word amen but we are feeding on word that is still packing its original qualities but it was packing in the beginning amen so in other words the same thing that was in the word in the beginning in the alpha amen will be in the word in the Omega in the ending now one great way we could approach it he says is this afternoon that's the coming of the Lord he said see first Moses then Elijah then Jesus he said then we noticed that Peter while he was there amen he had just been freshly inspired amen because he had just give a witness to who Jesus was amen and he was inspired now think about this amen you have the old test amen and you have Jesus and you have Peter of the New Testament amen and they're all on the same Mountain amen but there's not one less bit of inspiration amen that Peter isn't enjoying as Moses or Elijah enjoyed in the Old Testament amen because it was all the word he said now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word then the two Inspirations gives a result no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you no good amen until you are in insired yourself it takes your inspiration the word is already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us and to awaken us to his word he said then when the word being brought in the spirit of inspiration amen then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two is just coming together can I can I give you one more he said the word of God Amen it is not like the word of a man he said a word of a man has a certain meaning for the expression Amen in the time it was given but God's word amen has an eternal meaning amen down Through the Ages as it flows on Amen y'all know another way they talk about oxygen don't you amen is flow so amen as the word is Flowing as the word is breathing amen as the word is moving it is not losing its power it is not losing its inspiration it is not losing its ability as a matter of fact amen the word is in this building tonight amen in the same quality that it was amen when Jesus stood in John 20 amen and rebuke the fear and released unto them amen a peace and an authority now brother said it very beautiful he said every generation can pick up the same word amen because it is an inspired it is an eternal and everlasting amen nonfading declaration from God Amen the word of God is an eternal inspired Everlasting non-fading declaration from God no matter if the apostles read it in their age it meant something to them if Wesley read it in his age amen it meant something to him and Calvin but yet today somebody say today amen it's just as brilliant and bright and got just as much of an effect amen as it did on them in the very day it was spoken amen because it is God's word amen can I say this the spoken word amen shall never lose its inspiration the spoken word shall never lose its ability the spoken word shall never lose its power the spoken word shall never lose its anointing amen and I come here tonight to declare unto you amen that the spoken word is the same yesterday amen today and forever and he still got his original qualities amen if he was a savior in the beginning he's a savior here tonight if he was a Healer in the beginning He Is A Healer here tonight if he was a miracle worker in the beginning he is a miracle worker here in the ending amen because we might be in a different day and we might be in a different month on the calendar amen but God is still the same amen and if we'll just open up the doors and let the flow of the Holy Ghost amen come back in the church he will rebuke the fear he will rebuke the sin he will rebuke the iniquity he will rebuke the confusion listen I think if there's ever been a time Amen to lay aside the confusion and come back to Vindicated word amen now is the time now is the hour amen the word of God is inspired now you see the word of a man has a certain meaning for a certain time but the word of God has an eternal meaning amen for whatever generation it's spoken for look at the words of a man you could say John come over to my house I'll be glad to see you that's our words and all it means that's right all it means is John amen come over to our house but when God speaks amen it's a difference when a man speaks and when God speaks he said it's Eternal it is breathed from his very breath of the immortal Everlasting Creator himself so therefore there's no way to ever find the full meaning of an expression of God it's for every age and every generation amen when a man speaks he says John come to the house amen and John comes to the house amen now listen things can happen under the words of a man amen to stop John from getting to your house amen but if God speaks amen it's the breath of a Creator and if he says I'm coming to your house gyrus amen it don't matter if your baby does die amen he is the way he is the truth and he is the resurrection and because he said I am coming to your house he will make a way Amen to come to your house and if God said he will Rapture you if God said he will deliver you if God said he will change your body amen some morning between 6:00 and 9 it don't matter what happens amen it didn't come from the breath of a human man it has come from the breath of the immortal God and he will come on the scene in the power of His creation and where there is no way he will be the way where there is no Red Sea he will make the Red Sea where there is no tomorrow he will be the tomorrow where there is no future he will be the future because he is not speaking words of a man it's the word of God and it's a powerful word amen I love job 32:8 I love the Bible where job 32:8 he says there is a spirit in man and he says and the inspiration amen of the almighty amen giveth him understanding you know what that word inspiration means it means breath that's right the Breath of God Amen is the inspiration of the almighty so when God breathes it's not stale when God breathes it's not decayed when God breathes amen it's not foul poisonous breath amen but when God breathes it is full of strength when God breathes it is full of vigor when God breathes it brings a renewing when God breathes things begin to change amen because the breath of the almighty is the inspiration of the Almighty I love what the prophet said he said oh God who formed the heavens and the Earth and just let his breath go forth with his word amen you cannot separate amen the Breath of God from the word of God and everything Tak in its right position so in other words when God begin to breathe he begin to speak and as he begin to speak amen than begin to take their position amen by the breath of the spoken word he said the Earth and the moon and the stars amen they all swung into place amen just as God breathed on his word and oh God today we ask that you'll breathe on your word amen as we are trying to bring it to the people may it take its position this morning its place and be rooted and grounded in every heart amen that every person here might receive your blessings do you realize how the moon got in the sky was God spoke and there was a breath it was connected to his speaking and the moon came into existence and the moon took its place amen how did those mountains out there get there how did the water in the firmament amen how did all these things happen amen there was a breath and it was an immortal breath and it was the breath of a Creator and the prophet said father I thank how that you've ever stooped down are y'all hearing me amen he spoke in the moon to give place he spoke and the sun took its place he spoke and the Stars took their place amen but listen bride he said how you ever stooped down and took somebody like me that was a poor sinner amen and by the grace of God now I am your child he said and many others in here Lord feel the same way and we're just here breathing amen because you let us breathe that's exactly right now come on Church the Moon is shining because God the Creator spoke and let the moon shine amen the Sun is shining because God the Creator spoke and let the sunshine hey the mountains are in the skies because God spoke and the mountains took their place well Church of the Living God if he can move the creation if he can move the solar system I believe he's the same God that can come and spoken word Tabernacle on a Wednesday night and he can open his word and he can place his voice in the mouth of the the five-fold ministry and they can begin to speak that word listen I'll tell you why the devil don't want you to hear this word is because it's more than the breath of Andrew Glover it's more than the breath of Steven it's more than the breath of brother Kelly it's more than the breath of any preacher it is the positionally placing breath of the almighty God and as it begins to blow in the church things begin to take their position hallelujah hallelujah amen when the wind begins to blow amen things begin to take their position amen you're not a defeat you're an overcomer take your position you're not the defeated you are the victors take your position come on Amen you're not lay out of sins you are the Bride of Jesus Christ by the spoken word of the creator of the immortal breath then rise and shine thy light has come and take your position as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen amen amen things begin to change when God begins to breathe things begin to take their position when God begins to breathe listen the prophet of God said Every Breath You Ever breathed it come from God the Every Breath You ever breathe it come from God sir now can I show you something in the Bible in Genesis 2 is where we find the first word amen mentioned about breath in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says that the Lord God Amen formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life amen and Man became a living Soul the prophet of God said I can see Adam standing he said seem him standing like a tree God had made him he was dead as he could be his toes amen like the root sticking in the ground and God said let there be that's right come on Church Genesis 1 God says Let There Be and there's a moon Let There Be and there's Stars Let There Be and there's a firmance Let There Be and the day is divided from the nights but in Genesis 2 he says Let There Be and the prophet said or breathe the breath amen of life into him and he jumped and he came to himself see he breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul and he be to move oh I'm getting ahead of myself amen but you know in the Book of Luke amen there was a parable of a coin right there was a parable of a sheep and then there was a parable of a prodical son that prodal son was born in his father's house he had inheritance in his father's house amen but sin took him away from the father's house he was out of his position amen but God be to breathe come on church and the same God that breathed in Genesis into Adam and he came to himself was the same God go read Luke 15 and see if the Bible don't say that the prodical son came to himself can I ask you something what brought him to himself amen the same breath that brought Adam to himself in the creation of God is the same breath amen that went to the hog pin and brought that boy to himself well I might as well say it that's the same breath that is breathed and lay out a sea and has quickened the seed of God we was in Baptist and Catholic and Pentecostal and all kinds of things we didn't know who we are but God who is rich in Mercy breathe on this generation by the voice of the seventh angel listen we're not under the first pool we're not under the second pool we have come under the third pull which was the Spoken Word by creation power has returned to the church well I might as well say it I'm not confused I have come to myself I am a Holy Ghost Field fire baptized Pillar of Fire following message of the hour preaching devil whipping serpent stomping son of the Living God I know who I am I know who I am I know where I come from I know where I'm standing and I know where I'm going I've been breathed on I've been breathed on the same breath that breathed on Adam has Breathe on Me yes my brother yes sir when he begins to moow my brother when the winds begin to Bow you will come to yourself I say oh God breathe in this church tonight let our young people let our elders let our preachers let our deacons let our officers come to yourself and realize who you are that's right by the authority yes my of the spoken word of God hey I'm talking about the power of God I'm talking about Adam was laying in the ground with his toes in the dirt like a tree but when God breathed he came to himself don't call me crazy okay amen but you know what Adam did when he came to himself he also came to Authority amen God bre on amen aen he came to himself yes sir and he came to Authority as an amateur God he came to godship he came to sunship he came to spoken word of that's the same thing that happened in John 20 he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost yes sir and then he said do what I did do what I did but there's a bride on the earth tonight who has received the authority of the word of God and Greater Works than this how you do come on Church do what he did yes my brother come on Church do what he did you say well brother Andrew there ain't no water to walk on there ain't no storms to speak to there ain't no Widow of name son to raise amen but there's some devils to defeat that's right there's some spirits to overcome come on Church there is a character of the almighty God that is to be displayed in this generation he's not bringing back Peter to do it he's not bringing back Paul to do it he's not bringing William Brandon back to do it but somebody is going to come into their position by the breath of the word of the almighty God there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough spirits of Hell to defeat them yes my they know who they are they know where they come from they know where they're standing now when you start when you start talking about this creation do you realize that creation is directly connected to the Breath of God in Isaiah 42 verse 5 I love this scripture the Bible says thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretch them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which come out of it that's right he did not just create the heavens and create the Earth but he breathed and come out oh God and there was creation that come out of his Creation in other words the Creator had fruit the Stars was fruit the moon was fruit the sun was fruit Genesis 2 Adam was fruit he was fruit of the creation by the spoken word and the prophet says now watch he picks this up Isaiah the prophet and says that which cometh out of it now watch he don't just create and bring into existence he don't just create can I say it like this and leave the form there but he puts his own life in it watch what Isa amen amen he that giveth breath unto the people upon it yes my brother yes sir yes sir glory to God sir he that giveth breath to the people upon it amen can I can I preach to in my simple Country Way that' be like Walt Disney that be like Walt Disney creating Disney World and putting all the games and all the rides and all this food and all the ice cream in there amen I'm not promoting Disney just give me some Grace he does all this amen and then Walt Disney turns around and hands you an unlimited credit card and says go enjoy it he not only created it but now he is supplying you the means to enjoy what he has created that's exactly right God take your time now he is now giving you amen the ability to enjoy what so Disney World is not sitting there unoccupied amen but now there is somebody who is possessing a token to go in there and to enjoy what has been created to enjoy well Church of the Living God Amen there are promises in this word there is reality in this word amen everything is in the word amen but without the baptism of the Holy Ghost the token life of Jesus Christ you could have never come into third pole power you could have never enjoyed the Realties of the revelation of Jesus Christ so God who is rich in Mercy supplied you with a token to go into everything he created and to enjoy it yes my brother yes my brother yes sir he giveth breath he giveth breath un the people now come on can I say this he giveth breath he giveth breath in the people to to stand up Amen to stand upon it but then I love what Isaiah says continue my friend and spirit to them that walk therein amen amen so he don't just breathe on them and them stand there as a living bound breathing individual but then he puts appear in them to walk under the authority of the breath that he has placed in them do you see what this message is it's not just word only it's word and spirit the spirit and Truth Has Come Together in The Bride of Jesus Christ and it's not stale and it's not ve and it's not void it's got power in it it's got the holy ghost power Hallelujah I'm talking about somebody that has the Breath of God and the authority of God yes my brother my brother he said you are The God Who breathes from the first breath of life ever coming the Earth he said now watch this he said he blowed your breath he said God blowed his breath in the palm of his hand and when he blowed his breath he said every Star come into existence he took a handful of dust and he breathed oh God he breathed into that dust and every Star that was in his hand come into existence you all study brother brandom you know what he said Isaiah 14 he said the devil would exalt himself amen above the stars of God you know what he said the stars of God are they are the sons of God that's come on church he come on Hallelujah I feel like preaching here for a minute he knew in the end time that Lucifer would come into manifestation and he would try to Rob amen the son of God of their position but God was so confident in the breath that he breathed that when that breath come across your life it would clearly reveal to you your position and no device of Satan could ever remove you from your god-given position hallelujah what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying amen that breath is a sign of life if there is no breath there is no life amen come on if somebody Falls over and you call 911 what's the first thing they say are they breathing is there any breath because the prophet said when a baby's born amen with live muscles amen a beating heart but there's no breath in it I'm preaching to you now amen there's muscles twitching there's a heart beating but there's no breath he said it's muscles twitching he said but when this body amen does not receive the oxygen or the breath now watch what breath is it is the intake and the out take of our lungs then we're dead now can I say this intake can be called inhale and outtake can be called exhale so if there's no inhaling and there's no exhaling come on church if there's no inhaling and there's no exhaling then there's no life if there's no intake and no outtake then there's no lien come on so the other words words some things have got to come in the church and some things have got to leave come on Church some things have got to come in the church and some things have got to leave the word has got to come in your opinion's got to go the word has got to come in your tradition has got to go the power of the Holy Ghost has got to come in but psychology's got to go come on church amen Joy has got to come in and depression has got to go victory has got to come in and defeat has got to go yes sir are you hearing me there's got to be some intake and there's got to be some outtake amen if there is no intake and there is no outtake go ahead there is no life come on church and I'm not a dead Church that's a lot of talk about dead churches let's talk about them for a second amen I'm not a dead church I'm not just laying here taking in everything that the devil's trying to give me no sir but God has given me a powerful set of L that's right brother Kelly God has give me a powerful set of lungs and I've got the ability to breathe in the word and to breathe out the confusion to breathe in the anointing and to breathe out the Yol I have been given the breath of the almighty God by the spoken word of God hallelujah hallelujah now I might as well keep preaching preach my brother bre is connected to life amen and it's also connected to praise [Music] [Applause] H it's connected to life but it's also connected to praise you know what David said he said let everything th have let everything th have that breath praise ye the Lord am Hallelujah let everything that hath intake and outake praise ye the Lord Glory come on church God wasn't satisfied with the keys he wasn't satisfied with the symbols he wasn't satisfied with the stringed instruments because there was some creation Hallelujah he wanted a praise to come out of his creation can I make this as simple as I can God spoke and said let there be and he breathed into you and you became a living soul and then God turned around and said let everything yes sir that has my breath praise praise ye the Creator well you know what you know why you can't praise it's cuz you're just in inhaling problems and you're inhaling situations and you're inhaling this you're inhaling that and it's choking your praise it's choking your worship but it's time to breathe again it's time to praise again it's time to breathe out all the problems it's time to breathe out all the situations and breathe in the inspiration of the almighty God GL glory to God breathe it in again Church breathe it till you can praise breathe it till you can sing breathe it till you can preach breathe it till you can testify breathe it till you can confess the word of God yes sir breathe yes breathe breathe again yes let everything that hath breath praise the Lord come on spoken word Tabernacle yes sir I'm preaching to you you know why you can't get to the Future it's cuz all you're doing is inhaling the past Brea you're breathing the past you're breathing the problems you're breathing the confusions but breathe again uhhuh I said Breathe Again amen and breathe out the past that's right and breathe in the future that's right I said breathe in the future breathe in the future breathe in the Rapture breathe in the future home breathe in the through body bring in the theoy breathe in Victory Breathe In the Future Hope breathe Church you got to bre breathe until life can return again and you can get your joy back you can get your back yes my brother you can get your testimony back but you got to breathe yes my [Applause] [Music] brother let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord You've give your breath to your problems long enough I said you've your breath to your problems long enough PR your problems didn't create you your problems did not create you no sir and neither can they help you no sir so take away your breath that's right from your problems that's right and give them to your Lord amen amen amen and begin to praise him until he comes into action yes sir in the middle of your battle now brother BR said if you ain't got breath he said direct quote he said still praise the Lord if you ain't got breath you ought to still praise the Lord now I'll say this wherever the Breath of God is the word you will get a response out of this bride that's right remember brother B said we was out there in Tucson and he said we went out to a Baptist Church just to get some word he said anything we could get right C he said we went out there he said just to kind of get a little fresh feeling you know he said we need a little fresh something he said and I went in there and we sat down and he said the preacher got up and he said there was a lot of things we couldn't agree with he said but all of a sudden he said one day Israel left Egypt and they got tired of the garlic and the leak in Egypt and brother said we all raised up and said amen We Said Amen brother said when we said that he said everybody turned around and looked at us come on now now everybody turned around and looked at us as if we were crazy he said and they lost sight of the preacher I got to think about that brother stevenh you know what it happened amen is it was a dead church that's exactly right that it was a dead Church all they were doing was intaking the denominational ideas about the word of God and become a stagnated broken sister amen But Here Come a part of the creative word of God and sat down in the meeting listen you cannot have the creation from its creator are you hearing me listen I'll tell you how much I believe in this bride you could put her in the pits of hell and she would still confess this message is the truth you could put her in the Vatican in an interview with the Pope and she would still say that William Mary and brandom is the seventh angel you could put her in a seminary with a bunch of atheen and agnostics and she would still confess that there is one Lord and his name is Jehovah and he's the Jehovah of the old he's the Jesus of the new are you hearing me because you're not living on just intake you're intaking and outt taking you're breathing you want me to prove it to you yes sir as you're listening to tapes you're breathing as you're reading your Bible you're breathing as you're coming to church you're breathing yes sir come on church as you're going to meetings and hearing the message you're breathing as your Pastors laboring in series and study you're breathing that's right you know what's happening you're exhaling things that's contrary and inhaling faith and you're not getting weaker you're getting stronger yes my PR I can say today I am stronger today than I was yesterday as a matter of fact I'm stronger today than I've ever been amen and I'm not getting weaker brother Greg I'm getting stronger because I'm breathing I'm breathing clean air I'm breathing message air I'm breathing Vindicated word I'm breathing anointed word I'm breathing seven seal third pull the aony word and my lungs are getting so strong that I'm choking on way out of SE hallelujah oh glory to God when anything else comes in the church contrary to this message we choke on it amen amen amen amen amen don't get mad at me cuz I can't amen your nonsense it chokes me that's exactly right that's exactly I said it chokes me and it's hard to talk when you're choking ah so if you want me to say Amen preach this message preach the message if you want this bride to shout say what a prophet is saying if you want us to dance prach message anything else chokes us preach preach well Billy gram said that chokes us well Charles Spurgeon that chokes us choke yes I'm here I might as well preach well brother so and so thinks about that chokes us we got to have clean air amen we got to have fresh air can I say this we've got to have word air [Applause] aen anything else chokes us [Applause] pre now y'all y'all remember in 1962 brother preaches on Blasphemous names remember and he starts off by correcting the Jehovah Witness you know what he says he says they're teaching now watch what they're teaching that the breath you breathe is the soul he said that's not right he said the breath is the wind and the wind is what you breathe into your nostrils he goes to Genesis 2 and Adam and says but what God did he breathe the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul a soul that cannot die now notice breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became Eternal Soul cause God breathed not what nature done but what God did see breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he become a living Soul then you say to me well Adam died brother Brandon but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him so we're not breathing Church of Christ air we're not breathing Pentecostal carryon on predestination air we are breathing predestinated who he fornew who is called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type Adam fail then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the Eternal God and he became a living Soul he said now watch he said the African word is amoya he said which means the wind or the Unseen Force now watch animals breathe amoya and sinners breathe amoya listen bride we're not living on amoya we're not coming to church on Amo the animals are living on Moya Sinners are living on the Moya he said but God is especially upon Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God listen brother takes it from Adam and says and someday the sons of God will again become God's listen I say that's not in the future that's happening right here in spoken word Tabernacle the same breath that made Adam a son is the same breath that's made you an eternal son come on and the prophet said the true church is born by the Breath of God he said let me read you and see whether the church is born of the Breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning the father that sent with that sent him went in him come on Church the god that created Adam got into Adam by the breath of of the life right then in this day the god that called you that predestin ated you that elected you has come into you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can I say what a prophet said when the stature has molded itself up there in condition then God breathed upon them and said receive the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you are born into the Church of the Living God now watch what a prophet said God breathe upon them now watch what bam does and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost bam said in other words they didn't join they were born how were they born he said that's how we have eternal life is because we were spoken into existence by God not joined into a church but born by the word the Original Seed oh spoken word Tabernacle no wonder the devil can't get you no wonder the devil can't defeat you it's the same breath that readed in Genesis has returned under the preaching of the message of the hour and there is a bride who is come into existence and in her soul is the Original Seed can I say this and it's just as fresh tonight as it was in Genesis 1 it's just as inspired tonight as it was in Genesis [Music] 2 well somebody give me some shout room in the house of God I'll tell you why the devil hates us it's cuz we're not a stale Church we're a fresh Church we're not a stale bride we're a fresh bride we have not been altered by the processing of some denomination we have been breathed upon and the same qualities that was in the beginning it's coming into manifestation God I feel like dancing right now I got the original seed with the original life I'm going by the original word I'm fall the original God I have been inspired by the [Applause] breath I know who I am you can't change [Applause] it hallelujah hallelujah can I say this and I'm living by that word I'm living by that word I'm Overcoming By that word I'm taking my Mountain by that word I'm praying for the by that word I'm casting out Devils I'm dancing in the spirit I'm preaching the message by the word I was born by you can try but brother Zach they'll never succeed you will never separate me from my daddy I know who my daddy is I know who my daddy is my daddy is the word my father is the word the seed that's in my soul come from the word so we choke on anything contrary to the word inspiration breath wind air of God [Applause] see brother God said been seing a little minority group that would be gathered out there under inspiration of God it just come to me so Amen Let me just preach it to you gathered out there under gathered out there under a little inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in so there's a war going on the battle between the bride and the God of this evil age right now watch and in this war there's going to be some times that we're going to get knocked down there going to be times we're going to get hurt but y'all know what they had in the war days they had things called oxygen [Applause] tents testing one two oxygen tents [Applause] [Music] they had a tent that if you got into it it had oxygen in other words you went into it and you couldn't breathe but when you come out of it are you with me when you come out of it you receive something in there that breathed into you to carry on in the battle what are you saying I'm saying the prophet said amen that there was a little room and he said I'll meet you in there where was in there in the third pool come on Church get your head out of heresy teaching I'm not looking for an airplane I'm not looking for a White Horse I'm not looking for brother BR to come back and set up a tent I am looking at the almighty God in his tent he's in his tent he's in his bride and he's breathing into her [Applause] see the prod God said it very beautiful he said what is it it's the word joining to the [Applause] word hallelujah it's the word joining to the word in other words Adam was the word but when the breath come the word joined to the word and there was a manifestation can and I say this to you we are called by the word now can I say it this Bible is the written word but since I'm looking at the predestinated word the written word called to the predestinated word and there was a union took place and all that was in God he poured in to Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into this word bride now I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to Bott in the meeting out here right now but let me just preach to you for a second okay I'm going to ask you a very I'm going to ask you a very simple but a very powerful question is this okay brother Stephen is it okay are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our [Applause] [Music] midst are we sufficiently not just impressed but sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergami and church age which was yet 200 years off from the Patmos Vision he knew that drift would cause him to go in the Dark Ages he knew the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left [Applause] god well brother Andrew all we done was we changed a little bit of the word then you left a little bit of God come on church now I might as well preach I'm here if you leave the word word you leave God can I say something to you can I say it you can leave the word and still have [Applause] signs come on church you can leave the word and still have signs but can I tell you what they're not Mark 16 signs come on he said he is presenting himself to the CH I'm going to prove it to you to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages now here's what he says I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone anyone anyone or anything get between you and the word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the Lord remember that don't you ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word then he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I've not left my text Jesus went in a little room where the Jews were hid because of fear and the Bible says Jesus came in their midst in other words the word came in their midst were they sufficiently impressed with the word now can I preach to you the Bible said he would be crucified the Bible said he would be buried the Bible said he would go to hell the Bible said he would take back the keys of death hell and the grave are y'all hearing me the Bible said he would empty out paradise are you hearing me and the Bible said he would raise again on the third day not a bone in his body would be broken okay listen that was Zachariah that was the prophets that was all the scripture but when Jesus come walking in their midst they were still reading what Zachariah said but here was the Fulfillment of the word in their midst can I say this he can be in your midst but if you don't catch him he'll pass you by [Applause] come on now Mary Magdalene thought he was a gardener in the Tomb and here was the word walking with her are you hearing me and if he didn't wake her up to it it would have passed her right by on the road to EMAs there were two disciples they were walking with the word he was in their midst come on church he was the one they were talking about he was the one they were sad about but their eyes were holding but when they stepped in a little room when they constrained him to come into a little room he took the bread and he broke it and as he broke the bread are y'all hearing me sister sister he didn't he didn't even handle the bread and them eat it just as he broke it oh god brother just as he broke it their eyes come open imagine what it did to them when they eat it [Applause] if just the breaking of the bread could open their eyes then what did it do when they begin to feed upon it come on Church in 19 is this okay in 1963 the prophet preaches the seals he preaches the token and comes and preaches desperation and says oh Church rise pinch your conscience Shake Yourself he said there's something coming and he said if if you're not careful it'll pass you right by and you will miss it now I hope this okay because the prophet said now watch sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst don't get mad at me but he did not say signs he said word because signs can be imp impersonated but the word cannot be [Applause] impersonated now don't get mad at me but if any man claims to have the same gift or the same manifestation of the Messiah sign that William Brandon Marian had or anybody says another man does have that you put me on record that man has a Lon Spirit on [Applause] him come on church I don't think we ought to go around saying well what I hear on the tapes and the sign of discernment and the mess sign is back in the church listen brother br's not here today operating the first and second pull that's not our pull it had nothing to do with us but the third pull the word is in our midst the word is in this building tonight Discerning your thoughts calling out your situations ministering to your needs the word is in our midst listen he wants to breathe he wants to breathe come on Church brother said Watch 2 Thessalonians 2 whom the Lord now watch oh my I'm running out of time then which the wicked then shall the wicked be revealed now can I watch this can I preach it to you then that shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming where does breath come from when you speak your mouth whom the Lord shall destroy with the spirit of his mouth are y'all hearing me the same breath oh God it's here the same breath that saved you is the same breath that destroys your [Applause] enemy the same breath that called you to this message the same breath that opens your eyes to the revealing of the son of man is the same breath that will destroy the son of predition oh even him who is coming after the working of Satan with all powers and signs and ly wonders when the word says in the first seal when the word is refused then they are turned to their desires that would turn down reject the truth they would be given over to a reprobate mind and would believe a lie and would be damned by it that's what the holy spirit said now can I say this we are lovers of the word and the word is the truth and the word is in our midst now can I follow up my statement if the word is in our midst then the true signs and the true wonders are in our midst because the word has come into our midst and we have been sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now you all know what Mark 16 says it says it like this it says are you with me Mark 16 says now the word would be in the Believers right and the prodag God said watch he said now look Jesus said the signs shall follow them believe what believe the word now the prophet of God said in this last day there's a generation of sign Seekers but God never Place signs ahead of his word so it's never the word following signs brother kma it's signs following the word now can I say something to you how do you as a Believer come into your position by the word so when the word brings you in into your position then God automatically gives you signs and wonders to accompany you in your position as a Believer who is sufficiently impressed with the word that has positionally place them in the age they're living in brother brother brother AEL you probably remember this years ago we was at Camp I don't know if you was there or not but years ago Danny steaman was preaching there at the camp and brother Danny got to preach on Mark 16 and while he was preaching he goes down there and he gets two brothers you know and he says brother your signs and he says your wonders you can look it up on Internet it's real powerful he said your signs and your wonders he said now everywhere I go I'm the word he said you follow me so brother Danny started walking and them two boys started following him and you know what brother Danny never done he never stopped to look back and see if they were there he never stopped and made sure that signs and wonders was there he never stopped one time and said oh God I'm your son let signs and wonders be there I'm your he just took off walking in his position as the word and wherever he went they went with him he said now watch if I speed up signs and wond speed up he said if I slow down signs and wond slow down I love this one brother I love this one he he walked off the platform and he went into a dark place and he said if I go in a dark place signs and wonders go with me spoken word Tabernacle it's time to rise to your position as the stars of God and take back your position as a word born Church listen I am not ashamed to be called a word bride I am not ashamed to be identified as a word preacher I am saved by the word I am sealed by the word I Am Redeemed by the word I am encouraged by the word I am an overcomer by the word Everything I Do I Do It by the word you know why because I am sufficiently impressed with the word amen I am sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst amen oh God I'm out of time can I say this preach my brother the word in the church there'll be Miracles if you just get the word in the church there will be Miracles automatically yes sir you know what your Prophet said yes he said miracles take place on the word amen are you hearing me Miracles take place on the word so what are you living by you're living by the Revelation yes sir of the word can I say this to you yes my brother can I say it yes and you cannot be deceived amen amen they tried didn't they they tried to hand you a little idea of don't quote brother bam just read the Bible but it choked you that's exactly right come on Church they tried to hand you a little idea I don't say brother R's name but it choked you that's exactly right you know why because you're a word born bride yes sir and the only you can live by is the pure original word that has not been altered by the way of Cain or by the doctrine of bam you are a word born bride and the only thing that you can live by is the word that's exactly right preach my I'm this close to it I might as well preach if you ever get the word then gifts and Sensations and line wonders and signs

when the attendance drops they can't get you to back off preaching the message amen amen you know why because your type in the Bible is Simeon yes sir and Simeon received a revelation that I will not die until I have seen the Lord's Christ yes come on Church Simeon received that Revelation he walked by that Revelation he lived by that Revelation and no mama carrying another baby could deceive Simeon into be leaving something that was apart from the original fresh Revelation yes my brother Glory 79 years old brother and he's all stooped over and his back is hurting and his shoulders is hurting and he can't even hardly make it to church so maybe he walks in church brother Steven sir and he sits down and here comes a little woman you know and she walks over and says look Simon here's the baby look here's the baby Simeon said that's an uncertain sound oh that's an uncertain sound see because oh God because the same God that breathed when I receive the revelation will bear witness

okay preach it move ourselves out of the way that's right then the word will move in amen and the word will do things amen amen you move yourself out of the way amen and let the message move in then the message will do things that you or I can never do he said You Preach a gospel that can make a people that was once bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes and everything else out on the street can cause them to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus are you ready for this and can feel the ins a of the spirit to rise you to a place Till You Lose Yourself amen amen amen you lose yourself and you scream out amen hallelujah praises to God am what's causing that is the word is returned in our midst and we are thoroughly impressed by it are y'all hearing me shouting oh God I wish I had another hour are you hearing me the word is causing you to amen things that your flesh don't want you to agree with ah the word is causing you to amen things that your flesh disagrees with amen but you know what's doing it the wind of God is blowing in the church and it's blowing out Pride it's blowing out animosity it's blowing out confusion yes and it's breathing again an amen hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen amen y'all remember a few days ago I think I spoke to you on it here about angel coming to Mary and then I was preaching out brother brother Tom's there on Saturday night and it just broke to me brother Steven amen Mary went in there that day and the angel appeared and gave her the message of Luke 1 and whenever that message got done preaching amen all she could say before the angel departed was these words be it unto me that's it according to Thy word amen when the angel appeared she had some questions how's this going to be what's going to bring it to pass what's going to manifest it by the time the angel got done delivering the message the Angel's message had so weakened her flesh had so robbed her of her human excuses that all she could say was be unto me according to Thy Word come on Mary you got a bunch of excuses you got a bunch of situations but the message has been delivered by the angel of the Lord in this generation all I can say when I hear the word say there's going to be a Rapture be it unto me according to Thy word the prodal are coming home be it unto me according to Thy word I'm going to see my dead loved ones be it unto me according yes agreed on them amen glory to God glory to God glory to [Applause] [Music] God preach my the inspired word yes sir word has come into our midst yes sir yes sir and if we can move theology out of the way that's say my brother amen and let the Vindicated word move my brother yes sir yes sir sisters Addy you won't raise yourself to an amen the word will brother you know what I'm talking about sometimes you don't feel like saying amen but when the word when the word starts breathing the wind the wind begins to pick you up into another dimension and all you can say yes Lord yes Lord he says I'm a Healer and all you can say is yes Lord he says I'm your deliverer and all you can say come on church I'm closing on this when the Winds of God begins to blow things begin to change yes sir are

for this it will defeat Every Lie that's been told on it amen amen amen amen if you'll just let the word speak you won't have to defend it it'll defend itself because it's the inspired Eternal powerful word of God remember that woman laying in the bed dying and they sent her son a postcard and said come VIs at your mama remember that and and they said hurry so he couldn't make it very quick so a couple months went by and he made it home expecting to find his mom dead oh God expecting to find his mom dead and he walks in there brother and when he walks in there she's sitting there just as well as could be he said honey he said Mama what happened she said oh honey said some of them people from that Full Gospel oh I skipped it but I got to say it all scripture all scripture I'm crazy enough to look up the word all you know what the word all in the Greek means it means any all everything anything in all things contained in all scripture is inspired amen she said they come down here and they prayed for me according to Mark 16 that's it he said when they prayed for me she said the Holy Ghost come in and healed my body listen what her theological son said he said Mama in seminary we learned that Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is not inspired come on now come on now from the ninth verse on it's not inspired on she said well honey if God could heal me with a scripture that is uninspired then what could God do with that which is inspired Glory brother stepen I you know what you the kind of person I am you know what I did I went and read Mark 169 and you know what Mark 169 said Mark 169 said and he appeared he appeared unto Mary Magdalene of whom he had cast Seven Devils out of have y'all ever caught this when the prophet said they said Mark 16:9 on is uninspired brother B said the Theologian said it was put in there by a false witness but you know what I love about Mark 16:9 is they didn't go ask somebody that was in the service when Mary Magdalene got delivered but the very one he talked to was the one in whom the word had had an effect in her life let me say this to you there's a reason why sister they can't talk us how this message is we didn't just read about it we didn't just study it we didn't just listen to it but we are a direct effect of the message that's a powerful one I am a direct effect of the message of the seventh angel I am a witness he's a prophet I am a witness this is the third I am a witness he is here amen amen amen glory to God I am a wit he preach my is here Glory he's here Glory he's here Glory he's here yes my

this uhuh he breathed on them amen and said receive ye uh the Holy Ghost yes sir and I close on this point that word breathe means to blow or breathe up on in Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam and he become a living Soul are you ready for this sir and just as the original creation was completed by an act of God uh just as the original creation was completed by an act of God so to the new creation was completed by an act of God Amen from the head of the new creation amen amen a new creation not to a denomination but to the word you are a creation am of the word amen amen let our musicians come now the breath yes sir and the spirit has become the same amen are you ready for this Amen in the ministry of the Bride yes my brother so the Holy Spirit has been moving yes sir and there was just a little breath of it with Luther and a little blow of it with Wesley that's right and a deeper blow of it with Pentecost that's exactly right but now but now but now the breath and the spirit has become the same she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there and is manifesting the same Works he did back there is being manifested right today amen the same thing yes my brother yes sir yes sir yes sir when he begins to blow amen but tonight the prophet of God said the time would come Hallelujah that she would begin to
