nicky sharnick sends a daily devotion to a few of us every morning and uh i went and i went back again actually and listened to the one monday prior to his parent his mom and sister and everybody in the accident and it was on suffering i shared it with a small group on um on our what's that but it was about suffering suffering for god for christ well you know it's it's been a few days since he's had any anything obviously he's been taking care of you know grieving and taking care of the business with his dad i'm sure but um he sent one out again this morning and he pointed out how the last one that he did was it was concerning suffering and i i don't know if he's been getting questions from people but one thought was very strong in his in his uh in his text this morning it was don't go back don't give up he said it doesn't matter how you suffer how much suffering he said don't even give consideration to leaving this message and going back don't even let the con the thought come up to be considered that's a lesson for every one of us and amen amen amen amen and and that's that's a lot of suffering that they just they're still i'm sure they're still grieving i would be everybody
