Stephen shimbo eagle symbol for the invitation we love him so much uh he he's a he's a peeler amen the Bible says he that overcomes I will make him a pillar in the city of my God and pillars are not easily shaken praise be to God pillars are not easily shaken they are not shaken by every wind of Doctrine amen they stand with the word of God that's what brother Stephen Shambo is he's been a pillar for many of you here and no doubt to me he is a big brother and we love him so much and one of the things that I love about brother Stephen chambo is he is very sensitive to the Holy Ghost and I always look for that and he's a man that is not binding people to himself but he's binding them to the word which is Christ Jesus and that's a that's a true eunuch a true servant of the Lord praise be to God amen we thought we should say that because if we want to say it on our WhatsApp when he dies God forbid God forbids amen that's what people do in nowadays the moment you die they'll put you on Facebook and what's up I have a code for that yes my brother giving men a rose how many knows that caught I won't finish the court glory to God praise God Amen this is a very healthy Church it's a church the church that loves their pastor and the pastor loves their Church that's to help you home the husband loves the wife and the wife loves the husband [Applause] [Music] amen but a wife who dominates the husband that suggests of your spirit and the husband who runs over his wife that's a nicolitan spirit praise be to God yes but we are right in the middle of the road let's turn to our scripture Romans chapter 9 verse 33. my wife came with me she's in the nursery room with a baby so you won't be able to see it out here but he certainly loves the world and she loves this church so much Romans chapter 9 verse 33 if you have it it reads like this says it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen amen behold I yes my brother as a personal pronoun lay inside The Stumbling Stone it's not anyone who is doing this is God himself who is laying in Zion a rock of offense praise be to God blessed is he that is not offended in me praise be to God you may have your seats pray once more Lord we thank you for the inspiration that wrote the Bible we believe the inspiration is still alive tonight come further and give bread to your children amen may you break the bread in such a way that they will recognize you like cleopas and his friends amen thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise be to God yes we're going to continue with uh the parallel in the seventh trumpet and the seventh the seal yes uh we just started on it but I feel like we didn't do enough Justice to it so today I will try to give more context and more quotation so that you know what we are talking about amen so as we begin here you'll see that it's God who said here so this is Paul talking about the Jews so Romans 9 10 11 Paul is talking about the Jews that the Jews they stumbled Over The Stumbling Stone but this stumbling Stone it was God who put that stumbling Stone you know when brother Branham was in his home he had a vision and in that Vision he had a blast praise be to God and when he had a blast it was so powerful that it almost shook the Earth and he said I thought I was going to die but Joseph was in that dream I said Lord if I'm not going to die send back your power and God sent back his power praise Bill God now I'm not going to go into the details of the vision but he says when I came out of the vision I was pointing to this scripture behold I lay a stone in Zion so this scripture was being written by Paul concerning the Jews but what happens to the Jews is exactly what happens to the Gentiles that's right that God brings estambling Stone yes God brings a rock of offense yes God is about to do something that will be an offense to some people that's right Hallelujah yes my brother and brother Branham talks about this Vision in the message says is this the time that's right and he was going to talk about he was talking the vision that would be fulfilled in in Arizona yes sir and don't never mind if people stumble on this Cloud that's right because of the scripture yes it's a rock of a fans yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir that God said I'm going to do this amen hallelujah glory to God this is the Lord's doing yes and it is marvelous in our yes my brother amen praise be to God glory to God it is marvelous in our eyes yes sir it's a rock of our friends to unbelievers but unto us it's marvelous marvelous yes my brother yes my brother the messenger is marvelous yes my brother yes my brother Hallelujah glory to God the hands of zaruba bell is

shouting Grace Grace unto it amen hallelujah I love people that come to church on Wednesday if you come to church on Sunday you are a conqueror if you come on Sunday and Wednesday you are more than conquerors amen through Christ who loved us amen amen praise be to God yes God has a sense of humor that's exactly right so if you if you come to our church on Wednesday then conqueror amen because the devil doesn't want people to come to church and it's a spirit that has come in the last days that's right that keeps people from coming to church right people can go to watch football matches right and they pay money to do that that's right people who go to movies and pay money to do that right people who go to places and pay money to go there right but they won't come to church for free praise be to God Amen that's the spirit of the last days yes sir where people want everything he said they want Amazon to deliver their packages that's right they want daughters to deliver their food right they want God to deliver their religion preach it home and pray church God works by his program yes work by the program of man no sir hallelujah amen David said I was glad when they said unto me here yes sir let us go to the house Hallelujah [Applause] pray to my brother praise be to God yes sir that's the order of the Bible yes my brother you cannot change God's order no sir God works my atmosphere yes my brother when you come in the house of God the atmosphere yes because we live by an atmosphere yes sir God creates by an atmosphere yes my brother Hallelujah yes blessed is the men that walketh not in the castle of that Godly he shall be like a tree planted yes sir by the rivers of water yes my brother where are you planted tonight preacher are you planted in the world are you

Hallelujah glory to God how shall you stand with the Mighty Men of David if you can't even come to church how shall you stand with Arduino the as the night the Bible says he lifted up his Spear and he slew 800. at one time yes sir how shall you stand with eliasa the son of Dodo height when the people flipped Hallelujah yes sir the Bible says that he fought that until yes his hand was weary and his hand clarify to the swatter and God wrote a victory yes sir reminds me of a man yes sir who said my hand fit in the sword perfectly that's exactly right there Hallelujah yes sir how can you stand with the Mighty Men of death later all you have to do is not to kill 800 men no sir all you have to do is not to slay Giants no sir it's just to come to church yes sir that's what God is expecting you to do amen hallelujah glory to God I was in Tanzania I saw people that work for 10 miles preach my brother to come to church and to hear the gospel preacher just to hear one service hallelujah amen and

fought the Philistines and he defended the Garry sauna yes sir Hallelujah everyone fled he said why should we die for lentils to one scripture my brother preacher preacher why should we die for lentils no lintels are like Black Eyed Peas they don't have a value but Sharma said I would die defending the promise of God yes sir there is no promise that is so big there is no promise that is so little if it's God's word I'm Gonna Stand By God's plan amen and these were gentiles right Kelly the gastonites praise be to God yes the Gentiles yes Hallelujah and the Bible says that one time they were in they gathered to David in the time of the Harvest do you see that they came to death in the time of the Harvest at the cave of adulun and there was a troop of the Philistines and David looked across and says oh if only I could have the Waters of Bethlehem and the Gentiles he heard it yes my brother David wants them to come to church yes according to go to church yes we have to walk for 10
