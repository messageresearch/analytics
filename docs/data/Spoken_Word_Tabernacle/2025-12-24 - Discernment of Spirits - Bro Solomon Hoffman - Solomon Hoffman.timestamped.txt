[31:34] So I am very very happy
[31:38] about what the Lord about what the Lord
[31:41] is doing.
[31:43] So it was like two weeks before having
[31:48] all of this sermon. I keep having the
[31:51] same dream like I had the dream like
[31:53] three days one two three three days
[31:56] following one after the other one. The
[31:59] first time I saw myself walking on the
[32:01] road and as I was walking on the road,
[32:05] anytime I would make I I would make a
[32:07] step, they would deposit uh a a big sum
[32:11] of money on my side that I had to pick
[32:13] up. I would try to make another step,
[32:16] they put another uh another big amount
[32:19] of money on on my step. I'll be walking
[32:23] like that and I woke up for my dream. In
[32:25] the dream, I saw some of the people that
[32:27] I know. They were standing on the side
[32:30] and they were like, why only you? So,
[32:33] I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. I
[32:36] don't know what I'm going to do, but
[32:38] something keep telling me it's for you.
[32:40] You need to take it. Whenever we drop
[32:42] it, you take it. That was the the first
[32:45] time. The second time I saw again, I was
[32:49] going somewhere, they keep dropping that
[32:51] on my way. So then I I I woke up I say
[32:55] two time it means something. So I went I
[32:59] asked my my husband what's what is the
[33:02] meaning of money according to brother
[33:05] Brana?
[33:07] He say the money means the the p
[33:09] purchasing power purchase power. Okay
[33:13] thank you for helping me. The money
[33:16] means purchase power. So spiritually it
[33:20] means also faith. So I was like okay I
[33:24] think the Lord is dropping faith
[33:27] whenever we are moving on the the Lord
[33:29] is providing us sufficient faith to deal
[33:32] with our problem. So I take it in a
[33:35] spiritual way. I told the Lord I'm
[33:38] taking it that way. Then my husband came
[33:42] with uh a testimony here where a brother
[33:45] gave uh $18,000.
[33:49] Then some spoke to me. You see, it's not
[33:51] just spiritual.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; So that's why I was shouting there
[33:59] because my husband didn't tell me. I I
[34:01] heard the testimony here in church
[34:03] &gt;&gt; and before you know that again, he
[34:05] brought up another testimony, another
[34:07] someone say he want to send 5,000,
[34:10] another one also. So I went back to my
[34:14] bedroom where I pray and knelt down. I
[34:17] say Lord Jesus
[34:19] now I understood you are not speaking
[34:22] only spiritually as I was thinking is
[34:25] the both aspect spiritually and
[34:29] naturally naturally or I don't know how
[34:32] to say both way so I say Lord Jesus
[34:35] thank you so much right now I'm calling
[34:39] those spiritual blessings spiritual or
[34:42] financial I call them in the name of
[34:44] Jesus from the north from the south from
[34:47] the west I call them and I receive them
[34:50] in Jesus Christ's name
[34:52] &gt;&gt; because I know you have decided I don't
[34:55] have any choice but to receive
[34:57] &gt;&gt; because some then some something spoke
[35:00] to me what do you think about Solomon in
[35:02] the Bible because what Solomon had was
[35:05] just a dream the same way you had a
[35:08] dream so why you doubting so I'm like
[35:10] Lord forgive me I'm taking it I'm
[35:13] receiving in Jesus Christ's name
[35:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[35:15] &gt;&gt; coming to church when the pastor start
[35:17] preaching about the the parable of the
[35:20] 10 pound I understood how God would give
[35:23] us faith you know the 10 pound was f
[35:26] that's why I was rejoicing because the
[35:28] lord confirmed to me that it's
[35:31] spiritually and naturally so I thank God
[35:35] for that something else happened the
[35:37] same s this s last Sunday a couple came
[35:42] from uh uh Kentucky and if You remember
[35:46] the name of the brother? The brother was
[35:48] brother William Mariam and the sister
[35:51] was sister Addie and Addy, right? So
[35:54] when we went outside, the Lord confirmed
[35:57] to me, you heard the sermon, they told
[35:59] you about faith and everything. You see

[38:39] all of those men, Job, Father God, under
[38:41] the blood of the bows and goats, you did

[39:25] Father, but to be used, oh God. And we
[39:28] thank you for the the knowledge that
[39:30] you're giving us. Now help us, oh
[39:32] father, to use that knowledge, oh God,
[39:35] and to put it in practice, oh father

[39:49] together. We thank you for your
[39:51] presence, your fulfillment of your
[39:54] scripture where two or three would be

[1:00:15] Heat.
[1:00:19] [music and singing]
[1:00:21] Yeah.
[1:00:23] Heat. [music]
[1:00:26] [singing]
[1:00:29] [music]
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:00:43] [music]
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe he's here tonight.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of what the prophet said.
[1:00:52] He said that my message is to declare
[1:00:54] that he is here.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that powerful? The prophet
[1:00:59] didn't declare that he's coming and
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; a day in the future or that or that
[1:01:04] before he came, but uh the prophet's
[1:01:07] message come to declare that Christ is
[1:01:09] here.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if he's here, I believe all
[1:01:12] things are possible.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's here, he can do the
[1:01:16] impossible.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful for the
[1:01:19] revelation. And you know, people say,
[1:01:21] "Well, well, do you feel him? Do you see
[1:01:23] him?" I don't sometimes feel him and I
[1:01:25] don't see him, but I see him in his
[1:01:28] word.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And he said in his word that he would be
[1:01:31] here. And
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; and you know, brother talked about Mary.
[1:01:34] He said with Mary, she just took God at
[1:01:37] his word. And amen, God's word was
[1:01:39] enough for her.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And uh I believe that God's word's
[1:01:42] enough for me and you tonight.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless you tonight. Let's
[1:01:47] just bow our heads together and have a
[1:01:49] word of prayer before we would uh go to
[1:01:50] the word. And if you have a need upon
[1:01:53] your heart, just ask the Lord to come
[1:01:54] minister to you and uh just lift your
[1:01:57] hand before the Lord to show that you
[1:01:59] would have a need. Father, Lord, we're
[1:02:01] so honored to be able to call you that,
[1:02:03] Lord. And Lord, it's by revelation to
[1:02:06] know that we came out of the eternities,
[1:02:08] Lord. And one day we'll go back to where
[1:02:10] we come from, Father. Lord, as Abraham
[1:02:14] uh was looking for that bu that that
[1:02:16] city whose builder and maker was God.
[1:02:18] Truly, Lord, we're looking for that same
[1:02:20] city. And Lord, we believe that by
[1:02:22] faith, Abraham, he sojourned in a
[1:02:25] strange land. And truly, we're here
[1:02:27] tonight, Lord, sojouring in a strange
[1:02:29] land. This world is not our home, but
[1:02:32] Lord, we are looking for that same great
[1:02:34] city, Father. And Lord, we just pray
[1:02:37] this evening, Lord, that the the king of
[1:02:39] that city would come. And Lord, you
[1:02:42] would be here in our midst, Father. We
[1:02:44] we don't want to just welcome you to
[1:02:46] come or ask you to come. But Lord, we we
[1:02:48] want to make you feel welcome, Lord. We
[1:02:50] want you to be comfortable, Father, to
[1:02:53] move in our midst, Lord. And may you
[1:02:55] just have your will and your way,
[1:02:57] Father. May you just search us, Lord,
[1:02:59] and try us. And Lord, discern the
[1:03:01] thoughts and intents of our heart, Lord,
[1:03:03] and see if there be any evil thing in
[1:03:05] us, Lord. And if you find anything, may
[1:03:08] you just cut it out by that sharp
[1:03:10] two-edged sword of your word.
[1:03:14] Lord, we just give you preeminence in
[1:03:16] this service. I ask you that you would
[1:03:18] heal the sick and the afflicted,
[1:03:20] encourage the discouraged. Lord, I
[1:03:22] believe that you can so curate this
[1:03:24] service, Father, that you can speak to
[1:03:27] every individual here, Lord. Maybe
[1:03:29] someone disappointed or discouraged. May
[1:03:31] you minister to that person's life this
[1:03:33] evening, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[1:03:36] would just help me to get out of your
[1:03:37] way. You know, Lord, the only gift I
[1:03:39] have is to surrender to you. I'm asking
[1:03:42] for your help tonight, Lord. May you
[1:03:44] help your children to just put off the
[1:03:46] things of tomorrow and and what they've
[1:03:48] got going on today and may they just
[1:03:50] pull up to the table as it were and
[1:03:52] begin to hear what the spirit would say
[1:03:54] to them.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just give everything into your
[1:03:57] hands. We pray you'd help us now as we
[1:03:59] look to your word. We pray in Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ's name. Amen. And amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God richly bless you this
[1:04:07] evening. Uh if you have your Bibles,
[1:04:08] I'll just go and invite you to be uh
[1:04:10] turning in in the scripture. Uh two
[1:04:13] places I'd like to read the first place
[1:04:15] in 2 Kings the 6th chapter as well as uh
[1:04:18] 2 Corinthians. As you're turning there,
[1:04:20] I just want to be sure and greet you the
[1:04:22] name of the Lord tonight and greet you
[1:04:24] from our pastor, brother Josh Bennett.
[1:04:26] He certainly loves you and appreciates
[1:04:28] you. Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And um as Stephen mentioned just
[1:04:31] briefly, I was just in Africa uh for
[1:04:33] about a week to 10 days. And um I was
[1:04:37] just sharing with him, I was in uh a
[1:04:39] city there in Kenya, Africa, and I had
[1:04:41] many people coming up to me saying, "Are
[1:04:43] you brother Solomon?" I'm like, "Yeah, I
[1:04:45] am." We we know exactly who you are.
[1:04:47] Like how do you how do you know who I
[1:04:49] am? You never met me before. They're
[1:04:51] like, "Well, you do you know Brother
[1:04:52] Shimbo?" I'm like, "Absolutely." Like we
[1:04:54] watch Brother Shimbo's sermons all the
[1:04:57] time.
[1:04:58] and they said, "We're so blessed by that
[1:05:00] church and their worship and the
[1:05:02] ministry." And I was just very uh proud.
[1:05:05] I thought, "My, there's fruits of this
[1:05:06] ministry uh on a 30-hour journey on the
[1:05:10] other side of the world." And uh it was
[1:05:12] such a tremendous blessing and and those
[1:05:15] people, they uh they're hungry for the
[1:05:17] word
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; and they're hungry for the word to be
[1:05:19] preached straight.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh not not not watered down,
[1:05:24] not not compromised, not anything like
[1:05:27] that. And I think that's what we need
[1:05:29] more of. And we just need people just to
[1:05:32] preach the word. And amen, just like the
[1:05:35] prophet preached it. And and you know,
[1:05:38] uh the the people there were just
[1:05:39] tremendously blessed. And they told me
[1:05:42] when I came back here, they said, "Be
[1:05:43] sure and greet that church for me and
[1:05:45] tell them how much we how much we
[1:05:47] appreciate them." So I wanted to be sure
[1:05:49] and do that for them. and they send
[1:05:51] their love and support and prayers and I
[1:05:54] just want you to know you're a great
[1:05:55] blessing to a portion of the bride on
[1:05:58] other side of the world and I think
[1:06:00] that's a great honor to be a part of
[1:06:01] that. So
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; uh may God bless them and bless you this
[1:06:05] evening. Let's read here together
[1:06:07] [clears throat] I don't want to prolong
[1:06:08] the service very much but here in 2
[1:06:11] Kings the 6th chapter
[1:06:14] uh begin reading at the 8th verse
[1:06:15] familiar scripture to us. The Bible
[1:06:17] says, "Then the king of Syria wared
[1:06:20] against Israel and took counsel with his
[1:06:22] servant, saying, In such and such a
[1:06:25] place shall be my camp."
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And the man of God sent unto the king of
[1:06:29] Israel, saying, "Beware that thou pass
[1:06:32] not such a place, for thither the
[1:06:34] Syrians are come down." And the king of
[1:06:36] Israel sent to the place which the man
[1:06:38] of God told him and warned him of, and
[1:06:41] saved himself there, not once nor twice.
[1:06:45] Notice the scripture. And therefore, the
[1:06:47] heart of the king of Syria was so
[1:06:50] troubled for this thing.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, he he's so troubled.
[1:06:54] He's saying, "Who's the traitor?" And
[1:06:56] and who's who's given away our plans?
[1:06:59] And he called his servants and said unto
[1:07:01] them, "Will you not show me which of us
[1:07:03] is for the king of Israel?" And one of
[1:07:06] his servants said, "None, my lord, O
[1:07:08] king, but Elisha, the prophet that is in
[1:07:11] Israel. He tellth the king of Israel the
[1:07:15] words that thou speakest in thy bed
[1:07:17] chamber.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful scripture.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; In in 2 Corinthians the 2 chapter and
[1:07:26] the 11th verse.
[1:07:30] The Bible says, "Lest Satan should get
[1:07:33] an advantage of us."
[1:07:35] Lest Satan should get an advantage of
[1:07:37] us, for we are not ignorant of his
[1:07:40] devices. That's right.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask God to bless his word
[1:07:44] and you can be seated this evening.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And from these scriptures, I want to
[1:07:48] draw a subject of discernment of
[1:07:50] spirits.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Discernment of spirits. And I'm
[1:07:53] sure you're familiar. Brother Brandon
[1:07:55] preached that sermon titled exactly
[1:07:57] that. And uh he preached on discernment
[1:07:59] of spirits and said a lot of great
[1:08:01] powerful things about it. And I think as
[1:08:04] believers, the prophet taught us, he
[1:08:06] said that we are ordered by God to
[1:08:09] discern the spirit of everything. Now,
[1:08:12] now, now sometimes you got to slow down
[1:08:14] and re-evaluate and think about it. But,
[1:08:17] uh, we're called as the bride of Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ to stop a minute and discern the
[1:08:22] spirit of what what's the spirit
[1:08:24] motivating this? What's the spirit
[1:08:26] motivating that? because uh something
[1:08:29] may seem innocent, but there's a bad
[1:08:31] spirit behind it. So, you're called to
[1:08:34] discern the spirit. And then when you
[1:08:37] discern it, it's up to you. What do you
[1:08:39] do after you discern it? So, if you've
[1:08:42] discerned something as the prophet's
[1:08:44] telling us, if you discern something and
[1:08:46] realize, hey, this is not of God, then
[1:08:49] we are called by God to get get away
[1:08:52] from that thing. So, amen. We know as
[1:08:54] the bride of Christ that we are called
[1:08:56] to discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:09:00] spirit. And you know, I just appreciate
[1:09:02] how simple brother Random made things
[1:09:04] because uh he never he never put some
[1:09:07] kind of gray line. But but it was always
[1:09:10] there's only two spirits that work
[1:09:12] within the framework of the Christian
[1:09:14] church and there's only two spirits in
[1:09:16] the world today. Now, now I know a lot
[1:09:19] of people they try to blur that, but
[1:09:21] there's only two spirits that influence
[1:09:24] absolutely everything in the world.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And everything you face in a Christian
[1:09:30] life, it's being either influenced by
[1:09:32] God or by the devil. Now, now what does
[1:09:36] the devil come along to do? He tries to
[1:09:38] say, well, you know, that's not
[1:09:40] alltogether bad and that's not
[1:09:42] alltogether good. And so that's how the
[1:09:44] devil works is because amen, the
[1:09:47] prophet's so clear on it. He said the
[1:09:49] way the devil works is through
[1:09:50] shrewdness and he comes in so subtle and
[1:09:54] so little and you think well you know
[1:09:57] it's it's altogether not that bad but
[1:10:00] it's altogether not that good. And so
[1:10:02] you got to ask yourself is this thing of
[1:10:05] God or is this thing of the devil? Amen.
[1:10:08] And see, the prophet said that we are
[1:10:10] called to discern the spirit and see
[1:10:14] what is the spirit of the thing. Amen.
[1:10:17] The Bible talked about to try the
[1:10:19] spirits. Now, now, now it's
[1:10:21] uncomfortable to do it, but you're
[1:10:23] demanded to do it by the scripture.
[1:10:26] Amen. Try the spirit and see is that of
[1:10:30] God or is that not of God. And so we see
[1:10:34] here in the scripture that Elisha, he
[1:10:37] was a prophet, he was a seer and he
[1:10:39] would see into another realm. He would
[1:10:42] see into the future. And he would see uh
[1:10:45] the plans of the Syrian army before
[1:10:48] those plans was even, if I could say it
[1:10:50] this way, he saw in the beginning stages
[1:10:53] of what the plans were going to be a
[1:10:56] year down the road or or or next week,
[1:10:59] how the Syrian army was going to attack.
[1:11:01] And Elisha knew exactly, hey, they're
[1:11:04] going to come down this valley and
[1:11:05] they're going to come down this hill.
[1:11:07] And so the prophet would tell the
[1:11:09] children of Israel, don't go to such and
[1:11:11] such a place and don't go here and don't
[1:11:13] go here. Now, if if Israel was spiritual
[1:11:17] enough, they would listen to what the
[1:11:19] prophet said. Because you got to realize
[1:11:22] that prophet had eyesight that they
[1:11:24] didn't know anything about. And he was
[1:11:27] seeing something into the future. Amen.
[1:11:31] see a prophet and and to me and you
[1:11:33] we're seeing it's so infant and it's so
[1:11:36] small and it's so little but the prophet
[1:11:39] is seeing something in infancy but yet
[1:11:42] he's seeing it in maturity at the same
[1:11:45] time and you'll realize brother Brandham
[1:11:48] said he said destroy your enemy before
[1:11:52] your enemy destroys you and so you'll
[1:11:55] realize that that's exactly how the
[1:11:58] enemy works is he starts out something
[1:12:01] so small and so little. But you got to
[1:12:04] understand, a little problem turns into
[1:12:07] a big problem if it's left unattended.
[1:12:12] A little spirit turns into a big spirit
[1:12:15] unless it's unattended.
[1:12:17] Is that right? Amen. A small spirit of
[1:12:20] lust turns into divorce if it's left
[1:12:23] unattended.
[1:12:25] That's exactly right. Listen, sister.
[1:12:27] You got to deal with something when it's
[1:12:30] small. If you don't, I mean, why in the
[1:12:33] world would you wait till you got stage
[1:12:35] four cancer, [laughter]
[1:12:37] when you can get rid of it while it's
[1:12:39] manageable? Why would we want to wait
[1:12:42] till it's so progressed that they say
[1:12:43] it's terminal and there's no help. But
[1:12:46] see, a true spiritual person would deal
[1:12:49] with something at the beginning of it.
[1:12:52] Yes, sir.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And so we realize that we're called to
[1:12:55] deal with stuff before it grows up.
[1:12:57] We're we're called to discern that
[1:13:00] spirit and stop it. I mean, let me tell
[1:13:03] you, the enemy is a real enemy.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And he don't want what's best for you.
[1:13:08] All he wants to do is to kill, steal,
[1:13:11] and destroy. Amen. He's the friend
[1:13:14] that'll convince you to do something,
[1:13:16] then go call the cops on you while
[1:13:18] you're doing it. That's the kind of
[1:13:20] enemy that we're serving. He He
[1:13:22] convinced you to go rob a bank and then
[1:13:24] call the cops on you. Is that right?
[1:13:28] That's the kind of enemy that you and I
[1:13:30] are up against. Listen. Amen. He don't
[1:13:33] want what's best for you. He wants to
[1:13:34] destroy you. And unless you realize it's
[1:13:38] him working, he'll do just that.
[1:13:41] And so the prophet would see the tactics
[1:13:44] of that Syrian army and he would
[1:13:46] constantly reveal these tactics and and
[1:13:50] he did it in such a way that the literal
[1:13:52] king of Syria said if there's got to be
[1:13:54] a traitor that's amongst us because
[1:13:57] every time we go to do something, they
[1:14:00] know exactly what we're going to do.
[1:14:02] Every time we try to go hit here and hit
[1:14:05] here, they know exactly what we're where
[1:14:08] we're going to hit, how we're going to
[1:14:10] fight, what we're going to do. And
[1:14:12] that's the way it ought to be with you
[1:14:13] and I, brother, sister. Amen. We know
[1:14:16] the tactics of the enemy because God has
[1:14:19] sent us a prophet like an unto Elisha.
[1:14:22] And when the devil comes in here and the
[1:14:24] devil comes in here, we say, "Devil, I
[1:14:27] see that you working. That is not my
[1:14:30] brother. That is not my sister, but that
[1:14:33] is a spirit. Amen. Even Jesus himself
[1:14:37] had to rebuke his disciple Peter.
[1:14:40] Yes, sir.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Let me just preach here for a moment.
[1:14:44] Because he had Peter and Peter was
[1:14:46] trying to get Jesus to go against the
[1:14:48] word. Is that right? And he said,
[1:14:50] "Peter, I rebuke you, Satan. Get be."
[1:14:53] Could you imagine
[1:14:55] who Satan? I'm your disciple.
[1:14:57] [screaming]
[1:14:58] What do you mean, Satan? He said,
[1:15:00] "You're being influenced by Satan."
[1:15:04] Peter, you don't mean to say that. You
[1:15:07] don't mean to talk like that, but you're
[1:15:09] being influenced by an evil spirit.
[1:15:12] [screaming] And I'm not influ And I'm
[1:15:14] not ignorant of Satan's devices. You got
[1:15:16] to realize the devil will use your
[1:15:19] family. The devil will use your spouse.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; The devil will use the people in the
[1:15:26] church. He'll use whoever he can use to
[1:15:31] influence. I'm not saying they're the
[1:15:32] devil. I'm saying they're being
[1:15:34] influenced by that spirit. And the
[1:15:37] prophet said if the devil can get us
[1:15:39] fighting against one another, he could
[1:15:42] just sit there and fold his arms because
[1:15:45] we're doing the devil's work. Amen. I
[1:15:48] think it's a shame, brother, sister.
[1:15:51] Amen. When we're fighting against
[1:15:52] brother and we're fighting against
[1:15:54] sister, the devil just sits there and
[1:15:57] lets us fight and lets us war and he's
[1:16:00] just laughing, sitting in hell. See, I
[1:16:03] didn't even have to do what he's saying
[1:16:05] because he's talking against him and
[1:16:08] he's talking against the pastor and
[1:16:12] well, is that the truth this evening?
[1:16:15] He's doing this and he's and you don't
[1:16:17] realize that you're doing the work of
[1:16:19] the devil and the devil's just sitting
[1:16:22] back while you're destroying one another
[1:16:25] and destroying each other's character.
[1:16:27] [screaming] Listen, don't you be a
[1:16:29] mouthpiece for the devil. You be a
[1:16:32] mouthpiece for God himself. Don't you be
[1:16:35] influenced by the God of this evil age,
[1:16:38] but you be influenced by the real and
[1:16:41] living God.
[1:16:46] Well, I just speak what comes to my
[1:16:48] mind. That ain't always good. Well, I
[1:16:50] just speak what I think. That ain't
[1:16:52] always good. Well, that's just who I am.
[1:16:55] [screaming] Well, maybe that's not what
[1:16:56] you should be. You ought to run
[1:16:58] everything you think by the word. You
[1:17:01] ought to run everything you say by the
[1:17:04] word. The Bible tells us that death and
[1:17:07] life [screaming] are in the power of the
[1:17:09] tongue. And you're pronouncing death.
[1:17:12] and you're pronouncing all of these
[1:17:14] things and you wonder why you're
[1:17:16] discouraged and you're defeated. It's
[1:17:18] because you pronounced it on yourself.
[1:17:22] You spoke it on yourself and you're
[1:17:25] manifesting it yourself. [screaming]
[1:17:27] Amen. Do you realize there's so much
[1:17:29] power in what you speak?
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it matters. Well,
[1:17:34] according to the word, it does. Why do
[1:17:36] you think when God told Moses when Moses
[1:17:39] is complaining, "Well, God, I don't know
[1:17:41] about this and I don't know about this."
[1:17:43] And God said, "Why cry, Moses, speak?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Why cry, Moses, speak?" And we say,
[1:17:50] "Well, you know, we've got power to
[1:17:52] speak a world and go live on." Listen,
[1:17:55] I'm not concerned about speaking another
[1:17:57] earth and going and living on it, but I
[1:17:59] want to speak my own earth right here
[1:18:01] today. I want to live in my own
[1:18:04] atmosphere. Do you realize you're
[1:18:06] [screaming] an amateur creator? Do you
[1:18:09] realize the Bible said that ye are
[1:18:11] [screaming] gods?
[1:18:14] You've got the power to change the
[1:18:16] situation. You got the power to change
[1:18:18] your environment. You've got the power
[1:18:21] as the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[1:18:24] problem of it is is you're poor in your
[1:18:27] mind. That's why you're poor in your
[1:18:29] spirit. But my father, he owns the
[1:18:32] cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:18:35] Oh, praise the Lord. You're not poor,
[1:18:37] you're rich. You're not sick, you're
[1:18:40] healed.
[1:18:41] [cheering]
[1:18:42] It's the truth, brother. Amen. It's the
[1:18:45] word that's in your mouth, and it's what
[1:18:48] you pronounce, and it's what you say.
[1:18:51] I'm saying the job is on the way. I'm
[1:18:54] saying the check is on the way.
[1:18:58] But brother, I don't know [screaming]
[1:18:59] about all that, but I do know about that
[1:19:01] because my God is Jehovah Gyra. Amen. My
[1:19:05] God is Jehovah Rafa. He's everything I
[1:19:08] have need of financially
[1:19:11] with my family, with my church. He's got
[1:19:15] everything I [screaming] need and he's
[1:19:18] waiting on me to believe for it.
[1:19:22] Amen. The problem why people don't get
[1:19:24] nothing is because they don't believe
[1:19:26] for it. They don't believe God can give
[1:19:29] them a job. They don't [screaming]
[1:19:30] believe God can restore their marriage.
[1:19:32] They don't believe God can do it. And so
[1:19:35] it never [screaming] happens to them.
[1:19:37] But to those that believe that God is
[1:19:39] concerned about the detail, let me tell
[1:19:42] you, God is concerned about the detail
[1:19:45] of your life. The place that you work,
[1:19:47] the place you go to school, the living
[1:19:50] that you got, God is concerned about it.
[1:19:54] You got to have discernment of spirit
[1:19:56] enough to realize
[1:19:58] God is concerned about it. It's the
[1:20:01] devil is telling you don't ask God. It's
[1:20:04] the devil is telling you, "Oh, that's
[1:20:06] too impossible. [screaming] Oh, that's
[1:20:08] too you think God is telling you that."
[1:20:12] You think God is telling you, "Don't
[1:20:15] don't bother me with that. [screaming]
[1:20:16] Don't ask me about that. I What do you
[1:20:19] think I am?" Amen. The prophet said
[1:20:22] directly, "God wants to be bothered."
[1:20:26] That's a direct quote. God wants to be
[1:20:29] bothered. Hey, [screaming] you bothering
[1:20:31] everybody else. Why don't you bother God
[1:20:33] about your job? Why don't you bother God
[1:20:36] about your family? Why don't you bother
[1:20:38] God about your situation?
[1:20:41] Well, let's just preach for a moment.
[1:20:43] Why don't you stop bothering the pastor
[1:20:45] and bothering this and bothering that
[1:20:47] and go to the throne of God and say,
[1:20:50] "God, I've got a need." And you said
[1:20:53] that you will [screaming] provide all.
[1:20:56] You'll provide all of my needs.
[1:21:01] What kind of God do you serve?
[1:21:03] [screaming] I don't serve a little God.
[1:21:05] I serve a big God. I don't serve a
[1:21:08] halfway God. I serve a big God.
[1:21:12] How big is your God? My God is big
[1:21:15] enough.
[1:21:17] Every need I got, every situation I got,
[1:21:21] my God is big enough.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it this afternoon. My God's
[1:21:31] big enough. He can handle it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; But you got to believe it.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You got to believe it.
[1:21:44] You got to believe that God can do it.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Was that all right?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] Have you ever thought about it? What
[1:21:55] spirit is it that's telling you don't go
[1:21:57] to God over that?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; What spirit is it? Amen. Have
[1:22:02] discernment of spirit. What spirit is it
[1:22:05] that's telling you that God can't bless
[1:22:07] you in that way? [cheering]
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; That don't ask God about that. Listen,
[1:22:12] I'm telling you, brother, sister, I
[1:22:14] believe we got everything we need in the
[1:22:16] word of God.
[1:22:18] I mean everything
[1:22:21] in this message. Everything.
[1:22:23] I believe the question for the young
[1:22:25] people is in the message. I believe the
[1:22:28] questions of your marriage is in the
[1:22:29] message. I believe where you ought to
[1:22:32] work is in the message. I believe the
[1:22:34] right mental attitude is in the message.
[1:22:37] I believe how you ought to raise your
[1:22:39] children is in the message.
[1:22:41] I believe God gave us everything we
[1:22:44] need. Now, if you don't believe that, I
[1:22:46] just can't help you. But it's what I
[1:22:48] believe. I believe we've got everything
[1:22:51] we need. Why in the world would I go
[1:22:54] seeking after something, Amen, some
[1:22:56] psychologist or or this here or this
[1:22:59] here or or
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; this program or this program? Amen. Have
[1:23:04] you ever tried the Lord?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Have you ever tried the
[1:23:12] Lord?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Well, you tried Indeed. You tried Zip
[1:23:16] Recruit.
[1:23:18] You've tried Walmart.com.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; You've tried this. You've tried that.
[1:23:23] Have you ever tried the Lord? [cheering]
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried the Lord? I've been
[1:23:30] there where I didn't have a job lined up
[1:23:32] and I watched God come on the scene and
[1:23:34] give me job after job after job. Amen.
[1:23:38] And the fact of the matter is this is I
[1:23:41] got pushed into a corner to where I had
[1:23:43] [screaming] nowhere to turn but God. But
[1:23:46] you don't got to be pushed into a
[1:23:48] corner. [screaming] Amen. If you got
[1:23:50] faith enough, you can ask God right now.
[1:23:55] Oh, hallelujah. I said you can ask God
[1:23:58] right now. You don't have to wait for
[1:24:01] the interview. You can ask God right
[1:24:03] now. [screaming]
[1:24:04] Lord, I need you to provide for me and
[1:24:07] for my family.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; What's the truth this evening?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I believe God's got it. Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to have discernment of
[1:24:22] spirit.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll realize that that that
[1:24:28] that Elisha here in the Bible that that
[1:24:31] he knew more about the situation than
[1:24:34] Israel did.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's why they went to Elisha. Elisha,
[1:24:39] where's the enemy going to come and
[1:24:40] how's it going to be? [screaming] All
[1:24:42] right. All right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Why in the world would you go somewhere
[1:24:45] else when you've got a
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Why would you go somewhere else when you
[1:24:51] got a vindicated prophet's message that
[1:24:55] is ordained to lead you and guide you
[1:24:58] all the way through. [cheering]
[1:25:01] Listen, this ain't a message to leave us
[1:25:03] in the wilderness. This is a message to
[1:25:06] bring us to the promised land.
[1:25:07] [screaming]
[1:25:08] [cheering]
[1:25:09] This ain't just a message of Moses come
[1:25:11] out of her. It's a message of Joshua as
[1:25:14] well. It's a dual ministry. It's a
[1:25:17] Joshua come out of her my people. And
[1:25:21] it's a Moses go into the fullness of the
[1:25:24] promise of God.
[1:25:26] That's what this message was sent to do.
[1:25:29] Amen. To bring us out of the [screaming]
[1:25:30] world and then out of the church. Well,
[1:25:34] it's just the truth. You are the called
[1:25:36] out of the called out of the called out
[1:25:39] and you are called to go all the way in
[1:25:42] into the fullness of the word of God.
[1:25:46] Amen. How long are we going to walk
[1:25:48] around the mountain? How long are we
[1:25:50] going to ramble in the wilderness? We've
[1:25:52] been given a message to go all the way
[1:25:56] into the promise. But there's a provided
[1:25:59] way to do it. There's a right way to do
[1:26:01] it. Listen, [laughter]
[1:26:04] there's only one way, brother, sister.
[1:26:06] You ain't going to obtain rapturing
[1:26:08] faith out here in the world.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You're not going to
[1:26:13] obtain rapturing faith by by some other
[1:26:16] message. But our message was given to us
[1:26:19] to bring rapturing faith. You do you
[1:26:22] realize it takes a perfect word to bring
[1:26:24] perfect faith? And listen, this message
[1:26:27] is perfect.
[1:26:29] It's a perfect word that produces
[1:26:32] perfect faith and it's producing a
[1:26:34] perfect bride.
[1:26:36] How are we being perfected? We're being
[1:26:39] perfected by the word.
[1:26:42] Praise the Lord. I say we're being
[1:26:44] perfected by the word. You said, "Well,
[1:26:47] I don't see a lot happening." Every
[1:26:49] sermon that you hear, it is perfecting
[1:26:52] you and it's causing a perfection to
[1:26:55] come over your life.
[1:27:00] That's exactly the truth. [applause]
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we we understand here that
[1:27:05] that the prophet knew more about the
[1:27:08] situation. If I can say it this way.
[1:27:10] Amen. Like your parents growing up and
[1:27:12] they told you don't touch the pot on the
[1:27:14] stove. The pot is hot.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And many of us we needed to get a
[1:27:20] greater revelation that it was hot.
[1:27:23] But what do they know? I'm going to go
[1:27:25] touch the pot anyhow. And then you got
[1:27:28] burned and you said and you cry. Why are
[1:27:30] you crying for? You knew better.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You knew better.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the prophet forbade something
[1:27:40] and said to stay away from that, why in
[1:27:43] the world would you want to get remotely
[1:27:45] close? Listen, can I tell you this? This
[1:27:48] is not the hour to see how close to the
[1:27:50] world you can walk.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach for a moment.
[1:27:54] This is not the hour to see what you can
[1:27:56] get away with, how close to the line you
[1:27:59] can walk. I don't know about you, but I
[1:28:02] don't want to be driving here at the
[1:28:04] cliff's edge. I want to be driving
[1:28:06] hugging the hugging the mountain.
[1:28:10] I want to be driving hugging the
[1:28:12] mountain. Well, you know, I'm a skilled
[1:28:14] enough driver that I can I can drive
[1:28:17] right where the cliff is. No, you're
[1:28:18] just a dumb driver. You're not skilled
[1:28:21] because you drive here at the edge where
[1:28:23] the cliff is. Amen. You're just cocky
[1:28:25] your mind and think you'll get away with
[1:28:27] it. Amen. But see, to the true church of
[1:28:29] the living God, we don't want to see how
[1:28:32] close to sin we can get. We want to see
[1:28:36] how close to God can I possibly walk?
[1:28:39] How close to this man? I don't know
[1:28:41] about you, but that's my revelation. Why
[1:28:44] do I want to see how close to the world
[1:28:46] I can walk and still remain bride? I
[1:28:49] want to see, Lord, how close to your
[1:28:51] word [screaming] can I walk and still
[1:28:53] remain on earth?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How close to the word can I
[1:28:59] walk without being raptured yet? Let me
[1:29:02] tell you, one day there's going to be a
[1:29:04] rapture.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; One day there'll be I still believe in
[1:29:08] that. Do you? One day there'll be the
[1:29:10] change of our bodies. Amen. And I've got
[1:29:12] discernment enough to tell you that day
[1:29:14] is coming here soon. If it ain't
[1:29:16] tomorrow, it'll be the next day. Amen.
[1:29:19] Listen, you [laughter] I'm looking for
[1:29:21] it. I'm looking for the change of my
[1:29:24] body. Amen. I've got discernment enough
[1:29:26] to see the the the the signs of the time
[1:29:29] and the conditions of this world. And it
[1:29:32] can't last much longer. And I can't
[1:29:35] wait, brother, sister. Amen. To where
[1:29:37] this this mortality takes on
[1:29:39] immortality. I cannot wait till I get a
[1:29:42] body to match my soul. My soul has
[1:29:45] already been redeemed. This is the
[1:29:48] season of rapture.
[1:29:51] It's the season of rapture. Amen. And to
[1:29:54] those that believe it, they preach about
[1:29:56] it. They talk about it. They think about
[1:29:59] it. To the people that don't believe in
[1:30:01] it, they don't preach it.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; They don't think about it. They don't
[1:30:06] talk about it. But to the people that
[1:30:08] believe it, they're thought they're
[1:30:10] they're they're talking about it.
[1:30:11] They're thinking about it. Amen. Listen,
[1:30:14] I can't wait for it, brother, sister.
[1:30:15] Amen. I can't wait to see the Lord that
[1:30:18] saved me. I can't wait to I believe in a
[1:30:20] literal returning as the prophet said of
[1:30:24] Jesus Christ. I can't wait to behold him
[1:30:27] and embrace him. I can't wait to see the
[1:30:30] Lord that saved me. I can't wait to see
[1:30:33] the Lord that snatched me out of the
[1:30:35] fire. I can't wait to see him that has
[1:30:38] done great things. And I believe one day
[1:30:42] soon. Amen. Right now, I'm feeling the
[1:30:44] effects of him. Amen. Remember, there's
[1:30:46] coming a day there'll be a literal
[1:30:48] returning of our Lord again. And when we
[1:30:52] see him, [screaming] we will be like
[1:30:54] him. We'll have a body like is under his
[1:30:58] glorious [screaming] body. But I'm not
[1:31:01] waiting to get a new body before I
[1:31:04] worship my king. I'm not [screaming]
[1:31:06] waiting to get a new body before I give
[1:31:08] him the glory that he's deserving of.
[1:31:11] But [screaming] right now in this past
[1:31:13] house, my lungs will give glory and
[1:31:16] honor unto my God. My feet will dance,
[1:31:20] my hands will [screaming] live. While
[1:31:22] I'm trapped in this body, I will still
[1:31:24] give him what is rightfully his.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, when folks say, "Oh, brother, you
[1:31:31] know, when I got no more problems, I
[1:31:33] really worship God." No, you won't. If
[1:31:36] you won't worship God in your situation,
[1:31:38] you won't worship God out of it. If you
[1:31:41] won't worship God while you're sick. You
[1:31:43] won't worship God when you're healthy.
[1:31:45] If you won't worship God when everything
[1:31:47] ain't going your way. You won't worship
[1:31:49] God when it is.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the truth.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You've got to have discernment.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I'm getting pulled everywhere. I'm
[1:32:03] trying to get somewhere. The the the the
[1:32:07] prophet told a story. He told a story of
[1:32:10] a mechanic was out there working on a
[1:32:12] vehicle in in the garage and and that
[1:32:15] man was working and and and the prophet
[1:32:17] said, "Here come a a man that was
[1:32:19] well-dressed. He walked up and looked at
[1:32:20] him a few moments." He said to the
[1:32:22] mechanic after he he let him butt his
[1:32:24] head for a little while. He said, "Why
[1:32:27] don't you just touch this here because
[1:32:30] you're not getting any current?"
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And he turned around and said, "Well,
[1:32:34] who are you?" He said, "You know who it
[1:32:36] was? It was the chief engineer of
[1:32:39] General Motors. He made the vehicle. He
[1:32:42] designed it.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. See what it was. This man was here
[1:32:47] working on this vehicle and he tried
[1:32:49] this and he tried that and he tried this
[1:32:52] and he tried that and nothing was
[1:32:55] working for him. He just couldn't come
[1:32:57] to victory. [laughter]
[1:32:59] Oh, glory. He couldn't come to victory
[1:33:02] and he couldn't get it to start. And the
[1:33:05] chief engineer of General Motors, he
[1:33:07] says, "See, the issue of it is is you're
[1:33:09] not getting any current."
[1:33:12] You ever been there? You're not getting
[1:33:14] any current. He said, "But if you'll
[1:33:17] touch this here," he said, then it'll
[1:33:20] start back up. And do you realize that's
[1:33:23] what the prophet's ministry come to do?
[1:33:25] Because the church wasn't getting any
[1:33:27] current.
[1:33:29] Hallelujah. The church wasn't getting
[1:33:32] any current. Oh, sure. Sure, it could
[1:33:34] shout a little bit. Sure, it could say
[1:33:36] amen a little bit, but it could not
[1:33:39] overcome and it could not go down the
[1:33:41] road. And the prophet says here, he said
[1:33:44] where they failed is they got away from
[1:33:48] the Holy Ghost and they got away from
[1:33:51] the dynamics of the Holy [screaming]
[1:33:53] Ghost. Let me tell you, I don't care how
[1:33:56] revelated we get. You've got to have
[1:33:59] [screaming] the dynamics of the Holy
[1:34:02] Ghost to make the word live in your
[1:34:04] life.
[1:34:06] There ain't nothing wrong with you. You
[1:34:08] just need the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You don't got a problem. You need the
[1:34:13] Holy Ghost.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? You ain't got some
[1:34:18] issue wrong with you. Ain't nothing
[1:34:20] wrong with the vehicle you're in. You
[1:34:22] just got to have the quickening power of
[1:34:25] the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You got to have the
[1:34:30] quickening power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:32] Amen. And see, we've got I think it's
[1:34:34] such a powerful quote here the prophet's
[1:34:36] talking about. He said there was a man
[1:34:38] that came up. It was the engineer
[1:34:40] General Motor. He designed it. He knew
[1:34:42] about it.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why God sent us this message.
[1:34:47] Amen. And took the prophet into that
[1:34:49] realm of spirits. Amen. So he could I
[1:34:52] think some of the most powerful messages
[1:34:53] is demonology in the physical and
[1:34:56] demonology in the spiritual. The prophet
[1:34:57] breaks it down. If you had to listen to
[1:35:00] them and be very encouraging to listen
[1:35:01] to because the prophet's breaking down
[1:35:03] and show them that we're all affected in
[1:35:05] a spirit realm.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And he said the flesh body when you've
[1:35:09] got an element in the body and a
[1:35:11] sickness in the body. He said what it
[1:35:13] actually is is there's a spirit in there
[1:35:16] and that spirit is holding that nerve.
[1:35:20] And so that pain is caused by
[1:35:22] [screaming] a spirit. And see what the
[1:35:25] devil does is he comes to you and say,
[1:35:27] "Well, you know, it ain't it ain't
[1:35:28] really me. It's just your body. It's
[1:35:31] just your just your sick. That's how the
[1:35:34] devil works in." He said, "You're just
[1:35:36] in a fallen body. You just got to deal
[1:35:38] with it. You You just got to live in
[1:35:41] this condition." And all the while, it
[1:35:44] is a spirit that's coming to your mind.
[1:35:47] And if he gets you to believe that it's
[1:35:50] not him and that it's not a spirit, then
[1:35:54] he's got you beat and you'll be living
[1:35:57] with that condition. And you'll be
[1:35:59] coping with that condition because you
[1:36:02] think it's got to stay that way. But I'm
[1:36:04] here to tell you, you don't got to cope
[1:36:06] with the condition. You don't got to
[1:36:08] cope with the devil. You don't got to
[1:36:11] cope with a problem. But there was a God
[1:36:13] here. [screaming] There was the light of
[1:36:15] God. and he can drive away every spirit
[1:36:19] of darkness that wants to hold
[1:36:21] [screaming] you bound.
[1:36:24] Oh, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:26] That devil that tries to bind you in
[1:36:27] your spirit. That devil that tries to
[1:36:29] bind you in your mind and he comes
[1:36:32] against you and tries to bind you in
[1:36:34] your body. There is a God here that can
[1:36:37] drive away any spirit in hell.
[1:36:42] [applause]
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirits of tiredness.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; There was a sister I heard one time,
[1:36:54] I'll share this with you. A sister I
[1:36:56] heard one time she she kept on coming to
[1:36:58] church and as soon as she sat down, she
[1:37:00] just
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I I know I know Wednesday night we
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I know Wednesday night we worked. I
[1:37:11] worked today, too.
[1:37:14] But I want to show you this because it
[1:37:15] shows you how sly the devil is. This
[1:37:17] sister, she she sat down and she just
[1:37:20] just fall asleep.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And it started plaguing her. She said,
[1:37:24] "My why why can I not stay asleep during
[1:37:27] the preaching of the word? I I I can sit
[1:37:29] down at my home and I'm fine. And I can
[1:37:31] sit here and I'm fine and I can sit here
[1:37:34] and I'm fine. But when I come to church
[1:37:36] and sit here, I fall asleep."
[1:37:39] and she was hearing a preaching of the
[1:37:41] word one day and she realized, wait a
[1:37:44] minute, that's a spirit that is doing
[1:37:46] that to me. It's a spirit of tiredness.
[1:37:49] And they literally caught a spirit of
[1:37:51] tiredness. And this sister come up and
[1:37:54] this preacher rebuked the spirit of
[1:37:56] tiredness on her and said, "You demon of
[1:37:59] tiredness, you are bringing a spirit of
[1:38:01] weary on her mind and you're causing
[1:38:04] these problems." And the brother rebuked
[1:38:06] that spirit off of her and it left her
[1:38:09] and she sat there and was wide awake.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And she thought, well, it's just a
[1:38:17] problem in my body. It's just an issue
[1:38:19] in my body. But really, it was a
[1:38:21] spiritual warfare in another level and
[1:38:25] it was coming to her and bringing all of
[1:38:28] these feeling. Now, I know there's times
[1:38:30] you get fatigued. I'm not talking about
[1:38:32] that. I'm talking about a spirit that
[1:38:34] tries to block the visitation. A spirit
[1:38:37] that tries to block you from your
[1:38:39] deliverance. A spirit that tries to
[1:38:41] block you from being healed.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that's doing that. And
[1:38:47] you cannot be ignorant of Satan and his
[1:38:50] devices.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; But you got to say, "Devil, I see you
[1:38:54] doing that. [screaming] I refuse to fall
[1:38:56] for your trap." and rebuke that devil.
[1:39:02] Rebuke that spirit and say, "Devil, I
[1:39:05] I'm [screaming] not allowing you to do
[1:39:06] that." Do you realize that a lot of
[1:39:08] times, I just want to preach from my
[1:39:10] heart, a lot of times, the reason the
[1:39:12] devil's having his way in your life is
[1:39:14] because you let him.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You let him.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And he's gotten comfortable you letting
[1:39:21] him do it. He's gotten comfortable
[1:39:23] sitting on your shoulder. He's gotten
[1:39:26] comfortable sitting in your car. He's
[1:39:28] gotten comfortable. I'm just going to
[1:39:30] preach. He's gotten comfortable sitting
[1:39:32] in your home. And you let him stay
[1:39:34] there. That old gloomy, depressive
[1:39:37] spirit and that old spirit of sadness.
[1:39:40] Or you just you just leave him alone and
[1:39:42] he'll just stay there and he's gotten
[1:39:45] comfortable living there. I think it's
[1:39:47] time we ought to make the devil
[1:39:49] uncomfortable.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Make that devil uncomfortable. Do you
[1:39:58] realize when the prophet was teaching
[1:39:59] about healing, he talked about it. He
[1:40:01] said, "You just battle with some kind of
[1:40:03] sickness in your body." He said, "You go
[1:40:05] forth." You realize God heals in many
[1:40:07] different ways.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes there's a miracle. Sometimes
[1:40:10] it's progression. Sometimes it's one
[1:40:12] day. Sometimes it's multiple years. But
[1:40:15] regardless, God is faithful and God
[1:40:17] heals.
[1:40:19] Is that right? He's faithful and he
[1:40:21] heals. But the prophet gave a little key
[1:40:24] to this. He said, "See what it is when
[1:40:26] you go testify." And he said, "You leave
[1:40:28] this place." Because how many knows
[1:40:30] healing is the finished work?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible records it as past tense,
[1:40:35] right? By his stripes, we were
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; already he already settled and done. So,
[1:40:41] you're already healed according to the
[1:40:44] word of God. And the prophet said, "What
[1:40:46] you do is you go forth praising God,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; worshiping God. God, you've healed me.
[1:40:53] Thank God for healing me. God, you've
[1:40:55] healed me. I thank you for it. And the
[1:40:58] prophet said, you go worshiping God and
[1:41:01] you go praising God [screaming] like
[1:41:04] it's already done. And the devil says,
[1:41:07] "Well, well, you know, you're not really
[1:41:09] healed and you don't want to lie on
[1:41:11] God." You rebuke that devil and say,
[1:41:14] "No, devil. I'm already healed, but look
[1:41:16] at your I don't I'm not looking at my
[1:41:18] condition. I'm looking at the word and
[1:41:21] the word said I'm already healed and the
[1:41:24] word said it's already done.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't want to lie on God. And
[1:41:31] and that's the thing the devil says.
[1:41:32] Well, well, you're lying if you say
[1:41:34] that. You ain't lying. You're professing
[1:41:37] the word. And the Bible says that he is
[1:41:40] a high priest
[1:41:42] to your confession.
[1:41:45] He's a high priest to what you confess.
[1:41:49] Amen. The prophet said, "What you do as
[1:41:52] you worship God and you praise God," he
[1:41:55] said, "And after a while," Hallelujah.
[1:41:58] He said, "After a while, that spirit
[1:42:01] gets tired." This is right in the
[1:42:03] message. He said, "That spirit gets
[1:42:05] tired, brother Kalema, of hearing you
[1:42:08] worship and hearing you praise." And he
[1:42:11] says, "Well, I guess if they're going to
[1:42:13] believe they're healed, I'll go leave
[1:42:14] them alone." And the prophet said,
[1:42:17] "There it is." He said, "There is the
[1:42:19] manifestation
[1:42:21] of your confession." He said, "That
[1:42:24] devil got tired of listening to you
[1:42:26] praise."
[1:42:28] Hallelujah. To listen to you worship, to
[1:42:32] listen to you testify, and so that devil
[1:42:35] just left you alone. That's the way it's
[1:42:38] got to be with your situation. You got
[1:42:40] to start praising God and start
[1:42:42] worshiping God. I don't care if it ain't
[1:42:45] getting no better. I don't care if the
[1:42:47] situation ain't changing. You're
[1:42:49] commanded in the word. You're already
[1:42:52] [screaming] healed. You're already
[1:42:54] delivered.
[1:42:56] [applause]
[1:42:57] [cheering] I'm telling you this. Amen.
[1:42:59] If you can believe it and you can
[1:43:01] receive, it's already done.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Amen. When Jesus was
[1:43:07] on the cross, what did he say?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Finished.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I tell you, your situation's finished in
[1:43:15] the mind of God. Your problem is already
[1:43:18] finished. Your sickness is finished.
[1:43:20] Amen. Cancer was finished. Anxiety was
[1:43:23] finished. Nervousness was finished.
[1:43:26] Marriage trouble was finished. He
[1:43:28] finished it on the cross.
[1:43:32] Oh, praise God in the highest. I said he
[1:43:35] finished it already. What do I got to
[1:43:38] do? You got to believe, sister. It's
[1:43:41] already [screaming] done. It's already
[1:43:44] finished. The victories be won. Oh, let
[1:43:47] me tell you. You may lose the battle,
[1:43:49] [screaming] but the war has already been
[1:43:52] won.
[1:43:53] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:43:55] I said the war has been won. You may
[1:43:58] fall out. You may lose a battle, but
[1:44:01] Christ is victorious.
[1:44:04] And he won the battle over sickness. And
[1:44:06] he won the battle over sin.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what the prophet said? He
[1:44:12] said, "To you that's on tape, the day of
[1:44:14] sin is over."
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Do you realize the prophet declared the
[1:44:19] year of Jubilee is right now? He said,
[1:44:22] "And to those that can hear it, this is
[1:44:25] your Jubilee trumpet. You don't have to
[1:44:28] serve the devil anymore. You don't have
[1:44:30] to serve that problem no more. You don't
[1:44:33] have to serve sickness no more. You
[1:44:35] don't have to serve I don't know if you
[1:44:38] believe in me tonight. You don't got to
[1:44:40] serve that spirit. Amen. You are called
[1:44:43] by God, brother and sister. You take
[1:44:45] dominion. You take authority. Amen. Take
[1:44:48] that spirit and put it beneath you where
[1:44:52] it belong. Amen. Whatever the situation
[1:44:54] is. Amen. Where does it belong?
[1:44:56] [screaming] Underneath your feet.
[1:44:59] Hallelujah. It belongs under your feet.
[1:45:03] You're the bride of Christ.
[1:45:05] Stomp the devil [screaming] down.
[1:45:09] Fear, you got no hold on me. Anxiety,
[1:45:12] you got no hold on me. Worry, you got no
[1:45:14] [screaming] hold on me. Take that devil
[1:45:17] that's been lying to you and put him
[1:45:19] where he belongs.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] That's where that devil belongs.
[1:45:34] He's lying to you.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; He's lying to you. He tries to convince
[1:45:40] people, I got a right to be here. I got
[1:45:42] a right. He ain't got no right.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you? He's got zero rights
[1:45:46] with your children.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; He's got zero rights with your family.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; He's got zero rights with your He don't
[1:45:53] got no right.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Who said, "How can you say that?"
[1:45:57] Because Jesus went to his house.
[1:46:03] Oh, hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:46:05] I said Jesus went to his house and he
[1:46:08] had some keys on his side and he knocked
[1:46:11] on that door that great day. He thought,
[1:46:14] "I got him. He's coming to I tell you
[1:46:16] what, boys. I really got him." Amen. The
[1:46:19] prophet said he kicked the door down and
[1:46:22] he went up to the side of that old
[1:46:24] devil. He had the key to death. He had
[1:46:27] the key to hell. He had the key to the
[1:46:29] grave. He had the key to sickness. He
[1:46:32] had the key to fear. He had the key to
[1:46:34] every element, every spirit. And what
[1:46:37] did Jesus do? Oh, Mr. Can I please have
[1:46:40] them key? You You know what? I really
[1:46:43] That's not what he did. He didn't make
[1:46:45] no deal with the devil. He said, "Give
[1:46:48] me those keys."
[1:46:50] And the devil this evening, he don't got
[1:46:52] the key to his own [screaming] house. So
[1:46:55] why in the world do you say he's going
[1:46:57] to ride in your mind or ride on your
[1:47:00] shoulder? He's got no [screaming] ride
[1:47:02] on you. [cheering]
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said he's got no ride on
[1:47:07] [screaming] you. He don't even got the
[1:47:10] keys to his own house.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] But Christ has won the victory. He don't
[1:47:19] got no right with your body. He don't
[1:47:21] got no right with your spirit. And he
[1:47:24] sure don't got no right with your soul
[1:47:26] because your soul, my sister, has been
[1:47:29] sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:47:32] And the devil may attack your body. And
[1:47:35] the devil may attack your mind. And the
[1:47:37] devil may attack your spirit. But there
[1:47:39] is a seal of God that is around your
[1:47:42] soul. And the devil could not get to
[1:47:45] you.
[1:47:47] [cheering and applause]
[1:47:50] I said your soul has been sealed by the
[1:47:53] seal of the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:56] [applause]
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation
[1:48:00] because you'll be attacked in this body.
[1:48:02] You'll be attacked in your mind. But the
[1:48:04] devil's done come too late because I've
[1:48:07] done been sealed by by the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:11] Amen. The devil should have had you when
[1:48:13] he had a chance. He should have got you
[1:48:16] while you was out in the world. I want
[1:48:17] to tell the devil tonight, you come too
[1:48:20] late.
[1:48:22] You come too late. You should have got
[1:48:24] me while you had a chance. But what did
[1:48:27] Jesus prophesy? Jesus said that there
[1:48:30] will be none that can pluck them out of
[1:48:33] my hand.
[1:48:35] And I will [screaming] not lose the one
[1:48:38] that the father has given me.
[1:48:43] I'm so thankful
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; because the devil would have stopped us
[1:48:46] a long time ago.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; The devil would have hindered us a long
[1:48:50] time ago. I remember see
[1:48:53] [cough]
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; predestinated before the foundation of
[1:48:57] the world.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Chosen in God. Elected for this time.
[1:49:01] Elected for this season.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for it?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to turn a corner here.
[1:49:09] I know I've just done a lot of preaching
[1:49:10] this this evening, but
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; the prophet, he talked about how he
[1:49:14] dealt within that in that realm of
[1:49:16] spirits. Let me read you this quote.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, my work is in the realm
[1:49:20] of spirits. That's where I live a big
[1:49:22] part of my life." He said, "See, it's in
[1:49:24] another dimension
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; that the world knows nothing about." He
[1:49:30] said, "See, I speak in the name of the
[1:49:32] Lord and they don't understand it." He
[1:49:35] said, "There's no need of trying to
[1:49:37] explain it. There's no way to explain
[1:49:39] it. And the prophet's given us a
[1:49:41] revelation that he's seeing into the
[1:49:44] spirit realm and he's seeing spirits of
[1:49:46] world. How many knows the prophet said
[1:49:47] he said that each and every one of you
[1:49:49] are a spirit.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; And when you come in here, you come in
[1:49:53] as a spirit being, triune being, body,
[1:49:56] soul, and spirit.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; And sometimes your spirit ain't right.
[1:49:59] You can affect the service.
[1:50:02] That's right.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, the prophet said you can hinder
[1:50:04] somebody from being healed.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Because of your unbelief
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; and because of that spirit that you
[1:50:11] carry with you.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said, he
[1:50:14] said, "Don't be up running around and
[1:50:16] moving around during this time of
[1:50:17] discernment." He said, "You're a spirit
[1:50:19] and you're causing a distraction." And
[1:50:21] the prophet said, "It is so powerful. I
[1:50:24] just don't have time to read all of it.
[1:50:26] It's so powerful to me because
[1:50:28] underneath that discernment, you know, I
[1:50:31] think it's beautiful to realize this
[1:50:32] because whenever you see a spirit that's
[1:50:35] manifesting, I don't know how many's
[1:50:36] ever seen that before,
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; but a spirit manifesting itself through
[1:50:40] through somebody
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; and you think, "Oh, the devil's really
[1:50:43] gaining power." But that's not the case.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; It's the presence of God that was made
[1:50:48] so manifest that that spirit has acting
[1:50:52] out from it. Right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; That spirit is acting out. It's same way
[1:50:57] with the maniac at Gera when he he ran
[1:51:00] to Jesus.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come running to the man.
[1:51:05] That maniac came to Jesus. Why did you
[1:51:08] come to torment? Amen. What was it? It
[1:51:10] was a manifestation of God. And the
[1:51:13] devil is always working right there when
[1:51:16] the manifestation of God is working. How
[1:51:18] many knows the prophet said that? He
[1:51:20] said, "Whenever a true revival is
[1:51:22] happening, you'll find an insane asylums
[1:51:25] fill up and all of this wickedness
[1:51:27] happens because the move of God, it
[1:51:30] exposes the works of the enemy."
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "All of us, we're
[1:51:36] a spirit being and we carry a spirit."
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Now, you're very familiar with all of
[1:51:42] these discernments. I think they're very
[1:51:44] powerful to listen to. The prophet with
[1:51:46] this particular case, I would like to
[1:51:48] read this to you. He said, "Sister, I
[1:51:50] see you're strictly a stranger to me.
[1:51:51] You're away from here. You've come from
[1:51:54] another city. You've got a lot of
[1:51:55] trouble on your heart. You got heart
[1:51:56] trouble."
[1:51:58] He said, "To begin with, is that right?
[1:52:00] There's a whole lot of blackness. I see
[1:52:03] a black sheep that keep you following
[1:52:05] like that." He said, "Oh, I see it. It's
[1:52:07] a lie."
[1:52:09] He said, "Somebody told a lie on you,
[1:52:12] and that was a man that was professing
[1:52:14] divine healing." The sister said, "Yes,
[1:52:16] sir."
[1:52:18] He said you was a witch.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Is that true? He said you got a
[1:52:24] holster in your church or something
[1:52:27] another like that. Isn't that right? He
[1:52:29] said your pastor's sick right now. He's
[1:52:31] got polio. Is that right? Yes, sir. Yes,
[1:52:34] sir. I don't know about you, but I've
[1:52:35] never read or heard where a person says,
[1:52:38] "No, brother, you missed him."
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; No, brother. That wasn't right. Now, I
[1:52:44] know the critics say that, but but I
[1:52:46] never found on tape. Surely to goodness,
[1:52:48] if it was wrong, it' have been right
[1:52:50] there on the platform.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; I just dropped that over here for
[1:52:54] somebody. He said, "Your pastor's sick
[1:52:57] right now. He's got polio. Is that
[1:52:58] right?" Yes, sir. And notice what says
[1:53:01] there, "Sister, don't pay no attention."
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; What was her problem? She was paying
[1:53:07] attention, brother Robert, to what they
[1:53:10] were saying about her.
[1:53:13] Don't pay no attention to what them
[1:53:15] people tell you. The prophet says
[1:53:17] they're lying. [screaming]
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; He said the only thing wrong with your
[1:53:21] heart is a nervous condition.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Now notice this. The prophet first in
[1:53:26] discernment. He said you got a heart
[1:53:28] trouble. Then it begin to dig behind to
[1:53:31] bury into her life a little bit and
[1:53:33] said, "Oh, it was a lie that was told on
[1:53:35] you." And see the issue. His sister
[1:53:38] believed the lie that was told about her
[1:53:41] and it invited a spirit of nervousness
[1:53:45] on her and that spirit was working her
[1:53:48] up and no doubt all she could think
[1:53:50] about was what them people said.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; He said the only thing wrong with you is
[1:53:56] a nervous condition. He said sister go
[1:53:59] home in peace and God bless you. He said
[1:54:02] you're all right. [screaming]
[1:54:04] God bless you. And then he says, "You're
[1:54:06] not a witch.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; She needed to hear that.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; You're not a witch." Because that devil
[1:54:14] had so anointed the words of that false
[1:54:17] person. And that's all she could think
[1:54:20] about was the lie that they was telling
[1:54:22] of her. And the prophet said, "Listen,
[1:54:25] they're lying to you. You're not a
[1:54:27] witch. They're lying to you." And the
[1:54:29] prophet said, "Go home and go in peace.
[1:54:35] and she got deliverance.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Then there's other people, brother
[1:54:38] Random would come into they would come
[1:54:40] into that line of discernment and then
[1:54:41] he's talking to them and then they would
[1:54:43] have a spirit cast on them or cast off
[1:54:45] of them rather and then brother say now
[1:54:47] brother you go and you go worship God
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; and you go praise God for healing you.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Now have you ever thought why did the
[1:54:57] prophet say that? because he knew that
[1:54:59] individual in the future would no doubt
[1:55:02] battle with a spirit of doubt or a
[1:55:05] spirit of fear. Amen. Have you ever have
[1:55:07] you ever tried to praise God and worship
[1:55:10] God while you're afraid?
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; It's hard to be afraid while you're
[1:55:15] praising God.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried when when when you
[1:55:20] got an oppressive spirit on you and
[1:55:22] you're so low, you just start singing
[1:55:25] and worshiping God? I I don't know you
[1:55:27] ever tried. I have. It is very hard to
[1:55:30] be discouraged while you start praising
[1:55:33] God and worshiping God. It is very hard
[1:55:37] to be full of anxiety and all of these
[1:55:39] problems while you're praising and
[1:55:41] worshiping God. Amen. See where the
[1:55:44] revelation is? is that spirit gets so
[1:55:47] uncomfortable.
[1:55:49] And that's why the prophet said,
[1:55:51] "Brother, you leave this place and go
[1:55:54] worship God and go sing and go praise
[1:55:57] God." What is it? You got to keep the
[1:56:00] atmosphere of victory over your life.
[1:56:03] [screaming]
[1:56:04] Keep the atmosphere of deliverance over
[1:56:06] your life and keep on singing and keep
[1:56:09] on worshiping and keep on testifying.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; So next time y'all y'all know what I'm
[1:56:18] talking about. Next time that spirit
[1:56:20] starts moving in around you like that
[1:56:22] big old shadow as the devil moves, you
[1:56:24] just start praising God. You just start,
[1:56:27] Victory is mine.
[1:56:30] Hallelujah. You just start singing, God
[1:56:33] will make a way. God will make this
[1:56:35] child a blessing. You just start
[1:56:37] worshiping God and praising God. And
[1:56:40] that spirit that tries to hang around
[1:56:42] you
[1:56:43] You know the devil's got a target on
[1:56:45] your back.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of y'all wonder, you say,
[1:56:49] "Why can I not escape this spirit?"
[1:56:51] Because that spirit knows you got a
[1:56:52] weakness with it.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Some people, I personally don't battle
[1:56:56] with fear or anxiety, but I know there's
[1:56:58] people that battle it tremendously.
[1:57:00] It's because with their human makeup,
[1:57:02] they war in that in that realm. I I
[1:57:05] don't understand that cuz I don't battle
[1:57:06] with it. But to that person, that's very
[1:57:09] real.
[1:57:11] to that person. It's extreme and you
[1:57:13] can't tell them just don't feel that
[1:57:15] way, brother. Well, sure they would try
[1:57:17] that if they [clears throat] could.
[1:57:18] Well, just don't be that way. They would
[1:57:20] try that if they could, but it's in the
[1:57:22] spirit realm.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And spirits follow you and they try to
[1:57:27] they they they they try to follow after
[1:57:29] you because they know you battle with
[1:57:31] that. That's why the prophet said, he
[1:57:33] said, "See what you got to do? You got
[1:57:35] to learn to keep the punches off of you
[1:57:38] as much as you can. And you got to keep
[1:57:41] the weak parts of your life guarded.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Can I give it to you in a very natural
[1:57:47] illustration? If somebody battles with
[1:57:49] drinking alcohol, they ought to not be
[1:57:51] where alcohol is.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; If somebody battles with worldly music,
[1:57:56] they ought to not be where a bunch of
[1:57:58] worldly music is.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; You can take that with any application.
[1:58:03] You don't want to put yourself into a
[1:58:05] position. Am I preaching to real people
[1:58:08] here tonight?
[1:58:09] You don't want to put yourself into a
[1:58:11] spot because then that devil will come
[1:58:14] out and you wonder how in the world did
[1:58:16] this happen. Do you realize if you give
[1:58:18] the devil an edge, he'll take a mile.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's right in the
[1:58:24] message. The prophet said, "But Legion,"
[1:58:27] he said, "Maybe he just had one social
[1:58:29] drink. Maybe he just told one lie and
[1:58:32] then Legion had to lie to his wife about
[1:58:35] drinking. Then lie to cover that lie.
[1:58:36] Lie to cover that lie." He said, "But
[1:58:38] see what happened is it all started
[1:58:41] somewhere.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; He allowed a spirit to stay longer than
[1:58:46] it should have ever stayed. And he
[1:58:48] allowed himself to get close to
[1:58:49] something that he never should have got
[1:58:51] close to." So we realize, listen, we're
[1:58:54] the bride of Christ. I believe that. You
[1:58:56] believe that. But you are not immune
[1:58:58] from the devil. The moment you think
[1:59:00] you're more spiritual than these things
[1:59:02] is a moment you're going to get trapped.
[1:59:04] The moment you think you're above that
[1:59:06] is the moment the devil's going to get
[1:59:08] you. If you ever think you're above
[1:59:10] temptation or or you're above this, I've
[1:59:13] seen the greatest of great men fallen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; I've seen the best of the best taken
[1:59:19] down.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; The person you would have thought my if
[1:59:22] there was ever an Enoch, that man was
[1:59:24] Enoch. And I watched him fall.
[1:59:27] If you ever think you're above sin or
[1:59:29] you're above this or you're above that,
[1:59:31] that's exactly what the devil wants you
[1:59:33] to think because then he'll creep in and
[1:59:35] creep in and then you'll compromise and
[1:59:38] you'll say, "Well, it's just a little
[1:59:40] drink or or well, it's just a little
[1:59:42] this or a little that." And that's
[1:59:44] exactly how the devil gets the victory
[1:59:48] is over a small thing. [clears throat]
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I'll read a couple quotes here and close
[1:59:54] on this note. But
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; but the prophet uh Samuel here in the
[1:59:58] Old Testament
[2:00:01] when he came to Saul and and he told him
[2:00:04] give me a minute. I'll find the
[2:00:05] scriptures here on it. But he told him
[2:00:08] he said that uh you're you're you're
[2:00:11] commanded to go kill the Amalachites.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You're commanded to go destroy them all.
[2:00:16] You're commanded to go Amen. the the
[2:00:19] young, the old. I'll just have to preach
[2:00:20] it to you. I don't have enough time to
[2:00:22] get to all of it.
[2:00:24] But the prophet Samuel told him, he
[2:00:26] said, uh, to to go out and you go kill a
[2:00:29] gag and you go you go kill all the rams
[2:00:32] and kill all the oxen and kill all of
[2:00:34] these.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; And in the natural mind, if you was
[2:00:38] being a reasonable person,
[2:00:41] you would say, well, you know, it's just
[2:00:42] a it's just a child of Malachi. It's
[2:00:45] just a baby Malachi. And notice what I
[2:00:48] want you to notice this spirit in
[2:00:49] closing because notice him in his mind
[2:00:52] he he had thus sayeth the Lord from the
[2:00:55] prophet
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; kill them all
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; in his mind he thought you know God
[2:01:00] would really appreciate a good lamb.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; God would really appreciate a good
[2:01:06] sacrifice.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; God would really be thankful if I did
[2:01:10] this and did that. But what did the
[2:01:12] prophet say?
[2:01:15] And in his mind, he was innocent. In his
[2:01:18] mind, it was not that big of a deal.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; But Saul went out and he took the be
[2:01:24] what did he say? I took the best of the
[2:01:26] sheep. I took the best of the ram and I
[2:01:28] got Aag right here. And Saul and Samuel
[2:01:32] came to him. He said, God said to
[2:01:34] destroy all of them.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Isn't it a lot better to obey
[2:01:40] than the sacrifice?"
[2:01:43] And then Saul Saul be or Samuel rather
[2:01:47] Samuel began to tap into that spirit of
[2:01:50] discernment and he said that spirit of
[2:01:52] rebellion
[2:01:54] is likened unto witchcraft
[2:01:58] [cheering]
[2:01:59] or brother you know I just don't agree
[2:02:01] with the prophet that's a spirit of
[2:02:03] witchcraft
[2:02:05] brother I just don't you know it it's
[2:02:07] the best it's for the Lord I'mma do it
[2:02:10] for the Lord and it sounds Good.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; But what's the spirit?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, you may sound fundamentally
[2:02:18] right, but what's the spirit motivating
[2:02:20] it?
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; It may make sense. That's great. But
[2:02:25] what's the spirit motivating it?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Samuel was
[2:02:30] opening up the prophet in discernment.
[2:02:32] He said, "That spirit that is on you, it
[2:02:35] is likened unto witchcraft."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could you bring that home to you
[2:02:40] and I? Amen. when we want to go against
[2:02:43] what God has said, we want to go against
[2:02:46] the word of God. And you think, well,
[2:02:48] you know, it's harmless and it's not
[2:02:50] that big of a deal, and it's just a
[2:02:52] small amalachi. Listen, brother, sister,
[2:02:55] if you don't deal with it while it's
[2:02:57] small. I'm telling you, [applause]
[2:03:00] if you don't kill the little Amalachi,
[2:03:03] that thing will turn into a big amalachi
[2:03:06] and he'll cut your throat.
[2:03:11] It's exactly the truth.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Help us to get rid of the little things.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; What's the Bible say? It's the little
[2:03:21] foxes
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; that spoil the vines.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; It's the little thing that does it. And
[2:03:27] we and we think, well, the devil's going
[2:03:29] to come out like some great big That's
[2:03:31] not what he's going to do.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; He'll come in so little.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, the Lord would
[2:03:36] appreciate that. But would he?
[2:03:38] Hallelujah.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, the Lord would be
[2:03:40] thankful for that. But would he
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; discern the spirit?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; What? Let me just say this. Any
[2:03:47] ministry, any any anointing, anything
[2:03:50] has got to be judged by the word.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how anointed it is, it
[2:03:56] don't matter how how Listen, the devil
[2:03:59] wants you to reason with the word.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; And the issue of it is is that people
[2:04:04] get to where they understand. And if you
[2:04:07] can so break something down to where it
[2:04:09] makes sense, people go with it.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; The devil makes a lot of sense, but he's
[2:04:13] a liar.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; The devil makes a whole lot of sense,
[2:04:17] but there ain't no truth in him.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he did to Eve.
[2:04:21] He made it made sense.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God wants you to be like
[2:04:26] God. Well, yeah, that that sounds good.
[2:04:28] And that's what the devil would do with
[2:04:30] you.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God, he wants you to he
[2:04:33] wants you to be this way and enjoy it
[2:04:35] this way. And you know, God, he really
[2:04:37] wants you to be blessed. And and if
[2:04:39] you're not careful, the devil will have
[2:04:40] you pushed out into material gains
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; and not spiritual gains. And the devil
[2:04:46] will get your focus on all of these
[2:04:48] other things instead of where they
[2:04:49] should be. And he'll make it make sense.
[2:04:51] And he'll make it sound right. And he'll
[2:04:54] make it intellectually be exactly right.
[2:04:56] But yet it be false. Because what is the
[2:04:58] spirit that is under it? Is the spirit
[2:05:02] vanity? Is the spirit self- gain? Is the
[2:05:05] spirit popularity? Is the spirit
[2:05:08] self-reputation,
[2:05:10] self-exaltation?
[2:05:11] What is the spirit behind it? Even in
[2:05:15] preachers, you know, I want to preach so
[2:05:17] good. I want to do such a good job. We
[2:05:19] appreciate that. But what is the spirit
[2:05:22] that is under it? Do you want to do it
[2:05:24] to be heard and to be saved? You got to
[2:05:27] discern the spirit. And you ought to sit
[2:05:30] down and re-evaluate for a minute.
[2:05:34] But the true spirit has to exalt Christ.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what this message come to do.
[2:05:40] It came to lift up Christ.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It come to exalt Christ. And let me tell
[2:05:45] you this, you don't have to push Brother
[2:05:47] Brandham down to lift up Christ.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; As high as you put the prophet, you just
[2:05:53] put Christ high.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. as high. I put him
[2:05:59] exactly where brother put him. But I put
[2:06:02] Jesus higher.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I put him higher than any man. I put him
[2:06:06] higher than any prophet. He was the
[2:06:08] prophet of the prophets. He was the God
[2:06:11] prophet. And he is the only one that we
[2:06:14] worship.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Discernment of spirit. You realize
[2:06:23] that's why the devil hates this message.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I I know I'm trying
[2:06:28] to close. You forgive me. That's why the
[2:06:30] devil hates at this the message as bad
[2:06:32] as he does because it exposes him.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet says very clearly, he said,
[2:06:37] "I wish you could be in these meetings
[2:06:39] and see the people."
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "See the countenance on the
[2:06:43] people's faces." He said, "The devil,"
[2:06:46] notice what the prophet does because
[2:06:48] this is so crucial. He makes a
[2:06:50] difference between the people and the
[2:06:52] spirit.
[2:06:55] He's never attacking a He says, "Notice
[2:06:57] the faces of the of the people and how
[2:07:00] they're the devil and how they're so
[2:07:01] bad." He don't do that. He says, "Notice
[2:07:03] the countenance of the people." He said,
[2:07:06] "The devil realizes he's about to be
[2:07:10] exposed." And there's such a peculiar
[2:07:13] change that comes across the people's
[2:07:15] faces. And the devil's scrambling and
[2:07:17] running and scrambling because he can't
[2:07:20] hide in the presence of God.
[2:07:23] And that's why the devil attacks this
[2:07:25] message with everything he's got because
[2:07:28] it exposes him in the world. It exposes
[2:07:32] him in the church. It exposes him in the
[2:07:35] leoty. It exposes every trick of the
[2:07:38] devil.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "What the devil
[2:07:43] does is try to get you to disprove or
[2:07:46] disbelieve God's word." He said, "And if
[2:07:49] he can break your confidence in the
[2:07:51] word, then the devil can hide.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; He can hide because then you don't
[2:07:58] believe it's your spirit." Amen. I just
[2:08:00] love the way the prophet said it because
[2:08:02] he said, "See that devil, he can hide
[2:08:04] from the doctor, but he cannot hide from
[2:08:07] Jesus Christ." That spirit, it can hide
[2:08:10] from the doctor. It can hide from the
[2:08:13] lenses. It can hide from these things,
[2:08:15] but it cannot hide from Christ.
[2:08:19] I want to tell the devil, Amen, you may
[2:08:21] hide from the doctor and you may hide
[2:08:23] from the church and you may hide from
[2:08:25] the pastor, but God sees you and he sees
[2:08:30] exactly what you're doing and your day
[2:08:32] is coming to an end.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And I just love it because the prophet
[2:08:40] said, "Here's the cause." Right.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; And it's just so powerful because the
[2:08:46] prophet would never leave us with the
[2:08:47] cause without introducing us to the
[2:08:50] cure.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Here's the cause of your
[2:08:53] problem."
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; And here's the cure.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Here's the cause of anxiety. Here's the
[2:08:59] cure. Here's the cause of sickness.
[2:09:01] Here's the cure. Here's the cause of
[2:09:03] unbelief. Here's the cure.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And spirits will follow generations.
[2:09:09] You realize that
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament, sins will be
[2:09:12] visited upon generations.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; But see, there's got to be somebody rise
[2:09:17] up that stops it
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; and please. Let me tell you this. The
[2:09:22] blood of Jesus Christ is stronger
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; than your generational spirits that's
[2:09:27] following your family. It is stronger
[2:09:30] than the spirits that try. Amen. Do you
[2:09:33] realize you ever thought about why do
[2:09:35] you battle with what your father battled
[2:09:37] and your greatgrandfather and his
[2:09:40] father's father? It's because that
[2:09:42] spirit has seen a gene of weakness and
[2:09:45] he's going from generation to generation
[2:09:47] to generation. And because your father
[2:09:50] didn't deal with that spirit, you're
[2:09:52] having to deal with it. And because your
[2:09:54] mother didn't deal with that spirit,
[2:09:56] you're having to deal with it. But I
[2:09:58] say, let's do just that. Let's deal with
[2:10:01] that old devil
[2:10:03] and let's put him underneath the blood.
[2:10:07] Hallelujah. And let's get rid of it and
[2:10:10] say, "Devil, you may have done it
[2:10:12] through my great grandparents and you
[2:10:14] may have done it through my parents, but
[2:10:16] I have discernment of spirit and it took
[2:10:18] her down and it took him down and it
[2:10:22] took him down, but it stops right here
[2:10:24] today. [cheering]
[2:10:26] It stops right here. Y'all know exactly
[2:10:28] what I'm talking about. That spirit of
[2:10:31] temper or that spirit of anger or
[2:10:34] whatever it may be, you can tell that
[2:10:36] devil, devil, you may have done what you
[2:10:38] wanted to with him, but you stop right
[2:10:41] here. I plead the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:10:45] over you and rebuke that devil and bind
[2:10:49] that devil.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stand to your feet this
[2:10:55] evening.
[2:10:59] bind that devil.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; You speak the word. You bind that devil.
[2:11:04] I'm telling you, church, you you you're
[2:11:06] you're you're commanded to do it.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "What stops a cycle?" When the
[2:11:12] individual raises up and says, "Enough
[2:11:14] is enough."
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't lost you. I'm sure
[2:11:19] you're with me on it.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; It's the devil cycling. Let Let me tell
[2:11:24] you this. I want to just drive this
[2:11:26] home.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; A cycle don't stop unconsciously.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; We're facing a new year. Your your life
[2:11:34] is not going to get better
[2:11:35] unconsciously.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Your prayer life will not get better
[2:11:40] unconsciously.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Your marriage, it won't get better
[2:11:43] unconsciously.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Your situations, whatever you're dealing
[2:11:48] with, it won't get better uncon.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It don't
[2:11:52] just get better.
[2:11:54] It takes conscious effort.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; It takes you doing something. Lord, I I
[2:12:00] want something to change. Then change
[2:12:02] it.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord, change it. I
[2:12:07] want my prayer life to change. Then
[2:12:09] change it. In the name of the Lord,
[2:12:12] change it. I want this situation to
[2:12:14] change. Then change it.
[2:12:17] You cry about it and you dream about it
[2:12:19] and you think about it. What would it be
[2:12:21] like if I got delivered? Listen, this is
[2:12:24] a place where you don't got to dream
[2:12:25] about it. You can experience it. You
[2:12:28] don't got to dream about getting healed.
[2:12:30] You can be healed. You don't got to
[2:12:32] dream about your situation changing. But
[2:12:35] right here in this place this afternoon,
[2:12:37] the situation can change. The sickness
[2:12:40] can be healed. The need can be met.
[2:12:44] This ain't some wishbone. This is faith.
[2:12:47] This ain't some hope. This is a no.
[2:12:54] And we're facing a new year coming up
[2:12:56] soon.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; You want to have a better prayer life,
[2:12:59] then have a better prayer life.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Uncut. You got
[2:13:05] to decide. [music]
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; It ends right here.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living this way. I'm tired
[2:13:10] of putting up with these things. Discern
[2:13:13] that. That problem that you got real,
[2:13:15] that's a spirit that's doing that.
[2:13:16] [music] It stops tonight. That's a
[2:13:19] spirit of worry. It stops tonight. It's
[2:13:22] a spirit of fear. It stops tonight. Are
[2:13:25] you with me this evening?
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Whatever the situation is, it stops
[2:13:29] tonight.
[2:13:31] I mean, declare it. Believe it.
[2:13:35] [music]
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; and in him dwells [music and singing] no
[2:13:48] darkness at all.

[2:13:53] message. God is light. I mean, that
[2:13:57] devil couldn't hide if he wanted to.
[2:13:59] He's been thoroughly, thoroughly,
[2:14:01] thoroughly exposed.

[2:14:06] tonight.
[2:14:08] I mean, that devil's in plain view. And
[2:14:10] you know it's the devil that's doing it.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; You know it's the devil that's plaguing
[2:14:15] your mind and plaguing your spirit. You
[2:14:17] know it's the spirit that's doing it.
[2:14:19] You've been given authority, [music]

[2:21:22] Amen.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Don't reason with the word.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; We know the truth about what the word
[2:21:29] says.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; We have the [music] message of the hour.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Whatever the message point out to you

[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Do not reason.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Even if you struggle with it, obey
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; because a rebellious spirit is a spirit
[2:21:45] of witchcraft. Amen.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul told the the Galatian,
[2:21:50] he said, "Who has bewitched you?"
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a spirit that was bringing
[2:21:55] rebellious to the revealed word that was

[2:22:00] back again into bondage. Amen.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; God is unfolding his word so clear.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; We went in one extreme with the
[2:22:09] legalistic.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; We went another extreme with the
[2:22:13] Calvinistic over there. and we find
[2:22:15] oursself into a mess.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; We preach so much about how powerful the
[2:22:22] devil is
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; and we forget to preach how powerful God
[2:22:25] is.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; We focus so much on divine healing and
[2:22:31] we forget the other things in our life.
[2:22:33] But God is bringing you everything,
[2:22:35] telling you he's a big God. He will
[2:22:38] supply our every need,
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; any spiritual problem, any financial
[2:22:43] problem, any material problem, any
[2:22:46] physical problem, everything. In other
[2:22:49] words, there is no category, no aspect
[2:22:52] in your life that God cannot affect.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is nothing in your life that
[2:22:58] doesn't have a scripture and a promise
[2:23:00] to take care of it.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you have need of.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God want you to prosper.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; As your soul is prospering.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; If my soul is prospering, my body also
[2:23:17] need to prosper.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; And I have a news for you. There will
[2:23:20] come a time where my body will reach its
[2:23:22] comics and change into a glorified body.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; So every single day my body is changing.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Go read brother Brandham. He will tell
[2:23:31] you that the new body begin to form
[2:23:33] within yourself. There is a quote about
[2:23:34] that.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when your theophan is
[2:23:38] coming, it's sucking the vitamin of the
[2:23:40] word that has been in your body and
[2:23:42] begin to transform you. Amen.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; God is alive. God want to s to go to any
[2:23:51] aspect of your life. There is nothing
[2:23:53] like he say if you want to bother
[2:23:55] somebody, bother God.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Bother God. Go talk to God all the time.
[2:24:02] Hallelujah.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, you can pray without
[2:24:04] ceasing. You can pray pray pray pray

[2:24:16] much
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; talk to him anytime
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; you don't have to kneel down you can be
[2:24:21] driving your car
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; you can be cutting a tomato you can be
[2:24:24] sitting in the porch and drinking your
[2:24:26] coffee and you are talking to him in
[2:24:29] your heart
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; you don't have to always close your eyes
[2:24:32] you can sit and look on the ceiling and
[2:24:34] you say Father, I love you. Father, I
[2:24:37] appreciate you. Father, thank you for
[2:24:39] giving me a home. Father, thank you for
[2:24:42] taking care of me. Amen. You can talk to
[2:24:45] him anywhere, even in the bathroom.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; He met Peter when he didn't have
[2:24:52] clothing.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; It's written in your Bible.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Peter, dress up
[2:24:57] yourself, then I'm going to meet you."
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter realized Jesus was already
[2:25:03] there. And then he begin to put clothing
[2:25:05] on. Even in the bathroom, God is there.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; If you say, "God, can I beat you in the
[2:25:11] bathroom?" How was he meeting Adam and
[2:25:13] Eve?
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible?
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Was Adam and Eve dressed?
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; But they were fellowshipping with God
[2:25:22] without any clothing.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; God is everywhere. God is in your
[2:25:26] bedroom. The Bible say Elijah can tell
[2:25:30] you what is in your bed chamber. means
[2:25:33] that even in the bed chamber God is
[2:25:35] there.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we are sinking this pretty good.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Discern the spirit.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; When you see a spirit that is wrong,
[2:25:52] that is taking you away from the word of
[2:25:54] God that is taking you into the world.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You stay away from it.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; But I have a news. If you see a spirit
[2:26:03] that is speaking for the Holy Ghost
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; and that is bringing the truth of God,
[2:26:07] now you need to cling unto that
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; because now that is God.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; There is a false one, there is a true
[2:26:14] one. The false one, you stay away from
[2:26:16] it. But when the truth open up, oh like
[2:26:19] the woman and the well, we drop the
[2:26:21] denominational part and we say come and
[2:26:24] see a man. Come and see a person. He was
[2:26:27] not home with me. But what he preached
[2:26:30] tonight is what I was talking with my
[2:26:32] wife at home. Isn't that this the
[2:26:34] Messiah?
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's the word revealing
[2:26:39] the thoughts
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; and the intent of the heart.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever the devil point out, take
[2:26:47] it out.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Get away from this foolishness of
[2:26:50] Christmas.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the prophet told us
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; that Christmas is a worship of the
[2:26:59] devil.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Where is Santa close into the Bible?
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Where is nutcracker in the Bible?
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:27:13] Bible?

[2:27:17] Bible?

[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; that they come up with? Another green
[2:27:25] creature demon that they put in the
[2:27:27] Christmas. There is so many thing they
[2:27:28] added. You know the demon

[2:27:53] Amen. Brother Brandham say a worship of
[2:27:56] Christmas is worshiping devils. I gave
[2:27:59] you the quote.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; It's in Christianity versus idolatry.
[2:28:04] And God spoke to you discern the spirit.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; What is the spirit behind that?
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; What is the spirit behind that tree?
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Why did they choose only that tree? Why
[2:28:16] they didn't choose the palm tree?
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; What is the revelation be? Why are they
[2:28:20] loving that tree?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; You will worship the devil.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet already point out to us what
[2:28:28] is good and what is bad.

[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Do not be identified with the people of
[2:28:38] the world. We are separate people all
[2:28:41] together.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are worshiping the true and the
[2:28:45] living God. Amen. That's the one we
[2:28:48] serving. Whatever the prophet pointed in
[2:28:50] your life, get it out. Whatever

[2:29:04] Bible?
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; It was aite.
[2:29:06] The people that he spare are the one
[2:29:09] that kill him. How did an Amalachite
[2:29:12] ooze in into the army of Israel and stay
[2:29:16] inside the army of Israel and the
[2:29:18] Amalachite was sitting right there?
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:30:45] world. And I'm going to be strong. Let's
[2:30:47] make a difference in the message.

[2:32:47] feel like you got closer. You feel like
[2:32:49] there was an anointing when I was
[2:32:51] talking to sister so and so. When I was
[2:32:53] talking to brother so and so, we begin
[2:32:55] to talk about the sermon. We begin to
[2:32:57] talk about what brother Solomon
[2:32:58] preached. You remember this sister, look
[2:33:00] at what he did here before you know it

[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, I'm trying to reach out to them.
[2:33:32] None of them come to church.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; You the only one that go to them. So
[2:33:36] they are taking you to their church,
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; but you don't but but you don't bring
[2:33:41] them in your church.

[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; The people in your neighborhood need to
[2:34:08] get in your neighborhood and say that

[2:34:15] that one not having light?" Amen.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; And if they come to ask you, you say,
[2:34:19] "Sit down right here. Open your Bible.
[2:34:22] Look right here. Look right here. Look
[2:34:24] right here. Look right here." And they
[2:34:25] say, "Now we know the reason why you are
[2:34:27] different." In other words, our
[2:34:29] differences even in our houses,
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; even in our building, everything we do,
[2:34:34] we are different. Amen. Let's pray.
