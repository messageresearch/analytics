[0:00] in Jesus name.
[0:08] All right. Just hold up your hand. This
[0:10] is the main one. Thank you, sir.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. All right. My seat is getting
[0:16] a little rebound back there.
[0:19] Morning, friends. Can you hear me? All
[0:21] right. Back there. Thank you. I'm
[0:25] certainly a a privileged person this
[0:27] morning to come here at this platform
[0:29] after such noble testimonies has been
[0:31] given to try to to place just a little
[0:34] more with what they have said uh to
[0:37] bring blessings to us as we've enjoyed
[0:39] this morning. Now I notice some of them
[0:42] are very
[0:45] &gt;&gt; right sir.
[0:49] Is that better?
[0:52] But um some of the man here how they
[0:55] have spoken most everyone well everyone
[0:57] up here had a real bright brilliant
[1:00] testimony. How I appreciate that that
[1:02] fine testimony for the Lord. Now, we're
[1:06] going to approach the word. And I this
[1:08] week, I have purposed in my heart not to
[1:10] keep people these two and three hours
[1:12] sitting listening to me. I tell you why
[1:14] I I do that, friends. I'm uneducated.
[1:18] And I only can speak by inspiration.
[1:21] Now, a man that's got an education when
[1:23] he's inspired, too. But he can explain
[1:27] what he's talking about by his
[1:28] education. Draw out words that will uh
[1:31] let the people know what he's talking
[1:33] about. Without an education, I have to
[1:35] take symbols of nature and express
[1:37] through the inspiration that I have.

[36:41] your mercy, oh father God, that you have
[36:45] bestowed upon us. Truly, we are the

[36:50] And the reason is because of Malachi 4,
[36:53] Luke 17:30,

[36:59] your divine promises, oh Father God,
[37:02] that you've promised for this age.

[37:07] We were bound by denomination, oh Father
[37:09] God, in Egypt, Lord, going to and fro,
[37:13] Father, running on this earth. But when

[37:21] theophanes. And here we are today
[37:23] worshiping you, the King of Kings and
[37:26] the Lord of Lords. Father, we've
[37:29] gathered together tonight, Father, not
[37:31] to meet one another, but to come and
[37:33] serve you, Lord. May you, oh God, come
[37:36] down, oh Father God, in a mighty way
[37:38] tonight. Speak the word of life to your
[37:41] people, Father. As a minister, come
[37:44] behind this pulpit, oh Father, may you,
[37:46] May it not be him, oh God, but may it be
[37:48] you, Father, that speak to your people.
[37:51] You see the needs, the different needs
[37:53] that we have. Each and every one,
[37:54] Father, come in a special way and touch
[37:57] each hand that we raise. Oh, Father God,
[37:59] before you, oh Father, thank you for
[38:03] your grace. Thank you for your mercy.
[38:04] Thank you for the blood. Thank you for
[38:07] the cross. Take now the offering that
[38:09] your people have gathered together
[38:11] today, Father, to give unto thee for
[38:14] your service, oh God, the investment of
[38:16] your kingdom. May you bless the giver,
[38:18] Father God, as we give cheerfully to
[38:20] you. Bless the contin of this service,
[38:23] oh Father, and we'll be careful to
[38:25] return glory and honor to you in Jesus
[38:28] name. Amen.

[38:37] special Amen. Here comes the bride.

[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's
[59:24] take you can you may take your Bible.
[59:26] Let's go to the book of Colossians
[59:28] chapter 1. Can you hear me? Okay.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Beginning by the 90th verse.
[59:38] For he pleased the Father, that in him
[59:41] should all fullness dwell.
[59:48] And having made peace through the blood
[59:51] of his cross by him,
[59:56] to reconcile all things unto himself by
[59:59] him, I say, whether they be things in
[1:00:01] earth or things in heaven,
[1:00:09] are made peace through the blood of his
[1:00:11] cross.
[1:00:16] And you that were sometime alienated and
[1:00:19] enemies in your mind by wicked works
[1:00:24] and by wicked works.
[1:00:32] Yet now has he reconciled in the body of
[1:00:35] his flesh through death
[1:00:43] to present you holy and unblameable and
[1:00:46] unreprovable in his sight.
[1:00:53] If you continue in the faith grounded
[1:00:55] and settled,
[1:01:01] and be not move away from the hope of
[1:01:03] the gospel, which he have heard,
[1:01:08] and which was preached to every creature
[1:01:10] which is under heaven,
[1:01:14] whereof I, Paul, I am made a minister,
[1:01:20] who now rejoice in my suffering, for you
[1:01:28] and fill up that which is behind of the
[1:01:31] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[1:01:33] the body for his body's sake which is
[1:01:36] the church
[1:01:43] whereof
[1:01:46] I made a minister according to the
[1:01:48] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:01:51] for you to fulfill The word of God,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; even the mystery which has been heed
[1:02:04] from ages and from generations, but now
[1:02:07] is made manifest to his saints.
[1:02:20] to whom God will make known which is
[1:02:23] what is the riches of the glory to this
[1:02:26] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:02:28] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:02:42] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:02:45] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:02:48] may present every man perfect in Christ
[1:02:52] Jesus
[1:02:58] where unto I also labor striving
[1:03:01] according to his working which workketh
[1:03:04] in me might modily
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; let's go to Roman chapter 8 beginning by
[1:03:11] verse heavenity
[1:03:17] because the conom mind is enmity against
[1:03:20] God.
[1:03:27] For it is not subject to the law of God,
[1:03:30] neither indeed can be.
[1:03:35] So then they that are in the flesh
[1:03:38] cannot please God.
[1:03:40] But ye
[1:03:42] You are not in the flesh,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; but in the spirit.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:03:50] you. Now if a man have not the spirit of
[1:03:53] Christ, he is none of his.
[1:03:57] And if Christ be in you, the body truly
[1:04:03] is dead because of sin. But the spirit
[1:04:06] is life, because of righteousness.
[1:04:13] But if the spirit of him that raise up
[1:04:16] Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:04:25] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:04:28] his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:04:31] Therefore, brethren,
[1:04:34] we are not debtor not to the flesh
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; to live after the flesh.
[1:04:40] For if you live after the flesh, you
[1:04:42] shall die. But if ye through the spirit
[1:04:46] do modify the deeds of the body, you
[1:04:49] shall live.
[1:04:52] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:04:54] God, they are the sons of God.
[1:04:59] For ye have not received a spirit of
[1:05:01] bondage
[1:05:03] again to feel,
[1:05:06] but you have received the spirit of
[1:05:08] adoption.
[1:05:09] whereby we cry aba father.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Heavenly father,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; bless this church.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Bless brother Steven.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Bless me.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Bless every believer. Glory. Glory,
[1:05:31] praise, honor unto you in the name of
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:05:36] We pray for your glory.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You may be seated tonight.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; I just have a brief message tonight.
[1:05:47] Christ in you.
[1:05:52] Make you the complete revelation of the
[1:05:54] whole thing.
[1:06:00] May God bless brother Steven Sheambo.
[1:06:05] You must believe him with all your
[1:06:06] heart.
[1:06:09] This is very very crucial
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; because a pastor,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; he represented God for his church.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; He represent God for you.
[1:06:22] And you must believe it. No matter.
[1:06:26] You must believe it. You must respect
[1:06:29] it. You must honor him.
[1:06:33] If you do it that way, God will bless
[1:06:36] you.
[1:06:38] Not there is not demon in hell
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; that can stand before an anointed man of
[1:06:45] God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; When I'm in Ivory Coast in a
[1:06:50] when I finish preaching in my church
[1:06:54] automatically I connect to this church
[1:06:57] and I follow the sermon
[1:07:00] and I will invite him
[1:07:03] invite him to come down to Africa.
[1:07:06] and he will come to preach to us.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; in the deity of Jesus Christ in
[1:07:22] paragraph 82,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; he said, "Brothers and sisters,
[1:07:27] that deity is in you.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Just a little while
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; and the world will see me no more.
[1:07:36] But you
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; you shall see me
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; I will be with you.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Even in you
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; till the end of the world.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Christ in a manger. No.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; The hope of life.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:05] The creator
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; himself
[1:08:10] living in a human being.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; The creator
[1:08:15] living in a human being.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; If you believe it,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; say amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; I want to hear an amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; You You cannot cry.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot shout.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:08:34] God
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; will confirm your word.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; The word of God
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; What we will be.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; It's not truly manifested yet.
[1:08:53] But we will see him as he is
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; because we will be like him.
[1:09:01] the spirit
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; in a human body.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; When God created Adam,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; he said, "Let's make manage
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; in our own image."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; man in his image.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; It's the seven virtues
[1:09:23] Jesus
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; took,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; John,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; and James.
[1:09:32] And he took them to Mount
[1:09:34] Transfiguration.
[1:09:36] And when he came back back from the
[1:09:38] mountain,
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; he asked them a question,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; who do you say that I am?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And Peter say,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; "You are the Christ,
[1:09:48] the son of the living God." And Jesus
[1:09:51] say,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; "I will build my church."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I want to hear an amen.
[1:09:58] You cannot cry in your life.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; You cannot lament in your life.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; No matter your problem,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; just speak the word,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; it will happen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Who will do it?
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Who will do it for you? Jesus Christ,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; the word of God
[1:10:20] that is in your life.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Even if you are sick now,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; just speak the word.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; The things will happen,
[1:10:34] even if you don't have a job.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; It will happen.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; It will happen.
[1:10:46] Brother says this,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; 233.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say look
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[1:11:03] He makes him the center of life of the
[1:11:07] revelation.
[1:11:08] You see
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Christ life in you in you
[1:11:15] makes him the center of the revelation.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Christ in the Bible
[1:11:21] makes the Bible
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; the complete revelation of Christ.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Now Christ in you
