Paul says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so Lord what can we do for you there's nothing we can bring because all of our righteousness there are 50 ranks but Lord there's one thing we can do we can try to love you better you can try Lord to do better in these areas we have been failing you help us today Father may be a different day May it not just be an ordinary day but may it be a

older one they're always there to help you so don't feel like you are left alone we are there we just want you to get trained to be working and serving the lord amen so the mature one can get relaxed a little bit amen blessed be the name of the Lord so the last question will be picked up this Wednesday so don't bring the question on Saturday in the morning because you're going to be way way way way way way down there amen if you have not signed up yet the WhatsApp link for the church please do it because you will be missing announcement we're not going to send any more texts except it's really really needed then we will do it so most of them will be in the group if you have not signed it up yet so go ahead and do it brother Robert told me this morning that they will be using more the bulletin board back there so if you want to sign up or make a comment for the meeting or something that is needed or for the uh event coming up on October 1st so just go ahead and put everything on the board so that will avoid me going over the announcement all the time so use the bulletin board the best that you can amen so I was told several times and I keep forgetting that so it's hard but uh when I let the congregation read the quote it's not coming up all right on the streaming so if you're there you can catch it if you're not there you really really have to really listen or increase the volume together amen so I'm going to use a young man when I say what you go ahead and read it brother Angelo let's start with you today [Applause] hahaha so when I say what you read it louder amen praise be to the name of God this is not a church of spectator we all participating into the service amen glory to God let's go to our reading this morning Hallelujah so be always prepared you don't know when you're going to get caught so start reading your Bibles start listening to the message be familiar with the message and the Bible in the scripture everything will be okay amen so we know you're in training so just be relaxed everything will be all right we always have one service on Sunday and that's the way I was led to do it so you eat good you go home you relax and you start showing back on it so the messages take your pressure off and let me do what I gotta do when I finish you free okay that's a plain way to say it not a political way I'm not a politician it's hard to use too much just go straight to the point Genesis chapter 3 verse 1. amen I'm repeating back the scripture because I can't even dig into it by the time I get there somebody's pulling amen now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made you might be seated and he said to the woman yea has God said that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the Garment the garden I'm sorry God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpents say to the woman you shall not surely die the woman gave the word of God and the serpent contradicted the word of God so automatically it's no longer the serpent it is Satan Lucifer in the serpent amen remember how Satan anointed Peter and Jesus Christ have to turn around and rebuke not Peter but we broke Satan and they say get thee behind me Satan so we start again back here with a spirit with the Devil amen the devil moved into the serpent and the serpent is the Beast it is impossible to preach this in one sermon amen I see the 70 weeks of Daniel dancing in front of me but you're not there yet so I came I can't get into it I see Russia dancing in front of me in a scripture I can see putting dancing around amen I see all of them dancing there so the more you swallow quickly the book everything will be okay amen I was sitting last night and I saw Armageddon pulling up and I saw God get my girl pulling up you see now how am I gonna get back to the Sabbath of Israel amen so we got the devil entering into the Beast because remember God does not enter anymore animal you know that we already gave you the code now from there the serpent begin to speak to the woman at first the woman was repeating or rehearsing the word of God that Adam gave it to him amen verse 5 for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open now the serpent begin to teach so not only is he a mouthpiece so remember last Sunday he's a mouthpiece he's a prophet but he's not a good Prophet because he's contradicting God so therefore he's a false prophet you remember and now he's teaching Eve and if he's a teacher he's a false one because he's teaching something that is contrary to the word of God the Bible says that uh the first five for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and they treat to be desired to make one wise another wisdom she took off the fruit thereof and did it and give also to her husband with her so now Eve becomes the teacher all right you remember she's now a mouthpiece she is now a prophetess she is now a teacher by the fox one everybody okay job to verse 11 the Bible says and he said this is God asking who told you that you were naked have you eaten off the tree whereof I commanded you that you should not eat and the man say the woman whom you give to be with me so in other words it's not me she gave me of the tree so the one who gave adam the tree is Eve amen and I did eat it and the Lord God said to the woman what is it what is this that you have done and the woman said the serpent so in other words it's not me I took it from the serpent the serpent began me and I did it everybody okay we know what happened to the serpent drop to verse 17 and to Adam God say he said because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife so there is a voice that Eve have but that voice was not the voice of God that was a voice of the devil that voice started from the Devil Himself in heaven and he entered into a beast and the Beast went into a woman so right here as a conclusion there is a system that the devil uses everybody okay he uses a beast in combination with a woman and that woman is an immoral one everybody okay this is your formula the mathematics of God is he complicated [Music] is it complicated simply system equal amen let's go to Daniel chapter 7. if at least the Lord will help me we drop into the mouth you will see her numbering are working it is amazing with this message so good Daniel chapter 7. amen if you dare you can say Amen I'm using a military aircraft so you need your helmet everything back a lot because we're going to take off you know how it goes right it doesn't go like a commercial airplane it goes just straight and it's up seven verse 2. Daniel spoke and say I saw in my vision by not and behold the four wings of the heaven you know what winds are in this church now strove upon the great sea remember these animals are coming from the Great Sea they're coming from the great sea and you're going to see in Revelation that that coming also one will come from a sea not another one so the one that is coming from a sea is consistent with Daniel right right but the one that comes from the land is a different Beast that's why I told you read Revelation 12 read Revelation 13. I know what I was talking about amen verse 3 and the four and four great beasts came up from the sea that verse one from another verse 4 the first was like a lion and head ego wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked up and he was lift up from the earth so as long as those wings were there on the back of the lion the lion cannot transform amen the lion cannot move from a beast into a man as long as the Eagle's Wings are ready in other words the ego Wing are blocking the transformation or the process to amorphate the lion because the lion of Babylon the lion of Babylon have to move from a beast because the Bible say four Beast from a beast into a human because the Bible says a human heart was given to him amen so the Incarnation cannot happen these lion it symbols but it's a power in other words this power cannot enter a human being except you take off the wings of ego you remember what happened to Daniel when Daniel was taken off from the kingdom then something happened everybody okay okay verse 4 the first was like a lion and head ego Wings I'll be held till the wings would thereof were plucked and he was lift up from the earth because the lion have four power and he walked like a four-footed animal men walk with two so now the lion is no more walking with four the lion is lift up now he's using the hind feet as a man amen and he was lift up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man now you can see it clearly it's no longer an animal now it's a human being it symbols it's a prophetic language Kama and a man's heart so at the beginning he has a beast heart now a man's heart was given to him in other words they give him a human being and the and that Spirit enter the heart of the human being so when you're talking to a human being you're not really talking to a human being you are talking to a beast but he's more he's human everybody okay you have to know how to trace Satan and the man's heart was given to it amen so remember the Incarnation Never Could Happen only after the ego wings are plugged off so every time you plugged off the wind the ego Wings it's a danger okay somebody did it every time you remove the ego wings [Applause] you're making way for the devil some are still catching up do you know what I'm talking about when you take the ego wings and when you remove it from your house when you remove it from your life you just made way for the evil spirit let me go now plainly because somebody's still struggling when you take the message off outside of your church [Music] you are inviting all hell [Music] are we okay glory to God jump to verse 23. oh my God it's a military airplane that's how it cranks so it's now ready verse 23 does he say the four beasts shall be the fourth Kingdom upon Earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms you already write this at home I assume and shall Devour the whole Earth there's no exception I'll accept one remember that Sunday and shall tread down and break it in pieces so this power remember this Kingdom have power over everybody except to one person you must be found in the Lamb's Book of Life let's go to Revelation 18 then we pray the ego wings I will show you what Eagle wings does they're very very interesting and I will go by the scripture and you're going to see what ego Wings do in the scripture amen and as long as they there really powerful and they there for a purpose the ego Wings does things in your life but let's slow down and see where we're going to go let's go to Jeb um Revelation chapter 18. if you dare you can say Amen and after these things I saw another Angel you know that angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory in other words the Earth was illuminated if you don't know that angel see me after church and he cried madly there is a cry madly we Face strong voice saying Babylon the lion the great is Fallen remember this Babylon is Babylon the Great not just Babylon but Babylon they're great remember that Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and he's become the habitation of devil and to and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage in other words a garbage can amen everything that is unclean is converging straight to Babylon the Great amen so Babylon the great becomes the center of pollution the center of contamination the center of evil spirit if you want to find every bad spirit every devil you go there you're going to find them every unclean and hateful bird for All Nation because bird got something remember Abraham have to show bird off his offering do you remember the Butler and the baker the baker was eaten by birds that's fine we keep climbing for all nations have drank of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and The Merchant of the earth our works reached through the abundance of head Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my water so somebody will be in there and they can't get out without the voice there won't be a voice when therefore speak if you are a people of God when you hear that voice that voice is a jubilee he gives you power that no matter the presence of devil no matter how many Devils they are when you hear that voice there is no devil in hell that can stand in other words the devil will make way for you to live that's why they don't like you in certain places because you trouble people that's why you try to blend with people and sometimes they will do stuff and leave you out it's better for you to stay alone you don't understand you cannot blend your Gene is different you can only go so far you cannot go too deep that's why you are in The Clique but there is a click in a click until you disappointed you say they don't like me anymore rejoice [Applause] you are of a different caliber why do you want to blend with everybody do you know who they are you don't know who they are even if they are in message churches oh I'm alone I'm alone stay alone yes sir why do you want to blend and uh and now trying to blend you begin to compromise all the time you got to please people you gotta you have to be in all the change every morning you gotta text them if not they're gonna cut you off let them catch you off examine when you have been cut off look at your life with God [Applause] you will notice when they catch you off you get more closer to God when you're trying to blend you begin to compromise with God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you got your answer now so whoever was pulling chill out everything is okay don't try to blend in this world thank you you want to blend with the Devil the children of the of the Kingdom don't understand many things they are the children are wiser they can tell who you are you just don't know who you are but you just trying to copycat be after the people they go this way you go this way leave them alone they know what there is in you they don't want you around stay away it's good [Laughter] don't baby nobody don't buy friendship [Music] too much work you the only one calling them they don't call you you're the one leaving your house to visit them they don't come to visit you come on you see how much work you put yourself in God say if you come to me I will give you father I will give you mother I will give you brother I will give you sister people that are right there for you and sometimes we neglect those because we want to please somebody else why God give you a backup and you'll see that back up all the time is there anything we can do for you no you don't want this you want the popular one and the popular one is chasing you away you don't understand your caliber [Music] you don't understand your caliber the day you will know who you are you will be confident okay let me go where I was going please you keep pulling that attention come out of here my people that should be not partaker of her water you see somebody is in there but he doesn't partake of the sin so God knows where to block you I don't understand there are people who will never blaspheme the Holy Ghost no matter how bad you get no matter how disappointed you again you say I don't like God anymore there is certain words that will never come out of your mind because somebody is controlling them [Music] if I can get where I want it to God help me then you will see how you and God blend if I can get where I'm going there are letters in you and God have letters and those two letters combined and you will see those letters just come every time amen your boss showed me that last time last night and I begin to dance downstairs and I was dancing slowly so my wife doesn't hear because she's going to come and say what is going on there then I have to tell her and I was dancing on Happy Days oh happy [Music] we are just at the beginning buddy amen glory to God jump to verse 8. coming to church is good therefore shall her plague come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be orderly water [Music] this woman this church this cage will be burned by fire this Babylon the Great Babylon the Great Babylon day great we're gonna see who's Babylon the great will be burned amen when they say burning it is not that people will put fire and torches and go and begin to burn the houses it's a prophetic language that's not the burning amen the prophet could only use the language of their time even if they see an airplane they will look they will look they look they don't understand an airplane and the prophet just cried he said I see the wings of ego that's how the prophet was speaking if they look they see a Mercedes they turn they say I see Chariot no no no no horses and they have eyes like flame that's how the prophet described amen so when fire is coming boom the prophet look you just say I See Fire they cannot use your language your language is atomic bomb bomb hydrogen bomb and things like that the prophet were not living in that time we okay amen glory to God Amen burn with fire for strong is the Lord God who judges him verse 9 and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall be well here amen and lamb and lament for her when they shall see the water of her water so something will happen to Babylon until smoke will arise it is not your fire you cannot burn a city like that anybody okay you remember Sodom was burned and and Abraham Could See Fire from there that fire was not coming from people it was a fire that was dropping from heaven we okay now okay job to verse 16. and saying alas alas that great city that was clove in water last Sunday we found out that the bride was clove in water look at this woman this city is also closing Finland amen these are people watching the city this is not the prophet the prophet to watch the city in the in Revelation 17. in Revelation 18 everybody's watching and when the looking they say the city was clothed with fine learning so naturally speaking this city have fine learning naturally speaking it is a religious good City you have Christianity but it's not so Babylon the great got fine learning naturally amen naturally he looks religious just like the brother amen so you cannot Trace her naturally you need to take the wings to go up with it amen clove in fine learning and purple and Scarlet and Deck with gold and precious stone and water don't forget your microphone let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go based on the ability you have given me and father when it comes to speaking unfolding your word and bringing a revelation that will change and transform the lives of the people he only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your congregation and to your children bless us as we commit this service unto the hand sealing every demonic spirit away from this place and only looking unto thee the author and the finisher of our faith we humbly ask it father in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God I'm going to remind you again brother Branham say now let this be known scripture does not play with words I was checking the microphone whatever is in the record is therefore the anointed eyes to see it is there for Earth still shaking is your microphone working perfect a little bit higher purpose higher purpose that's it okay amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the trinity and two Seven Hills not one seven here two Seven Hills before I move on my subject this morning is the four phases of roof number one the trinity and two Seven Hills so the total is fourteen Hills we are still in the threshing floor still dealing with the parable of the Virgin and we're dealing with the second one and in our Tabernacle language again we are very very very deep in the holiest we already added that we have the water you must come by the blood and you get entered by the spirit still the same work and the different name justification sanctification the blood and the baptism of the Holy Spirit which bring the spirit of God into your life Jesus says this in Luke chapter 11 verse 24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walked through Dry places seeking rest and founded none he say I will return unto my house so they got so used to you until they're calling you their house everybody care who gave them the tired of Thee everybody okay I will return unto my house when sir came out and when he cometh he found defeat to how and water so the house was completely clean amen then he goes he doesn't enter then he goes then goes here and taketh to him seven are the spirit more wicked than himself and they enter in and do out there and the last state now it's eight demon at the beginning he was one when the one comes he comes and takes seven and he makes eight amen and the last state of damn man is worse than the water first in other words you cannot stay empty you cannot stop at only taking the devil out and cleaning the house you must fill that house with something because the devil that left will come back brother Branham interpret this this way glory to God brother but I'm saying now watch this evil spirit when he goes out he walk in Joy places hunting a place to find rest the Bible say he could not find it so he said I will return back to where I come out to where I come out of her he goes back to this person which is the house that he once was in and found the house all swept clean up and water we okay now so you cannot stop at sanctification it's a dangerous game that's why you see people coming into the message giving their life into Jesus Christ and they get their life Sanctified and after a while the bad habits keep coming back because they never move into the holiest and the devil is coming back again and searching the house and saying where is that man that can block me that's why you see somebody struggling with pornography and pornography goes away but once pornography is gone away he will come back again and for seven months you are not watching pornography and after seven months you don't understand for some reason you back again to the same thing what is bringing you back again it is a signal that the house is still empty foreign sanctify all condemnation gone oh I just really happy believer and oh just a really happy believer but it's water that's why you hear people coming up say oh that meeting was so good praise the Lord I felt the anointing you can feel the anointing but that anointing might make sure that anointing is in you not just over you because after a while you're gonna find yourself in trouble again up and down up and down and you're making yourself worse but Branham continue he said come here set another Spirit worse than he was will you please try to get this the Bible said that is the truth Jesus say it's the truth and he come back to this house a man who has confessed Christ to be his savior after the president altar has got rid of his wickedness has quit his water quit his water his water his water he's already in the Holy he has become sanctified clean out his house is all swept he feel free so he come back and he found a house then he goes and gets seven other Spirit words than he was and comes into this person the Bible says the last estate of the man is seven times worse than he was at the water so what I'm trying to say is never get satisfied to stop at the holiest make sure you go all the way down and you get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and the spirit of the Lord so when the devil are coming back again when they see the Holy Spirit when they see the strong men of the house then they know that the property that they thought was their property is no longer the property anymore somebody else has put claims on the house now the house belongs to God and forever that demon will never bother you so examine your life and look how Devils goes up and down and you're going to find out that you're still struggling in an area in other words walk back in the Tabernacle and you'll find out where you are whether you are in justification for whether you are in sanctification or whether you have the true baptism of the holy spirit because at the baptism of the holy spirit this is when you get your rest no more fighting you're not doing the fighting it is the spirit of the Lord doing the fighting because when the demon come you don't know you have found yourself only redoing the things that you stop doing amen so when he comes the Bible said that the holy of Israel doesn't sleep he doesn't even Slumber so somebody is 24 hours putting his weather around you and making sure not therefore can enter your house anymore when that demon Spirit comes back he found the Holy Spirit sitting while standing right there tapping his foot like that when the demons see the Holy Spirit he just turned around and he goes back again that's why you need the Holy Ghost and make sure you got the Holy Ghost to stand between you and Satan everybody okay so far my airplane is still going this way glory to God Amen now we are dealing with the subject of the Beast brother Branham says this that the Beast from the beginning was the beast in the Garden of Eden we okay we got a beast from the beginning in the beginning we are in the Garden of Eden amen and we saw that Beast was the serpent we already went through this amen now brother Branham say that he wants the beast in the Garden of Eden he is the Beast also at the end and it shows that he is a religious person and a water at the beginning he is a beast in the Garden of Eden we call him the serpent the old serpent which was the devil Satan amen Lucifer now at the end follow me carefully now in the end this Beast is a religious person amen and we explain to you that the religious person is a man black came amen and sometimes that Beast is also a denomination and the denomination is a church which is a woman anybody care and brother Branham say not only is he a denomination but it's a denomination that made the water the denomination in other words it's a church that makes church just like the church that bring forth the churches in other words it's a church that have daughters amen other women amen but those women will look like their mother everybody okay when these women are born they are virgin everybody okay at the beginning there will be good but after a while as they grow up they will begin to prostitute themselves and behave like their mother everybody okay so when you are dressing the beast at the end time sometimes the Beast will pop up like a religious man everybody okay and sometimes the Beast will come down as a woman everybody okay everybody okay this religious person here do you follow me won't be a prophet amen but he's going to be a false one amen this woman here will be a prophetess but she won't be a wrong one amen so when you are tracing the Beast today sometimes you will see that Beast appearing as a man amen sometimes you will see that Beast appearing as a woman everybody care both of them are beasts we okay glory to God where are you going amen this woman right here will be an immoral woman open proverb chapter 9. glory to God A Hallelujah Proverbs chapter 9. so sometime when you go back to the Book of Revelation you will see the Bible saying the Beast and sometimes the Bible say he and sometimes the Bible say hey you will see that moving like that you need to detect when it's a man or when it's a woman everybody okay praise God don't never chase him like he's just a man the woman will bite you everybody okay proverb chapter 9 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say a foolish woman you see that is clamorous she is simple and also nothing for she sit at the door of her house and on a seat in a high places in the high places of the city what is she doing there verse 15 to call passenger those that are passing by who God right on their ways who so is simple let him turn here it's a woman standing there telling the people whoever is simple come here come here to do what amen verse 16 whoso is simple in other words whoever is naive let him turn in here and as for him that want understanding remember Eve wanted understanding as for him don't want understanding she says to him what let's my brother stolen waters are water so this woman can make you drink um this woman can give you a drink remember she's making people drink the wine of her fornication we okay now stolen water are sweet those water are stolen so it's not rightly given and when we stay stolen water in Proverbs 5 we know what it means because Solomon said go drink water from your own sister that's right you don't know the scripture you know the scripture if you don't know raise your hand stop right there go to proverb 5. I don't want to leave anybody behind amen proverb chapter 5 verse 15. if you dare you can say amen amen verse 15 drink Waters out of your own water sisters this system is not a tank somewhere yeah watch the system and running water out of your own well let your fountain be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the street let them be only your own in other words for this system you must be very stingy you can give somebody water from your refrigerator but not this one this one is for only one person [Music] let's continue reading let your fountain be dispersible and we first of water in the street verse 17 let them be only your own and no stranger with water we cannot share this sister what is the sister and pastor job to verse 18 let your fountain be blessed and rejoice with water the wife of water of Water [Music] everybody okay so a woman is a system so let's go back again now where we were in proverb 9. verse 17. I just ran away from there because marriage is pulling me there amen you there verse 17 stolen Waters you see now it's not the correct water somebody's stealing water from somebody it's an adultery we clear now stolen water are sweet how can adultery be sweet the first sin that enter into Earth entered through adultery of evil remember that's why when brother Branham went to hell brother Branham remember only one thing he said I never committed adultery why did adultery Came From Hell because that was the original sin can we continue stolen water are sweet and bread eaten you remember so is the way of a woman that eateth and wipe of a mouth and say I have done because it's an adulterous woman so an adulterous woman can both give you drink and eat remember drink and bread amen glory to God he said stolen water are sweet and bread eating in water Secret in secret somebody's stealing something is Pleasant but the naive he knows not that the dead are dead so the house of that woman that give people Sweet Water sweet stolen water and bread eating in secret that house has dead people in it amen he knows not that the dead are dead amen and that her guest are in the water depth of water [Applause] so if you drink from this woman I can go even in the mark of the beast now in Revelation if you drink from this woman ever you eat from this woman you already enter in the depth of hell remember the system of Satan Satan uses a beast plus a come on brother we okay so far where are you taking me my brother when we spoke about Daniel too and Daniel 7 we found out that Daniel 2 has five parts it's for Kingdom but five part of Branham says this that herein is revealed an exact account of future I feel history that was prophesied to come upon the Earth from the time of Daniel until Jesus would come and reign as the son of water so what the Brahman is saying that this Kingdom started from Daniel and they will go all the way to the coming of Jesus as the son of David amen we know that Jesus coming as a son of David he's coming to establish the millennium because Jesus came three times the first time he came alone to redeem his brother the second time it's what we call the Rapture he's coming to pick up his brother but the third time he's coming with his blood remember in Revelation 19 last Sunday when he was coming on the White Horse and the Army was following behind we and our maker we are coming back to destroy the kingdom of Satan that coming he's coming as the son of David [Applause] it is known as the time of the water he had within it four historical division which were known by the dominating Empire in each division the Babylonian we went through this the middle pigeon we went through this decoration we went through this and the water and we found out that the part of Rome the last part have is divided in half everybody here brother Branham said that the former Kingdom were typified as pure mineral Babylon was pure ago middle pigeon was pure silver amen the Greek Empire was pure brass this last empire was pure iron at the beginning pure iron only in the water but when he came to the feet he was the water of iron and water and mineral and salt just don't mix and produce cons uh uh constancy and strength this last empire the Roman will endure in its peculiar mixtape right up until Jesus what returns which return as the son of David this Roman Empire empire and great destructive force against water opposition Rome fell paid an imperial Rome fell Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death you remember that Rome could now could not now rule it's it's it was all over so that the world amen when the people saw Rome crumbling they thought the Empire is finished brother Branham says so thought to the world but how wrong the world was for that head remember that Sunday though wounded was not wounded anti-water brother Branham continues here he says people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that room with her strict confines where the pope has a natural area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receive ambassadors Papa false Christian Rome she's even called The Eternal City her Blasphemous now controlled by religion even more heavily than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by pure iron or Force Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine John church and state and back up the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivate first Christian you can see that is because you know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in each other but the spirit remained the water so we explained to you last Sunday that when this Kingdom moved from Pure iron into a mixing of iron and Clay on the other vision of Daniel in Daniel chapter 7 it is interpreted as this Beast receiving a wound but they won't get healed so the Pagan Empire escape and enter in a religious Empire everybody okay if you notice on Daniel 7 all we have here a beast the first one is a lion the second one is a bear amen the third one is a leopard and there is something very peculiar about the third one which is the Greek Empire brother Branham says this he says that the Christian age whose King was the most brilliant of our military leaders the world has ever known so it was fitly typified as the belly and the tie of water what brother Branham is saying here is at the beginning we got a lion we okay and after lion we see a bear amen after bear we see a military a leopard which is appearing with a great military chief everybody Kia everybody okay but all this Kingdom will gather together into one everybody okay because that last Kingdom according to Revelation 13 was a mixture of the Lion the bear and the leper all mixed together and when all of them are mixed together this is when the storm is coming down foreign never the shoulder never the time the Bible said that the stone hit the feet you can read your scripture home in other words that stone will destroy Rome not as an Empire that's right come on that's why their Kingdom that's why the disciple asked Jesus Christ are you now restoring the kingdom Jesus said not now because now I'm dealing with Roman Pagan he was the Roman that hung Jesus At The Cross if I destroyed them now they're going to escape they're going to go into a religious I have to wait until Rome get into his last stage in other words from this state here there is no more progression of Rome amen the word Rome is stuck Rome is put at the corner he cannot go back he cannot move anymore that's when the storm is coming to destroy not only the Roman Empire but the stone is destroying the Babylonian Empire they made operation Empire and then the Grecian Empire all of them mixed together in one Beast and that will happen when Jesus is coming as the son of who amen what are you trying to say by the son of David the Bible says this first Samuel chapter 17 verse 36. David says that that servant shlew above the water let's go slowly let's go slowly let's go slowly this is David speaking anybody care are we okay are we okay did I lost somebody why did David have to first kill the lion [Music] why was the first enemy of David he must be the lion and the next enemy of David must be water why [Music] everybody okay everybody okay [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] that servant slew both water and the water this water fill his sin shall be as water because Goliath was a mighty military man [Applause] but here the first destruction is a lion the second destruction is a bear the third distraction must be a great military man so David look he said I already destroyed the first Kingdom I already destroyed the second Kingdom now it's a military manner [Applause] everybody okay that's why when Jesus comes as the son of water he can take all of them together and wife them in one time we okay Philistine will be as one of them scripture don't play with words everybody okay because that anointing on David is the anointing of the son of David amen when he comes as the son of David he can destroy the bear he can destroy the lion he can destroy also the military man which all three combine into the Roman Empire in other words David has the power to destroy the Roman Empire everybody okay seeing he has defiled the water off the water in Revelation 19 when Jesus is coming back the Bible said there is another water who was that army so when the Rome is trying to persecute the bread [Applause] let me continue my way David said the Lord that has delivered me out of the power of the water out of the power of daughter he will deliver me out of the hand of this water and he told Goliath I'm gonna cut your head off because the seed of the woman will always aim for the head of Satan everybody okay so far are we okay you want to go home let's continue glory to God last Sunday we found out that there is a trinity we okay in Satan amen we found out that Moses and Elijah when they finish their prophecy the Bible says that the Beast came and killed them amen and then in three days they revived and they went to heaven and after that what followed was the battle of Armageddon don't worry about it put it on the Shelf because it's a deep teaching okay and at the end of Armageddon because Armageddon is the third world war which is the third world the Bible said whoa whoa whoa those three words are War I'm gonna deal with it later on don't worry about it amen at the end of the Armageddon we found out that the Beast and the false prophet was taken together and put in the Lake of Fire but the devil Escape because when judgment hit the serpent the serpent I mean the old serpent became a snake but Satan left him God struck the Judgment by Satan Escape amen now in Revelation 20 we found out last Sunday this is where we stop that here he there there is an angel coming down he shall lay the hold on the Dragon the old serpent which is the devil and Satan and banned him for what after a thousand years they will release against Satan that's when come the Battle of Gog and Magog don't worry about those battles leave them alone we will handle them later amen the Bible says in Revelation 20 verse 10 that the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beasts and the first prophet are so now we got three elements wow this message is perfectly in line with the scripture we got a trinity of Satan that's why Trinity is of the devil [Applause] everybody here the Father the spirit and the son all three are one we okay the first one is the Devil Himself the second one is the false prophet we okay and the third one is the Beast what is going on my friend amen glory to God let's go slowly now in Revelation 16. put your seat belt we okay the Bible says and I saw three unclean spirit like frogs come out of the mouth of the water dragon we know the dragon is the devil and the old serpent so this man will produce a frog let's go slowly don't worry my friend and out of the mouth of water and out of the mouth of water so everybody produce one frog how many frogs do we have and how many did they start so three gave birth to three we're going slowly I'm reading the Bible if you have a problem open your scripture and verify I don't want you to say brother Steven Say Amen and they these frogs they are the spirit of devils working water miracles you need to be careful with your miracle oh I see the Pentecostal that preacher is doing miracle let me continue which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the whole word to do what for water of the great day of water so this Spirit have a mission they are going to recruit people for the battle of Armageddon come on everybody okay but on the on this side also God sent a message that is recruiting also people for the battle of Armageddon so the reason recruiting God's camp and the reason we could in certain camp and we're gonna meet you all together in the battlefield of Armageddon your boss is dropping things left and right this my goodness give me time please because nothing's changed amen if you notice this scripture these frogs are recruiting by miracles [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and God also before he catches the effect he would throw Miracle as the faithful and then he we pull the second bone and the third four he catches you so both sides are using miracle for for recruitment [Applause] [Music] everybody okay he depends on Whose child do you belong if you got something in your heart that is blending with God you're gonna recognize what is coming from God Amen because you're not gonna be deceived if your name was written in the last book of life before the foundation of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] did I lose anybody I'm gonna lift the ship again okay glory to God brother Branham says this my goodness I'm good in time so chill out brother Barnum says this notice where they came from the Trinity of frog came out of a Nord Trinity give birth to a new Trinity uh-huh the water let's continue what he came out of it a trinity the Dragon where his body but I'm getting this their Beast and the water where is brother Brian I'm getting this this message is biblical a trinity a new one from when where this frog come out when did it brother Branham said the Frog are coming out but when are we gonna see the Frog come out in this earth brother Branham say notice they were there all the time so when the devil was working the devil had a frog the Beast also had the Frog and the first prophet had the Frog but they could not vomit those frogs until a certain time because the battle is not ready yet they have to wait also for the end time there was there all the time but it was not manifested until between the waters and the water stop there what is a vowel we went through this in a hotel Let me refresh you when God sent the message amen the message comes like a thunder we okay and the Thunder unfold and released the message of God we okay and the messenger come and he catches the inspiration of the Thunder and the messenger goes and preached that message or he brought the trumpet everybody okay when he blows the trumpet the elect of God of that time will heal the trumpet and they will come and receive the word of God everybody okay so some people will reject that trumpet and when God will finish receiving all his elect you following me amen he take them away and God brings judgment which is called The Vow everybody okay so this far is not the first one it is not the second vowel it is between the and the water so we got seven changes power preaching after Paul the first vowel and when you speak up after I reduce the second file more to pick up after Mountain the third verse Columbus pickup after Columbus the fourth one loot the pickup after Luther the fever then Wesley pickup you okay now afterwards let the water so the seven messenger have to come we okay now and when he pick up after his message then comes the water so in between Wesley and the pouring off of the rejection of brother Branham that's in between that time that's when the Frog will appear in other words the Frog will appear in the edge of laodicea and there will appear at the end time before the vowel is dropped did I lose anybody why are they appearing only at the end time because brother Branham say all this time the Frog were there but they were hiding but why do they come up only allow these such a changes brother Branham says this for in this what the problem say but it was manifested he was not manifested until between the sixth and the seventh hour just before the water everybody here so something was hidden that we did not know [Applause] but here so God pushed the devil to vomit everything that he has but here when he vomited he knew brother Branham is there now when brother Branham look at that wow he get the knowledge of what it is and now he have to break this hill to explain you what the devil is doing are we okay you don't play with the opening of the field because if the seals are not open you won't understand it but the bottom says this he said he wants be dressed before the seals open to the water because they still have to explain you what is going on Amen for in the message of the Seven Angels the water mysteries of God so the devil gotta pull everything he has God have to go in the back of the devil and beat him vomit everything quickly because I must open the seals pour everything you have when he finished he said now with the American Branham unfold him to my children let my children know how to trust him in every aspect [Music] [Applause] all these teen Italian friends and false baptism and everything wants to be water main man God help us see what is truthful [Music] everybody okay so now we got a trinity and another Trinity this one is recruiting people for the fight this one also is still there we're dealing with two trinities now what are you trying to say Pastor glory to God but I'm saying he is himself a trinity that is what he's made up of he writes in a trinity remember all three powers has to command into one the bear the lion and then the leopard all of them make one they first sealed the second seal the third seal all three still make he always work with three okay his power is in a trinity his crown is in a trinity his horse is in a trinity that is what he is a trinity a power of Trinity a crown of Trinity a horse of Trinity that is of offices a four again the fourth one three stages of his water makes him walk one certain incarnate three stages the Antichrist then first prophet then water damn tree tapping now there is three tabs and that makes him God makes himself not to in water water and water and water where did Brother Adam get this you remember your Tabernacle makes a Christian a water Son of God by the word of God and this true power makes him air devil and there he is water blood and spirit which is of god that is politics religion and Demon power mixed together makes him water the devil what are you trying to say pastor this is where I'm heading you ready brother Barnum said he could not be an antichrist only in spirit then he became an antichrist and that Spirit took a man that thought a teacher the same thing that that Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he became a false prophet to the Antichrist Spirit now finally he becomes a beast so brother Branham say when he start he's going to start as the devil which we call him the Antichrist after this Antichrist he will move into a false prophet after false prophet then he will become the Beast let's go slowly brother random say as certain Trinity lays like that Satan all the time Satan Antichrist Spirit Antichrist Spirit incarnate then he becomes a false prophet and then he becomes a beast not a demon the Beast is not a demon that was in that Antichrist but when Satan himself is kicked out he comes down and take over the place where the demon was the devil then the devil is Incarnate in a man it's just water preparing it what are you talking about when Satan is in a spirit realm he is the devil you follow me follow me very careful when Satan begin to use a human heart you following me you're following me he becomes the false prophet amen but when Satan himself entered that human being now that human being is the Beast let me go slowly we have a human being that human being at the beginning he only have the anointing of the Antichrist on him he is an antichrist amen when he moved from here that person will now give his heart to the Antichrist spirit amen the spirit will incarnate him but here here now he becomes a false prophet remember your serpent amen when he comes the first prophet the the first prophet the third stage it is not going to be an anointing anymore it is going to be said to himself baptizing that person with the fullness of Satan badly open your bubble I'm sorry buddy this is a juicy LongHorn steak let's go to Luke chapter six if I can trace this quickly then we get where we're going to Luke chapter six if you dare you can say Amen what I'm doing right now if you go back you put the the first seal the second seal the Churchill you will be sitting just laughing what people were saying oh I can't read the seal I don't understand now go back and read the sale Luke chapter six if you dare you can say amen amen Luke chapter 6 verse 13. everybody okay and when he was there he called to him his disciple and one of n of them he chose how many who was choosing the disciple glory to God whom also he named apostle verse 14 sermon who also he named Peter Andrew his brother James and John Philip and bartolome Matthew and Thomas James the son of our fears and someone called Zealot and Judah the brother of James and Judas Iscariot which also was a traitor who chose Judas when they picked Judah was Judah bad he was a good boy we okay praise God open John chapter 6. now right here according to Luke Judah is a good boy he was chosen by Christ anybody okay I'm showing you the three steps of the Antichrist okay John chapter six if you dare you can say amen amen job to verse 64. glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen but there are some of you that believe not so the good boy was preaching the gospel but he doesn't believe the message himself he was casting out devils but he himself and the message they were not one the message that he was preaching and he himself they were not one but all along he can preach the gospel oh my God push your brakes man everybody okay but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who dare where that believe not and who should water betray him so even when he's choosing Judas he knew that Judas will betray him and yet he taught you that to go preach the gospel and when Judah went Judah was performing miracle I'm going slowly so I can shake you off completely so somebody being in this message doesn't mean anything we must watch you what you're doing everybody okay jump down to verse 70. Jesus answer have I not chose you 12 remember look and one of you is a what amen who chose the devil [Music] Judah is now decoded as the devil this is that safe for the Lord it is Jesus Christ himself verse 71 he spoke of Judas he's carried the son of someone for he he was that should betray him being one of the waters so Judas at the beginning is a good boy but yet it's a devil everybody okay but the wings of the son of man are controlling the devil Jesus is still in his ministry Jesus is powerful Judas cannot do anything Judas can only obey him obey him obey him because Jesus is still under his ministry his ministry is not finished yet as long as the wing of the eagle are flapping Judas is powerful he's powerless everybody with me glory to God go to John chapter 13. everybody okay everybody okay let's go to John chapter 13. amen now the wings of the ego are about to be plucked off the power of Jesus is going to decrease now because he finished his ministry almost verse one you there now before the Feast of the past of I'm stealing John we move from John 6 to John 13. you put 6 plus 13 you take 6 to 13 it's seven verses [Laughter] your job just just drop it it's not me my friend amen now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew watch carefully that is our was calm that he should water now the wings of the ego are going to be plucked off we okay that is ours should be that he should depart out of this world to the father having love his own which were in the world he loved them to the water what carefully first too and suffer being water and dude that anointing now is coming to Judah because Jesus is about to go now the door begin to open to the Antichrist the Antichrist the devil begin to come toward Judah because Judah by Nature he is a devil the wings of the ego will were blocking him now the anointing is coming now the devil when the anointing comes first he just take the heart remember when he comes first watch your preacher he only take the heart everybody okay verse two and supper being ended the devil having now put in the water the devil didn't get yet in he just put in the heart a human heart is given him are we okay the devil has been put in the heart of Judah is coyote someone's son to the water so now that anointing of the Antichrist is now in the heart of Judah now Judah who was working for Jesus Christ now already turned his heart against Jesus Christ to be healed to betray him amen but the devil is not inside Judah yet everybody okay everybody okay so Judah moved from here brother Robert now Judy's right here but right here the Devil Himself must do what we okay job to verse 18. you there amen I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eats bread with me has lift up his heel against me everybody okay now I tell you before he comes that when it comes to pass you may believe that I am he everybody okay verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever Ascend receiveth me job to verse 21 when Jesus has that say he was troubled in his spirit and testify and say verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me everybody okay then the disciple looked to one another doubting of whom he spoke and when they were and where and now there was there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of the disciples whom Jesus what love you know that disciple right his name was who who wrote the Book of Revelation who have the answer to that we okay job to verse 24 Psalm Peter therefore reckon beckon to him that he should ask who should be of whom he spoke then he then lying on Jesus breast said to him Lord who is it Jesus said one of you will betray me someone look he say has seen the connection between Jesus and John I know if you really want to know the secret you must go to John because John is a type of the Bride the bride can lay on your bosom and you are happy everybody okay so Peter beckon he say s uh John turn around he say who is it father everybody okay you love this scripture watch what happened the first 26 Jesus answer he it is to whom I shall give what when I deep it and when he had dipped the soap he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of who Simon verse 27 and after the shop what happened Satan did water can you say louder set and did what now he was not just a thought now the devil entered into Judah now Judah became the Beast everybody okay so first he starts as an antichrist then he gets a false prophet then after the first prophet he said what and the devil enter Satan enter into him then said Jesus to him that you do do it to how quickly job to go to Luke chapter 22 then I'm gonna run quick oh God Abraham dropped these things quickly he didn't have time so now we know we need to take time to make it clear so the bride is going to be clear Luke chapter 22 go to verse 1. now the Feast of the unleavened bread June 9 which is called the Passover and the chief priests and described sought how they might kill him for they feel the people you there Dan who entered who Satan Satan into who Judah everybody okay everybody okay that's why brother Branham says this that Judas Iscariot was the son of Satan the Son of Perdition he was a devil manifested in flesh not at the beginning but he have to go through the stages the Bible said he was the Bible say he was born the son of what brother Brahman said that you that Spirit came back as a rather on the White's horse so when Jesus died on the cross Judas also went and hanged himself so Jesus releasing the Holy Ghost Judas also releasing Satan and both of them come in the church the beast at the beginning and the Beast said the same he was white so close to the wheel just as Judah was so close to Jesus a crown was given to him that Spirit was now in the leader of the nicolaitan system and he was a triple crown Pope who sat as God in his Temple calling himself Vicar of Christ if Vicar of Christ means instead of Christ or in the place or on behalf of God then the pope was calling himself the Holy Ghost and deposing their Holy Spirit acting for that was judah's spirit in him doing that amen so when you come to the churches the first plus the second plus the third give you what but remember that in this age call the pergamas we found out that the Antichrist was given a crown brother Branham says this he said when the neglected Spirit the Antichrist is finally finally he's incarnated in man that is what he received a human heart when he start off he was just a nicolating spirit in the church he's a spirit you can cry on a spirit but 300 years later he became and then they crowned him he had a crown to start with but he got a grant he had no crime to start with but he got a crime when that Spirit became water incarnate he become a man the neglect and Doctrine become a man then they could do water what are you trying to say brother Stephen after a while he was given a crown because you can't put a crown on the spirit head this Spirit becomes incarnated in the second work of his dispensation of his Mystic the second word he become Quran a weapon false prophet then he's working for the water thanks I Christ Spirit everybody clears so far why was Satan incarnate only in the age of Perkins I'm good in time but the Bible says this to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things say he which had a what with water images what are you writing I know that work that dwells even where so when they say in the churches that pagamas have the seat of Satan because the pope is there and that hold is fast my name and has not denied my faith even those days where in antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you were Satan dwelleth how can Satan dwell in paragamos brother random say where did Babylon move from from Babylon up to pergamus Satan shifted his word see I wish I could go through all the revelation where are you going brother Stephen but how did pergamos become the seat of Satan if Babylon was the seat we Okay we okay the answer again is in history when Babylon fell to the middle Persian the priest king atalus fled the city and went to pergamas with his priests and sacred Mysteries there he set up his kingdom outside of the Roman Empire and traveled under the care of the devil a succession of priest king follow atalus until the reign of fatalists third who for when for reason known only in the sovereignty of God he will live the kingdom to who so when this man came there he established Babylon in peregamus and Rome didn't have any control of it for some reason after a while a king Rose and took the entire Kingdom and went to Rome and said Rome take the kingdom everybody okay amen and Julius Caesar then took buff the kingdom physically and spiritually for he became the pontiff Maximus of the babylonious religion and was there for what the title begin to go from Emperor to Emperor until Maximus III refused the title amen then the pope took the headship of the emperor rejected and today he's still the what so he moved from Babylon to pergamos pergamos the church pick it up what are you trying to say brother Stephen amen let me skip this for the for the sake of time after the Pope everybody okay after the devil is incarnated into a man everybody okay after the devil become incarnated into a man what follows his water the Bible says in the age of tatarian the next age we okay now Satan pergamos the seat of Satan then tatarian who followed the seat of Satan gave the heart of a man to Lucifer when Lucifer entered he need a wife then tatarian produced the wife I'm going slowly not withstanding I have few things against thee because that suffers the woman who which calleth herself a water Prophet now we got the false prophet and the false prophetess remember the system of the Beast [Applause] everybody okay and to teach and seduce my servant to commit water fornication if it's a woman that woman must have daughters [Music] yeah the beast at the end is a religious person first he is a what a false prophet in paragamas the seat of Satan then in tatarian a woman becomes a water prophetess but that woman must have water we okay now where are her daughters verse 22 I will cast her in the bed and then that commit adultery remember she's a bad woman with her into the Great Tribulation except that repent for their deed and I will kill her what with water so that woman have children so now we can trace that number one he entered pergamos in a man called the pope he become the false prophet then entertainment following that he get into a woman and that woman get daughters the beast at the end did I lose anybody where are you going you know her in the Bible Jezebel she was the wife of Ahab here is the woman the church Jezebel the wife of the false prophet which is supposed to be the genuine prophet of God the Pope the genuine prophet and his wife who Jezebel everybody okay so we found out that when the church age started Judas took his spirit and poured that in the church and the spirit begin to work at the first church and the second church it was just an anointing on the third Church ages called pagamas amen one day when Babylon shifted naturally from Babylon into pergamas then the devil came and entered the Pope but the pope must be connected with a woman then the tatarian produced Jezebel and Jezebel have children now we begin to rather [Music] everybody okay amen where are you going I'm gonna skip some of this thing let me go this way any moral woman is the lowest things that can be thought of in the Earth excuse this young lady she's nothing but a human garbage can which woman not a woman but anymore listen to marriage and divorce good amen and not a woman but a woman that's all she is and immoral woman is a human sexual garbage can in a pollution where filthy dirty ornery Lord and Phil fees response with who that's why you hear she committed fornication she committed fornication she committed fornication everybody okay but the problem says this here he said I'm talking of an immoral now not to you sisters so when you're listening to marriage and divorce take yourself off the picture Amen brother Branham is not talking about you he's talking about any moral woman but the mother was making the women feel bad in marriage and divorce you need to know what you're talking about amen any more woman is the best bet the devil ever had she's worse than all the bad rooms that were ever most she can send more water than all the water that's why when the Antichrist cannot work with a false prophet alone he must combine any moral woman because the more woman knows in proverb how to kill Souls she's calling the people she said come here she knows how to send more Soul To Hell than a man does everybody okay what are you trying to say Isabel the mother of Harlot Revelation water open your Bible now give me a few minutes butter of it let them buckle up you okay give me few minutes

I'm trying to go quick my friend you ready amen verse one and there come one of the seven angels with your Marion brother which had the seven vowels and talk with me saying to me come here I will show you the Judgment of the Great Wall oh that sits upon many what Waters according to one you supposed to see a woman you're supposed to see water and a woman sitting on water okay according to first one that's what we're supposed to see but let's see job two verse two with whom the kingdom of the Earth has committed fornication and the inhabitant of the Earth has made drunk with the one of her water fornication everybody on verse 3 please so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a what woman sit upon a Waters stop did you see that woman sitting on the on the water the woman instead is Seated on a beast everybody okay but the Bible says she's sitting on the water scripture don't play with wood before I go further let me remind you in Revelation 13 the Beast came from what so when you look at this Beast you will see the Beast sitting on water everybody okay this Beast here sits on water but the woman sit on the Beast we must make sure if this beast and that Beast are the same because from Heaven seven had how many horns the Beast is seven heads how many ounces if a woman is sitting really on the water that Beast must match this Beast let's evaluate or examine this Beast let's put our microscope We Ready glory to God my God it's a military airplane my friend we jump to verse 3. so he Carry Me Away in a spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman that sit in a Scarlet Scarlet means what red but the dragon what was his color red let's stop a little bit there we already seen the color red let's continue Oh Glory to God a scarlet color Bed full of name of what that's for me having water seven heads Heaven what and how many horns so now we understand that when they say the woman is sitting on the water she's not really sitting on the water she's sitting upon the Beast that sits upon the Water everybody here now this Beast is joined with a woman Beast and the water Saturn is deadly now can I continue or you want to stop here continue I'm going to skip a lot of stuff now job to verse job to versa job to verse five and upon her forward was a name written mystery Babylon Babylon the water great so remember I told you at the beginning remember Babylon the great of Revelation 17. so Babylon the great is a woman she's a cage she's an immoral woman she's a garbage can of every unclean spirit because she's a harlot everybody here Babylon the great the mother of water remember that woman must have children and her children also are Hollows the system is clear because the serpent have to unite with Eve to destroy Adam the serpent the dragon get into the Beast and the Beast has to reunite with a woman To Go destroy the serpent have to use a beast and the Beast have to unite in a woman in order to destroy the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end job to verse 6. and I saw the woman everybody see not the Beast the woman drunken with the blood remember the rumen of revelation of proverb now she was the one that was killing amen the woman is the Destroyer that's why she's drunk with the blood of the people because once Satan which the third level of a woman he began to kill everybody okay praise God drug with the blood of the sand and with the blood of the Martyr of Jesus and when I saw her I wonder with great admiration everybody here and the angels said to me why wherefore did you mother I will tell you the mystery of the water

glory to God glory to God glory to God amen almost there uh-huh there we go come on that's it right there okay he said but when they come into Pagan home through the Catholic Church through papalism he never ceases if one pop does dies they set up for what another one one pop dies they set up a what another one the best which was which is not and which is what the Beast is a religious person and he's also air which is a what church we okay let me hurry up here brother I'm saying the beasts now the Beast was not the king he was one witches which is not and yet he's and he's not yetis and it's not what is it a succession of Pope a power a beast rolling that is when Pagan Rome was converted to make water the pope is a spiritual King that is the reason he is what spiritual King claims to be water everybody okay let me skip this one and then I'm gonna get here amen job 2 revelation 17. and I'm gonna finish here glory to God good job to verse 9. everybody okay brother Branham says this

water this woman this church sits on my mini Mountain so you have one two three four five six seven I'm just giving an Administration brother Branham says this he said there is two cities that are North that has seven or more mountain in it Cincinnati is one of them which is supposed to be the fiction story of Cincinnati it's mother wolf but there is no one no one Church dominating Cincinnati so it's not Cincinnati you must be seven heads seven mountains but you must dominate the world seven heads seven heads which was on the Beast is seven here on which his cities now what city is built on Seven Hills the congregation say Rome exactly a city sitting on seven here a church a woman a prostitute that's a control the water so this woman these seven heads everybody here let me get this

I found it thank you God verse one you there amen hang five minutes and we drop out and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw the Beast rise up out of the sea having how many heads seven heads and ten horns and upon his horn how many crowns and upon his head the seven heads was what how many names do you see there One Singular everybody okay everybody okay this beasts have seven heads all seven heads amen have one name singular on them everybody here and the Bible say these seven said are seven mountains everybody here so this is my seven mountains Heaven name do you follow me do you follow me I'm gonna drop the Bible says this in Jeremiah 51 he said I will run the unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Calvin all the evil that they have done in Zion in your sight say the Lord behold I am against thee or destroying what mountain so Babylon is a mountain amen but that mountain according to revelation 17 have Seven Hills amen and those heels contain the name everybody okay we got a big mountain the mountain have Seven Hills and those Hill contain a name amen and that Beast is and go down ease and go down east and go down what are you saying he says say the Lord which destroyed the world the earth I will stretch out my hand upon thee and roll deep from there from the rocks and I will make the water remember in Revelations there are verse 18 they are burning here where are you going my brother so we got a big mountain with seven hills and upon those he'll have a name brother Branham say it's standing in the gap was driving with Billy Paul and as they're going with Billy Paul put your seatbelt and I'm gonna drop brother Brandon stop somewhere and saw a mountain I'm letting that soak brother by them say I stop and look up on the mountain and as Sin does Water Seven Hills we okay brother Branham since one month and also everybody okay and the mountain of brother Branham have how many heels can I continue but in the Bible Babylon is a mountain with how many heels but there must be a name on the mountain okay I've seen those seventh year and if you want to see something there was seven Peak on the top of the mountain one mountain that ran several several miles the last Mountain before you go into the other country no more mountain after that there's no more mountain and he was running from east to west everybody okay the mountain set and it was snuck up on the top the first two were small Peaks slow down with me so you got one pick second pick and then who amen and then a large pick and then another water small pick so number three is big and then another small Peak and then what number five and then the water and then a great which is number three five and seven everybody okay and a small Pig than a great large large snow cap mountain and I said Lord I do not understand what that means we okay he said the Lord spoke to brother Branham he said how many pigs are there I said there is how many seven how many letters is in your name seven letters everybody Kia the name of Branham have how many letters yeah b-r-a-n-h-a-m how many letters so God is telling brother Branham that the big mountain that you saw that I have seven here also have a name everybody okay amen is Branham why is God putting the name of brother Branham on Seven Hills while the Vatican City is also sitting on seven here with a name but here everybody here both of them have to meet at the end time [Music] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far the peculiar of the name of brother Branham is the ham [Music] are we okay I know some of you are trembling but I'm gonna drop this my friend brother Branham said God has met Abraham and give him a name from Abram to water Abraham and water we already went through this he addresses them both by the water So when you say Sarah you are talking about a priesthood priesthood was not there because Abraham met Melchizedek which name h-e-m taking part of his name into water Abram h-a-m part of God's name because he wants to be also the father by seed to many water Nations so Abraham can I continue the ham means the father of many nations [Applause] can I continue can I continue amen cannot continue glory to God here was Abraham his name has been changed from Abraham to water Abraham which means water father of Nations and he could not have a baby as long as his name was water he has to be water thanks to Abraham Abraham for ham does mean the father of water Nations the father of water Nations what are you trying to say can I continue amen Abraham H.A.M give somebody the title of a father of many nations everybody here that's why when brother Branham went into the sixth dimension [Music] can I continue when he saw the people he asked God these Brahms [Music] because he was already the father of many nursing but the angel corrected him he said it's not a natural lineage it is a lineage and the Melchizedek they are not pranam but they are the people that you converted you are the father of the faith and that faith is in the message of the hour I said she's going in the world it is picking up Sons and Daughters of God the message is giving birth to Sons and Daughters of God everybody okay so far everybody okay so far notice the airplane is coming this way notice his name changed from water Abram to water to Abraham Amen brother problem is using the terminology ham amen we found out that when the name changed God only added this one are you following me h a because Abraham have already a name I'm going slowly I'm going slowly but when brother Branham speak about the father of nation brother Branham is now using h a only brother Branham is using h a and they let them you okay let's go to our alphabet hey B C d e h i j k l m stop this is what one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen which is the number of what [Music] hahaha come on come on come on come on hey everybody okay amen what are you trying to say Abraham already have led the 13 which is an identification of the brother which is speaking that a part of God will be first in you amen when you are born amen when you are born you already have a part of God as the blood of Jesus Christ you must have damn in you which is your predestinated seed your predestinated seed is a female part do you understand me can I continue when you are born in this world God uses number M and put that in you because you are his brother so you carry a female part of God you are carrying the egg everybody okay then God will send AJ when AJ come is the male partner and the male part will join with the female part and you become part of the family of God [Applause] everybody okay [Music] so when you are born there is a name in you that is coming from God Amen and when the Holy Spirit is coming he's bringing you one an eternity and he's blending with them you become a manifested son of God [Applause] [Music] we also have seven here that's right [Applause] everybody okay brother Robert I don't know how to learn this plane everybody okay everybody okay let's stop here you gotta go home [Music] you give me two minutes just two minutes and we stopped the Bible brother Branham said there was three outstanding pigs those three pigs are the water and the water and the water the first one was your first part of your ministry that's then the first part was pretty high you know the sun in the hand and then come the water the second pool I have had another about a few years just now the little Peak back like my Ministry was not yet then come the third one three is the number of water completion 10 and then five which is the number of water Grace Three we know Perfection he flipped them and seven is the number of water perfect which should be here chair and then completion which is the in six days yusha in the seventh day is the one the end of the week the water what are you trying to say I'm talking about the headship of Christ personally identify by the original water we have the devil everybody here we have the death the answer to the question of the devil where men Glory we have the answer to the devil question who is the answer class is risen and paid the person amen and he's rising up the head the devil can stand it the reason this ecumenical kingdom are setting up that's the reason they're all coming up to what they are doing now they're therefore that's the reason he's hollowing the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been watered you think I'm beside myself I'm not we got the answer the devil answer not me that liveth but who Christ is not my dear it is his water that's why when you have Vatican is preparing with Seven Hills God also has Seven Hills that's gonna match the Vatican amen so the seventh Hill and the Seven Hill and the all of them crashed together we got the devil and sir Hallelujah Oh Glory to God glory to God the Trinity of Satan and the two seven here no matter what the Vatican is doing God also blessed Seven Hills in America one mountain with seven people which include the three pools together amen and if you notice the pop which is and is and is yet to come if you notice the ministry of brother Branham it is and it's yet to come it is any chance you come if it goes up and it goes down it goes up and he goes up he's matching the Beast so if the Beast goes up we go up if he goes down we go down with him if he goes out we go up with him if he goes down we go down [Applause] glory to God oh my God oh God [Applause] why the problem saying brother random say it's practically that now you can't go to church and preach unless you have the fellowship card or some identification on person like ourselves we are going to be cut off for all of that that's exactly because we don't want we won't be able to do it it is tightening that when that time comes the Press come to a place that we are pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you now watch water so as the Vatican is going up we also are growing here don't be afraid of seven here we have our Seven Hills we have a Ministry that have the triples that Ministry can match the devil everywhere if the three four do Miracle we can still do miracle if they prophesy we have prophecy but they don't have the opening of the word which we have which is the temple we got the answer to certain questions fear not little brother you are not alone we got the devil's effort let them do what they were doing let them do what they want to do we got the answer when the squeeze come watch the Deadpool We're Not Gonna Be coward we will be speaking the word there will be a demonstration that will show this world that's the bread of Jesus Christ was there because when I was born I got number 13 which is not the American number 13 but the Heavenly number 13. that's gonna match number eight to number one and when number eight the number one match with me I'm gonna manifest the Son of God glory to God let's give the Lord a cleverly foreign [Applause] we gotta stop let's pray let's pray Oh Glory to God this message is everything that you need this message is the truth this message is the only hope that can separate you from Babylon foreign the devil is unveiled no matter how he's gonna hide we can see him we can detect him because we got our ego wings [Music] if there is one thing you need to cherish cling to this message obey the message do what the message tell you to do because the more you become the message the more Babylon lose you on his way down [Music] brother Branham is gone but that sun is still there to remind you that the bride have a Ministry that can match the ministry of the devil that's why we have his answer we also have Seven Hills amen God the devil coming down God also is coming down into his brother and the brother and groom are going to be one when he will begin to fight you he will see a woman pulling him up and put him down he said a normal woman is not that strong it is not a woman it is the Christ that is in the woman amen amen the Bible said war to the inhabitant of the earth and the water that's why when the mighty Angel is coming down where is he putting his foot where is he putting his foot on the earth and on water he's blocking the two beasts he's saying Lord of blood fear not he won't like a lion he ran with the Thunders because he's controlling the two Beasts of the devil are under our feet fear not John you are worthy take the book and eat eat quickly eat the book quickly I am I am holding those power until you become the book everybody okay I am blocking the two beasts to give you time to eat the book when your strength is big enough then I will release them I said go try again you need them you prayed but not this time this time don't play with the woman that woman is me the blood of this and time will never fail never fail they'll remove the message they kill a message Church the vatic can kill a message Church another message Church Papa spoken word Tabernacle when you kill another one come up when you kill another one come out everybody here everybody clear that through a church in Ohio another church came up the slower Church in North Carolina another church came up because we got the devil answer you can never touch this message this message is true this message will remain this message is Christ this message is not
