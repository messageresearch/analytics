[54:21] pride okay you need to get it out talk
[54:24] to yourself
[54:25] you you have a problem of this if you do
[54:29] that by the time I get to the baptism of
[54:31] the Holy Spirit
[54:33] you will be rolling on this floor

[55:33] very very rude to their wives
[55:36] brutal to the wife and everything

[55:59] tell him like that
[56:03] when you claim him up then you take him
[56:05] you say now we can get along together
[56:10] from now on make it make sure
[56:13] from this day forward from that time no
[56:16] more game
[56:17] I don't want to stay here in the
[56:19] tribulation because of you
[56:22] because you get me too much trouble
[56:25] when I want to go to church you the one
[56:27] that always come up with stuff
[56:36] that's fun
[56:39] this is not a church
[56:42] this is a homegoing Time
[56:45] you don't want to stay behind because
[56:48] the Holy Spirit doesn't tolerate longer
[56:51] he will be pleading pleading pleading
[56:54] pleading after a while that say he takes
[56:56] off
[56:59] and you will be fighting you will be you
[57:01] will be what fasting 40 days to find out
[57:05] Holy Ghost again

[1:14:45] Ephesians 5 verse 23.
[1:14:49] for the husband is the water
[1:14:53] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[1:14:56] of the water church so now Paul is using
[1:15:00] the natural man
[1:15:02] and the spiritual man
[1:15:04] everybody okay there has been the first
[1:15:08] husband that was the head of the wife
[1:15:10] was Adam
[1:15:13] When sin entered God changed the
[1:15:16] Covenant and he said your husband shall
[1:15:18] be shall rule over you everybody okay
[1:15:22] so Paul here is using the natural man
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:28] and the spiritual man
[1:15:32] he said in the natural man
[1:15:35] the man is the head
[1:15:38] of the wife
[1:15:40] everybody okay but spiritually speaking
[1:15:43] he says the head in the spiritual is
[1:15:47] Christ
[1:15:49] and the wife of Christ is who the church
[1:15:55] amen he said for the husband is the head
[1:15:59] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[1:16:01] of the what church and he is the savior
[1:16:04] of the water body the body is water
[1:16:08] this church is also called what the body
[1:16:11] if you need more scripture on that you
[1:16:13] see me it's in Colossians 1 18 and 23
[1:16:16] 424 if I'm not mistaken job to verse 28.
[1:16:21] everybody okay
[1:16:23] so ought to men to love the water wives
[1:16:26] as their own bodies do you understand
[1:16:29] that
[1:16:30] so the body of a Man Too is a wife
[1:16:36] am I reading a different Bible you know
[1:16:39] sometimes when you look at me I wonder
[1:16:41] if I'm reading a different Bible
[1:16:42] everybody okay so ought men to love
[1:16:45] their wife as their own body so that so
[1:16:49] he that loves his wife loves water
[1:16:52] himself
[1:16:53] oh so if you love your wife you are
[1:16:56] loving yourself what does it mean so
[1:16:59] when I love sister Sharon I'm loving
[1:17:02] myself what does he need
[1:17:10] if I treat her bad
[1:17:14] I'm treating myself how bad I wish I can

[1:17:24] when you are talking to your wife you
[1:17:26] don't talk to me like this
[1:17:28] you don't know who you're talking to
[1:17:30] that's why you're talking the way you
[1:17:32] talking because in your mind you're
[1:17:34] thinking you're talking to somebody else
[1:17:38] I wish I can have married people
[1:17:41] separate I lock that door and lock this
[1:17:44] door and handle them

[1:18:37] ever headed his own what but he does
[1:18:40] what nourishes it and do whatever you

[1:18:51] and that and that woman
[1:18:54] goes to Salvation Army
[1:18:59] let me leave it alone we handle the man
[1:19:01] with people later everybody okay even as
[1:19:05] the Lord the Water Church
[1:19:08] for we are members of his water body so
[1:19:12] this church have many members
[1:19:18] but all those members are
[1:19:20] we are members of men of his body
[1:19:24] of his flesh and of his water bones what
[1:19:28] does he remind you
[1:19:30] in other words we are flesh of his flesh
[1:19:33] and water bounds of his bones everybody
[1:19:35] okay where did you see that Genesis
[1:19:40] everybody okay now verse uh
[1:19:44] 31 for discourse shall man leave his
[1:19:49] water father and mother and shall join
[1:19:52] to his what wife and the two shall be
[1:19:54] watered one flesh why did Paul get this
[1:19:58] and he's applying that to who
[1:20:02] so if Adam
[1:20:04] was in Genesis this one his name must be
[1:20:06] also water
[1:20:09] everybody okay so we got two atoms there
[1:20:12] everybody okay
[1:20:13] verse 32 this is a water mysterious

[1:20:44] church is a big it's a great
[1:20:48] mystery

[1:20:57] So when you say Christ and the church
[1:21:00] it's a great mystery what is that
[1:21:03] misreading
[1:21:05] can you tell me
[1:21:09] can I remind you something
[1:21:11] amen and then we take off
[1:21:12] but uh the Bible says this that moreover

[1:21:19] Delight of the water son
[1:21:23] Moon

[1:21:28] but the light of this Moon must be equal
[1:21:31] to the light of the Sun in other words
[1:21:34] this moon was not equal to the Sun
[1:21:38] but at the certain level it will become
[1:21:41] equal
[1:21:44] and the light of the sun shall be how
[1:21:47] much Sevenfold So this sun if it's time

[1:23:15] it all unto their hand in the name of
[1:23:17] Jesus Christ amen everybody okay my
[1:23:21] subject this morning
[1:23:23] so it helped me with this computer
[1:23:27] my subject this morning
[1:23:29] is
[1:23:31] the four phases of roof the groom's
[1:23:34] Oiler
[1:23:37] Karma
[1:23:38] the mystery of man
[1:23:42] what is a man
[1:23:45] let me repeat it again my subject this
[1:23:48] morning is the groom's oil
[1:23:51] the mystery of what man what is a man
[1:23:59] foreign
[1:24:01] you've seen them walking all around
[1:24:03] you have them they call them your
[1:24:05] husband or somebody call them my father
[1:24:08] or my grandpa what is a man
[1:24:11] everybody okay
[1:24:12] we are back up on the surface in the
[1:24:15] trashing floor and we are dealing with
[1:24:17] the second oil and I'm gonna get into
[1:24:19] this oil in more detail Lord help me
[1:24:22] with this everybody okay
[1:24:24] as we're moving back to our Tabernacle
[1:24:27] we found out that we are in the holiest
[1:24:30] no more deeper we back up on the surface
[1:24:33] everybody okay now when we spoke about
[1:24:37] roof
[1:24:39] we found out that when roof was coming
[1:24:42] back into Bethlehem the scripture says
[1:24:46] this in Ruth chapter 1 verse 22 that so
[1:24:49] Naomi returned
[1:24:52] and roof the more about us her
[1:24:54] daughter-in-law with her which returned
[1:24:57] out of the country of Moab
[1:24:59] and the Bible said that they came to
[1:25:02] Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[1:25:05] water Harvest
[1:25:07] so when roof returned the Harvest was
[1:25:11] already on
[1:25:14] when we talk about Harvest
[1:25:16] we need to be careful how we applying
[1:25:19] the word Harvest
[1:25:21] the Bible said in the Book of Matthew
[1:25:23] chapter 9 that but when he saw Jesus
[1:25:27] demultited
[1:25:29] he was moved with compassion on them
[1:25:31] because they fainted and were scattered
[1:25:35] abroad as sheep having no Shepherd
[1:25:38] then say he unto his disciple the
[1:25:42] Harvest truly is water plentiful when
[1:25:45] Jesus was here Jesus already looked at
[1:25:50] the field in the Harvest
[1:25:54] but usually when we talk about the
[1:25:57] Harvest we're looking at the Harvest as
[1:25:59] the end time
[1:26:03] what is going on he said but the
[1:26:07] laborers are few
[1:26:09] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:26:11] Harvest that he would send forth labors
[1:26:14] into the water Harvest so when Jesus was
[1:26:17] here the Harvest was already on
[1:26:21] everybody okay
[1:26:22] John chapter 4 verse 35
[1:26:25] say ye not say not ye they are yet four
[1:26:29] months and then cometh what the Harvest
[1:26:32] behold I say unto you lift up your eyes
[1:26:36] and look on the water fields
[1:26:39] for they are white already to what
[1:26:42] Harvest roof went back in the beginning
[1:26:45] of what when the field were already
[1:26:48] White
[1:26:49] but it was not the time yet
[1:26:52] to pick up roof
[1:26:54] she had to go through a process
[1:26:56] everybody okay even though Jesus say
[1:26:59] that the field were already ripe that
[1:27:03] their Harvest so is ready that was not
[1:27:05] really the Harvest
[1:27:10] I'm going slowly
[1:27:12] in Matthew Chapter 13 in the parable
[1:27:15] verse 39 Jesus said the enemy that
[1:27:18] showed them is the devil the Harvest is
[1:27:21] water
[1:27:23] so we got to harvest
[1:27:28] anybody okay we got the Harvest
[1:27:31] that Jesus stated I was already ripe he
[1:27:35] just need the leverage to go and we got
[1:27:38] there Harvest of the Harvest
[1:27:42] everybody okay we got the Harvest off
[1:27:46] the Harvest
[1:27:48] everybody okay this is a harvest
[1:27:52] but this is the Harvest of the Harvest
[1:27:55] in other words it is the end of the
[1:27:58] Harvest
[1:27:59] so there is a beginning of Jarvis
[1:28:04] and the ending of water
[1:28:08] let's go to first John
[1:28:12] chapter 2. keep Matthew 20
[1:28:16] 5.
[1:28:21] glory to God
[1:28:23] first John chapter 2 verse 28. how many
[1:28:28] believe we are in the last day
[1:28:30] let me see your hand
[1:28:32] how many believe we are on the last
[1:28:34] Church age
[1:28:35] how many believe we are allowed
[1:28:39] so the last day is us but let's read
[1:28:42] this
[1:28:44] first John chapter 2 verse 28 if you
[1:28:47] dare you can say Amen
[1:28:51] at Verse 18 I'm sorry first John chapter
[1:28:54] 2 verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen
[1:28:58] who's talking here what is the name of
[1:29:00] the disciple
[1:29:01] is John somebody who is in this time no
[1:29:04] John was one of the Disciples of Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ
[1:29:07] everybody okay he was the last one that
[1:29:10] remained and wrote the Book of
[1:29:11] Revelation is John alive today
[1:29:14] let's see what John's saying at that
[1:29:17] time
[1:29:18] this is what John is saying if you work
[1:29:21] last night or something Shake Yourself
[1:29:23] okay you can be the only one doing this
[1:29:26] everybody okay Verse 18 leader children
[1:29:30] if not I will hand you the microphone
[1:29:32] too
[1:29:33] I'm not my brother here but I'm saying
[1:29:35] to keep you alive everybody okay little
[1:29:39] children
[1:29:40] it is the water last time stop was the
[1:29:44] last time over there
[1:29:48] are you okay yes sir it is the last time
[1:29:51] and as you have heard the Antichrist
[1:29:54] shall come even now
[1:29:58] are there many water Antichrist whereby
[1:30:01] we know that it is the water so at that
[1:30:04] time John called the time of the gentle
[1:30:08] the last time
[1:30:11] so there is a last time and the last
[1:30:14] time of the last time
[1:30:18] everybody okay because remember that
[1:30:21] there were 70 weeks
[1:30:25] for those that were yesterday that were
[1:30:27] determined for the Jewish everybody okay
[1:30:30] every single week was already fulfilled
[1:30:34] there was only one week that was
[1:30:36] remaining
[1:30:37] everybody okay so when that week was
[1:30:40] coming out that was the last time
[1:30:46] everybody okay everybody okay and he
[1:30:49] only takes seven years but for some
[1:30:52] reason in the middle of the week which
[1:30:54] is three and a half year you remember
[1:30:56] yesterday God pushed the break
[1:30:59] because the world could have ended there
[1:31:03] everybody okay remember yesterday God
[1:31:05] pushed the break right there and opened
[1:31:08] the gentle dispensation so the gentle
[1:31:11] dispossession started at the end of the
[1:31:15] Jewish dispensation
[1:31:18] that's why you need to come
[1:31:21] everybody okay everybody okay the end of
[1:31:25] the Jewish dispensation was there when
[1:31:27] Jesus Christ came that's why brother
[1:31:30] Branham say Israel have seven churches
[1:31:33] just as the nation have seven churches
[1:31:36] when Jesus Christ came Jesus came at the
[1:31:39] last age of the Jewish dispensation
[1:31:42] everything should have been closed
[1:31:46] and Armageddon should have taken place
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:51] everybody okay so when they begin to
[1:31:54] consume the last week of Daniel at three
[1:31:58] and a half year which is the midst of
[1:32:00] the week everything stopped
[1:32:03] because there is a roof
[1:32:06] that is not picked up yet
[1:32:08] everybody okay it was the last time he
[1:32:12] was the Harvest the field was already
[1:32:15] ripe but it was not the end timer
[1:32:20] everybody okay you remember yesterday so
[1:32:24] God begin to work with the Jew with the
[1:32:27] Gentile until the LA odisha which is the
[1:32:30] end time of the Gentile
[1:32:33] did I lost anybody
[1:32:36] praise God everybody okay and the Bible
[1:32:39] said that the reapers are The Water
[1:32:41] Angels and we found out that when roof
[1:32:44] came roof began to label and she was
[1:32:47] Levering under the reaper which are the
[1:32:50] Angels and we know that throughout the
[1:32:53] seven Church ages we have seven angels
[1:32:55] which are seven weepers and Ruth was
[1:32:58] picking up two food
[1:33:02] everybody okay there was a food that
[1:33:05] roof have to work for yes herself
[1:33:07] everybody okay and pick the food for
[1:33:10] herself and there was another food that
[1:33:13] was given by the Reapers yes
[1:33:17] everybody okay so there is a
[1:33:19] responsibility that you have
[1:33:22] brother Branham said she was gleaning
[1:33:23] from the Old Testament and the New
[1:33:25] Testament
[1:33:26] anybody here you must clean your own
[1:33:28] food and there must be a Reaper to give
[1:33:31] you a food that was intended by Boaz to
[1:33:35] give you a certain message
[1:33:38] did I lost anybody Paul was already have
[1:33:42] an intent for roof but he could not
[1:33:45] speak to roof about that intent because
[1:33:48] it was the beginning of harvest
[1:33:51] everybody okay but he have to use the
[1:33:54] Reapers
[1:33:55] everybody okay so that intentionally
[1:33:58] when roof is picking up the food the
[1:34:01] reaper will pick up something and throw
[1:34:03] it in intention what the reaper was
[1:34:06] giving it was not the food of the Reaper
[1:34:12] everybody okay he was there food of
[1:34:15] powers they failed to belonged to Boaz
[1:34:18] the food belongs to Bowen but Boaz uses
[1:34:22] a Reaper an angel to deliver a specific
[1:34:26] food for a specific period of time so
[1:34:30] every day there is a specific food
[1:34:34] everybody okay there was a food that had
[1:34:36] to come from the Reapers every single
[1:34:39] church is there was a message amen
[1:34:43] and that message have to come from a
[1:34:45] Reaper which is the Angel of the edge
[1:34:48] so as you come to FSS you must meet the
[1:34:52] reaper of the day and the reaper of the
[1:34:55] day will give you the food of the day
[1:34:57] and the food of the day is what you take
[1:35:00] to eat for that day and then tomorrow
[1:35:03] you need another food
[1:35:07] everybody okay
[1:35:09] everybody okay so as she was laboring
[1:35:12] picking up the two food she bring it
[1:35:14] home and then she was the one bringing
[1:35:17] food at home and keeping the home active
[1:35:19] everybody okay now this happened in the
[1:35:23] field of Boaz under the candlestick
[1:35:26] you remember under the seven messenger
[1:35:29] but there was a time where this
[1:35:32] dispensation
[1:35:35] everybody okay now we need to move from
[1:35:38] this dispensation from the field of Boaz
[1:35:42] we go now into another place and that
[1:35:46] place now is called the threshing floor
[1:35:51] everybody okay God help me with this
[1:35:53] computer everybody okay now when this
[1:35:56] this first session finish Naomi tell the
[1:35:59] roof he said wait a minute this
[1:36:01] dispensation is over yes yes now you

[1:36:12] everybody okay when she moved from the
[1:36:15] field
[1:36:16] into the threshing floor in the tracing
[1:36:19] floor the one doing the work his powers
[1:36:24] everybody okay when you enter the
[1:36:26] dressing floor the work is not your work
[1:36:30] anymore
[1:36:32] everybody okay brother Branham says this
[1:36:35] oh God he said we see the Great Harvest

[1:36:52] water sharks from water around us let us
[1:36:56] lay in the presence of the water son
[1:36:59] that's why roof when she entered there
[1:37:01] all she did was God to sleep in the
[1:37:04] presence of who
[1:37:06] borrowers everybody okay these next few
[1:37:09] days and what happened to the Water
[1:37:11] Kingdom of God why is the rest connected
[1:37:16] to a man
[1:37:20] let's go to Genesis
[1:37:23] let's go to Genesis chapter 1.
[1:37:28] give me a minute this thing is acting up
[1:37:31] everybody okay why is rest connected to
[1:37:35] men
[1:37:36] let me remind you this quickly as we go
[1:37:39] in there the Bible says in reverend in
[1:37:41] Matthew 25 that then shall the Kingdom
[1:37:45] of Heaven be like unto ten virgin which
[1:37:48] took their lamp and went forth to meet
[1:37:51] water bridegroom
[1:37:54] let me tell you this
[1:37:58] can I erase this you know what it means
[1:38:00] we are in the great mystery now we got
[1:38:03] Ted virgins
[1:38:05] we got five of them that are wise
[1:38:09] and five of them that are what
[1:38:11] polish
[1:38:13] go to Matthew 25 first
[1:38:16] and then let's climb right there
[1:38:18] we got five virgin
[1:38:20] that are wise
[1:38:22] and five virgin
[1:38:24] that are foolish
[1:38:26] everybody okay
[1:38:27] the Bible says that the 10th virgin
[1:38:30] which took the lamp and went forth to
[1:38:33] meet who the blood group
[1:38:36] all this virgin if you remember they
[1:38:39] were his spouse
[1:38:41] oh they were fiance
[1:38:44] or they were engaged
[1:38:47] amen and engagement in the Bible means
[1:38:51] that it's already marriage
[1:38:55] you know that because the Bible said
[1:38:58] Joseph was engaged to Mary and when God
[1:39:00] said go get married that wife everybody
[1:39:03] here in other words every virgin here
[1:39:06] potentially already was a wife
[1:39:11] everybody okay and this virgin pick up
[1:39:15] lamps
[1:39:16] I'm going slowly those lamps had the oil
[1:39:22] everybody okay and that oil was already
[1:39:26] in use
[1:39:28] and the oil was burning
[1:39:31] everybody okay
[1:39:33] now let's go to Matthew 25.
[1:39:36] if you dare you can say man amen go to
[1:39:38] verse two
[1:39:39] and five of them were wise
[1:39:43] and five were what foolish
[1:39:46] day that were foolish
[1:39:48] took the lamp
[1:39:51] everybody okay
[1:39:52] and took no oil with water then
[1:39:55] so the characteristic of a foolish
[1:39:59] virgin
[1:40:00] everybody okay is somebody that have oil
[1:40:03] in the lamp
[1:40:05] everybody okay but did not take the
[1:40:08] backup oil
[1:40:13] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:40:17] so right here we got two oil
[1:40:20] that's right man hey everybody okay we
[1:40:23] got the first oil
[1:40:26] which was in the lamp
[1:40:29] everybody okay and we got the second oil
[1:40:32] which was the Bible says in the vessel
[1:40:36] everybody okay
[1:40:38] the first oil was already burning
[1:40:42] oh it was already in use
[1:40:45] everybody okay and the second one was
[1:40:49] not in use
[1:40:51] he was annoying of Reserve
[1:40:55] he was an oil of backup
[1:41:00] he was an all that was not manifested
[1:41:04] yet
[1:41:06] everybody okay so as the wise virgin
[1:41:09] were journeying
[1:41:11] They Carried that oil
[1:41:14] but you would not know that they have it
[1:41:19] everybody okay so far everybody good so
[1:41:22] far now let me tell you that are you
[1:41:25] following me the fish oil
[1:41:29] and the second oil are not different in
[1:41:33] texture
[1:41:37] everybody okay
[1:41:38] in composition
[1:41:41] you following me when you look at the
[1:41:43] fish oil and you look at the second oil
[1:41:46] buff of they all look the same
[1:41:51] but there are different toilets
[1:41:55] everybody okay
[1:41:57] if they give you the first oil and they
[1:42:00] give you the second oil both of them are
[1:42:03] the same
[1:42:05] what makes those oil different
[1:42:10] what makes the oil different is not the
[1:42:14] composition
[1:42:16] it is the ministry of the oil
[1:42:22] are you following me
[1:42:24] the ministries of the oil or the job of
[1:42:29] the oil or determine
[1:42:32] of the oil is what makes a difference
[1:42:36] between the fish oil and the second oil
[1:42:41] everybody okay so far everybody good so
[1:42:44] far now we found out that the foolish
[1:42:47] virgin when they were picking up the
[1:42:50] lamp
[1:42:51] they did not take the second oil
[1:42:55] everybody okay but the wife's virgin
[1:42:58] when they pick up the lamp they picked
[1:43:01] the second hole in other words The Vow
[1:43:03] the white virgin picked two of you
[1:43:10] the wise virgin have the first and the
[1:43:13] second oil
[1:43:14] everybody okay but the foolish virgin
[1:43:17] has only the first oil everybody okay
[1:43:20] the Bible says in verse 3 that they they
[1:43:24] were foolish took their land
[1:43:27] and took no oil with them
[1:43:33] everybody okay the foolish virgin you
[1:43:36] following me
[1:43:38] didn't see
[1:43:40] the importance
[1:43:43] of the second oil
[1:43:47] I hope you are getting what I'm going I
[1:43:50] told you I'm going slowly
[1:43:53] everybody clear so the second all you
[1:43:56] will stay
[1:43:57] but when the foolish look at all they
[1:44:00] say we don't need this oil
[1:44:03] we don't see the use of the Soul
[1:44:08] do you follow me it is an all that to
[1:44:12] them was not useful
[1:44:15] it was not necessary
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:23] as long as they have the festival that's
[1:44:27] all they need to make it to the bathroom
[1:44:35] I am not talking about denomination
[1:44:39] denomination I already finished
[1:44:42] I am talking about the people in the
[1:44:45] message
[1:44:48] everybody clear
[1:44:49] hey everybody here one day they were
[1:44:52] building the Temple
[1:44:55] everybody here and they were bringing
[1:44:58] Stone and the Builder were picking up
[1:45:00] the stone and put it there pick up the
[1:45:03] stone and put it there pick up the stone
[1:45:05] and put it in pick up the stone and put
[1:45:08] it there and the building was moving and
[1:45:09] the building was moving and finally they
[1:45:12] brought another Stone
[1:45:14] everybody clear when they built they
[1:45:16] look at the stone
[1:45:18] they say what kind of stone is this
[1:45:21] do you follow me they said this stone
[1:45:23] look bizarre
[1:45:25] it's a Nordstrom we don't see where it's
[1:45:28] going to fit take that stone cast it
[1:45:31] away
[1:45:32] and Jesus said the stone that debut that
[1:45:35] rejected the storm that the foolish
[1:45:39] virgin
[1:45:41] do you follow me rejected that was the
[1:45:45] cheese Cornerstone
[1:45:48] everybody okay when they continue to
[1:45:51] build the building they found that
[1:45:54] there's a certain age something was not
[1:45:57] working right
[1:46:01] everybody okay
[1:46:02] something is not working right with this
[1:46:05] message
[1:46:06] some of the people begin to leave the
[1:46:09] message some of the preacher begin to
[1:46:11] leave the message something is
[1:46:15] the problem is the Builder
[1:46:18] the problem is the preacher

[1:46:24] rejected the heads down
[1:46:28] they rejected the Cornerstone
[1:46:32] that thought he was not necessary
[1:46:35] they thought we don't need those stuff
[1:46:38] what we have is an answer
[1:46:43] a foolish virgin is the one that despise
[1:46:48] the second oil
[1:46:54] that's why you heal we don't need those
[1:46:57] stuff
[1:47:01] do we need this to be saved

[1:47:14] Daniel all this Revelation so that we
[1:47:18] can go to the Rapture it is a foolish

[1:56:07] when God say let MC man he was only one
[1:56:12] man
[1:56:13] I'm going slowly
[1:56:15] then God changed terminology he said
[1:56:20] this one man let them
[1:56:24] now man move from singular
[1:56:29] into a plural
[1:56:32] into exam
[1:56:35] who is them
[1:56:38] the Bible says this
[1:56:40] let them have dominion offer the fish of
[1:56:44] the sea thank you my brother offer the
[1:56:46] father let me see if it's
[1:56:51] still battling
[1:56:54] maybe you need to put it up again okay
[1:56:58] no it's not responding okay he did
[1:57:03] okay we'll figure it out he said let
[1:57:05] them so somebody maybe need to stay
[1:57:07] right there and work with me he said and
[1:57:10] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:57:12] the Sea of the fall of the year and over
[1:57:15] the cuddle and over all the Earth and
[1:57:18] over every creeping things that creepeth
[1:57:20] upon the Earth
[1:57:22] so God created man everybody look at
[1:57:25] that singular
[1:57:27] in his own what image and in the image
[1:57:31] of who God in the image of God created
[1:57:34] him how and what a female created water
[1:57:43] are we okay so when God created man
[1:57:51] demand that God created was double
[1:57:56] I'm going slowly
[1:57:58] God created a door
[1:58:02] or a double man
[1:58:05] and that double man was male
[1:58:11] and female
[1:58:15] everybody okay
[1:58:17] jump to verse 28. and God blessed them
[1:58:22] and God said to them
[1:58:25] be fruitful
[1:58:27] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:58:30] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:58:33] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[1:58:35] air and of every living thing that moves
[1:58:38] upon the Water Earth so when God created
[1:58:42] man God created man in his own image and
[1:58:48] in his own likeness when man came out
[1:58:53] man was one unit
[1:58:56] everybody okay
[1:58:58] and in that one unit
[1:59:00] everybody care he was a double
[1:59:04] there was a male and a female
[1:59:08] if God created man in his own
[1:59:13] everybody okay and he's on water
[1:59:16] likeness and if that man is male and
[1:59:21] female how is that God male and female
[1:59:28] are you having are you scared to say a
[1:59:30] man
[1:59:35] God is how and water female
[1:59:41] am I reading a different Bible
[1:59:44] God is mayor
[1:59:47] and water female
[1:59:51] everybody okay let's go to Genesis 5.
[1:59:55] I told you it's a different language
[1:59:58] but it's in the scripture everybody okay
[2:00:01] glory to God
[2:00:03] go ahead and click brother Robert
[2:00:06] Amen brother Branham says this the in
[2:00:10] the beginning there were water one God
[2:00:13] when he met man he made him a water dual
[2:00:16] person
[2:00:18] and whatever
[2:00:20] the message and the scripture are
[2:00:22] perfectly in line we prove it to you all
[2:00:25] the time he separated him in water flesh
[2:00:28] and put him here on Earth in flesh and
[2:00:31] the female part was still in the water
[2:00:33] spirit let's push the break there let's
[2:00:35] go to Genesis father
[2:00:37] this man is double
[2:00:40] his name this man is female and male
[2:00:43] just like God is female and male but
[2:00:46] this man must have a name
[2:00:50] we need to know his name
[2:00:53] amen but when the name come
[2:00:57] the name is the name of the man
[2:01:00] not your way of naming the man
[2:01:05] let's say let's use God language forget
[2:01:08] about your intellectual and your
[2:01:10] language let's say what the word say
[2:01:12] okay let's go to Genesis 5. if you're
[2:01:16] there you can say amen amen first one
[2:01:18] this is the book of the generation of
[2:01:20] who
[2:01:22] where did that name come from let's
[2:01:24] continue in the day that God created who
[2:01:27] man in his water likeness of God made he
[2:01:31] what him
[2:01:33] made He Who
[2:01:35] so the man was a hymn
[2:01:38] are you okay this man this double man
[2:01:42] here is him
[2:01:45] did the Bible say to her
[2:01:47] so God also is a what
[2:01:54] everybody okay everybody okay verse 2.
[2:01:58] verse two my brother you ready male and
[2:02:02] female created he what them and he did
[2:02:06] what bless them and call Dad
[2:02:12] are you watching your Bible
[2:02:14] Adam
[2:02:20] he called them water
[2:02:23] so what is the name of this mail Adam
[2:02:25] what is the name of this female Adam
[2:02:29] so if you step right there you say Adam
[2:02:32] how many people do you expect to come to
[2:02:39] everybody okay everybody okay so these
[2:02:43] two beings here are called Adam
[2:02:46] I mean who knows the name of God
[2:02:51] you have a problem saying that who knows
[2:02:54] the name of God Jesus
[2:02:56] and Jesus is how well female so if the
[2:03:02] man his name is Jesus what is the name
[2:03:05] of the woman Jesus
[2:03:12] is he complicated
[2:03:16] let's go to Malachi
[2:03:22] Malachi chapter 2 I don't know what to
[2:03:25] do with time
[2:03:26] father help me
[2:03:33] let's go to the Book of Malachi
[2:03:36] brother Robert you can click
[2:03:39] click again
[2:03:41] glory to God
[2:03:43] later let's go to Malachi chapter two if
[2:03:46] you dare you can say amen amen you there
[2:03:49] you there
[2:03:51] jump to verse 14.
[2:03:55] yet you say wherefore
[2:03:58] in other words why
[2:04:00] because
[2:04:02] the Lord has been witness between who
[2:04:06] you and the hope your wife
[2:04:09] the wife of your youth against whom you
[2:04:13] have dealt how cautiously yet she is
[2:04:16] your water companion and the wife of
[2:04:18] your water Covenant let me leave that
[2:04:20] alone for married people and did not he
[2:04:23] make what one
[2:04:25] God never make two
[2:04:30] am I reading a different Bible no he
[2:04:32] made what one
[2:04:34] did he not make one
[2:04:36] yet had hit the water residue of the
[2:04:40] water spirit in other word when God
[2:04:44] makes man
[2:04:46] amen God still existed
[2:04:50] are you following me when God created
[2:04:53] Adam
[2:04:54] God will still existed but Adam came out
[2:04:57] of God
[2:04:58] you following me
[2:04:59] keep that in mind
[2:05:02] verse 15 and wait for one
[2:05:06] that he must seek a good receipt
[2:05:08] therefore take heed to your spirit and
[2:05:12] let none dealt treacherously against the
[2:05:16] water of Water thy use of that youth
[2:05:19] amen for the Lord God of Israel says
[2:05:23] that he hates what
[2:05:25] putting away means what course so
[2:05:29] let me continue divorce him for one
[2:05:32] covers violence with his government say
[2:05:35] the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to
[2:05:37] your spirit that you dealt you deal not
[2:05:40] water preciously God is talking through
[2:05:42] Malachi he said I notice that some of
[2:05:46] you men are committing adultery
[2:05:49] and because you're committing adultery
[2:05:51] you are breaking the Covenant with the
[2:05:53] woman I want to remind you that in the
[2:05:56] beginning God created one
[2:06:00] everybody okay and God hate what divorce
[2:06:04] putting away
[2:06:06] everybody okay
[2:06:08] now
[2:06:09] if you notice you are here in the
[2:06:12] beginning God created one man
[2:06:15] you following me but that one man when
[2:06:19] you look at him he is male and what the
[2:06:23] female in Genesis 2
[2:06:26] you following me verse 7. God decided to
[2:06:32] create a body
[2:06:34] amen and to take the man and put him in
[2:06:38] the body
[2:06:39] amen how many men did he create in Jesus
[2:06:43] is one one how many body is God supposed
[2:06:47] to create
[2:06:50] you afraid
[2:06:55] let me go slowly again
[2:06:57] your problem is you here leave this
[2:07:00] alone
[2:07:00] okay leave this alone let's go back here
[2:07:03] that's why I say I'm gonna go slow
[2:07:05] because it's hard for you to earn to to
[2:07:08] get it but you're gonna get it
[2:07:11] how many men God created one
[2:07:14] singular amen let's remain here if God
[2:07:18] need to take this man and put him in the
[2:07:21] body how many body does God need one
[2:07:26] everybody okay so when God took Adam
[2:07:30] you follow me and put Adam in the body
[2:07:34] amen if God wants to make Eve
[2:07:42] where is God gonna pull Ephraim from
[2:07:45] Adam
[2:07:47] from where Adam
[2:07:49] why
[2:07:52] everybody okay everybody okay that's the
[2:07:55] reason why when it was time to creative
[2:07:59] God was under obligation
[2:08:04] because if God created Eve separately
[2:08:08] it's gonna be contrary
[2:08:10] to the original picture
[2:08:16] do you follow me amen it cannot come
[2:08:19] from another place
[2:08:20] because Adam was a package
[2:08:24] everybody okay
[2:08:25] God never created Adam and Eve that was
[2:08:30] wrong he created Adam
[2:08:32] but he said Adam there was Adam and Eve
[2:08:36] so when creating well so when God
[2:08:39] created the body of Adam he's going to
[2:08:42] create
[2:08:43] but inside the body
[2:08:47] come on everybody okay he must react if
[2:08:52] and who that's why there are guns of
[2:08:55] thoughts
[2:08:58] and flesh of Flesh
[2:09:01] and the two shall be one because at the
[2:09:05] beginning they were one
[2:09:11] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:09:14] so when we look at man
[2:09:17] from his creation maybe stop
[2:09:21] many steward
[2:09:24] men
[2:09:30] was male and female
[2:09:33] everybody okay and God called The Man
[2:09:37] both of them Adam
[2:09:40] okay this is why
[2:09:45] I hope you're not sleeping
[2:09:46] this is why
[2:09:51] this is why
[2:10:03] almost some of a man
[2:10:06] our double
[2:10:10] this is why man in his body
[2:10:14] his ex and why
[2:10:25] everybody okay everybody okay every man
[2:10:29] in his body is at
[2:10:32] and why
[2:10:34] reflecting their original amen
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:44] did I lost anyone
[2:10:47] did I lost anyone
[2:10:53] so
[2:10:54] when God comes
[2:10:56] everybody okay
[2:11:00] check somebody's
[2:11:03] wake somebody up there
[2:11:06] I don't want to question later on
[2:11:08] because you're sleeping
[2:11:16] I don't want a question later on
[2:11:18] everybody okay everybody okay so when
[2:11:22] God put Adam
[2:11:24] into the body
[2:11:26] he looked he said
[2:11:28] he began to create two two two two two
[2:11:31] two two God got excited
[2:11:36] he said oh everything is two everything
[2:11:39] is two everything is two but Adam is one
[2:11:42] he said no no it's not good
[2:11:47] I need to create what a help made for
[2:11:50] who Adam
[2:11:52] the Holy Spirit demanded him
[2:11:55] he said be careful
[2:11:57] don't be quick to create like this
[2:11:59] remember this boy when you created him
[2:12:02] he came double
[2:12:04] so when you want to create
[2:12:07] his mate
[2:12:09] you need to make sure where you're
[2:12:10] pulling that mate out
[2:12:14] everybody okay
[2:12:15] but
[2:12:17] man and woman when they were created
[2:12:20] like this
[2:12:22] men and women were equal
[2:12:34] why did she do such a thing being in the
[2:12:38] water I ordered so this order is a
[2:12:42] higher order of men
[2:12:47] because this order was a in the image
[2:12:51] and the water likeness disorder was the
[2:12:54] order of God
[2:13:00] he says she was right with man how
[2:13:04] co-equal with him but oh no now that she
[2:13:08] lost her water co-equalness with man
[2:13:10] when she did what sin and God said man
[2:13:13] will be a water ruler but at the
[2:13:16] beginning she was what co-equal
[2:13:22] I will get to that later on but let me
[2:13:25] get where I'm trying to go everybody
[2:13:27] okay when man God came to me he said I
[2:13:31] need to create a woman God took the man
[2:13:34] put him to sleep give him anesthesia
[2:13:37] general anesthesia he opened the surgery
[2:13:40] and God pulled the woman
[2:13:43] everybody okay
[2:13:44] and then he pulled the woman out
[2:13:46] and created the woman everybody okay
[2:13:49] when God finished to create the woman as
[2:13:53] God put Adam
[2:13:54] Adam in his body
[2:13:57] was X
[2:14:00] and why
[2:14:03] you following me God entered this party
[2:14:06] and picked the wire the X
[2:14:10] and pulled the eggs out
[2:14:13] everybody okay and created a woman
[2:14:17] that's why the gene of a woman are
[2:14:21] always EX
[2:14:23] you don't see a y in a woman
[2:14:30] everybody okay
[2:14:32] in other words man is 50 percent
[2:14:39] woman and 50 percent
[2:14:43] a woman is 100 woman
[2:14:58] everybody okay everybody okay if you
[2:15:02] have the woman
[2:15:04] if you have the female
[2:15:08] everybody okay
[2:15:10] you are missing the mail
[2:15:17] but if
[2:15:19] that is female
[2:15:21] amen you have the woman and the male
[2:15:25] together
[2:15:26] the one who determined a child in the
[2:15:30] pregnancy is not the woman
[2:15:37] the man
[2:15:39] how many knows this
[2:15:46] how many have seen this
[2:15:50] it's in your Bible
[2:15:53] x and x give water 2x it's water a girl
[2:15:58] X and Y give what x y x and x give what
[2:16:02] two x X and Y give what x y X Y you only
[2:16:06] have two possibilities either you're
[2:16:09] going to have a boy or you're going to
[2:16:10] have that girl the one who determined
[2:16:14] is not the woman it is the man who
[2:16:18] determined the sex of a child
[2:16:25] everybody okay everybody Okay click the
[2:16:28] brother of it
[2:16:33] everybody okay
[2:16:34] everybody okay glory to God now brother
[2:16:37] Branham said God in the beginning
[2:16:41] when he know men and women was made one
[2:16:44] not
[2:16:49] wanting flesh and one in one
[2:16:54] you know everybody okay he knew that so
[2:16:58] in order to prove that to you when God
[2:17:01] the woman he never took some dust
[2:17:04] and met her like he did man he took a
[2:17:09] water wave out of the sad of Adam and
[2:17:12] she became a water by product man
[2:20:42] foreign
[2:20:57] let me jump here for the sake of time
[2:20:59] look for when he was first made he was
[2:21:02] made water two people
[2:21:04] together he was made water both men and
[2:21:07] female the man was the Bible said she
[2:21:10] was God made both male and female
[2:21:13] created he him notice when man was
[2:21:17] separated from that from the theophany
[2:21:19] and put in flesh he was not just all
[2:21:22] together there part of his being was
[2:21:25] still in water so he didn't look what
[2:21:28] right the Bible says that man was
[2:21:32] created in the water image of who God
[2:21:36] what is the image of God
[2:21:39] let's go to Second Corinthians chapter
[2:21:41] four
[2:21:50] women Pi product by product
[2:21:54] you need to know what you're talking
[2:21:56] about
[2:21:57] say woman body was a biproduct
[2:22:00] not your wife's spirit
[2:22:06] by putting women by product that's why
[2:22:10] you treated her the way you treat it
[2:22:14] because in your mind by product in the
[2:22:17] kitchen in the kitchen
[2:22:25] and you see the sisters in the message
[2:22:27] they like this
[2:22:37] amen

[2:22:43] amen let's go to Second Corinthians
[2:22:46] chapter four

[2:23:52] the image of God is who Christ but we
[2:23:57] seen that Christ is buff water male and
[2:24:00] water female
[2:24:05] socrust is a female
[2:24:10] some are saying this some are saying
[2:24:12] this
[2:24:13] let's go to proverb I know it's a
[2:24:16] different language
[2:24:21] God In the Garden of Eden third man you
[2:24:26] can eat everything
[2:24:27] you remember
[2:24:30] you can eat of every tree except one
[2:24:33] tree which is the tree of the knowledge
[2:24:35] of what
[2:24:36] but in the midst of the garden there
[2:24:39] were two trees one of them was who
[2:24:42] the tree of life and we found out that
[2:24:45] the tree of life was who
[2:24:47] the tree of life was crushed he was the
[2:24:50] Tree of Life
[2:24:52] amen the Tree of Life Is Christ
[2:24:56] but Christ is how
[2:24:59] please can you can you tell me something
[2:25:04] request is man and what female so
[2:25:11] let's go to profitable
[2:25:13] let's go to proverb 3.
[2:25:15] it's hard brother Stephen I'm trying to
[2:25:17] see where you're going with this
[2:25:20] let's go to the proverb 3 verse 13. you
[2:25:24] dare you can say amen amen
[2:25:26] the Bible say happy is the man that
[2:25:30] found water wisdom you know the wisdom
[2:25:32] of God is who Christ and the men that
[2:25:35] gets water understanding for the
[2:25:37] merchandise of it of wisdom is better
[2:25:41] than the merchandise of the merchandise
[2:25:44] of silver and again they're off then
[2:25:48] find gold amen we know wisdom is Christ
[2:25:51] because the Bible say Christ the word
[2:25:53] the wisdom of God everybody okay now on
[2:25:57] verse 15 the Bible say he is more
[2:26:00] precious
[2:26:02] what did he say she oh
[2:26:06] the wisdom is a woman
[2:26:10] that's what he said
[2:26:12] okay let's go slowly you you want to say
[2:26:16] okay the Bible say Christ
[2:26:18] is the wisdom of God
[2:26:21] amen it's in First Corinthians 2 you can
[2:26:24] look at that but now we found out that

[2:56:30] strip himself
[2:56:32] of his glory
[2:56:35] to come down
[2:56:36] and to be identified with human being
[2:56:41] because he's Brad
[2:56:43] became human
[2:56:45] he could no longer remain divine
[2:56:49] he must come down
[2:56:51] and test
[2:56:53] and experience
[2:56:55] the same thing
[2:56:57] that his brother

[2:57:37] who they are
[2:57:40] you are showing them
[2:57:42] the reason why you died
[2:57:45] the reason why you accepted to be strip
[2:57:48] naked

[2:57:52] because
[2:57:54] you were looking for what belongs to you

[2:59:18] is a great mystery
[2:59:20] that's Satan hits
[2:59:22] and he knows why he hates it
