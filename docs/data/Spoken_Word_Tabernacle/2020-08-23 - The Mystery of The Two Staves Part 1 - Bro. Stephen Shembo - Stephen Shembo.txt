glorious day that will be foreign let's give him another clap often Hallelujah Hallelujah praise the Lord now you know I don't I didn't have anybody text me the last time I looked at my phone for uh any praise reports sorry or any uh prayer requests so I'm going to ask if anybody has one they'd like to bring up either one before we uh pray once again before the Lord anybody got anything I will say this we had a fellowship Friday night primarily for the Youth for some of the youth who had questions you know and we just kind of broke the ice really more than anything um and it it opened the door for some of us to um to try to understand and how our youth are thinking and you know we'll use that as a as a a God to pray in order to be able to relate more to our youth this message is a it's a big thing and a lot of them you know I'll tell you a statement that my son made and I and I hadn't really thought about it but you know you you go to one church and you're like man you need to come here this is it and then something happens if you move and you really need to come with us over here this is this is man this is good stuff and then something happens and he's like you know they get they got to mind of their own so you have to be able to understand how they're thinking as well and I didn't know what to say to him because we feel like we're following leadership of God and he's closing doors and opening others and you have to understand that and how it's everything's Progressive and you take steps to go higher and so I felt like Friday night was a great opportunity we enjoyed ourselves immensely we had a good time next time I want to bring some singing into it you know but it was primarily just to kind of you know kind of break the ice a little bit and we did have you know we did have some people speak up and we enjoyed it and um y'all forgive me because I talked a lot but you know I mean some moms have been around a little while we try to we gain an understanding of how things you know and we all want our kids to learn by our mistakes and a lot of times that just doesn't happen and I don't know if it's hard heads or soft behinds or what it is you know but uh so being such a big message we don't want to just go into it and leave our youth behind with questions especially so pray about it as a congregation that you know that we I mean they're here so they're hearing this and they're online and they're hearing this and and they may have a question brother Stephen has reiterated he did again Friday night open door open door open door ask a question if you have one don't be afraid you're going to be judged by asking the question because that's out of the picture our goal and I'm I know brother Stephen's heart he expressed it very um you know very specific Friday night that is to get our souls to God amen so does anybody have anything else they want to bring up or a prayer request anything uh I feel like I had one I don't recall yes ma'am yes a building yes um he'll he'll open the door when it's time I mean we're we're enjoying ourselves here but this is not it's not a sanctuary we don't know what went on in here last night or

this lady and she said the blood was Unreal just she came home and she started bawling because that's how she gets it out my son recommended that she'd go for a run and clear her mind he said whenever he Witnesses something like that on his job as a police officer that he goes and runs and it helps clear their mind these people see things at a young age that that really sometimes not ready for so

that just happened amen praise the Lord God bless you see inside brother John I'm a spare tire only if no one else was there saying I can just you know try to fill in but the Lord has been really good to us and we're we are glad you know it's just thinking about you know the characters and the scriptures how you know they live their lives and then there came a time when they realized the purpose for their lives then they're focused all the energy on that purpose and that's when they came into their Ministry and the prophet spoke about when the bride gets to know who she is and understanding the purpose for our lives and what we were born for it helps us to focus and put all the preeminence to that purpose amen that recognition is powerful this song has been in my heart try to share it

[Applause] praise the Lord can everybody hear me okay yeah it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we appreciate again the musician God richly relationship for everything you're doing for the kingdom of God yeah we praise the lord we have a wonderful time with the youth and that was an Open Door so I don't want to face Christ and say we were not given an opportunity to ask questions this is your time it's the time not only for the Youth but for everybody if you're struggling somewhere contact us let's sit let's talk let's go through the word let's go through the message let's talk about life anything in life because the message contain everything all the answers to your life it's in the message of the hour you say brother Stephen but what about if somebody just is lagging beyond Behind or something like that uh when Moses went to pharaoh Pharaoh gave him an opportunity he said you can go and leave this behind Moses say not even a hoof a hoof is not even a human being are you there it's like the shoe of a beast but Moses didn't want to live even a hoof if Moses care about the hoof of a beast how much more a human being that have the spirit and the Soul living into them so we're not going to leave nobody nobody behind everybody on praise the Lord let's go to Exodus chapter 25. I will ask you to remain alert and stay put because of what we're going to get into right like I told someone I say it's like a new marriage you got to get used together after a while it's gonna be your common natural food at the beginning it's like where is he going amen we are going in the message Exodus 25 verse 8. and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them God wanted Israel to make him a house a sanctuary where God is going to dwell in the midst of his people according to all that I show you after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments in other words Furniture thereof even so shall you make it you might be seated in other words God is talking to Israel here and God told Israel to make him a house but that house or that Tabernacle is not built any kind of way he had to be built according to a certain pattern so God gave Moses a pattern into the on the mountain he showed him what a tabernacle looked like and Moses have to reproduce or bring a replica of what he saw in heaven down in the Earth so you don't build God's house any kind of way you don't build God house by your intellect you don't build God's house by your preferences you don't build God's house by your feelings you build God's house according to the pattern and the pattern is the word of God everybody clear verse 10 and they shall make an ark so we're going to deal with the Ark of the Covenant they're going to make an arc of shitty mood acacia wood two cubits and a half shall be the left thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof in other words it's like a box everybody clear when you have a height and the breath and the length it's talking about the Box and you shall overlay it with pure gold it's made out of wood but that wood will be overlane by gold we know gold speaks about deity so there is a human being that's going to be there with the deity everybody clear and you shall overlay it with pure gold is sad and outside so deity is not going to be on the outside the word won't be only reflected outside in other words you don't only you are not holy only on the outside where you wear long dresses you don't put makeup that's good that's how sad DET have to be applied outside but deity also need to be applied inside and matter of fact you first start inside then it's gonna go outside so you must be overlay with God inside and outside if you are only of the lay outside you are living like a Pharisee You're Gonna Be Good to the eyes of the people but inside you are full of dead men's born you want to make sure you're inside and your outside is Overland by the character of God Hallelujah praise the Lord verse 11 and you shall overlay it with pure gold inside and outside shall you overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about and you shall cast four wings of gold so when you look at the ark it looks like a box but God told Israel or Moses he say after you finish the ark I want you to put four wings everybody clear four rings of Gold Everything Gold for it and put them in the four corners that's why I put it in the four corners in the four corners thereof and two Wings shall be in the one side of it and two ring in the other side of it in other words you have two rings here and you have two ring over there this is a box you are looking from the top and you shall make staves of shady mode God taught Israel that when you finish making the ark you're gonna put you're gonna make two steps and those days are like stuff or they are Road everybody following me you make two Stave but if you notice the stairs are made of City mode and the Ark of the Covenant was made of City mode in other words The Stave and the Ark were made of the same material are we clear praise the Lord and overlay them with gold so the composition of the Ark of the Covenant is exactly the composition of The Stave these states are on the same material same way stem pattern as the Ark of the Covenant everybody there verse 14. and you shall put the staff into the ring that's why I put The Stave there so this ring where for direction to put The Stave what for into the ring by the side of the ark that the ark may be born with them so to carry the Ark of the Covenant you need two staves and those two Stave must be of the same material just like the ark are we clear and the purpose was to Bear The Ark in other words you don't handle the ark right here you don't touch the ark you only handed the Ark by the stairs everybody clear if you want to move the Ark of the Covenant you don't push it like this if you touch it like uziah you're gonna find yourself dead when you wanna open when you wanna maneuver the Ark of the Covenant you are maneuver it by the staff it's like a woman that is cooking you don't put your hand into the fire inside the part where there is oil boiling but you use the spoon and with the spoon you are maneuvering the piece of steak that is in it are you there so if you want to move the Ark of the Covenant you handle the Ark of the Covenant by The Stave Allelujah verse 15 they still shall be in the rings of the Ark they shall not be taken from it in other words once they put the stairs in the earth it is forever are you there the ark and the staff become one piece you can never separate the Earth from the safe are you there if you are seeing The Stave you automatically know that the ark is there are you there even though you don't see the Ark of the Covenant but when you see The Stave automatically you know that the ark is connected with the staff because the staff were to never be separated with the Ark of the Covenant are you there but to move the oak you have to handle the Ark by The Stave everybody clear I'm going to skip some of them because of time let's go to Ezekiel chapter one praise the Lord but what I skipped was on top of the archery they made the matches it and they put it on top of the Ark you can read this at home and on top of that Ark Moses made two Caribbean of God and put him there the caribbeams were not made of City mode they were only made of gold and we preached to you before that would represent to what Humanity represent people but when they were making when they were making the Caribbeans they never made them with order are you there they were purely a different level of business of being are you there they work with human but they are not human let's go to Ezekiel chapter one I told you to stay up verse 3. the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest the son of boozy in the land of the Calvin's but the river keyboard and the Hand of the Lord was there upon him and I look and behold a what if not I want I'm gonna lose brother Kalima [Laughter] so the first thing a whirlwind some people call that sometimes devils a whirlwind you know Lucifer wanted to build a city on and off and the Jerusalem was also on the North so from there came a whirlwind are you there it was a great cloud and a fire unfolding itself in other words the fire was flashing first it looks like a cloud but this Cloud have Fire and Fire are flashing Ezekiel is watching this and a brightness was abandoned because there is fire you have a brightness around it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire so first you have a whirlwind then in the midst of that world when there is fire coming out and in the midst of the fire right in the middle of it there was a color of amber if you read a message long enough you know what it means the color of Amber is the color of the pillar of fire are you there it was right in the midst of it praise the Lord verse 5 and also also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of what for living creature we found out that when they made the Ark of the Covenant Moses put the Caribbean which are the living creature because Moses was reproducing what he saw in heaven now Ezekiel is now reproducing he's just giving a description of what he's saying of a vision but in that description the first thing he saw was what a color of amber remember John in the Book of Revelation when he went up and the door was open the first thing John saw was a man here sitting on the throne remember and then after that he began to see the forbest Ezekiel first saw the color of amber which is the pillar of fire and after that then came out what four living creatures I'm doing this to help you four living creatures and these was their appearance they had the likeness of her men they are not human but when you look at them they look like men in other words there is a connection between them and human but they are separate beings everybody there and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight fit because they look like men and the soul of their feet was like the soul of a calf foot oops that's why they are not human the living beings are you there and the sparkling like the color of burnished brass everybody there and they have the hands of a man under the wings of their four side in other words they have part human part animal mixed together everybody clear and they had four and they forehead their faces and their wings I'm gonna go verse nine their wings were John one to another they turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward remember when I spoke about uh Jericho when uh uh Joshua was telling Israel Joshua said when you attack you go straight you don't deviate right and left and these four beasts when they are moving they always move straight they never deviate to the left or to the right they always move straight I want you to keep that praise the Lord verse 10 I ask for the likeness of their faces they had they fall heard the face of a man you know what it means and the face of a lion you know what he means you already seen this so much on the right side Ezekiel is saying on the right side there is a lion remember how Israel was camping right remember on a lion and the four and day four had the face of phenox under on the left side remember how Israel was camping the ox was here and the lion was there and on the top was what an ego done and on the south was what man remember the clock right everybody clear all day four also had the face of El Amigo let's jump to verse uh 12. and they went everyone what straightforward but where are we they're going what are they following where the spirit was to go so the movement of the Caribbeans doesn't come from themselves are we there there's movement of the Caribbean comes from the direction of the spirit of God so when the pillar of fire moves to the right automatically the carry beams are moving to the right when the pillar of fire stop the Caribbean stop that's why Israel on their Journey when the pillar of fire stopped the stop when the pillar of fire rolls and begin to move they were moving because the tribes of Israel were under the anointing of the Caribbeans are we following they went verse 12 where the spirit was God was to go they went and they turned not when they went so no turning straight if it's left left straight right right straight whichever direction verse 13 as for the likeness of the living creature their appearance was like burning cause of fire they also look like fire I know this is Uncharted Territory but in this church from Genesis to revelation he went up and down among the living creature and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning brother Branham said that word means light in other words out of their Fire Light came out and we already know that light who had the color of what amber everybody clear now this is very important now first 14 and the living creature run and return as the appearance of a flash of lightning verse 15. now I beheld the living creature behold one what so these living creatures were full are you there one two three four they were moving as the spirit of the Lord moved so the anointing upon the Caribbeans were coming from the pillar of Fire but when they move they were moving with Will every single beasts have a will praise the Lord upon the Earth by the living creature with its four faces if you notice those will were connected to the Earth in other words the ark is moving but the ark is moving with the four living would be and every Beast has a will like a chariot right okay verse 16 the appearance of the wheels and their work was like the color of burial and day four had one likeness everyone have a will and the air appearance and their work was as they were a will in the middle of our we heard this so much today you're gonna see what it means are you there so we heard the wheel right here they were had Spokes and everything and the Caribbeans were right there riding with the wheel but when Ezekiel looked he saw that in the middle of the will there was another wheel all right verse 17 when they went they went upon their facade and they turned not when they went we already understand them Verse 18 ask for their ring the wings of the will are you there ask for their wings they were so high that they were Dreadful and their wings were full of what so the will of the Caribbeans has a ram and inside the ram they were eyes what kind of will is this huh if you go in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 the four Beast themselves Have Eyes on them you know that right so we don't have to go there and the wheels of the forbids also contain ice praise the Lord round about them the verse okay 19 and when the living creature went the will went by them in other words they will were following the Beast and the beasts were following the pillar of Fire you remember you understand that's why Paul said follow me as I follow Christ so when Paul moved to the right it is not power moving it is the pillar of fire moving and the church also has to move in the direction of the messenger because the anointing we're anointing the age everybody clear all right and when they live in creature will lift up from the earth the wheel will lift up so whatever happened to The Living wind they will are connected to them praise the Lord verse 20. yeah I'm gonna stop here then move to the other one wherever the spirit was to go they went who is they the wheels there was their Spirit to go and the will were lift up opposite them for their Spirit everybody is following me for the spirit of the living creature was in the are you following me the pillar of Fire that Spirit was in the Caribbeans and the spirit that was in the Caribbeans was in the will in other words the Caribbeans and the will were all under the anointing of God let's go to Ezekiel 10 then we're gonna pray Ezekiel 10 verse 1. I sleep a lot you can read Ezekiel one all the way at home and you're gonna see there is a throne on top of it because the mercy seat was the Throne of God and God was meeting Israel in between the Caribbeans right there everybody clear then I look and behold in the firmament that was above the head of what so those cherubims as they are moving with their will one here one day one day one day like a chariot on top of them they had a filament like a heaven in other words they were carrying something okay the cherubim there appear over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of Earth so on top of the carry beams were what a throne and when Moses made the Ark of the Covenant he put the Caribbeans and right there they were what the throne but the Ark of Moses didn't have wheels praise the Lord verse two and he spoke to the man clothed with linen and said go in between the wheels even under the Caribbeans the wheels were under and fill your hand with cause of fire that was the appearance of the Caribbeans from between the cherubims and Scattered them over the city judgment and he went in in my side now the Caribbean stood on the right side of the house when the men went in and the clouds filled the inner Court then the glory of the Lord went up from the have you seen that so the glory of the Lord was sinning when the Caribbean was that's why when Moses made the ark the glory of the Lord was moving and sitting where riding between the Caribbeans and when the glory is lift up something happened and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's Glory and the sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard even to the other court as the voice of who when he you see the anointing on the Caribbeans it was God all along Gods who fills everything all space-time and Eternity and he came to pass that when the head commanded the man clove with the line and saying take fire from between the quails from between the cherubims then he went in and Stood Beside the whales and one caribou stretch forth his hand you remember that one right the one who always give judgment you remember him last week right he was the lion when it comes to judgment it's the lion who reached forth and say take it and one carried stretch forth his hand between the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him the city everything cleared so far so we have the Ark of the Covenant forings with two steps to carry the ark the staff and the Ark made of the same material and the staff had to be never separated from the ark you cannot make a difference between the staff and the Ark you can never make The Stave deviate from the ark the staff is always connected to the Earth we get and then we found a whirlwind right here out of this Whirlwind came for living creature all of them were carrying another Throne another Ark and they have wheels with them and those whales have eyes and the Caribbean were following the pillar of fire and the whales were following the Caribbeans because the spirit of the pillar of fire was in the Caribbeans and the spirit of the Caribbeans was in the wheels everybody clear now now let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father we could be in denomination father eating all kinds of stuff Lord but you kept us safe and you brought us revealing yourself through the same time Lord in a particular way to draw the attention of your elect Lord father we are so grateful to that and we are committing this service unto the hand may you move me completely away Lord May the Holy Spirit the inside teacher may he comes and unfold the word teaches your word to your children Lord father May the heaven be open up forgive us for all iniquity all shortcoming everything that we did that might be a brokerage Lord father for our blessing this morning but Lord father may they open the heaven open up Lord May you look at us Lord through the blood of the Lamb may you come down lord father speak to your children as we commit everything unto their hand sealing the devil away from this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord where are you going brother Stephen praise the Lord can everybody say this you mind me okay that's okay brother Elijah can we move this puppy there so I can read it correctly praise the name of the Lord all right now brother Brian I'm saying here thank you my brother you are wanting to serve God he was talking to a lady under the discernment and brother Brandon Begin to discern that woman and he says that you are wanting to serve God in a different category so God can be served in category [Laughter] you might be in category one for a long term then God might have to shut you up because he's trying to bring you to another level are you there praise the Lord you are wanting to serve God in a different category than what you serve him into so this woman was serving God but this woman has a burning desire in her heart to move into the higher realm with God and brother Branham discerned that and he said that you are serving God all along you are serving God In Living Word Tabernacle but God chose you because he wants you to serve him in a different category you have promised God if you could get well that you will go on and sink deeper things of God are you there we had milk we had skin milk we were growing like children now it's the time of maturity are you there we need to think like a dog in Christ are you there brother Brian I'm in perfect Faith he says I want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how I love brother Branham we are too close to the end coronaviruses bringing this word into a chaos we don't even know what's going to happen we are very close to the end we've been in the message for so long we are too close to the end now and I believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper faith are you there and Rob some of this make-believer out and get into something real it's got to be something that you know enough following the message not knowing what you're doing in the message are you there enough of that this is the time to get into the world so that God's looseness can be chopped away they make beliefs can be chopped away we don't have to argue again whose father pranam what is what is what when I'm talking when is God talking we have to chip those stuff away so you can serve God in a different category pretty good The Mystery of the two steps part one when we describe the Ark of the Covenant there is two steps to the Ark of the Covenant and we want to know what's wrong with those two states they say mystery brother Stephen brother Branham already preached Mysteries when I say mystery in this church I am not preaching a new mystery are you there I am only repeating the Mysteries that were already been revealed by the seventh angel which is brother Branham where the sanding of the seven angels all the Mysteries the message is Mysteries foreign the Mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is a scripture so a scripture is a mystery is a preciously previously hidden truth now divinely reveal but which is a supernatural element still remain despite the Revelation are you there so when God unfold the mystery he always locked the supernatural element are you there because if the supernatural element is not locked even the devil can get access to the things of God but the things of God are only for the elect only the elect can catch the mind of God are you there so if you say God revealed the seals if you give somebody the book of the seal everybody can read the book of the seal but even though you are reading the book of the seal there is still a supernatural element despite the Revelation are you there amen praise the Lord as we're getting there brother Branham why you are one Mysteries all the time Christ is what the mystery of God revealed the Bible is written in Mysteries are you there the whole Bible here is written in Mysteries Jesus thanked the father for it see that he was wrought in Mysteries the statue of a perfect man but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God the whole word is wrought in and only the knowledge of God can reveal it because there is still a supernatural element despite the revelation praise the Lord then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add to that add that to your faith in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Branham say but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why we have the trouble in the message that we have today people handle Mysteries people spoke about Mysteries but they never took time to teach the Mysteries because the mystery requires a teaching of the spirit or it will never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit heal and to know now when we look at the Ark of the Covenant the Oak right here is coupled by with The Mercy Seat the top part there is The Mercy Seat and the bottom one is the ark itself which is a box are you there a box of shitty mood or a cassia wood overlay with gold Now The Mercy Seat was the very Throne of God and The Mercy Seat have to name depending on the presence or the absence of the blood when the blood is upon the mercy said it was called the throne of grace and because Jesus Christ died he rose again and the lamb went and sat on the throne we have access to God to God and bring our petition and bring our problem and bring our trouble because as long as the blood is still on the throne God said approach him boldly with Assurance knowing that our prayer Our supplication will be answered by God are you there but once the blood is taken off then that Throne turned into a throne of judgment are you there depending whether the blood is there or not now we are dealing with the ark what is a knock praise the Lord what is an ark now the word Ark is a leader chest Kama or a place of Escape second come on a hiding place three definition there is three of them sparking the Old Testament the first one is a leader chest the leader chest spoke about the oak of the Covenant which was made by Moses the second definition brother Branham said it means a place of Escape a place of Escape spoke about the Ark of Noah are you there because the people that enter into the Ark of Noah escaped the judgment are we clear number three a hiding place spoke of the Ark of Moses where they put Moses as a baby are you there but brother Branham said there is three Ark first there is a little chest which is the Ark of the Covenant there is a place of Escape which spoke about the Ark of Noah and then there is a hiding place where they hide Moses and they put him into a little basket that basket was the oak everybody clear so Enoch can be a little chest out of the Covenant a place of Escape Ark of Noah Hiding Place Ark of Moses which they call the basket there is three of them spoke in the Old Testament those are the three and we want to look at those three now for a few moments all those three were tapping one great Arc which is who everybody clear so they all come Noah spoke about Christ they all cause Moses talk about Christ they all called The Covenant spoke about Christ to the church today through is a confirmation all the old things just foreshadowing something are you there so based on what brother Branham said because we are preaching Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery according to the message of the hour based on the definition of brother Branham the org tabs Christ everybody clear praise the Lord trying to do God the service without being in his will the ark was done the word we know that's right because the art is he never he doesn't contradict himself Christ is the word are you there and Christ is the word see the ark or the word I want to go down they got a Methodist Arc a Baptist Ark a presbyterian Ark everybody's going into this Arc for a Great Tribulation coming glory to God I was baptized in the Methodist Ark the Presbyterian the Pentecostal art there is only one Earth that is Jesus Christ and he is the word So based on the second definition the ark represented the word which is Christ everybody clear praise the Lord but when Moses made the Caribbean when he made the Throne of God he puts the Caribbeans around the throne but when Ezekiel Saw the Caribbeans he saw that there was a throne God was there the pillar of fire was there the Caribbeans were there but they were also the presence of the wheels but when Moses met the Ark of the Covenant Moses never made the wheels everybody following me there were nothing in the wheels what does the will means in the vision of Ezekiel brother Branham what is the symbol here brother Branham what is it it means that this God speaking about the four living creature these gods was God's Ark they were in Germany because the ark was moving from one place to another are you there all right Rolling On Wheels when Ezekiel Saw them but when John saw them in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 they had already come into the right position in heaven but Moses was told to reproduce Heaven on the Earth are you there that was not the end time yet that was the beginning of God dealing with a nation but instead of Moses putting the words down Moses did not put the will right everybody following me but Moses look at the Ark in heaven in heaven when John unfold Heaven no ways you follow me but is it yourself there are wheels meaning the ark was moving from one place to another the Ark of God was on Earth it from place to is saying here that when the Ark of the Covenant was moving from place to place he was rolling on will but when Moses made the Earth Moses never made wheels meant he was in trouble they took it all the way through the Wilderness you see now and all the way into the Temple and so forth brother Branham said he was rolling on Wheels when you look at the Ark of the Covenant he was now rolling on wheels he was actually carried by people it's coming up clear but now it will receive up because the church is over speaking about John and it's received up in glory see it is stationary now in heaven with all angels and things around them so the wheels that Ezekiel Saw were talking about the ark being in Journey or the Earth moving from one place to another justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit Ephesus Smyrna there were somebody in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick that were journeying in the midst of the church the ark was moving [Music] everybody clear how is those doing how are those wheels made why some people can keep the victory now you know Ezekiel say it again talking about Ezekiel and he this same prophet he saw it as a will in the middle of her will turning in the air now these Wills how are they made brother Brian I'm saying now Wheels first there is a realm he back up again there is the tire everybody knows what the tire means there is the ram everybody knows what the ram means there is death right there and there is the Hub so the middle right there off the wheel that was in the middle of the wheel brother brought him describe it like a harbor but what does the Hub represent let's ask Ezekiel that great prophet Ezekiel come here Ezekiel what one of them is calling Ezekiel of your glory says Deep thing what thinking of Christ's Ezekiel say let's call Ezekiel we want to hear your testimony a bad class we want to hear your testimony a boy Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ to you is it here is it just said when I saw him he was away in the middle of a will are you there standing way in the middle of the year in other words the whole creation was revolving around there are you there so the wheel in the middle of the wheel was the harbor in the world every smoke right every room everything else depend on the how in the will the will in the middle of the will Look Away to Jesus essential Look Away to see him one day and he was a will in the middle of the will way up in the middle of the year he was there they have to do will where every spoke is fastened to amen the big will run by faith but the leader will turn by the power of the Lord where are you taking us take first Chronicle chapter 28. do you think these are stuff to rush we can Rush get you excited you go home and you come on a parking lot you say what was he talking about Ezekiel 28 verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen of first Chronicle I'm sorry Chris cracker chapter 28 verse 18 love this church and the Holy Spirit work in heaven on everybody praise the Lord first Chronicle chapter 28 verse 18. you dare you can say Amen and for the other old persons we found God by weight and God by the pardon of what can you preach with me by the pardon of what Chariot of the so the Jeremy had a chariot no wonder every one of them had a will so their Chariot was carrying the Ark of the Covenant everybody clear from the Bible but when Moses met the Orca Moses God never taught Moses make the will instead of the will God say Moses make two steps are you there make two steps to stay for one two carry the Earth but the Ark of the Covenant was carried on her chariot the head four Cherry beans and every cherubim had her will but instead of God telling Moses to make the wheels God said just make the steps and those stairs will be the one bearing the Orca Moses made here safe and maybe the children came in the morning they say Prophet Moses we saw the ark we saw the staff but where are the wheels are you making them tomorrow Moses said according to what he shows me no wheels they went back to their father they said Daddy Daddy Moses is making an ark he's making stuff but no will how is this Earth gonna move are you there praise the Lord if they charge the Caribbeans where had the chariot are you following me a chariot had an action I'm going slowly are you there everybody saying that the answer is a road are you following me it's a stove it's a stuff that connects the will into the chariot foreign praise the Lord but when the ark had to be carried instead of Moses bringing wills and hooking the will into the staff so they can begin to move their Ark Moses said the ark is going to be carried by people never give you a scripture but when we look at the ark the ark was moving by some Christian are you following me then there's two Axel those two stairs were put on the shoulder of the prison are you there so now when delivered move to the right the ark move to the right when the liver move to the left the ark moves to the left praise the Lord what does he mean brother Branham you got to go back the way God said to do it do it then put it upon the shoulder of delivered and that was over there are we okay are we okay so the wheels of the Ark have to be hooked to a hub because the harbor was the middle part here and the answer coming to the hub of your car and begin to move it because if you take the axle off you will leave your car your car will be sitting on the wheel it's not going to move but the actual first bear the lord of the vehicle and also engage into the Hub and remove the wheel God said let them put it on the shoulder in either way the Hub it was the heart look the ark the word is not to be back upon a new denomination upon the theory of some men but in the Ark itself never sat on the priest are you there he was the staff that sat on the fist the stairs were the one engaging with the priest thank you the word of God is not to be handled by denomination it is to be handled by the heart of a man brother Stephen The Hub they spoke the ram are you trying to say that these people were Rams a thinking man's filter as I spoke this morning and last Sunday morning on that wheel in the middle of the or a leader inside okay remember Living Word Tabernacle we taught you that in the heart of a man there was a small compartment when they were no blood going into it you remember that and that was the occupancy of the show so when they say heart in the Bible they are referring to sow and brother Brahman said the Hub the little will in the middle of the way was ah that's where the Paul all the staff have to be engaged [Music] on the inside of the how that the spirit on the outside between the soul and the just like the worms have pot three parts the human being also has three parts like a rainbow like a will foreign [Applause] are you there God told Moses make the ark make the power don't put will but I'm gonna use man to move the gospel I'm going to use men to move the world why did he use men Hallelujah the whales of mortal life is turning here in my life so man Naturally Speaking have his own will Hallelujah we're in University remember that the head four wheels I'm gonna do this so it will just make sense hey Chariot with four wheels but man brother Branham said there is Wheels in men Naturally Speaking a man has wheels in himself are you there so God comes and borrow the wheels of a man are you there one time in the river of Jordan God filled the entire Chariot in Jesus Christ of the man Jesus Christ the whales of mortal life is turning here in my body making my hand Rich my eyes to look my lips to speak and so forth every willing there turning will stand still if you watch Wills is plural are you there if you remember the Chariot of the Caribbeans have four wheels plural are you there question and answer these little Wills that is turning in US natural life of a man where you are born from your mama and papa Wheels in us see taste film smell in other words five senses when he's talking about the body here these little senses and wheels that is turning in this water life someday they shall stand still in other words your natural life have a beginning you have a man but the reason not the life that is called eternal life or everlasting life that life have no beginning no ending and God wants to take that life and put it in your life are we together I hope I didn't lose anybody one we were made when we were made or created they just found out recently that your body is made full of light x-ray proved that the X-ray does not have any light of its own it is your light that he uses everybody following me you are born with four ways you are born with four wheels after a little while say 20 or 25 one way goes out are you there you begin to grow up and 35 another or for the another way goes out you walk up my back hurt are you there and finally when you give pass you get past about 65 you are living on your last way because your wheels will have to stop one day that's why you need a different will you need a power you need a staff to engage into your heart you need a pipe to connect to your heart to bring you a different life are you there every time you take an x-ray picture you are telling them them you are telling them raise them that's the reason you don't have no more you stick this kid fits in them machines because it's just tearing the Rays out of their little body don't be playing with the hospital all the time it is the tree of Good and Evil it's only necessary are you there only necessary a little bit let's go to the hospital a little bit let's go to the hospital and that's Cosmic light that is in you that you are made of full of light cell now that is Cosmic life where are we going brother Stephen why is God engaging into men then the Chicana Glory range from their Mercy Seat speaking about Moses one day and he said on another Tabernacle the Lord will come suddenly you remember suddenly are you there amen this one the father judges no man but he's committing all judgment to the son God judgments it speaking about Jesus Christ you speak against me I will be he'll be forgiven speak another one coming another Mercy Seat because Jesus taught them that if you insult me if you blood use the will because I'm gonna use man one word against said will never be forgiven paragraph 32 32 now the first Throne was in that's what Moses saw that's what John saw the judgments it the second Throne was in everybody clear and the third Throne is in we clear Satan has no this all along he also wanted wants to enjoy men even as God sowed us but God has reserved to himself that right Satan only enter his own children [Music] are you there the Bible said send them enter Judah because Judah was a son of perdition Perdition means hell Judah came from hell that therefore have claim on him but the devil does not help claim on you because you come from God and you are going back to God sometimes he acts in denial he want to ignore that that's why it's better to remind him I am not your child I come from God I'm gonna go to God go get in the Pope let me because the pope come from the bottomless people he comes from hell not me I come from God I am going back to God Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative power the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirit in the Edgar and gatherer God does not enter but Satan came and will to accomplish his that's why brother Branham said when you see an animal a lion killing somebody telling somebody brother Branham saying that's Satan are you there but God does not enter animal God enter human beings that's why he taught Moses make the poor but do not make the wheel I'm gonna borrow human will just like God borrow the will of Christ are you there and they flew and had got eyes Within without within and behind this is Revelation chapter four it's speaking about the Caribbean with eyes he spoke off there remember the wheels have also and they had the spirit of the so the intelligence of the Caribbeans were in the wheel okay they know what was witches and which shall come for they were us right at the seat so close till there was not even human the different type Temple God but this is The Mercy Seat guard the throne God the throne right up next to God living creature next things to God standing there their intelligence they know what was witches and what shall come they had eyes without showing what they could see what was to come with eyes within knows everything now and as in the back which knoweth what was which was which is which shall come reflecting through the churches he that was witches and shall come Jesus Christ the same today and that's why a prophet have an ability to get into your life and go back 20 years and go back forward and tell you I see you at the doctor in 1964 now you are standing here but I can see you also heal go your faith has healed you saw it before you even experience it because that anointing of the Caribbeans it's there in since the past it seems the present and it sees the future are you there he comes through the feet come back out through Wesley then in the Pentecost of the tongues in the lips see now it is in the prophetic of Malachi the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it is his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things he can do it it is God himself why because God have borrowed men that's why the gospel is always carried by men God could have sent the angel down he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice of Her that's why we say this force is not the voice of brother Branham it is the voice of God the tone is brother Branham but the voice behind the voice is God always use men for his work is that right he don't use organizations or so forth and Mechanical Devices but he uses the Holy Spirit fell upon that is God's instrument here on that's why he taught Moses don't do the wheels I'm gonna move the ark but they all cut the Covenant will be moving by men men will be the one preaching the gospel man will be the one moving the gospel God does not fall upon denomination God does not fall upon mechanical device God the Holy Spirit fell upon man is God's and the hardest things that God have ever had to do was to get one to believe are you there let me skip this one the wills of God's power and Kingdom can't turn because we got old sludgy dirty what are you there so if God need to borrow you you gotta make sure you don't have your heart your answer is clean are you there because God cannot engage his power in an unclean vessel because power without character is satanic dirty acts of Greece in it that don't belong there in other words you are made for something higher than the life you're living now are you there what we need tonight is the washing by the by the word the true love and the holy God's power to come back into the church to start the wheels of God's economy timing in other words you need the watching so that God can come down and borrow your will and begin to move his gospel foreign cleansing that is not natural water the water of Separation was not at water at all it was the ashes of the heifer that has been killed and led that Assad with her blood streak how many times you know what it means right over the door Exodus chapter 19 where are we getting there that sweet Holy Spirit that's something in human heart make it call out with the love of God to do the will of God not to jump up and down and holler not run all over the building not speak with tongues not pray for the sick not prophesy not interpret die what I'm talking about that is the outward something what about them didn't say it's not good bad that's good that is something of the spirit that's right in other words we're okay with that but if there is not something in there to Anchor you with that if you don't have a stage that is put in there to connect you to the ark are you there it does not do a bit of good we have the word we have the message we need the staff to connect you to the word are you there it's a will I was talking without uh happening if that is not anchor back thereby love it shall do harm than he does in other words you cannot have the gift without The Giver of love if you don't have that you're gonna cause trouble because give them calling are without repentance and these little things that is moving on now these leaves are what mother that is stunning all came by the program of who so when God gives you your natural life God has a purpose for that God have an intent for that God have a program for your life are you there that's right so he knows how to take care of them if you just let him have them so what you need to do take your wheels and do what surrender them to the one who program you Hallelujah if you keep them you shall lose them if you give it to him you shall find them that's why but you'll be sure to give it to him and give all your and your to him tonight now that he can have the right way in your remember the Paul walls were enough open your heart slow down that can engage that's your son lay aside every sin that is unbelief and the weight that boosts easily beset you that we might run this race with passion that set before us looking to the example Jesus Christ God son so we understand here that's the will that moved the oak where human being everybody clear if you remember when uh Israel was coming before Jordan God taught Israel patriarch are you there and move to the Earth to the water of Jordan God never taught Israel when the Ark of the Covenant touched the water are you there God told them when they fit of delivered you can look it up in Joshua are you there not the ark as long as the arc is not delivered it is no more the ark that's why Paul said it is not me it is Christ are you there are you there so now when the liver to move the power of the world is on delivered are you there when the water so defeat us they lived out are you there how many people took a bath in that order the one that never moved but when they leave that comes with the Ark in the heart the water must go away Jordan death take Joshua chapter one chapter 21. are we navigating are we navigating good [Applause] all right at this point you already forgot about bills we are in a different world you forget about who gossip about you you are like where are we going where are we going where are we going are you there before you know it you live in here here Hallelujah Joshua chapter 21 if you dare you can say Amen verse 13. thus they gave the children of who Aaron the what so the priests or the children of Aaron were given cities are you there Hebron with her suburb to be City of Refuge for the slave and libna with her stubborn and Jetty with her suburbs and ishta Moya with her stubborn and Holland with her seven and deeper with her suburb verse 16 and in with her Sovereign and Judah with her servant and what but Shemesh so bessemes was a privacy of who of priests the sons of Aaron Moses was given the sons of Heron City Joshua they say you take this you take this you take this you take this and in the land of Judah he was in Judah they gave the priests the city called bedshames among those cities nine cities out of those two tribes everybody clear all right let's go to first Samuel what is wrong with vegetables about the Stephen let's go to verse six Israel have seen the son of ela sinned and when the sons of ela sins God came and brought judgment to Israel Israel went to war and when they want to own the two sons of Ilah took the Ark of the Covenant when do we fit and thought that because the Earth is there they're going to go ahead and win the battle for some reason the Philistine heal them overcame them and took the Ark of the Covenant and left with it when the Ark of the Covenant went into the cities of the Philistine it began to destroy and to kill the people even their own God were broken down the Philistine look they say ah this is a hot potato are you there take the shark and send it back to where he belongs are you there that's first Samuel chapter six and the Ark of the Lord was in the country of the philistine you know seven right not Sixth Man not five only under seven right it's on the seven when they say lose it are you there seven months do you know that David used the sword of Goliath for his life are you there the sword came with Goliath are you there and David took it from Goliath and sharp Goliath with that sword are you there denominational being as the Bible we pulled the Bible from them and we chop them with the same Bible are you there are you there when it came with goliathy the sword was in the shift it was a sealed word are you there it was a word that was failing David unveiled and went in some fell he chopped the head of Goliath you need the word unveil thank you and the Philistine called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the Ark of the Lord tell us where if we shall send it to its place and they say if you send it away the Ark of the god of Israel send it not empty these are the priests of the Philistine trying to do God a service to the best of their understanding are you there but in any words we turn him a trespass offering you behind the word they say we have sin in order to send this you need to take it and send this asking forgiveness everybody clear this is verse three and you shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you job one verse 7. now before therefore make a new what so the idea of making a cut to move the Ark of the Covenant was an idea from the philistine yes come here you're already clicking that's what I like about this church so the new card used as the wheels off the ark was the revelation of philistine was David born here okay all right make and take two milk cows on which there was to come New York they're doing to the best that's why God spoke Paul said of the years of ignorance he said when God was winking and letting Every Nation do us the will but this time Paul said now you need to repent if you need those scriptures see me after I'm trying to stay focused and bring the curves home from them and take the Ark of the Lord and lay it upon thee in other words the manufacture Wills made by men to move the ark but they were hidden did not know the best that we can and put the Jews of God which you return him a trespass suffering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that he may go watch verse 9 and see if he goes by the way of its own because to what why are those priests why they didn't say if he goes to devil they were oppressed they handle sacred stuff but they say we need a place where Israel have preached the handle sacred staff and let's say that there are you there then he has done us this great evil but if it's not then we shall know that is not his hand that's more does it was a chance that happened to us in other words we're gonna put the ark with the cows if they all take the direction of bed shemit we know that he was God whipping us if he goes into a different direction then he was just a natural occurrence of a pandemic it was just a Corona or something are you there okay but if he goes this way so the Quran is a whooping if he goes that way it was just to happen now it makes sense are you there let's go to verse 10 and the man did so and took two milk cow and tied them to the car and shut up their calves at home and they laid the Ark of the Lord upon the court and they covered with the mice of God and the images of the Emirates because God whipped them with that watch very carefully verse 12. are you there is everybody awake okay verse 12 and the cows took the who was driving the cow by the Robert Corden who was driving the cow they just took the ark they put it in the Kinder in the court without any driver they called themselves begin to sing you want me to read it let's read it and the cow took the straight away watch and went in the highway doing what brother Branham say they were singing because when David put the Ark of the Covenant David put musician around it as soon as the cow received the ark nobody gave them a GPS [Music] are you there nobody told them Gastonia is here Charlotte is here they turn around to Gastonia and they start no driver but when they are going they are going who is driving discount watch and verse 12 and the cow took the straight way to the way of what because beds are not have preached bless the man to have a tire shop in bed Summers there is priests there is Wheels there is tired are you there praise the Lord the ark verse 12 Benjamins and went along the highway rowing singing as they went and turn not a sad to the or today you remember you got it the Caribbeans when they move they move they don't move to the right or to there so as soon as they put the ACT they carry beams took care of the charter are you there when you look you don't see nobody but the Kelly beams anointing hook the cow you don't move to the right you don't move to the left that's our movement we're gonna direct you where you gonna find new tires to better are you there knowing turning not to the right or to the left and the lord of the Philistine went after them to the border of vegetables in Judah and they are betterment were whipping what there he was in the Harvest Time when the shark the life have left the shark the life is in the grain it is in that time in the seven months that the Caribbean begin to bring the ark to bed Shemesh this message is everywhere are you there harvest in the valley and they lift up their eyes and saw the ark and we judge to see it watch everybody awake verse 14 and they called verse 14 and the court came into the field of who I didn't write the Bible my friend who was Joshua work with Joshua which is the top of the Holy Spirit because the Caribbeans were the one directing and the Caribbean always run up with the pillar of Fire so there are nothing of the Caribbeans were following Joshua and the court came into the field of who Joshua the best and stood there as soon as the card right there the Caribbeans put the brick they say the word must rest in the field where the Holy Ghost is what and stood there where there was ah oh my God so the field of Joshua hath not a stone but uh in another translation he said a rock not a rock but a great Reformation in the field of Joshua are you there do you know the name of that rock let me tell you but let's stop there I'm going to give you the name then we come back to that chapter to that verse Job to verse 18 and the golden mice according to the number of the cities of philistine belonging to the five Lords both offense is this head of Country Village even to the Great that great to revelation of who the great son of who by faith Apple offer a more sacrifice then he was the revelation of apple apple through the lamb who was prefiguring the lamb who was slain before the foundation of the world but this stone is a revelation higher than ever let's go back to verse 12. verse 14 and the court came in the field of Joshua where the holy spirit is the priest under the Holy Spirit are you there a better man and stood there where there was a great revelation of able the great revelation of the slaying of dilemma and in the Book of Revelation 5 when they say who is why the two take the book and break the seals they say it's what the lion but when he was coming he was coming a lamb that was what a greater Revelation than ever are you there First Watch verse 14. a great Stone and they did what the split word in other words when the word came in the camp in the field Father Brown I'm saying a field is a church when the word came in that church of Joshua are you there in that church there was a great Revelation the priest took the ark but they took the cut and begin to break the cart they don't keep the ark take the ark split the wood of the what destroying the revelation of the philistine beautiful okay are you there we need the sword but I don't need Goliath David pulled the sword but he's chopping Goliath Goliath was the carrier of the soul but Goliath is a Philistine I don't need him he's an enemy he's against God I need the sword but I'm gonna destroy him we need the ark but we don't need denominational system [Music] we don't need Baptist saying the message we don't need Methodist in the message we don't need Catholicism in the message give us the scripture give us the Bible but not your Creed not your Dogma are you there destroy Court and offered the cow not only the card even the power that was pulling the cart they took it slightly a perverted revelation are you there but God let them go to the best of their understanding are you there are you there offered the cows a burnt offering to them watch verse 15 and there now the tires are coming now the tires are coming are you seeing and they leave that took what the correct tires are coming they say number one destroy all the The Creeks destroy all the Joel Austin although the Jimmy strugged remove them remove remove them Laura's Larkins put them away put them in there put them there put him there now delivered when the hook click click correctly like in Sabino Canyon when brother Branham was crying when the sword came when he struck the hand of brother brothers in other words he click click let go are you there delivered took down the Ark of the Lord and the coffee that was with him wearing the Jews of God was there and put them under on that great Revelation they didn't have only the ark they have the Oak and the great Revelation so they took the ark and put it on the Revelation they took the Bible and put it upon the message [Music] that's how you understand your Bible you understand your Bible by the message are you there a great message a great Revelation that's where one come to the prophet you take the word you put it there then you begin to worship God are you there are you there so the wheels are human beings not the denominational card the nomination of God you kill it destroy it you don't need it now don't miss this they fail together because later on David came and David found the Ark of the Covenant in the house of amidad and David had the good desire he wanted the Earth to come back but instead of Consulting the prophet are you there are you there instead of Consulting the prophet he said I am a great David I was a small Shepherd now I am International everybody knows me everybody is afraid of David I'm a great king I don't think I need a prophet anymore are you there let me go let me go back to the philistine and get the idea are you there dancing who started with God went and pick up the cause and begin to move the Ark by the revelation of the Philistine trying to do God the service with that being of his will took a new card read your Bible took the cow and have drivers and people were sick Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Hallelujah the anointing is there God just took a little stone and predestinated a stone somewhere maybe somebody was working in that field and he hit the rock said I need to remove that and something say leave that work and move around and that rock was coming and suddenly the ox hit it when the Earth's heated the ark began to move an innocent jealous we are in this we're going to support you we're gonna We're not gonna let this fall We're not gonna let this move fall I am with you I am with you I am with you when they touch the Earth God struck them innocent [Music] and the mind came back did you consult the prophet if you would want to buy the Prophet The Prophet will tell you your idea is good but you need the correct will to move the ark don't miss this they fell together because they had not consulted by going to the priest by going to the Theologian by going to the military forces to ask them whether it was a rocket that you shoot or he was not a rocket that you shoot U.S Air Force was that a rocket in 1963 you're going to ask the military forces you're going to ask the Baptist about the message you're going to consult the Methodist to tell you about the message you're going to compare the message with Lawrence clerking with all those people and the military forces to give you report whether an airplane was flying or Not by doing that and not even considering their [Music] [Applause] nothing they did it they went and pick up the Oak and put it upon a new exactly what the Philistine do put it upon a new and you is going to we're gonna start a new move and not upon the God given or dead way to package it was supposed to be back on the shoulder off there but you see when you start round you want to keep on going you need to go back again brother Stephen we understand the wheels we understand everything or they are these two states we're gonna touch one of them and next Sunday we touch the second one okay let's get one of them then we drop to the airport take Zechariah Chapter 11. [Music] one of them if you dare you can say Amen The Mystery of the two states so now today when they say the will in the middle of the will you know now when Ezekiel saw him the wheel in the middle of the wheel he heard it we heard the world is the way chapter 11. are you there few people are you there Zechariah 11 chapter 4 that saved the Lord my God feed the flock of the so a flock that was predestinated to be killed the flock of the solder verse 5 whose possessor slayed them so God give this Shepherd flock instead of feeding the flock they begin to kill them spiritually slay them and hold themselves not guilty in other words there is no even a conscience to feel bad if you destroy you go back to the world that's your problem they can kill you all they need is your money they don't need you fight with your husband all you want we don't care are you there whose possess or slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them bless say blessed be the Lord for I am so the flock the church is not anymore about the caring of the people but it becomes a business a way of living to make money that's what you see in Pentecost for it's all about money getting the pastor a nice car getting the best of big money getting the pastor wife good getting the pastor uh uh what kids lives like princess but do whatever you do smoke he pays a lot of tight don't say nothing about it Don't Preach against that marriage and divorce [Music] because he's going to leave the church away with your CEO I am rich and their own Shepherd pitted them not they don't care it's a business they're selling them for I will no more pity the inhabitant of the land say they all but oh Lord I will deliver the man everyone into his neighbor's hand and into the hand of his King thank you brother David The Voice came back and they shall snap to the land out of the hand I will not deliver them verse 7 and I will feed the flock of the slaughter it becomes slaughtered to the shepherd even you oh poor off the flock and I took to me what okay there is a flock that became a play to the preacher a pray to the pastor the pastor don't care about the souls anymore as long as they want to be popular they want to make money they want to do everything they are living for their own belly God looked he said don't worry I'm gonna take care of this but I'm gonna take care of this boy they Ark of The Confident head you okay to Steve and I took to me two steps the one are called the correct translation is favored you can look it up the first Rod Zechariah call it Beauty the correct translation is favor or grace even those that have the Bible in French they will see called favor or Grace in French are you there look it up it says favor or Grace the one I'll call Beauty or Grace or favor and the other are called bands the correct translation of bands is Union you can look it up and I fed the flock so there is two steps here that God is gonna use to feed his flock one step is called favor or Grace another is called Union one bring you guys another one unites you verse 9. let me jump to verse 10. and I who's talking God I took my it's called Steve it's called staff it's called Road or Pope I took my stuff even beauty or Grace and I and carry the sander so God took this step that is called Grace and God broke it praise the Lord that I may break my Covenant which I have made with all the people so the people have a covenant with God but with that people God will bring a state but God will take that step and break it to break his Covenant with his people everybody clear and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock which is the flock of the slaughter that waited upon me so that Frank was waiting upon God to come God sent them a safe that staff was Grace and they took the staff God broke the slave to break the Covenant with the people so that the elect of that people will understand catch something knew that it was the word of the Lord everybody there and I this is beauty we're talking about beauty or Grace and I say to them if you think good give me my past if not for bear so they waited for my price how much 30 pieces of what so that's five Congress when the evaluated by those people they said it costs 30 pieces of you see with that stuff is you see who's that save is the law came by Moses but came by are we okay praise the Lord verse 13 and the Lord said to me cast it to The Potter's hand to the Border a goodly pass that I was present in other words valued add them of them and I took 30 pieces of silver and casted to the borders In The House of the so let's stop there because that's the first thing so we got two steps here we got Grace and Union are you there they're two slaves now we are we're gonna talk about Grace and next time we pick up on Union with Grace we found that there is a prophecy the prophecy said when Grace come we're going to evaluate him and when we evaluate him we're gonna sell him for 30 pieces of silver because God will break him and by breaking him he's breaking his confidence with his people we okay take Matthew 27. if you're there you can say Amen who was speaking about that prophecy which book did we hear right 27 Matthew 27 verse 3. if you dare you can say Amen then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself betray who and brought again there [Music] so that staff is somebody it is not a rod we okay 30 pieces of silver to the chief priest and Elder saying I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see you to that and he cast down the third the pieces of silver in the temple remember take the pieces of silver and go to the temple in there throw it to the Border in the temple and deported and went and hang himself everybody there let me go to verse eight to save time wherefore that field was the field of To This Day verse 9 everybody wake up please and was fulfilled that which was spoken by stop who spoke when we read who gave the prophecy let's continue brother I'm saying here brother brought them say here it is different and then here he said this way oh let's throw out to the message the Bible say in Zechariah Matthew say it is in the day you're gonna find it in Jeremiah come and see me Nine Dead was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying they took what who spoke about 30 pieces amen put that together you see you see let's throw the Bible away it is not logical you see by Jeremiah the prophet saying they took the 30 pieces of silver the price of him that was who spoke about these words but why is Matthew saying Jeremiah you see now 30 pieces of silver the price of him that was value whom they of the children of what did in Israel remember once in Covenant with God are you there and God have to take the Messiah and break him we okay now to the children of Israel verse 10 and gave them to the Zechariah as the Lord appointed in other words the staff Congress was the man who okay now and the staff can never be separated from the ark are you there in the beginning was there the ark and the Word was with and the word was there if you want to touch the ark God struck you are you there but if you see Jesus you can touch God you handle God by the stairs you manipulate God ban the stairs Hallelujah take Exodus 17 we almost get into the event foreign Exodus 17. you there Exodus 17 verse 4. verse 4. and Moses cried to the Lord saying what shall I do to these people they be almost ready to Stun Me and the Lord said to Moses go on before the people and take with you the Elders of Israel and you all where if you smoke the river take in your hand and go behold I will stand before you upon the rock in and you shall Smite The Rock God is going to stand on the rock you follow me God standing on the Rock but take the Rock and smite it and you're gonna smack the rock you shall smile The Rock and then shall come order out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elder of Israel remember that Steve was broken by God God said I'm going to stand in a rock Smite The Rock who is that rock take First Corinthians chapter 10. if you dare you can say Amen you're almost to the airport for those who are hungry First Corinthian s 10. if you dare you can say Amen if you dare you can say Amen verse 4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that same of that spiritual word rock that followed them and that rock was so God God Moses take the Judgment Road and go and do what strike crust right Isaiah 53. probably the last one he was God that broke that take Isaiah 53 now and we're gonna land with Isaiah 53 you there let's start by verse 3 verse 2 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plan and as the root out of a dry ground he has no form no comliness and when he we shall see him there is no do you see why the correct translation is not Beauty okay do you see that there is no beauty that we should desire of him he is what despite and rejected of man a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as he wear our faces from him he was despised and we esteem him there is still the Messiah for 30 pieces of silver devalue 30 pieces of silver are you there surely he has bought our grief and carry that sorrow yet we did the steam him what it's making off who Smite him who broke that stuff everybody clear sleeping of God and Afflicted verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was what God did it and of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he and he made his grave with the wicked and with the witch in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet he pleased us to do what he pleased God to break him that stealth Grace he pleased God to break it by by breaking that he's breaking his Covenant with Israel because he's going to the Gentile are you there but to touch the ark to enter the ark you need Christ and God need Wills and your Paul is Jesus Christ and Jesus need to connect to your heart together now he's smart The Rock what they came out and he was a type of crust in John 3 16 God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life a perishing people in the wilderness was saved by a smitten rock and a perishing people is safe today perishing in sin perishing in iniquity because the smitten Son of God taking their place water the spirit rolling out are you there in Hebrew 12 if you go there and you look over there the Bible says that we didn't come into a mountain that we cannot touch but we come to Mount Zion to the city of the Living God and in first John chapter 1 verse 1 the Bible says that what John spoke he said what we have heard what we have seen the Word of Life our hand have the did what they handle the Word of Life they handle the ark they handle God but to handle him by Christ are you there you cannot move the ark with your hand you cannot approach the presence of God yourself you cannot come into the presence of God yourself you're gonna be killed because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God before you approach God you need to make sure you are connected with the safe you are connected with trust when you are connected with Christ everything that you ask the father in mind then you can move the Earth to every direction you wanted if you want the world to heal your child the world will heal your child the word to get in your practice the word will get in your practice the word will affect your marriage the word will affect your children the word will affect your end the word will affect your health the word will affect your business it will affect everywhere but you must be connected to the right Paul in your heart removing all the grace removing all the sin removing all the iniquity cleaning up yourself by the washing of the world because because God wanted to borrow you God wants to use you in a different level in a different category but you need to clean up so he can bring Christ and who cries to you then you're gonna go with the wills of the Caribbean you're gonna move on with the wills of the Caribbeans you're gonna go with the wills of the Caribbean that's the father that's his makeup we're finishing here but if that man can only get back to God what Abraham is speaking about a man that was looking at the glass and he concentrate and the glass bust brother Branham say he was doing that by mental concentration brother random say what happened to that man the man had a gift he was built like that he's raised his life to a program like that and brother Branham said that shows that there was something made in that man he's fallen perverted condition but if that man can only get back to God are you there and let God get in him with that power turn loose of the kingdom of God he didn't have no conductor he doesn't have a pole to connect him are you there he was like a shotgun she said he can sing here with a beautiful voice that same voice can sing hip-hop but when it's in hip-hop it's outside of the will of God but when you take that voice you convert him you bring the Holy Spirit and cross hooked to that that voice can sing and somebody get healed are you there the Bible said he just flooded everywhere who brought upon them if that spirit that is in the man could be converted and put the pole the pole they save and put Christ in there connect him to Christ and then God borrow him as a will are you there where he is a conductor a conductor is a wire that conducted it's the pole you connect to Christ then the power of God is flowing through Christ into you are you there amen and let a man with that same faith in the conductor of the word of God he can raise the dead so that power that was shooting God breaking glasses can be utilized and directed differently and it's going to heal the people it was that same faith can raise the dead cleanse the leper cast out devil amen his fashion like a god he looks like God sure was that is the reason God was man man was God and this is his offspring man he is only trying to get a hold of man trying to get men into his hand God is only looking for your shoulder for your heart so he can connect the poor when he connects the power to you are going to be different than the eyes of your Wills will be enlightened you're gonna sleep You're Gonna See Vision you're gonna be awake and
