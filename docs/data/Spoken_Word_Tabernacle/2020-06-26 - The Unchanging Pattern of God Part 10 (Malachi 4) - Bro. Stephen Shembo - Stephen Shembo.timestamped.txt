[3:31] stand just just one sec I here with me
[3:34] it's Psalm 128 it says blessed is
[3:40] everyone that fear the Lord that walketh

[3:56] house their children like olive plants
[4:00] round about that table behold that this
[4:04] shall be that thus shall the man be
[4:07] blessed that feareth the Lord the Lord
[4:10] shall bless thee out of Zion and thou
[4:12] shalt see the good Jerusalem all the
[4:16] days of their life made thou shalt see a
[4:20] children's children and peace and I
[4:24] looked through several and and and I
[4:26] really I really just weren't happy with
[4:28] it with very many of them but this one
[4:30] kind of struck me it says with these
[4:32] three words dear Heavenly Father I begin
[4:36] my prayer but the man I see while on
[4:40] bended knee is always my earthly dad he
[4:44] is the image of the God the Father

[4:50] his love and care and the faith he

[22:52] let's go straight to our scriptures I
[22:56] know you had a break for couple weeks so
[23:00] we Maori boot our systems a little bit
[23:09] second King chapter 1 beginning by the
[23:17] third verse if you dare you can say Amen
[23:25] what David we put this board here and
[23:30] set the pulpit here so everybody can get
[23:35] up from there
[23:37] if you don't mind please you can put
[23:43] right in the middle there can everybody
[23:44] see it it's pretty good
[23:49] he's the connection between me and the
[23:52] board I can't help it
[23:55] second king chapter 2 which after 1
[23:58] verse 3 the Bible say but the angel of
[24:02] the Lord say to Elijah the Tishbite you
[24:07] might be seated because we need to build
[24:13] by the in the Lord say to teach so here
[24:20] we know the actual bodies are dressing
[24:23] his word
[24:26] and to woman or to somebody we don't
[24:30] know it's very bad everybody ready and
[24:37] inheritance the land I have been sent by
[24:41] the King to do a special mission he said
[24:44] to me the messenger of the Samaria and
[24:46] say to them is he not because there is
[24:49] not a God in Israel that you go to
[24:52] inquire of Belgium open the god of Ekron
[24:57] now therefore does say the Lord they
[25:01] Modell's they open the god of eco
[25:04] now therefore does say the Lord they
[25:08] meet aloud and they also meet Elijah
[25:12] with a word from the Lord
[25:14] Elijah had a dad saved the Lord these
[25:17] were messenger from Samaria the work
[25:20] Samaritan so we suppose that they should
[25:23] know Elijah the prophet everybody did
[25:27] now therefore that say the Lord you
[25:29] shall not come down from the bed in
[25:32] which you go a truly die and Elijah
[25:36] depart these people met Elijah the
[25:40] prophet this messenger spoke to Elijah
[25:43] the prophet this messenger heard has
[25:48] prophet Elbert clear now verse 6 and
[25:52] they say to him there came a man let me
[25:57] go back to verse 5 and when the
[25:59] messenger turned back to him he says to
[26:02] them talking about the king of Samaria
[26:04] why are you now turned back in other
[26:08] word I sent you for a mission written
[26:12] you didn't go to the mission you soon
[26:15] came back to me why did you come back so
[26:18] we expect this messenger to tell the
[26:21] king that we met a larger the Prophet we
[26:24] met Elijah the prophet with the save the
[26:27] Lord and Elijah give us a message but
[26:30] for some reason even though these
[26:32] messenger met Elijah the Prophet even
[26:36] though the metal
[26:37] the profit under the anointing of God
[26:39] even though they met Elijah the Prophet
[26:42] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[26:44] with that save the Lord despite the fact
[26:47] that they come encounter with the
[26:50] Ministry of the larger the Prophet yet
[26:52] they did not know or recognize who the
[26:56] man owes when they asked them why did
[26:59] you come in verse 6 they say there came
[27:03] a man so the metal aaja
[27:06] they didn't know was Elijah Elijah
[27:10] miracle in Israel
[27:12] Elijah will turn on the heart of Israel
[27:14] back to God
[27:16] Elijah Prague and
[27:19] I met him and still did not know him
[27:24] profit normally they should say we met a
[27:28] man of but they say a man of God they
[27:32] just say we met a man who is this man
[27:36] Allah we are and they say to him there
[27:41] came up a man a man up to meet us and
[27:44] say to us go turn again to the king that
[27:48] sent you and say to him that said the
[27:51] Lord he is he not because there is not a
[27:53] God in Israel that you sent to inquire
[27:56] of Beelzebub the god of Ekron therefore
[28:00] you shall not come down from the bed on
[28:02] which you are gone up but shall surely
[28:05] die I want to draw your attention to
[28:08] verse 7 and he said to them the king
[28:11] what manner of men in other words you
[28:16] are just telling me a man meet you but
[28:19] can you please describe me the man you
[28:23] said we met him and with that saith the
[28:25] Lord you are supposed to know who that
[28:28] man based on his worldwide ministry in
[28:32] Israel but you met Elijah you don't know
[28:35] him
[28:35] can you please describe me the man that
[28:39] you met give me a little bit more detail
[28:42] give me a little bit more description
[28:44] about the manner in what manner of man
[28:48] was he which came up to meet you and
[28:51] told you twirled verse 8 and they answer
[28:55] him he was a hairy man and girl with a
[28:59] girdle of leather and run a blood is
[29:03] launched and he said it is a larger the
[29:08] tisch body so the King needed more
[29:12] characteristic the King needed detail
[29:16] they came needed some more future the
[29:20] King needed a lot of description to
[29:23] identify who was the man that this
[29:27] Samaritan did not know about it so when
[29:30] they give him a prf physical appearance
[29:35] a physical karate
[29:37] mystic of the larger than the king
[29:40] understood that demand uh spoke with you
[29:43] was Elijah the prophet so Elijah the
[29:46] prophet was identified by his body
[29:50] future he was identified by his
[29:54] appearance he was identified by his
[29:57] characteristic everybody clear
[30:00] thank God let's go to second King
[30:03] chapter two just the next chapter to it
[30:08] you should be right on second Kings
[30:12] chapter 2 verse 8 if you dare you can
[30:14] say Amen and Elijah took his mantle this
[30:18] is Elijah with Elijah we all know the
[30:21] story and Elijah took his mantle and
[30:23] wrap it together and smote the orders
[30:27] and they were divided here and there so
[30:30] that day two went over on dry ground so
[30:34] Elijah and Elijah came in front of
[30:36] Jordan when they came in front of Jordan
[30:38] Elijah took his mentor repair on smite
[30:42] the order the water separated and they
[30:44] both went away and it came to pass when
[30:47] they were gone over that Elijah said to
[30:51] Elisha ask what I shall do for you
[30:54] before I be taken away from you and
[30:56] Elisha say a prayer you let a double
[31:01] portion of your spirit be upon me so a
[31:04] larger was asking for the anointing of
[31:08] the Spirit that was on Elijah the
[31:11] Prophet to come upon him but how are we
[31:15] going to recognize that the spirit of
[31:17] Elijah came upon Elijah how are we going
[31:21] to identify the spirit or the anointing
[31:25] of Elijah upon Elijah we know Elijah is
[31:29] a friend
[31:30] we know Elijah is brother rabbit we know
[31:34] Elijah is brother Abel but how can we
[31:37] look
[31:38] Robert how can we look and brother Abel
[31:41] and tell that it is not brother Abel
[31:44] who's working it is the anointing of God
[31:47] that is working upon ever it is not
[31:50] brother Robert who's working because
[31:52] it's the anointing of God working upon
[31:56] brother Robert even though the name is
[31:58] different but the anointing must be
[32:01] determined you need to understand these
[32:05] things if not you're going to miss God
[32:08] because God can change hell you got to
[32:12] know him by his characteristic everybody
[32:15] verse 13 hallelujah
[32:19] he took up also the mentor this is not
[32:22] Elijah Elijah is gone
[32:25] he dropped the mantle this is Elijah who
[32:28] took Demento we are trying to identify
[32:30] how are we going to be sure the spirit
[32:33] of Elijah came upon Elijah the Bible say
[32:37] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[32:40] that fell from him and went back and
[32:44] stood by the Bank of Jordan as far as
[32:48] the mentor we can say yes he is killing
[32:51] the mantle of Elijah he is carrying the
[32:54] tapes he's showing the books but how are
[32:59] we going to know if the god of Elijah is
[33:03] with you Alleluia the devil is a liar
[33:10] please God everybody and he took the
[33:15] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[33:19] smote the world in other word he went
[33:23] back and did exactly the same thing that
[33:26] Elijah did other and brother Branham say
[33:31] Elijah was the type of Jesus Christ and
[33:33] we say Elijah was the top of the church
[33:37] and Jesus said that the work that I do
[33:40] you shall do it also so to prove to us
[33:44] that Jesus is in your life we must
[33:48] see the same work that Jesus did because
[33:51] he's the same yesterday today and
[33:58] everybody clear
[33:59] he took the mantle of Elijah that fell
[34:03] from him and smote the orders and say
[34:06] where is the Lord God Marja not really
[34:12] God well is the anointing that work with
[34:16] Elijah
[34:18] you know I want the specific anointing I
[34:23] met Jordan just like my master met
[34:27] Jordan I asked him a double portion of
[34:30] his spirit if the Spirit came upon me I
[34:34] must cross Jordan the same way he
[34:37] crossed with me very clear and the Bible
[34:42] say and when he altos meet in the orders
[34:45] they did what the warrior obeyed him the
[34:51] water for the father here and there and
[34:54] Elijah not we 15 and when the sons of
[35:00] the Prophet in other word when Elijah
[35:03] was doing this some people were standing
[35:07] afar off watching him okay they saw him
[35:13] with the mentor but because he was
[35:16] carrying the mental they didn't say
[35:19] anything you can carry the book
[35:22] no problem we've seen so many of that
[35:25] you can listen to the tape it's good no
[35:29] problem we've seen people listening to
[35:32] the tape and acting crazy but those
[35:35] songs of the Prophet we are watching for
[35:38] something everybody let lets see you in
[35:42] front of Jordan then we're going to tell
[35:46] whether you have the anointing of the
[35:48] larger or not everybody there and when
[35:52] verse 15 and when the sons of the
[35:55] Prophet which were to view a Jericho
[35:58] so him they say the spirit of Elijah
[36:05] does rest on Elijah and they came to
[36:12] meet him and bowed themselves to the
[36:14] ground before him they identified the
[36:19] spirit of Elijah by the anointing they
[36:24] identified the spirit of Elijah by the
[36:27] works that he produced the man is not
[36:32] larger his name is Elijah but when they
[36:38] were talking to him they always see
[36:40] brother Elijah brother Elijah brother
[36:43] Elijah but when the anointing of Elijah
[36:47] manifested himself through him they
[36:51] didn't look at him anymore like Elijah
[36:55] they never look at his natural name
[37:00] anymore at the beginning they could say
[37:03] brother Billy at the beginning they
[37:08] could say brother anima but when the
[37:11] manifestation of the anointing cancer
[37:14] you need to check you from a natural
[37:17] standpoint all the way to a higher level
[37:20] where you don't look at the men anymore
[37:23] you don't look at the name anymore you
[37:27] don't look at the rest anymore but you
[37:30] identifying the man by the anointing
[37:35] hallelujah let's go to John chapter five
[37:43] then we going to pray
[37:49] if you dare you can say a man
[37:55] the first identification was by the body
[37:59] by the appearance the second
[38:02] identification was by this spirit by the
[38:05] anointing everybody clear
[38:10] at the opening of the seals the barber
[38:15] became a new book John chapter father
[38:20] verse 36 if you dare you can say Amen
[38:23] this is Jesus speaking but I have
[38:26] greater witness than that of John for

[46:44] I am God and I changed not the
[46:48] unchangeable God with the unchangeable
[46:52] character everybody clear and he is
[46:56] corrupt lipstick remember to identify
[47:00] Elijah
[47:02] they must have his characteristic
[47:06] everybody clear his characteristic
[47:09] remain the same he cannot change his
[47:14] characteristic he cannot do it anything
[47:18] is known by its character will state
[47:22] what David who is he a tree there is
[47:28] something missing here if you can adjust
[47:30] that screen a little bit I don't want
[47:32] people to say brother Steve and say yeah
[47:35] you need to read it yourself the Bible
[47:38] say brother Branham say everybody there
[47:41] just adjust a lot of it so they might be
[47:44] able to see characteristic I don't want
[47:50] any question okay you know you might
[47:53] bring it down probably there might be
[47:55] something that yeah just let's see
[47:57] what's there okay everybody's in there
[47:59] anything is known by each characteristic
[48:04] everybody clear all right brother
[48:07] Branham continues here they can see that
[48:10] service order Finnegan he said now
[48:13] everything that we found can be
[48:16] identified by each characteristic Elijah
[48:20] has to be identified by his
[48:23] characteristic a man matters who is the
[48:28] man
[48:29] we don't know him we don't know his name
[48:31] can you give the description when the
[48:34] gaff the description the men say it is a
[48:37] larger the Fischbach he didn't need the
[48:40] picture he didn't need the video by
[48:45] characteristic he could tell it is a
[48:49] larger profit everybody there now we
[48:54] notice like in animal life you take like
[48:57] in bird life now you take a yellow
[49:00] hammer one is flying and a jaybird
[49:03] they look a whole lot like when you look
[49:09] at girls two bugs flying you can get
[49:13] easily confused between them everybody
[49:17] clear
[49:17] but the characteristics you need to be
[49:23] trained on how to recognize God the Jews
[49:29] were training the Samaritan were trainer
[49:32] but the gentle natural that's why we
[49:36] have a difficulty recognizing a prophet
[49:42] hallelujah but the characteristic of a
[49:45] yellow hammer he flaps his wings and job
[49:48] and then up and down and up and down
[49:51] that's the characteristic if you noticed
[49:55] the j-bird flies more in a beeline you
[50:00] watch the quail
[50:01] when he comes up the bobwhite yah he
[50:04] flies watch the Gambel quail when it
[50:07] comes up you hunters you see there is a
[50:10] difference
[50:11] watch the judge denied and the Wilson
[50:14] snipe the characteristic determine what
[50:18] is everybody well that's why I'm taking
[50:23] my time showing to you what happened in
[50:26] MO horrible will happen in more sunset
[50:30] mantle what happen in this because by
[50:33] the description of the characteristic
[50:36] you gonna come back you want to come
[50:38] down to your own conclusion that truly I
[50:41] believe that brother Branham is Molokai
[50:44] so it's not going to be again mama told
[50:48] me Papa told me the preacher told me I
[50:52] was born in the message but you need to
[50:54] see it for yourself
[50:56] a great ship standing on the
[51:01] mountainside
[51:02] if he has his button the bad part of the
[51:06] rant his wife the other part is great if
[51:09] you didn't know the characteristics of
[51:14] that ship could be a deal see you have
[51:19] to know the characteristic of them to
[51:22] detect what is and what is not
[51:27] who is the Landers to you
[51:30] he was holy man girded with a little bed
[51:35] that Elisha the prophet everybody clear
[51:40] God identify himself by his
[51:43] characteristic even God is identified by
[51:47] Hills characteristic and then the God
[51:51] working also there is a characteristic
[51:54] in a god and a ship that you would have
[51:57] to know the difference in them when you
[52:00] were high because they both dwell high
[52:04] in the mountain are you there he said
[52:07] you have to know the difference but if
[52:10] you notice a god stumble himself as he
[52:13] walk either let you are in your
[52:17] Christian walk you are not stumbling
[52:22] everybody when where a ship city's feet
[52:28] done like this and ship work a God is
[52:32] always stumbling the characteristic of
[52:39] the way he makes his truck you identify
[52:44] your game by the characteristic of what
[52:48] he does and how he acts and what he
[52:52] feels if you are still feeding on
[52:56] pornography you need a changer
[53:02] hallelujah and everything in identify
[53:06] itself by each characteristic and then
[53:10] you jump one and watch what happened you
[53:13] can tell the way to go you can tell by
[53:16] that characteristic of a different
[53:19] animal
[53:21] here is the key everything that is on
[53:25] earth today in the way of spiritual
[53:29] things now we are not in the nature such
[53:33] as the Spirit of God and the spirit of
[53:37] the devil and all the coach and
[53:41] everything that we have today in the
[53:44] world they began in Genesis so if you
[53:51] see a crowd today it should be in the
[53:54] book of Genesis the devil is in the book
[53:58] of Genesis God is in the book of Genesis
[54:01] everything that you see here is already
[54:04] written in the Bible because history
[54:07] repeats itself
[54:11] Genesis means the beginning and all
[54:14] those things yet under another name
[54:21] don't be caught up by the name either
[54:26] when they come in the Bible they meant a
[54:30] man by the name of John the Baptist
[54:34] either the name of John the
[54:38] Baptist was not in his family either he
[54:46] was born the son of Zechariah but the
[54:49] name of John came from the angel of the
[54:51] Lord and when they give the child a name
[54:55] their family say wait a minute
[54:58] where is this name coming from which
[55:01] this man coming from they say no no no
[55:03] just give him the name John that came
[55:06] from the angel so when John begins to
[55:09] grow he begin to express a ministry one
[55:13] inch
[55:14] the ministry everybody knew him who is
[55:17] there that is taking the people and
[55:19] drowning them in order
[55:20] it is John Baptist who Israel over there
[55:24] it's John the Baptist who is preaching
[55:27] over there it's John the Baptist but
[55:30] when the Pharisee sang people from
[55:33] Jerusalem when they came to John the
[55:36] Baptist they already knew his name
[55:40] already knew his father his history
[55:43] another thing and they asked him who are
[55:46] you today that question did it mean that
[55:54] they didn't know his name either the
[55:59] Jews don't look at things like ours
[56:03] the true meaning behind that was who are
[56:08] you in the scripture over here you are
[56:14] doing things that are strange
[56:16] you are talking strange way you came up
[56:20] with a strong sermon you came up with
[56:24] with a strange way of preaching the
[56:27] world we want you to identify yourself
[56:30] in the scripture either Joel never look
[56:37] at them and say I am understood their
[56:40] question are you there in other word the
[56:45] Jews will not cut up under the label
[56:48] they understood that the name can be a
[56:52] different name but you need to see who
[56:55] is very indiscreet today when General
[57:01] John say I am the false crying in the
[57:06] wilderness in other words go up in your
[57:12] Bible go to Isaiah 40 when you read
[57:16] Isaiah for the that is me did you see in
[57:22] the Bible the Pharisees say no no no no
[57:24] no we are asking you your true name
[57:27] we want to see a passport we want to see
[57:29] your ID no they were asking identity
[57:33] don't be caught up in the name Oh John
[57:37] the Baptist John the doctor told about
[57:39] this when Jesus came and they asked him
[57:44] a badge earner Jesus say the man that
[57:47] you call John the brother that you call
[57:51] Colima that's not
[57:53] kolima Daejeon Jeju coach on the help or
[57:58] dr. ko ever his true name is a large of
[58:02] the Prophet brother the name of John the
[58:09] Baptist is not in the Old Testament it's
[58:12] not dead I'm not gonna accept this show
[58:16] me the name of John the Baptist in the
[58:18] Old Testament I know that while brother
[58:24] Branham say yet under another name
[58:29] another for under the first Army might
[58:36] be a terminal the second term he may be
[58:40] shot he may be a big man he might be a
[58:44] white man he might be a black man he
[58:48] might be an Hispanic name don't be
[58:50] caught out by the former don't be caught
[58:54] up by the name look at the anointing
[58:58] behind the lemon it's not you're gonna
[59:03] miss God if not God can pass through you
[59:07] and you miss him because you were caught
[59:10] up by phone you were caught up by the
[59:13] name I don't like that name
[59:15] I don't like that see I don't like the
[59:18] brother I don't like the way Jesus you
[59:20] can miss God are you there yet under
[59:25] another name under another phone but the
[59:29] same spirit that began in Genesis brings
[59:34] it out
[59:36] watch their characteristic then you're
[59:39] going to identify who is working there
[59:41] why in Genesis 18 somebody come down and
[59:46] begin to walk and begin to walk people
[59:50] saw him on the road they say hello he
[59:53] say hello hello hello you three come
[1:00:06] here they say is a you three come here
[1:00:12] the cerebrum these are strangers not
[1:00:17] citizen body you want to entertain
[1:00:20] strangers look beyond stranger this is
[1:00:25] God himself in human flesh other and one
[1:00:33] God enter there he took the back and we
[1:00:37] put into the tent and we begin to
[1:00:39] dissolve form a Jewish man American man
[1:00:56] different neighbor not the Lord Jesus
[1:00:59] Christ but the land brother branham we
[1:01:03] see he's doing this you need to know you
[1:01:15] seek he's an American citizen he is
[1:01:18] brother branham he was born in Kentucky
[1:01:20] go higher than that look at the
[1:01:23] characteristics and when wanna say go
[1:01:26] back to Genesis 18 I am giving you a
[1:01:29] sauna I am turning my back you can miss
[1:01:35] God if you are not showing well
[1:01:37] everybody clear the way we're going I
[1:01:41] don't know if I will finish this I even
[1:01:43] shrank things we found out that the
[1:01:46] spirit of Elijah comes first
[1:01:50] five which is great I'm touching quick
[1:01:53] so we can come back on board he said all
[1:01:57] right remember yet future now he could
[1:02:00] not have been the coming of the earth he
[1:02:02] was delighted his name was John but
[1:02:07] spiritually speaking his Elijah here but
[1:02:12] he comes first comes now Jesus ji j esus

[1:02:50] end of the general this is one of our
[1:02:52] problems and author with losses to the
[1:02:57] Jews now perfect number the profit
[1:03:01] profit profit messenger stone ball in
[1:03:06] the fictional notice this manner
[1:03:09] capitalized by God from the original

[1:03:52] changes them appear he again change the
[1:03:56] name either do you expect him to be
[1:04:00] called a larger or a different name

[1:04:10] they turned a Jew the fifth one Jews
[1:04:14] this one gentle to establish our
[1:04:21] foundation of the spirit of Elijah
[1:04:25] working with the Jetta
[1:04:26] we took the the top of the claw and we
[1:04:33] found that the crew first is a scavenger
[1:04:37] and the crew was living with lower
[1:04:41] eating knowledge food under North
[1:04:45] Ministry but he waited for an
[1:04:47] opportunity to live Noah's Ark when the
[1:04:51] window open when the internet open when
[1:04:55] that believes the Sun crazy internet
[1:04:58] open up the emotion opportunity for the
[1:05:03] crowd to feed on something else which
[1:05:06] was dead rotten bodies and leave the
[1:05:10] message are we there brother branham say
[1:05:13] this he said notice the vultures of
[1:05:18] Jesus belly was also casting out Devils
[1:05:26] so don't think somebody who's living the
[1:05:30] message doesn't have a ministry
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:36] Anointed One on the carcasses living the
[1:05:45] message to the living the message back
[1:05:49] to the Methodist
[1:05:50] living the message back to the world
[1:05:53] dead carcasses is the right they were
[1:05:59] casting out Devils Jesus said so and
[1:06:02] remember they had prophets in those days
[1:06:06] Caiaphas the high priest prophesied how
[1:06:11] many knows that care first professor
[1:06:14] notice the
[1:06:16] mission of the week the anointing words
[1:06:21] from God but he was not a grain of wheat
[1:06:25] are you there as far as the crow is with
[1:06:30] the dog both of them are bird but the
[1:06:34] nature are different hallelujah
[1:06:39] notice the position of the wielding the
[1:06:42] field its water by the same anointing
[1:06:46] why did the Bible say he professor
[1:06:50] because he was high priest that year
[1:06:54] rotten scavenger careful a we agree so
[1:07:01] saving among the will lock the crew was
[1:07:07] selling in the okra flour all this time
[1:07:11] yet he will still a crew everybody there
[1:07:16] but selling among the wheat but the
[1:07:20] spirit was upon him they genuine Holy
[1:07:24] Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God was
[1:07:26] upon him to preach to prophesy to
[1:07:31] foretell it to come to pass and after
[1:07:36] preaching the message after prophesying
[1:07:41] the message after telling four things
[1:07:44] about the message yet he end up the name
[1:07:47] and crucifying the very very candid
[1:07:52] world of the hour everybody brother
[1:07:59] branham the spirit can come out here and
[1:08:02] unknown tieu to do a certain things and
[1:08:05] you do it but that girl maybe was
[1:08:09] changed this is where we trust in the
[1:08:15] message need to wake up
[1:08:17] you can preach the message here but
[1:08:21] what's your heart you can be anointed
[1:08:28] but what is the condition of your heart
[1:08:35] think of it
[1:08:37] Kieffer's professor Judah has that devil
[1:08:41] see the spirit anointed him this rain
[1:08:45] falls on the just and the unjust the
[1:08:49] weeds can rejoice with the wind just
[1:08:53] like normal screeching the grinded of
[1:08:56] where both of them enjoying are there
[1:08:59] but it's what is in the heart Malachi 4
[1:09:08] came to turn the heart there is were you
[1:09:15] intellectual can accept it say oh sure
[1:09:19] that look good I believe that the still
[1:09:22] don't do it no sir and the spirit can
[1:09:26] actually make witness of it and still it
[1:09:29] is not so because it's God show has now
[1:09:35] come from God he can make all the
[1:09:39] impersonation out there but he cannot be
[1:09:43] real
[1:09:45] he's still a crowd to begin with
[1:09:48] he was judah the son of what perdition
[1:09:52] he came from hell he need to go back to
[1:09:56] her yet before going back to hell he is
[1:10:00] going to go through the church health
[1:10:02] ministry cast out never be under the
[1:10:05] ministry and yet crucified the ministry
[1:10:10] you cannot healing you cannot like you
[1:10:13] have you cannot like you receive wisdom
[1:10:16] can out like they are Christian God
[1:10:19] bless you all how are you doing oh let's
[1:10:22] thank you let's we'll be good
[1:10:24] oh god bless you let's bow our heart let
[1:10:27] me go god bless you sister you cannot do
[1:10:30] that and be ever so good at it but that
[1:10:35] government they are says the lawyer
[1:10:39] that's exactly right
[1:10:41] their spirit envy day their real genuine
[1:10:45] through the Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:10:48] that still don't mean you are self it is
[1:10:52] that inside so that never dies it's got
[1:10:57] eternal life he always was eternal I see
[1:11:00] it come from God he goes to God it is
[1:11:04] the soul
[1:11:05] watch the condition of your heart if not
[1:11:10] you're going to miss God now when we
[1:11:14] approach Elijah with the gentle we look
[1:11:17] at the crew in a different angle are
[1:11:21] there because the jente were always
[1:11:24] unclean Jesus look at the syrophoenician
[1:11:28] woman he said it is not good to take the
[1:11:32] meat of the children and give it to dogs
[1:11:36] either so we found out Elijah was
[1:11:40] entertained by clothes but these clothes
[1:11:44] were commanded by God they were bringing
[1:11:48] him bread and lead they were not
[1:11:51] bringing Elijah dead rotten food so the
[1:11:56] nature of this group changes on the
[1:12:01] outside they are gentle on the outside
[1:12:05] they are clothed but they are tied to
[1:12:09] have changed they don't no longer live
[1:12:12] like gentle they begin to eat green food
[1:12:15] either
[1:12:17] if somebody look at the scripture
[1:12:20] superficially brother Branham say you're
[1:12:23] going to come up with a superficial
[1:12:25] understanding are you there
[1:12:28] then brother Branham called them the
[1:12:30] servant of God and they were human
[1:12:33] beings and 1 Peter received a vision to
[1:12:36] go to the house of Cornelius we find out
[1:12:39] that they were all kind of ant
[1:12:41] and there was an unclean bird and one
[1:12:45] decision was translated God told him the
[1:12:49] gentle that you Jews were calling
[1:12:52] uncleanly I am calling them that they
[1:12:55] are not clear they are not unclean but
[1:12:58] they are now clean and brother branham
[1:13:01] explained to us that he was speaking
[1:13:02] about the gentle so that was showing
[1:13:05] right here that there will come a time
[1:13:07] when the Ministry of Elijah will have an
[1:13:11] interaction the spirit of Elijah will
[1:13:15] have a connection not with the Jews but
[1:13:18] with the gentle everybody clear
[1:13:22] that's a recapitulation the first Elijah
[1:13:26] do they second a Jew they herded you
[1:13:29] they fear a Jew but the fourth one
[1:13:32] shota everybody clear now when we look
[1:13:37] after Raja finish the ministry God told
[1:13:41] him go leave Israel either go to the
[1:13:46] shelter
[1:13:48] go to Cerreta and there you will find
[1:13:52] that there is we Roman the widow woman
[1:13:57] was not a Jew she was a gentle brother
[1:14:03] branham how that this lead woman must
[1:14:06] have been of the calibre of Elijah let's
[1:14:13] do a little surgery this woman that call
[1:14:20] her woman is a delta and this is a
[1:14:25] larger medicine illogical that you but
[1:14:31] brother branham say when this term of
[1:14:34] the Ministry of Elijah when discerned
[1:14:37] into this woman larger there interacted
[1:14:42] with this woman helped the same caliber
[1:14:47] they are the same nature
[1:14:53] this is a gentlewoman
[1:14:55] so this a larger must be also a gentle
[1:15:03] slowly because usually your action shows
[1:15:11] what you are your works and again she
[1:15:17] has been chosen to entertain God's
[1:15:20] prophet but random now is underlining
[1:15:24] something he said remember she was in
[1:15:30] other word that Elijah that's going to
[1:15:34] interact with the woman will be a gentle
[1:15:40] not their economy is telling you
[1:15:44] something and the land was burning up
[1:15:47] Israel was under judgment they're going
[1:15:51] to reject the Messiah and they're going
[1:15:53] to be under the curse and then the
[1:15:56] Messiah will go to the gentle and when
[1:15:59] the Messiah goes to the gentle by the
[1:16:01] cross by the two sticks that the human
[1:16:05] head there will be a spirit of Raja also
[1:16:09] going over there no doubt Delhi human
[1:16:16] being of that caliber being over Howard
[1:16:20] she a gentle and a believer you see now
[1:16:25] it was Peter look at God he said I
[1:16:29] cannot eat that it is unclean God said
[1:16:34] there are which you think is unclean
[1:16:37] don't call it no more unclean are you
[1:16:42] there
[1:16:43] so we see that God will not have called
[1:16:46] her if she had not been worthy to learn
[1:16:51] to entertain God's prophet for he would
[1:16:54] never send his prophet to the house the
[1:16:57] walls around
[1:16:59] so when God's
[1:17:01] to Elijah the Prophet that means you are
[1:17:04] I will send you Elijah death when they
[1:17:14] send you Elijah the Prophet it means God
[1:17:18] look at your DNA God examine you God
[1:17:22] chosen you and instead you are worthy to
[1:17:26] entertain Elijah the Prophet in fact
[1:17:33] taking larger the Prophet and I send him
[1:17:37] to you you gonna treat him good you
[1:17:40] going to accept his ministry you can
[1:17:42] accept this world you wanna take on the
[1:17:45] seed of Atlanta oh my god it was not his
[1:17:53] choosing not you it is me sending you
[1:17:57] Elijah the Prophet it was God's choosing
[1:18:01] he was not her bidding him she didn't
[1:18:05] see - she said Elijah come come come no
[1:18:08] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:18:12] for you he was God bidding he had been
[1:18:20] placed by a book the Raven were feeding
[1:18:23] him but he was God command for something
[1:18:25] to take place and God surely went to a
[1:18:29] believer of the sermon nature of what so
[1:18:37] whatever this Elijah is you are on the
[1:18:42] same nature oh my god what are you
[1:18:51] talking about if I brought you a
[1:18:57] Methodist message it would not no effect
[1:19:02] on you because it is not your nature
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:09] you are program for a different message
[1:19:16] speed the right man with the right
[1:19:20] message at the right time in order to
[1:19:23] wake you up
[1:19:29] this is brighter it's Moses thought the
[1:19:33] message of North it would not take away
[1:19:36] if Jesus thought Moses message it would
[1:19:39] take no effect because the predestinated
[1:19:44] cedar are laying them that will only
[1:19:48] only be water by that type of water that
[1:19:54] is given for the silk trade about the
[1:20:01] you our work despite the mental disorder
[1:20:04] you will work but when they sprang and
[1:20:06] larger the Prophet something work you up
[1:20:14] he won't grow any other condition it
[1:20:18] must be the conduct condition to make it
[1:20:21] grow I will send you Elijah death
[1:20:24] prophet why is this important if Elijah
[1:20:32] have the same nature as a woman what is
[1:20:36] that important there is a teaching in
[1:20:40] Leviticus 23 that is called the teaching
[1:20:43] of the word shift
[1:20:46] make sure you baccala are there when you
[1:20:50] have a field and in the field you grow
[1:20:54] you plant train are you there and you
[1:20:59] are wondering your see those plant will
[1:21:03] begin to grow those words will begin to
[1:21:06] grow and come up but there will be one
[1:21:10] plank in the field that grows quicker
[1:21:15] than any other place everyone here
[1:21:20] so that plant will reach maturity
[1:21:24] quicker before the other one are you
[1:21:28] there
[1:21:29] but this plane and this plane
[1:21:35] the same nature same caliber but one
[1:21:45] reach maturity first Aveda when we reach
[1:21:52] maturity first they carry mas and take
[1:21:58] him to the high priest everybody
[1:22:01] following me
[1:22:01] and when the hike will take him the high
[1:22:05] priests will go to the field and begin
[1:22:08] to are we following me the working of a
[1:22:18] multi field means that him him and
[1:22:25] filled the same nature with which the
[1:22:36] maturity the same as him with the
[1:22:41] maturity notice it was the first crown
[1:22:51] of God which God which there had been
[1:22:55] raised from the dead God's first corn of
[1:22:57] wheat by God quickening power God had
[1:23:01] quicken his life raised him up from the
[1:23:03] dead talking about Jesus and he was the
[1:23:06] first fruit of those that slave the
[1:23:08] first fruit he was that she that is why
[1:23:13] they had to work that shift so it was
[1:23:17] the first one that come to maturity and
[1:23:21] he was worth as a memorial of what
[1:23:26] Thanksgiving believing that girl the
[1:23:30] last of them who come who come to work
[1:23:35] to my children why do you come to
[1:23:39] maturity because he
[1:23:41] and larger of the self-nature hallelujah
[1:23:50] he was worth at the day of pinnacles
[1:23:53] that's Jesus Christ when they came a son
[1:23:56] from heaven like a wave that was up at
[1:23:59] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[1:24:01] come are we clear
[1:24:04] and to be well again you know why again
[1:24:11] here he was moved all the Jews everybody
[1:24:18] but to be well again
[1:24:21] all the gentle a leader we realized in
[1:24:28] the last day according they again in the
[1:24:32] day that the Son of Man will be revealed
[1:24:35] well again over the people wanna see
[1:24:40] well because there is a woman on the
[1:24:44] cell nature on the same caliber that
[1:24:47] needed maturity now who is the son of
[1:24:54] man I love brother Branham who is the
[1:24:57] son of man in the beginning was the word
[1:25:00] and the word was with god and the word
[1:25:02] was god and the word was made flesh and
[1:25:05] dwelt among us and if all the teaching
[1:25:09] that we have and confirmation of the
[1:25:11] world by by Word of God by sons by
[1:25:15] wonders we see today that in the Book of
[1:25:19] Luke that was that as we just coded from
[1:25:23] look the 17th chapter intelligence and
[1:25:26] Malachi 4 and the different scriptures
[1:25:34] why different scriptures this just jobs
[1:25:38] were tunnel vision when the same a wave
[1:25:42] sheaf chief is a bundle of which it is
[1:25:54] you
[1:25:55] with with with with all of them and they
[1:25:57] banded them together it's a shift it is
[1:26:00] not one with it is a bundle of scripture
[1:26:08] either that's why rather Branham use
[1:26:12] many Scripture look 1730 Malachi 4
[1:26:19] revelation 10 Zechariah 14 Eliezer in
[1:26:25] the book of Genesis he pulled the
[1:26:27] scripture together and the mayorship of
[1:26:31] his military either John the Baptist was
[1:26:41] prophesied by Isaiah but John the
[1:26:44] Baptist was also prophesied by Malachi
[1:26:47] so it's a scripture here
[1:26:50] that's why Jesus when he was on the road
[1:26:53] to a miles either he begins by Moses and
[1:26:57] show them that he was the word Shiva he
[1:27:01] said Moses a job say Abraham say this
[1:27:05] one say this one this one's Alleluia
[1:27:18] Malachi 4 and the different scripture
[1:27:21] that we are acquainted with that word
[1:27:24] again
[1:27:25] is worth over there people that the damn
[1:27:29] tradition of man is dead and the Son of
[1:27:32] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:27:35] the Holy Spirit
[1:27:36] but among God and is given us life
[1:27:40] hallelujah really as Christ was the
[1:27:44] first one to learn from all the profit
[1:27:48] and so forth although tapped in many
[1:27:50] places
[1:27:51] he was the first fruit of those as well
[1:27:53] with her in the bride indeed filled in
[1:27:59] this woman
[1:28:01] either in the broad coming of Christ not
[1:28:07] the Jews in the broad coming of Christ
[1:28:12] coming out of the church they came out
[1:28:15] of the ADEA they are here in the broad
[1:28:19] field either in the broad coming across
[1:28:24] coming out of the church - I have to be
[1:28:28] there is somebody among this week either
[1:28:33] that is a either there should be a
[1:28:39] shift to be worth the gamble in the last

[1:32:38] do the same thing every true believer is

[1:32:52] love and power and we see the

[1:34:30] member oh please I will send you the
[1:34:35] right order
[1:34:40] let's go to first Kings chapter 17
[1:34:43] brother John am i okay
[1:34:46] I'm not even and a half but let me know
[1:34:52] it's Father's Day
[1:34:53] you gotta let fathers go eat food
[1:35:06] everybody there you there or you tired
[1:35:15] first Kings chapter 17 verse 10 he's
[1:35:21] talking about this woman and so he arose
[1:35:24] and went to zurafa tarifa and when he
[1:35:28] came to the gate of the city behold the
[1:35:31] woman was there gathering of sticks and
[1:35:36] he call her and say bring me appeal a
[1:35:41] leader what it's only a few people a
[1:35:45] little water
[1:35:48] why did he'll ask for water
[1:35:53] why did he ask for order when Eliezer
[1:35:59] met Rebecca worried I asked Rebecca are
[1:36:08] we clear are we clear
[1:36:11] when Jesus met the woman of the world
[1:36:19] what did he ask the woman
[1:36:25] what is it was a and when a large
[1:36:29] approaches this woman he has fought and
[1:36:36] brother branham's told us that in John
[1:36:40] chapter 4 was the
[1:36:43] version of the second pool the first
[1:36:51] Ministry of Elijah is entertaining with
[1:36:54] club bringing him bread and flesh either
[1:37:00] then he moves to a different step of his
[1:37:06] ministry and he begin to approach the
[1:37:09] ministry with the second pool okay bring
[1:37:18] me what water in a vessel that are may
[1:37:22] drink
[1:37:22] let's go to verse 11 and as she was
[1:37:26] going to bring it he called to her and
[1:37:29] say bring me I pray you a morsel of wood
[1:37:33] bread now first of all Elijah guy used
[1:37:39] to brain he was eating bread and flesh
[1:37:43] but when he approached the woman bring
[1:37:46] me water
[1:37:47] the woman wanna move he said bring me
[1:37:50] bread now if you recall when the crew
[1:37:55] were bringing Elijah bread they were
[1:37:58] bringing him bread and meat okay but
[1:38:08] there is a difference brother Branham
[1:38:10] call that a sandwich but there is a
[1:38:18] difference between the savage of Elijah
[1:38:22] and our sandwich the sandwich of a Naja
[1:38:30] has bread and flesh or meat our servants
[1:38:39] have bread lettuce tomatoes - or
[1:38:45] buttermilk because all kind of stuff but
[1:38:51] a larger sandwich is bread
[1:38:55] and in flesh bodies bread I want to save
[1:39:03] you time there was a woman you can write
[1:39:07] it down a self initial woman that
[1:39:11] approaches Jesus Christ and was crying
[1:39:14] son of man son of David son of David and
[1:39:18] Jesus keep working when he says son of
[1:39:22] God Jesus stop because she lined up
[1:39:26] correctly with the scripture and when
[1:39:29] Jesus went around say what do you want
[1:39:32] my daughter is sick I want you to hear
[1:39:37] Jesus said it is not good to take the
[1:39:42] children's bread and give it to the dog
[1:39:48] so Jesus identified they bread as divine
[1:39:54] healing the valley healing was the
[1:39:57] children's bread yet I would not pay
[1:40:05] attention no attention to her he ignore
[1:40:08] him and finally she got in her way and
[1:40:11] could not get around her and he told her
[1:40:14] say I'm not saying to you he always and
[1:40:17] 2-year in your way is nothing but a
[1:40:19] bunch of dogs and I'm now going to take
[1:40:21] the children's bread it's not right for
[1:40:24] me to take the children's bread healing
[1:40:28] to this group and give a gooda the first
[1:40:34] interaction of the spirit of Elijah with
[1:40:39] the gentle it is going to be entertained
[1:40:43] by divine healing everybody there
[1:40:54] because Malachi for say the Sun of
[1:40:58] righteousness he is going to rise up
[1:41:01] wilfer healing
[1:41:05] are you no are you no but the healing is
[1:41:12] couple with me are you there it is the
[1:41:23] first school everybody jesus said except
[1:41:30] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[1:41:38] are you there that's why you notice
[1:41:42] brother branham at the beginning of his
[1:41:46] ministry he was more healing and
[1:41:49] preaching healing and preaching dragon
[1:41:54] meat bread and meat bread and meat the
