[33:46] it's wednesday

[33:48] i don't know how we're going to fly
[33:56] we appreciate the musician god richly
[33:58] bless you
[33:59] can you hear me well
[34:02] okay
[34:04] you need to keep your bible because this
[34:06] thing keeps unfolding
[34:08] i don't know what to do
[34:12] amen
[34:14] genesis chapter 14
[34:17] keep on folding unfolding unfolding
[34:23] somebody must be doing a lot of prayer
[34:27] hallelujah
[34:32] i believe everybody is on board with the
[34:34] sermon
[34:37] hope nobody is behind
[34:39] everybody's on board from sunday
[34:42] okay if you have not listened to sunday
[34:45] you're in trouble
[34:48] amen
[34:50] genesis chapter 15 verse chapter 14
[34:54] verse 18.
[34:55] if you dare you can say amen
[34:58] okay
[34:59] and
[35:00] who
[35:02] i know brother kalim is online so
[35:04] somebody need to preach with me
[35:13] and melchizedek okay that's what i like
[35:17] that one can blast the devil pretty good
[35:20] and melchizedek
[35:22] king of salem
[35:24] you might be seated
[35:29] there is a man
[35:31] called melchizedek
[35:36] melchizedek
[35:39] because in the new testament they use an
[35:41] s instead of a z if you study the word
[35:45] you will understand those things
[35:47] and melchizedek
[35:49] king of selling
[35:52] brought forth bread and wine
[35:55] this man here is a king
[35:59] remember sunday right
[36:02] and as a king he brought bread
[36:07] and wine
[36:10] where did he fund it
[36:13] he brought bread and wine
[36:16] and he was
[36:17] the priest
[36:22] amen
[36:23] amen if they say deep priest how many
[36:26] priests do we have
[36:28] i love this church
[36:31] so it looks like
[36:32] there is only one priest here
[36:35] and he is the priest
[36:38] not a priest but the priest
[36:41] the only one
[36:48] the priest of who
[36:50] the priest of moses
[36:54] the priest of the most high god
[36:58] so god remember we got two tabernacle
[37:01] right
[37:02] we got a tabernacle
[37:04] in heaven
[37:05] which is the true tabernacle the
[37:07] original one
[37:09] or the perfect
[37:11] tabernacle remember the scripture on
[37:13] sunday
[37:14] and we have a tabernacle on the earth
[37:18] and the earth one is
[37:21] too many stories
[37:22] everybody
[37:24] so in heaven
[37:26] we found out on sunday that we had a
[37:28] priesthood
[37:30] which were the seraphim
[37:33] so if we got a priesthood there there
[37:35] must be somebody who's on top of those
[37:37] priesthood
[37:39] everybody
[37:40] and we found now a man called
[37:42] melchizedek who is deep priest in other
[37:45] words the highest order in heaven
[37:49] in the priesthood
[37:51] because there is a priesthood on the
[37:53] earth
[37:54] through moses aaron and then there is a
[37:56] priesthood in heaven so the highest
[37:59] order of the priesthood in heaven his
[38:01] name is melchizedek
[38:04] he is the priest
[38:06] of the most high god
[38:09] so when we look
[38:12] at the scripture just the way we read it
[38:15] it looks like we have god and we have a
[38:18] priest
[38:21] the way we read the scripture
[38:23] here
[38:24] not here yet
[38:26] here it looks like god has a priest
[38:29] and the priest of god
[38:31] is called melchizedek
[38:33] it looks like there is a god and there
[38:35] is a priest that's the way you look
[38:38] if you read the scripture
[38:40] there is a heaven god is in heaven and
[38:43] god has a priesthood in heaven he taught
[38:46] moses to duplicate the priesthood on the
[38:48] earth so in heaven the priest of heaven
[38:51] is called melchizedek he is the priest
[38:54] of the most high it looks like god and
[38:57] melchizedek are different
[38:59] looks like it
[39:03] if this is giving you trouble you let me
[39:05] know i switched to the bazooka
[39:07] everybody here
[39:09] verse 19
[39:10] and he blessed him
[39:13] and said
[39:14] bless be abraham abram of the most high
[39:18] god
[39:19] possessor of heaven and earth
[39:22] so when melchizedek is talking it seems
[39:25] like he's
[39:26] getting messages from somebody or he's a
[39:29] messenger from someone
[39:31] he's talking to abraham like the most
[39:34] high god sent me to bless you
[39:37] that's the way he looks
[39:40] anybody verse 20 and blessed be the most
[39:44] high god
[39:46] oh brother stephen you see it's clear
[39:48] there is abraham there is the most high
[39:51] god and we got melchizedek and
[39:53] melchizedek is blessing abraham and the
[39:55] most high god really
[39:58] you need a prophet
[40:01] and blessed be the most high god
[40:05] which has delivered your enemy into your
[40:08] hand
[40:09] and he abraham gave him tithe of all
[40:14] so the first person that gave that
[40:18] gave path
[40:19] to a heavenly
[40:21] priest amen
[40:24] let me help you up here so the first
[40:27] staff
[40:28] that was given in the scripture was
[40:30] given
[40:31] to a heavenly pastor
[40:39] ever here
[40:40] so normally all of us need to find a
[40:42] pastor
[40:43] and take our task to that pastor
[40:49] because we have not seen anybody giving
[40:51] him tithes yet the first one that gave
[40:53] them tasks is
[40:55] abraham so abraham recognized him as you
[40:58] are my pastor
[41:00] i belong to your church
[41:02] i attend your church
[41:04] and because i attend your church i must
[41:06] bring taft
[41:08] so since i met you pastor he put his
[41:10] hand in his pocket he said here is my
[41:12] thought
[41:14] and he gave taft to a priest of heaven
[41:17] what is a priest of heaven going to do
[41:19] with death
[41:21] do they use path in heaven
[41:23] do they use man in heaven
[41:31] let's go to psalm chapter 110
[41:40] somebody cried the pastor preached on
[41:42] wednesday i'm here
[41:50] oh my god i'm here
[41:53] amen
[41:54] psalm 110 if you dare you can say amen
[41:58] verse 4
[42:00] the lord has sown whose sword
[42:03] who's swearing in the lord the lord has
[42:06] sown
[42:07] and will not repent in other words god
[42:10] talked about took a decree and he won't
[42:12] change it
[42:14] regardless of what happened he saw god
[42:17] will never change this this decision is
[42:19] irrevocable
[42:22] amen
[42:23] the lord soul
[42:24] and will not repent
[42:26] you
[42:28] are
[42:30] a
[42:32] did you see that
[42:34] he didn't say d
[42:36] you are a
[42:38] it seems like god is talking to somebody
[42:42] and he's telling that person you are a
[42:48] so we see
[42:50] this is genesis 14.
[42:55] now we are in psalm 110
[42:59] we find a priest
[43:06] over here depressed
[43:10] so god is telling
[43:12] this man
[43:13] in heaven he say
[43:16] you are a priest forever
[43:23] i thought there is only one priest in
[43:24] heaven
[43:27] right
[43:28] but we found another priest that's going
[43:30] to be pleased forever
[43:32] forever
[43:34] after the order of who
[43:38] when we read that's why brother branham
[43:41] say the problem is our language here
[43:44] we have a problem
[43:45] when they say after the order what does
[43:48] it mean
[43:54] after
[43:56] means
[44:00] like
[44:05] is everybody okay
[44:07] you can't sleep tonight
[44:09] or in the likeness
[44:13] of
[44:16] or
[44:17] resembling
[44:20] everybody here
[44:22] so when they say here you are a priest
[44:25] after the order it doesn't seems like
[44:28] there is another and that priest is
[44:30] following
[44:31] no that priest looked like if you look
[44:34] at him
[44:35] he looked like
[44:37] melchizedek
[44:42] so now the most high god melchizedek a
[44:46] priest that looked like
[44:48] melchizedek going on
[44:51] you are a priest forever
[44:54] after the order of melchizedek everybody
[44:56] clear now
[44:58] let's go to revelation chapter one

[47:54] to redeem means to bring something back
[47:57] to its original position

[50:50] demonic spirit away from this place may
[50:52] you come and speak to us so and bless
[50:55] also those that are streaming in the
[50:57] name of jesus christ
[50:59] amen
[51:00] blessed be the name of the lord we on
[51:02] part three so buckle up and we can take
[51:05] off quickly
[51:07] but here we are still dealing with the
[51:10] priest
[51:12] on sunday
[51:13] we found out and we explained to you
[51:15] clearly that there is two tabernacle
[51:18] there is a tabernacle in heaven and
[51:20] there is a tabernacle on the earth
[51:22] everybody here so far
[51:24] now we found out that in heaven there is
[51:26] only one tabernacle that is there and
[51:29] moses saw that tabernacle and duplicate
[51:32] the tabernacle on the earth so that if
[51:35] you never been in heaven if you go to
[51:37] israel you look at what israel is doing
[51:40] it gives you already a taste of heavenly
[51:42] fleeing but that was not the true
[51:45] original
[51:46] now we found out with the tabernacle on
[51:49] the earth or the dwelling place of god
[51:52] because god wanted to dwell among his
[51:55] people ever clear we found out that we
[51:58] decoded five dwelling place on sunday
[52:02] the first one was made by moses
[52:05] which was the tabernacle in the
[52:07] wilderness about here
[52:09] then we found the transition when david
[52:11] was a king and david say i built many
[52:14] beautiful houses i want to build for the
[52:17] lord something that is better and god
[52:19] told him that david you know what you
[52:21] shed many blood
[52:23] and there is no way you can build me a
[52:25] tabernacle
[52:28] anybody here your son
[52:31] will go and build the temple
[52:33] and the second dwelling place was the
[52:36] temple of salomon anybody clear which
[52:39] was a solid material and back here
[52:42] then from there on we found out that
[52:45] temple was destroyed and then we built
[52:47] it back again then we got to the third
[52:50] tabernacle which was no more a building
[52:54] no more a tent
[52:56] but the tabernacle was a person
[53:00] a human being
[53:02] and this human being right here was
[53:05] called jesus christ because he said
[53:07] destroy this temple and i will build it
[53:09] up again in three days he was talking
[53:11] about the temple of his body this temple
[53:14] have three places this one three places
[53:17] this one three places and we found later
[53:20] on that paul said that the bride also
[53:22] the church
[53:24] is the temple of the lord anybody clear
[53:27] but even though god told david that you
[53:30] shed so many blood
[53:32] you are not qualified to go ahead and
[53:36] build me a temple
[53:37] we found out that there is something
[53:39] strange about david
[53:41] even though he didn't build the temple
[53:44] but david went and built a tabernacle
[53:50] i thought god told him you're not
[53:52] qualified
[53:53] and when david built that tabernacle
[53:56] that tabernacle was in between the
[53:59] tabernacle of moses
[54:00] and the temple of solomon and it was
[54:03] called the tabernacle of david
[54:06] anybody clear
[54:08] because moses was missing something and
[54:11] david pulled the worship of the seraphim
[54:14] on heaven and brought that worship all
[54:16] the way down now god was so happy and
[54:20] the same god that told david don't do it
[54:23] look he said
[54:25] you were right david actually you're a
[54:27] man after my own heart
[54:29] and god even gave a promise he said
[54:31] brother david i will restore your temple
[54:34] back again
[54:36] and we found that the restoration of
[54:38] that temple happened in the brother
[54:43] everybody
[54:44] now when we look at dwelling place of
[54:47] god
[54:48] in every dwelling place that we know in
[54:51] the old testament speaking about the
[54:54] temple or the tabernacle built by moses
[54:57] the tabernacle built by david and the
[54:59] one built by solomon we found out that
[55:02] there are three things that goes with
[55:04] the tabernacle three major things
[55:08] number one the tabernacle each
[55:10] tabernacle
[55:12] or temple
[55:14] had what we call a
[55:16] ministry
[55:19] or a service
[55:21] unto god
[55:23] anybody following me
[55:25] you're slowing my speed
[55:28] i can feel it like this
[55:30] everybody here somebody's pushing the
[55:32] brake
[55:33] i'm trying to move forward amen
[55:35] then there is something else that goes
[55:37] there not only do we have a ministry but
[55:40] we must have ministers
[55:44] of the ministry or servant
[55:48] everybody here
[55:50] this ministry is the priesthood
[55:53] the servants are the priests are
[55:55] delivered
[55:56] everybody
[55:57] and we have also what we call the
[56:00] sacrifice or the gift
[56:04] that goes with the ministry
[56:07] everybody
[56:08] so we found out that when moses
[56:11] established his temple
[56:13] moses has the levitical priesthood with
[56:15] aaron
[56:16] and they were doing the service of the
[56:18] lord and they were offering blood of
[56:21] bulls and gold and calves and everything
[56:24] the same thing we saw on sunday that in
[56:27] the tabernacle of david david also was
[56:30] offering the things we remember on
[56:31] sunday then when we went to the temple
[56:34] of solomon if you search the scripture
[56:36] they were offering they were offering
[56:38] they were given continually in the team
[56:41] in the temple until jesus came they were
[56:44] still offering everybody here so there
[56:47] was a service going on there was a
[56:49] servant working there and there was also
[56:52] a sacrifice that was continually given
[56:55] daily for the sin of the people now when
[56:59] we switch from these natural or
[57:02] imma
[57:03] uh inanimate object
[57:06] because this building have no life
[57:08] they tend to have no life anybody care
[57:11] the life that was in the tent was the
[57:13] life either of the people working or
[57:16] either of the pillar of fire who was
[57:18] residing there anybody here now when we
[57:21] move in the building of human
[57:25] what who are the servants in this
[57:28] building called jesus
[57:31] everybody here jesus was the temple of
[57:34] god we saw it
[57:35] if he is a temple he must have a
[57:38] sacrifice
[57:41] are we okay
[57:42] if he is a temple he must have a servant
[57:46] in his own temple
[57:48] because the servants were working in the
[57:50] temple
[57:51] the sacrifice were offered in the temple
[57:54] and the ministry must be in the temple
[58:01] take second corinthians chapter five
[58:04] i told you i'm gonna lose all the
[58:06] feathers
[58:07] by the word
[58:10] second corinthians chapter five if you
[58:12] dare you can say amen
[58:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:18] oh my
[58:22] you who will who are not in church
[58:26] working make sure you get this
[58:29] before you stay behind on sunday
[58:32] everybody there
[58:33] second corinthians chapter five first
[58:36] one
[58:38] remember there is two temple
[58:41] heavenly temple and water
[58:43] earthly temple we were talking about
[58:45] building hey bark here now we're talking
[58:48] about human as tempo
[58:55] watch more
[58:57] for we know that if our earthly water
[59:01] oh
[59:04] so in human temper there are also
[59:07] temples that are earthly and temple that
[59:11] are also what
[59:13] hallelujah
[59:15] are we
[59:16] am i reading a different bible
[59:19] am i reading a different bible than you
[59:23] keep your seat belt
[59:25] everybody here
[59:29] for we know that if our earthly house
[59:34] paul is calling that a house
[59:37] everybody here so in human tempo
[59:43] anybody care
[59:44] we have an earthly temple
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] everybody here
[59:51] ever here
[59:53] [Laughter]
[59:55] if our earthly house of this water oh so
[1:00:00] it's called also tabernacle
[1:00:04] so not only is it a temple it is also a
[1:00:08] tabernacle
[1:00:10] and paul is calling that also a house
[1:00:13] in other words paul is taking the temple
[1:00:16] of moses the temple of solomon and
[1:00:18] mixing everything together
[1:00:22] everybody
[1:00:23] if our earthly house of disturbance
[1:00:26] could be dissolved
[1:00:28] where dissolved we have a water
[1:00:32] oh what kind of building is that
[1:00:37] so paul is calling this also a building
[1:00:42] so the building now are not the concrete
[1:00:47] the building now are not the tent
[1:00:50] the building now a human being
[1:00:55] so when you see somebody walking you are
[1:00:58] looking at the building walking
[1:01:01] that's why on sunday when the bible says
[1:01:04] that god told um
[1:01:08] david he says that when they were moving
[1:01:11] the tabernacle i was going from one
[1:01:14] place to another the moving off the
[1:01:17] temple was moving god
[1:01:21] everybody here ever here now the temple
[1:01:24] of god are human beings so when you are
[1:01:27] moving the human beings
[1:01:30] you are moving the dwelling place of god
[1:01:34] you are moving the houses of god
[1:01:37] you are moving the buildings of god you
[1:01:40] are moving the tent of god
[1:01:46] oh my god
[1:01:49] we have a building of water
[1:01:53] of god a house not made with water
[1:01:59] did you get something
[1:02:00] did you get something
[1:02:02] on sunday the bible say jesus went into
[1:02:06] a perfect tabernacle not made with what
[1:02:10] that was a dwelling place in heaven
[1:02:13] now
[1:02:14] paul is saying there is also human
[1:02:16] temple they have a earthly one and they
[1:02:20] also have a heavenly one not made also
[1:02:24] with what
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:30] oh my god
[1:02:33] we have a heavenly
[1:02:36] human temple not made with hands made by
[1:02:40] god in balka
[1:02:42] and those temple
[1:02:45] a house
[1:02:46] verse one
[1:02:48] not made with hand camera
[1:02:52] oh my god
[1:02:54] did you read well
[1:02:56] did you read well
[1:02:58] those houses are how
[1:03:04] houses that are eternal in water
[1:03:07] oh my god so we have eternal
[1:03:12] eternal
[1:03:13] no beginning
[1:03:15] no ending
[1:03:16] what kind of house is that one anybody
[1:03:18] here
[1:03:20] verse two for in this
[1:03:22] building
[1:03:24] this temple this house this tent this
[1:03:28] tabernacle in this we grown
[1:03:32] we are comfortable
[1:03:34] everybody here
[1:03:35] earnestly
[1:03:38] desiring
[1:03:40] to be close
[1:03:42] upon
[1:03:46] so not only are these temples habitation
[1:03:50] but they are also clothing
[1:03:56] everybody here
[1:03:57] we are longing to be clothed
[1:04:01] with what
[1:04:02] with our
[1:04:05] our house
[1:04:07] watch your bible
[1:04:08] verse two
[1:04:09] for in this we grown earnestly desire
[1:04:13] it's a burning desire
[1:04:15] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:04:19] is from water
[1:04:21] why do you so desire the house
[1:04:25] why
[1:04:27] because originally speaking you should
[1:04:30] be in the house
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:37] everybody here you should start with the
[1:04:40] house first
[1:04:42] that's why brother branham said we
[1:04:44] bypass
[1:04:46] our people we bypass our houses
[1:04:54] the message is perfectly in line with
[1:04:58] the bible
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:02] when brother branham says that did he

[1:07:14] heavenly human temple
[1:07:17] and the heavenly human temple is eternal
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:25] in other words it's a living temple
[1:07:28] it talks
[1:07:34] everybody
[1:07:35] that's why when you recognize this
[1:07:38] message
[1:07:39] to be eager food

[1:07:57] i am on the surface
[1:07:59] let's go to verse three
[1:08:01] and if if so be
[1:08:04] that being clothed
[1:08:07] we shall not be found water
[1:08:09] do you see what nakedness mean now
[1:08:14] do you see what nakedness means now
[1:08:17] it is not what you're thinking
[1:08:20] when you get before god you must have a
[1:08:22] clothes
[1:08:24] that cloth is original
[1:08:27] because jesus taught the the apostle
[1:08:30] when they were bringing their little
[1:08:31] children for jesus to bless them they
[1:08:33] said no no no no they're deserving the
[1:08:35] master jesus said don't do that you see
[1:08:38] in heaven
[1:08:39] there are certain individuals that look
[1:08:42] like them
[1:08:44] they are standing beholding the face of
[1:08:46] the father
[1:08:48] stop playing with them
[1:08:54] anybody clear
[1:08:55] verse 4 for we that are in this water
[1:09:00] tabernacle do what
[1:09:02] being water
[1:09:04] that's why this home this world is not
[1:09:07] our home
[1:09:11] ever here not that
[1:09:14] not for that we should be unclothed
[1:09:18] but clothes our pawn
[1:09:21] in other words
[1:09:22] we're not talking about removing the
[1:09:24] earthly temple but what we are looking
[1:09:27] for is to take our heavenly temple and
[1:09:31] our earthly temple and fuse them
[1:09:33] together
[1:09:36] so we will be both human
[1:09:40] and god
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:44] hey back here
[1:09:45] so we can eat
[1:09:47] and we can disappear
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:53] remember jesus when he was born
[1:09:56] he could not disappear
[1:09:58] they could chase him and get him there
[1:10:01] but after his resurrection
[1:10:03] when his tabernacle came back
[1:10:06] and pick up his earthly tabernacle and
[1:10:10] fuse them together now jesus can appear
[1:10:13] and he can disappear
[1:10:18] ever here
[1:10:19] now jesus can be standing like this and
[1:10:22] suddenly he can begin to lift up
[1:10:32] when they look at him they say it's a
[1:10:34] ghost he said you don't understand you
[1:10:36] have a hamburger
[1:10:40] the word made flesh i'm actualizing you
[1:10:43] have a hamburger he said give me a
[1:10:44] hamburger he took the hamburger he ate
[1:10:47] he said spirit don't eat
[1:10:49] yet after a while he disappeared again
[1:10:53] why because the two habitation
[1:11:00] everybody here
[1:11:02] ever here
[1:11:03] you can poke him with every knife you
[1:11:06] want
[1:11:07] it won't work anymore
[1:11:12] help me
[1:11:13] hey but here
[1:11:14] being burdened verse 4
[1:11:16] not for that we will be unclothed but
[1:11:19] clove upon that's what
[1:11:22] mortality might be what
[1:11:25] with water
[1:11:28] where is mortality
[1:11:30] in the heavenly temple or the earthly
[1:11:33] the earthly temple have mortality this
[1:11:36] one is eternal so you have eternal life

[1:12:22] means
[1:12:23] oh thank you hui
[1:12:25] has prepared
[1:12:27] he he that has prepared us for the water
[1:12:31] in other words you were programmed for
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:35] you were
[1:12:36] predestinated
[1:12:38] you were prepared for that process
[1:12:41] it's just a matter of time
[1:12:43] and sooner that temple will drop down
[1:12:48] that temple have a
[1:12:51] uh
[1:12:52] he has a countdown

[1:12:56] tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[1:12:59] tick tick tick tick tick is
[1:13:01] going like that in other words it's like
[1:13:03] 60 minutes 59.
[1:13:05] once that clock hit zero
[1:13:09] that habitation just dropped from heaven
[1:13:12] and he knows who he belongs to
[1:13:16] and when you look you say hey this is me
[1:13:19] and he said this is me
[1:13:22] and before you know it you hurt one
[1:13:23] another

[1:13:32] temple
[1:13:33] we have earthly and
[1:13:36] heavenly ever here
[1:13:39] so if the temple
[1:13:41] is human and every temple must have a
[1:13:43] ministry everybody every temple must
[1:13:47] have a sacrifice every temple must have
[1:13:50] a servant and jesus being the temple of
[1:13:53] god
[1:13:55] who is the servant of god
[1:13:58] in the temple of jesus christ
[1:14:02] take matthew chapter 2
[1:14:12] somebody not only is pushing the brake
[1:14:14] but the second brake how do you call it

[1:15:12] two down

[1:15:20] so they saw a young child
[1:15:23] with me with marry his mother
[1:15:26] and fell down
[1:15:28] and worship him
[1:15:29] can you imagine a two years old walking

[1:15:34] down and worshipping him
[1:15:36] you look he said
[1:15:37] what what crazy people are these
[1:15:41] you can worship a stone
[1:15:44] marquis
[1:15:47] when those major came they saw a human
[1:15:51] being
[1:15:53] this is just a job
[1:15:55] the temple of jerusalem was there
[1:16:00] and when they asked that it just dropped

[1:16:07] we are looking for the messiah we have
[1:16:10] seen his star
[1:16:12] and we are coming to the water
[1:16:14] normally they should worship at the
[1:16:16] temple
[1:16:18] he just dropped from heaven
[1:16:21] normally they should go to israel and go
[1:16:24] to the temple to worship jehovah
[1:16:27] but they say we are looking for a human
[1:16:29] being we are looking for a human temple
[1:16:33] we know you have a temple in jerusalem
[1:16:36] but the temple in jerusalem is no more
[1:16:39] working
[1:16:40] the true temple have come
[1:16:42] we're looking for that temple to worship
[1:16:45] god in that temple
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:52] how yummy is this word
[1:16:56] that's why when they saw the human being
[1:16:59] they saw the baby it doesn't matter the
[1:17:02] age

[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:16] it was a transition of temple
[1:17:19] they recognized the true temple they
[1:17:21] came in the temple to worship him

[1:17:54] he fell down and worshipped him
[1:17:57] and when they had opened the water
[1:18:00] they presented to him water
[1:18:03] because you are approaching a temple

[1:19:02] so the offering has a
[1:19:05] revelation amen
[1:19:20] who touched them to get gold
[1:19:25] gold karma and water
[1:19:28] frankincense and water mer speck of
[1:19:31] death we already went through that
[1:19:34] but there is another one called here
[1:19:36] frankie says
[1:19:38] why
[1:19:39] do you bring frankincense
[1:19:44] where did you see that
[1:19:48] oh my god in god's gift always found
[1:19:51] their places brother brother said
[1:19:54] frankie says we want to get this quickly
[1:19:58] frankie says is the water
[1:20:00] the offering of service to her if you
[1:20:04] want to put this scripture down
[1:20:06] leviticus whatever
[1:20:08] and leviticus 16 6 to water
[1:20:11] in other words brother branham is
[1:20:12] telling you
[1:20:14] that frankie says was used in the old
[1:20:17] tabernacle
[1:20:20] everybody
[1:20:21] they were using that for service in the
[1:20:24] old tabernacle about here
[1:20:27] now we are in the new tabernacle we also
[1:20:31] need frankincense
[1:20:36] everybody
[1:20:37] now frankincense
[1:20:39] means offering of sacrifice means
[1:20:42] offering of service to jehovah
[1:20:47] we found out that is the order of the
[1:20:50] priesthood to make an offering to
[1:20:52] jehovah when he made the offering he had
[1:20:55] to be made and mixed with frankincense
[1:20:58] for a sin offering they took different
[1:21:01] things and makes him for the meal
[1:21:03] offering for the wave offering frankie
[1:21:05] says was added
[1:21:07] because he was acceptable to jehovah if
[1:21:11] he was anointed with water which means
[1:21:14] it is a service to jehovah god
[1:21:18] remember a temple goes with the ministry
[1:21:22] or the service
[1:21:25] are you okay now and he goes with the a
[1:21:28] servant
[1:21:29] and he goes with a sacrifice
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:35] and brother branham continues he says
[1:21:38] and now we found that his deity
[1:21:41] gold
[1:21:42] and they brought him frankincense
[1:21:45] was a tap that he was uh
[1:21:48] to who
[1:21:50] so now when we get to human tempo
[1:21:54] about here the temple the
[1:21:58] the the person
[1:22:00] the human itself is a temple
[1:22:05] are we okay
[1:22:06] and the same human
[1:22:08] is not only a temple but his life is a
[1:22:12] service
[1:22:18] anybody here
[1:22:19] and not only is the same human service
[1:22:23] he is himself a servant
[1:22:29] go to matthew chapter 12
[1:22:37] over there he was separated
[1:22:40] you see the building you see the surface
[1:22:42] you see the people when you put it in
[1:22:45] human being
[1:22:46] it's a combo it's like a hamburger
[1:22:49] you have
[1:22:50] tomato you have salad all of them it's
[1:22:52] in one
[1:22:55] so when you say give me a sandwich
[1:22:57] you are asking for tomato for salad for
[1:23:00] whatever everything together that's
[1:23:03] inhuman
[1:23:05] but if you go to walmart you got to buy
[1:23:08] the bread you got to buy the tomato you
[1:23:10] got to buy this and do service
[1:23:18] hallelujah
[1:23:19] go to matthew chapter 12 verse 15. if
[1:23:21] you're there you can say amen
[1:23:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:23:27] you there
[1:23:28] but when jesus knew it
[1:23:30] he withdrew himself from there
[1:23:33] and great multitude follow him
[1:23:35] and he healed them all
[1:23:37] why did he heal them all you will see
[1:23:40] that down the road
[1:23:41] and charge them that they should not
[1:23:43] make him known
[1:23:45] that he might be fulfilled which was
[1:23:48] spoken by who
[1:23:50] isaiah the prophet saying behold my
[1:23:54] who is servant
[1:23:57] oh so you're saying jesus was a servant
[1:24:02] here
[1:24:03] everybody here now
[1:24:04] so the human being
[1:24:07] is himself a temple
[1:24:10] he is himself a service
[1:24:13] and he is himself a servant
[1:24:21] ever here
[1:24:22] hallelujah
[1:24:25] behold my servant
[1:24:27] whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my
[1:24:32] soul is well pleased
[1:24:34] i will put my spirit upon him and he
[1:24:38] shall show judgment to the water
[1:24:41] i thought this for was for the jews
[1:24:47] i thought this was for the jews
[1:24:49] ever here
[1:24:50] watch brother branham here brother
[1:24:52] branham said in saint matthew 12. we
[1:24:55] just read it
[1:24:57] 15-21 we found out that he was jehovah's
[1:25:01] servant
[1:25:04] make sense you saw it now
[1:25:06] behold my servant in whom i'm well
[1:25:09] pleased and he was
[1:25:11] and i put my strength upon him so his
[1:25:14] life
[1:25:15] was anointed with frankincense
[1:25:19] to jehovah's service
[1:25:21] what a gift to them my wise man gave
[1:25:24] see it was something the gift that they
[1:25:27] gave was something to identify
[1:25:30] jesus as jehovah water
[1:25:33] so in human temple
[1:25:36] the human itself is a temple the human
[1:25:40] life itself is a service
[1:25:43] and the human himself is a servant
[1:25:48] so now we have the service we have the
[1:25:51] minister or the servant we are lacking
[1:25:53] the sacrifice
[1:25:58] but here
[1:26:00] you want to know the sacrifice let's go
[1:26:02] to hebrew chapter eight
[1:26:05] the big the book of hebrew now is wide
[1:26:08] open
[1:26:10] at the opening of the seventh seal
[1:26:13] when i hear people saying the seventh
[1:26:14] seal the seventeen you don't have to
[1:26:16] know you don't know what you're talking
[1:26:17] about
[1:26:20] how many been at the mechanic
[1:26:24] have you seen the power tool
[1:26:26] they have big power too and they have
[1:26:29] small one
[1:26:31] so they usually go by the small one you
[1:26:33] will hear them
[1:26:35] and they pull the nut
[1:26:37] and sometimes when they put it you will
[1:26:39] see
[1:26:40] some of the nuts are hard
[1:26:42] to unlock so they have to switch power
[1:26:45] tool they have to get one that look like
[1:26:47] a bazooka
[1:26:48] and once that one comes you will hear
[1:26:51] the noise of a change it doesn't go
[1:26:53] volvo you here
[1:26:56] and no matter how tight the knot is
[1:27:00] that one will open it that's how the
[1:27:02] seals are
[1:27:05] everybody here when you find a scripture
[1:27:08] in the bible that you try to understand
[1:27:11] it's locked you try to understand its
[1:27:14] look take the seals and hook the seal to
[1:27:17] the scripture
[1:27:20] it doesn't matter how long the scripture
[1:27:22] is they still will have decoded the
[1:27:25] scripture
[1:27:27] because at the opening of the seven seal
[1:27:30] the bible became a new book
[1:27:35] so i don't like when people play with
[1:27:37] the seven seals
[1:27:41] if he was not for these seals we could
[1:27:43] be under baptist and the methodist and
[1:27:47] the presbyterian and and the pentecostal
[1:27:51] we will not even have what we have here
[1:27:53] but thank god for the seal
[1:27:56] the sales make the difference
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:09] people pray with the seals
[1:28:12] they thought the seal was information
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:17] the seals are not information
[1:28:20] the seals are revelation
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:27] in other words brother branham say at
[1:28:30] the opening in other words the opening
[1:28:33] of the sevens here
[1:28:34] release a special anointing of god like
[1:28:39] never before
[1:28:43] because the one who breaks the seals is
[1:28:46] who
[1:28:47] in other words they still bring the lamb
[1:28:49] in the place
[1:28:51] and the lamb is the author of the book
[1:28:55] so that's why the lamb can decode
[1:28:58] everything in the scripture
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:07] you don't have to know the seventy
[1:29:08] really
[1:29:09] really
[1:29:10] you don't have to know the seventeen in
[1:29:12] laodicea
[1:29:13] we will be in trouble
[1:29:17] now we can see the enemy from far off
[1:29:20] and we can say we see you
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] hallelujah
[1:29:28] even if the enemy get in the message and
[1:29:32] camouflage himself
[1:29:34] we can detect him
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:29:45] hallelujah
[1:29:46] because in this message we have been
[1:29:49] camouflaged
[1:29:50] on the pulpit
[1:29:52] and on the lady
[1:29:57] how are you going to decode
[1:30:04] hallelujah you need something
[1:30:07] like joy like jehoshaphat
[1:30:11] 400 prophets say something but something
[1:30:13] in you is saying
[1:30:21] you don't know they caught him you don't
[1:30:23] have the scripture but something is
[1:30:26] there is saying
[1:30:29] it is your heavenly tabernacle
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:39] that's why you stood for the message
[1:30:42] without knowing all of this
[1:30:46] and because you stood for the message
[1:30:49] god is unfolding the message
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:30:58] now it's a joy to come to church
[1:31:01] it's a joy to live for christ

[1:33:17] hebrew chapter 8.
[1:33:22] sometimes i can read the message and i
[1:33:25] can hear a legalistic spirit comes
[1:33:28] and give me his
[1:33:30] uh
[1:33:31] his his point of view
[1:33:33] then suddenly
[1:33:35] the holy ghost gives me the answer
[1:33:37] then i keep it and i lock it and i sit
[1:33:39] down and when i talk to people you're
[1:33:41] going to hear somebody speaking exactly
[1:33:43] that and i just pulled the answer and i
[1:33:44] said
[1:33:46] say how do you know all of this
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:54] all right now we have the ministry and
[1:33:57] the service we know the servant
[1:34:00] we know the minister now we need to know
[1:34:02] the sacrifice
[1:34:04] hebrew chapter 8
[1:34:06] let's go to verse 3.
[1:34:09] for every water
[1:34:11] every high priest is ordained or
[1:34:14] appointed
[1:34:16] to offer water and water
[1:34:20] wherefore it is of necessity
[1:34:23] that this man have something also to do
[1:34:26] with them
[1:34:28] clear
[1:34:29] if you are a temple
[1:34:31] you have a ministry
[1:34:33] you have a service
[1:34:34] you must also have something to offer
[1:34:37] what is the sacrifice that you have
[1:34:40] christ
[1:34:41] everybody here
[1:34:44] in the old testament and the moses
[1:34:47] they were offering lambs
[1:34:51] animals back here
[1:34:53] under david they were also offering
[1:34:56] lambs
[1:34:57] an animal
[1:34:58] because it started from the garden of
[1:35:00] eden whenever offered a lamb
[1:35:04] when adam and eve seen god kill a lamb
[1:35:08] america when abraham took isaac to the
[1:35:11] mountain they have to take a ram which
[1:35:14] is a male realm
[1:35:16] here so we got a lamb here we got a lamb
[1:35:19] here in the temple of solomon we got
[1:35:21] lambs
[1:35:23] in the temple of jesus do we have lambs
[1:35:28] one day john the baptist was baptizing
[1:35:31] people
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:33] he put one on the wall they come out he
[1:35:36] put one on the wall they come out and
[1:35:38] suddenly he saw a man walking
[1:35:44] and that man was jesus christ
[1:35:47] when john look he never said hey cousin
[1:35:51] he was under the anointing in his
[1:35:53] ministry
[1:35:55] he said below the lamb
[1:36:01] the lamb of god
[1:36:03] in other words the human temple
[1:36:06] the human being is the temple the life
[1:36:11] is the service
[1:36:13] the human itself is the servant
[1:36:17] and the same human is the sacrifice
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] so you are a temple
[1:36:31] you are a servant
[1:36:33] you are a sacrifice
[1:36:35] and you are also a service
[1:36:45] lord
[1:36:46] when did we see you
[1:36:50] and gave you water when did we see you
[1:36:54] seek and we came to visit you
[1:36:57] when were you in prison and we come to
[1:37:00] see you
[1:37:01] you know those temples that were there
[1:37:03] when you were talking to those temples
[1:37:06] whatever you were doing to this temple
[1:37:09] you were doing that unto me
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:21] go to hebrew 9.
[1:37:24] verse 26
[1:37:26] if you're there you can say amen
[1:37:29] for then must he often have suffered
[1:37:33] since the foundation of the world
[1:37:35] but now once in the end of the world
[1:37:38] he has appeared
[1:37:41] to put away water
[1:37:43] by the sacrifice of what
[1:37:48] can you read it with me
[1:37:50] by the sacrifice of what
[1:37:52] so the temple is the service is the
[1:37:55] servant is also the sacrifice
[1:38:03] hallelujah
[1:38:04] hallelujah
[1:38:06] jump to verse 28 so christ
[1:38:09] was was what
[1:38:12] he's not offering something else he's
[1:38:15] offering
[1:38:16] himself
[1:38:17] was once offered to bear
[1:38:20] the sins of many
[1:38:22] and to them that look for him shall he
[1:38:25] appear the second time without sin to
[1:38:28] water
[1:38:30] the next verse the next chapter is
[1:38:32] hebrew 10
[1:38:33] job to verse five
[1:38:36] you there
[1:38:37] wherefore when he comes into the world
[1:38:41] he says water
[1:38:43] and water
[1:38:44] you will water
[1:38:47] i don't want to deal with this temple
[1:38:48] anymore
[1:38:50] i'm done with human with a man-made
[1:38:52] temple
[1:38:53] now i switch that's why sacrifice an
[1:38:56] offering i don't want it anymore i begin
[1:38:59] to look for
[1:39:00] tempo in a different caliber
[1:39:04] servant in a different caliber
[1:39:06] sacrifice in a different caliber service
[1:39:10] in the different caliber that's why he
[1:39:12] taught the woman everywhere
[1:39:14] behold it's no more in jerusalem it's no
[1:39:17] more in the mountain but the true
[1:39:19] worshiper will worship the father in the
[1:39:23] and in water that's the temple god is
[1:39:26] looking for
[1:39:29] anybody here
[1:39:30] sacrifice an offering you would not in
[1:39:33] other words you desire not anymore
[1:39:36] but a water
[1:39:38] a body of who anymore
[1:39:41] which body does he desire
[1:39:46] so once even are we killing people
[1:39:49] but a body have you what
[1:39:53] prepared me in burnt offerings and
[1:39:56] sacrificed for sin you have had water
[1:40:00] it was just a temporary things
[1:40:05] god was not really looking for that
[1:40:07] he was just a substitute until the
[1:40:10] perfect things come
[1:40:12] now when the perfect things come what
[1:40:14] i'm looking for i'm looking for human
[1:40:16] beings
[1:40:18] i want to get in them
[1:40:22] i want to borrow their body
[1:40:31] hallelujah
[1:40:32] job to verse 10
[1:40:35] by the witch
[1:40:37] will
[1:40:38] we are sanctified everybody seen that
[1:40:42] by the which will we are sanctified
[1:40:46] through the offering
[1:40:49] do you see that
[1:40:50] off the water
[1:40:52] body of who
[1:40:54] was for what
[1:40:57] so when it comes to human being
[1:40:59] the human is the temple
[1:41:02] of god
[1:41:03] he is the tenth of god he is the
[1:41:06] tabernacle of god he is the house of god
[1:41:09] he is the clothing of god
[1:41:12] he is the jacket of god
[1:41:15] he is the service of god he is the
[1:41:19] servant of god and he is the sacrifice
[1:41:22] of god
[1:41:23] that's why you heard brother branham
[1:41:25] saying god have no hands but
[1:41:28] your hand he have no feet back
[1:41:37] everybody here
[1:41:39] so this temple
[1:41:40] we found out it's sacrificed
[1:41:43] we found that it's ministry we found out
[1:41:46] each servant

[1:41:50] does the bride have also a servant
[1:41:55] do we have sacrifice yes do we have
[1:41:58] ministry

[1:42:36] the denomination added stuff the
[1:42:39] catholic added stuff the protestant

[1:43:24] denominational bible
[1:43:26] that was sealed
[1:43:33] they're under confusion
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:38] roman 12
[1:43:40] verse one
[1:43:42] you there
[1:43:43] i'll beset you therefore brethren
[1:43:47] by the mercies of god
[1:43:50] that
[1:43:51] you present here

[1:44:14] brother by the mercies of god
[1:44:17] that you present your water
[1:44:20] a living water
[1:44:23] when it comes to human the body itself
[1:44:26] is a sacrifice
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:31] that's why paul was struggling with the
[1:44:33] hebrew
[1:44:35] because the hebrew wanted to bring
[1:44:37] animals paul keeps saying this is over
[1:44:40] this is over they don't get it they say
[1:44:42] you come to destroy the law of moses
[1:44:45] jesus said i never come to destroy the
[1:44:47] law i came to fulfill the law
[1:44:51] the law was shadow the lamb that you
[1:44:53] were killing was only shadow i am the

[1:45:43] when you keep it pure god is happy he's
[1:45:46] looking at you and he said i can smell
[1:45:49] the good
[1:45:50] order of his sacrifice

[1:45:58] is a service it's bringing perfume
[1:46:02] perfume and god when he smell he say

[1:46:42] and the message will take care of
[1:46:43] everything

[1:46:55] pulpit
[1:46:58] human beings in platform
[1:47:00] that's why we're in trouble

[1:57:03] and if he inhabited the presence of his
[1:57:06] people when you always under a constant

[1:57:44] smell bad
[1:57:46] so when they took it they put it in the
[1:57:48] nile river

[1:58:26] and say ooh beautiful crocodile da da da
[1:58:28] da he keep going
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:36] so when you live a life of service a
[1:58:39] life of perfume a life of worship a life
[1:58:43] of praise you are the you are creating
[1:58:47] an atmosphere
[1:58:50] and when the devil comes
[1:58:52] they just smell
[1:58:54] not this home
[1:58:56] not this home
[1:59:03] in the temple of jesus christ
[1:59:06] in the temple of jesus christ when jesus
[1:59:09] was
[1:59:09] was approaching

[1:59:15] did you hear jesus talking
[1:59:17] what was making the spirit talk

[1:59:24] because he was the temple
[1:59:26] he was the sacrifice he was the service
[1:59:29] and he himself was the priest
[1:59:35] so when he approached the devil says

[2:02:34] you are the servant of god and you are
[2:02:37] the service of god and you are the

[2:03:05] i have i don't know 74
[2:03:08] move over there
[2:03:14] see what it is
[2:03:15] you see what it is
[2:03:17] it's three tabernacles there is two
[2:03:19] tabernacles one in heaven
[2:03:21] one on the earth
[2:03:23] there is a man called melchizedek
[2:03:24] christian king he wants also his
[2:03:27] children to be just like him priest and
[2:03:29] king he opened up the way the tabernacle
[2:03:32] got a ministry he got a servant and he
[2:03:35] have a sacrifice it happened to every
[2:03:37] tabernacle and as an individual you are
[2:03:40] the temple of god you are the houses of
[2:03:43] god you are the tabernacle of god you
[2:03:46] are the building of god
[2:03:50] and let's finish with this
[2:03:53] second coat
[2:03:56] two or three witnesses let's get two
[2:03:58] now if we could only do that
[2:04:01] to identify our lives
[2:04:04] see our lives to be identified as
[2:04:08] jehovah's that is what frankincense was
[2:04:11] for
[2:04:13] that made him jehovah
[2:04:15] servant
[2:04:17] when you realize
[2:04:19] what are you doing here
[2:04:21] where did we come from or what business
[2:04:25] we got being here
[2:04:27] we was not put here just by chance
[2:04:30] we were put here for uh
[2:04:33] and we must serve that
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:40] but still we are back on the basis of
[2:04:44] free moral agency where we can serve it
[2:04:47] or
[2:04:50] just like adam did in there
[2:04:53] but we know the free moral agency is a
[2:04:55] trap for the serpent seed
[2:04:58] not for the children of god
[2:05:00] because god put in you the love of the
[2:05:03] truth
[2:05:05] that even if you don't feel like it but
[2:05:07] something is sucking that up
[2:05:10] [Applause]
[2:05:17] living sacrifice
[2:05:19] acceptable to god which is a reasonable
[2:05:22] service
[2:05:23] let our life
[2:05:25] let's our home
[2:05:26] let our children
[2:05:28] let our houses
[2:05:29] be the temples of god
[2:05:37] amen and we and the more deeper we get
[2:05:40] you will understand why brother branham
[2:05:42] say the beauty of a church is the
[2:05:46] you will understand why brother random
[2:05:48] say that
[2:05:52] you see
[2:05:53] brother branham also was moving from the
[2:05:56] natural building into human being
[2:06:00] because that was the true temple
[2:06:03] that's where god wanted to be worshiped
[2:06:05] in spirit and truth it's human lives
[2:06:09] because at the beginning he was elohim
[2:06:14] he existed by he didn't like it he was
[2:06:17] boring
[2:06:19] then he wanted to be god god means a an
[2:06:24] object of what
[2:06:25] he loves to be worship
[2:06:28] and he created you and me so he can have
[2:06:31] a family and be
[2:06:33] worshipped
[2:06:35] and when you leave your life you cooking
[2:06:38] you are worshiping him
[2:06:41] amen
[2:06:43] you you you changing a diaper you
[2:06:45] worshipping him because you're taking
[2:06:47] care of his child
[2:06:49] when you're doing your duty
[2:06:51] responsibility it's a worship
[2:06:55] amen
[2:06:56] amen you don't understand what i'm
[2:06:58] saying
[2:06:59] if god say husband take care of your
[2:07:01] home when you take care of your home
[2:07:03] it's a worship.
[2:07:05] [Applause]
[2:07:08] it's a worship
[2:07:10] that's why you heard brother branham say
[2:07:11] when a woman serve a husband is serving
[2:07:13] god because what you're doing is a
[2:07:15] worshiper
[2:07:20] it's a worship
[2:07:23] it's a worship
[2:07:28] you give offering it's a worship
[2:07:31] you don't give it to the church it's a
[2:07:33] worship
[2:07:34] that's why brother branham say offering
[2:07:36] is a part of
[2:07:38] worship so when you're taking five
[2:07:40] dollars you're putting that just doing
[2:07:42] that you are worshipping
[2:07:49] you cleaning the bathroom
[2:07:54] you didn't hear him
[2:07:56] i put a quote here when brother branham
[2:07:57] said when god was birthing you some of
[2:07:59] you were birthed to be mothers and
[2:08:01] things like that
[2:08:03] it's a worship
[2:08:05] when you living for the very purpose he
[2:08:08] sends you here you are actually
[2:08:10] reflecting him
[2:08:12] you are actually reflecting his mind
[2:08:15] in other words if god wanted you to be a
[2:08:18] doctor when you become a doctor you are
[2:08:20] reflecting his mind
[2:08:28] it doesn't mean only oh hallelujah oh
[2:08:31] glory to god you're the jehovah you
[2:08:33] jehovah you
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:40] it's a normal living
[2:08:42] by you doing that like unto them
[2:08:46] and jesus that's why you heard paul
[2:08:48] saying that even when you at work
[2:08:51] you render service to those people to
[2:08:54] that company like you doing that unto
[2:08:57] them
[2:09:01] so when you're going to work it's air
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:06] i know this is checking everything

[2:09:44] the boss
[2:09:45] but when you understand that i'm doing
[2:09:47] this as unto the lord that's why we
[2:09:50] honestly work we honor we want to be
[2:09:53] doing things what you are doing that

[2:10:13] and that's why an anointing can come on
