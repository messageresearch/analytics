where jesus died be identified to be really justified look to the place where jesus dies what a work of grace [Music] what a work of grace that a man can clearly see the lamb with seven horns and seven eyes when darkness covers the earth death begins to strike in the place where the blood has not been applied so tell me what to you of the opening of the seals opening of those sieves god's provided way for you is it sufficient then don't add or take away [Music] it's god's provided way to save you winded or just be identified with your sacrifice to be really justified look to the place

once a year so do the best that you can and be there the service will start at eight o'clock up to midnight amen so a lot of singing preaching and even those mysterious new preachers you will hear them from the first time amen everybody can hear me okay we okay okay i don't want to bless somebody easy let's go to the book of luke how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay yeah i'm disappointed if somebody's behind especially those that stay at home and don't can't even stream you can preach two weeks and they can't even stream they're still behind they can't catch up with the streaming something is wrong amen i'm sorry i'm not going to fool you i don't have time for that i'm going to tell you the truth you can make time for everything else you got to make time for the lord amen [Music] a touch on this years ago and that was my first sermon and i touched it up and could not finish it it was the first time i was in the pulpit and it seems like the lord brought it back here and we're going to put it together with the high priest amen so you stay really tight because you will travel some different avenues there is a lot to deliver so give me some grace amen let's go to the book of luke chapter 10. i still can i'm hearing that rebounding brother uh michael he's here by the mike bailey he's here somewhere okay would you check yeah amen that's a little bit better now you just need a little tweak to get them to the bazooka level luke chapter 10 uh-huh you're getting pretty close just touch it up a little bit at the beginning i didn't hear those stuff now i became very sensitive yeah it's a lot of it work with it a little bit brother mike if you can touch up a little bit luke chapter 10 if you're there you can say amen the devil is wasting his time verse 30 and jesus answering say a certain man went down from jerusalem do you know that man you might be seated that's why you need a a prophet there is a man the bible says certain man we don't know who that man is there is a bible within this bible [Music] you see this bible there is a bible within the bible so you can read but you don't see the bible but it's in the bible and for you to see that bible you need a prophet only a prophet can pull the bible out amen the old testament was there everybody was holding the old testament and reading the same scripture over and over until paul came in and paul entered to the old testament and begin to extend the bible in other words stretch the bible then the bible is now the old testament and the new testament but still there were some [Music] amen only a prophet can get there and pull it out if not the letter will kill you go read the old testament go under the levitical law you will see their color the color of the high priest and their dressing we're going to go through all of them except jesus come we're going to go through all of them the clothing of the high priest go check the catholic church look at what they're wearing look at that do you think they're doing that just by right now [Music] it's coming from the old testament but they missed the point [Music] hallelujah jesus answering say a certain man went down from jerusalem this man was not going up everybody he was going down so if you're going down that means you were in a high position and you begin to drop down to a lower position so this man is going down everybody from where from jerusalem why jerusalem where is he going a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho so this right here is telling you that jerusalem should be up amen and jericho should be down and this man begin to travel from a highest point but as he's moving he's dropping down amen come on and fell among thieves so in this road between jerusalem to jericho this rome here this road is infested with thieves not one but many we okay now just relax amen and the thief did what the thief which strip him of his remnant in other words this man has a clothe he was not naked when he left jerusalem he has a clothe and he begin his journey but as he continued on his journey he was not going up he was going down and back here then a few of a bunch of thieves cut him and the first thing they did they strip off his clothes so the first action of a thief was to remove or to strip his clothes how many clothing did they say how many women how many women one rainman anybody here okay yeah amen come on and wounded him so the second thing that wounded him so when these thieves met him anybody here they didn't wound him right away first they took the clothing off of him amen are you following me and then the same thief not a different faith the same one amen change they changed their action everybody here at the beginning they just took a jacket off but the man is still there then on the second level they begin to wound him in other words what was only taken off of the garment now it's a physical [Music] they are wounding somebody physically at the beginning they just took the garment off somebody can take your garment off and you can run away there was a man that was following jesus christ they took a garment off and he ran away naked the bible says that america but they didn't stop the number one they removed the raymond as soon as they removed the remnant then they flipped to the second thing they begin to catch the man in the physical [Music] wounded man amen what a road camera and departed leaving him half dead back here when they wounded him the third thing that happened to this man he was left half dead what does half dead mean he was not quite totally dead hey when they say half are we okay am i reading a different bubble are you sleeping so if you take a hole there we and you divide it in half everybody here part of this is already dead anybody here and there is a part that is still alive that's why they say half dead oh boy it is not me to the message amen verse 31 and by chance he was he really by chance and by chance there came down a certain man that way who came why not a regular man why not a normal man maybe a farmer maybe uh a businessman was traveling but the one who's telling the story is jesus christ amen and when jesus is talking about the story he put the priest there so in this road there is a priest that is also traveling let me call him a anybody here a priest that way because when you see a priest and somebody's wounded what do you expect what do you expect so help him we okay help him help him through a priest so maybe that man when he saw the priest because you can tell a priest from pharaoh when we're going to get into the clothing of the high priest and the priest you will understand that when you look at the priest from far off you can tell oh that's a pastor coming up there because there was a certain way the priest dressed that you can tell from pharaoh so when that man was in agony right there when he looked he saw the priest he said oh thank you jesus thank you jesus for sending me a priest praise the lord and now i'm rescued [Music] and when he saw him the priesthood he passed by on the other side [Music] it was help when the priest saw it [Music] that behavior you will expect it for a neighbor you will expect it from a businessman you will expect that from maybe a farmer but that behavior came from a priest let's go to verse 32. that's why i told you i need time verse 32 and likewise and water oh what is the difference between the two elevate who was responsible for the temple so when you see a lever coming up what do you expect see how we can close here and you go home you already got it amen and like was a leaver when he was at the place came and look on him the first one saw and went away the other one approaches a little bit closer to at least look so when the man saw him getting closer to him he said oh at least this one is merciful then he approaches but when he looked let's see he came and looked on him come on and pass by on the other side behave just like the priest so it's done if it was a man that was drinking smoking that did this we will understand we say you know what that's a smoker forget about it he's not going to help anybody that meant he's always in a nightclub he's not going to help anybody that man is always a bad man we know him the whole neighborhood know him but this is a priest and this is a leavert where we expect to have help but there was no help anybody here verse 33 but you know when they say but means something is going to be contrary to what you saw right but a certain samaritan do we know him a certain man we don't know him his identity is sealed and a certain samaritan everybody care do we know him so his identity also is sealed this identity and this one both contain certain certain we don't know them but this we can tell who they are okay this one we even know that he's a samaritan this one do we know if he's a jew do we know if he's a samaritan do we know if he is uh hidden or agenda but a certain samaritan as he journey anybody so this man when he was journeying there was also a samaritan that was journey back here the samaritan was journeying while this man also was journeying anybody here as he journey came where he was the third one so when the men turn he says samaritan he said well the priest left me here delivered left me here this one it's american again do you know the woman at the well when he met jesus christ just to give somebody water he said you a jew me a samaritan we don't deal together just water now think about helping a man [Music] everybody here if the priest could not do it if the levite was unable to help how much more a water if they went to the other the samaritan won't even get closer he will even turn around and go back home amen why did jesus put a samaritan there [Music] because a levert is a jew a priest is a jew and jesus left the jews and went into the samaritan and took a samaritan and put him in uh an allegory of a man better than the jews and not only better than the jews but better than the spiritual leaders of israel better than a priest better than delivered the chosen generation of israel that man is better than them who is that man you know his name can you help me no brother in jail [Laughter] amen but a certain samaritan as he journey came where he was and when he saw him amen he had water what is compassion the key of this samaritan is compassion amen compassion amen he had compassion on him and went to him amen and burned him up and burned up his water the first thing the samaritan he began to take care of his wounds and he was banding them up banding up of her wounds everybody here karma pouring in water and water [Music] is he clicking something ever here so before he burn this samaritan have oil and wine you read your bible do you really read your bible if you read your bible you will understand [Music] he was pouring oil and wine not oily only not wine only but oil and wine so when this man was traveling he was having oil and wine and when he went to him and burned his wound pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own water so this man has a beast i don't know if we will call this part one or what this man has his own beast do you follow me you have to understand this so when he was traveling the man was using his beast and back here and keep singing a samaritan and keep going maybe he was talking about jacob because their father was jacob and he kept moving moving moving but when he saw the samaritan ah the wounded man he left his beast do you follow me after taking care of the man he took the man and the one who was riding the beast now was not him ever hear the one who was one who was riding the beast was now the one who was wounded he became the driver [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ever here this man when he was traveling he was using his feet but here maybe he get tired but at this time his feet don't work anymore his human effort were no longer needed for the journey but here they put him in the car and they put him a new chore [Applause] and they told him just hang on to the beast that's all you have to do i know the road then the man begin to take him ever here he was the good samaritan that begin to lead him where he wanted to take him amen because the man was broken he needed a different gps a back here and went to him and burned him with his wound pouring in oil and won and set him in his own beast camera and brought him to a water brought him to an inn you know jesus was looking for a name to get born and there was no place in and took care of him so when he took him to the inn this same samaritan took care of him so all of this is an experience do you follow me an experience between the unknown man and the unknown samaritan anybody here and if you get closer to an inn what time is it did i say it did i say it did i say it so it was probably evening time everybody here and all of this happened on the same day [Music] and back here on the same day he took the man banned him poor oil and won and took him all the way to the inn and got there and sat with him all of this is an experience on one day everybody here recognizing your day amen maybe here verse 35 and on under another day okay not the day that they were doing the work that he put him on a beast that he banned him he took him that was yesterday now it's a moral it's another day everybody here what happened in another day in another day i need a longer board amen in another day amen and on the morrow when he departed this man departed when he departed he took out two passes so there is a leaving of this man a going away but before he were left he left two pences pence's armani right two pence's amen and gave them to the who do you know the host so there is a host here this inn have a host host amen and give it to the host and say to him take care of him so the money the samaritan headed he traveled with it amen the samaritan never took the money and gave it to the man that was wounded anybody here the money cannot go directly to the man amen back here the money have to go to the host everybody the host of that in everybody then the host of that inn will deliver the money to you it is your money to take care of you but it doesn't go to you it goes through a host and the host take the money and give it to you hallelujah and give them to the host and say to him take care of him if i ask all of you how much money did they give the host two pence if you go ask a denomination how much money do they give to the host they will give you the answer what if they know their bible two pence everybody knows about it if you ask even a catholic presbyterian how much money if they open the bible they will tell you two pence everybody can give you that number but there is a different number you ready now okay all right and he said to him take care of him and whatsoever you spend how much is that one there is a known money and there is an unknown money anybody guy this one this one nobody knows it anybody here and whatsoever you spend more if this host spend more he's spending more from which money his own money but it's not his own money okay amen whatsoever you spend more when i do water so this man will come back again amen this samaritan will come again [Music] but when he is coming again he is not going to see that man sick he wanna see that man perfectly restored [Music] and the restoration need to be taken care by the host [Music] one script one one small story like this everybody here and i when i come again i will repair you amen which now of these three thank you was a neighbor to him that fell among the thieves and he said he that show with what so all this man was doing he was showing mercy amen that show mercy on on him then say jesus to him go and do likewise in other words you can be a good samaritan there is a good samaritan but this ministry here can be put on you and you can do it because god will never ask you to do something that you cannot do [Music] we okay let's go to john chapter 12. just the reading of the scripture he makes it all good amen john chapter 12 verse 1. you stay up stay tight because it's a different avenue if you're there you can say amen we already understand the missed generation the generation of melchizedek amen the lineage is nothing among the human being and the lineage of his broad also is not among human beings amen john chapter 12 verse 1 then six days before the passover so the passover was on which day did i write the bible i'm just reading it and six days before the passover meaning the passover was on the seventh day amen came to bethany where lazarus then jesus six day before the passover came to bethany when lazarus was which has been dead whom he raised from the dead power of resurrection there they made him a supper and marta served it's a whole message there but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him the resurrected was now sitting on the table that's a different story let's leave it alone verse three then took mary a pound of ointment of sparcanard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the order of the ointment then say one of this his disciple who his name was who judas iscariot salmon son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three pants 300 pence and given to the water you see sometimes somebody does something for someone and somebody say no we should not have wasted that money like that we should use this money for this this and it sounds good when they give the idea the idea usually sounds good but the motive behind it is not really what they're saying they just don't want you to spend that money for brother hamilton amen hallelujah why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor verse 6 this he said not that he cared for the poor this one nobody can see it only god that's right no no no no no brother we don't have to spend this money it's not good but really in the heart that's not what they're trying to do here but because he was a judas was whoa who was who you have not caught it yet who attacked this man from jerusalem now you got it who attacked this man from jerusalem so this spirit anybody here here in one man over there in many men by the same spirit amen so the spirit here can come over here [Music] anybody here because he was a thief and had the bag and bar what was put there in then said jesus let her alone leave her alone why can't jesus tell somebody leave her alone because he knew that was not true you really don't care about the poor you just don't want her to serve me anybody care later her own against the day of my bearing had she kept this for the poor always you have with you but me you have not always that's a scripture from the old testament let's go to the last and then we can pray revelation chapter three i believe now you got the background and when we travel you know what's coming up revelation chapter 3 amen verse 1 oh my god you need to stay with your head in the word in the message in the scripture you're reading the message the scripture then things will be easier for you brother branham say put your head in the word if you need that coach you see me because some people are he's talking that's what the prophet said uh revelation 3 verse 1 and to the angel of the church of sardis you know who the messenger was luther to help you up some of you to the angel of the church in sardis right these things say he that has the seven spirits of god we already went through this and the seven stars you already know this i know your works that you have a name that you live and our water this man is alive but he's dead this church is uh somebody's getting it it's alive and dead back here now it's a church right amen verse three verse two be watchful and strengthen the things which remain anybody care data ready to do what so there is a portion in this church that is already dead [Music] and there is a portion that is alive strengthen what is remaining alive it's ready to amen strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found your works what perfection cannot come here the law could not bring anything to perfection are you seeing the sermon coming up right here for i have not found your words perfect before god everybody now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord thank you for giving us another opportunity and time to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord like we always repeat and we will continue to repeat because we understand that our sufficiency is not our own our sufficiency is coming from thee father we have done everything that we can do if you have given a man an ability to read the scripture that's all he can do but when he comes to interpret the scripture and to unfold the word and to give a personal relation revelation to your children only you the holy spirit can do it lord father that's why we asking that you move us completely out of the way may you come again and speak to your children lord father remember those that are streaming online lord i can see some from different countries father may you bless them and may lord father you be the one speaking and not me because there is nothing in a human being that he can help another human being because we are all dependent from thee we committed all and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all right my subject is the high priest in the good samaritan america the high priest because we found out who our high priestess we know that we have a high priest under the order of melchizedek and the high priest is the lord jesus christ but we want to see our high priest in the good samaritan everybody in other words when you leave this church when you read the good samaritan you're not going to see the good samaritan anymore you will see somebody in the good samaritan hey but here we have been dealing with the mystery of the level and this goes together with the mystery of the level i could call it part eight or something but the reason why i'm doing this so it's gonna be easier for you down the road if you want to go through a reference you can go back and find it quickly but here when we talk about this we found about that the level is something that is connected together with the priesthood here you can remember the oldest sermon amen and once you farm that priesthood it will help you to understand a lot of stuff now when we were in hebrew chapter 7 we unfolded with melchizedek the bible says in hebrews 7 verse 5 and verily they that are the sons of liver who receive the office of the priesthood right here we can see that paul is calling the priesthood in office hey berkey i want you to follow me carefully keep your seatbelt in hey he said they that are the son of liver who received the office of the priesthood so the priesthood has an office here have a commandment to take that of the people according to the law that is of their brethren in other words when god chose israel as a nation everybody in israel were brothers and sisters anybody care they were present together anybody care and out of that chunk of brethren everybody god selected a certain tribe did you follow me and pulled that tribe and that tribe was the tribe of liver and that tribe was given the charge to take the third from their own brother amen so from the beginning all of them are the same anybody here all of them were brothers but there was one brother that god picked and put him a little bit higher than the other brother i have to go this way amen the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they came out of the launch of who in other words when we look naturally speaking because there is two seeds of abraham we have the natural seed of abraham you remember and we also have the spiritual seed of abraham so when we are dealing with the natural seed of abraham in that seed everybody was brother but among those brethren there was a selected group of brethren that was taken up and given the office of the priesthood everybody and when they get the office of the priesthood they were responsible for the spiritual aspect of the entire nation and back here and if you want to give your taving you're not going to give your taving to like abraham did you god give your diving to those brothers [Music] hallelujah the bible continued he says verse 6 but he you remember this last sunday whose descent is not counted from them receive type of abraham and bless him the head the water if you can allow me i believe you already got this together so we found here that there is two lineage hey mark here the first lineage is the natural lineage of of abraham we already talked about it a lot we have abraham with the natural lineage and back here and we have which goes through isaac we already explained this over and over then we have the spiritual lineage of abraham and the spiritual lineage goes through melchizedek hey mark here no problem so the bible say he whose descent is not content from them receive god from abraham and bless him the head promise every year so if the natural seed everybody is brother everybody here and one of the brother has been chosen and elevated above the brother to receive darting we must see the same thing in the spiritual brother uh give me a little bit more let's go to hebrew chapter 1 blessed be the name of the lord i hope you were not caught up in christmas stuff that cool you down because we spoke about christmas last sunday we touch up again just reminding you so if you do what you're doing you're responsible not me everybody care a preacher gave you the whole counsel of god if you understand that praise god if you don't i will continue to pray to plead so the lord give you a revelation and you understand that it's wrong anybody care let's go to hebrew chapter one verse eight if you dare you can say amen thank you brother caleb but to the son we understand this son he says your throne oh god a son is god because a son a child will be born his name will be counselor prince of peace and what that son is a mighty god how many god do we have he oh israel the lord your god is your throne oh god is forever this son is god amen it's forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom you have love righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god god is talking to the son but he's telling him god everybody care therefore god even your god you see why you need a prophet who is god it looks like two people are talking and one is saying god god is talking to you god and god talking anybody here therefore god even your god everybody ready has done what anointed you with the oil of gladness above your water back here so in the spiritual aspect there is a sun in the natural there is a son isaac everybody among those children a tribe was picked above the brother and in the spiritual we find a son but this son has his fellow anybody but his anointing is above his fellow are we okay now go to hebrew chapter two jump to verse eleven are you there the second chapter for both he that sanctifies everybody and they who are sanctified [Music] to help you both jesus christ and you did you hear me both god and you everybody he that sanctifies god the lord jesus christ and the one who is sanctified is you everybody here birth he does sanctify god and they who are sanctified you everybody here they are all water [Music] anybody here that's why you heard paul say let this mind that was in christ be also in you everybody and the man that was in christ was that jesus felt like him and god are the same and god wants you to think the same way because both him and you you are one the husband and the wife are one [Music] everybody here they are one ever here for deal for which cause he is not a shame you watching your scripture to call them water but here the sons of liver are you following me was pulling that from their brethren yet they were brothers in the spiritual we also have a brother amen amen but that brother is our god he is a husband he is a high priest he is a savior he is a redeemer he is everything to us [Applause] he's just anointed a little bit above us so we can pay him our taxes ever here ever here verse 12 saying i will declare your name to my in the midst of the water will i sing again your water so the church of the living god the body is the brother of this man [Music] we okay according to the natural seed there is a brother that is taken above the brother to receive tavern in the spiritual seed there is also a brother that is pulled above the brother [Music] blessed be the name of the lord everybody but he whose descent is not counted from them receive ties of abraham and bless him that had the promises and as i may say so leave her also who received have paid that in who [Music] abraham [Music] begot isaac do you see leave her there liv isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the third son which was liver everybody here but when abraham meet mercy zedek do you follow me instead of mercy zedek looking for isaac because as it was the direct son of abraham melchizedek when you meet him he doesn't go with the natural image do you follow me when you meet a jew the jew will go with your trouble paul from the tribe of benjamin a pharisee of the pharisee that's how it is when you reach melchizedek merchandise doesn't go by the natural image melchizedek work with predestination [Applause] do you follow me if you give mercy zedek is so and jacob here naturally speaking everybody clear everybody will give their birth right to esau because his son was born first but when he come to melchizedek when you give him his soul and jacob mercury said before they were born before they were conceived in the womb of the mother i love jacob and i hated his soul his son was not even born here so when abraham begin to pay tax to mercy merchandise searched the launch of abraham and took that target and said the one who paid have is river not isaac not jacob anybody here are you okay verse 10 for he was yet in the launch of who was abraham the father of liver who was the father of liver how is he abraham now is the father of liver we okay now when you're handling melchizedek when you talk when you open the book of melchizedek do you follow me liver is a child of abraham jacob is a child of abraham isaac is a child of abraham you follow me when you go to the natural book of the lineage the son of abraham is isaac liver is a great great great son of abraham that's the natural seed but the spiritual seed all of this together but here they are children of abraham in the spiritual when you ask isaac who is your father abraham if you ask jacob who is your father abraham if you ask any jew who is your father the book of the generation of jesus christ is starred by who amen let's look at something here if it's going to help you in first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14 the bible said i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved who so paul have children amen you can verify in your bible anybody care they're not your father of liver is jacob right back here but in the spiritual liver is not the child of jacob hallelujah i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you was paul married was paul married where did paul get children why did paul get children paul was not married but paul is saying my sons who gave you where is your wife you okay hallelujah for though you have ten thousand instructor in christ yet i have yet have ye not many water for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the water ever here paul said that i give birth to you by the gospel everybody here so when they ask you who is your father paul but truly paul is not your father who is your father jacob that truly jacob is not your father your father is abraham [Music] hallelujah for this course have i sent unto you team of thieves who is my water how did you perfect man through the gospel it's a pregnancy by the gospel it is not a pregnancy naturally it's a pregnancy by the gospel [Music] but here in galatians 4 verse 19 paul say my leader children paul was not married where did he get children my little children of whom i did water traveling water oh so pain was it so power went to the delivery home [Applause] you see the bible you see the bible so paul went to the delivery room and paul said i was traveling in birth just like a mother is is traveling to give birth paul also travel ever here because the launch of abraham not the loss of sarah the launch of abraham her deliver not sarah abraham [Music] my little children of whom i travel in birth again until who be what ever here my god where are we going first timothy chapter one unto timothy my own water in water you okay now my own son in the faith this is the correct multiplication not by sex this is a breath by the spoken word everybody here he said grace mercy and peace from who our what i thought paul was the father [Music] paul is saying i'm your father but our father is god liver i am your father jacob but our father is abraham hallelujah this church i committed unto this son timothy second timothy to timothy my dearly beloved son grace and mercy peace from whom god the water he is your father but he's not really your father anybody i beseech thee for my son who honestly means whom i have begotten in my water in other words when i was in prison i gave birth to another child his name is [Applause] [Music] it's the giving of birth of men everybody here that's why brother branham said sex was a permissive will children should come by the spoken word multiplication by the word [Applause] heritage of who and the fruit of the warm beast is water the children is not your inheritance jacob this child doesn't belong to you ever here joseph went to egypt he gave birth to ephraim jacob came and he looked at joseph he said who are these children he said these are my children this is ephraim and manasseh amen he said pull them here so i can bless them when they're bringing the children suddenly when he shot his head he goes like this [Applause] [Music] ever here joseph said daddy that's not the case this is the oldest he said it is not me melchizedek is talking right now [Applause] i work here i am under melchizedek i am not going by the natural image according to the natural image you are right but according to melchizedek the first the younger one he's the one that is the first one and he crosses the hand and do you know what he said he said from today joseph these two children are no longer your children [Applause] i am no longer grandpa to these two when you see me you call me father and when you see your father joseph call him brother [Music] [Applause] that's why those two children became the tribe of israel they put them as a tribe because they became children of who jacob not by sex but by predestination [Applause] by natural birth they can never be the tribe of israel but by predestination they are the tribe of israel they open the door and say hey you get in here where were you born joseph joseph is not your father joseph begotten you but your true father is god everybody here begotten you but your true father is abraham liver you just appeared through the ministry of jacob but really you were in the launch of abraham all this time ever here you were both under luther you were breath under jab and under wesley you were both under power those are the father i used to break you you were born from there with your marion platinum [Applause] but here that's why when brother branham went to the sixth dimension brother branham said are these all problems they say they are not pronouns they are the people you preach the message they belong to mercy but yet they were birthed by brother them [Music] ever here and when they saw brother branham they hugged him they said my precious what no father my precious water [Applause] oh my god hallelujah is it okay can we still cram blessed be the name of the lord he said feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constrain be careful but willingly you don't want to be forced into an office you gotta be willingly to to to serve the children of god we cannot beg you to serve the children of god [Applause] it should be a pleasure for you to serve the children of god it should be a pleasure for you to play it on the keyboard it should be a pleasure for you to play on the drum it should be a pleasure for you to lead the song to be a deacon to be a trustee it should be a pleasure [Applause] and a privilege to serve the children of god we cannot beg you hallelujah not for fifa lucra not for money not for money you start with money you get the wrong place you want to be a pastor for money you get the wrong spot go find a job this is not for money [Applause] hallelujah amen he said not by people look but of a ready mind when they need you you're ready to go when they need you you're ready to go it's time for church i'm ready for church i want to serve the children of god hallelujah neither has been lord of the waters you are not the boss the boss is god [Applause] you are not the boss you are not the father everybody here by being an example to the water and one day that's why this one is not a shepherd really there is a bus over him everybody care call no manual upon water for one is your which is in water that's why paul said timothy my son but from god hour amen everybody okay so far so we understand now when we are dealing with melchizedek we are entering into the predestination ever here there is a fellow that is above his fellow verse 11 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood what father need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of who there is two orders what happened really what's going on keep your seat belted when we are looking on the natural side are you okay are you ready when we look at the natural side god chose a nation called israel and pulled the nation out back here he said out of all the nation of the earth god look at the egyptian look at the syrian look at this look at this look at everybody he said out of all of this i'm choosing this one i pull israel and i'm going to use israel as an example to make all the nation of the world understand how i operate everybody here when he chose israel in exodus 19 the bible say now therefore if it's under condition [Music] in the natural seed it's conditional there is a condition if if ye will obey my voice indeed i will keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above for all the earth is water everybody here belongs to me but i pick you up there is a condition if you want me to lift you up above everybody you keep what i tell you anybody here and he shall be unto me a kingdom of water and a holy water these are the word which that shall speak unto the children of water so according to god when he was pulling the nation of israel he wants all of them to be priests under one condition you got to follow what i tell you if you don't follow what i tell you guess what i will take that priest off anybody here in the natural we continue then we found in exodus chapter 12 verse 12 the bible say for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the water why was god smiting only the firstborn [Music] have you ever thought about that why why he didn't spy to the youngest why he didn't smite the one in the middle only the first one keep your seatbelt everybody here and i was smart all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and water when god dealt with the natural seed god want to smite not only men he want to smite both men and beast hey mark here so when god was going through egypt here when he was killing he was not only killing the firstborn of men he was also killing the first melbourne of animals i'm reading the bible you can open your bible itself i usually put up here so i can make your life easy instead of going this this this i make it easy on you everybody both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a water so the selection of the firstborn goes with a sacrifice there is a lamb here that must be killed there is a slaying of the lamb here when i see the blood shall be for you a talking upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood everybody i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt everybody the blood here god say go ahead and pick up a lamb and slay the lamb here when you say the lamb take the blood when you take the blood go ahead and put the blood on the lentil of the door ever here usually when we talk about the blood at the door we usually looking at the whole house anybody here but when the deaf angel was coming the one who was nervous in the house was not mama you okay the one who was nervous was not daddy the one who was nervous was not the youngest one the one who was nervous was not the middle one the nervous was on the first bone everybody the firstborn was not having appetite the younger children could eat the hamburger no problem mama can be fine the whole tension the entire house everybody here was laying on the first pawn [Music] i wish i have time i wish i have come my garden the whole house was laying upon the firstborn [Music] everybody here anybody here if people were attention if you didn't put the blood there is no problem the deaf engine will enter when the deaf engineer look he said this is mommy this is daddy where is the first one he get there pick up the first ball and leave everybody anybody here show their blood are you there are you there the blood was really atoning the firstborn [Music] why the firstborn why the firstborn ever here brother branham said when the defender was coming the firstborn was going to the father and said daddy did you apply the blood here daddy said yes i know what to do he said no no no this doesn't concern you the one that they're gonna kill is me not you i wanna make sure you put the blood over there i don't wanna die because you can speak spare but i wanna be protected make sure let's go together let me make sure you put the blood because when the death anger comes i am the one that's going to be dead not you [Music] hallelujah when the definition enter mama stay alive daddy stay alive leave the brothers taylor the only one gone is the firstborn ever here and the protection of the firstborn takes a killing of helena everybody in other words the defender you follow me must come after the slaying of the lamb [Music] everybody everybody here everybody here the lamb must be slain before the coming of the death engine [Applause] oh my god what is in the blood the bible says in leviticus 17 for the life of the flesh is in the water so now we understand so when they slay the lamb god said take the blood so by taking the blood they are really taking the life of the lamb what are you do what are you gonna do with the life of the lamb hallelujah and i have given it to you upon the altar to make a water for your water for this the blood that makes an atonement for the water [Music] anybody here does an animal have so why was he killing the animal [Music] the human head soul but once the human is under the token you follow me the creation that is under the man is also redeemer amen because man was higher than animals here once the first burn is protected even the animal in the house all the first born of the animal are protected so it's man and creation together hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hebrew 9 and almost all things are by the law purge with water and without shedding of blood there is not hallelujah exodus 13 and the lord spoken to moses saying sanctify unto me all the water [Music] in other words god said consecrate me all the firstborn what do you need the firstborn for what are you going to do with him hallelujah who saw the open the womb from the children of israel the one who break the virtue of virginity and open the virtue of maternity the first one that changed mama from a girl into mama get me that one ever here because he brought transformation to the mother [Music] whatsoever opened the womb among the children of israel buff of water and of water it is water i thought you want the whole nation now you don't want the entire nation you begin to look for firstborn blessed be the name of the lord amen in exodus 32 moses went and when moses went he went into the mountain came down israel scene completely did something that was wrong here remember their covenant was under condition the bible says this when moses saw that the people were naked if you look at those people they had clothes but when the prophet look at them they don't have clothes it looks like the prophet have eye glasses that when he look at you he doesn't see your clothes he have like an x-ray machine when the prophet looked like this he said they are all naked and when you look you say who is naked they all have clothing moses saying no no they are naked he said naked before who so the eyes of god was in a prophet [Music] are we okay when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me everybody all has seen moses step out he looked at the situation he looked he looked he said no we must bring punishment who among you is on the lord's side the invitation was given to everybody everybody everybody could raise their hand and say we are all in the lord's son for some reason not everybody moved why didn't everybody moved you ready the bible says all the sons of liver gathered to gather themselves together unto who why only liver you okay now why didn't the son of ephraim come why didn't the son of judah come why didn't the son of rubin come for some reason something came on the liver maybe he was washing his dishes when moses spoke he just felt like the dishes fell down here maybe a liver was working on something when moses when the voice of the prophet spoke there was something in liver that just dropped and rose up and moved straight to moses and maybe when you look at the eyes the eyes changing maybe they were laughing and suddenly they turn around where is moses and they begin to go everybody here because in the launch of abraham [Applause] ever here the one who melchizedes remember to have given the tithe was river but it was not time yet but when times come [Music] something jump on liver and block the other everybody here it looks like everybody's dreaming but liver is moving [Music] ever here it is predestination [Applause] that is no more than natural seed because all of them where the natural seed of abraham but liver move not by naturally stent [Music] brother branham said before the earthquake in india ever here this found out that all the animals suddenly were moving away from the wall and the human being was going in the war because nature never sinned he became subject to sin automatically because he was under man and when the earthquake came and began to kill the people the human being died but the animal was safe there was something in the animal that told them get away from the wall if you ask a a goat what is a wall the goat doesn't know he cannot even talk if you ask a chicken or a pig what is a wall he doesn't know but when danger is coming the chicken knows the difference between the world and being in a safe place nobody teaches the chicken nobody teaches the goat the god himself knows that this is a wall it is made out of wood this one is concrete this is the danger one and then he move out nobody taught him the difference between wood and concrete hallelujah brother branham said that is god in nature ever here and he said unto them that save the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side the leaver came he said take your sword everybody next everybody and go in and out from the gate to get throughout the camp and slay every man in his water can you do that can you do that and slay every man in his water friend and every man is what anybody care what a commandment so if you were laughing with delivered you were his friend and you were talking about you know did you hear the news and everything when delivered leave and go to moses when he's coming he's gonna kill you hallelujah and the children of liver did according to the word of moses and their fear of the people that day about three thousand men no mercy leave i swear wait a minute i'm your friend do you remember you owe me money next what what anointing in this liver and only liver is doing that nobody else ever here for moses had said the truth about it consecrate yourself today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a what so when moses was speaking moses who didn't just say who is on the lord's side moses said who is on the lord's side i need you because there is a blessing here everybody here whoever will do what i'm telling you to do god is going to give him that blessing what is that blessing ever here blessed be the name of the lord number 3 verse 12 and i behold i have taken the who among the children of water instead of all the water are we okay i'm letting that sink everybody so the purpose that god was claiming the firstborn was to give them the priesthood here and because of sin is so lost [Music] because of sin ruby lost it do you know that rule be lost to his firstborn do you know that how many knows that open first chronicle because only few people i don't want you to say the pastor say first claudical chapter 5. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord my god you're there first chronicle chapter five i'm not even in the anybody here verse one now the sons of reuben the who the firstborn of whom the first child of jacob was robin hey back here for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's very bed hey come on do you know what reuben did right jacob have another wife the bible called her a concubine you polygamist that's your problem anybody care i don't know i cannot emphasize how to tell people it's wrong ever here how many wife did jacob have four two concubine but if the first woman that they gave him was who lia the first child of leah was ruben the second the one that he loved was who who was the first child of russia the firstborn of leah was reuben firstborn and the firstborn of of rapture was who now let's read now the sons of ruben the firstborn of israel who is jacob for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birthright was given to the sons of who joseph was the firstborn of he moved from the firstborn to the second firstborn you see that it was given to the sons of jacob they saw the the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the water amen now let's go back here i have taken delivered from among the children of israel instead of all the first born that opened the matrix or the womb among the children of israel therefore the liver shall be he disqualified the firstborn and because of what liver did he say instead of the first born now from there on i switched to liver but that didn't happen by any chance because in the loans of abraham liver already paid out to who predestination will prevail ever here because all the first born our mind for all the day that are smart all the first born in the land of egypt are hallowed in other words are consecrated unto me all the first born in israel because they were slaying the lamb and the lamb was consecrating the firstborn of israel when you put the blood god already claimed your firstborn when you put the blood god claimed your firstborn so everybody that got the blood of the lamb was already claimed everybody i hallowed unto me all the firstborn in israel both men and women man shall there be i am the lord verse 40 and the lord said unto moses number or the firstborn of the man of the children of israel from a month old and upward and take the number of their name and that shall take delivered for me i am the lord instead of all the firstborn among the children of israel and the color of delivered instead of all the first links among the cattle of the children of water the consecration was to consecrate man and the beast god rejected the nation of israel he said i need the tribe of liver i want you to take all the firstborn and i want you to take all the firstborn of the animal of the liver not the other animal ever here we're heading somewhere blessed be the name of the lord in deuteronomy 10 the bible says wherefore liver had no part nor inheritance with his brethren god separated him the lord is his inheritance according us the lord that god promised him ever here watch here because my time is going these are the family of delivered the family of the lib knight the family of the hebron the family of the malight the family of the moonshot the family of the kora tight everybody here karate comes from the father korra hey mark here hebrew knight there is the name hebron anybody but decorate cora begat who are we okay now and amram's wife was sister the daughter of liver whom her mother dared to live in egypt and yoke bed bear unto aram who and who and who [Music] you ready now so out of the family of delivered god pulled horror and at the time of the exodus he found a family and he pulled moses out of it but moses was not the firstborn but here the firstborn of aaron was named who's who do you want a scripture it's in exodus 7 7. exodus chapter 7 verse 7. amen aaron was bigger was greater was older than moses the bible said aaron was 83 and moses was 80. everybody here so the firstborn of amram was aaron what did god do to air on them first born first of all first of all anybody here all right bring the tribe of libernia and present them before who and under who that they may minister unto him we okay now so israel rejected god picked the tribe of liver everybody but inside the tribe of liver because there is only one office you follow me it's about the office but here inside the tribe of liver god picked aaron and he said i need the house of aaron the firstborn of amran he's the priest remember the first high priest was who aaron ever here now all delivered that remains everybody here i take them all as the workers and i give them as to help aaron back here there is a brother but there is a brother that goes higher and back here there is one brother that goes higher and the other remain but they are brother we okay now and they shall keep his charge and they shall be in the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation to do the service of the tabernacle and they shall keep all the instrument of the tabernacle of the congregation these are evil and the charge of the children of israel to do the service of the tabernacle and that shall give the levat unto who and his water the high priest and his children have workers remember ever here now under the natural lineage here we have now the priest office we have the priest office and the levat which are the helpers of the priest even though the priests themselves are livered but here because the first man that saw the man falling on the road to jericho was a priest [Music] we okay now we okay now and the second man that saw him was there are we okay now my time is already up amen we okay though okay now that shall give delivered unto aaron and to his son remember that priesthood they are wholly given unto him out of the children of israel and that shall appoint aaron the high priest and his children the children of the high priest and his son and they shall wait on the priesthood so the office of the priest was given only to aaron and his children period all the other levat are helpers to iran and this entire one and two make what they call the levitical priesthood everybody here so when they say levitical priesthood they are priests who held the office and they are leaver that helped the priest amen but here so not all leave at a priest but all priests are livered you want me to decide again to be a priest you must be a leaver but to be a priest you must be a child of aaron make sense make sense but to work in the tabernacle all you have to be is a levator but to go into the holy place and the holy of holiest only aaron and his family back here so all priests are leaving but not all levites are priests the priests are only aaron and his family now your bible changed from today hey and that shall appoint aaron and his son and shall wait on the priest's office so on the natural side here we find out that there is the firstborn has been chosen and they have given them the preached office what happened in the spiritual side and maybe we can stop here because time is up everybody here before the deaf angel comes there must be a what a killing of the lamb anybody here revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose name are not written in the book of life of who the lamb slain where so before you were born before you come to your mother before you travel from your great great great great great great great great great great great great father and right here a lamb was slain [Music] before they even created the earth before they created anything before they even talk about you here there was another name not a natural lamb but there was a spiritual lamb that was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but here because the levitical priesthood was only a reflection of the tree priesthood which was the melchizedek episode and if the blood was shed under the levitical priesthood we need also the blood not the human blood but the blood of god himself a bloodbath must be also shed for the spiritual seed and when the blood is shed he consecrates the firstborn who is the firstborn amen hallelujah for unto which of the angel said he at any time die out my son this day have water and again i won't be to him here and he shall be to me air and again when he bringing the first one into the water and he said let all the angel of god do whatever so we also have a first born [Music] and right here colossians 1 14 in whom we have redemption through his water the lamb even the forgiveness of water who is the image of the invisible god the what of what [Music] the priesthood was given to the firstborn you are a priest for heaven under the order of who he must be given to the firstborn hallelujah revelation 30. i'm going to stop somewhere here and until the angel of the church of what why now this year why not emphasis why not smear now why not pregnancy the bible says right this feeds the water the finality the faithful and the true water the water of the water i thought god already created do you follow me i thought god already created everything and on the seventh day god did what he rested because everything was water but why is he created what is he creating again he is standing in the midst of the church as he stand there revealing who he is is in this last stage he called himself the author of the creation of god this is another word are we okay are we okay are we okay the first creation multiplied by sex adam take the word multiply and replenish the multiplication was by sex but this is a new creation this has to do with that this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that [Music] they have a new blood groom [Music] they have a new bread groom created water [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah can i ask you a question who gave birth to ever [Music] [Applause] who gave birth to evil who gave birth to even [Applause] [Music] are we okay are we okay are we okay because paul say i'm traveling with beth paul also gave birth a man giving birth [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah god not mary provided that body mary was a human water and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth he was a he was the son of god he was off the water who gave mary the pregnancy [Music] who gave mary the pregnancy of jesus [Music] so the first child that opened the womb of mary was who and the first child that opened the womb god said that belongs to me [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he said he was he was man and god met and did what he was the first of water so it's another race in other words another species a new creation not by sex but there is a man that is giving birth [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he is the head of the new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the water the church here that's why when they took the picture of the crowd when they turn it sideways they saw the head [Applause] hallelujah who is the beginning the firstborn from the water that in all things he might have the water he must be the top therefore if any man being crushed he is a new creation all things have water behold all things are water there you can see that though man walls of the altar oh creation all the order all creation now in union with christ he has become a water of water amen this new creation is not the odd creation made up [Music] can you give me a few minutes so i can land the plane i can't get to the new samaritan the good samaritan amen how many body parts have a man body and water and water the soul that sinneth that soul shall do what so if you're so die you're going to get a new one relax i shall give you a new [Music] this sword speak of your old nature so that soul master so you receive a new nature everybody here so when you are born by the word everybody here they give they take care of the soul new because brother branham said it is not the old creation makeover in other words everything is brand new do you follow me brother branham is saying this that when we meet new creation we're not talking about taking you break you and take the same and start over again that's nothing anybody here in other words when they look at you they will never see a trace of something of you before [Applause] you follow me when they look at your soul it is a completely different song than the beginning [Applause] when they check your spirit it is a total different person the people that knew you before when they talked to you today they don't understand if it's the same man [Applause] everybody here the only thing that is left is this one but this one also they're gonna change it and give you a brand new one [Applause] so new creation means everything from inside out new new new new yeah hallelujah this new creation is not the old creation makeover or it could not be called air this is exactly what he says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by waves of water he have nothing to do with sex anymore it's another multiplication it's another breath [Music] that was how he dealt with israel in the nature he chose abraham in the nature and of abraham issued through uh you know from abraham issue through the godly as a clan natural but now out of water tribe and nation he has a water it's a purpose in melchizedek he's the first of that creation he was god created in the form of what when they created jesus christ they bypassed sex because that's the serpentine so if the first one is created without sex every child that come from him will come with that sex [Music] [Applause] ever here now by his spirit he is creating water unto himself god the creator created himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his water this purpose took form through what i love jacob i hated his song [Music] have nothing to do with you with sex but here let's finish here but here come unto mount zion and unto the city of who the water and to a new and innumerable company of angel to the general water of the church of who [Applause] [Music] so the firstborn have a church [Music] and that church is his bread that's why on calvary the peace him on his side like the priests adam because he is the second adam and he must give breath that's why when the prism water and blood came out just like a woman giving birth because he's buffing his ears let's stand [Applause] let's stand here [Applause] let's stand here why did water and blood came up together to the general assembly to the church of the water which are written where which are written where which book do have the name of the people the book of life this church is written in the lamb's book of life which is written in heaven and to god the water the cloud and to the spirit of just man-made water take galatians for hallelujah don't want to linger here brother david you will call this part one take galatians 4 and we can pray hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord take galatians 4 you there you there go to verse 22 are you there so it is written that abraham had water the one by water and the other by water but he who was of the bound woman was born after the water that's ismail it's a desire of sex but he of the fruit with the free woman was born by water isaac was a promise ever here everybody verse 24 which things are an allegory in other words it was a tap it was just a shadow god was giving a message yes that's right everybody here it was our allegory for these are the two covenant so when you're reading you're reading a story but actually it's not a story you're reading two covenant these are two covenants the one from mount sana where they lock him which gender the bondage because the law put us in prison which is who edgar the son of ishmael the mother of ishmael for this edgar is mount sana in arabia and answers to jerusalem which is now the jews and he's in bondage with her children in other words ishmael represented the jews today which are of ego so if ishmael represented the jews that we are afraid of who is now isaac everybody here verse 26 but jerusalem which is where if there is a jerusalem above that jerusalem this jerusalem have a king if there is a jerusalem above the jerusalem above must have also a king and what is that name of that king melchizede the king of water selem which is water in other words there is another seed that comes from melchizedek jerusalem which is above is what you see is free which is the water do you see your mama do you see your mama do you see your mama so when you are giving birth by the new birth the one who delivered you your mother is up there and the king over there the father is melchizedek in other words when you are born that's why you heard jesus saying when a sinner come to repentance what happened over there what happened over there what happened over there joy joy where in other words there is a party of you in heaven they are singing and dancing in heaven when you are born over there the jerusalem your mother in heaven keep this we will continue on this because if i continue things continue to come up let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you i again father for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you are still and have been doing for us lord everything that was in tapper we are now the reality we are the anti-top of those things lord now we understand why you could lay everything in your glory because you are looking for a special species we can understand why father you say father not my will but that will because when you look through the time you saw us you saw your children lord and father you were ready to lay everything to be stripped by human being and to accept lord father to die a death of a sinner because you knew that through that death he was only going through birth pain because you are giving birth to a child to your own brother just like adam because you didn't want to be lonely anymore father may we understand who we are may we understand lord father the revelation no wonder paul could say how great this man melchizedek is may lord father the church catch the revelation on who they really are not by the natural image not by their birth not even by the family they were birthed here under the earth because we could hear your prophet saying that i'm no longer the child of ella and charles branham it's not that he was rejecting his earthly parent but father you brought him to a higher revelation to understand that the earthly parent were not truly his parent their true parent was the one that started with us from before the foundation of the world when you were laying the foundation of the world and the sons of god was shouting for glory father we were there with you and we were eternal in your thought and may we understand that there is nothing that can step there is no death there is no height there is nothing that can separate us from the love of god which is in jesus christ because we are we have been sparse we are the bride of the very living god and we came out from the very launch of god not again by sex but it's a spiritual multiplication that can never be defiled again where we know lord father that we're gonna reach perfection for certainty because you who start the work you will finish it until the day of jesus christ lord we thank you for the grace that i have been given to even move to this time father i know time went to lord be upload but i thank you for the sacrifice you given to your children to bear up to this time lord may you continue with them father continue to open up this world beyond what was spoken here so that that can get a grasp and the people will begin to understand how to behave because they're coming from a different world just like the slave even though he was in a different land he could behave differently because he understood what he came where he came from may this church father and whoever he's gonna listen to this letter may they be realized father who they are and from there on all the christmas will be dropping all the the the drinking all the smoking everything else will begin to drop because they will realize that there is a father that is greater than we think and like the prodigal son may the one that is out of the way can drop everything and begin to come back to the house knowing lord father that in my father house even the servant are living better than what i'm living here even lord father lord the servants that are there are sleeping in a better place than we are and father you spoke to us that angel our servant lord but we are not servant we are higher than ange lord and what about if we come back from home what privilege what is a wedding out by the wedding band of marriage lord father reminding us that our position was never lost because you spoke in your word that's all that the father have given you you have lost none of them father we ask you and commit everything unto the hand if somebody's sick this morning father may you touch them and heal them if somebody's struggling lord you're the high priest lord that can be touched by the feeling of the infirmity may you touch them and heal them as we commit them unto the hand in jesus precious name amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music]
