========================================

[Music] then sweeping up to glory to see his blessed face where rivers of delight shall ever roll hallelujah he's the lily of the valley the bride and morning star he's the fearing to my soul hallelujah i hope you all know him that way as well amen hallelujah you can't have problems if you sing a song like that amen he is just all of that now this next song i don't know that we've ever sang it here it is an older hymn um i was reading um you know sometimes people post things on whatsapp you know uh like brother seth does a little bit and and i enjoy it because it's mostly pictures of him and his wife after church and they're just always so happy looking it's an inspiration to me but sister um rosemary earlier this week posted one and it's the scripture i know whom i've believed and he is faithful how does it go and he's and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him this day against that day so we're going to sing that it's a song i know y'all know the song i just don't know that we've sang it in a while but i want to let her know i'm sure she's going to be streaming today she is on on um on her trip because her mom passed and we'll be praying you know we're praying for that but um i wanted to let her know that she inspired us to sing it that this morning there's a reason there's always a reason so i know not why god's wondrous grace to me he had made known nor why unworthy christ in love redeem me for his all but i know whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know not how this saving faith to me he didn't bond [Music] his word wrought peace within my heart [Music] [Music] he is able [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know not how the spirit moves [Music] convincing men of sins reaving jesus through his word creating faith in him but [Music] [Laughter] that he is able to keep that way type committed unto him against that damn i know not what of good or ill maybe reserve for me of where ways of golden days before his face i see but i know [Music] he is able to keep that coming that day now i know not when my lord may come at night or noonday then nor if i walk the bear with [Music] and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i'd committed unto him against that day hallelujah hallelujah i know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin revealing jesus through the word creating faith in him amen what a good song what a wonderful song amen we got one more here i'm gonna i'm gonna do this let me get my lips wet again let's stick it to my teeth i'm gonna start this song in the garden if anyone feels inspired to come get this and help me out besides brother seth you're welcome to this was one of my we were talking about this when i sent the um amen when i sent the um text out of the songs and the word yummy came up brother stephen's talking about how yummy the word is and this song has the potential of being a yummy song maybe a little more reserved than yummy but it came out so let's um let's see do y'all like the new word things amen amen i come to the garden [Music] while the dew is still on the road it's a little high okay we'll change for her that's fine what was that [Music] i come to the [Music] garden wow [Music] and the voice i hear falling on [Music] oh he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tear breathing he speaks his voice is so sweet [Music] floaty that he gave to me within my heart [Music] me his own and the joy we share as we turn [Music] [Music] [Laughter] i see the garden with me [Music] around me before [Music] his voice to me is score holy [Music] with me [Music] and he tells me i am his own and those we share [Music] has ever [Music] that wonderful hallelujah [Music] you know we hear that voice this is kind of a garden in here is it not none other no amen i heard that song the first time when my granddad um died in about 71 or 72. he was in his 90s i think and they said it was one of his favorites and it's just stuck with me forever so thank you for uh bearing with me on that once again i don't i don't have any praise reports unless somebody can give me a quick shout out with um with one amen i'll give one our grandson turned one on uh tuesday first grandson amen we had a birthday party yesterday and i don't know if i mentioned it but as far as the porters go i'm the first first granddad that's made it a year my my granddaddy died in 1938 and obviously i wasn't around regardless of what some of y'all might think and the second my dad and my dad died when he was four months old so he didn't know him none of my children knew him either now the other part is is that when jeffrey turned one which you know it's the first born and the first and only son i was in desert storm so i missed it so yesterday was a very special day as far as our grandson went and he's a little pistol he'll we'll bring him sooner or later you know when we um let's do remember sister rosemary um today and this week as she is going you got something oh yeah that's right he got a new job this week hey man he's working over there where i do amen [Applause] hallelujah that's great thank you for um giving him praise for that we we got him over there where i am he's he's the yard man the loader operator making some pretty good money and they really love him that's the better part they love him so so again let's remember sister rosemary keep her in our thoughts and prayers this week um i don't think it was something that she had not been anticipating but we just want to let our sister know that we'll we'll be with her this week in prayer i have one here it says for me this last month has been hard spiritually physically and financially but i believe the lord has already provided all of our needs i don't know just as confidential so i don't know who the lord knows but let's um let's hold on to that as well with this um with this um brother or sister amen does anybody have anything else that we didn't get wrote down real quick yes ma'am okay great well that's good amen praise the lord amen [Applause] brother deny you want to come up and pray over these things sir it's good to see brother deny i think he probably travels farther than anybody else but um it's worth it in there brother yes ma'am somebody over here yes ma'am sister sharon so the baby was born praise the lord amen [Applause] let's buy it and pray dear kind eternal heavenly father lord we bow before your holy throne of grace the reason we come to you is because we don't know any other god who can save who can deliver who can heal who can lead who can guide who can do all these things for us more than you do for us father we thank you for all these things that you do when many times lord we find ourselves unworthy of all these blessings that will bestow upon us lord even looking at what is going on in the world today so many people are losing their lives so many people getting sick so many people a lot with so many financial constraints some having lost jobs and everything your grace and your mercy we are here we are alive and healed it is only by your grace and you want to say thank you lord we want to thank you lord for even the testimonies that we're given lord we just pray and thank you for all these things that you do for us we want to pray for sister rosemary's on airway right now flying to kenya and you grant unto a traveling grace lord we just pray that you consult a family that has lost their loved one lord you are the only one lord who can console them and nobody else and many times things happen we don't even answer we don't even know why they happen the way they do but lord we can't ask you why because everything works out together for the good to those that love you and we know father this is for the good of our sister and even for all those who are involved in this thing so we just want to say thank you father lord we pray and come even thank you for the brother who got another job opportunity and even his brother john testified that they love him they love what what he's doing and how he's performing you just continue to help him so that you even do better and gain favor before those people so that when they look at him some of them may be one to christ as they see his work ethics lord we thank you for all the things you did for us even this morning giving us traveling grace we're able to make it here by your grace and your mercy i want to commit each and every one of us who is here even those who may not be able to make it lord may you help them so that they will be able to remember and retain that word that they had before even the last time they were here lord we commit even lord these tithes and offerings into your hands may it be for the father and of your gospel and may it be that is the minister comes forth before this sacred death to minister your word may our hearts lord be willing to hear what the spirit has to say unto the church may we go out of these doors lord being made being made better believers than when we came so that we'll be able to meet the enemy and defeat him in any at any given time because we are well equipped after hearing the word being ministered to us granted we pray in jesus christ's most precious name amen amen y'all can be seated i want to um i want to um we're going to have brother seth sing a special and then brother michael has to come up with uh huh we'll go ahead and we'll go ahead and let him sing first and then we'll do it is that okay and then we'll maybe sing something at the end but i want to let y'all know if anybody does get a special on their heart we're trying to kind of establish a little better order as far as um singing so brother stephen being the song leader at the church he's wanting the songs that that's specials to come through me prior to the sunday we're going to make sure they're appropriate we're going to make sure you know they're edifying and just just check them out you know and just um so if you have something let me know and i'll and i may consult you know i may consult a deacon or something if i'm if i'm not sure we just want to be in order we have such a good we have such a good thing going here as far as our services and we don't want anything to um create any kind of problem including the singing even me so but seth amen amen that's more like it amen i i know i'm talking to believers that are alive man it's uh it's just a simple song i always love to sing simple songs amen and it goes this way jesus took my burdens he ruled them in the sea now i have the victory that he has given me amen all my sins and burdens he ruled them in the sea amen jesus took
