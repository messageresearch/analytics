just kind of going to explain everything just so you guys can understand how everything went um yesterday I had a great day at work woke up that was already a blessing um went to work um I was assigned with you know two kids usually I I normally don't work with two kids but I just took the assignment I was working with them and then unfortunately and unfortunately they had two dogs so as I was at work you know I kind I just didn't want to get stressed out about that um especially when the mom was kind of giving me more instruction about the dogs versus the kids so I just feel like I was coming for the dogs but um overall everything went smoothly um I was able to train them nicely and everything everything went smoothly um it was a relaxing day little girl even went to sleep for like three hours so I was only taking care of one kid so I was just thankful for that um and then you know as the day went um I went to Walmart um last night with sister a actually so um I don't remember exactly where I placed or or how I left my phone on top of the trunk of the car um I think I think I think it was probably when I was holding like um my my my notebook that I kind of had notes of everything I wanted to buy um yesterday so I appar apparently when I picked it up I kind of forgot that my phone was with in my hand or something like that so we went in you know we were just talking fellowshipping she was giving me advice Etc so of course I didn't think about my phone at all until when um we were walking out the store and and then as as I got closer to the car some of my phone was just laying on the top of the trunk and I was like oh my God thank you Lord then nobody stole my phone because and then the first thing she said she was like you better thank God that you know um the devil you know especially you having a good day the devil was trying to mess up your day and then God was right there and told him to move out the way so I just want to give God the glory for protecting my phone um and I was able to get it and it wasn't lost so I thank God for that amen and amen amen we're going to invite um brother John Amen to thank the Lord for this testimony and uh and

tonight and the road was free without any traffic I say you know what that was a best choice to have service today because we are close to the Christmas city right here so tomorrow will be a big traffic over there and the service will be a trouble but the god rich in Mercy provided a way so we can draw it's like a miracle coming to church freely Oh Glory to God Amen praise be to the name of the Lord I'm not preaching tonight brother Charles Hamilton third is preaching tonight amen you know I was sitting there searching for coat usually I store coat in uh in my own department when I have a Cod for something out I put a title quot for this a Cod for this and I was searching the quot and I can't find it but as I was searching the document I found quot that I stored that I never thought I have now I pulled them up to put them on uh in the gun so ready to be fired sooner amen but uh but PRK God the Lord helped me so I can read these two quotes and I fa to read these two quot before he preaches we okay yes can I read them very short the first one is in 1960 in December the 11th in the evening the lodan church AG paragraph n brother Bram say and to see our Pastor here brother Neville he was a bashful backward sort of a boy yeah and I tell you he looked like he was never going to take a hold of it when he comes to Pentecost that was the beginning of brother nille but he never ended like that he start preaching like on fire yes sir amen and I'm going to read the second one it's in the message option part four it's in 1960 it's in May the 22nd uh in the evening paragraph 1 the first one brother Bram say there is a brother R up there on the road going up to have a meeting for him in few days going to have a Revival he said brother R is and I'm and I remember I used to push that little fellow around everywhere trying to make him get out in the harness and preach this message is loaded he was so backward he would say I just can't talk I'm reading right do you want me to put this in the church group chat H so you keep it for reference you want it or you good okay he say I just can't talk you ought to hear him amen see you don't know what you can do if you let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you that's right amen sister Teresa if you let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you then you will see what the holy spirit will do through you amen amen so everyone here who back and bashful this is your coat amen whoever is Bash back you know yourself amen those that are shy I'm shy amen I can't sing in front of the congregation you got the scripture amen you continue to be shy I will continue to push you because this is what BR brandham did amen until the good the gold the deity comes out of you and express God to this dying generation amen so let's call Brother Charles I told him take your time go go slowly and deliver the message amen and let's pull on the gift of the Lord only [Music] believe [Music] [Applause] oh all things are possible [Music] only [Music] believe [Music] GL all [Music] Jesus is Jesus [Music] all things are [Music] posible [Music] Jus Jesus [Music] is Jesus is all things are [Music] POS [Music] Jes amen can you hear me good hear me amen uh thank you singers very good singing amen uh wonderful was uh wonderful to hear the specials as well went very well um I would like to greet the church um I like to greet the church and say God bless you my precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ it's uh good to see you tonight everyone looks good looks happy healthy amen I would also like to thank brother Stephen for allowing me to preach amen it's a great honor to preach to the you know uh the people that God died for and his his a bride who purchase of his blood amen it's a a great honor to be chosen for that amen and now I like to go to our readings um for to for tonight I like to go to Exodus 29 this um it's actually a funny background to this uh message tonight um this is actually a question I put in the question and answers Box about two questions and answers ago and and then it was never gotten to um I gave it to brother Robert um and I was like I don't understand this and um then I had my other sermon ready to go around Sunday and then brother Steven you know the Lord hit brother Steven he told him he said you know when we listen to uh you know brother brandom and he drops those nuggets you know those nuggets are for you to go and dig in and that brother bam doesn't preach every single scripture but he gives us the tools to go into every single scripture so the Lord hit my heart and said okay so I have to change my whole sermon Sunday night and he just gave it to me and you know at first I read it to get and I said I still don't understand what this is saying but the lord gave me you know the inspiration and he started to unfold to me more and more and um so this is what I like to share I like to share with you what the lord gave me and um hopefully it's a blessing to you guys as well amen so uh Exodus 29 uh verse 20 and when you get there say Amen all right 29 29 verse 20 okay it says then shalt thou kill the ram kill the RAM and take of his blood and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons and upon the thumb of their right hand and upon the great toe of their right foot and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about amen and it reads and thou shalt take of the of the blood that is upon the Altar and of the anointing oil and sprinkle it upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him and he shall be hollowed which we know means consecrated in his garments and his sons and his sons garments with him amen and I would like to go to uh Leviticus 14 amen I would like to go to Leviticus 14 verse 28 you get there say amen amen it reads it reads and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot and upon the place of the blood of the tresp trespass offering and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed to make an atonement for him before the Lord amen so the what the um may be seated um what I was what I wasn't getting was you know why does it have to be on the whole right side of the body amen why the right tip of the ear why the right thumb why the right toe amen and I don't have the full answer to it but um I believe the Lord is putting me in the direction am amen so um I would like to pray um IID like to pray before we continue to go ahead amen if bow our hearts father God we thank you Lord God for getting us here tonight father we thank you Father for your grace your love your mercy Lord Lord God we come unto you humbly tonight father God coming to your into your place of worship father God with praise and thanksgiving Lord God father God we come father God

Christ Lord and father God we put the rest of this service in your hands Lord God Lord God in Jesus Christ's name we pray Lord amen amen amen amen so um you know I uh I would like to uh repeat this amen because it's already been said Sunday but you know the word says out of the mouth of two or three let every word be established amen and you know uh being a part of this congregation as well I believe you know it's even more fit for me to repeat this amen um I would like to say that you know this is not a Christmas message amen we do not celebrate Christmas amen and we know there's a reason why we don't celebrate Christmas amen because our Prophet amen he taught us the Revelation that you know Jesus wasn't even born in December amen that was that is the Pagan son God amen amen and because what they did was they said you know um uh let's have the son of God's birth they on the son God's birthday amen so that's what they did when they cuz they were already full of so many uh uh uh religions when they took the Christian religion and they tried to push it into their agenda amen and um you know I I say our Prophet amen because you know he was sent to this age amen and that you know I identify with this age amen I identify with you know the lady seeing age with the message that was given amen and identify with the bride of this age amen and I identify with the Revelation that Paul was longing for in this day amen that we have amen we have the fullness of everything amen and I'm thankful because you know we every other age was they given reformers amen but we weren't given a reformer we were given a restorer amen and He restored the the hearts of the of um the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen and and you know uh and through every age amen there it can never stick amen through every age they grew cold and they were formed into denominations amen and um I would like to read a quote from uh the handwriting on the wall in uh 1958 in 0618 it reads um and my most beloved friends were just at another Junction we had, 1500 years in Catholicism Along come Martin cooled off Along come Wesley cooled off along come the Baptist and cooled off Along come the Pentecost cooled off or it never went to a cooling off got lukewarm amen but just before this great cooling off or lukewarmness of the Pentecostal Church there must come again on the scene the supernatural amen the prophets amen and great messages amen and the healing of the sick and the raising of the Dead amen it's God's signpost amen we're at the end time amen the church is lukewarm just cooling off and going away it has to be that way God said it would be that way amen but the warning is to him to him that has ears to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen and I would like to get to that amen about about the ear amen and um you know we were given a prophet that will restore all things amen and though all things have already been restored amen because Revelations 10:7 tells us that amen he tells us that but in the days of the voice of the seventh seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets amen amen and uh you know and the another thing IID like to share is um a little testimony that uh that goes along with with this scripture of how you know all things have already been you know all the all the Mysteries have already been you know given amen it's just that God's word is so infinite that every time we open the scripture verse it seems like more is coming out of it amen and I would like to share a testimony that I shared with my parents amen I feel like it would help the church as well um so I I'm taking a math class in school and in my math class uh they the teacher you know half the time I can't understand what he's saying but when I do understand what he's saying is really awesome because he she showed us that you know um from one number to the next number is infinite so from number one to two is an Infinity in between that and I was like wow that's pretty interesting you know how is that possible and he explained it of how you can have your number one it's number two but between one and two you have 1.1 1.9 you have 1.99 999 keep on going amen and you can technically never reach number two amen and I was like wow that's that's pretty cool right because because when I'm reading my scriptures amen we're told that God's word is infinite so how you how do you get from one verse verse to the next verse amen so how so how can we always be stuck on like one verse for what 3 months but but it's more is more is coming out of it amen because you know it's even proven in and you know uh it's even proven in math amen that's just how God works amen and and you know we could be here until the Rapture and we still don't have everything here that's why he'll say he and fold himself throughout eternity so we'll never really get everything but we have everything here we have the tools to get everything but we just don't have time to get it amen so amen and um you know cuz we know uh Jesus he wasn't even born in the winter amen he was um he was born in Spring anden we know that he was born in April because that's the time when Lambs are born amen and I was doing my research and um I even found out that I looked up I was curious I said you know we're look talking about the bulock when are Bullocks born amen and so Bullocks are born from February to May so that's still spring April is still in there so that bulock that was that was slain in those seven years could have very well been born in April amen so I thought that was like a pretty cool thing amen and um you know we celebrate Jesus Christ just like the song said amen we celebrate his death his burial his resurrection amen because because of death burial and resurrection that that is what has given us the right Amen to call ourselves sons of God Amen that's what's given us the right Amen to take part in the promises and in the blessings amen and um you know we've been we've been given you know the revelation of this Bible by our Prophet to be able to discern the times we're living in amen and um so I would like to get to the topic at hand amen for tonight the title of tonight's ser is the application of the blood and oil for the priest I was um I was looking at it and you know we know what the blood represents we know what oil represents amen and we know the oil is the Holy Ghost amen and we know the blood that's the atonement amen and when I was reading these scriptures I said okay I know what the what what what they're using means but why are they putting it on their ears on their thumb and on on on their great toe amen and so I saw started you know um trying to use the you know the message apps that we have and you know how you press a verse and it shows you how many times brother BR spoke about it but I couldn't find nothing I was like man this is crazy I can't find anything on it so um I was looking and and I that's when uh the Lord touched uh brother stepen to say you know we're given all the tools necessary anden so I said let me stop being so superficial and stop being so stuck on just um you know what did he say by this exact same verse amen so I started looking into you know what does the blood mean what does the oil mean what does the air mean according to the message what does the thumb mean what does the right hand mean according to the message what does the right foot mean according to the message amen so um I would like to take this step by step amen um we we we may not finish it amen this service amen but I want to take it step by step I went through everything and um I don't have the answer but I believe the Lord has put me in the direction am so um first I like to go on go over the blood amen I feel like you can never never uh uh not talk about the blood especially when it's is brought up in the scriptures amen so um we know that the blood is a token amen we know that the blood is what separates the True Believer from the world Amen we know that you know you apply the token to distinguish yourself from the world Amen that's what distinguishes you know that's why they even have to do that when they were consecrating the priest amen because that that is that is the the that is what even allows you to become a priest because you have to recognize the blood of of when see back in that day they had an animal amen and they would put their hand on the animal's head and because they would feel the death and they would feel the quivering and so they would be identified with that amen and we're identified with Calvary amen so you see because in in the um Jesus he said blessed bless is him more who didn't even see it amen so so we didn't physically see calary amen but we believe it amen and we identified with that amen so being identified with that amen we're already what we're already uh um once you identify with the bud you're already at on different caliber amen and um so we know that um a a priest that is consecrated with blood and oil is separated from the world and separated from the false priest amen just like the anointed ones in the end time you know brother Bon preached amen and um you know that you can't go anywhere further with God Amen unless you acknowledge the blood amen unless you unless you acknowledge that unless you acknowledge the cross you can't even go further with God and you can't expect to go further with God because you can't expect the blessings if you haven't if a pardon is a pardon unless unless it's accepted as a pardon amen so you can't be you can't be expecting to to take part in those blessings if you don't even even believe you know in the person who's giv you those blessings amen you can't you can't look at the gifts you got to look at The Giver of the gifts amen and um so uh I would like to also say you know people acknowledge the blood in Calvary but they refuse to acknowledge the oil amen which is the Holy Ghost amen see and and what what do I mean by that amen so to receive the Holy Ghost you must commit a full surrender to the Lord Lord amen so what I mean by that is we know the prophet teaches us that you know uh people they they they uh recognize Jesus Christ they recognize the blood but they don't want to allow him to be Lord over their life you know they don't they don't want them to be Lord over you know um uh their conduct amen their order their Doctrine they don't they don't want them to be uh Lord over everything amen see because uh that's where you know the scripture comes in you know um you have a form of godliness but you're drinking the power thereof amen you see and uh uh brother brandham gives uh a story about um a man who went to the doctor he was sick and the doctor had the Cure so the man recognized he recognizes the doctor but he goes to the doctor's house and he sits on the steps amen and he says you know I'm here you know uh uh you know this is his job so I'm here he'll he'll do his work on me well that's not how it works amen you have to go in and and and surrender yourself to the doctor so he can work on you amen and and this man did this expecting you know for the God for the to the doctor to just work on him but he end up dying amen and you can't you can't blame the doctor for that amen the men didn't get off the steps amen and I was sharing that uh testimony I was speaking with brother uh Dam about it and he gave me a little nugget on it you know he said you know those steps can mean anything and then those steps can be you know your phone those steps can be you know wherever you're not giving up to the Lord it can be your free time you know it can be what whatever you're doing that you're saying okay I'm a Believer I live a consecrated life but there's that one thing that you're not giving up to the Lord those could be your steps amen and and um so I would like to give the um the the direct quote of this story amen um this is in this is in uh 1962 1123 on the way back Amen brother Brenham says well you've got a certain disease why he's got a medicine cabinet full Amen in there that will kill that disease it's a poison drug that will knock that disease out here's others they got healed amen look at them and man they had that disease and they've got it no more and the doctor's got plenty of medicine and you sit on the steps and say well I've come this far if he wants me to get healed he'll come out here and do it amen he says brother B says oh no no no that's that's not it no you'll die on those steps amen he says it won't be the doctor's fault neither will it be the lack of Medicine amen it is because of the own stubborn will of the people amen amen that won't take the medicine Amen in the church is the same amen we've got plenty of scripture amen we've got the thing that will straighten the church out amen we've got the thing that will send send you back to where you was 50 years ago you um but you've got to want to take it amen you've got to want to get well a cure of these diseases the spiritual diseases must have it amen so we see the man acknowledges the doctor but refuses to allow the doctor to work on him amen and in um the seven Church ages book in the Samaran Church age uh brother bham says now watch carefully and get this Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen see uh Paul said uh have ye received the Holy Ghost s you believe amen this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water this is in all this this whole sentence is in all caps he says but they do not go on and receive the Holy Ghost amen you believe you receive the spirit you believe unto receiving the spirit amen Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction amen which is toward the Holy Ghost amen but people stop there amen I'm pause for a second you so you see how how he says you know um you believe unto receiving the spirit amen so we see how remember in our teachings in the Tabernacle amen of how you can enter the Tabernacle but you can get stuck amen you don't want to stay there too long amen once you get uh uh in the justification Jus justification step I'm sorry you want to hurry up and get into sanctification and and that's really dangerous because once you're stuck in sanctification you know that's how you get into self-righteousness you think you you know um I'm not doing anything wrong you know um I'm doing everything you know every time I'm in service nothing applies to me that he's saying so I'm I'm good amen so you just get stuck you start getting cold and get that's when you get lukewarm amen that's where Pentecost messed up they start to get lukewarm amen and then and then um those who who get into the Holy Ghost and then the Hol of holies amen there's another step after that because it makes way for the Holy Ghost himself amen so once you get into the holies of holies amen that's when you have the opportunity to fully surrender yourself to receive the Holy Ghost amen so I want I want you to continue it says they go as far as water and then stop amen they believe and then stop the Bible does not say uh that you receive when you believe it is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe amen that's ex the exact leral literal translation is did ye having previously believed receive the Holy Ghost amen the people believeth and stop amen you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of Pentecost that's right amen now uh that was dealing with the blood amen now I would like to go into um uh the ear amen with what the Lord showed me with the ear amen now um with with the ear um uh a scripture hit hit my heart it says he that ha an he that hath an ear let him hear what the SP what the spirit saith unto the CH Church amen now we know this is mentioned for every church every age before the Lord goes into the other Church age he always says this amen so it must be very important amen amen you you have to hear what he's saying amen that means what he's saying is you have to read beyond what you're looking at amen you have to see you know when uh when brother bam brother bam had that vision of him cutting the mountain and was white amen when you're reading your Bible that white part that you're looking at amen that's what you have to see amen so I I'll just read it says um see in the church age book in the Sam in the Samaran Church age again uh brother bam says it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages amen he says it is most evident from these scriptures which I get into um that no man of himself can hear God Amen that ability has to be given him of God Amen it says in uh Matthew 16:17 I like to go to that scripture Amen brother because we see that you know it it has to be given him of God meaning it's gifted to him amen amen meaning you know it's by Grace amen we go to uh Matthew uh 16:17 when you get there say am amen amen amen Matthew 167 yes sir it reads and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood haveth not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven amen that is how we get the Revelation as well amen it's not given to us of man amen not we're not we're not Priests of man or by man we're is by God's grace amen not uh not by power not by might but by thy Spirit sayith the Lord amen that's how we're all saved aen that's why we're all saved by grace and me that's how when we read it that's why you know that we we have the saying in the message that the Bible is a new booken because we're able to see the love message that God put in there for his bride amen and only the bride can understand it amen amen cuz you give it to uh somebody else they'll read it they say okay I get what it's saying but what is it what does that mean for Meen they they don't get the same feeling they don't get the same uh uh uh deep pulling unto the Deep they don't get that same feeling when they read it amen amen um so I would like to continue it says um see because it's GI it to him amen see if you draw n unto God God God draws n unto you amen and that's in um John 6 uh verse 44 amen I like to go to John 6 verse 44 so you you guys can read it as well amen Amen in uh John 6:44 when we get there say Amen yes sir amen it reads no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me amen sent me draw him amen and I will raise him up in the last day amen and I would like to go to uh James 4 uh verse 8 and I would like to remember that the topic we're speaking of Amen is the ear amen and what is so important about that ear's go to James James 4:8 you get there say amen amen all right V verse eight it reads draw night unto God He will draw n unto you cleanse cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded amen see so what he says ye double minded and mean you can't be you know wanting to serve God and man at the same time it doesn't work like that amen that's why you have to fully surrender amen and um continuing uh brother Brenham uh in the church age book he continues and speaks he says putting these verses together the on you just read he said we see that there's only one group of people right and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age amen that group is of God Amen because the group because the groups that cannot hear is not of God Amen it just that this is how it is amen you're not of God if you just can't see it you can't see it amen and um I was I was uh speaking with uh uh brother Kelly uh one afternoon and I was asking I said you know um I hear this a lot in the message you know theologians this theologians that you know what does that mean you know cuz you know I thought a theologian is someone who just you know likes to read their Bible and just you know I was like what is that what is wrong with that amen and um you know that's how I love brother Kelly he said just go to uh he said uh just go to I believe he told me just go to Matthew 16 he just read it and I said okay I get it you know I get it now you know it's just if if you just don't if if it's not given you of God to see it you just won't see it amen and and so when theologians are referenc you know from what I understand I'm not going to say this is the definition of I'm say from what I understand so far is that when a theologian is is referenced that's just somebody who is who is wanting to see it but they just not they're just not chosen to see it amen they're they're looking in the word and they're they're in it night and day and they're you know they they just may not have revelation of you know a prophet amen and because of that they're applying their own interpretation to the word amen and that's why you know the you know uh the the scriptures say curse is he that add to curse is he that takes away anden and what is that saying don't give her own interpretation God God has a provided way for that amen and that is his Prophet am mean uh what is it Amos 3:7 am mean do nothing except his uh uh uh uh through His prophets amen so so we have to go through the prophets because they they are the mouthpiece of God for that time amen and and using the prophets that's how you know what God is thinking that's that's the mind of God for that time amen amen and um I would like to go to um John 8 uh John 8 uh verse 42-44 amen John 8 yes sir can we get there say amen amen all right John 8 verse 42 it reads Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he that set me amen why do you not understand my speech even because this is some answering this is him answering you know his question he's saying you know why can't you understand me amen why is it that I'm here in front of you and you guys are Pharisees you guys are Sadducees you know your word and me so yeah you're Theologian so why why can you not understand my speech amen and he says he he he he answers the question for him he says even because you cannot hear my word amen and what is the word amen the word of God Amen and and ye are of your father the devil Amen in the lust of your father he said in in in the lust of your father you will do he was a murder from the beginning in abold from the beginning and ab bold not in the truth amen so what what what is he saying here he's speaking to theologians amen and and um when someone is applying their own interpretation to a word amen they're killing the revelation of that word amen because you are you are you are disannulling the the the the Vindicated word of the Prophet for that age amen so so that's why he is saying right here that that he was a murder from the beginning in a bod not in the truth amen because he's rejecting the truth if if if you see um this is a revelation I was given to me recently as well amen uh humility amen humility is when is when you know you you have a thought and you're going to your word with a preconceived thought of you know what it means already and you find something else that's against that and you are humble enough to let go of the thought that you have and accept the thought that's there amen so that's humility amen and and and and these people were not humble enough to do that amen and he says that um because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own am amen for he is a liar and the father of it amen and what do we know a lie is amen a lie is 99% truth amen we know in the garden of edian the lie was one word off amen so again on the on theologians when you have you know someone who's applying their own thoughts amen and you ever talk to somebody who knows their Bible very well it's like they're right but they're missing something amen like like like they're missing that one word or they're off by a little bit and you you agree with them you're you're saying amen and you're agreeing with them you're saying well look at it this way look at it this way but they're just they just won't accept the truth because they have their own thought in that and that thought is one word off and because it's one word off you know that they believe they're right amen and um I like to I like to continue amen uh brother B continues he says uh that group that can and does not hear what what the spirit is saying and receive the Revelation thereof is that group described in 1 Corinthians 2 uh 6-6 amen I like to go to that uh 1 Corinthians 2 amen can you get there say amen amen amen and I like to remind you again of the topic we're on Amen we're on the ear and we're talking about the ear amen yes sir why was the ear so important that the blood the blood and the oil you see because we went to uh we went to Exodus and they went to Leviticus Amen in Exodus they had blood on the ear on on the finger on on the foot and then Leviticus they had oil amen so both of those must be applied amen so um 1 Corinthians 2:16 through six amen it reads how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world Amen we know there's two wisdoms amen nor of the princes of this world that come to not amen see the the the wisdom of this world comes to not it comes to nothing amen it um it's vanity it you know you why gain the whole world and but you lose your soul amen and it says but we speak and I like to also mention this as well know that wisdom is the the best uh Divine gift that you can have amen so something else is in here amen that you know uh the wisdom of the world Amen that's that one word off amen it's it's it's a powerful gift to have the wisdom of the world the the wisdom of God it's powerful but if you're in one word off you're still wrong amen that's why you gain this whole world that's why if you have wisdom in the world you gain the whole world because it's a powerful gift to have amen I just wanted to uh say that amen and um verse S it says that we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery amen even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen for our glory amen which none of the princes of this world knew for they had known it they would not they not have crucified the Lord of glory amen but as it is written I have not seen Nor Ear heard amen neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him amen but God had revealed them to us by his spirit amen how could that ear hear how could that eye see amen how could it enter into the heart of that man because of the spirit amen see because there's another scripture that says uh um how uh uh how can you know the ways of man uh except for the spirit the spirit of the man knows ways of the man amen and for God the spirit of God knows the thing things of God Amen and the only way you can know the things of God is by the spirit of God Amen and and um amen and then uh we'll go to uh finish verse uh 10 it says but God ha revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit Seth all things they the Deep things of God Amen see so it's not just you know the uh the The Superficial on top you know that everybody knows amen he goes into the deep things of God Amen and and that's the gold mins amen that keep on going that's the that's the Infinity of one scripture that keeps on going amen the Deep things of God Amen for because we're supposed to see Jesus Christ in every scripture amen and if you see Jesus Christ in every scripture if if you don't you got to read it again because you miss something amen that's why we don't read our Bible like a newspaper that's why we that's why we don't just um you know we know we're supposed to read a scripture at night scripture in the morning amen and um you know the Prophet also said it you know people love sleep amen so um if you're if you're wanting to read your Bible like a newspaper amen then you'll just wake up five minutes for you got to leave and read it and say okay ready and you keep going amen but if you if you wake up a little earlier you're able to read your Bible how you're supposed to read it sir not have to worry about the time amen and if you and if you get ready to go to sleep a little earlier you know you'll be able to read your Bible like you want to you not have to worry about time amen amen um continue says um verse 11 uh for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man I amen this is what it was saying uh spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God Amen now we have received not the spirit of the world Amen see this he's he's confirming uh verse 11 amen and now we have received not the things of the world the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God Amen that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God amen amen see where uh uh the free freely given things which is a gift amen which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth amen but which the Holy Ghost teacheth amen comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen it says um but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God Amen because he's natural he's carnal amen for they are foolish unto him amen he he doesn't see the value in it amen um because they are spirit because they they are foolish unto him neither can he know them see even if he tried even neither can he know them even if he tried to know them because they are spiritually discerned amen uh continue uh verse 15 it says but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man cuz we know he's judge of God Amen only Gods can judge Gods amen for who hath known the mind of the Lord but he may instruct that that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen amen now I to um continue brother brother Brandon saying in this quote he says they are this I'mma go back so we understand what he was saying anden he says the group of that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives this the Revelation thereof is that group described in 1 Corinthians 2616 we just read amen and he continues he says they are the one they are the one who have the spirit of God Amen they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his spirit amen they are baptized with the Holy Ghost amen and I put in a little uh uh parentheses the oil amen that's the oil applied to the priest amen and because we know that only the elect amen only the priest sir amen only the bride can hear God's word without trouble amen um because to us it's a love story mean to us it's um it it's plain am mean it's it's an open book amen um because you know well we know Jesus as king of kings and Lord of lords you know um in in the thigh amen but they know they only know him you know on surface area amen that's how we that's how we have that scripture uh that says you know if they preach unto you another Jesus amen see they're still saying Jesus but it's another Jesus it's it's it's it's it's The Superficial Jesus it's it's the Jesus they they believed I was born on December 25th amen and um and I would like I would like to go to uh Matthew 13 amen uh 10 to 17 that's amen that's right it's their Jesus amen that's not our Jesus amen amen have to go to Matthew 13 amen cuz we say Jesus Christ amen because we know that Christ is the anointing amen cuz he was anointed amen with the fullness of God Amen that that's what Christ means amen Matthew 13 verse 10-1 17 when we get there and say amen amen it reads and and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables right he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven amen and we know the Kingdom of Heaven is the Holy Ghost amen and um but to them it is not given amen it's just not given they they air here they don't they don't have the they don't have the oil and the blood appli to their ear they just it's not going to happen amen and um continue it says it says uh for who whosoever have to him shall be given amen and he shall have more abundance amen but whosoever hath not uh from him shall shall be taken away even that he have amen so what is he saying you know uh for whosoever have hath what hath Jesus Jesus Christ amen whosoever have the Revelation whosoever have that blood and the oil applied to their ear who Whoever has that ear to hear amen see that's what he's saying amen for whosoever have to him shall be given amen if you have the ear it'll be given to you to hear it amen and he shall have more abundance amen you'll have more Revelation and more understanding with more Revelation comes a greater relationship with God Amen because you want more because you're so you're so uh um in a you want to see more you're like man this this revelation of this something I've been reading forever and now I see it you know what more didn't I see am man you want to keep going and diing into it it's it's it's um it's the inside teacher it's it's it's when uh you know brother bham says you know you get behind the holy of holies and you know you just you feel good and me it's a good feeling you know you get you're getting so much Revelation you just want to keep going you don't want to stop amen and um to continue it says in verse 13 yes sir uh it continues and it reads um therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not in hearing they hear not that's right neither do they understand amen and in them is fulfilled all is fulfilled the prophecy of of of Isaiah Isiah which sayith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive amen see this is the theologians again amen they're they're looking they're trying to hear it but just won't get it amen for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing amen and their eyes and their eyes have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes amen so what the Lord is telling is that he did this amen that he closed their eyes he closed their ears amen he's saying for the people's hearts is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have closed lest at any time see so lest at any time meaning if they should if they should see with their eyes if they should hear with their ears you know and should understand with their heart and should be they then should be converted and I should heal them amen see and and you can't you can't heal a a synagogue of Satan you can't you can't save a synagogue of Satan amen that's what he's saying amen because if if they knew these things then they would be saved amen and um I continue it says uh but blessed are your eyes amen they see in your ears for they hear amen for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things see many really strong theologians have have have wanted to see these things amen and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and I've not heard them amen okay um now I like to continue in Revelations chapter 4 number three at 1961 brother brandham uh he says it's not ly great big uh it's uh he came to his own see he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit say to the churches amen not to the outside to the church it's the church that get it shaking amen I used to think different from till that one day he spoke to me see this is Brother bam showing us humility in action amen he says I used to think different from that to one day he spoke to me and he made me go back in the word and think of how that the prophets all spoke of when John came when the high places would be made low when the Low Places may be made high and how the power of God would work and all the mountains would skipped by little Rams and the leaves would clap their hands well that looked like something that really was going to take place see amen and when it did what happened see people were expecting to see that I mean they were expecting to see he they were they were they were a a superficial looking at just the words and and that's why when Jesus came they missed him because they were looking at you know somebody to come great big on the cloud and to where everybody to see but he was born in the manger amen and they were looking for when John came for all these great things happen in nature but they didn't understand that you know there there's more than one side to a scripture amen there's a spiritual side there's many layers to the scripture amen so they they weren't looking at that amen and it continues and says um it says and when it did what happened an old fellow came out of the W wilderness probably a beard grown all out and an old piece of sheep skin wrapped around him amen there was no conveniences out there in the wilderness amen he been there since he was 9 years old and he was 30 then come walking I'm sorry come walking out of the Wilderness stumping out preaching repentance standing in mud to his knees probably on the banks of Jordan and that's when the high places were made low and the Low Places made High see amen then he says you have to have spiritual understanding remember God never did and never will on this Earth dwell in glamour amen so he's not going to come how you expect him to come amen he it's not always going to be you know uh this great big grandiose thing amen it's not always going to be that amen cuz that's not how it works amen and we know he's the same yesterday today and forever so if people miss him because they are looking at the great big things to happen people are going to miss him in this time because of the same thing amen and it reads um I'm going continue he says God God never did and never will on this Earth drawn grammar glamour I'm sorry he's against it he never uh the great messages never will be make great big so and so and so and so it it didn't do that way his servants don't work in that manner his Glamour and glories of above amen because that's that's why the scripture says you know God's ways are foolish to men and men's ways are foolish to God it it's not compatible amen how can you expect it to be compatible amen you can't expect you know a man to man's ways to be compatible with God's ways because is is God Amen you can't expect it to be that way amen and um and another uh uh uh scripture hit my heart when I was uh looking at the ear which was uh you know Faith cometh by hearing you know hearing the word of God Amen and I would like to um brother Brenham speaks on this Amen in the quote in the perseverance sir in 1963 amen he says if if I told you to go out and put your hand on that tree and be healed you could doubt that he says so why he said we have no background to anything amen You' only have my word amen and if I told you that washing a certain water out here in the valley would bring healing to you it would depend on how much confidence you had in me amen see and Faith cometh by hearing hearing what the word of God Amen and he said something very key he said that it would depend on how much confidence you had me amen see that's what it is amen you have to have confidence amen and what is that confidence amen that confidence is Faith amen so so if if if you don't have confidence in the word of God Amen don't expect anything to happen amen don't don't expect anything don't don't expect anything from it am me because you know you reap what you sow mean if you're not reaping Faith don't expect anything to come out of you amen amen and I want to continue it says um therefore this be the word of God and it is he says he says what it teaches we can rest upon it amen because God cannot change amen God must forever remain God Amen his word must be as true in this age as it ever was in any age amen and that's why we can apply the promises in the other Church ages to us as well Amen to where um I believe it I believe it was in the Samaran chch age when he says you won't taste of the second death amen we can apply that to us us because we know that you know we're Bound for a Rapture amen we won't taste him the second death so that promise applies to us as well because he's the same guy as he was back then amen and I like to continue it says um so why does a priest have to worry about his ear amen see a priest must watch what he listens to amen because it affects your faith amen because what you're feeding on it it gives you preconceived notions of things in your life amen it what you're feeding on is what you get comfortable with amen and and what you're feeding on ends up you know uh going into your conversation amen and and we know that we know that a priest amen because we know that we are priests we know that the word of God must always be on our mouth amen we know that we always have to be at to teach kind am men amen amen and um I want to go to Malachi 2 verse 7 amen amen Malachi 2 verse 7 when you get there say Amen Malachi 2 ver7 all right amen it reads for the priest LPS should keep knowledge amen and what is that knowledge amen that's the knowledge of God Amen because if you go to a priest and you ask him a question that's like me going to brother Stephen and ask him a question he says I don't know that that just doesn't feel right amen you a priest should no amen you know what I'm saying amen so that's why so if if you're always feeding on the word amen then then you you'll know amen and and I'm not I'm not saying you may know the exact you know specific you very well may amen but the Lord will will direct you on how to answer the question amen because if you're if you're feeding on God Amen he'll give you wisdom amen and and we know that with wisdom being the main gift amen that and the next after that is what knowledge right after amen and we know that if you have wisdom you know how to use the knowledge that you have amen and and if you if you have that have that wisdom and we know we always try to say you know the major concern of a Believer is that you know I want to save other Souls amen I I want to bring other people in amen but what what are you saying you're saying that I don't have the wisdom to save them I don't have the way I don't know how to you know do this do that that's what you're saying amen and so the Lord says you have not because you ask not amen so what you want to do amen is is do what Solomon did and ask for wisdom amen and and what did he do amen he asked for it just obediently asked for it and what what happened he asked for the main thing and the lord gave him everything else amen so that's what we want to do amen amen so um I don't believe I finish reading it I want to go to uh 27 it says um verse two chapter 2: 7 it says for the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth amen so that's the feeding amen for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts amen so we know um there's also a quote I wasn't able to find it but I know for fact it's a quote because I've read it amen and brother bam says that you know when you're sent out you know into the world Amen you Believer by yourself individual when you're sent out amen you are the preacher to those people you are the messenger to those people so when you're at work amen you are the messenger to those people of the of the message of the hour amen because how else would they know it amen amen so that that's what you are when you go out that's why you are the messenger it says it it reads you are the messenger of the Lord of hosts amen and what do we know that what the what does the Lord of hosts mean amen that's that's that's when uh that's the Lord of uh uh the the general of the army that's his army amen and we know that when we go out into the world Amen we're we're we're not fighting flesh amen we're fighting powers and principalities amen and power rulers in high places amen so so this is you know this is a lot lot in this one scripture you know it's saying that you know we're priests amen and when we go out you know we should already be equipped amen with with the weapon the sword of the word amen to be able to go out and you know as a messenger of the Lord of Lord of hosts what is saying is we're ambassadors amen we are the ambassador of the Lord of hosts we're ambassador of the Lord's army we go out because we're fighting you know powers in high places we're fighting these demons am me the virtues going out of us amen but you know if if if you don't have input there's no output to H for it to come out amen you know if if you're not um feeding amen what you you have no strength to do anything amen that that that that's simple biology Amen Brother D preached that to us amen if you're not eating what do you expect to happen amen amen and um and I want to continue now amen into the um uh uh the hands amen um we know that you know a hand signifies your Works amen we know uh signifies your actions things you do for the Lord amen and we know that uh we are not saved solely by our works though but you do know that still our actions reflect what you have faith in amen you know um you know your actions reflect you know your stand amen you know um you know we can't make ourselves saved you know um it was decided before the foundation of the world Amen but works is Faith expressed amen you know if if you you know if you're feeding amen and and and if you're you know always in the in the atmosphere of the Lord amen you know your actions will display that amen you know that's why you know the dumbest thing I've ever heard was when people say you know oh you know it's already decided anyway so I'm just to live my life how I want to that's very stupid they mean like what what are you saying mean I mean that's like saying that you know oh my my parents love me I'm going do whatever I want like that that don't even make sense I mean while while while if you love your parents you know you would you would show that you express that love to your parents amen so so that you know that remark just shows where they're stand in the first place amen and um I you know um there's also you know uh when I was coming up in high school amen um there was this this uh this quote I saw I believe it like on like the uh the hallway and I always look at it you know it says that uh your your decisions reflect your priorities and I always I always kept that in the back part of my mind when I'm always choosing to do something because that has scriptural backing amen so if something has scriptural backing amen you don't throw it away you know you use it amen for your benefit amen so every time a major decision was going on in my life or you know I'll always go back to my decision reflect my priorities am so what is my priority my priority you know as a Christian is first Christ amen and then after that is my well-being amen so you know because everybody has their you know personal morals and things like that amen so I would always make sure that my decisions reflect my priorities amen and U you know cuz you can tell a lot about a person by the decisions amen you know you can tell a lot about somebody who claims to be a Christian but then when you get around them and you get behind you know that that closed door and you know they're not in church no more you know their decisions and their actions start to they're against the word and you say well you know it it doesn't add up amen and um that's why you know I want to remember go back to our topic amen it's the blood and the oil that's applied amen see to the hand amen so went over the ear now on the hand amen now the uh the the uh oil on the hand and the blood on the hand amen you know you that's applying you know the the Holy Ghost amen um so I have to continue uh it says uh you know everything we must everything we do must be sh sanctioned by the Lord amen um because it must pass through the inspection amen see um because we know that brother bam uh taught us that you know there's a seal amen and um when you're going through inspection you know uh there's there's an expector and you know um your Works amen they can only be you know sanctioned amen if that seal is on it amen so what do I mean when I say that what I'm saying is you know when you um say somebody is um that's telling you a story or they're sick or something's going on with their family amen and you want to pray over them amen so you know that um most of the time you know we do nothing except the Lord show us in the first place amen so that's your sanctioning amen that's your sanction to act amen so if you don't have that sanction to act amen then you ought not to act amen you ought not to try to do God a service with it without with it not being the time to do it amen you don't want to go ahead of God amen amen so um in closing amen um in in closing um I'll have to say you know um uh Abraham's Faith was sanctioned by the Lord right amen and um because of this very fact amen and what I want to uh highlight on is you we know the story of him sacrificing his son amen and I believe it was a burnt offering the Lord told him to give amen and if you look at a burnt offering you know because of time uh because in a burnt offering amen you you're supposed to have oil and when you have a burnt offering amen and also we know blood is is already going to be there because because you're killing a lamb amen and so because of this you know Abraham had the anointing oil with him the blood was about to be spilled amen and the Lord sanctioned his act amen by saying stop amen but because uh blood still had to be spilled he gave him a ram amen so I'm I'm going to read I'm going to read a quote from let me see where it is amen and um the musicians can come up amen um it reads it reads um in works his faith expressed in 1965 uh brother bham says he says um now the two men that were uh that were talking on faith Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham right but James Justified Abraham by what he saw in in Abraham amen so see now James said he's justified by his Works amen and Paul Paul said he's justified by faith his faith had Works see but see Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him he believed it amen but but then when he went to acting as though it was already done amen because what happened he said he said it we'll be back amen amen because so amen I'll continue he says he says that's what man saw in him amen and it continues he says and that's the same as it is to us amen because our works Express what faith we have amen but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it amen see You've Got to Believe In amen you cannot be afraid Amen to act amen see um I was you know I was with my uh my little brother and we're in the barber shop and the man asked you know talking to my little brother he said um you know oh ready for Christmas amen and you know being young you know he's just he didn't know how to answer the question so I answer for him I said we don't celebrate Christmas amen and you know um you can't be afraid to act you can't be afraid to stand on what you believe amen see we know that you know people they have their traditions of men amen they have their things that they do amen but you cannot be afraid to speak it am me you can't be afraid you know if you're a soldier in the Army amen that's how we say stay on the firing line keep marching amen you know if if you fall back amen you're losing ground amen you're giving ground to Satan amen and you give Satan an inch or take a mile amen so that's how we must walk circum respectfully carefully amen that's why in all things we must be ready you know to to you know uh uh um not act foolishly amen but be ready you know to stand what we believe amen and um and uh amen I'll uh I like to pray amen I like to pray I believe that's that's a Time amen I like to pray we didn't get to finish it we're in the hand amen um yes sir I like to pray amen uh our hearts amen um um father God we thank you Lord God for the word you've given us Lord God father God if there was anything said father God that um wasn't supposed to be said father God

dropping to an El Dorado amen amen oh my blessed be the name of the Lord I don't know how you can maneuver over there my friend you drop into a gold mine amen but you did wonderful because this is your first time dropping in such name amen amen this is an area that is Rich with Revelation Amen in other word every corner that you enter have something it looks like you get into a cave that is filled with diamond and now you're trying to tell us which Diamond to pull so as you going with this there is another one shining and as you're trying to touch this one there is another one shining this will take months to get into this scripture but you did wonderful my friend I don't know how you can go from a hand all the way to the to the th amen keep on digging my friend amen the blood and the oil that are put together amen upon the ear upon the thumb upon the foot of the priest amen so your hearing have to be affected so when you save your salvation affect your hearing are we together he affects also show your work and he affects your walk am amen and when the Holy Spirit Come on top of that it will affect also your way of hearing now you are hearing by the holy spirit amen and your hand your Works your expression of Faith now is also by the Holy Spirit and your walk where you going when you going into a neighborhood and you thought that the airplane stopped there by any chances then your work begin to be directed by the oil and the oil begin to tell you keep on moving keep on moving keep on moving because a jimama mama was sitting right there that pray for the airplane to come down and the oil will direct you over there amen Oh Glory to God if I read this scripture you will see more than this because I saw the scripture and I skip it and I left it alone and here he came and touched did you notice it's coming from Exodus 29 do you remember we touched CH so this 29 and I never touch that I skip it I deliberately avoid it because I know there was something there and here the Holy Spirit comes and touch it you will see even brother BR Ministry laying right here amen if I open it you want to go home so let me let you go home but it's right here you will see even the way brother Bram operate in his ministry it is locked inside the scripture because remember he read Exodus 29 that was the priest are we together but where he read in Leviticus that was not the priest sorry sister Olivia should I tell [Laughter] them uh open Leviticus 14 before somebody starts shooting me text in the morning open Leviticus 14 oh boy oh boy boy boy amen he read Exodus 29 Exodus 29 it's clearly the consecration of a priest when you're consecrating the priest you take the blood and the oil you mix it together you put it on the ear of the priest and you put it on the thumb and you put it on the foot that I was the priest amen look at Leviticus 14 because he read Leviticus 14 down the road but go back to verse one I'm going to let you go amen amen if you dare you can say Amen are we together now we together verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his what so the cleansing of a leper had the same application as the hallowing or the consecration of the priest now you see now I just told you amen so Exodus 29 was the priesthood being anointed amen but the leper brother BR say leprosy it's a type of sin right so when The Sinner comes so the ministry have to be anointed first ah now you start pulling amen the ministry have to be anointed first and the ministry there is two type of a Ministry come on there is a fivefold Ministry amen but there is also a priest of a messenger of the age yes sir sir are we together are we together are we together that's why brother Bram say the light come through the messenger first and then from the messenger the light will go through others that have been Faithfully taught five for Ministry but they must be Faithfully taught am amen that's why you have the high priest and the priest together that are anointed did in the same way and brother Bram in one way he said the high priest is the messenger are we together and God give him the access to the Mana brother Bram said because the Mana is the food that he can feed [Applause] others have I lost you do you have time or [Applause] not okay somebody don't want it do you have time [Applause] [Music] on you blame brother Charles that's right are we together are we together exod all of these came when I was sitting right there listening to him amen all right Exodus 29 is the consecration of the priest amen yes but there is two division in the priest we have the high priest amen and we have also the priest plural all the high priest and the priest both of them are we together need to be Anointed with oil and with blood and they apply that on the ear on the T and on the foot are we together so the high priest here is a messenger yes to your age are we together and the priest here is the far for Ministry GL are we together are we together are we together so no priest can preach the gospel without being saved I'm going to go slowly because these things are coming up now you whoever oliv open the pipe or something are we together a priest is born a priest amen but even though you are born a priest you cannot enter the work without being consecrated your gift as of a Ministry you are born with it but before you express or you work or you put yourself on the work of the Lord you must be saved by the blood and also filled by the Holy Spirit you must have the blood and the oil applied to you are we together because brother Bram was and brother Bram was filled with the holy spirit so the high priest problem was already done the problem is the far for Ministry we need to make sure they are saved and they are also filled with the holy spirit because brother brand I'm saying no one can stand behind the pulit if you have never met the pillar of fire are we together are we together are we together so the blood amen and the oil amen must be applied to both the high priest and it must be applied also to the priest are we together but on Leviticus now 14 it's no longer the priest now the priest is consecrated the high priest is consecrated now the priest and the high priest they can now exert the ministry to save the leop to save The Sinner because let proceed sin now they can apply the same faith upon the sinners now they can bring the same gospel to The Sinner which gospel the gospel of blood and oil we preaching salvation and the baptism of the Holy Spirit are we together are we together job to verse 25 I'm going to let you go home my friend jum to verse 25 of Leviticus 14 it's about the leper now the leper the leper leprosy tap sin we went through this before now this is to The Sinner are we together but watch The Sinner also is Anointed the same way amen the sin also receive blood in the ear to him that have an ear so you have an ear but that year need to be saved and then that year need to be anointed by the holy spirit so that you can have the hearing of Faith are we together are we together do you know that the Bible said the God have uh prepar us for work do you remember in Ephesian that he he already predestinated us unto good works before the foundation of the world so your Works was already there but it need to to be anointed you need to be Sav and anointed then the anointing activate the Divine work of God in your life then your work change are we together let's go to verse 25 I'm going to let you go home if you thereare you can say amen and he shall kill remember the priest they killed the ram look at this and he shall kill the lamb both of them are the same right but one is a mature one and he shall kill the Lamb of the trespass offering and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed are we together are we together let me leave it amen and upon the T of his right hand if you notice everything goes to the the right hand am for some reason because even Jesus when he went he went to the right hand of God are we together Jesus went to the right hand of God are we together even this photo this picture here they have to turn it to the right everything goes to the right are we together are we together jum to verse uh we on 25 and upon the great toe of his right foot everything to the right I hope you can swallow this one 26 and the preach shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own what follow me carefully everything is done on which which hand the right side but the priest that is now cleansing the leper must take oil and put it on which hand which hand had the discernment of brother Bram are we together which hand had the discernment of brother Bram why did Brother Bram discernment was on the left hand because the Holy Spirit was using the left hand to discern sickness and send vibration and the vibration from Brother Bram will neutralize the sickness and tell you that you were you were completely here it was the oil upon the palm of the priest on the left hand this Ministry is perfectly in line with the Bible this message is the truth this message is Christ this message belong to the Bible are we together are we together did brother brother may ever give you the scripture but the Holy Ghost he touched the top and now we digging into it now his ministry become manifest through the light of the scripture the priest is putting his his his uh his anointed all way on the left hand why everything was going to the right amen amen amen are we together and brother Bram have to bring the people to the right hand and the angel was standing from which side which side the right side sir yes sir okay my right don't worry my friend I'm going to let you go home verse 27 and the preach shall shall sprinkle with his right hand some of the old that is left hand uh some of the old that is in his left hand how many times let's stop right there my friend let's stop just right there because we're going to get into something here amen amen amen so the same anointing the priest is Anointed the high priest is Anointed the priest is Anointed and every sinner that comes we bring them to the same gospel to the same process amen because they they have leprosy they got sin that's the way you cleanse them amen and the true cleansing will cleanse your earring you won't hear this gospel the same way like before this message will become a new music a new tune a new book because your ears has been open up why because your ear has been saved and now you are hearing by Revelation and your action your hands is going by Revelation and everywhere you going with your foot when you put your foot footprint means possession you are getting into ground everything is working together for good are we together are we together God richly bless you let's stand so we can pray we don't want to go too far this scripture is powerful my friend I don't know how you're going to preach this in one sermon amen but he did good to stop where you got to stop because it's absolutely impossible to preach this in one day we did this quickly but if we sit down and we go slowly that's it you will forget the five Garment of Joseph who will be somewhere again deep into something amen it's just showing you that this work of redemption is perfectly in line the enemy is multiplying his attack to discredit the message to discredit credit brother Branham to try to pull young people and people away from the message he put pressure on Minister not to read the quote anymore until preacher are even uncomfortable Pastor uncomfortable with the message amen this message we not following caringly devis Fable made by men I don't know when people read the message what where they read reading when I was reading the message I was amazed when I was new in the message I say how can this man be so accurate with the scripture like this that's what the me that that's the way the message was coming to me and the more I read brother BR the more I begin to respect my Bible I don't even tolerate somebody to put a key on the Bible because I see people when they bring their Bible they put it in a key or cell phone is there I don't tolerate even that because of what brother brandham taught me no one taught me to be to to to to to be so in love and respect the scripture like brother Bram so I don't know what they talking about but if it was not for you if you were not predestined ated for it it's not going to work for you but as for me and my house Hallelujah and this church we already signed the contract my friend I ain't going back this church the Bible and the message of the hour from Giver to [Applause] Giver am brother Bram say this brother Bram say this brother Bram want contradict himself it is you that contradict yourself in your own mind if you let the oil of the spirit of God to come into it you will see the two Cod reconciling together and bringing and shedding more light and before you know it the message has a continuity everything is dove telling and entering in the scripture and it's so beautiful and I don't see any area in our life that the message doesn't affect I don't see it I don't see even things that I never thought I say how am I going to answer this before you know it a come before you know it the scripture come before you know it here brother Bram say something and brother Bram sometime will say one thing and that one thing can be apply to 10 area if you can catch the spirit of the Lord stop listening to the craziness on What's happen the craziness online me I already made a decision my friend if I ever hear you that you left this message or you got problem with this message I won't even waste one second to listen or to watch you or to read watch all all all all your report I don't have time for that from the church we left I never have any time to go sit and watch the Exposition that they gave I don't have time my time is so precious that I need more time to invest in the Bible in the message than to listen to [Music] foolishness amen amen amen may God save our ears may he save our hands may he save our feet may he save our whole being yeah so that we serve him Church keep Center amen the first Trump we went
