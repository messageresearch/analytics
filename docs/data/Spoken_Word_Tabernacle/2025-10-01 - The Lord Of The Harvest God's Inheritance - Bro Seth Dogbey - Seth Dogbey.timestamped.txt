[23:06] Dear Jesus Christ, Lord, we truly thank

[23:13] tomorrow.
[23:15] Oh dear God, King of kings,
[23:18] Lord of lords. You're the God of all
[23:21] gods. You're the author of Genesis. The
[23:24] one who speaks anything must happen. Who
[23:27] is like you, Lord?
[23:30] We thank you for a wonderful time that
[23:32] you have given us yesterday. Father, a
[23:35] time of refreshing of our hearts, of our
[23:38] souls. Oh, Father God, what a tremendous
[23:41] thing that prayer can do. Father, when
[23:43] we just come in that secret place
[23:46] between me and you, my brother, my
[23:49] sister, and you, Father God, that moment
[23:52] of prayer that we have so many times
[23:54] been deceived by the devil not to go
[23:56] into. But yesterday, Lord God, you
[23:59] showed us, Father, what a precious
[24:01] moment they are. Oh God, when we can
[24:05] just close ourselves, oh Father God, and
[24:07] speak to our maker, dear Jesus, thank
[24:10] you, Father. Thank you for this
[24:12] inspiration that you have sent to our

[24:16] great things happen among us Lord.

[24:28] for making that possible yesterday. Lord
[24:31] you've opened up an avenue especially
[24:33] for me and I know for my brother and
[24:35] sister Lord God to see how prayer can
[24:38] change things. Father God, we want to
[24:41] remember sister our precious sister Ed's
[24:44] mother. Father, tonight Lord, may you go
[24:47] to her, Father. What is a stroke, Lord
[24:50] Jesus,
[24:51] in Genesis 18, you created four bodies
[24:55] and you, Father God went into them. What
[24:58] is, oh God, a stroke, Lord Jesus, to
[25:01] you. Just speak the word, Lord, and all
[25:04] will be made right Lord God. We expect
[25:07] to receive results, oh Father God,
[25:09] testimonies, oh Lord, that you've
[25:12] changed the situation, oh Father God,

[25:24] that give cheerfully. May you multiply
[25:26] as you multiply the fish and the loaves,
[25:28] Father God, when you were here on in
[25:30] your body, Lord. May you do the same
[25:32] thing for us today. continue to bless
[25:35] the service, Father God. Take Brother
[25:37] Seth out of the way, Lord. And may you
[25:39] use the gift, Father. Oh, dear Jesus.

[25:44] know the need that this church has
[25:46] tonight, Father. We did not come to see
[25:49] a man, but we came to see you, Lord. May
[25:51] you take your son out of the way and use
[25:54] the gift that you have placed within
[25:56] him. Father, we thank you once again as
[25:58] we turn the service back into your hands
[26:01] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen.

[37:58] That was not just a song.

[38:05] &gt;&gt; of what you believe.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for the preacher
[38:10] to pray for you.

[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[39:17] and he hears me. Yes, he helps me. He is
[39:22] faithful
[39:23] and true. Oh, forget his
[39:30] companion,

[40:10] you and he came down from his glory and

[44:26] The great is the glory.
[44:33] Praise God. Praise
[44:37] God. Glory to God. Amen.
[44:42] Amen. Amen. What an atmosphere tonight.
[44:47] It make you forget all the traffic and
[44:50] everything. Amen. Everything the devil
[44:53] was throwing in our in our in our path
[44:56] like what is going on? But everything is
[44:58] all right. I was debating. I wanted to
[45:00] say I don't know why I become a little
[45:03] shy,
[45:05] &gt;&gt; but the Lord didn't want me to speak it
[45:08] out. So maybe we keep that for Sunday.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Do you have a song request for
[45:16] Sunday?
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:20] Song request. De get under my feet.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Satan stay there.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Not get stay there.
[45:29] You stay under my feet. Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says singing it's
[45:35] a way of preaching the gospel.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; If you need a quote, you see me, I will
[45:39] give it to you. Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Wonderful job, musician.
[45:43] Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray God. I say, may you fill
[45:46] again these pews with angels. And here
[45:48] they are.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I got a late prayer request
[45:52] here from brother Enoch. He said, please
[45:55] pray for my friend Marcus. He's been
[45:58] battling brain cancer and was just
[46:01] declared terminal ill and they are going
[46:04] to to move him to the hospice. The
[46:08] hospital gave him six months to leave.
[46:11] He has a wife and a child praying for
[46:14] God to put his hands on him and heal him
[46:18] because he's capable of doing more than
[46:21] just to heal him. Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; We believe in the miraculous. We had a
[46:26] wonderful praise and so in the prayer
[46:29] yesterday if you miss it next time just
[46:31] hop on. Amen. God is working in a
[46:35] miraculous way and there is nothing too
[46:37] there's no storm too powerful that God
[46:41] cannot handle. Amen. There is a reason
[46:43] why he had to work with this person or
[46:45] be a friend to this person because God
[46:48] knew in the time of trouble somebody
[46:49] will stand for it. So let's pray
[46:51] together for this prayer request. Amen.
[46:54] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[46:56] approaching you again humbly this
[46:58] evening, Lord. Father, thanking you for
[47:01] your grace, for your love, your mercy,
[47:03] and for your presence tonight, Lord,
[47:06] because we can feel it. We can, Lord,
[47:08] Father, sense your presence. And we
[47:10] thank you for being in the midst of us.
[47:12] And every time we meet here, there is
[47:15] not one time that you failed to be here,
[47:17] Lord. Father we are approaching you
[47:19] again Lord with this prayer request on
[47:22] behalf of our brother for his friend
[47:24] Lord. Father you know what is going on.
[47:27] The doctor said the best that they could
[47:29] but Lord Father the absolute doctor is
[47:32] you because you're the only one that
[47:34] have the power to decide on the life of
[47:37] someone Lord. Father Lord Jesus Christ
[47:39] we are approaching you. You're the God
[47:41] who is rich in mercy. asking you that
[47:44] you touch this man from this brain
[47:46] cancer. Lord, Father, I claim the blood
[47:49] of the lamb upon the church praying and
[47:51] Lord, Father, we rebuke this cancer.
[47:54] Lord, may he leave Lord, Father, this
[47:56] man in a supernatural way by the power
[47:59] of the Holy Spirit. Father, I've seen
[48:02] patient Lord that was affected by cancer
[48:05] totally here Lord and coming back to the
[48:07] office Lord. Father, I pray Lord,
[48:09] Father, that your hand may move in a
[48:12] supernatural way, Lord, and have mercy
[48:14] upon this wife and the child, Lord.
[48:16] Father, that they are about to lose
[48:18] their daddy so that you can change,
[48:20] Lord, Father, the situation. Come on the
[48:23] sin, Lord, and make him know just Lord,
[48:25] Father, that you are a healer, but you
[48:28] are also Lord, Father, the savior of the
[48:31] soul, Lord. Father, bring him closer
[48:33] unto thee, Lord. I pray in the name of
[48:35] Jesus Christ that this prayer request
[48:38] Lord be turned unto a praise report by
[48:41] the power of the Holy Spirit in the name
[48:44] of Jesus Christ. Father we humbly ask it
[48:46] and commit everything unto thy hand with
[48:49] faith as you told us to ask Lord and to
[48:52] believe Lord in the name of Jesus
[48:54] Christ. Amen. We greet you all in the
[48:58] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[49:00] Jesus Christ both visible and invisible
[49:03] audience. Amen. Any family member here,
[49:07] new subscribers online? Numbers keep
[49:09] going up. God richly bless you and
[49:12] welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle and
[49:14] precisely to our convention on
[49:17] Wednesday. I was coming up with a huge
[49:19] traffic. I don't know what was going on.
[49:22] There was nothing on the road. A huge
[49:24] traffic and I was praying. I said,
[49:25] "Lord, may you open the road for the
[49:27] people that are coming to church to make
[49:29] sure they made it on time." But God
[49:32] grace was there and we have overcomers
[49:34] tonight. Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Everybody can see their
[49:38] season in the midst of chaos.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; You need to change the way you looking
[49:46] at things in your life. Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] How can David say goodness and mercy
[49:53] will follow me when
[49:57] &gt;&gt; how can goodness and mercy be there when
[49:59] you seek?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Because David didn't say some days of my
[50:05] life.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; He took all the span of his time that
[50:10] was given to him. In other words, David
[50:12] is telling you from A to Z,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; if you look in my life, you will see
[50:17] goodness and mercy.
[50:19] But the devil have trained us so much
[50:21] for years that in the days of our life
[50:24] we can tell what is bad
[50:26] &gt;&gt; and we remember all the bad time. But
[50:29] David look he say I see goodness and
[50:32] mercy. Amen. Goodness everything is
[50:36] going good and mercy even when things
[50:38] are going bad is the God rich in mercy.
[50:41] Learn to see goodness and mercy in every
[50:45] circumstance in your life. Whether it
[50:48] looks bad to our way, our perception,
[50:51] whether it looks good, God is there.
[50:54] Because being trained to only look on
[50:56] the wrong way, you're going to miss your
[50:58] season
[50:59] &gt;&gt; because the shepherd can take you to the
[51:02] valley of the shadow of death.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And you wonder, how did I get here? It
[51:08] was the shepherd.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; He was the shepherd.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; How did you end up where you are now?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; It's the shepherd. Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; How how are you the person you are
[51:18] today?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Some of us never thought we're going to
[51:21] be here.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; You thought you going to live in another
[51:24] state or whatever. God move you move
[51:26] roof from another country, from another
[51:28] state, from another city and everything
[51:30] and put you to Did you ever thought you
[51:32] going to be living in the place you're
[51:34] living today?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Did you have even in the mind that okay,
[51:38] the house I'm living in now was the
[51:40] house that I'm going to be living in.
[51:42] You thought you're going to live in
[51:43] another house and then you find yourself
[51:44] in a different house. And so everything
[51:46] has been orchestrated by the master. And
[51:50] if you are somebody who's always paying
[51:53] attention to the negative, the devil is
[51:55] really good at that. Amen. The first
[51:58] thing he does after service is begin to
[52:00] throw some negative thing just to keep
[52:02] your attention away from what God is
[52:04] doing.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember in the midst of chaos
[52:08] before you panic,
[52:11] Yes, sir.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Before you get upset, sir.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Before you start getting frustrated and
[52:16] speaking things that are not supposed to
[52:18] to be coming out of your mouth,
[52:20] &gt;&gt; push the brake
[52:22] &gt;&gt; and look, you say, "What is going on?
[52:25] What is the blessing that is coming in
[52:27] this time that the devil begin to upset
[52:30] everything left and right?" Because
[52:32] Satan doesn't upset me like that. If he
[52:35] start upsetting this and this and this
[52:38] somehow there must be something God is
[52:40] about to deliver.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And because God is about to deliver
[52:45] something, that's the reason why he's
[52:46] throwing everything out of so you can be
[52:49] taken off by that and miss what God is
[52:53] bringing unto you. If you go listen to
[52:56] the message, I believe u either uh is
[53:00] there anything too hard from the Lord on
[53:03] something? Brother Brandham says that uh
[53:05] Abraham and Sarah was giving him a hard
[53:09] time and almost miss the visitation of
[53:12] the Lord because things were not going
[53:15] right. Everything was dwindling and and
[53:18] a rough time with Abraham and it was the
[53:20] time that God was coming down in Genesis
[53:23] 18 and because of that Sarah was
[53:25] fasting. Look at Mrs. Lot over there.
[53:27] She prospered. She's over there. And
[53:29] Sodom didn't even know Sodom is going to
[53:31] be burned.
[53:33] Lot is going to lose everything and he's
[53:36] going to get into a disaster. And God
[53:38] was coming to visit Abraham and to
[53:40] change even the body and bring the
[53:42] solution to Sarah for something Sarah
[53:45] has been waiting for years. God was
[53:47] bringing it and the devil was upsetting
[53:50] Sarah rather trying to make Sarah to
[53:52] lose the blessing of the Lord. Amen. So
[53:55] when chaos or things are going out
[53:57] together, chill out, relax. Patient are
[54:01] cancelling. That's okay. Go back. You'll
[54:03] find something to do quickly. The Holy
[54:06] Spirit is doing something correctly.
[54:09] There is nothing.
[54:11] Amen. Even though it seems like it's
[54:14] adequate, we will understand it better
[54:17] by and by. But God told you this is the
[54:20] season
[54:21] &gt;&gt; and the season may come as a blessing in
[54:24] disguisement. When you look it's dark
[54:27] but approach it closely you will see
[54:29] it's angel wings that are beating
[54:32] together.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have even a quote brother
[54:37] Brandham say tension is a blessing.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know that quote?
[54:43] &gt;&gt; How can tension? Do you know that quote?
[54:45] If you don't I put it in the group chat.
[54:47] Do you know that quote? How can tension
[54:49] be a blessing? Who want tension? How can
[54:52] tension be a blessing? And brother
[54:54] Brandham say without that tension, I
[54:56] could not be where I am.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; You don't know that quot.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; So what do you think it is? Is it
[55:04] tension really? One bird that uses the
[55:07] storm to go up is an eagle. Amen. Take
[55:12] it and go up. And after a while, when
[55:14] everything's said and done, you will sit
[55:16] down. You say, "Now I see what is going
[55:19] on and what was it all about." It's not
[55:22] about God destroying you. It's about God
[55:25] trying to bring a blessing. And when he
[55:28] trying to bring a blessing, this is the
[55:29] time Satan will rise and try to kill
[55:32] every child that is two year old down
[55:35] thinking he's going to get the Messiah.
[55:37] Did he get the Messiah?
[55:40] But Satan didn't know there was already
[55:42] a prophecy that prophesied in the Old
[55:45] Testament that Rachel is weeping for the
[55:47] children.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; So was Satan fulfilling prophecy or was
[55:51] Satan? You see now? So all of that was
[55:54] already in the word of God.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those children will be saved.
[55:58] Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So look through God eyes and don't focus
[56:03] on what the devil is doing. Amen.
[56:05] Brother Set is preaching tonight. But
[56:08] they said trustee, song leader,
[56:12] preacher,
[56:13] musician. I don't know what else God
[56:16] already know. Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how he's doing all of
[56:20] that.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's nothing but the miracle
[56:24] of the Lord. Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And the last time was so good.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Very good that we can't even wait to
[56:30] hear tonight.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[58:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus

[58:42] is here.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, and all things are possible.
[58:53] Jesus
[58:55] is here.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus
[59:02] is here.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus
[59:08] is here
[59:11] and all things are possible.
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] Jesus
[59:22] is here.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you very much, musicians. Uh
[59:29] we just want to appreciate you for the
[59:31] wonderful work you've been doing. Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um even as we have our Bibles turn
[59:37] to Psalm 127. Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Psalm 127 verse 3-5.
[59:45] Amen.
[59:51] Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Psalm 127:3-5.
[59:54] Um, but before that, let's just have a
[59:56] word of prayer. Father, in the name of
[59:59] Jesus, we are grateful, Lord, to be in
[1:00:01] your presence tonight, Lord. Father,
[1:00:03] even as we open your word, Lord Jesus,
[1:00:05] may you break the bread, Lord Jesus,
[1:00:07] tonight we ask, Father, may you take me
[1:00:10] aside, Lord, and speak your word, Lord.
[1:00:12] I have no word for your children
[1:00:14] tonight, Lord. But your children are
[1:00:17] desiring to hear from you, Lord. Father,
[1:00:19] may your spirit quicken every reading of
[1:00:22] this word and every quote, Lord Jesus,
[1:00:24] oh God, that you've laid, oh God,
[1:00:26] tonight, Lord. Father, may you move in
[1:00:29] our lives, Lord Jesus, and do its
[1:00:31] wonderful miraculous work, Lord. Father,
[1:00:34] people are in here, Lord Jesus. Oh God,
[1:00:36] those also listening online, Lord, have
[1:00:39] expectations tonight, Lord. Father, we
[1:00:41] don't come to your presence living the
[1:00:43] same, Lord. We come to your presence
[1:00:45] being satisfied, Lord, and be full, oh
[1:00:48] God. Father, full of joy, Lord Jesus. Oh
[1:00:51] God, we ask, Father God, may your
[1:00:53] blessings be upon us tonight, Lord. We
[1:00:55] thank you, Lord. We bless you in Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ's name we prayed. Amen and amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalm 127 verse 3-5.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And Bible says, "Lo,
[1:01:10] children
[1:01:12] sir,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; children
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; are an heritage of the Lord."
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Now, heritage is an inherent an
[1:01:20] inheritance.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; It said, "And the fruit of the womb is
[1:01:26] his reward."
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Correct.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; As arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[1:01:31] man,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; so are children of the youth.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; of the youth. Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So when we've got youth in our church,
[1:01:38] Amen. we've got some weapons, amen,
[1:01:41] against the devil. Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Happy is the man
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; that have his quiver full of them.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; They shall not be ashamed, but they
[1:01:54] shall speak with the enemies in the
[1:01:57] gate."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Can we be seated tonight?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Arrows.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, we've got some weapons
[1:02:05] tonight. Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see the children growing,
[1:02:10] anytime we have a baby shower,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; the Lord is presenting or is announcing
[1:02:17] some arrows. Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Let's open to Psalm 94. Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Psalm 94.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Psalm 94. Amen. verse 12
[1:02:35] to 14.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; If we're there, we can say amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; It says, "Blessed is the man whom thou
[1:02:44] chestnut." Amen, oh Lord. And teachest
[1:02:47] him out of thy law. That's right.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That thou mayest give him rest from the
[1:02:52] days of adversity.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Until the pit be for the wicked.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. For the Lord will not cast off
[1:03:02] his people,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; neither will he forsake his inheritance.
[1:03:07] That's right.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Now, we saw that children are the Lord's
[1:03:11] inheritance.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And Bible says that he's not going to
[1:03:16] forsake his inheritance.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It means that those children belongs to
[1:03:23] him.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; It is something that he has. It's
[1:03:26] something that he possesses. They are
[1:03:28] his property.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And Bible says he's not going to forsake
[1:03:32] that.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Let's say you have something that
[1:03:35] belongs to you and it is yours.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Just imagine how you protect that.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; So just imagine you being a child of the
[1:03:44] most high.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He said ye are God's and children of the
[1:03:48] most high.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; So just imagine how God is going to
[1:03:51] protect you
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; being a child of God. the hedge of
[1:03:56] protection that he has around you
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; as a child of God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; So, even as we we ponder on that, let's
[1:04:03] go to the book of Joshua. Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; We we we we just uh skipped certain
[1:04:08] things the last time. Uh we just want to
[1:04:11] bring it in tonight. Amen. Joshua
[1:04:13] chapter 2.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:04:24] Joshua chapter 2. Yes,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; we are going to read from verse 1 to13.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the story of the spies
[1:04:33] coming to Rahab.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And remember from the last time as the
[1:04:39] prophet said that when the Lord comes to
[1:04:41] you, Amen. He's interested in everything
[1:04:45] that you have.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; He's interested in every door. Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; He's interested in everything that
[1:04:51] belongs to you.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are seeing an example of a
[1:04:56] child of God. Even when the spies came,
[1:05:00] we didn't know that she was a child of
[1:05:01] God. But there was something inside of
[1:05:04] her
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; that was portraying that she was a child
[1:05:07] of God. Amen. So let's see how a child
[1:05:10] of God behaves.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; So this is Joshua chapter 1 verse 13.
[1:05:18] And Joshua the son of Nan sent out of
[1:05:20] Shadim two men to spy secretly,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; saying, "Go view the land,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; even Jericho."
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they went and came into an
[1:05:32] hallowed house named Rahabh
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; and lodged there. And it was told the
[1:05:38] king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
[1:05:42] came men in hither tonight
[1:05:45] of the children of Israel to search out
[1:05:48] the country. Now verse three, and the
[1:05:52] king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying,
[1:05:55] Bring forth the men that are come to
[1:05:57] thee, which are entered into thine
[1:05:59] house, thine house, for they be come to
[1:06:04] search out all the country. Verse four,
[1:06:07] it said, "And the woman took the two men
[1:06:10] and hid them."
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Now, this is Rahab. Yes, sir.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Anything that comes into my house
[1:06:18] belongs to me.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; So, when God is bringing a blessing, it
[1:06:23] is my property. If you are coming to
[1:06:25] take it away from me,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I have a protection around it. I am
[1:06:30] going to keep it because I know what
[1:06:33] blessing is coming to me.
[1:06:36] Amen. And we will see what Rahab said.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; So, and the woman took the two men and
[1:06:43] hid them and said, "Thus,
[1:06:46] there came men unto me, but I was not
[1:06:50] whence they were."
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, she was hiding them. And it
[1:06:54] came to pass about the time of shutting
[1:06:57] of the gate.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it was dark that the men went
[1:07:02] out, wither the men went not. Pursue
[1:07:07] after them quickly, for ye shall
[1:07:09] overtake them. Amen. So the king is is
[1:07:12] is trying to say that let's let's um
[1:07:15] hasten to go get this men cuz they they
[1:07:17] might escape. Amen. But she had brought
[1:07:20] them up to the roof of the house and hid
[1:07:24] them with the stalks of flax
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; which she had laid in order upon the
[1:07:29] roof.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she hid the men such that
[1:07:33] nobody could see them. Amen. And the men
[1:07:36] pursued after them the way to Jordan
[1:07:39] onto the forts. And as soon as they
[1:07:41] which pursued after them were gone out,
[1:07:44] they shut the gate. And before they were
[1:07:46] laid down, she came up unto them upon
[1:07:49] the roof.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Now let's see what happens.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And she said unto the men,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I know,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; I know
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; that the Lord have given you the land.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; And that your terror is falling upon us
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:08:13] faint because of you.
[1:08:15] She's not um testifying.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. For we have heard
[1:08:22] how the Lord dried up the water of the
[1:08:26] Red Sea for you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; When he came out of Egypt,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; and what he did unto the two kings of
[1:08:33] the Amorites that were on the other side
[1:08:36] Jordan,
[1:08:37] Sion and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
[1:08:42] And as soon as we had heard,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; so somebody says heard,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; heard.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And as soon as we have heard these
[1:08:49] things,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; our hearts did melt.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Melt.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Neither did there remain any more
[1:08:55] courage in any man because of you.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; For the Lord your God, he is God in
[1:09:02] heaven above
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; and in earth beneath. That's right.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; So this is the testimony.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Of somebody who just heard.
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody who just heard
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; not having the experience she just
[1:09:19] heard. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, I pray you swear unto me
[1:09:27] by the Lord, since I have showed you
[1:09:30] kindness, that we will also show that ye
[1:09:34] will also show kindness unto my father's
[1:09:36] house and give me a true talking.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; She's asking for a true talking.
[1:09:47] and that ye will save a life. My father,
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; my mother,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; my brethren,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; my sisters, and all that they have
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and deliver our lives from death.
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; You and your house.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Your mother. So my mother, my father, my
[1:10:15] siblings and all what they have,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; all my cousins,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; all of them, my first cousins, my second
[1:10:22] cousins, all of them, my granddaddy.
[1:10:25] Amen. I am speaking onto their lives.
[1:10:28] Amen. And even the neighbor that came to
[1:10:31] me, amen. I am proclaiming healing.
[1:10:35] Amen. Onto their life. When I go to
[1:10:37] school, all my acquaintances that come
[1:10:40] around me, I said, "Hey, I'm a child of
[1:10:42] God and have the overflow of the
[1:10:45] blessings of God." Amen. So, because you
[1:10:48] are close to me, that I receive you as
[1:10:52] part of my blessings because I am hiding
[1:10:55] you in the blessings that was proclaimed
[1:10:58] to me, that was given to me.
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] Wonderful.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; So this is from the message
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; so I will be with thee.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet said why
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; thou and thy house
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; certainly
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; thy house shall be saved with thee.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Certainly
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; thy house
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; shall be saved with thee.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Certainly
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; thy house shall be saved with thee.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "Why?"
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; If you've got faith enough to have
[1:11:39] yourself saved, you can have faith
[1:11:42] enough for your family to be saved.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Thou and thy house.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "Look at Rahab."
[1:11:51] Rahab said, "Have mercy upon me.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Spare me.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want to die with this
[1:11:58] unbelievers."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Rahab is calling the others
[1:12:03] unbelievers because she has heard.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; She's declared that she's a believer.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want to die as an animal. Amen.
[1:12:12] I want to die in the arms of Jehovah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I believe your God because he's both God
[1:12:19] of heaven and earth.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He does visible things.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; He makes things real.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; I never seen him do it.
[1:12:30] I never seen him do it.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; But I believe it anyhow.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; So, this is a situation where she's not
[1:12:42] even seen it before,
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; but she believes it
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; regardless of whatever condition that
[1:12:50] comes. Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; We don't sometimes need to have evidence
[1:12:55] of of of it being happen happening
[1:12:57] before. Amen. But because we believe in
[1:13:00] Jehovah, we've not seen him heal such a
[1:13:03] case before. But because we believe it,
[1:13:07] the Lord is going to do it.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I never seen him do it, but I
[1:13:13] believe it anyhow." See, she had never
[1:13:16] seen Joshua.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; She just heard of Joshua.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; So you be like, "Oh, well, I've I've not
[1:13:26] had an experience to see the angel of
[1:13:28] the Lord or neither have I had any
[1:13:30] experience of the pillar of fire coming
[1:13:32] to my room and all those things."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; But you've heard the the word of the
[1:13:38] Lord.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; You heard the preaching of the gospel.
[1:13:42] That is all what you need
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; to take possession of what belongs to
[1:13:47] you.
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So, so the prophet said she never seen
[1:13:54] God.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Never seen God.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So the prophet is saying
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; she never seen Joshua.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Now he's saying she never seen God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; So when you see Joshua,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; you've seen God. Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Because you remember Joshua one time was
[1:14:14] a spy
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; who went to the land
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; and came back with a testimony that they
[1:14:22] were able to take the land.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Now Joshua represent Christ.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also sends a spy or also sent
[1:14:30] spies. Amen. To go and attest of the
[1:14:34] goodness of the Lord.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Let's go on. Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; It said she just heard. Others have seen
[1:14:45] it and she believed by hearing it. Now
[1:14:48] said, I want favor for me and my father,
[1:14:51] my mother. They are both old and
[1:14:53] crippled up.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; I've got some brethren.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; I want to have faith for them.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "And the the
[1:15:02] preacher."
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The preacher with the word of the Lord.
[1:15:08] Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So you remember one time Joshua was also
[1:15:11] a spy
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; who was having that evidence that we are
[1:15:15] able to take the land
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and also remember our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; when he came down was a preacher.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He was also a spy that we are able to
[1:15:27] take the land.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Said yes he's coming this way and we are
[1:15:33] going to take the land. Now, if you want
[1:15:35] to get them saved, get them in the
[1:15:37] house.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you believe it, go get
[1:15:41] them. Get them in here. For will not be
[1:15:45] responsible if they in the street.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; So, God has a specific place
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; that he has appointed that you must
[1:15:53] bring the people in.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; As long as there's a believer in the
[1:15:58] house, that believer is hiding the spy.
[1:16:02] Amen. that is the preacher of the
[1:16:04] gospel. So bring everything in that fold
[1:16:08] so that they get saved.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So this from the message Hebrews
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; chapter 7
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; the prophet said and any minister
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; that sent out under the inspiration of
[1:16:29] the king of heaven
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the preacher now.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Under the inspiration of the king of
[1:16:35] heaven will not go for money.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Neither will he go to make big churches.
[1:16:42] Neither will he go to inspired
[1:16:44] denominations.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; He will only go for one principle
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; and that is to bring back his fallen
[1:16:52] brother.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; He's going in with one principle.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; To bring back his fallen brother.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Abraham. Amen. When he
[1:17:03] went, Amen. to save Lot. Amen. He was
[1:17:06] offered riches. Amen. But that was not
[1:17:09] what he wanted because he knew that he
[1:17:12] was getting inspiration from Elleon.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Who was able to provide everything that
[1:17:20] he needed.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; So his aim was to go and save his
[1:17:24] brother.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Now, this is from the message. What is
[1:17:31] that in thy hand?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet is doing a discernment.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says this, "But there's
[1:17:39] nothing in me that I could help
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; except God will let me know what to do."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; So if he will reveal to me why you're
[1:17:48] standing here, will you accept it then
[1:17:51] as truth?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; If it's finances
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; or whatever it is,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; you believe that God is interested in
[1:18:01] your case and he's going to hear.
[1:18:07] So the Lord is interested in every case.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So we we don't just name certain cases
[1:18:14] and said well the Lord is able to save
[1:18:16] this one but this one um is too hard
[1:18:18] this one is too sensitive so we take it
[1:18:21] away from the Lord. The the prophet said
[1:18:23] God is interested in every case
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; whether sickness whether finances
[1:18:29] whether whatever you need.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; When you go to school and and sometimes
[1:18:34] you have been taught something you don't
[1:18:36] understand. Sometimes we think that oh
[1:18:38] this is this is something that God is
[1:18:39] not interested in. No
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; everything whatever. Amen. God is
[1:18:45] interested in every case.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "May the Lord grant
[1:18:51] it is my prayer."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Every case that is brought tonight
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; to the pulpit to the altar, may the Lord
[1:19:00] grant it is my prayer.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "As you look at
[1:19:04] me," he said, "Not you know like Peter
[1:19:07] and John passed through the gate called
[1:19:08] beautiful."
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; They said look on us.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look on us. I said not look to
[1:19:17] them as him but just to give attention
[1:19:19] to what they are saying.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Catch the attraction of the spirit.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; So whatever case you have tonight, Amen.
[1:19:28] Look on us. Amen. Look at him. Amen. The
[1:19:32] pillar of fire. He's interested in every
[1:19:35] case.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[1:19:44] as you see, um, the spies going to
[1:19:46] Rahab.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; They're talking to Rahab
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; about
[1:19:52] they coming to take the land. Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Rahab has already given her testimony.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Now, that was a seed word that was
[1:20:02] given.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:20:06] a seed
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; is a word that has been planted. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; We'll get to what the prophet said about
[1:20:14] the seed. Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So, it's a word that has been planted
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; and that word when a seed is planted,
[1:20:21] there's an intention of a harvest.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; When somebody is putting a seed in the
[1:20:27] ground,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; what is his main focus or his main aim?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; His aim is to reap what he's sowing
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; is to harvest.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And in the harvest, we have a
[1:20:38] multiplication. Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; In a harvest, it's not just one seed
[1:20:43] that is coming out.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's a multiplication.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; So when God is sowing a seed, Amen. in
[1:20:49] the Lord Jesus Christ, he's looking at a
[1:20:52] multiplication.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; He's not looking at just one seed.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He's looking at a multiplication.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; So this is God revealing himself to his
[1:21:04] people.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now many times
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, this may seem strange.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Everybody be real reverent.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; If you can get the person, just what I
[1:21:16] was trying to do to the woman talking
[1:21:18] about the sermon. Amen. Was get her in
[1:21:21] the right mental attitude.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; She wouldn't have to be prayed for.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Stay in the right mental attitude. She
[1:21:32] wouldn't have to be prayed for. The
[1:21:35] right mental attitude towards any
[1:21:39] promise of God will bring it to pass.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Do you believe that?"
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The word is a seed."
[1:21:49] That's right.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That a swer sword in the ground. Right.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; When God comes to preach his word,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; when God send a spice who come with a
[1:22:01] word,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; it's a seed
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; that the swer is sowing.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "And every seed
[1:22:07] will bring forth of its kind."
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; So when the Lord is bringing the seed of
[1:22:13] healing,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; which is his word,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; he's looking at a multiplication of that
[1:22:19] word.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; If one person gets healed, It means we
[1:22:23] have so many people who are in the
[1:22:26] pipeline to get healed. When one person
[1:22:29] got saved of cancer, Amen. It means the
[1:22:32] Lord is waving before you that we have
[1:22:35] so many cases of cancer that is going to
[1:22:38] be healed.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; He's sewing that seed.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. In you for a multiplication.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Because there has to be a harvest.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the prophet said, "If you need
[1:22:53] salvation, the seed is here
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; and the seed is Christ." Amen. If you
[1:22:58] need healing, here's the seed in the
[1:23:00] word.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Put in your heart. Don't dig it up every
[1:23:07] morning to see if it sprouted.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Put it in there and leave it there.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Is God's business to bring forth the
[1:23:17] harvest? You just leave it there. order
[1:23:21] it by faith and praise every day
[1:23:25] thanking God for it. All right.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; God is saying leave it there.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Be thanking God and praising him every
[1:23:36] day.
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Let's open to Luke chapter 8 verse1 15.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Praise him every day.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Luke 8.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Verse 15.
[1:24:03] We just want to take just that um verse.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Luke 8 verse1 15
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; and you feel there let's say amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "But that on the good
[1:24:16] ground are they,"Hu,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; which in an honest and good heart,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; honest and good heart,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; having heard the word.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; They heard the word. Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; They keep it
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; just like Rahab,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; she hid the spice.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and bring forth fruit
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; with patience.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; So when you look at these people with a
[1:24:47] good heart, they are masters of time.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Because they believe in the word of God
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; whether
[1:24:58] um it lingers, it terrorists, they have
[1:25:02] patience
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; because they know it's going to happen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; So these people are masters of time.
[1:25:09] Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that is the end
[1:25:11] time bride. Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That fell on good soil. Amen.
[1:25:17] Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Patience.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; With patience.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Now talking about we we are getting into
[1:25:26] um our theme for tonight. Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; This from the message redeemer
[1:25:30] redemption
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; in 55. It said notice now we are going
[1:25:34] to Ruth. Amen. Notice Ruth was willing
[1:25:38] to forsake her idols,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; forsake her past life,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; forsake her people,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; forsake everything,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and return with Naomi.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Just like where
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; she didn't care what was going to happen
[1:25:54] in Jericho.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; She's moving with her own family.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I said no matter what the circumstances
[1:26:01] was, she was willing to go on.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way every man that
[1:26:06] comes to Christ must first be willing
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; regardless.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, I never like to
[1:26:14] tell the people, oh, you are going to
[1:26:16] prosper.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And be a rich man now
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; and God's going to bless you
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; and you ain't going to have no sickness.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So as we saw on Sunday, Amen. We are
[1:26:33] looking at greener pastures. We are
[1:26:35] looking at still waters. We are But
[1:26:37] there's also the value of the shadow of
[1:26:40] death.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; So the prophet is saying something. He
[1:26:44] said I say if you're really born again
[1:26:47] in your heart,
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I don't care how rough the road gets.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You still hold on to God's unchanging
[1:26:53] hand
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; because the focus is on Christ. Amen. If
[1:26:58] he take me to greener pastures, I say
[1:27:00] hallelujah. When he take me through the
[1:27:02] still waters, I say hallelujah. But when
[1:27:05] he take me through the valley of the
[1:27:07] shadow of death, he is my focus. Amen.
[1:27:10] So I praise him anyhow. Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter what that lays
[1:27:16] before me,
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; if Jesus goes with me,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I will go."
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Long as he goes, that's all that's
[1:27:26] necessary.
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:30] As long as he's with me in the valley,
[1:27:33] in the still waters, in green pastures.
[1:27:36] Amen. That's all what is necessary.
[1:27:39] Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "And she returned and oh the
[1:27:44] picture now, Ruth, the gentile church
[1:27:47] just coming in and Naomi, the Jewish
[1:27:49] church coming back." And notice when
[1:27:52] they turned and went got back to the
[1:27:54] homeland, they came in just in barley
[1:27:57] season.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; anyone knows what barley season was?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; It was Pentecost.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; The first fruits.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; So, you remember
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; that when Rahab was talking to the
[1:28:14] spies,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; she asked for a token.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Now the token represents
[1:28:23] she already having what she wanted.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The token is there as as as a placement
[1:28:31] or to represent her inheritance.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; So they had to give her a token to show
[1:28:37] that whatever she is asking she already
[1:28:40] has it.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So we have the first fruit of the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost. Bible said that is our talking.
[1:28:47] Amen. until the day of our redemption.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as we have the first
[1:28:55] fruits. Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; How the gentile church was brought in
[1:28:58] under the wings of almighty God at
[1:29:00] Pentecost, the gentile church, the
[1:29:02] bride, and when she returned, it was
[1:29:04] barley season.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; So in the same message, uh paragraph 44
[1:29:11] say, "And now they had a king's manuh
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; there by the name of Boaz."
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And he was a rich man.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; So remember the prophet said, "I'm not
[1:29:22] going to preach to you about God is
[1:29:24] going to give you riches, God is going
[1:29:26] to give you this, God is going to give
[1:29:27] you that, God's going to give you that."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; But here,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; we know Boaz was a rich man.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And Naomi sent Ruth out into the fields
[1:29:40] to clean in Boaz's field,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; which was the custom in that day and
[1:29:44] still today. right in that same field
[1:29:48] made gleam behind the reapers. Amen. So
[1:29:50] what was she gleaning for? She was
[1:29:52] gleaning for food. And that's what the
[1:29:54] gentile church did. Coming behind the
[1:29:57] Orthodox church, picking up all they
[1:29:59] had, which was the Old Testament.
[1:30:02] Gleaning what God give to the prophets.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; The gentile church, the young church,
[1:30:07] the holy spirit church of the firstborn.
[1:30:10] Gleaning.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Now let's go on this uh with this. And
[1:30:14] when Boas came out to see her, to see
[1:30:17] how everything was going on, a righteous
[1:30:20] man, a type of Christ.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Now remember, Boaz was a rich man.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he was a type of
[1:30:29] Christ.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Any preacher
[1:30:36] under inspiration is not going for
[1:30:38] money." Yes.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; But here
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Boas Christ is a rich man.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; So prophet Boaz was a type of Christ.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; When he come out to look upon his
[1:30:52] harvest field, he was the Lord of the
[1:30:54] harvest.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Christ is the Lord of the harvest.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And he came out to look upon the field.
[1:31:00] And notice as soon as his eyes fell upon
[1:31:04] the beautiful Ruth,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; now let's keep that in mind. Beautiful.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; It was love at the first sight.
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; So the rich man Boaz
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; is looking upon the beautiful Ruth.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Said, "Who is this young maid out here
[1:31:26] who is gleaning in my field?"
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Some of us are are scared away from
[1:31:33] saying beautiful because it makes you
[1:31:35] unholy.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Shut your mouth.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Shut your mouth.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; But beautiful is beautiful.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; My wife is the only beautiful woman to
[1:31:47] me.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; The same way as the pastor's wife is the
[1:31:52] only beautiful woman to her.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's how it is. Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] So I come to my um
[1:32:06] my team for today. Amen. My title is the
[1:32:09] Lord of the harvest.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; God's inheritance.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; You remember that the children
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; are an inheritance unto the Lord.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And Bible said he will never forsake
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; his inheritance.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are children of the most high.
[1:32:30] God will never forsake
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; his inheritance.
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read Isaiah 53.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:9
[1:32:45] to 12.
[1:32:51] Isaiah 53:9-12.
[1:32:56] Now we are talking about Boaz the rich
[1:32:58] man.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Boas types Christ.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; So let's read Isaiah 53.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Verse 9 to12.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And he made his if we are there we say
[1:33:16] amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:19] Isaiah 53:9
[1:33:21] Bible says, "And he made his grave with
[1:33:24] the wicked."
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And with the rich in his death.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Now with the ri rich
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; in his death.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Why did they bury him amongst the rich?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had done no violence,
[1:33:42] neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet
[1:33:46] it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He
[1:33:49] have put him to grief. When thou shall
[1:33:52] make his soul an offering for sin, he
[1:33:55] shall see his seed.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; He shall prolong his days, and the
[1:33:59] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:34:01] his hand.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; He shall see of the travail of his soul,
[1:34:05] and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge
[1:34:09] shall my righteous servant justify many.
[1:34:14] Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; For he shall bear their iniquities.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; So, he's justifying many.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Justifying his children. Amen. Therefore
[1:34:25] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:34:27] great. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:34:30] strong because he had poured out his
[1:34:33] soul unto death.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And he has numbered with the
[1:34:38] transgressors, and he b the sin of many
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and made intercession for the
[1:34:45] transgressors.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; So, he's already taken all these things
[1:34:49] for many.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Now, why was he doing that?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Let's read 2 Corinthians 8:9. I I mean
[1:34:57] they they can just put it up. 2
[1:34:59] Corinthians 8:9 verse 9. Amen.
[1:35:03] And I'm reading. He said, "For you know
[1:35:07] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; that though he was rich,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; yet for your sakes,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; he became poor.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That ye through his poverty might be
[1:35:21] rich."
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; So we are talking about a rich boers.
[1:35:26] That's right.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So when he came, he made himself poor
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; that you will become rich.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read this
[1:35:39] message. Amen. God has a provided way.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; From paragraph 126, it said, "And
[1:35:47] notice."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Then they had to get all of her
[1:35:51] inheritance had been taken away from
[1:35:54] her. Um the prophet is talking about
[1:35:55] Naomi. Amen. So they had to make a
[1:35:58] living. Amen. He said Ruth being a young
[1:36:02] beautiful woman.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Went out into the field of Boaz to
[1:36:08] glean.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That was what the peasants did. The
[1:36:12] poor.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; What want you to notice the type of
[1:36:17] church is Amen. It's a poor church.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Christ was made poor so
[1:36:26] we become rich.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Now we notice that the inheritance was
[1:36:30] lost. Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; But God has to do a way to bring back
[1:36:35] those riches.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; So Ruth being a type of the gentile
[1:36:41] bride. Now she went out behind the
[1:36:44] harvesters to pick up a few straws
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; that had some wheat on it.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was she was um gleaning like a
[1:36:53] peasant uh from the beginning. Amen.
[1:36:56] Shack it off like that in a in a sack
[1:36:58] for a living. Gleaning barefooted in the
[1:37:01] fields of
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Boaz.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And Boaz was the Lord of the harvest.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Representing Jesus Christ the son of
[1:37:09] God. Notice the great Lord of the
[1:37:12] harvest.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And he came out to look upon his fields.
[1:37:16] He saw the gleaners out there. He saw
[1:37:19] the reapers. And when he cast his eyes
[1:37:22] towards Ruth, he fell in love with her
[1:37:25] Christ with his church.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; So when Boas came and look at Ruth,
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; the beautiful Ruth.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Boaz fell in love with that church
[1:37:38] which was Ruth.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let's read Acts.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 7 verse 1-8. Let's see um
[1:37:51] what brother Steven has to say. Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; We're talking about God's inheritance.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Steven
[1:38:11] is is about to address something here.
[1:38:13] Amen. Uh-huh.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; So, Acts 7 verse 1 to8,
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; it said, "Then said the high priest,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; are these things so? And he said, men,
[1:38:28] brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God
[1:38:31] of glory appeared unto our father
[1:38:34] Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
[1:38:38] amen, before he dwelt in Karam." Amen.
[1:38:41] and said unto him, "Get thee out of thy
[1:38:44] country, and from thy kindred, and come
[1:38:47] into the land which I shall show thee."
[1:38:51] Amen. Then came he out of the land of
[1:38:54] the Calians. Amen. And dwelt in Karen.
[1:38:56] And from then, when his father was dead,
[1:39:00] he removed him into this land wherein ye
[1:39:04] now dwell.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; And he gave him noninheritance in it.
[1:39:11] So he asked him to go to the land.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; So brother Steven is saying that he gave
[1:39:17] him none inheritance in it. No, not so
[1:39:20] much as to set his foot on.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Now God had asked him to go to a land.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Steven here is saying that
[1:39:32] he didn't show him any inheritance or he
[1:39:35] didn't give him any inheritance. All
[1:39:37] what he had to see or all what he had
[1:39:40] was just to put his foot there.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; So from the beginning it was just
[1:39:49] putting your foot there.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; let's say I have a condition a sick a
[1:39:59] sickness condition.
[1:40:02] They call it any kind of name,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; kidney disease, cancer, brain tumor.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says I just need to have my
[1:40:12] foot there.
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; So before that condition can go away, it
[1:40:22] needs my foot.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; So when you see any condition appearing
[1:40:27] in your life, your foot is there. It
[1:40:30] means God is about to do something.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. For that thing to go away. It
[1:40:35] needs a foot
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; to claim that inheritance.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Under your feet.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; It only needs my foot to be there.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] When I get to any work place,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; when I get to any school
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and there are challenges,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; all what I need is my foot in there.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Because wherever my foot is, God has
[1:41:07] given me that land.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Verse five, I said, "And he gave him
[1:41:14] none inheritance in it." No, not so much
[1:41:17] as to set his foot on.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Yet,
[1:41:21] he promised that he would give it to him
[1:41:23] for a possession.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; He had promised
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; that he was going to give it to him as a
[1:41:29] possession.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, at the
[1:41:32] beginning, it was just his foot that was
[1:41:35] there.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; But the promise was given.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to recede after him
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; when as yet he had no child.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; God had given him that possession.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, all what he had
[1:41:53] was his foot.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He had no child.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And God spake on this wise. So brother
[1:42:01] Stephven is explaining what why God did
[1:42:04] that. Amen. That his seed should s in a
[1:42:08] strange land.
[1:42:10] and that they should bring them into
[1:42:12] bondage and then treat them evil 400
[1:42:16] years.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So already the possession was
[1:42:20] given to him.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; But then something had to happen.
[1:42:26] Certain situations had to happen because
[1:42:28] God had planned everything.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. So sometimes you are in
[1:42:32] conditions, you are in situations that
[1:42:35] look as if it's not yours,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; but the thing was already given to you
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; but things are happening around it and
[1:42:43] it look like it's not yours.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Bible says that as long as your foot
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; is in there,
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; it is your possession.
[1:42:53] As soon as my foot is in the life of my
[1:42:56] child, as soon as my foot is in the life
[1:43:00] of my mother, my father, my brethren,
[1:43:04] all of them, that possession is mine.
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; And the nation to whom they shall be in
[1:43:16] bondage will I judge,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; said God. And after that shall they come
[1:43:22] forth and serve me in this place.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Now, now looking at Israel in Babylon.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; The thing that um they in a strange
[1:43:32] land, right?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; But one thing they forgot was that they
[1:43:37] themsel was Jerusalem
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; because in order to make Jerusalem, you
[1:43:43] need a people.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; So whilst they were going in bondage,
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; they were carrying Jerusalem with them.
[1:43:50] But they didn't see that. They didn't
[1:43:52] see that.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to open their eyes
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; and say that the land that you are in,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; build houses,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; marry, have children. Amen. You can
[1:44:04] bring your inspiration in there. That is
[1:44:07] why Daniel had to be in there and
[1:44:10] praying. Amen. They didn't go after the
[1:44:12] gods of Babylon. Amen. But they had to
[1:44:15] bring their own god in there. That's
[1:44:17] right.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; So when you get into a situation, Amen.
[1:44:21] It is you, heaven, that is going in
[1:44:23] there.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; When it's a sickness, your foot is in
[1:44:27] there. That is heaven being brought into
[1:44:29] that situation.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; You only need your foot to be in there.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Because you are heaven in that
[1:44:37] situation.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; So he said, "And he gave him the
[1:44:43] covenant of circumcision."
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:44:46] So he gave him
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; so Bible says that he didn't have any
[1:44:51] possession except his foot
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and yet God had promised him
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; that possession.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; But then what did God do?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; A token
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; of circumcision.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; So all what we need is a token.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; When we are in any situation all what we
[1:45:12] need is the token of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:45:15] talking of the word, what the word has
[1:45:18] said, that is all what we need
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; to prove that we already possess the
[1:45:23] land.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we we we want to get um
[1:45:36] to the sermon. Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Just two.
[1:45:42] I mean we we we are we are going to
[1:45:44] close but let's just get to the sermon.
[1:45:46] Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:49] Now let's open to John 12:24.
[1:45:55] John 12:24.
[1:45:57] I mean there's there's no dull moment um
[1:45:59] in in the house of God. Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Bring prayer is refreshing.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Bring singing.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Bring fellowship. Bring preaching of the
[1:46:09] word. There's no dull moment. Amen.
[1:46:12] Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; John 12:4.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; John 12:4.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I know it's a familiar scripture. Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; John 12:24. It said, "Verily, verily, I
[1:46:31] say unto you,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:46:33] Except
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; a corn of wheat
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; fall into the ground and die,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; it abideth alone.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; But if it die, it bringeth forth much
[1:46:46] fruit.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; So remember, when the seed goes into the
[1:46:51] ground,
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; when the swer is sewing the seed,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; the intention is a harvest.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; And that harvest is not just bringing
[1:46:59] just one fruit.
[1:47:01] Bible says much fruit
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; much fruit.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; So when we have the seed
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; who died on the cross.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And then started the bride age
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; after the bride was taken from his side.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; He had to die.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He had to go to the soil
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; and die. The intention is a harvest.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; The intention is a harvest.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's just going to be alone.
[1:47:39] That's what the Bible is saying.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; But God's intention is to have many
[1:47:43] brethren.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; That is why he has to put him to the
[1:47:46] ground.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Now, let's read Mark 11:13.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Mark 11:13. So we keep that in mind
[1:47:59] except corn of wheat.
[1:48:04] Mark 11
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; verse 13.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; So let's remember that when Christ the
[1:48:19] seed which is the word
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; was put to the ground amen he had to die
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; to bring much fruit.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the intention of the corn.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] Now Mark 11:13
[1:48:35] says, "And seeing a fig tree," this is
[1:48:37] Jesus hungry.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; And seeing a fig tree a far off,
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; having leaves,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; He came.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; If happily,
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; now we know happily means perhaps
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; maybe
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; probability. Ah.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Now when we say probability, it means
[1:48:57] there's a chance.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Now this is the Lord Jesus Christ coming
[1:49:04] to the tree.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. With intention of a probability.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; He knew it was not time for fruit.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But he came with probability.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; So regardless of how difficult the
[1:49:20] situation is, it it's like something it
[1:49:22] it's not going to happen. It's not
[1:49:24] happened before. The doctor says this
[1:49:27] for the rest of your life, you are going
[1:49:28] to be
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; on on on on this medication. This
[1:49:33] disease is going to take you to death.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Bible says if happily
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; perhaps
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; probability when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:42] is coming,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; he's not looking at just one side of not
[1:49:46] happening
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; because there's another side of it
[1:49:49] happening.
[1:49:51] So whatever situation that comes in your
[1:49:53] life, amen, approach it like the Lord
[1:49:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Even if somebody says it's never
[1:49:59] happened, it's not going to happen
[1:50:01] before. Amen. It's not going to happen.
[1:50:03] Amen. But when it comes,
[1:50:07] probability there's that chance that it
[1:50:10] will happen. There's another side to it.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Christ didn't come at the season of
[1:50:19] fruit.
[1:50:20] He came at a season of no fruit
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; and a season where there was no
[1:50:25] expectation of fruit
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; and a season where it looks like there
[1:50:30] is no healing. It can never happen. It's
[1:50:34] never happened before. But he came
[1:50:37] perhaps the probability if happily.
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we we get ourselves in
[1:50:54] situations. Sometimes people go to
[1:50:55] school and then they are told that you
[1:50:58] know you are not smart.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; So this subject you can um you can excel
[1:51:04] through it. I mean you can't you can't
[1:51:06] do well in this subject because um you
[1:51:08] can't catch it.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Christ is saying if happily
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; if it looks like you can do it.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Remember there is the probability.
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is another side to it.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; When Christ is coming, he's the God of
[1:51:28] possibilities.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's coming to
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; to show himself.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Of a God that has nothing called
[1:51:39] impossible.
[1:51:40] in his dictionary.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; So this is a tree. Amen. That is showing
[1:51:47] leaves.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And no fruit.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; It's at a season where there's no fruit.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; But but let's look at who the Lord Jesus
[1:51:59] is.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; When he's coming, let's
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; But before we get to that, Amen.
[1:52:09] The book of Matthew 12:33 says
[1:52:13] Matthew 123 I'll just read it quickly.
[1:52:15] Amen. For the sake of time. Matthew 12
[1:52:18] 12:33
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; says
[1:52:23] either make the tree good
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; and his fruit good
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; or else make the tree corrupt
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; and his fruit corrupt
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; for the tree is known by his fruit.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes sir.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; So when he's coming to the tree,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; he's looking for fruit.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; A tree is not by his fruit. Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Let's open to the book of Esther.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Esther chapter 1 verse 12. Amen.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; So this bring my mind to Queen Vashi.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; When King Aasseros Amen. Let's read it.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Kahaseros has his banquet. He has
[1:53:22] everything going on. is has a princess
[1:53:25] and everyone around. Amen. Vashi is also
[1:53:28] about her own business. Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Her own Exactly. doing her own stuff.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; And then the king sent
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; that they should bring her in.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Now let's see verse 12.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; But the queen Vastly refused to come at
[1:53:47] the king's commandment by his
[1:53:50] chamberlings.
[1:53:52] Therefore was the king very wroth
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; and his anger burned in him. But but
[1:53:57] let's read verse 11.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; It said to bring vastly the queen before
[1:54:02] the king with a crown royal
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; to show the people and the princes
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; her beauty.
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; So the king was waiting
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; for the wife that he's married to
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; to come and show the people her beauty.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So when Christ goes to the tree,
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; he's looking for the beauty.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; This is from the message marriage and
[1:54:41] divorce.
[1:54:43] And any woman
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; that refuses a man his child
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; has no right to be a wife to him.
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hey something.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the prophet is typing
[1:54:59] something. Okay. You need to have love
[1:55:02] for your wife even if she makes a
[1:55:04] mistake. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes sir.
[1:55:08] Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; You remember in LA last time I was
[1:55:11] talking to a brother um who was who was
[1:55:14] like another brother brought a lot of
[1:55:16] quotes of the prophet about marriage and
[1:55:18] divorce. He said in adultery you have to
[1:55:20] put your wife away in in fornication you
[1:55:23] have to put put her away. And and so so
[1:55:25] I I told him that even if the woman cut
[1:55:27] her hair the prophet said that what what
[1:55:31] she's done it it's it's is liable to
[1:55:34] putting her away. Amen. So are you going
[1:55:37] to be legalistic in doing this thing?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And I said it is the love that you have
[1:55:43] toward that was what the prophet said.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; It is that love.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; So when when the man even goes out
[1:55:50] somewhere because of the love the woman
[1:55:52] has for the man. It's like even though
[1:55:54] he can go out to do anything, he's not
[1:55:56] going to do it. I believe him. I trust
[1:55:58] him. Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; So so so the man also has that same
[1:56:02] thing. It's vice versa.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the love I have for the
[1:56:06] woman. Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go out and mess up my life.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; So we don't put ourselves in those
[1:56:13] legalistic things. Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet said, "Put it away."
[1:56:17] Amen. So
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; they said, "You remember?
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Do you love her?" Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You remember in the Bible when the king
[1:56:29] married Esther?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So bringing us to Esther in Vi.
[1:56:33] Amen. Because the queen refused. That's
[1:56:36] Vashi.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; He just got him another one.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; So you're looking at Vashi, okay? Who
[1:56:45] was supposed to portray her beauty?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; She did not do it.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; She refused.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; So the king has to go for another one
[1:57:00] which is Esther. Right
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; now, we know Esther types the bride of
[1:57:04] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He just got him another one. And what
[1:57:11] happened when she refused to come out
[1:57:13] with a king and obey him?
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; The same thing it is with a woman that
[1:57:18] refuses to be wife to her husband.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Now, let's read this. And so is it when
[1:57:26] the church refuses
[1:57:28] to become pregnantated
[1:57:31] in the age that we now live in
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; to bring forth children of this age.
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; So remember it children are God's
[1:57:45] inheritance.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; So God's intention is for the age to
[1:57:50] bring forth children.
[1:57:54] So if a church is not bringing out the
[1:57:57] children of the Lord,
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; that church will be divorced.
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; You must bring forth fruit from the age.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; They said we are not Lutherans.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; We are not worthless.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this
[1:58:20] age. Amen.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; So the age has to bring forth children
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; through the pregnancy of the word of God
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; to bring forth a child of this age,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; the seed child.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So Christ going into the earth, the
[1:58:40] intention is to bring forth a seed child
[1:58:44] in every age.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; The pro I hope you understand that.
[1:58:50] Amen. For the sake of time, 259 he said
[1:58:53] he went right on revealing his word to
[1:58:56] the body
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; and vindicating him same by himself.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; His children begin to kind of look more
[1:59:04] like him
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; because it's fully maturing
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; or they become children of the word, not
[1:59:13] children of the church.
[1:59:17] children of the word.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; And the bride will be a lovely little
[1:59:22] lady of the word, unadulterated,
[1:59:26] not touched by any man's organization,
[1:59:29] any man maturely.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; She will be purely unadulterated. Amen.
[1:59:35] Bride of the word. Amen and amen.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; She'll be the pregnant daughter of God.
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Now, let's see why it is so. Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Why is Christ requiring this?
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelations 22. Sorry,
[1:59:54] brother Stephen. I had to use this
[1:59:55] scripture. Revelations 22 verse 1-5.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Revelations 22.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to5.
[2:00:17] Let's look at an example of who Christ
[2:00:20] is as a tree.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And he showed me a pure river
[2:00:29] of water of life,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; clear as crystal,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; proceeding out of the throne of God and
[2:00:37] of the lamp. And in the midst of the
[2:00:40] street of it
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; and on either side of the river
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; was there the tree of life
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; which bear 12 manner of fruits.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; And yielded her fruit every month.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Every month.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; And the leaves of the tree were for the
[2:00:56] healing of the nations.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said every month.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Now each month you come you have a
[2:01:03] different kind of fruit.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if even the month is a
[2:01:07] season in that month you come and you
[2:01:10] get a fruit
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; in January you have a fruit
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; when you come in February you have a
[2:01:15] different kind of fruit
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; in March you have a different kind of
[2:01:18] fruit
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; until December
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; the following year it starts again
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; so it is a tree that bears fruit all
[2:01:27] year round
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; so regardless of the season
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen The Lord Jesus Christ only know of
[2:01:37] fruit
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; regardless of the condition that we are
[2:01:40] in.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ only knows of
[2:01:43] fruit.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Even how difficult the situation is.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; He's only looking for the fruit of his
[2:01:51] word.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; We are we are closing. Amen.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; This is from the Sardisian church age.
[2:02:03] Now when when the Lord sold the seed,
[2:02:06] Amen. the seed had to go to the ground.
[2:02:09] Amen.
[2:02:11] Just like you have um
[2:02:14] the time of fall, Amen. where we know
[2:02:17] there's planting. Amen. And it goes to
[2:02:20] the winter. Amen. The winter everything
[2:02:23] dies. Amen. Then it comes to spring.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Things begin to budge forth. Amen.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Pointing towards the harvest. Right.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Now, let's look at the Sardisian
[2:02:36] church age.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; The seed was put to the ground.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Now, when the seed is put to the ground,
[2:02:43] it gets to a point where you begin to
[2:02:45] see it come out.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; So, we want to look at who that bride is
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; in the midst of something that looks
[2:02:57] like um just leaves.
[2:03:02] Amen sir.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Now the sadistent church age because
[2:03:05] when you look at Mark 11, Amen. Christ
[2:03:08] saw only leaves.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at another age or another
[2:03:13] scenario where there are leaves.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; And I said
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; well one time there was a man went forth
[2:03:23] you know on his own grounds there. You
[2:03:26] see, a man went forth and dis up a great
[2:03:29] big field and he took all the roots out
[2:03:32] of it
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; and everything and then he planted corn.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Each morning he went to the door and
[2:03:40] look out to see if he had any corn
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; the first thing you know. So each
[2:03:46] morning he was going to see this. Each
[2:03:48] morning he's going each morning
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; cuz he has an expectation.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Each morning he goes. That's a
[2:03:55] step of faith. Amen. He knows that he
[2:03:58] has planted corn in there.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; So one morning, two little blades
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; was sticking up.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Now when you take the blades of a corn,
[2:04:10] they are leaves.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Two blades sticking up.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Anyone ever raise corn? Where's George?
[2:04:18] Right. And them. I don't know who raises
[2:04:20] corn here. Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe brother John. Amen. I don't
[2:04:24] know, man. You know them two little
[2:04:28] blades that stick up?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Praise God for my field of
[2:04:32] corn."
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; I said, "Did he have a field of corn?"
[2:04:37] He said, "Well, in one way."
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; I said, "Potentially, yes." I said,
[2:04:42] "That was you Lutheran."
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; In the first reformation.
[2:04:48] So in the Lutheran age there were two
[2:04:51] blades
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; showing two leaves.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are comparing leaf to leaf.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; How does the bride behave in this
[2:05:01] condition?
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet points us to the
[2:05:04] Lutheran which is the Sardisian church
[2:05:06] age.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Now from this verse which shows the
[2:05:11] elect of God to be a few names. You can
[2:05:16] see clearly what we have been teaching
[2:05:18] about this age.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; It was chaotic.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; It was unfulfilled.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet is describing that age
[2:05:28] of the two blades.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; The two leaves.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; It was chaotic.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Unfulfilled.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; It was split scores of w
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; and God rebuilt it almost in its
[2:05:40] entirety. Uh-huh.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; It was weak and sickly and ready to die.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I can imagine a situation which was
[2:05:50] which is weak, sickly and ready to die.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not the glorious era that
[2:05:57] the carnalminded Protestant historians
[2:06:00] have tried to make it.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; One quick look at that tree saw it was
[2:06:05] conquered and blighted, denuded of leaf
[2:06:08] and barren of fruit. except for some
[2:06:11] deformed and wormying fruit that was
[2:06:14] fast dropping to the ground. So the
[2:06:17] prophet said, "But
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; hold a moment.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Look closer.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; There at the top
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; in the light of the sun
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; were some first fruits.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Now this is a condition of two blades
[2:06:34] which is leaf." Now in the first instant
[2:06:36] he went there was no fruit.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; But his friend trying to prove that with
[2:06:42] his bride regardless of the situation
[2:06:46] remember every month there was fruits
[2:06:49] that was being shown. There were fruits
[2:06:52] that were being manifested. So in the
[2:06:55] first age there were fruits that came
[2:06:57] up. In the second age there were fruits.
[2:07:00] They were bride in every age. Now you
[2:07:03] see in this age of the leaf, God is
[2:07:07] showing his power that regardless of the
[2:07:10] condition, Amen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; there are still fruits at the top.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; There at the top in the light of the sun
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; were some first fruit, a few names,
[2:07:24] perfect in him,
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; for they were born of him, filled with
[2:07:28] him, walking with him by his word.
[2:07:32] So the prophet said, "Thank God for
[2:07:34] those few
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; and they shall walk with me."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That is what God says he will bestow
[2:07:41] upon them for his upright walk.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; That is part of their inheritance that
[2:07:47] he has reserved for them. If they were
[2:07:50] willing to walk with him through toys
[2:07:55] and snares of life and be an honor to
[2:07:58] him, he was going to reward them.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he's not forgetful of
[2:08:05] our labor of life.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; God will always recompense us for our
[2:08:11] efforts to please him.
[2:08:13] [Applause]
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:18] So, so I just want to bring our minds to
[2:08:21] this.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; This was in Sardis.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; How much more loud this year?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; When we have the harvest,
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; what kind of fruit
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; is it showing to the devil? Amen.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Remember from the beginning he swed the
[2:08:41] seed
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; to bring much fruit
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; the time of the harvest.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; And if even in that condition
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; of service of the lutherance there were
[2:08:52] still first fruit
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; how much more the time of the harvest.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; So this is my last quote. The prophet
[2:09:03] said we are living it. the evidence.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; How do you know he lives? Well, I'm
[2:09:10] living above that.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I'm already raised up from that.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Done. Tasted of the first fruits of the
[2:09:18] resurrection.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's what I'm talking
[2:09:22] about. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:29] Amen.
[2:09:31] Amen.
[2:09:33] Amen. So just want to take this song and
[2:09:36] invite brother Stephen. Amen.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; We walk in the light.
[2:09:44] Such a beautiful
[2:09:48] light
[2:09:51] comes when
[2:09:53] the dwar drops of mercy
[2:09:58] how bright
[2:10:02] shine all
[2:10:05] around us by day. Brother Steven amen by
[2:10:10] night.
[2:10:13] Jesus
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; the light.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; One more time. We walk in the light.
[2:10:29] Such a beautyful
[2:10:33] light.
[2:10:37] Where
[2:10:38] the drops
[2:10:41] of mercy
[2:10:44] are bright.
[2:10:47] Shine all
[2:10:50] around us by day and by now. Oh, we know
[2:10:59] that Jesus
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:02] the light of
[2:11:05] the world. One more time.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; We walk in
[2:11:14] the light.
[2:11:17] Such a beauty
[2:11:20] for life.
[2:11:24] Come when
[2:11:26] the do drops of mercies
[2:11:31] are bright.
[2:11:34] Oh sh.
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:45] Oh Jesus,
[2:11:49] the light of
[2:11:52] the world.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If perhaps
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; If perhaps
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; if there is a possibility,
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; to find something.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; It was a season,
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; but that season is the season of the
[2:12:10] impossibility.
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; It was not the season of the fruit,
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; but it was a season of the
[2:12:19] impossibility.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Because that season opened the third
[2:12:24] pool.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; If Jesus would have found fruit,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; he would just take it and move on
[2:12:32] forward
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; and never activated the anointing of the
[2:12:36] third.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; But because
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no fruit. Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; He open up the power of the spoken word.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; So look at your situation.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Look at it. Amen.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Always there is a possibility.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; And if it feels like there is no
[2:12:55] possibility, then it's a signal for you
[2:12:58] to move on to a different gear.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; You speak the word of God because
[2:13:03] nothing is impossible to him that
[2:13:06] believe.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, if there is a
[2:13:08] possibility, I do it. But if there is no
[2:13:11] possibility, it doesn't mean there is a
[2:13:13] road block. It means now I need to use
[2:13:16] to a different level where I need to use
[2:13:18] a different gear and say okay now
[2:13:21] because there is no possibility we have
[2:13:23] to believe the impossible
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; because with God all things are
[2:13:28] possible. Amen. In other word there is
[2:13:30] no impossibility for you
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; in season.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; I will give you the quote. We will get
[2:13:38] to that in season and out of season.
[2:13:40] Amen. You will see what it is. Amen. We
[2:13:43] call it out of season, but it's actually
[2:13:45] is a season.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; It is a season called out of season.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a season that is called out
[2:13:55] of season. When it's out of season, then
[2:13:58] it's a season of miracle and
[2:14:00] impossibility.
[2:14:02] Amen. whenever because if not you're not
[2:14:04] going to believe the third pull
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; because the third pull will bring a
[2:14:08] squeeze a strong squeeze until you have
[2:14:11] to completely depend on God and live on
[2:14:14] the impossibility because God is
[2:14:17] squeezing every deity out of us.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, even if you were scared
[2:14:24] to speak the word now, don't worry. The
[2:14:26] pressure will bring it out. Remember his
[2:14:29] anointing come in the midst of
[2:14:31] adversity.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; So when you see adversity and enemy and
[2:14:35] everything squeezing back in then it's
[2:14:37] God who want to bring the oil that is
[2:14:39] supposed to come from the inside of the
[2:14:42] dove.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime we are best when pressure
[2:14:46] come.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When pressure come then your brain
[2:14:50] begin to work in a different rhyme that
[2:14:53] is different because you're trying to
[2:14:54] get out of a situation. Then you find
[2:14:56] out potentially about yourself that you
[2:14:59] never taught before. Amen. So God knows
[2:15:02] what he's doing. Amen. If everything is
[2:15:05] clean, easy, without any problem, you
[2:15:08] won't even learn anything. You can't
[2:15:10] even strive anything. Amen.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we were in dental school, we
[2:15:15] start pulling teeth. You want everything
[2:15:17] to go smooth. But how are you going to
[2:15:20] learn? If you pull a tooth, no problem.
[2:15:22] Because the instructor is there. if you
[2:15:24] you you are locked the instructor come
[2:15:26] and take off and everything and then
[2:15:28] they send us to clinic
[2:15:31] and I ended up where I chose I tried to
[2:15:34] pick up in Charlotte I say if I stay in
[2:15:36] Charlotte I'm going to stay close to my
[2:15:38] family so I will be there all the time
[2:15:41] when I when we begin to pick the site my
[2:15:44] computer froze
[2:15:47] so every site was picked and I was left
[2:15:49] with whatever was left so I ended up in
[2:15:52] Fagville
[2:15:53] [Laughter]
[2:15:55] And when I got there, every Wednesday
[2:15:57] you go to the prison to pull teeth. You
[2:15:59] don't do anything, just pull teeth. And
[2:16:02] that's where I begin to learn things
[2:16:04] different because you see things in a
[2:16:07] different realm and you get to difficult
[2:16:10] situation and the more difficult cases
[2:16:14] you are handling the more you are
[2:16:16] getting to a true dentist because you
[2:16:20] got to fight because we knew that after
[2:16:22] graduation your teacher ain't going to
[2:16:24] be there.
[2:16:26] When you get to your practice, there is
[2:16:27] no teacher standing there to help you
[2:16:29] with a wave a tooth. You fight that
[2:16:32] tooth and get it out yourself.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God knows how to train you
[2:16:42] because God knew one day, one day you
[2:16:45] got to face the situation. And when you
[2:16:47] face the situation, you won't have time
[2:16:49] for prayer.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; You won't even have time for fasting.
[2:16:53] You have only one shot is to react to
[2:16:56] the situation. That's when Joshua
[2:16:59] realized that there is nothing I can do.
[2:17:02] But you know what? I got to speak to
[2:17:04] that son.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't say let me ask the Lord's will
[2:17:08] if we can speak to the son. He didn't
[2:17:10] say the book of redemption is not back
[2:17:13] yet.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. Joshua didn't say
[2:17:18] we received the book of redemption. Now
[2:17:20] we can speak the word. He didn't have
[2:17:22] the book of redemption. The book of
[2:17:24] redemption was still in in heaven. He
[2:17:27] for
[2:17:29] I don't know if you understand what I'm
[2:17:30] saying. According to the way we are
[2:17:33] taught,
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; we need to receive the book of
[2:17:35] redemption back.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; When he came down in Revelation 10, Luke
[2:17:39] 17:30, Malachi 4, all of that when he
[2:17:43] comes then we feel entitled to speak the
[2:17:46] word. Joshua didn't have the seals.
[2:17:49] Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the book of redemption.
[2:17:54] He didn't care whether he came back to
[2:17:55] earth or not. He need to come out of a
[2:17:58] situation.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; And the inspiration struck him and he
[2:18:01] spoke the word
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; and that's it.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Under which blood? The blood of Jesus
[2:18:06] Christ.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not even born yet.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; What are you afraid of?
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; What else do you want?
[2:18:20] Amen.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; What vindication do you want? What
[2:18:25] sensation do you want to feel before you
[2:18:28] speak the word?
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at his situation. He
[2:18:34] matched the situation 40 wilderness
[2:18:36] hungry. This this this a scripture send
[2:18:39] him that it happened over there because
[2:18:41] he happened over there. This is the
[2:18:43] scripture I'm going to use. And God
[2:18:44] brought him angelic food. Take your
[2:18:48] situation, match it to the scripture.
[2:18:50] Take what is in the scripture and put it
[2:18:52] there and move on. Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; There is a season when it seems like
[2:18:57] there is no season. Amen.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; I know we got used to things being fine
[2:19:02] before we speak. Pray for me on Sunday
[2:19:06] and you will see what where God put you
[2:19:09] and what is hidden in what looks like a
[2:19:12] a mess. Amen. It's always an opportunity
[2:19:17] to show who you are. Amen. Let's pray.
[2:19:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:19:22] approaching you humbly tonight again.
[2:19:25] Father, thanking you for your grace, for
[2:19:27] your love and your mercy, and for
[2:19:29] speaking to us tonight, Lord. Lord Jesus
[2:19:32] Christ, we pray that you strengthen your
[2:19:34] man's servant being a musician, being a
[2:19:37] trustee under several phone call and
[2:19:40] follow up Lord Father with the
[2:19:42] construction work and still be able to
[2:19:45] study and to be able to minister to your
[2:19:47] children. Father, it takes the
[2:19:50] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit
[2:19:52] and we pray for a special grace and
[2:19:54] strength to Lord Father strengthen him
[2:19:57] and his wife Lord. Father, you spoke
[2:19:59] about children being an inheritance of
[2:20:02] the Lord. Father, probably he didn't
[2:20:05] realize it, but those scripture are not
[2:20:08] just scripture. They are seed and they
[2:20:10] are word and those word contain life.
[2:20:14] Father, I pray Lord, Father, that those
[2:20:16] inheritance be brought to him, Lord, and
[2:20:19] to everyone that is under the voice
[2:20:21] tonight, Lord, that needed an
[2:20:23] inheritance of a child from thee, Lord,
[2:20:26] because nothing is impossible, Lord.
[2:20:29] Father, just like a tree which every
[2:20:31] month, Lord, Father, bring a fruit,
[2:20:34] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you put a
[2:20:36] woman as a tree where every month there
[2:20:38] is a possibility for a fruit, Lord.
[2:20:41] Father, I pray Lord, may the season be
[2:20:44] seized, Lord. And may Lord, Father, you
[2:20:46] bring forth fruit of the womb, which is
[2:20:49] a blessing that is coming from thee,
[2:20:51] Lord. And may you bless those that need
[2:20:53] it in the name of Jesus Christ. Father,
[2:20:56] give us a mercy tonight, Lord, as we go
[2:20:59] into our respective place. May you
[2:21:01] remove any hindrance, any attack from
[2:21:03] the world of darkness. And Father, I
[2:21:05] know the devil has been going left and
[2:21:07] right since we started this prayer. And
[2:21:09] even before the prayer meeting, Lord,
[2:21:12] the whole day was hectic left and right.
[2:21:15] And I knew what he was Lord, father,
[2:21:17] afraid of. But now that you have given
[2:21:19] us the victory, Lord, we pray, Lord, and
[2:21:22] cover and claim the blood upon each one
[2:21:24] of us. May you protect us. And if you
[2:21:26] tar to come, may we meet again, Lord,
[2:21:29] Father, to fellowship around the things
[2:21:31] of the kingdom. We thank you and bless
[2:21:33] your word, Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:21:36] Christ. Amen. Come on, White John.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's pray for our sister
[2:21:52] Lily. She burned her hand. She had some
[2:21:55] blistering on her hand. So, let's just
[2:21:57] pray so that God can do the miraculous
[2:22:00] again. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:22:03] approaching you again, Lord. Father
[2:22:05] humbly tonight on behalf of our sister.
[2:22:08] Lord, just like I said Lord since Monday
[2:22:12] a hectic day Tuesday because of the
[2:22:14] prayer oncoming Lord Father things
[2:22:17] breaking down left and right Lord but
[2:22:19] Lord we know through it all there is a
[2:22:22] season Lord and Father Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22:24] one was been affected and attacked by
[2:22:27] the devil. We all as a body suffer
[2:22:30] together Lord. But Lord Father, we're
[2:22:32] not going to sit down to cry and just
[2:22:35] Lord Father mourn or Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22:37] complain about it. But as a body, you
[2:22:40] have given us the power to unite
[2:22:42] together and to ask Lord Father and you
[2:22:45] will grant it unto us. Lord, we pray in
[2:22:47] the name of Jesus Christ that you touch
[2:22:50] our sister hand and may you heal her
[2:22:52] completely by the power of the Holy
[2:22:55] Spirit. Father, we saw you healing
[2:22:58] people that got burned, Lord. Father,
[2:23:00] until Lord Jesus Christ, there was not
[2:23:02] even a pen, Lord. Father, we pray in the
[2:23:05] name of Jesus Christ that you touch our
[2:23:07] sister where she is, Lord. May the power
[2:23:10] of the Holy Spirit overshadow her. May
[2:23:12] you touch and bring complete healing and
[2:23:15] a complete victory and also a testimony
[2:23:18] for the glory of your name, Lord.
[2:23:20] Father, you heal her for many things,
[2:23:22] Lord. Father before Lord, but I pray
[2:23:25] Lord tonight be another special grace
[2:23:27] Lord that you will show your presence
[2:23:29] and extend your love to your daughter
[2:23:31] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[2:23:34] claim the blood upon this church.
[2:23:36] Protect us and lift up a standard
[2:23:39] against the enemy in Jesus precious
[2:23:41] name. Amen.
