[29:16] then i want to i want to make an appeal
[29:18] this morning i had
[29:19] i spoke to brother i'm stephen about it
[29:21] you know
[29:22] we've had fellowship in in someone's
[29:25] home
[29:25] we had a bible study once at my house
[29:27] and we had a fellowship
[29:29] you know with a few people at brother
[29:30] steven's house and we had
[29:32] a big one at brother um at brother
[29:35] daley's home
[29:36] [Music]
[29:38] and i just it was enjoyed so much
[29:41] we enjoyed it so much as as even adults
[29:44] it's geared for the youth we want to
[29:46] remove the stigma
[29:48] with the youth that if they have
[29:50] questions they're going to be
[29:52] judged by the question that they asked
[29:54] we're not we don't want to give the
[29:56] impression
[29:56] that anybody you know if you have a
[29:58] question you're not going to be
[30:00] judged we're not going to judge young
[30:02] people we just want to help you
[30:03] understand
[30:04] and have the revelation of the word of
[30:06] the hour
[30:08] and we encourage attendance to the
[30:10] fellowships
[30:11] now you know the food is very good as
[30:14] well
[30:16] okay so
[30:19] and brother stephen assured me that you
[30:20] know the church helps with that there's
[30:22] already been
[30:23] um you know it's set aside for for
[30:26] things like this
[30:28] my my appeal is that
[30:31] if it's possible for somebody to open
[30:33] their home up
[30:35] you know my home is tore apart right now
[30:39] because we're building bathrooms and
[30:41] rebuilding bathrooms and all of my
[30:42] living room furniture is under covers
[30:44] and we're fixing to have to move into
[30:47] our spare bedroom and
[30:48] [Music]
[30:49] or i'd have everybody over at my house
[30:52] it's coming we will soon as we get
[30:54] everything back back to normal
[30:57] um but if somebody has it on their heart
[31:00] to open up their home for this type of
[31:03] fellowship
[31:05] we want to ask for it we want to say
[31:07] follow the leading of god
[31:09] open your door your house won't get
[31:11] destroyed we won't leave you cleaning up
[31:13] all the you know afterwards and
[31:15] everything
[31:16] or cooking all the food
[31:19] if i'm there i'm gonna eat my portion
[31:21] maybe a little more
[31:23] but just consider pray about it and
[31:26] consider because
[31:27] the fellowship you know we're in a
[31:29] unique situation here by not having a
[31:31] building a church
[31:32] building so we have to we have to rely
[31:34] on homes
[31:35] in the hearts of the people so just you
[31:37] know everyone consider it
[31:40] oh wow sister devine your
[31:44] your mother's here this morning amen
[31:48] praise the lord glory to god
[31:53] hallelujah
[31:57] that is wonderful that is wonderful
[32:00] what time is it okay
[32:05] i'm going to sing the only special we're
[32:07] going to have today
[32:09] if you have a song on your heart hold on
[32:10] to it till next week
[32:12] this is going to be kind of a a special
[32:15] song we are going to put it up on the
[32:17] over here because i'm not going to i'm a

[32:31] and i also
[32:32] only gave the musicians um was it this
[32:36] morning

[32:42] singing and playing
[32:44] but y'all sing yes it is
[32:48] so when we sing it just enjoy it and
[32:50] it's going to be

[37:15] you're not supposed to cry
[37:21] but i'm almost sure
[37:24] there were tears in your eyes
[37:30] as jesus took your hand
[37:34] and you stood before the lord

[55:36] it
[55:40] you want to see that in the court it
[55:42] happened to brother branham
[55:45] i am not the replacement of brad branham
[55:47] there is nobody that's going to replace
[55:49] brother branham
[55:50] but the god of brother branham is also
[55:52] my god
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:55] i'm not going to expect less than what
[55:58] he did
[55:58] with the messenger because brother
[56:01] branham told us whatever he does to the
[56:03] messenger
[56:04] is an example to what he's going to do
[56:06] to you
[56:08] genesis chapter 4 verse
[56:11] 3. let's start even from verse
[56:15] one just to get a lot of background
[56:17] thank you brother david
[56:20] and adam knew his wife knew eve his wife
[56:24] if he's a church a woman and she
[56:28] conceived
[56:29] and war came and said i have gathered a
[56:32] man
[56:33] from the lord a cover-up just to explain
[56:36] that oh
[56:37] every life comes from god cover up you
[56:39] need the prophet
[56:40] to go under that blanket and to pull
[56:44] to you that that's a serpent seed amen
[56:48] verse two and she again bore his brother
[56:51] abel you might be seated
[56:54] so we find here that within this church
[56:59] call eve because a woman in the bible
[57:03] is a church there are two seeds
[57:07] we have the seed of the devil if you
[57:10] still have a problem with serpent seed
[57:12] you see me
[57:12] we're going to spend time together the
[57:15] seed of the devil
[57:17] satan and we have the seed of god
[57:22] amen now when those
[57:26] two seeds two vine
[57:29] in the church came out
[57:32] the bible says that in verse two and
[57:34] evil
[57:35] was a keeper of the sheep we have
[57:40] able brother ebo
[57:47] a keeper of the ship and we have
[57:52] kane who was a
[57:55] tiller off the ground
[57:58] everybody clear one
[58:01] attended to the ship another one
[58:05] attended to the ground but we know
[58:09] that before those two children were born
[58:14] men disobey god anybody clear
[58:17] when men disobey god
[58:21] man took the fruit of the ground
[58:25] which produced the fig and took thick
[58:28] leaves
[58:29] and covered himself up amen
[58:32] but when god came down
[58:36] adam in the presence of god still taught
[58:39] god that he was naked
[58:42] he was covered but that covering
[58:46] was not enough to protect him in the
[58:48] eyes of god
[58:50] in the eyes of god adam was still naked
[58:54] even though he was covered by fig leaves
[58:57] amen then the lord instead of cursing
[59:01] adam
[59:02] god cursed the ground
[59:05] are you there and when a cane
[59:08] comes out his life is always
[59:12] around that which was cursed
[59:18] amen correct
[59:22] but before they leave the garden of eden
[59:25] god himself took a lamb
[59:28] and killed the lamb and took the
[59:31] covering of the lamb and clothed them
[59:35] with a bleeding covering lamb
[59:39] are you there and when the elbow comes
[59:41] out
[59:42] evo is taking care
[59:46] of his entire life is around
[59:49] what god used to protect man
[59:55] are you there one is more spiritual
[59:59] one is always about the cursed stuff
[1:00:03] everybody clear amen
[1:00:07] verse three and in the process of time
[1:00:10] it comes to pass that cain brought
[1:00:14] of the fruit of the ground which
[1:00:17] didn't work with adam and offering those
[1:00:21] fig leaves
[1:00:22] all those fruits an offering to the lord
[1:00:25] and evil he also brought out the first
[1:00:28] ring
[1:00:29] of his flock and of the fat thereof
[1:00:32] and the lord had respect to abel and to
[1:00:35] his
[1:00:36] offering so both of these boys
[1:00:39] are worshipping amen
[1:00:43] they are worshippers both of them
[1:00:47] none of them is a hidden amen
[1:00:50] both of them offered to god but god
[1:00:53] had a respect to one who had the
[1:00:56] revelation of the sheep
[1:00:58] versus the other one amen
[1:01:03] verse five but ken
[1:01:06] but to ken and to his offering he had no
[1:01:09] respect
[1:01:10] and ken was very angry and his
[1:01:12] countenance fell
[1:01:14] and the lord said to ken why are you
[1:01:16] angry
[1:01:17] and why are your countenance fallen
[1:01:21] if you do well now something happened
[1:01:24] james he arrows
[1:01:25] and because of jealousy cain was upset
[1:01:29] against his brother
[1:01:30] then god open up and give a command
[1:01:34] god give his word to ken
[1:01:37] amen and this is the word of god to cain
[1:01:41] he said if you do well in other words if
[1:01:44] you do like your brother
[1:01:46] shall you not be accepted in other words
[1:01:49] just follow what your brother did
[1:01:52] and i'm gonna accept your offering amen
[1:01:55] and if you do not well sin
[1:01:58] lies at the door so he give him his word
[1:02:02] like if you want me to accept you this
[1:02:05] is the way
[1:02:07] but be careful unbelief sin
[1:02:10] is at the door amen
[1:02:14] and to you shall be
[1:02:17] his desire and you shall rule over him
[1:02:21] in other words i am giving you my word
[1:02:24] i am showing you that you a man and a
[1:02:27] free moral agency
[1:02:29] you have a right to take my word
[1:02:33] and to be accepted into my presence
[1:02:36] or you can reject my word by sin
[1:02:40] are you there but i'm telling you you
[1:02:43] have power
[1:02:44] to rule over sin you have the right to
[1:02:47] say no
[1:02:49] even though sin is presented to you you
[1:02:51] still have the right to say no
[1:02:54] you have the power but can
[1:02:57] willing fully
[1:03:00] that's the problem verse 8
[1:03:03] and ken talked with fable his brother
[1:03:06] and he came to pass
[1:03:07] when they were in the field that can
[1:03:10] rolls up against about his brother and
[1:03:12] do what
[1:03:14] in other words can rejected the word of
[1:03:16] god
[1:03:18] amen if ken would have kept the word of
[1:03:21] god
[1:03:21] he would have done whatever have done
[1:03:24] and then be accepted
[1:03:25] by god but because god sent his word
[1:03:30] god sent his command and cairne took the
[1:03:33] command of god and rejected it
[1:03:37] what happened to cain verse 15
[1:03:41] and the lord said to him therefore
[1:03:44] whosoever slay cain vengeance shall be
[1:03:48] taken on him sevenfold
[1:03:50] and the lord said what cain was marked
[1:03:57] the first mark of the beast
[1:04:00] are you there and he set the mark upon
[1:04:03] cain
[1:04:04] lest any funding him should kill him
[1:04:07] watch verse
[1:04:08] 15. and cain went out
[1:04:12] from what in other words
[1:04:15] cain departed from the presence of god
[1:04:19] the presence of god that he had access
[1:04:22] to it
[1:04:23] he was forever forbidden from that
[1:04:26] presence
[1:04:26] can no longer could come back again
[1:04:30] in the presence of god he was marked
[1:04:32] separated from god
[1:04:34] and went outside of the presence of god
[1:04:37] because
[1:04:37] he rejected the command or the word of
[1:04:41] the lord
[1:04:42] everybody clear a cain went out from the
[1:04:46] presence of the lord
[1:04:48] and dwell in the land of node on the
[1:04:50] east of
[1:04:51] eden what i'm trying to you to show you
[1:04:55] here
[1:04:55] there is a woman a church within that
[1:04:59] church we have two vine
[1:05:01] we have two seeds we have the line of
[1:05:04] the devil
[1:05:05] and the lion of god the line of god will
[1:05:09] always line up with the first scripture
[1:05:12] god uses scripture by killing the lamb
[1:05:15] and evil line up with the word
[1:05:18] automatically
[1:05:19] wakan was mastering on the face of the
[1:05:23] world
[1:05:24] that was already cursed by god are you
[1:05:26] there
[1:05:27] both of them were worshipers but
[1:05:30] one rejected the command of god
[1:05:34] and because of rejecting the command of
[1:05:36] god a
[1:05:37] mark was put upon him and he no longer
[1:05:41] seen the presence of god everybody clear
[1:05:45] let's go to matthew 22.
[1:05:53] and then we're going to lend to our
[1:05:55] esther
[1:05:58] matthew 22 verse 1 and jesus answered
[1:06:01] and spoke
[1:06:02] to them again and by parable and say
[1:06:06] the kingdom of god of heaven is like a
[1:06:08] certain king
[1:06:09] which way made a marriage to his son and
[1:06:12] sent forth his servant to call them
[1:06:15] that were beaten to the wedding and they
[1:06:17] would not come so
[1:06:19] there was a wedding set up here
[1:06:22] this king have already chairs just like
[1:06:24] you found chairs in a hotel
[1:06:27] those chairs belong first
[1:06:30] to those that were invited are you there
[1:06:34] it was their position are you there
[1:06:37] but they rejected their position
[1:06:41] everybody clear and refused to obey
[1:06:45] the word of the king or the command
[1:06:49] of the king if you study your esther
[1:06:52] it should be dropping now are you there
[1:06:57] again he sent forefather servant verse 4
[1:07:00] saying
[1:07:00] tell them which are beaten behold i have
[1:07:03] prepared my dinner
[1:07:04] my oxen and my fatling are killed and
[1:07:07] all things are ready
[1:07:08] come to the marriage a call into the
[1:07:11] marriage
[1:07:12] an invitation into the marriage
[1:07:15] but they made light of it and went their
[1:07:18] ways
[1:07:19] one to his farm another to his
[1:07:21] merchandise
[1:07:23] and the remnant took his servant and
[1:07:25] entreated them spitefully and slew them
[1:07:27] in other words
[1:07:28] they rejected the call they rejected the
[1:07:32] invitation
[1:07:33] they rejected the command of god
[1:07:36] are you there but when the king heard
[1:07:39] thereof that the command was rejected
[1:07:42] the car was rejected
[1:07:44] the invitation was rejected
[1:07:47] he was angry we already gave you your
[1:07:51] reading
[1:07:52] and he sent off his army and destroy
[1:07:55] those murderers
[1:07:56] and burn up their cities then say he to
[1:07:59] his servant
[1:08:01] he sent his servant amen
[1:08:04] the king did not go the king sent his
[1:08:08] servant the servant came with a message
[1:08:12] and delivered the message and the
[1:08:15] message was rejected
[1:08:17] and when the message was rejected the
[1:08:20] king was
[1:08:21] upset we okay now
[1:08:24] and then say he to his servant the
[1:08:26] wedding
[1:08:27] is ready there is a position here a call
[1:08:30] for
[1:08:30] a feeling on the position but there
[1:08:33] which
[1:08:34] were beaten that which were called first
[1:08:38] amen were not what
[1:08:41] they had their opposition they were
[1:08:46] invited they have a certain relationship
[1:08:49] between them
[1:08:50] and that king that's the reason why the
[1:08:53] king
[1:08:53] invited them when you're inviting
[1:08:56] somebody to their
[1:08:57] friend their family their co-worker
[1:09:00] somebody that you know but because they
[1:09:02] rejected
[1:09:04] that invitation their position
[1:09:07] in the life of the king is lost
[1:09:12] esther chapter one you okay
[1:09:15] and then that position must be taken
[1:09:19] and given to somebody else
[1:09:23] you okay now i hope you read your bible
[1:09:26] okay and then so the servant went out
[1:09:30] into the highways
[1:09:33] and gather together all as many as the
[1:09:36] fan
[1:09:37] both bad and good because they're gonna
[1:09:39] go through
[1:09:40] purification and the wedding was what
[1:09:43] furnished with guests so the position
[1:09:46] was lost
[1:09:47] but somebody else must come and fill in
[1:09:49] that position
[1:09:50] everybody clear last scripture second
[1:09:53] thessalonians chapter two
[1:09:55] then we're gonna pray and before you
[1:09:57] pray
[1:09:58] you go back to the book of esther
[1:10:00] chapter one
[1:10:02] amen second thessalonian
[1:10:06] chapter two if you dare you can say amen
[1:10:14] is michael daley somewhere okay he's
[1:10:17] there oh praise the name
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:22] verse 10 and we found receivableness
[1:10:25] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:10:28] because they receive not the what
[1:10:32] the love of the truth so when you see
[1:10:36] some people rejecting the word
[1:10:38] there is a mystery to that amen
[1:10:42] they are rejecting the world because in
[1:10:44] them
[1:10:45] they never receive the love of the truth
[1:10:50] and the truth we know is the word of god
[1:10:54] i am the welder truth the truth is
[1:10:57] christ
[1:10:58] for you to receive christ in you
[1:11:02] you must have the love of the truth
[1:11:07] predestination all over
[1:11:11] amen because they receive not the love
[1:11:14] of the truth
[1:11:15] that they might be what so to be saved
[1:11:18] you must receive the love of the truth
[1:11:21] if not you're not going to be saved
[1:11:26] that's why if you are saved thank god
[1:11:30] amen verse 11 and for this cause
[1:11:34] because they never receive it god
[1:11:37] shall send them a strong delusion
[1:11:41] that they should believe er that's why
[1:11:44] you stop you say
[1:11:45] how can somebody not see what i'm saying
[1:11:49] after all of this it's clear that this
[1:11:53] man is lying
[1:11:54] and still the people believe that the
[1:11:57] problem is they never receive the love
[1:12:00] of the truth
[1:12:03] and god sent them a spirit that helped
[1:12:06] them believe a lie
[1:12:12] neutral
[1:12:16] amen i'm reading the bible
[1:12:20] that they all might be working so after
[1:12:24] you believe
[1:12:24] god come and whoop you
[1:12:28] to be them who believe not though
[1:12:32] but had pleasure in what they even have
[1:12:35] pleasure
[1:12:36] that spirit make them enjoy it
[1:12:39] get on facebook and brag about it
[1:12:45] brag about a lie
[1:12:48] on the internet
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:52] but we are what
[1:12:55] do you know what that ban means we are
[1:12:57] obliged we are under
[1:12:59] obligation we are born
[1:13:03] to give what do you remember i just told
[1:13:06] you
[1:13:07] always to god why
[1:13:10] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[1:13:14] has what
[1:13:16] you see your predestination
[1:13:21] did you see it from the beginning that's
[1:13:24] why when you wake up in the morning you
[1:13:26] say thank you jesus
[1:13:28] are you there because before the
[1:13:30] foundation of the world
[1:13:32] god already put a system under you
[1:13:36] are you there when the word of god comes
[1:13:39] whether you like it or not something in
[1:13:41] you pull it
[1:13:45] amen that's why brother branham said you
[1:13:48] have nothing to do to be safe
[1:13:51] nothing put your car in your chair
[1:13:57] amen because god has from the beginning
[1:14:01] chosen you to what if god have chosen
[1:14:05] you to salvation
[1:14:07] god must give you the love of the
[1:14:10] for you to be what saved
[1:14:15] so when you coming into the world he
[1:14:17] said this one you're gonna be saved
[1:14:20] where is the ship loaded go
[1:14:25] you in the night club you are dancing in
[1:14:28] the nightclub
[1:14:29] god is relaxing when the time of god
[1:14:32] comes
[1:14:33] your friend will say what happened to
[1:14:35] you no the system is activated
[1:14:39] it is your time to report to go back to
[1:14:41] your father
[1:14:42] because you are predestinated you are
[1:14:45] programmed
[1:14:46] to be saved you are
[1:14:50] programmed for the message of yahweh
[1:14:54] you don't have to force it you are not
[1:14:57] here because your brother stephen
[1:14:59] you hear because of a program god put in
[1:15:02] your life
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:09] if you are not on the program you're
[1:15:12] going to hang on for a little while
[1:15:13] and you're going to get tired and you're
[1:15:15] going to leave because
[1:15:16] under god you were not under that
[1:15:18] program
[1:15:20] are you there praise the name of the
[1:15:23] lord
[1:15:24] because god has from the beginning
[1:15:27] chosen you to what
[1:15:29] through what it is already prepared for
[1:15:33] you
[1:15:34] that's six months of marriage are you
[1:15:36] there
[1:15:37] sanctification of what of the spirit and
[1:15:41] belief of what
[1:15:42] you just can't help it you have to
[1:15:46] believe
[1:15:47] the truth whether you like it or not
[1:15:50] you're gonna believe it you're gonna be
[1:15:54] obliged you're gonna be bound you're
[1:15:56] gonna be
[1:15:57] forced some people god
[1:16:00] don't care about them if you sin they
[1:16:02] lock you
[1:16:04] you don't ask forgiveness they lock you
[1:16:05] again it seems like
[1:16:07] everything you do god is kind of
[1:16:09] watching you like
[1:16:10] i'm not supposed to be doing this
[1:16:12] everybody is doing that
[1:16:13] when i do it and get in trouble yes
[1:16:16] because you a program
[1:16:20] put your car in neutral and let the
[1:16:22] creator and the master
[1:16:24] take over your life and do with your
[1:16:26] life what he predestinated you to be
[1:16:29] but the plan of him our plan of good
[1:16:33] not of evil let's pray heavenly father

[1:16:40] your love

[1:17:10] father change the life of your children
[1:17:13] in the name of jesus christ
[1:17:15] amen god richly bless you as you are
[1:17:18] said i thought this sermon will be one
[1:17:23] but it turned out to be that the book of
[1:17:26] esther is
[1:17:27] a very peculiar book let's go to esther
[1:17:31] chapter one the king a hazaris thrift
[1:17:36] and esther's two banquets
[1:17:39] last week last sunday we already dealt
[1:17:42] with the first feast how many remember
[1:17:46] what the first 50s
[1:17:49] how many people are on board
[1:17:54] if you are not on board it's not my
[1:17:56] fault
[1:17:57] it's on youtube all you need is your
[1:18:00] phone
[1:18:02] amen we talk about the first feast
[1:18:06] and the second fist and we stop in the
[1:18:09] middle of the feast
[1:18:11] of the sacrifice but i want to remind
[1:18:13] you this
[1:18:14] that the bible is written in mysteries
[1:18:18] in symbols jesus thanked the father for
[1:18:21] it
[1:18:23] that he was wrought in mysteries the
[1:18:26] whole world
[1:18:27] is wrote in mysteries and only the
[1:18:30] knowledge of god
[1:18:31] can reveal it not the wrong knowledge of
[1:18:34] a man
[1:18:35] not the knowledge of brother stephen but
[1:18:38] a mystery
[1:18:39] require the teaching of the spirit
[1:18:42] or it never becomes clear how we need to
[1:18:45] hear from god
[1:18:47] and lay ourselves open and become
[1:18:49] yielded to the spirit
[1:18:51] to hear and to know now we spoke
[1:18:55] and explained to you this that god can't
[1:18:58] give a first revelation than a second
[1:19:01] revelation
[1:19:02] if he did he will be changing his mind
[1:19:05] god can give a revelation
[1:19:07] and then add to it and the reason why
[1:19:11] he's adding he's giving more scripture
[1:19:14] more detail more explanation
[1:19:17] is is for you to give the people
[1:19:20] more information to help them receive
[1:19:23] and
[1:19:24] understand that's why if you go to the
[1:19:27] book of revelation
[1:19:29] you'll find that revelation 1 1 is
[1:19:31] speaking about
[1:19:32] the significant angel that angel is brad
[1:19:35] branham
[1:19:37] we already preached about it if you go
[1:19:39] to revelation 3 it spoke about
[1:19:41] the seventh angel to the seven church
[1:19:44] ages
[1:19:44] that is brother branham if you go to
[1:19:47] revelation 10
[1:19:48] 7 that is brother branham if you go to
[1:19:51] revelation 18
[1:19:53] 1 the angel that come down and his light
[1:19:56] is lighting the entire world
[1:19:58] that angel is also brother branham if
[1:20:00] you go
[1:20:01] you will see a ninja standing on the sun
[1:20:03] that angel is still brother branham
[1:20:05] and you will see one of the seven engine
[1:20:08] with the seven vowel
[1:20:09] that engine also is what a branham it is
[1:20:12] one book
[1:20:13] but it gave you more detail about the
[1:20:16] ministry of guatemala
[1:20:18] so when that ministry come it's going to
[1:20:21] be easy for you to receive it
[1:20:23] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:20:26] lord
[1:20:27] brother branham said the church has got
[1:20:29] to lift itself
[1:20:31] in the power of god how are you going to
[1:20:33] get lift yourself to the power of god
[1:20:36] how we are too close to the end now
[1:20:39] and i believe the church is in a
[1:20:42] condition
[1:20:43] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:20:46] things
[1:20:49] to get to the power of god you need a
[1:20:52] lot of
[1:20:53] deeper things are you there and
[1:20:56] rob some of this make believer out
[1:21:00] and get into something real
[1:21:03] so to get back to the power of god we
[1:21:06] gotta get a little bit deeper
[1:21:08] in our teaching are you there now when
[1:21:12] we spoke
[1:21:12] on the second feast we found out that
[1:21:16] their feast came after the expiration
[1:21:19] of the first feast which was showing
[1:21:22] that the dispensation of god
[1:21:24] to the jewish people was expired god
[1:21:27] will never
[1:21:28] use that again because grace already
[1:21:31] took over
[1:21:32] and we found that it was a feast where
[1:21:34] all the people were invited
[1:21:36] not just the jews but he was both the
[1:21:38] jews
[1:21:39] and the gentiles and that fish took day
[1:21:42] off
[1:21:42] seven days which were typifying the
[1:21:45] gentile dispensation of
[1:21:47] seven church ages then that feast
[1:21:50] took place on the court of the garden
[1:21:54] of the palace but when we look at the
[1:21:57] decoration of the court
[1:22:00] we found out that the coat was decorated
[1:22:03] in white
[1:22:04] you remember that in green in purple
[1:22:08] in blue and all those colors were
[1:22:11] gathered together by fine lemon which
[1:22:14] was the righteousness of the sand
[1:22:16] which was speaking about the gospel but
[1:22:19] if you
[1:22:19] check on esther chapter one you'll find
[1:22:22] out that
[1:22:22] that fine landing which gathered all
[1:22:25] those color
[1:22:26] was attached to the pillar you want to
[1:22:29] see it
[1:22:30] let's read down essence chapter one
[1:22:33] verse
[1:22:34] six then i'm gonna continue where we
[1:22:37] stop
[1:22:38] if you dare you can say amen
[1:22:41] where where white is there
[1:22:45] green it's there and blue
[1:22:48] hangings are those three fastened with
[1:22:52] coats
[1:22:53] they were hooked together we've called
[1:22:56] of what
[1:22:57] fine linen which is the gospel are you
[1:23:00] there
[1:23:01] find lemon and purple for your adoption
[1:23:04] are you there to silvering and to what
[1:23:10] so all of this gospel i want you to
[1:23:12] remember that
[1:23:13] as we're moving down the world all the
[1:23:16] gospel
[1:23:17] contain three colors four
[1:23:20] actually with the purple but all those
[1:23:23] four colors
[1:23:24] were hooked to the gospel and they took
[1:23:28] those color
[1:23:29] and hooked them to the pillar so the
[1:23:32] pillars
[1:23:33] of that place were the ones that were
[1:23:36] holding the gospel
[1:23:39] i'm going to repeat it again the pillar
[1:23:42] of the court of the king
[1:23:44] where the feast of the gentiles were
[1:23:48] taking places there were some pillars
[1:23:51] and those pillars hold the gospel
[1:23:55] and in the gospel of those pillars
[1:23:58] because the pillar are part of the
[1:24:00] foundation we saw it last week
[1:24:03] those pillars that held the gospel
[1:24:06] within the gospel
[1:24:07] you got a green color a white color
[1:24:10] a blue color and a purple color which
[1:24:14] becomes
[1:24:14] adoption it's a gospel that will
[1:24:17] position the believer
[1:24:19] in the edge
[1:24:22] brother stephen we spoke and we saw that
[1:24:27] those colors represented the purity of
[1:24:30] god
[1:24:32] those color represented the what
[1:24:35] demons of god and the attitude of god
[1:24:38] so the color shows the motives of god
[1:24:42] and the attitude or the intent of god
[1:24:45] toward his people if those color
[1:24:49] represented the attitude and the motives
[1:24:52] of god
[1:24:53] what do they mean you there
[1:24:56] there is only one original color and
[1:24:59] that is
[1:25:00] white how many knows that
[1:25:03] there is only one original color
[1:25:05] anything else
[1:25:06] is mixed crust
[1:25:09] is on a solid white
[1:25:13] come on an adulterated word
[1:25:16] from the beginning amen every color
[1:25:20] will be white if some chemistry had not
[1:25:23] broken into it
[1:25:25] amen glory every church will be standing
[1:25:28] under what
[1:25:29] apostolic doctrine of them
[1:25:32] so that feast of the gentile started
[1:25:36] with white color which spoke about the
[1:25:39] apostolic
[1:25:40] doctrine of the word because the church
[1:25:44] is built upon the foundation
[1:25:46] of apostle and water
[1:25:49] and prophet and jesus christ himself
[1:25:52] being the chief
[1:25:54] everybody clear revelation chapter
[1:25:57] four brother branham say so we see him
[1:26:01] in the circle of both green amber color
[1:26:04] this is greenish what else green what
[1:26:07] represent
[1:26:08] it represent what so not only are the
[1:26:12] pillars
[1:26:12] carrying a gospel that is carrying
[1:26:16] the apostolic doctrine but that gospel
[1:26:19] is intended to give you life
[1:26:23] everybody clear life green is evergreen
[1:26:26] always stays green is what life
[1:26:29] whatever blue but a stephen but a pranam
[1:26:33] the perfect spirit of love red
[1:26:36] blue the perfect spirit of what
[1:26:40] let me drop down here he said and they
[1:26:42] come all the way down
[1:26:44] from philia agape love to feel your love
[1:26:48] on down to lust undone to the lowest
[1:26:51] this is not the time to get on to this
[1:26:53] but we're going to teach you all these
[1:26:55] kind of loves
[1:26:56] and it's going to impact your wedding
[1:26:58] your marriage
[1:26:59] and also your own life amen
[1:27:03] because there are different kind of laws
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:06] the top one is agape then you have
[1:27:09] failure
[1:27:10] then you have a different kind of love
[1:27:12] especially young people amen
[1:27:14] now in the book of hebrew brother
[1:27:16] branham says here
[1:27:18] that this ray of light went off it was a
[1:27:21] ray of love
[1:27:22] that is the main one red the next color
[1:27:25] follow which is what
[1:27:27] blue the white so you see that those
[1:27:30] colors
[1:27:31] have the intent the attribute the motive
[1:27:34] of god to all his
[1:27:35] people so when god send his gospel in
[1:27:38] that gospel
[1:27:39] is going to bring you into perfect
[1:27:41] fellowship with god
[1:27:43] that gospel will bring you eternal life
[1:27:46] that gospel
[1:27:47] is based upon the doctrine of the
[1:27:49] apostle
[1:27:50] that god is based upon the truth because
[1:27:53] the word of god is
[1:27:54] true and you must have the love of the
[1:27:58] blue
[1:27:58] love of the truth for you to receive it
[1:28:02] amen and the purple which spoke about
[1:28:05] your position
[1:28:06] and we found out in that same quote
[1:28:09] that on the pavement of the court we
[1:28:12] also have four colors
[1:28:14] and of four colors we have founded the
[1:28:17] ministry of the antichrist
[1:28:19] so even though god is bringing the
[1:28:22] gospel
[1:28:22] by the pillars but still we are walking
[1:28:27] in the way way which is infested by
[1:28:29] demon
[1:28:30] but those demons do not have power over
[1:28:33] us
[1:28:34] we have power over them because
[1:28:36] according to luke chapter 10
[1:28:38] we have been given power to walk over
[1:28:41] the serpent
[1:28:42] and all the power of the enemy everybody
[1:28:45] clear
[1:28:46] then that feast also implies wine
[1:28:51] which one represented the anointing of
[1:28:54] god
[1:28:55] the oil the holy spirit but the problem
[1:28:58] was
[1:28:58] in the last day of the feast in the last
[1:29:02] church ages
[1:29:04] something happened that was in
[1:29:07] revelation
[1:29:08] uh in esther chapter 10 we found out
[1:29:11] that the king
[1:29:13] sent seven chamberlain you remember that
[1:29:17] that's where our plan landed now we got
[1:29:19] to leave the airport
[1:29:20] are you there so it was seventh
[1:29:22] chamberlain that was
[1:29:24] sent to call on the bride but let's go
[1:29:27] back
[1:29:27] to chapter nine because we skipped
[1:29:29] something
[1:29:33] everybody ready don't worry
[1:29:37] we're going to take off
[1:29:42] esther chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:29:47] everybody there also vashta the queen
[1:29:53] okay we have the first feast
[1:29:56] of king hazardous
[1:30:00] which implies the jews the second feast
[1:30:04] of king and hazaras speak of the
[1:30:07] dispensation
[1:30:08] of the gentile which are the seven
[1:30:11] churches
[1:30:12] are you there the first feast of the
[1:30:16] king
[1:30:17] was dealing with the jewish people and
[1:30:19] god use israel
[1:30:21] to display his attribute or his
[1:30:24] characteristic
[1:30:25] so that those might be for our learning
[1:30:28] or
[1:30:28] our instruction everybody here when that
[1:30:32] feast expired
[1:30:33] the second feast that followed was
[1:30:36] the feast of the gentiles which have
[1:30:39] seven days
[1:30:41] which are the seven church edges where
[1:30:43] the holy spirit
[1:30:44] the wine is given everybody have a
[1:30:47] vessel
[1:30:48] diverse from another because with the
[1:30:51] gentile
[1:30:51] god deals with them individually but we
[1:30:55] found out that
[1:30:56] when the king ushered the second feast
[1:31:01] the queen faster
[1:31:06] you okay now also i
[1:31:09] shed a feast

[1:31:55] in what the royal house
[1:31:58] which belonged to the queen
[1:32:03] where is your bible are you there
[1:32:07] the house does not belong to the queen

[1:32:34] is a king
[1:32:35] a queen queen vasta who open up a fist
[1:32:39] and her fists
[1:32:40] only include the women what does it mean
[1:32:44] by this feast
[1:32:45] you ready now as we have read
[1:32:49] the queen fastest fist or come
[1:32:53] along with the banquet of wine
[1:32:56] of the king in other words throughout
[1:32:59] the seven churches
[1:33:01] when god is deploying the holy spirit
[1:33:05] blessing filling the people under the
[1:33:08] dispensation of the holy spirit
[1:33:10] under the dispensation of the son of god
[1:33:12] the dispensation when the holy spirit is
[1:33:15] available to the gentile people
[1:33:17] there is another feast within the
[1:33:19] framework of the church
[1:33:25] the feast goes along with the church
[1:33:28] ages
[1:33:29] that feasts only include women
[1:33:32] that feast take place in the royal house
[1:33:36] which is the king's house are you there
[1:33:39] what is going on over there brother
[1:33:41] branham let's help me
[1:33:44] what about him says many symbols
[1:33:47] in the bible and god has likened his
[1:33:51] heritage here
[1:33:52] on earth his church like
[1:33:55] onto a vine
[1:33:58] he's likened them to many things like
[1:34:02] unto a
[1:34:03] woman you see vine you see a woman
[1:34:06] it's speaking about the church and this
[1:34:09] time
[1:34:10] he's speaking of his church like an unto
[1:34:13] a vine
[1:34:14] and in the vine over in kings
[1:34:17] we found a fourth vinyl
[1:34:21] and the vine look almost alike
[1:34:25] so within the womb of evil
[1:34:28] you have ken walking through and you
[1:34:32] also have
[1:34:32] able walking through when the king is
[1:34:36] having a
[1:34:37] feast for his children seven church
[1:34:39] edges
[1:34:40] there is also another vine that is
[1:34:43] having her fist
[1:34:44] within the framework of the church
[1:34:51] amen praise the name of the lord i must
[1:34:54] caution you
[1:34:56] to ever keep in mind that religion
[1:35:00] in other words spiritual matter if you
[1:35:03] like
[1:35:04] is composed of two parts
[1:35:07] that intertwine either
[1:35:10] that feast of the king and the feast
[1:35:14] of the queen intertwine
[1:35:18] are we there both of those feasts happen
[1:35:21] on the same time
[1:35:23] and both of those feasts are taking
[1:35:25] place in the same place
[1:35:29] are you following me it is composed of
[1:35:33] two parts
[1:35:34] that ain't one but our opposite
[1:35:38] they are not the same fist
[1:35:41] this feast is different than this one
[1:35:44] yet
[1:35:44] it happened on the same time in the same
[1:35:47] place
[1:35:50] cain and albert are different yet
[1:35:52] they're coming up from the same womb
[1:35:55] and their boyfriend at the same time
[1:36:00] are you there amen opposite as black and
[1:36:04] white
[1:36:04] religion and the spiritual world are
[1:36:07] made of those two trees which had their
[1:36:10] root in hidden
[1:36:12] we just saw them both of those trees
[1:36:15] buff the tree of life and the tree of
[1:36:18] the knowledge of good and evil
[1:36:20] stood in the midst of the garden
[1:36:22] remember the feast
[1:36:24] was in the court of the garden are you
[1:36:27] there
[1:36:27] and no doubt they're very branches
[1:36:30] intertwine
[1:36:31] each other thus in the ephesian church
[1:36:35] it's the sign it's that same paradox the
[1:36:38] church is made out of what
[1:36:40] good and bad two vines makes the church
[1:36:45] are you there they are like the
[1:36:49] wheat and the tears growing up
[1:36:52] side by side but one is the truth
[1:36:56] and the king has arrested the other
[1:37:00] is the force and the queen vashtia
[1:37:04] now god will speak to each one
[1:37:08] are you there so when god is speaking to
[1:37:11] the churches
[1:37:12] he doesn't only speak to the true vine
[1:37:16] he's have a message for the true vine
[1:37:18] and a message for the first vine
[1:37:21] are you there the other is false
[1:37:24] now god will speak to each one and he
[1:37:27] will
[1:37:27] talk about each one he will call them
[1:37:30] the
[1:37:31] church are we clear and only they
[1:37:35] left we really know which is the true
[1:37:38] spirit
[1:37:39] because in the elect there is the love
[1:37:41] of the
[1:37:42] truth amen praise the name of the lord
[1:37:46] the church spoken of and spoken to
[1:37:50] in the book does not refer to the pure
[1:37:54] ecclesia they elect the body of christ
[1:37:58] the blood but it speaks to the entire
[1:38:02] body
[1:38:03] of people who are called christian
[1:38:07] are you okay ken was a believer
[1:38:11] ever was a believer can worship
[1:38:14] ever worship both of them are christian
[1:38:18] are you there whether they be true
[1:38:21] or merely nominal us all israel
[1:38:24] is not israel so all christians
[1:38:28] are not christian we okay
[1:38:31] that's what we learned that the church
[1:38:34] is made up of what
[1:38:36] tuvan the true and the false
[1:38:39] both claim to know and be
[1:38:42] known of god they all have relationship
[1:38:46] both purple to speak from god
[1:38:50] both believe certain basic truth
[1:38:53] and defer on others but since
[1:38:57] bear the name of the lord being called
[1:39:00] christian
[1:39:01] and by such name bearing obviously claim
[1:39:05] a relationship to him
[1:39:08] vasta was a queen
[1:39:11] she has a relationship with the king
[1:39:15] are you there god call it what
[1:39:19] she is a queen she is a marriage
[1:39:23] are you following me okay god
[1:39:26] now holds them both responsible to him
[1:39:30] and therefore speak to each so because
[1:39:34] they call themselves christian god is
[1:39:38] obligated to speak to both of them
[1:39:40] but one is true one is bad everybody
[1:39:43] care
[1:39:44] by the brother why does god call them
[1:39:48] these churches
[1:39:49] his churches even though they are the
[1:39:51] false
[1:39:53] the truth of the matter is that they are
[1:39:56] christian
[1:39:58] but they are not christian of the spirit
[1:40:02] we okay they are christian of the flesh
[1:40:07] they are bearing their name in them
[1:40:11] mark 7 7 habit a habit in vain
[1:40:14] do they worship me teaching for doctrine
[1:40:17] the commandment of men
[1:40:18] but indeed they are christian for what
[1:40:22] else could they be
[1:40:23] a is a muhammadan that is his
[1:40:26] religion
[1:40:27] no matter how he lives he leave it
[1:40:30] because he's subscribing terry to what
[1:40:33] the quran teach
[1:40:34] in other words as long as you go to
[1:40:36] church you are christian
[1:40:38] but that is not true are you there in
[1:40:41] the same way
[1:40:42] a christian is a christian as long as he
[1:40:45] subscribed to the fact that jesus is the
[1:40:47] son of god
[1:40:48] born of a virgin was crucified died and
[1:40:51] rose
[1:40:52] that he is the savior of mankind etc we
[1:40:55] call them
[1:40:56] christians but they are not true
[1:40:58] christians they are christians of the
[1:41:00] flesh everybody clear so we found that
[1:41:03] along
[1:41:04] the feast of queen of hazzarest there is
[1:41:07] another fist
[1:41:08] the feast of investor and that fist

[1:42:57] the king organized a feast the entire

[1:52:48] to refer it
[1:52:49] a new one
[1:52:53] are we okay are you okay
[1:52:56] remember when jesus went to the feast
[1:53:00] people were drinking wine are you there

[1:53:37] we always refer it to like that these
[1:53:40] are drunk on you one
[1:53:42] spiritual one i think the best
[1:53:44] interpretation will be
[1:53:46] spiritual one as the natural wine
[1:53:49] reveal itself in stimulated power
[1:53:52] so that's the new one as he revealed
[1:53:55] there
[1:53:57] which is there so on the
[1:54:00] seventh day there is a wine that is
[1:54:03] brought to the king and that one is a
[1:54:06] new wine
[1:54:08] and when they get the king that wine he
[1:54:11] brought
[1:54:12] a revelation
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] he stimulated revelation when that
[1:54:18] revelation came
[1:54:21] the king was supposed to go get the
[1:54:23] queen
[1:54:25] but the king stop and hold himself
[1:54:28] and begin to call the chamberlain

[1:59:38] need
[1:59:38] his angel to come because paul preached
[1:59:42] important
[1:59:43] so they take the angel of paul the angel

[2:35:09] love
[2:35:10] but when the king called her she refused
[2:35:13] did she really love the king
[2:35:17] let's see she refused the commandment
[2:35:20] john 14 14

[2:35:59] you love him
[2:36:00] you must stay with the message of the
[2:36:03] hour
[2:36:06] because the message of the hour is the

[2:36:30] while it's the chamberlain that came to
[2:36:32] take you to the presence of the king
[2:36:35] denying the picture of the cloud it's a
[2:36:38] lack of love

[2:39:08] hallelujah first john chapter two
[2:39:12] verse three if you dare you can say amen
[2:39:15] first john chapter two verse three are
[2:39:18] you there
[2:39:20] watch this clearly somebody is still
[2:39:22] flipping the pages are you there
[2:39:25] and hereby we do know
[2:39:29] that we know him if we do it
[2:39:34] so the commandment came by the
[2:39:36] chamberlain
[2:39:37] for you to prove to me that you know god
[2:39:40] that you have a relationship with god
[2:39:42] you must keep the commandment first four
[2:39:46] he that says i know him and keep not
[2:39:49] he's
[2:39:51] rejected the chamberlain he's here
[2:39:56] so if you reject the message you are
[2:39:58] here
[2:39:59] you see now because god will give you a
[2:40:02] spirit of delusion
[2:40:04] to believe into her until you become
[2:40:07] yourself
[2:40:08] here a liar
[2:40:11] and the truth is not in but whoso
[2:40:14] keepeth his word
[2:40:16] in him verily is the love of god do what
[2:40:20] hereby know we that we are in
[2:40:24] if you keep the commandment of the devil
[2:40:28] she fell her face she had no head
[2:40:31] she was going to her head amen that's
[2:40:33] rebecca
[2:40:34] a woman it's her nature a woman
[2:40:38] to surrender to a man
[2:40:42] let me repeat it again a nature of a
[2:40:45] woman
[2:40:46] is to surrender to a man queen vesta
[2:40:50] refuses
[2:40:51] it's the nature of the church to
[2:40:53] surrender to who
[2:40:55] surrender to his will surrender
[2:40:59] just surrender she has not thinking of
[2:41:02] her home
[2:41:03] she take his word which is the command
[2:41:06] not somebody else
[2:41:07] if eve would have done that we have
[2:41:10] never had to die
[2:41:12] but she listened to reasoning but the
[2:41:15] real bread of christ
[2:41:17] take their headship of christ which is
[2:41:20] the seventh chamberlain because when the
[2:41:23] seven chamberlains came
[2:41:24] when we move the picture it is their
[2:41:27] head
[2:41:28] the head of christ the headship
[2:41:34] are you there the headship of christ
[2:41:37] which is there
[2:41:39] and only believes god that is real
[2:41:42] they restore brad hallelujah are you

[2:42:14] queen vasta refused
[2:42:16] they come to commit the commands of of
[2:42:18] the king's command no love
[2:42:20] no friendship by his chamberlain
[2:42:23] rejected the message
[2:42:24] therefore was the king very angry
[2:42:27] remember
[2:42:28] in the book of matthew when they sent
[2:42:31] the people and they refused the king was
[2:42:33] angry you remember yesterday okay

[2:42:53] the chamberlain were the seventh spirit
[2:42:58] the seven angels before the throne of
[2:43:01] god
[2:43:02] and their mission is to go to the seven
[2:43:04] messenger
[2:43:05] and speak to the messenger there is a
[2:43:07] difference between the seven
[2:43:09] chamberlain and the seven messenger
[2:43:12] the seven chamberlain are the seven
[2:43:14] spirit that anoints the earthly
[2:43:17] messenger

[2:45:48] seven pillars
[2:45:49] that held the gospel
