special from members of our family they go to another church good to see y'all brother Luke and sister Stephanie amen praise the Lord today is a very special day for me it's it's uh it's the birthday of somebody very special in my life my wife today amen you can ask her how old she is I'm I know better after 34 years I know better um but it's does anybody else have anything to praise God for this evening I want to go straight to the prayer request amen sister Sharon I saw it I felt that uh no I want to testify but I want everybody to understand very good English so I'll speak in French so my husband can translate in French I used to speak in English you might not really really get it praise God really I was thinking about the time Christ was those seals those seals were Christ so I started thinking I'm like yes I know they say those silver Christ so what does it have to do with me what how how am I related to those seal so I was thinking that way so some things that explaining to me because one my parents came to the message I was not born in the message my parents came in the message I was 12. so the people who came to preach the message to my family came with a Camry a message book so behind the message book there were there were a picture of the cloud over there for some reason when they showed me the picture of the cloud I felt something I never felt in my life and anointing drop unto me I started crying I started saying this is the Lord this is Jesus so those people start explaining to us saying that he sent a messenger William my own brother and um in the message of William my brother he manifested himself so much and there is something that is really really powerful with the picture that makes you cry but you will understand someday but just believe the message so I start coming the message I've been in the message since then I believe everything I believe the the cloud but this time he became very personal to me so I told God I say I believe they say when the cloud came it was the seven seven angel that came with the message that was supposed to be given to father and those that's what they call the seal and in the seal they were what they call the real message was were in the seal that's what they call the Tundras so I'm like God the tandas what is the Thunders so the Lord started explaining to me the Bible we're reading it's scripture that we see you can see in the Bible they say Adam and Eve and Adam trying to pass to to partake of the sin to save Eve that's what you see but you have to see that it's not really Adam with Eve it's Jesus Christ trying to save his bride those are those are the Thunders over there you can see in the Bible they would say uh Joseph went down in the prison he had two people in the prison with him that's what everybody would see but the Thunder for you is like Jesus Christ in the course coming to die for you so the Lord started explaining so much to me about what is the Thunders all those stuff so since that day I was I spoke with my husband this picture has been something different for me so he told me that you see it's the head in the body in in the human body you have the head and the and the and the body but the body is uh the body any movement you do or anything you do is is com is commanded by the brain the brain is the one commanding everything that's why you as the bride of Christ the head came to collect to you you don't have to worry about everything the body will connect with the body and do whatever it takes to take you out of this world he's gonna do everything because it's not up to you you are just there to say Amen connect to the Thunders connect to this message you are connected and the body will take you when it's time this picture is not anything for me it's it's my life I understand why I was attracted to that so when I see that now I understand I was called by God himself I am grateful that it will follow my dad I didn't follow my mom but the Lord called me himself I'm grateful amen I have a lot to say about Cortana everybody understood it blessed be the name of them so also for the prayer request Rebecca so this past Saturday or Sunday we went to you know my husband went to um his family's house to celebrate an early Christmas with the grandkids on his dad's grandchildren and he cooked breakfast for everybody Sunday morning and he prayed over breakfast and then afterwards he was cleaning out the pot he made grits with and there was a battery from the salt shaker that he pressed the button in the in the grits and we're like What what in the world and so I'm like okay well I'm they looked it up online and it said that it could have exploded from the heat because it had been they kind of finished cooking it with the battery oh wow and we were like I was just thanking God that nothing happened and nobody's had any any side effects from that whatever they are and hopefully nobody does but I'm just thanking God for that amen amen amen so on my wife's birthday today she's not feeling very well but she came to church amen which I think is what you're supposed to do I guess yes sir brother Sam's wife is um and I'm not oh no I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry I'm sorry because his wife is home with flu symptoms and you know and I didn't mean it that way come up and pray prayers please get me out of this you see I'm moving away from the holiest of holies when I isn't God good yeah Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be your children Lord we're so grateful to have a father that cares for us that calls us individually personally and just thinking of that quote in the crisis of mystery God revealed that God no the new birth is when Christ is revealed personally to you and so Lord Jesus we just pray that you continue to increase our understanding father Lord Jesus because the people perish because they don't have for lack of understanding but Lord the longer we sit here and the longer we listen no clearer your word becomes it increases our faith it increases our peace it helps us to get through trials without the struggle and the heartache that we used to carry father where it's all just depending upon you because you begin the good work you'll finish the good work you are the author you are the finisher you are the alpha you are the Omega and Lord God for sister Teresa Lord Jesus I just pray that you'll be there in that house and that you'll anoint her Lord with an oil of gladness Lord Jesus I know she's streaming the service she's listening to us now Lord we're so thankful for sister Edie we're so thankful for her testimony we're thank Lord God that today is her birthday Lord the anniversary Lord of when she came here on this Earth father and Lord we just pray that you'll bless her and that this will be the happiest year of her life Lord God lord Jesus I appreciate our pastor and how he says he has the best and I believe I have the best and got the best Church the best church family Lord Lord God I got the best family I got the best wife Lord Jesus we're just depending on you to see us through every snare every trap that the devil sets for us Lord Lord you knew it before he said it and you've already had the antidote so Lord Jesus tonight father we just pray that you'll anoint Our Praise you'll anoint our worship we pray Lord God that you'll anoint our precious brother Seth Lord God I'm still chewing on the last message that he brought about the Jubilee Lord and I just pray Lord that tonight Lord Jesus will be even greater yet Lord give us another step closer to your kingdom Lord Jesus I pray that you alone the giver's Lord that when they give the tithes and the offerings that'll be with a cheerful heart Lord God and that everything we think say and do will be inspired by you we ask in Jesus name amen amen amen amen so we're going to invite brother um Luke and sister Stephanie to come up amen I'm going to use this we do hey man it's good to be here you guys have a awesome worship here I love it it's some freedom in this place it's good to see all y'all last time we visited y'all's church I was in the uh the hotel yeah man it's good to see you all found in place and you're settled in God's blessing yeah somewhere fancy guitar here I don't know how to turn this thing up which one is exit well I'm just gonna sing it anyhow that's exactly right I have to go here to Worship the Lord instruments are great but if you ain't got them you just use your voice foreign [Music] what shall give me he wants my heart more than he asked for my much and one day I'll die but it won't be here my last day when I look in inside I know [Music] what shall I sing him a song for afraid from a mouthful of town a lift up my face [Music] foreign [Music] thank you you are here to do he opened his arms [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I'll hit through [Music] [Music] one year to do [Music] [Music] keep it on foreign [Music] [Music] he conquered for me and for you conquered them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] let's give the Lord the club offering again amen glory to God have you noticed that these songs goes along with the cross why the cross amen glory to God one day when you're gonna catch what is the cross it will free you from a lot of headache not even a lot of all headaches amen there is a problem in the message the people in the message don't understand the cross of everywhere amen that's why we had to preach the praise and alter amen I was reading Roman 3 Roman 4 Roman 5. and maybe one of this day the Lord will allow that we will go over that pretense because we were in the pretense the first time and then we pick it up last time when we talk about um which then go to a therapist a psychiatrist yes or no and we kind of tap into it but when you go through Roman and you see how Paul opened up the cross if you really get what the cross is amen you will be living a free life the problem is in the message we uh we created a habit of self-righteousness amen the people think like they are the one that did something and the Mr Cross completely and then automatically when you miss Calvary you're gonna have a trouble with sunset Manta because Calvary opened the door into Sunset Manta if you miss Calvary you will struggle with brother Brown I'm not even understanding what the blood means we can repeat to you that you justify the day you're gonna understand what justify really mean amen you will take that intellect man and kill it and put it on the ground amen amen uh open Roman 3. if you can everybody okay with the three points of the rapture we didn't lose anybody everybody's okay so you understand the shout the voice of the archangel and the Trump of God Amen amen if they're not clear you're going to miss everything and be troubled with what happened in 1963. and big trouble with what happened in sunset Mountain if it's not properly put together because brother Branham says he's doing all three how is he doing all three when he's descending that's the problem if you dare you can say Amen glory to God Romans 3 I'm just going to read one verse that say Romans 3 verse 19. now we know that what thinks however the law says he says to them who are under the law why that every month Maybe stopped and all the world there is no exception even you who are born in a message you who never been in a nightclub that all the world may become how guilty before who so tell me what can you present to God even if you're born from parenting a message what are you going to present God God made sure that everybody when you present before him you must be guilty amen what do you want to present to God one of this day you will catch what I just read amen but God conclude even to save the Jews because of the ignorance God have to push them toward ignorance in guiltiness and that's the only way God can pick them up there and justify them because if you come before him like a Pharisee then you're gonna miss God because you are healed there is no way they can heal you you don't need them I mean a medical doctor you don't need a physician amen but you must approach him a different way even in our repentance there is a way that have you wonder why Adam was punished have you wonder why the the curse went straight and struck the ground why didn't God forgive him why didn't God forgive Eve he turned around and he struck judgment and he said he will be having children with pain why have you ever wondered have you ever wondered when God was asking the question what were they as answering God they were doing what are you afraid they were doing what I'm just warming you up so the preacher can come in they were doing what they were passing the bar and they were just blaming one another so nobody wanted to pick up the responsibility and God struck all of them can I help you when The Prodigal Son came back what did they do to him judgment why because he did what he did what you see the way we repent do you see how we justify what we did or we passed the bucket and like this because of my father one of this day I'm gonna stop right there I just put that so your Cannon will be open okay and you will go home and chew a little bit on those kind of stuff you don't need your righteousness we need the cross of Jesus Christ that's the only thing that God will accept is not you it is that Bloody sacrifice that is sitting on the throne whose blood speak better things than the blood of Abel amen as good as able was fine born with a parent from God mother from God yet Abel could speak for vengeance his blood was lower but not the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God my wife gave you a brief summary of what she we talked about it's a deep question and answer in the night Amen in the Thunders she even turned she said the whole church need to hear something like that I say oh my God Amen and the Lord even showed me something about the seals that goes with the mathematics in Genesis and it matches correctly while I was talking to her she opened up he opened a book and I never seen it before and it was right there in Genesis that the seven seal was still rather in the Book of Genesis this message is beautiful amen if somebody struggle with the Thunders or something or you don't understand put a question and answer and we will handle it a man in detail it's very simple and we spoke about it sometimes we spoke and it takes a second touch so people can really grasp what we were saying amen glory be to the name of the Lord I will not be the one I'm not going to be the one preaching tonight brother said he's preaching tonight so giving me a little break so you continue to chill and let's hear from the Lord tonight and soak in what God wants us to understand tonight amen only believe oh We Believe oh We Believe all of things are possible [Music] only believe this oh only believe oh

you're wrong I need your all early tonight oh you're wrong I need Jesus [Music] I need you [Music] Jesus you're wrong [Music] I need amen and amen amen thank you musicians amen amen Jesus You're All I Need amen amen can we see that tonight amen amen we thank God for His blessings amen His blessings in this church we've always been blessed with his word amen and the word doesn't just come a scanty amen he comes fully loaded amen and we can chew on it for a whole year amen amen now it makes it so plane when when you're reading a scripture amen you begin to see things open up differently amen amen LeBron makes certain statements and and then once this word comes to us and then the statements of brown becomes opened up more amen amen and we bless the Lord for this ministry amen amen before I go to the word amen I just want to give a testimony amen amen last week Wednesday uh when I was leading song service I was not feeling well in my body amen I called brother John that was two hours of time and I I was like brother can you take the song service he said wow he said it was very late and and I said um I just prayed that the lord gave me strength amen and thank God he gave me strength amen and I was able to lead song service on Wednesday amen but after song service a man it multiplied my my wife had a scary night amen for I was I was in a different world Amen but she said she couldn't sleep there the way I was breathing amen it was very scary but then um while the devil came to a thought the Lord also gave her Comfort amen and then she believed it and then went throughout the night amen woke up the following morning she called brother Stephen and apparently it was a flu amen so we talked about Stephen and we we thank God that we have a pastor who is a medical doctor amen amen in fact if you're not blessed I am blessed a teacher Pastor Medical Doctor full package amen amen and amen amen amen so give me the direction of me to follow um the prescription that he gave amen and then you know one thing with me is that when when I become ill or become sick my enemy is food amen it's very hard for me to eat amen so it was so tough recovering amen and uh I had an exams to take on Monday I had two presentations amen and it was really hard to get prepared and I remember Monday when I was about taking the exams I knew my body was weak but I was trying to study but you get to that point where you're trying to steady but nothing goes into your head and and that was what was going on with me but I before the exams I just bowed down my head and I prayed and I said God you know these exams I'm not the one that is going to write it but I need you to do it amen and then when the exam started it was just flowing like that that I just want to thank God for what he did amen this it might look like something so small but the Lord did something wonderful that I appreciated amen amen and I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that I'm even here standing tonight amen it is not it is not easy when you're being called to come to the pulpit to preach amen it's not easy amen so when the pastor comes here with a full package we really understand what he goes through amen amen for us we just bring something little but he has to bring a lot of food amen and we appreciate him so much we appreciate the ministers in this church Brother Sam amen can we give a club or friend unto the Lord amen Better Sound brother poorly cow brother Kelly amen and amen amen we just appreciate them so much amen and we appreciate the musicians amen amen my my my big chief musician even though he tries to reverse the name Amen Brother John amen and all that teammate man we're so grateful for their lives amen amen we just want to be upstanding this evening even as you take this scripture amen amen we go to the Book of Romans amen Romans chapter 12. said I beseech you therefore Brethren amen by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies and even sacrifice

feeling of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus tonight Lord father may you move me outside Lord Jesus and speak your word to us oh god father it is not easy to stand before the bride of Christ Lord Jesus of God because this is a bride that you are calling to go with that spot oh god father wrinkle Lord Jesus of God and that is what the word is coming oh god father the word mixed with the blood oh god

Jesus of God and Father oh God may we be acceptable oh god father to you Lord Jesus to God we thank you Lord we bless you in Jesus Christ and we pray amen and amen amen amen now I just want us to read uh my teacher up to five or six amen it says blessed Matthew 5 6 amen it's a blessed are they which do Hunger and test after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are they which hunger and test after righteousness for they shall be filled I was just thinking about this it didn't just say just hunger he said hunger and thirst so it has both the meat and then they drink amen so the feeling of the Holy Ghost comes with a meat offering and then the drink offering amen and amen it is that word that comes mixed with blood amen and amen I just I just take my mind back to Sunday's preaching amen that word that has come and mixed with the blood amen and amen amen is always meat and drink offering amen I in in John chapter 6 let's read John chapter 6. John chapter 6 verse 53. he said then Jesus said unto them very very I say unto you except ye eats the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he have no life in you blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen he said whosoever verse 54 whoso is that my flesh and drinking my blood had eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day amen for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelled in me and I in him as the as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he either so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your Father's Day eat Manner and are dead he that heated of this bread shall live forever amen and amen so we are talking about this bread that was given by the son of man amen amen and amen bread and blood amen and amen so um as we had on Sunday as he began he's supposed to complete something amen and amen I I I'll come back to this now when we look at the bloody word amen the bloody word has a cleansing power so when the when the word is coming and it's bloody the main intention is to come to cleanse you up yes sir amen and amen it's not just a word that is coming to you for you to look out for you to see for you to understand that the the word has a purpose of coming into you to cleanse you up amen and and I I find this um a big problem amen that we can describe the word so much we explain the message of the hour we explain the seals we explain all the standards we explain everything but then the life the reason why the sales came to us is it it's not living in US amen then what is the purpose of knowing the word what is the purpose of the seals the purpose of the seals is coming to cleanse you up [Applause] amen and amen it's it it's just like um I I come here with with my with a messy hair amen and then somebody looks at me and the first question would be like don't you have a hairbrush right that's the question you're going to ask and and when you ask me that question I'll be like you know I have like 25 different kinds of hair brushes in my closet you know I'll give you descriptions you know some uh Brown some black some are pink stuff and I can even show you the locations that I have that that have placed all those hair brushes you're going to look at me that is this guy crazy so why are you not using it it is either I'm lying to you or there's something wrong with me that is the message of the hour amen the message of the hour is coming to cleanse you up not for you to explain to people you know that that is the word that we normally use you understand people build that war you know when you're trying to talk to people about trying to clean up your life you know they want to show to you that I know the message [Applause] pray to my brother I know the message you know I know the message you know but around this but continue giving you all the stories and everything and you look at them you're like okay wow you know the message but where is the life [Music] amen amen what is the purpose of the message of the hour as we learn on Sunday is to come to cleanse you up yes my brother amen and amen and and I was just pondering over this and it's brought me up to something that Brad Brown said what a sin amen sin is unbelief now looking at that that um statement just opened up to me in a different way and I was just seeing the rapture foreign [Laughter] but those are the attributes of sin now now we get to understand that something has to have a source before you see the manifestation so Brian Brown says when you say okay then I'm going to drink I'm going to do all this stuff it means you didn't even believe in the same in the first place amen so this unbelief is taking place in the spiritual mind now when when when this spiritual man is able to overcome this unbelief then we have a manifestation in the flesh so that just gave me an opening of the concept of the rapture so what what this man this son of man is coming to us I still work for amen overcoming a spiritual a short Force amen this is trying to open us up or open our flesh so that our flesh get consumed that is the transformation so I was like wow that's just a rupture amen amen um I was I was so much thrilled amen um on Sunday when sister I started preaching amen I was so much thrilled on Sunday when sister Rosemary gave her testimony after the preaching amen Brown said that um man is always looking at things in the past things that God did in the past things that he's going to do in the future but what is going on today [Applause] amen so God just came down to confirm his work he he was just confirming the word that the Rapture is linked to your physical body amen a transformation in your body so God is sending the word to bring transformation to your physical body and that is the rapture amen and amen amen I was just thinking about it and it's I was so blessed by that it reminded me of one time we went for service and and one of the churches in Georgia and then um the minister was preaching um about um the the stages of a butterfly from the air to the lava to the people stage and going to uh the state that it flies amen and then after that preaching my wife and I went home and um so as you know the bride always like to take pictures amen amen so you know um the son of man knowing that the bride knows uh wants to take pictures that's why he always gives the bride pictures amen so it's it's just in line amen amen amen taking selfie with the Lord amen amen so I mean we're just take pictures I mean um and then sometimes you look at those pictures and you you you're like Lord has been so good in our lives amen not she she just takes them to look at What the Lord Has Done amen amen and we just appreciate the work of the Lord in our lives and in her life amen I'm so grateful to the Lord amen amen it's it's been quite difficult um last week and this week she's taking care of me with low blood pressure blood pressure one time you go to like 72 I mean that that's the systolic was 72 the diastolic was like in the 50s and she was taking care of me amen and I I just I just thank God for her life amen amen and you know where we're taking this selfie after the preaching and then she was like as you know she calls me baby man she it's like big look look look I said look at what look at the butterfly he didn't want to leave there was a butterfly that came on my head and stood there and he didn't want to leave so I was like okay what what is going on and then the Lord dropped in my heart that you remember the preaching the minister was confirming something to you that becomes life amen amen and amen so what when the preaching comes from the pulpit and the Lord brings a manifestation amen he makes it living amen it is not a dead word but a Living Word [Applause] amen amen amen so I I just want to talk about um what I'm preaching about tonight amen amen even if we started preaching amen this is my subject Christ is both Savior and Lord so with a subheading doors within the main door doors within the main door Christ is both savior and Lord now Brad Brown said that the problem we have is we keep Christ as the savior but not Lord now I still look at this and it's connected to the Rapture to me it is he said that we we always ask Christ to come to the main door and then ask him to stay at the entrance of the door but we have so many other doors we we without Christ okay you know be the be the Savior that means just stand at the entrance but those are the doors they are closed now how is Christ going to operate when we we make him to do that or we make him remain there why is he coming he's coming to fill up the whole house amen he's coming to fill up the horse but we asked him to stay at the entrance Amen brother Brown said that is making him just savior Baptist Lord [Music] we can talk about how he delivered us we can talk about how he healed us of the grace of God I was here I was in that I was this and the Lord Lifted Me Up and that's it Beachbody no problem says that Christ is interested in even how you walk he's interested in even the food you are eating he's interested in your conversations he's interested in the places you're going to he's interested in your morning he's interested in your afternoon it's interesting your evening he's interested in your Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday foreign we want to look at the concept of a house amen [Music] now a house amen has a main door main entrance and let's let's just say that somebody comes visit you amen and you open up the main door people outside will say okay there's this visitor that is in Social and so's house right those outside will see always who who think that the visitor is in your house but the prophet said if the visitor can't come to your kitchen if the visitor can come to your living room what are you saying it means you're not welcome so many times amen we invite Christ to the main door and people outside think we have Christ but then we do not allow him to operate we are taking it slow amen just enjoy it like that sometimes we have ministers that come to shout and amen and amen amen the whole place will be on fire but sometimes we have we have these things that we sit down and listen to it and La Pond over it amen no this this is how I was looking at it the main door is Christ connecting that with the concept of Christ in the bride the main door is Christ but Christ has a many members bride which are the various doors within the main house foreign he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart said that the hand has to do with manifestation you taking the word of God and doing it he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek that face oh Jacob sailor lift up your hearts all ye gates all you get this is typing something and being lift up ye Everlasting doors [Music] and the king of glory shall come in lift up your heads oh you get and being lift up I'm just looking at bro ties this to the Old Testament since types it to the Rapture of the Old Testament Saints but it is typing Us in these last days problem connects that to the scripture that links to us the Rapture of the Bride I'm going to read quotes from that amen so who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord might in battle amen lift up your head till he gets even lift them up ye Everlasting doors Everlasting doors that means we are predestinated before the foundation of the world to be Everlasting throughout eternal life amen and the king of glory shall come in who is the skin of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory Silla amen I'm I'm going to read some quotes here amen you want to stay in line with the prophet always now before I come to the king of glory I just want to read a letter about uh what the prophet talks about being savior and being Lord amen this from the message the door to the heart amen it's not let's examine was preached in 58 I said now let's examine some of these doors one of them is a little door of self you know that's an important little door in fact down the line I'll come to the doors that uh babram talked about but just this summer he said you say oh yes Jesus I'll receive you as my savior but now don't meddle in my business [Music] I said that's the attitude of lots of Christians so-called now I want to live my own life but I don't want you so he says Jesus is already your savior don't meddle with my business and you don't you don't stand and talk to Jesus like that it is your attitude I want you to keep me from hell but don't meddle in my affairs well then the prophet said Jesus can't have the preeminence Jesus can't be your lord because you want to be your own ruler amen now this is from the message at the unity of one God in one church he said he heals their soul and their body he takes the control room if you got fears and doubts just let it go now let him begin let him come in and take over let him be Lord Lord is ruler lordship is rulership amen is is it's just like a husband and a wife you know I mean at the beginning before you even get married amen with all um this I had a dream I saw blue colors I saw pink matching together and you were the pink you all those words they are so sweet amen and in fact we've all gone through that before we man it's all sweet amen and your your your first uh stage in in marital life amen things I mean things are going so beautiful we're not oh you know the husband is buying things and things get so sweet at the beginning stages right now we want to talk about lordship yes sir that is where we have a lot of problems in marriages because the man is not bringing you to the home for fairy tale he's bringing you to the home to face reality without lordship in that home the marriage is going to be a big problem foreign that's the same way with Christ I'm as we've had we are the feminine version of God amen so the husband is also a wife to Christ [Applause] amen and and and and assert Christ becomes the Lord of that husband that husband cannot replicate lordship thank you my brother amen because when when the husband is able to understand how to be a wife it becomes easy to understand their wife amen the same way when the wife is able to be a wife to Christ she can understand how to be a wife to the husband reach my brother amen so it goes everywhere amen amen amen the message is talking about Redemption amen and and and our homes is the message of the hour what goes on in our homes it's just preaching the message of the hour amen it says this is from Queen of Sheba and she's the one say father may people believe it as truth and receive thee tonight as their healer as their savior as their King as their lord lordship to cover to rule in their lives Grant the Lord and I believe that's our prayer tonight amen I want to talk about uh the skin of glory amen he said he said when he conquered death that's restoration of the Bright Tree in 62 when conquered death held grave sickness rose on the third day he ascended on high and led captivity captive what was it those that were in captive had looked forward for the promise that we have now he's talking about the Old Testament things he said oh brother never even had the Holy Ghost they didn't have the Holy Ghost but believed and give a good testimony and by it they stuck the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword women received their dead race to life again without their promise said oh but they looked forward under a ship sacrifice that could not divorce sin It could only cover sin but they believed that there was coming one and by their faith Way Beyond The Shadow amen they claimed it and steadfast they've wandered in deserts and ship skins and goat skins was afflicted and destitute and tormented all those people looking forward to that resurrection and truth that died in faith with a testimony and on that Easter morning that law of God which was spoke the word true Joe and those are the prophets they rest from the dead said oh my not this in the message the Rapture 65 he said David said over there lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be lifted up he let captivity captive and give gifts unto men when the Old Testament sent went in with him they said who is the skin of righteousness the Lord Of Glory Mighty in hosts Mighty hosts here they come in marching Jesus led captivity captive and here he comes with the Old Testament Saints and went into the new gates up there and said lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in The Voice come from the inside said who is the king of glory it's the Lord Mighty battle the gate flew open and Jesus the Conqueror LED captivity captive them that had believed on him and the word had come to them they're the Old Testament sits laying in there waiting he led captivity captive ascended and high took the Old Testament sins and went in amen there's one Rapture already passed the next Rapture takes place a second Thessalonians for the church their pride to be resurrected to be raptured into Glory we which are alive and remain that's the body that's left on it will not prevent or heal the dam which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound first and the deadly Christ shall wreck right see and we reach our life and remain shall be caught up together with him with them amen what are we talking about said we love you this door to the heart so we love you and we cherish you and we throw all of our heart open Lord let the king of glory come in lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in taking full possession Our Savior and Lord our skin as director as Governor as give of Peace as director of our part granted Lord we ask it in the name of him that taught us all to pray amen the prophet is linking this thing to our rapture pin up these dogs and let that king of glory come in I don't know if I'm making any sense amen open up these doors and let the skin of Glory come in amen I just hope we have enough time to Max in bed let us go back to um Romans chapter 12. said I beside you therefore bravery by the mercies of God that he present your bodies the natural man amen present your body is a Living Sacrifice holy no he's talking he's talking to Brethren who has saved Brethren who said I'm taking Jesus that's my Lord a personal savior he's telling them that let there be a manifestation that comes to your bodies he said holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be it transformed be transformed by the renewing of your mind so it's starting from somewhere a spiritual battle is starting from somewhere in the spirit that might count that brings a transformation to your body [Music] be transformed by the renew of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen that's the brings us to what program talks about what sin is so it starts in the spiritual and manifest in the physical amen that is I see the rupture amen the Rapture has an aim of coming to transform this body amen transformation what a transformation not from the message power of transformation 65. it says to be transformed is to be changed and make something different it's like a tadpole let's transformed from a tadpole to a front C once he looked like a catfish or when she attacked sometimes you look at those days when we're kids while we're going to play in the river amen when we see those Star Pool we thought they were fishes and then you try to catch them you realize that somebody tells you that no those are frogs you're like okay you didn't do a frog they look like catfish amen so so the prophet said once he looked like a catfish he swims around he's got a head and he's and he's still and everything looks like a catfish you what when that Master comes to the main door people think you are Christian so you are looking like a catfish then after a while he begins to lose he loses a tail and he's transformed from one species to another so that transformation it is allowing Christ to get to all these doors because their intention is that all these doors look like the main door [Applause] these doors are the many membered body of Christ now Christ who is the main door is trying to transform all these doors to look like him amen act like him I think that's what Paul must have had in mind when he said be transformed by the renewal let's see let me get that right and be not conformed amen be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing of your mind the things that you once start upon to be precious lay that aside and be transformed to something else yes sir yes things that you're talking with precious to you he said lay them aside and be transformed to something else you might think this tadpole looks like a catfish it looks so precious but that is not the main aim it's supposed to be a frog amen I said oh that's what we all want to know how to do it is that we are here we love him he saved us now we want to know what to do and we are trying to take a little step this evening to raise up just a little bit higher sometimes we have to hate things you just hold on for a few but brother sometimes you have to hit things what are those things don't meddle in my business sometimes the pastor needs to hate things our personal business and and I I I I'm talking about the kind of friends you have you know we've been friends for years I mean I mean we've been going out for years amen and and this person is taking you off the Life of Christ but when the word of God comes you say don't meddle in my business your lord amen I said now we want to be transformed ourselves by the renewing of our mind see not what we have on this Earth what we are going to look for on this Earth but as I said what we are going to look for on this Earth but what we are coming to in the world that is to come it's not what we are looking for in this Earth but what we are coming to in the world to come transformed by the renewing of our mind amen same message he said and I believe it was David said I would rather be a doormat at the house of the Lord than to do all intents with the wicked you see no matter what it is take my place sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has called you to I'm sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying see that sometimes the very dearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in Christ to where God has called you [Applause] amen but what's God doing transforming you from what you want maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely firmly sometimes a lovely family we've got we've got families that are so sweet and so nice sometimes you're just praise the Lord can you make a wizard you also get a portion in heaven amen those are the hot stuff from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it is his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price is amen the flashing red lights of the sign of his coming in 63. so we thank thee for Jesus Christ who made it possible that we could be back into Divine fellowship with thee again through the shedding of his innocent blood that truth that propitiation of that blood we now are Sons and Daughters of God it does not yet appear what we shall be at the end but we know we'll be like him for we shall see him as he is and father that's all sufficient for us as long as we are like him standing in the form of his image he said that now father we do not want to be at this hour conformed to the things of the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit by the holy ghost that he might come and take our lives into his own care that is lordship amen and will lead us and guide us for what days we have left upon the Earth and magnify his great name we thank you for all these things and with expectations we look for your visit with us tonight that is expectation tonight amen as you've gathered him now and believing that you meet with us as you promised in Jesus name amen amen I want to take this also from the message part of transformation The Stone 65 amen just trying to hurry up amen that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life transform from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word amen talking about transformation transformation what I'm trying to say transformation has to do with this body amen it starts in the spirit and comes to manifest in the body amen amen I so um I just took a few notes from this message amen I I believe we we might be closing very shortly the doors indoor the prophet said Jesus wants to be Lord not just savior he wants rulership amen now he talks about a main door now now we want to get into this he talks about main door to your heart so Jesus Christ comes to your heart as a savior now he talks about three main doors after Jesus comes into your heart and he said there's one at the right side called the door of pride right side oh my goodness that door of pride the prophet said that I am so so and so I am this I am that oh Christ you saved me oh my Lord I'm happy now he wants to change you I am so sorry so I I'm I'm trying to give an example like we in Ghana from Ghana amen amen we have what you call day boards like let's say you're born on a Monday um they give you a name depending on what kind of tribe you came from and on Tuesday you have names and all that and people take upon themselves those names okay I was born on a Wednesday I'm using myself an example I was born on a Wednesday and this is our Wednesday bones behave so when you begin to misbehave and then they come to you and try to correct you they correct your life you're like you know Wednesday boys this is how we behave oh my goodness the prophet is saying he wants to be your lord he wants to come to that door of selfishness amen he wants to rule a a through that door take away who you think you are and be the pride of Christ amen that's a very hard door to knock on Hitman I'm not talking about you realizing who you are in the world that's not what I'm talking about because we are supposed to be the one the bride of Christ this is our mirror we look into it and it tells us who we are that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about you born insane shift in iniquity coming speaking lies you are born on them on a Wednesday okay I am a quick cuckoo that's that's how we call Wednesday boss yeah so no that that that's not it God wants to take preeminence over that door the person next to that door is a door of private life oh my God that's another hard one your privileges your money your dressing where you visit your body movement even the music you listen to see that there's this question that would always need to ask ourselves what I'm doing assuming Jesus is standing there am I going to behave the same way that is lordship the way I talk to a brother or the way I talk to a sister if Jesus was standing there did I do it right the way the way um I reacted when when the preaching came now I'm bringing it home the way I reacted when the preaching came did I really see Jesus talking to me if I really believe Jesus Christ was talking to me why that reaction so I'm saying Jesus you can rule over my business amen this kind of preaching that makes us look so quiet amen amen amen it's it's it it soaks deep down and we sit down we Ponder variety oh I I'm not saying I've had everything perfect amen because when I was the prophet said that you the minister you are the first person that the word comes to you have to correct your life first amen so I'm preaching to myself amen so the person let's do that is the door fit I'm just closing That Door of Faith is your previously held beliefs that's a hard one previously held beliefs amen when the word of God is coming to you do you use your previously held beliefs to block their way what you knew in the message for years and the spirit of God is explaining to you and you are seeing it being Vindicated from scripture to scripture what you already had 20 years 30 years 40 years in the message are you going to open up for the word to come and clear things up and correct this in your life amen amen there's there there's this thing I'm I'm closing I've said I'm closing for a number of times there's this thing that Believers okay we are amongst Believers we want to clean ourselves up okay say about the evidence of the Holy Ghost believing the message of your day now I believe that a hundred percent amen but the application of it amen they believe the message of the day so when you are in sin they think that they have the Holy Ghost the message of your day now becomes your comfort zone amen your message believer becomes a comfort zone that's a door of faith that you are holding but intellectual exactly that you are holding on to but Christ wants to open the understanding for you to see that the message of your day is a manifestation in your flesh [Music] amen it is not just knowing it in your head amen it's a manifestation in your flesh so when you are doing something wrong it doesn't matter if you're going to a message church or you're believing the sales where you're believing the time they say man you've got to express that amen and that is what is taking us to the rapture amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen so um it's it's just a short message to us amen so it's the Lord just your savior or you're going to allow him to be the Lord of your life is he going to rule and govern your life is it going to rule and govern your your pride take away your pride is it coming in to to to govern your private life that how how you give money how you do things how you even think the manifestation of gift Paul is saying we we manifest gifts according to the grace that was given to us amen amen so when we are manifest we are manifesting our gifts it must be according to the grace in this last days we we didn't get to that but that's also in Romans chapter 12 amen amen is God being the ruler of distance that's a question amen amen we thank the lord we bless the Lord can we give you a club offering unto the Lord amen amen amen amen amen so I'm just going to invite brother Stephen amen and if the musicians can come up amen amen amen I just want um to help brother John out with this song I surrender amen if amen that means part of the musicians in many standing here asking for the music to be played amen but if brother Michael can just played in see a man we just sing it and invite brother Stephen amen if you just want to surrender tonight I have the message that the Lord brought to us tonight you just want the Lord to be your
