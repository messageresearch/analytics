So, brother Marion and Sister Hadi, let's stand so we can welcome you as a family member. [applause] Welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. We say amen. We shout. So, you're not a visitor, you're part of the family. Feel free like a home. And Lord's willing after church we will shake hand. If there is anybody else that I have forgotten, forgive me. But you're more than welcome. Good to see brother Captain and uh Jeffrey back there and uh good to see the baby. [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt; But as a pastor, I would say good to see you, Sister Angela. [laughter] Amen. It says been a while, but God's grace. If there is anybody else, forgive me. God richly bless you. And again, welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. I'm going quickly to my announcement. Uh I believe we all up to date with the sermon. We're reading our Bibles twice a day, our cood book, church ages. I was talking to my wife this morning. I say there are so much in this message that we can only give to a certain level on the pulpit. If I sit down and begin to give you everything in detail the way brother Brandham gave, I would take one subject one month, one sermon, one month, one month, one month, one month. So it behooved the Christian to go home and to take the church ages and you read yourself more detail than what we are giving to you. Then you will see for yourself the history, the background behind things and it help you understand things better. But if you are those Christian that only listen to the pastor and go home and mind their businesses, then you're going to get in trouble. Especially in the time like this when everybody can put anything on YouTube. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to know for yourself. I'm going to put quote here, but you need to listen to the message yourself. Listen to the 70 weeks. Listen to the seal. Listen to adoption. And listen to the message of William Marion Brham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord's willing, not this uh sun uh this Wednesday, but the 31st is going to be not this coming, but the next one is going to be our New Year's Eve. And it's at 8:30. That's when we started. And we will have the Lord's Supper. It fell on Wednesday. So, we pick up the Wednesday all the way to uh Thursday.

And we will continue to move on by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got a daddy a baby dedication that was given to me this morning. That's why I had to uh search for the slide. Thank God I found slide 126 had a baby dedication. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we will dedicate leader Noah Mopongo. Mama almost lost her life &gt;&gt; because of baby Noah. So Noah came right on time. &gt;&gt; So you can sing with me. Bring them in. And brother John is there. You can lead. Bring them in as brother John, brother Joel and sister Dy can bring the baby. And we will dedicate little Noah Mopolongo. My friend Noah. Welcome to spoken word. First time in prayer in the church. Welcome. [applause] Praise God. You can sing. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring [singing] them little one to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the scripture and the quote that I usually read. Then we pray for the baby. The Bible says in the book of Luke 15:E1 16, "And they brought unto him also what &gt;&gt; little infant that he would touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto him and say, suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God." So baby dedication, it's scriptural. According to the message they talking in 1963 in uh September the 1st in the morning, brother Brandham say that you know when I see little fellows like that, he always take me back when I was a little boy and now the old saying is you know they on your feet now and your heart later but I don't believe it shall be so when we dedicate them to the Lord. That's the reason why we give the children back to the Lord because he's the truly the children are in they they are an inheritance from the Lord. They are not even our children &gt;&gt; even though they look like us &gt;&gt; but they belong to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what we doing with a dedication we are taking what God gave it to us and say we don't know how to handle it. We're bringing that back to you again so that you handle it because whoever is in the hand of God, the devil cannot plag him up. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham say when you dedicate them, he doesn't believe that they will trample on your heart later. Brother Brandham say we have a responsibility here and God placed this in your hand. He made a preacher out of you. I always say about women preachers, you know, but every mother, sister daddy is a preacher. Here is her congregation to raise these little fellows. Right. While daddy is sleeping, &gt;&gt; while daddy's doing what? &gt;&gt; H while daddy is working. And you got a responsibility. God bless you both. You got a fine little family. Brother Joe, you have a wonderful family and sister debt. Amen. &gt;&gt; My friend, welcome. It has been a while now. You look a little chubby, my friend. Welcome, brother Noah. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Sorry, sister Sharon. I got him first. Praise God. Amen. Okay, you can all pray with me and the parent. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you again humbly this morning. Father thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy and for this great token gift of love that you have given to this family and not only to the family but to the church in addition of brother Noah Mopalongo.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, I believe I got everything covered by the grace of God. So now let's go straight to our reading of the scripture and flight attendant prepare for takeoff. Give me one second. I need to go back to slide 1154. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Wow." &gt;&gt; This message is eternal. &gt;&gt; You don't joke with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message have touched the the the the uncarchable riches of Christ.

Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me, Lord. But when it comes to ministering to your children, I'm completely unable. Father, it takes the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit to move me and the congregation away so you can come and minister and bless and feel and heal and be everything and all for everybody, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, come down in the power of resurrection. Speak to our soul Lord. We rebuke the devil away from this place and thank you as we commit it all in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Exodus chapter 34. If you do good, we will get to this parable. But you got the background pretty good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with sport, go listen to the sermon that I gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Okay? We don't believe in men wearing shorts. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We don't believe in that. &gt;&gt; God can give you money when you're sitting at home. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 91. &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon say the team are so small. So I told sister Adasa to increase the team because when somebody sees 91 they say wow by the time I go one two three four. So we make the team bigger by God's grace. The team this morning [laughter] is Have I said something wrong? [laughter] &gt;&gt; A mysterious [laughter] a mysterious season. Ah, Lord have mercy. People say, "You want to be a pastor? You want to be a pastor?" Makes you where God calls you. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Makes you where God calls you. You're going to have a deacon here. Trusty are here. Everybody's I'm I'm I'm checked everywhere. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, you are alert. &gt;&gt; A mysterious season in the parable. [laughter] Oh Lord. In the parable. In the parable of the 10 pound. Oh Lord. Of the 10 pound. I don't know how they going to make this bigger. But technician knows what to do. I stay away from that one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to serve the Lord and know what you want to do. know what you signing your paper for &gt;&gt; cuz we will check your dressing, we will check your suit, we will check your tie, we check you, you you going through inspection. &gt;&gt; In the morning I go through inspection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I say to my daughter, what do you think? She says ask mom, I know the inspection fair [laughter] because both of them synchronize together. If one say yes, I go to the other one. Yes, correct me. And and and one was in another room and another one was in another room. And if one say check mom, I say inspection is already fair. Just take it completely and then move and get another thing. Amen. [laughter] Uh they will get me after service. Anyway, I got the deacon. Okay. Uh Exodus 34. Exodus 34. It's good when we do things like that, it loosen you up because something is coming. &gt;&gt; Exodus 34 verse one. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. Now you understand the background clearly of Exodus. You understand what's happening here? So I'm going to touch up quickly. We move. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse one. And the Lord said to Moses, "Do what? &gt;&gt; Do thee two tables of stone." &gt;&gt; We understand this clearly now. &gt;&gt; Amen. like unto the first you might be seated and I will write upon this table the word that were in the first table which you broke. So clearly this is the first table. Everybody's clear. &gt;&gt; And remember this one Moses is going to you the table. He's taking two stone. He moving with the stone but nothing is written in the stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We took it all the way to our days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is stone and nothing is written there. &gt;&gt; The first stone everything was written there and he was broken. &gt;&gt; He stayed there 40 days and 40 night and brother Brandham say he was fasting &gt;&gt; just like Jesus was fasting &gt;&gt; because Moses was a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses is going to the mountain with something that look like this. But there is nothing written there. &gt;&gt; And God have to give the interpretation of the unwritten stone. &gt;&gt; We are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. The interpretation &gt;&gt; of the unwritten &gt;&gt; unwritten word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse uh two. And be ready in the morning and come up in the morning to Monsana which is called also Hore. We went through this &gt;&gt; and present yourself there to me in the top of the mountain. So it cannot be done below the mountain. &gt;&gt; You have to climb high &gt;&gt; on the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To God. &gt;&gt; We talking about a mountain. You come all the way in this way &gt;&gt; because somebody come on top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Not under the mountain. on top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job 2:5. [clears throat] And the Lord descended in a cloud. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We got a mountain. &gt;&gt; And what came out there? &gt;&gt; So, the cloud comes with God. When the cloud is coming, &gt;&gt; God is in the cloud. [screaming] &gt;&gt; This is the Bible. &gt;&gt; I have not even say brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; The Bible and the message I have one. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; So God comes in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the cloud is not SOMETHING NEW. LORD, &gt;&gt; THAT cloud was given to us for reference. &gt;&gt; Because God is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If he was yesterday in the cloud today, he must come how? &gt;&gt; In a cloud. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy when you're moving like this. So, we moving pretty good. We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him water. &gt;&gt; There &gt;&gt; God was standing. &gt;&gt; I didn't see this at home. I just saw it now. &gt;&gt; God was standing. &gt;&gt; Standing in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I want to hear amen from that corner. Amen. Ah, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; God was standing. &gt;&gt; So if you look at God, &gt;&gt; I'm just picking up an example. &gt;&gt; God was standing. &gt;&gt; And do you know that when he descended, there was something in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; He descended with a law. It's written in the Bible &gt;&gt; that God when he descended on Sana, he was coming with a law. &gt;&gt; You don't know that. &gt;&gt; Ah, you already know. Let's move on. If you don't know it, see me after church. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord stood there with the [laughter] with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This this this paso Pentecostus, &gt;&gt; the Lord is proclaiming the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 28 so we don't get lost because if you touch those it suck you to some different channel to verse 28 and he was there with the Lord how many days &gt;&gt; 40 days and what &gt;&gt; and 40 nights &gt;&gt; and he did neither eat bread nor drink water &gt;&gt; water &gt;&gt; it's a it was a rep it was a prefigure a tap of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he wrote let me leave it I can't let me read it and he wrote upon the tables, the word of the covenant, the ten commandment. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when Moses came from Mount Sana with the two tables of the test of testimony in Moses uh in uh in Moses hand when he came down from [clears throat] the mount that Moses knew not that he that the skin of his face did what? shown while he talked with him. &gt;&gt; So when Moses was coming down, Moses when Moses was coming down, &gt;&gt; go back to uh to the beginning and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sana with the two table of the of testimony in Moses what? &gt;&gt; So how many handh held the testimony? &gt;&gt; Can you read please with me? If you do like this, this sermon will go next Sunday. How many hand? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; One hand. &gt;&gt; So Moses was coming up with uh &gt;&gt; with two tables in one hand. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So a prophet &gt;&gt; holding two tables not with two hands &gt;&gt; with one hand. &gt;&gt; I assume he was the right hand. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because brother Brandham said the majority of men and most of men were right-handed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So he had the table of the law on right hand. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 29. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as he was descending that Moses knew not &gt;&gt; that the skin of what &gt;&gt; his face &gt;&gt; did what? &gt;&gt; Shown. &gt;&gt; What? What? &gt;&gt; He talked with him. &gt;&gt; So when he was coming down his face was shining. &gt;&gt; So he was a human being. with a face shining &gt;&gt; and a book in the hand. &gt;&gt; Are you lost? &gt;&gt; A human being, &gt;&gt; a human being. &gt;&gt; So if Moses stand like this, you will see a human being &gt;&gt; with a face shining &gt;&gt; and a book in the hand &gt;&gt; and the book the book that he had in the hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Was the stone with the interpretation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this was not the first table. &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully my friend. &gt;&gt; When Moses went and pick up the first table, his face never &gt;&gt; shine. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The face of Moses shine with the second table. &gt;&gt; Not the first one. &gt;&gt; The first one he came down. Nobody say that his face was shining. &gt;&gt; He took the table and broke it. &gt;&gt; But when he went with the stone &gt;&gt; that was not written. &gt;&gt; And God put the ring on the stone. WHEN MOSES CAME THAT SECOND time &gt;&gt; with the stone interpreted SIR &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION were the thunders &gt;&gt; we need to go back again on next understanding because when God spoke it was what &gt;&gt; so it was the interpretation of the thunders &gt;&gt; Israel heard boom &gt;&gt; and God by boom he saying I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; So what was written on the stone was the interpretation or the meaning of the thunders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE THUNDER WERE revealed &gt;&gt; upon a stone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? THE FACE of Moses begin to shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the interpretation &gt;&gt; of the thunders &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the unwritten stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the unwritten stones &gt;&gt; brought the face to shine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That was verse uh 29. Verse 30. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold the face of his king did what? &gt;&gt; Shown. &gt;&gt; And they were how? &gt;&gt; Afraid to come nigh him. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 33. So we save time. And till Moses has done what? &gt;&gt; Speaking with them, &gt;&gt; he did what? He put a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; So, Israel was afraid &gt;&gt; to look at Moses &gt;&gt; because it was not natural for a man face to shine like that. &gt;&gt; And because of fear, Moses ended up begin to put a veil &gt;&gt; upon his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A veil was put upon the face of Moses, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They put a veil. In the New Testament, it's written like this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And until Moses has done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him with the Lord, he took off the fa the veil of the faith. The veil of remember he was a battery. &gt;&gt; He's going to be charged." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And until he came out. So when God was talking to Moses, Moses and God were seeing face to &gt;&gt; face. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Normally God was supposed to talk to Israel &gt;&gt; face to face. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; Israel refuse and put a mediator. &gt;&gt; Now the mediator is the only one who sees God. In other words, he sucked God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses was taking God &gt;&gt; into a capacity that a human being can handle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go to Duke Power and you use your computer to the generator, &gt;&gt; Amen. Your computer will be burned &gt;&gt; because the intensity is too strong. &gt;&gt; But in your home, they use a converter &gt;&gt; that take the intensity and bring it to the level THAT YOU CAN MANAGE &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN HOOK YOUR COMPUTER and be able to use electricity. SO MOSES WAS ABLE TO WITHSTAND GOD. &gt;&gt; He was at a LEVEL TO STAND and watch God. AND HE WATCHED GOD SO MUCH UNTIL THE IMPACT OF GOD ENTERED MOSES. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRHAM TO BE PRECISE HE SAID THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS IN MOSES. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS WORD, HE WILL NEVER RETURN VOID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE MUST FULFILL THAT WHICH HE WAS SENT FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WILL FULFILL IT IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? OVER THERE. IT'S SO QUIET. BROTHER, SHOUT SO MUCH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? LET'S SHOOT FOR BIG THINGS. &gt;&gt; LET'S SHOOT FOR THE THIRD P. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; A POPE FROM AMERICA IS IN HIS PLACE. WHY ARE YOU NOT IN YOUR PLACE? SO, SO, SO GOD, SO YOUR God is only fulfilling the PROPHECIES OF THE DEVIL, &gt;&gt; a woman IN PURPLE, THE POPE IN AMERICA. IF HE'S FULFILLING FOR THE DEVIL, WHAT ABOUT MY PROPHECY, [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; CHURCH? LOOSEN UP. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE WANT US ONCE ONCE GOD SEES THAT you have produced the fruit &gt;&gt; whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, &gt;&gt; whatsoever. Whether it didn't help, whether it didn't work the first time or not, &gt;&gt; me today, I'm repeating again. WHATSOEVER &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER YOU SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; ASK OF the father. &gt;&gt; Ask who? &gt;&gt; The father. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE ASKING THE FATHER, WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; The son. &gt;&gt; ASK THE FATHER. IN WHICH NAME? &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE ASKING, &gt;&gt; LET ME LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. IF I TELL YOU &gt;&gt; go to my office tomorrow &gt;&gt; and tell the manager, &gt;&gt; tell my manager &gt;&gt; to give you this and this &gt;&gt; when you are presenting them, do you present in your name? &gt;&gt; What do you say? &gt;&gt; BROTHER STEVEN SAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY DR. SHEAMBO SAY &gt;&gt; MY MANAGER CHANGES. &gt;&gt; What did he say? Give me this. THEY JUST TAKE THEY GIVE IT TO YOU. NOT BECAUSE OF YOU. BECAUSE OF THE NAME OF DR. SH. [applause] WHATEVER YOU ASK IN MY NAME, NOT YOU. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECEIVE IT. YOU ARE COMING IN HIS NAME. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHOSE YOU &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED YOU. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, YOU CAN USE HIS NAME. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CONFIDENCE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU ASK WHATSOEVER YOU ASK THE FATHER WHY &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME &gt;&gt; I WILL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; He may give it to you. &gt;&gt; He will get HE MAY GIVE. GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHY? BECAUSE GOD CHOSE you &gt;&gt; and God ordained you. &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT CHOOSING SOME PEOPLE ARE CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; YES, THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT TO BRING FRUIT. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; WE FOUND JUDAS WAS CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CHOSEN AMONG THE 12. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A DEVIL. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF &gt;&gt; PREDITION. &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT CALL GOD HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME FROM HELL. &gt;&gt; PITION means hell. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE YOU ALL OF YOU." &gt;&gt; But one of you is what? &gt;&gt; That was in John 6. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW BY JOHN 13, JUDAH LEFT. &gt;&gt; And once Judah left, Jesus changed the language. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who staying here? There is no more child of the devil. They all gone from the message. Okay. Now I need to change the language. Now let me bring another ministry &gt;&gt; that WILL BEGIN TO UNFOLD TO THEM who they are. &gt;&gt; WHEN EVERYBODY WHEN THE PARASITES ARE GONE. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He say you I have chosen you. &gt;&gt; I ALREADY CHOSE YOU THE FIRST TIME BUT THIS TIME I'M REVEALING to you something. I chose you and I ordain YOU TO BRING FORTH FRUIT. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE FRUIT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAVE EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT ARE IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT IS THE FRUIT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST THE WORD. THE WORD OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE WHAT &gt;&gt; TEACHING. THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; I didn't write this quote. &gt;&gt; Did Brother Brandham say they're preaching? &gt;&gt; NO. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YEAH. You saying that because you a teacher? Of course. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE HUMBLE. HUMBLE. HUMBLE. Of course. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why I'M A TEACHER. BECAUSE SOMEBODY NEED TO HEAR THE TEACHING OF the season, THE TEACHING OF MALACHI 4, REVELATION 10, THE TEACHING OF THE MESSAGE. BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE FAITH CORRECTLY IF YOU ARE NOT CORRECTLY TAUGHT. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY A CHURCH CAN NEVER GO HIGHER THAN THE TEACHING, &gt;&gt; NOT THE PREACHING, THE TEACHING OF IT PASTOR. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; Of the season. THE TEACHING OF WHAT &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF TEACHING. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO SEE WHO YOUR TEACHING IS. YOUR TEACHING MUST BE ACCORDING TO MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TEACH WE SAY BROTHER SAY WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR TEACHING ARE COMING FROM. [cheering] WE NEED TO KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE TEACHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRODUCE THAT TEACHING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were chosen and you were ordained to bring forth the fruit. In other words, to bring forth the word. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here, &gt;&gt; you see the message? The message &gt;&gt; the message should not struggle with you. &gt;&gt; The living of the message for you is automatic &gt;&gt; because you were ordained for it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you a woman, &gt;&gt; do you when you are growing up, do you tell your body change to a woman? &gt;&gt; Change to a woman. Now it's time for you to see your your your sac. Remember body &gt;&gt; when you are even eating I mean whatever I mean fruit or whatever your body knows what it's doing &gt;&gt; because your body knows that this is a woman. &gt;&gt; You can become a man and your body still know that you a woman. &gt;&gt; Your body already know that you a woman. YOU WON'T CHEAT THAT BODY BECAUSE YOUR BODY WAS ORDAINED &gt;&gt; AND CHOSEN TO BE A WOMAN. YOU WERE ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO BE THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR SOUL KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THE MESSAGE. YOU DON'T WRESTLE WITH THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY AND A CERTAIN POINT YOU JUST LET GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOU LETTING YOU GO. NO, YOUR BODY IS WORKING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You were ordained and you were predestinated. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE, JUDAH NEVER MADE IT TO THE PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE NEVER MADE IT TO THE UPPER ROOM. &gt;&gt; HE DIED WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. BUT YET HE SERVED GOD &gt;&gt; TO A CERTAIN POINT. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER PEOPLE WILL SERVE GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SOME SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD WHEN THEY PLATEAU. THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; SOME DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE STILL AROUND THE MESSAGE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU GET ALONG WITH THEM, THEY DON'T PUSH. &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT MOVE. &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY PLATEAU. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN A RELIGIOUS MODE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T STRIVE TO SEE [screaming] MORE GOD IN THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. [applause] ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO, SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT, &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN TO REACH THE CLIMATE, THEY WILL NEVER REACH IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY, "HAVE WE NOW PROPHESY?" &gt;&gt; THEY WERE PROPHESYING. &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOT CAST OUT DEVIL? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CASTING OUT DEVIL. AND JESUS TURNED AND HE SAY, "I NEVER KNEW YOU." AND THE PROPHECY IS THE SECOND POOL. &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT DEVIL IS THE FIRST P &gt;&gt; BUT THE THIRD P THEY CANNOT REACH IT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO AMONG THE SERVANT OF GOD, AMONG THE DISCIPLE OF GOD, THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO ALL THE WAY AND PRODUCE FRUIT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THEY BLOCK BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A GROUP REVELATION. &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL REVELATION. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD OPEN UP, MOVE FORWARD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE ORDAINED &gt;&gt; TO PRODUCE WHAT GOD TOLD ME TO PRODUCE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable of the mana &gt;&gt; of the panda. &gt;&gt; Your prayer has been answered. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable. Let's go to Luke 19. &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a B2 bombers. So there is no way you can be high there and take your seat belt off. No, this airplane you don't take the seat belt because they flip in the air. Uhhuh. So you have to to keep and they flip. You you see them and then they keep moving. So when you flip, you don't want to drop there or without a seat belt. You stay there. You put the mask and everything because it's high pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 19, my friend. &gt;&gt; Remember before this parable, the story was about Zakius. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; The story was about Zakius. Then Jesus begin to talk to THE PEOPLE THAT WERE in the house of Zakius. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's uh verse 10. And verse 10, FOR THE SON OF MAN IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; Come to seek. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 9. So we pick up the background. And Jesus said to him, "This day is what? &gt;&gt; Salvation come to this house." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; For so much as he also is the son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; For the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. The son of man is come to seek and save that which is what &gt;&gt; lost. &gt;&gt; Verse 11, we studying the parable. AND AS THEY DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Heard these things. &gt;&gt; In other words, WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE focused &gt;&gt; to listen to what Jesus was saying &gt;&gt; and Jesus SAW THAT HE CAUGHT their attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus flip another parable &gt;&gt; because the people become more attentive. &gt;&gt; Jesus is talking. Everybody's paying attention. WHEN JESUS SAW THAT THE AUDIENCE is paying attention, Jesus brought something &gt;&gt; and loaded. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And as they heard these things, he added, you see, he's adding &gt;&gt; he added what? &gt;&gt; And spake a parable. &gt;&gt; And spake a parable because he was what? &gt;&gt; Nigh to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; He was nine to Jerusalem. And because they taught that water, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God should immediately appear. So the reason of this PARABLE IS THAT JESUS WAS GETTING CLOSER TO JERUSALEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And his way toward Jerusalem was to die. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. I told you this thing flip in the head. &gt;&gt; His way toward Jerusalem, he was going to die. &gt;&gt; As the Messiah to die at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PEOPLE EXPECTATION WAS NOT ABOUT his death. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN HE entered Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; they were waiting for him &gt;&gt; and they were crying, "HOSANA, SON OF David and everything." &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOW WAITING FOR A SON OF DAVID TO DIE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE EXPECTING THE KING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AH, &gt;&gt; THE MESSIAH THAT YOU HEAR IN THE scripture &gt;&gt; was supposed to be king. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD PULLED ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT, &gt;&gt; God pulled them to become his people. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD WAS DIRECTING ISRAEL with a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET REPRESENTED GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO THE PEOPLE. HE WAS GOD'S SPOKESMAN &gt;&gt; TO THE PEOPLE. AND THE INTENT OF GOD WAS THAT AT THE LATTER DAY, God himself will come &gt;&gt; and dwell with his PEOPLE &gt;&gt; AND BECOME THEIR KING. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BUT ISRAEL AS THEY WERE JOURNEYING &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE GOING THROUGH BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOING WITH A GENERAL UNDER THE COMMAND OF GOD. AND THEY SAW THAT ALL THE NATION WHEN THEY GO TO THE BATTLE THEY HAVE SOMEBODY WEARING A CROWN &gt;&gt; WHO'S THERE AND SAY ONWARD &gt;&gt; AND THEY LOOK EVERYBODY HAVE A KING &gt;&gt; UNTIL ISRAEL BEGIN TO ENVY &gt;&gt; THAT ORDER &gt;&gt; FORGETTING THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE &gt;&gt; WAS THE KING &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS WAITING FOR ONE DAY TO BECOME I'M A MAN. &gt;&gt; AND TO BE CROWNED AS [screaming] A KING. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY WERE SO IMPATIENT. &gt;&gt; They say, "You know what? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what? Uh, Samuel. &gt;&gt; Ah, when we see I mean we we know you know all kind of reason begin to raise up. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we want to copy the world. &gt;&gt; The king is already there. &gt;&gt; And God told Samuel, they are rejecting me &gt;&gt; because I'm there AS THE KING. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANT to match THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT OFF. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT THEY ALL THE WHOLE WORLD CELEBRATING SOMETHING &gt;&gt; and in their home they don't celebrate anything. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD. THEY WANT TO BE ALSO WHEN THEIR NEIGHBOR ASK THEM WHAT ARE YOU DOING for Christmas &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO ALSO DO something &gt;&gt; let me leave it alone &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER THEY WANT TO FIT IN THE WORD &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER &gt;&gt; THEN THEY PUSH &gt;&gt; AND GOD OPEN UP A PERMISSIVE WILL [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND GAVE THEM SOUL AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE TROUBLE OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT GOD HIMSELF &gt;&gt; WAS SUPPOSED TO COME AS THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; THE MESSIAH WAS THE KING OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN ISRAEL WENT UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE, &gt;&gt; please all this explanation is not my minute &gt;&gt; because you the one that slow down. So take that aside. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a parenthesis. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So somebody can pick up. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE ROMAN TOOK OVER ISRAEL AND THE ROMAN WAS MISTREATING ISRAEL, ISRAEL HAD A HOPE. WHEN THEY BEAT THEM, they say don't worry, &gt;&gt; the Messiah will come. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, one day the Messiah will come. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, one day the Messiah WILL COME. DON'T. SO WHEN THEY SAY THE MESSIAH HAS COME, &gt;&gt; ME AND YOU, WE ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; TO THE JEWS, IT MEANS THAT FINALLY &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE. &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO FIGHT WITH ROME. &gt;&gt; YES. HE WAS COMING TO FIGHT WITH ROME SPIRITUALLY. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE EXPECTING A PHYSICAL FIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE KINGDOM FROM ROME &gt;&gt; AND BRING ISRAEL BACK AGAIN &gt;&gt; LIKE ISRAEL USED TO BE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO NOW THE KING NOW THE KING IS TRAVELING TOWARD WASHINGTON. HE'S GOING TOWARD JERUSALEM, &gt;&gt; TOWARD THE CAPITAL, &gt;&gt; TOWARD WASHINGTON. SO EVERYBODY SAY, "PRESIDENT, NOW WE GOING TOWARD WASHINGTON DC. HE'S GOING TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO TAKE OVER. &gt;&gt; SO WE NEED TO FOLLOW HIM &gt;&gt; AND THEN &gt;&gt; AND THEN TAKE OVER [screaming] EVERYTHING." &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS GOT THAT INTENT, &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU understand me now? &gt;&gt; Jesus sayh &gt;&gt; I need to manage this expectation. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN HE'S COMING THEY SAY HOSANA SON OF DAVID KING OF DAVID WHO HAVE COME &gt;&gt; AND DO YOU KNOW PILOT ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT IT MEANS. THEY WERE SAYING THAT IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? REMEMBER THE DISCIPLE ASKED HIM, "FATHER, IS THIS AT THIS TIME THAT YOU WILL RESTORE?" &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT SCRIPTURE? &gt;&gt; Do you know that scripture? &gt;&gt; It's in THE BOOK OF ACTS, CHAPTER ONE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IS THIS AT THIS TIME THAT YOU WILL RESTORE THE KINGDOM BACK TO ISRAEL?" SO, THEY WERE ALL EXPECTING THE MESSIAH TO REMOVE ROME AND TAKE THE KINGDOM AND JESUS BECOME THE KING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS WAS GETTING CLOSER TO WASHINGTON, &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER &gt;&gt; CLOSER TO THE CAPITAL TO JERUSALEM. &gt;&gt; HE BEGIN TO SEE THE EXPECTATION OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "AH, &gt;&gt; where are you at? We going to take over. &gt;&gt; He's now heading to to DC. &gt;&gt; Get your rental car." All of us. All of us IN DC WHEN WE ENTER DC ALL OF US WE FLAG. HALLELUJAH. WE CAME TO TAKE OVER. WE CAME TO TAKE OVER. THE KING IS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN THE MAJORS COME? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ASKING FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHERE IS WHO? &gt;&gt; Where is who? &gt;&gt; THE WHO? &gt;&gt; THE KING OF WHAT? THEY WERE NOT ISRAELITE, BUT THEY KNEW THAT DUST STAR WAS POINTING TO THE KING. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THEY KNEW THAT THE ONE WHO WAS BORN WAS A KING. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS SAW THE EXPECTATION, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "These guys are going to be disappointed." Yes, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN I GET THERE AND THEY KILL ME, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE DISCIPLE &gt;&gt; ON THE ROAD OF AMAS. &gt;&gt; PLEASE, I'M STILL IN PARENTHESIS. I'M IN PARENTHESIS. I'm in parenthesis. SO, THE DISCIPLE ON THE ROAD TO AMAS, LOOK, THEY SAY &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT he was the ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED NOW THEY KILL HIM. THIS IS THREE DAYS. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you fool. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROPHET &gt;&gt; THAT KINGDOM WILL COME LATER ON. &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO DELIVER YOU SPIRITUALLY FIRST. &gt;&gt; THE DELIVERANCE START WITH THE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? WE CLEAR NOW, MY FRIEND. SO NOW JESUS SAW IT &gt;&gt; and Jesus say I need to manage this expectation. &gt;&gt; These guys are waiting for me to go there, take the throne and sit on the throne. &gt;&gt; But they're going to be disappointed because when I get there, they hold me. They begin to slap me. They say, "What type of Messiah is this one?" &gt;&gt; And and and when they crucify him, they put an inscription. &gt;&gt; What did they write there? &gt;&gt; This is what? &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? So how can a king be there crucified? &gt;&gt; It was difficult to manage. So now Jesus begin to give them this parable &gt;&gt; to tell them &gt;&gt; THE ORDER OF HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; My friend &gt;&gt; everything was in parentheses. &gt;&gt; Uh because I was told don't say can I continue can I continue because it will create a problem. I was told that so I don't want to say that are we together but you need to understand the parthesis is also taking time so you understand better we are cooperating it's a cooperation between the pastor and the church are we cooperating well it's a deal it's a win-win deal or you don't win I have to win also it's a win-win deal are we together &gt;&gt; we TOGETHER IN THE BACK AH, we the deal is okay, sister Naomi. The deal is good. You signed the paper. You heard that? We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO THIS PARABLE is brought to correct &gt;&gt; to manage &gt;&gt; to recalibrate &gt;&gt; TO REALIGN THE EXPECTATION THAT NO I'M NOT GOING TO BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE KINGDOM TO appear immediately &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID HEY NO NO NO LET ME GIVE you the ORDER &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHEN WILL I BE KING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I am king &gt;&gt; but not the WAY YOU THINKING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAY MY KINGDOM parenthesis &gt;&gt; is not of this world. &gt;&gt; If he was of this world my subject would have fight for me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO JESUS IS TELLING THEM NO NO NO not the WAY YOU THINK. THERE WILL BE A TIME THAT I WILL COME &gt;&gt; and be a king truly &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME. &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN ORDER. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE I BECOME KING. &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHAT YOU EXPECTING ME NOW HAPPEN, THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS SEASON &gt;&gt; IN THE PARABLE OF THE TEMPAM. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE FINISHED THE PARENTHESES. You can see how many minutes they took uh brother Robert we together. &gt;&gt; Now let's go to the parable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; VERSE 11. AND AS THEY HEARD THESE THINGS these things are difficult to go quick quick quick. That's why people in the message they listen to the sermon they don't listen. They don't hear anything. They don't because nobody sat there to expound. &gt;&gt; AS A PASTOR I need to expound. Even if it take 20 sermon, LET ME EXPOUND SO THAT THE THE THE THE RAM with horn &gt;&gt; and the LAMB AND THE LITTLE LAMB WILL UNDERSTAND &gt;&gt; A PASTOR FEED EVERYBODY &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THE ADULT EVEN THE LITTLE LAMB. &gt;&gt; SO GIVE ME MY TIME TO EXPOUND &gt;&gt; SO THAT BROTHER ELIJAH WILL LEAVE HERE AND KNOW CLEARLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT &gt;&gt; SO THAT BROTHER LEAH KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Okay. Verse 11. And as they heard these things, he added and did what? &gt;&gt; Spake a parable. &gt;&gt; Because he was near what? &gt;&gt; To Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT, NOW YOU BEGIN to understand. &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD SHOULD APPEAR HOW? &gt;&gt; IMMEDIATELY. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE the they're thinking. So as soon as we reach Washington DC, &gt;&gt; we declare &gt;&gt; the new president &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ on CNN. Let's go on NBC. Everybody, let's go over there. We've gone over there. Okay. Okay. Okay. You move up. Move up. Put the camera. The new president. &gt;&gt; We taking over. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Hey, I need to manage this expectation &gt;&gt; before I get there." And I see people attacking the Roman. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And he said, "THEREFORE, A CERTAIN WHAT? &gt;&gt; NOBLE MAN. THAT WORD nobleman means a man of a noble birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In another translation &gt;&gt; can I erase this &gt;&gt; because this is very important my friend. &gt;&gt; A man of water, &gt;&gt; a man, a noble man. If you look at another translation, it says of a noble birth. &gt;&gt; His birth is noble. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's a special birth. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man of a certain noble man WENT INTO A WATER, &gt;&gt; a far country. &gt;&gt; You remember what far country means? &gt;&gt; We already went through this. &gt;&gt; Far country means water. &gt;&gt; Remember the parable of the talent. I gave you the quote. Far country was heaven. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say far country means heaven. When the people that came to visit Abraham, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said they were coming from a far country which was heaven. &gt;&gt; So far country means what? &gt;&gt; HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS NOBLE BIRTH MAN, this noble man was going into heaven. &gt;&gt; Into a far country. &gt;&gt; Go see three weeks you will see the quote I gave you. &gt;&gt; To a kafar country which means what? &gt;&gt; SO JESUS IS TALKING TO THEM. HE'S RECALIBRATING them &gt;&gt; that hey there was a noble there was a certain man &gt;&gt; if you look he's now putting his name &gt;&gt; because the ministry of the son of man have a tendency to remove the name &gt;&gt; and to act like you are speaking about somebody else &gt;&gt; yeah there will come a man &gt;&gt; who will restore &gt;&gt; I'm only laying the platform for him &gt;&gt; he will come AND LEAD THE BROTHER &gt;&gt; AND THEN PREACHER ARE COMING I'M THE REPLACEMENT I'M THE REPLACEMENT I'M THE THE REPLACEMENT OF WHO? &gt;&gt; THE REPLACEMENT OF WHO? &gt;&gt; THAT MAN WAS HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO KNOW THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; HE WILL TELL YOU THE SON OF MAN WHO IS IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; AND YET THE SON OF MAN IS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME. I'M I'M ONLY UH MAYBE FORESHADOW foreshadowing who since he's dead. Who do you see? &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SEE? &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SEE DOING THE SIGN in the back? &gt;&gt; Who do you see? &gt;&gt; So who else do you expect? &gt;&gt; Are you wasting your time? Okay. A certain MAN WAS GOING TO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; No preacher &gt;&gt; will replace brother. &gt;&gt; There is only one brother. &gt;&gt; Only seven star. There was not eight &gt;&gt; seven &gt;&gt; after seven. No more. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW POWERFUL GOD USE YOU. [cheering] &gt;&gt; No more. &gt;&gt; Even if you take this puppet, you flip it. No more. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; I I can piss with something here but it will hurt hard but let me leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Even the desertment in public &gt;&gt; cannot be tempered with. &gt;&gt; I have the quote. &gt;&gt; It's only for one. &gt;&gt; It's only for one. &gt;&gt; I will get to that one day. &gt;&gt; You cannot sit here and begin you there. You there. You there. Yes. God will give you a discernment but not to that caliber. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have quote I'm loaded. I am loaded. I am loaded. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I know when I'm saying this maybe I hit somewhere. Yes. But I don't have any choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, we got to put everything back in order. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when this sign happened they they are signal &gt;&gt; THEY TELL US THAT THAT MAN IS A MAN to follow. So when you doing that what do you say? &gt;&gt; We need to follow who again &gt;&gt; you [screaming] &gt;&gt; we following the message. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Another parenthesis. Let's go my friend. &gt;&gt; HE SAY CERTAIN NOBLE MAN WENT INTO A far country to receive for himself what? &gt;&gt; A kingdom &gt;&gt; and do what? &gt;&gt; Return. SO HE WAS GOING IN heaven to receive a kingdom &gt;&gt; and then to do what? &gt;&gt; RETURN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE LEVEL HE WAS HE DIDN'T HE WAS NOT IN THE LEVEL THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME DOWN AS A LAMB. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NOT A lion yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS GOING TO HEAVEN TO RECEIVE A KINGDOM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, TO BE CROWNED &gt;&gt; AS A KING &gt;&gt; AND COME BACK. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING TO HEAVEN &gt;&gt; TO CHANGE. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET TO HEAVEN, HE'S GOING TO CHANGE. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE'S GOING TO HEAVEN, HE WON'T BE A LAMB. BUT WHEN HE GET TO HEAVEN, HE WILL CHANGE AND BECOME A LION. SO WHEN HE'S COMING BACK, HE'S RETURNING WITH A LION KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU THIS AIRPLANE FLIPS. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He was a king, BUT HE WAS NEVER RECOGNIZED as a king. &gt;&gt; He was only walking with disciple. &gt;&gt; A king don't walk with small people like that. &gt;&gt; Are we together? BUT WHEN HE'S COMING BACK IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION 19, &gt;&gt; HE'S KING OF KINGS. &gt;&gt; HE'S LORD OF LORD. &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING WITH A SWORD &gt;&gt; ON A WHITE HORSE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE KING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS IS TELLING THEM, I'M GOING TO LEAVE. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GO TO HEAVEN &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO IMORPH OVER THERE. WHEN I IMMOR &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAY, "BEHOLD THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH." &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN I COME BACK, I WILL COME BACK AS A KING. &gt;&gt; SO HIS RETURN IS A RETURN OF A KING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE HAVE I LOST SOMEBODY? &gt;&gt; BEEN WE OKAY? &gt;&gt; OKAY, let's go, my friend. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Verse 12. &gt;&gt; VERSE 12. HE SAYS, "THEREFORE, A CERTAIN NOBLE MAN WENT INTO A far country to receive for himself water, &gt;&gt; the kingdom &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; to return." &gt;&gt; So he was going to return. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's telling the Jews, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take kingdom. Now &gt;&gt; I still have to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; WHEN I WILL COME BACK FROM HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; this is when I'm going to be king. &gt;&gt; The way you are operating, the way you are expecting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS A PERIOD OF time &gt;&gt; between the going away, &gt;&gt; the going away of this noble man &gt;&gt; OR THE DEPARTURE &gt;&gt; OF THIS NOBLE man until his return. THERE IS A SEASON RIGHT HERE [music] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE NOBLEMAN WILL BE ABSENT &gt;&gt; ABSENT PHYSICALLY &gt;&gt; A LITTLE MORE AND THE WORLD WILL SEE ME NO MORE. &gt;&gt; PLEASE, it's quiet over here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? A LITTLE WHILE AND THE WORLD WILL SEE ME NO MORE BUT YOU WILL SEE ME &gt;&gt; AND I BECAUSE I WILL BE where &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord help me. &gt;&gt; Where are we at my friend? &gt;&gt; Verse 13. &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED WHAT? &gt;&gt; His 10 servants. &gt;&gt; He called how many servants? &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; How many servant? &gt;&gt; 10. My friend, let's do better so we can finish this &gt;&gt; because if not we will cut this short. &gt;&gt; How many servant? &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; 10 servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He called 10 servant AND DELIVER UNTO them what? &gt;&gt; 10 pound. &gt;&gt; 10 pound and say to them do what? &gt;&gt; OCCUPY TILL I. SO BEFORE HE leaves &gt;&gt; to go TO HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; HE WOULD TAKE £10. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So £10 &gt;&gt; is his fullness now. &gt;&gt; This is all he has right now. &gt;&gt; All he pull up &gt;&gt; is£10. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And he's going to deliver£10 &gt;&gt; before he leaves. &gt;&gt; AND ONCE THE£10 ARE DELIVERED, &gt;&gt; he leaves &gt;&gt; toward the far country. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS IS GOING TO HEAVEN, he's leaving something. &gt;&gt; AND HOW MANY POUND IS HE LIVING? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SERVANT IS HE LIVING? SO EVERY SERVANT HAVE HOW MANY POUND? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When he GAVE THE 10, HE SAYS DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; OCCUPY. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GET TO BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO THE SERVANT HAD TO ENTER THE BUSINESS OF THE NOBLE MEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS NOT ANY KIND OF BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; THE BUSINESS OF THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; HE LEFT THE BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK HIS BUSINESS &gt;&gt; AND GAVE IT TO 10 PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AND THE 10 PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTINUE &gt;&gt; HIS BUSINESS WHEN HE'S AWAY. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THIS 10 HERE WHEN WE SPEAK £10 IN AMERICAN ENGLISH IT'S A PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S£10 OF CHICKEN. &gt;&gt; OH, IT'S£10 of milk &gt;&gt; or gallon OR WHATEVER POUND OR 10 POUND OF RICE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THAT'S NOT THE POUND THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF. &gt;&gt; THIS POUND IS MONEY. You start again. &gt;&gt; Some of you are I already gave you so many quote but you still some of you are still struggle. Let's see jump to verse 20. So we clear that. &gt;&gt; And another came saying, "What? &gt;&gt; Behold, &gt;&gt; behold, here is what &gt;&gt; thy pound &gt;&gt; which I have water &gt;&gt; kept laid up in the napkin. &gt;&gt; For I fear you because you are a water, &gt;&gt; an austere man. &gt;&gt; And you didn't and you take up that you have water &gt;&gt; lay not down &gt;&gt; reap that you did not water." &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; he was showing the master a pound, &gt;&gt; his pound, right? Because he was only one pound given to everybody. &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And he says to him, "Out of your mouth will I judge you, you who &gt;&gt; wicked servant. &gt;&gt; You knew that I was a what? &gt;&gt; Austere man, &gt;&gt; a severe man, a strict man, taking up and laid h that I laid not and doing what? &gt;&gt; Reaping that I did not." &gt;&gt; Wherefore then gave not you my pound? &gt;&gt; My money. &gt;&gt; My what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; So pound is what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; Pound means what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; We clear now? &gt;&gt; So this 10 pound means 10. He He took money and gave it to somebody. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What is money? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY THEN HE HAD A LITTLE SCRIPT BAG. TALKING ABOUT DAVID. &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE SCRIPT bag really in what? &gt;&gt; ONE POCKET. &gt;&gt; IN ONE POCKET of it CARRIES WATER, &gt;&gt; MONEY. THE WORD SCRIPT means what? &gt;&gt; MONEY. &gt;&gt; SO HE CARRIES WHAT? &gt;&gt; Money in there. &gt;&gt; Money in there. WHAT IS THAT? THE MONEY IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; A purchase of power. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; MONEY IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; A PURCHASE OF POWER. &gt;&gt; SO THIS MONEY IS A purchase &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; A PURCHASE POWER. IN OTHER WORD, MONEY HAVE THE POWER &gt;&gt; TO PURCHASE SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MONEY MAY BECOME ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; DEPENDING ON THE DESIRE &gt;&gt; OF the one who hold &gt;&gt; MONEY MAY BECOME A BOTTLE. &gt;&gt; If I need water, &gt;&gt; IT MAY BECOME a tie. If I need a tie, &gt;&gt; IT CAN BECOME A SHIRT. &gt;&gt; IT CAN BECOME A PULPIT. &gt;&gt; DEPEND DEPENDING ON THE DESIRE OF THE ONE WHO HOLD IT. &gt;&gt; MONEY GIVE YOU POWER TO SUCK SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; MONEY GIVE YOU POWER TO PULL SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; MONEY GIVE YOU POWER [screaming] TO GET SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE DESIRING SOMETHING &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CANNOT GET IT. BUT IF YOU CAN GET MONEY, &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THAT IS EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. &gt;&gt; THEN WHATEVER YOU LOOK FOR IS ALREADY YOURS. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Please shake somebody. &gt;&gt; Ah this parable is is a different story my friend. Shake somebody and let's get focused my friend. &gt;&gt; If I look at the watch I will stop. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, let's let's let's stay alert. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I may I I want this bottle of water, &gt;&gt; but I don't have man. It's not mine. &gt;&gt; I already have the intent and the desire to have it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I can desire all I want. It's not mine. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT IF I EVER GET MONEY &gt;&gt; on my hand, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I change my attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together &gt;&gt; now? I ALREADY HAVE THE BOTTLE OF WATER. &gt;&gt; IN POTENTIALLY &gt;&gt; I ALREADY HAVE THE BOTTLE OF WATER. &gt;&gt; ALL I NEED TO DO IS GO TO THE STORE, &gt;&gt; give the money, AND GET MY BOTTLE. &gt;&gt; SO MONEY CAN BECOME A BOTTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS FIRST A BOTTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. POTENTIALLY AND IT WILL BECOME A BORDER TANGIBLY. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you stay alert, some of you will get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRADAM say money is the purchase water. &gt;&gt; HERE IS GOD'S SCRIPT BAG. Each traveler or shepherd out there has a what &gt;&gt; script bag. &gt;&gt; SO NOW IF YOU WANT SOMETHING OUT THERE &gt;&gt; SOME WHAT &gt;&gt; PURCHASING POWER. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE WHAT &gt;&gt; SICK &gt;&gt; reach down here AND LET'S SEE WHAT GOT WHAT I GOT IN THE WATER &gt;&gt; SCRIPT BAG. &gt;&gt; You are sick. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GO TO the script bag &gt;&gt; because the script bag contain money. &gt;&gt; In other words go in the bag. and go get money. What is money? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY I AM THE LORD &gt;&gt; THAT DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; HEALTH. &gt;&gt; OH, &gt;&gt; SO I AM THE LORD THAT HEAL YOU. &gt;&gt; BECOME A PURCHASE POWER. &gt;&gt; BUT I AM THE LORD THAT HEALETH you &gt;&gt; is a promise &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; If not, we need to go home. I don't like to deliver a material like this. &gt;&gt; It's the devil playing with you. &gt;&gt; Do you want to receive it? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Do you want to receive it? &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY, I AM THE LORD THAT HEALTH THEE. &gt;&gt; I AM THE LORD THAT HEALTH THEE. Is a word. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a scripture &gt;&gt; in the Bible &gt;&gt; and it's a scriptural promise. PLEASE UH FORGET WHAT YOU'RE DOING. PUT EVERYTHING ASIDE. Leave it. &gt;&gt; Focus right here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD. IT'S A SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A SCRIPTURAL PROMISE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And this promise is equivalent to sickness. [cheering] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. WHEN SICKNESS HIT YOU, &gt;&gt; GOD BRING YOU MONEY &gt;&gt; AND THE MONEY SAY I AM THE LORD. That's it. IF YOU PULL THAT MONEY &gt;&gt; AND YOU APPLY IT, &gt;&gt; YOU CHANGE IT TO HEALING. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, MONEY &gt;&gt; IS THE REVEALED SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; IN THE TIME OF NEED. [cheering] [applause] FATHER, help your church. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; MONEY &gt;&gt; IS THE REVEALED SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE REVEAL SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; IN THE TIME &gt;&gt; OF NEED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T TELL YOU, I'M THE LORD THAT FIGHT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING WITH A SPECIFIC AMOUNT. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS my friend &gt;&gt; if you stay focused God will BLESS YOU. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY ALL RIGHT AND WHAT DO YOU DO? &gt;&gt; TAKE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A POWER THAT DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER YOU BELIEVE WHEN YOU PRAY. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THAT YOU WHAT? &gt;&gt; Receive what you ask for. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; DESIRE IT. &gt;&gt; PRAY AND believe you did what?

YOU WILL HEAR A SCRIPTURE COMING UP &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "DO NOT FEAR. I AM WITH YOU. I WILL NEVER LOSE YOU. I WILL BE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE END. GOD IS GIVING YOU MONEY.

Perhaps a what? &gt;&gt; A loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; IF I WAS STARVING AND A LOAF OF BREAD will save my life &gt;&gt; and I will ask for what? &gt;&gt; The bread. &gt;&gt; And some man will give me what? &gt;&gt; 25 cents. AND THAT IS THE PURCHASE POWER OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; A loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; I CAN BE JUST AS WHAT? &gt;&gt; Happy &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; Holding the 25 cents &gt;&gt; which is money IN MY HAND AS I CAN IF I HAVE WHAT &gt;&gt; with the loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER SAY WHENEVER YOU GET THE LOAF THE 25 CENTS YOUR ATTITUDE MUST CHANGE. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, I CAN BE SAD BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MONEY. BUT WHEN MONEY COMES, &gt;&gt; I MUST NOT BE SAD WITH MONEY. WHEN MONEY COMES, &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow they're coming to repossess your car. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And the dealer say by 10:00 &gt;&gt; if I don't receive $1,500 I'm pulling the car out. &gt;&gt; And here you are all day going up like this. &gt;&gt; And suddenly you reach brother Lammon &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER LAMMON COME and say, "Brother, the Lord put in my heart &gt;&gt; to give you $1,500." &gt;&gt; WHEN THE $1,500 HIT YOUR HAND, &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? &gt;&gt; DID YOU SEE THE DEALER?

BUT IN YOUR HOME, IT'S ALREADY A JUBILEE [cheering] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF. [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We got to stop this parable, my friend. &gt;&gt; We got to stop it somewhere. ARE WE TOGETHER? AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHEN I GET THE PRICE OF A LOAF OF BREAD, I CAN JUST BE AS WHAT? HAPPY &gt;&gt; DOING WATER. &gt;&gt; Holding the 25 cents IN MY HAND &gt;&gt; AS I CAN. IF I HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE LOAF OF BREAD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE PURCHASING POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEN I DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; THEN I'VE GOT IT. &gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT GOT THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; BUT I GOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE PURCHASING POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT IS &gt;&gt; FAITH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT FAITH. &gt;&gt; SO MONEY REPRESENT WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; THE FAITH.

I'm going to go straight to the airport because we are just at the beginning of this. &gt;&gt; We have not got into this yet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So money represent what?

[applause and cheering] We will know WHO IS THE WICKED. &gt;&gt; THE WICKED ARE THOSE THAT CAN USE FAITH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY YOU CAN JUST BE AS HAPPY IF WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE CANCER is gone. &gt;&gt; What do you do? &gt;&gt; SHOUT JUST AS LOUD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE PURCHASE POWER. &gt;&gt; THE FAITH THAT DOES [screaming] WHAT?

Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish this. &gt;&gt; We stop here. We need to pick up from here &gt;&gt; and enter into this parable &gt;&gt; throughout the week. Continue to pray. &gt;&gt; I know what was coming after this. [applause] &gt;&gt; I know somebody would have been fear. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because I know what is coming up after this. We got so confused about what is faith &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says HE SAYS WHY THE FAITH THAT MOVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; THEN YOU ARE HOW? &gt;&gt; PERSEVERANCE. &gt;&gt; WHY YOU ARE PERSEVERANT? &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BECOME PERSEVERANT. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOU GOT IT. THIS BOTTLE OF WATER &gt;&gt; is a Walmart. &gt;&gt; Walmart is not here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I got the money, &gt;&gt; I may walk toward Walmart. &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE COLD, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S no problem. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A MATTER OF time &gt;&gt; until I get to Walmart. &gt;&gt; WHEN I GET TO WALMART, IT'S A HISTORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT SOO YOUR PSYCHE. &gt;&gt; IT SOO YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY AND THE PEACE OF GOD &gt;&gt; WHICH PASSIVE ORDER.
