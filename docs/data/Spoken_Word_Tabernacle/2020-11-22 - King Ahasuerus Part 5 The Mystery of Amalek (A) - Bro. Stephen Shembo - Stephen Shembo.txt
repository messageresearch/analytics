amen y'all might be seated i'm gonna ask sister jerusha to come up she has a song on her heart this morning and that's wonderful god bless you family i am ask that you pray for me i'm always nervous coming up here but this song is like a testimony from the word we've been hearing lately and actually these last few months just growing us spiritually and bringing us to a place to come up higher so i pray it's a blessing to you i always knew lord your word was true but i thought it spoke of things you did and things you would do i didn't realize that written in the lines was my life wrapped up in yours you wrote of me and all my life where i was found and what you do through me what's written in the pages of [Music] now i see lord just where i stand the mystery of my life in christ your great plan now that little book means so much more for i foreign [Music] [Music] of [Music] where i was found was written in the pages of your world [Music] i surrender all you [Music] shine on this grain until the beauty of christ [Music] is so let us lay down you are the divine author let the shark drop away and let your light shine [Music] is [Music] it was all written in the pages [Music] [Applause] glory you know he said he'll unfold his word to us throughout eternity and reveal himself so it's no wonder that he would send a prophet in our age just to give us a little bit a minute because that's all it is and i mean because we're still in time couldn't be much but it was enough isn't it just to draw us in lily come on up and sing anyways come on you can sing you don't sing enough i'll hear about this later but she's she's got such a wonderful voice and you know you will hear about this later i sing this a lot but it really is one of my favorite songs i used to sing it in school when i was in my choir and it really was my favorite and zaddy's been bugging me to sing this with me but i don't sing here i don't see her here today so maybe next time she can sing this with me so if you know the song please sing it because i need some help i'm a little under the weather how deep the father's love for us how vast beyond all measure that he should give his only son to make a wretch his treasure how great the pain of searing lost the father turns his face away [Music] as wounds which mar the chosen one bring many sons to glory behold the man upon a cross my sin upon his shoulders ashamed i hear my mocking voice call out among the scarfers it was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished his dying breath has brought me life i know that it is finished i will not boast in [Music] anything no gifts no power no wisdom [Music] but i will boast in jesus christ his death and resurrection why should i gain from his reward i cannot give an answer but this i know with all my heart [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] uh [Music] i've been trying to get her to sing uh uh take me to the king there again by tamela man oh my gosh and by the way that lady can really belt a song out too can't she my goodness i've been listening to those songs all week let's invite our pastor up this morning and let's sing only believe in a see my nose run and everything else [Music] believe all things are possible only believe [Music] believe that all three [Music] i believe oh i believe and i believe all things are possible one more time [Music] [Music] he [Music] [Music] if mom [Music] [Music] [Applause] the name of the lord yes that sounds like it amen if it works you let me know so i'm gonna be free amen we just want to remind you lord's willing we're not going to have a service this wednesday here this coming week only only this coming week our service instead of being on wednesday we're going to have a service on tuesday so the mother the sister can be free to cook whatever they need to cook for thanksgiving so our service 7 30 on tuesday here that will be our thanksgiving service amen so if you're looking forward for a message for thanksgiving it seems like i caught it already come on tuesday you're gonna get it amen praise the name of the lord the meeting our house meeting when we have question and answer is going to be on the first week of december on the saturday always on saturday so if you have question already you can start writing them down and hand them to the deacon so we can keep those answers once we meet together we go through them before we let anybody ask a question so young people it's really for you you got any question go ahead and put it down send it to the deacon send it to the trustee whoever you want to send it to and we're going to go ahead and answer them you keep praying for the hotel employee many of the time people are coming in this church giving the offering and leave this morning an employee came and gave an offering and left so something is going on here that is affecting those people so remember them in prayer amen so remember them in prayer just in case if there is a child of god there which we believe god will bring them home amen we are longing for so i believe i got everything on my list here the devil fought me at home fought my home and all kinds of stuff but we're here by the grace of god if you would let's go to exodus chapter 17. i used to pray differently before now i pray differently when i talk to god i say i am in the line of duty so we are on the line of duty amen praise the name of the lord exodus 17. we went this last week and we are continuing hallelujah then came amalek verse eight and fought with israel in referendum everybody knows this now and moses said to joshua choose us out man and go out fight with amalek you might be seated everybody know what an amalekite is right how many read matthew 25 you read them you got all your people right praise the name of the lord so you save yourself time tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the road of god i thought it was the road of moses in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and er went up to the top of the hill so the battle of amalek the first time it happened it depended on what was going on on the hill amen so the situation on the hill was determining the outcome of the battle if the hill is not going good over there you're going to be whipped so when you fight amalek you must make sure the hillside over there whoever have the hands like this his hand must stay like that amen if you see that person's hand going this way then you're in trouble amen but in which a time when the hand of moses got tired so god used two nails he used a nail called arona and he used a nail called earth and aaron and earl fastened the hand of moses on the hill amen so the two now kept the hand of moses and as long as the hand of moses is up the battle with amalek is won amen praise the name of the lord [Music] let me jump down to verse 13 and joshua disconfited amalek and his people with the age of the sword so on the hill someone was like this after somebody was like this then the battle that started after that man amen verse 14 and the lord said to moses write this for a memorial in a book amen there were many battle between israel and amalek but the only battle that was written in the bible in the book was only the battle of joshua but the battle of joshua had to be as a millionaire you must preach like joshua you must preach like joshua was not written in the bible among all of them they only wrote paul amen okay write this foreign from under heaven joshua was the one to replace moses and moses at this point at this type he is the one on the hill with the two hand up so the ministry that followed a man on the hill with two hands up was the ministry of joshua in other words the anointing the lion anointing that was on moses was reversed or poured down unto joshua we're gonna get there and moses built an altar and called this name of jehovah nasee which is the lord is our banner so this border birth the name of god out or reveal or unfold the name of god one of the redemptive names there were seven of them one of them was birthed because of the battle with amalek he opened up a unveiled revelation which is a banner amen but what is his banner to us amen verse 16 for he says because the lord has sown that the lord not israel will have war with amalek from generation to generation so we see right here that god not israel will have war with amalek from generation to generation because the war will be from generation to generation the first one must be written and placed in the book as a reference to what god did because he's the same yesterday today and forever if he would malek the first time throughout the edges god will continue to whoop amalek amen let's go to number 24 amen hallelujah number 24 verse 16. this is balaam prophesying he has said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance that's balaam but having his eyes open that's a prophet the two subconscious are linked together that's why his eyes are open yet he can see vision amen verse 17 i shall see him this hymn is somebody but not now bellamy is looking into vision in the future and he saw someone amen i shall behold him but not near in other words he's not coming now but i can see the messiah over there he saw the messiah amen there shall come a star out of jacob so berlin saw jesus but he's just explaining that i see him he's going to come but not now not in my days amen and except we already talked about the scepter with judah a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smart the corner or the forehead of moab we spoke about it when roof have to depart from the land of moab and destroy all the children of shed verse 18 and edom shall be a possession how many knows who you know that or you want to see it in the bible we know praise the name of the lord for those who want to see it genesis 36 verse 1 and verse 8. you're gonna see clearly edom esau was called edom genesis 36 verse one and verse eight clear and edom eso shall be a possession seer also shall be a possession for his enemy and israel shall do violently so we found out that there is a star that is going to come out of israel but it seems like this star will fight against israel this messiah this star which we know is jesus will be fighting with esau why is jesus fighting with esau amen verse 19 out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion that's the messiah and shall destroy him that remains of the city verse 20. and when he looked on amalek this is belem under the anointing when he fell under the anointing he saw the messiah when he began to look at the messiah he said wait a minute the messiah would destroy esau now when balaam under the anointing begin to move his eyes fell on amalek amen and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and say amalek was the first of the nations even the first one to fight israel out of egypt amen so amalek is a nation but these his rather end shall be that he perished forever in other words when berlin saw amalek he saw that the first of the nation would be amalek but later on amalek will be wiped completely amen because god spoke already that i will blood out i will erase the remembrance of amalek and the prophecy of belem is coming and lining up with that that god will destroy amalek so the messiah will have war with israel and war with amalek amen verse 21 and he look on the key night who are these people the key knight he looks on the key night and took up his parable and said strong is your dwelling place the key night are strong amen strong is your dwelling place their darling place where they sit strong and you put your nest in a rock the kinite have a rest in the rock you know what a rock is so they're not too bad amen nevertheless the kingdom shall be wasted until ashure babylon shall carry you away captive so they're going to be carried by babylon so we see here that this star will fight iso the star will destroy amalek but they also remember us that there is a nation also called the kenite it is a strong nation and it's blocked it is seated it is resting on the rock on the world amen let's go to roman chapter 15 then we will pray since you already done your reading that was sent to you we're not going to read matthew 25 but what i highlighted there is a shepherd as a shepherd separating the sheep from the goat and he told those on the right side when i was sick you did this when i was hungry you gave me this this this and he said and they say when did you do that unto us did we do that to you he said when you did it to the list amen so when somebody treats you they are treating jesus amen those people never saw jesus in flesh that's the reason why they ask when did we see you and we did this and jesus explained to them that no when you do something to me it means you are doing something through my people amen let's go to romans 15 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen when we then that are strong or to bear the infirmity of the weak some are strong some are weak but the strong one support the weak why do you need to support the weak you're going to see it and not to please ourselves let every one of us please his neighbor for his good or to edification in other words we are building up together but we are not destroying one another amen but we are here to back up one another to build up together amen if you see somebody with a weakness it's not a place to kill him it's for you to cover himself up and then to back him and pull him up amen because the kingdom of god have strong people and weak people the church have strong people and weak people if you are strong don't be arrogant [Applause] for even christ please not himself but as it's written the reproaches of them that reproaches you fell on me jump to verse five now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one-to-one another according to christ jesus that you may be with one mind and one month together as a family glorifying glorified god even the father of our lord jesus christ amen if you would turn to esther chapter 3 and we're going to pray hallelujah keep your bible because we got to deal with amalek everybody in esther chapter 3 let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord you are giving us another opportunity again to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord we know that these days will be lord a souvenir a memorial one day because we know what is going on around the world we are not the children of darkness we are the children of the light and you send us the evening light that have enlightened the path for us lord and we know the plight and everything the enemy is trying to do around your children father but you spoke in your word that we shall not be left comfortless lord father you will be with us and you gonna gather us all the way to the end lord we are committing this service unto the hand asking you that you move me completely out of the way may you drop down father this morning and speak to your children may the devil be completely sealed out and may only the holy spirit and your angel be sailed in this building father we committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all good to see the entire family this morning we are dealing with king ahazaris three fists and esther two banquets we are on part five last sunday we were dealing with esther chapter three we already finished esther chapter one we finished chapter two we are now dealing with the third chapter of esther chapter three and when we read esther chapter three we found out that there was a man by the name of heaven which we already described to you that he was lucifer but another about him and was called in the scripture a naga guide and we were trying to detect what does he mean with an aggregate and a man had a problem with a man called mordecai and if you look naturally you might think that it's a personal problem between a man and mordechai but if you dig spiritually you're gonna find out that the problem is not about airmen and mordecai but the problem is about the religion the faith of mordecai versus what amen want him and want the entire world to buy down him and want everybody to worship him amen want everybody to recognize his supremacy but there is a man in that age who is called mordecai and the bible described to us that mordecai was a jew which we all know that a jew speak about a genuine christian and the faith of modical or the religion of modica was the cause that was resisting actually emman so it was not mordecai firing a man he was the faith of modica fighting or resisting ammon amen they were not wrestling with flesh and blood but it was the spirit that was in a mordekai have something to do with the spirit that was with heaven everybody cleared so far now when we look at the man egg at the name agar we went into the bible in first samuel chapter 15. in first samuel chapter 15 we found out that there was a man by the name of saul and saul was sent by the prophet samuel to go and to destroy the amalekite let's go to first samuel chapter 15 i told you esther but i believe i covered it first samuel chapter 15 if you dare you can say amen verse 2 that says the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel we already seen what amalek did how he laid wait for him in the way he's a man that is waiting for you in the way when you are in the way when you are in the path of duty when you are in the true way of god just be watchful amalek is somewhere amen when he came up from egypt now go and smite amalek and elderly destroy everything oh we already spoke about this in other words when you kill a malek don't even touch the things that belong to amalek not only do you destroy amalek but destroy also that which belong to amalek whether it's good or bad kill it [Music] all that they have and spare them not but slave both men and women infant eventually the children he's going to grow up and be an amalekite and circling ox and sheep camel and us and so saul gather the people together and number them in tell him two hundred thousand foot men and ten thousand men of judah and so came to the city to a city of amalek and laid weight in the valley we're going to go back again to that valley now watch closely and i want you to buckle up here amen verse six and so brother robert saw it praise god if you don't have your bible i want you to read your bible make sure you look in your scripture amen whether it's on your ipad i whatever i just make sure you watch it amen 6 and so say to the king knight everybody understand now we okay now you see this right here so say to the keynote go deport get you down from among the amalekite so the amalekites were mixed together with the king knight are we okay together so when you wanna kill an amalek he's not somebody that is truly separated he's somebody that knows how to camouflage amen because remember the dwelling of the king art are what strong and that cannot dwell in the rock so amalek get between them and sat there are we okay are we okay okay let's continue and so say to the canad go deport get you down from among the americans lest that destroy you with them for you sure what you see that matthew 25 okay somebody got it hallelujah that makes sense for you sure what kindness to all the children of what so when the children of israel were in prison they cannot come to see them amen when the children of israel were hungry the canaan came to feed them when the children of israel were tested they cannot come and feed them and because of being good to their brethren matthew 25 remember the reading i gave you in other words when you are dealing with amalek so got into the valley but in the valley he found out that they are sheep and growth remember are you there the sheep are the canine and the gods are the amalekite are you there and we saw in matthew 25 that the shepherd is separating the sheep from the goat the sheep were good to the brethren but they got were bad to the brethren and we found that mixture now that the amalekites are dealing with the keynote we okay now for you show kindness to all the children of israel when they came out of what egypt so the k night the kenite departed from among the amalekites they have to do a separation i'm going to bring judgment but since you are good to the brethren i want you to move away so i can destroy the wicked one everybody there praise the name of the lord in exodus chapter 17 verse 14 the bible says that our orderly put out the remembrance of amalek from monday what in other words i'm gonna use the name of amalek amen but when i'm trying to erase the name of amalek around the america they are key night kinaad are good to the brother the name are in the book of life that's why they must take them out save them and destroy those that the name need to be erased from the book of life are we clear we went through the book of life and we understand that amen brother branham says this in the exposition of the seven church ages he said but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment the kingdom they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what ground do they enter into eternal life certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bread they are not the bread they are just good to the bread amen but they receive it because they were what kind to the brethren that's why they are spared they are not his brethren they are kinite amen that would make them joint hair with christ with jesus they are not heirs to anything but what do they are just trying to spare them from judgment they share no throne they are not the bread etc with him their name must have been in the book of life and not now because of the love of the people of god they are recognized and you see why the old testament is written in symbols amen those people were doing things they didn't even know why they were doing it but since the opening of the sale the entire bible has been revealed amen no doubt they served and helped the children of what that's what the keynote did perhaps like who and who they stood for the children in the time of what when israel was coming out of egypt in trouble the keynote came to help them but the new king knight here brother branham is calling them nicodemus and the second keynote brother brother is calling him who remember the keynote are strong they dwell in the rock they are not pagan like you think but if you look in the mixture you're going to see an amalekite [Applause] keep first samuel chapter 15 go to john chapter 3 keep first samuel chapter 15. keep your finger there hallelujah when you look at the scriptures superficially you're going to come back with a superficial understanding amen if you're there you can say amen john chapter 3 verse 1. the two key knight are who nicodemus and who but they cannot their dwelling are strong and they dwell in the rock let's see if gamaliel or nicodemus dwell in the rock verse one you there there was a man of the pharisee he is among the pharisees yet brother branham say he was good to the brethren amen so when you want to destroy a pharisee be careful there must be a king like someone you okay now there was a man of the pharisee named who a ruler of the he was a master he's stronger he dwell in the rock he dwell in the law of moses are you there job two verse 3 jesus answer him and say to him verily verily i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the what the kingdom of god amen then nicodemus asked jesus and he said how can a man how can these things be done am i gonna go back again in my mother's wound and be born again or what look at verse 9 nicodemus censored and said to him how can these things be jesus answered and said to him are you uh of what nicodemus was a master a keynote is strong and he dwell in the rock but he's among the bad people are you there he said jesus said are you a master in israel and no not this thing so by the way i'm saying look at gamaliel and look at dignicodemus and never give the scripture and leave it alone it's up to you to dig go to john chapter 7. amen john chapter 7 verse 50. if you dare you can say amen remember he's strong he's in the rock but he stand for the children of god amen verse 50 who nicodemus you see that says to them he that came to jesus by night being one of them being one of who the pharisee are you there does your does our law judge any man before he hear him or know what he does they answered and said to him are you also of galilee search and look for out of galilee around no prophet and every man went to his own house so when the ecumenical council was gathered together in order to kill jesus suddenly nicodemus rose up again and pulled them by the word niconemus is sitting on the rock he's bringing the word he said the lord said you cannot judge a man without even seeing him are you there when he pulled the law the pharisees stopped it's a k night between a malachite are we okay are we clear let's go to john chapter 19 hallelujah john chapter 19 verse 39 if you dare you can say amen when brother branham says something you don't understand just believe it and leave it alone amen hallelujah verse 19 uh chapter 19 verse 39 are you there they killed jesus i believe they killed jesus and everything let's see what this canaanite does and there came also who nicodemus which at first came to jesus by night they kept referring to him and brought a mixture of what and i lost also a hundred pound weight then took the body of jesus and wound it in a line and clothes with the spices as the manner of the jew is to bury so even in the death of jesus christ when jesus was killed by the pharisees yet nicodemus went there and continued to do good to the body of jesus christ that's why so say i'm not gonna destroy you the word of god is speaking why did saul do that [Music] amen that was nicodemus let's go to act chapter five let's see gamalien nicodemus among the pharisees yet something was grieving his heart when they're trying to destroy jesus christ amen that's why a sheep among the goat we clear act chapter 5 verse 34 if you dare you can say amen then stood there up one in there in the castle they were in the council trying to destroy now not jesus by trying to destroy the apostle that received the spirit of jesus christ [Music] the same spirit that killed jesus is now hunting the many jesuses are we there but among those spirits there is always a k-9 [Music] are you there verse 34 their stood then stood there up one in the council if what nicodemus was what are we clear a pharisee named chameleon a what they are strong they are in the rock doctor of the law [Music] everybody this one was a master the other one was a doctor in the law they are strong they are in the rock but they are in between a malachite amen head in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostle forth a little a little space and say to them you men of israel take heed to yourself what you intend to do as touching these men jump to verse 38 and now i say to you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to nothing but if it be of god you cannot overthrow him less happily you'll be found even to fight against god so we found out again camarillo here standing for the children of god yet being part of the council we're clear now that's your keynote let's go back to first samuel chapter 15 i just want you to understand that so we can move on because you got to detect an amalekite amen now salt of them get out because you show kindness you are the sheep that came to visited me in a hospital that came to help my children that give them water when they were thirsty because of that depart because i'm gonna judge the goat everybody clear when they came up out of egypt so they cannot deport from among the americans they got out the protection that the amalekite had gath amen because they cannot dwell their dwelling place are strong the americans take refuge there and sit there and use those head as their computer [Music] hallelujah jump to verse seven and so smoth the amalekite from avila until you come to sure that is opposite egypt and he took ergag the king of thee so now we found out that the king of the americas his name is agag amen so this battle right here ag who is the king of the america this battle now between mordecai and heaven is not really the battle between mordecai and heaven it is the battle between god and amalek amen you thought so destroy all the americans but saul spared the king of the amalekite whose name was elgar at this point amalek was a pagan nation i'm going somewhere let's go to verse 8. and he took agag the king of the amalekite alive and elderly destroy what so you will think that there won't be any amalekite left right only the king right let's continue oddly destroy the people with the age of the sword but saul and the people spare agag and the best of the ship and of the oxen that's a whole message here and of the faddling and the lambs and all that was and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile or refused that they destroyed utterly in other words when saul got into the battle he began to choose or to pick and choose what to do he look he said ah this one we can use him in the church this one we can do it here the prophet said destroy all. [Music] verse 10 then came the word of the lord to samuel saying he repents me that i have set up soul to be king for his turn back from following me and has not performed my commandment and he grieved samuel brother orbit and he cried to the lord all night amen watch clearly and when samuel rose up early to meet saul in the morning he was taught samuel saying so came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and he's gone about and pass on and goes to gilgal what is he going to do to gilgal watch it and samuel came to seoul and so said to him blessed be you of the lord you cut somebody god bless you brother amen amen i have performed the commandment of there who asked him a question so why is he meeting samuel and suddenly i have prefer blessed be god bless you say i have before the commandment of the lord who asked you a question have you caught a child doing something and daddy are you doing are you there i didn't even ask you a question amen and samia said what mean then this bleeding of the ship in my ear and the lowering of the oxen which are here and saul said they not me it's they it's the people they have brought them from the amalekite for their people not him now spare the best of the ship and off the accent to do what to sacrifice to the lord did god ask you for it you are bringing cursed feet to the church are you there if you play the lottery you win don't bring your tax to this church amen if you win the lottery don't bring your amen if you're selling pot you're cheating over there don't bring your time to this church the bible says that even the words of a prostituted male or female cannot come in the house of god if the money you getting it from your boyfriend don't bring it here [Music] amen praise the name of the lord job to verse 18 and the lord sends you to a journey and say go and not only destroy there there so america what from the scripture you understand now allah from the scripture are sinners amen so they told him go and destroy the sinners destroy the gods hallelujah 72 ascended to everybody you say well they are good i don't care how good the people they are if they are contrary to that word get the thing out of you it is a growing leader a malachite looks cute looks innocent it looks like it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it well brother branham i go down there because well you just remember any amalekite anything that denies there brother branham never give you the scripture where the bible says the amalekite are the sinner [Music] if you don't understand anything about the message don't attack it amen the message is perfectly lined up with the bible when brother branham said the american is anything that denies the word there is a scripture for it even though brother branham did not give it to you it's up to you to study amen the king of amalek and god said i'm going to have wall with amalek from generation 2 generation everybody clear so far now the war here is it looks like it's monika fighting about a man but it's not it is the amalekite fighting with who god god why when god met so paul in acts chapter 9 the bible says that he fell to the earth and heard the voice saying unto him so so why persecute me have paul met jesus one day no have paul persecuted the man jesus christ amen he continues he said who are the lord and the lord the lord that will have war with amalek the lord say i am jesus whom the persecution so when you are attacking the church you are actually fighting with god amen praise the name of the lord that's why he said whatever you do to the list you are doing unto me because god is in this church what was in god was poor into christ what was in christ was pour into the church that is the temple of god today amen the conflict is not between monaco and emman but the conflict is between god and satan god were god in his people brother branham says this that this world is now standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces i gave you some quote last week and they are both religious forces pharisees they are key night among them and i believe that these great forces are soon coming to a head they're going to bump and both of these forces was represented in the two sons of who the two sons of isaac are esau and but we found out that god also said that he will fight esau are we together let's get to this take second samuel chapter one hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord everybody good they thought sold by god they said god killed the amalekite the amalekites were not with israel the americans were dealing were living with the kinite amen saul have to go there and when he went he found the king knight and the amalekite living together at first when saul was sent to kill amalek amalek was a nation separated from israel amalek was a pagan nation are you there when saul refused to do the commandment of god soul actually preserve amalek are you ready are you ready if you would let me drop this so it's going to help you go back to first samuel chapter 15. just keep a second verse one so we made something here and it's going to help you jump to verse 33 hallelujah amen verse 33 are you there and samuels say in other words when samuel came he said you spare the king you spare the people and samuel look he said bring me that king hey god and samuel killed the king you will think when they killed the king when saul destroyed the amalekite it looks like there is no more amalekite left right look verse 33. and samuel said ago the sword of aggar he's a killer as your sword had made women chadlers he was a killer you see that it was killing people so shall your mother be childless among women and samuel you airgag pieces before the lord in gilgal so this prophet take a gag and kill him instead of just killing the prophet aegon or uh killing the king aegon he's actually carrying him in pieces why amen edgar was the king of amalek he was representing the kingdom of amalek and samuel being a prophet was showing that the kingdom of amalek will be stricken and divided in pieces are we okay we okay now but if so would have performed the commandment of god amalek will be destroyed one time but because so did not perform the command of the commandment of god even though the kingdom of amalek was divided in pieces yet amalek escape now let's go back to second samuel chapter one this is where you're going to see what's going on are you there saul went into the battle god refused to talk to soul the battle of the philistine when saul got there they killed him amen so someone is coming out verse one now we came to pass after the death of who saul is dead when david was returning from the slaughter of thee i thought the amalekite was destroying their king you see what happened amalek is kept amen you see that now amalekite and david had aboard two days in ziegler and he came to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from the devil so this man is not coming out of the camp of the philistine this man is coming out of the camp of israel let's see who this man is we okay so with his clothes rant earth upon his head and so he was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance so the battle was raging suddenly somebody came he turned his clothes he put earth on his head he's coming oh my god oh my god you see david fell down and begin to respect david he looks like his grief about soul this man is touched they kill king souls oh my god the kill king so he said what is going on if david david i recognize you as being the king let's see who this man is you okay stay alert amen and david said to him from where come you and he said to him out of the camp of what this man is not coming from the camp of the philistine he's coming from the camp of israel watch carefully from the cape of israel i am escaped and david said to him i went to the mother i pray you tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people are also fallen and dead and so and jonathan and his son are dead also this man is very specific on the detail he just doesn't say that oh we lost the battle no he's specific he said i was there so and so died so and so died so and so died so and so died how were you in the battle that you know all those detail are we okay we are trying to uncover amalek okay let's go down to verse five and david said to the young man that told him how you know you see now how you know that soul and jonathan and his son are dead everybody was there fighting fighting fading how did you know that soul was dead discernment let's see his answer verse 6 and the young man that told him say has happened by chance i thought he was sad her soul is dead so this day jonathan is dead how did you know saul was dead amen watch i happened by chance upon monkey ball behold so lean upon his so soul was upon his spirit he was already weak follow me carefully amen this man never approached saul when son was strong [Music] because when soul is strong soul was a fighter amen he waited until soul is weak follow me carefully you need this for your life amen so lean upon his spirit and lord the chariot and the horsemen fell ahead after him and when he looked behind him he saw me and called to me and i answered here i am everybody ready are you ready verse 8. and he said to me who are you so look he's about to die he look he sees somebody standing watching him some say wait a minute who are you amen and i answered him i am here how did an amalekite got into the camp of israel america used to be a pagan nation that was separated from israel amen so by missing to apply the word of god amalek now is not outside israel he is within israel he is no more outside the message he is in the message [Applause] amen let me do you know there was a beast in the book of revelation amen if you go just keep where we are in revelation 13 the bible says that there is a beast that rose and that beast was killed to death are we there but he survived amen the killing of soul was not enough to kill the beast are you following me then the beast that was paper began move and become purple did i lost anybody did i lost anybody in the book of revelation chapter 13 there is a beast that come out of the water but that peace have a deadly wound upon his head but that wound that was given with to him was to kill him but he was not dead he survived but when he survived brother brother said he moved from being a pagan nation into a proper nation into a religious nation a malacata no longer outside they are now you can read this at home i'm trying to save time now beyond any shadow of doubt who that the beast was that power that had the deadly wound that did leave it was when pagan rome was killed and pepperon took it place when pagan power was killed and papa power took place revelation 13 14. amen in the seven church ages brother branham say pick up daniel dreams and show him the vision and the gentile kingdom when they show daniel the gentile kingdom the head of the god and defeat and all the way down and the roman empire and the roman empire broke up into what 10 kingdom eastern and western rome so that's why when samuel took the kingdom he have to cut the kingdom in pieces amen that was when the beast received a deadly wound rome was destroyed into many nations but rome was not dead rome changed from pagan into pepper the amalekite is no longer outside the amalekite is within israel we okay now let's go back to verse eight and he said to me who are you and i answered him i am an amalekite he says to me again stand i pray you upon me and slay me for anguishes come upon me because my
