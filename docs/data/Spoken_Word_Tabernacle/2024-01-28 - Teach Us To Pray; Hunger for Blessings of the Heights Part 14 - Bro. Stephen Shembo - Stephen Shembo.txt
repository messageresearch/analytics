TRANSCRIPT
========================================
denominational stuff to him he's got to have Eagles food that's the freshness of the meat not what Moses done not what somebody else done not what sanki finny Knox Calvin but right now the meat that's killed for this day that's the part of Christ that died to make this word be confirmed that's what they eat on get it not what Noah done what Moses done they're examples we seen read what they did but it's what he promised to do now he was was a word back there that was a carcass for that day the day of of uh Wesley was a carcass for that day the day of Luther was a carcass for that day but they don't go back to that that's already contaminated what was left over must be burned to the communion even don't leave it for the Next Generation the Bible said when you're taking the communion what's left over of it don't even let it lay the morning burn it amen so refer back to that no we got fresh food today that's the word that's promised to this hour be made manifest in this hour that's where the Eagles are where the carcass is we can stay a long time on that but I'm sure you understand what I mean all right fifth question will the bride be gathered together in one place at the Rapture and will it be in the west no don't have to be there yeah the bribe will be gathered together in one place that is true but not until the resurrection see for we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord Ephesians uh uh uh second Thessalonians the 5th chapter I believe it is we which alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep universally for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air therefore the bribe will all be together when it goes to meet the Lord see it will be together but it don't necessarily mean that we they all have to be set in one place like this because the bride is sleeping in the dust of the Earth around the world from the Arctic to the tropics and from from the East to the west from North to the South Jesus said when the son of man shall appear well I said it it be like the light that shines from the East even into the West the whole thing there will be a resurrection Rapture and away it'll go and before it ever go up to meet him watch the wisdom of the Lord now let's say for instance in talking this I'm saying this through thoughts of Grace and Faith in the word that I say we I'm throwing myself in with you all and uh and with the whole body of Christ Christ universally I I believe that when I say we then I mean by Grace I I believe it by faith I believe it in his grace that we will be among those people that'll be caught up now the first thing happens when we're resurrected the ones which are living will just still remain the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be Awakening time and those which are asleep in the dust now not those that are asleep in sin because they sleep right on they don't awake for another thousand years but those who are are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and they'll these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of the Lord and then we'll all get together and when they begin to get together then we wish alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden they'll be like a sweep go over us and you're changed you're turned back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this Sudden Change after while you you're traveling like a thought and you can see those then who are already resurrected oh oh what an hour then we'll gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air it's not necessary if your uncle is buried down in Southern Kentucky he has to be brought up in Indiana or a buried in Indiana has to be taken to Southern Kentucky no matter where he is them are dead in the sea shall rise from the sea those that were destroyed in that Arena and eat up by lines those who are thrown into fiery furnaces and not even the bones will be left or the dust they shall still rise whether they was in Rome the arena at Rome or whether they were in the Tropic jungles of the South or in the Frozen regions of the north they'll rise from the dead and be changed and be brought up and the living shall be changed in a moment of twinkling eye be caught up together look at the missionaries has died down there in the fields of Africa look at them has died up there in the in the the Frozen regions of the north look at them that died in the arena all over the world in the Congo all around across the world they've died everywhere in China Japan around the world and the coming of the Lord will be Universal this Rapture will watch the changing there will be two in the bed I'll take one and leave one the same moment there will be two in the field I'll take on leave one one on the dark side of the earth and one on the light side of the earth it'll be a universal Rapture yes the church will all be together but after after the resurrection and uh Rapture has set in now if that is not way you see it well that's all right now I'm not exactly talking I say that we're taping this you see and it might be other ministers who disagree with that that's all right dear brother brandham my question is on baptism when is a person saved I have heard it was when a person believed some say that when you receive the Holy Ghost you

I love you parent too but I love my body amen yeah they take stress away from me when they bring their stuff I'm just laughing and say okay keep moving he just relaxes me number chapter 23 vers uh 24 if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God good to see you sister Chambers and welcome again to spoken word Tabernacle the Bible says speaking about Israel he says behold the people shall rise up as a what a great lion let me see okay as a great lion you need to stay tight because I will get to an Avenue and we take off amen he said the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a Young Lion he shall not lie down until he does what eat of the prey you might be seated so this lion eat flesh we know that eat flesh from a prey amen shall eat of the prey Kama and do what drink the blood of the slain we clear so the lion eat flesh and do what drink the blood of the slame is my Bible different than yours a lion has two diet the lion can eat the Flesh and do what drink the blood it is that save the lord it's coming from the Bible so the lion eat the flesh or eat the meat or whatever you want to call it and also do what drink blood so the eagle and the lion have the same diet amen you remember that right so the eagle and the lion have the same diet the ego eat the Flesh and also drink the blood yes sir glory to God let's go to job 39 where we were talking about the eagle so today we got another one a lion eat the Flesh and drink the blood Job chapter 39 verse 27 if you dare you can say amen yeah this is where we will base our thought and fly from there the Bible says that does the eagle Mount up at your command and make her nest where on high so the nest of an eagle is never below amen an eagle always have a nest on high the nest of an eagle yes is always on high amen amen if you an eagle you know where your nest should be not below we must go on high we clear we clear verse 28 she dwells and abides on what rock so not only is the nest high but we need to know specifically where is that Nest Lord that Nest is not in the bush somewhere or in a forest somewhere she abide in a specific place which is called a rock and a rock in the message means what Revelation it means Revelation and also a rock means Christ because Christ was the rock that was following Israel we gave you the scripture on that amen so she dwell and abide on the Rock upon the Water the CRA of the rock do you know what it means the crack is the peak so the if if you have uh a mountain like this the eagle won't put a nest here the eagle will not put a nest here the eagle will go all the way to the peak there amen right that's where the eagle put the nest there where he looks like a pyramid amen so the ego goes to the peak which is called the crck or the cliff or the highest part of the mountain that's where the eagle put a pig um a nest there the Bible says she dwells and abide on the rock upon the crack of The Rock and the Strong place in other words that's where she that if you look in another translation the Strong place is interpreted as an inaccessible place in a place where nobody can reach no one no Predator can get there at the peak of the rock that's where the ego stays there amen so if you want to find an eagle according to the scripture you must go high you must go to the Rock but the rock must be the peak of the rock that's where you're going to see that eagle amen so the position of an eagle is on the peak of the rock or the crack of the Rock Amen verse 29 from there from where from where the crack of the Rock from the crck of the Rock from the peak of the Rock Amen from the crck from the peak of the Rock from there she does what she seek the pray in other words She searches she spes so the eego doesn't seek the prey down here are we together the eagle doesn't seek his pray right here the eagle goes all the way to the peak there and when he stop on the peak right here this is the position that the ego use to see the prey in other words the ego have to go so high to see the food are we together the eagle have to climb so high on the peak of The Rock and from that position that's the position he uses or he uses as a radar to spy out and to search its own food or its own prey amen so the food of an eagle depend to the height depend to the altitude amen the higher the ego goes the better the ego can see so ego don't search food below they search food from on high when they are on high on the peak on the crack on the Rock that's when they're searching for food so the food is found on the peak the food of an eagle is found up there the food is on the valley here amen but for the ego to see what's going on in the valley he have to go to the peck when it's on the peck then the eyes Is 2020 it's working because the scriptures say from here from The Rock from the peak that's where he searches the food so the food that search from a Peak from a high from the highest point Point that's where you can find your food if you have not reached that point yet you don't see good praise God you will catch up my friend the Bible says in verse 29 from there she seeks the pray and her eyes do what Behold a far off so the eyes of an eagle see far off where from the crack of the Rock from the crack of the rock so the crack of The Rock here give the food and also works for the eyes of an eagle amen glory to God verse uh 30 her young one also do what suck up blood we should have it right there and where the slains are you remember this there is what where the carcass is that's where you're going to find the we already explained it to you so the eagle eat flesh drink blood the lion eat flesh drink blood but the eagle you have to find it all the way on the top there you can find the lion right here yes sir amen you won't find a lion over there only an eagle can go there not even a Hulk can get there only an igle can get to the crack of the Rock Let's go to Vision one then we pray glory to God Ephesian chapter 1 amen verse three if you thereare you can say amen amen your camera will try to adjust with this light verse three the Bible say blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has done what blessed us with what all spiritual blessings where in Heavenly places where in Christ so your blessings are where in Christ in which places Heavenly places where in Christ your blessings are in the Heavenly places in what in Christ in the Rock Amen not down below in the the CRA of the Rock in the crack of the Rock in the Heavenly places toward the heaven there that's where your blessings are and not only some blessing but all amen that's why the ego have to be in the highest Place amen amen yes Lord in other words the book of your promises are here yes if you don't clam here you cannot access that book when you climb here and you get the book then you can read and you can see what's going on so there is a location that have your blessing there is a location that God pack everything you need for your life sir everything you need of he have a bank somewhere but that bank is not on the earth that bank is in the Heavenly places amen are we together listen to what brother Bram says about Heavenly places brother Bram say heavenly places oh I wish I had time here I got a Mark here in my Bible about Heavenly places what is Heavenly places Heavenly places is just for a moment is the what believer's position in Christ are we together so your position is where in Christ and the position of an eagle is where in Christ are we together he say is the Believers position in Christ where the Believers stand is where in Heavenly places in Christ in Heavenly places so Christ is the position of a Believer and Christ is where the believer stand and we find out that the ego dwell and abide on the Rock that's where he stays and from the rock the ego can search its food and according to Paul every spiritual blessing everything you have need of God put it somewhere there is a location that got your problem there is a Lo that got the answer to your problem that location is in Heavenly places in Christ let me read it over verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with some no how many blessing all so everything you need of is somewhere all spiritual blessing every spiritual blessing all yes they are in Christ all of them in other word there is nothing that is not in that place whatever you need is right there whatever you need is right there the problem is you need to get to that place and when you get to that place then

John chapter 6 as we begin to clim if you dare you can say amen amen you know where we stopped couple weeks ago John chapter 26 uh chapter 6 verse 27 if you thereare you can say amen amen Jesus says this that labor not you remember this for the meat which perishes the food that we eat every day but to labor for that meat which does what endureth endureth to what unto everlasting life to everlasting life which who the son of man the son of man shall give you so the one who's dispatching or Distributing or giving that food is the son of man because you need to know which office God is working whether God is working as a Son of God as the son of man or the son of David if you approach him wrong you miss it but the Lord Jesus Christ is saying that we need to work for meat we need to work for food but that food the one that can give you the food is the son of man you remember amen for the son of man shall give you for him the son of man has got the father what seal that word God the Father seals means that the son of man is the one that is certified amen by God to give you that kind of food he's the one that have God's approval he's the Distributor Center of God if you want to find the food that will endure to everlasting life there is only one place you can find it you need to First find where the son of man is if you find where the son of man is that's where the father has put his approval seal amen so if if you need that food find the son of man if you don't find the son of man it's a trouble but the ego is always where the carcasses amen that's where you're going to find the ego Amen in other words you will find an ego where the son of man is and the son of man means a prophet are we together the son of man means God as a prophet if it's a small Prophet we call him a son of man amen which is a prophet in the Old Testament amen we labor for the food that only the son of man only God himself as the son of man can give it to you everybody clear job to verse 53 this is where we stop the Bible says this then Jesus said to them verily verily I say to you except you eat the Flesh of who the son of not the Son of God not the son of David only the Flesh of the son of man amen except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink what his blood so the son of man have both the flesh amen and he also have the blood amen but we found out that we have two creature here both of those creature they can eat the Flesh and drink the blood one of them is a lion and other one one is an eagle are we together praise God he says verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have water no life that's why we clearly stated even yesterday we demonstrated clearly that without this message in this time there is no life am because this message is the son of man is the unfailing body word of the son of man amen are we together verse 54 whoo eats my flesh and drink my blood has what eternal life for you to have the eternal life you need to do what eat the flesh eat the Flesh and do what drink this Blood the blood of who Jesus Christ the blood of the son of man yes sir and the son of man is only found one place in this end time that's where you can get him he say who so eat my flesh right and drink my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is what meat indeed and my blood is what drink indeed my he that eateth my flesh everybody okay and drink my blood he dwells where in me and I am dwelling where in him so if God is dwelling in you and you are dwelling in him I need to check what kind of that you eating amen your diet will determine where you are in Christ amen whether I'm dealing with a Hulk or I'm dealing with an eag if you are an eag I need to see some blood amen I need to see some meat I need to look at your refrigerator and make sure you got some steak some bleeding steak am that are playing in your home some bleeding ties that are playing in your car some bleeding tapes that are playing on your iPad I need to check your phone to see if your phone is bleeding is bleeding Malachi 4 AM Luke 1730 am Revelation 107 amen and the voice of the seven Angel then the mystery of God will be revealed [Applause] am everybody together everybody together so two weeks ago we found out that a creature that have that diet is an eagle sir but today for some reason we found out that the eagle is not alone there is another creature that is called The Lion and the lion also can drink of this follow me carefully put your seat belt as we take it off amen according to the history of the seven Church ages the dispensation of the the Gentile has been divided in seven different period which are called the seven Church ages follow me carefully we got the Church of Ephesus we got the Church of smina we got the Church of pergamus we got the Church of Taran we got the Church of Sardis we got the Church of Philadelphia and the last one is the Church of what laia this is where we are number one number two number three number four number five number six and number seven we call this the seven Church ages according to the history of the church yes sir amen but according to the power or the anointing that were working in the church ages amen the church ages are divided in four category amen based on the four Beast amen keep your seat belt my friend I'm taking off the first Beast is what the second one is what the third one is what all of this is in the Bible this is review the third one is water and the fourth one is what it's a flying eagle not just an eagle but it f [Applause] the devil the devil the devil it's a flying eagle not just an eagle an eagle that fly amen everybody together so when the church start it started with a lion and this power were God's power that was sent to combat the Antichrist because we also have Seven Seals and the first four seals goes with the church edges are we together the first one was a white horse the second one was which horse the red one the third was what a black and the fourth was what this already is taking care of four seals the fifth seal belongs to the Jew The Sixth Seal is the Tribulation seal but the seventh seal is the Seal of Christ in the bride everybody okay everybody okay we got four and this is why we got four gospel that's why we got Matthew we got Mark we got Luke which is a man and we also got John which is the eagle everybody okay so even though the church have seven division but according to the anointing the church is divided into four division amen and the first one is a lion yes sir are we together are we together and the last one is a flying eagle and we found out that the lion and the eag have the same diet [Applause] amen are we together are we together a nox cannot drink blood a human being cannot drink blood because you're going to be a vampire but there is only two anointing that can handle the Flesh and that can also drink the blood that anointing started at the beginning and the other one is cing the amen are we together have I lost somebody glory to God before the lion anointing started in the age of Ephesus the ministry that follow that was the ministry of Christ himself Christ as the son of am men amen everybody okay and brother Bram say everything that was in God he pulled away in Christ and everything that was in Christ he P where he he be ped that in the church on the day of Pentecost so what the church receive on the day of Pentecost is an anointing that came from the son of man amen amen are you following me if a son man is sending an anointing everybody okay you must be careful who's there to be a goalkeeper to catch that anointing a teacher cannot catch that anointing an evangelist cannot catch that anointing a pastor cannot catch that anointing that anointing goes to son of man from son of man to son of man so the one who m be a messenger must be a son of man am everybody okay what I'm trying to say is the messenger to this age must be a prophet because the anointing coming up is coming from a prophet only a prophet has an ability to catch a [Applause] prophet everybody together let's go my friend let's read this in the fifth year brother Bram says this that when that Antichrist was doing what riding with his false teaching with his false teaching God sent his what teaching out so God have to send a teacher but that teacher must be a prophet amen that's why Paul was a teacher and a prophet amen glory to God Amen H let's go to the book of act Hall we got a new generation my friend where did Brother Bram is brother Bram say Paul is a prophet brother Bram say Paul is a prophet where is that written in the Bible amen if you thereare you can say amen amen act chapter 13 I want to nail this it's a kind of quick r you if you dare you can say amen amen now they were in the church that was where at Antioch certain what prophets and what teachers so these people are what prophet prophet and what teachers are we clear yes sir we need to know them okay these people are prophet and what teachers if you find them they prophet and teacher who are they amen amen as who Barnabas and the second one Simeon and the third one Niger Simeon called Niger and the third one Lucius of sirene and then who Manion and then who that's which had been brought man which has been brought up with who Herod Herod the chch and who that's it so Saul is a prophet and a teacher but let me clarify the S jum to verse 9 so we make sure we get it correct thing glory to God you verse n then who who also was called who so Paul is Saul everybody clear yes sir so Paul is both a teacher and he's also a prophet amen and brother Bram is saying here that when the Antichrist was riding with his fault teaching God sent this teaching out he sent what word the word the what the lion of the tribe of Judah give him more volume my friend the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the what word that is the reason the early church had what healing because the one handling that was a prophet amen that's the reason why they have what healing healing and they have What miracles and they had what Visions because the one that was there was a prophet and they had power is because he was the Living Word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that amen now you got it he sent his power Antichrist God sent his the word Antichrist false teaching the true teaching went with it to combat it now that was the first one now this was the first church Apostolic that went to meet him everybody clear let's go with the second one in the fifth seal in paragraph 141 brother brandham say now the first that was the first was the lion that r that pure what unadulterated word Paul had the pure unadulterated word in an anointing of a lion amen so everybody that was in the first church of Ephesus had to be a lion but we are not lion amen he says in the days of Paul the angel of the Church of what Ephesus Paul finding this church being the messenger to it remember Paul was finding the church at Ephesus became the messenger to that church and the spirit was in that land was a lion Spirit and the lion is the lion of the tribe of Judah coming from Christ which is Christ and Christ is the word Paul with the word for that age amen everybody okay so Paul started the Ephesian Church AG amen and Paul was both an Ephesian uh teacher and Ephesian prophet and everyone that was under the PA have to behave with the anointing of a lion and as an anointing of an Ison the first church was eating the Flesh of the son of man am and the PO and they were also drinking the Flesh of the son of man that's why the Antichrist could do nothing to the first church age amen that's why they resisted the niol spirit because the one who was there was a prophet am but later on he changed from a prophet to other people then the church fell amen but thank God there is another creature amen that was prepare for the last one everybody clear everybody clear that's why brother Bram say there will be another Ephesian Church AG Hallelujah amen are we together have I lost you William Marion Bram he says but we are promised according to what Revelation 10 and according to what Malachi 4 St Luke 22:17 and so forth that there is got to come a what in Ephesians to this there is Promised friend there must come a what in Ephesians why do we need another Ephesian in the end time because the first Ephesian was drinking the blood and was eating the flesh Amen in other word the must come and the son of man am are we together are we together he says that these Sevenfold what mysteries of what the word of God must be unfolded and it's and it's in the laition what that this take place I believe that we are have there so if there was an Ephesian here that's a lion that could eat of the Flesh and drink the blood brother Bram say there must be another Ephesian back again here in other word we must see creature that are eating the Flesh of the son of man and that are also drinking the blood everybody okay this is the mystery of Billy Paul I let that soak in Billy Paul haveen mystery of course he does you can swallow this my friend brother Bram say he was born where on Friday on the water the 13 and what time 3:00 in the evening he was we were going to call him what Jinx say amen amen and brother Bram say we don't believe in that do wi son his mother was a German and I was an Irish so instead we call him what h m any Michael but God had us to call him what Billy Paul from his father William May Bram and the great sent Paul what the Apostle in other word Paul and William Maran Bram had something in common amen and God give him a son by giving him Billy Paul telling him that The Lion and the eagle are going to meet together hallu Hallelujah this is a steak my friend this is a steak my friend you got to be mature in the message you got to have some teeth Amen in order to chew what I'm saying the prophet life is a mystery am the prophet children are Mysteries even the prophet diet have a mystery am even when he's playing with his two daughters it's Mysteries hallah Hallelujah don't worry my friend why is his daughter Rebecca and one is called Sarah why is that why is the last one Joseph and in the media there was Sharon Rose which died through the church ages through the Dark [Applause] Ages the first child is Billy Paul because the Apostle Paul have to start and the last son is what why are those two put on the end because the last Ministry is where Perfection come but in between that you're going to go through Rebecca and Sarah if you notice Sarah came after Rebecca because Sarah bring you to Genesis 18 where the son of man have to give the back Hallelujah we have a prophetic message amen his family got a message am his life got a message am his name got a message the letter of his name got a message even the number of his name got a message I'm not preaching a man I'm preaching God through a man hallah Shake somebody's hand say I hope you can swallow this thing glory to God glory to God you can crack some bones everybody okay everybody good everybody good so we found out that there was an Ephesian Church age and there has to be another Ephesian Church age amen because these two anointing are the only one that can get to the diet of the son of man amen but our church ages our Ephesian is not Paul Ephesian let's go my friend brother Bram say the day of Pentecost the spirit did what directed it right into directed right into that to who Joel 238 that was their promise see the day of who Luther he directed what right into there Wesley is the and in this last day of what Pentecost but this is what another age this is what the calling out of the Bride not what 2,000 years ago at Pentecost or a what the repeat or what to return because Paul preaching part yesen even though Paul had the son of man Ministry they were F that Paul lost a lion cannot fly as much as a lion is powerful he will remain on the earth there is only one creature that can come on the Earth but he can also fly he can also take us not a lion only an eagle so this Aion is not a I am a vision it is a fion of the [Applause] eagle everybody together everybody together brother Bram say now we are into the age of what the eag the what the Revelation to be what revealed that's why the Antichrist no one was able to call his name the lion Paul was not able to the ox was not able to the man was not able to it took the last anointing to call his name death amen because an eagle flying higher that's the better they can [Applause] see let's go my friend I'm giving time for somebody to maneuver he says now we are into the edge of what the eag the what the Revelation to be revealed the what whole thing not a part Paul preach a part but we are with the what whole thing now compare this with Revelation what the 10th chapter what verse 1 to7 we shall see here in this Revelation the Revelation here from where 101 to to 7 that in the days of water the sounding of the seventh Angel's message was to finish up all the water the mysteries of God that's why Paul say when that which is perfect willcome Paul knew that what he had had not Perfection amen the Perfection is done with Joseph [Applause] am you need to remain spiritual my friend Hallelujah he says Lord I'm thankful I'm very thankful I'm thank I'm I'm very thankful Thanksgiving to you Lord not for what natural food yet that but Lord they what end time is here I'm thankful for what this spirit spiritual food Lord the spiritual food of the water seven seal was promised to be how open they were not promised to Paul Paul was not mandate to open the seals amen as much as he started and the lion can eat the Flesh and drink the blood only the eagle can go to the higher height amen only the eagle can take the Rapture amen amen amen everybody together are we clear together are we clear together there is an eion that have to come that eion is not an eisan of liing it is an eion of flying ego hallelujah amen where we eat the son of man not the part of Paul but we have the whole thing that's going to be revealed for the end time everybody clear as we dealing Now with an ego what is an ego let's go my friend read it my friend so we are looking in the face of a great subject and a great water and I have always loved the eagle though he calls me what a lot of trouble let me move this way so everybody can see brother Bram say I have always loved what the eag though he Calla what a lot of trouble he eat up of what of many deer that I kill so every time brother Bram kill a de and he leave a de there was a creature that always come and pick up the deer that the prophet kill because the eego is a prophet and William Mar Bram was a prophet and whatever the prophet shoot he belongs to me whatever William Mar BR preach whatever William May Bram preach it belongs to me if the prophet shoot it I will take it and I will go with it that's the characteristic of a prophet of a eagle as eal in this message whatever William maram said amen even his come you know that come got Revelation don't worry my friend whatever the prophet shoot that's what we pick [Applause] [Music] up Lord help me up he said no he caused me a lot of trouble he's eat up of many of what deer deer that I kill but I still got a respect for him he is a bird of water the very word eag itself means what riper with the Beak he rip with what his beak and he does what then feeds how do you reap the Devil with the what word with the what that's why we in the age of a spoken word because our strength is not in a mle our strength is in the word amen whatever we speak has a power to [Applause] amen Oh Glory to God brother Bram say we shall take that for just a moment one that feed by the water the be in other word he feed by his mouth he and that's a good thing to liken God unto the Eagen because God feed his church by what his word his word comes by what his mouth men shall not live by what bread alone but what by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth speak out of the mouth of who God God feed where his church by what his mouth our soul are sustained upon the Water word of God how beautiful that is to the eag glory to God listen to this brother Bram say the church is starving today for some of that word there is nothing will take it place no nothing will take the place to the eagle amen but the real food eego food and we are what Eagles so we have to have what eag food not social what Gatherings not political what speeches not in thisit we must have the eager food not political speeches or no some what little Stitch and so party but we need what some Eagle food said from the water mouth of Jehovah Eagle that is why he lack us onto what e eego eat eego food amen ego do not get social media amen they don't get political they don't get motivation [Applause] speaking Glory Glory Glory Glory I think that one of the main thing that cause us to miss the blessing and remember Faith cometh where by hearing hearing what of the word of God continue my friend and the reason that we miss it is because we don't feed on it enough uh-huh Jesus says what man shall not live by bread of alone but by what every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen man shall have his what Daily Bread give us this day by the what word of God but we try to make it more or what less for some of what far off promise way away in some other ages but the Bible says now amen we are what the sons of God not we will be but we are what now follow me carefully as we claming brother Adam say this we know that sin is unbelief no matter how holy we are what we all do if we still disbelieve we are what Sinners the Bible say he that believe not is condemned already so we know that we must do what believe every word that proceed out of the mouth of who God that should be what our daily bread so our daily bread should come from the word of God Amen everybody clear so far listen to now brother brandham say our body need food and drink each day in order to survive our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink then our body do what weakens there is something in us that we must have food one day's food will not last for the next day you got to have food how many days each day to do what strengthen your mortal being you can live over but you are Wecker the second day you are still weaker and the third day you getting how tremendous weak so we must eat God's word every day amen everybody clear so far get ready now that is the reason what God likened him to his church liken him to his church you are a candle that's set on the hill that's right how many ambition High ambition what kind of ambition High ambition what kind of ambition High ambition your ambition should be where high in Heavenly places as an eager your ambition must be how high don't worry my friend we're going to stretch you up high what and high what anticipation we are expecting what great things so it is normal for you to expect God for great things [Applause] amen if you are a true eer it is normal for you to have high anticipation it is normal for you to come to church expecting something big Hallelujah he says well I'm a Pentecostal that s that done for me I'm expecting what greater things I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a Oneness Tess threeness or whatever you are that don't satisfy me I got what the ambition to to do what to move on to move on until what I meet him up up I receed the what holy ghost that said that he did with me I'm just still what taking and moving how higher and how higher just moving what way high with what kind of ambition High ambition what kind of expectations high expectations don't worry my friend you're going to get it when I hear of a church that has not got any ambition to do what to grow amen amen amen I didn't say it brother Bram say it go ahead read it again my friend when I hear of a church that has not got any ambition to do what grow there is something wrong with what that church that's it the Church of the Living God has got what high vision and another thing the Church of the Living God is built where High because it's got what high anticipation and what expectation the ego built the rock where High because of the ambition are how high the expectation are how [Music] [Applause] high brother Bram say say well we belong to the church Our Father serve in this church years ago that might be F but the Church of the Living of the Living God can set still its ambition is to go how higher or what farther glory to godj he says the eagle he built his next way high in the Rock High in the Rock he's like the church the Church of Jesus Christ is the church that sets on the hill that gives light it is what high it's got how many amb what kind of ambition High ambition he ought to have high what expectation and what expectation rather he should have what high expectations because we've been expecting God to do what something a Church of the Living God must have high expectations amen because we Ser a big [Applause] God Paul had an expectation according to his level of revelation arus got their expectation based on the Revelation but our Revelation have no limitation we got the whole thing Hallelujah so our expectation must be always high until you meet Jesus [Applause] Christ father help me brother Bram say this he goes out and you ought to see him he never built his nest on the ground a eagle won't built his nest on the ground the eagle B built his nest way as high as he can get in the what highest peak so if you have many Peaks amen the eag will pick the highest [Applause] [Music] [Applause] one everybody okay if you call an eagle you say where are you going to put your bre your your your your bird nest the eagle will look at the highest and you will call him that he's proud you will call him that he always love High stuff but there is a reason why he's going higher because his food is on the height his Blessing is on the height he everybody okay brother Bram say when he pick up a pick he will always go to the highest [Applause] one amen yes Lord where are we going my friend where are we going my friend that's why I don't like young people in the message especially boys that are narrow [Applause] minded that are comfortable living in an apartment until Jesus comes come on brother amen you must stretch yourself [Applause] up you are supposed to be honor amen your father owns everything [Applause] amen you supposed to be renting properties up to [Applause] people amen I'm working in the gas station how much do you make you are even unable to pay a rent let me zero that up my friend small tunel Vision the expectation of an eagle is higher higher spiritually higher financially higher materially [Applause] hallelujah amen amen amen listen to your Prophet don't worry we're going to get you to that you spiritual stay spiritual that's very good listen to this my friend brother Bram says in souls in prison he says remember these seven pics up there you remember the PS they could they could tell you there is a a pick Beyond that it's on the Continental Divide it goes right into the desert from there on eternity sets in brother Bram is talking about seven PS one two oh God help me one 2 3 4 five six seven PS yes and brother Bram says that eternity sets in seven PS right on the continental divide that is right between right and wrong and at the end of that the what third pool was the last pool of the what rain brother Bram say when they he saw seven Pits on the last one that's where the third pool is follow me carefully because the pick of an eagle is almost is always the highest everybody okay brother Bram say there was three outstanding picks and those three PS are the what first and the what second and the what third pole so brother Bram counted one 2 three and he found out that the third was higher are you following me then he goes four five and he found the fifth was a little bit more higher then he goes six and the seven one everybody okay and brother Bram say those three PS right there among the seven are the first pull the second pull and the third pull if you bring an eagle here which Fe is he going to stand on hallelujah [Music] hallelujah are we together are we together listen to brother Bram the first two small Peak the first what two small Peaks continue my friend then another small Peak read it slowly let's go the first what two small Peaks and then large Peak number three and then another small Peak and then a larger Peak number five and then a small Peak and then a great large Long snowcat Mountain huah and brother Bram say I said Lord I do not understand what I mean so the first P was right there the second pool was right there and the third pool is the highest one am the great lodge but brother Bram say e when they put their nest they will always put their nest where on the highest P so which pick should we in the church in the message have our church [Applause] seted everybody okay because the eego when he places his nest he must Place The Nest where it is inaccessible where no pray that you can get there if you put your nest on the first pool denomination will match you Lord Lord have we not cast that devil in your name have we not prophesy in your name amen and Jesus say I never knew you everybody okay so the first pool they can in person and they did it for they did it for the second pool but the third pool is where the devil is lost that's where you place the [Applause] church so the position of the prad is on the third pool on the opening of the [Applause] word a message Church must be based not on Miracle not on Prophecy but on the word Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word will never pass away if I need to place you on the word because that's your position that's where no pray that you can get there on the highest peak on the Capstone [Applause] Peak on the peak of [Applause] perfection Hallelujah get on YouTube you will see Miracle you will see prophecy tell them what are they preaching how can you help miracle and prophecy and women are preaching wearing pants amen amen you can't handle that one Amen brother Bram says this my friend that is what many times that we do in the spiritual realm I'm good in time my friend very good in time you see each day we got to commune with who Christ we got to talk with him how many days each day we got to settle it with him how many days each day Paul say I die each day each day I do what I die let I live not me but who Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs what spiritual food and what communion with the Lord how many days each day to do what survive yes Jesus says what man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so each day we got to study the Bible am not read the Bible you got to study the Bible because a ego when he's on the word that's when he's pying his food am that's when you are looking for the promise of the day what is in this Bible that God can do for me today I'm not reading the Bible because brother Steven say read your Bible I'm reading the Bible because I'm spying my foodall I'm trying to find a cat for the day a rabbit for the day a meat for the day I need to do some hunting a promise that I don't know something that I have not reach yet your expectation should be higher oh God he say so each day we got to do what study the Bible some people doesn't study it at all some picks it up every two or three times a year but a what a real real believer that is how really spiritually built up he reads his Bible how every day and talks to the Lord that's right that's right man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth what out of the mouth of God listen to this brother Bram say how many in days past and even in this day how they misjudge things by not taking it from the word of God amen amen he says whatever Val mistake England made then whatever Val mistake they give by giving back Indian her rights but they don't realize those things because they do not read the Bible amen and if that be true among nations how much more is it among mankind tonight who do not value their what life how day by day to do what read the Bible so if you don't read your Bible every day brother Bram say you don't value your life because your Survivor depend on the word it depends on the word of God that's where your food is brother Bram say and and to read the Bible and see what what God has laid where in his word for who every man and your attitude toward what God and toward what his word so the eagle when he stand all the way here he's not just standing wasting time he's standing there spying searching for food so when you are listening to the tap you are looking for food you are looking for something that will St your heart for the day so when you leaving home you leaving home with a promise you living home with a [Applause] cat this Bible you can read it and read it every day but one day you read

purpose than this we feel that that by the promise of God we have assembly under the wings of who the almighty that he as a hand would cover what her chicken would protect us from what all that we are Desiring him to protect us from that he would hover us and do what nourish us and would give us what today our daily bread how both physically and spiritually but physically and how spiritually that we might have the what sustaining strength of the body to do what walk about upon the Earth and to and the sustaining power of the what Holy Spirit to bring the word of God to a what a hungry people that is what power is in the church now but it's controlled by what a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandment it is a law of what faith Jesus says what all things are possible to them that believe and if you can do it believe it whatever God will what lead your soul to believe stop who's leading your soul God to do what to believe whatever God leads your soul to what believe it is what yours every place the soul of your fo can set by what faith God did what to you what amen it is what yours you do what you possess it if you can find the what the key to this law of faith that
