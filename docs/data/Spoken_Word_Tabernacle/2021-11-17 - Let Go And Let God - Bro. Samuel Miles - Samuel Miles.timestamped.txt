[31:56] sister joanne we appreciate that song
[32:00] walk with jesus
[32:02] amen
[32:03] when brother caleb was speaking tonight
[32:05] he just caught rad at
[32:08] what i was looking in the scripture
[32:10] because the bible say enoch walk with
[32:12] god
[32:13] amen
[32:14] he walked with god and the bible say he
[32:16] was not for god took him
[32:19] what else do you want in this hour but
[32:21] working with god
[32:23] do you know the power of working with
[32:25] god
[32:26] do you know where it is it's in hebrew
[32:30] in the book of genesis the bible say
[32:32] enoch walked with god
[32:35] and he was not for god took him
[32:38] that's all
[32:40] how did he walk with god
[32:44] let's go to you 11.
[32:50] amen
[32:52] brother david can you give me a little
[32:53] bit more
[32:57] i love it when it's plain
[33:01] hebrew chapter 11
[33:06] verse 5.
[33:08] you're there
[33:10] the bible say by what
[33:13] you see how he walked with god
[33:16] amen
[33:18] by faith
[33:20] enoch was translated
[33:22] if enoch was translated by faith
[33:26] faith is a revelation
[33:28] so enoch must have have the revelation
[33:31] of translation
[33:34] and the revelation of translation we
[33:36] know where he lies
[33:38] no wonder brother branham say enoch
[33:42] have rapturing faith
[33:46] because rapturing faith is the faith
[33:48] that can translate you
[33:51] and the bible say he was the seventh
[33:53] from adam
[33:55] everybody died
[33:57] adam died
[33:59] able died said that this one died that
[34:02] when he reached the seventh one somebody
[34:05] broke the circle
[34:07] amen
[34:08] showing that in the seven church ages
[34:11] the last one somebody must break the
[34:14] circle
[34:15] we are not all going to sleep
[34:18] someone is going to stay alive and meet
[34:21] jesus in the air amen the bible says by
[34:24] faith enoch was translated that he shall
[34:27] not see death
[34:28] and was not found because god had
[34:31] translated him
[34:33] why for before his translation he had
[34:37] this testimony
[34:39] which testimony that he pleased
[34:42] how can you please god with our faith
[34:46] because the bible say without faith it
[34:48] is what impossible to please god so
[34:51] there was a certain faith
[34:53] that god had
[34:55] that when god looked at that faith
[34:58] god really admired that faith
[35:02] do you know that faith
[35:04] do you know where it is it
[35:05] do you know in the scripture
[35:07] you know where it is yet
[35:09] it is not in the jewish people
[35:16] one day jesus was coming up
[35:19] and a roman centurion came to him
[35:22] and spoke to him and when he spoke jesus
[35:24] was martha
[35:26] by that faith like wait a minute what
[35:29] kind of faith is this he say not even in
[35:32] israel i have found such a faith the
[35:35] faith of the gentiles amen
[35:37] so it's good to walk with god
[35:40] not just the normal work but a work of
[35:42] faith
[35:43] remember not a humanistic work
[35:46] but you must be in the realms of faith
[35:49] in the realms of revelation that's when
[35:51] things happen hallelujah
[35:54] amen blessed be the name of the lord so
[35:56] continue to remember us in prayer
[35:59] lord willing we will be leaving going to
[36:01] brother church lamb for the meeting

[42:38] i i just was amazed at what the brother
[42:42] kelly and brother steve was sharing
[42:45] and uh this was not in my notes
[42:47] but it was in a bible study that uh
[42:49] teresa and i had the other morning we've
[42:51] been going through the book of
[42:52] thessalonians and if you just turn there
[42:54] for a minute to first thessalonians
[42:56] chapter 4
[42:58] i want to show you something that the
[42:59] lord showed us
[43:00] uh
[43:01] i guess when was this trees last week
[43:04] maybe about two or three days ago we've
[43:06] been through this
[43:08] and so here we see in first
[43:09] thessalonians 4
[43:11] is the rapture is that correct brother
[43:14] verse 13.
[43:15] let's just read that for a minute
[43:18] and then
[43:19] we're going to go back to the beginning
[43:23] that's what we're going back to anyways
[43:25] how many knows that we're going back to
[43:28] are ought to be conditioned
[43:32] god ain't taking nothing away from us
[43:34] except for what we shouldn't had in the
[43:35] beginning
[43:37] god has come to restore to us everything
[43:41] that we had with him when we was in adam
[43:45] in the garden
[43:49] how many knows you were in adam
[43:52] put your hand up if you know you were an
[43:54] adam
[43:55] all right
[43:57] how many knows that you were in christ
[43:58] when he hung on the cross
[44:01] how many knows that brother branham said
[44:04] that you paid for your debt of sin in
[44:06] christ when he was on the cross
[44:13] you were right brother
[44:15] it doesn't take long
[44:20] well
[44:21] i just want to thank
[44:23] excuse me
[44:25] thank my wife she's really precious to
[44:26] me and uh it was um quite a day today
[44:30] you know when you're trying to do
[44:31] something for the lord
[44:33] the apple cart upside down
[44:36] right trees today no matter what we
[44:39] touched it was upside down upside down
[44:41] and so i knew i was on the right track
[44:44] [Laughter]
[44:46] verse 13 it says but i would not have
[44:49] you to be ignorant brethren
[44:52] concerning them which are asleep that
[44:54] yes or not even as others which have no
[44:58] hope
[45:00] for if we believe that jesus died and
[45:03] rose again
[45:05] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[45:09] will god bring with him
[45:11] for this we say unto you
[45:15] by the word of the lord that we which
[45:19] are alive and remain
[45:21] unto the coming of the lord
[45:24] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[45:27] for the lord himself shall descend from
[45:30] heaven with a shout
[45:32] with the voice of an archangel
[45:35] and with the trump of god
[45:37] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[45:40] then we
[45:42] everybody say we
[45:44] which are alive and remain
[45:46] i believe it's that close
[45:49] i believe it's that close
[45:52] do you know that we're being surrounded
[45:54] by rome
[45:56] you the spiritual know what i'm talking
[45:58] about the early disciples when titus
[46:01] came down and surrounded jerusalem they
[46:03] had a word from the lord that it was
[46:05] time to get out of town
[46:07] and i'm telling you we're being
[46:09] surrounded by rome we got a roman
[46:12] catholic president who's in there by
[46:14] fraud
[46:15] all of our of our of our of our supreme
[46:19] court
[46:20] roman catholic
[46:22] we're a protestant nation
[46:24] why is every one of our roman er every
[46:26] one of our supreme court roman catholic
[46:29] and another thing our congress is is a
[46:32] great uh percentage of it is catholic
[46:34] and the ones that aren't catholic belong
[46:37] to the harlot sisters
[46:40] we're being surrounded by rome but our
[46:42] commandment
[46:44] is not to get into the field or run into
[46:46] the mountains
[46:47] our commandment and brother and sister
[46:50] we need to take this very seriously is
[46:52] to get into christ
[46:54] we need to be that's you don't have to
[46:56] be anywhere else but you get into christ
[47:00] it's a full
[47:01] surrender
[47:02] so anyways let me finish this
[47:06] anyway so he says so we're going to
[47:08] gather together them with them in the
[47:09] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[47:12] so shall we ever be with the lord
[47:16] wherefore
[47:17] comfort one another with these words
[47:20] all right now i told you he was gonna go
[47:22] back to the beginning so let's turn to
[47:23] verse 1.
[47:27] he was preparing the thessalonians for
[47:30] the end of the chapter
[47:32] furthermore he says
[47:35] then we beseech you brethren
[47:38] and exhorts you
[47:40] by the lord jesus christ
[47:42] as you have received of us
[47:46] how you ought to walk
[47:49] enoch had a testimony that he
[47:52] walked
[47:53] with god
[47:55] and he was not because god took him
[47:58] and
[47:58] how you ought to walk and to please
[48:02] he walked by faith he pleased god
[48:07] and that got him ready for the
[48:10] so what's paul telling the thessalonians
[48:12] to do
[48:13] walk with god
[48:15] and please him
[48:18] that'll get you ready for the rapture
[48:21] amen
[48:23] i saw that the other day i just about
[48:24] came unglued
[48:26] i said theresa look at this let's turn
[48:28] over to matthew
[48:31] this is a very simple message tonight if
[48:34] anybody's struggling this message is for
[48:36] you
[48:38] because the walk with christ
[48:41] is a very simple walk but we have to
[48:45] know what we're doing
[48:47] we have to know what it is that we're
[48:50] looking for
[48:52] and a lot of times the question goes out
[48:54] to so many people do you have the holy
[48:57] ghost
[48:58] do you have the holy ghost
[49:00] but i believe that the real question
[49:02] that we should be asking ourselves is
[49:04] does the holy ghost
[49:06] have us
[49:08] it was it's his arms wrapped around us
[49:12] he is keeping us
[49:14] and we have to know that we was in his
[49:16] mind before the foundation of the world
[49:19] and origen
[49:26] determines amen amen
[49:32] this is a very very simple you know i
[49:34] believe
[49:36] that um
[49:37] the sermon on the mount
[49:40] is uh is is actually christianity 101
[49:44] you know if
[49:45] christianity 101. and and it's so simple
[49:48] and it's so simple and the thing about
[49:50] christianity is that there's not a
[49:52] christianity 102 103 104. there's
[49:55] christianity 101 and it just gets
[49:58] simpler and simpler and simpler and
[50:00] simpler and don't let anybody
[50:03] ever get you thinking that you have to
[50:06] have a lot of knowledge
[50:08] a lot of education
[50:10] what we need is a walk with god and that
[50:14] by faith
[50:16] and by god's grace that's what we're
[50:18] going to try to get to
[50:21] and so now very simply
[50:25] uh verse
[50:27] verse 28
[50:31] come unto me
[50:33] all ye that labor
[50:36] and are heavy laden
[50:38] and i will
[50:40] give you rest
[50:44] let me read that again don't let these
[50:46] words slip through your mind
[50:48] as they're overly simplistic
[50:51] he said
[50:52] come
[50:53] unto me
[50:55] all ye that labor
[50:57] and are heavy laden
[50:59] and i will give you rest
[51:01] he said take my yoke upon you
[51:04] and learn of me
[51:06] for i am meek
[51:09] and lowly in heart
[51:12] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[51:15] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[51:17] light
[51:18] lord jesus christ we're just here
[51:21] reporting for duty
[51:23] just asking father that you will
[51:26] feed
[51:27] the sheep here tonight with your word
[51:30] make it so digestible may our hearts be
[51:34] lightened may our souls be encouraged
[51:36] and may we know lord god that you have
[51:39] your ever loving arms wrapped around us
[51:42] lord god when they when when when they
[51:45] stretched out your arms you didn't have
[51:47] aaron and and and and her
[51:50] uh holding up that your arms as moses
[51:53] but you made sure they stayed there you
[51:55] let them nail them to the cross father
[51:57] lord so that we could have the victory
[51:59] tonight in christ jesus and so now lord
[52:02] let us learn to appreciate you lord
[52:06] for your meekness for your gentleness
[52:08] and spirit lord and may we as christians
[52:11] realize that we are possessors of the
[52:16] literal life of jesus christ come back
[52:20] upon the believers and we receive that
[52:23] by faith in your word in your promises
[52:27] as did joshua and caleb they just rested
[52:30] in your promises they claimed the
[52:32] possession and they was the only ones to
[52:35] move on into the promised land lord god
[52:38] we just pray that you'll help us lord
[52:40] it's time to turn northward lord it's
[52:42] time lord god to get out of katish
[52:44] barnia it's time lord to move away from
[52:46] the brazen altar it's time to move in
[52:49] past the
[52:50] the inner court lord god and it's time
[52:53] to come into your presence lord and to
[52:55] abide in your presence because in your
[52:57] presence is the fullness of joy lord god
[53:00] and at your right hand with you at our
[53:02] right hand lord god we will never be
[53:05] moved so help us lord jesus we want you
[53:08] lord to have a place in our hearts of
[53:11] authority to where that you can come in
[53:14] and walk down the channels of our
[53:15] attitudes walk into the
[53:18] the the our the conduct in our lives in
[53:21] our character lord and lord when we open
[53:24] the door and let you come in at your
[53:26] bidding father we don't just pull up a
[53:28] chair next to the door and tell you to
[53:30] sit down and be quiet and don't you dare
[53:32] go looking into my closets father we
[53:35] give you permission tonight we open up
[53:38] the channels of our lives walk down the
[53:40] hallways of our of our conduct walk down
[53:43] the hallways of our attitude walk down
[53:46] the hallways of our behavior lord god
[53:48] and lord if you find anything in there
[53:51] that's not pleasing to you father please
[53:53] don't come back and ask us permission
[53:55] father we give you permission to throw
[53:59] it away put it in the trash can as they
[54:02] did with the priests garments they just
[54:04] put it in a trash can why because there
[54:06] was a new garment coming lord jesus and
[54:08] father we just pray tonight lord jesus
[54:11] that you'll take your liberty lord to
[54:13] speak to our hearts and help us to
[54:15] humble ourselves before you lord we ask
[54:18] in jesus name amen and you all can be
[54:21] seated let's turn as you're being seated
[54:24] over to hebrews chapter 10
[54:27] and i'd like to read a short reading
[54:29] here
[54:30] because the way in to the holiest
[54:33] is is there
[54:37] it's there
[54:42] hebrews chapter 10 and let's
[54:45] uh start
[54:51] with verse 16.
[54:53] he said this
[54:55] is the covenant
[54:57] i will make with them after those days
[55:02] saith the lord
[55:04] i will put my law in their hearts
[55:08] and in their minds will i write them
[55:11] their sins
[55:13] and iniquities
[55:15] will i remember no more
[55:18] now friends that's good news
[55:20] that ought to make everybody happy
[55:23] their sins and their iniquities i will
[55:26] remember no more
[55:28] now where the remission of these is
[55:31] there is no more offering for sin
[55:36] look what paul says now
[55:38] having therefore brethren
[55:42] boldness
[55:43] you remember in the old testament
[55:46] that only the high priest could go into
[55:49] the holiest of holies and that once a
[55:52] year
[55:53] and he could he had to go in he
[55:55] sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice on
[55:58] the on the altar and it became a mercy
[56:00] seat and he did that for his sins and
[56:02] the sins of the people and then he had
[56:05] to come back out
[56:07] but friend i don't see anywhere here
[56:10] where paul's telling us to come back out
[56:13] he's telling us to enter in
[56:15] he's not saying come back out
[56:17] friends we are to live brother branham
[56:20] said that there was hardly a day went by
[56:22] in the camp of abraham but but that god
[56:25] didn't come down and make himself known
[56:27] to abraham and to his camp and i'm here
[56:30] to tell you that a
[56:32] young
[56:33] middle-aged old god wants you to walk
[56:37] with him
[56:38] every decision that you make every
[56:41] action that you take it should be in
[56:45] meditated prayer you say can i pray all
[56:47] the time paul said pray without ceasing
[56:54] we're called to live in his presence
[56:58] amen
[56:59] come boldly
[57:01] and how are we going to come in
[57:03] come with boldness
[57:04] and enter into the holiest that's the
[57:07] holiest of holy by what the blood of
[57:11] jesus
[57:12] it's all in
[57:14] jesus
[57:15] he made the way he is the way and the
[57:19] only thing that we have to do is walk in
[57:21] the provided way which was through the
[57:24] shed blood of the innocent one because
[57:27] without the shedding of blood there is
[57:29] no remission of sin but this offering
[57:32] was once and for all and brother branham
[57:36] said in the in the adoption series he
[57:39] said this is where the church is failing
[57:42] they're failing on that walk that every
[57:47] day walking with god
[57:51] so i want to bring to you a little
[57:52] message today
[57:54] tonight by the grace of god
[57:56] let go
[57:58] and let god
[58:00] let go
[58:01] and let god
[58:03] and for a subtitle let's pray
[58:06] i am i am convinced
[58:09] that the way that we're going to
[58:10] maintain this relationship this walking
[58:15] this talking is to have a a a prayer
[58:19] life
[58:20] with god
[58:21] that is not just uh
[58:23] how would we say uh help me get through
[58:26] the day and god bless mommy and god
[58:28] bless daddy this is a this is just an
[58:31] intimate walking and talking it's
[58:34] something when you get up in the morning
[58:36] god is in your mind on your mind when
[58:39] you go to bed at night god is on your
[58:41] mind
[58:42] and and that's where god is trying to
[58:44] get us to
[58:46] and if you go back and you go through
[58:48] the book of acts you'll find out that
[58:50] the disciples the the apostles they were
[58:53] constantly in prayer and there came up a
[58:56] little murmuring between the grecian
[58:58] widows and the hebrew widows and they
[59:01] were murmuring amongst themselves and so
[59:03] then the apostles kept getting pulled
[59:05] away to answer these these simple
[59:07] questions of daily life and that's when
[59:09] they said wait a minute wait a minute we
[59:11] can't take ourselves away from prayer
[59:13] and the word of god just to serve tables
[59:16] and they sought themselves out seven
[59:18] men's and that's how we got the deacons
[59:22] amen
[59:25] so we want to talk about
[59:29] walking
[59:30] talking
[59:33] letting go
[59:34] and letting god
[59:36] i'd like to go to a quote brother
[59:37] branham brought out in the restoration
[59:40] of the bride tree
[59:53] he said now
[1:00:04] now the only way he can work
[1:00:07] is when you let him work
[1:00:10] the only way that god can work is when
[1:00:13] you let him work
[1:00:15] he said
[1:00:16] you've got to believe it
[1:00:18] there's a law now listen to this there's
[1:00:21] a law
[1:00:22] he said there's a law given amongst
[1:00:25] everything
[1:00:26] now listen to this now this is a very
[1:00:28] simple message it's not deep but
[1:00:31] it's for anybody that's struggling to
[1:00:33] live an everyday walk with christ
[1:00:37] there's something that's built into you
[1:00:40] when if you're the child of god
[1:00:43] there is something that's in you that if
[1:00:45] you learn how to control that you or you
[1:00:48] allow it to control you it'll take care
[1:00:51] of every situation that you come into in
[1:00:54] your everyday life
[1:00:58] he says now there's a law
[1:01:00] he said you know the fish
[1:01:02] has a law
[1:01:04] and that fish can stand up here in the
[1:01:05] water and he has a law within him
[1:01:09] if he'll let go of that law
[1:01:12] that's in him he can sink plum to the
[1:01:14] bottom of the sea
[1:01:16] won't bother him a bit
[1:01:18] won't break one cell
[1:01:20] now you try to do that
[1:01:22] any swimmers in here
[1:01:25] i used to like to swim when i was young
[1:01:27] i could only go down so far and you know
[1:01:29] it gets cold once you get down there a
[1:01:31] little bit and it gets really dark
[1:01:33] when you get down there a little bit
[1:01:35] but anyways i couldn't go to the bottom
[1:01:37] and just sit there like a fish
[1:01:39] he said that law is not in you
[1:01:42] you can't do it
[1:01:43] but a fish can
[1:01:45] he deflates himself with that air
[1:01:48] such a way
[1:01:50] that he can there's nothing
[1:01:52] in him to burst open
[1:01:58] technology is good when it works brother
[1:02:00] stephen
[1:02:02] he deflates his there's
[1:02:04] he deflates himself with the air in such
[1:02:06] a way okay and he he made that way he's
[1:02:08] made that way he knows it he can enforce
[1:02:11] that law to take him plumb to the bottom
[1:02:13] of the sea and then raise back up again
[1:02:15] now listen to this
[1:02:17] there's a law in christ
[1:02:21] there is a law in christ
[1:02:24] now listen to what he says next
[1:02:26] that law
[1:02:27] is in men
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:34] did you hear that
[1:02:36] that law is in men
[1:02:38] there's a law in christ that laws men he
[1:02:41] said you can bury him in the deepest
[1:02:42] grave
[1:02:44] or in the deepest sea
[1:02:46] or the lowest hell
[1:02:49] there's a law
[1:02:53] there's a law
[1:02:55] of the spirit of christ that will raise
[1:02:57] him up again
[1:02:59] so we saw the fish
[1:03:01] and we saw christ
[1:03:09] and then he says a bird has a law
[1:03:12] now its body is material it's earthbound
[1:03:16] sets on the earth here
[1:03:18] but it has a law within it
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:21] the way it spreads its wings
[1:03:24] it can fly plum out of sight
[1:03:26] that's against science they claim it's
[1:03:28] an earthbound bird
[1:03:30] gravitation has to hold it
[1:03:32] but it can defy gravitation
[1:03:35] lift itself right off of it and go right
[1:03:39] on out because it has to put that law in
[1:03:43] its
[1:03:44] it has to put that law that's in it to
[1:03:47] work
[1:03:48] let me say it again
[1:03:50] because it has to put that law that's in
[1:03:54] it to work
[1:03:57] now if the bird has to put that law
[1:04:00] that's in it to work
[1:04:03] so that he can fly
[1:04:05] and we know that there's a law in us
[1:04:09] then we have to put that law to work
[1:04:13] no stress
[1:04:15] no worry there's no virtue in worry if
[1:04:18] you find yourself worrying you're not
[1:04:20] exercising that law
[1:04:23] the word of god says cast all your cares
[1:04:27] on me
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] because
[1:04:31] i care for you
[1:04:34] i remember one time i was helping my
[1:04:36] friend do tree work
[1:04:38] and his wife is just a thin framed woman
[1:04:40] brother steve and i don't guess what she
[1:04:42] weigh about 95 pounds teresa
[1:04:44] and but yet she pulls tree limbs she she
[1:04:47] she can handle a chainsaw
[1:04:50] i'm telling you this girl's she's a
[1:04:51] rugged little girl
[1:04:53] and she was pulling this great big limb
[1:04:55] brother stephen and she was just
[1:04:57] and i walked up to her and i said i said
[1:05:00] do you want me to pull that for you
[1:05:02] and she said i got i got i said now look
[1:05:05] i said you can carry that load if you
[1:05:07] want to
[1:05:08] but if you want i'll carry it for you
[1:05:13] and that's what the holy ghost does with
[1:05:15] us
[1:05:16] do you want to carry your burdens
[1:05:18] do you want to carry your anxieties do
[1:05:20] you want to carry your trepidations and
[1:05:22] your fears or you just want to give them
[1:05:24] over to him
[1:05:26] amen this is what walking and talking
[1:05:30] with god does for the believer
[1:05:33] we learn it's a law that we have to
[1:05:36] learn
[1:05:37] let me tell you something saints of god
[1:05:40] we carry a lot of stress on us that we
[1:05:43] don't have to carry
[1:05:45] god doesn't want his children he wants
[1:05:48] us to be able to go
[1:05:50] into the fiery furnace without any fear
[1:05:53] he wants us to be able to go into a den
[1:05:55] of hungry lions and know that he's there
[1:05:58] we we just pick up the see the the
[1:06:00] hebrew children live by that law
[1:06:03] and that's the reason that they was able
[1:06:04] to stand there and tell the king we know
[1:06:07] our god is able but whether he delivers
[1:06:09] us from this furnace or he doesn't
[1:06:12] deliver us from this furnace the one
[1:06:13] thing we know is that we're not going to
[1:06:16] bow down to your image why why why
[1:06:19] because that would break the law of god
[1:06:21] and we're not going to break the law of
[1:06:23] god we would rather just die
[1:06:25] in this fire than to break the law of
[1:06:27] god
[1:06:29] remember esther when she went in before
[1:06:31] the king
[1:06:33] she said if i die i die
[1:06:36] but to this end i was born
[1:06:39] and so she she went in before the king
[1:06:42] and if he hadn't held out that golden
[1:06:44] scepter it meant her life but she was
[1:06:47] determined that she was not going to
[1:06:49] break the law of god she wasn't going to
[1:06:52] be subdued by fear she wasn't going to
[1:06:55] be subsumed by anxiety i want to tell
[1:06:58] you something brothers and sisters when
[1:07:00] you get to walking with the holy ghost
[1:07:02] the way the holy ghost wants to walk
[1:07:04] with you satan has no
[1:07:06] power over you as a matter of fact
[1:07:09] brother branham said that he will become
[1:07:11] as powerless when you get the revelation
[1:07:14] that you can do the greater works
[1:07:17] amen and you know that there's two
[1:07:19] spirits that's working in the framework
[1:07:20] of the christian church
[1:07:22] and by god's spirit
[1:07:25] you discern
[1:07:26] and you withstand the evil spirit
[1:07:29] then satan is going to be completely
[1:07:31] powerless before us that's a law of god
[1:07:35] but we have to do what it says and we
[1:07:39] take the spirit of god
[1:07:41] which is the word of god and the word of
[1:07:44] god is the discerner of the thought and
[1:07:46] the intent of the heart and when you
[1:07:48] discern a bad spirit you you withstand
[1:07:51] it but you don't withstand it with
[1:07:54] vengeance and bitterness and wrath and
[1:07:57] anger you exercise the law of god and
[1:08:01] the law of god is love and with divine
[1:08:05] love and feeling in your heart for the
[1:08:08] most aggravating soul that ever comes
[1:08:12] against you
[1:08:13] and you pray for that man's soul so that
[1:08:16] he too can understand the law of god and
[1:08:19] be saved now we know there's only a
[1:08:21] certain certain seed that can be saved
[1:08:24] but we pray for all men
[1:08:26] irregardless
[1:08:28] so now this there was a law
[1:08:31] there's a law in this bird
[1:08:33] and he says now he says he has to know
[1:08:36] how to operate that law
[1:08:38] and it's built to he's built to possess
[1:08:41] that law and brother brahm says well i'm
[1:08:43] feeling religious
[1:08:44] he says now we have a law he said we
[1:08:47] have a law and the law of life is in us
[1:08:51] you remember what paul said he was
[1:08:53] sitting there struggling in romans 7 and
[1:08:55] he said the things that i would do i
[1:08:57] find myself not doing and the things
[1:08:58] that i don't want to do i find myself
[1:09:00] doing and he said oh oh wretched man
[1:09:05] that i am he said who's going to deliver
[1:09:07] me from the body of this death he said i
[1:09:10] thank god through jesus christ what did
[1:09:13] he do he came into the holiest of holies
[1:09:16] sprinkling the blood of jesus christ on
[1:09:19] the mercy seat he said so then with my
[1:09:21] mind i serve the law of god but with my
[1:09:25] flesh i serve the law of sin and one of
[1:09:27] the greatest understandings that you
[1:09:29] will have is that no matter how close
[1:09:32] you get to god your flesh is still going
[1:09:34] to be sticky and your flesh has got to
[1:09:37] be kept in control that's why paul told
[1:09:40] the romans in romans 6 16 he said that
[1:09:43] to whom you yield your remembered
[1:09:45] servants to obey he said his servants
[1:09:48] you are whether it be obedience under
[1:09:50] life or or or sin unto death
[1:09:54] those two laws are still with us the law
[1:09:56] of sin and death but what did he do he
[1:09:58] went on hallelujah and he broke into
[1:10:01] romans chapter 8 and he said the law of
[1:10:04] the spirit
[1:10:06] of life in jesus christ
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:12] i stole that hive from brother kelly
[1:10:17] i'm sorry brother kelly
[1:10:19] they say imitation
[1:10:20] they say they say they say imitation is
[1:10:23] the sincerest form of flattery
[1:10:26] [Laughter]
[1:10:27] oh that's all good i started i'm
[1:10:29] starting to feel religious myself
[1:10:32] the law of the spirit listen to this
[1:10:35] the law of the spirit of the life in
[1:10:37] christ jesus has made us free
[1:10:44] is that right
[1:10:45] is this right
[1:10:47] and he whom the son
[1:10:49] has made free
[1:10:51] is free
[1:10:52] do you see the law
[1:10:54] the law of the spirit this is the life
[1:10:56] that's in us it's a resurrection
[1:10:59] and it's in you you don't have to knock
[1:11:02] down to the devil you don't have to give
[1:11:05] in to fear you don't have to give in to
[1:11:08] anxieties somebody comes along and says
[1:11:10] you've got stage four cancer i want to
[1:11:12] tell you something brothers and sisters
[1:11:15] if you're walking with god every day of

[1:13:10] testimonies to spread around the world

[1:13:15] in six weeks
[1:13:19] let me tell you some saints of god when
[1:13:21] you operate this law that's in you
[1:13:24] it's in you just like a bird can spread
[1:13:26] its wings and defy the law of gravity i
[1:13:30] want to tell you something you can
[1:13:31] spread your wings of faith and you can
[1:13:33] defy the law hallelujah of sin and death
[1:13:37] it has no more power over you

[1:13:44] and i want to tell you something saints
[1:13:46] it makes you live holy
[1:13:49] all your desires

[1:13:56] second thessalonians or uh
[1:13:58] second first thessalonians chapter four
[1:14:01] the rapture chapter he's talking about
[1:14:02] getting rid of all the the nonsense and
[1:14:05] possessing your vessels and
[1:14:07] sanctification
[1:14:10] this is not a dirty god we're servant
[1:14:12] we're serving a holy god and i want to
[1:14:14] tell you something we have permission by
[1:14:16] the blood of jesus christ to enter into
[1:14:19] the holiest of holies but brother don't
[1:14:21] go in there with a filthy spirit
[1:14:29] he set us free
[1:14:31] we're free
[1:14:32] we're free we're no longer bound
[1:14:35] now he says i'm starting to feel
[1:14:36] religious
[1:14:37] the only thing you have to do
[1:14:40] now listen carefully these words these
[1:14:42] are powerful
[1:14:44] powerful words
[1:14:46] and i want to tell you something i love
[1:14:48] this prophet
[1:14:50] i love this prophet
[1:14:53] i want to tell you something you know
[1:14:54] what i feel bad for i feel sorry for
[1:14:57] people who have walked away from this
[1:14:58] message
[1:14:59] i really do
[1:15:01] i pray i pray that if there's now
[1:15:03] there's some that's walked away i don't
[1:15:05] think there's any hope for them that
[1:15:07] they've crossed the line
[1:15:08] but i do believe that there are some
[1:15:11] that have followed their bad example
[1:15:14] and those are the ones i pray for
[1:15:17] my heart is yearning for those seeds i
[1:15:19] want those brothers to see the error of
[1:15:22] their way and i don't ever want to lose
[1:15:24] that burden because i believe that
[1:15:26] there's some good people that have
[1:15:29] turned away from this message and all
[1:15:31] they need to do is get turned back
[1:15:32] around and they're going to be all right
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:37] hallelujah so pray with me on that i
[1:15:39] pray for a lot of them dear souls
[1:15:42] because i
[1:15:43] and sometimes you don't know who is and
[1:15:44] who isn't
[1:15:46] but we pray for him and we believe
[1:15:48] so he says here
[1:15:51] he says
[1:15:52] um let me catch my point here he said
[1:15:54] you're you are made
[1:15:57] and born
[1:15:58] and placed here
[1:16:00] the body of christ
[1:16:02] as sons and daughters of god
[1:16:04] you don't have to knock down to the
[1:16:08] devil there
[1:16:10] that's what he said i was i was just
[1:16:12] saying what he said
[1:16:14] you don't have to knock down to the
[1:16:16] devil we've got a law and that's the law
[1:16:19] of the holy spirit
[1:16:21] the only thing you know only thing you
[1:16:23] have to do
[1:16:24] the only thing you have to do
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:28] is to know how to let go
[1:16:31] and let god now listen to this as
[1:16:33] brother steven's been saying
[1:16:35] take your car off the steering wheel and
[1:16:38] put the car in neutral
[1:16:40] my son's got this saying whenever he
[1:16:42] gets in a bit of a pinch he says oh
[1:16:44] jesus take the wheel
[1:16:48] yeah
[1:16:49] he said jesus take the wheel i looked at
[1:16:51] him i said what'd you take the wheel
[1:16:52] from him for to begin with
[1:16:54] you didn't have no business taking out
[1:16:56] his thing to begin with
[1:16:57] if you hadn't took it out of his hands
[1:16:59] you wouldn't be able to ask him to take
[1:17:00] it back
[1:17:05] and maybe he'll listen to this tape
[1:17:11] you don't have to knock down to the
[1:17:13] devil we got a law
[1:17:15] that's the law of the holy ghost the
[1:17:17] only thing you have to know how to do is
[1:17:18] let go and let god
[1:17:20] you keep fighting at it see
[1:17:23] and it won't never work
[1:17:25] when you let go and let god that's all
[1:17:28] if the fish say wait i'll catch my
[1:17:30] breath uh uh real good and i'll breathe
[1:17:34] up a little bit auction and see if i can
[1:17:36] go down no
[1:17:37] he does that and he'll burst open see
[1:17:40] because he doesn't work on a human law
[1:17:43] in order for me to go down i gotta suck
[1:17:45] all the air and i can and then you gotta
[1:17:47] swim twice as hard because now you're
[1:17:48] trying to pull yourself down with all
[1:17:49] that air inside your lungs so you learn
[1:17:52] how to let it out a little bit of time
[1:17:53] as you go down you know what i'm talking
[1:17:55] about brother kelly
[1:17:56] but that's the way a human does it but
[1:17:58] fishes don't do it that way they got
[1:18:00] another law they live by you see and the
[1:18:02] birds they got another law they live by
[1:18:05] but i'm here to tell you the rest of
[1:18:07] that story
[1:18:08] because we living underneath the
[1:18:10] anointing of the mighty eagle
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] and i want to tell you something all we
[1:18:18] have to do is set our faith
[1:18:22] old testament
[1:18:24] set our faith
[1:18:27] new testament
[1:18:28] and then
[1:18:29] don't turn your back to the wind
[1:18:33] you just face the wind
[1:18:43] so we got into a bible study the other
[1:18:45] day in the living room we have a good
[1:18:46] time in our living room
[1:18:50] don't worry trees
[1:18:52] we have a great time in our living room
[1:18:53] now look remember we were talking he was
[1:18:55] talking the other day about congress
[1:18:56] used to have a chair for god to sit in
[1:18:59] okay well my chair is on on this side of
[1:19:01] the room
[1:19:03] on the other side of the room and
[1:19:04] there's an empty chair right there
[1:19:07] and i've told her many times i said
[1:19:09] teresa i didn't have any of that on my
[1:19:11] mind when we sat down here to talk about
[1:19:13] him i said he's here in this room and
[1:19:16] he's talking to us
[1:19:19] and she's a hungry little soul because i
[1:19:21] want to tell you something when she
[1:19:22] starts to pulling on side of me and
[1:19:24] stuff starts pouring out of me and i'm
[1:19:26] thinking where did all of this come from
[1:19:29] it's just those springs that jesus said
[1:19:31] will be bubbling up and they asked the
[1:19:33] little brain they said what bubbles use
[1:19:35] it because i'm drinking premium he says
[1:19:37] no there's just something that's
[1:19:38] bubbling me
[1:19:40] it's a law saints and we got this law of
[1:19:43] the eagle now look the holy spirit
[1:19:46] is here to take care of every problem
[1:19:49] that you have
[1:19:50] and the law of the spirit of the life in
[1:19:53] christ jesus has made us free from the
[1:19:56] law of sin and death
[1:20:01] where did the law of sin and death get
[1:20:03] started
[1:20:07] where did the lost and death get started
[1:20:11] the day you eat thereof
[1:20:14] that day
[1:20:15] you shall surely die and to eat of it
[1:20:19] she had to disbelieve god's word
[1:20:22] and sin is to disbelieve god's word
[1:20:26] and because that she disbelieved god's
[1:20:28] word
[1:20:29] she walked away from life and the only
[1:20:32] thing left was death
[1:20:34] and from that day the day you shall
[1:20:36] surely die somebody says well adam and
[1:20:39] eve didn't die on that day well i beg
[1:20:41] your pardon the bible says that one day
[1:20:43] with god is as a thousand years with man
[1:20:45] and a thousand years with man is one day
[1:20:47] with god and the oldest man that ever
[1:20:49] lived was methuselah and he was 969
[1:20:52] years so then not one man has ever lived
[1:20:55] a full god day
[1:20:57] not one man he keeps his word he knows
[1:21:00] what he's talking about and i want to
[1:21:02] tell you something when you think
[1:21:03] brother branham said something that
[1:21:04] ain't in the bible i just want to tell
[1:21:06] you you just keep on looking because
[1:21:08] it's in there
[1:21:10] amen and if you have trouble finding it
[1:21:12] come find brother shimbo because he's
[1:21:13] got a quote
[1:21:18] i tell you that brother got a quote
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] but there's one thing that brother won't
[1:21:24] do
[1:21:25] he won't make a quote up
[1:21:27] when he says he got a quote he got a
[1:21:29] quote
[1:21:30] and he'll bring it to you and if you
[1:21:32] could hear what the quote says
[1:21:36] and you can align it with the word
[1:21:39] now we're talking about rest
[1:21:41] we're talking about resting in his
[1:21:42] promises
[1:21:44] now i want to show you something here
[1:21:47] over in isaiah 28
[1:21:50] it says line
[1:21:54] okay
[1:21:56] how many points does it take to make a
[1:21:58] line
[1:22:00] how do you get this thing
[1:22:04] i always wanted i wanted to do this
[1:22:06] i knew there'd be something in my
[1:22:08] service i just had to come over here to
[1:22:10] the board
[1:22:11] you know
[1:22:13] i just line
[1:22:16] up online you say brother sam you're
[1:22:18] just putting a bunch of dots up there
[1:22:20] it takes at least two
[1:22:22] dots to make a line
[1:22:24] right
[1:22:26] anybody and remember they're how about
[1:22:29] some of you younger ones
[1:22:30] is that right it takes two dots to make
[1:22:32] a line
[1:22:34] two points two points at least two
[1:22:36] points you don't have a line if you
[1:22:37] don't have two points
[1:22:39] if you just gotta
[1:22:41] that's why we know baptism in the name
[1:22:43] of the father son holy ghost isn't any
[1:22:45] it isn't a revelation because it's only
[1:22:48] once in the bible that's just one point
[1:22:51] but now you take baptism name of jesus
[1:22:53] christ you got point on point on point
[1:22:56] on point and it just keeps on going we
[1:22:58] still baptizing that way on out into
[1:23:01] eternity but look this is what i'm
[1:23:04] trying to show you here a line upon line
[1:23:08] lying upon line
[1:23:10] precept upon precept here a little and
[1:23:13] there a little and he said this is the
[1:23:17] rests
[1:23:18] this is rest come unto me all ye that
[1:23:21] labor and are heavy laden and you shall
[1:23:24] find rest unto your
[1:23:26] souls
[1:23:28] that's right
[1:23:29] so so when we can see the word of god
[1:23:33] lined up
[1:23:35] genesis
[1:23:38] all the way to revelations
[1:23:42] revelations 10
[1:23:45] 1
[1:23:47] seven
[1:23:48] what was it
[1:23:49] eight
[1:23:50] eleven
[1:23:52] see
[1:23:53] down here we're eating the book
[1:23:56] we're eating the book down there
[1:23:59] but there's a desperation that has to
[1:24:01] come into our souls and you know what
[1:24:03] brother branham said the reason that we
[1:24:05] lack desperation
[1:24:07] he says it's because we lack love
[1:24:10] we lack love
[1:24:11] and we need to have more uh
[1:24:14] intimate close
[1:24:16] relationship
[1:24:18] with this god of love
[1:24:21] i told i was telling teresa the other
[1:24:22] day the closer i get to god the richer
[1:24:25] my love for her gets
[1:24:28] the more i i want her to be happy
[1:24:33] i i don't care if i'm happy it doesn't
[1:24:35] matter
[1:24:36] if we go out to eat if i can't eat at my
[1:24:38] restaurant it doesn't matter i want her
[1:24:41] to be happy and i want to tell you
[1:24:44] something that's exactly what christ
[1:24:46] love is for us because the evidence that
[1:24:50] i love my wife that way is that's the
[1:24:52] evidence that christ loves us the way i
[1:24:55] love her because he said
[1:24:57] husbands love your wives as christ loved
[1:25:01] the church and gave himself for it
[1:25:07] was that in your class with the young
[1:25:08] men
[1:25:14] you know you don't have to say so that's
[1:25:16] all right
[1:25:17] i think it was
[1:25:19] i think it was
[1:25:21] it has to be but you know what i like
[1:25:23] about brother shambo
[1:25:24] now brother stephen
[1:25:27] yes
[1:25:29] and i used to think it was just his
[1:25:30] african way of talk you know
[1:25:33] take take take revelations 10.
[1:25:35] take
[1:25:36] take
[1:25:37] take matthew chapter five take
[1:25:41] i thought that was just something that
[1:25:43] they did in africa or something like
[1:25:44] that i never ever heard anybody say take
[1:25:47] take take take this scripture take
[1:25:49] but he's saying take the book
[1:25:51] he's saying take it
[1:25:52] take the book and when you take the book
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:00] see you're forgetting
[1:26:03] that when he's speaking up here it's not
[1:26:05] him
[1:26:06] speaking he'll tell you that
[1:26:09] it's the holy spirit that gives him an
[1:26:12] utterance
[1:26:13] and it's because jesus christ
[1:26:17] now look it
[1:26:18] take this the right way
[1:26:21] but we can understand all the mysteries
[1:26:24] paul said this
[1:26:26] and if we don't have charity
[1:26:29] it profits us nothing
[1:26:32] nothing
[1:26:33] so with all of our getting
[1:26:35] let's not forget the main thing
[1:26:38] the main thing is the literal life of
[1:26:41] jesus christ which is the love of god
[1:26:44] come back upon the believers and i'll
[1:26:46] never forget how many times i've talked
[1:26:49] to theresa and i said honey i don't i
[1:26:52] i'm glad for the victories that god has
[1:26:54] given us and i'm glad that i like that
[1:26:56] woman said she says i thank god she said
[1:26:59] i want to give us a testimony she says i
[1:27:01] praise the lord she says i ain't what i
[1:27:03] want to be but i thank god i'm not what
[1:27:05] i used to be and that's the way i feel
[1:27:07] about it but i'm not satisfied
[1:27:11] i am not satisfied with just
[1:27:15] little victories in my life
[1:27:17] i am not going to be happy my brothers
[1:27:20] and sisters until i look into the mirror
[1:27:26] of god's word
[1:27:28] and i'm like that little boy
[1:27:30] that came up out of the country remember
[1:27:32] brother brown talked about that
[1:27:34] talked about the little boy come up out
[1:27:35] of the country and he did he didn't know
[1:27:37] what a mirror was
[1:27:39] and he was walking through his grandma's
[1:27:40] hallway there and she had a full-length
[1:27:43] mirror
[1:27:44] and she come up there and
[1:27:46] he started looking and he saw a little
[1:27:48] boy in there
[1:27:49] and he waved his hand the little boy
[1:27:51] waved his name
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:53] and he shook his head
[1:27:55] and the little boy shook his head
[1:27:57] and then he turned around and said mama
[1:27:59] that's me
[1:28:01] that's me
[1:28:02] and what i want to do is i want to look
[1:28:04] into the life of jesus christ
[1:28:08] i'm not talking about the have my hair
[1:28:10] the way his hair is but i want my
[1:28:12] conduct i want my character i want my
[1:28:15] behavior do you know something that in
[1:28:18] this holy ghost in this law that we have
[1:28:21] we've been given fruit and jesus didn't
[1:28:24] just give us any kind of a fruit he said
[1:28:26] my peace i give unto you
[1:28:28] he said my joy i give unto you and paul
[1:28:31] said this over in galatians chapter 2
[1:28:34] and verse 20 he said i'm crucified with
[1:28:37] christ
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:41] now does anybody know what it means when
[1:28:43] somebody's crucified
[1:28:47] one by one give it a stab a try
[1:28:49] what does it mean if somebody's
[1:28:50] crucified
[1:28:52] it means they're dead
[1:28:54] they're dead
[1:28:55] somebody that's crucified is dead
[1:28:58] right
[1:29:01] but he said yet i live
[1:29:04] he said i'm crucified with christ
[1:29:06] yet i live
[1:29:08] but the life i now live
[1:29:12] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:29:16] the life that he was living on isaac was
[1:29:19] not that his faith it was the faith of
[1:29:22] jesus christ because he had the life of
[1:29:25] jesus christ came back upon him
[1:29:31] and that's what the holy spirit is
[1:29:33] you have his love you have his joy you
[1:29:36] have his peace
[1:29:42] now the the struggle that we have
[1:29:46] is that
[1:29:48] each of us have our own will it's called
[1:29:50] self-will jesus had his own will
[1:29:54] and what did jesus do when he
[1:29:56] surrendered his will to the father
[1:30:00] he prayed
[1:30:01] sincerely
[1:30:03] for three
[1:30:04] hours he prayed he went away for an hour
[1:30:08] he come back he found his disciples
[1:30:10] sleeping
[1:30:11] and what was his prayer
[1:30:12] nevertheless
[1:30:14] not my will but thy will be done
[1:30:18] what time are we supposed to be finished
[1:30:20] brother shambo
[1:30:23] i'm just i'm just enjoying myself
[1:30:28] he said
[1:30:29] and then he come back again
[1:30:31] and he he went out and he prayed and he
[1:30:34] said father if it be possible
[1:30:38] let this cup pass from me
[1:30:40] but nevertheless not my will but thy
[1:30:43] will be done
[1:30:45] now he did that three times and if jesus
[1:30:49] was that sincere in his prayer to
[1:30:52] surrender his will to the father then i
[1:30:55] just want to ask you a question how much
[1:30:57] more sincere must we be
[1:30:59] let's go over to the book of jude amen
[1:31:04] it's only got one chapter
[1:31:07] and
[1:31:10] i'll find it i don't think i wrote it
[1:31:12] down
[1:31:14] let me get there
[1:31:16] jude
[1:31:26] down there in verse 20.
[1:31:30] he says but you beloved
[1:31:36] let me just stop there
[1:31:38] this word beloved
[1:31:41] this is not just a word that he uses for
[1:31:43] any whole body
[1:31:46] this word beloved you know what the
[1:31:47] greek word for beloved is
[1:31:51] it's agapeto
[1:31:53] you take the word agapo
[1:31:56] it's agape my dearly beloved one
[1:32:01] and that's what you are in the eyes of
[1:32:02] god
[1:32:03] you're a cherished
[1:32:05] child of god
[1:32:07] he knows he watches for when you wake up
[1:32:09] in the morning
[1:32:11] because he wants you to be smiling
[1:32:14] he said but she beloved bri building up
[1:32:17] your
[1:32:18] selves
[1:32:20] on your most
[1:32:22] holy
[1:32:23] faith
[1:32:25] praying in the holy ghost
[1:32:29] keep yourselves
[1:32:31] in the love of god
[1:32:33] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[1:32:35] christ unto eternal life
[1:32:38] now let's turn back over to matthew
[1:32:41] and the sixth chapter
[1:32:45] he said building up
[1:32:47] yourselves in your most holy faith
[1:32:50] praying
[1:32:51] in the holy spirit
[1:32:56] in matthew chapter 6
[1:32:58] and verse 7
[1:33:01] jesus is teaching us
[1:33:02] he says and when you pray
[1:33:05] use not vain repetitions as the heathens
[1:33:08] do
[1:33:09] for they think they shall be heard for
[1:33:10] much speaking
[1:33:13] be not like unto them
[1:33:14] now listen your father
[1:33:18] your father
[1:33:19] knows what things you have need of
[1:33:22] before you ask
[1:33:24] now let's watch this
[1:33:26] how in this prayer
[1:33:28] jesus teaches us
[1:33:30] to bring our will
[1:33:32] subject
[1:33:33] to the father
[1:33:35] okay
[1:33:36] that's what this prayer is all about and
[1:33:39] this prayer
[1:33:41] if you can get alone in a closet
[1:33:44] you know why jesus told us to go into a
[1:33:46] closet
[1:33:47] because when you're alone in the closet
[1:33:49] you've already cut off five of your
[1:33:51] senses that can interfere with you
[1:33:53] you can't see anything you can't taste
[1:33:56] anything you can feel anything but but
[1:33:58] that isn't gonna hinder you you see
[1:34:00] you're cutting off you're cutting
[1:34:02] yourself off and this is what we need to
[1:34:05] do that's why just i mean i pray when
[1:34:07] i'm going down the road i pray when i'm
[1:34:10] on the job i pray when i'm when i'm
[1:34:12] mowing the yard because the bible says
[1:34:14] pray without ceasing but there's that
[1:34:17] time where you just set aside and
[1:34:20] brother branham said the problem of it
[1:34:22] is is so many times we do all the
[1:34:25] talking
[1:34:26] and he says we don't do any listening
[1:34:30] when when jude is talking about building
[1:34:32] up your most holy uh faith in the
[1:34:35] praying in the holy ghost he's talking
[1:34:37] about when you isolate your soul
[1:34:41] you isolate your soul and so let me show
[1:34:44] you what happens so you get down before
[1:34:46] you're before the lord in your closet
[1:34:48] you close the door behind you it's quiet
[1:34:51] there's nothing can disturb you you you
[1:34:53] got the phone turned off you told your
[1:34:56] wife look honey i'm going to be gone for
[1:34:57] a little bit i'm going to talk to papa
[1:34:59] god
[1:35:01] i'll i like han and papa gone
[1:35:03] you know the value of real estate is
[1:35:05] based on location location location
[1:35:09] the value of your relationship with god
[1:35:11] is your
[1:35:12] relationship your relationship your
[1:35:15] relationship
[1:35:16] if to you he's a big fierce monster that
[1:35:19] wants to squash you every time you make
[1:35:21] a mistake
[1:35:22] you're not gonna have a very intimate
[1:35:24] relationship with that guy
[1:35:26] but boy when you see him as papa god
[1:35:29] when you see somebody you can go to and
[1:35:31] he hears you
[1:35:33] do you know what he said he loves you so
[1:35:35] much
[1:35:36] this is
[1:35:38] it boggles my mind
[1:35:39] satan's got to be good at what he does
[1:35:42] boggles my mind
[1:35:43] how can satan convince
[1:35:46] people that a god of love wants to
[1:35:49] squash him
[1:35:51] you know even if you go back in
[1:35:53] in the old testament when when god was
[1:35:56] given moses the law
[1:35:58] and he introduced himself he said that
[1:36:01] he was a god that was plenteous in mercy
[1:36:03] and gracious
[1:36:05] and kind
[1:36:06] and tenderhearted as he was giving him
[1:36:09] the the ten commandments
[1:36:11] written in the stones
[1:36:13] where was i at
[1:36:16] where was i at help me out here
[1:36:19] matthew 6 7.
[1:36:21] yes
[1:36:22] so yeah i know where i was at thank you
[1:36:24] brother
[1:36:25] that pulled me back on track
[1:36:26] and so so now you're alone now you got
[1:36:29] your five senses they're they're they're
[1:36:31] they so they can't interfere with you
[1:36:33] you're in a dark room it's quiet you're
[1:36:36] all by yourself your eyes are closed but
[1:36:39] then what happens
[1:36:40] then your your reasoning starts to work
[1:36:43] and your imagination starts to work and
[1:36:45] you start memorizing your memory starts
[1:36:48] kicking in all those five senses that
[1:36:51] contact your spirit realm
[1:36:53] and it's hard to block them things out
[1:36:55] because they're just there and so the
[1:36:57] other morning i got up to pray and i
[1:37:00] wanted to pray i want to get my my soul
[1:37:03] i want to get my soul isolated with god
[1:37:05] i didn't want my my my
[1:37:08] my
[1:37:09] five senses of the flesh to interfere
[1:37:11] and i didn't want the five senses of my
[1:37:13] spirit to interfere because there's only
[1:37:15] one sense there's only this is why we
[1:37:18] have to build up our most holy faith
[1:37:20] when we're praying because there's only
[1:37:21] one sense oh my god that will contact
[1:37:24] god that will put you in this
[1:37:26] relationship with god that you can refer
[1:37:29] to him as your papa god
[1:37:31] you don't like and he's watching over
[1:37:33] you and he wants you to cast all your
[1:37:35] cares on him because he cares for you
[1:37:38] and all you have to do is learn how to
[1:37:40] operate that law that's already in you
[1:37:44] and so i was there and i was starting to
[1:37:46] pray and all of a sudden
[1:37:48] oh
[1:37:49] this imagination was coming up and that
[1:37:52] imagination was coming up and it was so
[1:37:54] much interference and i thought i just
[1:37:56] wasn't going to be able to get isolated
[1:37:58] alone with god and i wanted just uh i
[1:38:01] just wanted to spend some time i wanted
[1:38:02] my soul
[1:38:04] to bask in his presence because in his
[1:38:07] presence brother stephen it's the
[1:38:08] fullness of children
[1:38:11] and i don't have a hangover i don't i
[1:38:14] get addicted but it's to him
[1:38:18] and so you know what i did i said devil
[1:38:21] i i did i said devil i know you're here
[1:38:24] and i said i'm going to talk to god
[1:38:27] and i said if you want to pray with me i
[1:38:29] said there's room right here
[1:38:31] i said just pull yourself get down here
[1:38:33] on your knees and i said we'll pray
[1:38:35] together
[1:38:36] now i'll pray for a little while i'll
[1:38:38] listen you pray for a little while you
[1:38:39] know what it wasn't too long i was alone
[1:38:41] with god
[1:38:42] i was all alone with god he didn't want
[1:38:44] none of that
[1:38:45] he didn't want not because i was going
[1:38:47] to pray whether he was going to stay
[1:38:48] there or not
[1:38:51] now let me give
[1:38:52] one
[1:38:53] last
[1:38:55] uh
[1:38:56] a bit here
[1:38:58] before we close
[1:39:03] sometimes i'll get up to pray
[1:39:06] and usually it's early in the morning
[1:39:08] about two
[1:39:10] one thirty two o'clock i get up to pray
[1:39:13] i want to tell you something that's a
[1:39:14] good time to pray
[1:39:16] all the devils have gone to sleep
[1:39:20] and i got up and i went out in the
[1:39:22] living room and i got down on my knees
[1:39:24] where i normally pray
[1:39:28] brother stephen i couldn't feel nothing
[1:39:31] it's just like i thought what am i doing
[1:39:34] i said
[1:39:36] i don't feel god
[1:39:38] god's not here i said i'm gonna get down
[1:39:41] on my knees what am i doing talk to the
[1:39:42] couch
[1:39:43] you know do you ever get just you just
[1:39:45] feel like you're all by yourself
[1:39:49] and then
[1:39:50] just like that
[1:39:52] now listen this is very important
[1:39:55] because this is walking by faith
[1:39:58] this is what faith in god's word will do
[1:40:00] for you
[1:40:02] now i couldn't feel him
[1:40:04] i felt like there was nothing in the
[1:40:06] room
[1:40:07] but i remembered in his word
[1:40:10] and in his word he said i will never
[1:40:12] leave you
[1:40:14] and i'll never forsake you
[1:40:16] and i said devil you're a liar
[1:40:18] you're trying to contend tell him tell
[1:40:20] me because i can't feel him in my spirit
[1:40:22] or i can't feel him in my my senses that
[1:40:25] he's not here
[1:40:27] but i've got his word and he said that
[1:40:29] he'll never leave me and he'll never
[1:40:31] forsake me and so i started to pray and
[1:40:34] i had one of the best times of prayer
[1:40:37] with god that i've ever had in my life
[1:40:39] but if i would have just given him
[1:40:41] because it couldn't feel him i couldn't
[1:40:43] sense him it just didn't feel like he
[1:40:44] was there there was nothing there see
[1:40:46] it's walking by faith
[1:40:49] and when we can rest he said come unto
[1:40:52] me all you that labor and are heavy
[1:40:54] laden and you shall find rests
[1:40:58] rest unto your soul and so let's say
[1:41:00] that you're going through your day and
[1:41:02] you're starting to go into a hard hard
[1:41:04] trial do you know what the bible says
[1:41:06] about the hebrew children it said that
[1:41:08] they did not enter into his rest though
[1:41:12] the works were finished from the
[1:41:14] foundation of the world because when the
[1:41:16] word was preached it wasn't mixed with
[1:41:19] faith
[1:41:21] they didn't have any faith in it and
[1:41:23] therefore because they didn't have any
[1:41:25] faith in it it didn't do many good they
[1:41:27] never could rest on his promises
[1:41:30] but when you come up against the problem
[1:41:33] it just seems like like today it just
[1:41:34] seemed like everything that theresa and
[1:41:36] i tried to do it just seemed like it
[1:41:38] just went upside down
[1:41:39] and so it would have been very easy for
[1:41:42] us just to get discouraged and say well
[1:41:43] not i don't maybe maybe some something's
[1:41:46] wrong here
[1:41:47] but god left us great and precious
[1:41:50] promises
[1:41:51] and peter taught us it's by these great
[1:41:54] and precious promises
[1:41:57] that we become partakers
[1:42:00] of his
[1:42:01] divine
[1:42:03] nature
[1:42:06] but if we don't believe what the bible
[1:42:09] says
[1:42:10] we will never become a partaker of his
[1:42:13] divine nature he wants you to have his
[1:42:16] peace he wants you to have his joy he
[1:42:19] wants you to have the love of god in
[1:42:23] your heart not just a little bit of love
[1:42:26] but he wants you to have passionate love
[1:42:29] and he wants you to be able to look in
[1:42:31] the most impossible situations and still
[1:42:35] be able to believe his word and how do
[1:42:38] you do it you do it by faith and i'm
[1:42:41] going to tell you something here saints
[1:42:43] that we're going to take the rapture the
[1:42:45] same way that we overcome a common cold
[1:42:48] just by simple
[1:42:50] faith in what god said god's the one
[1:42:54] that said this mortality will put on
[1:42:56] immortality
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:42:59] god's the one that said this corruptible
[1:43:01] will put on incorruption
[1:43:04] now if we're alive and remain we're
[1:43:06] still mortals
[1:43:09] we're not corrupted yet because we ain't
[1:43:11] been dead four days
[1:43:14] so we're the ones that are alive and
[1:43:16] remain will be the mortals that put on
[1:43:17] immortality
[1:43:20] and those that's gone on before us
[1:43:22] they corrupted
[1:43:24] so they're going to put on incorruption
[1:43:27] they're going to be raised up first
[1:43:29] we're going to be changed in a moment in
[1:43:31] the 20th clinton eye and we'll be joined
[1:43:33] together with them in the air and so
[1:43:35] shall we ever be with the lord
[1:43:39] amen
[1:43:41] now i just want to give you a little
[1:43:42] insight here
[1:43:45] the way that your body
[1:43:47] is going to be changed
[1:43:48] from mortal to immortal listen closely
[1:43:51] here because satan is trying to get us
[1:43:54] to believe that we can put off till
[1:43:56] tomorrow
[1:43:57] before we start getting this intimate
[1:43:58] walk with god
[1:44:00] and if he can convince you that
[1:44:03] then when it comes time for the rapture
[1:44:05] there will be nothing inside of you to
[1:44:07] quicken your mortal bodies
[1:44:11] if you read with me romans 8 11 it said
[1:44:15] if the spirit of him
[1:44:18] that raised up christ from the dead
[1:44:21] dwell in you
[1:44:28] he said if the spirit of him
[1:44:31] that raised up christ from the dead
[1:44:34] dwell in you
[1:44:36] then he that raised up christ from the
[1:44:39] dead
[1:44:40] shall also quicken
[1:44:43] your mortal bodies
[1:44:47] by what
[1:44:49] by the spirit that dwells in you
[1:44:57] how did the spirit get in you
[1:45:00] do you ever think about that
[1:45:02] how come the spirit's in you
[1:45:05] and it's not in somebody else
[1:45:07] i'm going to tell you how
[1:45:15] can i come in
[1:45:17] can i come in
[1:45:21] can i come in
[1:45:23] he keeps knocking
[1:45:25] and knocking
[1:45:27] and one day you're walking along and you
[1:45:29] hear that knock
[1:45:30] he says can i come in
[1:45:32] and he said why sure
[1:45:35] and you went over he opened up the door
[1:45:37] and jesus come in
[1:45:39] you have to open the door
[1:45:44] but let's be honest friends
[1:45:46] we don't want to just open the door and
[1:45:48] then tell him sit down and and don't you
[1:45:51] mess with my personal life
[1:45:53] don't you start messing with my the way
[1:45:55] that i look
[1:45:56] i'm an american woman
[1:45:59] if i want to have a bossy spirit i'll
[1:46:00] have a bossy spirit
[1:46:03] but but
[1:46:05] the bible says that a meek and a quiet
[1:46:08] spirit is of great price in the sight of
[1:46:10] the lord
[1:46:12] well i'll have you to know i'm i'm
[1:46:14] yeah
[1:46:15] i don't want to hear that
[1:46:17] well you're not going to get it
[1:46:19] because he that has an ear to hear
[1:46:22] let him hear what the spirit says
[1:46:25] now look it's a it's it's a walking and
[1:46:28] it's a talking with god
[1:46:31] and we're going to be tested along the
[1:46:32] way
[1:46:34] but i want to tell you how easy god
[1:46:35] makes it on you
[1:46:39] how many has ever been in school
[1:46:41] and the teacher said friday we're going
[1:46:43] to have a test

[1:47:13] it gets better
[1:47:15] it gets better
[1:47:18] it gets better
[1:47:20] oh my somebody say it gets better
[1:47:22] and better
[1:47:24] so anyways
[1:47:26] well he knows some people have a hard
[1:47:27] time finding things in the book like me

[1:47:36] something i'll say where's that answer
[1:47:38] where's i'm looking right at it i can't
[1:47:40] see it
[1:47:43] but our god loves us so much
[1:47:46] he said my yoke is easy
[1:47:48] he said my burden is light
[1:47:50] he said come
[1:47:52] learn of me now if you're learning of
[1:47:54] him what's that make you
[1:47:56] a student
[1:47:57] you're a student
[1:47:58] and this teacher he loves you so much he
[1:48:01] gives you an open book
[1:48:02] so you can just open the book and you
[1:48:04] can find the answers
[1:48:06] but if you have a hard time finding the
[1:48:08] answers do you know what else he said he
[1:48:10] could do he said you could come up
[1:48:12] to him
[1:48:14] quietly now

[1:50:58] and then
[1:51:02] i'm preaching to myself
[1:51:04] so anyways
[1:51:06] and then
[1:51:08] james goes on to say
[1:51:10] that when you get this wisdom
[1:51:12] it'll be peaceable
[1:51:15] and it will be gentle
[1:51:17] and it will be easy to be entreated
[1:51:21] there's no bitterness
[1:51:23] there's no god
[1:51:25] there's no jealousy
[1:51:27] there's no envy
[1:51:29] when you get this holy spirit the way
[1:51:32] god wants you to have it you want
[1:51:35] everybody to have it
[1:51:37] and you just want to pour it out and let
[1:51:39] me just say this jesus said it's more
[1:51:41] blessed to give than to receive didn't
[1:51:43] he
[1:51:45] well i want to tell you something you're
[1:51:47] more you're more blessed you're more
[1:51:49] blessed when you're giving love
[1:51:52] than when you're being loved
[1:51:55] and that's the truth
[1:51:57] the more that you give the more that
[1:51:59] you'll have love is the one thing that
[1:52:01] you can't give too much of
[1:52:04] and the most unlovable people they're
[1:52:07] the ones that need it the most remember
[1:52:09] brother branham went into a restaurant
[1:52:11] and the server they didn't give him very
[1:52:13] very good service and and so at the they
[1:52:16] were getting ready to leave and he left
[1:52:18] i think like a five or ten dollar tip
[1:52:21] was a big tip back in those days and he
[1:52:23] left it there and the brother looked at
[1:52:25] him said why did you do that she gave us
[1:52:27] terrible service
[1:52:29] and he said because she needed it
[1:52:31] he he was able he knew she needed it and
[1:52:35] that's why that he gave it to her and
[1:52:38] brothers and sisters this world
[1:52:41] this world that we're living in now you
[1:52:44] know what they need more than anything
[1:52:45] else
[1:52:46] you know what they're craving for and
[1:52:47] they don't even know it
[1:52:49] they want to be loved
[1:52:51] they want to be loved
[1:52:52] and they have no love the only true love
[1:52:54] there is is amongst the bride amen
[1:52:58] there's no lack of love amongst the
[1:52:59] bride
[1:53:00] y'all can stand the musicians can come
[1:53:02] god bless you
[1:53:05] i hope a little bit of something was
[1:53:06] said that can encourage somebody
[1:53:09] all i know is that it's very simple this
[1:53:11] walk is very simple and it's it's it's
[1:53:14] an open book test
[1:53:16] and if you have any questions finding
[1:53:18] any of the answers
[1:53:19] all you got to do is ask him
[1:53:22] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:53:25] father god
[1:53:26] in jesus name we're so grateful father
[1:53:29] to you for your mercy
[1:53:30] and for your grace and our lives lord
[1:53:33] and lord there's none of us that deserve
[1:53:36] to have you in our lives lord but lord
[1:53:38] jesus we sure do appreciate all that
[1:53:40] you've done for us lord lord when we
[1:53:43] look and we see your life
[1:53:45] making itself known in us father it
[1:53:48] gives us such a desire lord god to stay
[1:53:50] in your presence it gives us a hunger
[1:53:53] and a thirst and for righteousness sake
[1:53:55] lord and father we just pray lord jesus
[1:53:57] christ that we can yield ourselves to
[1:54:01] your spirit so that you can express
[1:54:03] yourself out through us to this lost
[1:54:06] into this dying world and we ask this
[1:54:08] all in the name of jesus christ
[1:54:11] amen
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:25] how many enjoy the service
[1:54:27] amen
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:34] let's go and let god
[1:54:38] have what
[1:54:41] easy
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:44] easy without any headache
[1:54:46] amen
[1:54:48] blessed be the name of the lord so god
[1:54:52] gave us a law
[1:54:54] amen
[1:54:55] and the law of the spirit of life we
[1:54:58] know that it's greater than the law of
[1:55:00] sin and death
[1:55:01] it is not true that is greater it's the
[1:55:03] law
[1:55:05] in you that is greater amen
[1:55:08] uh repeat it over and over
[1:55:10] and the holy spirit wanted to emphasize
[1:55:13] over and over
[1:55:14] this walk
[1:55:16] is not a complicated walk
[1:55:19] amen
[1:55:20] the message itself is not complicated
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:25] the purpose of the ministry is not to
[1:55:27] make the message complicated
[1:55:30] it is to actually take the message and
[1:55:32] then break it down
[1:55:34] until you can see it clearly and say now
[1:55:36] i can see
[1:55:38] you can see not the preacher but you're
[1:55:40] seeing your husband
[1:55:42] amen
[1:55:44] i don't know what you're going through
[1:55:46] but somebody
[1:55:47] is struggling
[1:55:50] somebody is still living on the
[1:55:51] humanistic level
[1:55:53] and they don't want to go they don't
[1:55:55] want to let it go
[1:55:57] amen
[1:55:59] somebody's still struggling trying to
[1:56:01] use their own mind
[1:56:04] to leave a christian walk
[1:56:06] that's what i have been hammering just
[1:56:08] keep telling you to take your hand
[1:56:11] off your will
[1:56:12] amen it's difficult
[1:56:15] brother branham say it's hard
[1:56:17] because man have a tendency to always do
[1:56:20] something
[1:56:21] because since the garden of eden when
[1:56:24] men fell before even god come to help
[1:56:27] him he already figured out something
[1:56:30] to cover himself he never even could
[1:56:33] wait and say okay we already messed up
[1:56:36] what do we do
[1:56:37] let's wait for god to come then we're
[1:56:39] going to explain god what happened as
[1:56:41] soon as he messed up the first thing
[1:56:43] that happened he started fixing stuff
[1:56:45] his own way
[1:56:46] and he thought that work but when he
[1:56:49] approached the presence of god
[1:56:51] humanistically you could look at adam
[1:56:53] and eve
[1:56:54] and see them covered by
[1:56:58] fig leaves it worked for them
[1:57:00] humanistically but when god came
[1:57:04] to adam where are you
[1:57:06] adam never responded to god and say god
[1:57:10] i am clothes
[1:57:13] i am clothed here he never say that
[1:57:16] where are you why are you hiding
[1:57:17] yourself
[1:57:19] i thought he was closed already
[1:57:22] he saw fake leaves
[1:57:24] if god calls you tonight are you gonna
[1:57:26] tell him i'm naked no you have clothes
[1:57:29] you're not gonna say that
[1:57:30] why was adam dressed and then he can
[1:57:32] tell god he was closed
[1:57:35] because
[1:57:37] he showed that what man can do is not
[1:57:40] able to stand in the presence of god
[1:57:43] amen
[1:57:45] god was not coming down to just chase
[1:57:48] them or kill them or whatever he was
[1:57:50] just coming down looking for his
[1:57:53] children
[1:57:54] amen coming down to rescue his children
[1:57:57] god already knew what's going to happen
[1:57:59] amen
[1:58:00] so it is not a difficult walk
[1:58:05] it has
[1:58:07] that's why you heard brother branham say
[1:58:08] the greatest enemy that i have
[1:58:12] is not my neighbor
[1:58:14] brother branham say the greatest enemy
[1:58:16] that i have is myself
[1:58:18] it's that person that when they preach
[1:58:21] and they say stop wearing nails
[1:58:24] that person doesn't listen
[1:58:27] that person keep going and putting nails
[1:58:30] that person is looking for every single
[1:58:33] way out or excuse to run away
[1:58:37] amen
[1:58:38] that's your enemy
[1:58:41] that's the person
[1:58:42] it doesn't mean that you need to take a
[1:58:44] gun and shoot yourself
[1:58:46] no brother branham say if you can
[1:58:48] overcome that person you can overcome
[1:58:51] every enemy amen because the real
[1:58:54] trouble that start start really within
[1:58:56] us brother branham say the battle has
[1:58:58] been raging since eden brother branham
[1:59:02] is raging in us
[1:59:04] not outside of us inside of us amen
[1:59:07] so the easiest way the brother gave uh
[1:59:11] examples here tonight
[1:59:13] is very simple
[1:59:15] very simple
[1:59:16] amen it's not complicated just take god
[1:59:20] at his word you remember a few sunday
[1:59:23] but i'm saying when you take god at his
[1:59:26] word it's the biggest blow that the
[1:59:29] devil is receiving
[1:59:30] amen
[1:59:31] take god that his word doesn't mean that
[1:59:34] what you have is gone
[1:59:37] did you hear what i say
[1:59:39] did you hear what i say
[1:59:42] when michael angelo
[1:59:45] had the vision of moses
[1:59:48] he wanted to build the image of moses
[1:59:52] the masterpiece
[1:59:54] the first thing he did
[1:59:56] he went
[1:59:57] into a place and saw a bunch of rocks
[2:00:01] amen
[2:00:02] when he saw rocks he went there and he
[2:00:04] picked up one rock
[2:00:06] why didn't he pick up the other one and
[2:00:09] pick to that one amen
[2:00:13] because michelangelo looked at different
[2:00:16] rocks
[2:00:17] and he saw that this one
[2:00:19] can reflect moses
[2:00:22] amen
[2:00:23] when he picked up the rock and pull it
[2:00:26] but random is telling you that is what
[2:00:28] is called justification
[2:00:30] but if you look at the rock
[2:00:33] he doesn't have anything that looks like
[2:00:36] moses
[2:00:38] matter of fact there is filthy
[2:00:40] or whatever was around where the rock
[2:00:43] was laying for years amen
[2:00:46] but in the process of time when
[2:00:48] michelangelo brought that rock he began
[2:00:51] to chip
[2:00:52] away
[2:00:54] not moses
[2:00:57] do you know what he was chipping away
[2:01:00] everything
[2:01:02] in that rock that was not moses
[2:01:05] amen
[2:01:06] amen
[2:01:07] did you hear me
[2:01:12] oh my
[2:01:14] blessed be the name of the lord this is
[2:01:16] the rock
[2:01:19] moses is inside here
[2:01:21] everybody clear
[2:01:22] when monkey angelo picked the rock moses
[2:01:25] was there
[2:01:26] if michelangelo tells you
[2:01:28] this is moses
[2:01:30] you'll be looking at where is moses
[2:01:33] but through vision
[2:01:35] he can see moses in the rock
[2:01:38] amen
[2:01:39] but moses was covered with different
[2:01:42] parts of the rock that didn't belong to
[2:01:45] moses
[2:01:46] do you hear me
[2:01:48] so the work of michelangelo michael
[2:01:51] angelo michael angelo michael the
[2:01:56] archangel
[2:01:59] did you hear that now
[2:02:02] why did brother branham pick
[2:02:03] michelangelo do you think he just picked
[2:02:05] michelangelo because the name is good he
[2:02:07] was telling you it's michael the
[2:02:09] archangel
[2:02:12] why was he talking about why did that
[2:02:14] man michelangelo had to uh uh sculpt a
[2:02:19] man called moses why only moses why he
[2:02:21] didn't pick up joshua
[2:02:24] go look in the book of jude you're gonna
[2:02:25] see
[2:02:26] michelangelo talking about the body of
[2:02:28] moses
[2:02:30] anybody clear so when michelangelo
[2:02:33] picked this
[2:02:35] all he was doing over the year was
[2:02:38] removing
[2:02:39] every rock that is not moses
[2:02:43] do you hear me
[2:02:45] and after a while the image begin to
[2:02:47] come up clearly like okay this is the
[2:02:50] cheek of moses
[2:02:51] this is the nose of moses
[2:02:54] and until you reach a point where every
[2:02:57] single portion of the rock that was not
[2:03:00] moses was completely off
[2:03:03] then he himself got stirred up
[2:03:06] and he wanted that moses to do what
[2:03:13] you see where the power of the spoken
[2:03:15] word lies
[2:03:16] amen
[2:03:18] all you have to do is just accept his
[2:03:21] chipping
[2:03:24] and let him do the chipping
[2:03:26] that's the problem
[2:03:28] if he says stop makeup
[2:03:31] don't stop makeup in church and go home
[2:03:33] and do makeup
[2:03:36] and then post it on facebook
[2:03:38] don't do that
[2:03:39] you're wasting your time
[2:03:41] when he's when he's talking about stop
[2:03:44] your filthy living just stop it
[2:03:47] don't go there leave a fearful living
[2:03:49] and come here i'm trying to act like
[2:03:51] christian just stop it
[2:03:53] when he says stop a bad friendship stop
[2:03:57] it
[2:03:59] you can go up there and before you know
[2:04:01] it you're not fooling anybody at the end
[2:04:05] of the day you're gonna find yourself
[2:04:07] that you were fooling yourself
[2:04:09] we all knew we were just watching you
[2:04:14] why are you hiding
[2:04:16] why is he hard
[2:04:18] you don't have to feel it
[2:04:21] how many
[2:04:22] times sometimes you're trying to pray
[2:04:24] and you start praying you feel like you
[2:04:26] can't pray
[2:04:28] and if you start forcing you pray a
[2:04:30] little bit you pray a little bit after a
[2:04:32] while you just feel free
[2:04:34] why did you feel free because you were
[2:04:36] persistent
[2:04:37] amen
[2:04:39] there's two ways either you can stay
[2:04:40] persistent and the devil will understand
[2:04:43] that this really mean business and he
[2:04:45] takes away but if you're not persistent
[2:04:47] then you're gonna go back again and say
[2:04:49] maybe i don't feel good i just need to
[2:04:51] go ahead and sit maybe the holy ghost is
[2:04:53] not here i'm not feeling anything i need
[2:04:55] to go ahead and sit by the same would
[2:04:58] have missed that prayer meeting amen
[2:05:01] so whether you feel it or not the senses
[2:05:04] whether
[2:05:05] it's you you you smell it or not if god
[2:05:09] say
[2:05:10] take it away take that tight dress away
[2:05:13] just take that dress and put it in the
[2:05:16] garbage when you do that automatically
[2:05:20] you have called heaven
[2:05:23] to come and back you up just by doing
[2:05:25] that
[2:05:27] but if we look at you we're gonna see
[2:05:29] the desire of that dress that's not your
[2:05:31] problem
[2:05:32] you cannot remove the desire and say
[2:05:35] desire come out no you cannot do that
[2:05:37] you need a higher power you need a
[2:05:40] higher law
[2:05:41] that need to come into your life and
[2:05:44] swallow that desire like the snake of
[2:05:46] moses god need to send something to take
[2:05:49] it out but the first thing is you must
[2:05:52] obey
[2:05:54] you must obey
[2:05:58] very easy
[2:05:59] god told israel don't go to work stay
[2:06:01] home that's it what is the problem
[2:06:05] did i give you food yes
[2:06:07] did that double your food yes tomorrow
[2:06:10] do not go outside to pick up the manner
[2:06:14] did you hear me yes in the morning
[2:06:16] israel woke up again and pick up the
[2:06:18] mana trying to find the manner
[2:06:21] the
[2:06:21] what was the motive of going outside
[2:06:25] did you have money did you have food yes
[2:06:28] why did you go all he asked you training
[2:06:31] israel in obedience
[2:06:34] but israel would not listen until you
[2:06:36] say you know what let me get a whooping
[2:06:37] a little bit babylon come and take them
[2:06:39] whoop them a little bit then bring them
[2:06:41] back
[2:06:42] whoop them a little bit and bring it
[2:06:43] back it's so easy but stephen i cannot
[2:06:46] overcome this but stephen this is keep
[2:06:48] coming over and over what is the desire
[2:06:51] of your heart
[2:06:53] what do you want are you really
[2:06:56] at the point of decision to say
[2:06:58] i'm sick and i'm tired of this thing i
[2:07:02] wanted to go if you get to that point
[2:07:05] and you just take god at his word
[2:07:08] god will send a backup from heaven
[2:07:12] and you will see that it won't be
[2:07:13] complicated and it will go when it
[2:07:16] happened to the first thing the second
[2:07:18] thing the third thing everything will go
[2:07:20] away why is somebody else living a
[2:07:22] christian laughing you are the only one
[2:07:24] struggling why
[2:07:26] i want to be happy
[2:07:28] i want to live a clean life
[2:07:30] i want to be happy in my marriage why
[2:07:32] should i suffer all the time
[2:07:34] amen why should i suffer at home
[2:07:38] why
[2:07:39] why am i the only one struggling
[2:07:42] why
[2:07:44] learn
[2:07:45] to obey
[2:07:47] obedience is better
[2:07:49] than sacrifice
[2:07:51] amen
[2:07:52] when god unfolds something here through
[2:07:54] a minister and show you you need prayer
[2:07:59] we're not telling you when you go home
[2:08:01] you're going to be professional praying

[2:08:25] you're gonna end and before you know it
[2:08:27] the lord will begin to unfold things

[2:08:36] fooling yourself you're just wasting
[2:08:39] your time somebody's growing with the
[2:08:41] lord you're just missing the great
[2:08:43] blessings
[2:08:45] all you have to do is not to force your
[2:08:47] christianity is not to run away from it

[2:08:53] wing you spread your wing you need to
[2:08:55] face that situation you need to face the
[2:08:57] storm and you will see that same storm
[2:09:00] that you think is coming to pull you
[2:09:02] down god will use that and then
[2:09:05] shoot you up again to the higher level
[2:09:07] amen
[2:09:09] all god wants you to do is do
[2:09:12] just a load of obedience
