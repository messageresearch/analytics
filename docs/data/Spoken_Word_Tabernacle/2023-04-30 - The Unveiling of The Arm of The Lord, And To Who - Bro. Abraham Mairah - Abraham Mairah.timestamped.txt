[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:47] he's already here he descended you know
[1:01:50] he's ready to take us home
[1:01:53] but not willing that any of the elect
[1:01:57] should perish
[1:01:59] that's why he's always holding on
[1:02:02] so he's not carrying we are the ones
[1:02:05] starring him
[1:02:07] and we really appreciate him for that
[1:02:11] amen

[1:03:07] and we all saw Lord God reckon they are
[1:03:10] those many others streaming
[1:03:12] around the world as they always ring and
[1:03:15] confirm
[1:03:16] Lord I pray that your blessing will be
[1:03:18] upon them
[1:03:20] in what am I that am I mean even
[1:03:22] standing here
[1:03:24] Lord is only you
[1:03:26] who can come and break yourself because
[1:03:29] you're the bread of life
[1:03:31] break yourself Lord God that your
[1:03:33] children can partake of it
[1:03:36] come on Lord God being that you are the
[1:03:39] great El Shaddai
[1:03:41] the Lord you'll hand over
[1:03:43] that particular teeth for a particular
[1:03:46] need that your children have got
[1:03:49] and Lord may I completely step out of
[1:03:52] the way
[1:03:55] and come and anoint your servant and
[1:03:58] speak through the sleeps of clay
[1:04:00] that we can which can be a blessing unto
[1:04:04] them and preparing us for that final
[1:04:06] hour
[1:04:09] the grand hour that we are waiting for
[1:04:12] bless the reading of your world and
[1:04:14] bless your children anoint your servant
[1:04:16] in Jesus name
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:23] we shall turn to our Bibles
[1:04:25] of just a couple of scriptures to read
[1:04:28] if you can turn your Bibles with me
[1:04:33] in the book of Isaiah chapter 59 and 53
[1:04:37] and revelation 3.
[1:04:43] Isaiah chapter 59
[1:04:48] verse 1 and 2.
[1:04:53] he says
[1:05:03] behold the Lord is Hindi is not
[1:05:06] shortened
[1:05:07] that it cannot serve neither his ear
[1:05:11] heavy that it cannot hear
[1:05:17] but your iniquities of separated between
[1:05:19] you and your God and your sins of heed
[1:05:22] his face from you
[1:05:24] that you're not here
[1:05:28] going a little bit behind there in
[1:05:31] chapter 53
[1:05:34] verse 1 it says
[1:05:39] who has believed our rebought
[1:05:45] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:05:48] revealed
[1:05:52] that is a question
[1:05:58] and we can we come to the Book of
[1:06:00] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:06:06] verse 15
[1:06:08] and 16.
[1:06:11] I know that it works
[1:06:15] or hot
[1:06:17] I would thou what called or hot
[1:06:23] so then because Tower look on either
[1:06:26] cold or hot I'll spill thee out of my
[1:06:30] mouth
[1:06:32] may God bless his word and bless you you
[1:06:35] may be seated
[1:06:50] excuse me I have a problem you know
[1:06:53] change of weather change of times
[1:06:55] has had it stall on my body
[1:06:59] sorry
[1:07:02] it's
[1:07:03] slowly going to adapt
[1:07:09] and we are dealing with that question
[1:07:12] the one the first one is a statement
[1:07:16] which emphatically puts is clear that
[1:07:19] the Lord is hand is not short
[1:07:23] neither can it be shortened
[1:07:27] it's not a short and it cannot be
[1:07:30] shortened that it can fail to serve
[1:07:40] and then he comes in the second party
[1:07:43] there he was saying unto whom
[1:07:45] is the arm of the Lord revealed who has
[1:07:50] believed our report
[1:07:55] where did we get that report
[1:08:00] and Isaiah as a prophet is presenting
[1:08:03] himself in a plural
[1:08:06] says Allah
[1:08:09] report
[1:08:11] because the way believers
[1:08:13] who believed his message
[1:08:16] and whoever receives
[1:08:18] you know a prophet in the name of a
[1:08:20] prophet receives a prophet it's a reward
[1:08:23] so the prophet becomes plural by that of
[1:08:26] those who received the message
[1:08:30] and he says who has believed our report
[1:08:35] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:08:37] revealed
[1:08:43] so I'm speaking about the title of the
[1:08:46] unfailing
[1:08:48] of the Lord's arm and to who
[1:08:58] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:01] and if you want to go back to the some
[1:09:03] some scripture here in the book of First
[1:09:04] Kings I think if I am to remember very
[1:09:06] well
[1:09:08] um
[1:09:09] First Kings here
[1:09:13] chapter 8.
[1:09:17] Solomon dedicating the temple he speaks
[1:09:20] here in verse 22 he says and Solomon
[1:09:22] stood before the oath of the Lord in the
[1:09:24] princess of holy Congregation of Israel
[1:09:26] and it's prayed forth his sons towards
[1:09:28] heaven
[1:09:31] and he said Lord God of Israel there is
[1:09:34] no God like thee
[1:09:35] in Heaven above on Earth benefit
[1:09:39] Covenant and mercy with thy servants
[1:09:42] that walk before thee with all their
[1:09:45] heart
[1:09:46] now look to this verse 24 he says
[1:09:49] who has kept thy servant David my father
[1:09:53] that thou promises to him
[1:09:57] thou's biggest also with thy mouth
[1:10:02] and has fulfilled it with dining hand
[1:10:06] as it is this day
[1:10:10] so God speaks with his mouth
[1:10:14] and he fulfills it
[1:10:17] with his hand
[1:10:21] so it is unto Those whom the arm the
[1:10:24] hand is revealed
[1:10:27] that become part of the machine that
[1:10:30] that fulfills and sees the Fulfillment
[1:10:34] but who are those
[1:10:38] because he speaks with the imams and he
[1:10:41] fulfills with the hand but to whom is
[1:10:44] that hand revealed
[1:10:48] who is going to see the Fulfillment of
[1:10:50] the spoken word of God
[1:10:53] who are going to overcome all
[1:10:54] impediments
[1:10:56] or the obstacles
[1:10:58] all the failures all the demons that the
[1:11:02] devil has released to fail the word
[1:11:06] who are going to be those people who are
[1:11:08] going to be triumphant
[1:11:12] and see the word of God full of fearing
[1:11:15] in their life
[1:11:16] the people to whom the arm of the Lord
[1:11:19] will be revealed because he speaks with
[1:11:22] his mouth and full of fears with his
[1:11:25] hand
[1:11:30] but
[1:11:34] what is his mouth
[1:11:39] glory be to God because he brings it out
[1:11:43] in Revelation he says because you are
[1:11:46] lukewarm you are neither hot nor called
[1:11:49] I will spill
[1:11:52] so where are you
[1:11:57] when you are not lukewarm where are you
[1:12:01] you are in the mouth of God
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:06] you are in the very mouth of God that's
[1:12:09] where you reside that's where you are
[1:12:11] it's only when you become cold lukewarm
[1:12:17] towards his word towards God that is
[1:12:21] peels you out
[1:12:22] but when you are warm I mean when you
[1:12:25] are hot
[1:12:27] when you are hot when you are on fire
[1:12:30] for God
[1:12:31] when you are energized
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:35] when you are part of the system that he
[1:12:37] is you stay in the mouth of God
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:42] so that remains
[1:12:44] you are both there when they speak it
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:49] and you are part of the fulfilling past
[1:12:52] machine
[1:12:55] you are in the hand
[1:13:00] and you are in the mouth
[1:13:03] because come on we are not a lukewarm
[1:13:05] Church
[1:13:06] and if you have been lukewarm get out of
[1:13:09] there today
[1:13:11] be on fire
[1:13:13] there is enough fire to make you fiery
[1:13:16] there is enough Holocaust to make you
[1:13:19] full of power and power and matter
[1:13:23] there is enough Grace to keep you on
[1:13:25] fire
[1:13:27] why should you be Europe
[1:13:33] because out of the mouth of God comes
[1:13:36] the sword the fire
[1:13:38] laughs
[1:13:40] our God is a consuming fire and that
[1:13:44] consuming fire comes from the mouth and
[1:13:46] you are in the mouth how can you be in
[1:13:48] the mouth where there is a fire and you
[1:13:51] are lukewarm
[1:13:58] so now we are coming to something
[1:14:03] if you were part of the mouth that
[1:14:06] speaks the word
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] in other words when God spoke it you
[1:14:11] spoke it together with him
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:16] America
[1:14:18] the word we are believing is the voice
[1:14:22] of God
[1:14:23] it's the voice of God the message that
[1:14:26] we have got is the voice of God it's the
[1:14:28] vindicatory truth we are not looking for
[1:14:31] truth we have got the truth we are sure
[1:14:34] we have heard from God we have heard
[1:14:37] from God
[1:14:39] we are not guessing about it we are sure
[1:14:42] about it we know where we are standing
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:48] so when God's Pocket I was part of the
[1:14:52] mouth
[1:14:54] hey
[1:14:57] until you get lukewarm he spills you out
[1:15:03] but when you're on fire you are there
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:10] let's go and look at something here in
[1:15:13] the Book of John
[1:15:16] I'm just using some moves for brother
[1:15:19] Stephen
[1:15:29] let's look at what the Bible says here
[1:15:32] and in John chapter 1
[1:15:36] in the beginning was the word
[1:15:45] and before the word can be spoken forth
[1:15:48] there has to be a thought and a prophet
[1:15:50] says you were in his thinking
[1:15:54] so you were not just part of the world
[1:15:56] but you are part of the thought before
[1:15:59] this the word was spoken
[1:16:03] think about how important you are
[1:16:05] think about how established your
[1:16:08] foundation is
[1:16:09] think about how sometimes you belittle
[1:16:12] who you are and how God established you
[1:16:15] before there was any negative thing
[1:16:19] before even any belief came up before
[1:16:22] even the devil was was the devil before
[1:16:25] even Lucifer became what he was
[1:16:28] in God's thoughts
[1:16:30] and in the beginning was the word so
[1:16:33] when he's part of the word
[1:16:39] and you are in the mouth of God
[1:16:44] glory to God
[1:16:47] no wonder you cannot have room for
[1:16:50] unbelief how can you doubt
[1:16:53] how can you doubt what you believe what
[1:16:56] you spoke
[1:16:58] when he is popular what you were down
[1:17:01] there saying amen
[1:17:04] how can you doubt it
[1:17:07] how can you fail to get it
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:12] in the beginning
[1:17:14] what's the word
[1:17:17] and the world was with God of course
[1:17:19] that is the logos
[1:17:20] and the world was good and then he says
[1:17:22] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:17:26] the word
[1:17:30] all things were made by him without him
[1:17:32] was not anything made that was made now
[1:17:35] look at this verse for in him was life
[1:17:40] in who in the world
[1:17:42] was life
[1:17:46] and the life was the light
[1:17:51] of men
[1:17:53] it doesn't say the life became the light
[1:17:57] of men
[1:18:04] life was the light of men
[1:18:09] in the beginning
[1:18:12] who are this men
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:17] who are this men
[1:18:20] in him logos was the light I mean the
[1:18:25] life and the life was the light of men
[1:18:30] what does light do manifest
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:37] so what manifests is the life which the
[1:18:41] life is the light and the light was for
[1:18:45] men men who were there when God was
[1:18:48] speaking
[1:18:52] the word
[1:18:55] oh I wish I was a good preacher like
[1:18:58] brother Stephen
[1:19:00] I could start preaching now
[1:19:08] the light the life was the light of men
[1:19:14] what does the life like to do
[1:19:18] and you know here the prophet says
[1:19:21] let's close our eyes to our imaginations
[1:19:25] for a few moments let's go way back in
[1:19:28] before there was anything
[1:19:31] the great Fountain of all eternity was
[1:19:34] that Spirit of love joy and the spirit
[1:19:36] of honesty and that spirit of cruelness
[1:19:39] in Perfection and then out of the
[1:19:42] existence of the father went in the
[1:19:44] logos which was the son which was a
[1:19:48] theophany which was the body of the
[1:19:51] great Jehovah God went forth in a
[1:19:53] Celestial body
[1:19:55] that is the logos the word spoke out of
[1:19:59] them great Fountains of life
[1:20:01] and went forth and there was the there
[1:20:04] was the theophany which was God made
[1:20:06] into the world
[1:20:09] and then that theophan of course Elohim
[1:20:11] now forming into the world he says then
[1:20:14] that great if you're funny was made
[1:20:16] flesh in the passion of Jesus Christ and
[1:20:19] all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in
[1:20:21] him both Father Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:23] all in that and that's the very way we
[1:20:26] go
[1:20:28] come back to the original beginning
[1:20:33] that's the way we go by Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] back
[1:20:38] Plum back
[1:20:40] to the original beginning of God so
[1:20:43] jesus takes away all the rubbish
[1:20:46] oh the most
[1:20:51] if you can go back to Isaiah he says
[1:20:53] look to the Rock from whence you were
[1:20:56] healed
[1:20:58] so because this rock was healed from the
[1:21:00] major Rock and cast into time
[1:21:03] and it stayed there dormant forgot where
[1:21:06] it came from most
[1:21:09] started a building on it
[1:21:13] the most of sin but now when you try to
[1:21:16] look back you couldn't fit back in the
[1:21:19] hall whereas they got you because there
[1:21:21] is a lot of sin there is moss there is
[1:21:24] that around you then the blood of Jesus
[1:21:28] comes and cleanses you from all the most
[1:21:30] and now you look back and you see where
[1:21:33] they cut you and you can go back and fit
[1:21:36] Plum back by Jesus Christ to the
[1:21:40] original
[1:21:42] the beginning
[1:21:43] which is the word
[1:21:45] which is the logos
[1:21:48] and you are in the mouth
[1:21:50] [Applause]
[1:21:53] then he says
[1:21:57] glory to God
[1:21:59] original Plumb back to the original the
[1:22:02] beginning of God there listen there we
[1:22:05] are born again so when you talk about
[1:22:08] being born again you are born again
[1:22:11] back up there
[1:22:13] you are taking him back
[1:22:16] to the original beginning
[1:22:20] when God spoke of the word
[1:22:24] and the sons of God shouted together for
[1:22:27] joy
[1:22:29] where were you
[1:22:31] [Applause]
[1:22:35] maybe I'll be preaching somewhere about
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:40] who is darkening my Council
[1:22:46] who is this one using your lips job
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:51] I know can you doubt that job was there
[1:22:54] job was there but God is saying who is
[1:22:58] this
[1:22:59] who is this one speaking through you
[1:23:02] thinking in you acting in you making you
[1:23:06] believe like you behave like a failure
[1:23:08] making you behave like you you don't
[1:23:11] know what is going on making you believe
[1:23:15] behave as if like you are supposed to be
[1:23:17] affected by the surrounding
[1:23:19] you were there before the surrounding
[1:23:22] you were there before circumstances
[1:23:25] you were there before demons came up you
[1:23:28] were back there before disease came you
[1:23:31] were there before problems came you were
[1:23:34] there in the world that's where you are
[1:23:36] born again from back away
[1:23:39] and you have got your anchor back to the
[1:23:42] beginning
[1:23:43] not in American society
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:23:49] not born again American not born again
[1:23:52] African not born again Chinese born
[1:23:56] again see the charm of God born against
[1:23:59] word of God manifested
[1:24:02] never to fail
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:07] and the devil doesn't want you to
[1:24:09] recognize that
[1:24:11] once you come to that
[1:24:13] you are going to be very dangerous
[1:24:16] to the devil's Kingdom
[1:24:19] very dangerous
[1:24:21] and I want you to become very dangerous
[1:24:26] because when the devil is dealing with
[1:24:28] you he doesn't spare you
[1:24:31] and we have to come to a point where we
[1:24:33] don't spare it ever either
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:35] [Applause]
[1:24:37] all our potential
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:41] Glory oh God
[1:24:45] foreign
[1:24:50] that went out of God when it began to
[1:24:54] brood upon the Earth and brought forth
[1:24:56] marine life where the spirit of God the
[1:24:58] logos the word which God said let there
[1:25:01] be
[1:25:02] and there went to the logos
[1:25:06] and when God said let there be
[1:25:09] you way with God and you didn't have an
[1:25:12] ayat of unbelief in you
[1:25:14] because there was no unbelief
[1:25:17] the first sinner who sinned from the
[1:25:20] beginning was the devil
[1:25:25] not you
[1:25:29] you are you are not the first sinner
[1:25:32] it's the devil
[1:25:34] and he just wants to smear you with his
[1:25:37] dad
[1:25:38] but we thank God that there is something
[1:25:41] that can cleanse you
[1:25:44] so he says
[1:25:49] oh Hallelujah
[1:25:51] glory be to God it says and finally upon
[1:25:56] the Earth came the genuine image of God
[1:25:58] himself again
[1:26:00] which was good
[1:26:02] the Lord was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:26:04] Us
[1:26:06] now that same logos has a part
[1:26:09] he has got a bride
[1:26:14] and our same logos this word that cannot
[1:26:17] be tampered with
[1:26:21] anytime Parable if that's English
[1:26:28] Glory oh God
[1:26:34] cannot be
[1:26:36] someone can try to fidget with it
[1:26:41] but it's built in such a way that
[1:26:45] it cannot be tampered with
[1:26:48] it stays original
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:52] it is sealed it is classified a
[1:26:56] classified message to a classified
[1:26:58] people sealed away from others
[1:27:01] the recipients are known by God is for
[1:27:04] our knowledge their stand is guaranteed
[1:27:10] oh my Hallelujah
[1:27:13] foreign
[1:27:16] it says
[1:27:18] cannot be tampered with is brooding over
[1:27:20] the churches himself is brooding over
[1:27:23] the churches today trying to bring back
[1:27:25] the word it's full money Festus

[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] new Bible
[1:33:19] let's see how the hand of God works
[1:33:22] let's go to Leviticus chapter 8.
[1:33:39] oh I wish I was a good one
[1:33:45] Glory oh God
[1:33:47] Leviticus chapter 8.
[1:33:52] somebody should get ready to read for me
[1:33:54] Numbers chapter 4 verse 49. let's see
[1:33:57] Leviticus chapter
[1:34:00] 8 verse 36 he says
[1:34:03] so Aaron
[1:34:05] and his sons did all the things which
[1:34:10] the Lord commanded by the hand
[1:34:15] of Moses
[1:34:26] not the mouth
[1:34:28] so Moses
[1:34:29] was speaking the word but he was not
[1:34:32] counted as a mouth
[1:34:38] okay
[1:34:40] God commanded
[1:34:43] he gave the word but what was the what
[1:34:47] coming how was it coming by the handoff
[1:34:52] not by the mouth
[1:34:57] Glory oh God so the prophet Moses was
[1:35:01] not the mouth of God
[1:35:03] he was the mouth of God for in another
[1:35:06] angle but God describing him he says the
[1:35:10] hand
[1:35:12] is there somebody ready with the
[1:35:14] levitical numbers 4 49
[1:35:17] numbers 449 I want to just prove this
[1:35:20] point
[1:35:27] by the hand of Moses
[1:35:33] um
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:42] buy the handoff
[1:35:46] number 16 40. I just want to prove this
[1:35:53] number 16 verse 40 says to be a memorial
[1:35:57] and the children of Israel that no
[1:36:00] stranger which is not of the seed of
[1:36:03] Aaron come near to offer incense before
[1:36:06] the Lord and he be not a scorer and as
[1:36:10] his company as the Lord said to him by
[1:36:15] the hand of Moses
[1:36:18] amen
[1:36:20] look them up
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:26] chapter 27 verse 23 just ahead of there
[1:36:29] chapter 27 verse 23 let's see what the
[1:36:32] Bible again says chapter 23 verse 23 I
[1:36:35] mean 27 verse 23 he says and he laid his
[1:36:39] hands upon him and he gave him church as
[1:36:42] the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses
[1:36:53] so Moses
[1:36:55] the way God looked at Moses yes my
[1:36:59] brother Moses was God his hand
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:04] because Moses
[1:37:07] became a god
[1:37:09] says I've made here God to Pharaoh
[1:37:11] that's right
[1:37:14] glory to God and now you're going to
[1:37:16] make my word come to pass whatever you
[1:37:19] say we have got the road of authority
[1:37:22] when you say it and vindicate it you say
[1:37:24] it I confirm it you say it I confirm it
[1:37:28] when you lift up your hand I'll come
[1:37:30] down whatever you say you have become a
[1:37:33] partner
[1:37:35] you become a partner with me
[1:37:37] we are Gods together we are joint heirs
[1:37:41] together
[1:37:42] we share their Glory we share their
[1:37:45] power which because
[1:37:48] I am not coming down there to do the

[1:38:30] the Third Exodus and we have also got a
[1:38:33] prophet
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:39] no
[1:38:41] the god of William Branham was not a god
[1:38:43] of History
[1:38:44] he was not a man who preached and
[1:38:47] preached and spoke and spoke and there
[1:38:49] was no manifestation he was not pleading
[1:38:52] and praying and fasting and seeking and
[1:38:54] crying he spoke to God God was his
[1:38:58] friend
[1:39:00] it happened
[1:39:05] brother Branham was God his hand
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:10] glory to God
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:13] Miracles upon miracles signs and wonders

[1:39:51] but when it begins to happen
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:39:56] when it begins to happen
[1:39:58] you are God's hand
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:03] he that receives the prophet in the name
[1:40:07] of a prophet receives the prophet's
[1:40:09] reward
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:17] so
[1:40:20] Hallelujah
[1:40:22] so Moses
[1:40:24] sees the being just the goddess
[1:40:26] mouthpiece
[1:40:29] he was the hand
[1:40:33] in other words it was the word together
[1:40:36] with manifestation coming together
[1:40:39] working simultaneously
[1:40:42] the word and the manifestation the word
[1:40:47] and the fruits the word and its Glory
[1:40:51] the word and its power the word and His
[1:40:55] glory coming together we are now the
[1:40:59] mother of twins the twins are to be born
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:04] the Dynamics upon the mechanics not only
[1:41:07] mechanics not only mechanics but the
[1:41:11] Dynamics coming the twins must be born
[1:41:14] and when the twins are born
[1:41:16] you are the hand of God
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:25] Glory
[1:41:26] [Applause]
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:37] oh
[1:41:38] my Hallelujah
[1:41:44] so the logos the prophet says
[1:41:48] the locus he comes here and says that's
[1:41:52] a good one Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:41:57] is not with me only
[1:42:04] it is with you
[1:42:06] this is the prophet saying
[1:42:09] how many believe it is theirs
[1:42:12] the holy spirit is Not only was not only
[1:42:14] with the prophet
[1:42:16] the bit of fire you know when I talk
[1:42:19] about a pillow fire
[1:42:21] there are those people who say that said
[1:42:23] no go area brother Abraham
[1:42:27] the pillow fire only appears to Prophets
[1:42:32] I have got enemies for that and I
[1:42:35] accommodate with him
[1:42:37] I'm ready
[1:42:39] to be called anything but I thank God
[1:42:42] that I've seen the pillow fire
[1:42:48] if I've not seen the pillow fire then I
[1:42:51] don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:54] the pillow fire is what led the children
[1:42:57] of Israel in the first Exodus
[1:43:02] and the prophet says that same Holy
[1:43:05] Spirit and that's why he says that's a
[1:43:07] good one
[1:43:12] that Holy Spirit is not only Within Me
[1:43:14] is he with you
[1:43:16] it just appeared there
[1:43:19] when the Bible teaches that the children
[1:43:21] of Israel was brought out of Egypt what
[1:43:24] happened there was a pure fire that
[1:43:26] followed them
[1:43:28] it wasn't the children of Israel that
[1:43:31] done the miracle it was the pit of fire
[1:43:34] that he followed him
[1:43:36] is that right
[1:43:38] how many knows that that was the angel
[1:43:40] of the Covenant
[1:43:42] the angel of the Covenant the logos
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:50] that same one that spoke of the word the
[1:43:53] angel of the Covenant coming down
[1:43:57] with a rainbow
[1:43:59] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:44:03] a dispensational angel he's coming
[1:44:07] he's coming because he has a covenant
[1:44:15] hey
[1:44:16] glory to God
[1:44:19] so to those who don't have the Covenant
[1:44:21] with him they will not see him
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:25] those who are not in the mouth
[1:44:28] those who have been spewed out
[1:44:30] they will not understand it
[1:44:34] you remember Sister
[1:44:36] what we talked about the other day
[1:44:39] it is a deal between the thief and the
[1:44:41] stolen
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:47] people are saying oh they have stolen
[1:44:50] something they have stolen but their
[1:44:52] stolen is very happy
[1:44:55] behold I come as a thief
[1:44:58] [Applause]
[1:45:03] so the others will call him a thief but
[1:45:06] their stolen is very happy because she's
[1:45:09] part of the deal
[1:45:11] she's happy being stolen
[1:45:14] she's very happy she's calling you home
[1:45:17] the one who is telling him stalling her
[1:45:20] is her friend is her husband
[1:45:24] is the Angel of the Covenant is
[1:45:26] fulfilling the Covenant
[1:45:29] but the others is a thief
[1:45:31] [Applause]
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:37] oh God
[1:45:40] so they fear their logos they fear the
[1:45:43] whole they pit on fire they fear is
[1:45:45] Supernatural
[1:45:46] Abraham
[1:45:50] I I when you go that area of this
[1:45:52] financial the Miracles the power of God
[1:45:54] I begin to fear my body begins to think
[1:45:58] I said come on do you have some bunch of
[1:46:01] demons in you I cast them out
[1:46:04] because if your blood begins to think
[1:46:07] because of the pill of fire because of
[1:46:09] this financial something is wrong
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:15] tell me when did God ever bring a
[1:46:18] message and he never proved that he's
[1:46:20] the one
[1:46:23] [Applause]
[1:46:25] and how can you doubt
[1:46:28] what was spoken when you were there and
[1:46:32] you were in the mouth shouting
[1:46:34] Hallelujah saying amen saying so be it
[1:46:39] and you say it when my time to be on
[1:46:43] Earth shall come
[1:46:44] I Will Rejoice at that word in my time
[1:46:48] and according to what I know you agreed
[1:46:52] with God my brother to be here now you
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:56] you are in the right time
[1:46:58] you even live in the right place
[1:47:01] you are with the right person
[1:47:05] you are the one who can manage that
[1:47:07] husband
[1:47:08] you are the one who can manage that
[1:47:10] woman
[1:47:11] you are the one who can manage the day
[1:47:13] in the demons in the neighborhood
[1:47:15] don't start complaining
[1:47:20] yeah
[1:47:21] nothing is in you
[1:47:24] you have just forgotten
[1:47:26] [Applause]
[1:47:30] you have just forgotten
[1:47:34] but now when you will be reminded
[1:47:37] that's why Peter says it behooved me to
[1:47:40] Star you into remembrance
[1:47:45] although you asking you this
[1:47:49] [Laughter]
[1:47:52] you once knew it
[1:47:57] so the devil doesn't want people who are
[1:48:02] on the implementation side
[1:48:05] he wants a God who just speaks
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:11] and he knows the easiest thing is to
[1:48:14] make you disobey
[1:48:18] but when you you know what is being
[1:48:21] spoken
[1:48:23] I remember it was spoken I was there
[1:48:27] my name is I can hear there
[1:48:30] I can't even hear myself screaming
[1:48:33] Hallelujah
[1:48:35] hey do you know why you say Amen you are
[1:48:39] just echoing back what you said in that
[1:48:41] life
[1:48:47] echoing back
[1:48:50] what you said
[1:48:52] when that word was spoken
[1:48:58] so the devil has no problem you coming
[1:49:01] here
[1:49:02] sitting listening and then you can go
[1:49:05] back home and doubt
[1:49:11] he has no problem
[1:49:12] let me bring something here again the
[1:49:15] prophet said
[1:49:17] what turns hell or loose
[1:49:21] what turned the hell or lose in the days
[1:49:24] of the Apostles our fathers
[1:49:28] the Holy Ghost fell down and they all
[1:49:30] Pentecost
[1:49:32] the devil didn't bother
[1:49:35] that's the prophet now I have a quote on
[1:49:37] that
[1:49:38] says three three thousand people got
[1:49:41] saved and they were baptized and they
[1:49:44] didn't even the devil didn't move
[1:49:49] he remained in his chair
[1:50:00] and today
[1:50:02] I honest I told one brother recently one
[1:50:04] fellow Pastor I said on our forums we
[1:50:08] want to show we we baptized so many
[1:50:11] people in our church
[1:50:12] so many believed in our church
[1:50:15] and we put baptismal pictures on the
[1:50:18] ministerial forums to show that God is
[1:50:21] moving in our church so many people God
[1:50:24] saved so many people were baptized
[1:50:27] so many people received the Holy Ghost
[1:50:29] that's not what bothers the devil
[1:50:36] what makes the devil shaken
[1:50:40] is when God comes and proves
[1:50:43] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:50:45] forever
[1:50:48] when the Spanish was manifested on the
[1:50:52] lemon man
[1:50:55] when Paul Peter and German and John
[1:50:58] picked up the lemon and say gold and
[1:51:01] silver we don't have but what we have we
[1:51:04] give you in the name of Jesus of
[1:51:06] Nazareth rise up
[1:51:08] all hell was dandelus
[1:51:13] they were beaten they were imprisoned
[1:51:16] their past tuition started and the
[1:51:19] church went back to ask for more power
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:24] they prayed again
[1:51:26] they realized they didn't have enough
[1:51:31] [Applause]
[1:51:32] so the devil is blinding us somewhere
[1:51:37] when you watch on forums baptisms we
[1:51:40] baptized 20 we baptized we baptized the
[1:51:44] penny today and we put on the forums and
[1:51:47] then the Emojis of clapping man oh God
[1:51:49] bless you brother you did it hey brother
[1:51:53] we have got a very big church
[1:51:56] may have got 500 we have got 300 and the
[1:52:00] devil doesn't even get off his chair
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:06] the devil is looking at you
[1:52:08] he doesn't care whether you are one
[1:52:11] thousand two thousand whether you speak
[1:52:14] in tongues and dance around
[1:52:16] whether you baptize a hundred the devil
[1:52:19] doesn't move he's waiting for the
[1:52:21] manifestation of the hand
[1:52:24] [Applause]
[1:52:27] that's what shakes the devil that's what
[1:52:31] upsets the devil and that should be my
[1:52:34] focus
[1:52:38] I am looking for that
[1:52:40] which makes the devil annoyed
[1:52:46] Glory oh God
[1:52:48] yeah
[1:52:52] so today remind yourself here that I was
[1:52:55] both in the mouth and I'm in the hand
[1:52:58] what is Cinema can handle both can
[1:53:02] handle the word when the word is
[1:53:04] preached when the promises are
[1:53:06] identified when the teaching is done now
[1:53:10] the next is me again to make the word
[1:53:12] become a reality it's me now it's my
[1:53:17] time
[1:53:18] devil you are not going to cheat to me
[1:53:22] I'm not going to live before my
[1:53:24] privileges
[1:53:28] Glory oh God to whom
[1:53:31] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:53:35] to who not so many
[1:53:41] they say I've got the revelation of the
[1:53:44] word good
[1:53:45] what about the hand
[1:53:48] what about the arm
[1:53:50] which brings it to pass
[1:53:53] all the preaching was good we have a
[1:53:56] good preacher we have God we hear good
[1:53:58] summons wonderful what about manifesting
[1:54:02] it
[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:08] what about manifesting it
[1:54:12] hallelujah oh Jesus is the same
[1:54:16] yesterday and forever that is good
[1:54:19] the word is true that is good God is
[1:54:21] under Prophet that's good and because we
[1:54:25] are failing to hit the jackpot
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:31] because we are failing
[1:54:34] we are losing Steam
[1:54:37] [Applause]
[1:54:41] until you hit there
[1:54:43] you are not complete
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:46] [Applause]
[1:54:49] you are half-baked
[1:54:51] you are not a finished product
[1:54:54] and that's why God has kept you sister
[1:54:56] that's why God has kept you brother you
[1:54:59] are here to hit the jackpot
[1:55:04] one of these days one of these days you
[1:55:08] don't need even a pastor to pray for you
[1:55:09] you don't need brother so and so pray
[1:55:12] for you you need to see
[1:55:15] you are named in the fingers in the palm
[1:55:19] of God and you know I am part of his
[1:55:22] hand
[1:55:24] and
[1:55:26] his hand is not shorted that it has only
[1:55:30] ended with the Pastor Stephen
[1:55:32] his hand is not a shot that he has only
[1:55:35] ended with sister so and so
[1:55:38] I should not be there to share
[1:55:40] testimonies of others
[1:55:41] God is not a god of partiality he is an
[1:55:45] impartial God
[1:55:47] what he has done for you he can do for
[1:55:50] me what he can stand for this one he can
[1:55:53] do for you he loves us all
[1:55:57] oh

[1:56:00] the devil wants you to sit in a corner
[1:56:03] and you feel like for me in my corner
[1:56:06] God his hand cannot reach you there
[1:56:09] it's not God's hand you are supposed to
[1:56:12] be the hand

[1:56:17] you are the aunt
[1:56:20] he has already reached me there
[1:56:22] you just have to exercise what you are
[1:56:27] and tell the devil tell the devil I am
[1:56:31] the word manifesting machine
[1:56:33] I am the what but the word must be
[1:56:36] quickened the healing must be quickened
[1:56:38] the power must be quickened
[1:56:41] the glory of God in Me
[1:56:44] the virtue of God in Me
[1:56:46] my God is not a powerless God he's a god
[1:56:50] of power he's a god of matter he's the
[1:56:52] god of Glory he's a god of healing he's
[1:56:55] the hand has come up to me the hand is
[1:56:59] here and it is not short that it cannot
[1:57:02] save me
[1:57:05] what is serving
[1:57:07] the Lord his hand is not shortened that
[1:57:11] it cannot save what is to serve the
[1:57:14] Greek word is Isuzu
[1:57:20] serve though he will be both physically
[1:57:24] and spiritually
[1:57:27] full package
[1:57:35] Glory oh God
[1:57:37] the logos the angel of the Covenant
[1:57:42] he loves it fulfilling his word in you
[1:57:46] than anything else
[1:57:49] Glory oh God
[1:57:54] he says then that was Christ
[1:57:58] the logos the Morning Star
[1:58:01] the alpha
[1:58:03] omega he came to the Earth he was seen
[1:58:06] many times and in what we call
[1:58:09] I guess a few funny that was back in the
[1:58:12] early Testament where they seen this
[1:58:15] form this inform of a man
[1:58:18] talking about Melchizedek and so forth
[1:58:20] but he was made flesh amen and dwelt
[1:58:23] Among Us
[1:58:24] the fullness of God dwelt in him
[1:58:27] all right
[1:58:28] then he said a little while the world
[1:58:32] won't see me no more you yet you'll see
[1:58:35] me for be with you is that right is that
[1:58:38] right what
[1:58:41] God
[1:58:44] he says
[1:58:46] I go to God is that right then he came
[1:58:50] from what the pill of fire is that right
[1:58:54] then he returned to what the pin off
[1:58:57] fire
[1:59:02] when Paul was on his run down to
[1:59:04] Damascus that a pit of fire made him and
[1:59:07] struck him blind
[1:59:11] why did he strike him blind
[1:59:13] because he had a lot of moss
[1:59:20] had to be dealt with the fast
[1:59:23] get blind before you can see
[1:59:28] become foolish before you can understand
[1:59:32] laughs
[1:59:35] get sick before you can receive the
[1:59:37] healing
[1:59:39] okay
[1:59:43] is that right he said soul soul why past
[1:59:46] you just tell me he said he said Lord if
[1:59:49] you notice that Capital means Elohim
[1:59:52] Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus the
[1:59:55] pillow fire
[1:59:57] [Laughter]
[2:00:00] and here he is in the last days before
[2:00:03] his visible appearance
[2:00:05] sinning for the spirit so dominant
[2:00:08] eh
[2:00:10] here he is
[2:00:12] in these last days just before he is
[2:00:16] visible appearance
[2:00:19] sending forth his spirit so dominant
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:26] so dominant
[2:00:28] and so real until they even took a
[2:00:32] picture of it
[2:00:36] here it comes into the church
[2:00:39] can do it now by the help of the Holy
[2:00:42] Ghost there can't be a secret on your
[2:00:45] heart but what it can reveal the Bible
[2:00:48] said
[2:00:49] and then he comes here and he says there
[2:00:52] it is
[2:00:54] it isn't me
[2:00:56] it isn't you
[2:00:58] it is him
[2:01:01] so what are we
[2:01:05] [Applause]
[2:01:07] when I look at you it isn't you when you
[2:01:11] look at me it is sent to me
[2:01:18] so forget about you

[2:01:24] work I have suffered I have done this I
[2:01:28] am I am I am I have weak Faith Lord I I
[2:01:33] it isn't you it isn't me it is him
[2:01:40] thank you
[2:01:43] Glory oh God
[2:01:45] [Applause]
[2:01:47] come to that
[2:01:49] reckon with that accept that brother it
[2:01:53] is unto you
[2:01:54] so if they want to cast they are not
[2:01:56] going to cast you you are no longer
[2:01:59] there how can they cast Christ
[2:02:02] how can they cast the arm of Deliverance
[2:02:09] Glory
[2:02:11] it isn't me it isn't you it is him that
[2:02:16] is the pit of fire that he follows is
[2:02:18] the Holy Spirit the Lord of Heaven the
[2:02:20] Lord goes the Jesus Christ the alpha the
[2:02:24] Omega he that was which is shall come
[2:02:27] the root and offspring of David the
[2:02:30] Morning Star the I am the Father the Son

[2:02:36] of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting
[2:02:38] father the wonderful one that is him
[2:02:42] you couldn't find enough titles to tell
[2:02:45] him
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:53] Lord oh God
[2:02:59] so he says
[2:03:00] aha
[2:03:04] Glory oh God so he was God the logos the
[2:03:09] one that went out of God they when it
[2:03:12] began to brood upon the Earth
[2:03:16] get it and they brought forth marine
[2:03:19] life
[2:03:22] when the spirit of God the logos the
[2:03:25] world which was which God said let there
[2:03:28] be
[2:03:30] and they are went the logos which is the
[2:03:34] word
[2:03:35] cause all this was in the Locust the
[2:03:39] Hall of creation
[2:03:43] all that God created and so that it is
[2:03:46] good
[2:03:49] was in the logos
[2:03:55] the whole word of God the Holy Bible for
[2:03:59] every age and as the logos begin to
[2:04:01] breathe upon the Earth there came forth
[2:04:03] marine life
[2:04:04] building up bad life
[2:04:07] and no one up to animal life and finally
[2:04:10] there come something in the
[2:04:12] representation
[2:04:14] or looked like the thing that was
[2:04:16] brewing it Brewing over it
[2:04:20] gold a man in the very image of God
[2:04:28] now God
[2:04:30] then comma a man in the very image of
[2:04:33] God
[2:04:37] that is the masterpiece
[2:04:40] of the logos
[2:04:48] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:04:50] let me just come to something here
[2:04:58] when God speaks forth his word
[2:05:03] and every spoken word of God must
[2:05:06] be fulfilled
[2:05:10] he speaks all his promises and his word
[2:05:13] through his mouth we have said that
[2:05:16] and every true or Genuine believer is
[2:05:19] residing in his mouth
[2:05:20] unless if or when he was spewed out
[2:05:24] because of lucumsy
[2:05:28] then when time comes God fulfills the
[2:05:31] same Spoken Word by his hand
[2:05:34] and as we have proven every
[2:05:36] predestinated child of God is engraved
[2:05:39] in the palms of his hands
[2:05:46] I want you to look at this
[2:05:50] [Applause]
[2:05:54] when you get down to that now and let
[2:05:57] your faith rest solemnly
[2:06:01] not upon a man not upon theologies of
[2:06:04] man not upon church denominations
[2:06:08] as good as they are as good as money is
[2:06:11] let your faith rest alone in Christ is
[2:06:14] finished work
[2:06:16] at Calvary
[2:06:19] for both sin and salvation you see it
[2:06:24] rest there
[2:06:28] notice
[2:06:30] let me go down here
[2:06:33] he says that's where you ought to have
[2:06:35] faith
[2:06:37] if you believe this to be God is
[2:06:39] internal unchangeable word
[2:06:43] then every precept that has been spoken
[2:06:46] God's word is a seed and everything that
[2:06:49] God has spoke of in the word is already
[2:06:53] confirmed in glory
[2:06:58] is already confirmed in
[2:07:03] and it's been given to you listen to
[2:07:06] this it has been given to you to act
[2:07:09] upon
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:18] I wish I could scream now but I don't
[2:07:21] have
[2:07:27] been given to you
[2:07:29] to act
[2:07:31] upon
[2:07:36] that's why the prophet says when you
[2:07:38] come to recognize Who You Are
[2:07:41] and the authority that is invested in
[2:07:44] you
[2:07:45] you will serve God and yourself a lot of
[2:07:48] trouble
[2:07:52] so we are giving God a lot of
[2:07:54] unwarranted trouble
[2:07:57] because we don't know that God has
[2:07:59] already given us to act
[2:08:04] and then you are crying back to him
[2:08:08] God do this God help me God you are the
[2:08:12] hand
[2:08:14] [Applause]
[2:08:20] let just that hand be uneved
[2:08:27] you have folded your hand a long time
[2:08:31] and you want Jesus to do it for you
[2:08:36] don't
[2:08:40] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:08:46] before I came I think it was just like a
[2:08:49] few days before I came
[2:08:52] they bring a younger girl of about 15
[2:08:54] years she's a daughter of a deliver
[2:08:57] refuse to believe
[2:08:59] also
[2:09:02] and then she comes from school and she's
[2:09:04] like upset and complaining of a headache
[2:09:07] and
[2:09:08] in in bad spirits and he's not willing
[2:09:11] to talk to parents and she's by herself
[2:09:13] and then all of a sudden she picks a
[2:09:16] better sheet and climbs to the roof of
[2:09:18] the house inside there and she wants to
[2:09:20] commit suicide
[2:09:22] and they claimed After High and he tried
[2:09:24] to pull this from her and she stuck
[2:09:27] in there like she's really bolted to the
[2:09:29] woods up there
[2:09:32] and the parents seat and the neighbors
[2:09:34] watching her the whole night
[2:09:37] to the next to them then they bring her
[2:09:39] my place you know in that kind of
[2:09:41] condition just bound and she's just not
[2:09:44] speaking but just crying she wants to
[2:09:46] die
[2:09:50] and then the mother will say well we see
[2:09:52] me and my husband you know we serve the
[2:09:54] Lord and we are believing we have been
[2:09:57] praying for her
[2:10:00] I said the whole thing is simple
[2:10:02] this is now not a baby
[2:10:06] this is now a mature girl
[2:10:09] she's 15 years
[2:10:12] you are not going to do a religion for
[2:10:14] her
[2:10:19] and that's the problem
[2:10:21] I was even wanting some Rivers they even
[2:10:24] tell their children don't get saved yet
[2:10:26] don't go and accept Jesus because time
[2:10:29] can come and you fail and then you come
[2:10:32] back to church it will be a problem blah
[2:10:34] blah blah
[2:10:36] foreign
[2:10:41] I said I was asking the church you think
[2:10:44] God who saved me at 13 years was was not
[2:10:47] reasoning
[2:10:49] he called me when I was 13.
[2:10:53] why didn't he wait for me to strike 17
[2:10:55] 18.
[2:11:01] there were the things you know they want
[2:11:03] a religion done for them
[2:11:05] go around the world
[2:11:07] you know what is what is happening in
[2:11:09] the churches
[2:11:11] there's somebody that prays for the
[2:11:12] church and opens the service
[2:11:15] another brother comes with praise
[2:11:18] maybe for the offerings and so forth and
[2:11:21] prayer requests and then a preacher
[2:11:23] comes and prays and preaches and after
[2:11:25] preaching he prays and goes and you sit
[2:11:28] there dumb
[2:11:32] [Applause]
[2:11:34] and then the pastor has left the prophet
[2:11:37] and is inviting the song leader to
[2:11:39] dismiss the congregation
[2:11:42] what relationship is this between the
[2:11:45] so-called bride
[2:11:46] the bridey groom speaks and for you you
[2:11:49] came you are quiet you have not spoken
[2:11:52] to him you are going back home
[2:11:55] and the pastors are becoming like
[2:11:57] priests
[2:11:59] doing for people religion
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:07] you are supposed to speak to your father
[2:12:10] you are supposed to speak to your God
[2:12:14] when you come to church
[2:12:17] it's called The House of Prayer
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:22] how can you come to the house of prayer
[2:12:25] and you go you have not prayed
[2:12:27] [Applause]
[2:12:33] because there's somebody that prayed for
[2:12:35] me that they couldn't pray they for the
[2:12:37] offerings the pastor prayed before he
[2:12:39] preached and after preaching the pastor
[2:12:41] prayed for us and then the pastor called
[2:12:44] the song leader and dismissed us
[2:12:46] where are you coming from the House of
[2:12:49] Prayer

[2:15:28] I said the problem with you and your
[2:15:30] husband you were doing a religion for
[2:15:33] your family
[2:15:34] but these children have outgrown the
[2:15:37] level of protection by the blood of the
[2:15:39] parents of the grace they are now mature
[2:15:43] they are having girlfriends and
[2:15:45] boyfriends and you are telling them my

[2:16:15] mother is a good prayer Warrior
[2:16:17] and you
[2:16:22] whatever they did they were training you
[2:16:26] praying up a child in a way should grow
[2:16:31] how are you going to offset all these
[2:16:33] demons that are marauding around
[2:16:35] [Applause]
[2:16:36] yeah
[2:16:38] [Applause]
[2:16:39] the devil is not joking
[2:16:44] that's where you ought to have faith
[2:16:46] if you believe this to be God is
[2:16:49] internal unchangeable what then every
[2:16:51] precept that has been spoken in God's
[2:16:53] word is a seed and everything that God
[2:16:56] has spoken of in his word he's already
[2:16:58] confirmed in glory and it has been given
[2:17:00] to you
[2:17:02] to act upon
[2:17:08] then he says so don't be afraid to take
[2:17:13] any face
[2:17:15] of God is internal blessed word
[2:17:19] and a phrase
[2:17:21] and a face
[2:17:23] and a statement
[2:17:25] get out of it
[2:17:27] stick to it say it claim it call on it
[2:17:32] don't be afraid
[2:17:36] act on it you are the hand now you are
[2:17:40] God's hand extended now
[2:17:42] glory to God
[2:17:44] [Applause]
[2:17:49] anchor it in your heart
[2:17:52] Glory oh God
[2:17:57] I have to find a way to finish now
[2:18:00] I'm finished
[2:18:01] [Laughter]
[2:18:05] he says
[2:18:07] now Faith is ridiculous
[2:18:11] to everybody
[2:18:13] else apart from God and the one who has
[2:18:15] it
[2:18:17] so don't be afraid to be ridiculous
[2:18:23] now it's not ridiculous to God because
[2:18:26] he's the oath of faith it's not the
[2:18:28] ridiculous the man that has faith
[2:18:31] because he's a believer in God so it
[2:18:33] isn't ridiculous to him God is the
[2:18:36] author of Faith he created it and a man
[2:18:38] who received it from God
[2:18:40] Faith was delivered
[2:18:42] we are talking about the faith that you
[2:18:44] manufacture in your intellectual realms
[2:18:47] intellectual faith
[2:18:50] I think I preached about that one time
[2:18:54] the transformation of faith
[2:18:58] it's the faith of God
[2:19:01] so he says that's why the Bible says we
[2:19:04] contend for the faith that was worse
[2:19:06] delivered
[2:19:09] it was delivered by a delivery fun
[2:19:16] and the delivery funding that delivered
[2:19:18] the faith was Jesus Christ and Jesus is
[2:19:21] the faith himself
[2:19:22] [Applause]
[2:19:24] it was manufactured in heaven
[2:19:27] created by God then he put in a delivery
[2:19:31] fund and he handed over to the Saints
[2:19:34] now we are here to contend
[2:19:40] [Applause]
[2:19:44] maybe I'm sounding ridiculous
[2:19:46] [Music]
[2:19:53] uh
[2:19:54] cause it isn't ridiculous to God because
[2:19:57] he created it he knows what it is and
[2:19:59] they believe the Lord receives it it is
[2:20:01] it it isn't ridiculous to him because by
[2:20:04] that is the substance of things hoped
[2:20:06] for the evidence of things they can't
[2:20:08] see test feel smell or hear but he knows
[2:20:10] it is there
[2:20:13] so it is not ridiculous
[2:20:17] and and then he says he don't have to
[2:20:19] worry about anything
[2:20:21] anything about it he knows God told it
[2:20:24] God decided and that is enough
[2:20:27] God told you to go to say it and that is
[2:20:30] enough and it's part of God and he was
[2:20:32] part of the mouth
[2:20:34] and he's not spewed out of the mouth
[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:39] so he's part of the mouth and his part
[2:20:41] of the hand
[2:20:41] [Music]
[2:20:42] [Applause]
[2:20:43] so he's everywhere you are both in the
[2:20:46] hand you are both in the mouth
[2:20:52] merry goodness
[2:20:55] glory be to God
[2:21:04] so he says
[2:21:06] he's bringing loud this is
[2:21:09] in this age God is saying I'll spew you
[2:21:12] from my mouth this church age will be
[2:21:15] rejected there will be just a Remnant
[2:21:17] out of it that will be saved so better
[2:21:19] mark yourself write good to find out if
[2:21:23] you are in that Remnant now
[2:21:28] The Remnant that remains in the mouth
[2:21:32] amen amen
[2:21:35] amen the rest are spewed
[2:21:49] so because they are out of the mouth
[2:21:52] that spoke the word
[2:21:54] they don't have the authority
[2:21:59] to be part of the hand
[2:22:03] because the mouth
[2:22:05] is on the intelligence here
[2:22:08] the brain that commands the hand
[2:22:12] what to do when to do it how
[2:22:21] okay so when you are out of the command
[2:22:25] center
[2:22:28] the hand gets paralyzed
[2:22:35] and they paralyze the hand can do
[2:22:38] nothing
[2:22:43] oh brother these things of this
[2:22:45] financial a brother these things of
[2:22:46] Jesus healing these things of Jesus
[2:22:49] speaking I hear they must tell us
[2:22:51] brother
[2:22:52] I only know about healing we believe a
[2:22:55] message
[2:22:57] what message
[2:23:01] what is this message
[2:23:04] this message is alive
[2:23:10] without that life you don't believe the
[2:23:12] message
[2:23:13] [Applause]
[2:23:17] this message is Jesus Christ
[2:23:21] he's the bridegroom
[2:23:23] he's the head
[2:23:26] how can you say you believe the message
[2:23:29] and you don't have the hand that
[2:23:31] performs the message
[2:23:34] is your god deformed
[2:23:40] no my God is Not deformed
[2:23:44] he's a full-bodied God
[2:23:47] he has all the parts
[2:23:49] and I'm glad I'm in the hand
[2:23:51] [Applause]
[2:23:54] so I told the mother I said you knew
[2:23:57] there and the father I said now you Neil
[2:24:01] here
[2:24:03] I said kneel here
[2:24:05] I'm not the one who told you to refuse
[2:24:07] to get saved
[2:24:13] and they laid in my hand on the hand and
[2:24:14] rebuked the spirit and then she could
[2:24:16] come to herself I said now you have to
[2:24:18] accept the Lord if you don't this demon
[2:24:21] still has a certificate
[2:24:26] to get back
[2:24:28] and I'm not going to be your guarantor

[2:39:20] God pray all night night prayers these
[2:39:25] days I cast
[2:39:30] [Music]
[2:39:32] I've seen it in many places and and one
[2:39:35] believer was telling for us since we
[2:39:37] have ever been in a church we have never
[2:39:39] had a night prayer
[2:39:43] is saying
[2:39:46] pray all night it doesn't even mean
[2:39:49] night prayer for the church but nightly
[2:39:51] prayer for you in your house you can
[2:39:53] pray
[2:39:55] yeah
[2:39:57] in your house
[2:40:01] laying out in the corn fields and things
[2:40:04] why you can't sit in the church 30
[2:40:07] minutes without grumbling and growling
[2:40:13] laodicea is upon you
[2:40:16] it's a preacher also

[2:40:35] we we are going
[2:40:37] I may be the Rapture tomorrow solo

[2:40:45] when you can't sit 30 minutes you begin
[2:40:49] grumbling feeling an easy uncomfortable
[2:40:53] some stomach exciting why
[2:40:56] those demons begin to be activated
[2:40:59] because you are out of tune with God
