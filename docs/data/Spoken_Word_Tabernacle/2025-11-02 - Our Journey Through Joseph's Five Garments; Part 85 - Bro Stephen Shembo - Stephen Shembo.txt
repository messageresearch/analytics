I said, "Don't don't say no more about him. Let him go. I want to ask you a question." He said, "All right. What is it?" I said, "Do you believe there is a God?" He said, "Certainly, I believe it." Said, "I believe that as strong as you do, I guess, Brother Brandon." I said, "Do you believe that that same God crossed the stream and was made flesh and dwelt among us in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save man?" He said, "Yes, I believe that. and he died to save sinners like you are. Like I Yes, I believe that. I said, "Now, it's just like this. We're all in one big building over here and we're in jail and I can't stand over in this corner and say, "This will help me get out of jail."

I do have a couple of praise reports here this morning. First off, the Fali and the Peters family would like to thank everyone and express their sincere thanks and gratitude to all who came out to support the wedding shower for Sister Yokth yesterday. Your fellowship, your words of encouragement and willing hands were truly a blessing. We uh deeply appreciate every act of love that was shown. We pray that the Lord continues to bless each and every one of you as our dear sister enters this season, new season of her life with love and gratitude. Amen. Praise God. Let's give the Lord a hand for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. [applause] Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So, I have one here from my daughter Rebecca as well. She said Thursday morning at 5:00 a.m. uh she woke up with UTI symptoms. Um while she was getting ready for work, uh she while she was getting ready for work, she said, "I just talked to the Lord." Said, "Lord, it's too late to call out, you know, um or to go to the doctor, so please just take it away in Jesus name." Chris said, "In Jesus name." &gt;&gt; Amen. And she says she's had no memory of it since that point. &gt;&gt; So, she went to work all day and had no more symptoms. Amen. [applause] Amen. I guess that's a pretty unpleasant symptoms. Not sure if I've ever had it, but um I meant to give a little one about my wife on on uh Wednesday when everybody was giving theirs. She's had a she's had some of her wisdom teeth cut out, but not all. And she's had one that's been bothering her for I guess three or four months. She'd just bite down wrong on some food and it would just, you know, shoot the pain through her. And I said, "Well, we she doesn't want to bother our pastor. She feels like he's gotten up on his plate. So, [laughter] so that's true. So, I said, "Well, while you're down in Panama, just have somebody check it out." So, she went and had an X-ray done and they checked it all out for $20. That was kind of why I suggested it, too. But, um, she said that they didn't find anything. So, no updates. I guess everything's fine in her tooth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That That's a very unpleasant thing as well. Anybody, especially an abscess, that hurts. [laughter] Amen. I can't get no amen from the singer. Amen. Okay. So, we got a couple of prayer requests. Um, I do want to uh mention my wife again. She has, you know, it's a big family down there. Her mom had 11 on her side. I don't even remember 10 or 11 on her dad's side. So, family just showing up and she had an 80 yearear-old cousin show up from Panama City who's is not in the greatest of health and he's staying a week. So, in addition to caring for her mom and dad and on Sundays the help is not there because they take their day off. So, um, it's just her and her sister from Montreal today with three elderly, one that has to go from the wheelchair to the bed to the bathroom, back and back and back and forth, back and forth. So, we're just asking to continue to pray for my wife, please. She's got about a week and a half left, and I think she's stressing out more now on what's going to happen when her and her sister go back, you know, here into Canada. uh and because she's just leaving it with really two working sisters that that do a lot and one of them is currently in Boston. So, um please remember her. Um we're still looking for a miracle. She said, "This old man that showed up is a Christian. He's been witnessing to her mother because they're all family." And she said, "I'm getting some good conversation with him about the Bible and all." And I said, "Well, you two talk about it. Jesus has got to show up just like he did on the road to Emmas." I said, "So, we'll just pray for God's will when he gets there." Amen. We also have a prayer here from uh Brother John handed me a card this morning. Um pray for uh Miss Alicia. Uh she's been put on hospice care. Amen. Brother John, why don't you come on up and lead us this morning with as we stand and um we'll make it kind of personal for you with Miss Alicia. and Jesus just saw as you live. Thank you Lord.

Our cood church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening or reading the message of brother Brandham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that when I read here, it's already clicking on you. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we're ready to sw together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Question and answer for next year. Brother Glenn will be still working on it. Youngsman meeting. It's November 8th and December 6 backto back. If you cannot make it, you know how to find the deacon after and go watch the the the video to make sure everybody stays on the same page. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Married couple meeting. It's part eight. will be on December the 13th. We get on finances the second part prayer meeting on Tuesday. Every Tuesday 7:00 wonderful prayer meeting. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Looks like we should have started that a long time ago. But to everything there is a season, &gt;&gt; but the season have started. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So prayer meeting on Tuesday. So make sure you got the link. It's the same link. We reuse that link over and over. And I begin to find out this one is not in the group chat. If you're not in the church group chat, it's your responsibility to see the deacon and tell them to incorporate you in the church group chat because every time I'm sending quotes and I'm sending scripture, you're missing everything and before you know it, you wonder. So, make sure you're there. And uh in the in the group chat, if you're not there, the building, you continue to pray, continue to do what you got to do. And the Lord is on our side. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert spoke to me about the scent in Jamaica and the people that are uh has been hit pretty hard with this uh hurricane. So, whatever you have at home that you can help. Maybe a cup, maybe a tissue, maybe a napkin or whatever you can that can help the people in Jamaica. Something that you don't need and then you can contribute or something like that. just go ahead and see the deacon and hand it to them. There is a way we can get those stuff all the way to Jamaica to help the people. So if you want to help, you want to bring something, bring it to the church, give it to the deacon and uh they will organize that. There is a way to get stuff to Jamaica. Just give it to the uh I mean a deacon. They know what to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The brothers are in need. Let's try to do what we can and try to help somebody make their life easy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I got everything clear. Brother Glenn, did I forget anything? So you pray with me because I was trying to move forward and I can't move because the spirit of the Lord open up something else. So whatever it was for this Sunday go Sunday what was for that Sunday move that Sunday what was it? So they got sermon and sermon are just sitting there on on a traffic just waiting for their time. Amen. But I have to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. And we have to refocus and balance things correctly because the devil is using ignorance to keep you trapped and accept what is not God's will as God's will and thinking that you are under God's will when you are suffering yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. There was uh a pastor who says uh that they begin to put pressure on the on the country that uh the pastor uh is coming from and he says that he went and closed the church and there was a nail there that say brother Brandham didn't say you will close the church. Uh &gt;&gt; now brother Brandham say they will close the church. Uh so nobody told you to close the church. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; let them come and close the church. So sometime we get things worked up or our own understanding. We didn't study the prophet well and before you know it we cause our own trouble. &gt;&gt; We cause our own trial &gt;&gt; and we think we under the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you would need your Bible. We heard about this before a lot. I don't want to hear from somebody. I want to hear from the Bible &gt;&gt; and I want to hear from the message of the hour. Let the Bible answer itself. So when you leave today, don't say it's already like a law in this church. You never say brother Steven say. You say the Bible says and brother Brandham say amen. &gt;&gt; So you will hear yourself from the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; You agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So flat attendant prepare for takeoff. Amen. Let's stand for the reading of the word. my subject this morning. [laughter] Uh I love spoken word. [laughter] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, again, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, for giving us an extra hour to rest, to sleep, Lord, to come to church refresh and to get ready to listen from thee, Lord. Father, thank you for brothers and sister, people of like precious faith that we can see, we can sit, we can fellowship, we can smile, people that believe like us and people that we will spend all eternity with them, Lord. Father, we thank you for this great privilege that you have given us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it comes to ministering to your children, Father, he only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit because I'm not capable. Father, that's why I'm asking you to come and move me away. Move the audience both visible and invisible out of the place. May you come yourself and be the one speaking, blessing, filling, teaching. And may you minister to us according to our need. We are committing everything and rebuking every demonic spirit contrary to the nature of the Holy Spirit away from this place. May everybody be under the supervision of the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My subject this morning, you can turn to Genesis 1, is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 85, [laughter] &gt;&gt; 8 eternity, five grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme, if we can get to that, is seasons. So decrease the movement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you need the quote, I got a quote. Decrease the movement. Let's stay focused. Season for a forerunner. Forun and prepare. &gt;&gt; Others. In other words, a season forun another season &gt;&gt; and prepare that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you in a season, just know there is another one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not, you're going to miss the next one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis one. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I read that, let me read this quote because I want you to keep this in mind. Brother Brandham says in the message the testimony of a true witness. You can call that title a season for run and prepare another season if you want to. And today that give us a great testimony as a witness of God's creation because that when we are in the season of water, &gt;&gt; mortal life. So this season is a mortal life &gt;&gt; but within this season we got seasons. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; He say in the season of mortal life what do we do there? &gt;&gt; Raising our children &gt;&gt; and doing what? &gt;&gt; Marrying &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Bringing forth families. &gt;&gt; So don't try to be overspiritual. &gt;&gt; Get married. &gt;&gt; Let me leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Oh are we are we in the season of immortal? [screaming] &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; In this season we eat. create. &gt;&gt; So there is a time to go eat. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; There is a time to read the Bible and there is a time to close the Bible &gt;&gt; and go eat natural food. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's when we are in the season of what? &gt;&gt; Mortal life. &gt;&gt; Doing what? &gt;&gt; Raising our children &gt;&gt; and what? marrying &gt;&gt; right sister and doing what? &gt;&gt; Bringing forth families. &gt;&gt; This is a life or the season of water, &gt;&gt; mortal life. &gt;&gt; But when we have been born of above, &gt;&gt; the body does what? &gt;&gt; Returns to the dust where it come &gt;&gt; and then the spirit goes down to where he came from and goes up rather to where he come from to God who did what? &gt;&gt; David. And there will come another water &gt;&gt; season. And that season that will come will be what? &gt;&gt; The immortal season. &gt;&gt; I already gave you this quote. I gave you two of them. I just did this to refresh you. So we got mortal season and immortal season. We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; So there is a season of mortality, mortal and then immortal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Immortal. immortal season. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; But remember one season. &gt;&gt; How many season does brother Brandham say? &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Immortal. &gt;&gt; And remember one season forun. &gt;&gt; We are already in the mortal. &gt;&gt; So the mortal is already forerunning &gt;&gt; and it's also preparing &gt;&gt; for immortality. So you are preparing immortality now. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; You already got the message now. &gt;&gt; We clear now. So let's go to Genesis 1. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 verse 26 &gt;&gt; with the word the way he comes here. If you sleeping it's a demon. &gt;&gt; God. The the the easiest example I can get for you is you sitting on a restaurant outback restaurant and they bringing a big steak &gt;&gt; and then you begin to slumber. &gt;&gt; Do you sleep at a restaurant? &gt;&gt; So how can you sleep in a church? &gt;&gt; No, never. &gt;&gt; All right, I already prayed. Genesis 1 &gt;&gt; verse uh &gt;&gt; 26 &gt;&gt; 26 &gt;&gt; she said Sharon I'm just getting warm up &gt;&gt; because when I do all of this she say you you losing time keep moving she said I told her I said you need to get here and understand what we go through with this anointing you don't know how to get it [laughter] you taking a mortal man and trying to handle a BIG GOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; You need to vent somehow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Genesis 1 verse 26. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And God said, you might be seated." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Your prayer has been answered. &gt;&gt; He say, "And God did what?" said, &gt;&gt; "Let us make man in what? &gt;&gt; Our image &gt;&gt; after what? &gt;&gt; Our likeness." &gt;&gt; And let them plural. &gt;&gt; You, we already went through this several times. &gt;&gt; Let them do what? &gt;&gt; Have dominion. &gt;&gt; So the creation of a man &gt;&gt; is already combined with a responsibility. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say, "Let us create a man." And that's it. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Let us create a man. And God automatically push the purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Push the the the the assignment &gt;&gt; of that man all together. &gt;&gt; In other words, man is coming up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man is coming up with his assignment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In plain word, God never created man to be &gt;&gt; idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man was created WITH A WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All for work. &gt;&gt; Forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says them, right? &gt;&gt; So he includes women. Yes. &gt;&gt; Push your brake. Push your brake. I know message believer. Hey, hold on. I know message believer. I know the place of a woman is in the kitchen. I will get to that. [laughter] Slow down. Let's Let's keep moving. I know message believer when you push like this. Ah, swallow. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And God say, let us make man how? in our image, &gt;&gt; after our own likeness, after our likeness, and let them &gt;&gt; both of them do what? &gt;&gt; Have dominion &gt;&gt; over what? &gt;&gt; The fish of the sea. &gt;&gt; So man is created to have dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's not just created to be men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. When God is creating man is for man to do something. &gt;&gt; So man, &gt;&gt; remember this man is double, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is male and female. &gt;&gt; Man is created for what? &gt;&gt; Dominion. &gt;&gt; Continue. And what else? &gt;&gt; Over the fish of the sea. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And over the foul of the air. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And over the cattle. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And over all the earth. &gt;&gt; If you notice, all those things were created before men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So God already put his job Don't you love the Bible? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There are some the job already was there. &gt;&gt; So man is coming into the job &gt;&gt; because God is so busy &gt;&gt; with the universe &gt;&gt; and he wanted to give somebody a charge &gt;&gt; of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; We clear right? &gt;&gt; So the job the task of a man already existed &gt;&gt; before man came. &gt;&gt; So man is born with a task. &gt;&gt; That's why work is divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I have quotes my friend. Uh uh drop to verse 22. So God created who? &gt;&gt; Man how? &gt;&gt; In his own image. &gt;&gt; If the man that is created in the image and likeness of God is a worker, what do you think God is? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. And the in the image of God created he him. How &gt;&gt; male? &gt;&gt; Male and what? &gt;&gt; Female &gt;&gt; created he what? them. &gt;&gt; Remember in this part here they were spiritual. &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; but even when they were spiritual they were working &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say Adam was leading the animals &gt;&gt; like the Holy Spirit was leading the church. &gt;&gt; So Adam was working in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Follow me. And Eve was working in the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will get to your kitchen. I will get to your kitchen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will get to your kitchen. Job to verse 28. And God did what? &gt;&gt; Bless them. &gt;&gt; Let's see the blessing of God. Because when we say bless them, we say I bless you. I bless you. I bless. No, no, no, no. God when he was blessing them, he was saying something. What is the blessing? &gt;&gt; He said and God blessed them. And what did he say? &gt;&gt; He said unto them, &gt;&gt; uhhuh, &gt;&gt; be fruitful and multiply. &gt;&gt; Ah, let's go slowly. Be what? &gt;&gt; Fruitful. &gt;&gt; So man cannot just come and without fruit. So when God say be fruitful there must be fruit in you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So so every so your package is coming with your with your creation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; God say be what? Fruitful. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; So if you not fruitful, we need to go back to God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; If what I'm doing is not fruitful, I need to go back to my savior. Don't worry. I'm going to help you continue my friend. &gt;&gt; And multiply. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; And multiply. &gt;&gt; Ah, so man has also another responsibility to do what? &gt;&gt; Multiply. &gt;&gt; And what else? &gt;&gt; Replenish the earth. &gt;&gt; And replenish the Why didn't God replenish it? &gt;&gt; Replenish. And do what? &gt;&gt; And subdue it. &gt;&gt; And subdue it. And what else? &gt;&gt; And have dominion over the &gt;&gt; And have dominion back again. So all of these are responsibility of a man &gt;&gt; who is male and female &gt;&gt; because God bless them &gt;&gt; not God bless him, &gt;&gt; God bless her them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a sister spiritually is blessed. &gt;&gt; We clear. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. Amen. He says, "And uh and the living and and the foul of the air and over the living thing that moveth upon what?" &gt;&gt; The earth. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the man that God created was not created to be lazy. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; He was created to be a working man. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, the problem is the kitchen and who stay in the kitchen and everything. Let's go to Genesis 2. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. In Genesis 2, because man is created for work, so his creator must be a worker himself. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Jesus had a job? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You did. Is that a I have the Bible scripture. Do you know that Jesus had a job &gt;&gt; and he was recognized by his job? &gt;&gt; The Bible say the carpenter. &gt;&gt; It's written in your Bible. So your so your maker was doing this. &gt;&gt; Your your maker &gt;&gt; was doing this and then you go see him [cheering] &gt;&gt; and then he take a break &gt;&gt; and he go eat his lunch &gt;&gt; but he's still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? Hey, [clears throat] I don't know where message believer get stuff. My friend, &gt;&gt; we are on verse two. Thus the heaven and the earth were what? &gt;&gt; Finish. &gt;&gt; If they were finished, somebody was working on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody was constructing was building and he finished his building. That's why they say they were finished. They finished the building. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were finished and all the host of them. And on the seventh day, God did what? &gt;&gt; Ended his work. ended what? &gt;&gt; His work. &gt;&gt; So God was doing what? &gt;&gt; Working. &gt;&gt; So work is what is divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not that we working because we fail. No. &gt;&gt; Work existed before sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the fall, work already existed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't think you will go to heaven and sit and do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see we are refocusing your heaven? &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Uh work is how &gt;&gt; divine. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. He said God uh uh ended his work which he has made and he did what? &gt;&gt; Rested on the seventh day. &gt;&gt; So rest is what? &gt;&gt; Divine. Do you know that this God that was working was not human? &gt;&gt; Do you know that &gt;&gt; he was a spirit? &gt;&gt; So how can a spirit rest? &gt;&gt; And if a spirit needed rest, how about your body? &gt;&gt; So rest is what? &gt;&gt; Divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God rested in which day? &gt;&gt; The seventh day. AND GOD TOOK EVEN THIS what he did and incorporated that &gt;&gt; in the calendar of Israel. &gt;&gt; And he told ISRAEL WHEN YOU WORK &gt;&gt; you work only six days. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SEVEN DAYS SIT DOWN &gt;&gt; and he incorporated that even to the land of Israel. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you work with the land in six years &gt;&gt; on the seven year. No. Don't even TILL THE GROUND.

They buy groceries, but they are in another season. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are also preparing a season. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SUMMER IS ALREADY telling them it's too hot. &gt;&gt; So there got to be a cold coming up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO AS THEY ARE GOING TO their normal routine life, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

God himself, look at what he did to Israel. So he helped somebody so we can climb higher. In Exodus 16:22, the Bible says, "And it came to pass that on the water &gt;&gt; on the SIXTH DAY &gt;&gt; THEY GATHERED WATER, &gt;&gt; twice as much bread." &gt;&gt; Because Israel when they were GOING INTO THE WILDERNESS EVERY DAY, &gt;&gt; EVERY DAY &gt;&gt; GOD WILL bring mana. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPORTION OF MANA WAS TO EAT ONE TIME, &gt;&gt; one meal per person. &gt;&gt; IF YOU KEEP IT, THE NEXT DAY IS THANK. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO MONDAY, ONE MEAL. &gt;&gt; ONE MEAL.

FRIDAY, ONE MEAL. &gt;&gt; SATURDAY, FOR SOME REASON, &gt;&gt; WHEN ISRAEL CAME UP, &gt;&gt; THEY SEEN THAT THE MEAL THAT CAME UP ON SATURDAY &gt;&gt; IS DOUBLE. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO KNOW WHY WAS THE MEAL DOUBLED. SO THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THEY GATHERED HOW MUCH? &gt;&gt; TWICE AS MUCH BREAD. &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; Two for one man. &gt;&gt; Because an was for one man. AND ALL THE RULERS OF THE congregation came and did what? &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; In other words, they didn't understand this. They took it to Moses. They say Moses something strange is going on today. Uh we gathered twice what we are supposed to gather. So we come to ask what is the meaning of this? And verse 23, and Moses say, and he says unto them, water. This is that which the Lord, &gt;&gt; in other words, the interpretation of what they experiencing. This is that which the LORD HAS SAID. TOMORROW IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; The rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The winter. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Of the water. &gt;&gt; Holy Sabbath unto THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BECK THAT which ye shall beg today, and sift that ye will sie, and that which remain overlay o over lay up FOR YOU TO KEEP IT UNTIL WHAT? MORNING. &gt;&gt; SO MOSES IS TELLING THEM THERE IS A REASON WHY YOU GOT THE BLESSING DOUBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BLESSING DOUBLE IS A LANGUAGE. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST BLESSING IS FOR THE DAY. &gt;&gt; BUT THE DOUBLING BLESSING, GOD IS PREPARING ANOTHER SEASON. HE'S PREPARING ANOTHER DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE SEVENTH DAY WAS IN THE SIXTH DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Is that too hard? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THAT AND THEY LAID IT UNTIL WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE MORNING &gt;&gt; as Moses bed AND IT DID NOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; STINK. &gt;&gt; NEITHER THERE WAS WHAT &gt;&gt; ANY WORM THERE. &gt;&gt; THEY found out in the morning it didn't stink. &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS PRESERVING THAT ALL THE WAY to the seventh day. THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND MOSES SAYS TO THEM WHAT? &gt;&gt; EAT THAT TODAY. &gt;&gt; FOR TH FOR TODAY IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; The Sabbath unto THE LORD. &gt;&gt; TODAY YOU SHALL NOT FIND IT WHERE? &gt;&gt; IN THE FIELD." &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN PRAY GOD ALL YOU WANT ON THE SABBATH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; YOUR PRAYER WILL BE ANSWERED AS A NO &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SABBATH WAS ALREADY GIVEN ON THE SIXTH DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HE SAID, "YOU SHALL NOT FIND IT IN THE FIELD." SIXTH DAY, YOU SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; GATHER IT. &gt;&gt; BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY, WHICH IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SABBATH. &gt;&gt; IT SHALL BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; NONE. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU GET THE SIXTH DAY, GOD TAKE THE BLESSING OF THE SEVENTH DAY AND PUT IT ON THE SIXTH DAY. SO YOU MUST BE CAREFUL HOW YOU BEHAVING ON THE SIXTH DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF NOT, YOU GOING TO STARVE ON THE SEVENTH DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MONEY IS COMING AROUND, A LOT OF MONEY HAS BEEN POURED. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO OPEN YOUR EYES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A TIME [screaming] OF SPENDING, SPENDING, SPENDING. &gt;&gt; GOD IS DOUBLING FOR A REASON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU CAN NOW BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT A HOUSE. &gt;&gt; SO, THE HOUSE CAME AS A DOUBLE BLESSING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. THE BIBLE SAID the ant prepared the meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer &gt;&gt; and then what? &gt;&gt; Gathers in the &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; To use it in the winter.

[cheering] [applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO, LET'S PUT THINGS IN THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE. &gt;&gt; IF you have a hard time, &gt;&gt; swallow what is coming up. Let's go to first king. &gt;&gt; Chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Father, help me to get where I'm trying to go. &gt;&gt; First king, chapter 3. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 5. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. In Gibian, &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared to Solomon. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The Lord appeared to Solomon where? in a dream by night. &gt;&gt; You understand this? And God say what? &gt;&gt; Ask what I shall give thee. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Job to verse uh seven. &gt;&gt; And now, oh Lord my God. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I am but a little child. &gt;&gt; You know this. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I know not how to go out or in. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And thy servant is in the midst of thy people, &gt;&gt; your people, &gt;&gt; which thou has chosen &gt;&gt; a great peoplehu &gt;&gt; that cannot be numbered. &gt;&gt; Remember cannot be numbered for multitude. continue &gt;&gt; nor counted for much. &gt;&gt; I give your servant what? &gt;&gt; Understanding &gt;&gt; and understanding what &gt;&gt; heart. &gt;&gt; God say ask. &gt;&gt; Did he say what to ask? &gt;&gt; Solomon say ask for what? &gt;&gt; An understanding heart. &gt;&gt; Understanding heart. Now we need to understand heart. Understanding heart. We already told you it's wisdom. But we got children that are growing up. They need to know where are we getting the word wisdom from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They call it here because the king and the chronicle are the same. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But one give you more detail to understand things better. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So keep your finger here. Let's go to 2 Chronicle 1. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Go search John Shar and go read it yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't worry, something is coming up. First King uh 2 Kings chapter 1. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 7 again, my friend. &gt;&gt; Second Chronicles. &gt;&gt; Oh, 2 Chronicle, I'm sorry. Chapter one, verse 7. And in that night did God appear to who? You see here they say in the night but in the kings they say in the dream. So sometime you need both stories &gt;&gt; to put everything together especially minister read both stories to put them together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in that night did God appear to Solomon and say to him ask what I shall what &gt;&gt; give thee. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 10. He said give me now what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Do you understand now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same story here they calling that what? wisdom. &gt;&gt; We clear now young people. You understand now? So don't say, "Brother, brother, I'm saying something that was not it's right here in the Bible." &gt;&gt; The problem is you got to know where to find it. &gt;&gt; He say, "Give me now what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom &gt;&gt; and what?" &gt;&gt; And knowledge. &gt;&gt; Do you see what where it is and jump to verse 11? &gt;&gt; And God said to Solomon, &gt;&gt; "Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Because this was in thine heart, &gt;&gt; yeah, give me wisdom and what? &gt;&gt; Knowledge." &gt;&gt; You see, they call it wisdom and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can call this knowledge here. They call it understanding. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; We clear now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know why I'm saying that. &gt;&gt; And continue verse 11. And God say, "Because you did not ask." What Solomon did not ask. &gt;&gt; Oh, riches. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. What? &gt;&gt; Riches. &gt;&gt; Riches and what? &gt;&gt; Wealth. &gt;&gt; Wealth. So, we can put riches and wealth together, right? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Or honor. &gt;&gt; And honor. And what else? nor the life of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; Life of enemy because if the life of enemies and what else? &gt;&gt; Neither yet has asked long life &gt;&gt; and long life. &gt;&gt; Anything else? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So there are one we put this one, two, three, four. We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's go back to first king chapter three where we were. &gt;&gt; If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Jump to verse uh 11. The Bible says because you have not because you ask uh uh verse 10, I'm sorry. And the speech did what? &gt;&gt; Please the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it pleased THE LORD THAT SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; For wisdom. We clear &gt;&gt; or understanding of a heart. We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He pleased the Lord THAT SOLOMON HAS ASKED WHAT? for wisdom and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon has asked this thing. SO WHEN SOLOMON SAID, "GIVE ME WISDOM." GOD WAS SO HAPPY. HE SAID, "GLORY, HALLELUJAH, SOLOMON. &gt;&gt; That's why I love you since you were born &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW TO ASK." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW GOD IS COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SPIRITUAL. &gt;&gt; We talked about this last Sunday because Solomon came with spiritual &gt;&gt; and God is the one that brought every stuff. &gt;&gt; OKAY. GOD SAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ASKED WHAT this thing wisdom and have not asked for yourself what &gt;&gt; long life &gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt; neither has asked riches for thyself &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; the life of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; But has asked for thyself understanding to DISCERN JUDGMENT. SO GOD IS TELLING SOLOMON WHAT SOLOMON DID NOT ASK. &gt;&gt; BUT SOLOMON asked for wisdom. Now I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WISDOM &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT MONEY? &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT WEALTH. AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT LONG LIFE. AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT LIFE OF THE ENEMY. AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT HONOR. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON ASKED SOMETHING SPIRITUAL. AND GOD BEGIN TO BRING HONOR and wealth. And what? And the ONE WHO'S BRINGING THIS ADAM IS NOT SOLOMON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD WHO'S SELECTING OUT OF EVERYTHING GOD CAN SAY. GOD HAVE SELECTED FOUR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He selected riches and health, wealth. He selected honor. He selected life of the enemy. And he selected long life. AND GOD SELECTED THEM AFTER HIS SON ASKED FOR WISDOM. WHY? &gt;&gt; Put your seat belts, my friend. Why? SOMEBODY. SO, SO IT'S LIKE I'M TALKING about uh I'm in I'm in food and you came up and you begin to talk about a car. I mean, we talking about I mean discernment. We're talking about wisdom to to to judge, to lead God's people. And you leave us AND AND YOU TAKE US FROM OUR SPIRITUAL CONSECRATED SIDE AND YOU PUT US here about money, about wealth, about honor. I mean, WHAT GOD WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THIS SUBJECT UP &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUAL STUFF? AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AND GOD TOLD SOLOMON, "BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT." &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED FOR MONEY, &gt;&gt; I'M heading now. &gt;&gt; Put your SEAT BELT NOW. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED GOD OF LONG LIFE. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED GOD OF HONOR. &gt;&gt; BUT SOLOMON REJECTED ALL OF THAT &gt;&gt; AND ASKED FOR WISDOM. AND GOD SAID, "BECAUSE YOU ASK FOR WISDOM, ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? BUT YOU DID NOT ASK FOR THIS. THESE THINGS GO TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slow. And I I know I know some of you are sitting to see where am I coming from and everything. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK GOD FOR A BABY. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Come on. [applause] Brother uh brother Joshua, you can ask God. You can go to God and say, "Lord Jesus Christ, please give me a baby." &gt;&gt; You didn't do anything wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can ask God. You say, "Lord Jesus Christ, I also want to have somebody who can cook for me good food." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a desire. You can also say, "God, I'm also asking you to give me somebody who when I'm going through a lot of stuff, that person can sit beside me and share with me." You know what I'm saying? God, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother Josh? AND YOU CAN ASK GOD, YOU SAY, "GOD, ALSO I'M GOING TO MOVE TO my own house and I WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHEN I COME, THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF my house very good and they can clean UP EVERYTHING." &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH DETAIL. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN SUMMARIZE [screaming] ALL THE PETITION IN ONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU HAVE TO ASK IS GIVE ME A GOOD WIFE. [cheering] [applause] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF A GOOD WIFE COME, THE COOKING WILL COME, &gt;&gt; THE BABY WILL COME, THE CLEANING OF THE HOUSE WILL COME, THE COMFORT WILL COME, THE FELLOWSHIP WILL COME. BECAUSE YOU [screaming] ASK FOR A WIFE AND NOT FOR A BABY, I'M GOING TO ADD BABY. I'M GOING TO ADD COOKER. I'M GOING TO ADD EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE TWO COMES TOGETHER. [screaming] AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOUR WORK IS TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S A SURGERY. YOU GOT TO GO SLOWLY. &gt;&gt; SO, brother Steven. &gt;&gt; So, you mean &gt;&gt; Jesus? &gt;&gt; You mean this is your deduction. We understand the example. It makes sense what you just explained, brother Joshua. I understand that. But my point is, so you mean wisdom goes with money &gt;&gt; and wisdom goes with this. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb chapter 4. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your surgery is a big one. &gt;&gt; When I'm at home, I'm looking at this. Ting ting ting ting thing. We go. When I get here, &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Proverb chapter 4. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON ASKED GOD for what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; And God say what? &gt;&gt; Wealth. &gt;&gt; Wealth and this and this and this and this. I'M GOING TO GIVE it to you. God didn't say because you didn't ask for this and you asked for wisdom, you are a very spiritual young man. I will avoid you these things &gt;&gt; but I will give you wisdom &gt;&gt; so that wisdom you go with it. Okay, Solomon, but not this thing because somebody else would have asked me these things, but you are very spiritual. &gt;&gt; But God saym, when you ask wisdom, it's a package. &gt;&gt; Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Hey, you who have some doubt, let's let's deal with your doubt. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb chapter 4. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse seven. The Bible say what? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; WISDOM IS WHAT? THE PRINCIPLE THING. &gt;&gt; AH, wisdom is what? &gt;&gt; THE PRINCIPLE THING. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, WISDOM IS THE MAIN THING. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; SO HE ASKED THE PRINCIPLE THING. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. SO ACCORDING TO AH &gt;&gt; SO NOW WE FOUND OUT THAT WISDOM &gt;&gt; IS WHAT &gt;&gt; the principle thing &gt;&gt; the the PRINCIPLE &gt;&gt; IT IS THE MAIN THING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE MAIN THING. &gt;&gt; BROTHER JOSHUA ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE MAIN THING. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; WE CLEAR. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WISDOM IS THE PRINCIPLE THING. COME ON. THEREFORE, DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; GET WISDOM. &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON IS SAYING IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR, LOOK FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; CONTINUE. AND WITH ALL YOUR WHAT? &gt;&gt; GET IT. &gt;&gt; Get what? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Do you see both of them? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, SOLOMON is saying IF THERE IS ONE THING YOU NEED TO GET &gt;&gt; THAT YOU NEED TO WORK FOR IT, &gt;&gt; get wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WISDOM IS THE MAIN THING. BECAUSE WISDOM IS THE PRINCIPAL THING. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ONLY CAN GET WISDOM, &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR THE MEN. THAT'S WHY THE LORD WAS PLEASED. &gt;&gt; I hope now we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With his request. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS BRINGING FOUR ADAMS HERE. RICHES AND WEALTH, HONOR, LIFE OF THE ENEMY AND WHAT &gt;&gt; long life. &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Proverb 3 and then we start soaring my friend. Proverb 3. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Drop to verse 13.

Happy is the who? &gt;&gt; THE MAN &gt;&gt; THAT FOUND WHAT? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; AND THE MAN THAT GET WHAT? &gt;&gt; UNDERSTANDING. SO A MAN THAT FOUND WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING IS HOW &gt;&gt; HAPPY. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. &gt;&gt; FOR HER WHAT? &gt;&gt; FOR THE MERCHANDISE of it. &gt;&gt; SO WISDOM GOT MERCHANDISE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. UHHUH. UH-UH. UH-UH. UH-UH. UH-UH. WISDOM IS NOT JUST WISDOM. &gt;&gt; Wisdom got a got a got a got a package. He got a merchandise. &gt;&gt; HE GOT GOODS. &gt;&gt; PRODUCTS. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAY FOR HER MERCHANDISE is what? &gt;&gt; Better than the merchandise of silver. &gt;&gt; Better than the merchandise of what? &gt;&gt; Silver. &gt;&gt; And the g thereof of what? &gt;&gt; And fine gold. You see, brother Steven, you see, you see the merchandise of silver are better than I mean the merchandise of wisdom are better than silver and gold. See, wisdom is spiritual. It is better than money. Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. SHE IS MORE PRECIOUS &gt;&gt; THAN WHAT? &gt;&gt; RUBY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK, THEY ARE CALLING WOMAN A SHEEP. &gt;&gt; I MEAN WISDOM A SHEEP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DESIRE OF A WOMAN, &gt;&gt; THE DESIRE OF THE bride &gt;&gt; goes to the groom. &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW IN THE BOOK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, THE BIBLE SAY CHRIST IS OUR WISDOM. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Verse 15, SHE IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN WHAT? &gt;&gt; RUBIES. AND ALL THE THINGS you can desire ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH WHAT &gt;&gt; TO HER. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO NOW. VERSE 16. LIFE OF DAYS. &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS. &gt;&gt; IS IN WHAT? &gt;&gt; HER RIGHT HAND. &gt;&gt; AH. SO THAT IF YOU FIND WISDOM, WISDOM HAVE HAND. &gt;&gt; I'M reading with you. &gt;&gt; Ah. Come on. COME ON. WISDOM HAVE HAND. &gt;&gt; WISDOM HAVE A RIGHT HAND AND WISDOM HAVE A LEFT HAND. SO WISDOM IS A PERSON. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO FIND WHAT IS IN HER HAND. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THE BIBLE SAY IN THE RIGHT HAND OF WISDOM. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THERE? &gt;&gt; RICHES AND HONOR. NO. &gt;&gt; AH NO NO NO NO NO. LET'S START AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Let's start where we were again. VERSE 16. LIFE OF WHAT? DAYS &gt;&gt; ARE WHERE &gt;&gt; IN HER RIGHT HAND. &gt;&gt; LOOK RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; LOOK RIGHT HERE, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; GOD TAUGHT SOLOMON WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHICH is wealth and what? &gt;&gt; Honor &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Life &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; LONG LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; WISDOM. BUT WE FOUND IN WISDOM RIGHT HAND WHAT IS THERE? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD SAY BECAUSE YOU ASK WISDOM, &gt;&gt; WISDOM IN HIS RIGHT HAND GOT LONG LIFE. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Let's slow down. If I If I lost you, raise your hand because I can't play a game with that. If I lost you, raise your hand. Thank you, Jesus. Listen carefully. &gt;&gt; Solomon say, "Give me wisdom." &gt;&gt; And God say, "What caliber are you, Solomon? &gt;&gt; I didn't. You're a dangerous child. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for money. You didn't ask for length of day. You asked for wisdom &gt;&gt; because you asked for wisdom. &gt;&gt; Get length of day. &gt;&gt; Get uh money, &gt;&gt; get honor, &gt;&gt; get the life of your enemy. And our question was why is God adding those things when Solomon only asked for wisdom? &gt;&gt; We found out that's according to proverb, wisdom is the principle thing. &gt;&gt; So Solomon asked for the man thing. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU GET THE MAN THING, &gt;&gt; that's right. WHEN YOU GET DUKE POWER, &gt;&gt; WHEN DUKE POWER BELONG TO YOU, &gt;&gt; are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? NOW WE FIND IN WISDOM RIGHT HAND, WHAT DO WE FIND THERE? &gt;&gt; CHECK. &gt;&gt; AND SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; SO AUTOMATICALLY SOLOMON MUST HAVE LONG LIFE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LONG LIFE IS A PACKAGE OF WISDOM. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 316. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a teaching reign, my friend. &gt;&gt; We got to be taught to have a right faith &gt;&gt; because when you pray, you cannot have a condemnation. &gt;&gt; Like you you you asking something that is sinful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a time we told you stay away for sisters. &gt;&gt; Stay away for sister. After a while we say hey you don't watch you don't see you don't see because there is a time have changed after a while we say we don't see it's no longer a sin we say boy &gt;&gt; I took you over there you didn't see anything &gt;&gt; but before it was a sin &gt;&gt; let me go back to what I'm saying [laughter] IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE BALANCE THAT'S WHEN WE GET IN TROUBLE &gt;&gt; in the message of the TRUTH AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE PUSH THE BOY SO FAR &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND, YOU ARE TELLING THE SAME BOY, GO MARRY, GO MARRY WHAT YOU TOLD ME THIS IS SIN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE PORTRAY WOMEN AS SIN. &gt;&gt; NOW SIN TURN TO A BLESSING AGAIN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BALANCE THINGS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAY WHO FIND A WIFE FIND A GOOD THING. SO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DEPICTING HOW YOU ARE PAINTING A SYSTEM. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WORLDLY SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; A WORLDLY WOMAN AND A SISTER. &gt;&gt; A SISTER IS A PRECIOUS THING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOD'S DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? VERSE 16. LENGTH OF DAYS IS WHERE? &gt;&gt; IN HER LEFT HAND. &gt;&gt; AND IN HER LEFT HAND ARE WHAT? [screaming] &gt;&gt; RICHES AND HONOR. &gt;&gt; RICHES AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; HONOR. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN SOLOMON IS ASKING FOR WISDOM, WHAT IS COMING? &gt;&gt; You understand? Now &gt;&gt; can you look at the board? &gt;&gt; What is on the left hand? &gt;&gt; Riches and honor. &gt;&gt; Riches and what? &gt;&gt; Honor. &gt;&gt; Now you understand why God was adding those things? Because you cannot have wisdom without having this package. &gt;&gt; I hope I'M GOING TO STRIKE something sooner. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh uh verse uh 17. AND HER PATH HER WAYS ARE WAYS OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; PLEASANTNESS. &gt;&gt; AND ALL HER PATH ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE THINGS RIGHT HERE? &gt;&gt; LIFE OF ENEMY. &gt;&gt; LIFE OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; ENEMY. IF THEY TAKE THE LIFE OF YOUR ENEMY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD TOLD SOLOMON, "ASK, &gt;&gt; SOLOMON SAY, GIVE ME WHAT?" &gt;&gt; WISDOM. &gt;&gt; BUT WISDOM GOES WITH A PACKAGE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET HONOR. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET WEALTH. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET PEACE. YES. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET LONG LIFE. &gt;&gt; SEEK YE FIRST.

AH, SAY, "GIVE ME YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GOT THE HOLY GHOST, [screaming] &gt;&gt; I GOT MONEY. &gt;&gt; I GOT HONOR. &gt;&gt; I GOT LONG LIFE. I GOT [screaming] ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY AUNTIE, RIGHT? [screaming] THAT'S WHY AUNTIE RIGHT BROTHER GAVE [screaming] THE OPTION &gt;&gt; LOOK AT $1 MILLION LOOK AT THE LIFE OF HEALING OF YOUR SISTER I RIGHT LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT HE SAID GIVE ME SALVATION GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST SEE MY CHILDREN BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST WILL GIVE A MILLION DOLLAR THE HOLY GHOST WILL HEAL MY SISTER THE HOLY GHOST WILL HEAL [screaming] MY BOY THE HOLY GHOST WILL TAKE CARE OF MY PROBLEM.

[cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the wealth of Solomon is part of the wisdom &gt;&gt; and the wisdom is &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; BECAUSE RICHES AND HONOR AND GLORY AND POWER ARE TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRHAM SAY IF EINSTEIN WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE THE THE SCIENTIFIC WORK THAT HE DID AND APPLY IT HE WOULD HAVE TAUGHT US SOMETHING BECAUSE SOME BECAUSE EINSTEIN FOUND A CENTER IN THE UNIVERSE. IF YOU CAN MAKE A CONTACT WITH THAT CENTER YOU CAN CREATE EVERYTHING. HE FOUND THE PILLAR OF FIRE &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE DID IT IN THE FIRST SIX.

When you get wisdom, you get everything. &gt;&gt; When you get Christ, you get everything. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say Jesus was rich &gt;&gt; and he made himself poor so that me and you can become rich &gt;&gt; because he is the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; And Solomon REPRESENTED CHRIST &gt;&gt; IN THE MILLENNIUM &gt;&gt; IN THE FULL GLORY OF CHRIST WAS DISPLAYING SOLOMON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together?
