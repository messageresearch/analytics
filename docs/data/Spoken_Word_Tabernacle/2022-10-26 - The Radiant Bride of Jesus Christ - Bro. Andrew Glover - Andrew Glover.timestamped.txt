[54:22] chapter in the 15th verse Paul here
[54:25] writing he says that ye may be blameless
[54:29] and harmless the sons of God without
[54:32] rebuke notice this in the midst of a
[54:36] crooked and perverse Nation among whom
[54:39] ye shine as light in the world
[54:43] holding forth the word of life that I
[54:46] may rejoice in the day of Christ and I
[54:49] have to that I have not run in vain
[54:51] neither labored in vain now if we could
[54:54] look back in the Book of Matthew the
[54:55] fifth chapter
[54:57] I've just been uh studying here the past
[54:59] few weeks out of these uh two portions
[55:01] of scripture and the Lord has just been
[55:03] opening some things to my heart and I
[55:05] just want to share them with you tonight
[55:07] in Matthew the fifth chapter in the 14th
[55:10] verse I find a direct connection between
[55:13] Philippians 2 and Matthew 5 and the 14th
[55:17] verse Jesus says ye are the light of the
[55:20] world a city that is set on a hill
[55:23] cannot be hid neither do men light a
[55:28] candle put it under a bushel but on a
[55:30] Candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[55:34] that are in the house
[55:35] now here is your command from the Lord
[55:38] let your light so shine before men that
[55:42] they may see your good works and glorify
[55:46] your father which is in heaven amen let
[55:49] your light so shine before men that they
[55:51] may see your good works and that they

[56:06] if I title this tonight I want to speak
[56:08] to you on the radiant bride of Jesus
[56:11] Christ the radiant bride of Jesus Christ
[56:14] sometimes people say brother Andrew you
[56:16] speak too much about the message and the
[56:18] bride well I believe if there's ever
[56:20] been a time to talk about the message of
[56:22] the hour and to talk about the bride
[56:24] that that message is called I believe
[56:26] now is the time to do that amen looking
[56:29] here in Philippians 2 verse 15 I
[56:31] normally don't read many different
[56:33] translations but I actually come across
[56:35] this translation from the Amplified
[56:37] Bible of Philippians 2 and I just want
[56:39] to share it with you it says so that you
[56:41] may prove yourselves to be blameless and
[56:44] Godless innocent and uncontaminated
[56:46] children of God without blemish in the
[56:49] midst of a morally crooked and
[56:52] spiritually perverted generation amen a

[1:05:04] fulfilled every devil and Hell raised
[1:05:06] its head up will come on church if the
[1:05:08] devil fought the Messiah he's going to
[1:05:10] fight the Messiah ants amen but the same

[1:15:04] dead out of the ground it's got enough
[1:15:05] power Amen to change us from Mortal to
[1:15:08] immortality I'm not talking about a
[1:15:11] church Alliance I'm talking about
[1:15:12] Messiah light
[1:15:15] the prophet said we can prostrate
[1:15:16] ourselves give ourselves up until God
[1:15:20] takes his transfusion tube the name of
[1:15:22] Jesus Christ not another name under
[1:15:24] Heaven whereby man can be saved and
[1:15:27] transfers The Life of Christ into us
[1:15:30] then we can get so transfused by his
[1:15:33] power that we die to our own thinking
[1:15:36] and our faith becomes genuine Faith then
[1:15:39] the Life of Christ is transfused into us
[1:15:43] we become living creatures of God a
[1:15:46] dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can
[1:15:48] send his radiant blessings down through
[1:15:51] there and we're in the stature of Christ
[1:15:55] can I tell you what I believe I do not
[1:15:58] believe the stature of a perfect man was
[1:16:00] a waste of the rem's time I do not
[1:16:02] believe that Revelation was a waste of
[1:16:05] time I believe I'm preaching to people
[1:16:07] who have been baptized they've been
[1:16:10] transfused they've been controlled
[1:16:12] humble now they've been put together by
[1:16:15] the god of the stature of a perfect man
[1:16:17] listen I do not believe we gotta wait to
[1:16:21] the Millennium to see seven Divine
[1:16:23] virtues flowing out of a people I
[1:16:26] believe right here in the middle of a
[1:16:28] crooked and perverse generation there's
[1:16:31] some young girls there's some young boys
[1:16:33] there's some families that are
[1:16:35] displaying the seven colors of the
[1:16:37] rainbow
[1:16:39] they're expressing God's life you are
[1:16:43] nothing listen to me you are nothing but
[1:16:45] the manifestation of the gene of life
[1:16:47] that was in God as the Son of God now
[1:16:50] you're expressed are you hearing me
[1:16:53] that's why the devil hates you you've
[1:16:55] gone from Gene to expression
[1:16:58] come on now you've gone from Gene to
[1:17:01] expression in gene form you're not seen
[1:17:03] in gene form you're not disturbing
[1:17:06] nothing in gene form you're just a
[1:17:08] thought but when you move into
[1:17:10] expression
[1:17:12] when you move from Gene to expression
[1:17:14] you become a messiah you become an
[1:17:17] invincible Army you become Mighty
[1:17:20] conquers you become the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:22] Christ
[1:17:23] among now his word has come in you to
[1:17:27] light up this age you are expressing
[1:17:30] God's life because you are a son or
[1:17:33] daughter of God you are now made sitting
[1:17:36] in this church tonight because your duty
[1:17:39] is to express God to this nation this
[1:17:43] people this neighborhood where you
[1:17:45] associate see then the gospel tonight is
[1:17:49] not shining it is glowing
[1:17:51] the prophet of God said the gospel does
[1:17:54] not shine it glows he said see the
[1:17:57] little kingdom down in some little alley
[1:17:58] like here somewhere is glowing with the
[1:18:01] glory of God filled with a humble in
[1:18:03] heart God working in them Healing The
[1:18:06] Sick raising the dead casting out Devils
[1:18:09] amen just letting them pass on by
[1:18:11] Hollywood shines but the gospel glows
[1:18:14] Hollywood shines but the gospel glows
[1:18:17] the difference in shine and glow to
[1:18:20] shine is to reflect light amen clearly
[1:18:23] and sharply in other words you are
[1:18:25] reflecting what is coming into you if
[1:18:27] you're shining now let me prove to you
[1:18:29] that religion is a morally crooked and
[1:18:32] perverse generation in the beginning
[1:18:35] amen singers got up and they sung to the
[1:18:38] glory of God come down but to show you
[1:18:41] the perverseness amen Hollywood is now
[1:18:43] reflecting its light through a bunch of
[1:18:45] churches and now you got light shows
[1:18:48] foreign
[1:18:50] come on I mean it used to be that
[1:18:52] preachers gotten the pulpit and they
[1:18:55] surrender to the Holy Spirit and they
[1:18:57] preach without fear they preach without
[1:18:59] favor they stood there and declared the
[1:19:01] whole Council of God Amen but now you
[1:19:04] got a bunch of sissified men carrying a
[1:19:06] cup of coffee sitting at a table trying
[1:19:09] to read the church a Bible story living
[1:19:11] and seeing himself are you hearing me
[1:19:13] it's not a reflection it is a Shine from
[1:19:16] Hollywood but I submit to you that this
[1:19:19] bride is not a Hollywood bride she's not
[1:19:22] a Showmanship bride she's not a
[1:19:24] reflection of denomination she is a glow
[1:19:27] of the presence of the Eternal God she
[1:19:30] is Jesus Christ
[1:19:33] she is the word made flesh in her age
[1:19:39] you're saying I'm saying we are not here
[1:19:41] shining denomination we are glowing the
[1:19:44] Gospel of Jesus Christ what are you
[1:19:46] trying to say I'm telling you that Jesus
[1:19:48] was the glow of God are you hearing me
[1:19:52] Jesus was the glow of God he was not
[1:19:55] reflecting the Pharisees shiny pots and
[1:19:58] pans he was not reflecting the Sadducees
[1:20:02] ideas about the coming of the Messiah he
[1:20:05] was not reflecting amen the ideas of the
[1:20:08] scribes and the lawyers that had paid
[1:20:10] away for Jesus to come he was not
[1:20:12] reflecting on he was reflecting Isaiah
[1:20:15] 53 he was glowing Zechariah 9. he was
[1:20:18] glowing Micah the fifth chapter he was
[1:20:20] clothed come on church and that same God
[1:20:24] that glowed in Jesus has returned to the
[1:20:27] bride and the same God that was glowing
[1:20:30] in Jesus is glowing in a many-membered
[1:20:32] body
[1:20:34] foreign
[1:20:37] what are you saying I'm saying we're not
[1:20:40] a bunch of denominational chickens
[1:20:41] looking for shiny things we're Eagles
[1:20:44] that are looking for the glow of God
[1:20:46] the prophet of God said Eagles don't
[1:20:49] look for shine they look for glow and
[1:20:51] the real gospel glows with power with
[1:20:55] humility with love with power that's
[1:20:57] what the real eagle hunt hungry hearted
[1:21:00] Eagles reach for that just as hard as
[1:21:03] they can it's the pearl of great price
[1:21:05] they will sell everything else to go by
[1:21:08] it
[1:21:09] now when I start speaking to you about
[1:21:11] radiant lives don't think I'm not
[1:21:13] getting this from the Bible the Bible
[1:21:16] itself speaks of radiant lives in the
[1:21:19] Book of Job 11 chapter you can read
[1:21:21] about repentance but in the 17th verse
[1:21:24] he said thine age shall be clearer than
[1:21:26] the Noonday Thou shalt shine forth Thou
[1:21:30] shalt be as the morning Psalms 34 Verse
[1:21:33] 5 they looked unto him and were
[1:21:35] lightened and their faces were not
[1:21:38] ashamed notice where he puts this their
[1:21:41] faces were not ashamed in Ecclesiastes 8
[1:21:44] verse 1 who is as the wise man who
[1:21:47] knoweth the interpretation of a thing a
[1:21:50] man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine
[1:21:53] and the boldness of his face shall be
[1:21:57] changed where is this light reflecting
[1:22:00] itself at the Bible is purposely
[1:22:02] pointing out the face come on now the
[1:22:06] light is reflecting in the face in
[1:22:09] Isaiah said 2 verse 1 for sign's sake
[1:22:12] will I not hold my peace for Jerusalem's
[1:22:15] sake I will not rest until the righteous
[1:22:17] thereof go forth his brightness and the
[1:22:20] Salvation thereof amen as a lamp that
[1:22:23] burneth the salvation of God will be as
[1:22:26] a lamp that burneth what does David say
[1:22:28] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and it
[1:22:33] is a light unto my path are you with me
[1:22:36] my word is a lamp unto my feet he says
[1:22:39] Thy word rather and a light unto my path
[1:22:42] where do we go from there without a path
[1:22:44] can I tell you where we go we go to
[1:22:46] Matthew the second chapter where the
[1:22:49] Bible says that there were three main
[1:22:51] times which were star Watchers and they
[1:22:54] saw a star appear in the sky the Bible
[1:22:57] says we have seen his star in the east
[1:23:00] and our come to worship him we have seen
[1:23:03] his star in the east and our come to
[1:23:06] worship Him you tell me where did that
[1:23:09] star appear it appeared in the East
[1:23:12] where did that star lead them it led him
[1:23:15] to the West amen were the appearance of
[1:23:17] the Messiah would be upon the Earth come
[1:23:20] on church I'm not a crazy man in 1909
[1:23:23] there was a star came down in a cabin it
[1:23:26] was in the East and it found a man upon
[1:23:29] the Earth and that star amen led him
[1:23:31] from Kentucky into Jeffersonville and
[1:23:34] that same star led him into Tucson
[1:23:36] Arizona and he received the seventh seal
[1:23:39] and he came back to the East and
[1:23:41] declared to you this is not Darkness
[1:23:44] this is light

[1:23:50] imagination this is a word

[1:24:07] you know people say well brother Brad
[1:24:08] was a false prophet and you know that's

[1:26:09] of the solar system
[1:26:10] one star defied the laws of the solar
[1:26:14] system and come from a great consolation
[1:26:16] of heavenly bodies to declare something
[1:26:19] when it was fixing to happen he said and
[1:26:22] I hope you get this point
[1:26:24] that in this day can you is it possible
[1:26:28] to give me the picture of the pillar of
[1:26:30] fire of her brother man's head in this
[1:26:33] day God has defied everything to declare
[1:26:37] his self that he's alive today has
[1:26:41] raised from the dead in his great
[1:26:43] Celestial body are you ready for what a
[1:26:45] prophet said the picture of here of his

[1:35:36] light it's the Vindicated spoken word of
[1:35:40] God listen I know that devil right now
[1:35:42] spotting this sound system and I'll
[1:35:44] preach right over that devil's head he
[1:35:46] will not defeat this word we will preach
[1:35:48] the gospel and we will glow with
[1:35:51] authority and power the Vindicated
[1:35:53] spoken word of God is the light you
[1:35:57] cannot lighten the Earth with
[1:35:58] flashlights are you hearing me you
[1:36:01] cannot lighten the Earth with a
[1:36:03] flashlight
[1:36:04] are you hearing me then do you realize
[1:36:07] original light was not electrical light
[1:36:13] you know what it was
[1:36:14] it was fire
[1:36:16] are you hearing me original light was
[1:36:20] firing
[1:36:22] come on now there was not one verse of
[1:36:25] the Bible wrote Under an artificial
[1:36:27] light
[1:36:29] come on now there was not one prophecy
[1:36:32] fulfilled under an artificial light
[1:36:34] created by a man who looked two wires
[1:36:37] together but the fire of God was the
[1:36:41] light in the beginning was God and said
[1:36:45] what was God he was a great light he was
[1:36:47] like a pillar of fiery a moon church
[1:36:50] then whatever that Pillar of Fire got
[1:36:52] into
[1:36:55] it become light
[1:36:57] do you see why we're not cold on a
[1:37:00] Friday night or a Wednesday night do you
[1:37:02] see why we're not sad on a Wednesday
[1:37:04] night is because we're not here under
[1:37:07] artificial denominational man-made lie
[1:37:10] we have been restored to the original
[1:37:12] light of God the pillar of fire has come
[1:37:16] back and flesh it's not a pain and fire
[1:37:18] it's a living fire
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:23] what is lot sent for what is life sent
[1:37:26] for so you can see how to get around is
[1:37:29] that right then light produces life what
[1:37:32] is his word his word is light and life
[1:37:35] what did Jesus say I am the light
[1:37:40] then all that was in God he poured into
[1:37:44] Christ and all that was in Christ he
[1:37:48] poured into the bride the church then
[1:37:50] what did Jesus say I am the light of the
[1:37:54] world as long as I'm in the world
[1:37:56] said the one true God dwelt to light God
[1:38:00] dwells in light a sacred fire when he
[1:38:02] was on Earth he was manifested in flesh
[1:38:05] he said I am the light of the world why
[1:38:09] because God was manifested through him
[1:38:13] Jesus the word was the concept of God
[1:38:17] expressed in flesh when God was truly
[1:38:21] revealed he was manifested in flesh
[1:38:25] that's why Jesus could say when you've
[1:38:27] seen me you've seen the Father the works
[1:38:30] that I do bear record of the father are
[1:38:33] you hearing me oh God
[1:38:36] can I have a few more minutes brother
[1:38:38] Stephen
[1:38:39] Jesus was all the inspired prophets
[1:38:42] testimonies and all their prophecy was
[1:38:46] brought to lie in his age that had been
[1:38:49] prophesied for his age can I can I tell
[1:38:52] you what a prophet said Jesus lit up
[1:38:55] every candle of word that was in the
[1:38:58] Bible that was prophesied of him
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:03] come on Church what are you saying I'm
[1:39:06] saying Jesus was a living walking fire
[1:39:09] Jesus was a living walking Fire come on
[1:39:13] church that's why when he walked by the
[1:39:15] Widow named son she he got up out of the
[1:39:18] casket that's why when he walked by
[1:39:20] blind Bartimaeus he received his sight
[1:39:22] that's why he turned water into wine are
[1:39:24] you hearing me because those were
[1:39:26] candles those were Wicks amen but a
[1:39:29] candle Without fire has no purpose but
[1:39:32] Jesus was the fire and whatever he
[1:39:34] walked by he set on fire and that same
[1:39:37] Jesus is woken through spoken word

[1:50:13] the product of God set them seven golden
[1:50:14] candlesticks they had little lamps on
[1:50:17] top of them that burnt what they burnt
[1:50:20] oil all represents the Holy Spirit
[1:50:24] Come on church and those lamps had to be
[1:50:28] lit by the fire of God now come on you
[1:50:31] know that Aaron's sons went in there
[1:50:35] to light them and they died at the door
[1:50:38] you know why because the Bible said they
[1:50:40] brought Strange Fire come on now they
[1:50:43] brought what Dr Dobson thought behind
[1:50:45] the pulpits they brought what TD Jakes
[1:50:47] taught behind the pulpit they was
[1:50:49] reading Billy Graham more than they was
[1:50:51] reading William Branham and they brought
[1:50:53] it behind the puppet
[1:50:56] come on with this Farm we might as well
[1:50:58] preach and the Bible calls It Strange
[1:51:01] Fire and you know what the prophet of
[1:51:03] God said he said Strange Fire
[1:51:05] come on can I preach to you I'm not
[1:51:08] going to read it to you I'm going to
[1:51:09] preach it to you the word strange means
[1:51:11] or harlot
[1:51:14] go look in your Greek dictionary and see
[1:51:17] if the word strange doesn't mean a
[1:51:19] or a harlot woman you know what the
[1:51:21] prophet called that Strange Fire he
[1:51:23] called it denominational fire do you
[1:51:25] know what he said Revelation 17 was the
[1:51:28] Catholic church was the mother and
[1:51:31] those Protestant donors were the harlots
[1:51:33] this Prophet didn't miss it he declared
[1:51:36] to this generation you leave that
[1:51:38] Strange Fire out of the house of God and
[1:51:41] welcome the pitifier
[1:51:45] you want to kill your church bring some
[1:51:48] strange fire in you want to kill a move
[1:51:50] of God bring some strange fire in him
[1:51:52] yeah
[1:51:55] when one candle was lit by the fire of
[1:51:57] God they taken that candle and lit the
[1:51:59] other one then they lit another one and
[1:52:01] another one and another one to the last
[1:52:03] candle he said see the same fire that
[1:52:05] burnt the oil he said in Ephesus was
[1:52:08] burdened in laodicea the same Holy
[1:52:11] Spirit lit by the same God by the same
[1:52:13] fire
[1:52:15] I'm on Church the fire that fell on the
[1:52:17] day of Pentecost has lit the candle the
[1:52:20] church through every age right on down
[1:52:24] here now
[1:52:26] brother miles how can I stand here and
[1:52:29] say we can expect another book of Acts
[1:52:32] because the same fire that was in the
[1:52:34] book of Acts has returned to the church
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:40] I'm on church I tell you can can I
[1:52:43] preach to you now can we go out here I'm
[1:52:45] preaching for a minute I'll tell you why
[1:52:47] the devil's mad he's scared a lot that
[1:52:50] will scare the fire that they will scare
[1:52:52] the light the prophet said Satan is
[1:52:55] scared of light any devil is afraid of
[1:52:57] light any creeping evil thing is afraid
[1:53:01] of light flash on the light and they're
[1:53:03] gone that's the reason people are afraid
[1:53:06] of these old-time Holy Ghost meetings
[1:53:08] Children Of Darkness work in darkness
[1:53:10] but children of Light walk in the light
[1:53:14] foreign
[1:53:16] can I finish this
[1:53:18] can I finish this then Jesus said let
[1:53:21] your light so shine before men that they
[1:53:24] may see your good works and glorify your
[1:53:27] father which is in heaven it's amazing
[1:53:30] to me if you want to listen to two
[1:53:32] powerful tapes back to back listen to
[1:53:34] let your light shine 1961 and then go
[1:53:38] listen The Works is Faith expressed in
[1:53:41] 1965. when brother Bynum opens let your
[1:53:44] light so shine he starts talking about
[1:53:46] Abraham being justified by his works he
[1:53:51] said Peter or rather James was
[1:53:53] justifying Abraham by what okay
[1:53:57] he said by what man saw but Paul was
[1:54:01] justified Abraham by what God saw then
[1:54:04] what are good works good works
[1:54:07] demonstrate the reality of faith in your
[1:54:10] heart that's why James said amen let
[1:54:13] that faith of that works is dead see
[1:54:16] works is Faith expressed
[1:54:20] brother Kelly what does that word
[1:54:22] radiant mean an expression
[1:54:25] a glow
[1:54:28] Works show that faith has already took a
[1:54:31] hold because our works Express what
[1:54:34] faith we have but if we're afraid to act
[1:54:37] on what we believe then we do not
[1:54:39] believe it works Express faith in God's
[1:54:42] promise then Abraham was acting upon
[1:54:46] what God had revealed to him
[1:54:49] come on now what is faith faith is a
[1:54:54] revelation from God then we could very
[1:54:56] well title that works is revelation
[1:54:59] expressed Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:55:03] hearing by the word so God and His
[1:55:06] Sovereign Grace prepared the heart he
[1:55:09] prepared you before the foundation of
[1:55:11] the world to receive him in this age
[1:55:14] that's why you're rugged Christians
[1:55:16] that's why you're Gentile Warriors is
[1:55:19] because Revelation has changed you it
[1:55:22] has caused you to be more than a dirty

[2:09:58] that's why when you walk into a room
[2:10:01] the atmosphere changes
[2:10:03] because brother Stephen there's
[2:10:06] something emanating from you
[2:10:09] there's a revelation
[2:10:11] expressing its way
[2:10:13] through your very being
[2:10:15] won't you stand to your feet with us
[2:10:16] this afternoon

[2:10:23] I preached a lot longer and I planned on
[2:10:25] it
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:28] but can I tell you
[2:10:30] you're a part of a vision
[2:10:33] listen
[2:10:34] the vision must materialize
[2:10:39] do you realize the only thing that can
[2:10:41] put you in position
[2:10:43] is the Holy Spirit
[2:10:46] like this he said I've seen a division
[2:10:48] before going a house and he said in the
[2:10:50] vision I saw a green hat laying on the
[2:10:53] table here
[2:10:54] he said I walked in there and he said
[2:10:57] the green hat was over on the chest of
[2:10:58] drawers over there he said I couldn't go
[2:11:01] over there and pick it up
[2:11:02] he said but I had so much confidence in
[2:11:05] the one that gave the vision
[2:11:07] that I knew in order for that Vision to
[2:11:10] materialize that hat would be moved to
[2:11:12] the place it was seen in the vision
[2:11:14] and he said about I love how he says
[2:11:16] things about the time I didn't think it
[2:11:18] was going to happen he said a lady would
[2:11:20] walk in pick up the Hat
[2:11:25] and the vision would materialize
[2:11:29] listen friends
[2:11:31] the man that you don't think is going to
[2:11:33] happen
[2:11:33] God will pick up that prodigal
[2:11:36] he'll put him in the house of God
[2:11:38] and the visual materialize

[2:12:05] other day I heard Brothers say something
[2:12:07] years ago
[2:12:08] he said people say the problem in the
[2:12:10] message the problem in the message the
[2:12:11] trouble with the messages
[2:12:13] he said that's not even worth repeating
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] he said the mess and the message he said
[2:12:19] that's like saying to a child that
[2:12:21] tripped and don't know how to put his
[2:12:23] shoe on you sorry rotten child
[2:12:26] he said we are not obligated to look at
[2:12:28] the negative
[2:12:30] we are obligated to look at the positive
[2:12:33] then they can come up with all the
[2:12:35] questions they want to I'm not obligated
[2:12:38] to look at the negative
[2:12:41] I'm obligated to look at the positive
[2:12:47] I gotta quit he said and the bride
[2:12:51] will come into preview

[2:17:16] books and tapes and pictures it would
[2:17:18] move into flesh and that flesh would
[2:17:21] move out into this crooked and perverse
[2:17:23] generation and they would shine as
[2:17:26] beacons of light clearly
[2:17:28] of Jesus Christ I commit this

[2:18:47] or did you learn it from the message
[2:18:50] did the message told you to take a
[2:18:52] picture that way or did you see it in a
[2:18:55] movie star or what people are doing on
[2:18:57] Tick Tock and you just copy that and you
[2:19:00] begin to imitate and project it you are
[2:19:04] reflecting Hollywood
[2:19:06] and you're gonna attract the wrong man
[2:19:09] or the wrong woman because you are
[2:19:12] projecting last Hollywood was meant to
[2:19:16] project lust
[2:19:18] the way the women are standing the way
[2:19:20] the pose the way they do the eyes the
[2:19:22] way the flip around like a snake and
[2:19:25] doing all of that it's all projecting
[2:19:28] lust brother brand I'm saying even the
[2:19:30] movement of a snake is connected to a
[2:19:33] lustful spirit
[2:19:35] so sister stop
[2:19:37] posting those kind of stuff
[2:19:40] amen led to whoever is reflecting that's
[2:19:43] a Pentecostal light let them reflect
[2:19:46] their light let the people outside in
[2:19:49] the world reflect the light we have a
[2:19:52] majestic
[2:19:53] a brightest the biggest light because
[2:19:57] what you're doing they already got tired
[2:20:00] of it
[2:20:01] they see that all the time they see that
[2:20:04] on Facebook but Ibraham said the reason
[2:20:06] why homosexuality happen is because
[2:20:10] women became cheap
[2:20:12] so they have seen so much until what
[2:20:15] you're trying to portray online you are
[2:20:18] just coping after what they see so
[2:20:21] you're not impressing nobody but what
[2:20:23] gonna impress somebody is when they see
[2:20:26] the that radiance
[2:20:28] that glow of Christ that's my brother
[2:20:31] preaching labor tonight where somebody
[2:20:34] look and they see a reflection of
[2:20:36] something different they say look at
[2:20:39] this woman she's different
[2:20:41] look at her picture she's different what
[2:20:45] kind of woman is this let that one glow
[2:20:49] that's the one that attract the elect
[2:20:52] that's the one that attract somebody and
[2:20:54] say let me ask you a question where do
[2:20:57] you live
[2:20:58] who's your father
[2:21:00] who are your parents which church do you
[2:21:02] go to
[2:21:03] amen that's what you want to attract
[2:21:06] don't copy after this world
[2:21:10] because there is a trend going on in a
[2:21:12] message
[2:21:13] where the sister can still have long
[2:21:15] dress
[2:21:17] they can still wear a long outfit but
[2:21:21] whatever they have the watches the this
[2:21:23] that this it's copying every single move
[2:21:26] whatever come on the market they have it
[2:21:28] what come on the market they have it
[2:21:29] what camera they don't see that you
[2:21:31] already got caught up into a worldly
[2:21:34] fashion movement that you're trying to
[2:21:37] match not as you're trying to compete
[2:21:40] with the world and prove that you're on
[2:21:42] the page
[2:21:43] that's not going to impress them that's
[2:21:45] what they do all the time all the video
[2:21:47] you can put all the posting all the
[2:21:50] Instagram all the Facebook everything
[2:21:52] that you do they know about it they want
[2:21:54] to see something different and God gave
[2:21:57] us something different it is the message
[2:21:59] of the hour this message purifies us it
[2:22:03] changes it transform until when somebody
[2:22:06] look at you they say what kind of speech
[2:22:08] is this when you begin to talk they say
[2:22:11] which world do you live in do you watch
[2:22:13] TV do you watch what is going on in the
[2:22:16] world you say I know what's going on in
[2:22:18] the world but yeah let me show you this
[2:22:19] in Prophecy look what the scripture say
[2:22:22] look what the scriptures say that is the
[2:22:24] light that are shining in this Center
[2:22:27] when Jesus say be ye the light of the
[2:22:29] world he was the LIE he did his part now
[2:22:32] it's the bright time to be the light of
[2:22:34] the world so when you are on your work
[2:22:36] don't try to copy don't try to make
[2:22:40] yourself cool
[2:22:42] boys don't try to make yourself cool at
[2:22:44] work and say you know come on man come
[2:22:46] on man and so so so so so you can fit
[2:22:49] everybody they already seen that they
[2:22:52] want to see a boy different
[2:22:54] you say well that is kind of being uh
[2:22:56] aristocratic or whatever yes sir yes no
[2:22:59] that's what makes you different but
[2:23:01] don't get into stuff you know cause
[2:23:03] what's going on because oh cause all
[2:23:06] kinds of stuff stop all those kind of
[2:23:08] things
[2:23:10] I know what I'm talking about because
[2:23:12] those things come with peer pressure we
[2:23:15] don't want to be in an environment where
[2:23:18] we're changing but we want to make sure
[2:23:20] we are ashamed
[2:23:22] we are kind of ashamed of Our Gospel so
[2:23:25] we want to blend with our friend to make
[2:23:27] sure they don't see us as Cece
[2:23:30] amen and when you do that you are
[2:23:32] compromising and one of this day the
[2:23:35] people will ask you so you were going in
[2:23:37] this church to behaving the way you were
[2:23:39] doing I'm shocked this is the church you
[2:23:42] were going you don't want that testimony
[2:23:44] on you you want a testimony that we work
[2:23:46] with this person for 20 years this
[2:23:49] person is different
[2:23:50] we want to be like and you will hear
[2:23:52] people coming to you and say when you go
[2:23:54] to your church pray for my uncle
[2:23:56] pray for my family pray for something
[2:23:59] you know something is happening you have
[2:24:02] been impacting lives the only Jesus the
[2:24:06] only last option of Jesus people we see
[2:24:09] is going to be you what you put on your
[2:24:12] WhatsApp what you put on your Facebook
[2:24:14] it shows what you believe what you
[2:24:17] support and what you're doing
[2:24:20] you don't wear high heels don't post
[2:24:22] somebody with high heel because you're
[2:24:24] giving a wrong information
[2:24:27] you don't wear pants you don't post
[2:24:28] somebody a woman wearing pants you don't
[2:24:31] wear them because you're giving a wrong
[2:24:33] information the day people will know
[2:24:35] they say wait a minute you also pray in
[2:24:36] that chair so why do you behave like
[2:24:38] that no we want to be the light God is
[2:24:42] in this church
[2:24:43] God is working powerfully I've seen
[2:24:46] Miracle I've seen people's life
[2:24:48] delivered in this church I've seen
[2:24:50] people life transformed our sin demon

[2:25:00] but I know what I'm talking about amen
[2:25:02] that's why I go home and I have a fight
[2:25:04] to myself

[2:25:07] could he will pray and cast our devil
[2:25:09] when he goes back all the demon follow
[2:25:11] him where he was in uh in a hotel to try
[2:25:14] to fight him

[2:25:23] back up and move forward and before you
[2:25:25] know it I'm free amen so remember spoken
[2:25:29] word you now put in this position for
[2:25:31] nothing

[2:25:43] never existed again left the message
[2:25:45] then there was another message Church in
[2:25:47] this area
[2:25:48] and never again and God took another
[2:25:50] church and put it back in here what is
[2:25:52] God saying
[2:25:55] what is God saying in this area this is
[2:25:57] the third one
[2:25:59] Perfection this is the third one what is
[2:26:01] God saying you cannot defeat my message
[2:26:05] I'm gonna put one there and prove to you
[2:26:08] that in the midst of a wicked crooked
[2:26:11] generation I can pull the bread and show
[2:26:14] you that I am God and I change not
[2:26:17] this is why you are brought in this
[2:26:19] church this is why you're in this church
[2:26:23] not to be in another church but to be
[2:26:25] the bride the word is made flesh and
[2:26:28] everywhere you're going you are the salt
