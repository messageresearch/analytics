[Music] amen yeah so um last monday um this song um kept coming to me and i was singing it the whole day so in um during the afternoon i was singing the song to my husband and i was telling him how the song is really short and i really wish i can add some of the lyrics to it so in the car i wrote like the second stanza of the song so later on in the evening i kept singing the song but i didn't know why the song kept coming then i remembered it was exactly one year i had a surgery um they took out my thyroid and when they i had that surgery um a week before the surgery they took the thyroid they did a biopsy test and they they did it to find out if it's there is a cancer or anything and they couldn't find anything so a week later they did the surgery and it was a very um it was very intense that i ended up in the icu so when i was discharged two weeks later i went to do a follow up with the doctor and he was telling me that mr close you are a miracle because after the surgery they did the thyroid they took out they tested and found out that it had cancer and for them for the tarot to turn into cancer that means it's been sitting there for quite a long time it's been more than a year so he was like that thing could have moved to your lungs and you would have been dead but what surprises him is they did a week to the surgery they did a biopsy test and couldn't find anything but he told me they've taken everything out and there is nothing to worry about so i lost before the surgery he told me i was gonna lose 25 percent of my vocal cord i wouldn't be able to sing you know so it was i couldn't talk and he said i need to do a speech therapy and if that does not work then they have to go back in and fix the vocal cord but then he says something he said i know you're a miracle child and god is going to see you through this too and i really believed in that and today i'm here singing and i really want to sing the song i wrote i want to sing to glorify the name of the lord amen amen i'm a little nervous amen this song is from my heart you are amazing you are a good good god this life is yours you've been so good to me this mortal journey [Music] song forever from my heart you are amazing you are a good good life is yours you've been so good to me [Music] this mortal journey forever [Music] this song is from my heart you are amazing you are a good good god this life is yours you've been so good to me this small toe journey forever [Music] you are this life is yours you've been so good to me this morning [Music] amen and amen amen amen we thank the lord for that testimony amen amen she said so much about that amen i don't have to add any amen so invite our brother who has a testimony man amen praise the lord everybody god is good [Music] all the time said he plays this song in this heart of mind i'm not gonna say it it's just how god good just how good god is it's great to see his unfailing word come to pass right in front of your eyes when you see death's door my mother at death's door and you been in prayer and as i said this never failing word just comes to pass and she's doing just so wonderful today she's 88 years old she had a massive heart attack and all the other stuff that goes with it but god does deliverer but what i would love if it doesn't take up too much time if the sisters would sing the goodness of god for his glory amen amen amen amen well it's a request tonight amen so i'm over to you sisters amen the goodness of god amen [Music] i love you lord for your mercy never fails me [Music] oh i will sing of the

many are up to date to the sermon with the sermon let me see your hand okay okay okay okay praise be the name of the lord amen that's wonderful i believe lord's willing the building fund is for this coming sunday amen okay let's go to our scripture tonight first corinthians chapter one amen a lot of folks out first corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 if you're there you can say amen now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing you might be seated paul is asking the church number one he want them to all everybody speak the same thing how can you think speak the same thing when you're in different churches [Laughter] i wish the whole church was here how can you speak the same thing if paul is asking them to say to speak the same thing that mean something is wrong amen it means they were not really speaking the same thing so there is a difference right here there is a difference right here in sermon or in preaching i have to reach a certain point so you'll be ready for sunday amen now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing watch now come on and that there be no what speak the same thing the second thing is what no division because when we begin to speak different things one from another then we are divided everybody here paul was the messenger of the age paul was the pastor of the age and paul is instructing the age the people to stay to speak the same thing because when they don't speak the same thing it's going to cause confusion and bring the vision amen hallelujah that there be no division among you but that you perfectly join together amen perfectly how can you be joined together perfectly you must have a bond of perfection everybody paul want them to be joined perfectly join perfectly everybody care but to be joined perfectly you need the bound of love because the bond of love is the bond of perfection you know that scripture right so you need love but who give love you remember roman 5 who shared the love of god in your heart thank you everybody the holy ghost holy ghost brings the love of god and you abandoned perfectly amen blessed be the name of the lord but that should be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same water the mind this joint must be in the same mind and the same word anybody care in other words if i see something wrong here there is no way you can make it right let me repeat it again if you see something wrong there is no way i can say it's right if it's wrong by the word is that okay now in other words when the word declare it wrong me and you we must speak the same thing we cannot say it's right when the word is already saying wrong because sometimes you bring up something and somebody will say well i don't see anything wrong with it so we are speaking two different languages amen hallelujah i wish this whole church was here amen for it has been declared to me of you my brethren [Music] what did you declare it paul what what what some what did somebody report to you it has been declared to you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that they are contentions among you in either world they are they are argument quarrel among you the reason why i want you to all speak the same thing no division i want you to be perfectly joined same mind same judgment in other words when they speak to one and they speak to somebody else you cannot break into in between them do you hear me if i'm speaking to brother kelly and i speak to brother mike daly you will think we were speaking other words it's just like you're speaking to the same person amen and when there is a unity like that you cannot break it then everything is strong if brother mike can barely speak one thing and brother kelly speaks something different the devil understand that there is a season then the devil can begin to work but if you come to brother mike devi there you say no it's wrong you go to brother kerry brother kelly say no it's wrong in other words when you go to daddy daddy say it's wrong if you try to work with mommy mommy say it's wrong then the child will change [Music] if daddy say it's wrong and mom is the loser then the child understand if mommy is the one standing firm and that is the loss then the child will understand where to work because you're not speaking the same language everybody okay and uh and this is a result of query contentions contention contentions under a church of paul was paul wrong was paul arguing amen let's go to verse 12. now this i say that every one of you say i am of paul everybody here everybody say i am of paul and i of apollos and i of who save us and i of who four people among this group under the messenger of paul some got caught up with paul sam got caught up with cephas which is peter everybody some got caught up with apollos a teacher right and some caught up with christ this one we must say this is a good one because it's crust that's that's the tendency or the one with paul is wrong the one with her powers is wrong the one is this this maybe the one with christ is right all of them are wrong because they are doing this under contention i hope the whole church will listen to this because somebody need to come out certain things and then we move on roof serving amen hallelujah i thank god uh verse 13 is christ divided you say you are of christ but why do you have division if you really got into christ why do you have a division so your clinging to christ is not correct it's not genuine amen everybody even though you say christ because we know the message is christ anybody here even you're clinging to the message of the hour amen but you are wrong not because christ is wrong oh my god is christ divided was paul crucified for you when he speak about christ he's not saying was christ crucified for you because we already know christ is he divided no because the body is one everybody but when it comes to paul he says is paul crucified for you everybody how can paul get to the point where he begin to ask them of the crucifixion because we know the one who was crucified was jesus christ was christ was paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of water if you notice paul is not touching cephas and apollos it's about the crucifixion and the water what do you see there okay somebody begin to read what do you see between the two crucify the altar everybody and the baptist may deliver other court all over the scripture now your eyes are open amen let's go to galatians chapter one hallelujah oh that's a tabernacle language amen lord help me with time wednesday galatians chapter 1 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen for you have heard of my conversation the devil is playing around but he's wasting his time you have heard of my that conversation.com doesn't mean talking amen it means my way of life or my previous life my life everybody you have heard of my life or my conversation in time past in the jewish religion everybody here how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted so paul under religion not any kind of religion not a worldly religion under a jewish religion america we thought by religion he's going to be a good man but he ended up doing what he persecuted everybody and wasted the church how can you be under the religion of a jewish and you're persecuting the church and destroying the church in the presence of working or doing service for god amen verse 14 and prophetic in the jewish religion above many my equals my own age in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the gospel of god okay somebody is awake he's zeal was not about the gospel he's beat his zeal i was zealous of the tradition of my father amen there is a difference between the law and the tradition everybody the law was the word of god given anybody care but the traditions where a hanged down belief no something that the people believe have belief and that the they gave it back to somebody else down they transferred because remember jesus say by your water by your tradition you remember mark 7 you make the word the word of god of water so tradition destroyed the word of god the word of god is pure that's the law do not kill do not steal no problem anybody here when you go to the altar this is what you do but when the pharisee came they begin to chant they say no if you swear by the altar you remember or if you swear by the gift of the altar that is a tradition they begin to destroy the word of god anybody care so paul was not zealous really of the word of god because if you believe the word of god that came by moses jesus taught the pharisee if you would have believed moses you would have done water automatically you're going to believe me anybody care so when you have the zeal for the word of god it will lead you to jesus christ but when you have deserved for the traditions of the fathers everybody here the tradition that somebody took from the law and built anybody here then you can find yourself persecuting something that is correct of fighting against the very manifested word of the hour or finding a guest somebody who have a good position in the world because your pr in other words when people preach some people preach through the word of god and some people preach through the tradition that they receive from somebody else the one under tradition have a tendency to persecute the one that is staying with the world the one under tradition have a tendency to persecute the one that sticks with the message of the hour [Music] i hope minister will learn a lesson not you here i'm talking about somebody who's going to get in anybody care but hallelujah i have to change the battery the battery is seven hours or something are you okay with my voice if not i take the bazooka but i love to be free amen okay give me one second you got it okay praise god verse 15 but when he please god who separated me from my mother's womb everybody and call me by his water this thing that spared paul is because he was predestinated anybody care if he was not for predestination paul would have stuck here and go straight to hell amen so what saved paul was predestination and predestination with what grace anybody care if that does not you're going to stack yourself under someone anybody here to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the hidden immediately in other words grace came to me when i was not even prepared one second praise god it's good okay so how many minutes did i lose by this somebody need to pay you back [Music] [Laughter] amen all right now you say but when he please god who separated me in other words in an appropriate time anybody care god came to me by grace when i was not even prepared and the reason why he came to me by grace remember on the road to damascus he told he paul he said why do you persecuted me amen when paul when god went to ananias and begin to speak to ananias god told ananias that paul was a chosen vessel anybody so because of predestination grace came to me everybody and when grace came to paul who was under the tradition of the father what was the reaction of paul when grace came to him everybody okay he said verse 16 to reveal his son in me so now his personal revelation now he understand who jesus is that oh the lord the jehovah of the old testament now which jesus christ now his son is revealing me paul hey mark here that i might preach him among the hidden i need you paul immediately i confess not with flesh and blood anybody care so when that experience happened to me paul i learned a lesson anybody here i am no more trusting under men because i was doing this under men the high priest gave me the letter to go persecute people i was working for man everybody now that now i have a personal contact with jesus christ now from there on i learn not to be behind man everybody here because being behind what men were preaching caused me to persecute the word of god now i compare no more to flesh and blood no more am i following flesh and blood amen i never got converted and suddenly i'm looking where are the disciples of jesus christ peter peter tell me about jesus christ because i made the same mistake everybody okay but when paul we when paul separated himself and he came back he could rebuke peter [Music] and peter started before him [Music] this is tough everybody okay verse 17 neither went i up to water why you didn't go to jerusalem because the disciples are there normally you should go oh this is a wonderful news i need to go to the people that are preaching this news paul say i don't want to make that mistake again i was under the pharisee look what i did let me go back to myself and let me and the author of the world deal together because somebody told brother branham he said you don't know your bible brother branham says certainly i don't know my bible but i know the altar let me have a talk with the author so when i had an experience i have to separate a little bit and spend time with the author then i can go back to the prison and when paul goes to the present no influence he knows where he's standing you cannot push him around amen neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were what apostle when i didn't search quickly for who was with jesus quickly i learned amen everybody here i learned from there i'm gonna go to them later let me make sure me i understand what i am in anybody here but went into arabia and returned again to water then after how many years it took three years of separation no phone calls nothing why paul i want to be taught by the author of the book everybody here because if i make a mistake i might be repeating peter [Music] anybody here i can get caught up beyond peter remember the que the the christian of corinthians were caught up behind peter some were caught up behind apollos some were caught up behind paul oh god help me anybody care then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see who now me and peter we can talk about here and aboard with him 15 days and brother branham said when they met together because paul was already preaching without peter everybody here when paul and peter met together they are talking the same language brother kelly paul peter started before paul years ago but when they sit with peter they are fellowshipping when peter said remember the brazen altar he said yes i saw it too i preached it the other day too two years ago i preached it amen amen let's go to james chapter 2. oh god help me out hallelujah james chapter 2 verse 22. if you're there you can say amen say you have faith wrote with his work and by work was faith made what gems is moving not only faith you got to connect work you got to move not only justify you need to go to the holy place amen you are saying justify justify justify paul james say you need to move on you're already done here you already completed you already plot to the other core now you need to move on to the holy place you cannot have the other coat without the holy place coming up accepting for you in the death bed or you at the cross there is no way you got to go hey amen he says here verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which say abraham believed god and he was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works managed justify and not by what likewise also was rahab the harlot remember on sunday amen when she received the messenger we would go back to rehab again and had send them out another way go to james chapter four if you're there you can say amen verse one from where comes wars and what fighting among you remember james is under the holy place paul said justify by faith the calvinist took it do you remember the armenians say we go by james works hey so james say welcome for uh come wars and fighting among you come then not hear even of your own what that war in your water so james is saying that the world that you have and the fighting that you have among you is coming from something that is still in your flesh here and we know the flesh is the other court here there is something in the other court that is causing the fastest remember paul in the conte in the corinthian church say i don't want you to have what because you have anybody okay let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for your presence here tonight and thank you for giving us an opportunity to be again into your house lord we have done what any man that you give ability to do can do father read the word of the scripture but it takes the holy spirit to unfold it to bless to heal to change father to reveal your word all of that takes the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come tonight and speak to your children strengthen this church lord and may you open up your word so that they can receive the thought that you're trying to deliver tonight lord father we commit everything be the alpha and the omega in the name of jesus christ amen all right i'm going to read one more scripture in the book of revelation the bible says in revelation 3 verse 1 and unto the angel of the age of sardis the age of saudis is the age of luther everybody okay sardis deal with luther anybody care these things say he that has the seven spirits of god we will handle it on sunday lord dwelling and the seven stars and i know that works the lutheran head works we thought the work was under um under the holy place i know that works what are the words that that has and what the words of the luther was a name amen not the name but a name because the name is the name of jesus christ the church bear the name of jesus christ but the lutheran have another name a new name which is not the name of jesus christ amen i know that you have a name that that livest and our work you cannot have the name of jesus christ and be dead america because he's the name of the high priest when you put him into the holiest you're going to have a resurrection but this name that the lutheran have is a name that when you have it you appear to be alive but spiritually you are dead naturally in that name in the nature you are alive people knows you but in the spiritual in the eyes of god when you carry that name you are dead and brother branham said that name was denomination it can be baptised it can be meptoids it can be whatever anybody care when you carry denomination or organization ever here you can exist in this world you can be recognized by the state all over the world but in the eyes of god you are dead because luther his plateau was the just they just shall live by what once you reach faith that's it he cannot produce work that is the second stage that is coming up with wesley so when they push not by the word of god but in a different way they produce name and the name produce works but those works are wrong before god everybody okay so far hallelujah relax we'll be okay be watchful brother branham say that word means alert and strengthen the things which remain brother branham said the things that were taught to them that are ready to water brother branham said die because they're going under organization they started good but whatever they built is ready to die everybody care now because they're gonna go into organization for i have not found that works what it was unfulfilled before who not before man before man it looks good it's a big church we are blossom we're doing great things but when god looks multiplied by zero dead before god what are we talking about tonight we started on the four fences of roof roof serving that was on sunday before we continue with roof serving i would like to open a bracket a parenthesis because if we don't get this you're not going to understand what is coming up with roof serving tonight is part nine roof under calvinism you ready when we spoke about confidence we talking about calvin all right say tight when we deal with the tabernacle we found out in the journey of roof that roof entered through the gate you already understand that he moved into roof deciding on the justification he went she went to the altar and then she went to the water baptism back here then we positioned ruth in the outer court and after that brother branham said that the messenger also are connected with this but we found out that the messenger have big babies luther have calvin wesley have armenians ever care and on sunday we move from the water baptism into the holy place roof serving where we're dealing with the holy place and moon and roof move up so in the holy place here we started with the candlestick last sunday we stopped somewhere everybody okay so before we move forward it is important to check calvin why is it important to understand calvin calvin was a deviation of luther everybody okay calvin luther came and say they just shall live by faith justification ever here luther preach his message reach his limit his talent and stop everybody when calvin came he took luther into an extreme that's why brother branham said he was an error anybody okay calvin took luther to the extreme he was a deviation from luther just like when wesley came wesley brought sanctification every care but when our menus came he took the out that's the sanctification to the extreme which became a deviation okay back here so the extremity of cavern amen was the very cause of the birth of wesley i will give you quote down the road i was removing but let me just quieten your nerve with one so calvin when he came he brought so much trouble until those trouble birth wesley brother brown says this i believe you and the camera are pretty good he says in the message birthman brother branham say then when the calvinist got the ugly or the anglican church in such a condition under the calvinistic doctrine until god raised up a water armenian doctrine which was who john wesley the old system had to do what in order for the new one to do whatever to come on i'm gonna give you a quote down the road where brother branham say wesley have to come to balance what calvin causes so calvin is the cause of god now opening the door unto sanctification because the church and the calvin got into a bad situation ruth under calvinism where are you taking me out if you remember when we spoke about the reformers luther and wesley were our reformers down the road i gave you the quote about the pentecostal everybody okay so far now luther and wesley had people that came under their ministry everybody okay they have babies and the biggest baby for luther and wesley one was calvin and another one was armenian the concept of babies under the messenger is very important anybody here when a messenger comes and he brings a message babies will be born under the messenger [Music] if you go to the book of joshua chapter 1 verse 1 the bible says that now after the death of who moses the prophet moses the messenger moses the man of god for the hour moses the great prophet of exodus when he came he preached and he finished his ministry moses left something to israel everybody okay moses didn't leave israel bear moses produced the law everybody care which was the word of god because the bible say that the law came by who moses and grace came by jesus christ ever care so not only did moses produce the law but when moses was alive we found out that there were young men that were born under moses everybody okay one day god told moses come to the mountain when moses was coming to the mountain god tell him you tell you come with the elder but make sure all the elders stays there you and who and joshua come up a little bit higher so joshua was birthed everybody okay under the ministry of moses and he has been trained under moses we're talking about babies under a messenger anybody here the bible says here that he came after the death the departure of moses moses is no longer on the scene but moses left the word of god everybody can use the word and continue with god he came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of none moses water so moses had a minister that came under him and that minister was joshua anybody here but the problem is this when you are born under a prophet when you are born under a messenger when you are born under a major pastor of the edge there are certain condition that you must follow amen everybody okay what are those conditions brother stephen stay tight on the internet joshua 1 verse 5 god said there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of your life everybody will say amen what a promise praise god as i was with who joshua you are a a minister that is born under moses and since you are born under moses everybody okay as i was with moses anybody okay i'm gonna continue with you everybody okay moses didn't get to the promised land god took him off but joshua had the responsibility to take as a minister to take israel all the children of god and make sure they'll go all the way into the promised land and position everybody in the press ever here blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said the peanut of fire that was with moses everybody turned to the captain of the host we already went into that it was the same characteristic take off your shoes take off your shoe the same thing it's just the pillar of fire immorphy into a man everybody okay now he said as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee maybe joshua got excited he said praise god thank you jesus thank you lord he said be strong yes father and of good courage for unto these people shall that divide for an inheritance the land we shall swear unto the father to give them only be strong and very courageous joshua say thank you lord thank you jesus what is wrong that damn mayors observed to do according to water when you are born under a ministry like moses under a messenger under prophet they are conditioned that you must be under you must do all that the messenger told you to do everybody okay i'm going slowly amen which moses my servant commanded you turn not from me to the water or to the water in other words there is no room for deviation amen ever here so when you are a baby under a messenger i hope minister in the message understand this you must be careful how you are handling the words that has been handed to you because the law came from monsanto god came down and gave the law to moses and we saw under the unchanging pattern of god that the law came not only by god he came with angels do you remember do you remember that amen you don't remember anymore go to detroit 33. do it around on me 33. that's why you keep hearing me do you are you staying with the sermon let's go to deuteronomy uh deuteronomy 32 are you there 33 verse 2. if you're there you can say amen you there pages are flipping there okay verse two and he said who came down the lord came down from what sana and rose up from sir to them he shunned forth from man's parent and he came with ten thousands of cents from his what so on mount sana this is the mountain the lord came down brother robert the lord himself shall come down everybody here when he came dimension about which hand the right hand what is in the right hand of god everybody okay everybody okay is it clicking do you see what i'm trying to say can you read between the line okay in his from his right hand went outward a fiery law so the law so when god came down in his right hand was what there was a law but the law was fiery because remember in the garden of eden the caribbean had a water a flaming sword about here because it's a judgment the penalty of sin is not paid yet but here so when the law came the law came with fury back here flaming that's why the law was not joking you do something wrong god kill you you do something wrong god kills you a fairy law came back here a fairy lord came for them ever here let's go to act the lord came got to act chapter seven the law came the lord came when he came down in his right hand there is a law ever here we all been preaching to the people based on the movie that when moses went to the mountain god came and god was speaking to moses that's the way we grow up with the movie we thought he was god alone with moses but let's see what happened ever here when they say they say the lord came so you think it's god himself anybody here actor chapter 7 verse 53 you're there you can say amen are you there all right i want you to see it acts 7 53 i don't want you to say brother stephen saying are you there verse 53 who has received the water the law by the disposition of water how many angels plural so when you take this in deuteronomy and you take act seven god was not alone everybody okay god came with angels [Music] everybody okay angels we have not kept anybody here so god with a host of angels came down on the mountain meet a prophet and give him the love from his right hand and in revelation 10 [Music] we found the mighty angel came down christ with a little book but that book was no longer a fairy it was a book that was open because the lamb has paid the price he had broken the seals now he can come and give to john when john eat it it's not fairy it is sweet because the lamb played the person but if you look in revelation it only say one angel everybody okay but when the fulfillment happened on sunset mountain instead of one angel which was the one with uh with a chest like this which was crushed we found christ accompanied with angels this message is perfectly in line with the scripture everybody okay so when you are born under a messenger like that you need to be careful to keep the law and you cannot deviate from that message of the messenger to the right or to the left hallelujah that that means the water so your prosperity is determined by how your prosperity is determined but how genuinely you are attached to the word that was revealed to you anybody here with your everyday voice this book of the lord that came by moses that came on sunset mountain shall not depart out of your water you cannot have a longer conversation without talking about what you believe especially the sisters ever here but that shall meditate there in what meditate what the lord the message you shall meditate upon it day and night that that may observe to do what according to what how that is written therein for them when you do that do that shall make that way out and that's a half water you want to have good success you want to be prosperous stay with the message that has been delivered by your god [Music] hallelujah because the bible said in ii close nicole 20 20 believe in the lord your god so shall he be what believe his word so shall he what your prosperity your success is determined but have faithfully genuinely you stay and you stick with the message that have been delivered by your messenger when you're a baby you need to stay that way everybody okay so far babies and their ministry must remain faithful to what has been delivered to them everybody care roof under calvin now these four group we know luther produces the lutheran church calvin de calvinis west lady wesleyan armenian the armenians i mean armenians armenianism when brother branham came he looked through this and brother madame say all of them can be put in two categories and these two categories we know influences the ages up to today and the influences also marriages everybody clear so far now we already dealt with roof under luther we are dealing with roof under calvinism so you will understand what happened here what is going on as a reminder brother branham say that there is two great school of doctrine in church one of them is calvinism and the other armenianism one of them is water and the other is water so we are dealing with grace and legalism what kind of grace and work and the legalist there is a good legalist and there is a bad one you will see that on the roof serving everybody okay and we come to fund out of that that the people who believe in grace the calvinist the covenants they say bless god he don't hurt me to do whatever. everybody okay okay can i erase this i'm not calvinist anybody here under calvinist roof under calvinist and the calvinist which is grace anybody here they say that it doesn't hurt them to smoke everybody it's a christian with wrong habit anybody care he don't hurt me to drink i'm a christian but it doesn't hurt me i can do these things i got what so covenants preach strongly on eternal security in other words i am already saved i am already guaranteed no matter what happened in my life i will make it to heaven that is true but you must stay with what luther was saying anybody here a deviation from luther made somebody believe like because i am eternally secure no matter what i do god is doom roof under cover everybody here the legalistic side which i won't take today i would like to ball him out i would like to show him a piece of my mind but i'm a christian i have to keep it still let's go to that let's stay on the calvinism we will get that under armenianism everybody clear now we're dealing with calvin brother branham said baptist coming baptize a couple over here in immersing and the preacher baptized them nine out of what the people believed the lord they gave their hearts to the lord they say we are christian we believe on the lord jesus christ we're going to the present altar but after going to the present altar they take them to the level and they begin to baptize them when they baptize them they look 10 people were baptized but nine of them have a problem a roof under calvinist none of them do water smoke cigarettes go back out and stand out there and play card bunker all night run around and crooked business deal and all women wearing water running around in the street and bobbing their hair and smoking and talking and little seats and sew parties and telling what what is wrong this message anda luther came for justification to serve us we are baptized we should have seen a change in the life but for some reason the more the baptist the majority 99 percent 90 percent of the people baptized can't get away from wrong habit roof under calvinism everybody okay you caught that christianity and you think you got water the problem is the teaching of eternal security under heaven amen nail eternal security to the point that somebody can be doing everything that they were doing before under the practice that they already saved they will make it to heaven eternal security brother branham say you are going to hell with your eternal security brother stephen this is calvin we are in the message roof and the calvinism calvin said if you just believe the word that's saying as long as you believe the message that said and we found people in the message still with wrong habit preachers with round habits roof under calvinist 20 years in the message lying 20 years in the message problem 20 years preaching the message a big hypocrite roof under cabinet the seals are broken so you can see this arrow and you can deviate those errors and then keep the correct line everybody okay you would not enjoy yourself in heaven in any manner do you think you can go to heaven smoking cigarettes do you think you can go to heaven having that girlfriend or boyfriend of you of the world you believe in the message amen amen certainly not that is not eternal security but when a man is water the holiest the holiest what is good eternal security brother stephen roof and the calvinist the bible brother branham said i believe this in eternal security i believe the church has eternal security any readers of the bible knows that because god's already said it will appear younger without what there is already a promise no matter what happened i'm going to come out right that's okay that's right then it's going to be there the church is eternally water now are you in the church is the next thing brother branham is saying god has a church this is the church of god which is calling the scripture and by brother branham the bride of jesus christ if you need the scripture you save me you are here you're saying you are in the camp you're saying you are eternally security brother branham said i do believe that the eternal security one is the church can i start again this church is the body of jesus christ jesus himself is the head everybody that's why when the picture of the constellation was taken because he was crushed that came down he only appeared the head not the body everybody okay telling you that it is on me christ that's why brother branham said this is our lord right there look at his nose look at his beard look at his eyes because it's quest but not the body do you follow me christ is eternally secured the body of christ is eternally secured [Music] so if you want to be eternally secure you must be in this body your eternal security is not you it is somebody else so you must enter into that person and when you enter in that person you disappear and when they look at you they don't see you anymore they see eternal security eternal security eternal security eternal security eternal security because you are disappearing in christ [Applause] father help me i mean 30 percent lord help me i hope i can finish this it will help me on sunday everybody okay what is that brother pranama if you are in the church all right you are water with water in other words to call yourself security you gotta help in the church once you enter in the church you become secure not you the church makes you secure not the building but a body anybody care but you better water and how do you get in there that's that's where the problem is now brother stephen i want that eternal security how do you get it it's in the church in other words church is called eternal security if you enter there you pick up eternal security but how do you enter back here how do you get in the church by shaking hands putting your name in the book by what in other words only the baptism of the holy ghost will put you into the water eternal security is true but for you to be sure you are eternally secure you must enter the hundreds then it's finished but to enter the holiest you got to pass through the other court through the holy place and then the holiest the calvin thought he under he he didn't understand he was under luther he pushed so hard and convinced the people under luther that they are already in the holiest back here when they grab that revelation without the life without the experience [Music] you are trying to draw blood out of a turnip there is no blood what comes up is smoking cigarettes everything else false pretense rule from the calvinist hey but here and that body god judges cavalry was the body of who we are baptized into that body by what we have what as long as we are in the body of who nothing can water nothing can do what the devil even cannot touch you because you are sealed until the day of water redemption if you go out you go out by your own water but just that sure if you are in the body of christ as sure as christ rose from the dead you shall do what because if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwelleth in water then you have eternal security you shall quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you this message is yummy my friend ruth undercoverness calvinism cannot continue he preached eternal security no changes in the in the believer's life what else with kavanaugh don't go plumb too far over here on the calvinistic side once great water calvinist one's grace always anybody here you're coming from the from the hotel with a prostitute always grace i'm already safe anybody here because you shall get in water what kevin thought was grace he brought this grace back here just a moment we shall get time this week to bring that up and show you how level it is observing but don't think just because you've done something wrong that you are gone water you're a child of god you are born of the water in other words you can have the holy ghost that make a mistake but quickly the spirit brings you up and you continue eternally secure you don't enjoy the mistake and the mistake happened by accident not that you woke up and you god do something wrong you are pushed to the corner and you slip up because of the flesh everybody okay you are sons and daughters of god the water in the holiest will bear record of itself there you are everybody cares so far calvinism have a problem with the book of life he that overcome i will not blot his name out of the book of life calvin preach the book of life the book of life the book of life how about blood i would not everybody care he that overcometh i will not blow it out in other words cannot be erased but when i'm saying once again we come to a most difficult portion of the world this verse superficially regarded will be used by both water and water to do what to suit their purpose let me jump armenian i'm chained with calvin armenians make the will of the father not a sovereign will but merely a complacent desire as he stand back to see what all men do with his good and gracious gift and even life eternal the armenianists think that god doesn't have a sovereign decision they think that god put people in the world and begin to see how you react and when you do good god said i'm gonna save you when you do bad you are too bad you killed too many people you did this you did this you did this you are going to hell everybody here that's armenianism everybody okay but companies cling to the sovereignty of god they love the sovereignty of god because one save our savior everybody okay the companies do not see that they say in this verse strong word given to the water burden sent that no matter how evil at the time how terrible the persecution because the overcomer is the one who does what have you received the holy ghost since you to them looter belief justification is enough no bloating from the book of life ever here believe that jesus is the christ he will not have his name what because i believed i went to the present altar i cannot have my name judah also believed the bible said that the devil believes but judah's name was removed from the book of life calvin missed that once you went to the altar god will never remove you from the book of life that's it no matter what i do i'm going to stay in the book of life correction i believe that god knew before the foundation of the world chose his church in christ and slay christ before the foundation of the world scriptures say he was the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world and jesus said that he knew us before the water we believed that he knew us and predestined us unto adoption of the children by water before the world ever worked that is good our so don't worry the will are turning just right everything coming just in time the only thing is getting the water and that's the good part about it then you know how they work hard to work when you get in the water as soon as you engage correctly that said god take over roof and the calvinism ever here the problem with kevin kevin missed something that's why he went in the deep end what did calvin missed number one everybody here brother madam say we believe in justification by faith romans 5 11 we believe that a per that after a person being justified by what he completed the other court he has peace with the lord jesus his disposition chain but it is possible that the same person could have water such as water drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habit of the water that's what calvin missed that's why when they were baptizing the people nine out of ten continue with wrong habit and craft and came and strengthened them that you have eternal security if you only believed everybody okay what else sixty foul brother branham say here is the human heart you know that right and here is the human heart too hard this one over here has a dove in it no let me start here now this one over here he has a water justify wrong habit first key where is the source of this wrong habit the source of the wrong habit is what snake calvin didn't understand this if you look at this quote he's after the opening of the seals you see that he said this one over here have snacking that is what snake is speaking of sin this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life well this one here everybody here he has water malice is here and what hatred is here and water envy what is causing it is this fellow here the snake nandy when you are asked oh you are forgiven of your sin you have only done this take away but the thing that made you do it all your passing are completely gone but the thing that makes you do it that all the root of what that snake that all the root of evil it's still there calvin didn't understand that anybody care notice then when you repent and are baptized in the name of jesus christ that he forgive you your sins but the snake is there everybody here brother branham say why didn't desire the man wesley luther and those great reformers who brought that justification sanctification the pentecostal age all three reformers with the baptism of the holy ghost and things why didn't they catch these messages why did indeed see this everybody here why didn't they get them because they were water this the reason that all destroying ends of the mysterious part of water the mysterious part of water and the mysterious part of water so when lute plateau he left out the mysterious part here in other words the bread came from god and luther began to eat the bread as lute was eating the bread he was eating the bread as a child and when child our children are eating rice they are left over that are falling off there are crumbs that are coming down and west now continued to eat and the crumbs came down but we the gentler we are dogs yes my father i am a dog i don't deserve the gentle table i'm after the crumbs i'm after the thunders the loose end they lost mysteries the last truth that's what i missed jesus turned around say woman it's already gone you touch the standard you touch the revelation of the thunder the loose end of luther they lose end of wesley they lose end of pentacles the constellation of seven engines bring everything together that's what we need for the redemption [Music] can you give me grace can you give me grace hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord that's the cause that's why calvin could not make it he could not take the people over there they lose him he was not your age it's unfulfilled everybody ever care cousin ruth undercovers christian with wrong habit eternal security thought wrong outside of the holy ghost once grace always grace leading to disgrace book of life save never to be blowed out lead to disgrace roof under calvin this is fine sardisian churches calvin these fun teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the basis of our modern printing princes our process was discovered facilitating the production of water when the age of luther came something happened in humanity i hope you're gonna catch it they invented the printing machine under loop but the robot is there everybody here and kevin pick it up and the message begin to go under books are you following me the message that luther was preaching on the pulpit the bible that they were talking about could go under prison it's a stage of calvinism it's the message in the infancy because the messenger is gone moses is taken off the prince begin to go the print begin to go the people in the message missed that they didn't know the devil was moving on ruth and the calvinism ever here the printing machine begin to go everybody here everybody here production of water all over because the messenger is gone everybody here that's we found the great hunger and demand for the water the people you gotta the books people who come even copy i hope you're getting that god raised up many many men of which luther was but what the messenger began to have babies yes kevin zwingli where the two other luminous besides days were many so after luther does that came and followed luther some begin to pick up a higher level when the books are going roof and cavern anybody okay many more who are not so well known all over the world however though all this was not water the work of calvin was not in vain where are you going brother stephen relax was nothing then why is he not even he causes a mess why is he not in vain everybody here do nothing then the mighty work of god was actually water by water demand arose under the printing machine the printing of books their work was very good but their message that was delivered was also hindered by those men don't worry my friend roof on the confidence my friend on the internet this is tough i'm preaching to this church anybody here it was if there was ever a time of what did not miss the denomination of what it was at the tragic time so the time of lutheran covenant was the time of denominational zeal the zeal is there but not for god the zeal that came was to build kingdoms to build moves they forgot the messenger gave the message they were going with the books but they're moving up they're going over here pulling bulletin but they are building kingdoms roof under calvinist brother branham was not telling you this thing for history it was a purpose amen communious wrote the word of communion described somebody called communion begin to explain the time of calvin what really was it he says wrote that one thing needful he compared the world in the time of calvin to the labyrinth you know the labyrinth right okay castle and show that the way out is by living what is needless and choosing the one thing need for which is what this man watch what happened during the time of covenant he said they're very there is only one thing that is necessary that is who christ which is the word of the hour but what i'm looking here is something else everybody here the great numbers of water under the books every year he says is the reason of multitude of water so the preaching of the message begin to divide the bride roof and the cavern it looks like they are moving for the messenger but as they're going out pulling books and moving out to spread the message they're actually cutting off the bride [Music] roof under luther under calvinist anybody here for which we will soon have no name left each church record itself as the water our at least the water the what truest part of it while among themselves they do what each other with the water everybody they have the right doctrine those are wrong our church is right those are wrong and it becomes fight on the pulpit [Music] among the minister when the printing books are going out at the infancy of the message the message was going out but we found that minister began to have trouble with other churches fighting he was roof and calvinist because kevin miss the advice of a baby born under a messenger when you a baby born and the messenger you must stay with the message don't deviate with it the one who went begin to spread it but the result is division you from that church we don't talk to you everybody okay anybody okay no reconciliation is to be hope between water under the same messenger beat their nest this minister don't talk to medicine minister they meet enmity with water they won't get along yet both of them are preaching the same message [Music] and the people under the church will pick up the spirit and don't talk to the people and the united churches [Music] he begin to create clicks everybody okay out of the bible they do what different water they have one bubble but when they come out they are forging doctrine from the same message here these are their water fortress and water bow works behind which they enchant themselves and resist our water we believe this with this move in the message and we got our weapon the other one believed this and they got their weapon now we got the return ministry the thunder's here this one here this one here this one here they forgot the purpose and the cabinets i'm preaching that so you who are still hooked to that need to come out everybody here i will not say that this confession of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are bad in themselves can i continue give me grace my friend everybody they become so however in that defeat the fire of water to this labyrinth of sex and various water one message too many tendencies the messenger didn't come with all of that he only preached one message but the babies that was born that pick up the message begin to create sex everybody here the love of water it becomes the message became for argument we are studying the message to lord ourself to meet one another and to start war cut coat cut coat cut cut coat they forgot the needful thing he was not said for that here what is attained by it has a single life of what ever been said political reconciliation brother i'm sorry for everything we preach on the pulpit tomorrow they come back again and they start again after they reconcile and they send a letter to all the churches to show that now we need good friendship political everybody here back here their number has only increased in divine services the word of god the word of preachers are usually heard more than the water my pastor said this in our church my pastor says this my pastor says this hardly you can give somebody the cut he will reject the court and he will cling to what his pastor say [Music] of apollos i appeal peter he's a preacher on fire he does a lot of miracles i love his ministry the others say i love apollos he teaches good i go with his ministry and the bride of jesus christ became divided the one with peter said we have the miracle we have mark 16. the one with apollo said you guys don't have the word when you receive the word you receive the holy ghost some say i'm not gonna get on that me i'm forecast the other one said no we it's by the branham it's power roof under heaviness everybody here the word or each one shadow as he pleases or kill time by learning water and disproving water instead of preaching the message they will prepare a sermon to destroy another doctrine when they come they're preaching to destroy the other doctrine they are the one goes and study and comes back to react back to the one who sent it roof and the calvinism amen everybody here the new birth and how a man must be changed is in into the likeness of christ has become the part the partaker of divine nature scarcely anything is water the believers that came into the message they were expecting to receive the message to grow now instead of receiving the message they are receiving the fighting that is going on in the message they don't tell them how to grow they don't tell them how to receive the holy ghost they know more about the fighting and the doctrine and this brother is wrong this brother is wrong this body is wrong and they found themselves the habit never left them 20 years in the message bad habit 20 years in a message bad habit because of confidence hallelujah scarcely of the power and the key the church has almost lost the power of burning only the power of losing the sacrament giving us a symbol of water i want you to speak one mind and love and our life of christ has been made an occasion of water beadiness and water and water look at the sound of the snake you see the sound of the snake the snake was already sitting there and the devil said let me shoot that weapon again i'm gonna get them amen the faith has been split into a thousand water leader part and you are made a heretic if there is one of them that do not matter you don't accept our doctrine you a devil you're gonna go to hell you must believe this way roof and the legalist anybody here hey but here now i just said that this era brother branham gave tremendous growth to the denomination of water we built move in the message under men this one have preachers behind him this one have a group of preachers under and the countries are divided with big pictures you go to this country you find like four preachers they control the entire country you go to another country you find three preachers they control the and now the younger ministers that are growing up they think like before they can have a ministry they have to be to a clique come out of those clique you don't need a clique you can stand yourself with the world what i'm saying if you were under a camp in this message come out of the camp [Applause] return back to the original roof and the calvinist have you there is a convention a certain trick will go in that convention the other one won't go another convention there somehow they will go over there those are the one go the message has been kept parted and clicks and you will see clicks here and clicks here and clicks here and clicks here and this one follow this click and this one follow this click and the believers are in war roof under carvings everybody here if the spirit attitude of what i am of four i am of what was ever exhibited it was water why such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were leaving a name but they were water they built move and once that preacher dead what else can you do now we begin to search for his son to take over and continue the move he become a succession i'm preaching to this church i'm preaching to this church we need to be free somebody asked me i say me you will search me for a long time you're not gonna find me in any clique i'm gonna stand into denomination i don't belong to any clique i will shake hand with this brother this brother this brother but i won't belong to your cliques i stick with the message if you want to chase me away that's fine but i will not bow down to any clique in the message what is the result looted through poor judgment incited to battle and thereby caused the death of mounted but zwingli party persecuted unto the prison the godly doctor uh hapmayer hope meyer and calvin did no less for he demanded to arrest who servatus who had seen and taught the water somebody got a revelation of the oneness of god because he's not under cover calvin do maneuver to destroy him somebody comes and begin to preach things from the message that you don't preach before you know it you call the pax to attack him because he doesn't belong to your clique he should remember and recognize us that we the elders paul say i confer to no blood and to know flesh i learned i made mistake by this kind of stuff everybody here he the state then tried his brother and cavendish and to calvin dismay he was burned at the stake now you say kevin believed something like that i didn't believe calvin kevin was a what kavan put a man to death because he baptized in water he was a rascal needed to be converted himself yes sir he's such an amen that killed a man for something like that that's horrible that is water because they don't belong to you i'm going to destroy them brother stephen we never kill somebody and never take somebody to the stake you people with these sublet temples that's always padding off into the mouth at somebody can't put up things like that be careful you are guilty if you speak a word against your brother that is not right not just go around and tear it down you don't have to stick a water a knife in the man's back to kill him you can break his water and do what kill his water speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as do what [Music] the cliques will pack they will take a story they don't even have time to call the brother they say brother we heard the story about you is that true no they cling with the pack this one brought the story so the story is true and the whole click reject you you didn't do anything nobody even came to ask you because you don't belong to them because they already have relationship built for years you are a new one they can destroy you they can destroy your influence they can say all kinds of stuff he believed polygamy calvinist [Music] you might as well shot him taught something that was not right about him he said kill his influence with the people and things like that you are guilty of it lose under confidence they hated him because they were jealous of him that is the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they are doing now if destroyed the influence of the message before the people then you got the think water the devil got in and destroyed amen because why did they try to do it because they were against all their creeds and all their church doctrine and everything that they believe in when you preach you begin to destroy them they pack again against you roof under legalism under calvinist what about i'm saying yeah i gotta stop let's go to philippian one roof under calvinist so when you read the church ages don't think you're reading stories the prophet is unfolding things that the bride should be aware and alert because the devil was coming with those weapon again and the bride missing everybody here let's go to philippians one verse six you there verse six being confidence of these very things brother charles that he which has began what a good work on you will perform it until the day of who jesus christ you ready job from verse 15. buckle up because i'm searching the airport you there you there on verse 15 some indeed preach what the message of the hour even of water and what look at the snake here preacher on the pulpit under justification did not understand that gift and calling were without repentance they trained them under a click and everybody want to build a kingdom ever here the preaching christ but the motive the heart from where the message is preached is a heart with envy and stuff they have a battling spirit combative spirit on the pulpit and some also of what some are preaching christ with a good heart so there is two kind of preaching that went out everybody here verse 16 the one preach christ of water let's see in the board here paul say what i found about you the gospel is preached for contention under calvinism the message is preached but the the the the zero the motive is contention is to debate is to disprove is to break somebody is to establish the owner roof under calvinist the contention not water that's why you don't see the product no holy ghost because god will not sanction that and the lord has been quiet and living people fighting fighting father and after 20 years you say how long did you believe the message 20 years and the acting like a devil because the holy ghost was blocked because of the way the sermon were preached was under a wrong motive ever here verse 16 the one preached christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add water to my water where is brother branham when he look he said is that what i left you everybody here verse 17 but the other of what knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel everybody here watch verse 18 brother steven they did a mess they preached the message like that brother branham say even the message of calvin were not in vain [Music] where did brother branham get that watch verse 18 paul say some of you are preaching the message wrong some are preaching that good but even the one that preached wrong let's see what he says verse 18 what then notwithstanding every way were there in water they were preaching the message in pretense because they know if they say they don't believe the message they will be cut off from the benefit the tithing will go the church will go everything will go so we must keep the message for pretense because that is our source of income that is where we can we have if we show our colors the brothers will cut us off so let me keep up hypocrites everybody here but whether in princess or in christ is what and i dare you to do what and we want her even though he looks bad but at least the message was spread now god is coming down and picking up his elect like paul and begin to unfold themselves the word and they let now begin to look and say now understand the message i'm not gonna be behind anymore preacher i'm not gonna be behind anymore move i'm not gonna be behind the clique i'm gonna be separated let me stay with my quest that's what paul said now his son is revealed on me i am free from man everything that i accounted that was a blessing paul say i look at them as done your friendship is done because in our friendship we were gossiping about the other brothers but now trust have revealed himself to me i understood the arrow i'm gonna stick with the message yeah you can continue with your move you can continue with your your big name you can continue with your popularity no i was behind man i'm so disappointed with this one this one i'm shocked let me stay with the message the message is pure this is where you are now come out of your calvinism come out of your preachers in the message come out of your favorite preacher come out of your favorite churches come out of your favorite moves go back to the message stay with the message don't deviate left and right stay with what brother branham gave i'm the calvinist it's a shame until somebody can move from one state to another or from one country to another and they have a hard time choosing a church because their favorite movies left from the country where they came from the state that they came they rather stay online and sending paths over there and breaking the law of brother branham which say you must have a local church roof on the company they got so caught up with the preacher we love the farfo ministry we will continue to bring them here you can enjoy a brother on youtube you can enjoy about it but stay with christ because if that brother deviate you can stick with the word and don't deviate not he deviate you deviate he's against the pastor you against the pastor he argue you are you he assault people you insult people you are under calvinistic he insult people you should have enough god to say that he is a good man but what he did there is wrong peter is a good man but peter what you're doing he's a hypocrite paul taught peter but peter was the one that started with jesus christ peter was the one that have the revelation peter was the one that walked on the water peter was the one that entered into the tomb but when peter is wrong paul have enough god to stand that peter this place you did wrong how can you be a brother and you're doing this in front of these hidden what example are you giving them but he didn't disfellowship peter he continued to love peter but he was no more under that anointing of men of following man because paul got one day in trouble and they pick him up and paul looked at the audience he said these are pharisees these are sadducees and paul came he said i'm a pharisee do you know what happened do you know what happened you know what happened when the guys understood that hey he believe adoption paul is no more bad they're taking part no paul didn't do anything wrong they would they were a gaspar until paul say i belongs to your clique you see what i'm saying as long as when you belongs to a click or your badge issue they wipe it now you become a good brother because you begin to belong to the clique roof under calvinist come out of it it is homegoing time [Music] get to the message the message is a living person the message is crushed meet jesus christ build your personal relationship with god and prepare yourself for the rapture all these moves all this thing will remain here brother branham said when we go to heaven we will have our badges here the blood of jesus christ displaying what your favorite preacher displaying what the message of the hour [Applause] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you father for your grace for your love and for your mercy father forgiven me grace to even reach this point lord somebody is touched somewhere and i know that this can go way way way beyond these four walls lord but father the purpose is to deliver the people because the time for going is at head there is no more time for move there is no more time to afford for big name of all or or building a platform for celebrity and things we heard so many stuff those that replaced brother branham those that took all kinds of stuff all over the world because they did they miss to understand the zeal of denomination that was coming up from the devil but further you say this message will never become a denomination the churches can be some people can be by the chosen elect like god when he please you in due time grace is coming to free your children completely until brother branham say that sometimes god can make a law a pastor to make a mistake to shake your faith away from the pastor so that the people all we can go back to christ which is our eternal security father may you help the people wherever they are if they're under a certain move or a certain tendency or a certain i don't know doctrine or whatever may they come out and return back in the middle of the road with the purity of the message of the hour and continue straight father because this message was sent to prepare your second coming lord i commit them unto the hand father may you bless them for the sacrifice of going over and letting me reach this point father we commit the rest of the weak unto the hand bless us and be with us lord as we humbly ask it and commit them and to travel mercy's father into your hand in jesus precious name amen god bless you church we love you [Music] [Music] amen we've had a message tonight amen we just take this song the first verse and then we can dismiss amen bless me that [Music] is [Music] i [Music] amen [Music] our fears [Music]
