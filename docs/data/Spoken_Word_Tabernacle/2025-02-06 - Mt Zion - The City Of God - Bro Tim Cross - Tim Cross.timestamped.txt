[41:34] worship together and feast around the
[41:38] table of the Lord amen so let's see what
[41:41] the Lord will do there but uh I want to
[41:43] invite you to turn in your Bibles to St
[41:45] John chapter
[41:47] 14 and um we want to take a few verses
[41:52] of scripture here and also in
[41:55] Revelations uh chapter 21 and we'll take
[41:57] a few verses there I was just returned
[42:02] um over the turn of the year I went to
[42:06] India for two weeks I've never been to
[42:09] the country of India before and um it
[42:12] was a a good visit a good trip the Lord
[42:15] blessed and we were there for about 10
[42:19] days and I don't know six or eight
[42:21] Services something like that but the
[42:23] very first service uh that I ministered
[42:26] uh um I at the end of the service made
[42:29] an offer if anyone would desire prayer
[42:32] they could come forward well everybody
[42:35] came all the sisters came and then all
[42:38] the brothers came and we were there with
[42:40] uh there were probably 10 or so
[42:42] ministers also and we just formed a line
[42:45] and everyone was prayed for and uh that
[42:48] was on Thursday January 2nd and about a
[42:52] week and a half later on Sunday was the
[42:54] final service and just before I came to
[42:57] the pulpit to minister a sister gave
[43:01] testimony that uh almost a year ago she
[43:04] had had a gallbladder removal had a
[43:06] surgery and had had complications after
[43:09] that surgery with eating digesting the
[43:11] food sleeping numerous things and um in
[43:16] she came through that prayer line that
[43:18] Thursday and God touched her all of that
[43:22] left her all of the symptoms and uh so
[43:29] amen God is still God he's on the throne
[43:34] and that's never going to change and
[43:36] he's still healing he's still saving
[43:38] he's still delivering and uh he he'll
[43:41] never have uh a closed side on his
[43:44] business amen he's he's always open his
[43:49] ear is always open to the Cry of his
[43:51] children and he loves to prove himself
[43:54] amen so we thank God that we know him in
[43:57] that way this evening and we are
[44:00] depending on him to come we can read
[44:02] these words but only he can reveal these
[44:05] words and take them from these pages and
[44:08] make them a reality in our lives so
[44:11] let's approach him in prayer just before
[44:13] we read his word this evening Lord Jesus
[44:16] it is truly a privilege and an honor to
[44:19] be gathered again and we realize Lord
[44:21] tonight there are many present and some
[44:24] Lord may be listening in watching in now
[44:26] or even later and we're just asking you
[44:29] Lord to come now and move in such a way
[44:32] our faith Lord would be lifted our
[44:34] doubts would dissolve and you would have
[44:37] such a preeminence Lord that they would
[44:39] see past the veil of a man or the voice
[44:44] of a man and Lord to hear you speaking
[44:46] and ministering to the needs of your
[44:49] children we ask you lord to bless the
[44:51] reading of your word and guide Lord what
[44:54] I would say or do that you may have the
[44:57] preeminence Lord and be glorified in it

[45:02] feed our hungry Souls we ask in Jesus
[45:05] name we pray amen amen amen Jesus says
[45:09] here in St John 14 it's often a funeral
[45:13] text but um we'll read here tonight let
[45:16] not your heart be troubled ye believe in
[45:20] God believe also in me in my father's
[45:25] house are many men ANS if it were not so
[45:29] I would have told you I go to prepare a
[45:34] place for you amen amen amen and if I go
[45:40] and prepare a place for you I will come
[45:44] again and receive you unto myself that
[45:48] where I am there ye may be also that's
[45:52] right and whether I go you know and the
[45:55] way you know yes also Revelation chap
[45:59] 21 we want to read uh verses 9 down
[46:04] through verse
[46:13] 11 I'm going to read it the way I want
[46:15] to read it then I'm going to read it the
[46:17] way King James interpreted it is that
[46:20] okay and there came unto me one of the
[46:23] Seven Angels which had preached the
[46:25] seven vows
[46:29] which had preached the future
[46:32] home which had preached the
[46:36] revelations contained within the seals
[46:38] amen there came unto me one of the Seven
[46:41] Angels which had the seven vows full of
[46:43] the last seven plagues and talked with
[46:46] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[46:49] the bride the Lamb's
[46:52] wife and he carried me away in the
[46:55] spirit to a grave
[46:57] and high mountain and showed me that
[47:00] great City the holy Jerusalem descending
[47:04] Out of Heaven yes sir from God may the
[47:09] Lord bless the reading of his word as
[47:10] you're seated tonight I want to title
[47:13] this Mount Zion the city of God Amen
[47:18] realizing that a city is a Dwelling
[47:21] Place a city is a habitation amen if I
[47:25] ask you tonight where you were from uh
[47:28] where is your home you would probably
[47:29] name the town the city the community
[47:33] where you reside where at the end of the
[47:36] day of work or the end of the vacation
[47:39] or the end of visit that's where you
[47:42] call home amen and so we I want to begin
[47:46] tonight by uh relaying or reminding you
[47:50] of something that happened in the Old
[47:52] Testament yes in the ministry of God's
[47:55] Prophet Moses yes God had raised up
[47:58] Moses Amen to be a Ministry of
[48:01] Deliverance that's right to bring the
[48:04] faith of the people of Israel uh to
[48:07] restore a faith amen and a promise of
[48:10] God that was given to them yes sir
[48:12] hundreds of years before God had told
[48:14] Abraham thy seed shall sojourn in a
[48:17] Strange Land and after 400 years I will
[48:19] deliver them out with the mighty hand so
[48:22] Moses Ministry amen was to lift the
[48:26] faith of of the people that's right to
[48:28] restore them to the understanding of who
[48:30] they were that they were not Egyptians
[48:33] they were not slaves and Egypt wasn't
[48:35] final and any of those things and so
[48:38] begin to call them out and I think it's
[48:39] so amazing that when God you know God
[48:42] first had to convince Moses he first had
[48:45] to get Moses to realize who he was after
[48:48] failing uh to be a leader and deliver
[48:51] and all those things so he takes Moses
[48:53] up and he meets him in a burning bush
[48:55] but um he said this shall be a sign unto
[48:58] you Moses when you have done this when
[49:00] I've performed this you're going to
[49:02] bring Israel up and they too yes sir
[49:05] will experience me they will worship me
[49:09] they will meet me yes sir in this same
[49:12] place now I'm paraphrasing how God gave
[49:15] Moses that instruction but I I can tell
[49:18] by your response I'm not telling you
[49:19] something you don't know so I I think
[49:22] that this is something because there
[49:23] were going to be many Supernatural signs
[49:27] that accompany this ministry right mean
[49:30] there would be the sign in the hand
[49:31] there would be the the the the see the
[49:34] hearts deser the the the pools and those
[49:36] signs that accompany that there would be
[49:38] plagues there would be the control over
[49:41] natural but but the Vindication yes the
[49:44] Vindication that God gave to Moses that
[49:47] would be the proof that his ministry was
[49:49] successful was that a people would come
[49:53] out of Egypt come out of that bondage
[49:55] come across the Red Sea and eventually
[49:58] come to know God the same way the
[50:01] prophet
[50:02] [Music]
[50:03] did that's the real
[50:07] proof and you see all those signs and
[50:09] wonders never made Believers out of
[50:12] Egyptians amen those those signs came
[50:14] they were displayed Pharaoh died all the
[50:17] Egyptians perished the armies perished
[50:20] amen but God brought a
[50:21] Joshua God brought a Caleb amen God
[50:25] brought individual
[50:27] Amen to meet the god of the prophet and
[50:31] that was the proof that was the real
[50:33] proof so the same is true today we can
[50:36] look at the things God did some uh
[50:40] decades ago 50 60 years ago and they're
[50:43] all true Everything God did through
[50:45] William bram's Ministry is true it it
[50:48] will stand the test of time amen but
[50:51] those things really aren't the proof a
[50:53] picture on the wall isn't the proof am
[50:55] me a testimony isn't the proof am me
[50:58] something in the Library of Congress
[51:00] isn't the proof the Vindication is your
[51:03] life having met God in the same way amen
[51:08] that's the proof amen so along this
[51:11] journey God one day calls Moses up into
[51:15] the mountain and there's a pattern that
[51:18] God is establishing here that he's going
[51:20] to use for the rest of time and he calls
[51:23] Moses up and Moses is CAU up into the
[51:25] cloud amen he he's he's he's up there
[51:28] and the and the congregation doesn't
[51:30] really understand what's taking place
[51:33] but while he is there God is showing him
[51:35] a vision and God is showing him a
[51:38] tabernacle amen and the the outer Court
[51:41] the inner Court the holiest of holies
[51:43] and all of those things and and God is
[51:44] showing them a very elaborate Temple and
[51:47] curtains and and and Furniture in the
[51:49] Tabernacle gold silver brass fine linen
[51:53] all of these things and God is showing
[51:54] Moses this great pattern and then God's
[51:57] telling Moses Moses I want
[52:01] this I'm I'm not even happy I'm not even
[52:05] satisfied with this in the Heavenly
[52:08] realm I want this to become a
[52:11] reality down there on the
[52:14] earth and I'm just trying to imagine
[52:17] what might have gone through moses' mind
[52:19] when he begins to see this you know I
[52:21] know if it were me I'd be saying God I
[52:23] can't do that I can't build that
[52:27] and you can tell me the dimensions and
[52:29] you can tell me the material you can
[52:31] give me all the specifics but I'm not a
[52:34] builder I'm not a carpenter I don't know
[52:36] how to work with gold and brass and
[52:38] silver and all those things I I I I'm
[52:40] it's beyond my ability Amen to do all of
[52:43] those things but see this is what I love
[52:47] about it God was using the ministry of a
[52:51] prophet to be a link Amen to relay what
[52:56] was in the mind of God and to bring it
[52:59] from a supernatural sphere or a Heavenly
[53:03] Place Amen to bring the
[53:07] message to bring the message of the
[53:09] pattern Amen to give them the the the
[53:12] the dimensions the layout to tell them
[53:15] the
[53:16] vision and God knew amen through that
[53:21] prophet's Ministry when he begins to
[53:24] express what he's experienced up there
[53:27] on that mountain there's going to be
[53:29] people within the congregation of Israel
[53:33] amen that are going to have
[53:37] faith that are going to
[53:39] recognize and they're not just going to
[53:42] agree with it no sir they're not just
[53:44] going to say well Moses I'm I'm really I
[53:47] really do believe that happened to you I
[53:50] really believe that in all that time you
[53:52] were gone from us God really did those
[53:54] things and my Moses what a what what a
[53:56] blueprint what a draw it's beautiful man
[54:00] I just can't wait you know no there were
[54:04] people there yes that as soon as they
[54:07] heard this
[54:09] message it quickened
[54:11] them it activated them it put them in
[54:15] the motion and and the thing the thing I
[54:17] love about this is these people had just
[54:19] come out of the greatest nation in the
[54:21] world at that
[54:24] time had I mean all the riches of the
[54:27] world gold silver brass these people as
[54:32] slaves were building treasur cities to
[54:35] Pharaoh
[54:36] right but under Egyptian rule sir and
[54:41] under Egyptian Dominion they could
[54:43] barely stomp out good mud
[54:46] bricks that was the limitation of their
[54:48] skill that was a limitation of their
[54:50] ability with all of those resources amen
[54:53] there of mud brick was all they could
[54:56] pred
[54:57] day after day after day in a in a land
[55:00] with everything at their fingertips so
[55:02] God takes that same people across the
[55:05] Red Sea Under This failure of a
[55:08] deliverer you know as far as Egypt was
[55:10] concerned and they get out in a baren
[55:12] desert Wilderness where there's
[55:14] nothing I mean the only thing that was
[55:16] there was what they might have carried
[55:18] with them or what God was providing and
[55:21] there Moses comes down from the mountain
[55:24] with this
[55:25] pattern and and those people with
[55:29] nothing began to build what was in God's
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:38] mind I love this Exodus 311 and the Lord
[55:42] spake un to Moses saying this might have
[55:44] been his answer to Moses question Lord
[55:47] this is wonderful but how is this going
[55:50] to be I didn't study carpentry I studied
[55:54] how to lead a military I studied math
[55:57] and I studied uh uh how do I say it um
[56:01] you know H how to send a a a a a missile
[56:05] to the
[56:06] Moon I didn't study how to build sacred
[56:10] Furniture amen you see friends there
[56:13] comes a time when the message is not
[56:16] just about the
[56:19] messenger the message isn't even about
[56:22] the figures or the people God used but
[56:25] the message is a
[56:26] Ministry because God is Desiring to do
[56:30] something in the
[56:31] earth to reestablish amen what was um
[56:35] what was
[56:36] sidetracked in his first
[56:39] Eden God is going to establish his Eden
[56:43] his kingdom right here in the
[56:46] earth and the Lord spake unto Moses
[56:48] saying see I have called by name bezel
[56:52] the son of Uriah the son of her of the
[56:54] tribe of Judah that's right and I have
[56:57] filled
[56:58] him with the spirit of
[57:01] God in wisdom and in understanding and
[57:05] in knowledge and in all manner of
[57:09] workmanship to devise cunning Works to
[57:12] work in gold and in silver and in brass
[57:15] and in cutting of stones to set them and
[57:17] in carving of Timber to work in all
[57:20] manner of workmanship yes and behold I
[57:22] have given with him a holy of the son of
[57:24] ahmic of the tri of De in the and in the
[57:27] hearts of all that are wise-hearted
[57:34] I sir see the message is
[57:39] predestinated and the Believers of the
[57:42] message are
[57:45] predestinated these people were probably
[57:47] 30 40 50 60 old years
[57:50] old but they had been
[57:52] dormant until the message
[57:57] they had been under denominational rule
[58:00] they had been under control they had
[58:02] been in bondage amen and and and and and
[58:05] the world just looked at them as second
[58:07] class
[58:08] citizens less than people less than
[58:11] humans but now the mind of God the will
[58:15] of God the desire of God is being
[58:18] realized amen and those same people that
[58:21] the world deemed to be
[58:23] failures you see the message message
[58:26] will not fall on deaf
[58:30] ears but the message is not for
[58:34] unbelievers it's for a targeted
[58:40] group you're a targeted group you're
[58:43] you're an elect
[58:46] lady he that hath an ear to hear Let Him
[58:51] hear what the spirit saith to the
[58:54] churches
[58:56] and see the hearing of it is not just
[58:59] the sound of it falling on your ears but
[59:01] it's actually the motion the dynamic
[59:05] amen the the action of your
[59:09] life gives witness to the
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:14] message they became the
[59:18] message the Tabernacle was not a drawing
[59:21] was not a one-dimensional picture the
[59:24] Tabernacle was a place
[59:26] a tangible place for God to come and
[59:30] dwell his place of habitation and that
[59:34] Tabernacle was going to be built and
[59:37] constructed by
[59:39] people by men and by women collaborating
[59:43] together that's why the message lives
[59:46] today is because it's not books it's not
[59:50] tapes it's not Memories it's not a man
[59:55] but it is act actually the mind of God
[59:58] which is eternal which is Invincible
[1:00:02] which is
[1:00:03] infallible that mind is being expressed
[1:00:06] and as those thoughts amen are spoken
[1:00:09] there's an answer there's an echo from
[1:00:15] people
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:20] amen so Moses simply shared the
[1:00:24] vision and he didn't have to whip
[1:00:27] anybody he didn't have to beg anybody he
[1:00:31] didn't have to pay
[1:00:32] anybody he didn't have to coers anybody
[1:00:36] he just preached the
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:43] message and I believe brother shimbo as
[1:00:45] he began to describe the
[1:00:48] dimensions you know if there was an
[1:00:51] unbeliever there i' say well that
[1:00:53] sounds that sounds pretty legalistic
[1:00:58] you mean it's got to be so tall it's got
[1:01:00] to be so wide it's got to be so long
[1:01:03] what gives him the right to tell us that
[1:01:07] who does he think he is anyway he ain't
[1:01:10] a carpenter he's not an architect he's
[1:01:13] not an engineer see that's how
[1:01:16] unbelief
[1:01:18] reacts but at the same time someone
[1:01:21] sitting on the seat right next to them
[1:01:24] began seeing the vision
[1:01:28] and actually saw in Greater detail
[1:01:31] perhaps than even what was being laid
[1:01:34] out by the prophet he know what said I
[1:01:37] can do that I've been waiting to hear
[1:01:40] that all my
[1:01:41] life I've been longing for an outlet you
[1:01:45] see the predestinated message is coming
[1:01:48] to a predestinated people and to them
[1:01:51] it's not works it's not lab laborious
[1:01:54] it's not a problem it's not a burden
[1:01:57] it's not rules it's not regulations they
[1:02:00] said I can do
[1:02:01] that I can I know I know exactly what
[1:02:05] that labor is going to look
[1:02:07] like you know what I'm going to build
[1:02:10] that labor I'm going to form it what do
[1:02:14] you mean you're going to form you never
[1:02:15] work with brass in your life but the
[1:02:17] ability the potential has been lying
[1:02:20] there all along and when I heard this
[1:02:23] message I heard my IDE identity I heard
[1:02:27] who I was all along amen and it
[1:02:32] released it released it's not
[1:02:36] bondage it's a liberty to
[1:02:39] release the potential that God had in
[1:02:42] you all along
[1:02:49] amen if you want to talk about bondage
[1:02:52] bondage is anything else
[1:02:56] bondage is anything less I found
[1:03:00] Freedom what you calling bondage amen
[1:03:03] what you what the world costs freedom to
[1:03:05] me is bondage amen I have found freedom
[1:03:10] I have found what
[1:03:12] unlocked was lying there the entire
[1:03:15] time
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:20] [Applause]
[1:03:22] amen and then there's nonbeliever
[1:03:24] sitting there say well if it happens all
[1:03:26] the prophet's going to have to do
[1:03:28] it the only way I'm going to worship at
[1:03:31] a brass altar is if I know the prophet
[1:03:34] did
[1:03:34] it and the prop it is the exact same
[1:03:38] Spirit it cannot enter in because
[1:03:42] there's nothing within that person to be
[1:03:47] the am
[1:03:49] man to be the Fulfillment and so they're
[1:03:52] putting it off that's right on someone
[1:03:55] else
[1:03:56] and say well if he can do it or she can
[1:03:58] do it or if if if the prophet will just
[1:04:00] come back and rise and and all the other
[1:04:04] thing you know I if my threshold of
[1:04:07] unbelief can be friend you're never
[1:04:09] going to
[1:04:10] believe if what God has done by now
[1:04:12] doesn't make you a Believer he can do
[1:04:15] nothing more to make you a Believer
[1:04:18] right amen I've said it before and it's
[1:04:22] crude but if you were waiting on
[1:04:23] raindrops to hit you in the face
[1:04:26] to vindicate that Noah's message was
[1:04:28] thus sayith the Lord you were waiting
[1:04:30] too late you had to believe it came from
[1:04:33] God get into the ark and be sealed in 8
[1:04:37] Days Later the rain
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:41] fell
[1:04:43] amen praise the Lord prise that's the
[1:04:47] difference between belief and
[1:04:50] unbelief so God give God gave the vision
[1:04:53] to the prophet yes sir but just just it
[1:04:56] involved a people that's right it
[1:04:58] involved a
[1:05:00] mountain it involved a
[1:05:03] cloud it involved a prophet and it
[1:05:05] involved a promise all of those elements
[1:05:09] were in that
[1:05:10] amen oh my now I'm
[1:05:18] lost praise the Lord
[1:05:21] hallu may the Lord help us
[1:05:27] glory to
[1:05:29] God hallelujah a habitation a dwelling
[1:05:33] place for God's glory to be expressed in
[1:05:37] the
[1:05:37] Earth this this happened
[1:05:42] again one day Jesus calls Peter James
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:47] John a
[1:05:49] prophet up on the
[1:05:52] mountain with witnesses there believers
[1:05:55] and Jesus was
[1:05:58] transfigured he was glorified before
[1:06:01] them amen Days Later he's praying and he
[1:06:05] says
[1:06:06] father glorify thy
[1:06:09] name St John 12 and there came a voice
[1:06:12] from Heaven saying I have both glorified
[1:06:15] it past tense and will glorify it
[1:06:20] again the people that stood by heard it
[1:06:22] said that it thundered and others said
[1:06:24] an angel spake to him and Jesus answered
[1:06:26] and said this voice came not because of
[1:06:30] me but for your
[1:06:34] sakes a pattern was being shown to Peter
[1:06:39] James and
[1:06:40] John and only days later after his
[1:06:44] Ascension they gathered in the upper
[1:06:47] room in obedience to his
[1:06:52] commandment Jesus told them Terry ye in
[1:06:56] Jerusalem the
[1:06:59] city until you be endued with power from
[1:07:02] on high these men had cast out Devils
[1:07:06] they had healed the sick they had
[1:07:08] manifested a Supernatural Ministry of
[1:07:11] Jesus
[1:07:16] Christ but but they weren't
[1:07:19] satisfied working off of a borrowed
[1:07:21] anointing
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:27] they could not effectively continue and
[1:07:31] actually the potential that was already
[1:07:33] in them that was recognized by hearing
[1:07:37] Jesus
[1:07:39] voice that was still a potential that's
[1:07:42] right but the potential took them to the
[1:07:45] upper room and on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:48] The Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:07:52] came back into those 120 Believers
[1:07:55] gathered there in the upper room and
[1:07:57] that became the habitation or the
[1:08:01] Tabernacle or the glory of God Amen
[1:08:05] manifested now not in one son but in a
[1:08:09] many membered body born in sin shaped in
[1:08:13] iniquity but now having experienced a
[1:08:16] new birth amen then they began to go
[1:08:20] forth expressing Jesus
[1:08:23] Christ amen so many things I could say
[1:08:27] there but amen God revealing his
[1:08:35] glory
[1:08:36] amen Daniel chapter
[1:08:44] 2 Daniel 2 beginning at verse
[1:08:53] 34 I'll just start at verse vers 31 thou
[1:08:56] O King now Daniel is giving the king the
[1:08:59] interpretation of his dream thou oh King
[1:09:01] sawest and behold a great
[1:09:05] image this great image whose brightness
[1:09:08] was excellent stood before thee and the
[1:09:10] form thereof was terrible the image's
[1:09:13] head was of fine gold his breast and his
[1:09:16] arms of silver his belly and his thighs
[1:09:19] of brass his legs of iron his feet part
[1:09:23] of iron and part of clay
[1:09:25] oh my thou
[1:09:29] sawest till that a
[1:09:31] stone was cut out without
[1:09:37] hands Jesus told
[1:09:41] Peter blessed art thou Simon barod for
[1:09:44] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:09:46] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:09:50] heaven that's right and I say unto thee
[1:09:52] that thou art Peter right and Upon This
[1:09:57] Rock right huh right Upon This Rock
[1:10:02] I will build my church that's right
[1:10:08] whose church is
[1:10:09] it Jesus Christ has a
[1:10:13] church who is the Builder of
[1:10:16] itus Jesus
[1:10:19] Christ who is the church Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] upon this
[1:10:25] Rock I will build my church the prophet
[1:10:31] of God teaches us The Rock was not Peter
[1:10:34] a man so unstable that only days later
[1:10:37] he denied Jesus and cursed while doing
[1:10:39] it more surprisingly he says the church
[1:10:42] wasn't built on
[1:10:45] Jesus it wasn't built on a
[1:10:49] man who lived 2,000 years ago the church
[1:10:54] is B built or founded upon the
[1:11:00] revelation of who Jesus
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:08] is that's how the church is
[1:11:12] built so Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ you know building the English
[1:11:18] word building is a
[1:11:21] noun because a building is a place right
[1:11:25] in the building
[1:11:26] tonight but it's also a
[1:11:29] verb building is an
[1:11:33] action Jesus was building a
[1:11:38] building and he said I'm going to build
[1:11:40] it it's going to be mine and everything
[1:11:44] about it is going to be mine it's going
[1:11:46] to be me I'm going to build it my church
[1:11:51] and the Gates of Hell shall not pre
[1:11:55] Prevail against
[1:11:58] it so what's Jesus saying is this church
[1:12:02] is going to possess the same qualities I
[1:12:05] possess it's going to be
[1:12:09] myself built it's going to be my
[1:12:14] habitation you shall only worship at the
[1:12:19] place where the Lord will put his name
[1:12:26] that's the only place true worship can
[1:12:29] be
[1:12:31] experienced but it's not a building you
[1:12:33] enter and leave it's a building you
[1:12:38] become that's why you take the lord's
[1:12:40] name in water baptism you're taking on
[1:12:44] the name of Jesus Christ the
[1:12:46] identification of Jesus Christ and he
[1:12:49] will meet the
[1:12:51] worshipper right there not just to give
[1:12:55] you a revelation of who he is but to
[1:12:57] make
[1:12:59] you to build you the
[1:13:03] individual into a stature of a perfect
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:11] [Applause]
[1:13:14] man thou sawest till a stone was cut out
[1:13:19] without hands without human intervention
[1:13:23] without tampering of man
[1:13:25] without hands which smoke the
[1:13:29] image what Satan was trying to build
[1:13:34] what men were trying to build what
[1:13:36] Gentile kingdoms were trying to build
[1:13:39] when the stone smote it it
[1:13:45] destroyed it destroyed the goals the
[1:13:49] objectives the dreams the Visions the
[1:13:52] Ambitions and the aspirations
[1:14:02] friend this ain't something Daniel saw
[1:14:05] thousands of years ago this ain't even
[1:14:07] something that's off in the past
[1:14:09] necessarily this is your
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:14] conversion
[1:14:16] Peter Satan had desired to have
[1:14:20] you that he may sift you as weak Satan
[1:14:24] had a desire for your life he had a goal
[1:14:27] for your life he was trying to build you
[1:14:29] into something or he was trying to make
[1:14:31] you a slave like Israel was in Egypt to
[1:14:35] build treasure cities for
[1:14:37] himself and it was all going pretty good
[1:14:41] until a stone that was cut out of the
[1:14:44] mountain without hands struck what the
[1:14:48] enemy was trying to
[1:14:50] build whatever you were before your
[1:14:53] conversion is what Satan was trying to
[1:14:56] make out of your life but a stone
[1:15:00] intervened the revelation of who Jesus
[1:15:04] Christ is
[1:15:06] interrupted Satan's
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] program
[1:15:11] Hallelujah thou sawest till a stone was
[1:15:15] cut out without hands which smoke the
[1:15:18] image upon his feet that were of iron of
[1:15:20] clay and break them to Pieces then was
[1:15:24] the iron the clay the brass the silver
[1:15:26] and the gold broken into pieces together
[1:15:28] and became like the
[1:15:29] chaff of the summer threshing floors and
[1:15:32] the wind carried them away that no place
[1:15:36] was found for
[1:15:37] them and the stone that smoke the
[1:15:42] image became a great
[1:15:47] Mountain that
[1:15:49] fied the Earth
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:15:55] amen when it fills the earth when it
[1:15:59] fills the Earth there's no room for
[1:16:01] anything
[1:16:02] else there's no room for any other ideas
[1:16:05] any other Ambitions any other desires no
[1:16:08] room for
[1:16:09] opinion no room for I thought or I
[1:16:12] dreamed or I hoped or I no that's all
[1:16:15] dissolved the stone became a great
[1:16:19] Mountain that filled the entire
[1:16:22] Earth amen
[1:16:25] praise the
[1:16:31] Lord see Ephesians 1 verse1
[1:16:42] 17 thank you lordu Ephesians 1 verse
[1:16:47] 17 oh
[1:16:49] my this ties with the scripture we read
[1:16:52] in Exodus 31 yes sir
[1:16:56] he go he he begins in verse 15 he says
[1:16:59] wherefore I also after I heard of your
[1:17:02] faith in the Lord Jesus and that's
[1:17:07] accompanied by
[1:17:09] love unto all the saints that's right so
[1:17:12] if you got faith now I've been preaching
[1:17:16] on when the son of man returns shall he
[1:17:20] find faith on the earth and what you
[1:17:23] realize is it's like the um the armor
[1:17:27] man's son that went West to find a wife
[1:17:31] remember he went out there he thought I
[1:17:33] can't find this character in Chicago so
[1:17:35] I'll go out west he got out west and it
[1:17:37] wasn't there either but he goes out on
[1:17:39] the back porch to take a break and there
[1:17:41] he sees the little cousin little wash
[1:17:44] girl and and and and he says do you know
[1:17:46] why I'm here do you know why I've come
[1:17:49] I'm here looking for a wife and I see in
[1:17:52] you what what I was hoping I'd find find
[1:17:55] in there but I think I found it and will
[1:17:58] you marry me and she accepted the
[1:18:01] proposal and when she accepted he said
[1:18:03] one year from today I'm coming
[1:18:07] back and I'm going to take you to a
[1:18:11] place Jesus said I go to prepare for you
[1:18:16] a
[1:18:17] place sir so he left he probably walked
[1:18:21] off that back porch right back into the
[1:18:23] ballroom did some more d dancing or
[1:18:25] eating and fellowshipping and then the
[1:18:27] next morning he was gone and all those
[1:18:30] other girls went right back to their old
[1:18:33] way of life that's exactly right they
[1:18:37] all received a
[1:18:41] visitation the newspapers
[1:18:43] [Applause]
[1:18:45] testified the world gave
[1:18:48] witness they had received a visitation
[1:18:52] all right but when the the when when the
[1:18:56] U when the ministry was taken from the
[1:18:59] scene when the figure had when the
[1:19:01] character when he
[1:19:03] leaves they all go
[1:19:08] back yes to the mother to what they had
[1:19:12] been and done
[1:19:14] before but there was one little
[1:19:17] girl who in that
[1:19:20] visitation did not
[1:19:22] dance did not have fancy
[1:19:25] clothes did not have any of those
[1:19:28] special
[1:19:29] privileges but she received
[1:19:32] something she didn't just receive a
[1:19:35] visitation she received a
[1:19:38] promise she heard the
[1:19:41] message the message resonated the
[1:19:45] message came to her as an individual and
[1:19:48] said get
[1:19:50] ready I am coming back for you
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:58] amen and she gave witness to the
[1:20:02] visitation by a change of
[1:20:07] behavior she kept washing dishes she
[1:20:10] kept scrubbing floors but she also began
[1:20:15] sewing she began taking material and
[1:20:19] preparing a wedding garment and a
[1:20:21] treasure chest to be taken with her when
[1:20:25] she left on the day he would
[1:20:28] return that was the
[1:20:31] difference she didn't just get a
[1:20:34] visitation she didn't just get a nice
[1:20:36] Supernatural experience she got the
[1:20:40] message when the son of man returns
[1:20:44] shall he find Faith the only Faith he
[1:20:47] will find and the only Faith he is
[1:20:50] searching for is the faith that he
[1:20:53] left in his first visit he found faith
[1:20:58] and he said I'm coming back for that
[1:21:01] faith and that Faith put her in
[1:21:05] preparation for his return not to stay
[1:21:09] there but to leave
[1:21:12] there
[1:21:16] hallelujah amen that's what he's coming
[1:21:19] back for he's coming back for the faith
[1:21:22] that he left
[1:21:26] amen with after I heard of your faith in
[1:21:28] the Lord Jesus and love unto all the
[1:21:31] saints SE not to give thanks for you

[1:26:49] form he changed his form that's same God
[1:26:54] same power same characteristics same
[1:26:57] attributes no different changed his
[1:27:02] form oh my praise the
[1:27:06] Lord in another message here
[1:27:09] um well it's yeah it's still in the
[1:27:13] church ages but in the it is in the
[1:27:16] midst of a time of great trouble that
[1:27:20] Jesus
[1:27:22] comes and with his coming there is a
[1:27:25] resurrection yes many are to come forth
[1:27:27] Out of the Dust and rise with those who
[1:27:30] are alive but waiting for his return and
[1:27:34] these will be given crowns why because
[1:27:37] they are sons of God they are Kings with
[1:27:41] him they are reigning with him that is
[1:27:44] what the crown signifies reigning and
[1:27:46] ruling with the great king himself that
[1:27:49] is the promise to all those who suffer
[1:27:52] with him here on Earth
[1:27:55] all those who patiently endured knowing
[1:27:58] that God the just judge would reward
[1:28:00] them they who gave up all for him and
[1:28:03] committed all to him will sit down in
[1:28:06] his throne and share in his glorious
[1:28:08] Kingdom amen oh we have a word for us
[1:28:11] all at this time it is it is hold
[1:28:16] fast
[1:28:17] persevere don't give up put on the whole
[1:28:21] armor of God you use every weapon he has
[1:28:27] given
[1:28:28] us use every gift at our disposal and
[1:28:32] look ahead with joy because we are going
[1:28:36] to be crowned by him who is king of
[1:28:38] kings and Lord of
[1:28:41] lords I'm jumping back into my other
[1:28:43] message scoffield takes that scripture
[1:28:47] when the son of man returns shall he
[1:28:48] find faith on the earth and he said this
[1:28:51] faith is not speaking of individual
[1:28:55] Faith but it's faith in the whole w l e
[1:29:00] the whole
[1:29:02] body of revealed
[1:29:05] truth now that wasn't even possible
[1:29:08] until this
[1:29:10] age because there were Mysteries
[1:29:13] contained within the seals not yet
[1:29:16] revealed so the son of man is looking
[1:29:19] for mature
[1:29:20] faith in a complete word right he's
[1:29:25] building a
[1:29:27] building he's building
[1:29:30] himself he is the building and he's the
[1:29:33] one building it but he's building it in
[1:29:34] a church and through each age and
[1:29:38] through each stage there is a partial
[1:29:41] completion waiting for the final age or
[1:29:44] the final stage at which point even the
[1:29:47] Loose Ends or what was still contained
[1:29:50] in a mystery form would be revealed amen
[1:29:54] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:29:57] angel when he shall begin to
[1:30:01] sound the mystery of
[1:30:06] who who was the mystery of God
[1:30:09] revealed Christ who is the mystery of
[1:30:12] Christ revealed the bride in the days of
[1:30:16] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:30:19] shall begin to
[1:30:21] sound speaking God's thoughts from a
[1:30:24] Mountaintop experience the mystery of
[1:30:28] God should be
[1:30:30] finished made complete made whole when
[1:30:34] the son of man returned shall he find
[1:30:36] faith faith in the whole body of
[1:30:39] revealed truth a church that doesn't
[1:30:41] just believe or accept it on a mental
[1:30:45] level but a church that like a holab and
[1:30:48] like Bez are actually becoming the
[1:30:52] manifestation
[1:30:54] of the
[1:30:55] message now if Luther preached a message
[1:30:59] of justification It produced Justified
[1:31:03] lives Wesley preached sanctification It
[1:31:06] produced Sanctified lives in Pentecost
[1:31:10] It produced the outpouring of the Holy
[1:31:13] Spirit and the restoration of the gifts
[1:31:16] what will the Rapture message
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] produce it will activate it will Quicken
[1:31:25] a faith that was lying dormant waiting
[1:31:29] for the
[1:31:31] vision waiting for the message but when
[1:31:34] the message is sounded you catch the
[1:31:38] vision of what was in the mind of God
[1:31:41] and you are
[1:31:44] transformed Hallelujah when you
[1:31:47] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[1:31:50] food and you left that other thing you
[1:31:53] heard
[1:31:54] from your
[1:31:56] theophany and you have been
[1:31:59] changed into the
[1:32:02] living Living Image it's not a blueprint
[1:32:07] it's not a pattern on the wall it
[1:32:09] becomes a tabernacle a dwelling place
[1:32:13] for Jehovah God himself you've been
[1:32:16] changed into the living image of the
[1:32:18] Living God you
[1:32:20] heard you heard from your
[1:32:25] theophany
[1:32:29] hallelujah
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:34] hallelujah can I
[1:32:36] continue now he is not only giving
[1:32:39] crowns but he says that these in his
[1:32:42] bride will be made
[1:32:46] pillars yes sir
[1:32:48] pillars in the temple of
[1:32:51] God you can't have a roof without
[1:32:54] pillars you can't have a ceiling without
[1:32:57] pillars pillars are integral members of
[1:32:59] the structure that are tying the
[1:33:02] building
[1:33:04] together these and the bride will be
[1:33:06] made
[1:33:07] pillars in the temple of
[1:33:10] God but what is the temple of
[1:33:13] God Jesus spoke of his body as being the
[1:33:16] temple it was it was the temple of God
[1:33:19] but now that we are his body the true
[1:33:23] church church is the temple of God by
[1:33:26] the Holy Ghost within us right he is
[1:33:29] going to make the
[1:33:31] Overcomer a pillar in that Temple I like
[1:33:35] to say this he's going to make the
[1:33:36] pillar an
[1:33:38] overcomer because you are a pillar he's
[1:33:40] going to make you an
[1:33:43] overcomer the Overcomer will be made
[1:33:46] into a
[1:33:47] pillar what is a pillar a pillar is
[1:33:50] actually a part that's of the foundation
[1:33:53] that's right for it holds up the super
[1:33:55] structure praise God that puts the
[1:33:57] believer right in with the apostles and
[1:34:00] Prophets where it says in Ephesians 2:19
[1:34:03] therefore ye are no more strangers and
[1:34:04] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:34:07] Saints and of the household of God and
[1:34:09] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:34:11] Apostles and Prophets wait a minute New
[1:34:14] Testament Pro what
[1:34:16] yes you are built upon the
[1:34:19] foundation and he said you become one
[1:34:22] with the foundation
[1:34:24] brother bam said this book is for a
[1:34:26] prophetic
[1:34:27] class of
[1:34:29] people so of course you believe in a
[1:34:31] prophetic
[1:34:32] Ministry you have a prophetic Ministry
[1:34:35] you have the ministry of carrying out
[1:34:38] the
[1:34:39] prophecy you have the ministry of
[1:34:41] becoming the Fulfillment the
[1:34:44] prophecy
[1:34:47] amen Jesus Christ you're built upon the
[1:34:49] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:34:51] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:34:53] Cornerstone
[1:34:54] in
[1:34:55] whom in whom all the body building fitly
[1:34:58] framed together groweth up groweth unto
[1:35:00] an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom also
[1:35:03] ye are build together for in habitation
[1:35:05] of God through the spirit yes that verse
[1:35:08] 22 says that we are builded together
[1:35:10] with them everything went through the
[1:35:12] door Jesus and is a part of that body or
[1:35:15] Temple now when God puts a man in the
[1:35:17] temple as a pillar and makes him a part
[1:35:19] of the foundation group what is he
[1:35:22] doing what is is he doing he is giving
[1:35:26] him the revelation of the word and of
[1:35:29] himself because that is exactly what the
[1:35:33] apostles and Prophets had that's right
[1:35:35] Matthew 16:17 there he is in that word
[1:35:39] there he
[1:35:41] stands no one can get him out that's
[1:35:46] it you become
[1:35:50] Inseparable I am told that the Great
[1:35:52] Pyramid is actually made up of thousands
[1:35:55] upon thousands of
[1:35:58] little
[1:35:59] stones that are pyramid
[1:36:03] shaped those little pyramids are formed
[1:36:08] together to make a Great Pyramid but
[1:36:11] they are all miniature pyramids in and
[1:36:13] of
[1:36:14] themselves isn't that
[1:36:17] something all right Hallelujah so
[1:36:21] brother shimoken
[1:36:23] labor more on this but if you go
[1:36:28] 1962 December brother Brandon preaches a
[1:36:31] message is this the sign of the
[1:36:35] inser he references five or six
[1:36:39] dreams or visions that people other than
[1:36:42] himself had brother Junior Jackson was
[1:36:45] one sister shephard I believe was
[1:36:47] another all of these dreams are dealing
[1:36:51] with brother bradam going west and in
[1:36:53] brother Jackson's dream they were
[1:36:55] standing up at a hill yes my brother and
[1:36:58] there was writing inside that no man
[1:37:01] could interpret that's exactly like and
[1:37:02] he said brother Bram use something like
[1:37:04] a pry bar yes sir and he pried the top
[1:37:07] of it off it was like it came open the
[1:37:09] top of that mountain came open and there
[1:37:11] were things written there that the sun
[1:37:14] had never
[1:37:15] struck light had never Struck it
[1:37:18] before and to get it was unknown it was
[1:37:21] it was in a it was no one knew what it
[1:37:24] was saying not even brother Brenham but
[1:37:26] the vision carried him
[1:37:28] West and brother Brenham had associate
[1:37:31] ministers there in the dream there were
[1:37:33] Associates with him and brother benam
[1:37:35] instructed them stay here that's right
[1:37:38] and look on this that's right stay right
[1:37:40] here well some did not they
[1:37:43] wondered they strayed but some stayed
[1:37:47] and looked on and then brother brandham
[1:37:49] after going out west he returned with
[1:37:52] the revelation
[1:37:55] with the interpretation of what was
[1:37:58] mysteriously written inside that and in
[1:38:01] the message
[1:38:03] um in the message let me find it
