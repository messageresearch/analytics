[21:45] almost had a car wreck
[21:59] every morning before we leave the house
[22:01] we always pray but this morning we were
[22:04] late so we did not pray this morning

[22:28] that
[22:28] on the on the screen you know how that
[22:31] um
[22:32] that knife the tower light comes on it
[22:34] was on
[22:35] a sun community
[22:58] the calmness that my son had uh
[23:01] in times like this i was screamed but i
[23:04] didn't scream
[23:05] there was such a presence in the vehicle
[23:07] that he pulled us to the side
[23:15] that's the reason why i want to glorify
[23:16] you i don't know what would have
[23:18] happened but thank
[23:19] be to god

[23:51] um i have a testament money too um
[23:54] [Music]
[23:57] which night was it i was up praying
[24:01] and while i was praying i was
[24:04] struggling um for a breakthrough i mean
[24:08] i'm praying i'm falling asleep i get up
[24:10] and wash my face
[24:12] i go back and i took my book and i
[24:15] started to read the word i read judith
[24:17] brown of me and
[24:18] you know just to find out it was the
[24:20] same time my son was heading home
[24:24] and he was just trying to be a friend to
[24:27] a friend going through trial and tired
[24:29] coming home
[24:31] and as he made the turn past the exit
[24:35] he run off and hit the tree
[24:39] and um anyway to god be the glory he
[24:42] pulled himself off the car he heard the
[24:44] crackling and
[24:44] here he pulled himself out the police
[24:48] came and pulled him away from it
[24:50] so thank god for saving his life the car
[24:53] burned to char
[24:54] but he is well and today he's in the
[24:58] hospital
[24:59] um he has many
[25:02] surgeries but right now
[25:05] he was able to move from the bed to the
[25:07] wheelchair
[25:09] so he'll be going home and i just want
[25:11] to give
[25:12] god all the praise
[25:15] and the glory for keeping him the
[25:18] enemy's been after him
[25:20] and this is not his first accident he
[25:22] flipped him about
[25:23] maybe listed about three times now
[25:26] he's been going after him but i gotta
[25:28] give this there was a time when he was a
[25:30] kid that i prayed for him
[25:32] i was giving trouble in school in my
[25:34] eyes
[25:35] and i prayed and i saw god put a cage
[25:38] around that child
[25:39] so i know it came back and i know that
[25:43] god is reaching out to him
[25:46] he's giving him a second chance and he
[25:49] must give his life to christ
[25:53] and i'm just letting god have his way
[25:56] and give him the glory and thanks
[25:58] amen
[26:03] amen hallelujah god is good
[26:11] he hears the prayers of a mother right
[26:14] amen
[26:16] anybody else with the praise report and
[26:17] then we'll move on and see if anybody
[26:19] has a prayer request
[26:20] we'll keep him on his jermaine right
[26:22] keep him on our prayer list i'm sure we
[26:24] all have
[26:25] children and family members that we
[26:27] would like to see come to christ as well
[26:29] without being jerked through a knothole
[26:32] you know
[26:33] but we want god's will if he does if he
[26:35] has to do that
[26:37] you know sometimes those knotholes make
[26:39] a bigger impression than just coming in
[26:41] you know we got jerked through a couple
[26:45] anybody have a prayer request yes ma'am

[32:09] last night we were on a prayer zoom call
[32:12] for my brother where he got to see his
[32:13] brothers and sisters and families
[32:15] aunties
[32:16] so many people there to support him and
[32:18] it was just eye-opening to me how
[32:21] just as in that moment when a brother
[32:23] needed someone to
[32:24] lean on or to know that that he's loved
[32:28] by those around him should be the same
[32:30] thing with us that we should bear in one
[32:32] another's burdens
[32:33] and love one another and sometimes we
[32:36] get so busy in life
[32:37] that we don't make time for the ones
[32:40] that we love i think
[32:42] that's something that you know the lord
[32:45] says go out and
[32:46] preach the gospel to the whole world and
[32:48] it's just being that light and that love
[32:49] to people from a stranger to your
[32:51] to your mother your father your brother
[32:53] your sister and it's sometimes it's
[32:55] difficult
[32:56] because you as you know we all have
[32:57] faults and we have failures and we all
[32:59] have struggles but
[33:00] if we just keep looking to him we will
[33:04] never fail he said he'll never leave us
[33:06] forsaken so pray this song will be a
[33:07] blessing to you this morning
[33:10] i don't need any music it'll be
[33:22] octopello

[51:16] chapter 38.
[51:22] [Music]
[51:23] let me see
[51:26] [Music]
[51:33] you can make it bigger
[51:42] if you're there you can say amen
[51:47] how many listen or we're there when we
[51:49] preach part four
[51:52] a few hands did you have a chance those
[51:55] who missed to listen to it
[51:57] it was on a wednesday
[52:01] okay everything is on youtube
[52:05] it's free until the beasts cut off your
[52:09] internet
[52:11] then you're not going to be able to
[52:13] access it
[52:15] you think you can see it later if they
[52:17] cut off your internet they're going to
[52:18] catch your power they're going to catch
[52:20] your
[52:21] your uh alarm they can catch your camera
[52:24] and everything together
[52:26] so while it's yet time take your time
[52:29] and listen to the word of god if you
[52:32] miss
[52:33] it you have thursday
[52:36] friday saturday three days
[52:39] you can catch up amen
[52:44] god wants you to serve him in a
[52:46] different category
[52:49] god wants you to serve him different
[52:52] than before
[52:54] god wants you to serve him in a level
[52:57] that you never did it before
[53:01] god wants you to serve him genesis
[53:05] chapter 38 verse one
[53:09] and he came to pass a data
[53:12] that judah went down from his brethren
[53:17] judah was among his brethren
[53:21] and judah went down he didn't go up
[53:24] so it seems like he was stooping down
[53:27] because when the gospel
[53:29] was leaving the jews going to the
[53:32] gentile
[53:34] when peter went down to the house of
[53:36] cornelius
[53:37] they thought that he was stooping down
[53:40] because the gentile were dogs
[53:43] remember the crows we were unclean
[53:46] bird until god have to give cornelius
[53:50] our peter a vision to show him that what
[53:53] you call unclean
[53:55] don't call them unclean because my
[53:57] children are there
[53:58] so judah was going down like the gospel
[54:02] leaving israel
[54:03] going down he was going down from among
[54:06] his brethren
[54:07] judah was leaving his brethren christ
[54:10] was leaving
[54:11] the jews he came to his own and his own
[54:14] receive him not
[54:16] then he went straight to the gentile
[54:18] going down
[54:19] amen from his brethren and turned into a
[54:23] certain a dilemma
[54:25] whose name was hara and judah saw there
[54:29] a daughter of a certain canaanite whose
[54:32] name was sure
[54:33] and he took her and went into her
[54:37] and she conceived and bore his son and
[54:40] he called his name heir you might be
[54:43] seated
[54:46] and she conceived again and boris son
[54:49] and she called his name
[54:52] onan everybody there if you look at the
[54:56] first time
[54:57] it was judah who gave the name
[55:00] the bible say he called his name i just
[55:03] called it right now
[55:04] and the second one he was she called his
[55:07] name
[55:08] the church are you there call his name
[55:11] onan and she yet again conceive
[55:15] and bore his son and call his name
[55:18] sheila
[55:19] and he was at gazebo
[55:22] hallelujah
[55:26] when she bore him verse six and judah
[55:29] took a wife
[55:31] for air so there is three children here
[55:35] one of them is air who was the firstborn
[55:40] are you there and the second one is onan
[55:44] and the third is sheila
[55:47] judah took a wife to air to the first
[55:50] one
[55:52] the bible says in verse 7 6
[55:55] and judah took a wife for air he is
[55:58] firstborn
[55:59] whose name was temur so tamar
[56:03] her first husband was aaron that was the
[56:06] first husband
[56:08] of tema everybody feel clear
[56:14] amen let's see what's wrong with air
[56:18] and heir judah's firstborn was what
[56:22] he was bad he was a wicked one
[56:26] so the first husband that table have in
[56:30] her life
[56:31] was a wicked one he was not a good one
[56:36] he was a bad husband your first husband
[56:40] is a bad one are you there
[56:44] eyes opening praise the name of the lord
[56:48] amen he was wicked in the sight of the
[56:52] lord
[56:53] and the lord slow him who killed him
[56:57] so god have to kill your first husband
[57:02] the bad one god gotta kill him
[57:06] not put him on high cu
[57:09] he must be killed completely by god
[57:14] amen and judah said to onan
[57:18] go into your brother's wife
[57:22] and marry her and raise up seed to your
[57:25] brother so when the first wicked husband
[57:28] was destroyed
[57:30] from the life of tamer a door opened up
[57:34] by the law are you following me
[57:37] in other words the second husband
[57:41] of temer came by law
[57:45] it was the law that says that if your
[57:48] first husband died
[57:50] your brother can take over that wife
[57:54] if there is no kids to bring seed for
[57:56] his brother
[57:57] so the second husband was a husband that
[58:01] was provided by the word of god
[58:05] he was a husband that was provided
[58:08] by law are you there
[58:12] this husband is a first husband by
[58:15] nature are you there
[58:19] everybody who's a man he grow up he can
[58:21] get married
[58:22] but this husband onan was the first
[58:26] husband
[58:27] by law by religion
[58:31] are you following me by the word of god
[58:36] by religion it is the religion that
[58:40] provided a husband
[58:42] to tamar are you there the first one it
[58:46] was just a natural
[58:47] common thing for a woman to get married
[58:50] but the second one it was the church
[58:53] the religion the word of god that
[58:55] provided a husband
[58:57] are you following me let's see the
[59:00] husband
[59:01] amen praise the name of the lord
[59:05] the bible says in verse 9
[59:08] and onan knew that the seed
[59:12] should be his
[59:16] should not be his and he came to pass
[59:19] thank you
[59:21] when he went into his brother's wife
[59:24] that he spilled it on the ground
[59:27] now the seed we are talking about here
[59:30] is the seed of judah
[59:34] everybody clear this is a royal seed
[59:39] air carry that seed onan
[59:42] carry that seed are you there
[59:45] just like cal marlon and kylian
[59:49] carry those seed but both boys
[59:52] died are you there eliminate took them
[59:56] to the land of moab
[59:58] but both of those boys died are you
[1:00:01] following me
[1:00:02] so this one carried the seed of judah
[1:00:05] because with this first relationship
[1:00:08] temer
[1:00:09] never had a child with the first
[1:00:12] relationship ruth
[1:00:14] never had a baby with the first
[1:00:17] relationship
[1:00:18] oppa never had a baby are you there
[1:00:22] so the second relationship by the law
[1:00:25] was supposed to produce a child
[1:00:28] but this second husband
[1:00:32] this religious husband
[1:00:35] this husband that was given by the law
[1:00:38] by the word of god had
[1:00:41] they was carrying the seed of judah
[1:00:46] the spoken word is the original
[1:00:50] seed are you there
[1:00:53] instead of taking the seed of judah
[1:00:57] and directing that to the womb of the
[1:01:00] woman
[1:01:01] so that the woman can conceive
[1:01:04] he was only using tamar
[1:01:08] for pleasure are you there
[1:01:12] he was only using tamar
[1:01:15] for interest
[1:01:18] are you there he was only using temur
[1:01:23] to reap the benefits
[1:01:26] are you there but he was not interested
[1:01:30] on tamar conceiving or having a child
[1:01:34] are you following me he was carrying the
[1:01:37] seed
[1:01:38] he was carrying the word of god he was
[1:01:42] carrying the word of the hour
[1:01:44] but when it comes down that the woman is
[1:01:48] prepared to receive the word
[1:01:50] he was taking the word and spilling the
[1:01:54] message
[1:01:57] are you there he was deviating the
[1:02:00] message
[1:02:01] to give conception to the woman
[1:02:08] that he spilled it on the ground
[1:02:10] removing the world
[1:02:12] because if the seed goes there he knew
[1:02:15] he was not his child he want to get the
[1:02:19] glory
[1:02:20] he wants that child to be called after
[1:02:22] his own name
[1:02:24] he didn't want to raise a name for his
[1:02:27] brother
[1:02:28] he said i want that baby to be after my
[1:02:30] own name
[1:02:31] so since it's not going to be to my
[1:02:33] glory he took the word
[1:02:35] he took the seed and was peeling the
[1:02:38] seed
[1:02:38] away so every time tamar goes to church
[1:02:43] she's gonna be worked up on emotions
[1:02:47] she's gonna be worked up on pleasure
[1:02:50] she's gonna be worked up on many other
[1:02:52] things
[1:02:53] but when it comes to conception
[1:02:57] the seed is still on the ground
[1:03:01] are you there
[1:03:04] verse 10 and the things which he did
[1:03:09] displease the lord god watched the boy
[1:03:13] and when he seen that this boy was not
[1:03:16] interested to take the seed of judah
[1:03:20] and bring conception to the bride
[1:03:26] wherefore he threw him also
[1:03:30] god kill him
[1:03:34] everybody clear dan said judah to tim or
[1:03:38] his daughter-in-law
[1:03:40] remain a widow at your father's house
[1:03:43] just like naomi was telling ruth you
[1:03:46] need to go back to your father's house
[1:03:48] are you there it seems like misfortune
[1:03:50] is happening
[1:03:51] i don't know what's wrong with you the
[1:03:54] first husband no child
[1:03:56] second no child are you there a
[1:03:58] religious one
[1:04:02] till sheila my son be grown for he said
[1:04:06] let's perhaps he died also as his
[1:04:08] brethren did
[1:04:10] and tema went and dwell in his father's
[1:04:12] house
[1:04:13] in the process of time the daughter of
[1:04:16] shua judah's wife died
[1:04:19] and was comforted and went to the ship's
[1:04:22] year to timna
[1:04:23] to his friend harrah
[1:04:27] de abdullah watch verse 13.
[1:04:30] and he was told tamar somebody gave her
[1:04:33] a news
[1:04:34] faith cometh by what he was told tamar
[1:04:39] saying behold your father in law goes up
[1:04:42] not down at the beginning judah was
[1:04:46] going down
[1:04:47] now judah is ascending are you there
[1:04:50] going up to tim that to do what
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:55] steal the ship he was at the period
[1:04:59] where judah had a flock
[1:05:02] judah intention was not going to tamer
[1:05:06] the intention of judah was to go to the
[1:05:09] ship
[1:05:10] are you there
[1:05:14] in john chapter 10 jesus told the jews
[1:05:17] that i have other sheep
[1:05:20] which are not of this fog he was talking
[1:05:23] to the jews
[1:05:25] because the jews were the flock of god
[1:05:28] so judah was going to his flock
[1:05:31] in order to shear a ship the shearing of
[1:05:35] a ship
[1:05:36] is a process where they're removing the
[1:05:40] wall
[1:05:41] from a ship are you there
[1:05:44] they will move the wall for two things
[1:05:47] the wall is something that is very
[1:05:50] precious
[1:05:52] to the ship the wall number one it's
[1:05:55] something
[1:05:56] that is of value
[1:05:59] something that is precious to
[1:06:02] the ship number two by removing the wall
[1:06:07] it is also healthy
[1:06:10] for the ship because the more
[1:06:13] wall the ship gets are you there
[1:06:16] it gets so hot so they have to shear
[1:06:20] the ship and remove what
[1:06:23] the ship carry as a value
[1:06:27] they have to separate the ship
[1:06:30] from certain things of his life
[1:06:36] are you there at the time of separation
[1:06:41] at the time where god judah
[1:06:44] was trying to remove the world away
[1:06:47] from the ship to bring a separation
[1:06:51] between oppa and ruth at that time
[1:06:56] that's the time judah was going down
[1:07:01] everybody there and she put
[1:07:05] her widow garments off from her she took
[1:07:08] the route of jacob
[1:07:10] and cover her with a veil she wrapped
[1:07:13] herself
[1:07:14] with a bell she was not approximated
[1:07:18] she only disguised herself like jacob
[1:07:21] because that woman was after the seed of
[1:07:25] judah
[1:07:27] she was a gentile woman jacob was after
[1:07:31] the birthright
[1:07:34] are you there and jacob have to disguise
[1:07:37] himself everybody there
[1:07:41] and cover her with a veil and wrap
[1:07:44] herself and sat in
[1:07:45] open place which is by the way to timna
[1:07:49] for she saw that sheila was grown and
[1:07:52] she was not given to his wife
[1:07:55] to him as a wife when judah saw her
[1:07:59] he thought that was judah thinking she
[1:08:02] was not a prostitute
[1:08:04] he thought her to be a harlot
[1:08:08] because she had covered her face what
[1:08:11] does covering her face for a woman mean
[1:08:16] praise the name of the lord you got
[1:08:19] married
[1:08:20] you were wearing a veil do you know what
[1:08:22] it means we're going to get into it
[1:08:25] are you there verse 16
[1:08:29] and he turned to her by the way and said
[1:08:31] go
[1:08:32] so when this woman positioned herself
[1:08:36] on the road judah forgot
[1:08:40] that his first direction
[1:08:44] was to the ship are you there
[1:08:47] are you following me so the woman
[1:08:51] step in between the flock of judah
[1:08:55] in other words you deal with me first
[1:08:59] before you deal with israel

[1:09:16] step right there you dealing with me
[1:09:19] first
[1:09:20] before you deal with israel
[1:09:24] are you following me and judah when he
[1:09:28] saw this woman he forget about israel
[1:09:32] he began to deal with the woman and
[1:09:35] forgot the jews

[1:09:44] third husband

[1:10:14] timber was a deceiving husband
[1:10:21] he was a husband that didn't love tamar
[1:10:25] he was working by deception
[1:10:28] a spirit of deception are you there
[1:10:32] are you there but the third husband was
[1:10:35] judah himself are you there
[1:10:39] demon serve this husband
[1:10:42] for pleasure tamar served this husband
[1:10:46] for interest
[1:10:48] tamar served this husband for benefit

[1:10:56] to serve him in a different category

[1:28:14] if i'm not mistaken
[1:28:21] let me see if not
[1:28:28] corinthians it's a chapter that says
[1:28:30] possessing
[1:28:31] all forsaken
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:35] but possessing all things
[1:28:39] i might have quoted my scripture wrong
[1:28:42] but if it is we can pray and i can catch
[1:28:45] up later
[1:28:47] are you there
[1:28:50] forsaken but not abandoned things like
[1:28:54] that
[1:28:56] making some rich and yet possessing all
[1:28:58] things
[1:28:59] can somebody get me that scripture
[1:29:03] second corinthians six that was a verse
[1:29:07] seven
[1:29:08] that's it it's not seven it's six verse
[1:29:11] seven

[1:29:33] report
[1:29:34] some are saying good some are destroying
[1:29:36] you
[1:29:37] as deceiver and yet true as
[1:29:40] unknown and yet well known as dying
[1:29:44] and behold we live as chester and not
[1:29:47] kill
[1:29:48] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing

[1:29:55] and having nothing like roof
[1:29:58] losing everything are you there and yet
[1:30:02] possessing what are you there
[1:30:06] it looks like ruth lost everything
[1:30:10] no she was possessing all
[1:30:13] things that's what jesus was telling
[1:30:15] peter that
[1:30:16] you didn't lose everything you are
[1:30:18] actually possessing

[1:30:46] way lord
[1:30:47] may you come down and speak to your
[1:30:49] children may the holy spirit unfold
[1:30:52] this word like never before to your
[1:30:54] children lord
[1:30:55] father we rebuke every demonic spirit
[1:30:58] every spirit that is trying to bother
[1:31:00] your children
[1:31:02] further to bring them weariness by the
[1:31:04] reading of the scripture
[1:31:06] father we rebuke everything that is
[1:31:09] contrary to the word
[1:31:10] away from this place in the name of
[1:31:13] jesus christ
[1:31:14] may you come down and speak to your
[1:31:16] children be the alpha and the omega
[1:31:18] father in the name of jesus christ
[1:31:20] amen god bless you
[1:31:24] we're dealing with the mystery of the
[1:31:26] tuesday
[1:31:28] on part one when we start this subject
[1:31:32] we found out that the ark of the
[1:31:34] covenant have
[1:31:36] two states up there and on part one we
[1:31:39] explain to you that the first
[1:31:41] staff was the lord jesus christ
[1:31:44] on part two we discovered the second
[1:31:48] staff
[1:31:48] that he was crushed in the ministry
[1:31:52] of the bride in the end time ministry
[1:31:55] which is the message of the hour are you
[1:31:58] there
[1:32:00] then by doing those two things or
[1:32:02] discovering
[1:32:04] the first coming of jesus christ and the
[1:32:07] second coming of jesus christ
[1:32:08] we book we we pull together
[1:32:12] the two head of the zodiac in other
[1:32:14] words the entire bible
[1:32:16] the first coming and the second coming
[1:32:18] of jesus christ
[1:32:19] now we found out that the first staff
[1:32:22] was broken
[1:32:23] which was speaking about the crucifixion
[1:32:25] of jesus christ
[1:32:27] then the second stuff also was broken
[1:32:30] but when the second stuff was broken he
[1:32:33] also
[1:32:34] bring a separation between the kingdom
[1:32:37] of israel and the kingdom of judah
[1:32:41] so to understand the meaning of that
[1:32:43] separation
[1:32:44] we went into part three to understand
[1:32:47] what was the meaning of
[1:32:49] the separation of israel or the division
[1:32:53] that happened with israel then on part
[1:32:56] three we
[1:32:57] introduced three women we introduced
[1:33:00] oppa
[1:33:01] we introduced naomi and we also
[1:33:04] introduced
[1:33:04] roof and a decision have to be taken
[1:33:08] whether those women have to continue all
[1:33:11] the way
[1:33:11] to the land of moab or they have to
[1:33:14] remain
[1:33:15] all the way to the land of israel or
[1:33:17] they have to remain
[1:33:19] in the land of moan the decision that
[1:33:22] was taken
[1:33:23] brought a separation orpah went back to
[1:33:26] her god
[1:33:27] to moab but naomi and roof
[1:33:31] cling together and the clinging of naomi
[1:33:34] and ruth
[1:33:35] that's why we explain it that when the
[1:33:38] separation happened between
[1:33:40] israel and judah we found another tribe
[1:33:43] which was the tribal benjamin
[1:33:45] that cling into judah so just like naomi
[1:33:48] and ruth cling together judah
[1:33:52] and benjamin also cling together are you
[1:33:54] following me
[1:33:55] so we found out that israel represented
[1:33:59] oprah the corner part
[1:34:01] judah represented the roof which is the
[1:34:04] top of the blood
[1:34:05] and benjamin according to brother
[1:34:07] branham represented naomi
[1:34:09] which is the 124 000.
[1:34:13] then on part 4 we begin to deal with
[1:34:16] the land of judah when we enter
[1:34:19] into the land of judah we pull a man by
[1:34:22] the name of boaz
[1:34:24] and through powers we find out that the
[1:34:27] first
[1:34:27] benefit that was in the land of judah
[1:34:30] apart from the bread of judah was
[1:34:34] the mystery of the scepter everybody
[1:34:36] remember that
[1:34:38] after the scepter because judah was
[1:34:41] carrying the scepter
[1:34:42] of israel when jacob was blessing his
[1:34:46] children he told judah that the scepter
[1:34:49] shall never leave judah and that scepter
[1:34:53] was the lord jesus christ and brother
[1:34:56] brother
[1:34:56] told us that boaz was a type of jesus
[1:35:00] christ and through jesus christ we found
[1:35:03] out that
[1:35:03] the second benefit was the priesthood
[1:35:07] that was in judah because the first
[1:35:09] priesthood
[1:35:10] was through the leave out by the second
[1:35:13] priesthood
[1:35:14] was by the tribe of judah through
[1:35:17] melchizedek everybody following me
[1:35:20] then part five today we are continuing
[1:35:23] with the blessing of the benefit of
[1:35:27] judah that's why tamar said what would
[1:35:30] you give me
[1:35:31] peter say what will you give me i want
[1:35:33] to know the benefit
[1:35:35] i want to know you are telling me to
[1:35:36] leave moab
[1:35:38] you want me to leave moab you want me to
[1:35:40] separate from a friend
[1:35:42] you want me to separate from my brother
[1:35:44] you want me to separate from my sister
[1:35:47] you want me to separate from many things
[1:35:49] in my life
[1:35:50] but i'm going to a land that i don't
[1:35:52] know
[1:35:53] i'm going to an unknown man like abraham
[1:35:56] what will you give me
[1:35:59] are you there we found the scepter we
[1:36:02] found the priesthood
[1:36:04] that was hidden together when we start
[1:36:08] with them in our story today
[1:36:11] tema had the first husband everybody
[1:36:14] there
[1:36:15] thank you the first husband was wicked
[1:36:19] he was a bad one and god killed him
[1:36:23] what's going on brother branham in the
[1:36:25] message the invisible union of the blood
[1:36:28] of christ
[1:36:29] brother branham said now he was
[1:36:32] nature associated with
[1:36:35] death your first husband
[1:36:39] that had ruled over you was your nature
[1:36:42] by natural birth are you there
[1:36:47] natural you love the world
[1:36:50] because you are off you are the world
[1:36:53] and
[1:36:53] part of the world your desire was by
[1:36:56] nature
[1:36:58] to love the world which you are part of
[1:37:01] you are part of nature and that is your
[1:37:04] natural things
[1:37:06] because david expressed to us that we
[1:37:09] were born
[1:37:10] in sin we were shaped in iniquity
[1:37:14] coming to the world speaking lies so
[1:37:17] your first
[1:37:17] husband must die brother branham
[1:37:22] that's the reason you have to be born
[1:37:24] again
[1:37:25] you have to separate are you there
[1:37:29] this woman had to separate from her
[1:37:32] first husband but it is not
[1:37:35] you that do the separation the
[1:37:38] separation must be done
[1:37:40] by god are you there
[1:37:44] he says separate you have to die
[1:37:47] to that first husband you can't live
[1:37:49] with it
[1:37:50] you just can't say well i divorced him
[1:37:54] and hang him up there till occasion in
[1:37:57] other words
[1:37:57] if something don't work out i have plan
[1:38:00] b you don't do like that
[1:38:02] once you leave the land of moab you burn
[1:38:05] the bridges behind you
[1:38:07] your first husband must die everybody
[1:38:10] clear
[1:38:12] no sir no riding of divorcement
[1:38:15] he dies because divorcement he's still
[1:38:18] enough
[1:38:19] things might change he can come back we
[1:38:22] must make sure
[1:38:23] he's dead are you there
[1:38:27] he said the nature of the world has
[1:38:30] to die every speck of
[1:38:34] it has to die are you there
[1:38:38] you have to be reunited again with
[1:38:41] another
[1:38:42] nurture everybody clear that's why her
[1:38:45] first husband husband
[1:38:48] but the second husband was by law or by
[1:38:51] the word of god
[1:38:52] and the husband was deceiving one
[1:38:55] instead of
[1:38:56] taking the message instead of taking the
[1:39:00] seed
[1:39:00] and make sure we keep the message pure
[1:39:04] in order to produce the best in the life
[1:39:08] of sons and daughter of god we took the
[1:39:11] message
[1:39:12] and spilled it on the ground we
[1:39:14] destroyed the message
[1:39:16] we devaluated the message we removed the
[1:39:20] message
[1:39:21] away from the channel of the womb of the
[1:39:24] church
[1:39:26] and because of that god had to kill that
[1:39:30] second husband
[1:39:32] god had to separate you from that second
[1:39:35] husband
[1:39:36] what is it brother branham we know that
[1:39:39] the church could not
[1:39:41] the pentecostal church by no means
[1:39:44] by no means could carry out
[1:39:47] the last day what it is impossible
[1:39:52] for honor to carry the seed and to bring
[1:39:55] you a breath
[1:39:59] this message cannot be carried by
[1:40:02] denominational idea
[1:40:06] because the nomination will give you
[1:40:09] what pleases you denomination
[1:40:12] will use your task they will use your
[1:40:16] offering
[1:40:17] they will tell you what you want to hear
[1:40:20] but they will never give you
[1:40:22] the dark part of the message
[1:40:27] they will tell you where high heels
[1:40:30] will make up but you can still be a
[1:40:33] christian
[1:40:34] the message destroyed those stuff
[1:40:40] are you there could carry out
[1:40:43] the last day message in its present
[1:40:46] condition
[1:40:47] why he can't even agree on one
[1:40:50] or two words in a bible how are you
[1:40:53] going to do it
[1:40:54] he can't do it you see denomination is
[1:40:57] out
[1:40:59] it's going to be an elected people
[1:41:02] that is elected for right are you there
[1:41:06] you must be predestinated for that
[1:41:10] i will get into predestination now
[1:41:14] no and so do every one of us know
[1:41:17] that the whole rank of denominationals
[1:41:21] pentecostal and all are what
[1:41:24] so there is no way we can bring you back
[1:41:27] to the nomination
[1:41:28] for you to receive the best
[1:41:33] the nomination will abuse you
[1:41:36] they're gonna use your money they're
[1:41:38] gonna use your daddy
[1:41:40] they're gonna make you pay for prophecy
[1:41:42] pay for handkerchief
[1:41:44] pay to support the program but no life
[1:41:51] that's it that is to be to the born
[1:41:54] again christian
[1:41:56] of death uh-huh the
[1:41:59] third your first husband religious one
[1:42:02] is dead you know he's dead
[1:42:06] god let it die
[1:42:09] it is god that doesn't it is god that
[1:42:12] killed your first one it is god
[1:42:14] that is killing the second one because
[1:42:17] he is playing with the world
[1:42:23] are you there oh all of
[1:42:26] it scientific it is a rocket
[1:42:31] intellectual educational scientific ways
[1:42:36] of
[1:42:36] it so-called bible school and faith is
[1:42:39] what
[1:42:40] thank you jesus so when the second
[1:42:43] husband died
[1:42:45] it happened that it was the time of the
[1:42:47] shearing of the
[1:42:49] sheep so the sheep like i explained it
[1:42:53] to you

[2:02:53] to the world let the world wash you
[2:03:00] she put a veil for the third husband
[2:03:05] and the third husband was julia coming
[2:03:07] up the first one no pregnancy killed
[2:03:10] the second one killed the third one at
[2:03:13] the time
[2:03:14] that the lamb have to remove a time
[2:03:17] that roof have to separate from moab
[2:03:21] take off the wool and move on to a
[2:03:24] relationship with
[2:03:26] christ she put
[2:03:29] a veil over her head what does that feel
[2:03:32] means
[2:03:33] brother brother lika was explaining
[2:03:37] about
[2:03:37] why women felt their face when they get
[2:03:40] married
[2:03:41] why they may not understand that
[2:03:44] but what they are doing is knowing
[2:03:47] that they are a body they have no
[2:03:52] head the man is there that's the reason
[2:03:56] rebecca failed herself
[2:04:00] are you there the veiling of the head
[2:04:03] is showing a submissive a submission of
[2:04:07] a woman
[2:04:08] showing that i don't have any more
[2:04:13] tamar was telling judah no more
[2:04:16] head are you there i don't lean
[2:04:20] anymore on to my own understanding
[2:04:23] i have taken myself without
[2:04:26] i am surrendering to the will of christ
[2:04:33] they may not understand that but what
[2:04:35] they are doing
[2:04:37] knowing that they are a body they have
[2:04:39] no head
[2:04:40] the man is the head that's the reason
[2:04:42] rebecca failed herself
[2:04:44] and that's why the church ought to veil
[2:04:46] itself
[2:04:47] and surrender itself to who because he
[2:04:50] is dog
[2:04:52] and he is dog why does a woman every
[2:04:56] time she get married
[2:04:58] put a veil over her face she is coming
[2:05:00] to her
[2:05:02] the head just like rebecca did
[2:05:05] she put a veil over her face to meet
[2:05:07] hezek she has no more head
[2:05:10] asses her head and the church ought to
[2:05:13] be so
[2:05:15] submissive to the world that's why i'm
[2:05:17] preaching the way i'm preaching
[2:05:20] that everlove evils it's on face
[2:05:25] he has no head the nature of a woman is
[2:05:28] to submit to a man
[2:05:29] and that's what the church ought to be
[2:05:31] doing submitting to
[2:05:33] christ to his word to his what
[2:05:36] the doctrine of the message
[2:05:41] to his principle she takes no thought
[2:05:44] for herself
[2:05:45] she has no head crossed his
[2:05:48] head not some enthusiastic punch
[2:05:51] but crossed his head the word and the
[2:05:55] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:05:57] hallelujah
[2:05:58] jesus christ the same today and
[2:06:02] that same manifestation of the
[2:06:05] so this woman put it there and judah
[2:06:09] approaches when judah approaches
[2:06:12] she was given the signal she was given
[2:06:16] the stuff in the hand she was given the
[2:06:19] bracelet of judah
[2:06:20] what else those stuff means
[2:06:23] before we get into those stuff let's
[2:06:26] touch up
[2:06:27] on the rich young ruler everybody here
[2:06:32] you understand them you understand
[2:06:35] moab the rich young muller was rich
[2:06:39] he came for eternal life
[2:06:43] then he meets jesus christ jesus christ
[2:06:46] gave him
[2:06:46] an invitation to come and follow me
[2:06:51] why did jesus christ told him to follow
[2:06:56] him
[2:06:58] are you ready brother branham let me
[2:07:00] know
[2:07:03] in the message come follow me jesus said
[2:07:06] then listen at him
[2:07:08] he want to be a man
[2:07:11] so when jesus christ was talking to the
[2:07:14] rich young ruler
[2:07:16] jesus christ discerned that there was a
[2:07:19] gift of a ministry in the life of this
[2:07:24] child
[2:07:30] the call that jesus has given him
[2:07:33] to follow him head and to be
[2:07:36] a soul winner as a young man
[2:07:40] returned to him again he remembered
[2:07:44] that he had five brothers and back on
[2:07:47] earth
[2:07:48] he didn't want them in that place in
[2:07:51] other words
[2:07:52] on the second place where this young
[2:07:55] which ruler appeared in the bible he was
[2:07:57] in hell
[2:07:59] and when he was in hell he was telling
[2:08:01] abraham
[2:08:02] would you send lazarus to go over there
[2:08:06] and to preach to my brother so they
[2:08:08] don't come this place
[2:08:10] brother branham said he was the gift of
[2:08:13] an evangelist jesus gave him the
[2:08:17] opportunity
[2:08:18] to use it he refused it now
[2:08:21] the gift is activated in hell
[2:08:26] what is the message that i'm trying to
[2:08:28] say
[2:08:29] when god is pulling you
[2:08:32] to a higher calling when god
[2:08:36] is inviting you to a higher calling
[2:08:39] when judah is inviting you to a higher
[2:08:43] calling
[2:08:44] the woman was in her leading season
[2:08:48] it is telling you that there is
[2:08:50] something
[2:08:51] in your life that god put in
[2:08:55] and god is trying to use it
[2:08:58] that's why he's calling you
[2:09:01] if you miss it you're going to discover
[2:09:04] it in hell
[2:09:08] are you there
[2:09:12] lord help me when i get to
[2:09:13] predestination and you're going to see
[2:09:15] what is in you
[2:09:16] you want to see what serving god means
[2:09:18] because we're going to get to roof
[2:09:20] serving are you there are you there
[2:09:23] so this young ruler have a gift
[2:09:27] and when he came to jesus he had to move
[2:09:31] from a lower kind of serving god
[2:09:34] to a higher jesus wanted him to shear
[2:09:37] off
[2:09:38] follow him then jesus put him in a
[2:09:41] ministry
[2:09:42] to win shows but he didn't see
[2:09:45] far beyond he was looking at the woman
[2:09:49] what was his word brother bradham says
[2:09:53] he said send him back and let this
[2:09:56] message be brought to them to his
[2:09:58] brother
[2:09:58] he wanted to be a minister then he
[2:10:01] wanted to accept it he was what
[2:10:04] can't do it now his time he had
[2:10:07] opportunity
[2:10:08] but he didn't make his what so what
[2:10:11] god is trying to tell you make an
[2:10:14] investment
[2:10:15] now because when i send you to this
[2:10:19] world
[2:10:19] there is something that i put in you
[2:10:25] he was under the law jesus came with
[2:10:28] grace
[2:10:30] but jesus came with grace what is jesus
[2:10:33] telling him
[2:10:34] just religion won't work on him
[2:10:38] so this one young ruler here said
[2:10:42] good master now remember before i say it
[2:10:45] he had been taught to walk right he had
[2:10:48] a good education he had been taught
[2:10:50] business
[2:10:51] he was rich and was a ruler and he had a
[2:10:54] religion
[2:10:55] message but was confronted with another
[2:10:59] problem and he confronts all of us
[2:11:03] eternal life religion does not give us
[2:11:06] eternal life
[2:11:08] religious is a covering you just protect
[2:11:11] yourself but your inside might be like a
[2:11:13] devil
[2:11:15] but he don't give you it to give us
[2:11:17] eternal life
[2:11:19] yet him thought with the best teacher
[2:11:21] there was
[2:11:22] he was yet lacking something and the
[2:11:25] young man
[2:11:25] knew it because he said good master what
[2:11:29] can i do to inherit
[2:11:30] eternal life now you you believe
[2:11:33] jesus christ is god don't you so he knew
[2:11:37] the thought of the young man so he said
[2:11:40] keep the commandment he went right back
[2:11:43] to his religion
[2:11:44] to see what he would say about his
[2:11:46] religion he says
[2:11:48] in other words keep your religion god is
[2:11:51] giving
[2:11:52] you opportunity like naomi go back again
[2:11:55] tomorrow i want to see
[2:11:58] whether you want to follow me let's take
[2:12:01] proverbs chapter 18
[2:12:03] and see this rich young ruler
[2:12:06] what did he have why he didn't want to
[2:12:08] give up
[2:12:09] because when you look at the scripture
[2:12:12] superficially
[2:12:13] you're going to come up with a
[2:12:15] superficial
[2:12:16] understanding proverbs 18.
[2:12:20] the bible said he was rich verse 11.
[2:12:23] if you there you can say amen all right
[2:12:27] everybody there everybody there
[2:12:30] the bible says that the rich man's
[2:12:33] wealth
[2:12:34] is his what and a high wall
[2:12:38] in his own so in the mind of a rich man
[2:12:43] his wife is his security
[2:12:47] you understand now when they say rich
[2:12:49] young you need to understand what does
[2:12:51] which mean
[2:12:52] which means that his wealth is his
[2:12:55] security
[2:12:56] and god said carried off
[2:13:03] my god take proverbs 19 verse 4
[2:13:07] the next chapter if you dare you can say
[2:13:10] amen
[2:13:12] you there wealth next what
[2:13:16] so wealth brings security
[2:13:20] and love bring you friends
[2:13:24] so when jesus christ was telling him
[2:13:27] sell everything you have become poor
[2:13:31] jesus was telling him remove your
[2:13:34] security
[2:13:36] and cut off with all your friends
[2:13:40] you understand now separate yourself
[2:13:44] and come and follow me
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:47] and take the money and give it to the
[2:13:50] poor jesus designed that even though
[2:13:54] he was following the law he was
[2:13:57] yet lacking something he told jesus
[2:14:00] christ he said
[2:14:01] everything i follow jesus look at the
[2:14:04] discernment and say
[2:14:05] there is something you don't follow take
[2:14:08] that money
[2:14:09] give it to them if you remember the
[2:14:12] second time
[2:14:13] we see his story in the bible he was
[2:14:16] with the poor lazarus there
[2:14:18] lazarus was dying and he was eating fun
[2:14:22] he had the problem with the poor
[2:14:27] take detroit number 15
[2:14:33] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:14:37] lord i cannot rush where i stop i need
[2:14:40] to stop we will continue
[2:14:41] until this thing get down stocking
[2:14:44] pretty good
[2:14:45] deuteronomy 15 verse 11. if you dare you
[2:14:48] can say amen
[2:14:50] are you there for
[2:14:53] shall never cease out of the land
[2:14:57] that's why when judah looked at the
[2:15:00] the the prostituted mary breaking the
[2:15:04] alabaster box
[2:15:05] judah said you know what we can take
[2:15:07] this salad
[2:15:08] and then give the money to the poor
[2:15:10] jesus say uh-uh
[2:15:12] you want to steal that money the poor
[2:15:14] will always
[2:15:16] be with you in other words you will

[2:17:41] whosoever shall keep the whole law

[2:18:46] five of them are gone the one you have
[2:18:48] is not yours he said
[2:18:50] sir i perceive that you are
[2:18:53] and when jesus opened up she changed her
[2:18:56] life
[2:18:57] she deposit everything the rich young
[2:18:59] ruler didn't want to change his life
[2:19:03] he didn't want to leave it brother
[2:19:05] brother say how far
[2:19:07] have we drifted from it the same thing
[2:19:11] this boy did here
[2:19:12] he rejected refuse eternal life because
[2:19:15] he would cost him his social standing
[2:19:18] it will cost him his luxury of money he
[2:19:22] will cost him his fellowship in the
[2:19:23] church
[2:19:24] i miss my friend over there i need to go
[2:19:27] back to my friend it will cost him a lot
[2:19:29] of things
[2:19:30] he know what he was going to cost him he
[2:19:33] was sensible boy
[2:19:34] and he felt that he could not pay the
[2:19:36] price
[2:19:37] yet he thought i shall trust my religion
[2:19:40] and go on
[2:19:41] i can still believe the bible and go on
[2:19:44] but down in his heart
[2:19:45] he know there was something about jesus
[2:19:48] about the message
[2:19:49] was different from them priest of that
[2:19:52] day
[2:19:53] and any message that is coming in a
[2:19:56] genuine
[2:19:57] born message of god is different from
[2:20:00] all
[2:20:01] the old trend that's why we must
[2:20:05] be different because the message is
[2:20:08] different
[2:20:10] oh my god let's follow this young ruler
[2:20:14] the next time we find him in the bible
[2:20:16] as soon as he rejected the opportunity
[2:20:18] to follow jesus
[2:20:20] when he was laid down to him pretty
[2:20:22] stiff you see
[2:20:23] we want to hold on to everything that we
[2:20:26] can
[2:20:27] and then follow jesus
[2:20:30] you see the problem you don't want to
[2:20:32] give up your friend on facebook
[2:20:34] you don't want to give up your friends
[2:20:36] on instagram you want to keep posting
[2:20:38] things
[2:20:38] every day and people clapping their
[2:20:41] hands like
[2:20:42] like like yeah like like like and the
[2:20:45] more like you have
[2:20:47] the more he bring you to do it over
[2:20:50] until you can sit one hour without
[2:20:53] checking your telephone
[2:20:55] you are checking status to see how many
[2:20:58] people likes it
[2:21:01] you want to hold on everything that we
[2:21:03] can and follow jesus
[2:21:05] but sometime jesus wants you to turn
[2:21:08] loose off everything
[2:21:09] so we can get buff's hand on him
[2:21:13] are you there it's gonna cost you
[2:21:16] something
[2:21:18] let's look at peter we finish with the
[2:21:20] young ruler
[2:21:21] we finish with them let's look at peter
[2:21:24] on matthew chapter four
[2:21:27] once i get peter then we zero in
[2:21:30] straight to the airport
[2:21:31] with full speed are you there
[2:21:34] let's take matthew chapter four
[2:21:40] this is to position you
[2:21:43] are you there matthew chapter 4
[2:21:47] verse 18 some are still flipping pages
[2:21:51] giving me time to drink
[2:21:55] water before somebody say he drink no
[2:21:58] water
[2:22:02] matthew chapter 4 verse 18
[2:22:06] and jesus walking by the sea of galilee
[2:22:09] saw two brethren someone called peter
[2:22:11] and andrew his brother
[2:22:13] casting a net into the sea for they were
[2:22:15] officials
[2:22:16] they had a profession do you know that
[2:22:18] peter was married
[2:22:20] thank you if you need a scripture you
[2:22:22] see me and he said to them
[2:22:25] follow me same thing they told the young
[2:22:27] ruler
[2:22:29] and i will make you what the same
[2:22:32] opportunity that was given to the rich
[2:22:35] young ruler
[2:22:36] was given to peter are you there
[2:22:40] follow me and verse 20. and then what
[2:22:45] immediately they didn't take time they
[2:22:48] didn't seek to begin to think
[2:22:52] immediately left there
[2:22:55] and follow they were able to be shielded
[2:22:59] they were like roof they were ready to
[2:23:02] forsake their god
[2:23:03] forsake their people forsake the
[2:23:06] occupation
[2:23:07] and go to the mark of the high calling
[2:23:09] why
[2:23:10] peter have a gift just like the young
[2:23:13] ruler have a
[2:23:15] gift but the young ruler
[2:23:18] failed to see four things you ready
[2:23:22] a decision have to be made from him to
[2:23:25] be sheared off
[2:23:26] roof decided that decision
[2:23:30] was calling him for a high calling to
[2:23:32] serve christ
[2:23:34] the second point he wanted to serve god
[2:23:38] in a different category than before
[2:23:41] because the law didn't give him eternal
[2:23:43] life
[2:23:44] he gave him prestige he gave him
[2:23:47] practice with the pharisee
[2:23:48] because he had a lot of money everybody
[2:23:50] want to talk to him the third one
[2:23:52] is there was a rest connected to his
[2:23:55] calling
[2:23:56] the rest brother branham said is the
[2:23:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:24:00] the rich young ruler never seen
[2:24:02] pentecost
[2:24:04] jesus was calling him to serve him
[2:24:08] then later on fill him on the day of
[2:24:10] pentecost
[2:24:11] he didn't see that are you there he
[2:24:14] stopped
[2:24:15] peter follow him and when peter
[2:24:18] struggled
[2:24:19] jesus prayed for peter this
[2:24:22] just came right now when peter struggled
[2:24:25] because he was willing to forsake
[2:24:28] everything
[2:24:29] are you there and to follow jesus christ
[2:24:33] when peter begin to struggle jesus come
[2:24:36] and say
[2:24:37] listen you took a stand for me
[2:24:40] satan is following you he wanted to kill
[2:24:43] you in the car accident
[2:24:44] this morning but i pray for you
[2:24:49] are you there i pray for you that you
[2:24:52] are
[2:24:53] faith fairness not are you there
[2:24:57] and when peter went to his struggle like
[2:25:00] you're denying jesus the first
[2:25:02] the second time when jesus was again
[2:25:05] and met the people at the resurrection
[2:25:08] he said
[2:25:09] god tell my disciple and
[2:25:15] and who peter he didn't say and by
[2:25:18] telling me
[2:25:19] and peter because peter took instead
[2:25:23] once you take a stand once you are
[2:25:26] willing to forsake everything
[2:25:28] it is god taking over your life
[2:25:31] are you there even if you struggle
[2:25:34] somewhere he already prayed for you
[2:25:40] are you there the rich young ruler never
[2:25:43] seen
[2:25:43] it he didn't want to decide he missed
[2:25:46] the high calling
[2:25:47] he missed the opportunity to serve god
[2:25:49] in a different category
[2:25:51] he missed the holy ghost that was coming
[2:25:53] in pentecost and he's gonna miss the
[2:25:55] second coming because
[2:25:56] he's still in hell the reward
[2:25:59] roof deciding roof serving
[2:26:02] roof resting roof rewarded
[2:26:06] everybody clear just like oppa after the
[2:26:10] separation happened
[2:26:11] oppa went the rich young wooly but peter
[2:26:14] was like roof willing to go all the way
[2:26:17] up

[2:27:13] that the first bread
[2:27:14] which was the value was the first part
[2:27:16] of the message
[2:27:18] and the second one was following
[2:27:20] maturing behind
[2:27:21] the valley which was the opening of the
[2:27:24] seventh
[2:27:25] seal a measure of which for measure of
[2:27:27] valley
[2:27:28] are you there we seen that roof
[2:27:32] we found out that she was a motherboard
[2:27:34] and bringing more about on wednesday
[2:27:37] which meant to you that there was an
[2:27:38] ordinance that was standing against moab
[2:27:41] that said that no more god can enter the
[2:27:44] congregation of
[2:27:45] israel that was the word of god
[2:27:48] that was planned in the book of nehemiah
[2:27:51] they even kicked people out because of
[2:27:53] their law
[2:27:54] but roof because she accepted to follow
[2:27:58] the land of judah to follow the high
[2:28:01] calling
[2:28:01] she entered into judah and we found out
[2:28:04] that through
[2:28:05] judah there was a mystery of the golden
[2:28:08] scepter because scepter was in judah
[2:28:12] and with that god then scepter are you
[2:28:14] there
[2:28:15] he has the opportunity to go above the
[2:28:18] law
[2:28:19] are you there even though they say no
[2:28:22] but
[2:28:23] even though it is connected to death
[2:28:26] but somehow the golden scepter will open
[2:28:29] up the way for you
[2:28:30] to go beyond the law take esther chapter
[2:28:34] four
[2:28:36] hallelujah esther come after nehemiah

[2:29:13] everybody clear watch it step four
[2:29:18] all the king servant the people of the
[2:29:20] king's province do know

[2:31:32] of the people according to the law that
[2:31:35] is of their brethren
[2:31:36] though they come out of the loans of who

[2:32:01] for the ones that tabernacle made that
[2:32:04] the first wearing
[2:32:05] was the the tabernacle here
[2:32:09] paul called the holy place the
[2:32:11] tabernacle
[2:32:12] because that's where the candlestick
[2:32:14] were everybody following me
[2:32:17] the candlestick and the table and the
[2:32:19] showbread
[2:32:20] which was called there the holy place
[2:32:23] was
[2:32:24] also called the sanctuary that's where
[2:32:26] you found the
[2:32:27] shoe bread you found the table and you
[2:32:30] found the candlestick

[2:32:33] outside are you there
[2:32:35] verse three and after the second fail
[2:32:38] not this fail
[2:32:39] this is the first the second verb
[2:32:42] you see why paul said that he's
[2:32:45] describing here
[2:32:46] and he say after the second verse the
[2:32:49] other chord
[2:32:50] the first veil the second after the
[2:32:53] second in other words
[2:32:54] paul is bringing you to the holy of
[2:32:56] holies to the inner court
[2:32:58] he said after the second film
[2:33:01] the tabernacle which is called the
[2:33:05] did you understand that holy of the
[2:33:07] holiest job to verse six
[2:33:10] now these things
[2:33:13] were thus or then the priest went
[2:33:16] always in the first tabernacle
[2:33:19] accomplishing the service of god
[2:33:20] in other words the priests always get
[2:33:22] here nobody goes there
[2:33:25] are you following me inner court verse 8
[2:33:29] verse 7 but into the second
[2:33:32] the holy of holies went there high
[2:33:35] priest alone
[2:33:36] do you see that you must be called once
[2:33:39] every year not without blood which he
[2:33:42] offered for himself
[2:33:44] and for the era of the people verse 8
[2:33:47] the holy ghost this signifying in other
[2:33:51] words
[2:33:51] by the priest going only one time over
[2:33:55] there
[2:33:55] the holy ghost was speaking something
[2:33:58] the holy ghost was showing something the
[2:34:01] holy ghost was
[2:34:03] signifying that the way
[2:34:06] into the holy of holies of the holiest
[2:34:10] of all
[2:34:10] was not yet been what in other words the
[2:34:14] way was not
[2:34:15] open are you there
[2:34:18] well as the first tabernacle was yet
[2:34:22] standing in other words when they tell
[2:34:25] you
[2:34:26] that you cannot enter into the king
[2:34:30] place until they accept if the king
[2:34:33] calls you
[2:34:34] he was showing in the book of hebrew
[2:34:37] that the way
[2:34:38] to enter into the holy of holies
[2:34:41] was still blocked but god
[2:34:45] had the scepter that scepter have to
[2:34:48] come out of
[2:34:49] jacob and that scepter was jesus christ
[2:34:53] when jesus christ comes then he brings
[2:34:56] the scepter
[2:34:58] and he break that law that's why when
[2:35:01] jesus was dying at the cross
[2:35:03] the veil the second veil
[2:35:06] of the temple was whipped apart
[2:35:10] opening the way to the holy of holies
[2:35:14] in other words you have the right to
[2:35:16] enter in the presence
[2:35:17] of god

[2:35:24] open tech chapter 10
