[0:00] God as long as he's God. You say, "Is
[0:02] that true, Brother Brandham? Is that the
[0:04] scripture?" Hebrews 13:8.
[0:07] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[0:10] and forever.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[0:12] &gt;&gt; he's the same.
[0:14] So, what ought to be our plea tonight,

[1:06:16] of his venison. But Rebecca loved Jacob.
[1:06:21] And Jacob sowed pottage. And Esau came
[1:06:26] from the field, and he was faint.
[1:06:29] And said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray thee
[1:06:35] with that same bread pottage,
[1:06:38] for I am faint." Therefore was his name
[1:06:41] called Edom.
[1:06:44] And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy
[1:06:48] birthright."
[1:06:50] And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the
[1:06:53] point of death.
[1:06:56] And what prophet shall this birthright
[1:06:59] do to me?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Okay, just wait. And Jacob said,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; swear to me
[1:07:08] this day,
[1:07:10] and they swear unto him, and he sold his
[1:07:13] birthight unto Jacob.
[1:07:17] Then Jacob
[1:07:20] gave Esau bread and porridge of lintters
[1:07:25] and he did eat and drink and rose up and
[1:07:30] went his way. Thou Isel despised
[1:07:35] birth right.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Let's read another scripture from the
[1:07:40] book of Hebrews chapter 12.
[1:07:46] Hebrews 12,
[1:07:49] let's read from verse 14.
[1:07:54] Follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:07:59] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Looking diligently,
[1:08:04] lest any man fail
[1:08:08] of the grace of God.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:08:11] Lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:08:14] trouble you
[1:08:16] and thereby many be defiled,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; lest there be any fornicator
[1:08:24] or profane person
[1:08:27] as is
[1:08:30] who for one mush of meat sold his
[1:08:35] birthight.
[1:08:38] For ye know
[1:08:40] how that afterward,
[1:08:42] when he would have inherited the
[1:08:45] blessings, he was rejected,
[1:08:49] for he found no place of repentance,
[1:08:52] though he sought it carefully
[1:08:56] with tears.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Let's read the last scripture from
[1:09:01] Deuteronomy
[1:09:02] 32.
[1:09:07] I know we love to read the Bible.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Deuteronomy 32,
[1:09:15] read
[1:09:17] a verse from there. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:19] Let's read verse 29.
[1:09:24] Oh,
[1:09:26] that they were wise.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; That they understood this.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; That they would consider
[1:09:36] their latter end.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Shall we please be seated?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Think about it. God speaking through the
[1:09:49] prophet. Oh, that they would have
[1:09:52] considered that they would consider the
[1:09:56] latter end.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of
[1:10:01] Ecclesiastes
[1:10:02] chapter 7 verse 8, it said, "Better is
[1:10:06] the end
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; of a thing."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Than the beginning thereof.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Better is the end of a thing.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, my God.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Than the beginning thereof. Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; So the Bible tells us again that if they
[1:10:23] were wise, oh that they were wise,
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; they would consider their latter end.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; So this evening we pray God to help us
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; to be wise.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Because the wise will consider the
[1:10:38] latter end.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; For the end of a thing is better
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; than the beginning. That's it. That's
[1:10:47] why the scripture tells us
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; those that will endure to the end,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; they shall be saved.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; It's good to start, but what good will
[1:10:58] it do if you don't end it?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; So the Bible tells us the end of a thing
[1:11:06] is better.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; So if you have started, let's ask grace
[1:11:15] to end it. and end it where?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; We are in a race.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; We are in a race.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Many start the race,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; But not many, not all comes to the end
[1:11:37] of it. No.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; So, Apostle Paul spoke and he said, "But
[1:11:44] we
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; we are not of them that turn back."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; We are of them that believe
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; to the end
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; to the saving of the soul.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; they would consider the latter end.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So, I pray tonight that all of us will
[1:12:05] be wise. Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; So that whatever you are doing today
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; think about the end.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:12:16] amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Consider the end.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Because the end is better.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; And whatever we are doing
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; we are being admonished again.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus gave a parable.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he told us in a parable,
[1:12:35] this is how I will put these people. He
[1:12:38] said, he gave the parable of the
[1:12:40] builders, two people that build a house.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Come on, brother.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He said, those that will hear my word, I
[1:12:48] will liken them.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Those that will hear my word,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And they will do what I say.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Will be likened unto a wise man. Uh-huh.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; To consider the end.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; So, he also told us in another parable.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You must count the cost.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; If you are even going to war,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; if you are going to fight,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; whatever you are going to do, if you are
[1:13:23] going to build a house
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; is whatever you are doing, say you have
[1:13:26] to count the cost. Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; If you're going to meet an army, say
[1:13:32] kind of that this army that I'm going to
[1:13:34] fight, if you're going to fight Israel,
[1:13:36] you must think way.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; If you start war with Israel, make sure
[1:13:40] you'll be able to finish it.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, listen. The God of
[1:13:46] Israel is alive today.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel is fighting today.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Listen. Do you know that this recent war
[1:13:55] they fought 12 days what? You know what
[1:13:57] the Iranians are saying? They said
[1:13:59] Israel use oultic power.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a is the power of God.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; So they knew there was something
[1:14:11] supernatural,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; something beyond man,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; something beyond human.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And today it is aotic.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; But to us it is the power of God. It is
[1:14:23] the God of Israel.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; It is the God of Abraham that is
[1:14:28] fighting, that is standing behind the
[1:14:30] word.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Because ever since they've been in
[1:14:33] Palestine, the God of Abraham has been
[1:14:35] fighting.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; But the people are blinded.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So they cannot see it. They can't see
[1:14:42] that this is the small people. But oh,
[1:14:45] hallelujah.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Our God is alive.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; The God we are serving today.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Is the God of Israel.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Is the God of Abraham
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; is the God of Moses.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Is the God of the scriptures.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Is the God of Will and Branham.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He is our God today. is the same
[1:15:18] yesterday,
[1:15:20] today, and forever.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So don't
[1:15:26] fear,
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; fear no little frog.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It is our father's good will
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; to give us a kingdom.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Our God will fight for us.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Our God will protect us.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Our God will defend us.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Somebody give a
[1:15:42] clap of it to Jesus Christ. Yes, sir.
[1:15:48] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Glory, Lord.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I will like him unto a wise man.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; The one that hears my word
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; and does the thing that I say.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Not what you think. Not what anybody
[1:16:09] says, not anybody ideas, but the thing

[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the only way that you
[1:16:38] must get the revelation
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; to know who is speaking
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; to know who he is
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; that he is and the rewarder of those
[1:16:51] that diligently seek him
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; May God help us church of the living
[1:16:57] God.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; So that we will not just hear God's word

[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and there was storm and there was this
[1:18:21] and that." He said, "But that house
[1:18:23] stood firm

[1:19:09] the thing that I say, I will liken him
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; unto a wise man
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; who build his house. So as we hear the

[1:20:22] prophet of God for the age, the
[1:20:24] foundation of everything is very
[1:20:25] important.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; If your building is going to stand, it
[1:20:32] depends on your foundation.

[1:20:53] the sand.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; So how are you building?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Lord

[1:21:10] difficulties in life. You cannot stop
[1:21:12] it. They will come.
[1:21:15] They came upon the wise building,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; the wise man's building, and the foolish
[1:21:20] man's building.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Both of them.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Both of them.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Both of them.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Both of them.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; But what made one to stand was
[1:21:29] foundation.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody didn't want to pay the price.
[1:21:40] Somebody didn't want to pay the price
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; to dig and lay this good foundation.
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; You You got to dig.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; You got to dig,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; dig and get to the rock,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; that rock of revelation
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; to know who Jesus is.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; We are not asked to understand. We asked
[1:22:03] to believe it.
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:06] That's why he said to the disciples,
[1:22:08] "Will you also go?" Because he said
[1:22:10] something that somebody didn't
[1:22:11] understand it or didn't understood. He
[1:22:13] said, "If you eat a sec, you eat my
[1:22:15] friends and drink my blood, you have no
[1:22:16] pardon me."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say he didn't explain
[1:22:19] it.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he didn't explain it.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Was it a wrong statement?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Was it a false statement?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was saying.
[1:22:31] Thank God brother said I know where I'm
[1:22:34] standing.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; He said when I say I'm the voice of God
[1:22:39] to you. He said there is some
[1:22:41] resentment.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; He said but I am.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I know where I am standing.
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody want some explanation said
[1:22:55] note. We are not asked to be explained
[1:22:57] anything explained to us.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't explain to Isaiah when
[1:23:01] he say a virgin shall conceive.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; He did prophesy.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet if they've as if the people
[1:23:10] they if they had Isaiah question what do
[1:23:12] you mean? He said what did I say?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You say a virgin shall conceive.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; How do you explain it? I don't know.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; No explanation.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the spirit said.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Let him hear what the spirit is saying.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:32] Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, which of the builders are you
[1:23:36] today?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Glory Lord.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; May help you help us to be wise
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; builders.
[1:23:49] Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Once again, we have heard it many times,
[1:23:52] but we are being reminded
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; that listen the importance of revelation
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; to the true believer.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; The importance of revelation by the
[1:24:02] spirit of God.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; To the true believer can never be
[1:24:07] overemphasized.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It can never be overemphasized. So we
[1:24:14] cannot stop talking about revelation
[1:24:15] here.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; No sir. The importance of it.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It makes a difference.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he made a
[1:24:22] difference in the garden of Eden
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; between Cain and Abe.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; There was a difference.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; A by revelation
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; offered unto God. A more excellent
[1:24:34] sacrifice,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; a more excellent. So somebody had
[1:24:38] excellent.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And when you go to school, you have
[1:24:41] excellent, but somebody have more
[1:24:45] excellent. Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you can worship
[1:24:49] beautifully but it must be by
[1:24:51] revelation.
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; I went somewhere and they were sharing
[1:25:02] say some people even went to church
[1:25:05] and there was sisters say amen. Praise
[1:25:08] the Lord.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody said we cannot sit down for
[1:25:11] them to say amen. We cannot say amen. So
[1:25:14] there was even competition in saying
[1:25:15] amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; When he says amen, I cannot just sit
[1:25:21] down. Why?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's kind of
[1:25:25] revelation.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Revelation. They just competing say
[1:25:28] amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; This amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Because somebody say amen. Oh no.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] God help us.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not against your amen. But why
[1:25:46] are you saying amen?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; What prompt your amen?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; What makes you shout?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; What makes you sing?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; What makes you dance?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It might be by revelation.
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; May God help us church.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my word and that was in
[1:26:13] that I say, I will liken him. Jesus
[1:26:15] said, I will liken to a wise man.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; That build his house upon the rock.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And the wind came
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and the storm came and the rain came and
[1:26:29] beat upon it
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; and it stood still.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:26:36] Life has a lot of challenges.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Christians has a lot of challenges.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; What in the Bible tells many are the
[1:26:48] afflictions
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; of the righteous
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; but the Lord delivers him from all.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says sometimes when we
[1:26:56] become Christians we have more troubles
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; that when we were not.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] So somebody say if you're a Christian
[1:27:07] why all these troubles
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; why this trials
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; yes because I I am a Christian
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; and because you a Christian
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; and God allows you to be tested
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; listen the father we believe the truth
[1:27:24] we have the truth we have the word of
[1:27:26] God does not exempt us from trials
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said the winds will blow
[1:27:32] the water will come the rains the flood
[1:27:34] We come.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And beat upon the house.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; The storms will come.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes listening.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:27:50] Do you know that storms sometime when
[1:27:53] they come is not only to destroy things.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it clears your path for you.
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Sometime the storm come to clear the
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Look. Hey. Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I mean in one of the wars of Israel,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; their enemies laid a lot of land mines.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And so when they got to that spot,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; man, what are we going to do?
[1:28:26] So they thought of destroy the captain
[1:28:29] said, "No, we got to remove them." But
[1:28:31] there were thousands.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And you know what? the supernatural God.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Right at that time,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; there came a mighty wind storm
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; and blew
[1:28:44] heavy wind, heavy storms. You know what
[1:28:46] they did? It exposed all the land minds.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And the Israelite they just walk over
[1:28:53] it.
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; So sometimes storm comes on your way,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; trials comes on your way,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; challenges come on your way.
[1:29:05] to clear your part of you.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:30:30] trial
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; when you have to try
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; your trial is your testimony oh
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; your trial is your testimony
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; without trial you don't have a testimony
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:54] When you read Job, when you read
[1:30:56] Abraham, what is is a trial?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; But that is their testimonies.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; All the Bible that we read about is the
[1:31:03] testimonies of our brothers.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; They are testim they stood on the word.
[1:31:07] They had trials. They have challenges.
[1:31:10] They have disappointments. But that is
[1:31:12] their testimonies.
[1:31:14] And your own trial is your testimony.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, my child did this. My son did this.
[1:31:20] My daughter did this. My neighbors don't
[1:31:22] like me. They did. That's your
[1:31:24] testimony.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; The trials. When you go through your
[1:31:28] trials, it becomes your testimony.

[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And the prophet of God
[1:31:41] said, "The more loyal you are, the more
[1:31:43] the test."
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Hallelujah."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; People don't want to hear the prophecy,
[1:31:54] but
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that said,
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; "I will tell you the prophet said."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you have a trial,
[1:32:03] you find favor with God."
[1:32:07] He said if you have a trial
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; that mean God has confidence in you.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And he said God knows
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; God knows that you will stand a trial.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; God believe in you.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That's why he bring trial.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; He has confidence in you
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; as he had confidence in Job.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; So God has confidence in me
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; and God has confidence in you. And God
[1:32:30] has confidence in his people.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus.

[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; make a choice. Make up your mind.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Make up your mind.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Don't just be coming and going.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Oh no. I want to go and see what they
[1:36:41] are doing. Make up your mind
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; since you have been coming. Have you not
[1:36:45] seen what we are doing here?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Have you not seen it?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Have you not seen you want to see what
[1:36:50] we are? Yes, this is what we are doing.

[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; We are messages of followers of the
[1:36:57] message of the hour.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That brings us back to the scriptures.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; So since you have been coming,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; some of you were born in this message.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Your mama and papa they born you here.

[1:37:10] When are you going to decide? When are
[1:37:12] you going to make a choice? What are you
[1:37:15] waiting for? What do you want to see?
[1:37:18] What do you want to hear? When the Bible
[1:37:21] says today, when you hear his voice,
[1:37:24] harden not your heart. What you can do
[1:37:27] today, don't push it to tomorrow.
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:35] All that they were wise,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; they would have considered a later end.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Think about the end.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I will do it tomorrow. Say it's not
[1:37:48] tomorrow. It's now.

[1:37:52] No, no, no, no. It's now. Get the Holy
[1:37:55] Ghost now.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Because do you know tomorrow?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Can you tell tomorrow? So make up your
[1:38:01] mind. Choose now.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's the God of the now.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; No one matter said now that you are
[1:38:14] here.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Now that you are here.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I know things will happen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I know things will change.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now that you are here,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Now that you are here, my brother,
[1:38:26] sister, and you are hearing these
[1:38:28] things, you have been here. Oh my
[1:38:30] goodness, sometimes sad
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; for husbands and wife to be having
[1:38:34] challenges and fighting and force when
[1:38:36] this pastor here teaches so much on Ruth
[1:38:39] on this and that and that and Jennis
[1:38:42] here and there and you are still in this
[1:38:44] condition.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You are still in this condition.
[1:38:48] After hearing all these preachings,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; all these teachings,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; you are in this condition.
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; May God help us church.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Hey God,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; which of the two beers are you?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Or you want an angel to come and stand
[1:39:14] here?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; If an angel come, will you be able to
[1:39:16] stand? If an angel of God come and stand
[1:39:18] here, can you sit down?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Will you be able to hear anything? If an
[1:39:23] angel come down,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; God uses man.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Men are God's agent.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; God choose to use man. Brother say he
[1:39:35] could have choose the sun. He could have
[1:39:37] choose the moon. He could have choose
[1:39:38] the wind. But he choose man.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Man is God's agent. So if you want an
[1:39:45] angel to come and preach, you will not
[1:39:47] get an angel to come. God's angel. We
[1:39:49] are the angels.
[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; If you are wise, you will consider that.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I will not try to take
[1:40:12] much of your time. But
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; look at
[1:40:17] right there.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Look at that boy.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; He was a good boy.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He was very caring.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; He was very, very caring. Very good boy.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; But he didn't get the revelation of the
[1:40:32] birthright.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; You talk about good works. My my my
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; you talk about good ways.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Who was Jacob? Nowhere.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Jacob was nowhere.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Follow my mind everywhere. Listen. But
[1:40:51] there was something he was looking for.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Right from birth.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Right from the mother's womb.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; He got the revelation of that birth.
[1:40:58] Right.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; So right from the womb of the mother, he
[1:41:02] was fighting for it. He said, "Listen,
[1:41:04] no matter who I am, what what I must get
[1:41:06] the he knew that it would only take the
[1:41:09] birthight to change him."
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He knew it's only the birthright that
[1:41:19] can change him.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was a planter. Yes, he was this.
[1:41:22] And whatever I have, I want to get the
[1:41:24] birthight.
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; When I get it, I will get everything.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And when you get the birthright, you get
[1:41:31] everything. When you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:41:33] you get everything.
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; For if the spirit of him that raised
[1:41:39] Christ from the dead dwells in you, he
[1:41:42] that raised Christ from the dead will
[1:41:44] quicken your mortal bodies and sin and
[1:41:47] corruption and adultery and lying and
[1:41:50] cheating and unbelief. Whatever form
[1:41:53] they are, spiritual fornication,
[1:41:56] spiritual adultery will not have
[1:41:58] dominion over you because the Holy Ghost
[1:42:01] will transform your life and will change
[1:42:04] you.
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; So it's not how good you are.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; It is meeting God's requirement.
[1:42:21] is respecting God's word.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Is honoring God by taking his word.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Because God respects the birthright
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; and you despise the birthight.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Something that God respects.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; God has laid it down
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; and you don't see the use of it.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Like people they say baptism is not
[1:42:49] necessary. Which one is necessary?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Which one is necessary?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Baptism is not necessary. This is not
[1:42:56] necessary. This is not okay.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; It might not be necessary to you because
[1:43:02] you don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Because you don't have revelation.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; May God help us, church.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody because of hunger food
[1:43:22] just come out
[1:43:24] the one that is looking for the best
[1:43:26] brother today.

[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Mother was not there. Father was not
[1:44:26] there.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; But there was a witness.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And God saw to it.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; That what he has spoken with his mouth.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you say.
[1:44:51] When you are happy, be careful what you
[1:44:53] say.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; When you are not happy, be careful what
[1:44:56] you say.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; In every situation, let your words be
[1:45:00] seasoned with salt.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Don't speak foolishly and by heart
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; because words are spirit.
[1:45:15] I've heard people say if this if I will
[1:45:17] go to hell let me go to hell.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; You don't know
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; we are called to be blessing
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; to it a blessing and to be blessing.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I said.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Sweet water bitter water cannot come
[1:45:40] from the same fountain.
[1:45:42] sir.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And the tongue we use to praise God
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and to bless God, you cannot use it for
[1:45:47] abusive ways.
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Because somebody annoyed you, because
[1:45:57] somebody offend you. So
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; the Bible tells us
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; life and death.
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:06] [Applause]
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; God says what it means and means what he
[1:46:17] says.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; So when you are happy,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; be careful what you say.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; When you are not happy, look at Herodh
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; foolish.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; He was happy drunk
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Anything anybody half of my kingdom I'll
[1:46:36] give to you.
[1:46:40] And when that prostitute girl get
[1:46:42] stripped came and dance,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; ask anything you wish.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; The mother said go and tell him you want
[1:46:49] the head of John the Baptist.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He was embarrassed.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; He wish he has not said that.
[1:46:58] [Applause]
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; What would that man stand on the day of
[1:47:05] judgment? He wish he had not said that.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; So be careful.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; What you say?

[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; jokingly.
[1:47:37] I didn't mean to say
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; but you have said it
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; you said it
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; so saints of God we should not just be
[1:47:48] speaking oh
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; our Lord Jesus one day on earth he was
[1:48:02] hungry too
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus was hungry Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; He was offered
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; a supernatural offer.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You're the son of God. Why are you
[1:48:12] suffering?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; If you are the son of God, command the
[1:48:15] stones
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; to become bread. He was hungry. The
[1:48:20] Bible said he was hungry.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; But he did not just speak
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; or just do it. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Man shall not live by bread
[1:48:34] alone.
[1:48:35] But by every word I proceed out of the
[1:48:37] mouth of God.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And Satan said, "Look, if you follow,
[1:48:42] you worship me, I'll give all things to
[1:48:44] you."
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Get it behind me.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; What shall he profit a man if he get the
[1:48:51] whole word loses?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; What will it profit us?
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Be careful of what you say.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said when the time came
[1:49:06] right
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; for Esau to inherit the blessing.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Let's just read Genesis again to see
[1:49:13] what happened.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes sir.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Genesis
[1:49:29] 27.
[1:49:33] Hallelujah. So Jacob now tells his son I
[1:49:37] Isaac told his children said look I'm
[1:49:39] about to die. Esau quickly go and get me
[1:49:42] something to eat so that I will bless
[1:49:43] you.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Rebecca heard it. Rebecca call Jacob
[1:49:47] said come. Your father said this. So you
[1:49:50] now listen to me.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; listen to me.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; And Isaac, Jacob said, "No, no, mama. I
[1:49:56] can't do this." Said, "Hey, let it be on
[1:49:58] me." Why? She knew what God said.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; The elder shall serve the younger.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Because when she was pregnant, she was
[1:50:06] praying. She was praying. God said,
[1:50:08] "There are two nations
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; in your womb."
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And the elder shall save the younger.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; God told her that
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; that revelation has been with her.
[1:50:19] That's right.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; She kept it in her heart.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And she knew where the blessing is.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, listen. This is God.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; God keeps his word."
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Before they were born,
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; God knew that this one will despite the
[1:50:38] birthright.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; God saw you
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the word
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; that you will believe the message.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; So God ordained you. Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; God choose us
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; to believe this word.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; God knew those who will go back.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; So he will make it make something to
[1:50:58] happen
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; to stumble the people.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; For them to go back
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; when Jesus said except you eat my flesh
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; and drink my blood
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; you have no part in me.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; He spoke to the whole church.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; That's amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And part of them say ah
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; this is too much. This is too much. Now
[1:51:19] we have been hearing a lot of things but
[1:51:20] this one is too much.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Too much.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; How can we eat his flesh
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; and drink his blood?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Already people have been calling false
[1:51:30] prophet. Now look at what he has brought
[1:51:31] again.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; This is becoming too much now.
[1:51:44] and they left. Brother, Jesus didn't
[1:51:47] explain it.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet said Jesus did this. And we
[1:51:50] read in the Bible, he didn't explain it.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Purposely, brother says, "Certain things
[1:51:55] are done."
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Certain things are said
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; purposely to tim down the crowd
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; to cause some people to go back.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Bible days are still here with us.
[1:52:11] I'm telling you
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; may God help us
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; the elect of God nothing will stumble
[1:52:19] there
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; nothing can stumble there then Apostle
[1:52:22] Paul said what's that separate us from
[1:52:25] the love of God tribulations trials this
[1:52:29] whatever but nothing
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; be there when Jesus said will you also
[1:52:35] go
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:52:38] shall we go
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; we don't understand these things.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's it right there.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; We can't go anywhere.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Oh children of the light,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; keep walking in the light.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Keep walking in the light.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Keep walking in the light.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Watch and see more unfold unto you.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; When I was in South Africa talking to
[1:53:07] one of the pastor said, "Brother
[1:53:08] Timothy, the people told us why they
[1:53:10] left the message. They should now come
[1:53:12] and tell us since they left the message,
[1:53:15] what life are they living?"
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:53:19] That's it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Since they left,
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; they should tell us.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Is it brand that put predestination in
[1:53:27] the Bible?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Is it brand that spoke about the cover
[1:53:30] of a woman that is the hair? So today if
[1:53:33] you are cutting your are you doing it
[1:53:34] against William Brown or the Bible?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Is it William Brana that put in the
[1:53:40] Bible that the woman should not put a
[1:53:42] garment that pertains to man
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; that the Bible endorses women to cut
[1:53:47] their hair that the Bible endorsing
[1:53:49] women to paint their faces.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Is it William Brown that put it there?
[1:53:59] They should come and tell us since they
[1:54:01] left the message.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; What has come out of their life?
[1:54:08] [Applause]
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; You put something in the freezer.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; The message preserves.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; The word of God is preserving us.
[1:54:23] when you leave the word
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; because the end time message
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; is to meet end time conditions.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; The message is anointed
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; to meet the challenges of this hour.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; So it's just like you are in the
[1:54:36] refrigerator or the freezer and they
[1:54:39] take it out
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; They take it out.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. After a while,
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; after a while,
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; the ice will begin to go,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; begin to go.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Put your potato or put your okra or put
[1:54:57] your tomatoes in and then take it out.
[1:55:00] After a while, it is the ice is there.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; The ice will soon go
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; and when the ice go,
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; it's useless.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Stay in the light. Stay there. Stay
[1:55:14] there. Stay in the refrigerator. Stay
[1:55:17] with the wife. Hallelujah. Because he's
[1:55:21] making us stronger.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Stronger, brave, and courageous.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; And pressing on.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:55:47] meat or the vanishing.
[1:55:50] Jacob said, Isaac said the voice is
[1:55:52] Jacob voice.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; There was no doubt. He doesn't He said
[1:55:58] the voice I'm hearing is Jacob's voice.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I'm still Is
[1:56:05] today I'm
[1:56:09] Jacob?" Isis, what is happening? It's
[1:56:12] okay. Come, let me feel you.
[1:56:15] He came, he smelly because he was
[1:56:17] wearing Isa dress. Oh, they smell just
[1:56:20] like Esau. Here and there. Here and
[1:56:22] there. The Bible said and he blessed
[1:56:25] him. Immediately Jacob went out. Esau
[1:56:28] was there.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Daddy, I am here." He said,
[1:56:32] "Where is this?" He said, "I'm your
[1:56:34] first boy." Says, "There is trouble.
[1:56:40] Somebody has been here.
[1:56:42] your brother
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; and I've blessed him.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And he's blessed.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; What happened? He was crying. Listen to
[1:56:52] what the Bible said here.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 34.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's read verse 33. Don't worry.
[1:56:59] And Isaac trembled very suddenly
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; and said, "Who, why is he that I've
[1:57:06] taken venison and brought it?
[1:57:10] Me and I have eaten of all before you
[1:57:14] cometh."
[1:57:16] Before you cometh and have and have
[1:57:19] blessed him. Yay.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; And he shall be blessed.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Esau, when Esau heard the
[1:57:29] words of his father, he cried with a
[1:57:33] great and exceededly bitter cry.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Excellently bitter cry.
[1:57:42] And said unto his father, "Bless me,
[1:57:46] even me also, oh my father,"
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; crying, weeping,
[1:57:56] And the Bible said in Hebrews,
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; he cried
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; and he was grouped with fornicator,
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Profane person,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; To despise your birth, right?

[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; That is where Paul put him there.
[1:58:15] Apostle
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; as as a fornicator.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; A profane person.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. for dispersing an imod
[1:58:23] disping what God cherishes.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; They would have considered their life.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:39] He was rejected
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; because he despised the birth.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:49] Oh, I will do it tomorrow. Tomorrow, you
[1:58:51] know what tomorrow holds.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; You know where you'll be tomorrow.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet spoke to about the rich
[1:58:58] young ruler
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; that came to Jesus
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; for eternal life
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; and he was told but the price was too
[1:59:07] much for him.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown said when he left
[1:59:11] Jesus good luck followed him.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. That is
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; since I left the message I am free.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; You a liar.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; You are just deceiving yourself.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You are just like somebody passing
[1:59:24] through the cemetery.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; That
[1:59:30] trying to make yourself that you are not
[1:59:32] afraid. You are lying. You afraid.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you are just fooling
[1:59:37] yourself.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Good luck followed him.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; He had more businesses.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He had this. He had that. He had this.
[1:59:54] He had that. So much.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not free.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; You think you think you are free? Wait.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; The end is coming.
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise. They would have
[2:00:09] considered a letter.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Good lord. He had so much. He had so
[2:00:12] much. And he said, "Okay, I'll break
[2:00:14] this. I'll this. I'll buy this. I'll buy
[2:00:17] and there." And said, "Thou fool.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Tonight your soul will be taken out of
[2:00:21] your hand."
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; It was that rich man that had so much
[2:00:24] and poor Lazarus what has his gate.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Desiring to take even the crumbs.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't care about that.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; But the picture change.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Lazarus died. Uh-huh.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; He also died.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And then that man in hell,
[2:00:50] the picture has changed. You saw Lazarus
[2:00:52] there
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; with father Abraham,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; the bos walking all on the streets of
[2:00:58] glory.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day it will be when our Jesus
[2:01:03] we shall see.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; When he takes us by the hand
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and lead us through that promised land.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day that will be. Consider
[2:01:12] the latter end.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; The end will be glorious.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Our end is glorious.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Eyes have not seen, ears have not heard.
[2:01:21] The heart of man has not conceived what
[2:01:23] God has reserved for us.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Y people never be discouraged.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, some of you, your parents are
[2:01:33] here.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; You can see your parents how far God has
[2:01:36] brought them.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; You can see your parents,
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; right? How God has brought us
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; where he took us from
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; and he has brought us here.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; What are you afraid for?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; What are you afraid of?
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Why can't you take your stand?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Why can't you take a stand
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; with the word of the Lord?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; What are you compromising for?
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Consider the latter end.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; For the end of a thing is better than
[2:02:05] the beginning. Listen
[2:02:09] s we've gone through many things
[2:02:14] many trials
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; right
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; oh when we were young people they were
[2:02:17] laughing at us they were calling us
[2:02:20] names
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; crazy people here and there
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; today they know better
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; they know better
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; that we are white people
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; yes
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; listen young people don't be afraid
[2:02:36] David said, "I was young, now I am old."
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; I've never seen the righteous forsaken,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; nor the seed of the righteous begging
[2:02:43] for bread.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Take your stand.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, saints of God,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; that have come this far.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, the reward is at the end.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; He said when you are doing something for
[2:02:55] Jesus, he will wait.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; He will wait. Like the woman at the
[2:02:59] word, I mean the prostitute that wash
[2:03:00] his feet,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; just keep washing. Jesus didn't say
[2:03:04] nothing but the reward came at the end.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; You are blessed.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; He was blessed and sins were forgiven.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, the reward comes at the end.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; So don't give up.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That rich young man said, "Oh, father
[2:03:22] Abraham, I have brothers there. Let
[2:03:24] somebody if somebody go from the dead,
[2:03:26] he said if somebody go from there, they
[2:03:28] will not believe it." Uh-huh.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; How would they believe if they He said,
[2:03:34] you know what they told him? They said,
[2:03:36] Timothy is there.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Steven is there.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; John is there.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; The preachers are there.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; The five-fold is there.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; My servants are preaching.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; If they will not hear the five-fold
[2:03:48] preachers,
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; even if an angel come from the dead,
[2:03:51] they will not believe.
[2:03:53] [Applause]
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Now you know I'm
[2:04:00] crazy. That's fine.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; All that you were wise.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; All that we are wise people, wise
[2:04:09] children, take your stand with the word
[2:04:11] of the Lord.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; No going back, no turning back.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; He spoke to us about Moses.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible told us those people Heroes of
[2:04:29] faith.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; He said they were beaten. They were they
[2:04:34] were saw a sander.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; They were scoffed.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; They were mocked.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; But they refused deliverance
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; that they might obtain a better
[2:04:44] resurrection.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; They were not ashamed. And the Bible
[2:04:49] say, "And God is not ashamed to be
[2:04:51] called their God."
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; God is not ashamed. He said, "These are
[2:04:57] my people.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, my brothers and my sisters,
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; consider the end,
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; the latter end."

[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever we are going through today,
[2:05:09] Apostle Apostle, the suffering
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; of this present time can never be
[2:05:14] compared
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; with the glory
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; that shall be revealed in us
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; at the coming of the Lord.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Dear ones, may God be with us. May the
[2:05:24] Lord strengthen you young people and all
[2:05:26] together my brothers and my sisters
[2:05:29] don't give up. Consider the end.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; The story will change at the end.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; The crown when the battle is over. We
[2:05:36] shall wear that crown.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; We shall wear that crown.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; He will say to us, come.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.

[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; brother, the prophecy
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; over William Brana because I has chosen
[2:06:19] the narrow path. Ah,

[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; It is my way.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Thou has walk in thy own choosing. You
[2:06:43] pick the correct and the precise
[2:06:45] decision.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; You've walking. He said that is my way.
[2:06:50] Hallelujah.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; And because of this momentous decision,
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; a huge portion
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; of heaven awaits you.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; A huge portion of heaven awaits
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; my brothers and my sisters.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, that you were wise.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Consider that time. Hallelujah.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I will be
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; with the gift that God gave me."
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "I had the word at my fingertip
[2:07:24] like,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; but I choose to remain poor."
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; God told you, you are my portion. I'm
[2:07:31] your portion.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; I am your portion.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; A huge portion of every
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; dear ones, you receive the prophet
[2:07:43] reward. Hallelujah.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Consider the latter end.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Not just to satisfy the flesh.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Like Isa,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; just to satisfy the flesh.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. For pleasures and for this and for
[2:08:00] that.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't satisfy the flesh
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; because the flesh will
[2:08:07] right.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Our spiritual are telling them, listen,
[2:08:10] if you want to paint your leaf, paint
[2:08:11] it. Don't use something white so that
[2:08:14] camouflage. No, paint it so that we see
[2:08:16] your your lips are red. We'll know how
[2:08:18] to pray for you.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; If you want to
[2:08:24] just say hypocritical things here and
[2:08:26] there so that people will not see it, do
[2:08:28] it where so that we know how to pray for
[2:08:30] you.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; If you want to satisfy your flesh, just
[2:08:34] go ahead so that when you are kicked
[2:08:36] out, you know you satisfy your flesh and
[2:08:39] you are kicked out. But for us, we are
[2:08:42] taking the way of the Lord's despised
[2:08:45] field.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision that has made.
[2:08:51] And because of this decision, a huge
[2:08:53] portion of heaven awaits you. God bless
[2:08:57] you. God be with us.
[2:09:01] [Applause]
[2:09:10] Glory. Glory.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord tonight?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big clap of
[2:09:31] Amen.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; This is a mother of life and death.
[2:09:36] Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't waver. We don't play
[2:09:39] game.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; If we need to stay few people like this,
[2:09:46] we will. But stay with the word of God.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Because I don't want to be called a
[2:09:51] hypocrite preacher.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Because when you look far away at the
[2:09:56] end.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; We want all of us. We don't want anybody
[2:10:00] to stay out. We want our children, our
[2:10:02] wives, our family, we all want to make
[2:10:05] it.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Check your choice.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Stand for what is right.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Satan have multiply all type of stuff,
[2:10:17] especially with technology and
[2:10:19] everything to make you look like you're
[2:10:21] not really enjoying life.
[2:10:24] What is the definition of enjoying life?
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was talking to my wife. I said
[2:10:31] there are many things that have been put
[2:10:33] in people's head for years and we begin
[2:10:37] to consider that to be the norm of life.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; While the word of God, the word of God
[2:10:42] is teaching us completely different.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; So when you come to church and the word
[2:10:47] is coming, the word of God is actually
[2:10:49] re reocus you back,
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; removing your definition of what life
[2:10:54] was
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; and make you understand what really life
[2:10:58] is. Yes.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; If you want to know what life is, go
[2:11:01] listen to the message. Brother Brandham
[2:11:02] preach the message life.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham begin to describe
[2:11:06] different type of life
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; and show you life.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; What what type of life do you want? You
[2:11:13] don't want to go to church.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Look how we enjoying being in church.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; You can't even wait for Sunday.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; You want to be in church on Sunday
[2:11:22] again.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; What life do you want again?
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; We talked to our children one time. We
[2:11:28] say our life is mingle with our faith.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, everything we do is
[2:11:36] mingle with our faith.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's why whenever we want to do
[2:11:41] something, what did brother Brandham
[2:11:42] says about this?
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; What did brother Brandham says about
[2:11:45] this? If I'm going somewhere, okay, am I
[2:11:47] going to be in church that day? Am I
[2:11:49] going to do this? Am I? So everything is
[2:11:52] just church, church, church. But the
[2:11:54] devil want to show you that all the
[2:11:56] time. Church, church, church, church.
[2:11:57] You're missing something.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; What are you missing?
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; The people out there are under
[2:12:04] depression.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a medical professional. You see what
[2:12:09] type of medication people are under?
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. Amen.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; You don't know. People are desiring.
[2:12:15] They are searching to find a life just
[2:12:17] the way you are.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; A life where even if they don't have
[2:12:21] money, they don't have anything. But the
[2:12:23] mind is at peace. Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; People have money but their mind are not
[2:12:28] in peace.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; They have money, they have a lot of
[2:12:31] trouble, a lot of depression, going
[2:12:33] through a lot of problem. Just have a
[2:12:34] safe, peaceful mind that you can go, I
[2:12:37] mean jump on your bed and sleep
[2:12:39] peacefully and wake up in the morning
[2:12:41] and refresh.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Blessing is not whoopee. No. The people
[2:12:50] that did that and that were converted to
[2:12:53] Christ, if you ask them, they would tell
[2:12:54] you, "We don't want to go back to them.
[2:12:57] We don't want to go back to them." There
[2:12:58] is a reason why they telling you, "We
[2:13:00] don't want to go back to them."
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And the devil keep telling you, "No, you
[2:13:03] missing something." Watch the definition
[2:13:05] of life.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Watch the definition of pleasure.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Consider the end.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Consider where you heading. Amen. And
[2:13:16] you would know what the Lord want you to
[2:13:18] do. This quote has been held for a while
[2:13:22] and suddenly he popped it up. Whatever
[2:13:24] you do the decision you are here the
[2:13:28] decision you made. I have all those
[2:13:30] things and it keep hell. So I found out
[2:13:32] the signal came tonight like okay now
[2:13:35] it's time to dive into it.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you do right now watch
[2:13:41] your tomorrow.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; It will be impossible for somebody to
[2:13:48] see you doing wrong and they don't want
[2:13:50] to tell you.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; If you find out,
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; stay away from that person.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Get away from that person. That's a
[2:13:57] person that will kill you.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; If you find somebody who is unable to
[2:14:01] tell you the truth and want to
[2:14:04] compromise to please you, that's not a
[2:14:06] friend.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's a killer rad.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's not a friend. The way the world
[2:14:13] is describing, he say, "Okay, this is my
[2:14:15] body. I got your back." No, the one that
[2:14:17] really got your back is the one that
[2:14:19] would look at you straight to the face
[2:14:21] and say, "We can part, we can separate,
[2:14:24] we can end our fellowship, but I'm going
[2:14:26] to tell you what you're trying to do is
[2:14:28] wrong.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; That is the true friend.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; That is a true husband.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; That is a true wife. That is a true
[2:14:36] mother and father.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; That is a true a true a true body.
[2:14:41] That's the one that you want to stick
[2:14:42] with. Amen. But somebody who let you do
[2:14:45] everything.
[2:14:47] [Applause]
[2:14:49] If you come to me,
[2:14:52] I'm going to let you go home and you
[2:14:54] look at and you say, "I'm coming to a
[2:14:56] dentist and I look at your teeth and I
[2:14:59] see infection
[2:15:01] and to please you."
[2:15:04] I say, "No, I went to Dr. So and so and
[2:15:08] they say this, this, this." and I say
[2:15:09] okay everything looking good and you say
[2:15:11] well are you the best doctor ever it's
[2:15:15] just a matter of time
[2:15:18] after five or 6 month if your face begin
[2:15:21] to swell
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; what are you going to call me
[2:15:26] you call me a witch or a crook or
[2:15:29] whatever whatever you going to come up
[2:15:31] and and you ready to put a bad review
[2:15:33] quickly
[2:15:36] why because I failed to tell you the
[2:15:38] truth truth, but we were trained to tell
[2:15:40] you the truth.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; So regardless of whether it's going to
[2:15:44] please you or not, I must make sure when
[2:15:46] I go home, even if you go, I have
[2:15:49] somebody 10 years left. 10 years if I'm
[2:15:52] not mistaken, and went away. Just told
[2:15:54] the person, you need to do this, this,
[2:15:55] this, this, this, this, and say it's
[2:15:57] going to cost you, I don't know if it
[2:15:59] was at that time. It was like $5,000.
[2:16:02] The person said no. Ran away,
[2:16:04] disappeared. No problem. The person came
[2:16:06] after seven or 10 years.
[2:16:11] Total loss to my friend
[2:16:14] after spending the maybe the double of
[2:16:17] what I was trying to do. They went they
[2:16:19] did.
[2:16:21] I was not even trying to do they did
[2:16:24] and she paid for it and she came back
[2:16:26] and I look I said look what I told you
[2:16:28] look where you are and she have to pay
[2:16:30] again
[2:16:33] more than even what I said. And she was
[2:16:35] ready to pay for it now. How much money
[2:16:38] did she spend over there and coming back
[2:16:41] and spending back? I have her picture
[2:16:43] before and after. She said, "Now I look
[2:16:45] at she said never." She she saw no more.
[2:16:50] How much damage? Why? I didn't know that
[2:16:54] person will come back. But because I
[2:16:55] said what was right
[2:16:58] after years comes right back again with
[2:17:01] a lot of damage. Amen. We have to tell
[2:17:05] you what the message say and what the
[2:17:08] Bible says regardless
[2:17:11] because at the end this message has been
[2:17:14] vindicated.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible is always been vindicated.
[2:17:18] Make your choice based on the word of
[2:17:20] God.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Stick with the word no matter how hard
[2:17:23] it is.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; That is the way life is. At the end, God
[2:17:29] will back you up. God will be there for
[2:17:31] you. God will stand for you. And God
[2:17:34] will give you the best and you will be
[2:17:36] an example to other young people all
[2:17:39] over this world here to say the children
[2:17:42] the young people we saw there we saw
[2:17:45] them when we were laughing at them when
[2:17:47] we were telling them you guys are all
[2:17:49] the way in the word the word every time
[2:17:51] we want to talk it's just brother
[2:17:52] Brandham say brother Brandham say but
[2:17:54] truly they are watching you when they
[2:17:56] begin to see things begin to go
[2:17:58] differently they say you know what we've
[2:18:00] been criticizing them too much but they
[2:18:02] got the real
[2:18:03] Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Stick with the word. God will vindicate
[2:18:07] you. I told brother set I say it's a
[2:18:08] matter of time and you will see what God
[2:18:10] will do to his people in this church
[2:18:13] right here.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; There's a time for everything.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; There's a time for training the time to
[2:18:19] go and there will be a time for
[2:18:20] blessing. And when God bless, don't tell
[2:18:23] him to stop
[2:18:24] [Laughter]
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; because his cup when he pour the cup
[2:18:29] must overflow
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; because that is the God of Abraham. But
[2:18:33] stand ready. God will meet you at the
[2:18:37] appointed time.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tim. God bless you.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:18:47] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:18:50] are approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:18:53] Father, we thank you for your grace, for
[2:18:56] your love and your mercy, and for
[2:18:58] speaking to our soul tonight, Lord.
[2:19:01] Father, certainly there must be somebody
[2:19:05] struggling
[2:19:06] that have not taken decision or make a
[2:19:09] decision yet to where they are standing,
[2:19:14] Father. And the devil has been taking
[2:19:16] advantage of that ify position for years
[2:19:19] to trouble their life, Lord. But Lord,
[2:19:22] tonight you are speaking to us about the
[2:19:26] choices.
[2:19:27] And you want your children to make the
[2:19:29] right choice
[2:19:31] so that they can build their house on a
[2:19:33] solid foundation
[2:19:35] because one of this day trial will come,
[2:19:40] trouble will come, temptation will come
[2:19:43] and everything that we have been labor
[2:19:45] on will be tried where the world we were
[2:19:49] here and doers or we were just here and
[2:19:53] not doers of the word. But Lord Father,
[2:19:56] I pray Lord Father that a special grace
[2:19:59] be granted because your word came
[2:20:01] tonight Lord. He came to convict, to
[2:20:05] change and to bring grace to the one
[2:20:08] that is struggling, the one that is just
[2:20:10] about to stray away so that they can
[2:20:12] recover and come back in line. Lord,
[2:20:15] Father, may that grace touch and prick
[2:20:17] the heart of your children and bring
[2:20:19] them back again, Lord. Father to the
[2:20:22] point that they will consider the
[2:20:24] birthright which is everything Lord
[2:20:27] Father that we need in this life
[2:20:29] journey. Lord I pray that you strengthen
[2:20:31] brother Tim and you protect the church
[2:20:34] Lord. Father we are committing the
[2:20:37] building project unto our hand Lord.
[2:20:39] Father, we know that everything is under
[2:20:42] your provision and every single step of
[2:20:44] the way. We see you every single day
[2:20:48] working in a miraculous way and moving
[2:20:50] with us beyond even what we thought and
[2:20:53] the way we planned. But Lord, Father, at
[2:20:55] the end of the day, we consider the
[2:20:58] latter hand and we know that it's going
[2:21:00] to be good. Father, we pray Lord that
[2:21:02] you give us travel mercy as we going
[2:21:05] back to our respective place. May you
[2:21:07] keep us centered and consecrated around
[2:21:10] the revealed word of the hour. So that
[2:21:12] if Tom Terry and Lord Father before you
[2:21:15] come may we meet again and fellowship
[2:21:17] around the things of the kingdom. Bless
[2:21:19] your children Lord Father. Touch those
[2:21:22] that need a special touch tonight. Lord
[2:21:24] may you grant it unto them and bless us
[2:21:27] in Jesus precious name. Amen. Go ahead.
[2:21:32] I want God's will
[2:21:36] to be my way as a journey
[2:21:42] below
[2:21:45] for the resto. Though
[2:21:49] the highway
[2:21:51] that a child
[2:21:55] should go
[2:21:57] through the road is steep and rough.
[2:22:04] If he leads me
[2:22:07] enough,
[2:22:09] I want God's way to be my way every day.
[2:22:19] Oh,
[2:22:21] I want God's way to be my way as a
[2:22:28] journey
[2:22:31] below.
[2:22:33] For there is no
[2:22:37] highway
[2:22:39] that I shall
[2:22:41] [Music]
[2:22:43] go.
[2:22:45] Though the road is deep and rough,
[2:22:51] if it leads me, it's enough.
[2:22:57] I want God's way to be my way every day.
[2:23:06] Oh,
[2:23:08] I want God's way to be my way. as a
[2:23:15] journey
[2:23:18] below.
[2:23:20] For there is no
[2:23:24] highway
[2:23:26] that a child
[2:23:29] should go
