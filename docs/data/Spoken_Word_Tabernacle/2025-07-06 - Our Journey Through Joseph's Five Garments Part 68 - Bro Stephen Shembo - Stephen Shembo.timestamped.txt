[0:10] about
[0:28] the rest of
[5:44] Oh, draw
[5:48] me,
[5:50] Lord.
[5:54] Oh, draw
[5:57] me
[5:59] home.
[6:03] Oh, draw
[6:06] me
[6:09] home
[6:12] and I'll run
[6:17] after you.
[6:21] Oh glory.
[6:30] Oh glory.
[6:39] Oh, draw
[6:42] me
[6:47] and I'll run
[6:51] after you.
[6:56] Oh,
[7:01] Lord.
[7:04] Oh glory.
[7:10] Oh.
[7:13] Oh God,
[7:22] and I
[7:28] you
[7:32] Lord, we thank you for that pull once
[7:34] again, Lord God, that you've drawn us
[7:37] into your house this morning, Lord God.
[7:40] that you've drawn us into your presence,
[7:43] Lord Jesus.
[7:45] We thank you, Father, for this wonderful
[7:47] little place that we can meet you, Lord
[7:49] God. We thank you for everything that
[7:52] you're doing in our lives, Lord God,
[7:55] each day and everything you're doing for
[7:57] us here, Lord God, revealing yourself to
[8:00] us more and more as we gather together,
[8:02] Lord, in the fellowship of the Holy
[8:05] Spirit. Lord, we thank you. And Lord, we
[8:08] want to just make a big deal out of
[8:10] today, Lord God, because we get to be
[8:12] with you, Lord God, this morning and
[8:14] this afternoon, Lord. And we just want
[8:16] to just want to welcome you in, Lord
[8:18] God. And just ask that you take a seat
[8:20] right beside us on the pew this morning,
[8:22] Lord God. We want you up here on the
[8:25] platform in the holiest of holies, Lord.
[8:27] And we want you in our hearts, Lord God.
[8:29] We want you on the stream, Lord God,
[8:32] that those watching, Lord, may receive
[8:34] the same anointing, Lord God, and the
[8:36] same presence that we have here, Lord
[8:39] God.
[8:40] We want to ask also, Lord, that you
[8:42] bless our precious musicians, Lord
[8:44] Jesus. Sometimes, Lord, it sounds like
[8:47] the angels are joining in, Lord God,
[8:49] with heavenly instruments. It's just
[8:51] more than what's on the platform, Lord.
[8:53] The same with the voices as we lift our
[8:56] voices to heaven, Lord. There's more
[8:58] here, Lord, than we can see, Lord God.
[9:01] And we can hear them. We can hear them,
[9:03] Lord. And we just ask, Lord God, we know
[9:07] they're encamped about us, Lord. Let
[9:09] them rejoice that we're gathering as
[9:11] well
[9:13] as people, Lord, as children of God,
[9:17] as sons of God and daughters of God.
[9:21] May you have your perfect will with
[9:23] everything that is said and done today,
[9:25] Lord God, and everything that
[9:27] transpires, Lord. Go to that front room
[9:30] once again, Lord, as I ask each Sunday,
[9:33] and touch our pastor, Lord. We know,
[9:37] Lord, we know the gift that you have
[9:40] sent us, Lord God. We know that it's not
[9:43] just a man when he comes out,
[9:46] and we want to give you the glory, Lord.
[9:49] So let him move himself out of the way,
[9:51] Lord, that you may speak once again this
[9:54] morning. Lord, do the same for all of
[9:56] us, Lord, as musicians and singers,
[9:59] Lord, even as the congregation, Lord,
[10:02] this very special people that has
[10:05] gathered in your name, Lord God, and the
[10:08] diligence, Lord, in our hearts to not
[10:11] let anything stop us from meeting when
[10:13] those doors are open, Lord God. We thank
[10:16] you, Father.
[10:18] You are a faithful God to us, Lord
[10:21] Jesus.
[10:22] So, how could we be anything less back
[10:26] to you. So, we thank you, Father. We
[10:29] give this service to you and everything
[10:30] about it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[10:33] Amen. And amen. And amen. Let's give the
[10:36] Lord a clap offering this morning. Amen.
[10:39] Turn around and greet your neighbor. And
[10:41] we're together again. Amen. We had a
[10:44] wonderful time Saturday.
[10:46] I will go ahead and say as y'all are
[10:49] greeting each other that
[10:52] Well, I'll wait. I'll wait.
[11:35] Well, in a manger long ago.
[11:38] I know it's really so. A babe was born
[11:42] to save men from their sin.
[11:46] John saw him on the shore, the lamb
[11:50] forever more. Oh, Christ crucified of
[11:54] Calvary.
[11:56] Oh yes, I love that man from Galilee.
[12:00] From Galilee.
[12:02] He's done so very much for me.
[12:07] He's forgiven all my sin. Place the Holy
[12:11] Ghost with him. Oh, I love my love that
[12:14] man from Galilee.
[12:19] Went to pray in the temple there one
[12:22] day. He cried, "Oh Lord, be merciful to
[12:26] me."
[12:28] For he was given of every sin and he
[12:32] grace within. He said, "Come see this
[12:36] man from Galilee.
[12:39] For I love that man from Galilee,
[12:43] Galilee. For he's done so very much for
[12:48] me.
[12:50] He's forgiving all my sins. The Holy
[12:54] Ghost.
[12:55] Oh, I love that man from Galilee.
[13:01] The lame was made to walk. The down were
[13:05] made to talk. That power was spoken with
[13:08] love upon the sea.
[13:12] The wine were made to see. And I know it
[13:15] can only be the mercy of that man from
[13:20] Galilee.
[13:22] Oh, I love that man from Galilee. From
[13:26] Galilee. For he died so very much for
[13:31] me.
[13:33] He's forgiven all my sins where the Holy
[13:37] Ghost.
[13:38] Oh, I love that man from Gile.
[13:44] Nicodemus came by night to know the way
[13:48] I'm right. He asked the son of man,
[13:51] "What must he do?"
[13:55] his word. He said to him, "You must be
[13:59] born again by the spirit of that man
[14:02] from Galilee."
[14:05] Oh my love that man from Galilee. From
[14:09] Galilee, for he's done so very much for
[14:14] me.
[14:16] He's forgiven all my sins.
[14:24] from Galilee.
[14:27] The woman at the well
[14:30] her sins detail and our five husbands
[14:34] she had at that time.
[14:37] She was forgiven of every sin and each
[14:41] peace came within. Then she cried, "Come
[14:44] see that man from Galilee."
[14:48] Oh, I love that man from Galilee. From
[14:52] Galilee. For he's done so very much for
[14:57] me.
[14:59] He's forgiven all my sins. There's a
[15:03] Holy Ghost with him. For I love that man
[15:07] from Galilee.
[15:10] I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[15:13] everything to me. He's the fairest
[15:17] mountain to my soul.
[15:21] The holy way of the valley. In him alone

[16:01] and mighty God.
[16:04] I have all for him forsaken and all my
[16:08] eyesore from my heart. And now he keeps
[16:12] me by his side.

[18:07] Amen.
[18:10] We love that man from Galilee.
[18:15] It's been a little while since we sang
[18:17] this this next song. I've asked brother
[18:19] Tony if he doesn't mind coming up and
[18:22] helping out a little bit,
[18:25] but we got to sing it. All of us do
[18:27] anyhow.
[18:30] Amen.
[18:32] So, as he makes his way up,
[18:37] praise God.
[18:53] Glory to God.

[19:09] and he answered me
[19:12] and delivered me

[24:52] your seats for just a minute. I do have
[24:55] uh some things to read and we have two
[24:57] testimonies this morning and then we
[25:00] have two specials.
[25:03] So, I don't know where to start. Um
[25:06] I'm going to start with the one that I
[25:08] that I wrote down this morning as a
[25:10] praise report. I wanted to um not only
[25:14] personally but I guess for my family in
[25:16] the church. Um, thank the FBI
[25:19] for opening up their home for the fun
[25:22] day this year and the birthdays. Amen.
[25:26] And for the fellowship and uh giving us
[25:29] an opportunity also to um get to know
[25:32] brother blessing and brother Phillip a
[25:34] little bit better.
[25:36] We had such a wonderful time. It was
[25:39] truly a blessing just the fellowship all
[25:41] around. And we just we just want to
[25:43] thank you very much for all the hard
[25:44] work and the sacrifice.
[25:47] Amen.
[25:50] Praise God. Praise God.
[25:53] Now, Sister Lorel wrote something also.
[25:56] Um she said she would like to thank all
[25:58] the saints for the birthday wishes and
[26:00] the lovely fellowship on Friday. She
[26:03] says, "May God bless you always."
[26:06] Um may God always bless you with a full
[26:09] measure. pressed down and running over.
[26:13] Amen. And that's that's from Luke. Amen.
[26:15] Luke 6. She said, "Love you dearly."
[26:20] Amen.
[26:21] And she also um wants to welcome her
[26:24] friend Cherylyn. She came all the way
[26:27] from Trinidad for Sister Lurel's
[26:29] birthday. Was there she's been here for
[26:31] a little while and uh and uh we enjoyed
[26:34] getting to meet her and we just want to
[26:36] make her feel welcome here at Spoken
[26:38] Word as well. Amen. Praise God.
[26:44] Sister Lurel said, "We used to be the
[26:46] young people in our church back home,
[26:47] the youth." So, you see where it goes.
[26:50] It goes to many blessings to a lot of
[26:53] people. Amen. Praise God. Amen. So, I
[26:57] have one prayer request that was written
[27:00] down.
[27:01] Actually, two. Um Chris and Rebecca are
[27:04] traveling back from Tennessee today. um
[27:06] after, you know, the pretty difficult
[27:08] week that they've gone through. We've
[27:09] spoken with them several times and uh so
[27:12] um we just want to ask for traveling
[27:14] mercy there. And uh this one was kind of
[27:17] for me, you know, there was um
[27:21] there was a flood in Texas. Uh it was
[27:24] kind of a flash thing. It sounded very
[27:26] similar to what we experienced in our
[27:28] mountains here. Um but this affected a
[27:32] uh Christian youth camp and it wiped out
[27:35] uh the whole camp and they're still
[27:37] they're still recovering um children
[27:40] mostly girls. So we want to u plus you
[27:44] know we we've heard stories of people
[27:46] who lived in in RVs on the river banks
[27:49] and they were destroyed or carried away
[27:50] the cars and everything everything that
[27:53] they owned. So, they're suffering over
[27:55] there. And I don't know if I don't know
[27:56] if any believers were affected as far as
[27:58] message believers, but um you know, we
[28:01] just want to um ask for mercy from God
[28:04] um for the families of the flood victims
[28:08] this morning. So, I just thought it
[28:09] would be appropriate to um to bring that
[28:12] up if we could stand. Amen.
[28:16] Brother Michael Omach, do you mind
[28:18] coming up and praying over these things
[28:20] this morning, sir?
[28:24] remember each other as well. Amen. I'm
[28:27] sure we could go to everybody in here
[28:28] and they could say, "Man, I'm going
[28:30] through something or I'm happy about
[28:32] something." We just want to love each
[28:34] other. Amen. With everything that's in
[28:36] us. Thank you, Lord. God bless you. We
[28:39] are thankful for the Lord to allow us to
[28:40] come to his house this morning. I think
[28:43] all of us we are ready. All right. Yeah.
[28:46] So, let him feel welcome. Let us pray.
[28:49] Father, we come before you as your
[28:52] children. What opportunity to come to
[28:54] meet you in this house where we come
[28:56] every day to magnify and to lift your
[28:59] name up, oh father, to glorify you, to
[29:02] show you that we love you, Father,
[29:04] because you first loved us, Father, and
[29:07] you died for us, oh God. Thank you,
[29:10] Lord, for the sweet spirit that is
[29:11] already here, Father. Oh God, how we
[29:15] thank you Lord for this little group
[29:17] that you have set aside. Oh God, I look
[29:20] forward one of these days. Oh father,
[29:22] we'll say the the camp for the group
[29:25] from Gastonia. Oh Lord, and we'll see.
[29:28] Hallelujah. Our first Oh God, there

[30:12] said you'll be in us and with us,

[30:17] troubles that we have in this world. But
[30:20] your promise is that you'll be with us.

[30:58] your children. Bless the tithes and
[31:01] offerings, Father. May you bless them
[31:04] father that they may be used for the

[31:24] father. We love you and we bless you
[31:26] father. In Jesus name we pray. Thank
[31:29] you.
[31:34] Y'all can be seated. Sister Zatty has a
[31:37] quick testimony she'd like to give and
[31:38] then brother Seth has one as well this
[31:40] morning and we're excited to hear those
[31:42] here. Um God bless you saints. Um I just
[31:46] felt led to share this very small
[31:48] testimony. Um the other day I was um
[31:50] trying to get on one of my accounts so
[31:52] that I can do what I do which is driving
[31:54] sometimes. Um and I was having very a
[31:56] hard time doing so. Um it was like
[31:59] locked for some reason. and it wanted me
[32:00] to take a verification photo. Um, and so
[32:03] I was trying to do everything I could to
[32:04] do it, but what was wrong is my phone
[32:06] memory was full. And so I was very
[32:08] frustrated cuz I have a quota that I try
[32:10] to reach every week. And as soon as um I
[32:14] looked at it, I was I was not able to
[32:16] get through. And so uh something came to
[32:19] me was like this is such a small matter.
[32:21] Why can't you pray about it? It was just
[32:23] talking about the simplicity of like
[32:24] what we say we believe in, but we can't
[32:26] even, you know, take the time just to
[32:27] ask God for something so simple because
[32:29] we think it's minute, but he cares about
[32:31] all things. And so, um, I quickly just
[32:34] bowed my head and I was like, "Lord, you
[32:36] know, my situation at this very moment,
[32:38] you know, I need to be able to get on
[32:40] this account so I can do what I need to
[32:41] do." And it wasn't even um, less than 10
[32:45] minutes. I turned the phone off. I
[32:46] turned it back on and and I really was
[32:48] believing. I said, "I I know it's going
[32:50] to go through this time because it's
[32:51] like he he he's going to answer me." And
[32:54] um I turned the phone back on. I went to
[32:55] the app and it immediately turned back
[32:57] on. I was able to do what I needed to do
[32:58] and finish my quota. So, I just told the
[33:00] Lord, I said, "I'm going to give a
[33:01] praise report because he's faithful."
[33:11] Amen. Our God is faithful. Amen. Amen. I
[33:14] just wanted uh to give this praise
[33:17] report a testimony. Man, I know many of
[33:20] us might have even forgotten what
[33:22] happened two years ago, but um just
[33:26] thinking about it, it's been 2 years
[33:29] since my wife had a kidney transplant,
[33:32] right? And it has been a testimony to my
[33:35] family and the whole church. We just
[33:38] want to bless the name of the Lord for
[33:40] all what he's been doing. Amen. It's
[33:46] Amen. Um we we went to see the we had a
[33:50] doctor's appointment that was last um
[33:53] Tuesday.
[33:55] Last Thursday. Yes. And and then one
[33:58] thing that um she said was that
[34:02] the the the major issue they deal with
[34:05] with transplant patient is with um their
[34:08] hemoglobin. Right. So that's something
[34:10] that they constantly deal with when
[34:13] anybody gets um um done with a
[34:16] transplant. But then right from day one,
[34:19] her hemoglobin hit the right spot. And
[34:23] since then, it has never changed. They
[34:26] never had to deal with that issue. So
[34:29] it's it's just a testimony. We just want
[34:31] to give to the name of the Lord. Amen.
[34:35] Amen. And and one other thing that uh I
[34:39] would want to say uh my wife gave a
[34:41] testimony some time back and then a
[34:43] brother came to me and said that we are
[34:46] sealing that with this token. I just
[34:49] want to thank the Lord for brothers and
[34:51] sisters who believe who believe in
[34:54] confessing before whatever we expecting
[34:57] happens. Amen. And I know the Lord is
[34:59] preparing for us to receive that token.
[35:02] Amen. And God bless you. Amen.
[35:09] Amen. Amen.
[35:13] Now, if you if you if you think you have
[35:16] a problem, just think about sister
[35:18] coach. She has been a very blessed lady
[35:21] and just a blessing to all of us as
[35:23] well.
[35:25] I didn't give this testimony last Sunday
[35:28] and I couldn't leave today. The Lord
[35:30] brought it back. But the day of my
[35:33] birthday, Brother Robert was out with
[35:35] the tractor, big tractor, big wheels,
[35:37] and he was moving a log. I was sitting
[35:39] outside and the Lord said, "Do not go
[35:41] inside. Stay there." And I'm watching
[35:43] him with the chainsaw and he's cutting
[35:45] up the the log from the tree that fell.
[35:47] I'm going to go inside again. He said,
[35:49] "Do not go inside. You sit right there."
[35:52] Hada came outside. She said, "What are
[35:54] you doing here?" I said, "Well, the Lord
[35:55] told me to sit here. I'm watching Robert
[35:56] with that chainsaw, but he's just
[35:58] telling me don't leave." She said,
[36:00] "Okay, mom." She didn't finish say that.
[36:02] I heard Laurel.
[36:04] Hear that? And I heard it again. Laurel,
[36:07] she took off running. I'm thinking it's
[36:09] the chainsaw. She got there behind
[36:12] before me. So, she's there trying to
[36:14] push this tractor. It had a little
[36:16] incline to go up and she couldn't get
[36:17] the the tractor to move. I don't know
[36:20] where the string came from. I got there,
[36:22] but the rubber foot was pinned. You know
[36:24] there is a a part at the back that you
[36:27] can add attachments to and that's the
[36:30] slipped and pinned his foot and his foot
[36:32] was under this metal and the tractor is
[36:35] running and it's the brake is on and
[36:38] when I saw it I don't know what happened
[36:39] saints the Lord just give me a strength
[36:42] I went behind that wheel and there's a
[36:44] little incline and the Lord give me the
[36:45] strength to push the tractor off and the
[36:48] tractor moved and went up the hill and
[36:50] we were just thanking the Lord and we
[36:53] looked
[37:02] We looked at his foot and you can see
[37:04] the imprint from the metal resting on
[37:07] it. He got no broken bones. He got no
[37:10] fracture. He got nothing. His foot, his
[37:13] foot swollen a little bit, but the next
[37:15] day it went down. He's walking normal.
[37:17] And I just want to thank God for the
[37:19] word we've been getting with obedience
[37:21] to listen to God. Thank you, Jesus.
[37:26] Amen.
[37:28] Hallelujah.
[37:33] We're going to ask brother Tmaine to
[37:34] come up this morning and sing. He has a
[37:36] special on his heart. Amen. And then we
[37:39] have the sisters going to sing as well.
[37:41] Praise God.
[37:48] God bless you, saints.

[42:54] Quick testimony.
[42:57] I had a short testimony and um just want
[43:00] to let you know that all last week it's
[43:03] been it was a rough week. Satan was
[43:05] coming at me at the job and and I even
[43:08] had a lady ask me, "What kind of
[43:10] Christian are you?" And I said, "I'm a
[43:12] Christian that believes in Jesus
[43:14] Christ." Because I have testimonies and
[43:16] testimonies on testimonies. But this
[43:19] week, for some reason, I couldn't I
[43:22] couldn't even get out of my room. Friday
[43:24] and Saturday, I couldn't move. Body was
[43:27] hurting. And then it dawned on my heart,
[43:29] it said that no matter what we going
[43:32] through, Jesus has always been there.
[43:35] And I could I could have sat there and
[43:36] complained and murmuring and everything.
[43:39] And they and I thought about it. I said,
[43:40] "Look what God went through to save all
[43:42] of us." And it's like now I know I woke
[43:46] up this morning. And I said, I'm going
[43:47] to get up and I'm going to church and
[43:49] I'm going to sing because it wasn't
[43:51] nothing that was going to stop the
[43:52] blessing of God. And God bless you.

[59:38] it's a part two with a young man on
[59:40] courtship. And uh September 20th, it's
[59:44] part seven for married couple. I will
[59:46] see about the two questions that were

[59:53] scripture and based on the message of
[59:55] the hour. Amen. I know there is a lot of
[59:57] going on with finances. I want to stay

[1:00:11] September the 27th Lord's willing. I
[1:00:14] have not gotten a specific subject about
[1:00:17] it. So if I don't get it by the end of
[1:00:20] the month, what we will do, we will sit
[1:00:22] with you on oneonone question and answer
[1:00:24] about everything we cover before. Is
[1:00:27] that okay with you?
[1:00:29] Uh a few people. Amen. Because I don't
[1:00:31] want somebody who come and say no. Is
[1:00:33] that okay? So if you can get all your
[1:00:37] questions, send them to me. We sit with
[1:00:40] the pastor and the deacon and my wife
[1:00:42] and the deacon wife. we sit and let's go
[1:00:44] ahead and talk wherever you miss
[1:00:46] something or you you didn't understand
[1:00:48] something correctly. Let's go ahead and
[1:00:50] review that and make sure everything is
[1:00:52] soaking in. Is that okay? So, brother
[1:00:55] Kelly, you heard me. Brother Tony, you
[1:00:58] heard it. Brother Robert, you heard it.
[1:00:59] And congregation heard it. So, I got a
[1:01:02] witness. This is what we will do. Amen.
[1:01:04] So, do me a favor. Send me your
[1:01:06] question. just go ahead and send send it
[1:01:09] directly or give it or put it in a
[1:01:12] question box there and we'll go ahead
[1:01:14] and deal with it. Amen. The building is
[1:01:16] progressing pretty good. If you see a
[1:01:18] stop or something slowing, there is two
[1:01:20] cases. Either we're waiting for an
[1:01:22] inspection or either some diero is
[1:01:25] running a little low and then uh brother
[1:01:28] set needs some reminders. Amen. But by
[1:01:31] God's grace, the big deal is already
[1:01:33] taken care of. the top of over there.
[1:01:35] It's already connected. So, I'm looking
[1:01:38] at the big bill of $67,000
[1:01:40] for the uh what do you call it? The the
[1:01:45] foundation of the the the whole metal
[1:01:47] building is already there. We just need
[1:01:49] to put the foundation, pour the slab,
[1:01:51] and then they erect everything together.
[1:01:53] But I'm still dealing with this. I don't
[1:01:56] have money, but I have a big God, and I
[1:01:58] have more than that one.
[1:02:02] Amen.
[1:02:04] Amen. So whatever I do, whatever is
[1:02:07] coming up, I mean like in a war,

[1:02:14] Amen. So what you can do, do it. God
[1:02:16] will bless you. He loves a cheerful
[1:02:19] giver. And I'm glad I didn't preach
[1:02:21] that. And he was not even a minister. I
[1:02:25] mean a minister from this church that
[1:02:27] preach it. So you know it's not brother
[1:02:29] Kelly, it's not brother Polycrop, it's
[1:02:31] not brother Steven. So it's coming from
[1:02:33] the Lord.
[1:02:36] A cheerful giver.
[1:02:38] Brother Freddy, when they giving
[1:02:40] offering, look at their faces. Look at
[1:02:42] their faces. They need to smile. Put in
[1:02:45] that offering.
[1:02:47] Look at them faces. Amen.
[1:02:51] Amen. You need to be happy because you
[1:02:53] cannot outgive God.
[1:02:57] And I thank God he gave me a job so that
[1:03:00] when I'm working the finances can go
[1:03:03] toward the progress of the church. So
[1:03:05] God knew how to orchestrate everything.
[1:03:08] Amen. Lord willing at the end of the
[1:03:11] service we will have a water baptism
[1:03:13] again. It's going to be somebody who
[1:03:15] want to be rebaptized and it's very
[1:03:17] important because I know the background
[1:03:18] a little bit. So that is wonderful that
[1:03:21] the Lord have touched him. Amen. Uh one
[1:03:24] last announcement. I don't know what's
[1:03:26] wrong. He looks like but it's the devil
[1:03:27] because once in a while he looks like
[1:03:29] somebody come up with something crazy in
[1:03:31] the message rank but uh we already went
[1:03:35] about we already talked about this in
[1:03:37] detail. It's on YouTube. I talked about
[1:03:40] the god of variety.
[1:03:42] You remember that in a hotel and we gave
[1:03:45] you quote we gave you scripture and
[1:03:47] everything is correct is clear. Amen. So
[1:03:51] for some reason overseas somebody it was
[1:03:55] an African-American who want to marry a
[1:03:57] Caucasian.
[1:03:59] So they presented to them into the
[1:04:02] church and they came up with a quote
[1:04:04] that have been fabricated.
[1:04:09] So if you know about the story you see
[1:04:11] people circulating quote online that
[1:04:14] quote is not true. It doesn't exist.
[1:04:20] So somebody manufacture a quote of
[1:04:22] brother Brandham and use even the sermon
[1:04:25] title of brother Brham and put it there
[1:04:27] where brother Brandham say it is not a
[1:04:29] sin and it's not true the court doesn't
[1:04:32] exist
[1:04:34] and the same message they use is the
[1:04:37] message brother Brandham is actually
[1:04:38] condemning it
[1:04:42] so I'm going to get two original table
[1:04:46] of the message and I will keep them in
[1:04:48] this church here because the devil is so
[1:04:50] aggressive now that they begin to
[1:04:52] manufacture quote in the man. That quote
[1:04:55] came from hell. Yes, he did.
[1:05:00] Can you say amen? So if somebody comes
[1:05:02] and say, "Oh, brother Brandham say he
[1:05:04] never say that."
[1:05:06] You will never find that quote in an
[1:05:08] English version. It doesn't exist. It's
[1:05:11] not on the tape. Amen. Stick with what
[1:05:15] brother Brham says.
[1:05:17] Are we together? Are we together? I'm
[1:05:20] not ashamed to say what I believe.
[1:05:24] Black people marry black people.
[1:05:28] Get the
[1:05:31] Say amen. Give him the volume. Can you
[1:05:34] say amen? Amen. White people marry white
[1:05:37] people. Amen. Chinese marry Chinese.
[1:05:40] Amen. Are we together? Amen. This is
[1:05:42] what the prophet say and this is what I
[1:05:44] stand behind. If you got a problem, we
[1:05:47] preach the God of variety.
[1:05:49] Stay the way God put you. Amen. Are we
[1:05:52] together? Amen. There was a young man, I
[1:05:55] told him, I said, "There's a lot of
[1:05:56] women. Go find one." He didn't want. I
[1:05:58] said, "Find another pastor to marry
[1:05:59] you." He left the church. I'm very glad
[1:06:02] of that one because I got a testimony.
[1:06:05] Are we together? Amen. So, that thing is
[1:06:07] coming from hell.
[1:06:09] Stick with the message of the hour and
[1:06:12] as a a a guideline,
[1:06:15] okay? Whenever somebody brings you a
[1:06:18] quote
[1:06:20] and it sounds different
[1:06:22] like it's contradicting the message as a
[1:06:25] whole, push the brake. Amen. Go verify
[1:06:30] the quote.
[1:06:32] And make sure the quote is there. Amen.
[1:06:34] Because the message doesn't contradict
[1:06:36] itself. Yes, sir. Amen. That's right.
[1:06:39] Are we together? Amen. I know I got
[1:06:41] people following me international, so I
[1:06:44] got to blast that devil out. That quote
[1:06:46] does not exist. He came from hell. Amen.
[1:06:50] Are we together? Amen. If somebody came
[1:06:52] and say, "Oh, I have a quote." Brother
[1:06:54] Brandham say we women need to repent.
[1:06:57] Take that completely to hell. Correct?
[1:06:59] Because it won't happen. Brother
[1:07:01] Brandham cannot contradict himself.
[1:07:04] Amen. The message have a continuity.
[1:07:07] Yes. Amen. Stick with the message of the
[1:07:09] hour. Obey. He see his prophet and you
[1:07:12] will prosper. Are we together? Amen. It
[1:07:15] should not be even a problem here. So,
[1:07:17] and and and it's amazing how people are
[1:07:20] excited.
[1:07:22] I'm like, so you guys were waiting for
[1:07:23] this all along.
[1:07:26] Like they got a new revelation. You
[1:07:28] should see them online with anointing
[1:07:31] with a false coat, a false coat, a
[1:07:34] fabricated coat. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:38] If a fabricated coat give them the
[1:07:40] anointing,
[1:07:46] what would the normal real coat do to
[1:07:49] you?
[1:07:50] An anointing from the devil.
[1:07:54] Are we together? Amen. Everybody clear?
[1:07:57] Amen. So, flight attendant, prepare for
[1:07:59] takeoff. Amen.
[1:08:03] quick on Tik Tok like they have a new
[1:08:06] discovery.
[1:08:10] Let's stand for the reading of the word.

[1:09:49] presence here, Lord. Father, this is as

[1:09:54] have given me, Lord. But when it comes
[1:09:57] to speaking to your brother, teaching,
[1:10:01] preaching, it's only taking the
[1:10:02] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:05] Lord, may you move me completely out of
[1:10:08] the way, please. And may you move this
[1:10:10] audience visible and invisible out of
[1:10:12] the way. May you come down in the power
[1:10:14] of resurrection and speak to our soul
[1:10:17] and bless us Lord. Father be the
[1:10:19] beginning and the ending, the alpha and

[1:18:43] tree, you shall not go over the bow
[1:18:46] again, and it shall be for the stranger,

[1:18:52] When you gather the grapes of your
[1:18:55] vineyard, you shall not glean it
[1:18:57] afterward. It shall be for the stranger,

[1:19:08] with blessings. Amen. Amen. And those

[1:19:54] Ruth chapter one.
[1:19:57] Verse one. Amen. Are you there? Amen.
[1:20:00] Now it came to pass. You know this book
[1:20:02] very well, my friend. Now it came to
[1:20:04] pass in the days when the judges rule
[1:20:07] that there was a famine
[1:20:10] in the land and a certain man of
[1:20:13] Bethlehem Judah went to sj in the
[1:20:16] country of Moab he and his wife and his
[1:20:19] two sons. So what drove Ic out of
[1:20:23] Israel?
[1:20:24] Famine. Famine.
[1:20:26] We clear? Amen. Famine drove them out.
[1:20:31] You know the story in between. I'm going
[1:20:33] to skip for the sake of time. Jump to
[1:20:35] verse six.
[1:20:38] Then she arose with her, we know Malon
[1:20:41] and Killian. All of them died. We
[1:20:43] already know the story. That's right.
[1:20:45] Then she arose, speaking of Naomi, with
[1:20:48] her daughtersin-law,
[1:20:50] and she that she may return from the
[1:20:52] country of Moab, for she had heard in
[1:20:56] the country of Moab how that the Lord
[1:20:59] has visited his people in giving them
[1:21:02] water. So when God begin to bless
[1:21:05] Israel, Naomi left to go back. In other
[1:21:09] words, there was no more famine. It was
[1:21:12] famine that drove them out. By when
[1:21:14] bread came back, Naomi turned around and
[1:21:17] going back. Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:20] So it was bread that pulled them back
[1:21:22] home.
[1:21:25] Amen. Are we together? Amen. There was a
[1:21:28] blessing that came. Yes, sir.
[1:21:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. But bread doesn't come
[1:21:35] in one day. No. No. It is first planted
[1:21:38] as a seed. Uhhuh. And then there is a
[1:21:41] time that the seed need to grow. Then it
[1:21:43] need to be harvested and then worked on
[1:21:45] there and then cooked. Then you get
[1:21:47] bread. Amen. Are we together? Amen. But
[1:21:50] they heard that there was bread. Bread.
[1:21:52] Food. Yes.
[1:21:56] Because famine is no food.
[1:22:00] Bread means we got food. Amen. Now they
[1:22:03] can go back. Are we together? Amen.
[1:22:06] Praise God. Jump to verse 11. I'm
[1:22:08] skipping because you know the story. And
[1:22:10] Naomi say, "Turn again, my daughters."
[1:22:13] He's talking to Ruth and Oprah. Why will
[1:22:16] you go with me?
[1:22:19] Remember, both of them are widows.
[1:22:21] That's right.
[1:22:23] Are we together? Amen. And a widow has a
[1:22:27] category here that she falls under.
[1:22:32] Yes, sir. I hope we are together. Amen.
[1:22:35] Checked. Yes, sir. We clear. Amen.
[1:22:40] All right. So Naomi said, "Turn again,
[1:22:43] my daughters. Why will you go with me?
[1:22:47] Are there yet any more sons in my womb?"
[1:22:51] "That they may be your husband." This is
[1:22:54] under the law. That's it. Are we
[1:22:56] together? Amen. In other words, there is
[1:22:58] no more hope.
[1:23:00] Yes.
[1:23:02] For you to have a husband
[1:23:05] from me because I only had two.
[1:23:08] Both of them are gone. I don't have any.
[1:23:11] And as a matter of fact, my husband also
[1:23:14] is dead.
[1:23:16] So if you follow me, you will remain
[1:23:19] single.
[1:23:21] Are we together? Amen. Verse uh uh 12.
[1:23:26] Turn again, my daughters, go your way.
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:32] For I am too old.
[1:23:35] In other words, even though my husband
[1:23:37] is dead, Uhhuh. I have a right to
[1:23:39] remarry, but look at my age. Amen. I
[1:23:43] look already like a grandma. So even if
[1:23:47] grandma have somebody
[1:23:51] and if I have a Okay. Okay. No, no. Let
[1:23:53] me read the Bible because I don't want
[1:23:55] any problem. Let me read the Bible. For

[1:24:34] grieve me much for your sake that the
[1:24:37] hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
[1:24:40] In other word, if you follow me, I want

[1:24:46] consent. Amen. Amen. Me and you sat
[1:24:49] down, I explain you the whole case.

[1:24:53] Number two, even if I get a children and
[1:24:55] I have a baby right now, you will not be
[1:24:58] there waiting. And in other words, don't
[1:25:00] compromise your youth.
[1:25:03] You have more freedom right now that you
[1:25:06] are widows to go than to follow me. So
[1:25:09] the message of Naomi is hopeless.
[1:25:13] Amen.
[1:25:15] Amen. Are we together? Amen. He doesn't
[1:25:17] have any hope for a marriage. Amen. He
[1:25:21] doesn't have any hope for a husband.

[1:25:27] will remain single.

[1:27:11] Amen. I hope we are together. Amen. She
[1:27:14] became a Jew. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:18] Are we together? Amen. So by faith, Ruth
[1:27:22] is a Jew. But if you struggle with her,
[1:27:25] she can also say, "Okay, if you call, if
[1:27:28] you consider me a stranger, Yes, sir. I
[1:27:30] still have a right." Amen. So both ways
[1:27:34] I'm winning. Amen.

[1:27:39] Amen. He says, "Your people shall be my
[1:27:42] people and your God."
[1:27:45] Ah, so she doesn't want to be identified
[1:27:48] only with the people of God, but she
[1:27:51] want to be identified with the God of
[1:27:53] the people of Israel.
[1:27:56] In other words, she have changed
[1:27:57] religion.
[1:27:59] She's no longer a hidden. Amen. She's no
[1:28:03] longer a pagan. Amen. She is now a

[1:28:16] bypass every law? We understand. And the
[1:28:19] Bible says, "My people, your people
[1:28:21] shall be my people and your God shall be
[1:28:24] my God." So clear roof here is no longer
[1:28:27] a Moabitete. Uhhuh. Moabitete on the
[1:28:30] outside but inwardly a Jew. Amen.
[1:28:33] Israelite. We clear my friend. Amen. Job

[1:28:40] leave, they had a time they had to be on
[1:28:43] the road for the journey. Amen. Remember
[1:28:47] they only heard that there was bread.
[1:28:52] Are we together? Amen. So they were
[1:28:53] coming because there was bread. But we
[1:28:55] need to know which season
[1:28:59] were they going in. When they leave by
[1:29:01] the time they left till the time they
[1:29:04] arrive. Amen. We don't know if they left
[1:29:07] in the summer or in the winter. We don't
[1:29:09] know. But the main thing is which which
[1:29:12] season are you going to enter? Amen. Are

[1:29:43] this is Naomi, the entering in in
[1:29:45] Bethlehem. "Call me not Naomi, call me
[1:29:48] Mara," which means bitter. For the
[1:29:51] Almighty has dealt very bitterly with
[1:29:54] me. I went out how? For and the Lord has
[1:29:58] brought me home again how empty. So, how
[1:30:01] did Naomi came back to Israel? Empty.

[1:30:29] for you to kick roof out. Amen.
[1:30:33] She has three things that qualify her.
[1:30:36] Amen. To the benefits of God. Amen. She
[1:30:40] can go as a poor. Uh-huh. Amen. She can
[1:30:44] go as a stranger. Amen. She can go as a
[1:30:47] widow. Amen. All we need is two or three
[1:30:50] witnesses. Amen. Let every word be
[1:30:53] established. That's right. Amen.
[1:30:57] Are we together my friend? Amen. So this
[1:30:59] woman is doomed for blessing. Amen.
[1:31:04] Amen. She is predestinated for blessing.

[1:31:13] poor. Uh-huh. Amen.
[1:31:17] But poverty was making a way toward
[1:31:20] another blessing. Amen. Amen. Maybe she
[1:31:23] didn't understand why she had to be born
[1:31:25] in a certain country. Amen. But there
[1:31:27] was an advantage to be born to that
[1:31:30] country. Maybe she didn't understand why
[1:31:32] the husband died. Amen. But there was a
[1:31:35] blessing with a husband that was dead.
[1:31:38] Everything that happened in your life
[1:31:41] worked together for good. Amen. That's

[1:31:56] The Bible says right here, I went out
[1:31:58] full and the Lord has brought me home
[1:32:01] again. How? Empty. Why then call you me
[1:32:04] Naomi? Seeing the Lord has testified
[1:32:06] against me, and the Almighty has done
[1:32:08] what? Afflicted me. Naomi returned and
[1:32:11] roof in uh the Moabites, her
[1:32:14] daughter-in-law, with her, which

[1:32:51] days for us to be there. Now it's
[1:32:54] raining. We have to wait here for two

[1:45:49] For some reason, roof is going and the
[1:45:53] first field
[1:45:57] that happened is not the field of
[1:46:00] somebody else. It is exactly the field
[1:46:03] of this man. Amen. This grownup man, who

[1:46:26] Amen.
[1:46:28] We show him so many sisters in the
[1:46:30] church. It looks like he's not
[1:46:32] interested.
[1:46:35] All the young sister are talking about
[1:46:37] him.
[1:46:40] Some are even praying for him.

[1:46:48] And suddenly Ruth lodge right there.

[1:47:19] I hope we are together. Amen. Everything
[1:47:21] is matching. Yes, sir.
[1:47:24] When it's in season, no effort. Uhhuh.
[1:47:28] It looks like something that happened by
[1:47:30] any chance. I was going this road and
[1:47:32] something tell me go this road. And when
[1:47:34] I go this road, hey, you here?
[1:47:37] No, no, no, no. There is something going
[1:47:39] on. Amen. Are we together? Are we
[1:47:42] together? And you know the rest of the
[1:47:44] story that filled lock her. Yes.
[1:47:49] Yes.
[1:47:51] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:47:54] Jump to the last verse of chapter 2.
[1:47:58] If you there you can say amen. Amen.
[1:48:01] Verse 23.
[1:48:03] Then we start preaching. You there? So
[1:48:07] she kept fast. You know the whole story.
[1:48:09] By the maiden of Boaz to do what? glean
[1:48:13] to the end of what? The barley harvest.
[1:48:18] And of what? The wheat harvest. Over
[1:48:21] time, right? Amen.
[1:48:24] Am I is my Bible different than you? So
[1:48:27] Ruth glean everything. She finished the
[1:48:30] barley. She pick up again the wheat.
[1:48:32] Uhhuh.
[1:48:34] Amen. Amen. At the end of wheat harvest
[1:48:37] and dwell with her mother what water. So

[1:48:42] blessing of the wheat harvest, the
[1:48:45] barley and the wheat. Uh-huh.
[1:48:49] Everything 200%.
[1:48:52] Uh-huh.
[1:48:57] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:49:00] It looks like the season only provided
[1:49:04] food. Yeah. Uhhuh.
[1:49:08] If you notice, Ruth was eating
[1:49:12] at Bo's table. She didn't cook.
[1:49:17] It's written right here, my friend. We
[1:49:19] already went through this.
[1:49:22] Boab order order the young man to draw
[1:49:26] water. That's right. For roof. That's
[1:49:28] right. And Boaz ordered the young man.

[1:49:37] it's no more within this umbrella. Yes,

[1:49:42] right. And abundantly.
[1:49:46] I I don't know if we together. This one
[1:49:48] you can take it every day. So roof got
[1:49:51] more than 200%. Amen. Because 100% is
[1:49:56] what is falling by the providence of
[1:49:58] God. That's right. In other words, God
[1:50:00] is sending angels. when you are gleaning
[1:50:03] the angel will walk by you and
[1:50:07] don't get it and it's God doing that so
[1:50:10] the widow can pick up but beside that
[1:50:12] boy I say I know that God is already
[1:50:15] giving but now it's me when you see roof
[1:50:18] not everybody else only roof when you
[1:50:20] see roof coming

[1:50:33] Maybe roof say hey sir sir he say not
[1:50:35] worry you know according to the law if
[1:50:37] he fell like this I can't touch it.

[1:50:48] Did she work for it? No. Did she pay for
[1:50:51] it? No.
[1:50:53] Did she prepare that? No. Amen.
[1:50:56] Who is doing all of this? So the harvest
[1:51:00] for roof got everything. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:51:04] In other words, the harvest is a season
[1:51:07] full
[1:51:10] of blessings. Amen. And the point is
[1:51:14] this blessings are a fortress. Amen.
[1:51:18] Amen. No effort from you. Uhhuh.
[1:51:22] You don't do no work. Amen.
[1:51:25] You only go and glean for it. Amen. Are
[1:51:29] we together? Amen. And God is providing
[1:51:31] that. But the season of the harvest, are
[1:51:35] we together? Amen. Did not only provide
[1:51:38] food. Amen.

[1:51:46] the hidden husband. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:53] Yes sir. He also provide marriage. Amen.
[1:51:58] Amen. Amen. In other words, the
[1:52:02] impossibility
[1:52:04] preached by Naomi.
[1:52:06] Yes. Become possible. That's right. When
[1:52:09] it's in the season. Amen.
[1:52:12] Amen. I'm going to start it again. The
[1:52:14] devil will fight you not to get this. I
[1:52:17] know exactly what he's doing. The
[1:52:19] impossibility that was preached by Naomi
[1:52:22] like there is no more hope when you are
[1:52:25] in the season. Amen.
[1:52:28] The impossible become possible.
[1:52:32] Amen.
[1:52:34] I don't know if you getting what I'm
[1:52:36] saying.
[1:52:39] The impossible become possible. Where
[1:52:42] people say it's not going to happen. It
[1:52:45] won't happen. where the doctor say it's
[1:52:47] finished. Uh-huh.
[1:52:50] When the season come. Uh-huh.
[1:52:53] Amen.
[1:52:56] Amen.
[1:53:00] Lord, help spoken word. To know how to
[1:53:04] discern the season. Amen.
[1:53:07] Amen.
[1:53:11] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:53:14] Amen. Are we together? The people in the
[1:53:17] world say time is money. That's right.
[1:53:20] I'm going to tell you, be careful with
[1:53:21] time. That's right. Watch time. Amen.
[1:53:25] Amen. Amen, Lord. Amen.
[1:53:28] Watch the time you living in.
[1:53:32] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:53:35] together? Amen. I have not started
[1:53:37] reading brother Brandham yet, my friend.

[1:53:42] together? My subject this morning
[1:53:46] is opportunity and season.
[1:53:53] We there. You can take your seat belt
[1:53:55] off because now the airplane is still
[1:53:57] going like this. Amen. Are we together?
[1:53:59] Amen. According to Ecclesiastes 3 verse
[1:54:03] one, we found out that there are three
[1:54:06] elements
[1:54:08] that goes with our prayer. Amen. We
[1:54:11] found out that our prayer goes with
[1:54:14] time. Uhhuh. Our prayer goes with a
[1:54:18] season. That's right. And our prayer
[1:54:20] goes with a purpose. That's right. And
[1:54:23] we already elaborate a lot on the
[1:54:25] purpose until you understand purpose
[1:54:28] very well. But today we are dealing
[1:54:31] again with season. Amen.
[1:54:34] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:54:37] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Season also
[1:54:41] somehow is connected to time.
[1:54:45] Follow me my friend. Are we together?
[1:54:48] Brother Brham says normally time didn't
[1:54:51] exist before.
[1:54:54] Are we together? What existed before was
[1:54:57] eternity. Amen. With a God that was
[1:55:00] eternal. Amen. In other words, God
[1:55:02] eternal with eternity. They all blended
[1:55:05] together like a hand and a glove. Amen.
[1:55:08] Are we together? Brother Brandham say
[1:55:10] eternity was a perfect circle
[1:55:14] that has no beginning. Uhhuh. And no
[1:55:17] ending. Which is like Mechisedc. That's
[1:55:20] right. No beginning, no ending of life.
[1:55:25] Are we together? It's always a circle.
[1:55:28] Amen. Are we together? And brother
[1:55:30] Brandham say sin happen. Correct. And
[1:55:33] sin cause a loop.
[1:55:36] Brother Brandham called that a I mean a
[1:55:38] kink. He even called that a hickey. Not
[1:55:42] the crazy hickey. Are we together?
[1:55:45] Brother say what happened is sin created
[1:55:49] a loop. Follow me my friend. This one is
[1:55:52] a perfect circle of eternity. I'm just
[1:55:55] touching quickly so we move on. But when
[1:55:58] sin happen eternity have a loop that
[1:56:02] have dropped like this. Amen. Amen.
[1:56:06] Brother Brham called this a kink. He
[1:56:08] called that a hickey. Amen. There are
[1:56:11] many where he called that even a gap
[1:56:14] that happened. So now brother Brandham
[1:56:16] say eternity is no longer perfect.
[1:56:20] Amen.
[1:56:22] If you want the code to see me my friend
[1:56:24] I'll give you the code. It is eternity
[1:56:27] but it's not perfect because eternity
[1:56:30] has been broken. Amen. Are we together?
[1:56:32] Amen. And brother Brham said, "This
[1:56:34] place here is what we call time." Amen.
[1:56:42] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:56:45] Amen. And time has a beginning. Uhhuh.
[1:56:48] And he has an ending. But eternity have
[1:56:51] no beginning. That's right. But no
[1:56:53] ending. Are we together? And then time
[1:56:56] has season.
[1:56:58] That's correct. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:57:02] I hope we together. Time contain
[1:57:06] seasons.
[1:57:08] Are we together? Amen. Even though in
[1:57:10] season also there is time. Amen. Yes

[1:57:16] Are we together? Amen. Which season are
[1:57:18] we in? We are in summer. Summer.
[1:57:21] Yesterday was what? Summer. Today was
[1:57:25] water. Tomorrow is what? Summer. But
[1:57:27] it's a different time within a season.
[1:57:30] That's right. Are we together? But all
[1:57:32] of that is a time. Amen. But time is
[1:57:36] divided in season or in period of time.
[1:57:41] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:57:45] Periods of time. Yes, sir. Are we
[1:57:48] together? Amen. Are we clear so far?

[1:58:52] Children season. Amen.
[1:58:56] Everything has what? A season. So season

[1:59:50] that have what I'm looking for. Amen.
[1:59:56] And if I reach the season that have what

[2:00:01] come, Amen. for me to have what I was
[2:00:04] looking for. Amen.
[2:00:06] Amen.
[2:00:11] glorify.
[2:00:13] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:00:15] Amen. In other words, season
[2:00:21] is like a pregnant woman.
[2:00:26] In other words, season is pregnant
[2:00:30] with things. Amen.
[2:00:33] When they say season, don't look at
[2:00:35] season. Amen. Look at what is in that
[2:00:38] season.
[2:00:40] Because everything have a season. Amen.
[2:00:43] If I'm looking for a car, Uhhuh.
[2:00:47] I need to search which which season is
[2:00:50] car.

[2:00:57] you can look for a car, you won't find

[2:01:02] But when the season come, the season

[2:01:09] Amen.
[2:01:12] I don't know if we together. Amen. I
[2:01:14] don't know if we together. In other
[2:01:16] word, when you are out of season, you
[2:01:20] will work harder. Amen.
[2:01:28] Are we together? But when you are in
[2:01:30] season, what you are working hard for,
[2:01:34] apparently for some reason comes easy.
[2:01:38] That's right.
[2:01:44] If Ruth would have come before the
[2:01:47] harvest, she will be working. Amen.
[2:01:52] She will be waking up in the morning,
[2:01:54] clocking in and clock out. Uh-huh. But
[2:01:56] when she came in the season, she doesn't
[2:01:59] have to work. Amen. She only have to
[2:02:02] work as gleaming,
[2:02:04] receiving,
[2:02:06] not planting. Amen.
[2:02:12] Is it too strong? No. What I'm saying,
[2:02:16] what God, not me, what God is saying to
[2:02:19] everything there is a what? A season. So
[2:02:21] whatever I'm looking for has a season.
[2:02:24] That's right. That's correct. Amen.
[2:02:26] Amen. If I find the season, I must find
[2:02:29] it. That's right. Are we together? But
[2:02:32] if the season is not there,
[2:02:37] you will be looking for it.
[2:02:40] You will be wasting your time. That's
[2:02:42] right. And it looks like ah I keep
[2:02:45] pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing,
[2:02:46] pushing, pushing, nothing happened
[2:02:49] because he ain't the time yet. Amen.
[2:02:53] Amen. In other word, if apple
[2:02:57] for instance comes on the spring and you
[2:03:00] come up in the winter,
[2:03:03] I'm going slowly so we we all get it.
[2:03:06] And you go to the apple tree and you
[2:03:08] keep looking and tomorrow you keep
[2:03:10] looking and tomorrow you keep looking.
[2:03:12] Are you going to find an apple? No.
[2:03:14] Because the the the winter doesn't carry
[2:03:17] apple. That's right. In other words,
[2:03:20] season carries blessing. Amen.
[2:03:26] Amen. I'm letting this soak in because
[2:03:29] it's going like it's like an atomic
[2:03:32] bomb. Season carries blessings. Amen.
[2:03:37] Are we together? But when spring comes,
[2:03:42] even if you don't come in the morning,
[2:03:44] Uhhuh. Amen. Even if you you don't want
[2:03:47] to look at the apple tree, one day the
[2:03:50] apple will fall and hit your head.
[2:03:53] to tell you I'm already here. This is
[2:03:55] spring. Amen.
[2:04:00] In other words, you walk so much on the
[2:04:02] winter looking looking and then you got
[2:04:04] tired. You say, "You know what?
[2:04:08] Apple don't have fruit."
[2:04:12] Why do you say apple don't have fruit?
[2:04:13] I've been there. I try. I try for 3
[2:04:15] months. Apple don't have fruit. That's
[2:04:17] it. I I won't even mind apple. And one
[2:04:21] day you minding your business and then
[2:04:22] boom.
[2:04:25] Hey,
[2:04:26] hey, I'm gonna give a testimony.

[2:04:37] problem is the season. Amen.
[2:04:41] The season sometimes. Oh, let me leave
[2:04:44] it alone. Let me go where I'm going, my
[2:04:46] friend. Amen. The season will overtake
[2:04:50] you. Amen.
[2:04:57] You go here to the back decline. You go
[2:04:59] here decline. You go here decline. You
[2:05:02] go here decline. And you keep pushing.
[2:05:03] And you keep pushing.
[2:05:06] Spoken word. Back up.
[2:05:10] It might not be the season.
[2:05:13] Back up. Because when the season come,
[2:05:17] if you put the right sea Uhhuh.
[2:05:21] Amen. If you put the Jordan, Amen.
[2:05:24] whatever is there. Amen.
[2:05:29] Why is Moses powerful? Amen. The season
[2:05:33] has come. Amen.
[2:05:35] Amen.
[2:05:39] Brother, I try. I try. I try. It's not
[2:05:42] working. For some reason, I went to the
[2:05:44] dealership. I say, "Let me stop here and
[2:05:47] ask you, do you have a job?" And they
[2:05:48] say, "Yes, we're looking for somebody."
[2:05:50] A job you didn't think. Uhhuh. A job you
[2:05:53] didn't plan.
[2:05:56] A job that is higher than your
[2:05:58] expectation. Come on. Where was that
[2:06:00] job? Come on. The job was in the season.

[2:06:22] see a season, there is a thing. Uhhuh.
[2:06:24] Are we together? In other words, we'll
[2:06:27] get to that.
[2:06:30] Amen.
[2:06:32] It's amazing how we heal people
[2:06:36] and we build complexes.
[2:06:39] This sermon is hard for me to move. I'm
[2:06:41] like 15 miles an hour. And we hear
[2:06:44] complex. When you look, you say, "Ah,
[2:06:47] that brother is really blessed."
[2:06:51] It looks like everything he does, he's
[2:06:52] always working.
[2:06:58] And then we try to copy.
[2:07:07] He said, "Let me try also." You try, you
[2:07:10] lose money.
[2:07:12] The brother didn't lose money. You lost
[2:07:14] money.
[2:07:17] Then you turn around, you say, I it
[2:07:19] looks like sister so and so is good. You
[2:07:21] know what? The husband finished school
[2:07:23] and then she got this and this is
[2:07:25] working and this is working and the
[2:07:27] sister is so happy. Brother, I'm
[2:07:29] praising the Lord. The Lord did this to
[2:07:31] me yesterday. The Lord did this to do
[2:07:32] and the other one I was like I don't
[2:07:35] know which which which Holy Ghost she
[2:07:37] has. I wish I can have the Holy Ghost
[2:07:40] like her.
[2:07:45] And we build complexes
[2:07:47] and we say and we come up with our own
[2:07:49] answer. We say you know what his great
[2:07:52] great uh great grand uh his grandfather
[2:07:54] is working for the banking. So that's
[2:07:56] why you know he got connection so they
[2:07:59] can when he finish he graduated they
[2:08:01] give him a job quickly because his
[2:08:03] grandfather is in the bank me we started
[2:08:05] from a low class uh people like Gideon
[2:08:09] our family are the least one in Israel
[2:08:12] so it would take time for God to put you
[2:08:15] together
[2:08:16] and then we begin to say no no no he
[2:08:18] succeeded because of this he succeeded
[2:08:22] because of this she's successful because
[2:08:24] of this But I got a news for you.
[2:08:28] What is the news, my friend? The news is
[2:08:31] in Ecclesiastes 9 verse 11. Uh-huh. What
[2:08:36] does the Bible says? Are we together?
[2:08:39] Uhhuh. Solomon say I return
[2:08:42] and I saw where? Under the sun. In other
[2:08:45] words, in the world. In the earth. Here.
[2:08:48] What did you see, Solomon? That the race
[2:08:51] is not to the swift. Uh-huh.
[2:08:55] Uh-huh.
[2:08:57] Are we together? Solomon say, "I found
[2:08:59] out that the race, the one who win the
[2:09:02] race is not because he's swift."
[2:09:06] Amen. Because people are watching him,
[2:09:09] they say, "Haha, this is the one that's
[2:09:11] going to win the case and they see
[2:09:13] somebody coming like this and before you
[2:09:15] know it, the one that was coming like
[2:09:16] this when he take off." Yes, sir. You
[2:09:20] say, "Hey, I didn't know this going to
[2:09:22] happen." Solomon said the race is not to
[2:09:26] the what
[2:09:28] nor the battle to the what
[2:09:33] look at Goliath. Look at how tall he is.
[2:09:36] Look how Goliath is. All it takes is a
[2:09:38] little boy. Uhhuh. A rudy one. That's
[2:09:42] right.
[2:09:44] Coming slowly with just smooth spawn and
[2:09:47] he pull the one down. That's right. So
[2:09:49] who is what's the point? Amen.
[2:09:54] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:09:56] Amen. He said the race is not to the
[2:09:58] water, the swim and not the battle to
[2:10:01] the water. Neither the bread to the
[2:10:04] water. The wise How many wise people are
[2:10:07] hungry? Uhhuh.
[2:10:12] They're writing all type of books.
[2:10:14] Uhhuh. No money. Uhhuh. And the student
[2:10:18] loan debt. Uhhuh.
[2:10:23] rich. Amen. Can I continue? Amen. No.
[2:10:27] Riches to the man of what?
[2:10:29] Understanding. I believe he's successful
[2:10:31] because he's so smart. How many smart
[2:10:34] people are on the warehouse? Uhhuh.
[2:10:41] Go to the warehouse. Ask how many people
[2:10:45] have degree. Uhhuh. College, university
[2:10:48] degree. And you will see them packing
[2:10:51] stuff with a college degree because they
[2:10:55] thought when they go to school they
[2:10:57] going to get it. Uhhuh. And they come up
[2:11:00] with a diploma in philosophy. They can
[2:11:03] tell you all the story. No money. That's
[2:11:06] right.
[2:11:07] Can't even afford a house. It is not
[2:11:11] intelligence.
[2:11:13] No.
[2:11:15] Because somebody when they succeed, they
[2:11:17] try to show people I succeeded because I
[2:11:20] did this. That is not the truth. No. No.
[2:11:26] Because there are people that did the
[2:11:28] same thing he did, but they don't end up
[2:11:30] with the same result. Uhhuh. So why did
[2:11:33] he get it and the other didn't get it?
[2:11:38] Can I continue my friend? Amen. He says
[2:11:41] no favor to the what? Man of skill. Oh,
[2:11:44] because he have a lot of potential. So
[2:11:46] they're going to hire him. And you will
[2:11:48] see in the interview, he will intimidate
[2:11:50] everybody.
[2:11:53] He will intimidate everybody because he
[2:11:55] got a higher skill. Okay. Okay. It's a
[2:11:57] working interview. He's going to show
[2:11:58] off. He think and before you know it,
[2:12:02] man, we already got the qualification
[2:12:04] for somebody else and we appreciate you.
[2:12:06] Whenever we get an opportunity, we will
[2:12:08] call you again. Uh-huh. All your skill
[2:12:10] downh and sometime they take the one
[2:12:13] that have that is less skilled than you.
[2:12:16] What makes that one go when you have
[2:12:18] more skill?
[2:12:20] Amen. When you can plaster the wall with
[2:12:23] all your degrees.
[2:12:26] When you know how to put the word
[2:12:28] together.
[2:12:30] What makes him successful with a broken
[2:12:33] English?
[2:12:40] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:12:43] Instead of saying he, he said she.
[2:12:45] Instead of she, he say he. But his
[2:12:47] subscriber keep going higher. Amen. What
[2:12:50] makes him successful?
[2:12:53] It is not his intelligence.
[2:12:57] Amen.
[2:12:59] It is not his degree. No.
[2:13:02] Because there are people with higher
[2:13:04] degree than him. There is something
[2:13:07] else. Amen. What is it? Amen.
[2:13:10] Hallelujah.
[2:13:14] Hallelujah. Are we together? Amen. Are
[2:13:17] we together? They went to look at Dat
[2:13:19] Moody. They say, "How can he fill the
[2:13:22] auditorium?" That's right. With an
[2:13:24] English like that. They they they came,
[2:13:28] they listen to him. They say what what
[2:13:30] type of I mean speech is this?
[2:13:33] But the one who have good speech they
[2:13:36] have to send invitation to remind the
[2:13:40] the church member to come to church on
[2:13:42] Sunday.
[2:13:45] What makes the difference?
[2:13:49] What is the key of success?
[2:13:52] Solomon said no yet know yet what favor
[2:13:55] to men of skill. But what is it? Time
[2:13:58] and what? Chance.
[2:14:08] So what is important? Time and chance.
[2:14:12] Time and what?
[2:14:17] Fight meets the Bible, my friend. Do you
[2:14:20] know what chance means?
[2:14:22] Do you know what chance mean?
[2:14:24] Chance in another version it means
[2:14:28] opportunity. That's right. Amen.
[2:14:34] Are we together? Amen. It means
[2:14:36] opportunity or circumstance. Amen.
[2:14:41] Hallelujah. In other words, it is not
[2:14:44] the the race is not to the swift. No.
[2:14:47] The problem is time. Uhhuh.
[2:14:52] It is the season.
[2:14:55] I don't know if we together. And the
[2:14:57] opportunity he won because it was his
[2:15:02] time. Amen.
[2:15:04] Amen. He won because there was an
[2:15:07] opportunity given to him. Amen. He got
[2:15:11] successful in business not because he's
[2:15:14] smart. It's his time. Amen.
[2:15:19] It is his season. Amen. That's why
[2:15:21] Amazon is blossoming.
[2:15:24] You know that Amazon fell.
[2:15:27] Do you know that? You know that Amazon
[2:15:29] fell. He went down and what makes him go
[2:15:33] back uphus.
[2:15:36] Do you know how many people are starting
[2:15:38] business all along and they don't make
[2:15:40] it anyway? The problem is not the
[2:15:43] business. It is the season. Amen. It is
[2:15:47] the opportunity. It is God. Amen.
[2:15:59] If it's your God, divine opportunity,

[2:25:13] God is working with his clock
[2:25:18] is God who set season for a purpose.

[2:25:42] Jesus.
[2:25:46] Back home when we grew up, we didn't
[2:25:49] understand. Our mother used to say,
[2:25:50] "Look at the moon. Look at the moon.
[2:25:52] Look at the moon." And we didn't
[2:25:53] understand what was women talking about
[2:25:55] moon.

[2:26:30] Revelation 4 when he quoted the
[2:26:32] scripture, brother Brandham say it was a

[2:26:36] program of God. Amen. You will have
[2:26:38] summer, you will have winter, you will
[2:26:41] have uh whatever cold, you have whether

[2:37:30] telling Israel that he care for the
[2:37:34] promised land. Amen. He said I want to
[2:37:36] put you in the promised land and I take
[2:37:38] care of it. Amen. How does God take care
[2:37:41] of the promised land? He says, "The eyes
[2:37:45] of the Lord thy God are how always
[2:37:49] when?" Always
[2:37:51] upon it. From what? From the beginning
[2:37:55] of the year until what? The end of the

[2:38:30] Notice that the entire year is saturated
[2:38:33] with the presence of God. Amen. Follow
[2:38:36] me carefully now. Amen. Amen. But
[2:38:38] remember the year got season. That's
[2:38:40] right.
[2:38:43] Are we together? Amen. Year got four
[2:38:45] season. But God is everywhere. We get
[2:38:50] you get it. Amen. And the Bible says it
[2:38:52] shall come to pass if it shall hearken

[2:39:03] giving you, we shall command you this

[2:40:30] brother so and so believe that now God
[2:40:32] has come.

[2:40:39] airport, my friend. I hope you get that.

[2:40:55] latter rain that you may gather in the
[2:40:58] corn and that one and then what?

[2:41:07] year God is there. That's right.
[2:41:10] The presence of God is there. Uhhuh. But
[2:41:12] the blessing doesn't come yet. No.
[2:41:17] Amen.
[2:41:20] That's why brother Brham say that
[2:41:24] material blessing is not a son
[2:41:29] that God is with you. Uhhuh.
[2:41:34] I hope you understanding me. Amen. I I
[2:41:36] hope you're understanding it. So even
[2:41:38] though what you're looking for,
[2:41:41] are we together? has not come yet, it
[2:41:45] doesn't mean God is not there. Amen.
[2:41:48] Amen. That's what I want you to go with

[2:42:25] You're talking about fasting.
[2:42:28] You're talking about prayer. You're
[2:42:30] talking about meeting. You're talking
[2:42:32] about running after preacher.
[2:42:36] You're talking about prayer. You're
[2:42:39] talking about how many land has been
[2:42:41] laid. How many prayer line prayer line
[2:42:46] prayer line prayer line prayer line
[2:42:49] prayer line prayer line prayer line
[2:42:52] until we are discouraged
[2:42:55] because we put our faith in the wrong
[2:42:57] thing. Amen.
[2:43:00] There it is right there. We put our
[2:43:01] faith in people instead of putting our
[2:43:04] faith in God. Uhhuh. Amen. There's
[2:43:08] nothing wrong with praying with the
[2:43:09] people. Uhhuh. But you pressing when
[2:43:12] it's not the time.

[2:43:39] of disappointment here. And when the
[2:43:42] time come, it's a faultless.
[2:43:47] God was here. It doesn't mean he didn't
[2:43:50] hear you. He heard you. He heard you. He
[2:43:55] heard your prayer. He have what you
[2:43:57] looking for. But he's waiting for the
[2:44:00] right time. Amen.
[2:44:03] and the right season to release it.
[2:44:07] Amen.
[2:44:11] That's why the Bible say when the time
[2:44:13] of the promise drew near.
[2:44:16] You remember that in the Bible? When the
[2:44:19] time of the promise drew near, then a
[2:44:22] pharaoh came. The Pharaoh cannot come if
[2:44:26] the season have not approached. Pharaoh
[2:44:28] is coming because the season is coming
[2:44:31] that we need to go. Amen. And I have a
[2:44:34] news for you. Can I tell you the news?
[2:44:38] The pope has come. The pope has come.
[2:44:41] Another pharaoh has risen. Amen. Because
[2:44:44] the season has come. We need to know
[2:44:47] what is the season for. Amen. That's
[2:44:49] right. Amen.
[2:44:52] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:54] Hallelujah. Amen. My friend, let's stop
[2:44:57] here. Let's stop right here. Amen. Let's
[2:45:00] stop right here, my friend. Let's stand.
[2:45:05] Oh, glory.
[2:45:08] I'm sorry. I went 9 minutes of
[2:45:13] Hallelujah.
[2:45:14] Hallelujah.
[2:45:16] Hallelujah.
[2:45:18] Season
[2:45:20] an opportunity.
[2:45:22] I thought I'm going to preach this a
[2:45:23] whole thing. But the Holy Spirit have a
[2:45:25] reason why he want me to stop where I
[2:45:28] stop.
[2:45:30] He has a reason why he didn't want me to
[2:45:32] continue. We push too hard.
[2:45:36] We stress too hard.
[2:45:41] We have taken too much responsibility
[2:45:44] of our own life in our own hand.
[2:45:51] like it's you who is in charge of you.
[2:45:54] Who told you you in charge of yourself?
[2:45:57] Amen.
[2:45:59] God gave you an example when you were a
[2:46:02] child. He put you under a parent to take
[2:46:05] care of you to show you you were born to
[2:46:08] depend.
[2:46:13] Amen. We know too much. We have too much
[2:46:17] confidence on ourselves.
[2:46:20] We think we can do too much. We have so
[2:46:22] much right.
[2:46:24] I have to do this. I have to do the you
[2:46:26] do it. Failure. You do it. Failure. You
[2:46:30] do it. It doesn't work. You do it in
[2:46:32] kicking. What am I doing wrong in
[2:46:33] prayer? Maybe I need to fast. You fast.
[2:46:35] It doesn't happen.
[2:46:38] You fast again, it doesn't happen. And
[2:46:41] when you forget,
[2:46:43] that's right. When you let it go, when
[2:46:45] you don't even worry about it, when you
[2:46:47] are discouraged, when you are no more
[2:46:50] stressed,
[2:46:52] that's when it comes
[2:46:55] so God will tell you, Gideon, it is not
[2:46:58] by the number of the people in the army.
[2:47:04] I am the one in charge. Amen. Amen. When
[2:47:08] you are completely gone, discouraged.
[2:47:10] Amen.
[2:47:12] Amen. Brother Brandham say take a woman
[2:47:15] who want to get pregnant and brother
[2:47:17] Brandham say let that woman keep getting
[2:47:19] worries. Yes sir. And being anxious to
[2:47:22] have a baby brother say draft the baby
[2:47:24] away. Yes sir. That's right. Amen. Yes
[2:47:27] sir. I have a quote my friend. Brother
[2:47:29] Bham say but what they do sometime to
[2:47:32] quieten the nerves of that woman they
[2:47:35] let her adopt a baby. Yes sir. So when
[2:47:37] she begin to adopt a baby finally
[2:47:40] unconsciously it will soak in her soul
[2:47:42] that you already have a child and when
[2:47:45] her nerve relaxes
[2:47:48] now the laws of God according to the
[2:47:51] season of a woman now begin to work and
[2:47:56] suddenly the woman is pregnant
[2:48:00] when we are pushing
[2:48:04] it don't work push back
[2:48:07] Push back my friend. Push back. Relax my
[2:48:10] friend. Remove all the stress. Yes,
[2:48:13] brother Stephven. I understand. So if I
[2:48:15] relax, what do I need to do? We will
[2:48:16] show you what you do.
[2:48:20] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:48:23] approaching you humbly this afternoon.
[2:48:26] Father, we thank you for your grace, for
[2:48:29] your love and your mercy. Father for
[2:48:31] coming down in the power of resurrection
[2:48:34] and Lord begin to unfold these things to
[2:48:37] us Lord. Father how many times we found
[2:48:41] oursel in pressure in tight corner in a
[2:48:45] lot of despair disappointment confused
[2:48:49] completely in our mind wondering what
[2:48:53] are we doing that is not working?
[2:48:56] What is it that we need to fix
[2:49:00] so that we can break through?
[2:49:02] What is it that other people are making
[2:49:04] it and we don't?
[2:49:07] What is it that every time I try it hard
[2:49:11] and somebody else is telling me
[2:49:12] different? What is it that I have
[2:49:15] missed?
[2:49:18] And we are living lives
[2:49:21] under worries
[2:49:23] under questions
[2:49:25] not understanding the providence of God.
[2:49:29] No wonder you say that your people
[2:49:30] perish for lack of knowledge. But
[2:49:34] father, you have come and unfolded these
[2:49:36] things to us. Lord, I pray that this
[2:49:40] sermon can go deeper, way deeper than he
[2:49:43] was received. So that we can realize who
[2:49:46] is in charge. So that we can begin to
[2:49:49] rely more upon your ability, than our
[2:49:53] ability, than our wisdom, than our
[2:49:56] understanding, than our strength, than
[2:49:59] our connection or whatever we know. But
[2:50:02] when we we lean upon the infallible word
[2:50:05] of God because heaven and earth will
[2:50:07] pass away but your word will never pass
[2:50:10] away. Lord I pray that you bless this
[2:50:12] church and help us Lord Father be
[2:50:15] watchful and seize our opportunity.

[2:50:24] of our preparation time so that when the
[2:50:27] season come we will be right into effect
[2:50:30] right into action Lord Father and get
[2:50:33] our blessing and glean them 100% and
