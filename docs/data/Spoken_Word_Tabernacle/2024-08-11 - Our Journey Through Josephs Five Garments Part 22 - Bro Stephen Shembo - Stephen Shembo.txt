that what you are God who's saying God God is looking at his children and God say that ye are God God looking at his children a human being looking at his children and you telling human being you are human come on brother that's it we went through this before it means that the children of God have amnesia we already went through this so help me move on it means the children of God are suffering with amnesia sir Amnesia means they don't know who they are anymore and one time they knew and something happened a shock or some trouble or something happened in their life and because it happened they don't remember amen who they are amen so God is coming back to his children because the children of God are what God can you did somebody sleep good H the children of God are who God so God is

children of God if you need a quote you see me and I can even give you the scripture but uh the Bible say and all of you are children of what the most high how do you have to tell God's children that they are children of the most high amen all this time they were with you they were living with you brother Charles is here I took that example before Elijah is right here that's right Elijah how old are you how old are you 11 11 now Elijah is 30 years old and brother Charles called Elijah and say sit down son and Elijah sat down he said Elijah you are my child so what do you you think 30 years Elijah was doing around he didn't figure it out that you were daddy and you say you know what you a Hamilton so something must happen that's it right to Elijah for his daddy to bring him back to sit him down to tell him you are God to tell him you are the children of the most high the one who's speaking is the most high but the most high is telling his children you are my children not just children the children of the most high I want you to understand who I am I am most high and you are the children of the most high you are the children of the king of kings you are the children of the

this God have dual personalities do you follow me in other word these God are first God Amen and then they are human being amen and both of these make one person amen amen so this person is God and this person is a human being if death come death canot touch God because God and death don't get along that's why brother Bram say Jesus never preach a funeral every time Jesus come contact with a funeral he he resurrect the person there was a widow woman with a child when Jesus met the funeral he brought them to life when you take him to the tomb of Lazarus he resurrected Lazarus because death and God don't get along one is a positive energy the other one is a negative energy brother Bram say death is life perverted one is eternal life and one is death are we together are we together so God is saying that ye are Gods amen and all of you are children of the most high God and you will die like men so when death approaches amen death will attack the human part amen but death will never reach the part of God because God swallow death amen amen so God is sending a message to his children that's right come on he's telling his children you are two part amen are we together there is a part of you that is God in a blunt way there is a part of you that look like me are we together and there is a part of you that look like other human beings because there are human beings that are not God they are human being but they are not God that's why Jesus say my children hear my voice but you are of your children the devil the devil children are human being but they are not God are we together are we together so this message is to the children of God how many children of God do I have this morning so this message is for you this prophecy is for you God want you to understand that you are not just what you see here inside of you you are God Amen I'm still reading the scripture my friend are we together have I lost somebody if I lost you raise your hand all right God say in verse seven by you the scripture have layers that's right H we are just peeling layers okay I'm digging now okay so I'm going okay now but you shall die like what amen and fall like one of the water so these children follow me carefully have an enemy we talked about it last Sunday and the enemy is death amen and we showed you last Sunday that Christ came According to Hebrew 2 and he went and handed death amen when you stop at death here you don't really get what God is doing oh you don't really understand what God is telling you God disclosed death amen amen amen and God came down and handed death yes he did yes he did amen God Resurrected but you still dying amen amen if God already handled death why do we suffer follow me carefully my friend there is something else that is hidden in this scripture amen that the devil doesn't want you to understand that's why he has been fighting come on that's why he tried to close the service down am that's why he's upset because death he admitted oh yes you already won but there is something that the devil play around with you all the time but do me a favor keep your seat belt because we got to get to that what is it the question first is what is death amen amen am Paul says this in Romans chapter 6 verse 23 Paul said that for the wages of what sin is what death so death is the result of sin there it is my friend I told you keep your seat belt don't try to sleep today tell tell that sleeping devil leave me alone do you know why do you know why because when you with everything you done in your life let me say it this way if you are born it's sister jerusa right here and we put her into a a room she doesn't talk to nobody that's right all we do we open a window and we drop food there and we put her her stuff her soap and whatever and she live there not in contact with anyone because if she get in contact with anyone she will sin she will get upset and she might lies and so we we put her into an environment where she doesn't meet anybody she doesn't talk to Mama she doesn't talk to Daddy she's just there we put her in a border so she grew up in her own world have she seen no if we pull jerusa 30 years from there we say sister jerusha now come out do you not sin sister jerusa say what is sin if you tell sister jerusha you are God sister jerusha will believe right there brother amen amen because she never SE amen that's right amen I don't know if you're getting me but if you tell sister jusha now that you are God you know what the devil is doing right now you know what the devil is doing now the devil is telling you something the devil is telling you can God do what you did yesterday that's why he's upset because today you going to see what is is do you follow me the devil will tell you something he would tell you do you know how you get upset with your working that's right can a god get upset and guess what yeah I'm not God we Okay we okay I have to go that way so you catch it so Paul is saying that the wage of sin is what death so death is a result of sin because God say in the Garden of Eden the day that you eat that that day you shall surely what in other words the day you going to disbelieve or go contrary to the Commandment of God that's when death will enter are we together so when God is saying that he are God yes amen and all of you are children of the most high God but you would die like human being God is saying that these gods are subject to [Applause] sin are we together so these Gods these human being Will finds trapped with sin are we together because death is the result of what s so before you can have death you must have sin and God is saying you shall die like man in other word you will be caught up in sin and because of that I have to remind you you are God you say I'm a sinner God say you are God I'm a sinner you are God I'm a sinner you are God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are we together are we together God says here he say for the wages of sin is what but the gift of God is what eternal life through who Jesus Christ Our Lord Brother Bram says this in the message letting off the pressure he said what is what death death is what s so this God are sinners follow me carefully can you say amen amen these gods are sinners wow amen the way you are sin but God if I take brother Elijah and I pull him right there and I put a mad ble outside and take him and say go jump in the m p and then he jump he say brother stepen you're the best pastor ever and then he jump he jump he jump and all his stuff soak with mud is it Elijah or still not Elijah if I ask you who's playing there you will say it's who Elijah do you say ah who's playing there it's the mad something jumping up with M you will say it who Elijah so whichever State Elijah is he's still Elijah amen spoken word Tabernacle wake up whether there is mad or there is not mad it is still [Applause] Elijah amen amen amen amen amen amen if brother Elijah's friend ceron and they say hey follow me carefully you the one slowing me down we saw a crazy boy over there that is praying on the M follow me carefully amen is that your friend what will be the reaction of Elijah friend I don't know him because he's what he he doesn't want to be identified with Elijah because of the mess he's a shame but if you call Charles [Applause] Junior the father of aah if you call him even if elij is in handcuff he will say that's my son amen because it's my [Applause] blood because the father remember his blood it's about the bloodline his state is not my problem in that Bo I have my blood and when God look at you in your VIN flows the blood of Emmanuel he's never going to be ashamed of [Music] you are we together are we together have I lost somebody have I lost somebody give me time if we can knock this thing down okay give me time my friend okay okay my friend so this God are sinners Hallelujah brother pram say sin he said the what the wages of sin is death what is death it's what unbelief he that believeth not is what condemned already so some of this God will be caught into unbelief that's why God say go talk to them because what they looking at is unbelief Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so many people today call themselves Christian they want to believe some Creed of what some church you tell them the word of God they laugh in your face that is what sin are we together are we together are we together I'm still warming the airplane sooner are we going to take off okay keep your seat belt now I was waiting for the first air plane to take off amen then with the next one in line okay praise be to the name name of the Lord glory to God Paul say in Roman 1 he said there there is four when no condemnation now no let's synchronize together therein there is therefore for when now when now when again now there is therefore now what no condemnation to them which are well in Jesus Christ who walk not what after the flesh but after what the spirit so Paul is saying when this God ever get in [Applause] Christ even if you have the record from their prison there is therefore for father help me up you see I can't move I'm trying to move amen amen amen amen amen amen am amen amen if there is a door M they say only police officer can cross there without any problem and there is somebody keep a door people when a police officer comes if he doesn't have his uniform what does he have to do when he when he so his badge what happened guess what enter in gra right so God told Paul put go in Roman 8 tell those Gentile that didn't have the law because the Jews thinks they know me tell those ad worshiper give them a [Applause] badge and the badge is Roman 8 verse1 there is therefore what and God said keep your badge in your pocket whenever you face the devil and he begin to remind you [Applause] pull that c and say devil what you saying is true what you're saying is true but there is another badge there is there for there is there for what now no condemnation now what no condemnation because I'm in Christ amen because sin is what bring condemnation amen father help me up father help me up brother Kelly I wish I was in prison preaching to prison there will be more on fire than you [Applause] [Laughter] hallelujah hallelujah sin bring condemnation that's right that's right that's right remember Sister jerusa if she's secluded she thinks she can handle the devil because she say I have no sin but if you tell her sinh amen backed off a little bit she's a little bit reserved she have to see to watch the situation because the devil remind her are we together are we together so these children dying means they under sin and the sins means they under condemnation the devil didn't want you to understand this amen amen don't let anyone beside you sleep or watch the telephone tell them leave the telephone alone shake shake remember stay look at the preacher amen I'm not going to sweat here for nothing you need to be [Applause] delivered amen amen amen hallelujah first John chapter 3 follow me carefully my friend I'm begging you yes sir first John 3: 20 for if our heart does what condemn us let's stop go to ver 21 if our heart what condemn us not so these Gods sometime can be found cut that's it that's it under condemnation sometime they might be found they are not cut under condemnation Hallelujah so condemnation may or may not Hallelujah are we together are we together Hallelujah Paul say but John say for if our heart do what condemn us God is what greater than our heart and knowth what all things [Music] your heart is condemning you you did something bad your father already know don't waste time he already know and he's greater than your [Applause] heart in other way don't waste time to repent just remove it quickly that's why brother Bram said the Zeal of this age is repent because the devil is throwing everything at you all the time to keep you under condemnation so you need to quick if the devil turn his his D 24 hours you turn your repentance 24 hours as soon as you hit me I say father forgive me you hit me Father forgive me you hit me I didn't mean to do that I'm sorry sister you passed me you didn't shake my hand I'm sorry sister forgive me it's finished because I want to be without [Applause] condemnation Hallelujah don't linger in Repentance it happened don't take to Hey brother stepen I'm sorry I didn't mean to because as soon as you say sorry the devil [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] say angel we there I need to hear some amen coming there are we to together ah I need to hear a man brother Joe I need to hear a man flowing from there are we together amen are we together because there is a key if you don't have condemnation and the devil don't want that what happen if you don't have condemnation remember you are human being and inside of you you are what God so if you don't have [Applause] dation in that way you have two bullet the first bullet and the second when there is no condemnation by automic Gil the top bullet load that's why you say things sometime and it happened and you thought you were joking [Applause] and when you say that you didn't even pray they just told you and news you said God will take care of it and suddenly it's taken care of he was not you he was the god bullet amen no hatred toward the brother no condemnation [Applause] are we together when I dance like this because of the anointing my friend you don't want to dance say still my friend are we together what happen if there is no condemnation what I'm preaching you today you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to stand on a Pulpit this is not for preachers only this is for everyone who believes whether a woman or a man or a child or an old man it depends on who believe [Applause] it we together we together what happen if you don't have condemnation glory to God Paul says what watch before he even speak Paul calls you what beloved Paul say somewhere John say we are accepted in the do you know who the Beloved is that's the big fellow and he's calling you also what in other word you and the big fellow you are the same he is the Beloved you are a beloved he is God you are [Applause] God I don't know if I'm going to reach the surface my friend listen my friend he says beloved if your heart does what condemn us not then we have what confidence towards God [Applause] when there is no condemnation the devil is in trouble because you and God you have [Applause] confidence confidence of [Music] what confidence of what huh confidence of what huh what is that confidence about confidence of what to give you eternal life he already gave you eternal life you are in the Beloved you are beloved and that thing is finished confidence of what salvation he already saved you so confidence of what salvation is a history holy ghost history word baptism history confidence of what Hallelujah taking the hearing of I don't have one history confidence of what confidence of what he says we have confidence and what we ask we do what we receive of him what do we receive whatsoever we ask what do you receive [Applause] do we have do we have a limit on what to ask [Applause] no so when you are pray in other words John is saying when there is no condemnation your prayer and Heaven are going [Applause] straight because cond Miss make you tremble and the bullet doesn't hit the devil well but when there is no condemnation you zeroed in very well one shoot to [Applause] kill do you see why the devil was upset do you see why he was upset this morning he doesn't want you to understand [Applause] [Music] this we made Christianity a big algebra like it's something complicated it's not Hallelujah and whatsoever we do what we do what receive of him because we keep what his Commandments and do the things that are what pleasing his sight are we together I'm still on the first scripture my friend ye are God all of you are children of the most high God but you under the law of sin and death and it's bringing condemnation sometime you are condemned because of this man the human being part and sometime you are not condemn and when you are not condemned this man [Applause] engage because this man don't like sin he engages are we together are we together are we together are we together let's go to our first second our second scripture oh god

he didn't stop the devil from attacking him but he didn't also stop the effect of my prayer upon Peter h so even if Peter is TR is is is is falling by denying me the prayer of Jesus is following to him that's why when when when when Jesus came from the grave the first Apostle he said where is Peter and he looked at Peter he said Do You Love Me Do You Love Me You Who deny me three times you go feed my sheep not somebody else the one who deny me because pet you are [Music] [Applause] God are we together are we together are we together are we together so if you go through trouble don't don't

world I come where to thee Holy Father in either way I'm going to go to you I'm going to get in the pillar of fire back now Holy Father keep through your own name those to whom you have you have what given me that there may be one one as we are follow me carefully my friends when Jesus come came into this world he said me and my father we are one and when him and the father was one the devil could not handle him that's right every weapon the Devil Comes Jesus knock it off knock it off knock it off now Jesus is about to go Jesus said father I am going but these are staying I'm going to pray for them you know the way you built me the way you built me me and you were one just like the way you make me and you one you see those one make them the same [Applause] way in other word when I leave the world there are other Jesus [Applause] there in other word when the devil will come to them may he feel the same thing he felt with me [Applause] if my level is 100 let that when the devil touch Charles Hamilton he need to fill 100 he need to say is this Charles Hamilton Char who do you hold inside of you great is he that is then he that is make all of them one let me help you up Jesus prayer God answer him how many times let's let me look at your prayer first John chapter what 5 verse what 14 and this is the confidence that we have where in him that if we ask what anything how according to his will he does what Heth us so when you pray there is only one thing you got to make sure when you get your prayer you just take according to your word and you hook it like this and you send it to God when God receive your package when he open according to this way these children just give them what they [Applause] want that's why you need to know the word you need to know the scripture so when you are sending the message you cing it you cing it because he look at that sanctification he said what is it did he put a word there give him these children let's go he say and if we know that what he hears us whatsoever we do what ask we know that we have our petition that we what desire of him there is no missing there Jesus always you God told you how always work because Jesus say do nothing that's right am except that's why his prayer works all the [Applause] time and God give you the same secret but let's look at what he was praying for you he pray he said father do you know the Oneness that me and you have please I want these kids you know I'm leaving the world if I leave them like this the devil the devil will trouble them all the time the only way they can handle the devil they need to be like me is my Bible different let's read it then I'm going to let you go because I cannot finish the scripture I might have to stop in the middle of the scripture we are on 12 we need to go to 24 how can we finish 24 are we together are we together are we together are we together sorry listen he said now verse 11 I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to you Holy Father keep through your own name Those whom you have what given me you do you see Judah there that they may be one as we are one as we are how was Jesus with God one he says I want them also to be one the Catholic interpreted this wrong they say that all the church need to be one that's not what Jesus was saying slow down okay listen to brother brandham brother Bram say I wonder this great thing this ecumenical Cel that we got in the world today and the World Council of churches forming together make us all one I wonder if they realize that is exactly what the scriptures say they will do but they think it is the most what wonderful thing in the world in the world that all of us can join hand and be how one they say Jesus pray that we might be one that is true but not that kind of one my friend I'm heading to the airport so keep your seat belt I'm going to load it okay he said be one as I and the father are one yeah be that kind of one then how will that be the word where in us will be the what anointed word that is the Oneness of what God see the Oneness of God is the word how anointed in you see and then you become a a son a Messiah of the age you become a messiah you are the Messiah of laia you are the Jesus of laia because Jesus is not there he wants Jesus to also continue in the world you are taking his place you didn't get that my friend Father I'm leaving the world these are staying but make them like me so that the devil will always have me the devil got my Eden this is certain Eden if I leave the world there is no me there keep me in them the way he
