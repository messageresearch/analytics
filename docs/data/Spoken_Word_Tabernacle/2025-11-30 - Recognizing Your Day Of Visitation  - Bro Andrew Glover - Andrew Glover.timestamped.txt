[6:38] And we want to thank you for that, Lord.
[6:40] [music] And just ask that you extend it
[6:41] a little bit further, Lord, today, Lord

[7:28] Thanksgiving wasn't just a day Thursday,
[7:30] Lord God. It's for us. It's every
[7:31] [music] day, Lord God, because you have
[7:34] given us so much, Lord God, to be
[7:36] thankful for, Lord Jesus. [music] The
[7:38] life that you've given us, Lord, where

[7:43] [music] the world and even in the church
[7:45] ranks, Lord God, you've done so much for
[7:49] us, Lord God. We've grown so much, Lord
[7:51] Jesus, in this word, Lord God, [music]
[7:54] but we're not completely satisfied, Lord
[7:56] God. And that's why we come in this
[7:58] house every time the doors are open,
[8:00] Lord, that [music] you can just let us
[8:03] just ripen into your presence, Lord God,
[8:05] and just Lord, just get closer to
[8:09] [music] you, Lord God. Lord, manifest
[8:12] yourself, Lord, and vindicate the

[8:18] We love you, Lord Jesus, above all else.
[8:21] Lord, we thank you for your mercy and
[8:22] your [music] grace in our lives, Lord
[8:24] God. We thank you for the love, Lord,
[8:26] that you've not only shown for us, Lord,
[8:28] that that which we can show for others,
[8:30] Lord God. [music]
[8:32] We thank you, Father. We give every
[8:34] portion of this service to you this
[8:36] morning, Lord Jesus. In your precious
[8:39] [music] name, we thank you, Father, in

[49:39] Amen. Let's just approach him this
[49:41] morning. And maybe you have a special
[49:43] need upon your heart, something that you
[49:45] uh would desire from the Lord and from
[49:47] his word this morning. I know if you
[49:49] have a need, he has the answer this
[49:52] morning. So, let's just approach him.
[49:54] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[49:56] have gathered here on this resurrection
[49:58] Sunday morning. Father, we've not
[50:00] gathered here out of tradition. Lord,
[50:02] we've not gathered here out of form or
[50:04] fashion. But Lord, we've gathered here
[50:06] this morning out of a call, a deep
[50:09] calling to the deep. And Lord, your
[50:11] prophet told us that before there was a
[50:13] deep calling to the deep, there had to
[50:15] be a deep to respond. And Lord, before
[50:18] we woke up this morning with that
[50:20] something in our hearts, Lord, hungering
[50:22] and desiring to be in your house. And
[50:25] Lord, to be gathered with believers of
[50:27] like precious faith and Lord, that
[50:29] little something inside of us, oh God,
[50:31] that was desiring for more of you. Lord,
[50:34] we're so thankful to know that there was
[50:36] already more of you for us to have. And
[50:38] Father, as we come here this morning,
[50:40] your prophet has taught us, Lord, that
[50:42] we'll either leave better or we'll leave
[50:44] worse. And Lord, we know this morning
[50:46] that we can leave better because your
[50:48] word is here. And Lord, I pray that you
[50:51] would come among us this morning in a
[50:52] special way. Father, if there would be
[50:55] one bound among us, you said you sent
[50:57] your word. And Lord, your word healed,
[50:59] your word delivered, oh God. And Lord,
[51:02] as your word goes forth this morning,
[51:04] may it bring deliverance to every
[51:05] captive, Lord. May it bring freedom to
[51:08] those who would be bound, oh God. Lord,
[51:10] for those who would be sick, I pray the
[51:12] power of healing, oh God. Lord, by the
[51:14] preaching of your word would flow
[51:16] through their bodies this morning.
[51:18] Father, if there be one at home today,
[51:20] Lord, unable to be here. Maybe one in
[51:22] the hospital laying there in a sick bed
[51:24] that'll hear this service, Lord. Father,
[51:26] may the angel of God passed by that
[51:28] hospital room. And Lord, may you raise
[51:31] them up, oh God. If there be one that's
[51:32] grown cold upon you, Father, and Lord,
[51:35] maybe just somewhere by accident, they
[51:37] would stumble across this sermon, Lord,
[51:39] at this service, I pray a cola of fire,
[51:41] oh God, would come up off the altar of
[51:44] your word, Lord, and it would melt the
[51:46] ice, oh Lord God, off of their hearts,
[51:48] Lord. It would bring that zeal and that
[51:50] passion, Lord, to serve you and bring
[51:52] them back in the house of God before the
[51:54] hour be too late. Lord, we pray you
[51:56] forgive us this morning of our failures.
[51:58] Forgive us of our shortcomings. Lord,
[52:00] may you move me aside, Father. Lord, may
[52:03] you not just be a spectator, but may you
[52:05] take an active part in this service this
[52:07] morning. Lord, may you bring, Lord,
[52:10] revelation to every heart that Lord,
[52:12] when we would leave this place, we would
[52:13] be able to say, "Did not our hearts burn
[52:16] within us?" Not as brother Andrew talked
[52:18] to us along the way, but as you come,
[52:21] oh, the son of man come and spoke to the
[52:23] hearts of your children. Now, Father, we
[52:25] commit this meeting today in thy
[52:27] faithful hands. have your way among us.
[52:29] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[52:32] pray and all the believers says,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles
[52:37] this morning, we want to go to the book
[52:39] of Luke, the book of Luke, the 19th
[52:41] chapter. I want to turn to Luke chapter
[52:44] 19. And then also, we're going to look
[52:46] in 1 Peter chapter 2. Uh Luke chapter
[52:49] 19. You love the Lord this morning. And
[52:53] in the 41st verse of Luke the 19th
[52:56] chapter,
[52:59] and when he was come near, he beheld the
[53:01] city and wept over it. Now notice what
[53:04] he said. If thou hadest known, even thou
[53:09] at least this thy day. Now I want you to
[53:11] notice that when he says, if thou had
[53:13] known, he's speaking of the spiritual
[53:15] ignorance. If thou hadest known even
[53:18] thou at least in this thy day the things
[53:22] which belong unto thy peace. Now I want
[53:24] you to catch here. What he's saying is
[53:26] the things which make for peace. In
[53:29] other words, your peace depends on these
[53:31] things.
[53:33] But now they are hid from your eyes. For
[53:37] the day shall come upon thee, that thine
[53:38] enemy shall cast a trench about thee,
[53:41] and compass thee round, and keep thee in
[53:43] on every side, and shall lay thee even
[53:46] with the ground, and thy children within
[53:48] thee. And they shall not leave in thee
[53:50] one stone upon one another. Now, that's
[53:53] a very dark scene.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And it's all because thou kneest not the
[53:58] time of thy visitation.
[54:02] Thou kneeest not the time of thy
[54:04] visitation. In the book of first Peter,
[54:08] 1 Peter chapter 2. I want to look there
[54:10] in 1 Peter chapter 2
[54:13] and verse number 12. 1 Peter 2
[54:18] and verse 12.
[54:22] Peter here writing, he says, "Having
[54:25] your conversation honest among the
[54:27] Gentiles, that whereas they speak
[54:30] against you as evildoers,
[54:33] they may your they may by your good
[54:35] works which they shall behold glorify
[54:40] God in the day of visitation."
[54:43] glorify God in the day of visitation.
[54:47] So, one generation didn't know their day
[54:49] of visitation, but here's another
[54:51] generation that's going to glorify God
[54:54] in the day of thy visitation. We ask
[54:56] Lord this morning to bless the reading
[54:58] of his word. As you can have your seats
[55:00] here today, uh if the Lord would help me
[55:02] this morning from those passages of
[55:04] scripture today, if I would if I would
[55:06] take a text here to speak to you for a
[55:08] few moments this morning, I want to talk
[55:10] to you on this. Recognizing your day of
[55:13] visitation. recognizing your day of
[55:16] visitation. In the sermon, the uncertain
[55:19] sound, brother Ram's praying and he
[55:20] says, "Heavenly Father," he says, "I
[55:22] pray the prayer for them all with all my
[55:25] heart. I give them to you." He says,
[55:27] "They are trophies of the message."
[55:29] Amen. I love that. They are trophies of
[55:32] the message. He says, "They are trophies
[55:34] of your visitation." They are trophies
[55:38] of your visitation. Being here tonight,
[55:40] seeing you walk among us, Amen. doing
[55:43] the works that has never been done since
[55:45] the foundation of the world until these
[55:47] days. He says, "Here they are." Excuse
[55:51] me.
[55:55] He says, "Here they are. They're your
[55:57] children. I commend them to you, Lord.
[56:00] You give them to us and we give them to
[56:02] you. Now, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[56:05] watch over them and raise them up at the
[56:07] last day." He says, "I may never be able
[56:10] to shake their hands on this earth, but
[56:12] when the battle is over," how many
[56:14] believes that's coming
[56:16] and the last trumpet has sounded and the
[56:18] dead has risen from the grave. He says,
[56:21] "And the live has been called up
[56:23] together with them to meet the Lord in
[56:25] the air. Then may I have fellowship with
[56:27] Jesus Christ and them around the throne
[56:31] and through the eternal ages it is to
[56:33] come." He says, "Grant it, Lord. They
[56:36] are yours in the name of Jesus Christ.
[56:38] Now I love that because the prophet is
[56:41] saying that there has been amen
[56:43] visitation of God in this generation and
[56:46] that visitation has not gone unnoticed
[56:49] by everybody. There has been a lot
[56:51] missing. There has been a lot not
[56:53] acknowledge it. But there will be some
[56:55] amen who will acknowledge it and will
[56:57] recognize what God is doing in the hour
[57:00] they're living. In 1960, brother Ram
[57:02] says, "We've had healings and speaking
[57:04] with tongues and miracles and so forth."
[57:07] He says, "But that visit is what we are
[57:10] looking for tonight." So, amen. We're
[57:12] not looking for healings or the speaking
[57:15] of tongues or the miracles so much.
[57:17] Amen. But it's that visit that we are
[57:19] looking for. Again, is your life worthy
[57:22] of the gospel? When God is making a
[57:24] visit to the church and to the people,
[57:27] receive it then. Amen. When God is
[57:29] making a visit to the church and to the
[57:32] people, receive it then. Don't put it
[57:35] off until next year. Amen. Or the next
[57:38] revival. Receive it right then. Now,
[57:41] amen. You realize that a visitation is a
[57:44] special, amen, dispensation of divine
[57:47] favor or wrath. Amen. Amen. A visitation
[57:50] will either bring the favor of God upon
[57:53] you. Amen. Or it will bring the wrath of
[57:55] God. Now in blind Barnameus brother says
[57:58] Christ is visiting amen the gentile
[58:01] church. Christ is visiting the gentile
[58:04] church. It's the evening lights that's a
[58:06] is shining now. Amen. The prophet said
[58:09] in the evening time it'll be light. Now
[58:12] he said this is the hour. This is the
[58:14] time. And if you'll just take that
[58:16] little some kind of little something
[58:18] that wants to make you kind of halfway
[58:20] believe it. Amen. Or halfway doubt it
[58:22] and brush that thing aside. Amen. And
[58:25] come now. Amen. It's Christ. Amen. Jesus
[58:29] Christ, the son of God. Amen. The same
[58:32] yesterday, today, and forever. Now,
[58:35] amen. You've got to realize that we're
[58:37] not, Amen. fully redeemed. Our souls
[58:39] have been redeemed. Amen. But we're
[58:41] still got that old sticky nature, right?
[58:43] We still got that old carnal flesh
[58:46] nature. Amen. That wants to make us
[58:48] halfway believe and wants to make us
[58:50] halfway doubt. Amen. But you will never
[58:53] receive the benefit of the visitation of
[58:56] God halfway believing. Amen. AND HALFWAY
[58:59] DOUBTING. AMEN. AMEN. YOU'VE EITHER GOT
[59:01] TO FULLY BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AND
[59:04] FULLY DOUBT THE DEVIL. AMEN. OR YOU'RE
[59:06] FULLY BELIEVING the devil AND FULLY
[59:08] DOUBTING THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AMEN. THERE
[59:10] IS NO IN BETWEEN. We're either
[59:12] believers. Amen. Or we're unbelievers. I
[59:15] SAY THIS MORNING, IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A
[59:18] TIME, AMEN, TO FOLD THE THING ASIDE,
[59:21] AMEN, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU DOUBT THE
[59:22] VISITATION OF GOD, AMEN, now is the time
[59:26] to do it. He said, it's been proven God
[59:29] is visiting the people today.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO
[59:34] QUESTION. It's already been proven that
[59:38] God is visiting the people today. HE
[59:41] SAID GOD IS IN HIS CHURCH. AMEN.
[59:44] And he's trying to purge the thing. HE'S
[59:47] TRYING TO TAKE OUT the leaven out of it.
[59:49] HE'S SENDING MESSENGERS AND SIGNS and
[59:51] wonders and miracles, everything trying
[59:54] to prove, amen, that he loves them and
[59:57] he wants them to clean up. Now, amen.
[59:59] When you begin to study in the Bible,
[1:00:01] you will find, amen, that the Bible
[1:00:04] specifically speaks of visitation. In
[1:00:06] the book of Job, the 10th chapter, the
[1:00:08] 12th verse, amen, Job says, "Thou hast
[1:00:11] granted me life and favor." AMEN. AND
[1:00:14] THY visitation has preserved my spirit.
[1:00:19] Amen. In Psalms 102:13, David said,
[1:00:22] "Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon
[1:00:26] Zion." Now, who is Zion? Amen. Zion is a
[1:00:29] type of the bride. Amen. Thou shalt
[1:00:31] arise and have mercy upon Zion. Listen.
[1:00:35] For the time to favor her. [laughter]
[1:00:37] Amen. Amen. The time to favor her. Amen.
[1:00:40] Yay. The set time is come. Amen. This is
[1:00:44] not an accident. AMEN. YOU DID NOT
[1:00:47] stumble into the favor OF GOD. YOU DID
[1:00:49] NOT BUMP INTO THE FAVOR OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:00:52] BUT IF GOD HAS FAVORED your life, AMEN.
[1:00:55] THERE WAS A TIME THAT HE SET FROM BEFORE
[1:00:58] the foundation of the world that HE
[1:01:00] WOULD FAVOR YOU AND YOU'RE LIVING in
[1:01:03] that time. Brother said, "May the power
[1:01:05] reach down and may it pick up the people
[1:01:08] and may it shake them, Lord, and let
[1:01:10] them realize that this is the day of
[1:01:13] their visitation." Listen, this is the
[1:01:16] time, amen, that the Lord HAS SET. AMEN.
[1:01:20] I LOVE THAT. THIS IS NOT A MAN'S
[1:01:21] SCHEDULE. AMEN. AMEN. THIS IS NOT A
[1:01:24] MAN'S TIME, AMEN. This is not a church's
[1:01:27] time. Amen. BUT THIS IS GOD'S TIME.
[1:01:30] AMEN. GOD SET THIS TIME. AMEN. GOD
[1:01:33] ARRANGED THIS TIME THAT GOD WOULD COME
[1:01:36] UNTO THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS. AMEN.
[1:01:38] I think it's powerful. Amen. That every
[1:01:41] generation is going to receive a
[1:01:43] visitation.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you realize what that visitation
[1:01:47] is. Amen. IT'S WHEN THE PROMISES of that
[1:01:50] age, amen, begin to come to pass.
[1:01:53] Brotherson, I thank thee tonight. Amen.
[1:01:55] for the Holy Ghost and for the
[1:01:57] visitation of him right here IN THIS
[1:02:00] BUILDING RIGHT here even right here now.
[1:02:03] The very spirit according to the word of
[1:02:06] God WHICH IS INFALLIBLE AND CANNOT FAIL.
[1:02:10] LISTEN, the same spirit, somebody say
[1:02:12] the same spirit.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that raised Jesus from
[1:02:17] the grave is right here in our midst
[1:02:21] now. Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN.
[1:02:25] THAT'S NOT A REFORMER. AMEN. THAT'S NOT
[1:02:27] A PREACHER. THAT'S A VINDICATED PROPHET
[1:02:30] MAKING A declaration over the CHURCH
[1:02:32] THAT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS
[1:02:35] FROM THE DEAD IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS
[1:02:38] BUILDING THIS MORNING. OR I SAY, WHAT
[1:02:40] DEVIL CAN HOLD YOU? I SAY, WHAT SPIRIT
[1:02:43] CAN BIND YOU? I SAY, WHAT CHAIN OF
[1:02:46] UNBELIEF, AMEN, CAN LIMIT YOUR FAITH IN
[1:02:49] THE HOUSE OF GOD? LISTEN, THE SAME
[1:02:51] SPIRIT THAT RAISED OUR LORD FROM THE
[1:02:53] DEAD is right here in this building this
[1:02:56] morning confirming his word. Amen. If
[1:02:59] there's ever been A TIME, AMEN. NOW'S
[1:03:02] THE TIME TO BELIEVE, AMEN, to realize
[1:03:05] the seriousness.
[1:03:08] TO REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE
[1:03:11] VISITATION of God. Amen. I tell you what
[1:03:13] a prophet said. HE SAID, "MAY MEN AND
[1:03:15] WOMEN EVERYWHERE REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS
[1:03:18] of this visitation of God." AMEN. THE
[1:03:21] GOSPEL is being preached like it was in
[1:03:24] the days of Noah. AMEN. IT'S FANATICISM
[1:03:27] TO THE WORLD, but it's glorious and it's
[1:03:30] welcome to those who are willing to come
[1:03:33] in. He said, "NOW WE COME INTO THE ARK
[1:03:36] OF SAFETY, AND THE ark of safety is
[1:03:39] Christ." AMEN. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE
[1:03:41] THIS. AMEN. THAT ZION IS A TYPE of the
[1:03:44] bride, right? Amen. Then I can say unto
[1:03:46] you, amen, that your time of favor is
[1:03:50] NOT COMING. AMEN. YOUR TIME OF FAVOR HAS
[1:03:53] NOT BEEN HERE. AMEN. BUT YOUR TIME of
[1:03:56] favor IS NOW. AMEN. NOW IS THE TIME OF
[1:04:00] DIVINE FAVOR FOR THE SONS AND THE
[1:04:03] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. COME ON. WE'RE NOT A
[1:04:05] BUNCH OF CATHOLICS. AMEN. Putting this
[1:04:07] IN THE FUTURE. AMEN. MY BIBLE SAYS NOW
[1:04:11] WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD.
[1:04:15] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORD NOW MEANS? THAT
[1:04:18] WORD NOW MEANS AT THIS TIME. AMEN. AT
[1:04:21] THIS PRESENT MOMENT. AMEN. LISTEN. NOT
[1:04:24] FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW. NOT 30 MINUTES
[1:04:26] FROM NOW. NOT WHEN THE ALTAR IS OPEN.
[1:04:29] AMEN. NOT WHEN ANOTHER PREACHER SHOWS
[1:04:31] UP. BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE THE SONS AND
[1:04:34] THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD. LISTEN THEN. IF
[1:04:36] YOU ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD,
[1:04:39] THAT EVERY PROMISE THAT IS LAID IN THE
[1:04:41] LAND OF INHERITANCE, AMEN, BELONGS UNTO
[1:04:44] THE SEED OF ALMIGHTY GOD. LISTEN, I'LL
[1:04:46] TELL YOU, NOW IS THE HOUR. AMEN. NOW IS
[1:04:49] THE TIME. AMEN. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED
[1:04:52] HOUR. LISTEN, THIS IS NOW THE ACCEPTABLE
[1:04:55] year of the Lord. HE SAID, NOW IS WHEN
[1:04:58] HEALING IS SUPPOSED TO BE. NOW IS WHEN
[1:05:02] MIRACLES TAKE PLACE. NOW, ARE YOU
[1:05:04] HEARING ME? NOW IS WHEN CHRIST IS
[1:05:08] REVEALING HIMSELF. AMEN. NOT TOMORROW,
[1:05:12] NOT NEXT WEEK. AMEN. BUT RIGHT NOW, THE
[1:05:15] SON OF MAN IS ALIVE [screaming]
[1:05:18] AND WELL IN THE POWER OF HIS
[1:05:20] RESURRECTION, REVEALING HIMSELF,
[1:05:22] CONFIRMING HIS WORD. These things are
[1:05:25] not in the future. He said, "Here we
[1:05:28] are." Now,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "REVELATION'S COMING." NO
[1:05:32] REVELATION'S HERE.
[1:05:35] Come on. SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, THE
[1:05:37] PROPHET'S COMING." NO, THE MESSAGE IS
[1:05:39] HERE. AMEN. The things that we are
[1:05:41] seeing today, BROTHER SAID, COULD NOT
[1:05:43] HAPPEN 20 YEARS AGO.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful point. AMEN. IT COULD
[1:05:49] NOT HAPPEN 40 YEARS AGO. It's today. It
[1:05:53] happens. THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS THE
[1:05:57] TIME. He said, "NOW IT'S THE TIME. IT'S
[1:06:01] FULFILLED." AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE GOD
[1:06:03] PROMISED it
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; and here it is.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; MY THEN TO THINK, AMEN, THAT THIS IS THE
[1:06:11] HOUR THAT A PROPHET. NOW YOU SAY,
[1:06:13] PREACHER, AMEN, you said these things
[1:06:15] COULDN'T BE DONE 20 YEARS AGO OR 40
[1:06:17] YEARS AGO. YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:06:19] REMEMBER THE PROPHET OF GOD STOOD THERE
[1:06:21] AND HE PREACHED THE MESSAGE, THE
[1:06:22] INDICTMENT. REMEMBER THAT? AND HE SAID
[1:06:24] THERE THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. He said, "See,
[1:06:27] I couldn't preach this six months ago."
[1:06:29] He said, "But I CAN PREACH IT NOW."
[1:06:31] AMEN. WELL, I COULD LISTEN. THINGS HAVE
[1:06:33] GOT TO LINE UP, FOLKS. AMEN. THINGS HAVE
[1:06:35] GOT TO HAPPEN. AND WHEN THINGS HAPPEN,
[1:06:38] AMEN. IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENINGS, BUT
[1:06:41] THERE'S A MEANING BEHIND WHAT'S
[1:06:43] HAPPENING.
[1:06:45] COME ON. THERE'S A MEANING BEHIND WHAT'S
[1:06:48] HAPPENING. DO YOU KNOW WHY HE COULDN'T
[1:06:49] PREACH THAT 6 MONTHS AGO? BECAUSE the
[1:06:52] word had to
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU ALL KNOW WHEN JESUS WAS
[1:06:57] CRUCIFIED, AMEN. Today the movie
[1:07:00] writers, AMEN, THEY COVER HIM BUT IN
[1:07:02] REALITY HE WAS HANGING THERE IN PLAIN
[1:07:05] VIEW. HE WAS FULLY EXPOSED. AMEN. THERE
[1:07:08] WAS NOTHING HIDING HIM. HE WAS HANGING
[1:07:10] THERE. AMEN. DO YOU REALIZE WHY THE
[1:07:12] PROPHET SAID, "AMEN. THEY CRUCIFIED
[1:07:15] HIM." BECAUSE THE WORD WAS FULLY THERE.
[1:07:18] AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. HE SAID, "I
[1:07:20] COULDN'T PREACH THE INDICTMENT 6 MONTHS
[1:07:22] AGO, BUT I CAN PREACH IT NOW." YOU KNOW
[1:07:24] WHY? BECAUSE THE WORD HAD BEEN OPENED BY
[1:07:28] THE PREACHING OF THE SEVEN SEALS AND THE
[1:07:31] WORD WAS IN FULL VIEW. OH CHURCH OF the
[1:07:34] living God,
[1:07:37] LET ME SAY IT AS PLAIN AS I KNOW HOW.
[1:07:39] THIS MESSAGE IS NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS
[1:07:42] BRIDE IS NOT AN ACCIDENT. SHE IS HERE.
[1:07:45] SHE HAS STEPPED FROM THE PAGES OF THE
[1:07:47] BIBLE. SHE IS FULFILLING THE word spoke
[1:07:50] of her IN THE HOUR THAT SHE'S LIVING IN.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I LOVE WHAT A PROPHET says
[1:07:57] at the end of his sermon, the token.
[1:07:59] He's praying and he SAYS, "NOW, NOW I
[1:08:01] WANT Y'ALL TO HEAR THIS, OKAY?" He's at
[1:08:03] the end of the token and he's praying
[1:08:06] AND HE SAYS, "IF THERE BE A SEED
[1:08:07] ANYWHERE,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; if there be a seed anywhere
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; that's predestinated,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS,"LORD, TO HEAR THE word
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; of this last day,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; may they COME NOW.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; MAY THEY COME NOW
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; sweetly and humbly and lay their
[1:08:31] trophies down at the cross.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH HIM TURN A CORNER OR THEIR
[1:08:36] YOURSELF AS A TROPHY. [cheering]
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT YOU BRINGING something and
[1:08:44] laying it AT THE ALTAR, BUT IT'S YOU
[1:08:46] YOURSELF.
[1:08:48] SEE A TROPHY OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT'S
[1:08:52] CALLED THEM AND MAY THEY BE FILLED WITH
[1:08:54] THE HOLY SPIRIT AND DISPLAY THE TOKEN OF
[1:08:58] THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN HIS
[1:09:01] RESURRECTION AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN HERE
[1:09:05] ON THE EARTH. NOW I WANT Y'ALL TO CATCH
[1:09:07] SOMETHING. A TROPHY IS TO BE DISPLAYED.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A TROPHY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU GET
[1:09:14] AND HIDE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU GET AND
[1:09:17] PUT IN A CORNER. AMEN. BUT IT'S
[1:09:19] SOMETHING
[1:09:21] IT'S SOMETHING YOU DISPLAY. AMEN. NOW
[1:09:23] LOOK AT WHAT THIS WORD TROPHY MEANS. It
[1:09:26] means something gained, achieved, or
[1:09:28] given in victory
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; or conquest, ESPECIALLY WHEN PRESERVED
[1:09:34] OR MOUNTED AS A MEMORIAL AS A
[1:09:38] REPRESENTATION OF SUCH A MEMORIAL. AMEN.
[1:09:40] NOW LISTEN. A TROPHY IS A game animal or
[1:09:45] a fish
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUITABLE FOR MOUNTING AS A
[1:09:50] TROPHY. NOW COME ON FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW
[1:09:53] I'M IN THE MESSAGE. THERE WAS A FIRST
[1:09:55] PULL
[1:09:57] AND IT GOT SOME LITTLE FISH. AND THERE
[1:10:00] WAS A SECOND PULL AND IT BROUGHT SOME
[1:10:02] MORE LITTLE FISH. BUT THERE WAS A THIRD
[1:10:04] PULL AND IT SCATTERED THE LITTLE FISH
[1:10:08] BUT IT GATHERED THE RAINBOW TROUT.
[1:10:12] COME ON. YOU DON'T MOUNT A LITTLE
[1:10:13] BLUEGILL. YOU DON'T MOUNT A LITTLE A
[1:10:16] LITTLE CARP. AMEN. YOU MOUNT A RAINBOW
[1:10:19] TROUT. YOU MOUNT SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH
[1:10:22] MOUNTING. OH, MAY I SAY UNTO YOU, WHEN
[1:10:24] GOD HOOKED YOU WITH THIS MESSAGE. IT WAS
[1:10:27] NOT JUST FOR A MEETING. [laughter] IT
[1:10:29] WAS NOT FOR JUST A YEAR. IT WAS NOT FOR
[1:10:31] JUST A GOOD SERVICE. IT WAS FOR the
[1:10:33] rapture of THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:10:37] WE'RE GOING HOME AND THERE AIN'T NOTHING
[1:10:40] THE DEVIL CAN DO ABOUT IT. [cheering]
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; A trophy SIR
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; IS AN EXPRESSED ATTRIBUTE OF VICTORY.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; When you see a trophy, it is the
[1:10:55] display.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF VICTORY. NOW,
[1:10:59] BROTHER SAID GOD HAD A SECRET MYSTERY.
[1:11:02] HE SAID NOW IT WAS IN THE BACK PART OF
[1:11:04] HIS MIND. THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WAS
[1:11:07] TRYING AND WAS GOING to achieve.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing it.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; In order to let himself be expressed
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID NOW THERE WASN'T A STAR, A MO, A
[1:11:25] MOLECULE OR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS GOD.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; So in his great mind he wanted these
[1:11:32] attributes to be expressed. See, in him
[1:11:35] was love. In him was TO BE A FATHER. IN
[1:11:39] HIM WAS TO be a son. In him was to be a
[1:11:42] savior. In him was to BE A HEALER. BUT
[1:11:45] THERE WAS NOTHING THERE THAT COULD
[1:11:47] MANIFEST THE VICTORY OF THOSE
[1:11:49] ATTRIBUTES.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN LOST,
[1:11:54] FOLKS. The angels HAD NEVER BEEN SICK.
[1:11:58] THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN BOUND BY
[1:12:00] DRUGS. THE ANGELS HAD NEVER BEEN BOUND
[1:12:02] BY COMPLEXES. AMEN. BUT IN HIM WAS THE
[1:12:06] ATTRIBUTE TO BE A SAVIOR. IN HIM WAS THE
[1:12:10] ATTRIBUTE TO BE A DELIVERER. IN HIM WAS
[1:12:13] THE ATTRIBUTE TO BE A DELIVERER. COME
[1:12:14] ON, CHURCH. AND I CAN SAY TO YOU THIS
[1:12:17] MORNING, AMEN. WHAT THE ANGELS COULDN'T
[1:12:19] GIVE HIM, HIS BRIDE CAN. WHAT THE ANGELS
[1:12:22] COULDN'T PULL OUT OF HIM, HIS BRIDE HAS
[1:12:25] PULLED OUT OF HIM. LISTEN, I KNOW YOU
[1:12:27] MAY THINK YOU'RE A FAILURE. I KNOW YOU
[1:12:30] MAY THINK YOU'RE WORTHLESS. I KNOW YOU
[1:12:32] MAY THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT,
[1:12:33] BUT I'VE GOT THE WORD OF THE LORD. YOU
[1:12:36] ARE A TROPHY OF THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:12:39] [screaming]
[1:12:40] WHEN THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE HAD YOU, WHEN
[1:12:42] THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE WAS TAKING YOU DOWN
[1:12:44] FOR THE FINAL TIME, THERE WAS A SEED IN
[1:12:47] your soul.
[1:12:51] And today, YOU ARE NOTHING BUT THE
[1:12:53] MANIFESTATION OF THE GENE of life THAT
[1:12:57] WAS IN GOD.
[1:12:59] HALLELUJAH. He says, "WHEN THE WORD OF
[1:13:01] GOD, AMEN, lit our souls, WHEN THE WORD
[1:13:05] OF GOD LIT OUR SOULS, we become the SONS
[1:13:09] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD." NOW, AMEN. IF
[1:13:12] YOU, IF YOU STUDY MUCH IN the message,
[1:13:14] Amen, brother speaks a lot about
[1:13:15] trophies.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And it's usually IN PRAYER, AND I JUST
[1:13:19] TOOK TIME TO LIST IT. HE SAYS, "TROPHIES
[1:13:22] OF THE MESSAGE." AMEN. TROPHIES OF THE
[1:13:25] PRESENCE OF THE LORD. Trophies of the
[1:13:28] grace of God. Trophies of the spirit of
[1:13:31] grace. TROPHIES OF THIS REVIVAL.
[1:13:34] Trophies of CHRIST'S LOVE AT CALVARY.
[1:13:38] AMEN. TROPHIES OF THE GOSPEL THAT'S BEEN
[1:13:40] PREACHED. AMEN. I LOVE THIS ONE.
[1:13:42] TROPHIES OF YOUR WORD BEING MADE
[1:13:45] MANIFEST. Preached by the spirit of the
[1:13:48] Lord.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; TROPHIES OF THE MESSAGE. TROPHIES OF THE
[1:13:53] EVENING LIGHT TIME. OH, THIS IS ONE OF
[1:13:55] MY FAVORITE. TROPHIES OF THE MINISTRY OF
[1:13:59] THE SEVENTH ANGEL.
[1:14:03] I'M NOT A FANATIC. I'M A TROPHY. I'M
[1:14:06] [screaming] NOT A MAN FOLLOWER. I AM A
[1:14:09] TROPHY OF THE RESTORING GRACE OF
[1:14:12] ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HAS COME IN MY
[1:14:14] GENERATION. WELL, GLORY TO GOD. YOU'VE
[1:14:17] LEFT THE DEVIL LABEL YOU A FANATIC.
[1:14:19] YOU'VE LEFT THE DEVIL LABEL YOU A C.
[1:14:21] WON'T YOU TAKE THAT DEVIL'S LABEL OFF
[1:14:23] AND PUT YOUR real label on? a trophy.
[1:14:28] [cheering]
[1:14:31] TROPHIES ARE NOT OBJECTS, FOLKS. THEY'RE
[1:14:33] PEOPLE.
[1:14:35] And and I AND AND I JUST SAY THIS JUST
[1:14:37] TO JUST TO LAY this in there. When
[1:14:39] brother Brand REFERS TO TROPHIES, I LOVE
[1:14:41] HOW HE CONNECTS THESE SCRIPTURES to
[1:14:43] them. IN ST. JOHN 5:24 HE SAYS, "HE that
[1:14:47] heareth my word trophy
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; AND BELIEVETH ON HIM THAT SENT me hath
[1:14:54] everlasting life AND SHALL NOT COME INTO
[1:14:57] CONDEMNATION,
[1:14:59] [cheering]
[1:15:00] but is passed FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE."
[1:15:04] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; JOHN 6:37, "ALL THE FATHER GIVETH ME
[1:15:09] SHALL COME, and him trophy."
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; THAT COMETH TO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE
[1:15:16] CAST OUT.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; ST. JOHN 10:28, I GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL
[1:15:21] LIFE, AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH.
[1:15:24] TROPHY, neither shall any man PLUCK
[1:15:28] THEM. TROPHY OUT OF MY HAND. MY FATHER
[1:15:33] WHICH gave them ME TROPHY IS GREATER
[1:15:36] THAN ALL AND NO MAN IS ABLE TO PLUCK
[1:15:39] THEM TROPHY OUT OF [screaming] MY
[1:15:42] FATHER'S HAND. [cheering]
[1:15:44] OH CHURCH THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID YOU
[1:15:47] ARE TROPHIES THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO HIS
[1:15:50] SON CHRIST JESUS BY THE POWER OF HIS
[1:15:54] PRESENCE AND THE WORD OF GOD. WHAT IS
[1:15:57] THIS MESSAGE? IT IS THE RETURN OF THE
[1:16:00] POWER OF GOD AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:16:05] BY [screaming] THE WORD OF GOD. SEE,
[1:16:08] THEN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS MORE
[1:16:09] THAN A GOOD IDEA.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S MORE THAN A SUGGESTION, BUT THE
[1:16:14] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS A CLAIMING
[1:16:16] MESSAGE.
[1:16:18] Come on. CAN I CAN I SAY WHAT A PROPHET
[1:16:20] SAID? HE SAID, "I CLAIM THEM FOR YOU
[1:16:22] TONIGHT, JESUS. AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL
[1:16:25] TREASURE, AS GEMS IN YOUR CROWN, AS
[1:16:28] MEMBERS OF YOUR BRIDE, I claim
[1:16:30] [screaming] their LIVES
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; NOW. NOW, COME ON, FOLKS. What is
[1:16:35] claiming you?"
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAINTS. WHAT IS CLAIMING YOU?
[1:16:41] AMEN. SOME OF THE SOME OF YOU ALL COME
[1:16:43] IN UNDER A PREACHER THAT AIN'T EVEN
[1:16:45] PREACHING THIS MESSAGE NO MORE.
[1:16:49] WHAT claimed you?
[1:16:54] It's
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; kind of funny. These guys get so big
[1:16:56] they don't need brother Brandham no more
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and they go over TO AFRICA AND TAKE
[1:17:00] TOURS.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; WELL, I might as well preach. THEY GO
[1:17:04] OVER TO AFRICA AND TAKE TOURS. AMEN.
[1:17:07] TRYING TO PROVE THE MESSAGE IS WRONG.
[1:17:08] BUDDY, NOBODY WOULD KNOW YOUR NAME
[1:17:10] WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE.
[1:17:12] [cheering]
[1:17:14] SEE,
[1:17:16] NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO YOU ARE WITHOUT
[1:17:18] THIS MESSAGE. SO, IT WASN'T A MAN
[1:17:21] CLAIMING YOU.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T A CHURCH CLAIMING YOU. THAT'S
[1:17:26] WHY MEN SAY, "IF YOU LEAVE ME, YOU'LL
[1:17:28] NOT MAKE IT." BUT I'M STILL HERE.
[1:17:32] THAT THAT THAT'S WHY PREACHERS, THEY GET
[1:17:35] UNDER THIS IDEA. WE DON'T NEED TO QUOTE
[1:17:36] BROTHER BRANDHAM. AND IF YOU QUOTE
[1:17:38] BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU WON'T HAVE A PULL
[1:17:40] PIT. WELL, I'LL STAND ON A ROCK AND
[1:17:42] QUOTE, "BROTHER BRANDON, THIS MESSAGE
[1:17:44] CLAIMED ME." [cheering]
[1:17:47] I WASN'T CLAIMED BY SOME PERSONALITY. I
[1:17:50] WASN'T CLAIMED BY SOME CAMP MEETING. I
[1:17:52] WAS CLAIMED.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID,
[1:17:56] "MAY EVERY CALLED CHILD OF GOD THAT'S IN
[1:17:59] HEARING DISTANCE OF HERE or either the
[1:18:01] tape SHALL STRIKE, MAY AT THAT TIME,
[1:18:04] COME ON CHURCH, MAY AT THAT TIME I CLAIM
[1:18:08] THEM FOR THE kingdom of God [cheering]
[1:18:12] UPON THE BASIS OF KNOWING THIS, THE word
[1:18:16] that's being revealed."
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Now, now, NOW THAT'S WHY I STILL BELIEVE
[1:18:22] IN THE CLOUD.
[1:18:27] BROTHER KIMMA, BECAUSE A MAN EXPLAINING
[1:18:29] IT DID NOT CLAIM ME.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; THE NEWS ARTICLE DID NOT CLAIM ME.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOME SCIENTIST OUT THERE TRYING
[1:18:40] TO EXPLAIN IT. DIDN'T CLAIM ME. I'LL
[1:18:42] TELL YOU WHAT CLAIMED ME. THE REVELATION
[1:18:44] OF IT. BECAUSE REVELATION IS GREATER
[1:18:47] THAN EDUCATION. IT'S GREATER THAN
[1:18:50] SENSATION. IT'S GREATER THAN
[1:18:52] INTELLECTUALISM. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:18:54] GOD, PRAY TO GOD FOR A REVELATION BY THE
[1:18:58] SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:19:01] I'LL JUST SAY THIS. YOU DIDN'T CLAIM
[1:19:03] THIS MESSAGE.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE claimed you. [cheering]
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; AND IT CLAIMED YOU ON PURPOSE
[1:19:13] FOR A PURPOSE BY A PURPOSE. LISTEN, YOU
[1:19:17] WERE NOT CLAIMED BY ACCIDENT. YOU WERE
[1:19:20] CLAIMED IN THIS AGE to be a trophy.
[1:19:26] [cheering]
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say THIS TO YOU. NO MAN CAN
[1:19:31] TALK US OUT OF IT
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN DIDN'T CLAIM US.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; REVELATION CLAIMED US.
[1:19:44] THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH THINGS
[1:19:46] THAT SHOOK YOU TO THE CORE, YOU'RE STILL
[1:19:48] STANDING. [cheering]
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REVELATION GOT A HOLD OF YOU.
[1:19:55] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:19:56] REVELATION GOT A HOLD OF ME AND IT WON'T
[1:19:59] TURN ME LOOSE. ON MY GOOD DAYS, I'VE GOT
[1:20:01] IT. ON MY BAD DAYS, I'VE GOT IT. WHEN
[1:20:04] I'M ON THE MOUNTAIN, I'VE GOT IT. WHEN
[1:20:06] I'M IN THE VALLEY, I'VE GOT IT. THIS IS
[1:20:09] NOT A CHURCH. THIS IS NOT A
[1:20:11] DENOMINATION. IT'S A REVELATION FROM THE
[1:20:14] WORD OF GOD AND IT HAS CLAIMED ME FOR
[1:20:17] ITS FULFILLMENT.
[1:20:19] [cheering and applause]
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD IN SIN.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I WAS BURIED IN TRESPASSES AND THIS
[1:20:29] MESSAGE WALKED INTO THE GRAVEYARD OF MY
[1:20:32] LIFE AND CALLED MY NAME. [cheering]
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW FOLKS, YOU ALL know what Paul
[1:20:40] said. He said, "Ye were dead in sin and
[1:20:43] trespasses,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; but hath been quickened together with
[1:20:48] Christ,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; quickened." [applause]
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I love that word dead. It means
[1:20:52] spiritually dead.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It means you're destitute
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; of a life that recognizes
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; and is devoted to God.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; You are inactive.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? YOU ARE DESTITUTE
[1:21:09] OF FORCE OR POWER.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; You are inactive. You are inoperative.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Now, BROTHER B SAID, HERE IS THOSE who
[1:21:18] were dead.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Were dead
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; and has been raised up.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; THERE IS THOSE WHO WERE IN ACCIDENTS.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SMASHED UP, BUT THEY'RE
[1:21:28] HEALED.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; OH, church of the living God. I can
[1:21:33] leave that in the natural, BUT WHY NOT
[1:21:34] BRING IT to the spiritual? AMEN. SOME OF
[1:21:37] Y'ALL BEEN IN SPIRITUAL CAR WRECKS. Come
[1:21:40] on. You is
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL CAR WRECKS. AMEN. SOME
[1:21:45] PREACHER WAS DRIVING AND HE GOT HIS EYES
[1:21:47] OFF THE MESSAGE AND HE DROVE YOU IN A
[1:21:49] DENT SOMEWHERE. AMEN. AND THE DEVIL
[1:21:51] TRIED TO SMASH YOU UP. HE TRIED TO SMASH
[1:21:54] YOUR FAMILY UP. HE TRIED TO SMASH YOUR
[1:21:56] FAITH UP. BUT HERE YOU ARE TODAY.
[1:22:00] [cheering]
[1:22:01] SEE, BROTHER SAID ALL AROUND HERE, LAME,
[1:22:04] BLIND, CRIPPLED, in wheelchairs,
[1:22:06] everything. But they're standing tonight
[1:22:08] AS LIVING TROPHIES. WHY? IT'S JESUS
[1:22:12] CHRIST WHO LIVES THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:22:15] TODAY, AND FOREVER. AMEN. I WANT TO SAY
[1:22:18] THIS. IN THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN,
[1:22:21] THERE HAS been innumerable
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; innumerable
[1:22:27] SUPERNATURAL MANIFESTATIONS.
[1:22:31] that have been done through THE
[1:22:34] VISITATION
[1:22:35] OF THE ANGEL OF GOD.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, I GUESS IN
[1:22:39] CANADA ALONE, [clears throat]
[1:22:41] THERE WAS AT LEAST 250 OR MAYBE MORE
[1:22:44] CASES OF CROSSEYED PEOPLE WITH THEIR
[1:22:47] EYES STRAIGHTENED,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; MUTE, INNUMERABLE TO COUNT THEM, FOR
[1:22:53] THERE WAS MULTIPLIED SCORES OF THEM that
[1:22:56] came. There were some deaf, THERE WERE
[1:22:59] SOME DUMB, THERE WERE SOME HEART OF
[1:23:01] HEARING, BUT EVERYTHING THERE WERE MADE
[1:23:05] PERFECTLY WHOLE.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; SEE, NOW THAT'S ONLY DONE THROUGH the
[1:23:10] visitation of the angel.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE ANGEL, YOU'RE DEAD. WITHOUT
[1:23:18] THE ANGEL, YOU'RE DESTITUTE OF FORCE AND
[1:23:21] POWER. LISTEN. BUT WHAT GOD DOES IS GOD
[1:23:24] GIVES A FOREWARNING SIGN OF HIS
[1:23:27] VISITATION. AMEN. NOW LET ME SAY THIS.
[1:23:29] THE FIRST POOL AND THE SECOND POOL WAS
[1:23:31] NOT THE BRIDE'S POOL.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; THE THIRD POOL WAS THE POOL THAT
[1:23:37] BELONGED TO THE BRIDE. SO THE FIRST AND
[1:23:40] SECOND POOL WERE THE PREPARING years or
[1:23:43] they were the forewarning signs of the
[1:23:46] oncoming visitation. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD
[1:23:50] DOES NOT SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. BROTHER
[1:23:56] SAYS, "IF I COME HERE TO PHOENIX IN THE
[1:23:58] NAME OF A PROPHET AND I DO NOT THE
[1:24:00] THINGS that a prophet does, then don't
[1:24:03] believe me.
[1:24:06] BUT IF I COME IN THE NAME OF the Lord
[1:24:09] Jesus, IN THE NAME OF PROPHECY, AND AS
[1:24:12] HIS SERVANT, I DO THE THINGS THAT'S
[1:24:15] written of his servant, then you believe
[1:24:17] me. Will you do that? LISTEN. IF THE
[1:24:21] DEAF DON'T HEAR, HEY,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; IF THE DUMB DON'T SPEAK,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; IF THE BLIND DON'T SEE,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; IF THE CRIPPLES DON'T WALK, IF
[1:24:33] PROPHECIES OF SIN ISN'T FORETOLD, THE
[1:24:36] PEOPLE AND YOUR SINS FROM THE TIME YOU
[1:24:39] WAS A CHILD FORETOLD, THEN believe that
[1:24:42] THIS ANGEL THAT COME TO ME IS FALSE.
[1:24:44] UH-HUH.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; NOW, you want to put Brother Ramy's
[1:24:49] ministry on trial? Let's preach a
[1:24:50] minute.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; AND I'M FALSE WITH IT.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S A MINISTRY I CAN FOLLOW.
[1:25:00] [cheering]
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; I HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING A MINISTRY
[1:25:05] FOR 40 YEARS, TELLING me something was
[1:25:07] right, and all of a sudden it was wrong,
[1:25:08] and now I'm supposed to follow it.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; MOVING ON. [laughter]
[1:25:14] BUT IF IT MANIFESTS ITSELF HERE ON THE
[1:25:17] PLATFORM
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU, you believe it and repent of
[1:25:22] your sins
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; AND DISBELIEF FOR THE HOUR OF HIS
[1:25:28] VISITATION IS DRAWING NEAR. HE ONLY DOES
[1:25:32] THOSE THINGS TO CONFIRM HIS WORD. SO
[1:25:35] WHAT WAS IT? ALL THAT WAS IN GOD, HE
[1:25:39] POURED INTO CHRIST. AND ALL THAT WAS IN
[1:25:42] CHRIST HAS BEEN POURED INTO YOU.
[1:25:44] REMEMBER WHAT JESUS SAID? HE SAID, "IT'S
[1:25:47] NOT ME THAT DOETH THE WORKS." BUT THE
[1:25:50] FATHER THAT DWELLETH IN ME, HE DOES THE
[1:25:53] WORKS. LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. NOW IN JESUS
[1:25:56] MINISTRY, HE SAID, "I DON'T DO THE
[1:25:59] WORKS, THE FATHER DOES IT."
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And greater works than this shall ye do.
[1:26:07] Now let me just say what what the Bible
[1:26:09] says in St. JOHN 21:25. AND there are
[1:26:13] also many other things
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; which Jesus did
[1:26:19] [cheering]
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; the WHICH
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; IF THEY SHOULD be written EVERYONE
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; I SUPPOSE EVEN THE WORLD
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; COULD NOT CONTAIN THE BOOKS.
[1:26:40] I got that devil right where I want him.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN THE BOOKS COULD CONTAIN WHAT
[1:26:45] HAD BEEN DONE. B SAID, "NOW, HERE'S WHAT
[1:26:47] I WANT TO SAY OF MY OWN MINISTRY. HE'S
[1:26:50] HAD MORE SUCCESS
[1:26:53] [cheering and applause]
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; in my ministry than HE DID IN HIS OWN."
[1:27:00] NOW REMEMBER, HE HAD MORE SUCCESS.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; NOT ME. HE HE HAD MORE SUCCESS IN
[1:27:08] JEFFERSONVILLE THAN HE DID IN NAZARETH.
[1:27:11] HE FINALLY BROKE THROUGH. HE HAD MORE
[1:27:15] SUCCESS RIGHT HERE IN JEFFERSONVILLE
[1:27:17] THAN CAPERNIUM OR NAZARETH. HE SAID,
[1:27:20] "NOW REMEMBER, he
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; he IT'S NEVER SAID I DONE IT CUZ I
[1:27:26] DIDN'T DO IT. I JUST LOVED HIM,
[1:27:30] [cheering and applause]
[1:27:32] SUBMITTED MYSELF TO HIM AND SAID WHAT HE
[1:27:35] SAID. THE HOLY SPIRIT WENT TO THE OTHER
[1:27:39] PEOPLE AND THEY BELIEVED what he said
[1:27:43] and then he DONE THE WORK.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, MAY I
[1:27:49] ANNOUNCE UNTO YOU THIS MORNING THAT SAME
[1:27:51] SPIRIT IS RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING
[1:27:54] THIS MORNING. THE ANGEL OF GOD IS STILL
[1:27:57] WITH THIS MESSAGE. HE'S STILL DISCERNING
[1:28:00] HEARTS. HE'S STILL FORETELLING THINGS.
[1:28:03] HE'S STILL HEALING THE SICK. HE'S STILL
[1:28:06] SAVING THE LOST. HE'S STILL FILLING WITH
[1:28:08] THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE
[1:28:11] VISIT OF A MAN. IT'S THE VISITATION OF
[1:28:15] ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:28:20] Luke 19, 1 Peter 2 is all speaking of
[1:28:24] the day of visitation,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; the hour of visitation, the time of
[1:28:29] visitation. Now, IT'S ALSO CALLED THE
[1:28:32] DAY OF SALVATION. I WANT Y'ALL TO NOTICE
[1:28:34] THIS. IT'S THE HOUR OF visitation was
[1:28:37] speaking of the coming of the Messiah.
[1:28:41] Now, I want you to watch this. the very
[1:28:44] presence of God's Messiah,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; the son of God himself.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he only appears to those
[1:28:57] who are looking for him.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; HE ONLY APPEARS TO THOSE who are looking
[1:29:07] for him. NOW YOU SAY, "PREACHER, THEN
[1:29:10] I'VE GOT TO BE OF SOME STATUS OR I'VE
[1:29:13] GOT TO HAVE SOME PRESTIGIOUS APPROACH."
[1:29:15] WELL, LOOK AT THE WOMAN AT the well.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IN JOHN
[1:29:20] 4:25? THE WOMAN SAITH UNTO HIM, I KNOW
[1:29:25] THAT MESSIAH COMETH, WHICH IS CALLED
[1:29:28] CHRIST. I KNOW THAT THE VERY GOD HIMSELF
[1:29:34] HAS COME IN THE FLESH OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:29:38] NOW I WANT Y'ALL TO WATCH THIS. OKAY,
[1:29:40] LOOK AT THAT WORD KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT IT
[1:29:43] MEANS? IT means to see. It means to have
[1:29:47] an interview. It means to visit.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH THROUGH THE
[1:29:57] MESSIAH DISCERNMENT WAS THE MESSIAH
[1:30:01] VISITING WITH INDIVIDUALS.
[1:30:05] OH, church of the living God.
[1:30:09] HOW ELSE CAN I SAY IT BUT THIS DAY, THIS
[1:30:12] SCRIPTURE HAS BEEN FULFILLED. THE
[1:30:15] MESSIAH HAS RETURNED in this generation
[1:30:19] AND HAS VISITED WITH THE NEEDS OF GOD'S
[1:30:22] PEOPLE.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON. I LISTEN TO TAPES. I'VE HEARD A
[1:30:27] PROPHET STAND THERE AND SAY THESE WORDS.
[1:30:30] HE SAID, "NOW LOOK," HE SAID, "YOU'RE
[1:30:31] NOT THE WOMAN AT the well, right?" He
[1:30:33] said, "It's another woman at the well
[1:30:35] situation." He said, "You're not the
[1:30:37] woman at the well. You're not she." AND
[1:30:39] HE SAID, "I'M NOT HE, BUT HE'S RIGHT
[1:30:41] HERE.
[1:30:44] YOU'RE NOT SHE, AND I'M NOT HE, BUT HE'S
[1:30:47] RIGHT HERE.
[1:30:49] [applause and cheering]
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAITH UNTO HER, I THAT SPEAK
[1:30:54] unto thee am he. BUT SAID, THE WOMAN
[1:30:58] ATTH, SHE RECOGNIZED HER DAY BY THE SIGN
[1:31:02] OF THE MESSIAH. WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED THE
[1:31:06] HOUR OF HER VISITATION, SHE BECAME A
[1:31:09] TROPHY.
[1:31:12] SHE BECOME AN EXPRESSION OF THE
[1:31:14] MESSIAH'S VISIT TO THE EARTH IN HER
[1:31:17] GENERATION. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:31:20] SHE BECOME THE DELIVERED. SHE BECOME THE
[1:31:22] FREED. SHE BECOME THE HEALED. SHE BECOME
[1:31:26] THE WORD.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO BEHAVE MYSELF. BUT HOW CAN
[1:31:35] I HOLD MY PEACE WHEN THE SAME MESSIAH
[1:31:39] HAS RETURNED TO MY AGE?
[1:31:43] AND I'VE GOT OVER 8,000 RECORDED
[1:31:46] INTERVIEWS WITH THE MESSIAH HIMSELF,
[1:31:49] VEILED IN THE FLESH OF THE SEVENTH
[1:31:51] ANGEL, REVEALING THE SECRETS OF THE
[1:31:53] HEART, DELIVERING THE NEEDS OF THE
[1:31:56] PEOPLE.
[1:31:57] When God re
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD MAKES A VISITATION, you'll
[1:32:04] either receive him
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; or reject him.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. He came to his own
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; and his own received him not.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; But
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; as many as received him,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME THE SONS
[1:32:30] OF GOD, even to them that believe on his
[1:32:34] name. BROTHER RAM SAID SO MANY OF THEM
[1:32:36] MISSED IT IN THAT DAY. DON'T YOU MISS IT
[1:32:38] IN YOUR DAY.
[1:32:41] NOW THIS IS A PROPHET. NOT ME. NOW
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; HIM.
[1:32:50] [applause and cheering]
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; ANY MAN THAT SAYS THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:32:54] worshiping William Brandham is a liar.
[1:32:58] [cheering]
[1:33:01] IT'S A LYING DEVIL FROM THE PITS OF
[1:33:03] HELL.
[1:33:05] WILLIAM BRANDHAM STOOD ON THE PLATFORM
[1:33:08] AND THOROUGHLY DECLARED, "IT'S NOT ME,
[1:33:11] IT'S HIM. IT'S THE DAY OF HIS
[1:33:15] VISITATION,
[1:33:16] NOT ME. I'M JUST A POOR SUBSTITUTE OF
[1:33:19] ANYTHING, BUT it's him MOVING AND IT'S
[1:33:22] HIM WORKING." LISTEN, HE JUST GAVE ME
[1:33:25] AWAY, A GIFT TO YIELD MYSELF TO HIM AND
[1:33:30] DO THESE THINGS FOR YOUR BENEFIT.
[1:33:36] WHAT DOES THE PROPHET SAY? THOSE WHO
[1:33:38] RECEIVE A PROPHET IN THE NAME OF THE
[1:33:40] PROPHET WILL RECEIVE A PROPHET'S REWARD.
[1:33:45] THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE AND THE PROPHET
[1:33:49] WILL ALL BE SAYING THE SAME THING. THEY
[1:33:52] WILL RECEIVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF A
[1:33:56] PROPHET'S MINISTRY.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; AS MANY AS recognized him.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, DO YOU ALL KNOW IT'S ONE
[1:34:10] THING TO recognize something,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; but it's another thing to entertain it?
[1:34:15] Oh Jesus.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; See, A LOT OF GUYS RECOGNIZE BROTHER
[1:34:23] BRANDHAM WAS A PROPHET.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'VE never entertained.
[1:34:28] [applause]
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE NEVER ENTERTAINED WHAT HE HAD TO
[1:34:35] SAY.
[1:34:36] [screaming]
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE I IT'S LIKE I INVITE ZACH OVER
[1:34:42] TO THE HOUSE, BROTHER ZACK. I INVITE HIM
[1:34:44] OVER AND I SAY, "BROTHER ZACK, COME
[1:34:46] OVER. I want your fellowship.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; You're the honored guest of the house."
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER ZACH COMES OVER
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE SITS down
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; and I say, "He's here."
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And then I go over there and get some I
[1:34:57] get on the phone and call somebody
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; and he's sitting over there and I'm over
[1:35:01] HERE ON THE PHONE TALKING to somebody.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE HE'S IN MY HOUSE. BUT IF I'M
[1:35:08] GOING TO ENTERTAIN HIM, I'VE GOT TO HAVE
[1:35:11] CONVERSATION WITH HIM.
[1:35:14] I'VE GOT TO FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST
[1:35:20] GOD SENT A PROPHET. THERE'S MORE THAN
[1:35:23] JUST A BELT BUCKLE. THERE'S MORE THAN
[1:35:25] JUST A HAT. THERE IS A MESSAGE. THERE IS
[1:35:28] A CONVERSATION THAT THEY HAD WITH THE
[1:35:32] BRIDEGROOM AND HIS BRIDE.
[1:35:35] [applause]
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. LISTEN. DO YOU KNOW
[1:35:39] ABRAHAM AND SARAH RECEIVED A VISITATION?
[1:35:42] AMEN.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It's in Is this okay?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; It's in Genesis 18.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And the Lord appeared.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK WHAT ABRAHAM DID. HE LIFTED UP
[1:35:57] HIS EYES.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; BROTHER KYLE, HE RECOGNIZED.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; HE LOOKED AND LO, THREE MEN STOOD BY
[1:36:07] HIM. AND WHEN HE SAW THEM,
[1:36:10] YES, SIR. [snorts]
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; HE WENT BACK TO ORAL ROBERTS AND BILLY
[1:36:14] Graham and
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; now I'm JUST GOING TO STOP HERE AND say
[1:36:19] it.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; WE GOT a message, folks.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And if WE BELIEVE IT, IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:36:26] WORTH STUDYING.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; It ought to be worth reading.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; It ought to be worth preaching.
[1:36:32] [cheering]
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm here. I might as well preach.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; WE ARE ENTERTAINING
[1:36:44] NOT THE IDEAS OF WILLIAM BRANDON.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT RECOGNIZING THE DOCTRINES OF
[1:36:49] WILLIAM BRANDON. THIS IS THE MIND OF
[1:36:52] GOD.
[1:36:55] THIS IS THE REVEALED WORD.
[1:36:58] THIS IS DOCTRINES THAT'S BEEN LAID IN
[1:37:00] THIS HOLY RIT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
[1:37:02] THAT HAVE BEEN SCRUPLED UP BY THE MINDS
[1:37:05] OF THEOLOGIANS BEING MADE PLAIN IN THE
[1:37:08] HOUR WE'RE LIVING IN.
[1:37:12] [cheering]
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:37:17] I [laughter]
[1:37:18] know I know uh brother STEVEN WOULD TELL
[1:37:21] ME I'm at home.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to PREACH LIKE I'M AT
[1:37:25] HOME.
[1:37:27] I THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STAND FOR
[1:37:29] WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TIME TO BECOME ASHAMED BECAUSE
[1:37:37] OF YOUTUBERS.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BECOME ASHAMED OF WHAT I
[1:37:47] BELIEVE BECAUSE OF SOME YOUTUBER.
[1:37:52] SOCIAL MEDIA WILL NOT INTIMIDATE ME TO A
[1:37:55] PLACE THAT I WILL NOT PREACH THE
[1:37:57] AUTHORITY OF THE OFFICE OF A PROPHET
[1:37:59] BECAUSE SOME MAN THINKS WE'RE SAYING TOO
[1:38:02] MUCH ABOUT BROTHER BRANDON.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; NOW, now y'all know where I'm at.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY THEY ATTACK YOUR PASTOR. THEY
[1:38:13] ATTACK ME. THEY ATTACK US ALL THE TIME
[1:38:15] BECAUSE WE REFUSE
[1:38:17] TO WATER THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO MAKE
[1:38:20] DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS comfortable
[1:38:24] [cheering]
[1:38:25] around THE RANKS OF THIS MESSAGE. THIS
[1:38:28] IS NOT A BAPTIST MESSAGE. THERE'S A
[1:38:31] THOUSAND BAPTIST CHURCHES. THIS IS NOT A
[1:38:33] CHARISMATIC MESSAGE. THERE'S A THOUSAND
[1:38:36] CHARISMATIC CHURCHES. THIS IS AN EVENING
[1:38:39] LIGHT
[1:38:40] VISITATION BY THE RESTORING POWER OF
[1:38:43] GOD.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TIME FOR IS
[1:38:49] THE MESSAGE.
[1:38:54] [cheering and applause]
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Now I'm here. I might as well say it.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL Y'ALL EVER Y'ALL EVER HEARD A word
[1:39:00] psychology?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Y'all ever heard a preacher just blast
[1:39:05] the spirit of psychology?
[1:39:07] You heard preacher do that.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Now, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, don't
[1:39:10] you?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Is people get all nervous?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; He shouldn't say that.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He shouldn't He He shouldn't preach
[1:39:18] against that.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I remember as a kid, I'm
[1:39:22] just going to slow down here for a
[1:39:23] second because I want to lay something
[1:39:24] in here.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I remember as a kid when you couldn't go
[1:39:27] to a meeting without hearing a preacher
[1:39:29] take a sword to psychology. Yeah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; And for the longest time I wondered why,
[1:39:34] you know,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; and and then and then one day I God
[1:39:37] called me in the ministry and I started
[1:39:39] studying Brother Bram's message and
[1:39:40] preaching it and I started hearing him
[1:39:42] say things like psychologyy's of the
[1:39:44] devil.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And then HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE
[1:39:49] THIS. HE WOULD SAY, "PSYCHOLOGY IS
[1:39:51] PERFECT GUESSWORK."
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So any MAN THAT LABELS THE MINISTRY OF
[1:39:56] BROTHER Brandham psychology is saying
[1:39:58] his ministry was perfect guesswork.
[1:40:04] AND THEN THEY'LL START SAYING THINGS
[1:40:06] LIKE, "WELL, WELL, NOT EVERYTHING'S a
[1:40:08] spirit." You know,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; we can approach things by psychology.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; We can fix things by psychology. We can
[1:40:16] we can we can remove the anointing and
[1:40:18] fix situations and and we can remove the
[1:40:20] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and we CAN
[1:40:22] OVER
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S PSYCHOLOGY, FOLKS. RIGHT.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; AND AND AND SO SO YOU ALL I REMEMBER IN
[1:40:29] World War I, I read a book of a soldier
[1:40:31] and he said these words. He said he said
[1:40:34] you know he said when I was on my front
[1:40:35] porch he said I was just sitting there
[1:40:37] as a young man as a kid and in his in
[1:40:40] his biography and he or autobiography
[1:40:42] however it is. And he says but I heard
[1:40:44] that our nation was being attacked and
[1:40:46] he said something pulled me into the
[1:40:48] battle. Uh-huh.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; He said something pulled me. AND HE
[1:40:52] SAID, "I WENT DOWN THERE AND I GOT A
[1:40:54] weapon
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; and I got a uniform." He said, "I didn't
[1:40:58] put myself in." He said, "The love of my
[1:41:00] country pulled me
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; into the battlefield."
[1:41:05] Come on.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN SOMETHING YOU REALLY LOVE IS
[1:41:08] ATTACKED,
[1:41:10] [cheering]
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; if it's really in your genes, IT WILL
[1:41:16] PULL YOU [screaming]
[1:41:18] INTO THE BATTLEFIELD. LISTEN, I'M NOT
[1:41:20] TRYING TO FIGHT. I'M TRYING TO PREACH
[1:41:22] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND MEN HAVE
[1:41:24] ATTACKED THIS MESSAGE. THEN I REFUSE TO
[1:41:27] SIT ON THE PORCH WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN
[1:41:30] MY HAND. I KNOW WHERE I AM TODAY BECAUSE
[1:41:33] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; The attack pulled me.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; somebody somebody says, "Well, then why
[1:41:45] is all that PREACHING AGAINST
[1:41:46] PSYCHOLOGY?" WELL, IT'S real simple.
[1:41:48] Okay, you ready?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; It's real simple.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And and and and don't don't
[1:41:52] misunderstand me,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; but just a few days ago or months ago,
[1:41:56] and God rest your soul, but uh Dr.
[1:41:58] Dobson passed away, James Dobson.
[1:42:01] WHICH WAS A SOURCE of where this
[1:42:04] psychology stuff come into the message
[1:42:05] from.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not being mean or nasty, but
[1:42:09] I'm saying God bless Dr. Dobson.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; He did what he felt God called him to
[1:42:13] do.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; But you [laughter]
[1:42:18] is this okay, brother?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; But you know what blows my mind
[1:42:22] is people will lay aside message books
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and they'll GO PICK UP DR. DOBSON'S
[1:42:29] books
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; and they'll BRING THEM IN MESSAGE
[1:42:32] CHURCHES
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; AND STAND BEHIND PULL PITS and read
[1:42:37] stuff from a man.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I WONDERED WHY COULD ONE LITTLE THING
[1:42:43] SUCH AS PSYCHOLOGY CAUSE MUCH SO MUCH
[1:42:45] CONFUSION. Brother Cle, I found out what
[1:42:47] it WAS WHEN HE PASSED AWAY. The article
[1:42:49] said this. It said he was a politically
[1:42:52] influenced and motivated religious
[1:42:55] teacher.
[1:42:56] I SAID, "OH, THERE'S THE SOURCE OF THAT
[1:42:58] SPIRIT."
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; POLITICS.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; WE JUST FOUND THE SOURCE OF IT. NOW,
[1:43:07] COME ON. I'M IN THE MESSAGE. AND YOU
[1:43:09] KNOW WHAT POLITICS DOES? IT BRINGS
[1:43:11] DIVISION. [cheering]
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID?
[1:43:14] HE SAID, "THERE I WAS IN THAT FOREIGN
[1:43:16] COUNTRY." HE SAID, "AND ALL THEM people
[1:43:18] were against each other." He said, "The
[1:43:20] day before they were shooting each
[1:43:22] other." HE SAID, "BUT ONE MIRACLE, ONE
[1:43:24] SUPERNATURAL MANIFESTATION OF THE ANGEL
[1:43:27] OF GOD," HE SAID, "AND THEY LAID THEIR
[1:43:29] SWORDS DOWN." THEY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND
[1:43:32] ONE ANOTHER AND THEY WERE SINGING, "OH,
[1:43:34] HOW I LOVE JESUS."
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WORSHIPING GOD. SEE, BECAUSE
[1:43:40] ANYTHING WITH THE POLITICAL influence
[1:43:42] brings division. [cheering]
[1:43:44] [applause]
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going somewhere. Stay
[1:43:49] with me. OKAY?
[1:43:51] THEY LAY ASIDE THE MESSAGE BOOKS
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; AND GET A PSYCHOLOGY BOOK.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; BUT [laughter] but
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; you know what blows my mind, brother
[1:44:00] Kyle, is them guys ain't getting future
[1:44:03] home.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; You're right.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Don't get quiet on me.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; THEM TV EVANGELIST WHEN THEY GOT A
[1:44:16] PROBLEM IN THEIR CHURCH, THEY AIN'T
[1:44:18] GOING AND GETTING THE seal book.
[1:44:20] ARE WE
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE LAYING OUR WEAPON DOWN AND
[1:44:25] BRINGING DULL THINGS IN THE PULL PIT?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; CAN I TELL YOU WHY? BECAUSE WE
[1:44:32] RECOGNIZED IT, BUT WE HAVE NOT
[1:44:33] ENTERTAINED IT.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; WE'VE RECOGNIZED IT'S A MESSAGE. WE'VE
[1:44:38] RECOGNIZED HE FULFILLS MALACHI 4. HE
[1:44:41] FULFILLS REVELATION 10. BUT WE HAVE NOT
[1:44:43] ENTERTAINED THE FACT THAT THIS MESSAGE
[1:44:46] IS THE WORD OF GOD AND IT WILL DEFEAT
[1:44:49] THE DEVIL ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANY PLACE,
[1:44:52] UNDER any conditions.
[1:44:56] [cheering]
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But you KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ABRAHAM
[1:44:59] RECOGNIZED THAT WAS ELOHIM? YOU KNOW
[1:45:01] WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE SAYS HE
[1:45:03] RAN. [laughter]
[1:45:05] He ran AND HE SAID, "I FOUND FAVOR IN
[1:45:07] THY SIGHT." HE SAID, "LET ME WASH YOUR
[1:45:09] FEET." HE SAID, "LET ME FETCH A MORSEL
[1:45:12] OF BREAD AND AND let me let me let me
[1:45:14] get here." HE SAID, "LET ME GO GET
[1:45:15] SARAH."
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "NOW MAKE READY QUICKLY THREE
[1:45:20] MEASURES OF FINE MEAL AND KNEAD IT AND
[1:45:23] MAKE cakes upon the earth. And he took
[1:45:25] BUTTER AND THE CALF WHICH HE HAD DRESSED
[1:45:27] AND SET IT BEFORE THEM. AND HE STOOD BY
[1:45:29] THEM UNDER THE TREE, AND THEY DID EAT."
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT WAS MORE THAN A RECOGNIZING.
[1:45:36] IT WAS AN ENTERTAINING.
[1:45:40] NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; He said right before the blessing come,
[1:45:45] he said Satan tried to block the
[1:45:47] blessing.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Now, now can I can I got a few more
[1:45:50] minutes?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "What is the blessing?" He
[1:45:54] says, "In the hour now, now I want y'all
[1:45:56] to catch this, okay? In the hour of
[1:45:58] Elohim's visitation,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Satan is trying to block the oncoming
[1:46:03] blessing."
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Now, look what he does. He says he was
[1:46:07] trying to tempt them to feel
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; that they had done wrong
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and was trying to block the oncoming
[1:46:17] visitation that God was going to give
[1:46:20] Abraham and Sarah. Church of the LIVING
[1:46:22] GOD. WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS HE
[1:46:25] KNEW THE BLESSING WAS THE BODY CHANGE
[1:46:28] that would bring forth THE PROMISED SON.
[1:46:30] SO RIGHT AT THE TIME OF VISITATION, HE
[1:46:33] TRIED TO PULL THEM OUT OF THEIR FAITH
[1:46:36] into their feelings and make them feel.
[1:46:42] [cheering]
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING RIGHT NOW MORE
[1:46:44] THAN ANYTHING? FEELINGS.
[1:46:47] I don't feel like I'm saved. I don't
[1:46:49] FEEL LIKE I'M AN OVERCOMER. I DON'T FEEL
[1:46:51] LIKE GOD'S BLESSING ME. I DON'T FEEL
[1:46:53] LIKE I'M RECEIVING ANYTHING. I DON'T
[1:46:56] FEEL ANY BETTER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING
[1:46:58] TO CHURCH. I DON'T FEEL LIKE RAISING MY
[1:47:00] HANDS. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WORSHIPING. I
[1:47:02] DON'T FEEL LIKE SINGING. I DON'T FEEL
[1:47:04] LIKE
[1:47:06] COME ON. PREACHERS ARE BATTLING. I DON'T
[1:47:08] FEEL LIKE PREACHING. WELL, LET ME TELL
[1:47:10] YOU SOMETHING. YOU ARE A ROYAL SEAT OF
[1:47:12] ALMIGHTY GOD. AND YOU ARE NOT CONTROLLED
[1:47:15] BY YOUR FEELINGS. YOU ARE CONTROLLED BY
[1:47:18] THE ENTERTAINING OF THE VISITATION
[1:47:22] OF ELOHIM. COME ON. YOU MAY NOT FEEL
[1:47:25] LIKE IT, BUT GET UP AND FETCH SOME
[1:47:27] BREAD. YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT, BUT GET
[1:47:30] UP AND GO GET SOME MEAL. YOU MAY NOT
[1:47:32] FEEL LIKE IT, BUT DRESS THE CALF. YOU
[1:47:35] MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT.
[1:47:38] IT'S NOT JUST A PREACHER. IT'S NOT JUST
[1:47:40] A CHURCH. ELOHIM.
[1:47:43] [cheering]
[1:47:44] ELOHIM.
[1:47:46] ELOHIM
[1:47:48] HAS RETURNED. HE'S AT YOUR TENT DOOR.
[1:47:53] [cheering]
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Make her feel
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; She's not worthy.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm preaching RIGHT NOW.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; MAKE HER FEEL SHE'S NOT worthy
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; of Elohim's visitation.
[1:48:25] How many services do we come to?
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And we sit there under a cloud of
[1:48:30] condemnation.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Under a cloud of guilt.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Under a cloud of oppression.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not good enough.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THIS IS A VISITATION. I KNOW NOW
[1:48:50] IS THE TIME OF MIRACLES. I KNOW NOW IS
[1:48:52] THE TIME PRODICALS are coming home. I
[1:48:54] KNOW NOW IS THE TIME THAT GRACE IS BEING
[1:48:56] dispersed to the seed of Abraham. I KNOW
[1:48:59] NOW IS THE TIME, BUT I'M SIMPLY NOT
[1:49:01] WORTHY OF THIS VISITATION. WELL, WHAT
[1:49:04] ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT WASHED JESUS' FEET?
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT WASHED JESUS'
[1:49:10] FEET? YOU THINK SHE FELT WORTHY? YOU
[1:49:14] THINK SHE DID THAT BECAUSE SHE FELT
[1:49:16] WORTHY TO DO IT? BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:49:18] ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU BEGIN TO
[1:49:20] ENTERTAIN ELOHIM? IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM
[1:49:23] YOU. DO YOU REALIZE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO
[1:49:26] ENTERTAIN ELOHIM, IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM
[1:49:29] THE WAY YOU FEEL. IT BEGINS TO TRANSFORM
[1:49:31] THE WAY YOU THINK.
[1:49:34] CAN I SHOW IT TO YOU? WHILE SHE WAS DOWN
[1:49:36] THERE WASHING HIS FEET, YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:49:38] THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID? HE SAID HER SIN
[1:49:41] WAS GOING ON HIM AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:49:44] WAS COMING ON HER. [cheering]
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:49:48] [screaming]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; OH BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, ELOHIM IS HERE
[1:49:52] THIS MORNING. IT'S MORE THAN A PREACHER.
[1:49:55] IT'S MORE THAN A PROPHET. IT'S MORE THAN
[1:49:57] A GROUP OF PEOPLE GATHERED IN A
[1:49:59] RELIGIOUS SETTING. ELOHIM IS
[1:50:02] MATERIALIZING. ELOHIM IS IN THIS
[1:50:05] BUILDING THIS MORNING AND HE'S LOOKING
[1:50:07] FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL RUN FAST AND
[1:50:09] THEY'LL FETCH A MORSEL OF BREAD. THEY'LL
[1:50:11] make a cake.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL ENTERTAIN HIM.
[1:50:22] ELOHIM. [cheering]
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Elohim, come down."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; To visit Abraham.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said it would return again.
[1:50:41] Elohim,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; not another person,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; the same person
[1:50:48] [cheering]
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; returning into the church and would do
[1:50:53] the same thing. THAT WOULD BE THE SIGN
[1:50:56] AND THE VOICE WOULD BE CALL THEM BACK TO
[1:50:58] THE WORD, RESTORE THE FAITH OF THE
[1:51:02] CHILDREN to the fathers. There is the
[1:51:04] sign and the voice. What is it? The same
[1:51:08] God who came down in human flesh and eat
[1:51:11] milk and drink and eat meat and drink
[1:51:12] milk and Abraham said rather he was
[1:51:14] Elohim God manifest in the flesh
[1:51:17] revealed the son of man. Listen just
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; before your bodies.
[1:51:28] [cheering]
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT TO YOU? IT'S TIME
[1:51:32] [screaming] TO GET OUT OF YOUR FEELINGS.
[1:51:36] IT'S NOT RAPTURING FEELINGS. IT'S
[1:51:39] RAPTURING FAITH. If you can believe THAT
[1:51:43] THIS THIRD PULL IS ELOHIM MATERIALIZING,
[1:51:47] THE REVELATION OF GOD RETURNING TO THE
[1:51:50] CHURCH, THE SON OF MAN. THERE HE WAS
[1:51:53] STANDING THERE IN FLESH AT THAT TIME
[1:51:55] LIKE A THEOPHONY. HE SAID, "WATCH." HE
[1:51:58] WAS STANDING THERE DISCERNING SARAH WHAT
[1:52:00] SHE WAS SAYING IN THE TENT BEHIND HIM.
[1:52:08] He promised.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Watch
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; the royal seed of Abraham
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; is promised to see
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; the same thing.
[1:52:25] The royal
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; royal
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; seed
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; royal seed
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; of Abraham
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; is promised
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; is promised
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; to see
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING LIKE IT
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING CLOSE TO IT
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING SIMILAR SOMETHING RESEMBLING
[1:52:45] IT THEY ARE TO SEE THE SAME THING COME
[1:52:51] ON CHURCH. WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN IT, THEN
[1:52:53] YOU KNOW THE NEXT THING IS THE CHANGING
[1:52:56] OF YOUR BODIES. HALLELUJAH. WELL, IF I
[1:53:00] WAS THE DEVIL, I'D TRY TO BE GETTING YOU
[1:53:02] IN YOUR FEELINGS, TOO. IF I WAS THE
[1:53:04] DEVIL, I WOULD TRY TO BE MAKING YOU FEEL
[1:53:07] LIKE YOU WAS UNWORTHY, TOO. BUT I AM THE
[1:53:10] ROYAL SEED OF ABRAHAM. I HAVE SEEN THE
[1:53:12] STAR. I HAVE SEEN THE RETURN OF THE
[1:53:15] ANGEL OF THE LORD. AND I'M GOING TO
[1:53:17] ENTERTAIN HIM. I'M GOING TO WASH HIS
[1:53:19] FEET. I'M GOING TO SERVE HIM A MEAL. I'M
[1:53:22] GOING TO BLESS HIS NAME. I'M GOING TO
[1:53:24] SAY WHAT HIS PROPHET SAID.
[1:53:27] [cheering and applause]
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S ELOHIM. HE'S HERE. HE'S VISITING
[1:53:34] YOU. [cheering]
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you talking
[1:53:41] about?"
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you?
[1:53:47] THE GENTILES message started
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; by a visitation.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; WELL, I GOT ON MY SHOUTING SHOES THIS
[1:54:01] MORNING. THE GENTILES MESSAGE. IT
[1:54:04] STARTED BY A VISITATION. THIS IS A
[1:54:07] DIRECT QUOTE OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:54:11] ARE you ready for it? And it ENDS THE
[1:54:14] SAME WAY.
[1:54:17] NO, Y'ALL DIDN'T HEAR ME. THE GENTILES
[1:54:20] MESSAGE, IT STARTED WITH A VISITATION OF
[1:54:24] THE PILLAR OF FIRE and it ends the same
[1:54:28] way.
[1:54:31] OH, BROTHER, I CAN HEAR BROTHER BRAM SAY
[1:54:33] IT THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS?
[1:54:35] HE SAYS, "THOSE who follow THE PILLAR OF
[1:54:38] FIRE WILL HAVE A HARD WAY TO GO." HE
[1:54:41] SAID, "BUT THEY WILL BE READY FOR THE
[1:54:43] TRANSLATION at that time."
[1:54:47] [applause]
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, CAN I JUST PREACH IT TO YOU?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; This visitation
[1:54:56] brought a restoration for a translation.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; WILL YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THOSE THREE
[1:55:03] WORDS? VISITATION, RESTORATION,
[1:55:06] TRANSLATION. THIS VISITATION OF THE
[1:55:09] PILLAR OF FIRE BROUGHT A RESTORATION OF
[1:55:12] THE WORD and the restoration of the word
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; is bringing A TRANSLATION TO YOUR BODY.
[1:55:23] [screaming]
[1:55:24] [cheering]
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE. THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:55:31] has come.
[1:55:34] Now,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; yes, Lord.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; I got to skip over something here,
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; but let me say this.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; The angelic visitation,
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I like to say this way,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; the Elohhemic,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; the Elohim,
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; the the the Elohim,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; THE MATERIALIZATION OF ELOHIM,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; THE ELOHIM VISITATION,
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; to Abraham AND SARAH'S TENT WAS TRUE.
[1:56:03] YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER,
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; how did you know
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; that Abraham and Sarah
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; had had a visitation
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; with Elohim?
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Sarah's body changed.
[1:56:31] BROTHER KYLE, HER BODY CHANGE
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; WAS AN EVIDENCE THAT ELOHIM
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; HAD BEEN TO THEIR TENT.
[1:56:43] OH, GLORY. YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAID?
[1:56:46] HE SAID, "IF A MESSAGE COMES AND IT'S
[1:56:48] THE SAME OLD THING," HE SAID, "IT DIDN'T
[1:56:50] COME FROM GOD." HE SAID, "BUT IF A
[1:56:52] MESSAGE COMES AND IT BRINGS A CHANGE IN
[1:56:55] THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO HEAR IT, IT IS AN
[1:56:57] EVIDENCE THAT MESSAGE HAS COME FROM
[1:56:59] GOD." AND OH GOD, AND SARAH'S BODY BEING
[1:57:04] CHANGED BECOME A VISIBLE EVIDENCE.
[1:57:06] ELOHIM HAD BEEN BY THEIR TENT.
[1:57:16] [applause]
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:24] NOW, NOW, NOW, can I say this to you?
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; The people who recognize
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; and receive their visitation.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this?
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; They're always criticized.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ALWAYS CRITICIZED.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PETER SAID. HE SAID, "HAVING
[1:57:43] YOUR CONVERSATION HONEST AMONG THE
[1:57:44] GENTILES, THAT WHEREAS THEY SPEAK
[1:57:46] AGAINST YOU AS EVILDOERS, THEY MAY BY
[1:57:48] YOUR GOOD WORKS WHICH THEY HAD SHALL
[1:57:50] behold
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; glorify God
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; in the day of visitation."
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; can I tell you what criticism means?
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; You know what criticism means?
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; It's the expression
[1:58:12] of disapproval
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; of someone
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; or something.
[1:58:18] Now you know where that criticism comes
[1:58:20] from.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Based on perceived
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; NOT BASED on facts,
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; NOT BASED ON ANYTHING OF TRUTH, JUST
[1:58:41] perceptions
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; perceived. NOW, YOU READY FOR THIS?
[1:58:48] CRITICISM COMES from perceived faults
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; or mistakes.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; See, they say, "How can you hold your
[1:59:06] head up so high?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU WORSHIP GOD LIKE YOU DO?
[1:59:15] HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU PREACH THAT
[1:59:17] MESSAGE? AND HOW CAN YOU GO IN ALL THOSE
[1:59:19] AREAS OF THAT REVELATION? LISTEN, YOU
[1:59:21] WILL NOT CRITICIZE ME OUT OF MY
[1:59:23] POSITION. [cheering]
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID?
[1:59:29] HE SAID, "CRITICISM ON THE ACCOUNT OF
[1:59:31] THE WORD IS THE GROWING PAINS OF THE
[1:59:34] GRACE OF GOD."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, now I just got to say it. Amen.
[1:59:38] Critics are going to criticize whether
[1:59:40] you do good or do bad. They're just
[1:59:41] going to criticize
[1:59:49] Come on, folks.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; They're critics.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; THE WHOLE BASIS OF THEIR CRITICISM IS
[2:00:00] SOMETHING THEY ARE PERCEIVING.
[2:00:04] [screaming]
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT PERCEIVING COMES FROM?
[2:00:06] IT COMES FROM IMAGINATION.
[2:00:09] SO THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING. AND AS
[2:00:18] THEY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING, THEY
[2:00:20] BEGIN TO PERCEIVE SOMETHING.
[2:00:26] [cheering]
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's kind of like YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL
[2:00:31] TALKING ABOUT somebody
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; cuz
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; cuz you don't KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[2:00:39] ABOUT. IT MIGHT already be under the
[2:00:41] blood.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And the blood removes your foundation
[2:00:49] for criticism.
[2:00:51] [applause]
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say this to you.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; They can criticize you,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; but they can't stop you.
[2:01:10] I'm not going to preach all day, but I
[2:01:11] want you to hear this.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; They can criticize you, [applause]
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; but criticism don't stop life.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; LIFE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN CRITICISM.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAID? HE SAID, "AND
[2:01:31] HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY OF the
[2:01:32] church, who is the beginning, the
[2:01:34] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[2:01:36] things he might have the preeminence."
[2:01:40] Now watch this. Life coming into the
[2:01:42] body is the vindication
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; that the rapture is at hand.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; There's no leaven among you that brings
[2:01:51] the entire fullness of the godhead
[2:01:52] bodily. Now listen, it couldn't do it in
[2:01:54] Luther's age.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; It couldn't do it in Wesley's age. It
[2:01:58] couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; But in the day
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; when the son of man will be manifested,
[2:02:04] revealed, brought back, the church
[2:02:06] together
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; with the entire deity of God amongst his
[2:02:09] people. We'll be showing the same
[2:02:11] visible signs, manifesting himself like
[2:02:14] he did at the beginning when he was
[2:02:15] manifest on earth in a form of a
[2:02:17] prophet. God, oh glory, promised by
[2:02:20] Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the
[2:02:23] scriptures where you worship at.
[2:02:30] the house of God.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Seated.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody say seated.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Seated.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Now, can I say this to you?
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; In present tense.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Criticism,
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; it's okay.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; It can't remove you from your seat.
[2:03:00] When you know who you are,
[2:03:04] [cheering]
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; when you know where you come from,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,
[2:03:12] [cheering]
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE ENTERTAINING,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; when you know what you're believing,
[2:03:18] WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING,
[2:03:21] WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE FOLLOWING,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:03:26] [applause]
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; You can stand in your position.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; A lot of people
[2:03:46] don't struggle with the message
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; because of the message.
[2:03:53] They struggle with it because of what
[2:03:54] men have done with it.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; They don't struggle with the message
[2:04:04] because of it.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; They struggle with it because what men
[2:04:08] has done
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; with it.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; But if you ever see this message is not
[2:04:15] a man [cheering]
[2:04:20] If you EVER SEE IT'S NOT BROTHER
[2:04:22] BRANDHAM SIR,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PREACHER.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; It's the word revealed.
[2:04:29] [cheering]
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Can Can I tell you and I'm going to
[2:04:33] CLOSE ON THIS, BUT I want you to catch
[2:04:35] something. If you can ever see this
[2:04:37] message is your way out.

[2:04:51] PROMISE OF TOMORROW. THIS MESSAGE GAVE
[2:04:54] YOU THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER DAY.
[2:04:56] [cheering] When you CAN SEE THAT THIS

[2:05:00] ELOHIM
[2:05:02] VISITING this generation and YOU BEGIN
[2:05:05] TO ENTERTAIN IT.

[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't mean to slow
[2:05:16] down on you,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; but but can I just share something with
[2:05:18] you and I'm sorry I'm I'm bringing
[2:05:20] something to you from home if that's
[2:05:22] okay. But but just the other day I was
[2:05:24] preaching at home along these lines on
[2:05:26] God making a visitation and I was
[2:05:28] sitting in my office studying some
[2:05:29] things and I was just going through some
[2:05:31] quotes and I was just I was going
[2:05:32] through some quotes and I was listening
[2:05:34] to a tape and I had my Bible over there
[2:05:36] and I was reading I was reading my Bible
[2:05:37] and I was tying them quotes and
[2:05:39] scriptures and all of a sudden just in
[2:05:40] my little office there I heard brother
[2:05:42] Brad on tape and it wasn't it wasn't
[2:05:44] directly connected but he says these
[2:05:46] words. He says in in this one paragraph
[2:05:49] he says Arkansas God's visiting you.
[2:05:54] And I said, "Wait a second.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE
[2:05:58] OF ARKANSAS."
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; I REWOUND IT AND I HEARD IT AGAIN.
[2:06:03] ARKANSAS, IT'S GOD VISITING YOU.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; AND I GOT TO THINKING, "OH YEAH, NOW NOW
[2:06:10] I KNOW PEOPLE." AMEN. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[2:06:13] THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING, "YOU'RE
[2:06:14] TAKING THAT TOO FAR." WELL, LET ME TELL
[2:06:16] Y'ALL SOMETHING. I CAN'T TAKE IT TOO
[2:06:18] FAR. [cheering]
[2:06:22] I can't TAKE IT TOO FAR BECAUSE THE
[2:06:25] TRUTH CAN NEVER EXPIRE.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT THERE IN MY OFFICE, YOU KNOW
[2:06:31] WHAT I DID? I PAUSED THAT TAPE AND I
[2:06:34] SAID, "COME HERE, DEVIL. COME HERE,
[2:06:36] DEVIL. COME HERE. I WANT YOU TO HEAR
[2:06:38] SOMETHING." AND I REWOUND IT.
[2:06:41] [clears throat] AND I SAID, "NOW, DEVIL,
[2:06:42] WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THAT?
[2:06:45] YOU CAN CRITICIZE ME ALL YOU WANT TO.
[2:06:48] YOU CAN CRITICIZE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST
[2:06:50] ALL YOU WANT TO, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO
[2:06:52] ABOUT JONESBORO, ARKANSAS?
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL DOWN
[2:06:59] THERE WHO HEARD over in Kennet, MISSOURI
[2:07:02] THAT THERE WAS A HEALER down there in
[2:07:04] Jonesboro?
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THAT DEVIL?
[2:07:10] YOU KNOW WHAT I BROTHER? I INVITED HIM
[2:07:12] IN THE OFFICE AND I said, "Sit down. I'm
[2:07:13] going to preach to you for a second.
[2:07:15] WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT? WHAT CAN YOU
[2:07:17] DO ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE GOT HER
[2:07:20] GRANDPA TO TAKE HER over to the meeting
[2:07:22] AND SHE WAS BLIND? COME ON. I DON'T HAVE
[2:07:25] TIME TO DIG ALL THE TYPES OUT OF IT. SHE
[2:07:27] WAS BLIND AND SHE WAS LOST. SHE WAS
[2:07:31] LOST. SHE WAS GOING IN CIRCLES. SHE
[2:07:34] DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. BUT ALL OF
[2:07:37] A SUDDEN, SHE BUMPED.
[2:07:40] [cheering]
[2:07:42] ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE BUMPED INTO
[2:07:44] SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET OF
[2:07:46] GOD SAID? HE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[2:07:48] FEELING RIGHT NOW?" HE SAID, "YOU'RE
[2:07:50] FEELING ANGELS bumping into you."
[2:07:52] [cheering]
[2:07:53] She She bumped into something. And when
[2:07:56] she bumped into it, she looked up and
[2:07:58] she COULDN'T SEE HIM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT
[2:08:00] HE SAID? HE SAID, "ARE YOU OKAY?" SHE
[2:08:02] SAID, "I'M BLIND." SHE SAID, "I'M BLIND.
[2:08:06] I CANNOT SEE,
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; BUT I HEARD HEARD.
[2:08:13] HE THAT HATH AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR WHAT
[2:08:16] THE SPIRIT HAS TO SAY UNTO THE CHURCHES.
[2:08:20] I'M BLIND. I CAN'T SEE. BUT I HEARD I
[2:08:24] HEARD THERE WAS A MAN OVER HERE
[2:08:26] [laughter] AND HE WAS PRAYING FOR PEOPLE
[2:08:28] AND THEY WERE GETTING HEALED.
[2:08:30] [cheering]
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY FOR THE TRIAL?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY FOR THE TRIAL? ARE YOU
[2:08:35] READY FOR THE TRIAL?
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; YOU don't believe THAT, DO YOU?
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; YES, I DO. I DO.
[2:08:42] YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL MY [screaming] HEART,
[2:08:51] [applause and cheering]
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL MY HEART, I BELIEVE IF YOU GET
[2:08:57] ME TO THAT HEALER, [screaming] I'LL FIND
[2:08:59] MY DADDY.
[2:09:02] Come on. I'M NOT A CRAZY MAN. SHE WAS A
[2:09:06] LITTLE WOMAN. SHE WAS A LITTLE BRIDE.
[2:09:08] SHE WAS AN IMMATURITY. BUT WHEN SHE MET
[2:09:11] THE SABBATH ANGEL, HE BROUGHT A HEALING
[2:09:14] TO HER EYES.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Come here, devil. Come here, devil. I'm
[2:09:20] not done. Come here, devil.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Come here. You You missed something.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; YOU MISSED SOMETHING.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; SHE SAID, "If you get ME TO THE PROPHET,
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; I'LL FIND MY DADDY.
[2:09:34] [cheering]
[2:09:39] IF YOU GET ME TO ELEAZAR,
[2:09:45] I'LL [screaming] FIND ISAAC.
[2:09:48] BUT SHE COULDN'T FIND HER DADDY UNLESS
[2:09:50] SHE MET THE PROPHET. REBECCA COULDN'T
[2:09:53] FIND ELLIE. COULDN'T FIND ISAAC UNLESS
[2:09:56] SHE FOUND ELEAZAR.
[2:09:58] AND WHEN SHE MET ELEAZAR, SHE SAID,
[2:10:01] "TAKE ME TO ISAAC.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:13] I'M LIKE THAT BLIND WOMAN. I'M LIKE THAT
[2:10:16] BLIND WOMAN. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
[2:10:18] BAPTIZE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE. I
[2:10:20] DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I COME FROM. BUT I
[2:10:22] SAID, "JUST GET ME TO THAT MESSAGE. JUST
[2:10:25] GIVE ME THAT PROPHET." [cheering]
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.
[2:10:34] GLORY TO GOD.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not a crazy man.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; I know he didn't physically take her by
[2:10:45] the hand and lead her to her father.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; I know what he said.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not out typing the types.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; I know what he said.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; But she would have never found her
[2:10:57] daddy.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; So, who made a visitation to Jonesboro?
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; or
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Elohim?

[2:11:27] this one?

[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all ever heard that, please?
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Little Rock, Arkansas.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; What about when a And I'm closing right
[2:11:41] here. I promise.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; What about when a prophet of God walked
[2:11:46] into a mute school?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Now, now, saints, this wasn't a mute
[2:11:54] hospital.
[2:11:56] It was a mute school.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; What do you go to school to do?
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Learn.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; He walks into a mute school
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; where there are 150 dumb and deaf
[2:12:14] children in the school
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; learning.
[2:12:22] I'm done preaching. I'm just having fun
[2:12:23] now.
[2:12:25] LEARNING
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; LEARNING HOW TO REMAIN IN THIS
[2:12:29] CONDITION.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; HOW TO PUT UP WITH THIS CONDITION, HOW
[2:12:35] TO LIVE DEAF, HOW TO LIVE AS A MUTE, HOW
[2:12:38] TO LIVE WITHOUT BEING THEY WERE NOT, IT
[2:12:42] WAS NOT A HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE
[2:12:44] ADMINISTERING MEDICINE TRYING TO MAKE
[2:12:45] them better. [clears throat]
[2:12:50] IT WAS A SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE TEACHING
[2:12:53] THEM HOW TO LIVE IN THAT CONDITION.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; But then Elohim
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; REVEALED IN THE FLESH OF THE SEVENTH
[2:13:02] ANGEL COMES WALKING IN A HOSPITAL. NO,
[2:13:05] IN A SCHOOL WHERE THEY'RE SITTING THERE
[2:13:08] TELLING THEM, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE
[2:13:09] THIS THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND AND
[2:13:11] YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HEAR AND YOU'RE
[2:13:13] NEVER GOING TO TALK." AND HE WALKED IN
[2:13:15] THERE AND ONE PRAYER, ONE PRAYER, AND
[2:13:20] 150 DUMB AND DEAF CHILDREN GOT UP OUT OF
[2:13:23] THE CHAIRS AND BEGIN TO TALK AND BEGIN
[2:13:26] TO SPEAK.

[2:14:19] SEPARATED. I CAN LIVE ABOVE REPROACH. I
[2:14:22] CAN LIVE ABOVE LEOTYA." OH, CHURCH OF
[2:14:25] THE LIVING GOD, IF THIS MESSAGE HAS
[2:14:27] CLAIMED YOU, YOU OUGHT TO STAND ON YOUR
[2:14:29] FEET AND RAISE YOUR HANDS AND SAY,
[2:14:32] "THANK GOD.
[2:14:34] [applause]
[2:14:34] THANK GOD. [screaming] I HAVE BEEN
[2:14:37] CLAIMED.
[2:14:42] The visitation
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; of Elohim,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Elohim's revelation.
[2:14:51] Yes, sir.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Elohim's re revelation
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; brought a restoration.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; And that revelation
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; has prepared you
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; for translation. Listen as our musicians
[2:15:04] come this morning.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Whatever condition you're in,
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Elohim's in the building.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody run quick and get some bread.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's Elohim.

[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; ELOHIM'S IN THE BUILDING.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Whole church of the living God.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; How can you sit there this morning
[2:15:48] entertaining those thoughts of
[2:15:49] condemnation
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; when Elohim's in the building? [music]
[2:15:55] I ask you this morning,
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; you know what a visitation is?
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; A visitation [music] is a divine
[2:16:06] encounter.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; It's a divine intervention.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but this morning
[2:16:13] I remember where I was. [music]
[2:16:17] How many can you say, "I remember where
[2:16:18] I was." I remember where I was.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't you allow the devil
[2:16:27] Don't you allow the devil to water this
[2:16:30] message down. [music]
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you don't want to entertain
[2:16:35] Elohim, that's fine.
[2:16:37] But as for me [music] and my house,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; we're going to entertain Elohim.
[2:16:44] [music]
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; We're going to entertain this message.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; We're not just going to recognize it.
[2:16:50] [music]
[2:16:51] We're going to entertain it.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; We're not just going to recognize
[2:16:57] [music] the angel of God was with the
[2:16:58] prophet.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; We're going to entertain that angel.
[2:17:02] [music]
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, you all make too
[2:17:05] much out of the message.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; I don't make any more out of it [music]
[2:17:09] than what God did."
[2:17:14] [music]
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; It's a visitation.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Now is the time.
[2:17:19] Now is the hour.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; What What are you What are What are you
[2:17:24] doing this morning with your visitation?
[2:17:25] [music]
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; I I I don't have time to preach it to
[2:17:28] you, but I'll just say it to you real
[2:17:30] quick.
[2:17:31] A visitation is a divine [music]
[2:17:33] opportunity.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; What What are you doing with your divine
[2:17:39] opportunity?
[2:17:40] [music]
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you entertaining it?
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Are you washing Elohim's [music] feet?
[2:17:47] Are you are you are you are you pouring
[2:17:51] all that you are out on this word?
[2:17:52] [music]
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Are you giving everything you got to it?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Are you allowing it to transform you?
[2:17:59] [music]
[2:18:01] Are you allowing it to bring the grace
[2:18:02] and power of translation upon your life?
[2:18:05] Listen, I think it's time we recognize
[2:18:09] I want y'all to catch something in that
[2:18:11] in that scripture in Luke 19.
[2:18:15] [music]
[2:18:16] Brother, brother Kelly, the Bible says
[2:18:18] that because thou did not recognize him
[2:18:21] [music] in the day of thy visitation,
[2:18:24] the Bible said that they would be laid
[2:18:26] in a trench. [music]
[2:18:28] You know what else it said? And thy
[2:18:30] children,
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; thy children [music] within thee.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Because mom and daddy didn't recognize
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Because mom and daddy didn't recognize
[2:18:49] that this is Messiah's visit.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Their children, their unborn children.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Their children laid in the trench with
[2:19:00] them.
[2:19:02] [music]
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Folks,
[2:19:04] when are we going to realize that this
[2:19:06] is more than just a Wednesday night and
[2:19:07] a Sunday [music] morning? Come on.
[2:19:10] [applause]
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; It's more than just getting together and
[2:19:13] saying amen.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; But it's a life outside the four walls
[2:19:17] of this building.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; It's a Nazerite vow of separation upon
[2:19:24] your heart. [music]
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; See, when you recognize it,
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; when you recognize what it is, [music]
[2:19:31] it'll cause you to give your life to it.
[2:19:34] Listen, I believe this morning I believe
[2:19:37] Elohim
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; has made a visitation
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; in this generation
[2:19:43] and I believe he's here this morning.
[2:19:45] [music]
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; And I want to entertain what he's had to
[2:19:48] say.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Criticize me all you want to,
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; but your criticism
[2:19:54] will not cause me to leave Jesus in the
[2:19:56] corner
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; with dirty feet.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; I'll entertain him. [music]
[2:20:01] I'll entertain him. Let's bow our hearts
[2:20:03] this morning.
[2:20:05] I'll entertain him.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning, would there be
[2:20:08] one could say, "Lord, I hear your word.
[2:20:12] [music] I feel your presence.
[2:20:16] I hear you speak into my heart this
[2:20:17] morning.
[2:20:21] I'm not here to be ugly. I'm not here to
[2:20:23] be mean. I'm not here to be
[2:20:26] rude.
[2:20:28] But I am passionate about what I believe
[2:20:30] in. [music]
[2:20:32] And I believe this message has brought a
[2:20:34] separation
[2:20:35] between denomination and the word. I
[2:20:38] believe this message has brought a clear
[2:20:41] a clearcut [music]
[2:20:42] decision to the church of the living
[2:20:44] God. I believe this message has restored
[2:20:48] [music] the truths of this holy Bible.
[2:20:51] And I believe if a prophet said it, we
[2:20:52] ought to have the courage to stand
[2:20:54] behind it.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Men can go on world tours. They can go
[2:20:59] around the country holding seminars and
[2:21:02] going across seas and putting [music]
[2:21:03] forth their efforts
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; to destroying the faith of God's
[2:21:06] children.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amazes me.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; But what about you here this morning?
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; What' you say? I'm tired of being on
[2:21:14] [music] the I'm tired of being on the
[2:21:16] passive side of this. I want to take the
[2:21:20] initiative side of what I believe in.
[2:21:21] [music]
[2:21:22] [singing]
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; I want to stand with conviction. Not
[2:21:25] arrogant, not mean, not hateful, not
[2:21:27] nasty, but truthful with conviction in
[2:21:31] my heart. I believe this message is the
[2:21:33] Elohim visitation.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; To this generation,
[2:21:38] a prophet has come. The word has been
[2:21:41] revealed. It's not about a man. It's not
[2:21:44] being in Brother [music] Bram's presence
[2:21:46] or any other preacher's presence. It's
[2:21:48] about being in the presence of the word.
[2:21:50] But oh, I say it very plainly this
[2:21:52] morning. Without Noah, you didn't get on
[2:21:54] the ark. Without Moses, you didn't leave
[2:21:57] Egypt. [music]
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; And without this seventh angel's
[2:22:00] message,
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; you will not see a rapture.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; It's [singing and music] rapturing
[2:22:05] faith.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith is not in the flesh of
[2:22:08] brother Brandham. It's in the [music]
[2:22:10] word that he revealed.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; And if you can sit down and turn on them
[2:22:14] tapes and open up your Bible and begin
[2:22:18] [music] to pray and open your heart
[2:22:19] before God, I challenge you. Spoken word
[2:22:22] tabernacle. I challenge you. [music] I
[2:22:25] challenge you to get serious before God.
[2:22:28] I challenge you to recognize the [music]
[2:22:30] seriousness of the visitation of God in
[2:22:32] the hour you're living in. I challenge
[2:22:35] you to open your Bibles. [music]
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; I challenge you to turn on a tape
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; and sit there with your heart open,
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; listen to that word,
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; and as that word begins to strike
[2:22:45] something in [music] your heart,
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; let that word claim you.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Let that word claim you. He's
[2:22:54] sitting there in your house and your
[2:22:55] kids are away from God and [music] you
[2:22:57] begin to hear a prophet talk about
[2:22:58] buying thy house and he takes it from
[2:23:00] the book of Acts. Let that word strike
[2:23:02] that seed in your soul and let it claim
[2:23:05] that wayward child.
[2:23:07] You're sick in your body. Turn that word
[2:23:09] on and begin to read Isaiah 53 and let
[2:23:12] the spirit of God strike that word in
[2:23:14] your soul and let [music] it claim
[2:23:16] healing in your life.
[2:23:18] Elohim's visitation. And almighty God,
[2:23:21] we bow our hearts in your presence this
[2:23:23] morning.
[2:23:25] Father, all across this building, Lord,
[2:23:26] as believers of like precious faith,
[2:23:29] [music]
[2:23:30] Lord, your sons and daughters are
[2:23:32] standing before you this morning, Lord,
[2:23:34] with open hearts, Father. Not looking to
[2:23:37] a man, not looking to a church,
[2:23:41] [music] Lord, but looking to the word,
[2:23:44] the word that can save our souls,
[2:23:47] [music] the word of life that can
[2:23:48] transform us. Now, Father, I believe as
[2:23:51] we speak your word this morning, I
[2:23:54] believe lives are being claimed right
[2:23:55] here. [music]
[2:23:56] Father, what's claiming the lives of
[2:23:58] these believers to believe this message,
[2:24:00] Lord, it's not the personality of a
[2:24:02] preacher. Lord, it's not the it's not
[2:24:05] the the [music] uniqueness of a church
[2:24:07] or or the beauty of a building, Lord,
[2:24:10] but Father, what's claimed these eagles,
[2:24:12] what's claimed these believers [music]
[2:24:14] is the revelation of your word. Father,
[2:24:17] I don't think I just have to preach it
[2:24:19] and leave it there in Arkansas. But
[2:24:21] [music] Lord, I think of how your
[2:24:22] prophet come right here in North
[2:24:23] Carolina, right over there in Spindel,
[2:24:26] North Carolina. And he begin to call out
[2:24:28] our brother [music] Mike orders. I
[2:24:30] believe it was his mother in that
[2:24:31] meeting, Lord, in that revelation.
[2:24:33] Claimed that family. And Lord, for many
[2:24:35] years they've served you. And brother
[2:24:37] Mike has gone on to his reward. But
[2:24:39] Lord, there's still generations from
[2:24:41] that visitation. Lord, Father, this
[2:24:44] message has visited generations. Lord, I
[2:24:47] think of how it's went to Africa. It's
[2:24:49] went to India. Lord, it's it's [music]
[2:24:51] went to Europe. It's went to New
[2:24:53] Zealand, Australia, Father. It's gone
[2:24:55] into the jungles of [music] Africa,
[2:24:57] Lord. It's gone into Alaska, Lord. It's
[2:24:59] gone into the uttermost parts of the
[2:25:01] world, Father. And Lord, everywhere
[2:25:03] there was a seed, everywhere this
[2:25:05] message has visited, Lord, it's claimed
[2:25:07] [music] them, Father. Lord, I think of
[2:25:09] in Russia, Lord, where where there was
[2:25:11] walls of of political divisions, but
[2:25:13] your word went right in there and it
[2:25:15] claimed believers there. Father, I
[2:25:17] believe right there in Japan and right
[2:25:19] there in Korea, Father, in China, Lord,
[2:25:22] I I think of our brother Murphy Wong
[2:25:24] there in CLOVERDALE BIBLE WAY. LORD, OUR
[2:25:26] BROTHER WAS there [music] in the in the
[2:25:28] church and and he was a part of that
[2:25:30] church. I thank the state church in
[2:25:31] China. And Lord, this message come by
[2:25:33] his way. This message made a visitation.
[2:25:36] And Lord, there was a seed in his soul.
[2:25:39] And Father, it claimed him, Lord.
[2:25:41] Father, from all over this world, Lord,
[2:25:44] now Father, men will set out today. And
[2:25:46] they'll make excursions into foreign
[2:25:48] lands. And they'll make trips around the
[2:25:50] world trying to disprove this. But Lord,
[2:25:52] they will never stop it. [music]
[2:25:55] It's already claimed flesh. Life is
[2:25:57] already moved into the body. The rapture
[2:26:00] is at hand [music] now. Lord, give us
[2:26:03] strength to work until that last seed
[2:26:04] comes in. Father give us courage to
[2:26:07] stand without ashamed this father
[2:26:09] [music]
[2:26:10] without confusion
[2:26:12] but stand with revelation
[2:26:15] and strength [music]
[2:26:17] in Jesus name we pray.
[2:26:20] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:26:23] Oh [music] want you raise your hands
[2:26:24] this morning.
[2:26:26] The angel of the Lord is in the building
[2:26:28] today. [music]
[2:26:30] The angel of God is right here in this
[2:26:32] building this morning.
[2:26:35] He's passing by your way. Say, "Lord,
[2:26:39] help me. [music]
[2:26:40] Help me." God bless you there. Hands up
[2:26:44] all over the building. Lord, help me.
[2:26:46] Help me to recognize
[2:26:48] the hour [music] of visitation.
[2:26:53] He is here.
[2:26:57] [music]
[2:26:58] Amen.
[2:27:01] [singing]
[2:27:03] He is [music]
[2:27:05] here.
[2:27:08] You
[2:27:09] can you can entertain him [music]
[2:27:13] and you [singing]
[2:27:14] will never
[2:27:17] be
[2:27:19] [music] the same.
[2:27:21] Before we sing that again, I want to say
[2:27:23] this to [music] you this morning and I
[2:27:25] want to say it very plainly and I want
[2:27:27] to say it very [music] very
[2:27:30] passionately.

[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; The time you spend entertaining what
[2:27:45] somebody's saying about this message
[2:27:46] [music] is time you could be spending
[2:27:48] growing deeper in the roots [singing]
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; of truth and grace.
[2:27:54] [music]
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; How many say, I'm going to leave here
[2:27:58] today with a renewed vision of
[2:27:59] entertainment.

[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; I'm done entertaining what they're
[2:28:04] saying.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on believing.

[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going [singing] to keep on
[2:28:08] worshiping.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on preaching.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on loving God, loving
[2:28:12] his people.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what's in my heart.
[2:28:16] [music]
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Because it's in my heart to do it.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; It's in my heart to serve [music] God.
[2:28:24] Amen. [singing]
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; If God puts something in your heart,
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; if God puts it [music] in your heart,
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; it don't matter how many people
[2:28:35] misunderstand you. [music]
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; If God put it in your heart,
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; follow God. [music]
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
