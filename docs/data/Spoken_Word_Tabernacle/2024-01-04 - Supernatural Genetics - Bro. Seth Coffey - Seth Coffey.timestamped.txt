[0:00] the wheat the wheat has to come Plumb
[0:01] back as it starts maturing from the
[0:03] grain where it rotted died and come
[0:05] forth and kept coming up from grass into
[0:07] something else you can't go back to
[0:08] Grass don't point back to Grass don't
[0:10] point back to this don't point back to
[0:11] the Sheep come on till you get to the
[0:13] wheat and the wheat has to be the same
[0:15] kind of wheat that went into the ground
[0:18] when it's matured Jesus is raised from
[0:20] the dead he's matured now and he's
[0:23] matured in his church through
[0:24] justification sanctification baptism of
[0:26] the Holy Ghost through these reformers
[0:27] in the early days now here he is on
[0:30] today and his people believing he's
[0:34] here just that you might see you might
[0:36] be
[0:39] strangers May the god of Heaven honor
[0:43] what I've said about you now I want you

[1:53] raised up his son Jesus Christ who made
[1:55] these promises identify with you that

[29:08] prayer request
[29:10] tonight so after the testimony and
[29:15] pray God bless you everyone all right um
[29:20] I want to give this testimony because I
[29:21] was struggling in my body on the last
[29:25] service yes and normally
[29:27] I don't get sick normally I'm the one
[29:29] that encourages
[29:31] everybody um the Lord taught us how to
[29:34] fight the devil you know he uh there's a
[29:37] time where brother brandom said when
[29:38] Satan talks to you he said use it you
[29:42] use what he says to you so normally if
[29:45] if my body gets attacked it only lasts
[29:47] maybe two or three days because I make
[29:49] sure I apply the word so what I normally
[29:52] do is if I cough I said thank you for my
[29:54] healing Lord every every time I'm
[29:56] serious every time
[29:58] every time something happens if he start
[29:59] coming to my mind I said yeah I'm yeah
[30:01] I'm sick but he said I'm Healed too so
[30:03] which one you want to use you know
[30:05] that's that that that's how I learned to
[30:07] fight the devil so it never last but it
[30:10] didn't happen like that this time so I
[30:12] said okay Lord something ain't right
[30:15] that I missed the Mark or something I
[30:17] didn't know what was going on because
[30:18] normally it's already gone so I said
[30:21] okay Lord I said I don't know what's
[30:23] going on but I'm I I'm believe I'm
[30:25] Healed and when I made it to
[30:28] service I couldn't I couldn't say Amen
[30:30] the way I wanted to I was I said M
[30:34] that's that's the best I can do but I
[30:36] wanted to show Satan whose side I was on
[30:38] if I can if I can go to work and get
[30:41] paid or do something of of pleasure that
[30:44] I want to do then I can come to church
[30:47] so what I did was I said okay I'm I'm
[30:50] I'mma go anyway and and I try to praise
[30:52] my way but the thing that was so
[30:56] profound to me
[30:57] is when this body of Believers saw that
[31:00] we weren't here sister Bridget de called
[31:04] and to uh encourage my wife gave us some
[31:08] remedies and she prayed and man that's
[31:11] just to pray that's sister prayed and
[31:14] you know we were all encouraged and
[31:16] after that when I was going through it
[31:17] brother khem had pulled me aside he said
[31:19] brother you know and I'm like man these
[31:21] some real Believers you know these
[31:23] people ain't playing Church These some
[31:24] real Believers you know so I was
[31:27] encouraged you know cuz I wasn't going
[31:29] through the fight alone so I said okay I
[31:34] I said
[31:36] okay I got to church I still couldn't
[31:38] move the way I wanted to move my
[31:40] precious brother here he saw me
[31:42] struggling and this is love he picked up
[31:45] all of the tissues he didn't not it
[31:47] wasn't no snot on him now but but he
[31:50] didn't know that right he didn't know
[31:52] that he picked him up from me and walked
[31:53] into the back you understand cuz I
[31:55] couldn't move man that's love I I
[31:57] appreciate that and I know the Lord saw
[31:59] that and I pray the Lord grant you a
[32:00] special blessing my brother cuz that was
[32:02] that was dear to me
[32:04] so I knew if I could take communion I
[32:08] knew I would be
[32:09] healed and when brother Stephen the Lord
[32:12] anointed him to say that I said okay my
[32:14] healing is coming so when I took the
[32:17] communion I couldn't even get the cup
[32:18] out this this house is where brother I
[32:21] couldn't even get the cup out it was
[32:22] stuck so I said okay this this is a real
[32:24] test for me right now so when I finally
[32:27] got the cup out and and uh took the uh
[32:29] communion you know I started feeling the
[32:32] effects on my body just shifting and by
[32:34] the time I got home everything just
[32:36] started working out for the better so I
[32:39] thank the Lord for all of my body
[32:42] Believers I thank the Lord for everyone
[32:44] encouraging us but most of all I thank
[32:46] Jesus Christ because if I couldn't
[32:48] recognize the word and all of these
[32:50] Believers and where would I see it at
[32:52] because that means it's still on the
[32:54] pages you see so and the last last thing
[32:57] I want to say is if you have a
[32:59] testimony my brothers and sisters please
[33:02] give it I want to say these last two
[33:05] things by God's grace when brother Zach
[33:09] and his precious wife gave that
[33:11] testimony my wife and my children when
[33:13] we go home from service we fellowship
[33:15] and say hey what did you get out of
[33:17] service you know how did you feel about
[33:18] it and so forth so as we were talking
[33:21] about it I said that that testimony just
[33:23] did something for me you know and I told
[33:26] her I said something else I said you
[33:28] know cuz I was praying or something and
[33:30] she said
[33:31] sweetheart she said the Lord told me to
[33:35] go pray because you were
[33:37] praying right and the testimony he gave
[33:40] was she didn't know he didn't know his
[33:42] wife was over there praying as
[33:44] well but that was a correction for her
[33:48] because ever since then she's been

[1:02:14] manner of love the father has bestowed
[1:02:17] upon us that we should be called the
[1:02:19] sons of God Amen therefore the world

[1:02:53] we shall see him as he is now you may be
[1:02:56] seated here I'm going to read in
[1:02:58] Ephesians here and it says Paul an
[1:03:00] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:03:03] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[1:03:05] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:03:08] Grace be to you and peace from our
[1:03:11] father H and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:03:16] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:03:19] with all spiritual blessings and
[1:03:21] Heavenly places in Christ according a
[1:03:24] has chosen Us in him yesterday no at the
[1:03:30] next
[1:03:31] Revival no but chosen Us in him before
[1:03:34] the foundation of the world that we
[1:03:37] should be now listen when the Bible says
[1:03:39] something's going to happen and it says
[1:03:41] you should be holy and Without Blame
[1:03:44] before him in love it's going to happen
[1:03:46] it's not a if it's not a maybe now
[1:03:48] listen here in job it said then the Lord
[1:03:50] answered job out of a whirlwind and said
[1:03:52] who is this that darken the councel by
[1:03:54] the words without knowledge G up thy
[1:03:57] loins like a man for I will demand of
[1:03:59] thee an answer of thou me where was thou
[1:04:02] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[1:04:05] declare if thou Hast understanding who
[1:04:08] hath laid the measures thereof if thou
[1:04:10] knowest or who hath searched the line
[1:04:12] stretched the line upon it whereupon are
[1:04:15] the foundations thereof fastened or who
[1:04:17] laid the Cornerstone thereof when the
[1:04:20] morning Stars sang together and all Al
[1:04:25] all the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:04:29] listen to what brother Brenham said he
[1:04:30] said notice he is in me and I in him
[1:04:32] notice in every Christian yes sir that's
[1:04:35] a real genuine Christian yes my brother
[1:04:38] was with him yes sir not at the last
[1:04:42] Revival not about not at your last
[1:04:44] failure not at your last mistake come on
[1:04:47] preacher my brother but the genuine
[1:04:50] Christian was with him when the morning
[1:04:52] Stars sang together together and the
[1:04:54] sons of God shouted for Joy yes sir
[1:04:57] before there was a foundation of the
[1:04:59] world we were identified yes sir in the
[1:05:03] immortal Realms with God 10 million
[1:05:06] years before the world was ever formed
[1:05:09] yes sir I was back there with him if
[1:05:12] I've got eternal life I was there with
[1:05:14] him remember Church eternal life is not
[1:05:17] something that starts on a certain day
[1:05:19] but Eternal is a
[1:05:21] circle if you ever was you always was
[1:05:25] amen right preach I was identified with
[1:05:28] him yes sir when the morning Stars sang
[1:05:32] together and the sons of God right
[1:05:35] shouted for Joy amen he says now if you
[1:05:37] ever be there you was with him then for
[1:05:39] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:05:42] and that's God and you had to be a part
[1:05:44] of God at the beginning so church you
[1:05:46] can see what I've tried to show you is
[1:05:49] where our genetics begin yes my brother
[1:05:52] where our genetics start our our
[1:05:54] genetics don't start on any day but it
[1:05:56] actually started before the day our
[1:05:58] genetics actually started all the way
[1:06:00] back before the foundation of the world
[1:06:03] now now I want to show you this in
[1:06:05] contrast if we look at it on this side
[1:06:08] let's look at the devil's genetics for a
[1:06:09] moment well that'd be all right now in
[1:06:11] John 8:44 I'm laying a background here
[1:06:13] we'll get going here in a minute take
[1:06:15] your time but in John 8:44 it feels hard
[1:06:18] trying to put a background when you have
[1:06:20] to when brother Steven can lay stuff out
[1:06:22] you're probably going to be going what
[1:06:23] is he talking about but you just pray
[1:06:25] for me but but but in John 8:44 Jesus
[1:06:28] would say ye are of your father the
[1:06:31] devil that's right and the lust of your
[1:06:34] father ye will do he was a murderer from
[1:06:37] the beginning yes sir what was it when
[1:06:40] they said of Cain he was of that Wicked
[1:06:43] one yes my brother God Almighty came to
[1:06:46] him lip to ear and he began to say if
[1:06:49] you do just do as your brother does and
[1:06:51] it'll be well with you but the genetic
[1:06:53] on the inside of him of that pride and
[1:06:56] and and and that lust and wanting to be
[1:06:59] the right one and the jealousy that rose
[1:07:01] up in him you see it wasn't the right
[1:07:03] genetic to begin with if I can say it
[1:07:05] this way it wasn't the right seed it was
[1:07:08] never the right seed in the beginning
[1:07:11] and it said you are of that that Wicked
[1:07:13] one from the beginning he was a murderer
[1:07:16] and when God came and spoke to him lip
[1:07:18] to ear there was something that rose up
[1:07:20] in him and he said I can't believe
[1:07:21] you're telling me how to live my life
[1:07:24] I can't believe you're telling me that I
[1:07:26] have to obey what you say I've made an
[1:07:29] offering I came to church I did what la
[1:07:31] la but he couldn't come under subjection
[1:07:35] to the word of God because his lineage
[1:07:37] never went back to the word of God yes
[1:07:40] my brother yes sir and abold not in the
[1:07:43] truth because there is no truth in him
[1:07:46] amen when he speaketh a lie he speaketh
[1:07:48] of his own for he is a liar and the
[1:07:51] father of it and because I tell you the
[1:07:53] truth truth uhhuh you believe me not now
[1:07:56] listen Church don't you ever get that in
[1:07:57] your head that the truth is going to be
[1:08:00] popular but the truth will still be the
[1:08:02] truth
[1:08:05] amen and because I tell you the truth ye
[1:08:08] believe me not which of you convince me
[1:08:10] of sin and if I say the truth why do you
[1:08:14] not believe me that's it he that is of
[1:08:17] god Heth God's words ye therefore hear
[1:08:20] them not because ye are not of God so
[1:08:24] Jesus is looking at the Pharisees and he
[1:08:26] said you don't know me because you're
[1:08:28] not a part of me yes my brother now yes
[1:08:31] sir listen Church take your time I am
[1:08:34] the expressed image of my father amen I

[1:10:21] Gene of my father

[1:11:24] representation of my father living on
[1:11:27] the inside of me yes my brother now
[1:11:30] brother brandom keep moving man I hope I
[1:11:32] get I hope I get somewhere tonight
[1:11:34] brother brandom speaks he uses a parable
[1:11:36] here he speaks of the woman at the well
[1:11:39] in the priest and he begins to draw on
[1:11:42] the Blackboard he said now this little
[1:11:43] part here that looks like Blackboard see
[1:11:46] that represents his Purity uhhuh he was
[1:11:49] a priest he was an honorable man that
[1:11:51] was you know somebody that had legalist
[1:11:53] down P he he had everything right but
[1:11:55] down in his heart there wasn't no love
[1:11:57] amen he was he was of that Wicked one
[1:12:00] that re that represented this he was
[1:12:03] also he had to be a good man or he
[1:12:05] couldn't be a priest but you see how he
[1:12:07] got it was
[1:12:08] intellectual can I say carnal learning
[1:12:11] never had a revelation uhhuh notice when
[1:12:15] Jesus came and manifested the word
[1:12:18] because the word is a discerner of the
[1:12:20] thoughts that was in the heart as
[1:12:22] Hebrews 4 says Hebrews 4:12 that he
[1:12:25] would the word was a
[1:12:27] discerner of the thoughts of the heart
[1:12:30] and he came as the son of man the
[1:12:33] prophet what happened the priest with
[1:12:35] only intellectual learning he said it's
[1:12:38] a devil and we've heard that a lot he
[1:12:40] had no representation so it blacked him
[1:12:43] out he didn't believe the word because
[1:12:46] the word was not in him yes my brother
[1:12:51] there was no representation in that
[1:12:53] priest
[1:12:54] even though he he might have had all the
[1:12:56] gifts you know I believe in the
[1:12:58] scripture there in in the Corinthians it
[1:13:00] talks about if I have all the gifts if I
[1:13:02] can
[1:13:03] prophesy if I know all the Mysteries but
[1:13:06] I don't have love and God is love and
[1:13:09] God is the word and the Word was made
[1:13:12] manifest and dwelt Among Us so he didn't
[1:13:14] have the word he didn't have love he
[1:13:16] didn't have representation my brother
[1:13:19] yes sir he didn't have
[1:13:21] Supernatural genetic
[1:13:24] yes my brother yes my brother he didn't
[1:13:26] believe the word because the word was
[1:13:28] not in him but this little woman at the
[1:13:30] well
[1:13:31] uhuh she didn't have no gifts to show no
[1:13:35] sir no sir she couldn't say I brought
[1:13:38] this many people to Christ no sir she
[1:13:40] couldn't say my attendance is perfect
[1:13:43] but she had one thing on the inside of
[1:13:45] her my brother she had
[1:13:47] representation she had Supernatural
[1:13:50] genetics on the inside of her Hallelujah
[1:13:53] you know I I just want to say this
[1:13:55] tonight I'm so glad that God used people
[1:13:58] in the Bible that didn't have it all
[1:14:01] together I'm so glad that God used
[1:14:04] people like Peter in the Bible that I
[1:14:06] can read his mistakes but I can also
[1:14:09] read where he went by a gate called
[1:14:12] beautiful and there was a lame man and
[1:14:14] there was a genetic on the inside of him
[1:14:16] yes my brother I said Silver and Gold
[1:14:18] Have I None but this Supernatural
[1:14:21] genetic that I have I to you freely rise
[1:14:25] and walk in the name of Jesus Christ yes
[1:14:27] my
[1:14:28] brother Hallelujah glory to God but this
[1:14:31] little woman at the well had nothing to
[1:14:35] present she was filthy and as dirty as
[1:14:38] could be but notice way down in her
[1:14:42] she's got
[1:14:44] representation
[1:14:46] aen
[1:14:48] glory glory to God what is that
[1:14:50] representation preach my brother a
[1:14:52] betrayal of of someone or something in
[1:14:54] particular a way of being a certain
[1:15:00] nature a certain nature yes my brother
[1:15:03] she said sir not you're be El I perceive
[1:15:07] that you are a prophet yes my brother
[1:15:10] now we know that the Messiah which is
[1:15:12] called Christ will come and when he does
[1:15:14] he'll do this he said I am he yes my
[1:15:20] brother no more doubt no sir you didn't
[1:15:22] have to explain it we got too many
[1:15:26] people W everything explained to
[1:15:30] them this is by faith amen amen but let
[1:15:35] me tell you something when you got faith
[1:15:38] yes sir on the inside of you yes sir the
[1:15:42] substance you don't have to have
[1:15:43] everybody explaining something to you no
[1:15:48] sir no more doubt you didn't have to
[1:15:51] explain it she saw it believed it away
[1:15:55] she went why what did it do to her it
[1:15:58] redeemed her amen the word in her
[1:16:02] identified I put I wrote that down
[1:16:04] that's mine just so you don't get it
[1:16:05] confused the word inside of her that's
[1:16:08] it identified with the word in front of
[1:16:11] her can I say it this way it was a deep
[1:16:15] call to the deep and there was a deep to
[1:16:20] respond why because she listen her her
[1:16:24] her identity wasn't formed on that day
[1:16:27] at the well but her identity was before
[1:16:31] the foundation of the world when Jesus
[1:16:34] knew her just like that little woman
[1:16:36] that was caught in a very Act of
[1:16:38] adultery that's exactly right preach my
[1:16:41] and every holy person socalled dragged
[1:16:44] that little girl up to Jesus and said
[1:16:47] the the law say she ought to be stoned
[1:16:49] but what do you say what do you say
[1:16:52] about this woman do you know this woman
[1:16:54] you can call me crazy but I believe he
[1:16:57] dug down in the sand and went through
[1:16:59] the Lamb's Book of Life till he found
[1:17:01] some representation for that girl right
[1:17:04] there and he said I'll tell you what
[1:17:06] whichever one of you without sin cast
[1:17:09] the first
[1:17:12] stone preach my brother it didn't matter
[1:17:16] that's it it didn't matter at if the
[1:17:18] priest represented her no it didn't
[1:17:21] matter if her natural father represented
[1:17:24] her but you know what mattered that the
[1:17:26] one without sin was her
[1:17:30] representation ammen the one without sin
[1:17:34] he said neither do I condemn you yes my
[1:17:38] brother glor she could be
[1:17:42] redeemed because she was his in the
[1:17:46] first place she see that that those
[1:17:48] scribes and Pharisees had no say over
[1:17:51] her because that was not their property
[1:17:54] that's exactly but that was God's
[1:17:56] almighty's
[1:17:59] Property glory to God it redeemed her
[1:18:03] now watch he came to be a redeemer is
[1:18:05] that right congregation says yes my
[1:18:08] brother what does redeem mean bring back
[1:18:11] why didn't he get that priest he never
[1:18:13] was up there see he had no
[1:18:16] representation am he came to redeem that
[1:18:19] which had fallen in the fall yes sir
[1:18:21] this got messed up with that girl but
[1:18:23] God had her in his thinking before the
[1:18:26] foundation of the world and he come to
[1:18:29] cleanse her see then he said she had
[1:18:32] eternal life amen church I think this
[1:18:36] perfectly describes it okay I identify
[1:18:39] with my father because I'm a part of my
[1:18:41] father and brother brandham uses this
[1:18:43] illustration in in in spiritual
[1:18:46] Amnesia and and he says he says to be an
[1:18:49] American I landed on Plymouth Rock with
[1:18:52] her
[1:18:53] with the forefathers I had to I'm a part
[1:18:55] of her I wrote with Paul rever a Warner
[1:18:58] of her dangers if I'm a real American
[1:19:01] citizen I landed on Plymouth Rock you
[1:19:03] see what he's saying everything that
[1:19:05] America is an American represents that's
[1:19:08] exactly it's already put on You by
[1:19:11] identification brother it's your
[1:19:13] identification my brother preach my
[1:19:16] brother I wrot with Paul rever a Wonder
[1:19:17] of her danger I cross the I see Delaware
[1:19:19] where George Washington with his
[1:19:21] barefooted soldiers I was there for I'm
[1:19:24] identified with this nation yes sir what
[1:19:26] he did there was a part of me what I do
[1:19:29] now is a part of him I was identified
[1:19:32] with Washington at the Delaware I stood
