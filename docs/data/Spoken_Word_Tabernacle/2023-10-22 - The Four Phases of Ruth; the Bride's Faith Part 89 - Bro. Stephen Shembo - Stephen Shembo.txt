a praise report brother let's go ahead and we'll um y'all going be seated a moment brother DM has a um testimony this morning amen right I'll keep it short I want to thank God because if y'all know there was a pastor lost her daughter a few I guess weeks ago my dad went over there to um you know for the for the burial whatever and a lot of people went and I prayed for them and when my dad went directly after he left I felt stressed out on Friday I felt um stressed out but on Saturday I felt the most stressful because my dad wasn't there and everything and I had to look after my siblings I guess so throughout the whole entire day I was stressed out until the evening when I had to go pick him up and my mom was like why don't you call Uber to come pick him up I remember I called Uber yesterday to pick up my um brother but the dude ended up canceling because he couldn't find it so I decided to go and my dad was taking his I mean he wasn't taking his time but it was taking a while for him to come out and I was like I wish I was there so I can guide him to come out faster so he can go so since I wasn't there I started praying in my heart I was like God since you're there with him guide him so he can come we can go because they didn't want me to stay at the um arrival part too long so when he came I didn't see him he said that he was like in the first pole I was all the way in the fourth then as he kept walking I was waiting I was still looking back then when I saw him I felt kind of like Rel and I wasn't stressed anymore so I want to thank God for give him um safe traveling because there was also a girl who tried to delay his fight but thanks to God he made it one more time and is here today so I want to thank God for that amen I have a card here from the um kodo Family on the front it says thank you and on the inside it says more than I can say the kodo family would like to thank the church for your prayers and phone calls during this time of bereavement may the Lord continue to bless you all amen we're sharing that with you brother as well I do not have any other praise reports um I do have a couple of prayer requests um and then we have three

singing that was wonderful amen amen sister Lisa will fall right in line and hopefully I will get where I'm supposed to be going amen it's wonderful to hear sister gift as well brother Angelo I was singing that song throughout the week and I was wondering I say how is he going to sing that song himself when the other brother is not there and here this morning he's singing the song where is he at brother I was trying to see if can you try to combine it with sister yoked and let's see what's going to come out amen your pastor knows a little bit about the music so try together it with sister

both V visible and invisible audience any family member here God richly bless you I see a lot of folks a lot of friends here God bless you I can't call everybody Brother Sam is here Sister Sarah is here if I'm missing somebody somewhere God bless you you welcome to spoken word Tabernacle I believe everybody is reading their Bible twice a day two chapters a day amen I believe some are reading the C book some are reading their Church ages some are in the seals some are in the 70 weeks of Daniel others are in adoption and somebody is listening to the message of the hour somehow amen Lord's willing our next question and answer will be on November the 18th yesterday we had a wonderful question and answer it was one question and he generated question and question and question and question question and we had to just catch up on the second one and I I I really uh preferred if the whole church was there because we deal with marriages between tribes and between nations and between different countries and things like that and we had to review the mixed marriage and the hybrid because there is a an intellectual teaching that is trying to contradict brother Bram and it has been introduced in the message and some of them are coming from even ministers in the message trying to contradict brother brandham when he's explaining hybridation of human beings brother Bram is correct amen I took the scripture I took the message of the hour and I Pro it so I trust that those that were there can explain to the parent We Are One family we come from Heaven if you were here last Sunday we showed you that we are not American we are not African we are not Belgium we are not Switz I mean SS or whoever we are just the Bride of Jesus Christ so when we coming to marriages you need to know how to refer somebody where you need to stop we went through all of that amen so talk to somebody who was there they can tell you exactly the quote and the scripture and you can go with it Lord's willing again November 18 the Lord's willing it's going to be our next question and answer brother abble I don't see him here but the date he gave me was October the 28th which is this coming Saturday for the young men meeting so we're going to follow up on their questions amen and the young sisters I'm a little bit behind God uh help me and forgive me I will catch up with sister Divine and then we can coordinate everything together amen and I wanted to announce there was a lot of M that went on brother khma is here this morning the bury his brother yesterday he lost his brother and you continue to pray for the family I saw the picture he sent send me the picture these are very very difficult time we have uh brother barudi I believe several of you here knows brother Bari and uh his daughter was married to a pastor in Texas her name is Sister Lydia she used to pray with us in uh in the old church and uh she passed away they bury her also yesterday the best that I could do I sleep in on Friday and I went for hours asleeping in Texas and I was there for the viewing I just spent hours and then I had to fly back to the airport to come back again for question and answers so you continue to pray for the family they really really need a touch from the Lord amen so also brother Dan rean lost his daughter so I communicated with him and expressed the condolences from the church and from the family so continue to pray for him as well we have sister carolene Proctor I communicated with sister David this morning that passed also away the last testimony that I remember when they send uh a message to my wife that you need to see her before she departed when I was there she was like I don't know if a week or something she two weeks she was not talking or anything so as soon as I got there when she saw me she brighten up and she start talking and even asking for the sermon amen amen amen and I pull and and uh and and we pull was a drink or something and they gave it to her and she wanted me to feed her you don't play with the seed of God you don't touch the seed of God if it's burying that seed is still hungering for the CH so remember the family in prayer and all will go way by God's will go well by God's grace amen one more is brother Billy Paul passed away I sent you the quote in the group chat you saw that Sharon was waiting for her right there I don't like speculation in the message when people come and talk this and talk this and you bring confusion while the things were laying right there that Billy Paul will passed away I gave you two quot where he was clearly showing that Billy Paul have to join Sharon on the other side and he died at 88 that's if you born in this message you grew up in this message you know what number eight means so the man just came from eternity and he's going back to Eternity again and he died at 3 3 3 three look at those numbering over there so if if nothing can wake you up please wake up if nothing can wake you up look at what was going what is going on in Israel Brother Sam sent me something this morning about the pope now speaking and yesterday we talked about Israel so if there is anything you can do at this time please stop playing church amen amen you don't want to stay here you will come one of this morning you won't see me here you will look for another Pastor because I'm not going to stay here I'm going so wake up remove all the foolishness away and get into the word of God Amen because it seems like it's nothing is Awakening people in the message they see Israel going through what they going they still posting foolishness they see Billy Paul dying we still posting foolishness and sometime I'm sitting and say I mean despite everything that is going on we're still joking God is coming Jesus is coming wake up make sure your life is aligned with the word of God and you have the Holy Spirit I'm pleading as a Shepherd wake up whatever you trying to accomplish here is going to be burned by the fire whatever I'm trying to accompl even this church everything will be burned amen you don't want me to walk on your ashes because it's going to happen not for somebody here according to the promise we will walk upon the ashes of the people as we entering the Millennium I don't want to walk on your ashes I want you to walk with me following the Lord Jesus Christ as we entering the Millennium so please lay aside everything wake up time is very bad Israel is our time clock you see what's going on over there amen let's go to our scripture this morning Genesis chapter 22 glory to God can you hear me well can you hear me well in the back few people glory to God amen amen remove all the petty stuff away you're going to stay with your petty staff here let's go to heaven Genesis 22 if you dare you can say amen amen amen we going back again to the same scripture amen the Bible says and it came to pass after these things you know these things we went through that God told uh uh Abraham to remove Ishmael you remember that right he say after these things that God did tempt Abraham you understand this temptation now I don't know he's still coming like a NRA David said he did tempt Abraham and say to him Abraham and he said behold here I am you might be seated we know clearly here that the one who start this problem is God it was not Abraham Abraham was living peacefully God start or initiated the scene right here verse two and the Bible says and he says take now your son your only son Isaac whom you love so what God is asking here is not something that Abraham discussed it is not something that Abraham doesn't like amen God went to something that really have a penion has a liking between Abraham and whatever he was everybody okay so God asked Abraham something that he Lov amen something that he loves you need to understand these things deeply I already turned the corner because whatever you love is important amen they told Brother Bram when he went up there they told him whatever you love it's important to understand what you like amen he say whom you love and get you into the land of I send you the scripture this is where the temple supposed to be yes sir and offer him the first human sacrifice there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell you of so what is the offering right here who is the offering Isaac so the offering is clearly chosen identified by God to be his offering so the offering or the sacrifice is clear according to to this worship right here the sacrifice is a human being and that human being is Isaac who determine it God who chose it God who says to kill Isaac God so a death sentence is pronounced upon Isaac I know how I'm traveling amen Isaac has a deaf Pro I mean a deaf sentence a death verdict has has been put on Isaac the problem is had to get Isaac out of it we clear amen amen and Abraham rose up early in the morning and sat on his ass and took two of his young men with him and ASAC his son and split the wood for the burnt offering which is Isaac and Rose up and went to the place of which God has told him so he took the wood he took the fire he took the knife and he he also took his sacrifice it looked like he's going with his son but he's not going with his son the son now is called the sacrifice then on the third day Abraham lift up his eyes you know this already and saw the place of far off and Abraham say to his young men so he was already in the spirit of worship to his young man A B you here with the ass and I and L will go Yonder and worship and come again to you we spoke about this clearly that Abraham was talking about the resurrection because God told him that in Isaac Isaac will have S in other word Isaac will have children so based off that Abraham cling on to it he say okay if Isaac is going to have children so no matter what's going to happen to USAC God have to raise him back up and matter of fact the way I receive Isaac I receive a resurrection we went through that so the first faith of Abraham was that was based on the resurrection we went through this the resurrection everybody okay always is connected with death you cannot have a resurrection without a death amen are we together did you sleep well today you cannot have a resurrection without a death everybody okay so this faith is good but he will not spare Isaac amen amen are we together it's a good faith but death will still affect Isaac everybody okay even though it's a good faith we will recuperate Isaac but we will go through the pain of death first then ISAC will come back up is there a possibility to avoid death everybody okay everybody okay this faith is good if you kill Isaac he rise back up do we want to see ASAC dead Lord help me verse uh six now that was verse five verse 6 Abraham and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac you know what it means his son the cross is is going there and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together Isaac is not going going with his son he's going with a sacrifice verse seven and Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and say my father we went through this you know what it means because the the child understood the order of worship he says my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the for a what burnt offering according to the story what is the sacrifice is as worry about it no so he have a right to ask for a lamb because he's not in whatever going on between him and between Abraham and God he also has his own personal relationship yes sir everybody good so Isaac is asking for a lamb amen amen amen where is the Lamb glory to God Amen verse 8 and Abraham say my son God will provide what himself a lamb stop why should God provide the lamb when God already have a sacrifice why he didn't turn around and say Hey you the sacrifice amen why does God need to provide and another sacrifice God already said the sacrifice is Isaac I just show it to you it's coming from the scripture amen amen but Abraham is saying God will provide himself a sacrifice so that switch Faith from the first level into a different level on the first level we got the sacrifice but the sacrifice must die now another Faith open up and that faith is to look for a sacrifice that is not there amen they are looking for a lamb but the lamb is not there now Abraham say you know what God will produce the lamb because we are already past the threshold we can't go back home and go pick up a lamb and come back up here because it's going to take three days again going back and three days coming back it's going to be six days somehow in this corner God must do something amen amen amen everybody good amen this provision of a lamb is also a protection to Isaac everybody okay if a lamb is there why do we have to kill the boy that's it everybody okay everybody good so this caliber of Faith everybody okay it's a faith that can rescue a loved one come on when even God has condemned a [Applause] person if I lost you you tell me to repeat it again J you have to start swallowing Adult food if I lost you you tell me God determine a death sentence he was that save the Lord who can change that save the Lord I'm asking you a question is is my Bible different than your Bible who can stop what God has already spoken everybody okay according to that say the Lord you need to go with the faith of Resurrection the faith of Resurrection allow that sa the Lord to be accomplished then you can rescue back but this faith can override that amen thank you Jesus because the first Faith was based on the promise because the promise is in Isaac there will be a seed but the second faith can override the [Music] promise is he too strong I can't give you skim milk I told you we turn the corner it is a faith that can save a loved one to the utmost in other words this faith will do things that is beyond your brain Jesus amen am let me put it this way this faith will do things that is beyond your religious brain hallu thank youus in other word you can have that s the Lord but this faith can go above [Applause] that I let it soak as you swallow him praise God let's go to verse eight and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a what a lamb a lamb for a what burnt offering Isaac asked for a lamb Abraham spoke a b let's see what is going to be produced it's a faith of Abraham he's the one who spoke everybody okay we clear verse n and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac so if you can B Isaac why didn't you tell him ahead of time so he can get prepared if he have to call somebody and confess quickly and say you know yesterday I was mad at you me and you were not talking for two month so I just want to prepare my life forgive me so I can die everybody okay amen and Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bned his son Isaac and laid him on the altar upon the wood so Isaac didn't have a problem to be laid on the wood that's right so why didn't you tell him that you the sacrifice amen am and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to do what slay his son so Abraham was not playing games we clear amen we clear if you notice when Abraham spoke amen God did not move everybody okay amen God let the let Abraham to be stretch again that's right are you following me are you following me when he come to the very last minute Hallelujah yes L I hope you catching me sir when Abraham is just about to kill that's when the faith kick in yes sir amen amen amen father help me amen hallelujah and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord call to him out of heaven and say what Abraham Abraham and he said what here and he said do what lay night thine hand upon the L it's the faith that will intercept at the very last moment amen you will see where I'm going this faith will intercept or will intervene amen at the very last moment when all hope is gone you will see that Faith stepping in everybody okay before the knife touches Isaac that's when the faith sweep you will see where I'm going remember the feet fed the cross that's right do you know when they pick him up do you know when they pick him up not when he was in prison they already put him on the cross they already crucify him he's already bleeding at the very last moment somebody spoke and say today you and me that's a rescue at the very last moment why didn't you rescue him all the stand let's continue verse 12 and he said lay not your hand upon the L neither do anything to him for I know that you fear God respect amen seeing you have not withheld your son your only son from him and Abraham lift up his eyes and look and behold behind him a a lamb a ram a what a ram there is a difference between a lamb and a r are we reading different Bible a ram and the lamb are the same species correct yes sir but a lamb is a little one yes sir and the r is an adult one the faith was not the faith of Isaac no sir it was the faith of Abraham that's right everybody okay he have to produce a ram the healing is not the healing of NE man it's not the faith of NE man that he neon it is the faith of the little girl so the skin of Neon must be like a little [Applause] child have I lost you are you up to date with sermon we are together so this faith will produce thing according to the one who spoke it no problem a ram was caught in a Thicket by its horn and every Abraham went and did what took the RAM and did what offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of what his son this Faith switched the trouble in other way this Faith came and took Isaac from that sa the lordus Jesus let's go this way this is that sa the lord inside that sa the Lord Isaac is there this Faith went and opened that sa the Lord and pull Isaac out hallu and took a ram and put it in that sa the Lord and said you can fulfill the word but not with [Applause] Isaac let's go to number chapter 12 when you come to church pray stay under the anointing when you are home stay under the anointing when the pastor say listen to the tape it keeps you under a spiritual atmosphere and then you begin to catch the Unseen word quickly you don't go fulltime in the worldly thing then on Sunday you begin to reboot yourself you're going to have a hard time claming but if throughout the week you working you listening you working you reading your Bible you cooking you listening you keep yourself under the atmosphere it's very easy to S to take off quickly we don't have to do the check engine the light all this kind of stuff let's go to uh Numbers Chapter 12 amen father be with us verse one if you there you can say amen and Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses when they were talking against the servant of God he was not there that's right and they spoke about Moses because of the ethopian woman those that were in question and answer yesterday I describ this thing these people were not speaking foolishly sir sir they were speaking with the scripture that's amen amen that's because Moses told them do not marry strength women if you were there in question and answer you know what I'm talking about they told them do not marry strange women and the same Moses goes and marry a strange woman you need to be very careful very careful especially when you're dealing with a Vindicated Prophet if you don't understand what the prophet is doing it's better to shut your mouth shut your mouth don't come and begin to challenge brother Bram because you don't know what brother Bram was doing the same Moses that says this the same Moses look like he's acting against the word of God and I Pro to you yesterday that Moses was a type of Christ and who was showing that Christ will be married to a strange woman he will be married to a gentile woman because the Old Testament Prophet were doing things according to the spirit of God who are you to to to argue to question a Vindicated Prophet who are you verse 12 vers uh chapter 12 verse 2 and they said has the Lord indeed spoken what only by Moses do you know what it means in other word Moses he's not the only one that can feel the anointing we also feel the anointing the spirit of God also work with us what does he think because he's the pastor God also speak to me God speak to you God put the order God said this is a prophet you are not a prophet even if God speaking to you you need to respect the order of [Applause] God he says in other word is God only speaking to Moses Miriam I'm a prophetess the anointing also hit me Aron I'm also a priest the anointing also hit me so what is Moses thinking he is with your anointing has he not spoken also by who us so God spoke through Miriam God spoke through Aaron they thought because God used them they can challenge the Vindicated Prophet listen to me carefully even if you a preacher no matter how much anointing you will have on you never touch brother Bram never touch the prophet of this hour never have the audacity to even try to change what brother Bram say stay in your position Ephesian 4 doesn't make you the pastor of the age the pastor of the age is William Marion pram [Music] Hallelujah speak hallelujah amen he say has he not spoken also by us and the Lord did what heard it did they say Moses heard it no watch what you talking in your bedroom watch what you talking in your homes watch what you talking in the car God is listening to you and you can get in trouble amen am verse three now the man Moses was how very Meek very humble that's right so because of humility it's very easy for people to trample on you that's right that's right if they see you quiet they say okay this is the one we can tackle amen amen above all the men which were upon the face of what the Earth so in other word if you screen everybody in the face of the Earth no body was as humble as Moses so very easy to stop I mean to trample on but very dangerous everybody okay everybody okay amen and the Lord spoke suddenly to who Moses I thought Miriam say the Lord speak to her I thought Aaron said the Lord speak to him why didn't go God go back to speak to them God went back to Moses that's right he went to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam come out all you three to the what Tabernacle of the congregation and the three did what came out in other way you you you come up here come here everybody okay everybody okay verse 5 and the Lord came down in the pillar of what the cloud and stood in the door of the what Tabernacle and called who Aaron and Miriam and they both came what came forth and he said hear now my word in other words listen to me carefully if there be a prophet among you amen I the Lord will make myself known to him in a what vision and I will speak to him in a what dream my servant Moses is not so I'm not reading me I'm reading God in other word god Moses was a prophet sir we all know that and God is taking Moses away from the rank of the prophet and he's putting Moses above he said Moses is not just a prophet like any other Prophet he's a prophet that is higher than all the prophets everybody okay he says more not so with Moses who is faithful in all my house with him Moses will I speak how mouth to mouth even how apparently openly and not in what dark speeches so when God was speaking to Moses God was not using symbols no sir like you see a white I mean a white horse right right there is coming up and he has a sword no he was talking to Moses plan this is what I'm trying to do this is what is going on but if it's another Prophet then God begin to give symbols amen am he says and the similitude of the Lord shall he what behold in other word if there is somebody that I even gave access to look at me how I look like it's Moses because Moses one time ask God I want to see you and God let him see him right am amen amen wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant who Moses you need to be careful what you talk about people that's right especially if they are used by God watch out because the caliber of the anointing it's telling you something watch out amen how can a man take his hand and put it where the angel of the Lord touch and his hand is matching the angel of the Lord and you come and you begin to talk again and you are challenging such a man foolishness amen amen and the anger of the Lord was kindered against them and he did what departed and the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle and behold what happened Miriam became leprous White as what snow remember last Sunday and Aron looked upon Miriam and behold she was half lepos that leprosy never hit Aon he only touched the woman let me leave it everybody okay everybody okay and Aaron said to Moses Ellas my brother no my Lord I don't know if you reading the Bible with me amen the one that disrespected is Moses when God came he struck and he struck Miriam and Miriam is lepos in other word and that leprosy brother Bram say that it was the last stage in now word Miriam is doomed Miriam is doomed with Leprosy at the last stage is there any Mercy Isaac is doomed with death is there any rescue Hallelujah Miriam did what is wrong spoke against the man of God is there a [Music] rescue this faith is a different caliber let's see what happened and Aaron said to Moses elas who my Lord who Lord who is my lordes now Moses become a what Lord is my Bible different than you no sir Moses is now called my Lord can you say amen amen am Aaron is talking to Moses he says elas my Lord I beseech who the he's begging to who Moses why is he not begging to god let's continue lay not the sin upon us has Moses the right to lay sin upon people Jesus is Moses at the position to be laying sin upon somebody Aaron is talking to who Moses he's talking to him using the word my Lord and he's saying do not lay your sin upon in other word you can sin against Moses let me help you because so we can move on quickly God told Moses when you go into Egypt and make you a [Applause] God we okay now so Moses is God and Aaron is addressing him like he's addressing God am because Aaron was the prophet of Moses God say I make you God and Aaron will be your Prophet so the prophet is talking to God that's why he said my Lord do not lay the sin upon this one in other word Moses have a right to exercise his VOR right as [Applause] God maybe I won't touch what I'm trying to preach maybe I won't touch what I'm trying to preach Abraham had the right to speak something and and and override that save the Lord that's right am am amen continue to swallow amen amen is it to strong if it's too strong we we put a rear and I begin to go back again to catch you where you are the problem is you don't know who you are when I told you inside of you it's God you don't understand everybody okay the faith of Abraham can go and change what God want and swap the sacrifice that's it amen so Aon is turning because God revealed to them clearly who Moses is and he understood that hey Moses is nobody it's God's body that's correct because God say I speak to him month to month then I need to go talk to God's body but when you talk to God's body he's calling him my Lord he said do not put the sin who can't sin is it Moses of God watch what is going on he says wherein ye have Sinn let's go to verse 11 and Aaron said to oh Moses alas my Lord I beseech you lay not the sin Upon Us amen wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have what sin who should have lay the sin it's it's who God not Moses watch verse 12 let not her let her not be as one dead and whom the fleshes have consumed when he when he comes out of his mother's womb in other word a still baby that was dead in a mother's womb when they come up they come up a little bit wiish like somebody who have uh what leprosy that's what it means verse 13 and Moses cried to the Lord saying do what heal her now oh God Amen so this sentence here whatever happened to Miriam that look like she's doomed she's in the last stage Moses turn around despite the fault of mam yes sir yes sir despite the fault of Miram yes sir I know you you have a hard time swallowing some of the stuff that is coming out despite the fault of Miriam everybody okay and Moses turned to God and said heal her now who is Moses that's if the Lord leprosy last stage who are you to change God's he says oh God heal her now oh God I do what bese thee so who's bleeding Moses and the Lord said to Moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed how many days seven days let her be shut out from the camp how many seven days and after that let her be received in how again amen so God give the remedy to cure M that's right based on what Moses said and he open up he said put her seven days outside and she's going to get healed Lord help me verse 15 and Miriam was shut out from the camp how many days seven days and the people did what Journey n that's it that's it come on amen am this is an exodus they have to leave Egypt all the way to the promised land the case of Miriam put a [Music] Breck let me go again this way the prayer of Moses because of his sister stop the program of God and delay the program of God s days until Miriam is back on track [Music] that's are we together are we together are we together the program of God was running but the faith of Moses goes and put a push a pause and say you cannot continue like this you solve this issue then we continue in other word you cannot continue this Exodus without Miriam going in hallelujah thank you [Applause] Lord do you understand what I'm saying if Miriam is left over we can not go to the promised [Music] [Applause] land the only way we can continue this journey M have to go back in track but she did something bad against the prophet of God that's fine there is a faith that can override yes sir thank you Lord I know some of you will be like oh don't worry my friend amen and Miriam was shut from the camp how many days seven days and the people Journey from Journey North until Miriam was brought in how again so until Miriam was healed then they took Miriam they put her back again amen amen and then the journey begin to continue because a leper must be outside the congregation but Miriam cannot continue like that they push the PA pull everything thing put her in and the journey continued who did that Moses who swap the lamb for Isaac Abraham are we together if you notice how many days does it take to heal the de leprosy how many days how many deeping does he take to to heal neon seven days hallelujah amen amen amen let's go to second king chapter 5 if you dare you can say Amen second Kings chapter 5 I'm going to skip some of them quickly because of the sake of time you know exactly what happened here that the faith is coming from the Lord girl amen jum to verse the remaining you can read that at home if you thereare you can say amen amen and he was so when elishah the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying why have you rent your clothes you know what it means let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet Where in Israel remember no one was healed from leprosy you remember that no one was healed from leprosy this is the first case that's going to be healed from leprosy and Elisha is putting his ministry his Prophet Mentor right there if it doesn't work there is no prophet in Israel but nobody was healed before everybody okay and neon so neon came with his horses and with his Chariot and stood at the door of the House of Elisha and Elisha sent a messenger to him saying go and do what wash in Jordan seven times seven times and your flesh shall come to you again and you shall be how clean from the same Le proed that Miriam had that's right verse 11 but neon was angry and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and do what strike his hand over so the faith of NE was the faith on what laying on on hand we went through that amen over the place and we call over the what leper everybody okay jum to verse 13 and his servant came near and spoke to him and say my father if the prophet had beat you to do something great would you not have done it how much rather then when he says to you wash and do what be clean then went he down and deep how many times seven times he deep himself seven time in the Jordan which is death the water of Jordan the water of separation we went through that last week according to the saying of the what man of God and his flesh came again like the Flesh of a little child and he was how clean he received a body change everybody okay everybody okay so the faith of this little girl the faith of this little girl is a faith that produce a body [Applause] [Applause] changing are we okay are we together let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you once again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father may you open again the windows of Heaven as you spoke in your word that when we ask rain you will send rain abundantly may you Reign abundantly again father in this service and bless your children forgive every sin every lack of consecration may you move that away from us Lord but may your mercy be upon us this morning as you speaking to us so that we can catch the mind of the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen my subject this morning is the four phases of rof the bride's faith this is where we stopped last week because I have to switch the sermon amen the sermon title we are still in the last phase of rof rof rewarded and we under the condition where rof is waiting for boas to finish the work of redemption so that boas will come and they can be United in the body they were already United by the word but they need a Corporal Union but before the Corporal Union something must be roof must be at a certain level at a certain State before she can meet back boas from the finishing of the work of redemption in the tabernac or when we transfer our data ruie is resting there being going into the transformation because when you stay in the presence of the Lord longer enough amen some of the D element begin to be transferred to you amen amen Moses spoke to God 40 days and when Moses begin to come down the face of Moses begin to shine so you cannot stay in the presence of the Lord and continue to remain the same when they took the road of Aaron they put that in the holiest the road never stay a joy stick when they came the next day they found out that the road bed he even brought fruit in 24 hours so as we staying Under the Sun in the presence of the Lord we are maturing every single day every Green Spot is coming off away and the mature spot begin to show in display because God is coming to take a bread that look like him because we must be like him we must be born of his bone flesh of his flesh and spirit of his Spirit any question so far what are we dealing with it today amen when we spoke in shifting to a great faith it was part 887 we found out clearly that brother brandham said that there is a problem in America he said the problem was on the laying on hand which was a Jewish tradition and it was not a gentile Faith traveling from that line brother Bram is saying this brother Bram say everything that is under his power and he recognized that what give him some more volume my brother yes get this one let's preach because you you usually say Amen yes so if nobody says amen it's going to work go ahead and try that one go ahead and say something amen glory to God okay he recognized that sickness and what sin and everything was under his what control he's talking about the Roman Centurion that he could do what control brother Bram say now I think that is the way we should see it how [Applause] today everybody okay he say I have tried for what years but see what does it there is many other brother on the field and they do what lay hands on the Seck and they have what great success brother Bram say he was trying to get the people to get to the level of speaking the word and something happened brother Bram say he tried for years but he found out that the people are still laying hand on the sick and as long as they lay hand on the sick and they recover the people still cling to that tradition because it is bringing result there it is Lord Jesus everybody okay if you still want me to lay hand on you in this church I will do it you will get result but that's not what God God is waiting for [Applause] you everybody okay brother Bram say they have great success and that way I just what broke it down and that and done what quit about a year ago brother Bram was discouraged he said I'm trying to pump them up but they are brother all over that keep laying hand and when they lay hand people are heal so when you come up you say you don't need that people don't get it they say so and so pray for me and I got here I'm reading brother Branham I'm not throwing any stone to anyone I'm just reading brother Bram so throw Stone to brother brandham everybody okay and brother brandham say well as long as I am in what America we shall just do what pray for the SI and do what lay hands on them in other word give them what they want that is exactly what right because I feel it bring a what the better result because every time I try they don't get it I try don't get it so what am I going to do if I have a meeting in America bring a prayer line lay hand on the sick that's what they want according to your faith that's what I do in America this is not me this is William Marion Bram what I want you to understand is this when it come to Healing God cannot be cornered to one [Applause] spot when you take God and you make God to only act one way you make God [Applause] an I have a quote my friend listen to brother Bram brother Bram say I said well God is the only one that do what can heal sir I say the Bible don't lie and the Bible say I am the Lord that do what heals all your disease and say the Bible cannot lie I say God healed by what medicine everybody here will say Amen to that God heals by what love God heals by what an understanding how can God heal by understanding I'm trying to open you up now so you can get away from medicine you can get away from laying on hand God can You by understanding when you understand you get [Music] [Applause] healed is it too [Applause] strong God healed by what care but he heals by care God's healed by what prayer God heals by what Miracle the whole thing is God doing what heals that's all all there is to it he's the what the Healer second one William Marion brandham he says we believe that doctor help people I believe that God heals by what medicine God heals by what surgery God heals by what understanding God heals by what love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them see God heals by what love God heals by what prayer God heal by what Miracle God healed by what his word god healed whatever Source it is God heals by it it is God that do what heals for he said what I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases now brother brother I'm say God heal by understanding what does he mean because when you talk about understanding the brother in the message called that intellectual ah this is intellectual this is intellectual this is intellectual and the many time when they say that because they cannot laun in the [Applause] deep but God can heal you by [Applause] understanding in the book of Acts chapter 28 verse 27 the Bible say for the heart of these people is what wax grow and their ear are dull of what hearing and their eyes have they what closed lest they should see with their eyes and he with their ears and understand with the what [Music] heart everybody okay so you understanding where understand in the heart what is in the heart that understand it's called what can I continue but uh uh uh Paul is saying let the uh uh Paul is saying lest they should see with the what eyes and hear with the what ears and understand with the what heart and should be how converted that understanding brings conversion and brother Bram say converted beings you receive the Holy Ghost in other word this understanding is called [Applause] Revelation the new birth is a personal revelation when you understand with your heart you can receive the Holy Ghost [Applause] you can receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on hand but according to Cornelius which is the Gentle Way while the preaching is going on when the preacher is preaching your heart will just open up and the Holy Spirit will come down and baptize [Applause] you Hallelujah everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay Hallelujah he says and you should be how converted come and should what heal them let me read it again and understand with the what heart when you understand with your heart he brings what conversion and he brings also what healing so God can heal byond this [Applause] standing so when the word is going on and the preaching of the word is going on God will stck your heart and a revelation will open up to you once the Revelation is opening up he will give you spiritual thing and also natural things because it's called Soo it is the healing of the Soul which bring conversion and the healing of the body all of them is a package it is a combo God cannot give you the Holy Ghost and then refuse to heal your body if he give you the Holy Ghost he can also heal your body if he give you the Holy Ghost by Revelation he can heal your body by revelation God heals by revelation God heal by understanding God heal when his word come struck the seed and you jump up you say praise the Lord thank you Jesus for healing me glory to [Applause] God I'm opening you up what do you want what do you want you want to go to the emergency room all the time God will heal you by medicine but I'm tired off emergency room I don't to go pay all the [Applause] [Music] time today provision tomorrow

walk in a valley of death even if I'm myself I feel no evil why because you are with [Applause] me the healer is with me I don't need to bother the pastor I don't need to call the Deacon me and my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] god brother Bram say the purpose of the message is not to bring people to to me not to bring people to Jeffersonville he said it's to establish a personal contact between the believer and [Applause] God [Applause] hallu father help me up we are soaring pretty good my friend listen to brother Branham he says so my Ministry has never been how very effective in the United States Say Amen amen my Ministry has never been very effective way in the United States because the people has been trained the what all Jewish tradition of what laying hands on the sick so the laying hand on the sick is actually a [Applause] [Music] Hindu let me help you up again I'm reading brother Bram I will continue to lay hand on you because we are different level of Faith but if I continue for a long time I'm actually hindering your growth I cannot continue to give you milk every day at a certain time I must change to much potato until you can eat a steak because you need to [Applause] grow when are we going to stop the praying line we start doing it for years we are continuing to do it and the people are waiting for the prayer line every meeting you don't need my hand you need the hand of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] maker I hope you are awake brother brandham says he says that never was what and the American people are taught that the what lay hands on the sick when jiah's daughter was dead jiah said to Jesus him being what a Jew continue my brother come lay your hand on my daughter and she'll live and she will live continue but when the Gentile son was saved he said I'm not worthy that you come out under my roof but just do what speak the word and my servant had shall do what live Jesus did what turn to the Jews and did what said I don't find Faith like that in Israel see the Gentile way is to what accept his word and this is the word of who God and I believe that every bit of it is what God's word hallelujah are we okay Shake somebody and tell them get ready to swallow what is coming are you ready when you ready you H aen when you ready you you H aen amen are you ready amen are we ready [Applause] amen hallu are we ready listen to brother Bram I do what believe that God can do things that he has not written in the [Applause] word it is not me my friend please make sure you put that on the screen remove my face put the prophet [Applause] face h h [Applause] what a statement what a statement let me start it again I do believe that what God can do what things that he has not what written in the word brother Bram say he believed that in other word take your limit off of God are you struggling do you think the prophet will contradict the Bible so how can brother BR make a statement like this let me stabilize you with the scripture okay because if I don't stabilize one will be in the air floating I'm just accepting it because they just say you just have to believe brother Bram so that's why I'm accepting it but uh-uh I don't know to be honest with you I struggle with that let me help you [Applause] struggling everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody ready in John chapter what 21 verse what 25 and there are also what many other things which who Jesus did the which if it should be how R everyone as suppose that even the what itself could not what contain the book that was what to be written what [Applause] [Music] amen the prophet will never contradict the Bible the Bible said there are many things that Jesus has done that is not written in this book that's why brother brandom say God can do things that are not written in the Bible so don't come and limit me to what God can do in my [Applause] life don't limit me do you have the book if you don't have the book leave me alone because we we are in the age of the seven ters the things that are not wi we know how to pull them [Applause] out [Music] [Applause] why do you believe God is going to do that there were miracle that Jesus did your Bible don't have it but we got a prophet that went in the mind of God and told me all things are [Applause] [Music] possible don't limit your faith to what is in the Bible we need to go beyond now [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay Have I Lost You Have I Lost You oh god father help me up brother Bram say I do believe that God do what do things do things that he has not what written in the word now you are stable amen there is what plenty in there for me to deal with just what he what promis it's in the word I do not want anything less or what anything more but I want all his what promises because he died that I might have them so healing is what one of his [Applause] promises so we are continuing to tell you that we move we need to move from the laying on hand amen into a great the faith and that Faith you must just speak the word because as long as you linger here you are blocking the very Ministry that God sent you by your tradition you are making the word of God of what none of effect your Jewish tradition you are blocking the spoken [Applause] word it is good when you are new to the message but as we continue to grow we must move also up our faith have to clim higher let's go to the book of galatian let's look at these two people let's go to galatian chapter 2 Oh Glory to God glory glory let's go to the book of Galatians chapter 2 I mention to you about Peter and Paul amen we got Peter and we got Apostle Paul amen amen amen milk is good it's good for a season amen you don't take a 40 years old man and you see me with a bottle how big should be the bottle a big one like this when I'm 40 years old I'm taking milk for supplement it's not my my diet if not we need to go to a m all the time and say I'm waiting for my b a torture to our mother a torture to our churches [Applause] am everybody okay everybody okay do you know that when brother brandham was praying for the sick he was getting tired do you know that he was losing strength until they have to pack him up why a brother have to suffer all the time why can't you take God at his [Music] [Applause] word we have to keep a preacher for 3 hours until he's worn out because the people want to Babys seated they

2 if you dare you can say Amen amen I'm talking about Peter and and uh Paul verse S if you thereare you can say amen amen the Bible says this Galatians 2:7 this is Paul speaking Paul says but contras when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision uncircumcision means the Gentile because we were not under the law of circumcision it was the Jews that were circumstanced you understand that right if not you tell me I load you with scripture he says for the gospel of the uncircumcised in other word the gospel of the Heathen or the Gentile was committed to who me and the gospel of the who circumcision the Jews was to who Peter so according to the scripture P Peter is sent to who and Paul is sent to who Gentiles the Gentile or the hidden this is UN circumstance and these are circumstance it's two line okay there's two lane on this highway there is an Highway for Peter and there is a Highway for Paul you need to stay on your lane because we keep Crossing Lane and it's causing accident if there is a solid yellow line in a midle it tell you do not pass stay on your lane amen let's go to verse eight for he that R what effectually in other words he that worketh effectually in who Peter to be what the apostleship of the circumcision the same was m in who me toward the who Gentile Paul is saying in Peter God is working powerfully but he's working powerfully toward the who the Jews but in me he's working mly toward the who the Gentiles verse n and when James seas and who John who seems to be what pillars perceive the grace that was given to me they gave to me and bar and Barnabas the right hand of what Fellowship that we should go to the who Heathen and day to the who the circumcision so when they understood Paul they said brother we're doing the same work shake your hand we recognize that you have uh a Ministry for from the Lord you go to the Gentile we will going into the Jews so the gospel split in two line there is a Jewish Bland Lan and there is also a gentle Lan are you following me please stay up I know what I'm talking about let's go now to the book of act chapter 3 Let's see Peter and Paul the two line Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah if you thereare you can say Amen act chapter 3 we are looking at the case of Peter and we're looking at the case of Paul Paul to the Gentile Peter to the Jewish people everybody clear yes sir glory to God if you dare you H amen amen everybody there amen now let's go to verse one the Bible said now who Peter and John Peter and John went up together into the water temple at the water Hour of Prayer being the what n9th hour now we found Peter here we started with Peter who is the Apostle to the to the Jews the Bible say in verse two and a certain man was how lay from what his mother's womb pushed the break Peter and John goes to the temple they find a man that was born are we are you following me amen the man is lame or his creeper amen from his mother's womb from his mother's womb everybody okay we are talking about pet did you see Paul here let's go verse two from his mother whom was carried whom they lay daily at the gate at of the temple which is called what beautiful to ask arm of them that enter into the water temp I know you know the story but follow me who seeing who Peter and John about to go into the temple he asked Anam just what he does every day a gift and Peter fastening his eyes upon him not John who's talking Peter on the day of Pentecost who talk Peter watch and Peter fastening he Eyes Upon uh uh uh fastening his eyes upon him with John say look on who us and he gave he to them expecting to receive something of them then who who's speaking Peter Peter say what Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I do what give thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth do what rise up and walk stop Peter look at the man and when Peter look at the man he say silver and gold I don't have it I don't have dollar bill what I have I'm going to give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ do what rise up and walk and walk did the man Rose yes stop let's go to next verse follow me carefully somebody's going to scream soon did you see it did you see it did you see it did you see it when they say rise and spoke rise and walk the man should rise and begin to walk but the man is not Rising the man is still sitting waiting for the prayer [Applause] line is my Bible different than yours sir let's go to the next verse and he did what took him by the right hand the hand they're laying on hand they have to make a body contact so they speaking that they say a rise and walk was enough but it's a Fai of the Jew they don't work like that they don't have the mechanism to operate the spoken word because the spoken word cannot be found in Israel it is a faith that is found in the Gentile so even though Peter is pushing the man is still looking Peter say no no no no no no no no come on man come on manise and walk they have to rise the men to walk they want a body contact are you there verse seven he took him by the water right hand and did what lifted him up and immediately his feet was what and ankles was what receive strength and they and he did what leaping up still and did what walk and enter with them into what the temple doing what walking and leaping and what praising God so for this man to be healed they have to physically hold him and pull him up so that the stri can come in his faith is laying on the [Applause] hand have I lost you let's turn our caliber toward Paul let's see what happened to Paul remember this man was L from what his mother's womb let's go to act chapter 14 if you dare you can say Amen father help me up I have to put as many screws as we can act chapter 14 if you there you can say amen amen you there amen listen carefully act Chapter 14 verse what verse 8 you there amen the Bible say and there set a what a certain man at what lra this is no longer in Israel you ready this man sat there from listra he was how important in important in what his feet being a what a how from his mother's womb am I reading a different Bible this man is dealing with Paul he's also from where his mother's womb then the seals are open the Bible become a new book everybody okay every day the Bible is a new book let's see what happened my friend and the Bible says he was important for in his feet bring creeper from his mother's womb everybody okay being from his mother womb who never had what what what is the difference between that man and the man that was in the gate beautiful any difference no sir they all in the same condition let's see Paul everybody okay verse uh n then uh what the same heard who Paul speak Paul was preaching who steadfastly behold what him Peter told the man do what look Paul also put his eyes to begin to look at who the man who steadfastly amen beholding him and Paul did what perceiving that he had Faith to be what healed follow me carefully are we together are we together Peter look at the man he said look at me the man begin to look under expectation Paul also is preaching Paul put his eyes and begin to look at the man and he perceived that the man was what having faith to be here look right here verse 10 Paul now said with a what a loud voice voice do you follow me Paul is looking at the man standing right there like brother Angelo or brother Isaiah sitting there and he's looking at the man and Paul perceive faith in the man and Paul didn't say come here so I can pray for you Paul looked at him and he said with a loud voice listen to him he says with a loud voice he did what stand ight on thy feet Peter say to the man what rise up and do what walk did the man arose no look at Paul Paul say with a loud voice he say stand up on your feet and he did what leap and walked who touch this man [Music] nobody this man took PA at his word because he's a gentile and the ground is operated under a faith of spoken word not a faith of laying on hand in the Jewish arise and walk they're looking at you until they have to pack him and say walk in the GLE stand up and walk that's all I need say only speak the word word that's all I want and the man himself did what leap and walked and he be to walk leap what happened when he leaped and walk look at verse 11 and when the people saw what what Paul had done they lift up their what their voices saying in the speech of what like like what did they say the gods are come down to us in the likeness of [Applause] man you didn't get what he means you didn't get what he means I'm I'm I'm giving you time to soak that [Music] in did you get it did you get it you didn't get it when the word is spoken and the and the man who was sick is picking up God from the spoken word the man was healed without Paul making anybody contact with him when the Gentiles saw that they say that the godsall have come in human [Applause] flesh let me read it again let let's read it again let's read it again my friend they saying in the speech of the lonian the gods are what come down to us they come to us in the what likeness of in other words the gods become human being in other words Paul must be a God the word is made flesh hallu [Music] and God promis his word in this and time must be made flesh in his BR amen and according to the Gentile when the word the spoken word is taken and men are rising up and get healed they say no no no no this is God in human flesh hallah that's the faith God is calling you to not the faith of Peter we are not Jews you need to know your lane stay on your lane you are a [Applause] gent your passport is an American passport why do you want to behave like a Jew you are a gentile why do you want to be like a Jew the are different than the Jew the Jew they have to push they have to do some K do that this do that and then you walk you don't need that the word is [Applause] sufficient you will look at people you say rise up and say amen and you see somebody sitting in [Music] church and some of them you will see they sitting like this say Amen rise up and say amen rise up and say Amen rise up and say Amen they are waiting for the prayer [Music] line when you are sitting on the Pew you should be wedding when they say rise up and say Amen you you say [Applause] Amen what's wrong with people in the message what's wrong with people in the message what's wrong is people in the message this message came to remove you from a Pentecostal tradition the tradition of prayer line big meeting prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line demonstration on the pit that's not what God was coming [Applause] for when the word is coming Paul spoke and say l arise and walk the man didn't wait for Paul as soon as Paul said the Bible say he leaped but if the word is coming you are standing and you are watching you are waiting for certain things to be spoken like preacher so and so you want me to reflect another preacher in the message I don't have any preacher to reflect I have the message to reflect [Applause] when the word is coming that's the faith God is calling you to a faith where you sitting you rise up and you say I got it I was praying for my son and God spoke that believe for your son I don't need to go to the prayer line I will rise up and say that man didn't know me but what he spoke belongs to me father I take [Applause] I have not start my friend he says brother Bram say he said just do what speak the word speak the word and what my servant will live now that is a what a higher plane not the lower plane

hardest SP ever had because that devil knew that he met a what faith on a different level no on a different level than what the apostles had he met a what perfect faith that is what we must have what perfect Faith to make the what perfect word perform how perfectly the message is already perfect my time is up my friend my time is up my friend God sent a perfect message a perfect Faith because Paul

be that's we must believe it without Shadow of Doubt when God spoke that s [Applause] it brother Bram I gave you quote brother Bram said that's why his ministry is not effective he said I try I try I have to stop and give them what they want because I'm pushing something better they don't want it they want to stay with the other Faith they want to be laid hand on they want the prayer line all the
