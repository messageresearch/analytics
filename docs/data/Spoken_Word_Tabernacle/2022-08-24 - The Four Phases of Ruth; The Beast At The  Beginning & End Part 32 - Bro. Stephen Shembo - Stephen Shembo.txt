a little time to review the seals few okay praise god i hope you already know the seals we spoke about the seals so many times so you should be good with the seals amen how many are up to date with the sermon you will hear that question over and over amen blessed be the name of the lord this coming saturday lords willing at three o'clock that's what they told me will be sister rebecca's wedding shower amen so make sure you get there in christian time [Music] i don't want to say american time somebody would say no what about the other nation in christian time in other words be there on time amen don't come there 20 or 40 or two hours late that's not good amen and then at four o'clock brother robert told me that there is like uh man's you know what it is look at your text the the message has been emailed sent to everybody so you should be looking at the text and make sure you stay online amen so at three o'clock is for the sister at four o'clock it's something for the brother all of them are connected with uh wedding shower amen so make sure you're there they say three o'clock and four o'clock on the other side christian time amen our next house meeting will be on september the 24th so today we are on august the 24th we give you september the 24th that's what brother robert told me right yeah september the 24th is that correct okay say it again the fun day for the kids okay so you had tight on that one we figured out what to do but so far they told me september the 24th amen so you'll get the confirmation by sunday lord's willing amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture tonight i was about to say this morning amen if you know the seals already that's fine praise god if you don't know the seals i don't know what you've been looking at because we went over and this message will always navigate with sales all the time so you better just go ahead and make sure you understand the seals because when i'll say there's still there's no way you can preach this message without any i mean moving with the seals because the sales open the entire word of god amen so if you don't know the seals by this time it's not my fault it's your thought we went through that in the old church we went through that again on the the good samaritan so we display everything in detail so you should be ready when we say well who is the first uh anointing who's the second anointing who's the third anointing all of that you should be familiar amen all right let's go to genesis chapter 1 verse 20. i need to move up a little bit so we'll be good on sunday let's see how the lord were directed if you dare you can say amen i know it's wednesday if you're there you can say amen some folks are not here so you need to double on the amen amen verse 20 genesis chapter 1 verse 20. the bible says and god say let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life amen and the fowl that may fly above the earth in an open firmament of heaven you might be seated if you look here there are two categories created here the first one is the creature in the water everybody clear we okay creatures in water amen so you got your whales your crocodile and everything there and the second category are the foul of the air amen you got your ego your clothes everything else so stay tight now the way it's spoken in uh verse 20 the bible say let the waters bring forth amen you will think that the birds were created by water because the bible say let the water bring forth amen it looks like the bird and the creature in the seas and the fishes were created by water but that's not that's not the truth let's go to verse 21 and god created great wealth everybody okay these are the creature of the sea god created great dwells it's not me it's the seals that are doing this to the bible it's not me i have nothing to do with this amen the god created great wealth and every living creature that moves everybody okay so the creatures of this sea which the water brought forth abundantly everybody okay after their kind and every wing foul after it's gone and god saw that he was good so if you stuck right there you will think that the creature of the sea and the fall of the air were created by water if they were created by water if a fish die and you leave it there any rocks we should see water coming out make sense but when a fish die if you leave a creature there you'll find out that no water will come out of it it will turn into the dust we [Laughter] [Music] let me help you a little bit let me help you go to genesis 2 chapter 19 so we'll come back to this so let's stabilize because sometimes people look at me like i'm writing a new bible that i'm not writing a new bible i'm just reading the whole bible amen genesis 2 chapter 19. if you dare you can say amen and out of the water the lord god form every and every water so the fallout form from what we okay now now you're stable okay so the fowl comes from the ground in other words from the earth or to me more precise the dust everybody okay okay the foul we found out that they come from the dust what about the creature in the water the bible says it was the water let's the water bring forth if you stuck in genesis one you will think that god created the fowl and the creature of the sea from the water that's not true god created them from the earth don't worry my friend we will navigate the bible says this in the book of psalms 104 verse 24 the bible says that so is this great whoever is on the computer work with me so is this great and wide sea everybody okay wearing are things creeping innumerable in the sea both small and great beasts in the sea there go the ship there is the leviton whom god has made to play the ring these all this creature wait upon thee that the mayors give them their meat in water if god can give the creature of the sea food in due season whatever human being that's why we have the message in this season everybody okay he said that that gives them the gather that hand they are what filled with goods the hardest that face they are water that takes away their breath when they are killed they do water and return to the so the creature of the sea are made out of water any question my friend so number one the creature of the sea are made out of water and the fall of the air are made out of water i love this church now let's go back to our scripture genesis chapter 20 of chapter one we already read chapter verse 21 and 21 jump to verse 24 if you dare you can say amen i hope you there and god say let the water the dust again let the earth bring forth the living creature after it comes cuddle creeping things and the beast of the earth after its water so we see the third category here we have the cuddle we have the beast where your serpent was there and we have the creeping things amen all of them are coming from what the dust the ground or the earth or the dust we okay so when god created the creature in the water dust created the fire dust created the beast the caddo the creeping things dust we okay job to verse uh 27 now we're going to another category we okay category number four the bible say so god created man now we are creating man we okay he created man in his own image not an animal the man this man is first at the image of god in the image of god we will see what is the image of god down the road amen and so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him one person we okay but that hymn is male and water you see now so this man they call him him but in him we got man and female so from the beginning god himself is not homosexual [Music] right from the beginning anybody okay so it's a perversion so from god he's both male and female i will show you that down the road we will go through the scripture we okay now he created him male and female created he water so now in him we have them amen everybody okay what substance did god use here to create man everybody okay everybody okay god according to john chapter 4 verse 26 god is a spirit 24-26 everybody okay and he created man in his honor and in his own water was jesus born here because we know jesus is god but jesus was now born here go back to genesis one [Music] you are slowing me down let's go to verse two let's go to verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the water and the water the water your boss just dropped me right here so i can help somebody the spirit of god so who was creating the spirit of god if god if man was made in the image and the likeness of god what kind of man was that er what everybody okay now your boss just dropped it he is merciful so this man was created a spirit we okay now creature dust far dust cuddle beast creeping things dust man we don't see any dust we okay now now let's go to genesis chapter two [Music] you love it job two verse seven i wish the whole church was here amen you there and the lord god four men not created he is already created [Music] brother kelly can i put it up again this is what i want to put it down scripture doesn't play with water keep that in this church whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eye to do whatever it's there for uh so when you read your bible be very careful you are reading the living word of god everybody okay now in verse 8 and 7 the bible say and the lord god formed not created they already created man but they created him a spirit amen now god is forming not creating he's forming forming man out of the water so man a spirit in man there is male and female now god is creating man from the dust anybody okay but instead of creating male and female from the dust god pick just the mail are you reading your bible and then he pulled the mail out of the grinder or the dust but the female is stuck in the spirit we okay now let's go back again creature in the water fire can't be scripting things male female just relax just relax relax we'll be okay amen now when he form men out of the dust of the ground god breathed everybody when he formed this creature nobody nowhere in the scripture did the bible say god breath [Music] when he created the fire the bible didn't say god breathed on the farm amen are we okay when he created the car that they beat the creeping thing they never said god brief of them but when he created man who looks like god in the image and the likeness of god then god breathes on adam we okay god breathes on adam [Music] amen not mind breathing it's god when we say breathing we're looking anybody care and he breathed into his nostril the water i thought adam was already living [Music] he the breath of life who detain life it's the tree of life which is christ anybody okay he breathed the breath of life and man became a water man didn't become a soul because he was already a spirit okay and the spirit of human being has a nature everybody okay and the nature of that spirit we went through this already is water that's why i usually tell you go back home and sit and review the sermon everybody okay but here when god briefed on adam adam became a living soul everybody here in other words when god took man the man and put him on the in the body that was formed from the dust of the earth everybody okay god look in the man and see man in three parts [Music] over here man was spirit and soul we okay but over here man is now body spirit and water when god saw this everybody okay god breathed into the soul we okay and this sir became a living soul amen amen don't worry my friend let job to verse 19 you there verse 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field you saw that already there and every file of the air you saw that there and brought them to who to see there is something here let me just leave it alone yeah that will unfold a lot of stuff okay let's just leave it alone amen did you see him forming the fishes here yeah there is a reason why let's leave it alone amen and brought them to adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof everybody okay and adam gave name to all caddo and to all file of the air and to every beast of the field you don't see fishes there anybody okay but for adam there was not found air help made for him in other words everything was created from the dust dust dust except amen we okay now praise god jump to verse 21 and the lord god calls a deep sleep to fall upon whom and he slept and he took the ground or the dust [Music] he took water when god want to pull this woman out amen god is pulling the woman from a rib which is a finished product everybody okay creature dust far dust can be scrapping things dust man dust woman no dust we okay when brother branham says things perfectly in line with the scripture and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib this is clear of the rib not the dust amen the rib is a dust that has been already in morphe anybody here amen amen the weed which the lord has taken for man made he a woman and brought her to the man and adam say now say this is now dust of my dust this is water [Music] finished product not dust this is born of my bones and flesh of my flesh amen she shall be called a woman because she was taken out of men everybody okay so far let's go to chapter 3 verse 6 lord have mercy but robert wednesday wednesday wednesday if you're there you can say amen chapter 3 verse 6. you okay all right and when the woman so not even that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired we went through this on sunday to make one wise we went through this on sunday she took off the fruit thereof we know what the fruit means now and did it we know what that eating means and gave also to her husband with her and he did water who gave adam the fruit the woman everybody adam got the fruit from the woman so it was the woman that gave adam the fruit everybody okay the devil never gave adam the fruit we okay the devil or satan who was in the garden of eden according to ezekiel gave enter into the serpent everybody here and the serpent went into eve everybody okay this is the the chain and eve went into adam amen so the serpent in the uh the satan in the serpent the old serpent becomes the devil you understand that now then the devil took the teaching into eve all the woman and the woman took it to the you see the chain you got to discern this and discern this and desert that one we okay job to verse 12 let's pray so we can move on heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this wednesday service unto the hand lord may the holy spirit guide us may you move every demonic spirit away from us lord into the dry places in the name of jesus christ may you come tonight lord father and minister your to your children in a powerful way lord father like never before father we commit this service unto the hand be the alpha and the omega father in the name of jesus christ amen everybody okay so far job to verse 12 you there and the men say now god is coming investigating adam what happened and the men say the woman whom you gave to be with me she did water she gave me water [Music] she gave me of the water so the tree was already with the woman everybody okay the tree was already transferred here and then it was given to adam everybody okay let me explain to you this clearly you okay the woman that gave adam the fruit is not the woman that adam marry let's go slowly relax if you go this way you're going to lose it just relax i'm going to explain it to you clearly the woman that got married to adam amen was pure from god everybody here everybody okay but the woman that gave adam the fruit was the woman that was now polluted [Music] everybody here eve has been now designed you remember in the hotel the devil doesn't i already explained to you the devil doesn't go in the hospital looking at women and then babies and begin to design you're going to make certain a creator that's wrong the way you are you are beautiful the way god created you and that beauty comes from god the beauty of the devil is a different beauty when a baby is born she's a woman she's a girl that beauty comes from god [Music] message believer need to adjust their their teaching everybody here the designing of the world of satan is not the discerning of the baby it is the discerning of a woman everybody here they support and discern the woman by sex we already went through this in the hotel everybody okay everybody okay so eve was not the innocent eve but here she was not innocent anymore she has been already uh uh uh what i can marred by the serpent so the woman that give the tree to a man is a woman that has been mixed with immorality we okay because he's committed adultery you remember such is the way of an adulterous woman when she eat it everybody okay she was a married woman everybody okay she brought to adam something out of immorality everybody okay the eve that was created from adam was pure but the devil the correct word is the fire amen the devil defiled eve and it's the defile if that is a trouble to adam we okay now not the original eve [Music] do you get my message the sister that is in the church that is filled with the holy spirit she's not your trouble it is the immoral woman outside that is your trouble we okay now i hope we can adjust the teaching in the message designed by the devil designed by the deaf so your wife was designed by the devil really you making certain a creator that design is when they give you high heels then they give you a different shape that you are not born with we went through the hotel about there about the high heel he pushes the woman forward and backward you are not like that when you get home you take your high heel off you become now normal [Music] the high heel design you in fashion you differently go to the hotel we deal with the high heel we give you all things and even the pictures and everything we okay job to verse 17 you are consuming time in let's go to verse 17. now you want to tell me to wednesday let's go to verse 17. you there and to adam he said because you okay you have hearken to the water of your water was really that the voice of eve he was the voice of who which was the voice of who we okay now so the eve had another voice we okay we okay so the devil use the serpent right we okay as a syringe we okay to inoculate something into eve and if we automatically transfer that to adam i hope young folks understand the whole church is not here hopefully they're going to follow up amen because you have hearken to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree who gave him the tree eve of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it curses the ground for your sake in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life amen in other words the woman made adam break the commandment am i reading a different bible praise god let's go to revelation chapter 17 then we fly because my flat is the next one so you're gonna hear the engine moving up so keep sit down everybody okay revelation chapter 17 some flight already went forward so mine is now on the line we were moving slowly at the airport you know how we move and then you get online and one goes out it knows the second one so it's on it's going to go everybody okay revelation chapter 17 verse one somebody will really one day get in the airplane like i need to feel what brother stephen usually say revelation 17 chapter one verse one and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying to me come here i will show you the judgment of a great water is a war is a a pure woman we okay in revelation we found a great why a why does the devil want a to do what to do what with a to do something to men everybody okay that sits upon many water we will go through that later on jump to verse uh four and the woman was array in purple and scarlet color and deck with gold and precious stone and perils having a golden cup in her hand full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication so she's not faithful everybody okay job to verse five and upon her forehead was the name written what's your name missy water so this woman is a mystery water if we don't preach mystery how do you gonna understand this amen mystery babylon they're great she's a mother everybody okay of water so this woman have babies ever care but all her babies are still harlots etc all of them harlots so she is not only a harlot herself everybody here she is not only a harlot herself everybody okay but she is also a producer of her lord amen because the babies are the fruit of the womb so the fruit of her womb amen are still harlot we okay she is a harlot but she is also a producer of harlots are we okay praise god now let's go to uh revelation 18 glory to god verse one and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having a great power and the earth was lightened with his glory you know that angel right you don't know him see me after church i'll give you a quote it is your [Music] you messenger get me it is brother pranama i'm not ashamed we don't play game now hide and seek in the message hide and seek in the message let's go back to the bible where were you what were you preaching [Music] amen amen and he cried madly with a strong voice saying what babylon de water we okay babylon the water do you see the bird babylon degrade his water so this engine is crying that babylon is coming down because when he come there the whole earth is enlightened there is a light that is coming through this angel there is an evening light everybody okay babylon degrade his water and his water confirmed twice and he's become the uh habitation of devils satan was here satan got into the water and then from the serpent he jumped into him so eve was a possessor of something that was wrong and this woman become the habitation of devils so devils enter here [Music] we okay now do you follow that okay she became a habitation of devil and the hold of every fowl spirit and a cage of every water and cleaning water in other words the devil poured himself here satan and his kingdom poor here at the beginning he entered the serpent we okay [Music] job two verse four at three for all nations have drunk off the wine of the wrath of her water so this woman as soon as the devil get in here he can affect every nation every nation every nation amen all nation amen have drunk off the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed water with her and the merchant of the earth are works which through the abundance of her delicacies verse 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of here my people that you be not partaker of her that you receive not her water so there is a plague that is coming up into this woman remember the serpent had a plague in the garden of eden he moved from a beast into a snake it was a temporary judgment which is a plague you need a court you see me we okay so far now my subject tonight is the four faces of roof babylon and the wings of the ego can i repeat it again the four faces of roof babylon and the wings of ego we okay keep tight we are still on the threshing floor we under the parable of the 10th virgin dealing with the second oil in our tabernacle we are deep very deep in the holiest amen when we talk about the parable of the uh the tenth virgin we found out that on sunday that the midnight cry was connected with a ministry you remember that it was connected with a ministry and that ministry was a prophetic ministry you remember on sunday which was a capstone ministry remember on sunday and that ministry the purpose was to produce rapturing faith you remember on sunday hallelujah and this ministry is connected to the second one now if you watch verse 7 the bible says that when the midnight cry was made that behold the bridegroom cometh go here to meet him then all the virgins arose and they did trim their lamps amen so they meet this message everybody okay the message that is coming from the introducer from the announcer from the forerunner from the messenger that message have a message in itself for cleansing or for purification amen because when the message came and the virgin awoke work automatically they're beginning to clean up their lamps [Music] everybody so you cannot have the message without a clean life [Music] everybody here if you see somebody deep in the message of brother branham and still living unclean they got the message intellectually [Music] amen when the message began to affect your life automatically the message will purge you amen whether it's the mystery part of the message or it's what you call the simple part of the message let's go to daniel 12 lord help me i thought i'm going to move quick let's go to daniel chapter 12. we read this quite a bit when it's talking about the standards you remember daniel heard the thunders and they told him that he was not for you he wanted to understand they said no no no no that's not for you that's for the end time amen verse 9 and he said go your way daniel for the words are closed up and they are water until the time of the water always to the end amen what are the words of this book going to do many shall be water and made water and the water so if the seals are broken [Music] by the second oil what do you expect the message of the seal to do purify and make somebody water because the bride will be with us but our wrinkle [Music] so you need a message that's gonna purify the blood please the bread make her pure with that spot without wanker to meet the problem [Music] everybody okay so far now we are dealing with the beast and we found out that the beast from the beginning let me go this way we got a beast everybody okay we got a beast at the beginning at the beginning there is a beast amen and that beast we found out that he was the serpent everybody okay but brother branham say and the beast is also at the end let me go this way he said the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden that was the serpent and the serpent became the devil the old serpent everybody okay and he is the beast at the end and he shows that he is a religious person and a water a denomination that do water everybody okay at the end the beast at the end everybody okay the beast at the end is a a denomination we okay that makes water we okay it's a harlot that produces our lots we okay now so at the end the business a woman and the beast is also a religious person why are we going to the beginning brother branham say that in the beginning we have the beast and the beast at the beginning is a serpent amen but as you move forward through the chair at the end we also have a beast but the beast at the end number one it's a religious person everybody okay number two it is a denomination a denomination that made the denomination amen and a denomination is a church and a church is a woman amen so it's a church that produces churches that are also denomination we okay now we okay now praise god why are we going back to the garden of eden the way we did to study this beast the bible says in isaiah 46 10 that god declaring the end from water so the beginning already have the end everybody okay god when he's declaring the end he declare it from the beginning everybody okay that's why we to understand the end you need to go back to the beginning because the beginning already declared the end that's why the bible says the old serpent which is the devil you need to go to the old serpent to understand how the devil works that's why brother branham said the seventh seal was in genesis everybody here and the seventh still was in revelation but if you wanna understand the seventh seal better you need to go back to the beginning because the beginning already declared the end are we okay i'm reading the bible he said declaring the end from the beginning in other words for you to understand what is happening now you need to go back to the beginning and understand the beginning once you catch the beginning you will begin to decode the end quickly everybody okay so far because the beginning is genesis and the end is the revelation apocalypse unfolding unveiling opening breaking everybody okay so from ancient time the things that are not done because even the lamb of god was slain where before the foundation of the world if you want to understand what jesus is doing at the cross you need to go back to the beginning even when marriage and divorce was given to jesus christ jesus said at the beginning in other words let's go back to the beginning then you will understand marriage and divorce at the beginning god created one man and one female that is the [Music] beginning everybody okay he says my cursed self shall stand and i will do all by my water it's all by the pleasure of god now if we're going to the beginning the bible says in number chapter 16 that and they fell verse 22 upon their faces and say oh god the god of the spirit of water all flesh number 27 verse 16 let the lord the god of the spirit of water so our flesh get their spirit from god amen everybody here so when eve is saying that i got a child from the lord it doesn't mean that cain is a child of god cain was a son of the devil but every spirit must come from god amen we okay first corinthians 15 39 the bible say our flesh is not the same flesh but there is one can the flesh of water we see in the category another flesh for water another fresh for water another flesh for water we okay let's go back here there is another flesh there is a flesh for man we okay there is a flesh for beast we okay there is a flesh for what fishes we okay and there is a flesh for water all categories are given by power where did paul learn this thing amen and all the spirit of everything here comes from god everybody okay now we found out that when god created he created the fishes and the great were from the dust he created the fire from the dust he created the car that they beat the creeping friends from the dust when he created man first man was a spirit and then man was both male and female but he pulled the male part and made the male part exactly the way he made the cutter the way he made the foul the way he made the dust another word man we okay was created from the original creation anybody care anybody okay because god originally was creating everything from there so he created the fire he created man he created the creeping thing everything from the dust so when he took this man and put him into the body everybody here we found that god breathed and when he breathed loud man became a living souls what does he mean brother stephen brother branham says this in the message brad's famous name he said but what god did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen can you say amen that's not me you're saying a man to the word then he become a water a soul that water amen okay everybody okay that's why jesus christ is the second and the last adam [Music] everybody here because in river jordan they have to put the pillar of high in jesus christ [Applause] we okay then the pillar of fire never enter the baby jesus everybody here the people of fire never enter a teenager jesus we okay the pedal of fire entered jesus when he was 30 when he was a grown-up man adam was not a baby adam was created a grown-up man everybody okay when they created him a grown-up man god briefed the breath of eternal life when jesus christ became a grown-up man god brought the pillar of fire jesus is the second and the last atom [Music] you catch it my friend we are going to get into honey my friend plum to your elbows notice brief the breath of eternal life into his water and became air [Music] amen everybody okay eternal soul because god breathed not what nature done by what god did breathed the breath of life into his nostril and he became a water so we found out that in every in this entire planet here in genesis everybody okay the only person that had their soul was adam everybody okay animals don't have souls we already dealt with that one if you miss it you need to go back to the old sermon everybody okay now the soul that first saw that was made available in the flesh was the soul of adam are we okay as soon as that soul was made available in the flesh we okay a creature naturally with a soul god came and locked that soul are you following me are you following me adam never lived a normal soul do you follow me as soon as adam was created in human flesh god sealed his soul in other words god blocked his soul so that no one can use him again [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when adam was here everything is lucky in nature [Music] can i continue brother branham says this what is the purpose so yeah the bible says this he said what is man what is a man profited if he shall gain the water and lose his honor what shall a man give in exchange to water so the soul is very precious your soul is very precious [Music] the soul that you are exposing to pornography is very precious [Music] the soul that you are giving to the devil is very precious there is nothing in this world that you can compare with your soul brother branham said a soul once a thousand world [Music] you put your job before your soul [Music] you put your passion on your body before your soul you put your pride before your soul you put your own desire before your soul you put your own preferences before your soul what can you exchange to the press of your soul amen god saw that the soul was so precious as soon as he was created god locked it i'm in different avenue my friend everybody here ever here why did god steal adam quickly [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay then when god begin to look he found out that adam is not complete we okay we're okay so we expect god to use the dust everybody okay off the earth just like he did the creature in the water just like he did the fall of the air just like he did the cuddle and the creeping things just like he did man the male one we expected god to create another mold and then pick up the woman and do the same thing [Music] everybody okay god never done it we okay now god went and opened adam we okay and took a dirt that was already changed and finished because adam didn't need any more work he was completed and finished there was nothing to change in adam anymore there was nothing that god could come and say maybe this reaper made it wrong i need to change the reap uniform no when adam was made he was finished everybody but god opened adam and pulled a finished product everybody here everybody here and created a woman okay now and god took that finished product and take the woman can i raise this oh man it's getting so yummy oh god it's a different language my friend it will make you grow grow grow grow until you want to go to heaven until you don't love the world anymore everybody here god took the rib everybody okay and from the rib he formed the body of eve everybody okay and took the spirit and the soul of eve everybody okay and put it in the body now if become body spirit and water amen and the bible never said that god breathed on eve [Music] are we okay are we okay are we okay so if you look at the we okay if you look at the well and the fishes they are made out of dust we are not lowering women we are just preaching the bible and we must receive the bible the way he was written [Music] everybody here if you don't want to preach this in your church so you can keep a full church of women giving you that that's your problem i am not going to do that [Music] everybody okay so far so when you look at this it's original from the ground this is original from the ground this category original from the ground man original from the ground amen a woman not original they took the original they work with it they already perverted the original we okay to make a finished product now they're taking a finished product to make the woman ever care so the strength of the woman decreases amen are we okay are we okay this is the first product this is the first product this is the first product this is the first product but this one they took the first product and they made the second product out of the first they took the material that was already cooked and they cook it out again it weakens the material amen [Music] everybody okay so this is coming from a rib amen so the material become a little weaker relax everybody okay we okay now according to what we found out we found out that in the best category here there was a creature this creature was the serpent amen he was more sadder than any other creature he came right after man what if was higher to the serpent was only the soul are we okay [Music] lord help me brother branham say the next one to a human being was the serpent the bible said he was the most saddle of all the beasts of the earth the field i'm going to repeat this again sometime i repeat and it's like a new quote he said he had almost the water he had a place for soul but what he did do he saw that to him to deceive god amen satan comer the serpent almost had the water so the serpent did not have a soul everybody okay that's why he was placed in the category of the beast but this serpent could talk we okay now from the soul perspective you follow me if was superior to the serpent are we okay are we okay but from the body perspective following me you following me the serpent was more stronger than eve [Music] we okay the serpent was strong in the body if was strong in the soul so it have to guard her soul in order to control the snake notice in order to control the serpent she needs to increase her strength in the soul [Music] everybody okay the bible say men shall not live by water [Music] man shall not live by water but by every water bread goes to the body but by every water [Music] the word goes to water here so when god gave the commandment to eve everybody okay the power of eve everybody okay wants to stay closer to the world [Music] are you okay as long as she keep the word the devil cannot do anything as long as the church stay closer to the word of god the gate of hell cannot do anything to that church everybody okay everybody okay but if she if she depart from the world and she dropped into the water the devil got here because remember on sunday the wisdom of the devil was devilish he was earthly and he was sensual he was bodily amen amen the last of the flesh the last of their eyes and the pride of life everybody okay the last of the flesh comes right here in the body the last of the eyes come right here in the body and your pride is in your spirit everybody okay so when the devil can pull you from here down and down here you already knocked down everybody okay everybody okay why do women love flattery huh you the most beautiful woman i've never seen in my life guess what guess what guess what she is already 50 down [Music] i love that sister because that sister always gave her praises [Music] are we okay where are the young people tonight [Music] jesus christ amen whoever miss that's between you and god amen unless you have a legitimate reason everybody okay everybody okay so when they only boost your ego ever here that man that is so sweet at work that boy that doesn't believe the message that seems to be a good boy he's already playing with your ego that sneaker that was born in the message that doesn't have the holy ghost yet his parents are message believer but he's a sleeker he plays with this one right here what he is looking for is your body [Music] everybody here everybody here so don't look at slicker outside of the message only they are infiltrated [Music] everybody okay it's a shame to see young boys you look at them in the message and you look at the young boy outside the message they look alike they have the same kind of haircut they have the same short pants like this the paints are right here how can you wear a salt i mean a suit with a paint short like this it doesn't even look good [Applause] why because it's a fashion every boys in the whole world are doing it guess what we're doing the same thing what are you copying what are you copying if somebody take a shirt and do something like this all the boys begin to do it we don't want to see your hair but fine go home go cut trees go show your strength to the trees go work in the garden cut some grass for your parents sweat at home get the trashes out acting at home don't want to do no work sitting watching tv and eating [Music] this is me i'm not playing games with the devil oh no he's so rude okay go to the one who's so sweet he's going to sink you to hell and before you die you will turn around and you say that deceiver because he was giving you what you want i am not giving you what you want i am giving you what the world wants you to have [Music] boys you got a hot potato work hard and get off your parents house quickly go buy your own house go buy your condominium move out start paying bills [Music] then you will understand life but here you will understand life want to pay bills you don't want to pay bills but you want to show up that you've grown up [Music] a man posting stuff all the time posting posting women are posting men are posting confusion let me go back to where i was everybody okay so through the body the serpent is higher because the serpent came from the dust original through the soil eve is higher we okay now now the soul of adam is sealed but the soul of evil was not sealed but the devil had the desire what was the desire of the devil [Music] brother branham says this satan has known this all along he also want to indwell man even as god so does but god has reserved to himself that satan cannot do that god alone appear in water satan could not and cannot do that he cannot have water amen god created adam and he breathed the breath of life into adam the serpent wanted to create also somebody and he also can enter that person but he doesn't have creative power but he longs he's looking for souls souls that are in prison now he's looking for souls but the serpent doesn't have soul we okay now the only available souls was the soul of who we good [Music] we're good we're good the only way for satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter water in eden even as he entered by evil spirit in the swan and gatherer gadara god does not enter what but satan can and will to water accomplish water we okay can i move on so now in the garden of eden we found out that satan is longing for two people amen set and found out we went through this that there is a creature called the serpent and this creature can talk and do everything right just like men amen the only problem no soul so they put him in the category of the animal but even though he's an animal but he's so strong in his intellect amen his intelligence is so high everybody okay then the devil is longing to enter man but serpent is a beast a beast with our soul ever here and the only available soul remaining is the soul of a woman amen that soul was not sealed everybody okay so in order to gain a soul [Music] we okay the damn for brother branham say when he have something to accomplish even if he takes him to enter animal he will enter an animal just because he want to do something and the animal he chose was the serpent we okay now when he enter the serpent the serpent becomes the devil incarnated but the animal is not really the satisfaction of the devil the devil could enter the beast and come back out but he doesn't have control in the children of god he doesn't have access in the children of god the devil longer so to have a soul everybody okay everybody okay so he uses the serpent now everybody care as an agent everybody okay everybody okay because he cannot create and he found out that this serpent matches him correctly amen if he can get the seed of the serpent [Music] the seed of the wicked one remember on sunday remember on saturday if he can get that seed and put it on a woman we okay because a woman is an bedo whatever the man gives she give an output the one who determined the baby is the man you give a woman she gave you a girl you give a man she gave you a ball whatever you put she gave it out everybody okay so satan was shadow the serpent understood all those laws subtility you remember so satan said i'm gonna use this peace here because i'm not able to create [Music] everybody here that god operates by law and there is a law called the law of reproduction everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay and god say let every beast reproduce after its on what elephant remain elephant zebra remains zebra that's why hybridization is of the endeavor [Music] you start mixing stuff the devil everybody okay so the devil wanted to create to be like the most high oh god but he doesn't have the power to create he uses the intellect to begin to manufacture which is a perversion of creation laboratory is a perversion of creation mixing up genes is a perversion of creation pulling up new strand of diseases is a pervasion of creation [Music] ever here so the devil wanted to create a species for himself but that species was not in the original creation everybody okay because the bible says cain was off the water so when he put the seed into the woman the woman produced cain everybody clear kim was a mixture of animals and human but with her soul [Music] up in genesis 4 everything i tried to preach i don't i can't my goodness time is already gone i don't know how i can get to the beast of babylon let's go to verse four lord help me please you there i say i'm gonna preach this boom and finish and let them go everybody here verse uh six and the lord said to ken why are you angry and why is your countenance fallen if you do well shall you not be accepted if you do not do well if you do not well seen everybody okay lies at the water stop which door do you think it was a door like this the door of who the door of cain which door does can everybody okay the sin lie at the door and to you shall his desire and you shall rule over sin become him sin now is him everybody okay so we found out now that can have a soul everybody okay cain have a soul everybody okay now what did god do when this is produced brother branham says this that for back in the eden the serpent was an upright creature he was close to man he was almost water you tired satan took advantage of the serpent water physical characteristic to use him to begin then god did water the pattern of the water no other beast can commingle with water what i want you to keep is god destroy the pattern of the water when god saw this he says now satan have him a mechanism he has a manufacture of human being not by creation by sex ever here you see why jesus was not born by sex you understand now but we will get to that later everybody okay so god say i need to destroy the manufacturer but i created the serpent i'm not going to lose that species completely everybody okay god destroy the serpent and change every aspect of the serpent are we there and made the serpent a snake this version loved the serpent [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay let's go back again to the beginning we have adam we have the serpent we have eve adam was locked by the breath of life the serpent which was the manufacturer of the devil god cursed him and made it a snake and in a snake it's locked you cannot have a snack impregnating a woman anymore it doesn't happen anymore so satan can enter the snake only to bite and kill somebody but not to manufacture a baby [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay god cursed the snake but god never cursed the woman let's go slowly adam looked the snake locked we have another creature that came in his name is cain the woman has a soul can has a soul amen when god came god never curse adam god curse the ground adam spared but still locked the certain curse locked everybody here if never was cursed they put their pen in her conception but if never changed from a woman to maybe a beast she remained evil because she came from god everybody okay when can sin god curse cain but he never changed the amount of me of cain that's amen job two verse uh jump or not we are in genesis four jump to verse eleven and now talking to cain are you cursed from the earth which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood there is a discernment between god and cain but i'm skipping that time is already gone amen and you will see the difference in the predestination seed and the other one do you want to know it go back to verse six and the lord said to ken why are you angry if you notice and why are that continents falling everybody okay they warn him job two verse nine uh eight in verse seven god told him that if you do well you'll be accepted anybody okay verse eight cain is following the advice of god because ebola was accepted so if you want to be accepted god say go talk to the one that is up there because ever the bible says offer his sacrifice by faith [Music] abba had the revelation of the word brother abel he had the revelation everybody okay can didn't have the revelation everybody okay we look at verse eight and can did water talk with who so somehow can want to evil and say what did you do to be accepted by god everybody okay everybody okay we okay so evil begin to unfold the seals [Music] and the thunders [Music] everybody okay abra begin to tell him you know that god sent a prophet in this age with a message he preached the seal he do that and the message of april he was preaching thinking that king would love it can't get upset [Music] spirit don't die my friend he got upset because of the revelation [Music] when you're getting upset because of the revelation of the hour you are anointed by the devil [Music] and you need to stay away from that man [Music] can i continue can i continue job to verse eight and it came to pass when they were in the field and ken rose up against abel his brother did what first murderer humanly speaking and the lord said to cain god is coming god already knew what happened okay god came by mercy and gave him a chance so he can judge him correctly but he knew he was a son of the devil but still god is just he must give you a chance enough rob to bed to hang you i know he's not going to receive but i'm going to give it to him i know this is esau i'm going to give him the birthright but he's going to despise it everybody okay so when he comes i would tell him that i gave you mercy i told you what to do you didn't want to do it now i'm righteous to judge you everybody okay now god comes now on the second pool you ready you ready let's jump to verse 9 and the lord god said to ken where is elbow your brother do you think god didn't know where ever was because when ken lied god told him he said the blood of your brother is crying but god never told him straight ahead what was there first everybody here god ask him a question give him him an opportunity to open up himself so that he can get help [Music] everybody okay jesus taught the pharisee it is the sick people that are looking for a doctor never go to the pastor if you have a problem and you start hiding things [Music] when they ask you a question open up the question [Music] everybody okay watch where is your brother and he said i know not a lie a mama brother what it is a son of a wrong seed everybody because the woman are the world we okay when jesus approached her everybody here jesus loaded the second pool we okay and told the woman go get your husband jesus knew and the woman said the truth i have what jesus said that's a predestinated seed because you say you don't have none now let me tell you your life you had five of them the six that you have everybody okay it's not yours everybody okay because she was willing to open up everybody okay everybody okay but ken don't wanna open up because there is nothing intend to be quicken everybody okay and he said what have you done now he brings judgment because the second because the second pool when he open up it's preparing the seed to receive life if you play around it disqualifies you that's it you blaspheme against it no mercy ever here hallelujah and he said what are you what have you done the voice of your brothers cry to me from the water god knew and now are you cursed from the earth which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's water from your water can was curse everybody okay everybody okay now jump to verse 17. job to verse 16. if you're there you can say amen and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelling the land of nod on the east of water and ken knew his water the curse of cain was the curse a different curse about his grand his profession but not him everybody okay go back to verse 12 when you tilt the ground you shall not he thereafter yield to you its strength a fugitive and a vagabond and wonder shall you be in the water everybody okay god never curse his anatomy that's why he picked up a wife and now he can reproduce children without the need of evil everybody okay everybody okay so now cain cursed but not locked amen the woman punished but not locked amen now the devil have two agents remaining that he can work with he lost the serpent about here but he still has the woman and cain to work with [Music] everybody okay ken was not a sinner everybody okay ken was a worshipper are we okay ken got his offering he built an altar and brother branham saying altar in the scripture is a church and he also brought his offering to god ever here but his offering was a fruit of his intellectual like his father the serpent [Music] but here but not a fruit of revelation it's a church without revelation it is a church it is a church can is a person is a person that is religious amen who works more with his intellect without revelation everybody here ever care and when he sees the other seed he has a tendency to kill it [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and eve is a woman which is a church everybody okay so we move from the beast as an animal as the agent of the devil into a woman a church and a religious person did you get it did you really get it did you really get it we moved from the beast in the beginning everybody okay to a religious person came and to a woman [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so we move from the serpentine animal in the beginning now the devil is still working with the woman and with a religious person a religious leader but that religious leader in his characteristic he's both animal and humanistic my time is gone i need to call this a different subject [Music] everybody okay my time is gone amen the bible says in first peter likewise he has been dwell with them women according to water giving honor and to the word as unto a what why we careful sir everybody okay everybody okay so from there from eden all the way to today the devil operates with these two [Music] everybody okay i'm gonna say this and i'm gonna stop because i can go further amen the bible says a weaker vessel you mean weaker a vessel is a human the bible says in the book of fact that by the lord say unto him go that way for he is a what that was paul a human being is a vessel every one of you should know how to possess his water so the body of eve is the weaker because it was not from the dust everybody okay if a man therefore purge himself from this he shall be a water so a vessel is a human being but the vessel of a woman is weaker because she never came straight from the dust she came from the river everybody okay that's why remember the woman the woman that brought the fruit to cain was not what say it again the woman was not locked and the woman that brought the fruit to adam was a memorial woman he was an immoral ever let me finish with this the bible says in exodus 34 when israel was leaving egypt god said that shall worship noradaga for the lord whose name is jealous is a water lest them make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land and they go a warring after their god and do sacrifice unto their gods and one called thee and eat of his water i don't want you to make friendship with the people of the world because they're gonna invite you to their party and before you know it you're going to find yourself in their party doing things that are contrary to your christian life that's what it means in plain word today everybody okay that's why brother branham said you must have friends that believe like you amen everybody okay and that shall take dad and da take off their daughter unto that son and their daughters everybody okay go a whirring after the water and make the sun go a whirring after the water god say don't take those women anybody okay and give the women to your children because the women in the beginning an immoral woman is the one who brought the voice to adam everybody okay if you take your sons and they begin to marry worldly women the worldly women will take your son away from me [Music] everybody okay what i'm saying here these agents are still valid the devil work with a religious person and he works with an immoral woman it's still valid everybody okay the bible says this in deuteronomy neither shall they make marriage with them that god shall not shall not give unto his son nor his daughter shall that take unto thy son for they will turn away your son not daughters god is pointing the man because the man is the carrier of the seed i'm afraid of human amen because the daughter would turn away that sun from water it was if that brought the fruit to adam the devil understood that i can still use a woman as an agent that they may serve at the water so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you and destroyed thee how don't take worldly women put them in israel they would take israel away from god anybody okay the children of israel dwell among the canaanites the high that and the amore and amuran and perez that and have i ten jebusat and they took the to beat the water and gave their daughters to the water and serve water automatically the devil uses it everybody okay the bible says that king solomon love how many [Music] many water not israelite woman not the eve when she was pure but the eve that was defiled many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of moabite ammonite of the nation concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel you shall not go into water neither shall they come into you for surely guarantee that therefore did it at the beginning he brought the fruit to adam guarantee works hey but here they will turn away your heart after the water so if god if the devil want to take somebody under another god what does he uses why does he use his women to take men off the message watch when a woman is already off the message anybody okay solomon cleveland two days in love and he had 700 wives princess and 300 water and his wife turn away his water a man with a gift like solomon but regardless of the gift that weapon still work for the devil amen for he came to pass when solomon was old that his wife turned away his heart after other for solomon went after ashtaroth the goddess of the zadonian and after milkand the abomination of the ammonia then did solomon built the man who built the temple now he built a high place for kimos the abomination of moab in the hill that is before water he built the temple at jerusalem he's now building the false altar at jerusalem and for more like the abomination of the children of water the two weapons already working i got to stop here everybody okay so we keep this and i need to come back to babylon on sunday i thought i would go to something else on sunday what did you say today dust dust that's dust the soul of adam was locked the only available souls was a woman that's why the serpent and uh uh move into the woman and produces cain everybody okay now the serpent was destroyed but the woman is still available not a good woman and i'm going to show you i have a quote where brother brown i'm usually when you weed marriage and divorce you will hear brother branham say i'm not talking about you sisters do you follow me that's why if you understand that you won't get mad for marriage and divorce brother branham preach about women in marriage and divorce you make us feel bad you didn't understand what brother brandon was saying so now we're going to bring you a new message to put women in their places and they start wearing pants that's their places everybody okay anybody okay brother branham was talking about an immoral woman go listen to marriage and divorce and come and see me again you're gonna see that brother branham say i'm not talking about you sister i will show you your pace but i'm talking about the memorial woman i have the coat if i try to push i care but i can show you on sunday it's already loaded here amen an immoral woman and a religious person and remember the great she's an immoral woman still working till to the end and a religious person came so there will be a cane and the
