[41:54] quots or something I can give it you
[41:57] brother say when you get prayed for and
[41:59] when the symptom increase that's the
[42:02] best sign that you are
[42:05] he do you believe it or you want me to
[42:08] read
[42:10] it give me a minute
[42:17] please I got my small computer
[42:20] here I use it as my computer stay away
[42:24] from foolishness I'm I'm going to give
[42:26] you
[42:27] one it's in Jas a secret believer 1955
[42:32] if you need more you tell me I will load
[42:34] it in the morning as much as you want
[42:36] Amen brother Bram said the patient then
[42:39] this is in paragraph 21 in the middle he
[42:41] said the patient then that the evil has
[42:44] gone out of the patient the cancer is
[42:47] dead for a few days they feel fine like
[42:50] the Cataract tumor or whatever it may be
[42:54] they feel fine for a few days and and
[42:56] then the first thing you know it begin
[42:58] to swell swell and then if the patient
[43:03] is not truly
[43:06] instructed in another place if I'm not
[43:08] mistaken he say
[43:10] thought if the patient is not really
[43:13] instructed in the word of God they shall
[43:16] lose their healing as sure as anything
[43:19] because they get sick and get twice as
[43:23] bad as they ever was and and that is the
[43:27] best sign you have ever had that you are
[43:33] here so when you pray for a to fake and

[43:39] sign that the devil got a
[43:41] hit and that devil need to
[43:44] go amen amen glory to God Amen so keep

[48:44] God so happy to be in church with you
[48:47] tonight uh this is our second home and
[48:51] we always uh appreciate when we come
[48:53] back here somebody would say brother
[48:56] Aaron uh uh do you can you give me uh
[48:59] your pastor's number brother
[49:05] Steve said I wish he
[49:12] was so because he has a good report I
[49:14] don't correct
[49:16] them but if he had a bad report I would
[49:19] correct them quickly say no he's not my
[49:23] pastor you see s success is many fathers
[49:27] but failure is an orphan if you do well
[49:30] everyone wants to be associated with
[49:34] you if I do well even somebody that
[49:37] doesn't know me say I know brother that
[49:38] he's a good friend of
[49:40] mine so that that's what we say about
[49:43] brother
[49:45] Steven somebody said do you know brother
[49:47] Steven oh yeah he's a good very Co close
[49:49] friend of
[49:50] mine and indeed he
[49:53] is shall We Stand and read the the
[49:55] scripture
[49:58] tonight let's read from Psalms chapter
[50:01] 78 verse
[50:03] 40 Psalms I love the Psalms brother Bram
[50:06] would read a Psalm every
[50:09] service because he said the Bible says
[50:12] in hyms Psalms and spiritual songs in
[50:17] Ephesians I believe it
[50:19] is so he would
[50:22] um he would read a Psalm every Serv
[50:26] so let's uh go Psalm 78 verse
[50:29] 40 if you have it you can show by
[50:32] raising your
[50:35] hand if you are in the Old Testament you
[50:37] you are in the right
[50:44] direction how often did they provoke him
[50:47] in the
[50:48] wilderness and grieve him in the
[50:53] desert yeah they turn their back back
[50:56] and tempted God and limited the Holy One
[51:01] of Israel you may have your
[51:04] seat praise be to
[51:07] God
[51:09] Hallelujah the prophet says there's only
[51:13] one sin and that sin is
[51:17] unbelief everything else drinking and
[51:19] smoking is attributes of
[51:22] sin but unbelief is the only sin that
[51:27] the prophet says we can point that this
[51:30] is sin so everything else smoking
[51:33] drinking adultery those are attributes
[51:35] of sin and here the Bible says that they
[51:38] limited the Holy One of
[51:41] Israel praise be to God so tonight for a
[51:44] title we want to talk about rapturing
[51:47] faith overcomes all our
[51:50] limitations rapturing Faith overcomes
[51:54] all our limitations
[51:56] praise be to God just felt led to speak
[52:00] tonight on faith noticing that brother
[52:03] Steven was you know laboring preaching
[52:05] on faith so we decided to write on that
[52:08] solid
[52:09] foundation if you are a um if you are a
[52:13] pilot or if uh you are a sailor you have
[52:17] to understand how winds operate so they
[52:20] are headwinds those that blow towards
[52:23] your face you know towards your your
[52:25] face if you are sailing or if you're
[52:27] flying they slow you down so if if if
[52:30] you know a one hour Journey can be like
[52:32] one hour 30 minutes depending on how bad
[52:35] the tail winds are that's right and you
[52:36] use a lot of
[52:38] fuel that's I mean the head winds but
[52:40] they also Tailwinds those that blow in
[52:43] your direction yes and if you're a good
[52:46] pilot if you're a good sailor you have
[52:49] to learn how to ride in those Tailwinds
[52:52] and they make your journey easy and
[52:54] faster
[52:56] amen so when you find tail Wings you
[52:59] ride on them amen so so so brother
[53:03] Steven laid a very good foundation I
[53:06] said I'm going to ride on these
[53:12] Tailwinds amen we're going to be writing
[53:15] on these Tailwinds that's how the
[53:17] ministry Works Paul says I planted
[53:21] Apollo's water but God causes it to grow
[53:26] praise be to God it's not a onean job
[53:29] it's not a one congregation job it's for
[53:32] the entire body of Jesus
[53:36] Christ Hallelujah and the only one to be
[53:39] glorified at the end of the day is Jesus
[53:44] Christ when the true word is preached
[53:47] only Jesus Christ comes out of it amen
[53:51] glory to God yes sir and a real servant
[53:55] yes my brother knows who he is amen and
[53:58] he knows who he is not amen amen glory
[54:02] to God when they asked John art thou the
[54:05] Christ he says I am not he that's it but
[54:09] who are you I am the voice I'm the voice
[54:14] crying in the wilderness he knew who he
[54:17] was
[54:18] not and he knew who he was yes my
[54:21] brother praise be to God yes sir that's
[54:24] exactly you know when we approach the
[54:26] prophet we know who he is not but we
[54:29] know who he is amen amen it's not enough
[54:32] to know what the who he is not you have
[54:34] to know who he
[54:36] is hallelujah so the Bible says here
[54:39] that they grieved the Holy One and they
[54:43] limited him so the sin that God found
[54:47] with this church that's is that they
[54:50] limited him in other words God wanted to
[54:54] do do the mighty
[54:56] Works God wanted to manifest himself in
[55:00] their midst but they limited him by
[55:04] their
[55:05] unbelief they limited him by their
[55:09] understanding or maybe by their lack of
[55:12] understanding they limited him by their
[55:15] lack of Revelation so he could not fully
[55:19] display his power and because of that he
[55:23] was very with them and the Bible says
[55:28] they troubled him imagine troubling
[55:32] God hallelujah yes the Bible says here
[55:37] it says how of they provoked him in the
[55:40] wilderness and grieved him that's right
[55:42] verse 42 they remembered not his hand
[55:45] that's right nor the day when he
[55:46] delivered them from the enemy right how
[55:50] he had wrought his signs in Egypt and
[55:52] his wonders in the field of of Zan right
[55:56] amen one verse says that they they were
[55:58] asking can God lavish a table in the
[56:02] wilderness and God could read their
[56:05] thoughts that's right praise be to God
[56:09] so when we have Lake of faith we limit
[56:13] God in our
[56:15] life
[56:17] Hallelujah sometimes we limit God
[56:19] because of our background that's right
[56:21] sometimes we limit God because of our
[56:24] denomination our way of looking at
[56:27] things God does not want to be
[56:31] limited God in the beginning was El
[56:35] Elohim he was the self-existing
[56:38] one the word Lord is L in Hebrew which
[56:42] means
[56:43] Lord Yahweh you know but there's another
[56:46] Lord which is Master like when a wife
[56:48] would say my Lord to her husband she's
[56:50] saying Master she's not saying Yahweh
[56:53] she's saying master although in English
[56:55] is the same Lord but he wanted to reveal
[56:59] himself sir he had a desire in the big
[57:02] part of his mind he wanted to reveal
[57:05] himself but in order for him to reveal
[57:08] himself they had to be people for him to
[57:11] reveal himself too so he created things
[57:15] and he created people hallelujah
[57:19] although we know that we existed with
[57:21] him before the foundation of the world
[57:23] right but he desire to show his power he
[57:27] had a desire to show his healing he had
[57:29] a desire to show that he is a God of
[57:34] Peace but his biggest problem Through
[57:37] the Ages that's right is not finding the
[57:41] people to reveiew himself
[57:45] to he's not finding people to show his
[57:48] healing is not finding people to show
[57:53] that he is Jehovah
[57:58] CH pension companies they run programs
[58:03] what they call Unclaimed benefits they
[58:05] have a lot of money where people were
[58:07] working and contributing but they can't
[58:09] find beneficiaries so they have to go
[58:11] through the radios they have to put in
[58:13] in newspapers because they want people
[58:15] to receive their benefits and I believe
[58:18] that's what God has been doing
[58:19] throughout the ages who can I find so
[58:22] that I can display my power
[58:25] who can I find so that I can show my
[58:27] Works who can I find so that I can show
[58:31] myself that I am Jehovah
[58:34] [Applause]
[58:34] [Music]
[58:37] Gyra and each and every person that God
[58:40] worked with there was a level that he
[58:44] could reach
[58:45] to and that was the problem because God
[58:49] would work with Moses up until a certain
[58:52] point where Moses would just be become
[58:55] wroth and he throws away the tablets so
[58:58] God could not do much because he was
[59:00] limited in Moses that's right
[59:04] hallelujah praise be to God so there was
[59:07] a limit to every person that God ever
[59:11] worked
[59:12] with until God said I am going to make
[59:16] myself into
[59:18] flesh and then nobody can limit me I can
[59:23] do whatever I want
[59:25] [Music]
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:32] Hallelujah God Hebrews chapter 4:1 let
[59:35] us therefore fear lest a promise being
[59:38] left us of entering into his rest so God
[59:42] gives a promise and he wants to fulfill
[59:45] This Promise verse two it says For unto
[59:48] us was the Gospel preached as as well as
[59:51] unto them but the word preached did not
[59:55] profit them not being mixed with faith
[59:58] in them that heard
[1:00:00] it because they had no faith the word of
[1:00:04] God had no effect in their life and they
[1:00:07] were not able to enter into God's rest
[1:00:11] because they did not accept the word
[1:00:13] with
[1:00:14] faith they were hooked to their Egyptian
[1:00:18] Creeds and traditions they are hooked to
[1:00:22] their own denominational ideas of how
[1:00:25] God should do things that's why they
[1:00:27] would say to
[1:00:29] Moses there were carrots in Egypt there
[1:00:33] was gamore in
[1:00:35] Egypt there were French fries in Egypt
[1:00:39] they wanted things the Egyptian way but
[1:00:42] God but Moses wanted to do things God's
[1:00:45] own
[1:00:46] ways and let me tell you something this
[1:00:49] evening God is not satisfied by any
[1:00:52] other way that is not his
[1:00:55] way God only accept his ways God only
[1:01:00] accepts his choice God will never accept
[1:01:03] anything that is not his
[1:01:06] choice sir because if he does that then
[1:01:10] that means he is no longer
[1:01:12] Sovereign but for him to be God he has
[1:01:15] to be an infinite Sovereign and because
[1:01:18] he's Sovereign he makes his own choice
[1:01:21] without consulting nobody
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:26] hallelujah praise be to
[1:01:28] God some of us will think maybe if only
[1:01:31] God would would have done something this
[1:01:33] way maybe if only God would have chosen
[1:01:35] this
[1:01:36] way if only God could have chosen
[1:01:39] somebody who is not brother brandham
[1:01:41] guess what God does what he
[1:01:44] wants that's the first principle that
[1:01:46] you have to know about God God does what
[1:01:49] he
[1:01:50] [Applause]
[1:01:52] wants and he does not need means
[1:01:55] approval he is not a politician because
[1:01:59] he does not campaign for office he does
[1:02:02] not campaign for
[1:02:05] power he exists in his own
[1:02:09] power and he lives in his own
[1:02:12] Glory therefore he does not live by
[1:02:15] means approval or
[1:02:22] acceptance God is the truth
[1:02:25] God is right even if everyone else says
[1:02:29] that is wrong but he is right because he
[1:02:32] is God amen amen that's why he never
[1:02:35] changes amen because he is God if he
[1:02:38] changes then he ceases to be God that's
[1:02:41] why we do not change the gospel that we
[1:02:44] preach Hallelujah we preach the same
[1:02:47] things that Paul preached we preach the
[1:02:49] same things that brother Bram preached
[1:02:51] because God does not change
[1:02:57] God does not subtract he adds his light
[1:03:01] Moses said thou sht not commit
[1:03:04] adultery but Jesus Christ said if you
[1:03:06] look at a woman to last he was adding
[1:03:10] light so if you see someone leaving the
[1:03:13] message and they go to drinking it means
[1:03:16] that that wasn't the Holy Spirit leading
[1:03:18] them because God does not take light he
[1:03:22] adds light
[1:03:28] Genesis
[1:03:30] 18:3 and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:03:33] wherefore did Sarah
[1:03:35] laugh why did Sarah laugh you see that
[1:03:38] Spirit limiting the Holy One saying
[1:03:42] shall I of short bear a child which I am
[1:03:48] old and God says is anything too hard
[1:03:51] for the
[1:03:52] Lord at the time I appointed I will
[1:03:55] return unto thee according to the time
[1:03:58] of life and Sarah shall have a son amen
[1:04:02] praise be to God so it it it displeased
[1:04:05] God that Sarah doubted that God was able
[1:04:09] to do the supernatural in his
[1:04:12] life and God said why did Sarah laugh
[1:04:16] you know brother BR when he was on the
[1:04:17] discernment light line if somebody will
[1:04:20] begin to doubt he would feel it says I
[1:04:23] feel it
[1:04:24] I feel that doubt it would bump against
[1:04:28] him like that that's how God feels when
[1:04:31] we doubt his
[1:04:32] promises but tonight I want to show you
[1:04:34] by the grace of God that we are entering
[1:04:37] into the realm of rapturing faith and
[1:04:39] when we enter into the realm of
[1:04:41] rapturing Faith all things are possible
[1:04:44] when we enter in the realm of rapturing
[1:04:46] faith we are not bound by this camp or
[1:04:49] that camp or this camp we believe all
[1:04:52] things are possible
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:56] Hallelujah Hall the devil wants to limit
[1:04:59] the
[1:05:00] church they want to limit the church to
[1:05:02] speaking in tongues
[1:05:03] only they is speaking in tongues plus as
[1:05:06] much as the Lord of my God shall
[1:05:09] reveal Satan wants to limit God to just
[1:05:14] you know conduct or order that is fine
[1:05:17] but we don't stop there the devil
[1:05:20] throughout the ages he knows once I
[1:05:22] limit the faith that I have bound the
[1:05:25] Holy
[1:05:27] Spirit but before we can go in the
[1:05:30] rapture we must come to a place where we
[1:05:33] believe that God can do all
[1:05:38] things and when we say God can do all
[1:05:41] things it's not a statement out of
[1:05:44] vanity or you know the way the lud dians
[1:05:47] would would would say it say all things
[1:05:48] are possible therefore I'm going to
[1:05:50] speak 800 rolls-royces no it's govern by
[1:05:54] the character of
[1:05:57] God because faith is a revelation of the
[1:06:01] will of God so you will never ask
[1:06:04] something that is contrary to the will
[1:06:06] of
[1:06:07] God praise be to
[1:06:11] God so rapturing Faith takes away the
[1:06:16] limits because remember when Adam fell
[1:06:19] we were subject to limits that's right
[1:06:22] we were subject to gravitation our limit
[1:06:24] that's exactly right amen we were
[1:06:27] subject to a lot of things and the Bible
[1:06:29] says that the earnest creature is
[1:06:31] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:06:33] sons of God so the restoration of the
[1:06:37] kingdom it begins with taking away the
[1:06:40] limits so that we can have the abstract
[1:06:43] title deed of the book of
[1:06:47] redemption do you see this church so it
[1:06:50] starts in the realm of the
[1:06:53] spirit
[1:06:54] where we believe that we have Liberty
[1:06:57] through Jesus
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:02] Christ Matthew chapter uh 13 verse uh 58
[1:07:07] yes sir the Bible says and he did not he
[1:07:09] did not many mighty works there because
[1:07:12] of their
[1:07:13] unbelief in other words when God when
[1:07:15] Jesus went to capam in a place that he
[1:07:17] grew up he wanted to do many many mighty
[1:07:21] works because he was God he loves to
[1:07:25] display his
[1:07:26] power but here the Bible saying that he
[1:07:29] was limited because of the people's
[1:07:31] unbelief that's
[1:07:34] right am that's why he said who unto you
[1:07:37] CH who unto you capam if the mighty
[1:07:40] works that were done in you were done in
[1:07:43] Sodom it could have been standing this
[1:07:46] day
[1:07:48] amen Luke 18:8 the Bible says I tell you
[1:07:51] that he will avenge them speedily
[1:07:53] nevertheless
[1:07:54] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:07:58] a
[1:07:59] denomination shall he find a
[1:08:02] camp shall we find a group of people
[1:08:05] just in a
[1:08:06] uniform shall we find faith upon the
[1:08:11] Earth so what Jesus is looking for is
[1:08:15] Faith and if you look at it Jesus never
[1:08:18] healed anyone he says your faith has
[1:08:22] healed you
[1:08:24] your faith has healed you your faith is
[1:08:27] what heals
[1:08:30] you so Jesus cannot operate outside of
[1:08:34] what your the faith that you
[1:08:37] have but the problem that we have is
[1:08:40] that in this generation we have
[1:08:42] everything except
[1:08:45] Faith that's why that's why people want
[1:08:48] to associate in groups because they
[1:08:50] don't have
[1:08:52] faith or if I if I I live in
[1:08:54] Jeffersonville I think I will make it if
[1:08:57] you have faith you don't need to go to
[1:08:59] Jeffersonville if you have faith you
[1:09:01] believe wherever you are that Jesus
[1:09:04] Christ you are the same
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:09] God
[1:09:11] hallelujah someone says you know what if
[1:09:14] I if I can listen if something is
[1:09:16] revealed to you I understand like
[1:09:18] something was revealed to the woman if I
[1:09:20] can touch His Garment that was a
[1:09:22] revelation for that time
[1:09:25] but not everyone needs to do that I
[1:09:27] don't need to go to Jerusalem to see an
[1:09:30] empty tomb to believe that Jesus Christ
[1:09:33] raised from the
[1:09:38] dead if I do that that shows I don't
[1:09:40] have faith that's exactly right that's
[1:09:43] why people have a camp that's right
[1:09:45] because they want something physical
[1:09:47] that they can hold on to preach my
[1:09:50] brother preach I have this gun that I
[1:09:53] got that brother used to hunt with those
[1:09:55] things are fine but that is not where
[1:09:58] your your faith should be based on amen
[1:10:01] amen faith is a revelation amen of what
[1:10:06] God is amen and what God is doing faith
[1:10:09] is a revelation amen amen amen glory
[1:10:14] someone says brother I have got faith
[1:10:16] says if you have faith then you don't
[1:10:18] need to be in the prayer line in the
[1:10:20] first place because if you have faith
[1:10:22] you believe wherever you are that God
[1:10:25] can heal
[1:10:28] you yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir
[1:10:31] when the son of men comes will he find
[1:10:34] faith upon the Earth glory to God that's
[1:10:37] why people spend their money to God
[1:10:39] places right if only I can see this man
[1:10:41] of God I believe he can help
[1:10:44] me Jesus Christ already paid for
[1:10:47] everything on Calvary amen amen the only
[1:10:50] thing that you need to do is to accept
[1:10:52] what he did for you amen on Calvary amen
[1:10:55] praise be to God Amen but that simple
[1:10:58] Faith the devil is taking it away from
[1:11:00] us that's exactly right the prophet says
[1:11:03] in God keeps his word Along come this
[1:11:05] new issue the Oneness right they started
[1:11:08] baptizing in Jesus name that was all
[1:11:10] right that's in the Bible but what
[1:11:13] happened you made an issue out of it and
[1:11:16] where are you tonight on the sidelines
[1:11:18] too because you didn't hold the torch
[1:11:20] light you organized and put a period
[1:11:24] after that and that settled it brother
[1:11:28] talks a lot about Oneness that's right
[1:11:31] when God review something yes sir
[1:11:33] instead of people to put a comma and say
[1:11:36] God will review much more that's the
[1:11:38] problem they built a denomination around
[1:11:41] that that's right and when they built a
[1:11:43] denomination around that that's it they
[1:11:45] organized and when they organized they
[1:11:47] put a limit they put a period right
[1:11:51] because a period is a full stop they put
[1:11:54] a period to say God this is what God has
[1:11:57] done full stop and when they do that the
[1:12:01] prophet says show me any any group that
[1:12:03] ever organized and came back again no
[1:12:07] says when you organize you die right
[1:12:08] there that's it why because you you put
[1:12:12] a limit on God that's it and you go back
[1:12:15] to Psalm chapter 78 they limited the
[1:12:18] Holy One of Israel that's
[1:12:21] right amen praise be to God amen so the
[1:12:24] moment you put a Creed you have limited
[1:12:27] God that's it Jesus could have the Holy
[1:12:31] Spirit without measure because he was
[1:12:34] the word without measure amen amen amen
[1:12:39] hallelujah amen Jesus Christ believed
[1:12:42] without measure because he had the faith
[1:12:44] without measure because he was the word
[1:12:47] without measure amen amen amen amen
[1:12:52] that's why the church is in a very poor
[1:12:54] condition that's exactly because we have
[1:12:56] joined ourselves with camps that's it
[1:12:58] with Creeds that's it and dogmas that's
[1:13:01] it and you know opinions right when we
[1:13:04] are supposed to believe the whole word
[1:13:06] of God amen amen yes my brother yes sir
[1:13:12] preach I'm going to go very slow tonight
[1:13:14] go ahead my 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17
[1:13:18] Hallelujah now the spirit now the Lord
[1:13:20] is that Spirit right and way the spirit
[1:13:22] of the Lord is is there is Liberty Amen
[1:13:25] in other words where God's spirit is
[1:13:26] there is no limit amen amen am amen
[1:13:31] there is no limit to say we only believe
[1:13:35] this no where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:13:39] there is Liberty if somebody wants to
[1:13:41] stand up and shout they can stand up and
[1:13:43] shout if someone wants to say Amen they
[1:13:46] can say Amen you you are free in the
[1:13:49] house of God amen amen amen if an
[1:13:53] evangelist comes you say Amen right if a
[1:13:56] teacher comes you say amen amen if a
[1:13:58] preacher comes you say amen amen because
[1:14:01] the spirit of the Lord brings Liberty
[1:14:04] that's exactly right but the reason why
[1:14:07] people die uhhuh is because they say all
[1:14:10] I want is
[1:14:11] evangelism God has to speak to me this
[1:14:14] way only when you do that you will never
[1:14:17] go anywhere with God that's right
[1:14:18] because you are putting a limit to what
[1:14:20] God can do amen maybe God can speak
[1:14:22] through a teing that's right Hallelujah
[1:14:26] right we should never put a full stop to
[1:14:29] what God can do whatever gifts he gives
[1:14:32] us we say Amen to that Amen to that Amen
[1:14:35] to that amen
[1:14:37] amen all of us amen we are going into
[1:14:40] rapturing Faith yes my brother and
[1:14:42] rapturing Faith goes above denominations
[1:14:46] it goes above men's ideas right because
[1:14:48] the prophet says rapturing faith is in
[1:14:50] them books and the tapes amen capturing
[1:14:53] faith is the faith of God amen amen
[1:14:58] Revelations 4 One the prophet says and
[1:15:01] that's the same thing every denomination
[1:15:04] and the Pentecostal denomination is God
[1:15:06] today right they see those denominations
[1:15:09] die just as quickly as they denominate
[1:15:12] right now as an individual you can
[1:15:14] denominate yourself that's exactly right
[1:15:17] when you say you know what I'm not going
[1:15:18] to listen to this that's it you can sit
[1:15:21] in church and halfway through the sermon
[1:15:23] you say if the pastor starts talking
[1:15:25] about this I'm not going to listen to
[1:15:27] that you denominate yourself there
[1:15:29] that's it and then you limit the measure
[1:15:31] of your Holy Spirit in your life because
[1:15:33] you have denominated yourself there
[1:15:36] that's it but if you come to church with
[1:15:38] an open attitude amen and say Lord
[1:15:41] whatever you say I will say Amen
[1:15:43] whatever you review I say Amen whatever
[1:15:46] you say I'll say amen amen amen amen but
[1:15:50] the devil works over time that's right
[1:15:53] say once once once he talks about that
[1:15:55] I'm not going to listen to
[1:15:57] that I'll just take this I won't listen
[1:16:00] to that and you denominate yourself
[1:16:03] right there and that's where exactly you
[1:16:06] dash and you go into prayer and say Lord
[1:16:08] I'm looking for a breakthrough you never
[1:16:10] get a breakthrough until you find where
[1:16:12] you left
[1:16:14] Jesus remember it was it was Mary who
[1:16:17] denied the supernatural birth at the
[1:16:20] Feast of
[1:16:21] Pentecost when they were the Feast of
[1:16:24] Pentecost she said to Jesus Christ your
[1:16:27] father and as were looking for shoe amen
[1:16:31] and the prophet says that's when she
[1:16:33] denied the supernatural birth amen and
[1:16:37] the prophet says the church they left
[1:16:40] him at the Feast of
[1:16:42] Pentecost because Mary is not the Royal
[1:16:45] seed she is the shark that holds the
[1:16:48] seed and Pentecost was not the seed
[1:16:53] Pentecost was the shark that was hacking
[1:16:56] the seat amen but the seat is the red
[1:16:59] word of the
[1:17:02] hour yes my brother yes my brother
[1:17:05] because the shark is to pull away that's
[1:17:08] right the shark will dry out and pull
[1:17:10] away that's right but the seed is is
[1:17:13] harvested into the Garner yes my brother
[1:17:15] because remember when Eve was created by
[1:17:20] God she was called Adam right because
[1:17:23] she was a part of Adam that's right but
[1:17:25] after the fall she became Eve right
[1:17:29] which means a mother of what all living
[1:17:31] amen that was a Blasphemous name she was
[1:17:34] supposed to be called Adam that's right
[1:17:37] but because of the Fall she received a
[1:17:38] Blasphemous name that's ex and the
[1:17:40] church she was the church was called
[1:17:43] Jesus amen and they were baptized in the
[1:17:45] name of Jesus Amen but at n year R
[1:17:49] that's right she received the
[1:17:50] Blasphemous
[1:17:52] name
[1:17:53] Hallelujah pre they were
[1:17:57] called I I wish we were not on live
[1:18:00] stream the prophet calls them
[1:18:02] lodes Hallelujah yes sir denominational
[1:18:05] names that was not the name of the
[1:18:08] church that's right the name of the
[1:18:09] church is
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] Jesus the only has one Church brother
[1:18:18] and that church is a mystical body
[1:18:21] that's right
[1:18:23] glory to God if you see a church that
[1:18:26] was founded by a man it's not the Church
[1:18:29] of Jesus Christ that's it how can you
[1:18:32] find how can you found something that
[1:18:34] you are born
[1:18:36] inh how can you found your dear how can
[1:18:39] you found your your family how can you
[1:18:42] say I I I'm the found of my family when
[1:18:44] you were born in that
[1:18:50] family I mean Common Sense will tell you
[1:18:52] that
[1:18:53] you cannot found your family because you
[1:18:55] were born in that family if you were
[1:18:57] born in that family it means that you
[1:18:59] are not the first one you were born of
[1:19:02] your father so if you are born in the
[1:19:04] church if you are born in the word you
[1:19:06] cannot say I'm the founder of that
[1:19:07] church how can you found it if you were
[1:19:10] born in that church that's a Blasphemous
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:16] name glory to God hallelujah yes so the
[1:19:20] Church of God is called Mrs Jesus amen
[1:19:23] amen amen yes
[1:19:26] sir now Christ is the head is the head
[1:19:29] of this yes sir Christ is the head of
[1:19:31] this Messianic Kingdom uhhuh now the
[1:19:34] word kingdom is two words right it's
[1:19:37] king and
[1:19:39] domain
[1:19:41] kingom so we are born into a kingdom
[1:19:45] it's not a democracy sir it's a
[1:19:48] kingdom that's why we don't have power
[1:19:51] to change what was written that's why we
[1:19:54] don't have power to change the dress
[1:19:56] code that's why because it's a kingdom
[1:20:00] it's not a
[1:20:03] democracy
[1:20:05] preach preach because there's a king and
[1:20:09] he is his domain am and all of us are
[1:20:12] servants in this Kingdom that's right
[1:20:15] let me read what brother BR says glory
[1:20:17] to God and you cannot organize a kingdom
[1:20:19] of which Christ is the head amen you
[1:20:22] cannot denominate a kingdom amen which
[1:20:25] is which Christ is the head because
[1:20:27] Christ is King amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:20:33] amen Christ is King Amen brother Braham
[1:20:36] says many people want Jesus to be their
[1:20:38] savior that's right but not many people
[1:20:41] want the want him to be their lord right
[1:20:45] but Christ wants to be the Lord in your
[1:20:47] life amen because he is a king amen
[1:20:50] because a king has to have a domain amen
[1:20:55] amen amen and the difference between a a
[1:20:58] kingdom and a democracy is in a
[1:21:00] democracy it's people who decide that's
[1:21:03] exactly right people who elect
[1:21:05] representatives uhuh but in a
[1:21:08] kingdom the instructions they come from
[1:21:11] the King yes sir and because they come
[1:21:13] from a king they are not negotiable no
[1:21:16] sir because it's a kingdom amen amen So
[1:21:20] when you say oh we are sitting down as a
[1:21:23] church we've decided now Brothers can
[1:21:25] wear shorts that is not a kingdom no no
[1:21:30] that is your own decision that's right
[1:21:32] because a kingdom the word comes from
[1:21:35] the King amen amen amen but one thing I
[1:21:39] I like about this kingdom is yes sir yes
[1:21:41] sir we are not
[1:21:44] servants we are sons in the Kingdom of
[1:21:48] Goden we are also Kings and reigning
[1:21:51] with him and he is the king of kings
[1:21:54] he's the Lord of lords amen but we are
[1:21:56] also Kings with him amen amen amen amen
[1:22:01] glory to God I was in the Middle East
[1:22:03] one time yes sir so they have what they
[1:22:06] call
[1:22:07] emirati so there's a king over Dubai
[1:22:11] there's a king over rasal K there's a
[1:22:13] king over Abu Dhabi so each one has a a
[1:22:16] domain but there's a king of United Arab
[1:22:20] Emirates so that's how the kingdom of
[1:22:22] God is God will give you your domain you
[1:22:25] are a king of this domain you a king of
[1:22:27] that but he is over over all the King of
[1:22:30] Kings amen amen amen amen amen yes sir
[1:22:35] so because we are in a kingdom we cannot
[1:22:37] denominate a kingdom no sir because the
[1:22:41] king wants to have unlimited preeminence
[1:22:44] yes my brother now the the word
[1:22:47] preeminence means God wants to have
[1:22:50] total control and total Liberty amen
[1:22:54] amen hallelujah amen because for him to
[1:22:57] be a king he has to have preeminence yes
[1:22:59] my brother yes my brother yes sir glory
[1:23:04] to God but the prophet says people want
[1:23:06] him to be their savior uhhuh but they
[1:23:08] don't want him to be L that's the
[1:23:10] problem they want to tell God what to do
[1:23:12] uhh they want to tell God where to stop
[1:23:15] uhh they still want to wear their high
[1:23:17] heeled
[1:23:18] shoes 20 in preach my brother preach my
[1:23:22] brother
[1:23:23] Hallelujah somebody was saying I thought
[1:23:26] the service was good now he has
[1:23:30] started stay right there Hallelujah my
[1:23:35] brother I wasn't planning on speaking on
[1:23:37] this I saw an an article in New York
[1:23:40] Times of all places and they were saying
[1:23:43] how of all the things we don't
[1:23:46] understand why women are still wearing
[1:23:47] heels no they said stilettos I don't
[1:23:50] know what that is says because they were
[1:23:53] designed to attract
[1:23:55] men right that's exactly right it says
[1:23:59] they were designed for two things one to
[1:24:01] attract men go ahead two to give

[1:26:40] people want to limit that Faith to a
[1:26:41] Creed some want to limit to a
[1:26:44] denomination they so here we only
[1:26:46] believe in speaking in tongues Hey

[1:26:51] review to his church amen am but but I
[1:26:54] say this upon the authority of God's
[1:26:56] word there is no limit to the faith of
[1:26:59] God Amen that he left for his church
[1:27:02] amen because he said all things are
[1:27:04] possible to them that believe it's not
[1:27:07] limited amen amen that's what the
[1:27:10] prophet says amen he says imagine a
[1:27:12] mouse right eating the Garners of Egypt
[1:27:17] sparingly says oh I'm going to finish
[1:27:19] these Gunners you can never finish those
[1:27:21] Gunners of Egypt there is no limit to
[1:27:24] God's power amen amen the only limit
[1:27:27] that we have is the one that we put upon
[1:27:29] ourselves that's exactly right a greater
[1:27:32] than Solomon is here the prophet says
[1:27:34] brother yes sir if he isn't he is just a
[1:27:37] bunch of Creeds some people limit God to
[1:27:40] Creeds uhuh we might not be able to walk
[1:27:43] where Jesus did to sh to shout Down the
[1:27:45] Walls of Jericho I might not be able to
[1:27:47] walk like Enoch did and take a little
[1:27:49] straw and go over home with him without
[1:27:51] death but I will never stand in the way
[1:27:54] of somebody that believes that amen amen
[1:27:57] amen if somebody believes that God can
[1:27:59] heal them while they swimming at home
[1:28:01] say Amen to that amen alone if somebody
[1:28:05] believes that God can heal them as they
[1:28:06] sitting in the bench Amen to that
[1:28:09] Hallelujah there's no limit to what God
[1:28:12] can
[1:28:14] do there were four brothers in the Bible
[1:28:17] four friends yes my brother and these
[1:28:19] were good friends they had a friend if
[1:28:21] you know four is the number of
[1:28:23] redemption and there the fifth one who
[1:28:25] who has he are sick with the py right he
[1:28:27] was paralyzed and then they wanted to
[1:28:30] see Jesus and they went to where Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ was doing uh question and answers
[1:28:35] it was probably maybe it was Brother
[1:28:37] Kelly's house and people were throned
[1:28:40] people were everywhere it was
[1:28:43] packed but they had a friend who was
[1:28:47] crippled and they wanted him to see
[1:28:49] Jesus that's right you know you know
[1:28:52] what go ahead my brother friends that
[1:28:54] take you to Jesus are the best friends
[1:28:57] friends that take you to church are the
[1:28:59] best friends yes my brother Hallelujah a
[1:29:03] friend that will take you to church is
[1:29:05] the best friend yes my brother
[1:29:08] preach but a friend if he's always
[1:29:11] taking you to some other things then
[1:29:13] that's not a good friend but these four
[1:29:15] friends they were real good friends they
[1:29:19] they they packed him they packed him and
[1:29:22] I'll say something they probably dealt
[1:29:24] with him for many many years maybe
[1:29:27] sometimes when they were going in the
[1:29:28] aerplane they would put him in a wheo
[1:29:29] chair maybe sometimes they would carry
[1:29:31] him on the back they were they always
[1:29:34] had all these problems but you know what
[1:29:36] they said we're going to find a
[1:29:38] permanent solution and the permanent
[1:29:40] solution to our friend is to take him to
[1:29:43] Jesus and tonight Jesus Christ is the
[1:29:46] permanent
[1:29:50] solution the permanent solution is to
[1:29:52] come to
[1:29:53] church sometimes we try to witer our
[1:29:56] problems sometimes we try to pick them
[1:29:58] around just come to the word just come
[1:30:02] to the word and say Pastor I don't know
[1:30:05] what to do here what how how how can I
[1:30:08] handle this when you come to the word
[1:30:10] you get a permanent
[1:30:12] solution so these friends they realize
[1:30:15] this issue this friend is going to be a
[1:30:17] constant problem the only thing we need
[1:30:20] to do is to bring him to Jesus
[1:30:22] so when they got there in Hunter Brother

[1:37:43] caged a a Heavenly
[1:37:46] bird that was limited in
[1:37:49] faith don't go to
[1:37:54] Gastonia don't visit this

[1:38:01] jeroboam God God ripped 10 he took he
[1:38:04] gave him 10 kingdoms 10
[1:38:07] Kings and he says listen I've given you

[1:38:13] will go up to Jerusalem and sacrifice oh
[1:38:16] maybe they they'll join that church of
[1:38:18] ram of Solomon so you know what I'm I'm
[1:38:21] going to have my own Camp then he built
[1:38:23] altars that's exactly right says Ah

[1:38:29] here don't go to question and answers
[1:38:31] just just just hang around let's we can
[1:38:34] have barbecue here we can sacrifice
[1:38:38] here
[1:38:41] hallelujah catched eagles they live in a
[1:38:46] in a cage you know something about birds
[1:38:48] that live in a cage they make a a lot of
[1:38:54] noise and they have a lot of food
[1:38:57] because they are
[1:38:59] caged
[1:39:03] Hallelujah I am going to chalk
[1:39:07] it cat the E cat the birds they make a
[1:39:10] lot of noise that's why many people who
[1:39:13] are depressed they are very prolific on
[1:39:16] social media that's science that's not
[1:39:19] me that's science
[1:39:22] Hallelujah anyway let me let's
[1:39:29] continue while this group down right
[1:39:31] here has got 2,000 years at the river
[1:39:34] you FR is the prophet says that the
[1:39:37] church bound the holy
[1:39:39] ghost at at Euphrates for 2,000 years by
[1:39:43] creating dogmas that's the Feast of
[1:39:46] trumpets but it says but now the holy
[1:39:49] ghost that teaching rain the Mur is
[1:39:52] coming to remove all the Creeds that the
[1:39:55] Holy Ghost may be released in the
[1:39:58] church you can never have a genuine Holy
[1:40:02] Spirit without a genuine word because
[1:40:05] the holy spirit is the spirit of the
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:12] word how can you have con toas without
[1:40:17] corn
[1:40:18] Hallelujah because it comes from from
[1:40:21] from corn right the holy spirit is the
[1:40:24] word in spirit form so the prophet says
[1:40:28] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:29] believing the word because you cannot
[1:40:32] deny the word the prophet says Christ
[1:40:35] cannot deny his own word he cannot deny
[1:40:40] himself so when you Che the word out you
[1:40:44] are taking the Holy Spirit out of the
[1:40:46] church because the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:40:49] upon the word and one of the signs that
[1:40:52] one I said one of the signs that
[1:40:55] somebody is has the spirit of God they
[1:40:57] feed upon the
[1:40:59] word there's no way how can you there's
[1:41:01] no way because the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:41:03] upon the
[1:41:06] word so if you want to see whether you
[1:41:09] have the Holy Spirit see what you're
[1:41:10] feeding
[1:41:12] on look at your diet that tells you who
[1:41:16] you
[1:41:17] are

[1:41:27] me someone says Netflix from the from
[1:41:30] the back
[1:41:32] there I don't know what that is but they
[1:41:35] saying the Holy Ghost does not feed on
[1:41:42] that someone said HBO what is
[1:41:46] that the Holy Spirit does not feed on
[1:41:49] that am amen
[1:41:51] oh someone said Hulu the Holy Spirit
[1:41:54] does not fit on Hulu it fits on the
[1:41:57] [Applause]

[1:42:05] are
[1:42:06] [Applause]

[1:47:00] religion on Sunday in a cathedral we do
[1:47:03] our religion every
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:08] day that's why we don't wear uniforms

[1:47:14] righteousness
[1:47:16] Hallelujah you know back home we have
[1:47:19] churches that wear uniform

[1:47:27] uniform you have it all the
[1:47:31] time

[1:47:40] hallelujah oh my and when you are in
[1:47:43] Christ Jesus by the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:46] Ghost every gift of God belongs in the
[1:47:48] church amen amen we don't want one gift
[1:47:51] in the church where you have one brother
[1:47:54] just preaching all the
[1:47:55] meetings there's only one man who had
[1:47:58] the worldwide Ministry that was brother
[1:48:00] Bram all of us we compliment one another
[1:48:04] we want all the gifts in the
[1:48:08] B now notice again now that's his
[1:48:11] threefold purpose yes sir to restore
[1:48:13] back Eden bring back which was lost that
[1:48:16] was the only thing out of order all the
[1:48:18] rest of the things was in order so the
[1:48:21] prophet says that Jesus Christ wants to
[1:48:23] rest restore back Faith uh hidden
[1:48:27] condition again I have to rush here
[1:48:29] because I've got many slides and I'm
[1:48:30] going to close pretty soon the prophet
[1:48:32] says says in in perfect faith and so
[1:48:35] when a man lives by faith right and he
[1:48:37] walks by faith I mean substance Faith he
[1:48:41] is isolated from the entire world and
[1:48:44] becomes a new creature in Christ amen
[1:48:47] amen then now you are getting into
[1:48:49] bright Bri
[1:48:51] material I mean I could preach two hours
[1:48:54] on bright material says bright
[1:48:57] material not not Pentecostal material
[1:49:01] but bright
[1:49:03] material see see you are getting into
[1:49:06] rapturing
[1:49:09] condition now for the Rapture to take
[1:49:12] place there has to be a
[1:49:15] condition the church has to be in a
[1:49:18] certain condition
[1:49:21] right for a woman to give birth she has
[1:49:23] to be in a certain condition that's
[1:49:26] exactly right and the Rapture can never
[1:49:29] happen unless we come into Rapture
[1:49:32] condition and the prophet says it's it's
[1:49:34] when we live by faith until we walk
[1:49:36] unconscious of
[1:49:40] it in the book of Acts when they were
[1:49:43] praying for for Peter somebody knocked
[1:49:46] on the door and they said maybe it's his
[1:49:49] angel
[1:49:50] they were unconscious of it they it it
[1:49:54] was normal for them to say I think maybe
[1:49:57] it's an angel today if you say it people
[1:49:59] think you are you're going nuts why
[1:50:03] because we have lost the the faith that
[1:50:06] was once delivered to the Saints but the
[1:50:09] prophet is saying we walk by faith
[1:50:12] unconsciously until it becomes a
[1:50:17] condition you are just in a rapture
[1:50:21] you are just walking until anytime you
[1:50:24] can just
[1:50:26] disappear anytime you can just
[1:50:30] disappear that's the condition that
[1:50:33] Elijah was in that's why the kept on the
[1:50:36] Centurion he said Lord he said Elijah if
[1:50:41] we if I go to the king you may disappear
[1:50:44] I Mayan not find you
[1:50:46] again because we know your condition you
[1:50:49] can just appear and disappear you can
[1:50:52] just you say Phillip could be walking
[1:50:56] and
[1:50:57] disappears and starts witnessing to an
[1:50:59] Ethiopian unic and he reappears again in
[1:51:03] Samaria and it was
[1:51:05] unconscious it was not a
[1:51:08] headline oh Believers Believers portal
[1:51:12] oh this happened this this brother oh he
[1:51:16] disappeared no it was just unconscious
[1:51:20] stepen says I see Christ standing on the
[1:51:23] right hand of God I see Angels it
[1:51:27] becomes
[1:51:29] unconscious for someone to say brother
[1:51:31] Aaron I was praying yesterday I the Lord
[1:51:33] showed me a vision about this this oh we
[1:51:36] say let's pray that's we want to thank
[1:51:38] God you know it's it becomes simple and
[1:51:40] unconscious that's
[1:51:42] it but it's breaking news oh last month
[1:51:46] someone spoke in tongues friends we are
[1:51:48] not yet there
[1:51:52] we are not yet there we have to come to
[1:51:55] a Rapture
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:52:03] condition and he says in B and that's
[1:52:06] the condition I think the church will be
[1:52:09] just in before the coming of the Lord so
[1:52:11] the Rapture will just go right on amen
[1:52:14] amen that's what the church needs to be
[1:52:17] a regular routine of following the
[1:52:19] scripture and the plans of
[1:52:22] godall Enoch was just doing his Daily
[1:52:27] Business Like The Prophet can I have
[1:52:29] five
[1:52:31] minutes he he was not in church when the
[1:52:34] fish was
[1:52:35] created it was just a a routine and
[1:52:38] ordinary life it was a condition that
[1:52:42] they were in am and Banks woods and liar
[1:52:46] we said well how about we go and tell
[1:52:48] that joas woman jeah sness woman lady
[1:52:52] you know we we received you know
[1:52:53] conversion she was good to us and the
[1:52:55] prophet says that pleased the Holy
[1:52:56] Spirit and because of that when they
[1:52:59] were fishing says little fish I give you
[1:53:02] your life in the name of Jesus Amen it
[1:53:06] was a Rapture condition that's the time
[1:53:10] was not right but the condition was good
[1:53:12] that's it was not in a prayer line it
[1:53:16] was Brothers
[1:53:18] fishing it was not in church it was
[1:53:22] Brothers fishing somewhere in
[1:53:28] Gastonia it was brother Bram in Colorado

[1:53:34] Jeffersonville he was in the mountains
[1:53:37] hunting it was brother Bram in the woods

[1:53:43] squirrels that cost less than $10 if you
[1:53:46] combine the cost of six squirel to today
[1:53:49] it would cost you less than $10 but he
[1:53:52] was going about his daily
[1:53:57] life he was in the
[1:53:59] forest he says I I started to see myself
[1:54:02] becoming young and I saw my my wife
[1:54:05] before me from the time when we got
[1:54:08] married it was a condition that he was
[1:54:11] getting into and I want to say this
[1:54:14] friends as I'm as I'm closing the
[1:54:16] Rapture is a condition the Rapture is a
[1:54:21] process and that process means that we
[1:54:23] have to come to our
[1:54:25] place it's not a condition where you are
[1:54:28] being forced to come to church you are
[1:54:30] being forced to pay your tith that is
[1:54:32] not the condition of the
[1:54:35] Rapture Israel has recognized the place
[1:54:39] she said we are going to defend ourself
[1:54:42] even if we have to stand alone it we
[1:54:44] will stand defending our promise our
[1:54:46] land it she Israel is in the condition
[1:54:50] to receive Moses and
[1:54:52] Elijah and the church has to be in the
[1:54:55] condition Hallelujah to receive Jesus
[1:54:59] Christ in the
[1:55:01] clouds it's not a a fighting and fasting
[1:55:04] Condition it's not fighting over
[1:55:07] Doctrine if if somebody wants to believe

[1:55:12] brother somebody somebody said to me you
[1:55:14] know Aon I wanted to tell you I'm

[1:55:38] this light it's a Rapture
[1:55:42] [Applause]
[1:55:46] condition
[1:55:48] Hallelujah friends rapturing faith it
[1:55:51] overcomes all
[1:55:52] limitations the prophet says that if a
[1:55:55] plane goes past the sound barrier is
[1:55:59] unlimited what it can
[1:56:01] do and it says if the church could only
[1:56:04] go past the sin barrier past the
[1:56:07] denominational barrier past the Creed
[1:56:10] barrier past the flesh barrier it's
[1:56:14] unlimited brother Bram says he says
[1:56:16] Albert
[1:56:17] Einstein he says if only he would apply
[1:56:20] what he was studying to the spirit he
[1:56:23] says if you can get in contact with
[1:56:24] something you can have unlimited energy
[1:56:28] it says if only he could apply it in the
[1:56:30] spirit that if we could surrender
[1:56:32] ourself and get hold of something then
[1:56:35] we would tap into the
[1:56:38] unlimited the realm of the unlimited
[1:56:41] where all things are
[1:56:44] possible where Paul say the angel yes
[1:56:47] sir whose I am stood with me t night
[1:56:50] that's right and he says no one is going
[1:56:51] to perish it only remain in the boat it
[1:56:55] that was a condition my brother my
[1:56:57] sister they were not arguing about what
[1:57:00] is the best barbecue in in in in
[1:57:03] Charlotte they were in a certain
[1:57:06] condition I am falling short of that
[1:57:08] condition and I want God to help me to
[1:57:11] come to that place to come to that place
[1:57:15] where even even when you are praying for
[1:57:17] food on the table they such an
[1:57:20] atmosphere you can almost want to crash
[1:57:23] there is such a holy spirit atmosphere
[1:57:26] one time someone got converted by seeing
[1:57:29] brother Bram walking that's right the
[1:57:33] the condition can be so good when he was
[1:57:36] in deran South Africa Hallelujah people
[1:57:39] were weeping from 20 miles away because
[1:57:42] of the atmosphere that was there and he
[1:57:46] says brother brother Roy borders and
[1:57:49] brother assment they don't know why they
[1:57:50] were weeping it's because he was meeting
[1:57:53] with me up there they could be such an
[1:57:57] condition and atmosphere in the church
[1:58:01] that even before a sermon is preached
[1:58:04] the young people receive the Holy Spirit
[1:58:07] I believe that tonight with all of my
[1:58:09] heart that God can do itth he can do it
[1:58:12] for you he can do it for you he can do
[1:58:14] it for this church we can stand upon our
[1:58:18] feet
[1:58:19] [Applause]
[1:58:22] friends I want to be in that condition
[1:58:25] the condition of the
[1:58:27] Rapture I want to walk in that path amen
[1:58:30] H Hallelujah somebody say in the
[1:58:33] footsteps of
[1:58:35] Elohim I want to be in that condition
[1:58:37] you know there were people that were
[1:58:39] sent to arrest Jesus when they came to
[1:58:43] arrest him they could not hold him
[1:58:45] that's exactly right the Bible says they
[1:58:47] came back and they said why didn't you
[1:58:49] arrest him says never a man SP like this
[1:58:51] man there was an atmosphere around him
[1:58:55] that they could not get hold of him
[1:58:58] there's a scripture where they were
[1:59:00] taking stones to Stone Jesus but the
[1:59:02] Bible says he went through their
[1:59:04] midest they could not Stone him that's
[1:59:07] right because there was a certain
[1:59:09] atmosphere the prophet says sometimes I
[1:59:11] I can forget my knife at home and I just
[1:59:14] believe and I see it in my pocket it's a
[1:59:17] condition my brother bless you Church
[1:59:20] brother
[1:59:30] Sten amen amen amen amen amen wonderful
[1:59:36] praise be to the name of the Lord let's
[1:59:39] give the Lord again a big clap offer
[1:59:43] amen
[1:59:46] amen you can see clearly how the holy SP
[1:59:49] spirit is
[1:59:50] working and you know who spoke to
[1:59:54] you you know what you're
[1:59:56] doing you know what you know that I
[2:00:00] don't know and God through the
[2:00:03] discernment of the
[2:00:05] word has ambushed you and told you where
[2:00:10] the problem is amen this is not game
[2:00:14] this is the word doing its own job amen
[2:00:19] am amen remember I told you if you don't
[2:00:23] know and the preacher don't know you and
[2:00:27] he doesn't leave with you and he come on
[2:00:30] this pulpit and he say something that
[2:00:32] you know exactly that you are
[2:00:35] doing you don't need any more
[2:00:38] Vision because that's the highest form
[2:00:41] that God can speak to you in other word
[2:00:44] God is talking to you
[2:00:46] directly he you don't have to stand and
[2:00:49] here that save the Lord that's our
[2:00:51] Pentecostal understanding God is talking
[2:00:55] to you directly about your life about
[2:00:58] your home about the
[2:01:00] immaturity and God want you to be in the
[2:01:04] place where he predestinated you to be
[2:01:08] God want you to reach that
[2:01:11] place amen I keep repeating almost every
[2:01:15] Sunday I say we are Ruth is resting
[2:01:20] there is a condition that rof need to be
[2:01:23] before she can be United with boas you
[2:01:26] now going to get in this Rapture just
[2:01:28] playing
[2:01:29] games amen God is coming to pick up
[2:01:33] something that look like him
[2:01:37] amen we have Calvinism in this message
[2:01:41] that have taken the grace of God
[2:01:43] overboard where people continue to do
[2:01:46] what they're doing and they say oh we
[2:01:47] will all make it by grace we will go to
[2:01:50] Heaven by Grace oh brother oh Grace it's
[2:01:52] only Grace who will make us there no one
[2:01:54] is worthy to be you are fooling
[2:01:58] yourself amen Grace send the word Grace
[2:02:03] send the Savior Grace open the seals
[2:02:06] when the Capstone is coming he says
[2:02:08] Grace so everything even brother
[2:02:11] brandham came to us by Grace it is the
[2:02:14] grace of God that sent Elijah the
[2:02:16] prophet so I don't know which Grace you
[2:02:18] are talking about
[2:02:19] right Grace is God coming tonight and
[2:02:22] speaking to you God could have left you
[2:02:26] to continue what you're doing and get in
[2:02:28] trouble but his grace he's sending
[2:02:30] someone because if it's me sometime you
[2:02:33] might say he knows my condition or maybe
[2:02:36] because I did something that's why he's
[2:02:38] saying that now it's not brother Steven
[2:02:41] it is somebody who's coming from samels
[2:02:43] who's speaking things directly and I
[2:02:45] know what he's talking about amen amen
[2:02:49] church God wants you to reach that
[2:02:52] higher
[2:02:53] level on Sunday we gave you the quote
[2:02:56] brother brandham say that it would take
[2:02:58] a perfect Faith to run the perfect word
[2:03:02] perfectly amen this message need a
[2:03:06] perfect Faith amen so that the message
[2:03:09] can be fully efficient in our life if
[2:03:13] not we're using the wrong pipe and we
[2:03:16] just getting ready to bust because what
[2:03:19] we have doesn't match the level of what
[2:03:22] God sent us but the good
[2:03:25] news in you God already predestinated
[2:03:29] you that pipe is there it's just
[2:03:33] clogged amen we just need to remove
[2:03:36] things away from God we need to take
[2:03:39] everything and put them behind God we
[2:03:42] need to take God and give him the
[2:03:44] preeminence and give him the first place
[2:03:47] so that whatever we do is
[2:03:50] secondary and let the things of God be
[2:03:53] first until if they tell you we need to
[2:03:56] read the Bible or we have to visit
[2:03:59] somebody you will tell that person I
[2:04:01] will see you later I need to read my
[2:04:03] Bible but what we do when we have to
[2:04:06] visit somebody we will take the Bible
[2:04:08] and push it aside and we will spend our
[2:04:11] time and what the devil will do he will
[2:04:13] hold you in that conversation five 6 7
[2:04:16] hours until you leave there you knocked
[2:04:19] out and you don't even have a chance to
[2:04:20] read that Bible and sometime you get in
[2:04:23] the conversation that you were not even
[2:04:25] supposed to get into it you're talking
[2:04:27] about this one you're talking about this
[2:04:29] one and things that doesn't even help
[2:04:31] you amen amen check your father son
[2:04:36] check where you are with God when they
[2:04:39] bring the things of God where are you at
[2:04:41] what is your interest what is your heart

[2:05:35] playing on the computer on my phone let
[2:05:37] me turn on to a message and listen to it
[2:05:40] or let me sit down and read one one or
[2:05:43] two pages and I bet you if you read one
[2:05:46] page then tomorrow you read the second
[2:05:48] before you know it you will see
[2:05:49] something kicking many times we want to
[2:05:52] pray we don't feel like praying and it's
[2:05:55] usually the devil and as soon as you
[2:05:57] make a decision you say I'm going to sit
[2:05:58] and start praying before you know it you
[2:06:00] will feel like whatever the tiredness or
[2:06:03] or the fatigue or whatever was attacking

[2:06:08] because that's the way things are if you

[2:06:14] to find yourself in trouble

[2:06:28] when we we cooking we are thinking about
[2:06:30] the Lord before we sleep we are
[2:06:32] meditating on the Lord that's how King
[2:06:35] nabuchadnezzar had a dream the Bible say
[2:06:37] he was thinking he was meditating about
[2:06:40] the future and God came and give him a
[2:06:42] dream what do you meditate on
[2:06:46] Amen what what do we need to push
[2:06:49] you amen Billy Paul dying doesn't do
[2:06:54] anything to you coid didn't change your
[2:06:57] desire toward God uh Israel over there
[2:07:01] didn't change your desire what else do
[2:07:03] you want God to do amen you waiting for
[2:07:07] California now because Billy Paul now is
[2:07:10] off the scene so maybe you are still
[2:07:11] waiting for California to go down and
[2:07:13] that's when you're going to wake up let
[2:07:15] me tell you something if what is
[2:07:16] happening in Israel is not waking you up
[2:07:19] if Billy Paul going home is not waking

[2:07:25] doubting if California goes down if
[2:07:28] you're going to wake up because you
[2:07:30] already created a habit you are immune
[2:07:33] to the things of God you are no longer
[2:07:36] sensitive to what God is doing you are
[2:07:38] more prone to meeting to Fellowship to
[2:07:43] meet people at the restaurant 10 hours 7
[2:07:46] hours talking and you find and until the
[2:07:49] conscience look like our conscience is
[2:07:51] sealed what
[2:07:53] happened God doesn't want you in that
[2:07:57] God wants you to be in the condition of
[2:07:59] the Rapture God is coming the Rapture is
[2:08:03] coming Jesus is coming God wants you to
[2:08:07] be in the condition that when he comes
[2:08:10] you won't be caught off guard if he find
[2:08:13] you cooking you ready to go because you
[2:08:15] are in the condition if you were taking
[2:08:18] a shower you ready to go because you are
[2:08:20] in the condition if you driving the car
[2:08:23] he he comes there you go from there
[2:08:26] because you are in the condition if you
[2:08:28] in school he was going to pick you in
[2:08:29] school if you at work he's going to pick
[2:08:31] you there if you're sleeping he's going
[2:08:33] to pick you wherever you are even if you

[2:08:39] call Billy Paul will answer because he
[2:08:42] went in the
