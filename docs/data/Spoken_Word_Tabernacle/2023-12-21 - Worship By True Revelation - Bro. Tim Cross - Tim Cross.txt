Bought body of the Lord Jesus Christ here on the earth in this hour what a wonderful privilege as it is privilege I I love that song that says there's never been a day like this day you know it's a it's a great time it's a distressing time it's a time of great trouble but it's a time of great Victory Amen to those that are in Christ and so it's a it's a wonderful privilege to be with you again and we certainly appreciate the invitation to come brother stevenh had reached out to me a couple of times but it didn't work out until tonight so we know the Lord has everything in his control and uh I'm here and you're here and he's here so I know we're in for a good time in the Lord this evening so may the Lord bless you it's really good to have my wife and daughter with me this evening too and so we'll just uh try to go right into the word if you'd like to turn with me in your Bibles to Matthew Chapter 2 um I had a busy day at work and I had to tried to get home early and get everything prepared and put together and it didn't work out that way and uh I I was you you just learn to depend on the Lord you know and and so when I got here I was in back and I open my bible and there was the note I've been looking for and so I know the Lord just is a great provider you know friends we have not followed cunningly devised fables and God is in control of everything I was telling brother Stephen that um good to see you brother and uh just we just returned last Wednesday from a a two- week trip my wife and I were I had the time off of work and we went up to Michigan and we saw her grandmother and uh then we went down through Indiana and from there through the city of St Louis Missouri and there's a national there's a United States national landmark in St Louis Missouri it's called the arch some of you may be familiar with it I've never seen it before and uh so I when I realized our route was taking us through there I thought I'd i' like to see that so the it just worked out where the room the hotel we got uh out the window had a view of it and uh I never really read up on it so I just I found something and and it said that that um Monument or that that structure was built by an Italian man uh who was the architect the designer and oversaw its construction and it said he began the construction of it in February of 1963 and completed it in October of 1965 and they call it the Gateway to the West God God makes everything testify to what he's doing no you know no nobody nobody coordinated that but but God Amen so uh I'm thank God we we're not stopping in the west we're going back to Eternity amen and so uh it's a wonderful privilege just to to be a part of what God is doing in this hour so I'd like to invite you to turn with me tonight to your uh Matthew Chapter 2 your Bibles and uh this this actually just kind of quickens to me Sunday uh at the home church and I bring you greetings from the apostolic Tabernacle and we're we're your sister Church uh on the other side over there just an hour or so away and uh U anyway brother Josh our pastor was bringing the the word of the Lord on Sunday morning and these things started coming to me so I'm sitting there trying to listen to and preach and writing a few notes of the things he was saying but a lot was coming by inspiration by the holy spirit for tonight's service so I pray the Lord will just speak tonight and uh give utterance and um Minister and and meet the needs let's go to him in prayer if you will and if you have something you're Desiring from the Lord and we'd like to make that known by a lifted head uh we know he's present and he's a he's a way maker Heavenly Father Lord Every Time We Gather Lord we're blessed because you said if even two or three of us would Gather in your name that you would be here and Lord we know that you are present tonight to break the bread of life to our hearts and so we ask you now Lord to move the flesh aside move me aside take my thoughts and my heart and all that I am into your complete control that you may speak tonight and that your word may go in power and demonstration Lord to drive the enemy out to drive away doubt and fear and Lord to open our understanding Lord make the word live to us like you did when you walked along the Emmas road with your disciples after your Resurrection and we thank you tonight Lord to know that you're not a baby in a Manger you're not a man walking the shores of Galilee Lord you're not a a a character from The a historical Bible but you are alive you are resurrected tonight you are expressing yourself in the revealed word of the hour which has found a resting place in the hearts of your redeemed body the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're Gathering where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together so we're gathering around that tonight Lord and asking you to come and break that bread of life to our hearts and join us to it father God that we can become the living expression of who you are in the earth today and in that in doing that Lord you will displace the enemy and every sickness disease uh every thought every anxiety whatever the enemy would try to use to bind your children father will be broken when the Jubilee trumpet is sounded father God the captives will go back home Lord back to the inheritance and may that happen tonight we know your Prophet said the preaching of the Gospel is the Jubilee trumpet to the believer so we ask you Lord now bless the reading of your word and guide the further part of the service we ask in Jesus name amen amen I just want to say too I really enjoyed that special I've heard that song many times times but never like that and so I believe the Lord just dropped in and and uh just inspired that and blessed that tonight so everything that's been done we just thank the Lord for it Matthew Chapter 2 we'll read here beginning at verse one uh down through um I guess it would be verse number 12 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea yes for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a capital g governor that shall rule My People Israel so what you're seeing here is the um the contrast of two kingdoms sir and the superior Kingdom is emerging to rise to preeminence amen so uh in verse 7 it says then Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared because it had been years right these wise men had been journeying now for years and when they um and he sent them he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they heard the king when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy because what it we and we make it into it but what it actually happened the star disappeared it when they entered the capital that the religious Capital the walled City Star vanished so then they had to consult the word which said you got to go to Bethlehem and when they exited the gates of the city the star reappeared amen they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house oh brother amen he was now in a house a Dwelling Place when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him Gifts of gold and frankincense and myrr and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way may the Lord bless the reading of his word there's so much here amen and brother shimbo brother Stephen is a teacher and I'm sure he's realizing this is probably months worth of sermon material here but um um let's just go through this tonight and ask the Lord to Quicken something that would help us amen because I I believe something that was happening here with these wise men uh we can understand and relate to it today because we have had a very similar experience amen and so we realize that that that for this to happen there had to be a shift yes sir in the heavens yes sir amen these these these were these men were um astrologers if you will or astronomists who studied the heavens watching how the stars and all those heavenly Majestic bodies would move and shift around and and it all said something but but they knew when this shift happened it was an indication that something had happened in the earth yes my brother amen now I want you to think uh 2,000 years ago and then about 50 to 60 years ago yes things happening in the heavens were an indication that something had happened on the earth yes my brother amen so it signaled them Christ is born yes my brother yes he has come to Earth amen amen The Dwelling Place of the Messiah amen now it's not a prophecy now it's not a promise now it's not something out in the future now it's fulfilled amen and so when that realization struck them brother amen then they realized it's time to leave where we were that's exactly right and go to where he is yes my brother yes my yes amen wherever you were when you realize something has signaled me I've got to leave where I am and go to where he is amen then they began the journey they loaded up the camels and they loaded up the gifts and they got all the provisions together and they begin to make this journey amen and when when this happens and you're pulling this way you know the the Bible speaks in Genesis of a journey that Mrs Adam made from when she was formed from the dust to return to the side that she was formed from amen so she began a journey back to where she came from and so these men were were taking a journey but they were following a star and mean they were following something that was once maybe a part of a greater lights yes my brother but had been separated but was testifying sir that a greater light is present that's right a greater light is shining but you'll never find the greater light without following the star and the star represents a messenger to testify that there is greater lights greater light than Luther had greater light than Wesley had greater light than Pentecost greater light than the restoration of the gifts amen amen there's a greater Light present but you'll never find the greater light without the star amen so the star is there to lead you to the greater light or to the source of where his light is coming from amen and so the star amen from the distance from where they were seeing it the star was indicating to them he's in the proximity that's of Jerusalem he's in the proximity of the religious Capital amen where they were looking for a messiah where they had constructed everything to prepare for the arrival of the Messiah the god of Moses the god of Abraham the god of Jacob amen the god of Isaac amen but when the star was born he wasn't born in the wal City he wasn't born in the denomination mean he wasn't born in the thing that they had constructed with without a true revelation of what his arrival where his arrival would be amen right he was next to it amen just like Christ being placed outside of his own church if you're looking for him in leoda he's not there if you're looking for him in the denominations he's not there they built something Amen to prepare for his arrival but without Revelation amen they missed the mark amen and they denominated and he wasn't there that's right amen so as as I spoke earlier they were there they go into the City and so then they ask they begin asking right where is he that is born King of the Jews we've seen his star in the east we've come to worship him so this news reaches the current or the present King and he goes another King another leader oh my what is happening so he you know he has a keen interest and and who is who is this Rising King and so we as we read uh they they they they went then go to the chief priests and the scribes and they say well according to the word right he'll be born in Bethlehem that's it he's not even going to be born here or raised here or housed here and so when when uh I wrote this down when they had found the headquarters they were still looking for him that's exactly right they found what was supposed to be the source or the seat or the throne right but they realized he is not here that's it there was a lot going on in Jerusalem that's right but he wasn't there that's exactly right there were monuments there were temples there were sacrifices there was worship there was all kinds of religious things being taken place but he wasn't there that's right how about today brothers and sisters because I'm titling this worship by true revelation amen there's worship going on but without Revelation it is in vain that's exactly right it is a form that's right it is a fashion it it's a Creed it's a dogma mean it may stimulate emotion but he's missing that's right and that's what they realized when they got there we see the city we see the walls we see the history we see the the we've got the Scrolls here we've got the words of the prophets but we don't have the god right how about it amen yes sir sounds like the sons of the Prophet right amen they they they they might have had the relics they might have had the robes they might have had this they might have had the history they might as you know we we used to follow Elijah but when Elisha went back down to the Jordan he wasn't asking where Elijah was he said where is the god of Elijah amen and the god of Elijah was with Elisha amen amen amen he had moved amen from from a groom into bride form he had moved from alpha to Omega if you will amen oh brother and sister so when they they they had found what was supposed to be the destination right and they got there and realized he wasn't there amen all of the relics were there all of all of the Sacred objects right were there but without him it's worthless right so when they consulted the word yes sir they realized he's in Bethlehem Judea when they Departed the wall City Jerusalem right the star reappeared that's it yes sir and I love it was it was so amazing to me how the scriptures said that when they heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East right went before them yes my brother it's almost like the star began to move that's it the star wasn't a stationary Star as it would seem to me but it was a movie that's exactly right it was leadership right right it was it was active right and friend when you really see this message uhhuh I don't want to be misunderstood when I say this but the children of Israel were not just following Moses they were following what Moses was following amen amen amen Moses was being led by the pillar of fire that's exactly he was being led by God in the form of the pillar of fire so when Moses left the scene the pillar of fire did not amen so a new leader rose up Joshua and they followed him as he followed the pillar of fire so amen we are we I'm not trying to disassociate us from the ministry of the Prophet amen but we are not fixated on the person the man the veil we are fixated and we we have been attract again just hold this in mind remember what I said the star leads you to his Source amen amen amen that's it and when you find that the star has done his job that's it the purpose of the star has been fulfilled amen when John introduced Christ John faded and he said follow him amen I'm not worthy to lose his shoes but there's one coming after me who's preferred before me he was the reason John had come there Amen to prepare their heart s for the appear the the the appearing the arrival of Christ amen so here the star reappears to lead them and then to stand over the place yes sir where he now is glory to God brother and sister this message has brought us to the place where Christ is where his abiding presence is the holiest of hly the Shina Glory a living God a living gospel a Living Word a power Amen to turn a a a dry dead Rod back into a buing fruit producing Church Hallelujah that's what this message has done brothers and sisters is it has brought us to a living reality amen of Christ presence here today Amen in his word and in his people people that's exactly right yes my brother yes sir and now yes my brother I know if you're listening or watching tonight you said no no no wait a minute brother Tim there was a movement emphasizing the presence of Christ in the peria movement well friend I'm going to tell you something with every false Doctrine or every out of balance out of balance every Dogma everything all all these these things we've dealt with down through the years and I could name them but it wouldn't help anything but let me tell you a a trick of a good farmer uhuh go ahead now he doesn't put a scarecrow next to a bunch of weeds no sir sir sir he puts a scarecrow next to the strawberries yes sir so the Scarecrow should not send you away from the powerful truth that is the reason there's a scarecrow there so there might have been a Doctrine about the presence of Christ and there might have been a Doctrine about this or that but there's a truth that's exactly right and that's the reason there's a counterfeit is because there's a truth there amen so I'm not going to let the counterfeit scare me away amen he is here he did not leave when the prophet left amen he left 2,000 years ago but he said I'm coming back and he came back in the form of the pillar of fire and the 120 of them came out of the upper room and that was Christ on the earth in a redeemed body amen doing exactly what he had done before he ascended in a many membered form that's EXA and the same thing has happened today God didn't just send a prophet with a message the message remained and has come into the hearts and lives of the redeemed Sons and Daughters of God around the world and it did not turn them into Brites it turned them into the Bride of Jesus Christ his very body here on the Earth today doing the same things he did yes my brother yes sir Christ sir is on the Earth today Hallelujah am am the headship of the word the king kingship of the word the Dominion of the word is here on the Earth today amen and so here come these wise men now and when they see this child the Lord Jesus right they unload their Treasures they bring everything out and they worshiped him right in Revelation yes my brother gold representing deity yes my brother frankincense the sweet smelling Savers Amen to recognize the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley and myrh to testify of his death that's right Amen to fulfill his purpose here on the earth amen worshiping yes sir a child go ahead go ahead now that has not turned the water into wine that is not performed a miracle that has done nothing yet to to Really display his Divine characteristics that's exactly right but Revelation yes my brother quickened them yes sir not to worship what he was going to become but to worship who he [Applause] is in whatever form whatever size whatever stage regardless of what the world say regardless of what the bulletin the newspapers the websites or the gossipers say Revelation calls them to worship this child sir as their King as their redeemer sir amen as the Messiah yes my brother Worship in true Revelation amen amen amen amen preach they weren't worshiping a coming King they were they were by Revelation they were declaring he is King that's exactly he is my king that's right this is my king that's right oh I'm getting ahead of myself I'm thinking about a time a little donkey came down a hill with a man on his back and they begin ripping the palm branches off of the trees that's right and singing hosana Glory to God in the highest and the and the and the and the and the doubters and the critics and the mockers said that's just a man that's just a carpenter son that's an ill legitimate mean that's a heretic but by Revelation they knew he is my king Hallelujah and he was their King yes amen yes my brother praise God amen amen his kingship yes sir presented a problem uhhuh there was another king and another kingdom right and in power right at the time right but when a king Rises to prominence uhhuh and to preeminence it involves more than just him praise God yes sir you never see a king rise to power without bringing others yes sir when David Rose to power amen he had his men with them amen they knew he was King years that's right before Israel recognized that's exactly right years before Saul recognized that's right that's it there was a revelation there yes my brother he is God's chosen king that's it and he was their King very early on he didn't have to have a crown he didn't have to have a royal robe he didn't have to have a palace he didn't have to have uh uh the any of those things amen any of those Royal things he was their King amen amen and so when he rose to power that's it they rose with him yes my brother because friends Revelation doesn't make you an admirer no sir no sir Revelation doesn't make you a spectator it you know when you go to a race if if you go to a race you're watching and you're cheering for your dri or if it's a horse race you're cheering for your horse and you're ride but this word revelation amen doesn't leave you on the sidelines celebrating what you're seeing in something else Revelation puts you in Revelation puts you in the race Revelation takes you off the sidelines takes you from the bystander takes you from the onlooker takes you from the criticism takes you from it looking from a distance and brings you into it yes sir into action Peter was an onlooker until the day of Pentecost he wanted it I'll never deny you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he wanted it but Pentecost produced it that's it and Pentecost put him into it that's exactly right yes sir he had see Revelation brings a new birth amen and the new birth brings you into the Revelation it makes you one with it brother and sister and it brings you into Power yes sir and places you that's exactly in your position in the Kingdom sharing your part of that Kingdom amen the amen yes my brother praise the Lord glory to God so true worship yes sir isn't celebrating a victory that has passed no real worship isn't recognizing altogether something that has already happened and looking back on it and thanking God for it worship by Revelation yes sir is recognizing and accepting by faith yes my brother a victory yes sir before or a Deliverance yes my brother that is imminent amen amen amen and is rejoicing and resting yes my brother in what is assuredly yes sir a finished work that's it yes sir that's Revelation yes my brother Revelation says I'm Healed that's all when you're symptoms say otherwise that's exactly right Revelation says I'm free that's exactly right when your feelings say otherwise Revelation says you're the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ amen when others might not see that amen but Revelation gives you the realization which brings you into the Fulfillment of it so that the healing the Salvation the deliverance and even Rapture Rapture is the unavoidable results of the revelation of the word of this hour not a past Day message but this day's message is producing has produced rapturing Faith Amen in the hearts of the Bride amen amen amen and to give you that illustration I'll take you back to the Old Testament Hallelujah where God says tomorrow I'm going to fight your battle right right you just go out in the morning and worship that's it and celebrates uhhuh before that before the victory yes sir yes sir yes sir that the victory is already one amen that is revelation amen Revelation says it's over amen it's done amen it's finished and I'm thanking God for what I know is already a done deal amen and I'm going to worship right into it until will these elements cat up catch up and reflect what God's word has already said let every man's word be a lie and God's word be the truth hallelujah oh brother sister amen I'm sure the world looking on that day Jesus stood there and said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and they said oh my what kind of church is this going to be but the prophet of God taught us that the church wasn't built on Jesus the church certainly wasn't built on Peter it wasn't built on some rock or some HED ground there but it was on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is and he said upon this he said and thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell glory to God you ever thought about that for a second go ahead my brother why did he say that the gates of hell go ahead aren't Gates an entrance go ahead my brother you got to go through the gate right to get into something that's exactly right so we can see the the the entrance or the welcome yes sir the the the the segue if you will I think it's the modern word forth into hell is fighting right against the Revelation and it will conquer everyone that does not have the Revelation the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against another entrance which is Christ the revelation of who he is to the individual is their entrance into him him or I might say back into him no man can come to me except my father draw him amen the son of man came to seek and save that which was lost Redemption means something that was once there is restored or reinstated to where it once [Applause] was true Revelation we'll bring true worship Hallelujah yes my yes sir oh my take another moment on that there there's you know here had to realize my days are numbered my kingdom my my Throne my legacy right there's a threat uhhuh and he was trying to extinguish the threat right and you know one day something was quickened in you yes sir yes sir yes my brother that presented a threat yes sir to a kingdom that thought yes sir had you conquered that's exactly right but Satan got a message one day uhuh yes sir years ago I worked at a a company in Charlotte and it was a heating air company and just a mile or so down the road on on the other side of the interstate was a real real poor area and they had a lot of prostitution and drugs and just you know a lot of uh not good things and then so there was a hotel right there and then a gas station right across from the hotel and you know just you know the kind of people right they just they and it's even a spirit yes sir you you could feel it it just you know yes sir but I went by there for years things it's all one day come through there and everything is different there's a Fresh coat of paint uhhuh there's lights everything's well illuminated everything was cleaned up and dressed up and all those seedy looking people and things it's all gone and had a sign the side of the store Under New Management that's it that's it that's it that's it that's it hey Herod Herod yes sir there's new management amen Satan there's du management you might have thought this was your domain you might have thought you had me conquered you might have thought for the rest of my life I would drink smoke and do drugs and party all those things but guess what there's new ownership there's a new manager and it causes a change in the worship amen something is birthed forth from the inside of you to pay homage to pay respects to represent a higher Kingdom brother and sister hallelujah hallelujah and I I don't have these things in my notes yes sir but you know the United States is a sovereign country there are many sovereign countries Canada is a sovereign country I'm sure even African countries and all around the world are sovereign countries but those sovereign countries like the United States will go into other areas of the world and they will purchase real estate the United States has them in Russia right they have them in the Middle East they have one in that just got moved what to Jerusalem if I'm not mistaken they call it an embassy yes sir and if you are from the United States and you find yourself in one of those foreign countries that's right you may be penniless right amen you you may be a a fugitive trying to get away perhaps even for a crime you are actually guilty of but no matter what your financial condition is no matter what your physical condition is no matter what the threats are against you if you can reach the embassy that's you are back on us soil and when you are Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ you don't just become an ambassador of Heaven you become an embassy you are the territory Hallelujah that Jesus Christ has placed a stake of ownership ship on you and that's why he told Peter whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven and you have the same divine power and characteristics and attributes as the king or the leader of the Kingdom in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall heal the sick they shall raise the dead if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them yes right why because the power of the kingdom and I'll tell you something else yes sir if one of your brothers or one of your sisters amen may not even yet realizing if they reach you sir they've reached the embassy that's it yes my brother yes sir you can be their defense yes my brother you can be their Harbor saf yes my brother you may be guilty of a crime you may be penniless that's right you may be broke you may be physically destitute but I'm here as your brother yes sir to to to hand to you to endow to you the benefits of the Kingdom amen Silver and Gold Have I not but such as I have in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk amen they weren't just ambassadors they were the embassy [Applause] glory to God I feel like running lap in this place they put two of them in a prison one night and said the prison is the property of the [Applause] state the walls the bars the concrete the roof this is the property of the state yes sir and they put Paul and Silas in there that's right but they didn't realize in another Embassy they put two embassies yes sir in one yes [Applause] sir and they prevailed yes my brother they prevailed yes sir by worshiping by Revelation we're not prisoners we're not captives no sir we're not a bunch of man followers no sir we're not deceived we're not defeated no sir Hallelujah and they praised God yes my brother and he shook the walls of their other Embassy that's right to the ground yes sir Hallelujah if you ever catch a revelation of the true church yes and what she stands for that's right and withstand the two Spirits working within the framework of the church you'll be Invincible yes my brother you will become the actual Embassy yes my God Glory Hallelujah yes my brother Hallelujah that just came out none of that praise God see you can extend salvation healing eternal life the seed comes through through the [Music] body oh brother and sister hallelujah we're not going to overcome we're not going to be raptured we already are in Rapture amen so I have this too Hallelujah the kingship yes sir is administered through the office amen or Ministry of a prophet yes my brother that's exactly right yes sir David's David's kingship over Israel followed his anointing that's EXA by a prophet that's exactly you say well wait a minute brother Tim Saul was the King Saul was anointed by Samuel the agency of a prophet right or the son of man Minister that's exactly right is the channel yes my brother through which the kingship or the Dominion God exactly right that is exactly right when I saw it I was sitting there Sunday I saw that yes sir amen yes sir and and it's and it's recognized amen by those with the prophetic capacity amen amen amen yes amen oh God that's why Simeon and Anna uhuh a prophet and prophetess uhhuh recognized yes sir when Mary brought him to the temple as a child that's exactly right they worshiped him as their Messiah as the Redeemer as their Resurrection Simon said now my soul can depart in peace because mine eyes have beheld the glory of God yes my brother Revelation yes sir caused him to worship amen a child that John had not even yet baptized yes my brother now if that wasn't God then what Simeon did was Antichrist Jehovah yes sir that's exactly right amen if he wasn't God then then we got something out of order that's right when he was born and when he was wor but he was God the entire time am he was God the entire time yes my brother and Revelation produced the true worship amen amen amen yes my brother so that that that principle yes I'm just touching on this I I need to find a place to close it's the the king's ship is administered through the office or Ministry of a prophet yes my brother yes see even Saul uhhuh that's where he lost yes he lost his kingship right by failing to remain aligned with theet brother we've seen that happen preach great ministries Yes sir great gifts yes sir lost yes sir their adherence yes sir their respect yes sir amen their subjection yes sir to the ministry of God's Prophet that's right and they lost everything that's right the kingdom was stripped away yes sir because he did not recognize the channel that's exactly right the channel that got him where he [Applause] was brother the the the same Prophet that anointed him the king said the kingdom has ripped his metal and and and Saul ripped Samuel's metal when Samuel told him what had happened because an evil spirit had overtaken Saul may the Lord help us yes sir that principle holds true for both king and queen amen both are royalty yes my and we while we were on this two we trip we went to Branson Missouri and there they have the Sight and Sound Theater of one of two in the United states where they do Christian dramas and I don't mean it's it's if you've ever heard of it or seen of it's it's it's unlike anything you've ever heard they they bring everything to life and you're you're sitting there and on the sides and in front of you the drama is unfolding yes it's it's really something but this was on the story of Esther and and something that was really interesting and they brought this out a little bit when um aashis lost vashti his Dominion was jeopardized because by their law there had to be a king and a queen yes so without the queen without the without woman without amen you see it you see what's going on Amen so that's why the search went out but even that even Esther's rise to the throne right and recognizing that required the uh the involvement of her uncle yes Mor Mor yes my brother and the chamberlains who prepared her yes my brother just like The Messengers prepare the bride to be presented to [Applause] Christ so they prepared her she was accepted but even after she was accepted she did not fully appreciate her position as the queen right exactly right the ministry of Moriah opened her realization to why God had ordained the circumstances yes sir to put her yes sir as a Jewish Queen sir on the throne next to a pagan King yes my brother and so the edict Goes Forth and again this is I'm just following the leadership of the Lord the edict Goes Forth because hmon amen realized that Mori wouldn't bow to him so he gets gets this decree sign that all the Jews are going to be exterminated C none of them about why they're under another Dominion they were captives they were in bondage but they were still loyal to the kingdom that they were born into by a promise to Abraham amen so they would not forfeit their position amen that God had given them to even be spared their lives am am and here's Esther now it's it's a very desperate situation it's the lives of all of her people and possibly even her own that's right if this is discovered and she's overwhelmed she's overcome by this and it's placed her in in a great Jeopardy and great dist Stress and Anxiety and Mori comes to her yes sir it says Esther for such a time as this this these circumstances are exactly why you are where you are that's exactly and so many times we go Lord why me why me why did I get this diagnosis why is this happening to my children my family my parents my church all these my job all these why does this happen to me preach why not you preach how else PR would God prove himself Hallelujah vindicate you yes sir and place you in that very position to recognize you've got something to declare amen amen and if you don't declare it you'll die that's it if you don't recognize who you are and you're too shy or afraid or embarrassed to stand up yes sir and say listen the entire time amen I was somebody else's Queen before I became yours that's what she told hasis I was Jehovah's Queen before I became yours why don't you tell your boss why don't you tell that worldly boyfriend girlfriend goe I was royalty you'll never make me royalty you'll never make me anything more I've already been made the bride the Son and Daughter of Jesus Christ but if she did not stand if she did not recognize who she was she would perish and all her people amen and she had to get the courage yes to come forward yes sir and say I am a Jew and when she did he wrote a prot action amen of Grace amen that was for her yes sir showing election amen there was a protection against his own decree of death that Grace provided to shelter you from the Justice of the law the same King that wrote the decree of death wrote a decree of grace to the bride I I would again I'm venturing a bit here but I believe what what what aash was saying was because she is a Jew and because she's mine I gret this exemption sir now now that I recognize who she was before she became mine I grant this oh my amen I've got to come to a to a close here but that um oh yes I was I had written here also Herod and his own wife had to recognize there's a new Administration yes sir and and John the Baptist was saiding it's not lawful right where was where was he reading from he was reading from another law that wasn't theirs am amen another Dominion yes sir was rising up to be reestablished Amen in the earth and in the hearts of the people amen amen oh my Lord help us tonight let's uh let's read Isaiah chapter 60 and I am soon be closing praise the Lord the prophet of God read this scripture what he preached the message Shalom Sierra Vista Arizona and it shows a great contrast Isaiah 60 verse1 arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people yes when if you listen to that message brother R goes into it he said what is happening in the world today and brother brother Josh was preaching about how brother Ben was talking about there's there's more preached there's more services in that era especially more revivals but but there's a famine for the hearing of the word so brother B says in this hour he says men aren't men anymore they're they're losing that burly they said they want to wear they they want to wear you know Sho shoes like Elvis and tight pants and now you know sure and and and women the say and he said women aren't women anymore it's it's and and I'll just read the quote here in a minute gross Darkness the people but the Lord yes sir remember now you're you're you're not just a star a fragment galaxies and light years away flickering and testifying to what you spun off of the glory of the

says here it say early at paragraph 41 he says we're facing here in our two subjects that we read the two scriptures rather a very contrast one to the other in Isaiah it says arise and shine for the glory of the Lord has come upon you the light is here and then the very next verse he says gross Darkness that's right is upon this people and then when we are in a mix mixery of light and darkness and then my address to the church sir is Shalom that's it peace yes sir let's find out what it's all about see we are facing this year with both Darkness and Light the world is one of the most in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's again yes sir standing again the Most Blessed light amen that it ever did Shine in yes sir the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness yes sir
