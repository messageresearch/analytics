[57:04] the Lord our next question and answer
[57:07] will be on April 15th that will be here
[57:11] at the church everybody clear I believe
[57:13] I got everything covered so far and
[57:16] there is one more we appreciate
[57:19] everybody
[57:21] that is following us on streaming online
[57:24] some of them are very consistent they
[57:26] like part of this church so God richly
[57:29] bless you welcome this morning and we
[57:32] welcome you also to spoken word
[57:34] Tabernacle and I want to clarify
[57:37] something when I say I'm preaching this
[57:39] for this church
[57:41] what do I really mean
[57:45] amen
[57:47] brother Branham says this glory to God
[57:51] he says
[57:52] now a way we try to follow here at the
[57:56] Tabernacle
[57:58] is the only place in the world that I go
[58:02] and I do what preach Doctrine
[58:06] everybody okay
[58:07] he's here at the Tabernacle because this
[58:11] is our church and we preach Doctrine
[58:14] here to keep the people lying now add a
[58:18] man in their churches
[58:20] they preach whatever they believe and
[58:23] they are my brothers and we might
[58:26] different a little bit
[58:28] but we still brother just the same but
[58:31] here in the Tabernacle we preach what we
[58:35] think is scriptural Doctrine
[58:38] everybody okay I have ministered I have
[58:42] opened the entire congregation to be
[58:45] listening to what I preach here
[58:48] everybody okay
[58:50] the entire congregation they're not even
[58:52] in America they're listening to what I'm
[58:54] preaching here that's the decision of
[58:57] the shepherd but we have a lot of
[58:59] Minister I talked to them they'll send
[59:01] me asking me question a lot of ministers
[59:04] that are following and As I Grew in this
[59:07] message by the grace of God I come
[59:10] across a lot of Doctrine not that I went
[59:14] in different churches but sometimes when
[59:16] I talk to people and I can catch a
[59:18] Doctrine and a Doctrine and a Doctrine
[59:20] in the doctrine amen so every church is
[59:22] Sovereign so sometimes there are things
[59:25] that I will be preaching here I'm gonna
[59:28] go through the scripture and through the
[59:30] message of the hour but he must Shake
[59:32] somebody else Doctrine somewhere that is
[59:35] streaming so I want to respect their
[59:40] Church uh Authority or Supremacy that's
[59:43] the reason why I usually refer that I'm
[59:46] preaching to this church but if you are
[59:49] receiving it as the word of God there is
[59:52] no problem at all because what I preach
[59:54] doesn't come from myself I usually
[59:56] started from the scripture and I back it
[59:59] up with the message of the hour amen so
[1:00:02] if my Doctrine here which is the message
[1:00:05] of the hour is a little bit different
[1:00:07] view than what another Minister sees
[1:00:09] there that's the reason why I usually
[1:00:11] say this is for discharge amen but in
[1:00:16] all respect you're more than welcome to
[1:00:18] take the code take the scripture because
[1:00:20] after all we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:22] Christ and the gift is for the
[1:00:25] perfecting of the
[1:00:27] descent amen the entire blood so if he
[1:00:30] blesses you praise the Lord but I want
[1:00:33] to just respect the local church right
[1:00:36] there and make sure if what you're
[1:00:38] preaching people you follow your pastor
[1:00:40] but I'm responsible for this church but
[1:00:43] more than welcome welcome welcome
[1:00:45] welcome and we're good to have you
[1:00:48] online on board thank you very much and
[1:00:51] welcome in spoken word Tabernacle amen
[1:00:54] so when I say I'm preaching to this
[1:00:56] church I'm just going to be cautious
[1:00:58] about other ministers having a different
[1:01:01] point of view in their Doctrine compared
[1:01:04] to what I'm bringing here everybody okay
[1:01:06] so welcome online thank you very much to
[1:01:10] have you on board let's stand and go to
[1:01:12] our scripture
[1:01:15] glory to God
[1:01:18] Hallelujah
[1:01:25] I was so happy with the question and
[1:01:27] answer yesterday
[1:01:30] if you were not there we already
[1:01:32] established what we believe here so do
[1:01:34] not bring again tape stuff and
[1:01:37] discussion and stuff we don't have time
[1:01:39] for that we gave you scripture we gave
[1:01:42] you code and we nail it and I'm gonna
[1:01:45] add five more quotes
[1:01:47] everybody okay and then we move on we
[1:01:50] already preach about church order
[1:01:51] December 3rd Church order in February we
[1:01:54] spoke about music how to calibrate music
[1:01:56] we will go with part two we went through
[1:01:59] our position here there is even
[1:02:01] something that I'm letting someone to
[1:02:03] ask the question I already got the
[1:02:05] vaccine for it so whoever will ask the
[1:02:09] question then I will
[1:02:10] pull it out amen and it will answer some
[1:02:14] some of the stuff that are going around
[1:02:21] amen glory to God let's go to Genesis
[1:02:25] chapter 38.
[1:02:31] this church is so relaxing
[1:02:37] again last Sunday we were unable to
[1:02:41] touch what I wanted to touch
[1:02:44] this is a very difficult subject
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] it is very very difficult
[1:02:53] any puzzle ministers
[1:02:55] and Pastor on this subject
[1:02:58] so I want you to follow me carefully
[1:03:01] because a lot of Souls
[1:03:03] have been blocked
[1:03:06] because of this and they don't know what
[1:03:09] to do and it can cause somebody to
[1:03:12] commit suicide
[1:03:14] if you don't know what you're doing
[1:03:17] but today nobody will commit suicide
[1:03:21] we will take you off from where you are
[1:03:24] and free you completely because you will
[1:03:28] know the truth and the truth will set
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:32] everybody okay God is not the author of
[1:03:35] confusion
[1:03:37] God never the author of confusion so
[1:03:40] it's a very very difficult subject stay
[1:03:44] up
[1:03:45] and follow me carefully everybody okay
[1:03:49] Genesis chapter 38 if you dare you can
[1:03:52] say Amen
[1:03:55] I'm going to start by verse 11. the same
[1:03:58] scripture we read then say Judah to
[1:04:01] Tamar his daughter-in-law remain a widow
[1:04:04] you know now what he means at your
[1:04:06] father's house
[1:04:07] till Sheila my son be grown for he said
[1:04:11] lest perhaps he die also as his breath
[1:04:15] indeed and Tema went and dwelled in her
[1:04:19] father's house so Judah want to play
[1:04:21] tricks on this woman thinking maybe
[1:04:23] she's a witch killing my children I
[1:04:26] don't want the third one to die you need
[1:04:28] to stay away
[1:04:29] everybody okay
[1:04:31] in in the process of time you might be
[1:04:34] seated
[1:04:35] you know why you stand for the scripture
[1:04:37] right
[1:04:38] you saw you remember yesterday right
[1:04:40] okay and in the process of time the
[1:04:43] daughter of shua judah's wife died
[1:04:46] and was comforted and went up to the to
[1:04:49] his ships here to timna he and his
[1:04:53] friend ARA the adolomite and he was told
[1:04:57] Tamar saying behold your father-in-law
[1:05:00] goes up to timna to share his ship
[1:05:03] everybody clear and she put her widows
[1:05:06] garment off from her and cover her with
[1:05:09] a veil and wrap herself and sat in an
[1:05:12] open place where is
[1:05:15] which is by the way to Tim now for she
[1:05:18] saw that Sheila was grown and she was
[1:05:21] getting she was uh and she was not given
[1:05:23] to him as a wife in other words my
[1:05:26] husband is grown up I was supposed to be
[1:05:29] married but it looks like I perceived
[1:05:31] something is wrong when Judah saw her he
[1:05:35] thought her to be a harlot
[1:05:38] but she was not a Harlow she was her
[1:05:41] daughter-in-law because she had covered
[1:05:44] her face
[1:05:45] and he turned to her by the way and say
[1:05:47] God too I pray you let me come into you
[1:05:52] for he knew not that she was his
[1:05:54] daughter-in-law everybody clear there
[1:05:56] and she said what will you give me that
[1:06:00] you may come into me and he said I will
[1:06:03] send you a kid from The Flock and she
[1:06:06] said will you give me a pledge in other
[1:06:07] words Judah didn't have his wallet
[1:06:10] until you send it and he said what
[1:06:13] pledge shall I give you and she said
[1:06:16] your Signet you know what he means and
[1:06:18] your bracelet plural you know what he
[1:06:20] means and your stuff that is in your
[1:06:22] hand and he gave it her and he came into
[1:06:27] her and she conceived by him if you
[1:06:30] notice
[1:06:31] Judah didn't give these things before
[1:06:35] the ACT
[1:06:37] Amina after the ACT
[1:06:41] hey everybody okay He Did It Before
[1:06:45] the woman want to make sure
[1:06:49] that I must receive my payment
[1:06:53] everybody okay before we move further
[1:06:56] into business
[1:06:57] I want to make sure you know what you're
[1:07:00] doing
[1:07:01] and Judah check and he realized he does
[1:07:03] have his wallet and the woman said no
[1:07:06] problem if you don't have a wallet I
[1:07:08] don't have any problem amen why didn't
[1:07:11] this woman say you don't have a wallet
[1:07:12] go ahead and go back
[1:07:14] because she was not a true prostitute
[1:07:18] because the Bible says that a prostitute
[1:07:21] receive salary
[1:07:24] everybody okay she was not a true
[1:07:26] president she was playing like a
[1:07:29] prostitute in other words it is not
[1:07:31] money that I'm looking for
[1:07:34] I am not looking for money
[1:07:37] amen but I want you
[1:07:42] everybody okay and for some reason Judah
[1:07:46] could not say you know what I don't have
[1:07:47] money let me just let it go Judah said
[1:07:50] no no no no no no no no no let me give a
[1:07:52] place say what do you want to pledge
[1:07:54] Judah look nothing he said you see there
[1:07:56] look he say what my he said this yes can
[1:08:00] I have that one
[1:08:03] Judah pull it up and say he said that's
[1:08:06] okay say no
[1:08:08] you see what you're handling on the hand
[1:08:10] there
[1:08:12] woman
[1:08:15] they say hey you have a choice either
[1:08:18] you give it or you continue on the
[1:08:20] highway
[1:08:22] everybody okay Judah said you know what
[1:08:25] let me give it and she said you see the
[1:08:28] two bracelets here that say Jesus love
[1:08:31] me
[1:08:36] we already went to men do not put
[1:08:39] bracelet everybody okay you see the
[1:08:41] bracelet right here he says so what the
[1:08:44] president I already gave you two he said
[1:08:45] no in the mouth of two air
[1:08:49] witness I wanna go to through here give
[1:08:53] it to
[1:08:54] yes how many both of them Judah
[1:08:58] the woman turkey said praise the Lord
[1:09:00] now
[1:09:02] follow me
[1:09:04] what is going on
[1:09:07] what's going on with Judah
[1:09:10] why he didn't borrow
[1:09:14] from his friend
[1:09:18] why
[1:09:21] interesting
[1:09:22] job to verse 24. if you dare you can say
[1:09:25] amen glory to God hallelujah and he came
[1:09:30] to pass
[1:09:32] about three months
[1:09:34] everything is gone that he was told
[1:09:37] Judah I'm skipping saying temar your
[1:09:40] daughter-in-law has played the Harlow
[1:09:43] and also behold she is with a child by
[1:09:48] water hold on not only did she play the
[1:09:51] Harlot because you can play the Harlot
[1:09:53] and go back and never get pregnant
[1:09:56] but for some reason this time just water
[1:10:01] she got pregnant
[1:10:03] why did it happen like that
[1:10:06] who arranged this thing
[1:10:11] was Judah in contact with all the OB GYN
[1:10:14] in the land
[1:10:16] how did he know stuff

[1:25:55] you didn't get me
[1:25:57] this seed were pushed into the
[1:26:01] congregation of Israel without the blood
[1:26:05] of Jesus Christ
[1:26:08] I'm gonna say it again these women were
[1:26:12] put in the congregation of Israel and
[1:26:15] they're the old Covenant
[1:26:18] and the old covenant could never bring
[1:26:21] things to perfection
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:26] how can they enter
[1:26:29] with something that cannot make them
[1:26:31] perfect
[1:26:34] everybody okay so when you talk about
[1:26:37] Tema there is a bad connotation
[1:26:41] if you talk about rehab there is a bad
[1:26:45] connotation
[1:26:46] if you talk about roof no no no no
[1:26:48] that's a gentile woman if you talk about
[1:26:50] Bathsheba that's a bad woman
[1:26:54] her husband was in war look what she did
[1:26:59] everybody okay and then when you talk
[1:27:02] about Jesus the Bible said in John 4 8
[1:27:06] 40 41 but now you're seek to kill me a
[1:27:10] man that has taught you the truth which
[1:27:13] I have heard of who God this did not
[1:27:16] Abraham ye do the work of your father
[1:27:19] then say they to him to Jesus Christ we
[1:27:23] be not born of water even Jesus had the
[1:27:27] bad name
[1:27:31] everybody okay because according to the
[1:27:34] Jews the pregnancy that they say was
[1:27:37] virgin they say no you feelings nobody
[1:27:40] here nobody a virgin woman being
[1:27:42] pregnant you are fooling nobody there
[1:27:45] Joseph and Mary was doing something they
[1:27:48] did something that's why you were born
[1:27:50] of fornication
[1:27:52] and they took that tattle and they put
[1:27:54] on Jesus Christ so when Jesus Christ
[1:27:57] want to talk about the things of God
[1:27:58] they have that gun after a while they
[1:28:01] say you fornicated children shut up
[1:28:05] amen
[1:28:10] everybody okay let's go to the book of
[1:28:13] Acts
[1:28:18] that's what we do to people
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:23] that's what we do to people
[1:28:26] let's see who is a child of God
[1:28:30] let's see who
[1:28:34] can I help you up
[1:28:36] can I help you up
[1:28:38] Ishmael
[1:28:40] was the Seed of Abraham
[1:28:45] do you see him there
[1:28:51] why is he not there
[1:28:54] if you take the DNA of Ishmael you go
[1:28:57] with it into Lab Corp you pull it out
[1:29:00] you check Abraham and Ishmael they match
[1:29:03] 120 percent
[1:29:06] everybody okay everybody okay but
[1:29:09] they're not here and Abraham have even
[1:29:11] six more songs by Keturah do you see
[1:29:15] them over there
[1:29:17] so why can they remove the children of
[1:29:19] Abraham and bring children that were
[1:29:22] born from a father-in-law and a
[1:29:23] daughter-in-law
[1:29:28] everybody okay
[1:29:30] let's go to act 20 Act 13.
[1:29:34] Lord help me help me help me father
[1:29:37] everybody okay

[1:29:58] I don't know if you get me
[1:30:01] this happened in the blood of bulls and
[1:30:04] goats
[1:30:05] but Jesus Christ
[1:30:07] when you get into him whatever was in
[1:30:11] you
[1:30:14] he can justify you from water
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:18] do you know what justify mean you
[1:30:21] already know in this church it means
[1:30:23] that you water
[1:30:25] use your microphone my brother it means
[1:30:27] what life you've never done it before
[1:30:29] you've never done it to begin with
[1:30:38] from which you could not be justified by
[1:30:41] the law of who Moses so where the Lord
[1:30:45] stop
[1:30:46] where they lock the law had a threshold
[1:30:50] when he goes to its threshold the law is
[1:30:53] blocked then Grace
[1:30:57] take over from there
[1:30:58] and push you toward the end
[1:31:02] everybody okay everybody okay was Grace
[1:31:05] in the Old Testament
[1:31:07] slow down don't answer
[1:31:11] verse 40 be aware therefore lest that
[1:31:15] come upon you which is spoken in the
[1:31:17] prophet behold you this person and
[1:31:21] wonder and perish for I work a work in
[1:31:24] your days
[1:31:25] in your days a work with you which you
[1:31:29] shall be
[1:31:30] which you shall in Noize believe through
[1:31:33] a door a man declare it to you
[1:31:37] Paul is saying be careful there is a
[1:31:40] prophecy that say no matter what God is
[1:31:43] doing
[1:31:45] amen they can do it to you but you won't
[1:31:47] believe it
[1:31:49] I'm afraid
[1:31:51] because I'm pushing the gospel by you
[1:31:53] pushing that back I'm trying to check
[1:31:56] are you some of these people fulfilling
[1:31:58] that prophecy
[1:32:00] we okay
[1:32:01] verse 42 and when the Jews were gone out
[1:32:04] of the synagogue the Gentile besought
[1:32:07] that this word might be preached to them
[1:32:09] the next water so the Jews remember
[1:32:12] yesterday they received Jesus Christ
[1:32:14] they were supposed to receive the
[1:32:16] Messiah when they went out they Jetta
[1:32:22] yes digital
[1:32:24] the Gentile came after Paul they said
[1:32:27] brother come
[1:32:29] yeah what you preach
[1:32:31] is different than these Jewish people
[1:32:33] here that we hear all the time
[1:32:36] is there a possibility next Sunday and
[1:32:40] next Saturday you can come again and we
[1:32:42] want to hear some of this stuff
[1:32:46] everybody okay what was in those
[1:32:49] gentiles
[1:32:52] that love Paul
[1:32:54] and the Jews born with Paul are
[1:32:58] rejecting Paul
[1:33:01] what's going on
[1:33:03] are we okay
[1:33:04] job to verse 43 now when the
[1:33:07] congregation was broken up many of the
[1:33:11] Jews and religious prosely you see that
[1:33:14] followed who Paul and Barnabas who's
[1:33:18] speaking to them persuaded them to
[1:33:21] continue in the grace of God and the
[1:33:24] next Sabbath day came almost the whole
[1:33:27] city
[1:33:29] together to hear the word of who God but
[1:33:33] when the Jews
[1:33:35] so demountited they were filled with
[1:33:38] water envy and spoke against those
[1:33:41] things which were spoken by who
[1:33:44] contradicting and blaspheming
[1:33:47] they begin to contradict the message of
[1:33:50] power
[1:33:54] they begin to blaspheme the message of
[1:33:57] Paul because Paul is drawing many
[1:34:00] followers
[1:34:01] everybody okay
[1:34:03] what happened verse 45 and when uh verse
[1:34:07] 46 then Paul and Barnabas watchbold
[1:34:11] and say it was necessary that the word
[1:34:15] of God should first have been spoken to
[1:34:17] you but seeing you put it from you
[1:34:21] you judge yourself how Unworthy of water
[1:34:25] everlasting life
[1:34:30] law we turn to the hook gentle for so
[1:34:33] has the Lord commended us saying I have
[1:34:36] set you to be a light of the Gentile
[1:34:39] that you should be for salvation to the
[1:34:42] end of the Earth watch verse 48 and when
[1:34:45] the Gentile heard this they were how
[1:34:48] glad
[1:34:49] Karma and the glorified the word
[1:34:54] they glorified the message of the hour
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:02] they didn't glorify Paul
[1:35:05] but the message of Paul
[1:35:07] they glorified the word of the Lord and
[1:35:11] as many as were water today to water
[1:35:15] eternal life did water believe what did
[1:35:18] they believe because they were ordained
[1:35:21] [Applause]

[1:38:26] precious name amen my subject this
[1:38:30] morning follow me carefully is the four
[1:38:33] phases of roof the theophany and the
[1:38:37] seed of Grace
[1:38:41] the theophany and the seed Grace
[1:38:46] this seed is Grace
[1:38:50] you can never separate this seed from
[1:38:52] the grace
[1:38:56] everybody okay if you have that seed you
[1:39:01] already have Grace
[1:39:03] because Grace always is coupled with
[1:39:07] that seed Grace and that seed are won
[1:39:11] when that seed is formed Grace is mixed
[1:39:15] together with that seed
[1:39:19] everybody okay everybody okay glory to
[1:39:23] God we are alternating moving back and
[1:39:27] forth between roof chapter three
[1:39:29] and roof chapter four because the roof
[1:39:33] enter Israel but she still cannot get
[1:39:35] into the congregation of Israel why
[1:39:38] because roof was a moabite
[1:39:40] everybody okay there was something
[1:39:44] by the birth of roof
[1:39:50] everybody okay that block roof
[1:39:53] from entering the congregation of Israel
[1:39:57] that thing that was blocking roof
[1:40:00] happened because of his birth
[1:40:05] he was born in a wrong country
[1:40:09] she was born in a wrong country in a
[1:40:14] wrong nation and with wrong parent
[1:40:19] and because of that she was black
[1:40:22] to enter the congregation of Israel so
[1:40:26] now Ruth chapter 3 and roof chapter 4
[1:40:30] are now working together
[1:40:32] everybody okay to break the hindrance of
[1:40:35] roof
[1:40:36] everybody okay and to open the way so
[1:40:40] that regardless of the breath of roof
[1:40:44] everybody okay regardless of the country
[1:40:48] of origin
[1:40:51] regardless of what hindrance is there
[1:40:56] roof must enter the congregation
[1:40:58] everybody okay when she entered then
[1:41:01] she's entitled to be United in the body
[1:41:06] amen and produce a baby baby in the
[1:41:10] Tabernacle we are alternating between
[1:41:13] the holiest and the changing of
[1:41:15] Dimension so what is going on today
[1:41:18] pastor
[1:41:22] when we spoke about the seed we found
[1:41:26] out that when God create his seed
[1:41:29] from a different line then line the
[1:41:32] temporary line remember yesterday
[1:41:34] we come out as a tabernacle of three
[1:41:37] part everybody okay
[1:41:40] we got the body
[1:41:42] we got our spirit
[1:41:44] and then we got the soul and in the soul
[1:41:48] in this tent in this Tabernacle inside
[1:41:51] the soul everybody okay there is
[1:41:54] something there that lays there and that
[1:41:57] thing is called the predestinated seed
[1:42:01] of God we already went through this you
[1:42:04] know that amen and we found out that
[1:42:07] this seed contain your whole identity
[1:42:13] everybody okay whatever you want today
[1:42:16] was already in daced
[1:42:19] hey everybody okay everything here is
[1:42:23] temporal
[1:42:26] everybody okay but this seed here is
[1:42:29] always eternal
[1:42:31] this seed never have a beginning and the
[1:42:35] seed never have an end
[1:42:37] as we saw last week brother Branham said
[1:42:40] remember you your eyes
[1:42:44] your stature whatever you want you were
[1:42:48] in his thinking at the beginning and the
[1:42:52] only thing that you are is expression
[1:42:56] that expression is called water word so
[1:42:58] that seed is a word
[1:43:02] everybody okay if you were there
[1:43:04] yesterday it makes your life really
[1:43:06] really happy
[1:43:07] everybody okay and that seed is the word
[1:43:10] and after he taught it he spoke it and
[1:43:14] here you are if it is not
[1:43:17] if he was not in his thinking there is
[1:43:20] no way enough for you to ever be there
[1:43:23] for he is the one that give water
[1:43:26] eternal life amen so if the seed is the
[1:43:30] word God himself is the word
[1:43:34] in other words by the seed we are
[1:43:37] automatically part of God
[1:43:42] everybody okay
[1:43:45] this is where we stop last Sunday we
[1:43:48] found in Luke chapter 8 verse 11 the
[1:43:50] Bible says that the seed is water the
[1:43:53] word of God and according to Matthew 13
[1:43:55] the Bible said the field is the world
[1:43:58] and the good water see we're not good is
[1:44:02] God the god seed or the waters Children
[1:44:06] of the Kingdom so not only is the word a
[1:44:09] seed we also we are seed
[1:44:15] everybody okay
[1:44:17] John 12 verse 24 says Jesus said verily
[1:44:21] verily I say unto you except the water
[1:44:23] corn of we Jesus himself call himself a
[1:44:27] corn of wheat
[1:44:29] in other words crushed easy seed
[1:44:33] The Book of Romans chapter 4 verse 16
[1:44:36] say therefore it is of water faith that
[1:44:39] it might be by grace to the end the
[1:44:43] promise might be sure to who all the sea
[1:44:46] if you notice the Bible didn't say all
[1:44:48] the seeds
[1:44:52] everybody okay the promise must be to
[1:44:55] all
[1:44:57] the seed instead of putting s the Bible
[1:45:01] leave it singular so those seed are part
[1:45:04] of a seed
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:09] are we okay are we okay we'll be all
[1:45:13] right
[1:45:14] not
[1:45:15] to that only which is of the law but to
[1:45:18] that also which is of the faith of who
[1:45:20] Abraham who is the father of us oh Roman
[1:45:24] nine because they are the Seed of
[1:45:26] Abraham neither because they are the
[1:45:28] Seed of Abraham or their children but in
[1:45:31] Isaac Shadow see if you notice against
[1:45:34] singular because that is they which are
[1:45:38] the children of the water flesh the Jews
[1:45:41] they are not the children of God
[1:45:43] but the children of the promise are
[1:45:46] counted for the water seed if you notice
[1:45:49] seed is still singular
[1:45:52] glory to God Lord help me Galatians 3
[1:45:55] verse 16. now to Abraham and his seeds
[1:45:59] singular where the promises made
[1:46:04] he said not and to water seeds that's
[1:46:07] not what he said as of what many but as
[1:46:11] of who won and that seed which is who
[1:46:14] Christ
[1:46:17] everybody okay
[1:46:19] galatian 33 verse 28 there is neither
[1:46:24] Jew nor Greek there is neither born nor
[1:46:28] free there is neither Mel nor female for
[1:46:31] year or how one in who Christ Jesus
[1:46:37] everybody okay so when we talk about God
[1:46:41] cross the seed that seed is a singular
[1:46:45] seed but inside that seed there is many
[1:46:49] seed
[1:46:51] and all the seeds are represented in one
[1:46:55] everybody okay

[2:05:18] verse 10.
[2:05:21] everybody okay
[2:05:24] who uh and the disciple came
[2:05:27] Jesus was talking to people using
[2:05:30] parable
[2:05:32] and the disciple look they say
[2:05:34] the way he's talking to them is
[2:05:37] different than the way he talked to us
[2:05:39] they say you know what don't disturb him
[2:05:41] you don't want to embarrass him in front
[2:05:43] of the people you wait when we go back
[2:05:45] over there when we return the home then
[2:05:48] you ask him a question why were you
[2:05:50] talking like this in front of people
[2:05:52] everybody okay and the disciple came and
[2:05:55] said to him why speak you to them in
[2:05:58] water parables
[2:06:01] he answered and said to them because it
[2:06:04] is given to you to know the water
[2:06:07] Mysteries
[2:06:12] to know the water is a mystery a problem
[2:06:16] how many Mysteries there
[2:06:20] let me leave it alone to know the Water
[2:06:23] Mystery of the kingdom of water heaven
[2:06:26] but to them it is not water so to know
[2:06:30] the mystery
[2:06:32] you must have something in you
[2:06:36] for you to know the mystery in other
[2:06:39] words you must have a mystery decoder
[2:06:44] that no matter how God is speaking
[2:06:47] somebody in you is interpreting whatever
[2:06:51] God is speaking to your own language to
[2:06:55] your own understanding any sad teacher
[2:07:00] [Applause]
[2:07:02] everybody okay
[2:07:06] can I continue
[2:07:08] verse 12 for whosoever has to him shall
[2:07:12] be what given and he shall have more
[2:07:15] abundantly but whoever has not from him
[2:07:18] shall be taken away even what he had
[2:07:20] listen carefully therefore everybody
[2:07:23] okay speak I to them in water because
[2:07:27] what they say
[2:07:30] they
[2:07:30] sing see not the first verb is to see
[2:07:38] how do you see
[2:07:40] in other words they are looking like
[2:07:42] this
[2:07:43] but they don't see it doesn't mean they
[2:07:46] are blind
[2:07:50] everybody okay
[2:07:51] everybody okay this seeing see not and
[2:07:56] doing water hearing and they're here no
[2:08:00] there is two verb there
[2:08:02] one is to see another one is water here
[2:08:06] here and the gospel uses these two
[2:08:08] things
[2:08:10] the gospel come not in word only healing
[2:08:15] but in demonstration seeing
[2:08:18] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:08:21] everybody good today seeing see not and
[2:08:26] hearing the hill not needed to the water
[2:08:29] understand there is a third thing
[2:08:32] understand
[2:08:37] glory to God what does it mean brother
[2:08:40] Stephen
[2:08:42] the first verse is see the second is
[2:08:45] here by the third is water
[2:08:48] you can see
[2:08:50] but you don't see you can hear but you
[2:08:53] really don't hear
[2:08:55] but even if you see and hear do you
[2:08:58] really understand
[2:09:01] everybody okay let's see what is going
[2:09:03] on first now uh 14 and in them is
[2:09:08] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which
[2:09:10] says by hearing you shall do what here
[2:09:14] and you shall not wow understand
[2:09:20] you can hear the sound you can hear the
[2:09:24] word but you don't understand what is
[2:09:27] really going on
[2:09:30] let's continue verse 14 they shall not
[2:09:34] understand and seeing you shall see and
[2:09:36] shall not water perceived so
[2:09:39] understanding and perception
[2:09:43] goes together
[2:09:46] everybody okay everybody okay seeing you
[2:09:51] must perceive hearing you must
[2:09:53] understand the seeing the understanding
[2:09:57] and the perception must be coupled
[2:09:59] together
[2:10:00] you ready now
[2:10:01] verse 15. for these peoples what the
[2:10:05] heart
[2:10:07] if you notice the Bible started with the
[2:10:11] eyes
[2:10:13] amen and the Bible moved from the eyes
[2:10:16] to the
[2:10:17] now the Bible is not touching the eye
[2:10:20] nor the ears but it's touching the water
[2:10:23] I thought the heart was a pump
[2:10:26] that pump blood
[2:10:29] what does the heart have to do with
[2:10:32] seeing and water
[2:10:34] because our hearing goes to our brain
[2:10:39] there is uh uh uh I mean a Nerf
[2:10:42] the 12 cranial nerve our sin goes there
[2:10:46] with the optic nerve so here what is
[2:10:49] this what is going on in here
[2:10:53] but brother Branham we already went
[2:10:54] through this explain to us that in the
[2:10:57] heart is the occupation of the Soul
[2:11:01] we already know that and inside the soul
[2:11:04] we see that there is a water
[2:11:07] thank you we okay now we okay
[2:11:11] he says verse 15 for this people's heart
[2:11:14] is what goes and their ears are dull of
[2:11:16] water hearing and the eyes they have
[2:11:19] done what clothes less at any time
[2:11:22] watch carefully they should water see
[2:11:25] with the water ice and water here with
[2:11:29] the water here and should what
[2:11:31] understand with that oh stop that
[2:11:34] understanding is where
[2:11:36] how does the heart understand
[2:11:40] who is understanding in the heart
[2:11:43] it is the seed that is in the soul the
[2:11:48] real you
[2:11:49] that was before the foundation of the
[2:11:52] Lord the word need to understand because
[2:11:56] the gospel is a trumpet when he sound

[2:59:37] sexual conception and absolutely could
[2:59:40] not live forever
[2:59:43] everybody
[2:59:45] you can get that one at home you ready a
[2:59:48] hybrid was such a horrible thing in the
[2:59:51] Old Testament he said a water that's the
[2:59:54] child shall not enter the congregation
[2:59:56] of the Lord for turning the generation
[2:59:57] there is nothing to breathe him out only
[3:00:01] that sin think 10th Generation 400 years
[3:00:04] before in a religion and an illegitimate
[3:00:07] child could ever come into the kingdom
[3:00:10] of God there was no Syria no water no
[3:00:14] serum for to take care of it he had to
[3:00:18] just breathe it out through the water
[3:00:20] but today since the blood of who Jesus
[3:00:24] Christ has been said you have been how
[3:00:28] by all different kind of water and the

[3:01:14] that was the woman that let another man
[3:01:17] uh live with her in order to bring forth
[3:01:20] a child that was a water hybrid that was
[3:01:24] sorry for before God and it took how
[3:01:26] many generations to ever breathe that
[3:01:29] out again before God paragraph 41.

[3:08:44] the serum
[3:08:46] was brought down
[3:08:48] and that made the difference
[3:08:53] father even under the old Covenant
[3:08:56] we can see how Grace
[3:08:58] [Music]
[3:09:00] overshadow the law
[3:09:02] and went through and was pulling
[3:09:05] predestinated seed out

[3:09:24] [Music]
[3:09:27] before his death
[3:09:29] he showed where he came from
[3:09:31] [Music]
[3:09:32] and you told him that's you
[3:09:35] and him
[3:09:37] will be together in Paradise
[3:09:40] the same place
[3:09:42] that's Samuel
[3:09:43] and soulmate
[3:09:45] that David met his son that he so
[3:09:49] desired
[3:09:54] how can we comprehend Grace
[3:09:58] it is beyond our thinking
[3:10:01] it is beyond our imagination
[3:10:04] to think that we are the seed of Grace
[3:10:08] and you can offer Shadow Overlook the
[3:10:11] law

[3:10:56] we feel sad
[3:10:58] because that person is sad
[3:11:00] that predestinated say the sad and it's
[3:11:04] a Godly sorrow because it only comes to
[3:11:07] bring us back to repentance so that we
[3:11:10] can repent quickly and feel again Lord
[3:11:13] that warmth love
[3:11:15] that Joy of Salvation coming back again
[3:11:19] no wonder David didn't ask back for the
[3:11:21] Salvation but he asked for the joy of
[3:11:24] Salvation because he knew by Covenant
[3:11:27] we are sealed into you
[3:11:29] we are God
[3:11:31] we are eternal
[3:11:34] father thank you for the blood that you

[3:11:47] the way they grew up the places they
[3:11:50] were born

[3:11:58] were just babies they have to go to
[3:12:00] different parents where they traumatize
[3:12:03] them where they abuse them where they
