[38:49] amen amen
[38:58] God bless your Saints I just have a
[39:01] testimony before the song I'll try and
[39:03] make it short but Saturday after the
[39:05] meeting I when I went home I was getting
[39:08] ready for bed
[39:10] and I started to get this sharp pain on
[39:14] my right hip
[39:15] I was like Lord I am too young for
[39:17] arthritis so what is this pain and
[39:22] I said you know what pain has come
[39:24] before and has gone so I placed some
[39:27] patches on my hip to try and see if
[39:30] that'll ease it and I just prayed and I
[39:32] went to bed and
[39:34] I woke up Sunday morning and
[39:37] I was completely immobilized I could not
[39:40] move and I was like Lord help me Jesus
[39:43] and I started praying
[39:45] and I fell back asleep
[39:48] and I dreamed I called the pasta and I
[39:51] told him everything that's going on with
[39:52] me and he prayed with me
[39:54] and in my dream I'm thinking that this
[39:57] is real and I'm up and about and I'm
[39:59] walking not to realize I woke up and I'm
[40:02] still in bed and I can't move
[40:04] so I said Lord I need a touch I really
[40:07] need a touch I'm not going in any ER I
[40:10] know prayer works so I was in two minds
[40:13] I'm like brother Steven's getting ready
[40:15] for his so man I can't call the pasta
[40:17] and talk to him no so I said I'll just
[40:20] send him a text and I said I need help
[40:23] and
[40:24] I just want to see God move and work for
[40:28] me I came to church
[40:31] it was hard getting ready because I was
[40:33] like Lord I'ma take on that uh
[40:36] attitude like John Ryan and thank you
[40:39] Lord for healing me and that's what I I
[40:41] did to try and get ready for church and
[40:43] I came and I was in so much pain I heard
[40:46] brother John pray for brother Mike who
[40:50] got pain in his knee and I'm standing
[40:51] there I'm like Lord if they only know I
[40:54] can't move
[40:55] so I said Jesus I just need your touch
[40:59] and
[41:01] when I got home
[41:03] actually we went to visit sister coast
[41:05] and she was testifying with me that she
[41:07] was in the same pain as I was probably
[41:09] around the same time and I was like look
[41:12] at the enemy trying to attack us
[41:14] right
[41:15] and today I could jump and Skip and move
[41:19] and there is not a memory of the pain in

[58:12] we don't have to do anything Lord
[58:13] because you gave us an unconditional
[58:16] Covenant Lord by two unmutable things
[58:20] that you cannot lie and you swore by
[58:23] yourself and you say I Will Bless
[58:25] Abraham and not only Abraham but also he
[58:29] sit after him Lord we are we have here
[58:33] the sons of Ibraham we have the
[58:35] daughters of Ibrahim some of them are
[58:37] pinned down by sickness some of them
[58:40] have been down lower by the Demons of
[58:42] laodicia by things that fly around
[58:44] father we are asking for your blessing
[58:46] Lord we are asking for your healing
[58:48] touch we're asking for your power for
[58:51] father we know that if you are here
[58:53] wearing this suit standing here tonight
[58:55] you would not heal anyone you say I
[58:58] always healed you already only believe
[59:01] we thank you Father for we ask believing
[59:04] and we know who receive for if we ask
[59:07] anything in your name believing we know
[59:10] that we will receive from you we thank
[59:12] you Father we commit now the
[59:14] ministration of your word into your
[59:15] hands are father knowing that father
[59:17] this is the most sacred Tower Lord for
[59:20] there is no other highest form that you
[59:23] can speak to man than outside of this
[59:25] poor Peter and you come father and you
[59:28] are the power of your anointing and Lord
[59:30] Minister your words your bride we thank
[59:33] you tonight Lord we are just eunuchs
[59:35] there is nothing for for us to give your
[59:38] children but come Lord and break the
[59:40] bread of life we thank you for this
[59:42] church we thank you for brother Stephen
[59:44] we thank you for the elders in Jesus
[59:47] Christ name we pray amen
[59:49] God bless you friends
[59:51] you may have your seats thank you so
[59:53] much musicians we we enjoy the ministry
[59:57] of musicians
[59:59] when when children are hungry they eat
[1:00:01] from from the dustbins
[1:00:03] if musicians don't sing people might
[1:00:06] find inappropriate music
[1:00:09] but if the musicians are on the Apostles
[1:00:11] of Duty then there is no excuse to fit
[1:00:15] somewhere else
[1:00:17] amen because there is bread there is
[1:00:20] gifts in the body of Christ
[1:00:22] and I wish I was a singer but I'm not a
[1:00:25] sick because a musician can use three
[1:00:29] minutes things that I'll preach for
[1:00:31] three hours
[1:00:32] Aina and when we get on the other side I
[1:00:37] don't know
[1:00:38] maybe that's a question for brother
[1:00:40] Stephen
[1:00:41] maybe my job will expire on the other
[1:00:44] side of New Jerusalem but the musicians
[1:00:47] will still be singing
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:51] there's a permanent contract
[1:00:57] some of us you know we are hourly
[1:00:59] workers
[1:01:00] you know we come and we go but musicians
[1:01:04] and they don't have a requirement you
[1:01:06] know they're just they're just getting
[1:01:07] the spirit and they sing
[1:01:09] so we we appreciate a lot from musicians
[1:01:12] I know the devil likes to attack them
[1:01:14] because it's jealous but but we pray for
[1:01:16] them all the time
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:20] I I I bring greetings from my wife I
[1:01:23] think she is in the back with the with
[1:01:26] the child I'm so I'm sure you're sorry
[1:01:28] running around the church
[1:01:31] no she doesn't do that everywhere but
[1:01:34] she felt at home so she was running
[1:01:36] around
[1:01:38] [Applause]
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:44] so
[1:01:46] I feel like I spent so much time in this
[1:01:48] church but I've got a quote for that
[1:01:55] you know brother Brigham used to spend a
[1:01:57] lot of time in brother's sister had his
[1:01:59] rights home you know because sister
[1:02:01] Haiti was the caliber of Elijah
[1:02:04] amen and the prophet says Elijah spent a
[1:02:08] lot of time with the weed of zeraphat
[1:02:10] because she was the caliber of Elijah
[1:02:15] Jezebel was not the caliber of Elijah
[1:02:18] but the weed of zaraphat was the caliber
[1:02:21] of Elijah amen so so Elijah does not
[1:02:25] hurt women
[1:02:27] you find many times in the Bible Elijah
[1:02:29] spending time with the shulamite woman
[1:02:31] but she spent time with the right
[1:02:33] caliber praise the Lord so when I'm here
[1:02:36] I am home and we love brother Stephen so
[1:02:38] much
[1:02:39] yeah we believe that is a real gift to
[1:02:42] the body of Christ if I can preach half
[1:02:44] of what he does I'm sure I'll be a
[1:02:46] tremendous let's say
[1:02:48] amen let's stand and read our Bibles
[1:02:52] otherwise you'll be here all night
[1:02:56] amen Let's uh read from Zechariah
[1:02:59] Chapter 9 verse 16. I love the book of
[1:03:03] Zechariah
[1:03:06] when I was young when I was in high
[1:03:09] school reading my Bible I used to like
[1:03:11] Zechariah because it was short
[1:03:14] he said when I was young
[1:03:18] I thought like ice long in German but at
[1:03:22] least the Zechariah is short you know
[1:03:25] but when I grew up I loved Isaiah I
[1:03:28] loved Ezekiel but I still like Zechariah
[1:03:30] too
[1:03:32] chapter 9 verse 16 the Bible says and
[1:03:35] the Lord their God
[1:03:37] shall save them in that day as the flock
[1:03:40] of his people yes
[1:03:42] for they shall be as stones of a crown
[1:03:46] lifted up as an end sign upon his land I
[1:03:50] mean an enzyme is a standard
[1:03:53] it's a it's a banner praise the Lord
[1:03:55] like in the Old Testament they they used
[1:03:58] to assemble in groups of four you know
[1:04:00] there was a standard of the North in the
[1:04:03] standard of the South and the East and
[1:04:04] the west and one was an ego the ox you
[1:04:07] know you know those things and that's an
[1:04:09] enzyme amen so he says I Shall Serve
[1:04:13] them for they shall be a stones of a
[1:04:15] crown you may have your seats
[1:04:19] praise the Lord so for for a short time
[1:04:21] today I try not to bring a very long
[1:04:23] inspiration because on a midweek service
[1:04:26] you might not have time to balance
[1:04:28] everything amen so we'll try to that's
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:34] being a traveling Minister you have to
[1:04:37] preach everything and finish
[1:04:39] but uh brother Stephen can tuck the
[1:04:41] breast and laugh a firm part one to part
[1:04:44] 15.
[1:04:47] [Laughter]
[1:04:51] so
[1:04:53] but then we are like you know flight
[1:04:55] attends and we just give you a few meals
[1:04:57] and then you go and then you enjoy your
[1:05:00] food at home
[1:05:03] so we prepare picked lunches
[1:05:05] so to say but here in Zechariah I love
[1:05:08] Zechariah because Zechariah the Bible
[1:05:10] says that when they were building the
[1:05:12] Temple they they prevailed through the
[1:05:15] pre to the prophet sign of Zechariah of
[1:05:18] haggai and all the different prophets
[1:05:20] and the Bible says says Israel trust in
[1:05:24] the Lord and you shall be established
[1:05:26] believe His prophets and you shall
[1:05:29] prosper amen if you believe God's
[1:05:32] Prophet that's where your blessing is
[1:05:36] you every nation that ever prospered was
[1:05:39] because they received God's prophets
[1:05:42] you talk about uh Germany is the most
[1:05:45] industrialized country in Europe the
[1:05:48] biggest economy in Europe because
[1:05:50] they're the Revival by Martin Luther
[1:05:52] King praise the Lord and not not Luther
[1:05:55] King but Martin Luther amen under
[1:05:57] justification and the prophet says
[1:06:00] civilization travels with the gospel
[1:06:03] amen you talk about England you are such
[1:06:06] a Powerhouse because it gave us many
[1:06:09] ministers like John Wesley like you know
[1:06:12] all these those good ones you know them
[1:06:13] you know saying Patrick and different
[1:06:15] ones and here in the United States we
[1:06:18] have had wonderful wonderful men of God
[1:06:21] so you see that Civilization and
[1:06:23] blessings they travel with the word of
[1:06:26] God
[1:06:27] amen and the reason why in Africa we
[1:06:30] were a little bit slower is because it
[1:06:32] took time for the gospel to really
[1:06:34] penetrate praise the Lord because
[1:06:36] civilization travels with the gospel
[1:06:40] that's what the prophet says amen so in
[1:06:44] Zechariah he sings that that they shall
[1:06:46] be as stones of a crown
[1:06:49] amen so God is talking about his people
[1:06:52] that they shall be as a stones of a
[1:06:55] crown now this is not just an ordinary
[1:06:58] crown this is the crown of my Lord Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ
[1:07:03] and if you know anything about clowns
[1:07:06] they don't put Granite stones in in in
[1:07:09] in in crowns they put diamonds they put
[1:07:14] rubies they put emeralds they put the
[1:07:17] most precious stones in crowns so that
[1:07:21] that the storm that will be in the crown
[1:07:24] of Jesus
[1:07:25] they are not cheap Stones it's precious
[1:07:28] strongs it's Diamond Stones
[1:07:32] and I am looking at some of them tonight
[1:07:36] Hallelujah
[1:07:37] praise be to God
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ is glorified by his people
[1:07:43] he is glorified with his people
[1:07:46] Hallelujah he says father glorify me
[1:07:50] with the glory that we had before the
[1:07:52] foundation of the world when Jesus
[1:07:55] Christ was glorified we were glorified
[1:07:57] with him we existed in him before the
[1:08:01] foundation of the world
[1:08:03] because there is only one form of
[1:08:06] eternal life if you are Eternal tonight
[1:08:09] you will always Eternal with God
[1:08:12] Hallelujah
[1:08:14] praise be to God
[1:08:18] you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:22] but you actually always had the Holy
[1:08:24] Ghost but you didn't know it
[1:08:28] you say brother Aaron
[1:08:30] what about me my brother how do I know I
[1:08:33] am the one
[1:08:34] if you are thinking like that then you
[1:08:37] are the one
[1:08:40] because if you are not the one you don't
[1:08:43] think like that
[1:08:45] Hallelujah
[1:08:46] praise be to God
[1:08:49] because Jesus Christ when he said one of
[1:08:52] who is going to betray me the elect were
[1:08:55] like Lord is its Niche is it me Lord is
[1:08:58] it me Lord but Judas was quiet
[1:09:02] Hallelujah
[1:09:05] if you are wondering Lord you have the
[1:09:08] Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:14] Hallelujah
[1:09:16] thank you
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:21] I don't want to get into the private
[1:09:24] interview with sister Bruce
[1:09:27] says brother from do I have the Holy
[1:09:29] Ghost
[1:09:30] and the prophet says yes you have the
[1:09:32] Holy Ghost
[1:09:33] [Applause]
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:38] sensation
[1:09:42] the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] the Holy Ghost is not a Time the Holy
[1:09:48] Ghost is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:54] praise be to God
[1:09:56] Hallelujah so they shall be as the
[1:10:00] stones of a crown
[1:10:01] lifted up as an as a standard
[1:10:05] in other words the Believers the other
[1:10:08] standard for their days
[1:10:10] we are not copying the world we are not
[1:10:13] copying the denominations but we
[1:10:15] understand that for the world we are the
[1:10:18] standard for the church
[1:10:21] hallelujah it's an Abomination for a Son
[1:10:25] of God to be following the world for a
[1:10:28] Son of God to be following the more
[1:10:30] abides and repairing site and the
[1:10:31] e-fights a Son of God is a standard
[1:10:37] oh praise be to God
[1:10:41] says Timothy let no man despise thy
[1:10:45] youth but be thou a standard
[1:10:48] of the Believers
[1:10:51] not a standard to the Believers of the
[1:10:55] Believers
[1:10:57] what it means is that you are
[1:10:59] representing the Believers if people see
[1:11:03] you out there they see spoken word
[1:11:05] Tabernacle when you are talking they see
[1:11:07] spoken word up and Echo there's this
[1:11:10] words
[1:11:11] you are an example of the flock
[1:11:15] Hallelujah
[1:11:18] lift up the standards lift up the
[1:11:21] standard what is your standard tonight
[1:11:23] it's Jesus Christ
[1:11:26] because every remember when they were
[1:11:28] camping
[1:11:30] each one had to have a standard
[1:11:33] amen and our standard is the ego because
[1:11:36] we have received the ego message
[1:11:39] Hallelujah we fly above
[1:11:43] we fly above the world we fly above
[1:11:46] America because we have received the
[1:11:48] anointing of an eagle
[1:11:52] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] that's the standard that we have
[1:11:57] received in this age
[1:11:59] I have no power to correct what the
[1:12:02] prophets gave
[1:12:03] I have no qualification to correct what
[1:12:06] Elijah gave her my duties to give you
[1:12:10] the standard
[1:12:11] and the standard is perfect
[1:12:15] if if you are a police officer
[1:12:18] it's not your duty
[1:12:20] to decide whether the law is right or
[1:12:22] not
[1:12:23] if you're a police officer your duty is
[1:12:27] to apply the law
[1:12:28] stop your over speeding
[1:12:31] the court says this that's what the
[1:12:33] ministry does we are not there to try
[1:12:36] Congress sets the laws
[1:12:38] we just give you what it means
[1:12:41] praise the be to God
[1:12:43] Hallelujah
[1:12:45] so God says here he says the prophet
[1:12:48] says right in the presence of this of
[1:12:50] his being tonight in his sight we are
[1:12:53] already glorified
[1:12:55] those who he justifies yes past tense
[1:12:59] glorified and what makes you a Christian
[1:13:02] is because Lord you and long for that
[1:13:04] perfect is because the Perfection is
[1:13:07] laying right out there
[1:13:09] that had a glorified body
[1:13:12] Hallelujah so so God wanted to make
[1:13:16] Jewels for himself
[1:13:19] and this Jew house he is picking them up
[1:13:23] but he is not picking them up and
[1:13:26] transforming them to be Jewels they are
[1:13:29] already Jews
[1:13:30] he is only checking what is not too well
[1:13:33] out
[1:13:34] Hallelujah
[1:13:36] praise be to God
[1:13:40] is only taking what is not the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost in shoe
[1:13:44] that's what he's simply doing
[1:13:46] whatever is not the word that's what is
[1:13:49] taking out
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:54] Revelations 21 verse 14 the Bible says
[1:13:57] and the war of the city had 12
[1:13:59] foundations
[1:14:00] and in them the names of the Apostles of
[1:14:03] the lamp
[1:14:05] amen people say you worship a man what
[1:14:09] about this verse
[1:14:10] it didn't say the names of of Jesus
[1:14:13] Christ says the names of the Apostles of
[1:14:16] the Lamb so you have to give respect
[1:14:18] where respect is true
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:22] and he that talked with me had a golden
[1:14:25] Reed
[1:14:26] Sunday School gold represents
[1:14:30] amen God bless you
[1:14:33] Amen to measure the city so the city is
[1:14:37] not measured by a theologian
[1:14:39] it's not measured by a seminary it's
[1:14:43] measured by a golden Reed by God himself
[1:14:47] by Divine vindication
[1:14:51] Hallelujah
[1:14:52] I believe that through God we have a
[1:14:56] perfect interpretation of the Bible by
[1:14:59] Divine vindication
[1:15:02] amen says Intercity and the gates and
[1:15:05] the wars thereof
[1:15:07] amen I'm building a foundation amen so
[1:15:11] there's a city they are Gates and they
[1:15:14] are Wars
[1:15:15] a perfect type of the restoration of
[1:15:18] Israel
[1:15:19] there was Ezra there was Nehemiah and
[1:15:22] there was a rubber Bell amen remember
[1:15:25] there were three decrees
[1:15:27] amen at a sexist Cyrus and the other one
[1:15:31] amen and the prophet when he's preaching
[1:15:33] the 70 weeks he specifies the the the
[1:15:36] decree
[1:15:38] from where we count the 70 weeks because
[1:15:41] they are three of them Hallelujah so it
[1:15:44] takes a prophet to tell you where you
[1:15:47] are and where you are going
[1:15:49] Hallelujah if you are lost
[1:15:52] and I give you a map you can't find home
[1:15:55] until someone tells you where you are on
[1:15:59] the map
[1:16:00] if you go to the mall
[1:16:03] if there's a more there's a map here is
[1:16:05] not strong here is where you find food
[1:16:07] here is where you you have this shop
[1:16:10] this is where you find and the map will
[1:16:12] be there and there will be a sign that
[1:16:14] says you are here
[1:16:17] so the prophet he tells you sure she
[1:16:21] and then we start from there
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:26] you cannot interpret a dream before you
[1:16:29] see the Dream First
[1:16:31] Hallelujah so the prophet is to say the
[1:16:34] dream first and he says
[1:16:36] and they say from here you're going
[1:16:39] there
[1:16:40] Hallelujah
[1:16:44] so so there are three degrees there is
[1:16:47] Ezra there is
[1:16:50] a prince from the tribe of Judah amen
[1:16:54] representing the king amen part of this
[1:16:58] restoration and Ezra reveals the temple
[1:17:02] and he brings worship representing the
[1:17:05] Levites and then you have if Nehemiah
[1:17:08] was with the governors so it should a
[1:17:10] perfect restoration under Malachi 4 you
[1:17:14] cannot ignore the five-fold ministry
[1:17:16] because they are part of the restoration
[1:17:19] of worship
[1:17:22] Hallelujah
[1:17:26] you need zaruba Bell you need Ezra
[1:17:30] Nehemiah you need all of them
[1:17:33] Hallelujah so now this this Temple it
[1:17:38] represents the bride because the Bible
[1:17:41] says I saw it comes from heaven like a
[1:17:43] pride
[1:17:45] and the prophet takes his time to preach
[1:17:47] about it in future home
[1:17:49] and this Jerusalem was built by stones
[1:17:55] and the stones are not just ordinary
[1:17:57] stones the Bible talks about the
[1:18:01] precious stones
[1:18:02] that built the New Jerusalem
[1:18:05] I mean it and it names them I'll I'll
[1:18:07] read them you know in a little while
[1:18:10] these stones are representing the
[1:18:13] Believers
[1:18:14] because every believer is a stoner in
[1:18:17] the kingdom of heaven and Everest every
[1:18:20] stone has to fit its place
[1:18:24] Hallelujah and every stone is different
[1:18:28] some stones are green
[1:18:31] some stones are diamonds some stones are
[1:18:34] arubis some are blue some are shallow
[1:18:37] but they are all precious stones
[1:18:41] some are preachers some are singers are
[1:18:44] some are deacons are but they are all
[1:18:46] sons of God
[1:18:50] Hallelujah
[1:18:53] and the value of the Stone
[1:18:56] does not come from its quantity
[1:18:59] it comes from its character
[1:19:02] Hallelujah because God does not count
[1:19:06] his people he weighs them
[1:19:09] he waste them that's what the prophet
[1:19:11] says he said built a chance that you
[1:19:14] have been you have been waiting the
[1:19:16] balance and you have been found one
[1:19:19] thing
[1:19:20] hey man Hallelujah so diamonds you don't
[1:19:24] say my ring is Four Diamonds no you say
[1:19:27] it's 18 carats it's sick it's 16 carats
[1:19:32] that's the value of a diamond
[1:19:37] you don't say well I belong to this
[1:19:39] church I belong to that church as you a
[1:19:41] Christian
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:43] 18 carats
[1:19:45] 21 carats
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:51] and the prophet says
[1:19:54] must one dollar
[1:19:55] and lot was 20 cents
[1:20:00] don't look down on Lots
[1:20:02] he's a brother but he's 20 cents
[1:20:06] how many cars are you tonight I believe
[1:20:09] I'm talking to hundreds carrots tonight
[1:20:14] raise me to God
[1:20:16] so God does not count his people
[1:20:19] you waste them
[1:20:21] because God said to Abraham if I find
[1:20:23] ten
[1:20:24] that I can wave I won't destroy sorrow
[1:20:29] God said if I can find 10 righteous
[1:20:33] people I won't destroy Sodom because the
[1:20:37] weight of 10 righteous people
[1:20:40] can can overshadow the wickedness of
[1:20:43] Sodom
[1:20:46] the weight of one belief in a family can
[1:20:49] overshadow the sins of the whole family
[1:20:53] the weight of one believer in the
[1:20:55] company can stop a company from
[1:20:57] collapsing
[1:21:02] one name Joseph sustained each Egypt a
[1:21:06] superpower
[1:21:08] oh come on Church
[1:21:11] it takes one person
[1:21:14] for God to bring an innovation
[1:21:17] he doesn't want 10 people he wants one
[1:21:20] man with a Crooked Stick where are you
[1:21:22] going Moshe sir I'm going to take over
[1:21:24] I'm going to take over because it's
[1:21:27] about the weight not the number
[1:21:32] Hallelujah
[1:21:34] but the world is about numbers oh I've
[1:21:37] got 15 000 likes so what
[1:21:41] amen I've got 8 000 followers saw what

[1:21:48] you know my Instagram post I got anyone
[1:21:52] likes
[1:21:53] so what
[1:21:55] God looks at the weight
[1:21:57] not the number
[1:22:00] one time he said to the prophet you are
[1:22:03] walking with too many people for me to
[1:22:05] work with you
[1:22:08] anyway let me not go there
[1:22:12] hey man

[1:22:34] driving
[1:22:37] you don't look at the suit that is
[1:22:40] wearing
[1:22:41] should look at his character
[1:22:44] you look at your character
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:50] so God when he's making these shoes
[1:22:54] these are made by pressure
[1:22:58] oh come on Friends what makes a diamond
[1:23:02] it's pressure
[1:23:04] what makes a diamond is Trials are is
[1:23:07] sickness oh come on Friends

[1:24:33] don't devalue yourself
[1:24:35] say I'm a diamond and I'll dwell with a
[1:24:38] diamond
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:45] have you ever seen an eagle marrying a
[1:24:47] buzzard
[1:24:49] or a person
[1:24:51] no sir Eagles merry Eagles diamonds
[1:24:55] dwell with diamonds are Angelic beings
[1:24:57] associated with one another
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:04] hey man the prophet says just as
[1:25:06] Solomon's Temple was cut out of all the
[1:25:07] world one block was cut this way and one
[1:25:11] was cut that way remember we are cut
[1:25:14] different
[1:25:15] one is a teacher one is an evangelist
[1:25:18] this one is a pastor one is this but we
[1:25:22] are all making once one building
[1:25:25] the house of God
[1:25:27] don't expect everyone to be like you
[1:25:30] don't expect everyone to be like you
[1:25:34] neither should you try to become like
[1:25:36] everyone be yourself
[1:25:39] God catch you like that don't betray
[1:25:42] yourself be yourself
[1:25:46] brother Brown says I hate to see people
[1:25:48] disfigure themselves
[1:25:50] trying to be what they ain't
[1:25:52] that's what the prophet says
[1:25:54] laughs
[1:25:59] Hallelujah be yourself
[1:26:01] God made me an African I'm a happy
[1:26:03] African
[1:26:05] Oh Glory
[1:26:07] [Applause]

[1:26:14] some people feel like you know I'll say
[1:26:15] I Mrs preacher you have to be going out
[1:26:17] hunting not all of us you have to go out
[1:26:19] hunting
[1:26:21] unfortunately there's no scripture for
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:25] all of us have to believe the word
[1:26:28] because I have seen them with
[1:26:31] Mr guns and they still breaks light I've
[1:26:34] seen them it's all about hunting and
[1:26:37] having guns it's about following the
[1:26:39] words
[1:26:40] say oh brother I've got this I've got
[1:26:42] this you know I you know it's not about
[1:26:44] that the spirit of Elijah is not to
[1:26:48] impersonate Elijah is to become like him
[1:26:51] in the spirit
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:55] hey man
[1:26:56] Revelation 21 says and the 12 gates
[1:26:59] there were 12 pearls every several gate
[1:27:02] was of one pile and the street and the
[1:27:06] streets of the city was pure gold as it
[1:27:08] was transparent gold
[1:27:10] so these these were made of pearls amen
[1:27:14] the prophet saying that these thoughts
[1:27:16] they came from different places when
[1:27:18] they were building the Temple of Solomon
[1:27:20] and there was a song that sister meet I
[1:27:22] used to sing they come from the East and
[1:27:25] West they come from the land of far amen
[1:27:28] like some of you here remember when the
[1:27:31] prophet was preaching the future home he
[1:27:33] says the size of the city is like from
[1:27:35] Georgia to Maine just like people
[1:27:38] represented Jesus
[1:27:40] Hallelujah
[1:27:42] some came from the Congo some came from
[1:27:45] Greece some come from the Irish but they
[1:27:48] are all making one house of God
[1:27:51] thank you
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:54] amen that's what makes spells it's
[1:27:58] pressure
[1:27:59] if you take wood
[1:28:01] just take it to a certain temperature
[1:28:03] and then you know that's it you take a
[1:28:06] granite Stone just put it you know in a
[1:28:09] certain just a little pressure it falls
[1:28:11] apart but you take a diamond
[1:28:16] you know like for example there's a
[1:28:18] metal called titanium just to give you
[1:28:20] context that's what they use to make the
[1:28:23] engines of the airplane
[1:28:24] it can fly for 24 hours it will never
[1:28:28] overheat because of the current of that
[1:28:31] metal
[1:28:32] amen so God is not interested in just
[1:28:35] picking all stones
[1:28:38] he wants believers who can stand firm in
[1:28:41] the face of trials in the face of
[1:28:44] sickness in this in the face of of of of
[1:28:47] smoking
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:51] if you read Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:28:54] oh my
[1:28:56] God the Bible says by faith they were
[1:28:59] Sona Sanda he didn't say they were so
[1:29:01] understand that because they didn't have
[1:29:02] faith it says by faith
[1:29:07] Hallelujah by faith they were fed to
[1:29:11] lions by faith
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:14] that's what makes it a masterpiece
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:19] but in laodicia we think
[1:29:23] faith is living in Wonderland
[1:29:26] no sir when you don't have money and you
[1:29:30] still come to church by faith
[1:29:33] when your house is upside down and you
[1:29:36] still come to church that's faith when
[1:29:38] you lose your job when you come to
[1:29:40] church that's safe
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:44] when you walk for five miles to come to
[1:29:46] church that's right
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:50] that's the faith that was once delivered
[1:29:52] to the Saints
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] but in laudishia
[1:29:59] it's a twisted Faith something is wrong
[1:30:02] they think faith is everything is
[1:30:04] perfect really there's no such thing as
[1:30:06] that God if you there is I'll tell you
[1:30:09] it's not Bible
[1:30:11] amen it's not Bible
[1:30:14] everyone has a cross
[1:30:16] we all come through there's some some
[1:30:18] through the flood some through the fire
[1:30:20] but all through the blood
[1:30:22] God brings his children along
[1:30:25] when tires come in your life
[1:30:27] don't say oh I wish I was like brother
[1:30:29] Aaron you don't know what I'm going
[1:30:30] through
[1:30:31] should have no idea what I'm going
[1:30:33] through
[1:30:35] if we're to exchange trials you say I
[1:30:38] think I'm good I think I'm good
[1:30:43] Hallelujah
[1:30:49] sometimes you see a Mr coming up here
[1:30:51] you say oh they've got all everything
[1:30:52] all together you don't know the battles
[1:30:55] that they fight you don't know the
[1:30:56] sleepless nights the prayers the concern
[1:31:00] for the flock you don't know all the
[1:31:02] struggles that you are struggling
[1:31:05] if you have children you know what I'm
[1:31:07] talking about if you have five children
[1:31:10] that's five blessings but they also come
[1:31:13] with five problems because every time
[1:31:15] you are worried it's my childhood
[1:31:18] growing well is he loving the Lord does
[1:31:21] he understand the Bible that's what
[1:31:23] keeps you awake at night and if you are
[1:31:26] a pastor it keeps you awake at night
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] Exodus chapter 28 verse 10.
[1:31:35] six of their names on one stone
[1:31:38] and the other six names on the rest of
[1:31:41] other Stone according to their birth

[1:31:47] are born a Jew

[1:31:52] the Jewish Community I'm now a Jew no

[1:31:58] a Jew for you to become a Jew
[1:32:00] I'm talking about natural juice
[1:32:03] and for you to be a Christian you have
[1:32:05] to be born a Christian you have to be
[1:32:07] born again there is no other way of
[1:32:09] becoming a Christian except by birth
[1:32:14] that's why a man was asked my friend how
[1:32:17] did you come in
[1:32:18] my mind you know my dad was hit the tap
[1:32:21] on Echo so what how did you come in
[1:32:24] I know my uncle used to went going
[1:32:26] hunting with the prophet no that's not
[1:32:28] what you're asking how did you come in
[1:32:31] [Applause]
[1:32:38] no that's not the question how did you
[1:32:41] come in
[1:32:42] they say bind his hand and foot and
[1:32:45] throw him away
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:48] you see some of these people the way
[1:32:50] they are blaspheming you can see that
[1:32:52] this one has been bound hand and foot by
[1:32:54] God himself
[1:32:57] six of them it says and the other six
[1:33:00] names
[1:33:01] according to their birth
[1:33:03] now the names are according to birth
[1:33:07] like the prophet saws about Ephraim
[1:33:10] the mother speaking the name in birth
[1:33:12] and the position of the place saying
[1:33:15] that's Child by birth and and Ephraim
[1:33:20] dwelt by the Sea because that's what his
[1:33:23] name was talking about like Judah means
[1:33:26] praise
[1:33:27] thou at whom thy Brethren shall praise
[1:33:30] that's why they were praising David so
[1:33:32] cute a thousand but David killed ten
[1:33:35] thousand they were praising David
[1:33:37] because of the name of Judah
[1:33:40] Hallelujah and so God was instructing
[1:33:44] these people to make an effort
[1:33:46] now they were they were there was one
[1:33:48] stone here and there was one stone there
[1:33:51] and these Stones there was there was
[1:33:53] something that was hanging here and it
[1:33:54] held the aroma from him now the arm of
[1:33:57] thermometer 12 Stones
[1:33:59] and on each of the stones were written
[1:34:02] the names of the tribe of Israel
[1:34:05] and there's two stones one on the left
[1:34:07] one on the right six and six just like
[1:34:10] the shoe bread there were six on the
[1:34:13] left and six on the right
[1:34:15] hallelujah praise be to God
[1:34:18] so so the glory of the efforts contained
[1:34:23] the names of the tribes of Israel
[1:34:25] in other words the glory of God you were
[1:34:28] already glorified with God
[1:34:31] God cannot be glorified without you you
[1:34:35] are part of the glory of God
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:41] Hallelujah
[1:34:44] praise be to God
[1:34:46] and these Stones I like them two of them
[1:34:49] were on the shoulders what is the
[1:34:51] strongest part of a man
[1:34:54] it is the shoulders
[1:34:55] and the prophet says he saw a picture of
[1:34:58] a man who broke the lamp and says he put
[1:35:00] it on his shoulders that's where Jesus
[1:35:02] Christ hears you you say oh brother I'm
[1:35:05] dying I'm going through trials I'm
[1:35:07] struggling you are on the shoulders of
[1:35:09] Jehovah
[1:35:11] just just in the process God knows
[1:35:15] exactly what he's doing
[1:35:20] if you go for a surgery
[1:35:22] and you are lying surgery you don't have
[1:35:24] to worry why are you taking these
[1:35:26] scissors why why are you doing why are
[1:35:28] you talking why are you doing that just
[1:35:30] rest and wait for the operation to
[1:35:32] finish and they say congratulations
[1:35:34] the surgery was successful
[1:35:37] one of these days Lord will say
[1:35:39] congratulations the surgery has been
[1:35:41] successful
[1:35:45] you might have scars you might have that
[1:35:48] that praise the Lord anyhow it's been
[1:35:50] successful
[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:52] some of you are gonna work with this
[1:35:54] class like Jacob but praise the Lord has
[1:35:57] been successful
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:01] some some of your tooth were too hard to
[1:36:04] pull
[1:36:05] and God had to do you know many
[1:36:07] interviews different methods
[1:36:10] sometimes God has to make you lose your
[1:36:12] job
[1:36:13] for the operation to be successful
[1:36:16] man if it means breaking you apart you
[1:36:19] will do that
[1:36:21] because he is not going to lose any
[1:36:24] he is not going to give up on any of his
[1:36:27] flock
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:31] and and these Stones the Bible says that
[1:36:33] they were they were engraved in gold
[1:36:36] and gold represents Christ now we are we
[1:36:40] are like you know the go forward that no
[1:36:42] head that the government is the weakest
[1:36:44] wood but you combine with the tide
[1:36:47] becomes the hardest Like a Rock so it's
[1:36:50] engraved in time and the devil does not
[1:36:54] you know he he can't walk against the
[1:36:56] top because that's crushed
[1:36:59] let me keep going
[1:37:01] oh my
[1:37:03] God Hosea chapter 5 verse chapter 6
[1:37:06] verse 5 therefore
[1:37:07] I have healed them by by the prophets
[1:37:11] now you cannot use a stone outside of
[1:37:13] the prophet
[1:37:15] that's why you've got so many rubbles
[1:37:16] out there so-called churches because it
[1:37:19] takes a real mercenary to heal the
[1:37:22] stones
[1:37:23] I have slain them by the words of my
[1:37:26] mouth
[1:37:27] by thy judgment for I desired Mercy not
[1:37:31] sacrifice so when God you
[1:37:35] he healed you from a rock
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:40] the prophet says in the end time
[1:37:41] evangelism what is what good is the
[1:37:43] stone if you haven't got a stone muscle
[1:37:45] to ship it out
[1:37:47] confession is Stones when Peter made his
[1:37:51] confession Jesus said thou asked Peter a
[1:37:54] little Stone
[1:37:55] so it's a compound meaning the
[1:37:58] Revelation is the rock but also Peter is
[1:38:01] a little Stone just like you and me we
[1:38:03] are little stones
[1:38:05] amen the stone that killed Goliath it
[1:38:10] was a special stone it was a
[1:38:12] predestinated stone and God knew the
[1:38:15] only thing that would destroy Goliath in
[1:38:17] this age is the stone of the message
[1:38:20] exactly predestinated for this hour
[1:38:29] Revelation chapter 21 verse 18. and the
[1:38:32] building of the war of it was of Jasper
[1:38:35] and the city was pure gold like unto
[1:38:38] clear glass and the foundation of the
[1:38:41] war of the city were garnished with all
[1:38:42] men of precious stones the First
[1:38:45] Foundation was Jasper the second
[1:38:47] Sapphire and chaldoni and fourth and
[1:38:50] emerald and the prophet you know we
[1:38:52] don't have time he says I'm not going to
[1:38:54] get into the colors of these Stones
[1:38:56] remember when when John saw him
[1:38:59] Revelation chapter 4 5 he said he was to
[1:39:01] look upon his Jasper and sudden and the
[1:39:04] prophet says it's Reuben and Benjamin in
[1:39:07] other words those what Jesus Christ was
[1:39:09] to look upon was actually the church
[1:39:13] and there was a rainbow
[1:39:16] amen and you know how they classify
[1:39:19] these Stones it's if you know some of
[1:39:22] them they produce rainbows and some of
[1:39:24] them they don't and these stones that
[1:39:26] make the New Jerusalem they say they all
[1:39:28] make rainbows so the rainbow actually
[1:39:31] comes from the stone
[1:39:32] so when when John saw Christ with the
[1:39:35] rainbow now there could not be a rainbow
[1:39:38] Covenant unless there was something that
[1:39:41] was lost
[1:39:42] so it was this stones that produced the
[1:39:45] rainbow
[1:39:46] I can prove that by the Bible if you go
[1:39:49] to the Old Testament the prophet says if
[1:39:51] a man in the dream you'd go before the
[1:39:53] urima from him and if the dream was true
[1:39:56] then it would bring the colors so these
[1:40:00] colors they come from the stones that
[1:40:03] are in the urim of tell him
[1:40:06] oh come on Church
[1:40:08] if you read Ezekiel chapter one
[1:40:11] it talks about the glory of God
[1:40:14] and the prophet talks about them but he
[1:40:16] talks about the Kara of emerald and
[1:40:18] amber light you know and there was the
[1:40:21] Bible says that there was you know
[1:40:23] living creatures and they they had
[1:40:26] wheels in the middle of a wheel and they
[1:40:28] had eyes all over and I like the verse
[1:40:31] that says and they tend not where they
[1:40:33] went
[1:40:35] you know it's like
[1:40:37] if I'm if I'm if I'm going this
[1:40:39] direction
[1:40:40] if I wanna go right I have to stop and
[1:40:42] turn
[1:40:43] but these ones because they've got
[1:40:45] wheels and they have eyes all over they
[1:40:48] don't turn they tend not where they go
[1:40:51] if they're going this way they are
[1:40:54] moving forward if they're going this way
[1:40:55] they are moving forward if they're going
[1:40:58] this way they are moving forward if you
[1:41:00] get sickness you are moving forward if
[1:41:02] you lose your job you're moving forward
[1:41:04] if your husband leaves you you are
[1:41:06] moving forward
[1:41:08] the prophet says they were representing
[1:41:10] the church
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:15] they don't stop
[1:41:16] because we are not of those that turn
[1:41:19] back we are moving forward
[1:41:21] God bless you my brother move forward
[1:41:26] you say brother Aaron my marriage is
[1:41:28] collapsing move forward
[1:41:30] my business is corrupted it's collapsing
[1:41:32] move forward come to church anyhow and
[1:41:36] praise God
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:43] he that takes hold of the plow and looks
[1:41:46] back is not worthy of the Kingdom
[1:41:51] what did what did what did Elijah say to
[1:41:54] Elijah says stay here Elijah says no I'm
[1:41:58] moving forward stay here no I'm moving
[1:42:00] forward
[1:42:02] and do you know who discouraged Elijah
[1:42:04] Elisha it was not the devil It Was
[1:42:07] Elijah
[1:42:09] what who who discouraged the sacral
[1:42:12] finishing woman
[1:42:13] it was not the devil it was God he was
[1:42:17] trying his seat
[1:42:19] Hallelujah
[1:42:22] he says it is not neat to take the
[1:42:25] children's bread and toss it to the dogs
[1:42:27] she didn't go to CNN
[1:42:30] and say oh there's this religious
[1:42:32] minister
[1:42:33] he called a colored woman a dog a
[1:42:36] breaking news
[1:42:38] she didn't say that
[1:42:40] she says yeah Lord I'm a dog
[1:42:42] yeah Lord I'm a talker oh come on
[1:42:45] Friends
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:50] I'll rather have the right Spirit the
[1:42:53] right Doctrine
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:59] because for you to have a right Spirit
[1:43:02] you have you need two things
[1:43:04] you need love and you need humility
[1:43:08] if you are humble and the word says dog
[1:43:11] you say yeah Lord whatever the word says
[1:43:14] about me that's what I am
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:18] she did not try to correct the words
[1:43:22] Peter tried to correct the words Jesus
[1:43:26] Christ says all of you are going to deny
[1:43:28] me you're going to leave me and Peter
[1:43:30] thoughts you are smart smarter than the
[1:43:32] word so it's not me Lord I'll go with
[1:43:34] you everywhere and Jesus Christ that is
[1:43:37] special issue
[1:43:38] foreign
[1:43:48] but if this rock falls upon you it will
[1:43:51] grind you to powder
[1:43:53] that's what the scripture says friends
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:57] amen
[1:44:00] Revelation chapter four part two of the
[1:44:02] prophecies they John stood and he's seen
[1:44:05] him sitting on the throne he was to look
[1:44:08] like Jasper and sardine amen now if you
[1:44:11] notice it Compares with the rest of the
[1:44:13] scripture he was Alpha and Omega
[1:44:15] amen it was all gathered in him
[1:44:19] that's why Paul says when Christ
[1:44:21] who is our life
[1:44:24] shall appear
[1:44:25] in other words we are part of Christ
[1:44:29] we cannot be lost any more than God can
[1:44:32] be lost
[1:44:36] it's impossible
[1:44:38] it's impossible
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:45] and the prophecies and just for the
[1:44:47] stone
[1:44:49] know how these things are
[1:44:54] came to Jesus he says can you keep put
[1:44:57] my son on my on the right on the left
[1:45:00] Jesus said I can't change that program
[1:45:03] I can't
[1:45:04] I can't change this program
[1:45:07] that's how deep this thing is
[1:45:09] you were not you did not become a
[1:45:11] Christian yesterday or last year or 10
[1:45:14] years ago you were a Christian before
[1:45:17] the foundation of the world
[1:45:21] and when you when you hear the word
[1:45:24] there is a process that is activated
[1:45:27] and it's an irreversible process
[1:45:31] because Ecclesiastes says
[1:45:34] better is the end of the thing that the
[1:45:36] beginning of which
[1:45:38] you may see a love for example Aaron I'm
[1:45:40] just a worm 200 at the end of the
[1:45:44] process you're gonna be a butterfly at
[1:45:47] the end of this process you are going to
[1:45:49] fly like a butterfly
[1:45:52] you see a worm but glass is a butterfly
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:01] see it says before says rabbi
[1:46:04] when did you know me
[1:46:06] before Philip called you
[1:46:08] before brother Aaron testified to issue
[1:46:11] before brother gave you the spoken word
[1:46:13] I saw you
[1:46:17] when Noah style me Rabbi before the
[1:46:20] foundation of the world and the prophet
[1:46:22] says I saw all some of you over there I
[1:46:26] saw some of you over there
[1:46:30] oh man says don't despise these little
[1:46:34] these little ones
[1:46:36] they're Angels that's the orphanage in
[1:46:39] heaven always behold the face of my
[1:46:41] father
[1:46:42] in other words we are already in heaven
[1:46:45] Ephesians chapter one
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] Hallelujah
[1:46:52] we are not under the influence of this
[1:46:54] world we are in this world but we are
[1:46:57] not of this world
[1:46:59] we are in laudesia but we are not of
[1:47:01] ladisha
[1:47:04] amen
[1:47:10] to whom coming as unto a living Stone
[1:47:14] disallow allowed indeed of man but
[1:47:17] chosen of God and precious when I say
[1:47:21] God bless you my precious brother
[1:47:24] I'm just a cliche or you know it's just
[1:47:27] a it's you it's a precious song
[1:47:32] and and to show you how precious this is
[1:47:35] it was purchased by the blood of God
[1:47:40] how much is the blood of God
[1:47:45] ji also
[1:47:47] it's Lively stones
[1:47:49] just think of if I go out and scratch a
[1:47:53] brother's car that he bought for maybe
[1:47:56] fifteen thousand dollars
[1:47:58] he'll be upset the whole week
[1:48:00] I mean not a brother but if any any
[1:48:02] person
[1:48:07] now
[1:48:08] but something that was purchased
[1:48:11] by the blood of God
[1:48:13] if I ask you to do evaluation and say
[1:48:15] can you value for me the blood of gods
[1:48:18] what value can you put
[1:48:22] it's in finite
[1:48:25] it's in finite
[1:48:28] God is willing to give it all for his
[1:48:30] children
[1:48:34] she also are Lively stones
[1:48:37] you are not dead stones you are Lively
[1:48:40] stones
[1:48:42] build up spiritual house
[1:48:44] a holy priesthood offering up spiritual
[1:48:48] sacrifices that's why we come to church
[1:48:51] sacrifices
[1:48:53] Hallelujah
[1:48:55] there is no religion without sacrifice
[1:48:58] that's why the prophet says a service is
[1:49:01] not complete without taking a love
[1:49:03] offering because sacrifice is part of
[1:49:06] worship
[1:49:09] you can't say I'm tired I don't want to
[1:49:11] go to church
[1:49:12] you don't know what what what worship is
[1:49:16] remember anything that is breath can
[1:49:19] praise the Lord
[1:49:21] but those that worship him they worship
[1:49:24] and speak and in truth
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:28] Hallelujah
[1:49:30] what is the what did God say to the
[1:49:33] prophets he says for you to bind this
[1:49:35] number
[1:49:36] you need to be more sincere you need to
[1:49:39] come to church more you need to pay your
[1:49:41] tithe on time for you to bind this man
[1:49:44] bear
[1:49:45] Hallelujah
[1:49:48] it's just when I came when I came out of
[1:49:51] the vision my finger was pointing on the
[1:49:53] scripture says not keeping this Feast
[1:49:56] with the old living
[1:49:58] and he says you know I live in bread
[1:50:01] he says it's fasting was that sincerity
[1:50:05] remember don't forget the Feast of
[1:50:07] unleavened bread
[1:50:09] yes it represents Christ but it's also
[1:50:12] represents a Believer because remember
[1:50:14] the twelve loves that was the 12 tribes
[1:50:16] of Israel that was Christ but that was
[1:50:19] also a shoe
[1:50:20] because God requires sincerity
[1:50:24] and one of the things that we have lost
[1:50:26] in this age
[1:50:27] is sincerity
[1:50:29] we have people that like to play games
[1:50:32] and do barbecue and you know but they
[1:50:35] are not sincere people
[1:50:37] the Holy Ghost will never work with the
[1:50:40] haves that are not sincere
[1:50:45] Hallelujah that's why when you read the
[1:50:48] Bible
[1:50:49] in the Book of Psalms says his Mercy
[1:50:52] endures forever
[1:50:55] Selah means stop pause think reflect
[1:51:01] don't just be saying I'm going to church
[1:51:03] I mean you know reseller stop
[1:51:07] [Applause]
[1:51:09] can I say something
[1:51:13] are you up to date with the sermon
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:26] God bless you friends
[1:51:29] all right prayer says
[1:51:32] he that overcome I will make him a
[1:51:35] pillar in the temple of my God
[1:51:37] he shall go no more out
[1:51:39] what is that if he's a pillar he ain't
[1:51:41] going out no more I'm gonna cross in a
[1:51:44] little bit he's the bride that's right
[1:51:47] in Ephesus Church age Paul taught them
[1:51:50] in Acts now wait a minute if you're
[1:51:52] going to be a pillar I had no scriptures
[1:51:54] down here I wanted to get to before we
[1:51:57] get to the bride so God is going to say
[1:51:59] he I'll make him a pillar
[1:52:02] you see you become a pill or you are
[1:52:05] established
[1:52:06] in the foundation of the prophets and
[1:52:09] the apostles
[1:52:11] you know just fluricking floating around
[1:52:14] you are established in the world
[1:52:19] you shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:52:23] rivers of Living Water and you bring
[1:52:25] fruit in your season
[1:52:28] and the prophet saying that you bring
[1:52:30] your foot in your own season in other
[1:52:32] words you're not bringing the food of
[1:52:34] Luther so are bringing the fruit that is
[1:52:38] meat for this time that we're living in
[1:52:44] now the time on the prophets was in
[1:52:46] South Africa one time and they took him
[1:52:48] took him to a diamond mine says he says
[1:52:51] when it comes for it's just a big smooth
[1:52:53] round like piece of glass it's a blue
[1:52:55] diamond Black Diamond emerald and clear
[1:52:57] diamond white diamonds then what what
[1:53:00] when it's made and put into use there is
[1:53:02] a part of the diamond has to lose
[1:53:05] it's a diamond to begin with
[1:53:07] but a part of it has to lose
[1:53:10] you were a Son of God to begin with so
[1:53:13] God is only chipping away what is not
[1:53:16] that diamond
[1:53:17] hey man he has to circumcise in the
[1:53:21] heart
[1:53:22] Hallelujah says I will write my my laws
[1:53:26] not upon Stone temp tables but upon the
[1:53:30] table of their hearts
[1:53:33] Hallelujah
[1:53:35] this is why the stones in the they were
[1:53:37] engraved the names were engraved and
[1:53:41] this is not a new phenomenon if you read
[1:53:43] Ezekiel chapter 9. there was an angel
[1:53:46] with the writer's income
[1:53:48] and he was told to go in the midst of
[1:53:50] the people
[1:53:51] and you are stood to mark
[1:53:53] amen
[1:53:55] and why we look at the symbols and the
[1:53:58] prophet says it represents the Holy
[1:53:59] Ghost
[1:54:00] he had a writer's income in other words
[1:54:03] if he was mocking he was writing
[1:54:05] something
[1:54:07] in symbols
[1:54:09] because when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:54:10] you are receiving something
[1:54:12] praise me to God
[1:54:14] and you read in Revelations that the 144
[1:54:18] 000 they had on their foreheads
[1:54:22] the name of the father and then that's
[1:54:24] the name of Jesus
[1:54:26] that's why when when Paul was
[1:54:28] persecuting the church
[1:54:30] Christ came down and says born so why
[1:54:33] are you persecuting me
[1:54:35] because the whole family in heaven on
[1:54:38] Earth of God is called Jesus
[1:54:41] in the realm of the spirits we don't see
[1:54:44] your name we see Jesus
[1:54:47] that's what is written on the forehead
[1:54:49] it's Jesus
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:56] people that are not properly taught
[1:54:59] they say oh there's a witchcraft in my
[1:55:01] family no
[1:55:03] name we see Jesus
[1:55:07] not a Christian there's a welcoming
[1:55:10] Spirit upon you there is a light on you
[1:55:13] so a Christian
[1:55:15] oh come on Friends
[1:55:17] you are not enough but there is a light
[1:55:19] in your life
[1:55:20] and the demons they see that light
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:31] when you marry a woman
[1:55:33] you have the power to change it you're
[1:55:35] saying them their last name when you are
[1:55:38] married to Jesus you change your name
[1:55:40] because I will give you a white stone
[1:55:43] and there is a name written on the stone
[1:55:45] that no one knows but sure
[1:55:48] [Applause]
[1:55:53] as I call you Mrs Jesus God bless you
[1:55:56] Mrs Jesus God be with you Mrs Jesus God
[1:56:00] loves you Mrs Jesus
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:05] Hallelujah
[1:56:07] don't worry about things don't get
[1:56:09] deceived by fear
[1:56:11] demons are actually afraid of you
[1:56:14] because the prophet says when the
[1:56:16] weakest player Saints begins to pray
[1:56:20] the Gates of Heaven Shake
[1:56:23] because you have the name of Jesus
[1:56:26] and you have to carry the name by
[1:56:28] revelation
[1:56:30] oh come on Friends
[1:56:32] because remember there are two seals
[1:56:35] there is the Sea of Christ and there's
[1:56:37] the Sea of the Antichrist
[1:56:46] and may we be ready for the Rapture or
[1:56:49] in the act of safety
[1:56:51] and you know the arcade three decks
[1:56:54] and the people they do it on the third
[1:56:56] deck that's where we are that's where
[1:56:59] the Prophet left us and on the third
[1:57:01] pool the opening of the world Amen but
[1:57:05] the the other animals they are only two
[1:57:07] Jacks of the Ark
[1:57:10] baptized in there
[1:57:12] he says up on the Upper Floor where we
[1:57:15] can see the light of the Gospel shining
[1:57:17] and punctuate Every Word Within
[1:57:23] bless them keep them I claim them for
[1:57:26] Jews of your crown Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:29] let's read Malachi chapter 3 verse 17.
[1:57:32] oh come on friends you are Jews in the
[1:57:35] crown of Christ nothing is going to harm

[1:58:04] that's my address
[1:58:08] forward them to my address
[1:58:12] and they shall be mine says the Lord
[1:58:15] in that day when I make my jewels
[1:58:18] and I'll spare them as a man's Spirit
[1:58:19] his own son that sereth me says in the
[1:58:23] day when I make my Jewels that's what
[1:58:26] God is doing he's making his jewels
[1:58:30] the prophets in broken systems he says
[1:58:32] now my last quote he says I thank thee
[1:58:36] father they are your jewels and I pray
[1:58:39] God that tonight that you manifest your
[1:58:42] way you you manage to face your way
[1:58:44] yourself in the way to make them that
[1:58:46] they have need of

[1:59:01] that the prophet was ministering to says

[1:59:41] the pyramid and there was a White Rock

[1:59:48] that only the prophet could interpret it
[1:59:51] says brother stay here and that pyramid
[1:59:54] remember the Capstone

[1:59:59] which is both a Capstone and a
