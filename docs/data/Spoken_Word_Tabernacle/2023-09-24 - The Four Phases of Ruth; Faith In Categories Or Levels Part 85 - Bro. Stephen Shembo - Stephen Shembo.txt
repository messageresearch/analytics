everybody is up to date with the sermon everybody are reading their Bible two chapters a day one in the morning one before you go to bed everybody are reading the Cod book some their Church ages some their seals some their 70 weeks of Daniel and somebody is listening to the message of the hour somehow so somehow I got everything covered if you're not in the seals you're in the trumpet if you're not in the trumpet you're on the Cod you're not on the Cod you're on the church agent you're not on the church agent somewhere you are in the world amen sister Teresa what a wonderful sir amen now you can't hide no more amen You Can't Hide no more wonderful wonderful wonderful he that's why you need to stay in tune now when you stay spiritual you line up exactly with the sermon that is coming up amen because we are not ashamed of the Gospel amen we're not even fighting against flesh and blood oh my God wonderful amen our question and answer will be on October the 21st Lord's willing I'm almost about to finish um the question so if you got some bring it up so we can continue to move on because it's helping a lot it's helping me study it's helping me dig on to stuff and as soon as we get there things begin to open up that I never even understand myself so it has been a tremendous blessing for everybody amen I receive a lot of uh announcements for uh meetings we got meetings on our sister Church a lot of them going left and right so it's going to be impossible for me to be announcing all of them here amen and it's going to be for those who will be following me online impossible for me to attend all of them so we'll try the best that we can so as soon as I got a meeting I will try to print it out give it to the Deacon so they can post it on the board there and if you got a chance always remember we are one Pebble on the beach we got brothers and sisters around and it's always a blessing if you can go ahead and back up the meeting amen but for me to be standing here and giving everything that I'm receiving we got about George we got blood Scouts me if we got brought the look and we got it's coming left and right it's I'm just gonna put it there so you know the announce boat board is there and you do as the Lord leads you amen amen any question remember your past always pick up the phone give me a call you know my number and I will clarify to you something amen glory to God by the grace of God we're going to get into a territory this morning and and uh whoever is not here who is uh following me or who will be following later try your best to get into this because I don't have any choice but we gotta turn the corner in other words there is no way if you hear you cannot still study this church would never put you comfortable as soon as you reach a certain level we push you back up again amen and sit as you get to that level you say thank God I'm there before you know it brother Stephen is pushing you back up again amen the end is the rapture when you get into the Rapture then we reach it but as long as we hear the Rapture is not here body will continue to push you back and for keep moving keep moving until we reach the destination amen so if you do not understand what I'm gonna get into it go home review slowly and read the scripture slowly because it's going to help everybody Where We Are depending on your level it will help you out and if you were a minister of the gospel and you ended up getting into this material make sure you look into it and you know my heart I'm not fighting against face and blood I'm fighting against demonic Spirit and the worst one is the religious spirit and usually it's hidden under doctrines and it's holding people hostage and spirit demonic Spirit has been hovering on people's life for years so when I'm moving I'm not against any camp or whatever because I don't even belong to any camp amen I'm inter-denominational in the message I'm not talking about outside in the message I'm into denomination in either way that you won't find me in any camper the only Camp you find me is the word of God so I'm free to deliver whatever the Lord put in my heart so if you don't understand this before you start fighting slow down listen correctly my way of speaking is direct I'm not a politician listen carefully because I have more than what I'm gonna pull up here so understand my heart but I have no choice I gotta deliver this message and I trust God will help me to reach where I'm trying to reach let's go to a scripture this morning Genesis 22. yeah there is no way I can see people in the bondage and keep my mouth shut thank you anyway if a Ministry can be destroyed by the word it needs to be destroyed if a Ministry can be destroyed by the World by the word that Ministry need to be destroyed because it automatically enter World amen the message is never complicated we twist and do this and this and this until we confuse the people that time is over amen Genesis 22. remember you don't get me please slow down please slow down don't get me wrong slow down please Genesis 22 verse 1. and he came to pass after these things that God detempt I'm reading the Bible it is not me watch out because somewhere they say God Don't Tempt people I'm just reading the Bible [Laughter] in other words God test God test or tempt Abraham and say to him Abraham not Abraham Abraham and he said behold here I am so the one who initiated the test is God you might be seated the one who initiated the test for job was God so if God start your test is that a problem because who started we can close here and just go home the one who started the test amen he is God himself just like he did for job and he comes Abraham was quiet amen this temptation is not for Abraham to drink whiskey the Temptation Of God it's not for you to fall down God was after something he was not tempting Abraham so Abraham can go commit something wrong or rob a bank that's not it [Laughter] verse 2 and he said if you were here on Wednesday you will understand how what was going on it was like a convention amen and he said take now your son which son your only son who Isaac specific so there is no more question you say okay maybe he was talking about Ishmael Isaac amen whom you love so not something you don't love [Music] because if you don't love it you give it up quickly amen whom you love and get you into the land of Moriah this is where the temple was built and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which I will tell you of the one who started this is God the one who came up with the project is God and the one who delivered instructions is God and a destruction is hard it's about going to worship God but wakanda worship you're going to worship God where God is asking you for something that is almost impossible for you to give up give out Isaac so I'm going to worship with my son amen thank you Jesus and Abraham rose up early in the morning and sadder Is Us and took Sarah thank you and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and split the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went to the place of which God has told him so maybe Sarah is looking at Abraham in the morning splitting wood he said oh okay maybe they're going with his son uh go ahead hang out with your father I'm fine so I can take a little break here didn't know what was going on verse 4 then on the third day Abraham lift up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said to his young men so at home he left Sarah have to stay home but when he reached a certain level he's looking at the mountain he looked at the two guys he say this is as far as you can go you stay here so everybody is staying according to their faith Have I Lost somebody Have I Lost somebody Sarah have to stay home Sarah cannot go there Sarah home amen as they move on they reach a point where they see more Moriah afarov the two servant have to stay there amen here amen but it's not the place yet then Abraham himself and Isaac but Isaac now is not Isaac Isaac is a sacrifice who indicated the sacrifice don't do me like this we're reading the Bible together so Abraham begin to move alone with his sacrifice Isaac amen amen verse 5 and Abraham said to this to his young man about you here you know that Moses did that when he was going up the mountain he reached a certain prayer he say only Joshua can go with me he reached a point he said you Josh are you stay here I'm gonna move on over there over there is when you see God face to face amen and Abraham said to his young man about you here with the US and I and the Lord will go up and will go Yonder and do what so they were going to worship with a test you worshiping God under a test God is giving you something and he's asking you something very high he's watching you but it's under worship he want to see what you're gonna do you will cling to that which you love or you're gonna give him the first place it's a test in the line of worship a test in the line of worship amen whether you're going to stay ready with him in the land of worship he says me and the Lord I and the Lord will go Yonder and do water and do what Karma and water thank you for reminding me my palate is not here praise God praise God praise God praise God go ahead my brother thank you amen he says and I and the Lord will go Yonder and do water that's not a problem everybody can believe that because they're going somewhere and we know the worship is one one comeback yeah you can worship what you want but one one come back but look at the problem Kama and daughter come again to you who told you they're gonna come again amen Abraham didn't say I am going to worship and I'm going to come back Abraham say me and my son we too we're going together but just know the same way you saw us going that's the same way you're gonna see us coming but what is going to happen there will take the life of Isaac who was talking here which Abraham is talking here because the normal Abraham knows that he's going to slay his son but another Abraham begin to talk amen amen so he got two Abraham we got the outside of Abraham and we got the inward the Abraham by the Andrew reminded you very well on Wednesday we got the inward Abraham amen when we reached this point and Abraham spoke and Abraham said I am going and I am coming back with the Sun in other words Abraham spoke about the resurrection everybody okay he spoke about the resurrection because what he was going to do there was to kill Isaac he was going to kill Isaac amen but he say me and Isaac we're coming back in other words somehow that I don't know God must raise this body [Applause] we okay we Okay we okay we good Isaac himself did not even understand what Abraham was saying this Abraham did not understand what Abraham was saying [Music] this Abraham did not understand what Abraham was saying maybe if you know they say now you're the way you know it now you would say poor Abraham he's just comforting himself amen it's word spoken during a painful time [Applause] did you get my message did you get my message so when you are squeezed when you under desperation when we were on a tight corner in a very difficult situation certain words come out of your mouth and they'll usually look impossible [Applause] it is word that usually comes in tight situation when you are desperate when we are done when you are finished may not know how when you are just giving up amen you would deliver a certain world word when the word comes up you yourself you yourself because this is in a hope mode but this one lays on a faith mode you will deliver a certain word in other words you are just delivering that to God like you know what you do what you want everybody good everybody good that's the first thing Abraham spoke amen let's go to verse six and Abraham took the wood of the burn offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and say my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire the boy is looking left and right he doesn't understand the equation here he said wait a minute here is the fire and the wood but are not the way we worship if we worship with you many times I seen you at home the way you worship but this kind of worship is strange Maybe daddy you missed something did we forget something so Isaac knew the order of worship amen [Applause] because Isaac saw his father the way he was worshiping we change the way you worship God your children are watching you if you don't pray at home your children knows and it's going to affect your children that's why brother Branham say it is not children delinquency but his parents delinquency if you train your child the correct way then somehow your child is watching you and when you begin to drift away from the word your child can even remind you back like Daddy you missing something this is Wednesday this is Sunday it's time to go to church amen because I know that every Sunday we go to church every Wednesday we go to church every time before we go to bed we read the Bible have we forgotten something [Music] that's why God say I know Abraham will teach his children that's what the Bible says I know Abraham will teach his children that's why I must unfold everything to Abraham so when God open up himself to you he trusts you [Applause] because he know you're gonna do the right thing you are worthy amen amen amen glory to God verse 8 and Abraham say my son water will provide himself God will provide himself for Land wait a minute Isaac say where is the sacrifice leading to Abraham know the sacrifice God told Abraham the sacrifice he said for this worship the sacrifice is Isaac why didn't he turn around until uh and uh and told Isaac that they sacrifices you he was not a guessworker we know who's going to be slain here we know who's the sacrifice but for some reason when Abraham turned around instead of saying you are the sacrifice Abraham releases something [Music] and what is he releasing he say my son God will do whatever in other words that sacrifice doesn't exist I'm happy that's why Isaac said where is the sacrifice in other words there is no sacrifice in that area amen Isaac say I'm looking around here I don't see any I don't see any lamb here I don't see anything in this area what is going on he said don't worry what you're looking for God Who provided Amen in other words God will created because it's not available there Jehovah Jireh it's a god of the third pool go see how many times brother Branham preached Jehovah Jireh God has many name why did Brother Branham stick only on Jehovah hard to help me verse eight and Abraham said my son God will provide how himself not for me he's the one that's looking for sacrifice he himself himself provide for himself a water so there was no lamb there now Abraham pushed God to the edge God put Abraham to the corner Abraham turned around and put God to the corner [Music] the game changed Abraham said I know My Sacrifice Abraham say I know My Sacrifice My Sacrifice is Isaac now you provide your own sacrifice [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you Seed of Abraham are you Seed of Abraham yes are you Seed of Abraham so you can put God in a corner I hope you guys in either way you can flip the table on God follow my language very well my friend everybody okay if God turns something on you you can turn it around you say no problem I have Isaac that's fine you also you will provide yourself a sacrifice there was a king who taught somebody that you're gonna be killed the man was condemned ready to die in everything he said what do you have to say before I kill you the men say I want to drink water as I drink water then you can kill me the king said no problem before brother say that the king said no problem before because I don't tell stories just like that rather brand I'm saying that I have story in the message I don't have to read TD Jakes I have story in the message okay I have Parable in the message everybody okay the king said no problem we won't kill you until you drink that water everybody okay they bring the water the men took the water and put it on the ground [Music] brother Branham says that the King was locked they won't kill you until you drink water the man took the water and put it on the ground the man who remained alive you can flip the table on the king [Applause] [Music] give Isaac okay no problem I'm gonna give Isaac you also provide yourself and if that lamb become I would say so why should I kill my son there is a lamb right here let's continue my friend let's continue amen amen amen so they both went together they both went of them together and they came verse 9 to a place which God had told him of an Abraham built in altar there and lay the wood in order and bound the Isaac his son I'm doing my own work there's no problem I'm I'm fulfilling my part uh me I don't have any problem I'm fulfilling my part you told me to tie my soul and I'm going to tie my son you also make sure you provide your name amen everybody okay and panda is like his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand I mean the business and took the knife to the water slay his son watch this lamb appear when the knife was about to cut Isaac before the knife touch the body of Isaac Uganda language right there before the surgeon knife touch the body of system media [Music] this message is scriptural that's when the staff will disappeared okay thank you the surgeon has a knife amen and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven and say water Abraham and he said here I am and he said lay not your hand upon the Lord neither do you anything to him for now I know no that you fear God amen you have respect for me when I tell you something you would do it no matter what you will put me first seeing you have not withheld your son your only son from me and Abraham lift up his eyes and look and behold behind him a water how did the hymn get out of there who started this story about Durham Abraham God just say go kill your son Abraham spoke that me and my son will come back then he spoke also of a line and God fulfilled all of them amen and the ram caught in a secret battle by its own and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the instead of his son his word save his son his word the word of Abraham the word of Abraham save his son amen he spoke that two thing number one if my son died Abraham locked God in Resurrection number two if he's not gonna kill my son Abraham lock God by providing a sacrifice so either way Abraham is winning amen if the killer said God have to raise Isaac back full coverage if they don't kill Isaac we gotta fulfill this Vision so you must bring a lamb if you bring a lamb I'm gonna swap it for Isaac full coverage so the word of Abraham a blocking or protecting Isaac [Music] because Isaac was given by God by God to Abraham as a promise [Music] so anything that can destroy the promise Abraham have a right to protect the promises yes that's it Abraham didn't say that safe the Lord did you see Abraham saying that says the Lord did you see Abraham saying in the name of Jesus Christ he just spoke and what he spoke happened God fulfilled both of them here is the Lamb you and Isaac you going back alive the word spoken in the tight corner amen and Abraham call his name the name of the place Jehovah Jireh as it is say to this day in the mouth of the Lord it shall be seen brother Branham say it was Jehovah Jireh he's a god of emergency I have the quote you want me I will send it to you brother Branham said Jehovah it's a god of emergency when you are in emergency situation 9-1-1 is Jehovah everybody okay what I want you to keep here the words that was spoken by Abraham both of them happen amen amen amen amen you might think Abraham was just coming his son down don't worry God will provide so don't mind never mind but God provided it so Abraham was not speaking just like that amen amen let's go to Isaiah 49. usually it takes time like this this stuff you don't run away with it you don't go 70 miles an hour you need to soak slowly amen because the teaching is like a rain you remember that right he goes into the seed to Quicken the seed that's what the Bible says so if a church in this message you don't like teaching I don't know if you got Murray my friend more is in the message it means a rain Isaiah 49 somebody sent me two scriptures about Isaiah and I tried to look at the scripture and I fall into this scripture come on oh god let's go to Isaiah 49 are you there oh awesome to me how can you talk to an and here in harken you people from from far the Lord has called me away from the womb do you see so before you were born you were already you were already chosen he taught Jeremiah that before you have even formed in your mother's womb I already picked you up everybody okay from the power of my mother has he made mention of what my name so God knew your name before your parents give you your name before they give you your name God already knew your name before you were even born God already knew so the name you carry now didn't come just like that your mother thought no no I just love the name so and so I'm gonna um I mean I'm gonna call name my child this no it's under inspiration if you the Seed of Abraham amen what verse said to and he has made my water like a water so our mouth am I reading a different Bible our mouth is water not just sword [Music] amen so you better know what you're doing with your mouth that's why the Bible said life and death [Applause] is in the power of the tongue the mouth of Abraham saved his son [Music] our mouth is what a sharp sword and he has made my mouth like a shop sword in the shadow of his hand he has hidden me and made me a Polish shaft in his quiver he has hide me in other words you were a bullet my friend amen you somebody that when God wants to fulfill a mission amen God we chat in his pocket and when he pulled Greg [Laughter] Amanda you are a bullet in the hand of God when God pulled he said who is this able so when you see a boy it's a bullet when you see Moses coming to Egypt it's an atomic bomb [Applause] because the mouth of Moses is a sharp Sword whatever Moses say he can bring a kingdom down [Applause] [Music] amen amen let's go to Second Corinthians our word our mouth is a sharp sword the words that came out of Abraham created it is not God that start the creation it is Abraham that start the creation Abraham spoke and God brought it to pass amen amen so I told you that Abraham is the father of our faith he's my father of my faith I have the faith of Abraham and the faith of Abraham is a faith that when he speak God performs it and I showed you in the second scripture that you don't have to worry about not being a Jew [Music] from the another wound you were already designed that's right your mouth was designed shut up for speaking things and the things happen amen your mouth can bring something in existence and can also take something out of existence your mouth can get the mouth of brother pranam remove sickness out of existence [Applause] you were created like that you were created in the image and in the likeness of God yeah God that's why you are worthy because no one is worthy but the lamb let's go to Second Corinthians chapter four glory to God Lord help me amen amen amen they program you so much with natural stuff so in this church I'm programming you with spiritual stuff amen so that just as you receive a PhD natural stuff you will receive a PhD in deity so when you come to hell when hell sees you they say doctor so and so doctor in Divinity [Applause] [Laughter] you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that there was somebody they were they were they were a class of people that tried to use the last sense of power they took the medical assets of Paul and they tried to cure a disease they say we coming under the name of the Jesus of Paul the demon said no I know Dr Paul I know I know Dr Jesus I know Dr Paul but you Allah says I don't know your license [Applause] everybody okay so the devil needs to know your license [Applause] which university Malachi for Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7. the message of the hour it's the blood of Jesus Christ it's a degree you put on your chest brother Branham say when you meet the devil show him you're talking [Applause] the way you are moving I don't know if I will preach let's go to Second Corinthians chapter four they made the message complicated the message is very easy the message when they preach it when it comes into you because the book when you eat it must be sweet that's right so when they preach the message it must be sweet [Music] amen second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 13 if you dare you can say Amen we having the water The Same Spirit of water amen Not the Same Spirit but the Same Spirit of water faith what does it mean Karma according as it is written our deed water and therefore have I spoken we also did water and therefore do we do water it's in the Bible in other words that faith of Abraham is just an example but we have the same Spirit of Faith just like Abraham spoke because he believed we also believe and we speak because from our mother womb we were created like that if you go to heaven you have not spoken you have not fulfilled your mission yet we are not in the age of flute Sage the level that God is bringing us you must speak if you're afraid you can even speak to a fish come on [Music] the Bible says this in Mark 11 for verily I say unto you that water whosoever shall say unto this mountain be water remove and be that cast into water and shall not doubt well in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say Hussein who was talking in Genesis Abraham amen which he said shall come to pass he shall have water did they put something there specifically Abraham in his situation he needed a ram I don't need a ram to eat I have some other stuff [Applause] brother Branham was looking for square if I don't hunt that's why the Bible said whatsoever amen amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father we thank you once again for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us Lord we are committing this Church unto their hand father help us up move us completely out of the way come and speak to us and be the Alpha and the Omega of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof faith in categories all levels faith in categories in other words they are categories of faith that's why I told you if you don't understand you don't understand me go back and listen they are different categories of faith and there are different levels of faith so we will pick you up wherever you are we're gonna pick you up if you in one we pick you up if we're in two we pick you up we okay amen we okay we are still in the four phases of roof part 85. there is enough everybody okay in the Tabernacle we are in roof before she departs from the earth we must reach a certain level you don't leave the earth going just like that we must reach certain level last Sunday we read this code Brother Branham say so hold hold the key comma what is the key faith in the word if you notice that faith is not in a man amen it is not the faith in a man it is not a faith that is in the church it is not the faith that is in the organization it is a faith that is in the world and the word of God the Bible say heaven and earth will pass away but the world will remain forever and faith in that word is the key what are you talking about brother Branham brother Branham saying and every bit of faith that you believe and don't doubt one spec you can do water unlock every door you can unlock water not some door in other words it's one kid that work in every door amen you can unlock every door that stand between you and the water the blessing that God has water for you so there is a blessing that God have for you and there is you in between you and the blessing there is a door there is an obstacle there is something that is preventing you from reaching what belonged to you that's right what God has for you he already found you worthy to receive it everybody okay but to remove the obstacle brother Branham say You must have the key and the key is faith in the word that's right brother brand I'm saying may God help us to have the keys is my prayer amen brother Branham says this he says I wish to read just the first tonight out of second Corinthians the fourth chapter the 18th verse while we look not at the things which are sin my subject tonight is looking at the Unseen we are told that we have an outward man and an inward man the outward man look by his eyes we okay and the inward men walk by faith in other words he doesn't use your eyes that's right amen so we have to be led by one of these two persons outside out on man is who so inward man is who [Applause] can you see clear can you see clear can you see clear my brother over there makes you a please the the this court stayed there the inward man is who the inward man in you is God whether you don't want to believe it that's fine but it's God because who else can create so if Abraham spoke and something was created who was creating God in who Abraham everybody good brother Branham say the inward man is who you see we do not see with our eyes though many times we thought that we saw with our eyes we only look with our eyes we see with our heart are we okay are we okay your eyes only gather information but somebody need to interpret the information and say that is brother so-and-so amen everybody okay glory to God brother Branham says this he says here it is watch and if God if you are enough swing of him and God is in you he will believe his own word that's right that's right question who is believing ahead of the word god way [Music] if God believe his word is it going to happen or it won't happen 100 bullseye because it's not you it is God so God in you and God believing his own word amen amen amen no problem my friend he says though he can be seen anything You Shall Believe It because the one who's believing it is not you that's right you see what I mean for God in you will believe his own I'm standing Assad so you don't say that I was blocking amen is that right congregation says water amen then you don't look at things you see you look at things that God said [Music] amen in other words when God already believes his word for you don't trouble him don't disturb God by your unbelief because God is saying it is for you you look you say I'm not worthy that's why he dealt with you on Wednesday but worthiness that's right because we too humble in this message we are always not worthy that's why he took the false humility out [Applause] Ernie not worthy on ourself Worthy on the road because of what he did on Calvary amen that's why Paul said I boast in the Lord [Music] bursting in the Lord is not boasting in me it is a burst of faith [Applause] amen we clear as we climbing brother Branham say the principle here is God in the people in other words the bottom line is God in the people how could God being supernatural being this man Jesus Christ you look at Jesus Christ he's talking like man he's eating like man he gets tired like man he sleep maybe he's even snoring because maybe we think God don't know maybe he's snoring they say by his story like us maybe Jesus was going one day and he hit the stone and he begin to bleed they say wait a minute God don't bleed but this one is bleeding how can this man be God size amen but he was God in human flesh he was Emmanuel in him do I left the fullness of the godhead badly Jesus was God Amen Jesus told the devil you shall not tempt who in other words Army of God you don't tempt me amen said that you went too far how can you tell me I'm the one who created you the Bible said you cannot tempt the Lord your God it is time for you to talk to the devil like that [Applause] I will check you my friend don't worry you need to test that you say listen listen stop playing I'm God that's right when God was creating I was with him you are a creature of time I am a creature of Eternity I am in the lineage of Melchizedek I don't have a beginning I don't have an end you don't accept God laughs [Applause] spoken word I don't have any children I'm gonna turn the corner you gotta turn that corner with me if you have to hold on the car like this hold on to it I'm gonna go with you when I turn the corner I'm gonna stabilize you but I won't leave you behind nobody will stay behind not even a hoof now if God put you in this church you will stay behind us [Applause] even if you stay behind I will come back and pull you back amen turn around and say let's go let's go let's go you are staying here [Applause] amen Amen brother Branham says they had never heard of that before but Jesus was doing water come up which gated to who in other words that that gate that was closed in Genesis Jesus came and said [Applause] he was opening a door to the race of Adam him being the water Son of God listen Jesus 24 34 Jesus answered is it not written in your water lord himself being the Son of God yet said I said Sid the personal pronoun in it I said yeah you yourself are God is he written in it is written is it written in your law that I said here back to water they could not water understand one time he was hooked one time he was who next time it was who Jesus speaking and he was a water so one time Abraham spoke and another time he was another Abraham that spoke that's right to know the difference watch the result amen [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay now Pastor can we have different level of faith where are you coming with this stuff [Music] where where do you get this stuff let's go to Romans 12. we're in the middle of a surgery my friend brother Robert I wish they can give me four hours to preach somebody get filled up quickly I have a quote brother Branham say when you eat it stretches your thumbs amen you there you there can we have different categories of it can we have different level of Faith Pastor where are you coming with this staff Roman chapter 12. you there amen you there amen let's go to verse three my friend for I say through the grace given to me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think Amen in other words evaluate yourself you know what you are don't fool yourself amen I'm picking I told you I'm going to pick you wherever you are if you are in kindergarten in elementary where we just gonna move together amen he says not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think house comma according as God has dealt to what every man the measure of water so Every Man Has a measure amen is my Bible different than yours according to the measure of faith so faith has measured according to the way God will deal with you we clear why verse 4 for us we have many members in one body and no members have not the same water [Music] so depending on your office God knows how much to supplier but remember all of that is Faith amen [Music] all of it is faithful the measure is different but it's your faith let me go slowly because I can jump quickly up first of all so we being many our water one body in Christ and every one member of one another we clear verse 6 having then gift water differing differing according to the water Grace stop so that measure of faith is connected to Grace are we together yeah yeah according to the magic to the grace that is given to us where the water prophecy comma let us prophesy according to the water proportion of faith so faith has proportion amen faith has measure faith has proportion amen so brother Stephen you you are saying that some people have big faith and some people have little faithful slow down to begin with faith have measures faith has proportion faith has categories where did Brother Branham say this slow down I'm going by the scripture first then I'm gonna climb up through Malachi 4 because that's the perfect interpretation of the Bible today amen absolute everybody okay let's go to Matthew chapter 6. Lord help me because we spoke so much about faith we talk about your faith your Revelation your vision faith in God faith in action faith in work but somebody still may be struggling or lingering somewhere now let's pick you up amen amen amen let's go to Matthew chapter 6. if you dare you can say amen amen verse 25 glory to God for I said to you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink not yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body then remnant behold the file of the Earth for the soul not do you see them working they don't clock in and clock out amen neither do they water Kama nor gather into water they don't even have a bank account to keep it so tomorrow they can use it Jehovah Jireh Jehovah you don't work you don't clock in you don't clock out and everything but the Lord will provide you need to understand these things so when the pressure come you know how to behave amen [Music] because the pressure will come you're gonna be put in a corner you need to know how to utilize your godship [Applause] you not God for nothing when you're in trouble you gotta wake the god in you you gotta wake him up you say I took you to church so long now is the hour show yourself up I was not waking up in the morning for nothing I was not wasting my time driving for hours for nothing you need to wake up and calm the storm that's right [Applause] [Laughter] glory to God he says and yet your heavenly father do what aren't you much better than they we clear which of You by water taking thought in other words can add one cubic to water his statue and why take your thought for remnant consider the lilies of the field how they grow date or not they do not they neither do they spin and yet I say to you that even who in all his glory was not array like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the film which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you comma Little Things can we have a little favor a little selfies characterized by worry wait a minute I just read the Scripture A fifth I always worry about tomorrow [Applause] I'm gonna pick you at where you are a faith that is always anxious if that crosses Bridge before he gets there a Nancy faith even if they say everything is okay after five minutes he woke up do you think it's okay I'm wondering about tomorrow I'm wondering about tomorrow it's a little faithful am I reading a different Bible no faith in categories [Music] everybody good everybody good you wish we can stay longer [Applause] it's a little faithful it's a faith that is characterized by worry by taking thoughts about tomorrow a doubt that don't know that God provided and that that is unconscious of the Providence of God it's a faith that is unconscious of Jehovah Jireh unconscious of Jehovah everybody good everybody good sorry man I got to lay you in the scriptures amen let's go to Matthew 8. glory to God I forgot to tell you maybe we take it like a Sunday School Matthew 18 you need the quote brother Brandon preach my marriage and divorce he say I'm going to take it like Sunday school so put that code there I know message believer some will come to listen to be blessed some will come they always seek for thought a Pharisee spirit they want you to sleep up in one thing what what have we told you you see now let me give you a news I'm Not Jesus the man I was saved by grace me and brother Brandon make a mistake so leave me alone Matthew 8. so in case you come up with something then I will tell you I was a human being I even have a quote [Music] Amen brother Brian I'm saying remember your pastor he's a man if you need the coach you ask me Matthew 8 Elizabeth verse 22 if you there you can say amen amen are you there amen Oh Glory to God Matthew 8 to verse 23 the Bible says this and when he was entered into the ship his disciple followed him and behold there arose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the wave but he was how and his disciple came to him and they woke him up saying Lord save us we do water can I read the Bible verse 26 and he said to them why are you how therefore are you of water and neither faith is a faith that is fearful amen foreign in other words the faith of Jesus and the faith was different are we together faith in categories he said what money of man is this that even the water and the water the water obey him so there is a faith that you can stop to cease there is a faith that you can speak to Nature that's right [Music] the Sea and the wind there is a faith that can affect nature amen it can affect the element of this Earth in other words even if a storm is rising up [Music] you can speak to the song you can say you storm go back over there and you son you need to shine for three days [Music] I hope you reading the message and I hope you know what I'm talking about because somebody spoke to the wind in this time if you don't know his name is William Marion Branham [Applause] and the wind obey him and the wind went back and sat quiet [Applause] lead the faith amen let's go to Matthew 14. father help me you dare you can say Amen faith in categories if I don't finish it my brother you call this faith in categories then the next time we say faith in the level so we keep it balanced or in type maybe we can give it like this Matthew 14 let's go to verse 25. if you're there you can say amen amen we there we there amen and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went to them I'm still in Matthew I have not changed to look so you can see the sequence Jesus went to them doing water walking on the hmm come on Amen everybody okay Jesus faithful is like a 96. come on brother amen slow down amen She's Every surface as normal if a ant come here he will enter to church just like you but when the earth hit this wall the aunt doesn't sit like a wall you will see the Earth entering and going this way that's right and when the earth hit the ceiling you won't see him falling he will be on the ceiling keep moving like this everybody okay because his perception is different from you and that perception give him the law against gravity [Applause] the vision of in it give him power over gravity [Applause] you said the Earth doesn't have weight even the Geico does it everybody good so when Jesus is walking Jesus can be coming and you see him going to the Sea and he goes like this and then he entered the sea somebody say well you're going to the Sea Jesus said what they see before you know it Jesus is walking on the water so Jesus had a certain level of faith that can even walk on water hahaha walk on what the H2O my friend amen what faith is that what kind of man is this one a man that can speak to the Sea a man that can speak to the to the wind a man that can even walk in the water and yet he was opening the gate for the rest of Adam [Music] he was bringing us back where we are supposed to be I am I know if I get where I'm getting it will challenge a lot of folks I know everybody okay everybody okay so when he begin to walk what happened please follow me carefully I'm gonna pick you up wherever you are if you're in kindergarten we're picking you up okay because your faith might be in kindergarten but it's still Faith but I'm gonna show you what do you do with a kindergarten faith amen amen let's go we are there and then verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it is water spirit you see we watch Harry Potter too much we got Halloween Halloween store everywhere so anything Supernatural is spooky [Music] when they give a testimony oh brother we better have the doctor stuff we don't believe too much but if you say no they give me medication and they work okay that medication is powerful I remember my grandma took a citromason and he works very well [Applause] you need to be careful I am a supernatural being that's right I'm just discovering what the Earth feels like [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] amen amen they say it is a spirit and they cry out for what fear we clear we clear we clear but immediately Jesus spoke to them and say what they it is and pay the answer to him and say Lord if it be you do water beat me to come where unto thee on the water we okay which Faith did this be they use to get on water let's go slowly amen beat me to come on the water and he said what account amen come on Peter sacrificed you tell me to come on the water too Jesus said oh somebody has uh audacity come he didn't give him no inspection because no one else spoke only Peter we okay are we okay and then when Peter he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he did what walked on the water so Jesus is not the only one that walk on water that's right because Jesus was virgin born but Peter was not virgin born so a man that is born out of a man and a woman can also walk on water thank God for people like Peter amen I can move on Unfaithful and give us a grant that we can claim amen amen and then he says and then he walk on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the water when boisterous the wind posturates he was power and begin to do water he cried saying water lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and say to him owe you water a little faith wherefore did you utter now so a little faith can also walk on the water amen cannot stop here so you can chew this at home and we can come back later huh when when they say spoke when they say walk on water you thought he was a big fish now Jesus is saying Peter has a lot of faithful because he felt he was doubting Jesus never doubt that's right the faith of Jesus never doubt the faith of Jesus was not faithful and Jesus walked in the water the faithful Peter even though he was small but he can get the result amazing because when they say lead the faith worrying with the people before you know it you begin to to despise the Lord of faithful Lord of faith can walk on the water that's right [Music] I'm gonna pick you up where you are my friend amen because it is still faithful that's right Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen glory to God let's go to Matthew 16. father help me Jesus Christ you see all of this we just moved from here to here so for me to get here I don't know everybody okay Matthew 16 if you dare you can say amen amen let's go to verse 5 my friend he says and when this disciple will come to the other side they have forgotten to do water break bread to take bread and then and no then Jesus there is no end I don't want to add anything then Jesus said to them take it and be aware of the leaven of the Pharisee and of the sad you see and the reason among themselves corner saying it is because we have taken water no bread which when Jesus perceived he says to them oh year of water why reason you among yourself it is a faith that have a lot of reasoning why reason ye among yourself because you have brought water a worry of the bread Jesus said do you not yet understand neither remember the Five Loaves of five thousand and how many baskets you took up needed the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many uh baskets you have took up in other words Jesus did this miracle twice two times my friend and then on the third time they begin to question again in other words you are sick God rescue you you were sick God rescue you now you get sick again and you begin to worry and God say you don't understand do you remember you were in the hospital I hit you don't you remember the second time I did that why you don't understand [Applause] it is a baby face a faith that one to be part of the time Jesus look he said you don't know in other words when I'm doing miracle on your life don't you know that I'm giving you a lesson amen so that next time when something happened you ought to remember because remember last Sunday when an experience come in your life it's also seed for the future that's right that's right [Applause] you're gonna enjoy the present time but keep it as a bullet for the future that's why David said the god that deliver me from the lion from The Bear now he can do it for this and circumcised your lion could be coronavirus your bear could be pneumonia but if today something else rise up remind that devil just like your brother coronavirish and your brother pneumonia and your brother kisses just as I destroyed them I'm gonna cut off your head [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because you are of the same lineage and when you are on the limit of the Philistine I have a commitment in Canaan to wipe everything that look like I'm all right I have to wipe all the items so if God deliver you from the armor right tell the job you said you didn't hear over there you didn't hear what I did to the Egyptian you didn't hear what happened in Jericho wait your turn is the next one since you trample on my ground you're gonna be like one of them [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody good everybody good everybody good so far amen praise be to the name of the Lord so little faith worry about stuff let us forget what they have already done amen there is a faith that is little there is a measures of Faith they are proportion of faith if we have a little faith do we have a great faith man do we have great faith let's go to Matthew chapter 8. glory to God father help me up Matthew chapter 8. if you dare you can say amen amen verse 5. you there amen and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum can I continue there came to him a water in other words begging him I'm going by the scripture so whenever I'm bringing Malachi 4 we will begin to sow amen and he went to the Centurion oh sorry came to to him a centurion beseeching or begging him and saying Lord my servant lies at home how sick of the palsy grievously water if you notice here the servant is not in the same place that the one who came for the request is brother Branham said he was two day two days journey we clear we clear first uh uh seven and Jesus said to him I will come and do what heal him Jesus wanted to come and heal him I'm gonna drop a seed here but I will pick it up later if the Lord help me brother Branham said Jesus was willing to come and lay hand on him hey keep keep that keep that quiet I don't want to get there yet I don't want to get there yet please I don't want to get there yet okay okay we clear let's see what it is he said there's something on Ancient and say Lord I am not water worthy you see the Gentile talk that you should come under my water but water speak the word only this Centurion is more worrying about the spoken word he doesn't want any contact he said don't even waste your money to pick up a Uber don't take a Uber I'm already here [Applause] these things don't matter hey man can I continue he says speak the word only so one thing I'm looking for you it's just the word only in other words after the word I don't need nothing else what is in this word in other words I don't need your hand no no I don't need your presence I don't need your physical being I just need what come out of your mouth if I can grab that one bye bye [Applause] what category of faith is this one [Applause] body I'm gonna turn the corner with you my friend if you're afraid buckle up and you know back home when they carry people in the in the bike and they will put you in the bag so if you're afraid you got a whole deal yeah it's so hold me very tight here put your hand here okay your spiritual hand put them here even if I'm going this way you just keep holding me I will take you through [Applause] all right [Applause] everybody could we ready my friend he says pick the one only and my servant shall be how one spoke like that before not you spoke like that before Jesus verse 9 for I am a man underwater Authority is the faith that lays in authority Authority means knowing who you are [Applause] and what power was invested to you amen that's right amen Authority don't look at the size authority never went in the balance in the morning to see how much they wait Authority they don't do that as soon as a police officer put his uh his uniform when that uniform is on authorities on that's right even if he's shot like this if you're being a big truck and he does just like this he's nothing you won't see me doing like this doing the police officer doing like this he just is like this and he knows that you will manage to push every break and you stay quiet and you keep your hand on your on your on your on your steering wheel until he come and when he come he knocked at the door at the window you got to put your window down I need your travel license and he take your driver license and he leaves you there and he goes in his car and he sits down you can move until he let you go your appointment is gone foreign [Applause] because I will hold you there [Applause] [Laughter]

did you see him saying please did you see him saying uh I'm sorry would you go there go and he does water and to another water come on so this man understand that his word can some can send something away from him I'm reading the Bible all his word can bring something closer to him are we together this faith can bring something far away from you and also can bring something closer to you depending on the need everybody okay he say come and he comes and to my servant do this and water oh my God when Jesus heard it this man made the mouth of Jesus Christ hang down Jesus look he said [Music] you can make the mouth of Jesus Christ like this amen by your faith [Music] amen amen Jesus and say to them that water in other words he stopped he said hey he even left the one he turned to the disciple he said this is what I was trying to teach you boy all of you wake up who's there are you there tell the other one who's looking at the restaurant over there pay attention tell them to focus I want to tell you something what are you trying to tell them Jesus say verily I say unto you I have not found saltwater we're not in leadership now now we are in water great thing so there is a little faith and there is also a water great thing and great faith only Targets this way that's right it's a faith that can bring something closer I'll put something away it's a faith that doesn't care about the distance it's a fifth to understand its own authority amen verily I have not found no faith not in water Israel this Faith Jesus didn't find it in Israel Jesus Christ he had the word it's a specie of faith that lives on the Jetta [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because brother Branham says brother Branham says that we have seven churches you okay wait for me we have Ephesus we have Smyrna we have pergaments we have tatarian we have Sardis we have Philadelphia and we have laodicea amen brother brought them safe from here to here the majority of the people were Jews because Jesus told them go into all the word preach beginning at Jerusalem all the church started with the apostle and he was moving on brother but I'm saying when he reached that Italian age amen this is when the church flipped completely from a Jews amen into the Gentile everybody okay everybody okay and it looked like at the very end when because right here you might maybe have leftover of juice right here you might have maybe a little little bit so at the very end when there is purely Jetta that's when God sent the spoken word amen and Jesus said this faithful I have not funded nowhere in nature in other words every time I deal with the Jews they come up with something else but this boy where did you get this stuff and Jesus called that the water great thing all this terminology are coming from the mouth of Jesus I'm not the one producing it fifth in categories amen Jesus said on 11 and I say unto you that many shall come from water and shall sit down with who with Abraham and water and who in the Kingdom of water but the children of the Kingdom the Jews shall be how cast out into outer Darkness there shall be water in other words the Jews will be in the tribulation period under the Sixth
