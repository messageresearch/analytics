preach about but i'm a singer so i have to see what tries to fit but i want to sing this one jesus loves me we're gonna start off with the music and then we're gonna we're gonna sing at acapella and we're gonna lift our voices amen we're not in a hurry we got one service today this is the last song we have a couple of specials and some prayer requests and stuff but i just felt led to sing this

from sister hamilton i'll let her come on up and tell this real quick amen [Applause] good morning church last week my husband well every day my husband gets up between two and three in the morning before he gets up for work he makes it his business to pray he gets up an hour two hours early prior to work last thursday he was at work his truck is to give you a picture is like a fire truck the length of a fire truck as tall as a fire truck but he has to on some job sites because he works construction are not stable the ground is soft wet rain so he was up under the truck trying to stabilize the leg and the hydraulics went out and the truck dropped well he didn't see it didn't have time to move had it fallen it would have killed him he said he when the truck shook it should have fallen but i believe because god woke me up my son says he woke him up my daughter later said woke him up we prayed over him that morning he didn't even know we didn't know this happened and god brought him home to it so i thank the lord for that thank you for your prayers hey man hallelujah that was your pump truck pump truck did that huh he drives a concrete pump truck my job is to make the concrete now and then our trucks take it and put it in the back of his truck and he pumps it way over there somewhere how big is it 32 meter so it's a little it's a little one in the business but it's dangerous it's unstable mixers are the same way you're going down the road with a a load that's twisting all the time but god watches after his amen praise god that could have been very tragic we've seen him flip we've seen him stand up on their nose and turn in the ground i don't know the ground just ain't like it there's no good ground where they're building in anywhere anymore but basically we also want to thank the lord with the foul bee family because it's sister jerusha's birthday today tomorrow excuse me he wrote today with tomorrow amen praise the lord hallelujah glory it's a privilege to say that you know uh when you when you stay with the congregation for a while you tend to watch watch them grow up from little children you know and we've been around a while now so she's a special she's a special young lady amen coming from a special family also for does anybody else have a praise report before i uh go to prayer requests amen okay so sister hamilton also um put in a prayer

cameron so ricky michelle and cameron what's the last name okay alexander okay i think names are important when we pray i mean god knows but we're putting the greatest name that ever was spoke on the face of the earth on top of that amen so i'm going to ask brother lamont if he wouldn't mind coming up and praying over this this morning it's good to see our brother amen god bless you my friend good

god glory that my sister has received the message of the hour she's now attending brother duff's church in florida so um whatever example i could show her you know i'm just so glad that god is out the way to her through us i have this song on my heart from since a few weeks ago when brother stephen been sharing us about the heart and the flesh crying out so when he's preaching on that song it's from years ago i heard this song and i want to sing it but if you're tired of hearing my voice coming up and singing i got a lot of songs so if you're tired of hearing me you better come up rather

can not just here in church either but every day of my life i want to give him my very best so that's a lot about that's what the song is about and i wonder if you can just join with me it's kind of a choir song so i'll kind of be the choir leader and y'all will be my choir i'm trying to find the key here y'all all right we're going to the teach in me wants to be free from the cares of life that

you amen thank you jesus hallelujah for those who have a little trouble with time just give me some grace amen we got the vote we got to give an announcement we got to preach we only have one service so just today bear a little bit of burden amen and everything will be all right how many catch up on the service on wednesday can i see your hand okay so the other people didn't let me see okay praise be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord if you miss wednesday you're going to have a lot of trouble this morning but stay put everything will be all right by god's grace amen you know wednesday i was reading a scripture and instead of reading first timothy or something like the second timothy and i went and i was reading first timothy and i came up and said my god should be how did that make such a mistake i was wondering and the brother approached me he said brother stephen you know the scripture that you made a mistake over there i was thinking all day long about my life and my answer came right from that [Applause] scripture i was feeling bad he told me no he was the holy spirit and last night it was i believe around 12 a.m i was sitting on the living room and brother branham spoke something and i say where i see it amen brother branham say in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled but branham was given a bible from sister meda and he took the bible and was reading and could not read go on the backside read the wrong place the wrong place the wrong place and they gave him a bible where the two paper was taken together and it seems like it's a problem listen to what brother i'm saying he said so one of the children picked it up and we would fill the pages no it looks all right but right down at the bottom it was two pages sticking together see the 16th chapter was on this side and then the continuation of the 16th chapter came up on the other side and the 17 started on it's just perfectly exactly the same across and that indian paper real thin sticking together and i was reading out of chapter of the 17th chapter all the time instead of the 16th chapter so when brother branham starts 16 he flip he's already on 17 for some reason and do you know what happened he was a catholic priest that took the bible and bring it to brother branham and say pick up the bible verse paragraph 37 and i thought god why did you do that he's blaming god why would there be such a thing now that's my feeling you know to see what it was all about because i think nothing happens by chance and i was thinking about the comfort of this brother here coming telling me hold steady him being a priest hold steady maybe god is going to do something and suddenly a thunderbolt came down from heaven and told brother branham go to the book of luke and you're going to see when he entered into the synagogue a priest took the score and gave it to him this day this scripture is fulfilled amen so everything that is happening just pay attention maybe god is moving in a mysterious way he might not think like it's going according to your plan but somehow all things all work together for good to them that love god and those that are caught according to his what purpose amen blessed be the name of the lord now we have an announcement and i'm going to build it up with quotes in the placing of the deacons brother branham said we are building now and we wish to place this church and as a journal overseer of the church i must see that it's kept scripturally everything right on the word that's why i say on wednesday if the prophet say hey i'm going to tell you a if he say b i'm going to tell you b there is no way i can take the word and waver and play with the word or lower the potential of the word done to please anybody we're just going to give it to you according to the prescription because i don't want to face him and have to answer for somebody's blood i want to make sure it comes from the prophet and from the bible amen so we know we have to agree with the word if it's the word if the word is out in one place then it's out everywhere it's perfectly in harmony all the way through i just believe the word that is god's program so the word of god is the program of god i do not want anything more than the bible teaches but i want it all that it does teach i want it all so it's god's word now i know that god can do anything to can do things that is not written in the word because it's god the bible even said that there are many things that jesus did that were not even recorded in the book amen he is god he can do everything he desires to but as long as i know it is coming out of the world it just give me a good assurance that everything is all right i like that real well so when i know it's in the bible brother branham said it when i give it to you i can go sleep in peace because i know that it's not my word it is the word of god amen now we have an announcement and i'm going to let you know in a few minutes what it is in the unpardonable scene brother branham says that so now let us join up together let us be a bunch of people here in this little old tabernacle if you want to take that name of mine off the front out there they just put that on there so brother branham is talking about the name of the church or the name of the tabernacle the name of the tabernacle is branham tabernacle so brother branham is saying here that if there could be a possibility he does not want his name attached to the church he does not want his name attached to the building of the church the name of brother branham he doesn't want it to be connected to the church in other words he doesn't want it to be called branham tabernacle just call it anything you want to don't make any difference you can just call it church if you want to you don't have to be a branham tabernacle that's the prophet and that's what i'm gonna stand with amen brahm has nothing to do with it not at all not a thing they just put my name up there because the what they did was in my name there and they made it up so the name of brother branham appeared on the deed and because of the name being of the deed he automatically by default bring the name of the tabernacle unto his own name amen blessed be the name of the lord paragraph 241 i went down there and worked during the depression brother branham was working just like your pastor is working and they brought in their water so when brother branham was working brother branham brought his tight into the church brother stephen do you pay tithe yes ask your trustees they brought their target instead of me keeping it and not working because the thought belonged to the pastor so brother branham had the right to take the title and use it and stop working say amen brother stephen have a right to stop working and put and take the title can you say a man [Applause] he's a dennis he doesn't need money [Laughter] instead of me keeping it and not working i put my own tardine being a pastor paying that to himself and my water because god in the book of malachi say you are cheating him in turning an offering usually turning is universal 10 everybody knows it offering that's where we kill god you go to the store you buy whatever you want and you pick up the change and that's what you bring for offering amen i put my own hardening and my offering in and the money in and we built the water so the tabernacle that was first built in jeffersonville was built out of the that and the offering of the people can you say amen i want to make sure everything is standing on the word amen and it's built on the arms of the not the pastor that they give to me to make a water and i walk and put it back in there and that is the reason they call it water but at the beginning he said he doesn't want his name there so the tabernacle was built with the money out of the tax and the offering and the home that the people gave that's what they built the branham tabernacle i just read it from the prophet when i got elected here as a pastor and we place a temporary order for appointed trustees and appointed deacons until we get to the full vote which we will be doing today i told you that god gave me a job that i can still sustain myself and i will dedicate all the turning to the search of the building amen by the grace of god with the help of god with the work of spoken word tabernacle the work of the trustees the work of the deacon the work of the sisters the works of the brother last friday we close on the deal of a property and the church and everything is paid off [Applause] brad abel your song was right on time we have something to praise god for we have something to shout about it congratulations spoken word tabernacle congratulations god bless you from your titan your offering you bought a property cash amen brother mickey i hide that from you blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] that was the quickest closing i ever have in my life in less than five minutes son here son here son here brother michael daley pick up the keys and we were out so your property is paid off the old building of the church is paid off we don't owe anybody any money we didn't borrow any money you talking about the god of miracles and do you know what the property value of your church amen on the market is double the price that we pray for [Applause] so if you decide to sell that church now we can get twice the money we gave cashier [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so congratulations spoken word tabernacle blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] hallelujah and those who want to go see the church you can sit put after church service brother one of the trustees they have the key the d can have the keys i have a key i have been handed a duplicate key so you can go and you can see the building and everything there amen now brother stephen i have a question what is the name that was put on the church document [Music] i don't want to go to trouble again hallelujah that's the reason they call it branham tabernacle that don't have one thing to do with it if it's called navel subernacle it's called anything you want to it don't make any difference it's just a little place that god gave us to put our head everybody clear let's continue i wish he was not what so brother branham still doesn't want his name on the property of the church do you think i'm going to do something different i wish he was just called the tabernacle didn't even have my name water i am fixing to turn this church you all know when we boarded i bought it when i worked for the public service company and put this thing up here and just call it that because that brought a c word and them attached my name to it when they put it on the deed down there just as soon as i can get clear of this thing that we are in now this church is going to be turned over to a community and just given my name water so when it was the time to put the name i was asked brother stephen what is the name we're going to put on the church property i say brother branham never wanted his church to bear his own name i don't want you to put my name if i need the house i need to buy my house myself are you there this is the house of the lord i say put the name of spoken word tabernacle so if you have question the church belong to spoken word tabernacle that's it [Applause] as a pastor i'm going to protect it i'm going to watch over it i'm going to take care of it but it is not my church i want that to sink in copy this and keep it i don't think my name ought to be on that church he ought not to be a branham tabernacle should just be the church of the lord jesus christ or something like that the tabernacle of the lord the dwelling place the house of prayer he's giving you many names or something another giving some kind of a name let the what congregation choose there and this congregation shows the name of what spoken word tabernacle that's the name on the deed hallelujah my name i'm just a man my name don't deserve that's a prophet do you think man will deserve her don't deserve to be on this not no more than nothing the reason he had put my name on this because my name was on the deed say billy branham and it should not be there in other words even on that deed brother branham didn't want his name there all i did i just signed the paperwork the church belonged to the church it doesn't belong to the deacon it doesn't belong to the trustee it doesn't belong to you it belongs to mr spock and way tavern no sir it should be a community church this should be the congregation here everybody clear so far brother branham say i told you we are going to change the name of this and keep loading i'm loading you up it is not right for it to be branham tabernacle that is just a man we are going to change the name of it make it some other name we shall get on that after a while i just wanted to be the church a church of the world i don't want it what what what never anybody clear so the church belong to whom i put my dad you put your thought it belonged to who everybody hallelujah brother stephen i have another question you bought the church and you bought the property we still have some work to do when you get to the building you will see we got to make a parking lot we got to change the carpet and do some work there and we need some money again so the quickest you work with your tithing and your offering the easier we're going to go ahead and get into it but let's be a little bit patient we don't want to patch work i don't want to put a carpet and in two years we change the carpet it is the church of the children of god let's make it nice good and respectable and look great because it's the church of the living god amen not just paint here and then tomorrow the pen begin to peel off if you want to do it do it right oh don't do it at all so how are we going to continue [Applause] so how are we going to continue brother stephen are we going to continue to get money out of the turning let's read brother branham would it be wrong to use stars on church building funds here is a touchy little things now for the church now no say amen at the beginning it worked now no correctly task is to go to the that's right in the bible they had a box that is set at the door in the old testament when the building this box was a found where the people put in for the water you have read it many times in the old testament they kept the building they kept up the building and things like that all the repair on the building was taken care of that found but a tenth of one of that a tenth of the turning all the time went to the to there yes starting our goal out to go for nothing else i know people take their thought and give them to a widow woman that is if you get anything to give to the widow mugu man give her but don't give her what timing is what that is not yours in the first place that is what so if you notice here brother branham said there was a box put other outside of the church for building funds that's your next stage now i started like branham tabernacle and i'm putting you back like branham tabernacle are you there where did brother branham get that scripture give me time with grace with your time first king chapter 12 verse 9 to 12 by jehoiad that the priest took a what a box anybody there and bore a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of door trustees get that pretty good and the priest that kept the door put there in all the water that was brought in into the house of the lord and it was so when they saw that there was so much there was much money in the chest the box that described the king scrub and the high priest came up and they put up in what and told the money in other words as trustees we must give a report of what is coming up from the building funds amen and taught the money that was found in the house of the lord and they gave the money being told reported into the hand of what them that did though that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they led it out to the and uh that wrought upon the house of the lord and to the and what to do what and young stone to what the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid out for the house of two in other words the entire project they have put down when the money comes this is the way the money is going to all be operated we're just putting the church back into the world everybody clear so far all right we're almost done and at the king's commandment ii chronicle they made a water and set it without the gate of the house of the lord and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring into the lord water so brother jim and brother micah deli if god permits that they are for their trustees you're gonna see them here reminding you that when you have twenty dollars we have work to do when you have a hundred dollars we have work to do when you have a thousand dollars we have work to do when you have twenty thousand dollars that's the ministry of brother michael and chima they are anointed when they say that amen the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the water so even in the building of the tabernacle in the wilderness there was a collection that was made for the building ever clear praise the name of the lord and all the princes and all the people did what so when they told them about bringing money for the building they were not sad [Applause] they were not crying and say out to my paycheck again what a pastor god gave you [Laughter] and all the princes and all the people did what and brought in because god wants a cheerful what [Music] it just dropped and brought in and cast into the water this is not the offering this is for the building repair building fund until they had made air now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the leaver and when they saw that there was much money the king's crab and the high priest officer came and did what emptied the chest and who did what and who did what where in other words when brother michael daley and brother chim empty the money to continue to make your building look pretty they're gonna come back again here with the basket and remind you over again that we still need money to finish the building everybody clear they have to carry the box back to its place i'm reading you the scripture i want you to be based on the scripture anybody clear and the high priest officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried to his place again thus they did what and got the money in what abundance and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired mason and carpenter to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrote iron and brass to man to house of the lord so from now on offering offering turning turning money for building money for building it is up to the pastor himself if he want to pull money from the tiding and put it for the building fund and it's not gonna be an ownership but when he get in the building found it turn up from padding in morphe into building fun so that there is no claim to be put on anybody clear anybody clear in other words when we take the money we put it on building fund the name of that money is building fund it is no longer pastor's money when you bring your tattoo you put it in the church it is not your money anymore it is god's money everybody clear can you say a man [Applause] church vote hallelujah everybody clear if you sleeping you can stand back there i can see everybody we believe in church water and the government is order of who in the world so not politics are there in the church the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that is god's elders in organization you have to go through the bishop now there is no higher order in the bible than the elder of the church just tell me where is it it isn't there is no higher order in the bible for the church than the elder which is there that's why i'm going to make sure we protect the building because god's people put their arm put their money to have a building it belongs to the community it belongs to spoken word tabernacle it belongs to the children of god amen he is the highest order of the bible everybody clear i'm going to say this and may every officer of the church fill his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church each one will have to give water everybody care who are going to be voted when we bought the building we went in to pray for him amen and i'm going to present you the people from left to right the one kneeling down is brother glenn kelly right there we were praying for the building matter of fact an anointing dropped the one standing with hands up is brother robert farby anybody clear the one looking like a boss back there when i look at this i say i'm gonna get him on this one that's brother michael daley and the one looking on the on the on the black jacket over there very simple like man that is brother jim cabello at the beginning when we presented to you the officer you don't really vote song leaders song leader are appointed and that's it at the beginning when we presented you the officer for the trustees and the deacon among those officers we have brother abel cardinal you might have a question why is brother elbow not there brother is a wonderful brother brother rebel is one of our song leaders here and he's helping on the computer he's helping with instrument the post or the duty of a deacon requires a certain consistency on the church a deacon must be there but with his job and uh the way he's moving he's a man that traveled quite a bit so he never done anything wrong he didn't sin you on the internet he didn't do anything wrong so don't call people here and trying to check why is not brother everybody amen so we talk with brother abel and his shift to help brother david more on the computer and on the sound system and he's still one of our song leaders and even on wednesday sometime one of the deacon might be out he's still going to continue to help us pick up the offering and doing the things just like he did this morning but the reason why we shift him a little bit is just because he had to travel go out and come back go out and come back and even when he's out he's still in church amen he's not there outside and missing church and when he comes back on his way back he always catch up on the sermon so we didn't shift him because there is anything wrong no because the office of a deacon requires certain consistency somebody to be there when the service out there and we don't want anybody being complaining like hey the deacon is not there or anything he will continue to lead that song he's still one of our brothers he'll continue to pick up the offering help the deacon the best that he can everybody clear so far if somebody call you tell him hang your phone everybody clear so please everybody clear so from the left going to the right side the two up here are deacons to be we have brother glenn kelly he had to speak something here because when we started and we presented the people he was not there so he was kind of nervous he wanted to talk to the people anybody clear on the other side over there those are the two trustees when i was looking at this picture i begin to get some inspiration but what we will do to gain some more time i will ask brother john porter back there and brother elbow if you can get the ballot and send it to the people just pass them on with a pen you're gonna vote yes or no either you want brother kelly to be a deacon god rabbit brother michael daley to be a trustee and brother team at this point we're going to stop ready as the church is growing up because we don't have we we have to manage the room for sunday school and everything when the church continues to grow then we will continue to get there in the building then we open up the door for sunday school superintendent if we need more deacon we're going to add them more more trustees and the treasure all the way so this is just a step as we're progressing if the lord carries everybody clear so far yes yes sir so i send you a text a mass text you know who a member of the church is you know the description and i sent a quote so you know who's eligible to vote so they're going to go ahead and hand you the ballot and those online we gave you instruction how to vote for those that are member of this church because of the pandemic or a legitimate reason you are home you know how to vote and brother john and the other brother will count on the vote they will give it to me at the end of the service then we're going to go in the scripture brothers once you finish to pass them on we're going to pray so this is a snapshot of your church building amen brother kelly kneeling down praying brother robert standing i begin to look at that picture and i say my goodness what a balance in the deacon do you know brother kelly does a prison ministry amen do you know usually who get in prison it's people that are in the mud people that are criminals people that did bad things people that were stealing somewhere or armed robbery or whatever it is they take them incarcerated them and put them in prison and brother kelly goes down there in prison to preach to those people trying to win soul and to pull the children of god out of the mud so no wonder you see him kneeling down so if you in this church you find yourself in adultery on the bed in a hotel there is a deacon that can kneel down and reach down and pull you out there [Applause] everybody clear we have a special deacon that can pull down when you are when you have a problem with smoking with drugs just give him a call he knows how to kneel down come to your level and he's going to pick you up if you are standing and you're still struggling there is a standing deacon there that can hug you and handle you and help you up all the way until you stabilize so we got deacom that can go down and those that can take some on the surface and rescue you and bring you back to fellowship everybody here oh my god everybody gather balot he got two trustees one looking like a millionaire and another one looking simple so in soap and spoken way tabernacle whether you're a millionaire whether you are simple we put hand on the toxado and overall both of them are represented there what a beautiful picture can i continue with my inspiration do you see somebody's foot over there that's a secret one those are warriors in the back that knows how to claim building and pray for you what a team if you don't you let me know then we can pray you already did it that's fine you should be praying throughout the week anyway okay as they're picking up let's stand and go to the word of god thank you jesus for building in a year the lord is doing mighty works let's go to jeremiah chapter 29. we're going to pick up from where we were on wednesday i hope i cover all the questions about the building i didn't hear too much a man it's only few still few okay so your church belongs to you don't ever think about steven tabernacle forget it amen jeremiah 29 verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you this is not my thought this is not your thought this is god's thoughts towards you amen hallelujah says the lord thoughts of what and not of what to give you what a hopeful end so the purpose the plan of god for your life is at the end you're going to come upright sometimes he might thinks like it's troubling sometimes he might be hard on the road but that is not his intent amen the finishing line there is an expected end there is a good result there is something good that's going to come out of it anybody clear let's go to john chapter one the thoughts of god the plans of god are not to harm you you got the holy ghost you get in trouble but that's not the thought of god not to bring you the rest so that you can be in trouble anybody clear because it looks like they got the water from rephrasing and the amalekite rose i thought we're getting into rest then we got into trouble that is not his thought john chapter 1 verse 12 you might be seated but as many as received him receive who to them gave him power you remember on wednesday you must receive you must accept it you remember on wednesday as many as receive him to those that receive him that accepted it to them gave him what so when you accept the word of god there is a hidden power that is automatically transferred to you what is the purpose of that power because we see on wednesday that you don't have to do anything amen to them gave him power to do what to become the sons of what so when god sent the gospel to you when god sent the message to you oh the gospel he said that message there is a power of transformation brother branham preach a message amen when you receive the message inside that message there is a power to take you and to make you exactly what god intended you to be because the spoken word is the original word and every seed must be reproduced according to what so when you get so you are a bedding ground so when you open your heart and the word come and get on your bedding ground if you just put your car in neutral the world itself have power to take you from egg to sea hallelujah he gave you power to become the sons of god even to them that what so that acceptance is belief i'm reading to you the bible accepted it's the same as belief faith anybody there even to them that believe on his name which were born not of what flesh no of the will of the know of the will of what but of what you are born by the will of god hallelujah job to verse 16 and of his what the fullness of who have all we received what grace for grace so christ is the fullness of the godhead badly and there is room for everybody and from that fullness everybody receive their grace for grace because by one spirit we are all what baptized into what one body praise the name of the lord let's go to ephesians chapter 2 then we will pray blessed be the name of the lord we heard too much about the new birth we need to get it because the second banquet deal with the change of the body anybody could yeah ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by words okay somebody's awake cool so by grace are you through what remember here accept and believe okay how can i get that faith and that's not of yourself it doesn't come from you amen it is what so that faith is a gift god gives you in other words god bring you the program to be saved and just loaded just let the computer run amen verse nine not of quirks lest any man should do what god don't want you to boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus to good works which god had before or then that we should do jump what verse 18 for through him we both have what by what to whom everybody here go to chapter 4 of ephesian you should know this scripture even by memory everybody there verse 30. and grieve not what whereby you were still until the day of what so there is an a and there is a z anybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace father you love your mercy for giving us a building that we can call ours father we thank you for a wonderful congregation that dedicated their oh lord father to make this happen lord we thank you for everything and we thank you for giving us even another opportunity this morning to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord we did what every man here on planet earth with a correct and normal ability can do father but as long as coming and unfolding your word and giving revelation to your children it takes a grace from you lord may you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children tonight may the devil be completely sealed out may only the holy spirit be sealed in those that are weak lord may you touch them those that are lord father that feel like they're tired and that the devil is trying to put them asleep lord father may you shake that demon away from this place in the name of jesus christ father we commit all and everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are on part 30 in the part 15 of king ahazary street fist and esther to banquet we spoke about the first fifth the second the third the first banquet and in preparation to the second banquet we are trying to get the two aspects that david spoke about the redemption with crying uh david crying for the redemption of the soul and the redemption of the body everybody clear when we spoke about referendum we unfolded that referendum was a place of rest everybody clear so as we built from psalm 63 david says there that my soul just for thee and my flesh also longest for thee and on wednesday we explain to you that when we are born according to ephesians chapter 2 we are born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking lies and by nature we were also children of what disobedience everybody clear so when you are born in this world both your outer man everybody there and your inner man or your inside man both of them are black or dark in other words you have sin on the other man and you also have a sinful nature on your inside so when you get to the place where you begin to thrust after god because god put you in a certain corner that you have to be looking unto him when you get to that place that you're testing god will bring you in referendum everybody clear and in referendum you move from the stage one that you were born and you go to stage two and in stage two your inside man becomes now light or converted over here it's dark on the outside and it's also dark on the inside this is your first church yo your first stage which is our natural birth everybody clear so when you move to the spiritual birth everybody there what happened is when the holy spirit come to you the holy spirit will clean your inside and take that sinful nature out of you then your inside man is now born again your inside man become the white dog that we explained to you but the black dog is still on the outside which is still seen everybody there when you are born you have a black dog outside and you have a black dog inside when you are born again you have a white dog on the inside and you have a black dog on the outside that's why the fight started there is no way a fight can start between a dark and a duck because jesus told us that if satan fights satan what happened to his kingdom is going to be divided anybody there so the only way war can be proclaimed is only when white darkness everybody else in heaven everything was fine everything was peaceful until lucifer initiated sin when sin was initiated one was declared in heaven amen because there were two kingdoms now trying to fight for a position anybody clear so far now david says that when he's born born in sin sharpening iniquity coming into the word speaking lies and as a child of god brother bonham explained to us that when you are born god blesses in your soul a predestinated seed there that is laying dormant everybody clear so that is the difference between you and the sinner even though you are still sinner amen when they check the microscope they will see that in the life of certain people there is nothing to quicken but the difference between you and that person is that within your soul god bless a seed that seed was placed there for a purpose and that is the seed that was making david cry because that seed does not like darkness that seed does not lack the condition you go to the night club you drunk you come back everybody is happy but something in you make you sad you go in the bed of prostitution you do everything that everybody is doing somebody's happy when you come you are sad that sadness it is god in you already telling you that i don't like the life that you are living that's why the david that was crying is not this devil it is not this david but it is this david right here that was crying to be delivered on the soul and also under flesh everybody clear so far he said my soul longest and even fainted for the court of the lord my what which is the occupancy of the soul and my word cry out for the word because only a living god not a dead god only the lord god can deliver you from this sinful condition ever clear so far press the name of the lord so when they reach that place in referendum moses struck the rock and water came out and we already explained to you that order brother branham told us he represent the holy spirit to quench this the thirst of the soul which is completing the first part right here of your redemption and by there the redemption of the inner man is completed in other words if you die now automatically you're going into the presence of god everybody clear praise the name of the lord now as we continue here where does the holy ghost that get into your soul what does he do the bible says in ii corinthians chapter one he which does what establishes you establishes us with you in christ and he that does what anointers is what so god by bringing you here he's establishing you anybody clear and he's also anointing you everybody here who has also what not only does he establish you in the truth not only does he announce you but he's also doing right selling you everybody clear let's continue who has also sealed us and do what the water of the in-hour so he is also giving you the down payment when they give you the down payment it means that you have not paid everything in fuel [Applause] amen but the down payment gives you power to get the key to your house amen the down payment gives you power to put your name on the deal the down payment gives you power to live in the house the down payment gives you power to call the house my house the down payment gives you power to tell somebody get off my property amen press the name of the lord in acts chapter 10 verse 38 the bible says how who did what anointed who so jesus was also anointed everybody there jesus was also born again they asked him he said yes you're gonna be baptized with the same how god anointed jesus christ with the water and with what so when we speak about anointing here we are not talking about pentecostal anointing an anointing that drop on your flesh but your life does not change this anointing here is an anointing that gives you what the holy ghost and gives you what power who went about doing what why was he doing good anybody there and what oh that was what do you have any record of jesus healing somebody before jordan he only discussed with the priest at the temple anybody there anybody there so doing good and healing all that were oppressed of what for what was what why how was god with him god came by the best everybody clear so when you are born of the holy ghost amen the holy ghost bring you power to cast out the devil power to lay hand on the people and the people must be healed if a false anointed one can heal the sick how much more you amen if judah can cast out devils if judah can heal the sick and judah was a child of hell how much more you that have a representation we are living below our privileges amen the holy ghost gives you the power the holy ghost gives you the down payment you have a right to tell anybody on your property to get out because you have the air master you have the earnest of the resurrection when your child is sick tell the devil get out when my wife is sick tell the devil get out when my husband is sick tell the devil get out when my family is sick tell that devil get out stand on your feet it is your god-given right how are you sitting and your son is still sick how are you praying and your wife is sick amen and your husband is sick and you are living like nothing happened you are acting like nothing happened you are acting like everything is normal that is not right it must put you to desperation where is the god of elijah father i believe your word why am i suffering like this either you must show me where i did wrong all my wife or my husband must be here [Applause] hallelujah that was the condition of esther sitting in the palace and herman is causing all kind of damages and monika told her think that when you are quiet because you are good you don't see you don't feel the pain of your husband you don't feel the pain of your wife you don't feel the pain of your child wait till that pen gets you then you will be looking for somebody to pray for you hallelujah second corinthians chapter five for we that are in this world we are right here which is the flesh do what why do they groan why is he groaning in the body because something is wrong amen do groan being water you are carrying somebody that is causing you trouble all the time not for that we will be unclothed we are not saying this to die that's not what we are saying but we want to be what that's what maybe swallow up in what so paul is saying that i am here but when i'm here i am groaning i want somebody to get the black dog away from me amen when the black dog goes out then mortality will be swallowed up with water praise the name of the lord verse 9 5 now he that will do what wrote us for the same thing is what in other words the one that predestinated you for the change of the body or for the deliverance of the black dog it is god that already done that so this seed will not lay quiet until you reach your perfect position hallelujah he that wrote us who prepare us for the self the self the self same thing is god who also has what unto us the word so when they give you the earnest of the spirit it is not a stop it is just the beginning toward a goal the goal is that when you reach this is we start from birth the number two the number three the goal is that on the outside you have a white dog and on an east side you have a white dog white and white they won't fight anymore amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go up here in philippians 1 6 the bible said being confident of this very same thing that he that water are you following me are you following me so he that did what everybody there who that began a what so he that already started by giving you the holy ghost by anointing you by selling you by giving you the down payment by establishing you he's not gonna stop his work whether you like it or not he's going to push you all the way to the end he doesn't keep he doesn't depend on you anymore because he already claimed you you don't belong on your own if you don't understand he opened the door set and struck you sickness you fell down i'm sorry father i won't do it again why is everybody fine and and i'm the one struggling a pre-paul prisoner prisoner poor prisoner of jesus christ you want to go this way but somebody's doing that not you let's go this way amen you get on the highway exit exit you don't want the car tire flat boom i told you to exit everybody clear who we which has begun a what will do what he will finish it until what so the day of redemption the day of the rapture he's gonna finish what he started hallelujah ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in whom he also did what we talked about this on wednesday after that he what faith cometh by what the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after you what believe right here you are what still right here of what of what the promise is unto you and to your children as many as the lord your god shall water until the water which is the offer what the down payment until the what of the purchase what so paul is telling you when they sell you your work is not done until the purchase of processing when god take everything under control everybody clear praise the name of the lord so once your inner man is sealed with the holy spirit we found out that the amalekite came as soon as israel went and then drunk the water from refugees then brother branham said that what happened with the top of the indian chief where we have the black dog and the white dog let's go back to romans 7. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you need your bible when you come to church i put some scripture on the board to help you not to look at too much but you still need your bible in this church amen romans 7 if you dare you can say amen let's jump to verse 18 to save time for i know that's in me this is paul converted that is in my water there's no good thing why can't he says that because the black dog is still there for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i found not for the good that i would i that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more either do it but what so paul is talking about sin dwelling in him paul is not saying that he's a sinner he's talking about sin in the flesh the black dog anybody there verse 21 i found them alone that when i will do good evil is present with me for a delight in the law of god after the what the inside man but i see another law in my member flesh what is he doing warring against the law of what so the wall of the americans start within yourself because you drank water from refuge then amalek attacked you are you there but we're going to see the end of amalek are you there warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into what to the law of what which is where so this black dog his purpose he's trying to bring you back to point one anybody there this one is pulling this way this one is pulling this way and you ride in the middle of a fight when you understand you won't be complaining about your life anymore when you look you say yes i know you you're a black dog you're going to go to church whether you hurt or not let's go to church there is ice outside it's too cold we're going to go to church [Applause] they say the number goes up i'm going to put a mask and go to church you put a mask you go to work right put a mask and come to church are you there worrying against the love of my mind and bringing me into what i've seen people doing that i seen brother come in here and his sister wearing their mask no problem and they were coming to church no problem we appreciate that they don't want to stay home they come they put masks and they sit there no problem because they want to show that therefore even though you do what you're doing i'm going to be there when they say they say god bless you and i'm happy oh i'm happy i saw them amen bringing me into captivity to the lord of sin which is in man now paul is crying now like david he said all wretched man that i am i can be wretched he is saved amen wretched one is pulling one is pulling anybody there who shall deliver me from what the body of this water so he's not crying about who shall deliver me from my soul because i'm a sinner but the one he's crying about who shall delivering me from the black dog because the black dog becomes sticky to my walking quest he's the one that get on my way that's why brother branham said the greatest enemy i have is who that enemy was not this one this was brother branham the brother brand and the enemy was here amen don't misinterpret the prophet brother branham he say he is his greatest enemy and we are lifting up brother branham let's go to collection chapter 5 misinterpreting the prophet when you have a light do you put it in the bushel huh where do you put the light and the messenger is what do we put the messenger in the bushes way up today let's go to galatians chapter five if you're there you can say amen verse 16. this i said then work in what this is paul now he's telling us what to do because in chapter eight of uh of roman at the beginning he said therefore there is what don't be condemning yourself we are in this fight together you understand now walk in water why was the gold ghost given by four this is satan walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the water go according to the white dog ignore the black dog do you follow me follow the white dog he's the one that's gonna fight not you amen there was one time a sister that went to a meeting at night the only goes just drop it amen that sister finish she was late she began to go back home and as she goes back home everybody in the house there was a man in the dark following her she was a sister she got afraid right somebody's following me she kept moving somebody's following me she kept moving somebody's following she was coming from church amen do you know what god did suddenly a dog came out a man i begin to park and as the dog is barking the robber become afraid and the sister is progressing so the dog moves with the sister and keep the eye on the rabbit until the sister get home then the dog turn around that's why you are still until the day of work the white dog is watching the devil keep moving in your life keep progressing with christ don't worry about it we pay too much attention to the black dog and the more attention you pay to him you give him power starve him starve him give him things he doesn't like then the white dog becomes powerful then keep moving on your business looking unto jesus the altar and the finisher of you [Applause] let's go back then i said then walk in the spirit where am i at okay now i was looking at the time before somebody else gathered lose a wing or something walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh last step against what do you see that here the black dog is fighting the white dog we make it simple until a child can see that and the spirit against her so the war is not you god and satan are worrying you are just the battleground amen and these are what they want to what so that you cannot do the things that you in other words by nature the black dog is opposite of the white dog in other words don't try to look for negotiation between them do you follow me don't compromise on your faith that when you start compromising you begin to grieve the holy ghost because the holy ghost will never compromise with the devil that's why godly sorrow bring unto what repentance the holy ghost make you grief so that when you go home i feel bad the way i talk to him it is the holy spirit go repair are you there that is not your nature everybody there go to first peter chapter two hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord first peter chapter two he comes after james first peter chapter 2 verse 9. everybody there amen verse nine but here what predestination do you see that it starts from there amen a royal what a what a peculiar what strange that's why you can fit anywhere don't even force it when somebody look at you they say you don't belong to this place just get out amen that you should shove off the water of him who has called you out of what he took you out of this anybody following me he called you out of number one out of darkness into his marvelous water which in time past were not a people because you were black black dark dark are you there but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as what now paul is telling you you stranger to this world because this world is set in hidden it is based on the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the proud of what in other words this present world cooperate very well with the black dog that's why you are not comfortable in the world anymore as comfortable as you want to make yourself live god will let you see something and you say man we need to go we need to go to heaven this world is not good because only the black dog will like the world that's why jesus said a paul said if you loved her and the things of the the love of god is not even what it means you have a problem with your birth because paul says that the holy ghost shed the love of god in your heart but if you love the word and the things of the world you are actually making cooperation with the black dog everybody clear praise the name oh so now when you see worldliness stay away from it amen where am i at okay oh 11. dearly beloved i beseech you as what and what just like abraham because he was looking at the city which builder and thunder was who it is not gastonia north carolina it is the new jerusalem amen abstain from what i'll stand from the black dog anybody there abstain from flesh last comma which do what a malachite i want you to look at in your bible young people look at it don't wait till you go home and review it again get it amen which do what why against what do you see now why are they worrying against the soul if the if if their nature and your soul nature are the same the reason why they are worrying because the occupant of the soul now is not on the same nature they want to take over that nature so peter is saying that be careful there is a black dog there where the lust is worrying about the soul which saw the soul of the one that has been sealed with the holy spirit everybody clear so when that happened moses called who joshua amen everybody knows who joshua is what is joshua anybody there who's doing the fight here and who need to do the fight let's go here now unto him who is that him christ that is able to do what from what this holy ghost here not only give you power to cast out devil but he also gives you a power of protection the holy ghost comes to block you from falling if you fall you somehow you were feeding the black dog you start talking to a woman that is not a message believer you start chatting with her you thought you're going to bring her to church she became very good and she changed her pen she began to wear dresses she began to wear skirt but her skirt are tight they are skirt to deceive but it's tight because it's showing the shape amen and you keep tempering with that woman and don't understand that you are feeding the black dog everybody there until young people you gonna find yourself in the bed of fornication impregnating a woman amen that's why the holy ghost him that is able to keep you from what because remember throughout the battle the hand of moses was going up and down are you there do you remember the bible never said that the hand of moses was always up they were going up and down if he goes down amalek is getting grounded if he goes up because the forces of gravitation the worldly forces were pulling to weaken moses but thank god amen there is another priesthood amen i'm not sure it's nearly here and now there the way to the way of reception [Applause] amen guaranteed amen 100 guaranteed in other words god have a spirit of cruise control he just put grip and the speed still going on him that is ever to do what keep you from falling and to present you what so the holy ghost is working in your life protecting you keeping you until he's gonna present you to god without fault let the holy spirit work in your life don't argue with the holy spirit even though you like what the black dog is showing say i won't do it amen brother branham say marriage is not when you're going on a trip you say i'm going to the trip if i hear you were talking to a man on facebook it is over but random say that's not it and the wife looked at you and said yes you're going there if i hear that you are smiling to the horses no more gamer or the woman at the other at the hotel there don't come back home that's not what marriage brother branham say even though i know amen i am going but because i left somebody there it is based on love i am not going to break my covenant with my wife i am not going to break my covenant with my husband whether there is security camera or not i'm gonna be still true to the marriage covenant [Applause] because you know why people play on the internet because they can hide their identity do you know why people put bad comments in our sermon because they call themselves under different names tell them to put their name if you are bold enough to speak up come out with your name why are you hiding speak out say i am so-and-so i am the one that is writing that but they're hiding amen my god first john chapter 5 for whatsoever is what you remember john 1 whatsoever is what number two overcometh what this is guaranteed and this is the victory that overcometh the word even our what what is faith anybody okay what is faith faith is something that is what that is not yet but you believe it will be the word interpreting the word amen faith is uh of the world you understand the purpose of god for your life hallelujah what's his faith expression faith is a water from who ephesians say it is a gift of what peter flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but who now faith is a revelation there is where i want to stay there just a moment it is a revelation he has revealed it to you by his it is what nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into what may i have the faith faith is coming faith is coming fairfield's coming fairfield's coming how do you crank your car in the morning who told you your car is going to be cranked faithful amen faith hallelujah you ever have faith it is give it's give to you by the grace of god and god reveals it to you therefore faith is whatever that's why when satan was attacking peter jesus said peter i pray for you because peter had the revelation of who christ was he said i'm gonna pray for you that your faith will not fail and peter went and made three mistakes when jesus christ resurrected he said god tell my disciple and who peter god tell him i still love him god tell him i pray for him hallelujah and the whole church of god is built upon the revelation they were all good people we shall say there is some that is trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all another it's by grace it is just what given to them now there is the difference we don't want you to work for faith lord help my unbelief that's all amen jude 1 we're going with faith paul was done here in the natural realm with his phd see he didn't know he had an intellectual faith but he didn't have water there is quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith than a divine faithful you get the intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of who jesus christ to you that does what so the faith here is the one that killed the black dog that is the faith that overcome the world because he already overcome your world nature in your soul he's gonna shoot the black dog in your flesh intellectual faith is not enough that's all right because you must understand what they're preaching to you but it only brings you to the what holy spirit the holy spirit is a what personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration regeneration making a new world a new creature in what you are here you are no more the man that was over there because that nature is what dead what is the new birth then break it down you say well brother branham what is the new birth it is the water of jesus christ water to what it is your own personal anchor not mama's faithful not that is faith not pastor's faith your own faith god doesn't have child grandchildren i come to the message church you need to be born again are you there but christ amen not you join the church you shook a hand you done something different you say the creed you promise to live by a code of rule that's the law but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place is what you can be given a hundred thousand tips of videos of people rejecting the message it won't do you nothing because it is not your faith and his faith it is the white dog faithful and anything that is contrary to him he's gonna shoot it [Applause] and you see people telling you you don't see you say i don't see what you're talking about look here you don't see i don't see what you're talking about because it's a shield it's a protection it is a bumper it is a token the deafender cannot touch you because you are sealed until the day of redemption hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah no matter what anybody says what takes place it's what pastor you read between the line priests whatever it might be it is who that is the revelation that the church is built to act hallelujah the new birth is uh the new birth is christ is uh god has revealed to you this great mystery and that is the new birth now what are you going to do when you get all this group out together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same action the same thing that he did making the world water oh if the church only knew what why do you have to know your position if esther would only understood who she is how can you be a queen and they tell you go to your husband and you're afraid oh if i go there he didn't call me he's going to kill me nev if esther really understand the position amen it takes the ministry of mother child to reveal esther the position that she's already in [Applause] mordecai say if you don't go deliverance will come for somewhere when esther was going maybe she said oh my god god help me god help me god help me i don't know what he's gonna say maybe when he get there he's gonna say who told you to come today instead of that when the king says oh my god what the surprise come over here what do you want to the half of my kingdom if esther knew her position [Applause] a man will not play gamer amen oh if the church only knew it's what it will one day you're gonna come to that because it's program it's predestinated he will one day and when it happens then the word so this stage of redemption of casting the black dog is the rapture [Music] amen but to get to this edge you must go through understanding your position [Music] [Applause] when you understand your position in christ the devil begin to get afraid of you [Music] [Applause] are you with me when you understand who you are with god the devil back off hallelujah a will one day then what will god when he what hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but to the church let me stop the new birth is what right here are we there the new birth is what faith that faith bring the holy spirit it's the faith that takes care of the inner man your new birth watch there but to the church not any kind of church their pride in the message of the yahweh the what is what [Music] i thought the faith the revelation bring you the birth are you understanding me do you listen to me so that same faith that brings you the birth are you there it will take that same faith to bring you the rapture if the same spirit that raised christ from there if he dwell in you it will also do what cast the black dog away quicken your motor body by the same spirit that dwell in what so this breath is a package it's the seventh seal he unfold and bring five then he open up then bring five then he open up and bring fire then he up it's gaining ground every day that's why paul said i die as he died daily the white dog move on the white could not move on the white dog until the day of your redemption where am i yet lord hallelujah to the church the brother the rapture is what it is what that the revelation the true blood of christ will be what for that water of the world just like he took faith to kill this guy it's gonna take first to kill the second guy you see this caught the revelation thereafter is a revelation we don't understand what it means now it's a revelation for the revelation is faithful you cannot have a revelation without it being faithful faith is a revelation because it's something that is revealed too faith is a water faith is something that has been revealed to you like he was to who that could call anything contrary to what has been revealed to him as though he was not in other words it's not on my calendar i don't accept it everybody there we heard this one let's jump to galatians 4 6 and because you are what god has sent forth the spirit of his word into your what crying what stop because you are sons god send the anointing the spirit the spirit is doing what crying

sending you sounds like brother robert caught it anybody there romans 14 verse 36 oh mark i'm sorry 14 36 thank god i'm not brother branham because if he was brother brother he says mark he says mark 14. he say roman 14 then you begin to argue that's what we have on tape and then we begin to argue it's not in the scripture it's not in the scripture and you leave the message [Laughter] remark chapter 14 verse 36 are you there and he said who's saying jesus are you tired you took my time when you took your when you did your vote because the vote is the church so i need my time back are you there and he said how about what who's saying abba father the son of god because you are son that's why you are joined if he cry out by father you're gonna cry also abba father because it's the same

overcame the black dog are you there when the white dog overcame the black dog you never seen jesus complaining going to the cross they struck him questioned him it was not him that was overcoming the black the white dog took control amen when they whip him he's still going they carry the cross he's still going that strength to go all the way there it takes the supremacy full total surrendering of your will the black dog to the will of the white dog everybody there because you are sons he sent his spirit in your heart crying what the first who cried this christ let's go to romans 8 now

so-and-so you live over there on the right side here you have a female trouble shoot out but i keep under water i'm fighting i am choking the black dog that's poor i keep under my water and bring it into what how do you bring it to subjection paul lest that by any means when i have preached to other i myself should be working because if you don't keep the black dog under control you might find yourself you left the highway because he's there his purpose is to pull you back here are you there psalm 68 that has ascended on high that have led captivity captive it seems like i'm heading to the airport they had to receive gifts from men for their water pentecostal anointing even rebellious pickup gift their life is not correct that the lord god might dwell among what joshua and joshua disconfired amalek and his people with the word joshua uses the sword joshua is a type of water does the holy ghost need the sword ephesians 6 17 and take the water and the water so the spirit have a sword joshua need the sword the sword of the spirit which is what that's why you need to feed joshua with the world oh my god god loves the truth and the truth just set you free god wants you to know the truth christ is the truth amen and if the holy ghost is in you he feeds on what he needs the soldier and not on what and true story magazine and what you are feeding the black dog then how can you say you can stay home and be just as good christian as you will be at church one month don't come to church three months don't come to church four months don't come to church you still believe us to believe that you're a christian thank god some are at home but they are streaming that's good praise god as long as you stay consistency with streaming and a legitimate reason either a pandemic or maybe something in the body you're not feeling right as long as you stay consistent that's fine but you cannot be at home and don't follow up the sermon and you still expect to be a good christian then how can you say you can stay home and be just as good christian as he will be a church you can do it read the water the holy spirit feeds on what the sword of the spirit the bible is god's spiritual water for his the holy spirit is the one who brings it to you and place it in there and with thanksgiving you do what anybody there oh my god let's take roman six i got a job somewhere it's still loaded everybody okay i'm looking for the airport to help my gps roman chapter 6 i'm going to be done soon romans chapter 6 verse 2 if you dare you can say amen god forbid how shall we that are what we are here to death to sin that nature was taken out how can we that are dead to sin live any longer what in other words you cannot be in this stage and still enjoy sin this stage is a stage of fight with sinner not condoning with sin job to verse 11 4 in that he uh likewise work on you also yourself to be what paul say remember acknowledge that you are already dead to sin it is important amen dead to sin but a love to god through what watch verse 12 young people let not what we're talking about the black dog anybody follow me let not sin therefore do what he's dead but don't let him take over do you follow me because the one who reign is the king let the white dog reign not the black dog you follow me let not sin reign in your word don't let the black dog take over young people that you should do what in the last day of neither yield your water as instrument of water to what but yield yourself to water as those that are alive from there number one and you remember as an instrument of what do you see don't take your body to play with women don't take your body to play with men your body is not for adultery it's not for fornication paul said it is not good for a man to touch a woman if you want to do it get married i'm not going to change my word you have cell phone you get computer i'm going to talk to you straight what you see on internet is more deadly than this verse 14 for sin shall not have what are you seeing do you see that dominion over you for you are not under the word but you under what praise the name of the lord what then shall we sin because we are under the law but not under grace watch now watch now 16 know you not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey the black dog his servant you are to whom you will be whether of what to death you see that the black dog or of what to righteousness the white dog but beef god be frank that you were the servant of sin number one but you have obeyed from the what for that form of doctrine which was what you believe it you moved to to to everybody there be mad free from water you become the servant of what i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your because the black dog is buffeting you on the flesh that's why i want you to understand amen for us you have yield your member servant to uncleanness as you are going to the nightclub doing all kind of life now that you change kingdom by the new birth this is what i'm recommending you to do do you understand servant to uncleanness and to iniquity even so now yield your member servant to what to do what for when you were the servant of sin you are free from righteousness what fruit have you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed because you a christian you begin to look at your old life and you don't want to see it you take the picture you burn amen and for the end of those things is what the pale horse but now being made free from sin and become servant of god you have your fruit to water and the end what let me drop this and then we go to the airport go to roman uh we already been uh go to roman uh eight and i head to the airport hallelujah are you there so then 88 so then that out in the

by any means you have not his spirit he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is what because of what but the spirit is what because of what jump to verse 12. therefore brethren we are not we are not under obligation do you follow me we are not depth not to flesh to live after death for if you live after the flesh you shall do what but if through you through the spirit through joshua not you through joshua through the spirit do what it is joshua that is maintaining your body you see now through the spirit do multiply the deed of first you shall do what oh my god go to roman 12 you
