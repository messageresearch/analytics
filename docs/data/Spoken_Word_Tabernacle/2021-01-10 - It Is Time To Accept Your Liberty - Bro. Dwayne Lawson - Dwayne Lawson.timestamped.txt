[57:36] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[57:40] and amen and God bless you as you could
[57:43] be seated this morning uh I want to
[57:46] speak to you just a little bit today on
[57:48] this subject and um here from The Book
[57:50] of Romans and I I I would if I would
[57:53] take a title I want to uh speak to to
[57:56] you about this amen it's time to accept
[58:00] your Liberty it's time to accept your
[58:05] Liberty do you know there is nothing
[58:07] this morning that I can preach to you of
[58:10] Redemptive rights is nothing that I can
[58:12] preach to you that is not already paid
[58:15] for do you know there's nothing that I
[58:17] could say to you this morning and
[58:19] promise uh whether it be healing or
[58:22] salvation or Deliverance uh everything
[58:25] that God has to offer is already been
[58:29] paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ a
[58:33] prophet will teach us that he died at
[58:35] Calvary and he paid the Supreme price
[58:38] all the Redemptive blessings that he
[58:40] died for at Calvary is already paid for
[58:44] before God the debt is fully paid and
[58:47] you're excused before God you've been
[58:50] taken out of the pawn shop that's right
[58:52] the only thing you have to do is accept
[58:54] it in faith and Christ
[58:56] and walk out of the pawn shop that's all
[58:59] do you know that everything that God has
[59:01] done and is going to do has already been
[59:05] done for you and the only thing left is
[59:08] for you to accept it by faith do you
[59:10] know there's nothing here this morning
[59:12] amen that God can do he's already done
[59:15] it he done it that day at Calvary so the
[59:18] only thing that can happen at this point
[59:21] in our Christian experiences is that God
[59:24] would send a word
[59:26] and that word would ignite a faith and
[59:29] by faith you would begin to believe that
[59:32] my body is healed that my life is saved
[59:35] and that my sin debts have been paid and
[59:37] when you get your faith high enough amen
[59:40] there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:43] that will settle upon the word of God
[59:46] that has already been confirmed in the
[59:48] age amen the Holy Ghost amen it's not
[59:51] something amen that just comes the Holy
[59:54] Ghost is something that comes upon the
[59:57] word of God in your belief in a finished
[1:00:00] work at Calvary if Jesus Christ was
[1:00:03] wearing my suit this morning he would
[1:00:06] have to say it's finished 2,000 years
[1:00:09] ago he announced it from calvary's Cross
[1:00:13] amen it is finished amen the sin that is
[1:00:17] paid amen amen the life amen of Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ was offered that your sicknesses
[1:00:23] are healed that sins curs has been
[1:00:27] destroyed the Spells have been broken
[1:00:30] everything the devil has against you has
[1:00:33] already been broken are you hearing me
[1:00:36] church it's finished uh the word of God
[1:00:39] has announced it he announced it from
[1:00:42] calvary's Cross and how could he come
[1:00:45] this morning and say anything else
[1:00:47] brother let me tell you it's not coming
[1:00:50] it's already here and if our faith can
[1:00:53] reach out this morning the angels of God
[1:00:56] are here the power of God is here the
[1:00:59] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:03] here it's right here in the building
[1:01:05] this morning behold I stand at the door
[1:01:08] and knock and if any man will open up
[1:01:11] his heart I will come in unto
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] him and this is not something that's on
[1:01:18] its
[1:01:20] way it's something that is
[1:01:23] here and if we're not a part of it
[1:01:26] then that means we need to open up our
[1:01:28] hearts right now and say God I'm aware
[1:01:31] of your divine presence and this this
[1:01:33] this world that I'm living in amen
[1:01:36] cannot recognize amen but there's
[1:01:38] something about the inspiration of the
[1:01:40] Bride of Jesus Christ that's been
[1:01:43] released in this hour and a prophet said
[1:01:45] this he said what you ought to do is you
[1:01:48] ought to pray until you know my
[1:01:50] inspiration until you feel the
[1:01:53] inspiration that he is present the
[1:01:56] scripture tells us that Christ is
[1:01:58] present right now he is the omnipresent
[1:02:01] God right now if there's anything that
[1:02:04] is declaring to you that he's not here
[1:02:07] that it's a lie it's contrary to the
[1:02:10] word of God Amen I know right now that
[1:02:13] the angels of God are here they're
[1:02:16] encamped about them that fear the lord
[1:02:18] the presence of God is here it's in the
[1:02:21] building right now let the inspiration
[1:02:23] fall on the church that can say he's
[1:02:26] here I declare amen by Divine
[1:02:30] Vindication that the god that can change
[1:02:32] lives the god that can change Hearts is
[1:02:35] right here in the building this
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:42] morning I'm talking about something with
[1:02:44] power I'm not talking about some little
[1:02:46] mansy pansy something somebody come up
[1:02:48] with in their mind I'm not talking about
[1:02:50] a watered down gospel I'm talking about
[1:02:52] a straight laac power from the old High
[1:02:56] that come into the Church of the Living
[1:02:57] God well there's some men that's not
[1:03:00] scared to qualify the word in the age
[1:03:02] you're living in that they're ready to
[1:03:04] vindicate the word of God and the time
[1:03:07] that they're living
[1:03:11] in do you know this is a beautiful time
[1:03:13] to live do you know this is the best
[1:03:15] time there is to live do you know nobody
[1:03:17] ever lived in a time like you're living
[1:03:19] right now do you know the Bible declares
[1:03:21] the holy prophets declare that there has
[1:03:24] never been a day like this day there has
[1:03:27] never been a time like this time there
[1:03:30] ain't never anybody set in the seat
[1:03:33] you're set an in there nobody ever heard
[1:03:36] the power of the Gospel the way you have
[1:03:39] people like to fantasize and they like
[1:03:41] to say well back in the days of this guy
[1:03:44] and back in the days of this guy and
[1:03:46] there ain't nobody ever amen don't you
[1:03:48] under underestimate or diminish the
[1:03:51] experience that God has given you by
[1:03:54] looking at another age and wishing this
[1:03:57] age was like that age but there's never
[1:03:59] been another people on the planet come
[1:04:01] on Church you know what I'm telling you
[1:04:04] is the truth the Bible said that your
[1:04:06] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:08] Life from before the foundation of the
[1:04:10] world so there's millions of people in
[1:04:12] that book amen there's millions of
[1:04:15] people in that book amen from the
[1:04:17] beginning of time every redeemed of God
[1:04:19] is in that book but you are the first
[1:04:22] church you are the first people that
[1:04:24] actually knows that your name is in
[1:04:26] there while you're living everybody else
[1:04:29] found about when they died amen but
[1:04:32] while you're yet alive God is requiring
[1:04:35] you to see your name in the Lamb's Book
[1:04:38] of Life we should ignite a Revival like
[1:04:41] nobody's ever
[1:04:44] saw this not going to be a worldwide
[1:04:47] Revival because it's not meant to the
[1:04:50] world but to
[1:04:52] them that have their name in the Book of
[1:04:56] Life they're going to hear our voices in
[1:04:59] heaven they're going to hear our voices
[1:05:01] on the earth and everything there in is
[1:05:03] going to hear I John say Amen that the
[1:05:06] lamb is worthy to take away the sins of
[1:05:10] the world you're going to hear me say
[1:05:12] You're going to hear this bride singing
[1:05:14] a different song brother we're not
[1:05:16] crying about the sins of yesterday we're
[1:05:19] not crying about the days going by amen
[1:05:22] there's been a change we've seen the
[1:05:24] book open up and I heard myself begin to
[1:05:28] say the lamb is worthy and we shall and
[1:05:32] we shall and we shall rain on this
[1:05:37] Earth You got to see those little
[1:05:39] changes in scripture you got to pick
[1:05:41] them up Revelations the first chapter
[1:05:43] said the time is at hand didn't it say
[1:05:45] that amen and and when he's writing
[1:05:47] Revelations 1 John begins to say that
[1:05:49] the lamb has washed the church Loos the
[1:05:52] church in his own blood is that right it
[1:05:55] said he loosed it in his own blood and
[1:05:57] he shall rain on the earth Revelations 1
[1:06:00] and he shall reign on the earth the
[1:06:01] blood of the Lamb has loosed you and the
[1:06:04] lamb shall rain on the Earth but in
[1:06:06] Revelation chapter 5 John saw it from a
[1:06:08] different view after the book was open
[1:06:11] and he realized the blood was for him he
[1:06:14] then begin to say we shall reign it's
[1:06:16] not just Jesus shall reign but we shall
[1:06:19] reign do you recognize as the Bride of
[1:06:21] Jesus Christ you're just as spotless as
[1:06:24] the Lamb of of God God is not looking at
[1:06:27] you he's looking at the lamb God is not
[1:06:30] looking at you he's looking at the power
[1:06:33] of the lamb and if you would quit
[1:06:35] looking at you and start looking at the
[1:06:37] lamb your faith would get into a place
[1:06:40] that you could say under this mountain
[1:06:42] be thou moved your faith will begin to
[1:06:44] reach to a place and every disease and
[1:06:47] every devil and every Power will be
[1:06:50] subject to the
[1:06:53] church hey
[1:06:56] I don't know about you but I wore my
[1:06:57] dancing shoes this morning amen the
[1:07:00] power of God is still Justice real this
[1:07:03] morning as it ever
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:07] was listen the days of former religion
[1:07:09] is behind us amen the days of just some
[1:07:13] intellectual something is behind us this
[1:07:15] is a bride's anointing it's a bride's
[1:07:18] Jubilee it's a bride Revival
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:26] oh this message ain't calm down this
[1:07:29] message ain't lost its power amen amen
[1:07:32] this message is as powerful as it's ever
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:39] been to them that are drawn to it it's
[1:07:42] still the greatest drawing power it's
[1:07:45] still the greatest anointing to them
[1:07:47] that are ordained to it they still
[1:07:50] realize that it's the resurrection of
[1:07:53] God do you know God sets a Time
[1:07:56] God actually sets
[1:07:58] times he's a timekeeper God's a he sets
[1:08:01] a time and he's never late to an
[1:08:03] appointment he's never missed an
[1:08:07] appointment you might think he's late
[1:08:09] but he
[1:08:10] ain't it took him four days to get to
[1:08:12] Lazarus grave but little did we know he
[1:08:15] was writing prophecy amen that in the
[1:08:17] fourth day in the time of restoration
[1:08:20] that the light would come in the evening
[1:08:21] time and a resurrection would bring
[1:08:23] Lazarus out of the Grave by voice not
[1:08:26] the whole grave one man not the whole
[1:08:28] Cemetery one man but Jesus knew his name
[1:08:32] and when he called his name he called a
[1:08:34] Revival in the middle of a leard Dean
[1:08:36] cemetery and do you know God still has
[1:08:39] the same power to call a Revival in the
[1:08:42] middle of this Leia in the middle of a
[1:08:45] dead dark denominational world the light
[1:08:49] of Jesus Christ has returned to the
[1:08:51] Earth in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:08:54] and I believe this morning we can salute
[1:08:56] the return of Jesus Christ in the form
[1:09:00] of the pillar of fire and he's here to
[1:09:03] lead a bride back to every Redemptive

[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:11] church I feel like flying I feel like
[1:09:14] walking in another dimension amen this
[1:09:17] is a dimension changing message this is
[1:09:19] an anointing that comes from another
[1:09:22] world this is not a Pentecostal
[1:09:24] anointing this is not a lay de seal
[1:09:27] anointing this is a bride anointing it's
[1:09:29] a seven seal anointing it's a seven
[1:09:32] Thunder anointing it's the power of God
[1:09:36] that will change every life and every
[1:09:40] [Applause]
[1:09:42] heart if you don't think it's powerful
[1:09:45] just let it in your heart just let it in
[1:09:48] your
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:53] life why you well go ahead and praise
[1:09:56] him this is your hour to do
[1:10:02] it yeah God said
[1:10:07] sometimes and the wheels of
[1:10:10] Prophecy keep the timing of
[1:10:14] God do you know you got to work within
[1:10:16] the limits of what God
[1:10:18] sets the time and season he sets it
[1:10:22] God's word is just as true in any age
[1:10:24] but then there comes a
[1:10:26] season that that word is to be fulfilled
[1:10:30] you you go back you go back and watch
[1:10:32] Moses's life every one of us in here
[1:10:34] knows Moses was born the
[1:10:37] prophet he was the seed amen of the
[1:10:41] deliverer of Israel that had been
[1:10:43] prophesied over Abraham that I should
[1:10:46] deliver thee with a mighty hand and
[1:10:49] after
[1:10:49] 400 years God had lazed up a man that
[1:10:54] was ordained to lead them out but watch
[1:10:58] God do something for you and me show the
[1:11:01] failure of human intellect and the
[1:11:04] training of humanism because Moses had
[1:11:07] been trained 40 years by the greatest
[1:11:10] men that live by the greatest education
[1:11:13] amen and God showed us that education
[1:11:17] even will make a profit fail if he leans
[1:11:19] up it amen look Moses failed leaning on
[1:11:24] education and went and killed one man
[1:11:26] and God run him out in the desert he
[1:11:28] lived out in the desert 40 years to
[1:11:31] figure out that Moses ain't going to be
[1:11:33] the one that delivers the children of
[1:11:35] Israel amen Pharaoh is not going to be
[1:11:37] the one that delivers the children of
[1:11:38] Israel God is said I will deliver them
[1:11:42] with a mighty hand I'm going to do this
[1:11:44] work Moses I just need to borrow your
[1:11:48] body I don't need your mind I don't need
[1:11:51] your understanding I need your Humanity
[1:11:54] amen because God had to get into a man
[1:11:57] amen to lay a
[1:12:01] platform you you all know the story and
[1:12:04] you know that Moses spent 40 years in
[1:12:05] that desert till he seen that
[1:12:08] light do you know Moses had beg to
[1:12:11] forget about the promise of
[1:12:15] Deliverance Moses had beg to forget that
[1:12:17] God had made those kind of promises you
[1:12:20] know why he forgot it because in his
[1:12:21] humanism he tried it and it didn't work
[1:12:25] do you know there's been a many people
[1:12:27] that have tried out the power of God in
[1:12:30] their human intellect and they go read
[1:12:32] about it and they come out and try it
[1:12:34] and if it fails all of a sudden
[1:12:35] Something's Wrong With God all of a
[1:12:38] sudden something's wrong with a message
[1:12:39] something's wrong with God Amen and what
[1:12:41] it is is a man gets in his flesh and
[1:12:43] decides he wants something to happen and
[1:12:45] if it don't happen then there's got to
[1:12:46] be something wrong amen but if we would
[1:12:49] surrender our beings unto the god of
[1:12:51] Abraham to everything there is a time
[1:12:54] and to everything there is a season amen
[1:12:56] I do nothing until I see it with my
[1:12:59] father but when the father sends the
[1:13:02] vision there is a liberty Amen to
[1:13:05] manifest every
[1:13:09] promise now now you know now you know
[1:13:11] amen you know that the prophet said five
[1:13:13] minutes in the presence of that burning
[1:13:15] bush give Moses more than all the
[1:13:17] schools of
[1:13:18] Egypt five minutes in the presence of
[1:13:20] that burning bush what did it do it
[1:13:22] ignited the ordination of his life and
[1:13:25] it gave him what he was lacking what did
[1:13:28] the pillar of fire give to Moses it gave
[1:13:30] him a
[1:13:32] revelation of the will of
[1:13:35] God in the season that God was going to
[1:13:39] do
[1:13:40] it you see what it did it imparted to
[1:13:43] him a direct Revelation that this is the
[1:13:46] time this is the season of it do you see
[1:13:49] what the bride Church did back
[1:13:51] throughout the church ages do you see
[1:13:53] what they did Mark 11's been laying this
[1:13:55] Bible all throughout from from the time
[1:13:57] of Jesus until today and men have tried
[1:14:01] that and they've tried that and they
[1:14:03] tried that until they got people
[1:14:05] believing that it was just a mountain of
[1:14:07] sin it's just a mountain of this it's
[1:14:09] it's just a mountain of that that's all
[1:14:11] all the Mount of Olives means but when
[1:14:13] Jesus said if you say on this mountain
[1:14:14] he's pointing at a mountain he wasn't
[1:14:16] pointing at an imagination or a spirit
[1:14:19] he was pointing at a mountain and when
[1:14:20] he said to the Fig Tree I curse you it
[1:14:23] was an actual tree that the left the
[1:14:26] thing because the authority of the
[1:14:28] spoken word was being imparted to the
[1:14:31] Church of the Living God and everybody
[1:14:33] thought that it was in the season of
[1:14:36] those disciples but do you recognize
[1:14:38] that God will make a promise to one man
[1:14:40] and fulfill it to
[1:14:42] another come on now you you know I'm
[1:14:44] telling you the truth when God called
[1:14:46] Abraham he said I'll give you the land
[1:14:49] I'm going to give you the land you know
[1:14:50] the book of Acts says that Abraham never
[1:14:52] even stepped in that land he never
[1:14:54] possessed that land Abraham never
[1:14:56] possessed the land that God said but God
[1:14:59] called Abraham but it wasn't until under
[1:15:02] Joshua that the children of Israel
[1:15:05] possessed the land that God gave them
[1:15:07] through a promise to Abraham are you
[1:15:09] hearing me that Thessalonian church amen
[1:15:12] he raised them up and said I'll show you
[1:15:15] a mystery that the Lord shall descend
[1:15:17] from heaven with a shout and a voice and
[1:15:20] a trump but they never ever possessed
[1:15:23] that but in the last days under the
[1:15:26] ministry of the Holy Ghost God would
[1:15:29] call a church together and say now is
[1:15:32] the season now is the
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] time come on the Corinthian Church heard
[1:15:40] it you shall take on incorruption and
[1:15:43] put off this corruption and put off this
[1:15:48] mortality they never did it they never
[1:15:51] did it and had they tried it would have
[1:15:53] been a carnal impersonation
[1:15:57] but when the pillar of fire returns it
[1:15:59] brings the season and the direct
[1:16:02] revelation of the will of God to fulfill
[1:16:05] the word in its season are you hearing
[1:16:06] me then there's a season then there's a
[1:16:09] time in the Book of Daniel did not God
[1:16:12] tell Daniel to shut up the
[1:16:15] book until didn't he use those words
[1:16:18] until didn't he say you got to shut up
[1:16:21] this Revelation cuz they can't have this
[1:16:24] until
[1:16:25] what in the world was God waiting for
[1:16:28] what was he waiting for a prophet said
[1:16:31] he was waiting for somebody that could
[1:16:33] comprehend it he was waiting for
[1:16:35] somebody that could understand it are
[1:16:38] you are you hearing what I'm saying that
[1:16:40] the the church in its infancy could not
[1:16:43] accept these things but God was saying
[1:16:46] there's coming a bride a bride speaks of
[1:16:49] maturity you don't marry a little girl
[1:16:51] you wait till she's mature and she can
[1:16:54] have children and God chose a bride in
[1:16:57] the age of maturity and Paul called it
[1:16:59] the age of adoption amen that in the day
[1:17:03] that you're going to know you're going
[1:17:04] to know I wasn't the son of Charles and
[1:17:08] Elam I was the son of God and there's a
[1:17:11] revelation coming in this age of
[1:17:13] maturity that you got to know where you
[1:17:15] come from amen are you hearing me job
[1:17:19] where were you before the foundations of
[1:17:22] the world
[1:17:25] I know there a crazy world going on
[1:17:27] right now but to understand this you
[1:17:29] would have had to been there when God
[1:17:30] created the thing what did he say he
[1:17:33] well that predestination is a bunch of
[1:17:35] of milk that ain't what God called it he
[1:17:37] said job G your loins I'm going to talk
[1:17:40] to you like a man go to La I'm going to
[1:17:42] talk to you with some understanding
[1:17:44] you're going through some trials right
[1:17:46] now but I ordained you I got I got faith
[1:17:50] in you because in the season
[1:17:55] in the season of understanding in the
[1:17:58] season of adoption in the season of
[1:18:02] reality I'm going to let some stuff
[1:18:05] go and the people through education is
[1:18:08] going to miss it and Jesus said I thank
[1:18:10] thee father thou has
[1:18:13] hid can you imagine God would
[1:18:18] hide in a symbol and he would come unto
[1:18:21] you in the volume of a book that he
[1:18:24] would hide the symbol in the Book of
[1:18:26] Revelation and wait until a Prophet come
[1:18:28] to reveal
[1:18:30] it can I say this The Book of
[1:18:33] Revelations is actually your
[1:18:35] book that's not the Corinthian book or
[1:18:38] the Thessalonian book that's the Book of
[1:18:40] Revelation it is a love letter unto the
[1:18:43] Bride of Jesus
[1:18:45] Christ God didn't trust that book with
[1:18:48] just anybody amen you better put your
[1:18:50] seat belts on but God didn't trust that
[1:18:52] book with an angel he amen John said
[1:18:55] that was an angel that signified the
[1:18:57] writings of that book and brother Ram
[1:18:59] says it could only be a prophet but in
[1:19:01] revelation 22 guess what the Bible said

[1:19:46] he wants to transfer to you but if he
[1:19:49] writes it in a symbol form no matter who
[1:19:52] carries that letter the true meaning
[1:19:54] will be
[1:19:55] did
[1:19:57] until until he sends a prophet to reveal
[1:20:02] the symbol come on you can take a CD I
[1:20:05] can hand you an MP3 and you can carry
[1:20:07] something on that and I don't care where
[1:20:09] you go nobody will know what's on it
[1:20:11] till you put it in a CD player it's
[1:20:13] recorded in a symbol but played back in
[1:20:15] reality and God recorded a letter to the
[1:20:19] Bride of Jesus Christ in a simol form
[1:20:22] but in the days of The Voice of the
[1:20:25] seventh angel God would reveal the
[1:20:27] symbol of this Bible back to the church
[1:20:30] hey come on Church the very interpreter
[1:20:33] of the word has come down in the form of
[1:20:36] a prophetic word to ignite you to
[1:20:39] deliver
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:47] you do you know God's interpret of his
[1:20:49] own word y'all know that right everybody
[1:20:52] don't want to believe the message they
[1:20:53] say that God's inter of his own word and
[1:20:55] yet they don't accept God's
[1:20:59] interpretation because God interprets
[1:21:01] his word by bringing it to
[1:21:05] pass Peter said we've not followed
[1:21:07] cutting devices of man's ideas and
[1:21:10] fables he said but I was on the Holy
[1:21:12] Mountain and I seen the cloud come down
[1:21:15] and I Heard a Voice say this is your
[1:21:17] beloved Son hear ye him and he said God
[1:21:20] is an interpreter of his own word let
[1:21:23] the day star rise in your heart Amen Let
[1:21:26] us more sure word of
[1:21:29] Prophecy
[1:21:33] word what's more sure than what Isaiah
[1:21:35] said Jesus a a virgin shall conceive
[1:21:38] Isaiah 7 a virgin shall conceive what's
[1:21:40] more sure than that
[1:21:44] Jesus he was more sure he was the living
[1:21:47] manifestation of what Isaiah
[1:21:50] said amen it's amazing to me the people
[1:21:52] that leave this message they say we
[1:21:53] don't preach the Bible
[1:21:56] but let me let me just give you a real
[1:21:57] reality right here this morning we're
[1:21:59] not just preaching about the Bible we
[1:22:01] are the Bible we're not just preaching
[1:22:03] about Malachi 4 we are Malachi 4 I'm not

[1:22:18] of the
[1:22:20] manifestation come on little lady come
[1:22:23] on you can't fail you can't fail not

[1:22:36] word now I I I'm just a hillbilly I'm

[1:23:42] she said do you do you know what it
[1:23:44] means
[1:23:46] daddy well let me let me just say this
[1:23:48] to
[1:23:50] you there is not a college in the world
[1:23:54] that could train you to read what that
[1:23:55] letter said there is not a school on
[1:24:00] this planet to tell you what that letter
[1:24:02] meant do you know the only person in the
[1:24:04] earth that knew what that letter meant
[1:24:06] was the girl that wrote it and she said
[1:24:09] Daddy it means I love you all that
[1:24:12] scribbling me I love you I said glory be
[1:24:15] to God we've got a Bible and it's full
[1:24:18] of symbols but when you're finished what
[1:24:21] it means is I love you I love you
[1:24:25] Pride God so loved the world that he
[1:24:28] gave his only begotten son I'm not here
[1:24:30] guessing about what it
[1:24:33] means y'all might think I'm excited but
[1:24:36] I'm not really excited you ain't never
[1:24:37] even seen me excited but you wait till
[1:24:40] we get up in heaven and you see a guy go
[1:24:42] bouncing by and dancing in the spirit
[1:24:45] and you'll say oh there goes brother
[1:24:46] Wayne I tell you what we're going to
[1:24:48] teach the Angels how to dance they never
[1:24:51] know what it is to dance the dance of
[1:24:53] redemption they don't know what it is to
[1:24:55] be lost and be saved but I know what it
[1:24:58] feels like to be in the depths of
[1:25:01] depression and the depths of sin and God
[1:25:04] who is rich in Mercy come to my
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:08] life and Shook Me by the message of the
[1:25:15] hour what does all this
[1:25:18] mean I love
[1:25:23] you he loves
[1:25:27] me unlovable
[1:25:30] me but see there's a
[1:25:33] season well here will love the
[1:25:37] unlovable you're not even Israel by
[1:25:40] seed you are Israel by
[1:25:44] Grace you are the Seed of Abraham
[1:25:47] connected to the Covenant of Abraham
[1:25:48] only by
[1:25:51] Grace it's only way you got in you just
[1:25:54] got hi by
[1:25:56] Grace Daniel said there's a time
[1:25:59] appointed do you know Daniel saw the
[1:26:01] same thing John saw Daniel 12 and
[1:26:03] Revelations 10 compare them compare them
[1:26:05] one time sit down and read them next to
[1:26:07] one another you got somebody standing up
[1:26:09] fighting for the people book open you
[1:26:11] it's a it's a it's a beautiful
[1:26:13] comparison but both Daniel and John had
[1:26:15] to seal up the
[1:26:18] book one says until the time of the end
[1:26:21] the other says until the voice of the
[1:26:23] seventh angel
[1:26:24] so both of them had a key point the
[1:26:27] voice of the seventh angel would be an
[1:26:28] end time voice that's why the Bible said
[1:26:32] he was the seventh angel then he would
[1:26:35] be the seventh star that's in the Book
[1:26:37] of Revelations in the hand of God in
[1:26:39] other words when God timed out Gentiles
[1:26:42] he didn't put you on weeks months dates
[1:26:44] and years he actually put you under
[1:26:47] Stars we don't keep Time by calendar we
[1:26:50] keep Time by star now let me explain
[1:26:52] that to you he said unto Daniel back
[1:26:54] there in Babylon and he said I give unto
[1:26:56] your people 70
[1:26:58] years and he actually could tell them
[1:27:00] the number of or 70 weeks sorry he could
[1:27:03] actually tell them the number of weeks
[1:27:04] from the time of end until the time of
[1:27:06] the temple they could they could have it
[1:27:08] down to the day according to the
[1:27:10] calendar but when God called you he
[1:27:12] called you in watches of Seven Ages and
[1:27:14] put Seven Stars to announce those ages
[1:27:17] that's why the times amen will break up
[1:27:20] and and you'll see a time a little while
[1:27:21] you'll see another time you need amen
[1:27:23] but the star is the one that announces
[1:27:26] the season it has nothing to do with a
[1:27:29] calendar it has everything of which star
[1:27:31] you're under right now in the book that
[1:27:34] was written to the rest of the world a
[1:27:36] star they don't even know what it means
[1:27:38] but to them that's had an interpreter
[1:27:40] Christ himself has opened that book to
[1:27:42] us that a star in the right hand was a
[1:27:44] messenger of God that was sent in a
[1:27:47] certain season to reflect his light to
[1:27:50] the church that was in that age that's
[1:27:53] why God called him man like William
[1:27:55] brandom because he can become a
[1:27:56] reflector and not an educator he can
[1:27:59] become a reflector of the power of God
[1:28:01] upon your life and he would from that
[1:28:04] star would announce the season of the
[1:28:07] Church of the Living
[1:28:11] God now you know I I could pull this
[1:28:13] from a lot of places in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:28:15] He said hey he said you pray Perfection
[1:28:17] would come where there's prophecy that's
[1:28:19] in part where there's gifts are in part
[1:28:21] when when he that which is perfect is
[1:28:23] come why is that in the age of perfect
[1:28:25] love in First Corinthians watch Paul
[1:28:27] writes about love and then he talks
[1:28:29] about imperfection because Perfection is
[1:28:32] the Capstone which is divine love and
[1:28:35] there is nothing else in the pyramid
[1:28:38] that God says he is God never said I'm
[1:28:40] faith God never said I'm virtue God
[1:28:41] never said I'm Temperance he said I'm
[1:28:42] love so in the age when Christ comes
[1:28:45] there's a Clarity that you will be known
[1:28:48] as you have you will know as you have
[1:28:49] been
[1:28:51] known right Romans 8 chapter said the
[1:28:54] whole earth groans
[1:28:57] until until you can grown all you want
[1:29:00] to but till God gets ready to open the
[1:29:02] season it will never
[1:29:04] happen until God manifests his word
[1:29:07] it'll never come didn't matter what
[1:29:09] Moses was didn't matter what Moses tried
[1:29:12] but when the moment of approval came God
[1:29:15] sent a light and ignited a
[1:29:19] faith so the Gentiles have a season in
[1:29:23] John the 12th chapter it was Gentiles
[1:29:24] that went to the disciples to see
[1:29:27] Jesus do you know that's the way people
[1:29:29] see Jesus today it's through a servant
[1:29:32] that's exactly scriptural now they went
[1:29:34] to Jesus they went to a servant to see
[1:29:36] Jesus do you know that those servants
[1:29:38] went to Jesus and Jesus sent back word
[1:29:40] and he said now unless a corn would go
[1:29:42] on the ground and die it abideth alone
[1:29:44] but if it would go in the ground and die
[1:29:46] it'll come forth and bring forth many so
[1:29:48] he's prophesying to the Gentiles it's
[1:29:50] not your season to see me but after I
[1:29:53] die and I'm buried I'm going to
[1:29:54] resurrect and the life that's in me that
[1:29:57] makes you want to see me is going to be
[1:29:59] manifested throughout an entire
[1:30:03] crop come on put one piece of corn in
[1:30:05] the ground and when that corn grows up
[1:30:07] and becomes a stock of corn and it
[1:30:10] starts bearing fruit you take one corn a
[1:30:12] cob and there might be a hundred kernels
[1:30:14] on that corn but you tell me which of
[1:30:16] them you put in the ground they're
[1:30:18] everyone identical they bear the same
[1:30:20] life they bear the same fruit they bear
[1:30:22] the same thing and Jesus said I amen am
[1:30:26] the vine and ye are the branch and the
[1:30:29] life of Christ is manifesting through
[1:30:31] the
[1:30:33] church come on no don't dis don't
[1:30:37] diminish who you are and what you're
[1:30:39] doing this is a gentile time as Jesus
[1:30:43] himself said in John the 14th chapter
[1:30:45] for in that day ye shall know that is a
[1:30:48] direct prophecy that ye shall know well
[1:30:52] what God is going to do to find out amen
[1:30:55] how are we going to know how are we
[1:30:57] going to have a sure Faith amen how are
[1:30:59] we going to know the day star would have
[1:31:02] to rise Vindicated word would have to
[1:31:04] come to the church for in that day you
[1:31:07] shall you shall know ain't that
[1:31:10] beautiful you're going to know amen
[1:31:12] isn't that what job come up with when
[1:31:14] job said though the skin
[1:31:16] worms would destroy my
[1:31:19] body I know I know what do you know job
[1:31:25] I know that my redeemer is alive and in
[1:31:30] that day there going to be a bride
[1:31:32] that's going to know Jesus is not in the
[1:31:36] Tomb Jesus is not in the grave and
[1:31:39] that's not just because we read about it
[1:31:41] but he has been here manifesting Divine
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:52] promises now we got we got to we got to
[1:31:54] realize God set some times in Genesis 21
[1:31:58] Sarah conceived and be Abraham a son in
[1:32:01] his old
[1:32:02] age at the set
[1:32:06] time she didn't just get up and have a
[1:32:09] baby but God set a time for that baby
[1:32:13] amen do you know that time coincided
[1:32:16] with one who was named
[1:32:18] Elohim that when the Lord came to them
[1:32:21] and read the heart of Sarah it came at
[1:32:23] the same time time the time of Sarah's
[1:32:26] deliverance and her change coincided
[1:32:30] with the time that God visited the Earth
[1:32:32] in the flesh isn't it beautiful now look
[1:32:35] in Exodus the 9th chapter the Lord
[1:32:37] appointed a time and said tomorrow the
[1:32:39] Lord shall do this thing in your
[1:32:43] land amen am I too fast on the
[1:32:45] interpretting okay I'm sorry I I I I've
[1:32:49] been in a meeting and
[1:32:55] I should have gave you the notes huh I
[1:32:57] ain't using them anyhow so wouldn't have
[1:32:58] helped
[1:32:59] you in job the 14th chapter even the
[1:33:03] resurrection is set on time in Job
[1:33:05] chapter 14 the Bible said that would
[1:33:07] hide me in the grave that would keep me
[1:33:08] a secret until the Wrath be passed that
[1:33:12] thou would appoint me a set
[1:33:16] time isn't that beautiful it would
[1:33:18] appoint me a set time David sang the
[1:33:21] Psalms yes sir y'all love y y y'all
[1:33:23] y'all enjoy David y'all y'all know you
[1:33:26] you might not know this but I'll tell
[1:33:27] you why you like David I tell you why
[1:33:28] you like David's Psalms because David
[1:33:31] was singing most of the Psalms that he
[1:33:33] wrote sitting next to the Tabernacle of
[1:33:36] David the Tabernacle of David was a tent
[1:33:39] set up in the city of David which was on
[1:33:42] Mount Zion and he set that tent up and
[1:33:44] David sang those songs amen without the
[1:33:48] levitical order they had a levitical law
[1:33:51] set up in the temple I think it was in
[1:33:53] Shiloh at that moment and they had the
[1:33:55] law they had Moses's order down there
[1:33:58] but David had carried the ark out from
[1:34:00] under the law and had carried it to a
[1:34:03] tent and he was singing songs to God
[1:34:07] while he was in a tent under a daily
[1:34:11] sacrifice and it's written in the
[1:34:13] scripture when God got ready to come to
[1:34:15] the Gentiles amen they was getting on to
[1:34:18] the men for bringing the gospel to the
[1:34:19] Gentiles and they said is it not written
[1:34:22] that God would restore again the
[1:34:24] Tabernacles of David then the praise and
[1:34:27] the worship of David would return in the
[1:34:30] house of God and he would take a people
[1:34:33] a people for his name's sake that's you
[1:34:35] and me that's when David be listen
[1:34:38] listen when David begins to sing his
[1:34:41] Psalms the first song David ever
[1:34:45] sings He said oh I want to be like a
[1:34:48] tree that's planted by the
[1:34:51] water amen though it be withered
[1:34:54] amen it cannot disappear amen you cannot
[1:34:56] move it amen though though you cut it to
[1:34:59] a stump it'll come back again but
[1:35:02] whatever you do it will give forth its
[1:35:04] fruit in its season do you know Psalms
[1:35:06] the first chapter is actually a prophecy
[1:35:08] of you amen that David was singing about
[1:35:11] a tree amen that couldn't be
[1:35:13] destroyed amen the book of Acts tells us
[1:35:16] about a bride tree don't it but it's
[1:35:17] destroyed by the Roman bug it's
[1:35:20] destroyed by by cre Joel two said four
[1:35:22] things eat on it C pom worm canker
[1:35:25] caterpillar they all eat that
[1:35:28] tree but Joel actually goes on to say I
[1:35:31] shall restore and David said it'll have
[1:35:34] fruit in it season so God has to restore
[1:35:36] the bride to bring the fruit of Christ
[1:35:40] into the Church of the Living
[1:35:42] God come on we're going to go somewhere
[1:35:45] we're going to go somewhere amen they
[1:35:47] took down that tree in its prime the
[1:35:49] Roman Church took it down amen but when
[1:35:52] God said I will rest store there's a
[1:35:55] season that that tree is coming back to
[1:35:58] life and there is nothing that can keep
[1:36:01] it from manifesting this
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:08] fruit are you hearing me all the same
[1:36:11] bugs that eat it are still here all the
[1:36:14] same bugs that come against it are still
[1:36:17] here the difference is we still got our
[1:36:19] leaves we still got our bark we still
[1:36:22] got our life we still got our
[1:36:28] fellowship
[1:36:29] well I'm a bit of a hill belly I thought
[1:36:32] it pretty good cuz same bugs eating on
[1:36:33] the same tree but it ain't hurting at
[1:36:35] this
[1:36:37] time you know
[1:36:39] why it's fruit
[1:36:42] season God have appointed a
[1:36:45] time and nothing can prevent that from
[1:36:48] coming
[1:36:50] forth I lived in Arkansas most of my
[1:36:52] life my dad always had fruit trees they
[1:36:54] were they were plum trees and man he
[1:36:57] always wanted to Orchard the plum trees
[1:36:59] so he planted but we was in Northern
[1:37:00] Arkansas so every year the buds had come
[1:37:03] on that tree warm up a little bit early
[1:37:05] March or something the buds had come out
[1:37:06] man it would Bloom out man it was a
[1:37:08] promise of a great fruit coming but then
[1:37:10] about two weeks into his blooms or a
[1:37:12] week into his bloom a late Frost always
[1:37:15] hit and that late Frost would kill the
[1:37:17] bloom while it was yet on the tree but
[1:37:20] see this tree is a different tree this
[1:37:22] bride tree is a a supernatural tree and
[1:37:25] God has promised the fruit's going to
[1:37:26] show up amen it don't matter if the
[1:37:29] devil sends a late Frost it doesn't
[1:37:31] matter how cold loud to see it gets
[1:37:35] we've got our own light in the evening
[1:37:38] time it's shall be light amen what we
[1:37:42] are manifesting is not a worldly fruit
[1:37:45] our fruit is coming from another
[1:37:47] dimension and our light is coming from
[1:37:50] another dimension this is the church of
[1:37:54] the Living God uh Jesus said I shall
[1:37:57] build my church I'll raise up my tree

[1:38:10] too late we already have a rapturing
[1:38:13] faith we already believe the message of
[1:38:16] the
[1:38:18] hour who said preacher are you listening
[1:38:21] to all the things they're saying about
[1:38:22] the message actually I don't amen but

[1:39:20] you this ain't about your ability this
[1:39:23] is about the promise of almighty
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:31] God David got done preaching about that
[1:39:34] tree and in Psalms the 2 chapter he
[1:39:36] started and he began to say that they
[1:39:39] have took counsel and they have decided
[1:39:42] Amen Let me just put it away in in in
[1:39:44] our language they have decided to stop
[1:39:46] the Prophecies of God read read and he
[1:39:48] said that's why the Heathen begin to
[1:39:50] rage they're raging at the prophecies
[1:39:53] that are being fulfilled amen but you
[1:39:55] know what David said he said God sits in
[1:39:57] his counsel and laughs God has not got
[1:40:00] some nerve pills wondering how all this
[1:40:02] is going to turn out God is Not anxious
[1:40:04] to figure out whether or not you're
[1:40:05] going to believe or whether you're going
[1:40:07] to be saved or whether you're going to
[1:40:08] be in a Rapture God prophesied in this
[1:40:12] Bible 2,000 years ago that there would
[1:40:15] be a bride without spot a wrinkle she
[1:40:18] would raise up out of denomination and
[1:40:21] be the first fruits of the Resurrection
[1:40:23] of the power of God as sure as there is
[1:40:25] a bridegroom that's going to be a bride
[1:40:29] and I believe she's sitting right here
[1:40:31] this
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:39] morning you don't understand the chords
[1:40:41] of
[1:40:43] Prophecy there's a chord wrapped around
[1:40:45] your life that is dragging you and
[1:40:48] pulling you into the resurrection it's
[1:40:50] dragging you into adoption messages it's
[1:40:53] pulling you it's a draw that you cannot
[1:40:55] resist it's an unresistable force that
[1:40:58] has broke out over your life no matter
[1:41:00] what you had planned no matter what you
[1:41:02] wanted to do something got a hold of you
[1:41:06] it's not a third pull it's a third and
[1:41:08] third push it's a third pull and God is
[1:41:11] pulling the church into every promise
[1:41:14] that he made
[1:41:19] that's then can I say this God wrapped
[1:41:22] God wrapped Court of Prophecy around the
[1:41:24] seed he put in you we say a little cler
[1:41:27] amen he he he put a TI poost on you and
[1:41:30] he wrapped you into the promise of God
[1:41:33] and you can't mess this one
[1:41:36] up I know that's a shock to the legalist
[1:41:40] mind if you don't listen to me you don't
[1:41:42] go the way I think you ain't never going
[1:41:44] to listen let me tell you something God
[1:41:46] ordained
[1:41:48] you and that's the reason you believe
[1:41:51] the way you believe it's not because you
[1:41:53] can explain everything it's because you
[1:41:55] were ordained to believe it that little
[1:41:58] woman at the well represents who you are
[1:42:01] she was actually a harlot but when she
[1:42:04] heard the voice of the word she said I
[1:42:08] perceive you are the
[1:42:11] Messiah because she was ordained to
[1:42:14] believe
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:19] it next somebody says why do you believe
[1:42:21] that message of Malachi 4 just simple
[1:42:23] answer I'm ordained to
[1:42:26] it you don't have to answer every
[1:42:28] question somebody's got you can just say
[1:42:31] I'm ordained to it I can't help somebody
[1:42:33] else don't see it because the Bible said
[1:42:36] they would look with eyes but they
[1:42:38] wouldn't see they would hear with ears
[1:42:40] and they wouldn't hear so you can sit
[1:42:42] and explain it to them all day and
[1:42:43] they're still not going to believe it
[1:42:45] but unto them that Happ been ordained
[1:42:48] amen it just takes one sweep of the
[1:42:51] anointing of God and some inside
[1:42:54] recognizes that's my God talking to
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:43:03] me oh my goodness y'all going to get me
[1:43:06] in trouble for
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:10] sure isn't it odd you can take a little
[1:43:13] child and raise it up in your home and
[1:43:15] you can teach it and it can look up in
[1:43:17] the heavens and say daddy where did the
[1:43:18] stars come from you say God created them
[1:43:20] and you can say they say where did the
[1:43:21] where' the Sun come from God created and
[1:43:24] it's little life that satisfies it
[1:43:27] because it just has simple faith that if
[1:43:29] God did it then I don't know how he did
[1:43:30] it but he did it and that's enough you
[1:43:33] take that same kid and put it in college
[1:43:35] and within a couple years those
[1:43:37] scientists will give that kid every
[1:43:39] question of every unbeliever that ever
[1:43:41] had and after a little while they begin
[1:43:43] to wonder who did put the sun who did
[1:43:45] put the Stars it was settled until some
[1:43:48] educator educated a question into you
[1:43:51] because it wasn't your question to be
[1:43:53] begin
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:43:57] with oh if they're going to publish it
[1:43:59] we might as well talk about it cuz there
[1:44:01] is some men left with a sword on their
[1:44:03] side who is ready to take the land that
[1:44:06] God gave them we are not pullbacks or
[1:44:08] cowards we are not somebody hunting a
[1:44:11] place to hide we are the children of the
[1:44:13] most high god with an adoption Authority
[1:44:17] upon our life we got a sword in our hand
[1:44:20] and a faith to will the thing
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:25] I don't have to answer a question I am a
[1:44:27] believer I was not put here to answer
[1:44:30] people's questions I was put here to
[1:44:33] believe the message of the
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:37] hour listen to me God sent William
[1:44:40] brandom and the Bible said there is a
[1:44:43] season of sending and there is a season
[1:44:46] of receiving and God sent William
[1:44:48] brandom that's over that's a finished
[1:44:51] work it's settled forever amen it was
[1:44:54] tried it was proved it was found to be
[1:44:57] of
[1:45:00] God well I might as well go ahead and
[1:45:04] preach brother Brandon put this message
[1:45:06] on trial years
[1:45:07] ago all over the south in in Tampa and
[1:45:11] he took a Congregation of people and
[1:45:13] said I'm going to make you the jury it
[1:45:15] wasn't some calone Johnny lately that's
[1:45:18] hiding behind the death of a prophet it
[1:45:20] was people that were living right at
[1:45:21] that season
[1:45:23] and they said that's the truth so can I
[1:45:26] give you a little bit of clarification
[1:45:28] here what people are trying today is not
[1:45:30] the message it's a trial of your faith
[1:45:33] it has nothing to do with the message
[1:45:35] the message is what it is it's what do
[1:45:37] you believe it is what do you believe
[1:45:40] about this message but there's some
[1:45:42] people that believes it's the
[1:45:43] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 of Luke 1730 of
[1:45:48] first
[1:45:50] Thessalonians you want to talk about the
[1:45:52] Bible we'll talk about it what about

[1:46:29] seen the
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:35] word
[1:46:36] oh I feel something rising up in this
[1:46:39] building right now I feel something

[1:46:42] place this is not coming from your from
[1:46:45] your neighborhoods this is not coming
[1:46:46] from your radio stations this is coming
[1:46:49] from another dimension almighty God has
[1:46:53] down into humanity and has ministered by
[1:46:56] the promise of a gift Faith back into
[1:46:58] the church for I shall restore sayith
[1:47:02] the
[1:47:04] Lord problems we got them conditions we
[1:47:08] got them but regardless of the
[1:47:16] conditions the church ain't fell
[1:47:20] apart the church ain't falling apart
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:26] it becomes smaller in the sixth chapter
[1:47:30] of
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:35] John because
[1:47:38] unbelievers started walking away y'all
[1:47:41] say y'all talking about somebody no I'm
[1:47:42] talking about a
[1:47:44] spirit now think about this just a
[1:47:49] minute but Peter
[1:47:53] but
[1:47:55] Peter did not understand any more than
[1:47:59] the ones that were walking away but
[1:48:02] Peter had already seen
[1:48:05] something he had seen
[1:48:08] Vindication he said I believe that

[1:48:12] Messiah I believe it see and when you
[1:48:15] start seeing something and you start
[1:48:19] believing well I mean we might as well

[1:48:50] Lin had all this inspiration but L and
[1:48:53] borrowed it from different men in the
[1:48:55] ages and he borrowed things from Paul
[1:48:57] and he borrow things from Isaiah and he
[1:48:59] borrowed things from Moses but he don't
[1:49:01] make a a point of telling every place he
[1:49:03] gets everything but there's some things
[1:49:05] that locken didn't have there's some
[1:49:07] things that locken didn't understand but
[1:49:10] God said in the last days I will send
[1:49:12] the seventh angel and he will tie
[1:49:15] together every you Sin from the time of
[1:49:18] Paul until the time of the church
[1:49:26] you said preacher what are you trying to
[1:49:28] say I'm not trying to fight I want to
[1:49:29] show you something there is a season to
[1:49:31] accept this there's a season to believe
[1:49:33] it and the devil's not fighting William

[1:49:38] brandom he's fighting you brother Bram
[1:49:40] season is finished no matter what you

[1:49:46] how you feel about the message the
[1:49:48] message is the
[1:49:50] message you will not change the message
[1:49:53] and the devil's not trying to change the
[1:49:55] message he's trying to change
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:02] you woo but I'm already tied up I'm
[1:50:06] already tangled up I'm already baptized
[1:50:09] in the power of the Holy Ghost there's
[1:50:12] angels that are around me this morning
[1:50:14] energizing my faith to believe
[1:50:23] oh we got we got we got to get back to
[1:50:24] reality haven't we let's get back to
[1:50:27] reality there's got to be a season do
[1:50:29] you know that Mary was a virgin and
[1:50:30] maybe only 16 years
[1:50:32] old come on now but Isaiah years before
[1:50:37] she was born said a virgin shall
[1:50:39] conceive let me ask you something was
[1:50:41] that a changeable product it was a
[1:50:43] sealed word that God spoke through a man
[1:50:46] and it was meant for somebody's life it
[1:50:48] was meant for somebody and Mary was only
[1:50:50] a 16-year-old old girl walking by well
[1:50:52] one one day and the Bible said Gabriel
[1:50:54] come out and stood before her and said
[1:50:56] Mary thou H have found favor with God in
[1:50:59] other words the time for this
[1:51:01] Deliverance has come and you're the girl
[1:51:03] that's going to come through a virgin
[1:51:06] shall conce how many girls had heard
[1:51:09] that prophecy and it did not affect them
[1:51:12] how many girls had heard the words of
[1:51:14] Isaiah and it did not change them but
[1:51:17] this time it was an
[1:51:19] angel and it wasn't just talking to the
[1:51:21] crowd it was talking to an individual
[1:51:24] person and it was saying this is your
[1:51:26] season and this is a time of favor for
[1:51:29] God has favored you and you're going to
[1:51:31] be found with a child and his name is
[1:51:33] going to be called Jesus are you hearing
[1:51:35] me and she she put up this conditional
[1:51:38] question but I don't know any man he
[1:51:41] said don't worry about it can I
[1:51:43] paraphrase for you don't worry about it
[1:51:44] it's the season and God will overshadow
[1:51:47] his word that falls into you
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:53] now that
[1:51:54] word had circled the Earth 700
[1:52:00] years because when the word went out
[1:52:03] Isaiah said it cannot return void but it
[1:52:06] has to
[1:52:07] Circle until it be accomplished it can't
[1:52:11] go home without it the word cannot
[1:52:13] return to God without its attended
[1:52:15] purpose and Mary and Mary was the
[1:52:19] intended purpose of the word that
[1:52:23] that Isaiah
[1:52:26] spoke now when she conceived that
[1:52:30] seed she brought forth a child but you
[1:52:32] know what he said it was a season of her
[1:52:33] favor yes sir do you know that David the
[1:52:36] same writer we've been talking about
[1:52:38] also says of the
[1:52:39] church how many knows you're Mount
[1:52:42] Zion you are actually Mount Zion
[1:52:45] according to Psalms 102 the Bible said
[1:52:47] Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon
[1:52:49] Zion for the time of to favor her is
[1:52:54] come the time of favor for her has
[1:52:57] come do you know God had a time to favor
[1:53:01] Mount
[1:53:02] Zion do you know that when you're
[1:53:04] working in the plan of God you can find
[1:53:06] that time and that season and the
[1:53:08] position that you step in is in a
[1:53:10] position of favor it's a position of
[1:53:13] blessing it's a position of Liberty
[1:53:15] that's why the Bible says in Psalms 102
[1:53:18] and when the Lord shall have built up
[1:53:20] Zion he shall appear in his Glory when
[1:53:23] you build her up from Faith to a
[1:53:25] Capstone then he'll appear in that
[1:53:27] church he will appear in that church he
[1:53:30] will manifest his glory right in the
[1:53:32] Church of the Living God according to
[1:53:35] Psalms 102 he will not he will actually
[1:53:39] regard he will actually regard the
[1:53:41] prayer of that
[1:53:43] destitute he will not despise their
[1:53:45] prayer for these things have been
[1:53:49] written these things have been written
[1:53:51] for the generation that shall come and
[1:53:53] the people that shall be created in the
[1:53:56] Lord now listen this this these things
[1:53:59] will come for a people that it has been
[1:54:01] written
[1:54:03] about a season when the word will
[1:54:07] manifest of who it's been written about
[1:54:09] a season of people who are created for
[1:54:15] praise do you know that God actually
[1:54:18] calls a seed a
[1:54:21] generation they Avid says it and he
[1:54:23] shall count the seed for a
[1:54:27] generation we can break into some heavy
[1:54:29] stuff I'm going to stay here all day but
[1:54:30] I I I just want to touch this little
[1:54:32] point if you go to Matthew the first
[1:54:34] chapter and you read you'll think that
[1:54:36] Matthew made some mistakes in the way he
[1:54:38] said things because Matthew starts
[1:54:40] introducing Jesus and remember he starts
[1:54:42] at Abraham the king Lon and he comes
[1:54:45] down through Abraham's kingly Lon and
[1:54:47] then he gets there and he said there 42
[1:54:49] Generations from Abraham to Jesus and
[1:54:52] then he breaks up the 42 generations and
[1:54:55] 14s until he gets to the 42nd generation
[1:54:58] but if you take time to count them I'm
[1:55:00] sorry there's only 41 there there is not
[1:55:04] 42 amen between Abraham and Jesus
[1:55:07] because there is a 42nd generation
[1:55:11] somewhere there is another generation
[1:55:14] somewhere Abraham had another seed it's
[1:55:17] a royal Seed of Abraham amen a
[1:55:21] generation that shall be considered amen
[1:55:24] the generation of the
[1:55:29] Lord a g are you hearing me you're a
[1:55:34] part of the dissension of Jesus Christ
[1:55:36] just like RAB and Tamar was a part of
[1:55:40] his descension into the Earth and his
[1:55:42] Humanity the Bible says again he shall
[1:55:45] descend from heaven with a shout of
[1:55:47] voice and a trump the 42nd generation is
[1:55:50] the path of the dissension of the word
[1:55:54] of God in this
[1:56:00] age let's go to the Cross let's go to
[1:56:03] the Cross Psalms 22 let's go there what
[1:56:06] what's what does he actually say in
[1:56:07] Psalms David said who shall declare his
[1:56:11] generation you kill a man on the cross
[1:56:13] how's he going to have a
[1:56:14] child in Isaiah 53 he said prolong his
[1:56:18] days and declare his generation when you
[1:56:21] kill a man you killed his
[1:56:23] seed but in this case when they killed
[1:56:27] Jesus Christ they released his
[1:56:31] seed when they killed Jesus they
[1:56:34] released they released the bride that
[1:56:37] was on the
[1:56:38] inside and today just like Adam was
[1:56:41] separated from Eve and Eve come out of
[1:56:44] Adam amen so has there been a bride that
[1:56:47] has stepped out of the word of God and
[1:56:49] she is the Fulfillment of the word of
[1:56:52] the age she's living
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:57] in a it's a season it's a season like
[1:57:00] never before what what does this
[1:57:02] anointing mean what does this anointing
[1:57:05] mean it means God's getting ready to do
[1:57:07] something sir yes sir yes sir when John
[1:57:11] got anointed he seen Jesus anointed the
[1:57:14] Bible said he bear record the spirit
[1:57:15] Came Upon Jesus and said this is my
[1:57:18] beloved Son in the Book of Luke the
[1:57:20] fourth chapter when Jesus come out of
[1:57:21] there he went straight to the Wilderness
[1:57:22] you know what the devil
[1:57:26] did if you be the
[1:57:30] son now if he
[1:57:32] questioned Jesus Christ being the Son of
[1:57:36] God you don't think he won't question
[1:57:38] you being a
[1:57:42] son you don't think he w't question you
[1:57:45] but he puts up his own rules to qualify
[1:57:48] you and if you don't meet his rules then
[1:57:51] you're unqualified ified to be what God
[1:57:53] said you are isn't that beautiful if
[1:57:56] thou be a Son cast yourself down bear
[1:57:58] you up but brother BR said watch he
[1:58:00] wouldn't make bread for the devil that's
[1:58:03] right that's right what did them deci
[1:58:07] what did them Pharisees say to Jesus
[1:58:08] come off the cross we'll believe you do
[1:58:11] something to prove who you
[1:58:14] are but Jesus didn't have to prove
[1:58:17] nothing to
[1:58:18] nobody he was who he was
[1:58:23] yes now notice in the Book of Luke Jesus
[1:58:27] picks up the scripture and turns the
[1:58:28] book of Isaiah and he found the
[1:58:31] place he actually looked for the
[1:58:35] scripture that talked about where he was
[1:58:37] living and he said the anointing has
[1:58:40] come on me not to cast myself down not
[1:58:42] to make bread not to make stones but to
[1:58:46] preach but to preach the acceptable year
[1:58:50] of the Lord
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:54] y' y'all know what the acceptable year
[1:58:55] is right it was the
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:58:59] Jubilee now I'm not a I'm not a
[1:59:01] theologian I just read my Bible but but
[1:59:04] I've read it a lot and I've looked a lot
[1:59:06] to find out and maybe our brother's a
[1:59:09] bit of a teacher maybe he could tell us
[1:59:10] but does anybody
[1:59:12] know
[1:59:14] where that the Jubilee trumpet was
[1:59:16] changed for
[1:59:20] preaching from the time time of Jesus
[1:59:23] all the way back to Moses yes sir the
[1:59:26] 50th year was announced by Rams
[1:59:29] Horn they would blow a Rams Horn and it
[1:59:32] would announce to the world the season
[1:59:35] of Jubilee had come but when Jesus walks
[1:59:37] in the popit he opens up the scripture
[1:59:40] and said the Lord has anointed
[1:59:42] me to preach the acceptable year I'm not
[1:59:46] going to blow a Ram's Horn but my
[1:59:49] words my Ministry will be a season of
[1:59:54] Jubilee to the Church of the Living
[2:00:02] God I'm talking to you about something
[2:00:05] right
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] now you know what the Jubilee was right
[2:00:09] it was when Israel you know there was
[2:00:11] there was 12 there was 12 states of
[2:00:12] Israel that was the 12 sons of Jacob
[2:00:15] because God changed Jacob's name to
[2:00:17] Israel so Israel was a
[2:00:20] man and a nation
[2:00:25] samna was an age and the
[2:00:28] city so was Judah a state a tribe it was
[2:00:33] also a
[2:00:34] man and judah's children were to live in
[2:00:39] Judah amen a and Benjamin's children was
[2:00:42] to live in Benjamin in the tribe in the
[2:00:45] land and Joshua said you go there and
[2:00:48] you go there and you go there and the
[2:00:49] Lord and the Lord said I own the
[2:00:53] Earth and I own the Earth and I'm going
[2:00:56] to let you live on the land I've adorned
[2:00:58] you to live on anointed you to live on
[2:01:01] but if so happens that you sell it off
[2:01:03] as I know you're human nature you're
[2:01:05] going to get in a little trouble and
[2:01:06] you're going to sell this land off but
[2:01:08] I've give it unto you for an eternal
[2:01:10] inheritance and every 50 years no matter
[2:01:13] what debts against it no matter what is
[2:01:17] built up against that land I'm going to
[2:01:19] blow a trumpet at the same time that I
[2:01:22] make an atonement and the blood of the
[2:01:25] atonement will come to the children of
[2:01:27] Israel through the sound of a horn and
[2:01:30] people that never even see the blood
[2:01:33] will hear the sound of the trumpet and
[2:01:36] they will know that in that
[2:01:39] season it don't matter if we have been
[2:01:42] in the in the in the in the slavery amen
[2:01:45] for 25 years it don't matter if we owed
[2:01:49] $100,000 when we he
[2:01:52] when we hear the
[2:01:55] sound now here's the thing you should
[2:01:58] know that before you deal with Israel
[2:02:01] hallu you should know before you loan
[2:02:04] them money that God can just forgive
[2:02:09] them that's it just a little just a
[2:02:12] little blood and a sound and it's all
[2:02:15] over and you can run around saying they
[2:02:17] owe they ow they owe and God said I
[2:02:19] don't know what you're talking about
[2:02:22] now every 50 years the sound of that
[2:02:24] horn would go out into that land into
[2:02:26] every corner and whether you were
[2:02:28] actually up there and seeing the blood
[2:02:29] or not you would hear that sound and it
[2:02:31] would be a Ram's Horn and that Rams Horn
[2:02:33] would reach them and through that horn
[2:02:35] they would understand that was the
[2:02:37] moment a Ram's Horn does not make its
[2:02:40] own sound a Ram's Horn has to have
[2:02:44] somebody to blow through it just like a
[2:02:46] prophet is a mute the Rams Horn is a
[2:02:49] mute and until somebody picks it up and
[2:02:52] uses it it has no Authority or no power
[2:02:56] but the horn only has the authority of
[2:02:59] the one that's behind it and if it
[2:03:02] sounds in the 49th year it doesn't have
[2:03:05] the same meaning as when it sounds in
[2:03:08] the 50th year but in the 50th year if
[2:03:12] you heard the sound of somebody making a
[2:03:15] noise across the piece of horn it would
[2:03:18] mean we can return back to everything
[2:03:26] and here's the beautiful part is that in
[2:03:28] the days of Israel do you know they
[2:03:30] hired servants and servants stayed with
[2:03:32] the household they actually hired them
[2:03:34] they stayed with the house but but but
[2:03:36] if the if the house got sold off the
[2:03:39] sons and the servants left with the
[2:03:40] household so let's just say that you
[2:03:43] that you had a servant in your house and
[2:03:45] and you lost the house due to its uh
[2:03:47] damages and you you and your servants go
[2:03:51] work out in the field
[2:03:52] if I looked out in the field I wouldn't
[2:03:55] be able to tell the difference working
[2:03:57] side by side you look the
[2:03:59] same but when the but when the trumpet
[2:04:03] blew Jesus said the sun set you free
[2:04:08] you're free indeed and it's not the same
[2:04:11] to a servant as it is to a son but Unto
[2:04:14] the Sons of God the sound means that you
[2:04:18] are always a son that you always be a
[2:04:23] son and there's some people that'll hear
[2:04:27] the same message but it won't mean the
[2:04:29] same thing it's not the message it's who
[2:04:32] they are it's not it's nothing wrong
[2:04:35] with the
[2:04:37] trumpet it just matters whose ears it
[2:04:40] falls on if it falls on the servants
[2:04:43] they cannot return because they have no
[2:04:46] inheritance that if it's a Son of God
[2:04:48] and they hear the sound of the Jubilee
[2:04:51] they will have to return to everything
[2:04:54] because they have an
[2:04:57] inheritance oh come on Church of the
[2:04:59] Living God Jesus changed that from a
[2:05:03] horn to the preaching of the
[2:05:05] Gospel So today we're not standing at
[2:05:08] Calvary you're not seeing blood you're
[2:05:10] not seeing the cross but you're hearing
[2:05:12] a
[2:05:13] sound the sound of the gospel and
[2:05:16] through the blood it is saying you're
[2:05:18] free you're free from every denomination
[2:05:22] you're free from every idea you can go
[2:05:24] back to where you come
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:29] from a it's a time of
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:35] Liberty I don't want to wear you out are
[2:05:38] we
[2:05:40] okay they picked that horn up and they
[2:05:42] blew across it it was then a wind
[2:05:47] instrument it took a breath
[2:05:51] and the breath would blow across and you
[2:05:54] would hear
[2:05:55] something now I want y'all to just think
[2:05:57] about this because do you know that
[2:05:59] Abraham actually had a name change yes
[2:06:01] sir and it was an H put into Abraham's
[2:06:03] name do you know it was the fifth letter
[2:06:06] and that in the fifth letter of the
[2:06:07] alphabet is actually
[2:06:09] grace and grace was being added to
[2:06:11] Abraham's name at the time the season of
[2:06:14] the change the season of when Christ
[2:06:17] manifested himself in mect and eloh him
[2:06:19] came right down there to him
[2:06:24] I tell you man sometimes it's hard to
[2:06:26] stay in this human
[2:06:29] body I was standing in Israel one day
[2:06:31] and I asked a rabbi a great and learned
[2:06:33] man he's Rabbi Rickman he's in the the
[2:06:35] modern uh Institute to rebuild all the
[2:06:37] temples and Things Great schooled man
[2:06:40] and I asked him I said now to you
[2:06:42] Israelites what's that H got to do with
[2:06:44] the thing what's that H matter he said
[2:06:48] well brother Lawson the only thing I can
[2:06:50] tell you is this he said see in English
[2:06:52] you pronounce Abraham he said but when
[2:06:55] we say it he said we have to actually
[2:06:58] breathe across the name to say it he
[2:07:01] said we say Abra
[2:07:03] how he said it cannot be pronounced
[2:07:06] without breath and when he would Breathe
[2:07:09] Out the name do you see what it was he
[2:07:11] would actually
[2:07:12] breathe he would Breathe upon Abraham
[2:07:15] the breath of Promise the breath of
[2:07:17] change the inspiration would come into
[2:07:19] his name I don't know if you're he he me
[2:07:22] but God has breathed from Heaven there's
[2:07:24] been a breath that has been released on
[2:07:26] the church and it changed our name from
[2:07:29] Pentecost to the bride it changed us but
[2:07:34] we're not just another church we're the
[2:07:37] blood wash Blood Bought baptized Holy
[2:07:40] Ghost Field Church of the Living God we
[2:07:42] have heard the sound of Jubilee we're
[2:07:45] ready to return to everything
[2:07:52] do you know it actually writes in
[2:07:53] Revelations the 10th chapter and when
[2:07:55] the seventh angel sounds his
[2:07:58] trumpet what's that actually mean
[2:08:03] then brother Bram said when you heard
[2:08:05] the gospel it meant this it meant you
[2:08:07] could throw down your hole and go
[2:08:10] home that's what it meant it meant it
[2:08:13] don't matter how long that you've been
[2:08:15] working for the
[2:08:18] devil you can just go home now
[2:08:22] you can just return to the Lord you know
[2:08:23] what that means that means if you was
[2:08:25] out working in the field and you heard
[2:08:27] that sound you could just lay it down
[2:08:29] and go home nobody had to come and teach
[2:08:31] a class on how to let go of a hole
[2:08:34] nobody had to come and give you a
[2:08:35] fivepoint psychology lesson of what it
[2:08:38] means to walk away from a sin debt but
[2:08:41] when you heard the sound if you were a
[2:08:44] son to begin with there was something in
[2:08:46] you that knew I've got a home place I've
[2:08:49] got a father I've got a lady oh come on

[2:09:28] house that's right so he was coming home
[2:09:32] but he was coming home with a servant

[2:09:37] father's house I don't care what he done

[2:11:05] every time you get ready to really
[2:11:07] worship God there's some chain that's
[2:11:09] wrapped around your mind that says you
[2:11:12] did and you did and you did amen but

[2:11:47] read because I don't want to take the
[2:11:48] time but when you get home you read
[2:11:50] first Corinthians the third chapter and
[2:11:53] you see if Paul didn't say that the
[2:11:55] people had a veil on their
[2:11:57] heart that's right was Christ Christ
[2:12:01] yeah but they crucified
[2:12:03] him not because of him because of their
[2:12:08] eyes They Crucified him because they
[2:12:11] couldn't
[2:12:13] see but he was what he
[2:12:17] was
[2:12:19] right it was their standing and Paul
[2:12:22] said so their eyes are blinded and
[2:12:25] there's a veil upon their heart he said
[2:12:28] but when it shall be turned to the
[2:12:31] Lord when the heart is turned to the
[2:12:33] Lord he said then their eyes will
[2:12:37] open and they will see for the spirit of
[2:12:41] the
[2:12:42] Lord is
[2:12:46] Liberty the Lord is that spirit
[2:12:52] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:12:55] there's
[2:12:56] liberty that's not just Liberty to
[2:12:59] Rejoice that's not Liberty just to
[2:13:01] rejoice and just to praise that's a
[2:13:05] liberty to lay aside every lie the devil

[2:13:48] he means that he's a liar to begin with

[2:19:24] brother Bram said the sound of that
[2:19:26] trumpet
[2:19:27] means the
[2:19:29] devil is
[2:19:32] finished that's what it
[2:19:34] means it means the devil is
[2:19:39] finished would it be something this
[2:19:41] morning if you just look around and say
[2:19:42] Satan you're
[2:19:47] finished then you would be
[2:19:49] saying what Jesus said from the
[2:19:55] cross and he that heareth my
[2:19:59] words is that what he said he that
[2:20:02] heareth my
[2:20:04] voice John
[2:20:08] 5:24 now how do you know the voice
[2:20:10] you're hearing is coming from
[2:20:13] God how do you
[2:20:16] know there's been an abstract on this
[2:20:18] voice
[2:20:20] that's
[2:20:21] right and if you run an abstract on the
[2:20:23] house you know what you can do you can
[2:20:25] tell me from the time of its origin
[2:20:27] who's owned it who's had debts on it
[2:20:29] where it's went and who now owns
[2:20:32] it and from the time that the voice left
[2:20:36] Jesus
[2:20:36] Christ I can tell you where it's
[2:20:40] been because a prophet stood in this age
[2:20:42] and said when Jesus spoke it he
[2:20:45] transferred it and it went to Paul and
[2:20:48] it went to Iranians and it come right up
[2:20:51] through this
[2:20:52] age until it stood in the seventh age
[2:20:55] and when a prophet was leaving just as
[2:20:57] he was walking out the door he said now
[2:21:00] you're the final
[2:21:08] voice this is
