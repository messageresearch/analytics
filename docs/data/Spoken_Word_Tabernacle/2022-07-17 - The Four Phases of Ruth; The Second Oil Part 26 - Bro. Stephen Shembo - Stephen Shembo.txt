family members so all our family members god richly bless you oh my that'll be all for the music god will bless you you might be seated a little bit oh my oh my oh my oh my i went to sleep at 3 a.m and at 7 something i woke up i said what is happening to me when i sat down i began to meditate the holy spirit opened he first reminded me on what i told you on wednesday and he opened it in the way that i'd never seen it before i was looking for who to vent i say let me go to the young people you hear them laughing i took it i put it in symbols form i wrap it up in symbols and drop it there so probably they're still thinking about it amen you won't get that you need to be in a young people chat [Music] amen how many are up to date with the sermon blessed be the name of the lord how many are still reading the cod book brother jim if we would we might need to order the 70 weeks of daniel somebody two people already finished if i'm not mistaken so we can give it to them and they can move on amen blessed be the name of the lord yesterday my god if you miss it for legitimate the reason i understand it but we answer the question what is the evidence and the proof that you have the holy ghost i didn't know how to answer it it came right on the spot so i have to sit home and record everything that i spoke yesterday because i never seen it like that so those who were there found somebody who was there yesterday and asked them a question what is the evidence and the proof that you got the holy ghost they will tell you because brother branham said it's love but i'm saying this brother branham said this we took all the code and we put it together in one shot so if you miss it my friend talk to somebody amen blessed be the name of the lord my godness my goodness we talk about thanksgiving we talk about valentine we talk about halloween we talk about christmas and we show you how to detect every feast every celebration and how you can agree with it or reject it we went in the scripture we took the feast of the jews until the book of esther my friend i can't help it amen we even talk about the financial aspect he was there yesterday so you miss it amen my goodness i have couple people they are married people they ask me based on what was answered yesterday if we can have a couple meetings so i tell them get your question write them down for them and say this is for couple meetings and you put it in the box because the sister does that the put question they do that the put question they'll fold it and they say this is for the system meeting so i know how to separate my envelope whether it's a house meeting system meeting or couple meetings so put your question if i see it that it comes i have 10 or 15 questions then we organize for the couple and we go through it are you scared the way the holy ghost was working yesterday i went home tired like i was preaching because i knew it was the anointing that was here yesterday amen so put your question and we move on with that our question and answer will be august the 20th not the 13th the 20th because we already booked the clubhouse so we don't depend on the weather whether it's raining or not we'll be safe everybody care so august the 20th you can work with your manager your supervisor and tell them you got question and answer amen that you you know what to do you do it before the end of next week i won't say it i'm on youtube everybody okay this coming wednesday brother hughes will be coming with some of his folks to fellowship with us and then on sunday brother keith from jamaica will be here preaching for us you know brother keep so be prepared stay in prayer everything will be all right amen we need grace today you only have one service so let me unload what is coming up we okay are we ready amen let's stand glory to god oh my god i have this quote on friday so if you miss yesterday don't think i put this code for you it came on friday i was usually when i meditate brother branham keep playing 24 hours that's right and most of the time whatever is coming from brad branham is matching exactly the slide so i got it on friday if you missed yesterday this is not for you for your rebuke we okay now brother branham say if you are around here in the city anywhere near do water in other words don't stay home we want to assembly and gather ourselves together we want to set under the teaching of our brother here brother he was what and partake of the things that is of god as he found them from god he gives them out and we want to learn off and seeing that they are approaching we must assembly ourselves more often more of together we must love kama in our heart come out to do what [Music] that's it i'm going to read it again we must love in our heart to come to if we don't love church love coming together what we call church is coming together to do what if we love christ we worship again you cannot love god and sit at home when i will preach about the rest of israel the rest of the church i will show you why do we worship on sunday why we have to be in church on sunday and you will learn from there on whatever you have on sunday push it aside make sure you finish church first and you do what you got to do for god first and god is more gracious to you because he gave you only one service so after church is over then you go to your restaurant and fellowship or do what you do but never put pressure on sunday it doesn't belong to you that's why brother branham was talking about fishing on sunday [Music] have you heard about it i have caught the body i'm already loaded i know what i'm talking about you heard brother brad i'm talking about not even selling tips on sunday there is a reason why brother branham say that we're going to go through the scripture and you will see sunday in the different view so sunday don't bring your birthday friend that you have to meet in the restaurant forget about it do the worship first [Music] don't worry i know where i am man you imagine a man saying he loves his wife and had not seen her for her brother branham is comparing this to come to church pass by pass rabbis by and say well i see her at the other time that is not or wife saying she loves her husband or parents saying they love the children well it shows how does he show by the way you go to church and i think our expressions that we should constantly long to be in constantly anyway to worship the lord when we come together to worship him worship him at worship him while we are wherever we are worship i do stream that's normal that's an emergency window do you remember you two kiss do you remember when paul was preaching he was sitting on the window and he fell asleep so you keep staying on the streaming all the time don't want to come to church you're going to fail at sleep [Music] because he was sitting on the window he was only streaming he doesn't want to come to church oh i cannot make it on wednesday night because i can't drive at night don't you have a parties at night don't go to reception at night amen all right let's go to our sermon somebody needed it i got it on friday another sunday no not on saturday so don't come and say no i didn't show up yesterday that's why i'm getting a whooping no roof chapter 3. i have to tell you the truth and the truth will set you free some of the deliverance just need a little something that you show god and god delivers you amen amen you want deliverance you don't give god preeminence in anything and you still want him to bless you if he bless you you're going to run away from church because you're already struggling to church even if you are not here you travel where you are make sure on sunday go to church if there is a church there amen you don't stream city oh no i was streaming you streaming on your tower wearing a tower i don't know where that dropped from did you hear me did you hear me are you really in the spirit of worship in the tower oh no no i'm wearing a towel and i'm streaming drinking coffee on sunday you see now it's not me i don't live with you he's the one watching you ruff chapter 3 somebody say i played in the car that's good you played in a car but you're watching the sign of mcdonough that's why church is different brother branham said angel stays in church amen then naomi said to her mother-in-law to her where am i at 3-1 then naomi her mother-in-law said to her my daughter amen shall i not seek rest for you that he may be well with you i told brother caleb to erase the board because what coming up is different it's fresh and now to answer your question and now is not boast of our kindred with whose maiden you wear behold he wieners barley tonight in the threshing floor you might be seated we moved from the field now we are at the threshing floor everybody care praise god hallelujah i hope you still love me jump to verse eight amen and he came to pass no let me go to verse four no we need it and it shall be when he lies down that you mark the place where he shall lie brother branham told us which place was it it was calvary you remember and you shall go in and uncover his feet and lay you down and he will tell you what you shall do verse 8 and he came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet so there is a first slip of roof and boaz everybody okay and he was interrupted at midnight care then there is a second slip everybody okay verse nine and he said who are you and she answered i am roof your handmaid spread there for your skirt you know what it means now through ezekiel over your hands mate for you are a near kingsman not dutch not just you are a man but you are a near kingsman there is already a connection not just a man a mere kinsmen amen and he said blessed be you of the lord my daughter for you have shown more kindness in the latter end then at the beginning you remember this last sunday in as much as you follow not young men whether poor or rich everybody okay job 2 verse 13 i'm skipping because you know most of this tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform to you the part of the king's men well if you notice roof came in the threshing floor in a certain day everybody okay at midnight the day changed everybody okay this is now another day everybody okay so she entered in one day anybody care and after midnight it was another day everybody okay everybody okay let me just use an example just an example remember say an example i call this the seventh day so this one will be what example if this is the first day the other one will be there that's all i want you to get anybody here terry this night and it shall be in the morning we are on another day now everybody here so there is a sleep of the previous day and the sleep of the next day it's separated by the midnight amen that i will perform to you the part of a kingsman well let him do the kingsman part but if he will not do the part of the kingsman to you then will i do the part of a kinsman to you as the lord leaveth lie down until the morning and she lay where again back to the feet but she's laying on another day hey buddy okay but we already know the first time that she was lying brother branham said he was calvary everybody okay where he was taking the penalty amen verse 14. and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know one another very early like the resurrection and he said let it not be known that a woman came in the floor secret no public show also he said bring the veil that you have upon you and hold it and when she held it he boasts measure six measure of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city this sixth measure of barley was not given the previous day they were given in the morning of the next day everybody okay oh god help me let's go to proverb chapter 9. glory to god hallelujah if you dare you can say amen a few people all right wisdom has built her house how can we how can the wisdom be a woman they say her house they didn't say his house but i can prove to you in the book of prophet that wisdom is a man see me after church okay i'm trying to keep up here wisdom which is a woman okay let's read it again because somebody's looking at me wisdom has built water and her house everybody okay she has you not have many pillars so the hearts of this woman have one two 3 4 5 6 7. with seven pillars do you know that the pillar is a person do you know that okay praise god verse two if you are struggling with verse one she is clear now no more question she has killed her beast what a strong woman she has mingled her wine this wisdom can kill i pray everybody okay and then she mingle her wine she has also furnished her table this wisdom this woman has a fresh kill okay with wine with a table it's coming up right okay praise god let's go to isaiah 4. you're doing pretty good i'm just we're just warming our engine before we take off amen if you dare you can say amen isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 god help me and in that day how many women what is wrong with seven in the scripture seven women okay seven women shall take a hold of what not one husband not one husband it's just a man not a husband so there is no covenant they're going to take a hold of one man one man a man not a husband one man saying we will eat our own bread because they're dealing with a man they're not dealing with a husband you don't tell a husband i'm going to eat my own bread he's the provider everybody okay we will eat our own bread wear our own apparel we went through the hotel the responsibility of a man in a marriage you buy the clothing of your wife you're not ready yet find a second job everybody okay okay and where our own apparel in other words they're independent women anybody here only let us be called by your we just want a show off [Music] just to show the people that we have a man but it's not about the covenant amen to take away our water because when they keep going around the city are you married no are you married no are you married no so you have a bad taste to the people so let's put let's get some connection with a man so when they ask us oh are you married i'm talking to a man so at least that reproach can be removed everybody okay so far these women are connecting to one man not one husband everybody okay as a reminder this is it the bible says in isaiah 30. moreover the light of the moon you remember this shall be as the light of the water so when you look at this moon this moon exactly look like water so you can look at the moon and call that the sun amen okay no worry he says he shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold brother branham says this he says seven is the complete number of god representing water the seven days of water and isaiah says this sun shall be sevenfold as the light of how many days the seven days of what seven is god completed in seven brother branham says that there is seven church ages he made the world in seventh day he rested that is his last number in his creation in other words this sun that will look like the moon is the sun that have reached its sabbath okay this is not the sun of one day it is not the sun of two days it is not the sun of three days it is the sun of seven days in other words this sun have reached a rest or a sabbath or the sun has reached its climax it's completion there is no more the sun can do anymore [Music] everybody okay so this resting sun the moon will look like the sun that is resting [Music] the moon will look like the sun that is sleeping roof will look like borah sleeping roof will look like boas taking a rest [Music] praise god the scripture continued in the day that the lord bind up the breaches of his people and healeth the stroke of the wound so there is a healing power here now according to malachi 4 the bible says that behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the pride yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stable and the day that cometh shall burn them up say the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor but this is for the wicked but unto you that fear the name shall the son of water so there is a sun that will come up according to malachi 4 that sun will rise with water so if you want to recognize this son this son will come with a healing ministry [Music] everybody okay when jesus came he came with a healing ministry and jesus was the son he was the son everybody okay he said arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves at the stone what brother said this is the millennium and you shall tread down the wicked we are entering the millennium for they shall be ashes under the soul of you so this sun will open you to the millennium amen everybody okay it is the sun that have healing and when you get connect to this sun you won't stop there this sun will introduce you into the millennium and you will walk upon the ashes of the wicked in other words you will come back to this earth to live with god for a thousand years i'm not in the millennium yet but let's pray and let's start taking off heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing

there it's in vain but when you're there we know that there is something in store something better for your children lord may you move me completely out of the way may you seal the devil and his army out of this place may you come down and unfold your word and pour the shower of blessing upon your children this morning and those that are streaming online in the name of jesus christ amen everybody okay so far all right now we come back again on our subject the four phases of roof the second oil lord help me to get into the second oil amen in our tabernacle journey here we are in the holy of holies everybody okay and in the holy of holies we enter according to roof into the threshing floor everybody okay now when we talk about the threshing floor last sunday we found out that the trenching floor number one was a place that they were separating the shock everybody okay form the seed everybody okay because he was the time of the brother number two we found out that the threshing floor had a hidden cavalry you remember that somebody's quiet a hidden cavalry and a hidden temple anybody here because in the trashing floor of ornan we found out that that was the place that abraham sacrificed isaac and that was the same place that solomon came and built the temple so it started from calvary all the way to the feeling of the holy ghost in the temple of god which is the bride of jesus christ when i continued to look around the threshing floor i found a little bit interesting that there is an ox connected with a woman there according to onan onan told david that the ox in the trashing floor can be used for burnt offering ever here and then the width of the trashing floor can be used for the meat offering so we have two offering here everybody okay that have been unfolded in the threshing floor we have the burnt offering everybody okay and then we have the meat offering everybody okay the burnt offering is represented by the ox here which gonna be as beast of sacrifice and the meat offering right here is represented by the wheat everybody okay now in leviticus 16 verse 14 we found that there is something really strange about the offering of the ox the ox is what you call the bull and in the scripture it's sometime called the bullock yes everybody here so ox boo bullock it's the same thing now in leviticus 16 verse 14 the bible said that when aaron come aaron which was the high priest you can read this at home let's start with the burn offering the burn offering we found that the burn offering is an ox which we call a bull or a bullock everybody okay now according to leviticus 16 aaron was the high priest everybody okay praise god buckle up my friend now the bible says that and he aaron shall take the blood of the bullock we're talking about the offering of an ox he will take the blood of the bullock when they kill it and sprinkle it with his finger so the high priest must use not his hand everybody okay he must use his finger and we know all of this assembles anybody okay he must use his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ever here and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger how many times so the offering of an ox was handled by the high priest and when he was handed by the high priest the high priest must use his finger everybody okay to sprinkle the blood of the bullock upon the mercy seat everybody care how many times glory to god brother upon him help me up a little bit brother probably interpret this scripture he says don't forget the word eastward where jesus is what coming from where is jesus coming from you know where does the sun rise everybody okay where will the srn rise where was the mercy seat sitting toward the east why have i got you all sitting this way towards the east so when they were building the tub and alcohol brother branham made sure the people were facing east are we okay are we okay brother bottom say why the altar is to the water because when you enter the tabernacle everybody okay the tabernacle the gate was on the east side and the altar here was on the west side everybody okay so far so the priests will come behind the mercy seat and dip his finger and he goes one two three four five six seven what does he mean with the blood of an ox brother bonham say he coded the same scripture sprinkle it eastward and before the mercy seed shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger how many times brother branham say isn't that beautiful seven times toward the east what is it the seven church edges shall be covered by the hallelujah jesus christ blood just as sufficient in it yesterday today and forever and to every to save every heal every bring every miracle every son to how many times think of it it was symbols how many times so brother branham said when the priest was sprinkling seven times he was showing that the seven church ages must be covered every church by a blood everybody okay so one day when the priest when the high priest took the plate and used his finger and sprinkle it ever here the drop that was coming from the finger of the high priest was the blood for that age brother brother says this i read this and i never understood it until last night he said seven lamps you know what they are all lamps are seven water cost seven water meaning seven manifestation of the holy ghost of the seven and the seven water feet of water for the water [Music] everybody okay so here they are seven seats of water so the church ages are the mercy seat of god everybody okay everybody okay but in the church ages you must have blood everybody okay and the blood must come from the high priest and our high priest is jesus christ after the order of melchizedek everybody here but he's not using the blood of bulls and god he's using his own blood and he's sprinkling every church edges how many times with water what is the finger of god glory to god you okay in luke chapter 11. 11 everybody okay watch the word in purple or lavender but if i with the water cast that devil know that the kingdom of god is come upon matthew 12 28 but if i something cast out the devil by the water then the kingdom of god is come upon so the finger of god is water so when he uses his finger seven times he's using the seven spirit upon the seven church edges to bring the word of the hour everybody okay that's why brother branham said in the rapture when we are parading going toward the heaven some of this day in the rupture time that lays ahead proudly displaying water upon the water which is water in the hour they are water so the message of the hour is the blood of god upon the mercy seat when you move from the message you're moving from the blood without this message there is no blood god have only seven jobs one for paul one for arenas one for luther one for wesley and one for william marion branham [Music] everybody here the high priest jesus christ with his spirit using his own blood upon the seven church edges sprinkle how many times making sure the complete blood is covered by his blood [Music] [Applause] did i lose anybody did i lose anybody blessed be the name of the lord ever here but if you look that is the best that is the offering of water all the water the ox of the blue is calling the zodiac the torus [Music] brother bonham said there is three bible we went through this in a hotel we have the zodiac called the maserath then we have the pyramid and then we have the water the written word all of them line up together we went through that and there is a constellation called the taurus which is the constellation of the ox everybody okay inside this constellation remember the constellation have constellation within them inside the tourist constellation there is another constellation that is called the pledis [Music] did i lose you it's on youtube my friend the bible says this in the book of job which makers are terrorists it's a constellation we went through this and water orion it's a constellation and water if you notice plenties always follow [Music] everybody okay in job 38 31 can you burn the sweet influence of water all lose the band of water they always go together in amos chapter 5 verse 8 seek him that make the water these seven stars is the constellation of the pleiades the pleiades is a constellation inside the torus and he have seven stars over here and the seventh star we know are the seventh minister for the seven church churches that's why when you go back in the trenching floor you can see the tourists run up with a woman amen amen everybody here because roof is better than how many husbands [Music] ever here a woman seven and the pleiades have another name it is called the seven sister constellation [Music] go check your wikipedia go check your youtube or whatever you're going to see the another name for the pledis it was called the constellation of the seven sisters go back in the hotel you're gonna see it it's seven sisters combined together into one system showing that the seven church ages the seven sisters are gonna be under the tourist constellation under the ox which will provide the blood to sprinkle the mercy seat seven times [Music] did i lose somebody did i know somebody but we have two offerings that was the burnt offering how about the meat offering because our burnt of him became jesus christ he was our high priest according to the order of melchizedek with his finger he used his own blood and sprinkled the mercy seat seven times is jesus our meat offering too for those that were yesterday the bible said in john chapter 4 jesus said unto them everybody okay the disciple jesus sent the disciple when he got to the woman everywhere he said the disciple he said you go in the city and go search for food when jesus came back they brought food but they found him talking to a woman and the woman left and they said i need i mean you need to eat and jesus look he say my meat i have meat that you don't understand everybody here everybody okay can you put that just go ahead and push that back again my brother where you were just go ahead and push back don't worry about it it's an arrow everybody here and jesus said there is meat that we have that damn meat you don't understand it and when jesus was speaking like that they were still thinking corner hey but here by telling me look he said wait a minute did somebody bring broad dash here [Music] ever here peter said no this is a samaritan city maybe the youtuber [Music] jesus said wait a minute it is not your dash it is not uber my myth is to do what to do the will of him that sent me and to do what and on the cross when jesus did everything he cried he said it is [Music] ever here so jesus is not only our sacrifice for burnt offering jesus is both our birth offering and our meat offering as a meat offering he comes to do the will of god and to finish it that's why the bible said hebrew chapter 10 wherefore when he jesus cometh into the world he says sacrifice an offering you see the two god doesn't want it anymore but uh which body the body of jesus christ anybody here a body has not prepared me in burnt offering and in sacrifice for sin the head no more then say i love i come to do what meteorfinger everybody okay little thing above when he says sacrifice an offering and paint offering an offering for sin the wood is not need ahead pressure darwin which are offered by the water because he have to stop the levitical priesthood now it's the melchizedek priesthood then he said lord i come to do the will the meat offering oh god that's why in gethsemane when he was before the father he said father not my will but that will because he must be on me perfect to complete the work of redemption and to finish it everybody here he taketh away the first levitical priesthood that he may establish the second melchizedek priesthood by day which we are sanctified through the of the body of who no more the ox now now the body is jesus christ and our meat offering both of them are jesus christ those two were locked up under the churching floor everybody here now on the midnight we okay we okay i'm already in the air amen now in the midnight boys was sleeping roof cam and slept and according to brother branham that sleep is recovery anybody here everybody okay calvary means crucifixion hallelujah i hope you've seen it when lazarus was dead they asked jesus jesus said he's doing what everybody okay anybody okay so sleeping means what we will do their dad asleep we will not prevent them those sleeping are dead but here they're sleeping because they are christian because christians don't die they sleep everybody okay so when christ slept he slept on calvary through the crucifixion everybody care but we found after midnight that there is another sleep there is a second crucifixion [Music] you remember the mystery of the slave they broke the first one and they have to break the second one ever here in between here there is the first crucifixion and there is the second crucifixion the first crucifixion that crucify him as the word made flesh [Music] everybody okay everybody okay but in the age of loud this year we find jesus outside the church knocking out trying to get back in because somebody kicked him out they crucified him the second time [Applause] [Music] oh my god let me go with this brother bottom says this now if i was standing here and the candlestick ouch out everybody here here on my on my one hand is where i got it out and here is another one in the sun of the water we found out that there were seven golden candlesticks you remember and the bible says there was somebody that was standing away everybody okay not on the right side not on the left side he was in the middle hey back here he was standing in the middle by the bottom say his hand like this in the sun of the world [Music] everybody okay amen brother problem said in the son of the cross for he was through there that brought the water because remember at the crosses where they pierce him ever here and he brought water blood and the spirit he was giving birth like adam everybody here because it was full here if didn't go in the delivery room they pull air from here everybody okay now we talk about the feet of us in revelation 1 lord help me this is yummy you already understand this let me go by this in revelation chapter 1 follow me carefully the bible says and his feet that's where the roof was hey but here was like unto what fan brushes when he stood here in the midst of the seven golden candlestick his feet here look like fan brush you already understand what he means as he was burned into a furnace because he took our judgment everybody okay now if you notice the bible continued that in verse 16 that he had in his water how many stars the constellation of the pleiades everybody okay everybody okay and out of his mouth white water we have the feet of god that looks like brass in the midst of the seven golden candlestick in other words in the midst of the seven church ages everybody okay now we have his hand everybody okay in the midst of the seven golden candlestick according to revelation 1 his hand have water seven stars everybody okay everybody okay and in his mouth what is in it there is a sharp two edge a sword anybody care now his continence was as the sun shineth in his strength everybody here and when john saw him we okay now john fall down everybody okay let's see where did john fall [Music] am i reading a different bible john didn't fall on jesus christ on his chest he didn't fall on his lap he didn't fall on the back of jesus christ the bible is very specific that when john fell down he fell down away why only a defeat and when roof is going to the trashing floor when she wants to sleep she sleep where john slept where [Music] this message this message is wonderful ever here so john fell john the top of the brad said why the bible said he fell at his water as what he was not dead but as dead he was doing what roof was doing what [Music] [Applause] everybody okay did i lose anybody everybody okay and then what happened [Music] we okay at his feet what happened when john slept when he fell down john need to be awaken you following me how was john awaken the bible says that jesus laid water stop he didn't lay his left hand but what was in the right hand of jesus christ [Applause] am i reading a different bible what was in the right hand of jesus christ what was that so when he lay his hand upon john what is touching jonah open revelation 1 because when the staff begin to jump somebody is looking at me like are you making this up but i'm reading the scripture it's a different anointing my friend i experienced it the first time i preached in a hotel i felt it it's different everybody here the first time i preached on this church 2020 january the first sermon in the hotel i felt a different anointing that i never felt in my life it's an anointing that will unlock every scripture it is not me it is not me it is the anointing [Music] amen jesus let's go to revelation 1 open your scripture i'm still cleaning up don't worry about time i'm very good on time it's just when you take this flight you're already in eternity then your gps is lost everybody okay revelation chapter one you there let's go to verse four you there john to who so the church so the message is going to whom to the seven church ages john to the seven church ages which are in asia everybody here what grace grace be unto you and water anybody here there is a grace and there is a peace that are combined and right here they're going to the church god is sending grace and peace beyond to you everybody here we need to know where is that grace coming from everybody here what is the origin of that grace and what is the origin of that peace is it your grace or somebody else's grace is he brother kelly of grace or is he brother hamilton we need to know who's sending the grace everybody here grace be unto you and peace from him what him which is and which was and which was to stop there jump to verse eight you there i am there and what the beginning and there says whoa which is which was and which is to come to water who's that person jesus christ so jesus christ is god deity ready so let's go back to verse four now grace and peace coming from him which is which was and which is to come in other words this grace and peace are coming from who from jesus christ who is the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending here but the scripture didn't stop there watch next and yes are we okay are we okay that grace coming from jesus christ but before he reaches you do you follow me that grace must pass through the servant's spirit am i reading a different bible grace and peace be unto you from him witches which was and which was to come and from the waters seven spirits which are before them so this grace comes from jesus christ and then he goes through the servant spirit but here then he arrives to the seven church ages everybody here that's why when john fell at the feet of jesus christ to resurrect the bride god needed his right hand which have certain style and when he played this way grace from him through the star through john grace and peace from christ and the servant spirit and the bride [Music] amen another word without disturbs there is no grace when you pull from the message you are pulling from grace you are pulling from peace this message is the blood this message is the peace of god this message is the grace of god that's why brother branham preached shalom [Applause] the message is crushed it's your peace it's your job it is it is it is your grace it is your blood [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to this the message is addressed to the leaders of the god help that guy that shall pull away from what in which year 1960 brother sam loaded me with this everybody here god help that guy that shall pull away from water why because when they pull away from the message they are moving outside of the blood they are moving outside of the grace they are moving outside of the peace there is no peace without this message there is no grace without this message there is no blood without this message [Music] but it was given to the angel and the angel was in his under his own giving it traveling power from who from his water they are in his right hand that is they are in while they are on the earth that's why you heard paul who came after peter after by telling me after john but paul have the audacity to say if somebody preach another gospel different than what me paul because paul was in the right hand peter was not in the right hand but tell him he was not in the right hand those that are in the right hand they have supreme power if somebody preaches another gospel matter fact even if an angel comes from heaven called avenger curse [Applause] do you know that power rebuke peter what does he have power to rebuke peter everybody and when peter begin to write he say our brother paul are preaching things that are difficult to understand but who started with jesus christ why is peter recognizing paul why you have a hard time recognizing william mayan branham ff boxwood who was before him recognized him delos born recognized him because he was in the right hand of god [Music] [Applause] young people you understand why you see me everybody clear glory to god he says because they are delights from him giving the light to that unto the angel of the address to the star of the age that is what the angel of the church is water if he doesn't preach the water and that angel will ensure in water that's why they told brother branham when jesus come he will judge you first and if you are accepted spoken when tabernacle is also accepted [Music] because we preach what we near my and we are resting on the message of the hour we are resting on it [Applause] i don't have another message for you there is only one that was approved that's the message this church is resting on [Applause] because this message was already accepted [Applause] [Music] glory to god hallelujah my god my god [Music] oh god lord help me everybody okay so feet brush where did john fell at the feet everybody here his hand 7 star his mouth [Music] you ready buckle up good because i'm going to elevate the ship again we're going again higher we okay you're going to feel like an elevator like everybody okay praise god in revelation 10. i told you i'm going higher brother branham

is water and put them plura in their [Music] earthly vessels that they may continue water so we found out that the turtle d according to the old testament have two side he have two evidences he have to sword everybody okay there is a part that is open and there is a part that is sealed the part that is open everybody clear is throughout the seven church ages everybody here ever here the messenger will preach from a bible that is open the sword that is coming from the mouth is an open sword everybody clear that when we are at the end of the church ages there is another portion of the evidence that is sealed you need a sword amen but here so one sword throughout the church edges under the feet of brass hand the open or the written word everybody okay but the second sword rehearsing word because they told john don't write it but seal it what is sealed need a sword what is opened me the sword so power could go through the old testament and read read and preach luther could preach the bible wesley could preach the bible columba can preach the bible martin can preach the bible but despite the fact that they handed the open or the written word there were still things we don't understand [Music] ever here you need somebody that's gonna handle not the open evidence but they still evidence [Applause] we okay now we okay now we okay now okay now let's drop clearly let me skip this okay let's go brother branham said he came first as uh they crucified him he was the son of man then after that the holy spirit came he was there the son of god threw the seven church ages that's where the sword was there ever here but still we are stuff that we don't understand and in the millennium he will be son of david but brother branham say between son of god in the light of these churches they did what they crucified him boaz goes back to sleep the second time ever here and when he goes back to sleep when he's kicked out in luke he said he will be revealed again as what so when they kick him out as son of god he doesn't come back as son of god he's coming back as son of man son of god hand the open word everybody here but son of man will handle the sea lord everybody here everybody here now we're on matthew 25 the second oil you ready or you want to stop you ready you ready [Music] the bible said then shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto how many virgins which took the water and went forth to meet water they were going toward the bedroom the bridegroom was not coming to them roof was the one going where boaz is everybody they didn't go to meet a man they went to meet her in other words they were already engaged but they were not married yet let me help you in matthew 25 verse 10 the bible said what they want to buy the groom did what and they thou already went into him in water so they were not married yet they were only engaged everybody okay so when they left and they were going for some reason five of all of them number one all of them have lamps you ready now you ready now i'm gonna drop things here and i will let you chew those you ready you ready every virgin have a lamp amen and those lamp head fire everybody okay and oil everybody okay the difference between the virgin is not in the lamp everybody here the difference between the virgin came to the fact that five of them took extra oil we okay they took another oil a second oil in their container in their vessels right back here this oil gave them the turtle of wise [Music] for you to be wise you need two of you do you follow me you need your lamp with oil and fire plus the second oil everybody okay if you only have your lamp and the fire you might end up being a foolish one ever here so the second oil is the oil of wisdom [Music] you want to go home you want to go home the second oil is the oil of wisdom what is wisdom i'm like this the ship is like this so hang tight to help you up there is two vessels you got the vessel with oil and you got a flame everybody have this everybody can brag on it everybody can say they have it everybody can speak in tongues everybody can prophesy the determinant is not the first one [Music] what the what qualifies you to go in the marriage supper is the second oil [Music] glory to god glory to god we okay we okay but what is wisdom [Music] power says this but unto them which are called buff jew and what crust the water and the water so the wisdom of god is who the angel that came down in revelation [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so this oil is the oil of christ glory to god can i continue yes sir can i continue [Music] but unto him ye aren't part of him are you in who who of god is led unto us what [Applause] because this is different ever here he is not only wisdom but his water his water and his water what oil everybody okay you want me to continue first correction habits we speak their wisdom among them dada yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the presence of this world that come too but we speak the water how [Applause] [Music] [Music] i'm watching if somebody needs cpr we need the wisdom of god in water so the wisdom is christ but that wisdom is coming in water [Music] it is the oil of mystery it is the only god unfold the mystery of christ jesus christ can i continue what kind of mysteries karma even there the seven thunders were hell so to open the thunder you need a different shoulder the problem with this is when you begin to come it's so clear until you wonder is this really true [Music] it's your brain everybody okay can i continue we speak the wisdom of god in water even there which god before and two hours so this oil it's an oil that open the hidden mysteries of god that was sealed before the foundation of the world that's the oil that will make you see the bridegroom [Music] we okay we okay lord help me the bible says the wise took all in their vessels with the lamb why the bridegroom did what they wanted [Music] can i go slowly can i go slowly the first soil is good but if you linger too long with it [Music] you can slander and you can sleep with it [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is a different guild buddy i know when i'm pushing i'm working on theology but you can fight me because it's clear in the scripture in the message everybody here so they all slumber and sleep with their lamp and with the fresh oil now at water [Music] [Applause] at midnight there was a water [Applause] when they cry came what is unfolded which are there we okay and midnight there is a cry they say wake up everybody here behold what so the bridegroom won't come until midnight it's the time clock of redemption ever here then behold the blood groom coming go water to water he doesn't even though he come you roof [Music] but when you go in this time before when they walk up they check their lamp [Music] even the wise their lamp begin to go out everybody okay then then they cry did not only awaken the virgin but in the heart of the foolish virgin he also activated the second oil [Music] because throughout that waiting time the second oil was sleeping but the second oil was revealed by the midnight cry [Music] it is the midnight cry that told them that your oil is finished you need a different oil [Music] to get that oil you need to be wise to be wise means to have christ to have christ means to have christ unfolded in a mystery not only mystery but hidden mystery not only hidden but before the foundation of the world [Music] glory to god everybody here when there are arose behold when all those virginia rules and trim their what sanctification and they fully say unto the wise give us of your for our lamp our water everybody's lamp was going out ever here now the first one time is out [Music] can i repeat it the first oil time is finished it is the time of the second oil [Music] the problem is my time is up you have two choices either lunch or stop you heard it so the game is going very good everybody here everybody put your seat belt i'm gonna maneuver the ship this way okay i'm gonna maneuver this way because i'm gonna head to the airport you ready you ready i'm gonna maneuver and go through the airport make sure you get your seat belt when we talk about the candlestick we see one person standing in the midst of the seven golden candles ever here with the feet of brass with the word that was written but not the word that was sealed everybody here if you notice we talked about this we talked about this we talked about this but if you look after we talk when we talk about the road of aaron if you look down there is a ball [Music] i told you i'm moving the ship like this that's why i'm i'm i'm letting your heart get adjusted with the gravity i'm waiting okay you got adjusted now let me continue okay brother branham said this now examine this lamb you will notice that it has a large bowl a reservoir that is essential to the seven arms that come out this oil is filled with water which flows through there which are placed in the seven arm it is the same all that burn and make the light at the end of the seven those right there hey but here this light never went out the water just keep water who was pouring oil not the prophet the priest son of god son of god son of god not son of man it is the son of god oil we okay did i lose you did i lose you my goodness can i continue brother branham say how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing water because there they had their week deeper in each church age messenger is depicted his life is on with the holy ghost he is life has been immersed in true so the ball is who okay true i have the bullet i have that i receive on on wednesday i don't even have time to drop it [Music] through the week through that week he's joining the very life of christ and by it it's giving love to them what kind of light is he giving the very same light that was on the first that was what yes now let me skip this not only can we speak that's no and right on down the chair the edges to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hit with crossing in other words one big bowl paul pulled oil from them and gave it to the church and the church took that oil a when you spool oil columba pull oil molten pool or looter pool oil seymour came and pulled all right everybody okay thank you brother bottom said not only can we speak that's of the messenger but every true what is dramatically depicted the candlestick represented the messenger but he also represents the believer you need to reach that level they are all drawing from the same they all have been deep into the same they are dead to themselves and their life is healed in crossing who they are sealed by their water praise god you ready now if you look at this light this light also has a bowl okay and at the end he have what this light have a ball and at the end he has what so this light is the same as that one anybody okay everybody okay everybody okay and who was pouring this oil god as the son of god was giving the oil through the church ages because he's the priest and the melchizedek ever here because he's dealing with the open evidence he's a priest but at the seven church ages the light began to go out god found out that there is another evidence that is sealed but the oil of the ball cannot be enough to meet the bridegroom they all love the candlestick cannot be enough to meet the candlestick because the candlestick can go out you remember the time of samuel the lamp of the lord went out [Music] but here you need now a different oil not the oil of a bowl that is already burning but the oil of a bowl that has not burned [Music] yet an anointing that has not been displayed yet that anointing even paul never experienced that even our news never experienced that even brother branham before 63 he never experienced that [Music] he tested that a little bit by creating the square that was just a test are we okay did i lose you glory to god so we need the second oil because we found out that the oil of the ball through what the wedding of time is gonna go out that's why pentecostal can make it they started good but today they drifted away because they were using the oil from the ball that's why luther became a denomination because he was using the oil from the ball he worked at the beginning and after a while bernicos worked at the beginning after a while [Music] it is the holy ghost but it is to a measure as soon as he plateau the pentecostal begin to wear paint they begin to preach on the gospel they begin to wear tight they begin to go any kind of way because their oil comes from the ball that's why they're all the virgins slumbered and sleep but when they walk there is another oil everybody okay i'm searching the airport my friend we went too high so give me time as i'm dropping the ship everybody okay everybody okay my goodness where am i at you okay i'm gonna stop sooner the bible brother brother say that great spirit we would call it the colors of the word the best way i will illustrated one was the spirit of love the other one the spirit of what and so forth the seven spirit of god that make up praise god let me continue brother brother say the seven rainbows color that means seven bowls how many seven boys seven what reflecting water each light to wrap up into hallelujah he named the light he say orange red orange yellow green blue violet don't you see god in his seventh color rainbow his covenant that he made a covenant that through the seven church edges the seventh color he would save there but if you notice all of them are a bow it's a bow it's a bow anybody clear we're here you okay but they both started noah god told noah that i will set my ball in the cloud there is a token that i will not destroy the earth brother branham say this rainbow only was horizontally just cover one half of the earth that is all known as when broke over he was in a arch that is all you can see but when john saw him in his emirate color he did water [Music] so there is a ball that looked like this and a boat that looked like half because half of this boy is missing in other words the circle of the bow have two parts he have the part that was open to noah and he was another part that never was exposed to noah he was broke only john saw the missing party [Applause] [Music] don't worry my friend i'm gonna drop amen so if you take the rainbow you're gonna see that the candlestick unlike a rainbow flip up everybody okay if you look at the rain bro you will see that the candlestick followed and ran bro that is looking up but it's missing a part and this candlestick are we using a ball for oil anybody here but there is a missing rainbow here but to get the missing hidden handball you need the second oil [Music] [Music] you see now here was the candlestick two three four five six seven like this this golden what so when you look at them the candy stick run in a notch so there is one person missing prepare because i seen the airport i'm gonna drop sooner ever here in first corinthians chapter 13 the bible said we know in who said that in the seven churches we okay and we prophesy because we're using the ball we don't use the reserve or eliot that is for the end time for midnight when the bridegroom is coming [Music] everybody here but when that which is [Music] the second oil is water the second oil is the oil of water is just imperfect ever here when that which is prophet come that which is part shall be water hallelujah if you look on your window you're gonna see the city are you ready are you ready paul say for i am jealous offer you with water for i have married you [Music] i have water which means water that's why the virgin were only going engaged but they were not because paul didn't have the right to marry them [Music] everybody okay so throughout the seven churches because they use the all from the ball the blood of jesus christ was only espoused only engaged but not married yet to be married you need the second one [Music] hallelujah we okay we okay robert i gotta stop watch this paul because he has passed the bread what is he saying he says for i have inspired you to water not one man ever here it's a husband but you're not united with him yet because we are using the boil oil so you need to keep moving until the retail time where the second oil will be activated that i may present you as a chest water a married woman is not a virgin so the bride is not married yet america the bride through newton through columba through martin through wesley all of the time it's only virgin because you must wait for the midnight crime because the midnight cry will introduce you to the marriage and activate the second oil [Music] how to land this ship buddy we ready let me leave you with this but i do what i thought paul got the oil [Music] i thought paul got the holy ghost how can he have the holy ghost and he's afraid he's afraid of what why was paul with the genuine holy spirit but paul is still afraid about the church i'm letting that soak in because it's a different caliber my friend you ready what are you afraid of paul he says i feel less by any means as the began who stopped [Music] [Music] in genesis 2 toward the end god created the animal he looked at adam he said adam it is not good that you are i must make to adam water a help meet for him god took adam and put him to sleep anybody care and went where everybody okay and he pulled water i'm sorry open genesis too and are closed here okay drop is there it's too much are you there let's go to genesis 2. you there verse 21 if you're there you can say amen and i stop here and the lord god calls the what upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and did water [Music] verse 22 and the rib which the lord has taken from the man made here and brought him to adam and brought him to the man and adam said this is now and flesh of my flesh it shall be called hell because she was taken out of here everybody okay job to verse 25 and they were both and the man and his wife and they were not watch verse chapter 3 verse 1 after all this time they never spoke about these men about this creature the whole genesis was quiet but as soon as the bride of adam came up from his side you follow me you follow me genesis 3 open a creature in the garden of eden genesis 3 verse 1 now stop the serpent is mentioned after the eve is pulled out from the america undead in calvary you following me jesus went to sleep and the peace jesus christ and water came blood came and the spirit came and on the day of pentecost the holy ghost came as soon as the holy ghost came as soon as the bread of christ came out of christ paul is afraid [Music] paul said i'm afraid of one thing he's afraid of what because he's dealing now with the second adam they first started as soon as the bread came out the serpent came out now paul the first messenger when he looked at the brother he said he looked at the ball he said we are using the oil from the candlestick the devil will come again [Music] the devil will come again i'm afraid after my departure grievous wolf will enter here because i know the pipe you pulling from is the oil from the pool where is the other oil god said paul it is not for this time you got to sleep at the end time i'm going to handle the devil not with the first oil with the second oil [Music] everybody okay everybody okay that's why in revelation 10 when he's coming down he look at the devil at the sea on the beyond the earth he put his foot there and he put another foot there saying that now i have come saying therefore i have come this word will not fail [Applause] this church will not fail because it's not the sake it's not the first door it is the second oil the second one [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the second oil have the devil [Applause] answered amen [Music] everybody okay now you see you see the two feet not roof when she enter on the feet of bus but on the second fist on the second feet hey buddy that's why in revelation 10 when he comes automatically he's not playing games with the devil he's blocking the two feasts because now i have come down paul what you were afraid of i'm gonna deal with it now [Music] buddy i apologize i gotta stop here i'm not preaching on wednesday i'm not preaching on sunday so you take your time and meditate through this because this is loaded meditate meditate because when i'm coming back i'm gonna take you again and we're gonna go higher anybody here let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for the second oil thanking you for this holy ghost no wonder your prophet said that the token cannot come until the evening light and the people didn't understand his language but he was talking about the second oil it is a different token because if he was the same token we could be denomination by this time and brother branham say watch every revival every three years they become a denomination but this one since inside there is no denomination because it's not the first oil it is the second oil further may your children cherish this message may they understand that this message is not a game it is not a message that is stand to play a game with the devil it is not an anointing that is coming to make another church to make another move to make another click that's why all the clicks and the moves that rise in this message are falling down because they missed the purpose that the message was not sent for removal he was sent to collect the pure bread of jesus christ and this eve is not going to fail father bless your children as they went an extra mile to let me reach this point lord may you continue to unfold and may you touch them may you strengthen my body and be with us lord father and continue to bless us throughout the week as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen i'm sorry yeah god bless you we love you bye [Applause] continue to meditate we will pick up on the oil and it will continue i know it's a different language it might challenge what you heard before go home review it sit down open the tape open the database of the message open the scripture and verify we were called higher than what we thought that's why he said we are living under our privileges god bless you go ahead brother john we're going to try this i wanted to sing it last sunday and i just we didn't know it so we're going to try it's been a long time y'all help me okay i hear the sound of a mighty rug and it's closer now than it's ever been i can almost hear the trumpet not gabriel as the seventh angel sounds the call [Music] at the midnight cry we'll be going home hallelujah go ahead and change it please i need the words when jesus steps out on a cloud to call his children the dead in christ shall rise to meet him in the air and then those that remain shall be quickly changed [Music] jesus comes again let's sing that one i look around me i see prophecies for fear the signs of the time y'all help me out i ain't sure here they're appearing everywhere [Music] i can almost hear the father tell the son go get my children [Music] oh at the midnight ground the bride in christ shall rise [Applause] [Music] when jesus steps out on a cloud to call his children hallelujah oh the dead and cry shall rise to meet him in the air and then those that remain shall be quickly changed at the midnight crime [Applause] [Music] jesus come y'all can be dismissed let's sing that chorus one more time when jesus steps out on a cloud to call his children the dead in christ shall rise to meet him in the air and then those bad remains shall be quickly changed [Music]
