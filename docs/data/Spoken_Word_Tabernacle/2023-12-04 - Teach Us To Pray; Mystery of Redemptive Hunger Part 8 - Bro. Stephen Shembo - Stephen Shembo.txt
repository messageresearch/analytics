their Bible we are reading our Cod our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somewhere you are listening to the message of William Marion Bram not any other message the message of William Marion Bram that's clear and it's specific amen amen yesterday we have a wonderful young Sisters Meeting we only touched the personal finances and we were unable to touch the investment you say why do you teach young sister investment why did the prophet preach investment three or four times why did the prophet preach the message investment did he say that it's a message that only men need to listen Brother David increase my volume pra did he say it's only men to listen to those messages amen I will give them everything that I know of so that they can use it and also they can help their husband am to use it in case they don't know amen amen so anything I see in word in the message of the hour I will give it to them amen some of them they cannot do they cannot preach but if the husband has a Ministry they can help them everybody okay everybody okay so we know where our L Mark are but as far as to prepare them I will prepare them until they are well done amen can you say amen amen did that step on your toes again so sister divon you work with the young sisters so you can get the next date and we see when we can catch up on the second one Lord's willing on December the 16th brother abble we got everything confirmed that is the follow up on the Young's men meeting amen and then Lord's willing question and answer will be on December the 23rd will take few minutes probably 15 minutes just to give you an overview where we are with the uh plan for the extension and the construction and if you have any uh question you go ahead and ask for it today you need your Bible as always but I want you to stay with your Bible very tight because we will go slowly as a Sunday school lesson and I told brother Robert in the office I say you pray for me if I can only deliver 5% of what I got at least 5% but Robert say no we want 100% so you pray for me and relax and you might hear something that is buzzing into your ear just relax it's okay it's coming from the Bible and it's coming from the message your brother BR we okay amen you ready to climb up we ready to take off we believe the impossible when I say that I get your expectation up that's what I want that's exactly where we can strike the target Bullseye right sister shra let's go ahead and get let's go to our scripture this morning Genesis chapter 41 if you see there is a long scripture there and there is no way I can avoid anything if not you are going to miss what we trying to get so if you do a lot of moving stay put avoid a lot of moving amen amen you sleepy you stand behind there close to the Deacon so they keep pressing you up a little bit just to keep you up everything will be okay you okay brother Benjamin amen ready to fly yes sir okay glory to God Genesis chapter 41 the best thing to do is let me pray because as I'm claming with this to stop in the middle and praying we kind of go down a little bit one octave down and then we got to pick up again so let's go ahead and pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for restoring the internet service that was down lord father sometime we have things and we do not realize the importance of it until something happened to it but Lord father when we come back and everything is working well we want to be grateful to thank you for everything Lord father that you are accomplishing and doing in our lives father this is as far as I can go may you move me please completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children give us the strength touch those that are sick that have been affected by this weather May you heal us completely may you touch Lord and open up the freedom of the spirit so that your children can catch the revelation of what you're trying to speak to them here and those that are listening or streaming or will be streaming down the road father thank you for your children making their way to service because we don't know what kind of fight they have been under but despite the fight father they are showing this morning which side they are they are this morning hungry and waiting to hear from thee that's why we are asking you this morning give us this day our daily bread father we humbly ask it and commit everything unto thy hand rebuking every devil and setan himself away from this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis chapter 41 stay put with your Bible do not be somebody who sit and say well he's just going to read it you will miss it amen amen Genesis 41 verse 28 if you thereare you can say Amen this is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh you know the background of this story Pharaoh had a dream and the dream was doubled yes in other word those two dream cannot be separated amen it's a dream that is double and it's combined into one dream are we together and according to the first Dream the first Dream deal with wheat are we together the first Dream oh I always have backup it's hard to be ambushed with the message of the hour because we got the devil answer I I need one more brother Robert the first Dream deals with a wheat or I can call it a wheat plant amen you know seven years of things and youve seen that in cartoons in movie everything so you can Jehovah Witnesses books whatever you already seen all of that amen so it deals with the wheat and the second dream doesn't deal with the wheat but it deals with animals and the animal is a cow we clear an animal in the Bible means what it means power both of these dreams are symbolic amen amen when they are symbolic it means nobody can break into those dream except a prophet amen we clear it together we clear it together so one dream have seven ears of corn and the other one has also seven you remember the dream we got seven dealing with seven and they are two combined together this have a story of a wheat plant and this other one is dealing with animals thank you verse 28 this is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh what God is is about to do what to do he show to who Pharaoh now who's about to do this God almighty God you might be seated so this dream God is the author and he is also the finisher oh the one that's going to fulfill the dream but this dream doesn't contain only good stuff that's right there are seven years of famine and there are seven years of plenty we clear who's going to bring the Plenty who's bringing the famine so both the blessing I told you to follow me carefully both the blessing and the curse Es are coming from who God the good and the evil is coming from who God let me help somebody before somebody lose a wing listen to The Book of lamentation chapter 3: 38 Jeremiah say out of the mouth of who the most high out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not what evil and what good and the mouth of the most high sometime could be the mouth of this man himself call the Lord Jesus Christ but sometime the mouth of God is a person that's it is a man it is called a prophet am a prophet is the mouth of God that's why a prophet can bring a blessing or a prophet can bring a curse we clear together are we okay so we talking about a dream that contain a whe plant with seven ears and we got seven animals with with a second dream now let's clam he says it's God who's doing it we clear verse 29 behold the come seven years of what great great what plenty we got seven years of great plenty are we together 7even years of great plenty throughout all the land of what Egypt and this is Joseph is is explaining interpreting the dream verse 30 and they shall arise after them what seven years of famine we got seven years of famine amen thank you Jesus who's bringing the femine God who is bringing the Plenty God why is God bringing the femine yes he already brought the Plenty why is he bringing the famine what is the purpose of the famine why do you let people suffer for seven years what is in the in that suffering that you enjoy in that fine you sitting and you're watching people starving what is in that God like who's bringing the famine God thank you verse 30 and they shall arise after them seven years years of famine yes and all the Plenty shall be how forgotten in the what land of Egypt so the level of this famine will make you forget everything that was before Jesus so God is bringing a blessing of seven years a great blessing amen for seven years great blessing for seven years but there is a fine that is coming up but this fine has it coming are we together when he struck the land of Egypt you won't even remember what you have for plenty in other word it's going to be a severe famine that will be that will make you forgot everything that God did before and who's bringing that kind of fine God how many years seven years we clear we okay praise God verse uh 30 which says and all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume what the land verse 31 and the Plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the femine following M amen for it shall be how very Grievous in other words the magnitude of the famine is greater than the blessing come on Lord how can God bring something like that it's going to be very Grievous what are you trying to preach today chill out are we okay amen verse 32 and for that the dream was what doubled unto Pharaoh repeat it amen double unto Pharaoh twice it is because they think is how established by God established means it's determined by God in other word God won't back up whether you like it or not whether you pray or not God want back up am God is determined it's going to happen what is happening something bad is going to happen after something Gooden everybody's shaking already amen all the land of Egypt are shaking Pharaoh is shaking oh oh the second news is is is more attractive than the first news let me go this route if they tell you tomorrow they're going to bless you with everything it's not going to happen to any of you including me if they tell you tomorrow you're going to get a great blessing and after you finish enjoying you die how are you going to be are you going to be thinking about the blessing what are what is your attraction going into the attraction is going toward the curse in other word that curse begin to even remove the joy of the blessing you won't be thinking like tomorrow I'm going to be blessed what is going to preoccupy your mind will be tomorrow I'm going to die tomorrow I'm going to die what do I need to fix no no no you're going to enjoy first no forget about enjoying after enjoying I'm going to die that's what you're going to do now God is bringing a news he say hey s Years you'll be good but seven years you're going to see something bad and what you're going to see is more greater than the good oh my God in other way they took everything why is God magnifying something bad what is in that famine that that I can look through the famine through the starvation through the [Music] hunger we be clear together what is in the Hunger that God it wanted so much that God is determined to bring it that's good now your Canon are opening up that's what I like amen amen amen he say the the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is how established by God it's determined by God and God will how shortly bring it to in other way it won't take too long you're going to get it amen so as the year of Plenty started you say yeah yeah let's just eat something is coming up there so everybody begin to think what will we'll do when after this plent is finished so should we store should we what is going on Amen verse 33 get ready now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man who is how discreet remember Joseph is a prophet we're dealing with Joseph and Joseph who is a prophet I'm going to Define this Joseph to you so everything is clean as we keep moving up amen amen amen amen amen yes sir because brother brandham say every scripture have a compound meaning and many applications are we together to give you a hand about this Joseph this Joseph unfolded or interpreted or described a dream that is dealing with the history of a wheat plant so Joseph is able to tell you about the wheat plant he can tell you that if a corn is fallen in the ground are we together I'm I'm I'm describing your Joseph that corn will get down into Earth and when the corn come up from the earth it come up into three stages there is a Joseph that described that and he say it goes through Luther there is a Joseph who described that and he goes through Wesley and he goes to the Pentecost which he produces the Shar and inside the Shar there is a grain so Joseph is the one that will describe the seven Church changes am are we together are we together and that Joseph is a prophet but he's not going to stop only on the seven Church ages he has to break the seals where there is the power of an animal have I lost somebody have I lost somebody have I lost somebody when they open the first seal where was it an animal when they open the second seal where was it a cow an animal everybody okay so that Joseph must be able to decode what the animal means in other word our Joseph today is the Joseph that would teach us the seven Church ages and he also will teach us the seventh seal because the churches and the seals are combined everybody together so to make your long story short this Joseph is a top of William Marion [Applause] Bram are we okay are we together keep that in mind as we traveling we okay now we okay now okay if I lost you raise your hand if I lost you raise your hand I want to see your hand don't be afraid we're a family okay everybody's good oh somebody's there the first deal with a whe plan if you study the church ages brother brandham described the church ages as a story of a whe plan if you study the seals the seals deals with animal as a symbol that's right but nobody can interpret this only a prophet and no one was able to describe the church ages the way brother Bram described people tried and they attempted to describe the church ages but they were locked under the seals when they interpreted the seal they inter interpretation was wrong because only a prophetic messenger not a teacher not a pastor not an evangelist only a prophet Vindicated is able to come and to open the seals amen so Joseph will not stop only at teaching you the church ages but he must also unfold the seals to you and the seals and the church ages go together amen any question so far are we clear my friend amen thank you all right verse uh 33 he says now therefore let Pharaoh do what look out a man a man that is how discreet and wise discreet and wise and set him over the land of what Egypt who do you think they're going to get who do you think Pharaoh will get who are they going to entrust to this amen amen amen amen do you know that Pharaoh sometime is a Tope of God that's right do you know that no problem okay let's continue verse uh 34 let Pharaoh do this follow me and let him appoint what officers if you look officers are plural but the officer are not the man that was appointed that is wise that's it that's it that's it I'm cleaning up certain things quickly let's go back to verse 33 can you read 33 for me my friend now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man stop a man is how plural oring singular so there is a man there is a man how is that man discreet he's discreet discreet and what wise we know what wisdom means H the Bible says wisdom is has built pillar that's right on seven seven pillar you know what it means right and a pillar is a person you know that do you know what a uh white hair means so when the chief the judges goes to in London to go judge a case they take a white wig and they put there why why are they putting the wig it show you what so we also had a wig that's right that's right everybody okay that wig is over there Amen brother Bram call that the wig that is crowning the Lord Jesus Christ amen meaning that the wisdom of God have come amen are we together have I lost someone so there is a man that is discreet and how wise number two verse3 before we got officers if you notice they are plural amen so these officer will be under the men amen the officer are not the men that's right the officer must work with the vision of the man that will be appointed to store food don't worry my friend you will catch me Amen Let Pharaoh verse 34 do this let him appoint what officers plural where over the land over the land and and take up what the fifth part of the land of Egypt and the what in the seven plen years okay so Joseph is giving up an advice he says when we have seven years of of Plenty appoint an officer I appoint a man and that man will work with officers the ministry of D [Music] men everybody okay is not to capture everything that is plenty in the seven years are we together the ministry of this man is everything that is plenty everything that is plenty all the plenty of the seven years amen you only take what you take a fif of it everybody okay and the fif need to be what stored let me help you now how will be the fine severe very what Grievous and in order to withstand that fine you following me only only a fif are we reading different Bible okay let's read my friend let's read let Pharaoh do this let him appoint officer over the land and take up what at the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the what seven plest years so you take seven plenty years and you take the fifth part of it amen and you store it so the ministry of Joseph is not to capture everything that goes during the seven years are you following me are you following me so during the seven years Joseph has a Ministry his ministry is not everything that is coming up in the seven years the ministry of Joseph is that when the years of plenty are going Joseph will suddenly begin to catch certain food do you follow me do you follow me we have first year we have second year we have third year we have four fourth year we have the fifth one we have the sixth one and the Seven all this year will be plenty amen and the sum of these years we will take a fifth part of it amen so throughout the seven years Joseph if this year produce 100% Joseph cannot take 100% Jo can I continue now can I continue sir can I continue amen can I continue so if this year produce 100% Joseph would take a certain percentage I'm just picking up a number can I pick up a percentage what how much do you want me to pick up 20 20 right me and you agree so it's me and brother Angelo it's not a quote okay we just taken an example so in other word when this year produce 100% 80% goes to the population enjoy and do what you want to do everybody okay and 20% will disappear from the population in other word no matter how much you going to leave in this year you will be missing 20% let me help you up quickly no matter how much blessing God go will bring into the first year there will be a portion of that blessing that will be lost are we together do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me so in the year the first year according to whatever we agree with brother Angelo 80% will be given to the population but 20% will be lost from the hand of the population and 20% will belong to the ministry of Joseph so Joseph is not really interested in 80% Joseph always look for a percentage that he can retrieve from the population and the population of that year will never have access to that 20% can I help you up this 20% can never be used during the seven years they are taken for the year of famine everybody okay everybody okay is it too hard my friend so the second year Joseph will take 20% the third year Joseph would take 20% the fourth that's this is what we agree and then 20% and then 20% and then 20% so at the end of 7 years we ended up with 140% this percentage nobody have access to it nobody can eat this wheat only Joseph can deliver that wheat are we together are we together I'm going to help you up just follow me we'll be okay job to verse 35 amen amen and let them do what gather all the what food of those good years that come and lay that what corn under the hand of pharaoh under the hand of who Pharaoh so this 140% doesn't belong to the people of Egypt amen amen amen he belongs to Pharaoh so Joseph is taking 20% off from you and keep it back to Pharaoh it's given to Pharaoh it's going to do you good my friend do you see why I told you if I can deliver 5% everybody okay what are you trying to say brother Steven before I get lost more are we together are we together the ministry of Joseph is not to capture 80% of food Joseph only captured 20% of what happened in other words every year will lose food there will be certain food that will escape the people and be store back to Pharaoh everybody okay so the ministry of Joseph is now really a Ministry that is coming to bring you 80% every year Joseph has a Ministry and his ministry is to gather up Amen to gather up to gather up the food that has been lost amen amen amen through the seven years amen and story back for the time of famine amen hallelujah are you together so no matter have G views that feminis do you follow me no matter how great the femine is 80% will never match that femine as much as 80% seems to be big to us if you store 80% the fine will overcome you you have to take only a fif per a fif of it this fifth here is sufficient to withstand the greatest femine that is bigger than all the seven years because the thief is taken out of all the seven years and it's taken in storage to withstand what is coming com up so the future hunger can only be satisfied by the food that was collected throughout the seven years hallu if you are hungry on the during the year of Hing you only can get food from the food that were collected so if you ask Joseph you say Joseph which year of of of uh of uh of corn do you have do you have the first year of corn do you have the second year of corn do you have the third year of corn or the fourth year Joseph say truly I don't have a specific day my corn got everything so in my corn I have the first year I have the second year I have the third year I have the fourth year and I also have the seven years so my Ministry is not a specific Ministry it is a Ministry that is gathering up the seven Church ages [Applause] amen everybody together amen are we climbing up together am ah my friend let's go ahead and sett this before I take off again higher if I lost you raise your hand GL GL GL it's a different Canon my friend Amen brother I'm saying now sending what for this messenger the what seventh angel here is sending forth what his message to who to the leodan church notice his type of message now he was not to the first Angel was not given to that second Angel no third no fourth no fifth no sixth no but it is to who the seventh angel that had what this type of message what was it notice his type of what message for the second time his message is to do what finishing all the mysteries of God to finish all the Mysteries mysteries of God that are written in the what book and the Seven Angel is doing what winding up all the mystery that has been laid what loose ended all through this what organization and what denomination the seven Ang gathered them up and finish the what the entire mystery that is what the Bible say he finished the mystery of the what written book so the message of brother Bram is not a message of one age amen it is a message that is gathering up the loose end that were lost throughout the ages amen and because of this loose end that's why the devil always make the church fall because the church never had 100% the population was never exposed to 100% of whe the population always took 80% and the devil attack where they're missing there it is are we together are we together so when the devil approaches you he will check he say they can match 80% the devil say no if I attack him on 10% they're going to win me if I attack on 20 they will win if I attack on 80 they will win let me attack them between 90 and 100 and as soon as he hit that spot you are empty you don't have the food to withstand the devil in that aspect that's why Luther became a denomination everybody okay that's why Wesley became a denomination that's why the Pentecostal are going the way they're going because they cannot have the full access to the food but every year God has been taking certain things off God was taking certain crumbs off everybody okay but the end time Messenger will take all this mystery here and put back together so now the devil doesn't know where to go if he attack me the way he attack Luther I have Luther answering if he attacked me the way he attacked Pentecost I have the Pentecost what the meod miss a heaven what Paul miss a heaven amen because Paul preaching what I'm preaching is not important I am preaching the full revelation of God and I got the devil answer so no matter which way the devil is coming makon will always satisfy him because the devil at the end time will be bad he will be more severe than the devil at the beginning because the last stage will gather all the demon together that's why you need a Ministry that gather up all the loser in order to produce the the answers to the devil are we together amen are we together did you find yourself back let's go ahead my friend brother Bram say until he come to water that last angel now he say what no certain Mi mystery so the message of brother Bram you cannot pinpointed to one you cannot you cannot say that the food of Joseph is for the first year no it is the food that is mixed with all the years it is an amalgamation of the year it is a mixture of the years amen everybody okay he says but he does what gathers up all what all that has been what lost in them what other ages all truth that was not what truly revealed yet because the people of Egypt never tested the 20% every year they can test the 80% but they are certain meat that if you ask them do you know this kind of meat say mm we never were exposed to it why because Joseph took it away everybody okay he says as re as a revelation come then he revealed those things where in his days if you want to read it where is it Revelation 10 one to about what you shall get it take the book and the what seal and do what break them and show the seven Angel for this alone only Joseph has the miss myores of God is the ministry of the what seventh Angels now we just come through the church ages with even history and prove that it is the Angel's message of the seven Church all right who does what Reveals All the Mysteries that has been in the P all the things in the so the corn of Joseph is not a new corn it is the corn of the past year that have been store up for the future yous everybody okay amen all things in the water Revelation 101 to what that is to be now remember in the days of what the seventh angel what will happen in that day he sounding forth and I and after he sound what happen blasting forth the gospel trumpet and what will happen he is to finish all the mysteries of God all the loose part of the seven years will be captured by Joseph and put in store for the future yous any question so far are we together where are we at my friend job now job now to verse 36 and that food shall be for what store I have quot where God told Brother brandham store up the food do you remember that do you remember that brother Bram had a vision they told him store up the food Joseph is the one that store up the food he's the one that break the seals he's the one that preaches the seven Church agent and his ministry gather up all the lose end to take care of the future fine and that femine is a bad femine so in order to withand that femine you have to meet Joseph everybody okay you know our Joseph today thank you let's continue my friend we there amen we there amen verse 36 and the food shall be for store to the land against what the seven years years of famine it is not all this food that's going to fight the seven years of Egypt it is only a fifth of this food which is a mixture of the food that is what you need for the seven years it looks so small when they say the seven years is so bad what you will try to do is you know what let's eat 20% Let's uh keep 80% let's keep 80% God does a like that he's a god of paradox he said you take 80% and you give me 20% but I'm going to show you that that 20% what he can do are you together are you together are we together okay let's go to verse uh seven and against the seven years of what famine famine which shall be in the land of what Egypt that the land perisheth not through the what remember according to Joseph he Tau his ministry the fifth part will only save Egypt but you're going to see how much he's going to save it looks like when Joseph is preaching when Joseph is gathering the food he's preparing the food only for the land of Egypt but the food was not only for the land of Egypt am even the people that were far off amen when they heard that they are foood in Egypt when I heard in Africa that they was foood in Egypt Hallelujah when you heard from South America that they were food in Egypt when you heard from Europe that there were food in Egypt so the food as much as it looks small it is not really small [Applause] amen H everybody together is this gun too strong is it too strong we okay my friend thank you it's going to do you good if you let me move on are We There amen are we there amen we on verse 37 I'm just at the reading of the scripture I told you 5% the Bible says verse 37 and this thing was what good in who the eyes of pharaoh and the eyes of what all his servants and Pharaoh said to his servant what can we find such a one as this that is what a man in whom the spirit of God Is So Joseph had the spirit of God Amen so how Joseph had the Holy Ghost amen our Joseph this Joseph right here was filled with the Holy Ghost he got the holy ghost from a Pentecost church because the Pentecost have to give him the Baton that's why he have to take from a Pentecostal the Pentecost move started with a black man and that's why brother Bram have to receive the holy ghost in a black church put me on Facebook put me on Facebook so that he can grab the Baton from the Pentecostal because he's the last one he need to get it from the Shar the shark have to protect him and after while the shark have to p because the seed shall not be a with the Shar that's why when they forsake you it's a good sign it means that it's maturity when I'm maturing everybody that is a Shar need to pull off all your friends need to pull off everybody need to pull off am the one that will stay with me is a seed Hallelujah don't worry about separation it's a good sign it means I'm growing up are we together we good Mama praise God let's go verse uh where am I at 39 verse 39 glory to God verse 39 and Jo and Pharaoh said to who Joseph for as much as God has not what show thee all this there is none so what discreet and wise as what are so who's going to take that position Joseph and who is our Joseph who takes that position William Mar Brandon I love it William Marion Bram everybody else is an officer your pastor is an officer there is no replacement for brother BR there is no eth messenger there is no big Minister there is no big Pastor in this message amen the only one that is big is William Mayan br amen say amen [Music] amen [Music] hallah I have a quot that I can show you that there is no big pastor but I keep it for the fighers so when they're coming up under the tunnel I know how to get into the tunnel everybody okay amen everybody okay amen everybody good amen verse 40 you shall be of a what my house can you say amen amen you shall be off a what my house so Joseph is over the house of God Amen let's go slowly relax my friend you grown up now spoken well you can chew this kind of food this is steak without blood okay it's well done you will be off my what house and what else ACC according unto Thy word according unto what Thy word shall all my people be what ruled that's why we are ruled by the message a message church is ruled by the message of William Mar BR amen it is not ruled by the opinion of the pastor [Applause] amen you want to do something give me a c I want to see what the authorized mouth say Hallelujah the way we sing is according to what Bram saying the way we preach is according to what Branham say the way we interpret the Bible is according to William Maran Bram amen not according to us because the vision is not given to us we are officer we are under the command we follow the instruction of Joseph everybody good aen everybody good amen is he shaking Devils out amen those that are sick should begin to get healed now hallelujah oh oh oh oh you want me to lay hand on you the word everybody okay everybody okay can you swallow what is coming up amen can you swallow what is coming up a do you promise you're going to swallow it if I read it you will swallow it really sister really my friend what Elijah you going to swallow it let's go my friend okay let's go my friend verse 4 do you shall be of what my house and according to who Thy word shall all my people be what rued only in the what Throne will I be what greater than thou so it is very easy to be [Applause] confused between pharaoh and Joseph come on that's why John in the Book of Revelation twice he fell before the angel and tried to worship Him and the angel said don't do that because only the throne only the throne only the throne is the difference the only one sitting in the throne is Jesus [Applause] Christ everybody okay because when God came down in human flesh God turned the back and when God came down in this he was not God he was not the man Jesus he was William Maran Bram but he's not on the throne the only difference is the [Applause] throne that's why we don't worship him we worship Jesus Christ because we understand the difference that as much as God use him he's not on the throne the one on the throne is [Applause] Pharaoh Have I Lost somebody in the back are we okay are we okay my friend have I lost somebody here I pray God if I can reach 5% my friend can we continue can we continue amen can we continue amen verse 41 and Pharaoh said to who Joseph see I have set you off water all the land of Egypt somebody is lost let's go back to verse 40 you shall be of a water my house and according to the what Thy word have you seen in the scripture where they say House of Aaron House of Moses and they and they are cting the priesthood the Bible say Moses built a house which house did Moses built was he the house of Moses who was over the house God Solomon built a house was he the Temple of Solomon he was the Temple of who but Solomon was in charge that's right Joseph is over the house of pharaoh he knows he he he's he's the the the the the caliber of the spirit in Joseph Pharaoh can leave everything and take his hand off and Pharaoh can travel in the universe because Joseph will do exactly the way a prophet interpret a dream a prophet must see the dream himself in other word the prophet must get in your mind so what happened is Joseph got Inside the Mind of pharaoh and saw what Pharaoh saw and he came back and interpreted and William Mar Bram went in the back path in the mind of God and what he's preaching is what he saw inside the [Applause] mind that's why brother Bram can tell you I can take you to a dream I'm standing and I'm watching the Pillar of Fire playing like a baby in the universe where is he seeing that have you heard a preacher preaching that you got to go back before the beginning not in the beginning in the beginning it start in Genesis 1:1 in order to go before the beginning the key the entrance is not Genesis one the entrance is in John John chapter 1 one in the beginning was the word that's where you entered there and then you back up from there and you go before the [Applause] beginning Have I Lost somebody have I lost someone are we together amen is the CPR Good Sister Amy the breathing Hallelujah are we together now no more we back on track let's continue what was it 41 verse 41 and Pharaoh said to who Joseph she say what I have set over I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off what his ring amen and did what from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand so the Ring of pharaoh is no longer in the finger of pharaoh it is in the finger of of Joseph amen you remember how the Ring of King Aus was taken off and given to Esther it mean whatever you say you can sanction it [Applause] amen in other words Pharaoh knows that Joseph cannot abuse the power even if people are doing something wrong in the church when they say Pharaoh speak the word Joseph speak the word Joseph will look and say I forgive them and God say that's exactly the way I would [Applause] Rea are we together are we together are we together good if you sleep today you got a problem my friend where are we my friend 42 let's go and he put off his wing on what from his hand and did what put it upon Joseph and array what him in vestures of fine linen stop fine Lon means what the righteousness of the what saint any question any question let me continue my friend so we can move and put a what a gold chain around around what his neck gold means what deity let me go up quickly my friend let's go to verse 42 and what is he made him to ride how in the second Chariot not the first Chariot he's on the second position Hallelujah he's on the second position not the first one the first one is the king himself but on the second un command from from Enoch to him there is nobody that is like brother Bram the only one that is above him is Jesus Christ when son when when Jesus come Solomon was the greater of all when Jesus come he said there is a greater Solon when brother Bram come he preaches he said there is a greater than all of [Applause] them the difference is in the second Chariot only the throne is above that's why we don't worship him but we worship this one are we together are we together are we together amen can I continue amen let's go and and he made him ride in the water second Chariot which he had and they CED before who him do what bow the knee bow their knees and made him what ruler over all the land of Egypt are we together amen jum to verse 47 my friend who have a confusion now who's uh uh uh Joseph you know who Joseph is now right you know his ministry now let's see the fif what has going what is going on with the fief let's go to verse 47 don't be tired my friend I'm just at the beginning of my scripture don't be tired everybody okay verse 47 and in the seven years in the seven PL years what happened the Earth brought forth by handfuls so it happened abundantly verse 48 and what and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of what Egypt and laid up the food F in the water cities and the food of the water field which was what round about every city he laid up what in the same verse 49 let's go my friend and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much let's go slowly my friend let's go school school zone 15 miles hour Joseph gather up what corn as what the sand of the sea let me ask you a question what is how many corn is he getting when I told you a fif you thought you were small but the scripture said the fif was like what of the sea do we have a number for that can I continue it's like the sand of the sea go ahead my friend very much very much until he left numbering for he was what without number so the food that was gathered throughout the seven years was a food that have not a number it is a food that is so much until you cannot put a stop and say we reach the end of it that's why this message every time we preach it seems like it keep up opening up opening up it looks like the Bible never stop amen it is the food of it's the fifth part this part here is unlimited are we together are we together that's why you listen to a tape you go back again you listen and something open up and after two years it open up because you cannot put a stop into this Revelation this is an unlimited message amen that's why there is no other message like this one and it is the last message because it's God on unlimited power are we together in order to withstand the seven Grievious year of Egypt you only need a food that is Unlimited in a power in other words the seven years can come as the coming we don't have a number if it's a first year we keep pulling up and the first year say yes I'm satisfied next year I'm satisfied until even at the seven year we still have food because it's unlimited that's why that food was not only for Egypt that's why that food could serve ad na because he was Unlimited in the power Unlimited in the number you cannot put a full stop how many roofs sermon did we preach how many 90 what if a subject in roof can take 91 before I get to Genesis how much are we going to come out [Music] with are we together jump to verse 53 my friend if you thereare you can say amen amen and the what seven years of plenteousness don't wait for me to like I finish my my reading I have not finished yet I'm 30% of the reading let's go my friend let's go and the seven years of what plenteousness was in the land of what Egypt where what ended and the seven years of what d d means famine be began to come according to as who Joseph had said and the D was in all the land but in the land of Egypt there was what bread do you see how they call that they don't call that corn there was what bread give us this day our daily bread now we start getting we clear jum to verse 55 and when all the land of what Egypt was what famish the the people did what CED to pH sorry let's go slowly the people cried to Joseph no they cried to who Pharaoh because when Joseph was gathering all the food he was gathering them under the custody of who Pharaoh so when you cry you cry to who Pharaoh for the first time the entire land of Egypt is crying to Pharaoh so the famine is used hunger is used to begin to bring Egypt back to Pharaoh are we okay are we okay Have I Lost You Have I Lost You I ask you a question I is I say what is the purpose of the famine why do we need the famine what is the purpose of a famine being more Grievous than the Plenty year there is a purpose for a famine father help me remember this back up pretty good okay as we claming in Matthew what did he say give us this day our what our daily bread look what did he say give us day by day our what Daily Bread who is asking us a child asking to who father if the hunger never came are we okay now if that child was never hungry will we remember to go back to his father so the hunger of a child is an opportunity to bring the child back to the father amen are we together are we together are we together are we together let me help you up whoever is struggling a father have two sons you know the name right it is the story of what the prodal Son and the younger one say no Daddy give me my stuff I go they give him his staff and he went what did he do he spend it with prostitute he spend it in the nightclub he did everything when the money was finished did he go back he found the job when he found the job did he go back when hunger famine when famine came in the land everybody okay everybody okay and he begin to eat with the pigs that's when the Bible say he came to himself so it took fine to bring the Revelation amen [Applause] are you following me we are teaching you how to pray it took the hunger am every every disappointment never brought that child back to God sir his friend steal his money he never went back the prostitute took his money he never went back he went and hire himself he never went back but when famine HD him when hunger HD him it was Hunger that brought him back to a revelation like wait a minute why am I suffering like this and not having food while in My Father's House the servant have plenty so famine was used to bring the child back famine was used to bring the child back to his original position together God sent plenty and then God sent also severe famine but what is the purpose of a famine he took whatever was Store and put it back in the hand of pharaoh so now all Egypt have to look up to one person even if you didn't like Pharaoh even if you are against pharaoh even if you were against his politics but when something hit you you forgetting about the politics you forgetting about the way he's ruling the nation you know where man where where can we find food there is only one place to find food it is in pharaoh who are you going to cry to Pharaoh whether you like him or not you going back to Pharaoh so feminine hunger is used to capture Egypt back into Pharaoh can I continue now Egypt is not self dependent Egypt now begin to learn to depend on a [Applause] ruler at the beginning every Egyptian were going to their field and they were minding their business and when they open the channel or Pharaoh is speaking something they slip the channel they say I don't want to see things about Pharaoh let me watch something on Netflix but when hunger put nobody was watching Netflix everybody want to know what is the speech of pharaoh what is Pharaoh saying from the white house because our life depend on Pharaoh our food depend on Pharaoh our substance depend on Pharaoh our survivor depend on pharaoh [Applause] Have I Lost somebody are we together am Are You full I have not finished reading the Bible can we continue amen where were we at my friend 55 verse 40 verse 55 let's go and the famine was what go ahead verse 55 and when all the land of what Egypt was what famished the people did what cried to Pharaoh they cried to Pharaoh because they knew the bread belonged to Pharaoh if you can get the 1 15% the fif of the bread you need to go back to Pharaoh because Joseph told them H everything belong to Pharaoh in other words the ministry of Joseph oh Lord spoken word if you can get it I will stop until you get this message and then I will stop and teach you later by later if you don't get it the ministry of pH of of Joseph is to bring a close relationship between the Egyptian and Pharaoh Joseph never brought a Ministry to bring the people to him but it is a Ministry that all Egypt now will go back to pharaoh and Pharaoh will have a relationship with his people but it take hunger it take famine if somebody sleeping Shake him my friend you have to get this thing everybody okay everybody good everybody good everybody good amen go ahead my friend and the people did what the people cry up to who Pharaoh watch carefully let's go slowly my the people did what CED to Pharaoh cried to Pharaoh for what bread they didn't say Pharaoh give us corn they say Pharaoh give us what bread give us this day our daily bread The Daily Bread of the Egyptian now depend to Pharaoh every day the Egyptian must go to Pharaoh am and say Pharaoh give me my daily bread your day by day bread [Applause] H belong to who Pharaoh teach us to

business depend on you my children depend on you if you don't do something have done when God hears that he said that's the Revelation I was looking for open the storehouse until Christ get the preeminence amen until Pharaoh get the first place amen not the preeminence is Jesus Christ but the preeminence in the [Applause] [Music] Brad what pray for me if I can reach 5% you understand when I told you 5% do you understand now can we continue can we continue we need to stop praying like Pentecostal amen hallelujah we don't shoot like that we sat with precision and we look at the Target when I shoot to kill when I shoot to kill when I shoot to kill and I stand up I say thank you Father see you tomorrow [Applause] again why should you pray in the air why should you pray with empty word oh God oh God oh slow down cry out to Pharaoh remember he's the president the people cried to Pharaoh for what bread not for corn for bread give us this day our what Daily Bread who did that Joseph yes sir Joseph did it so the people will begin to depend so the hunger the fine has a purpose is to bring you the Wilderness have a purpose I pass you through the Wilderness to teach you so I can begin to bring you back hallah that's why I left you finish all your resources because I know I have Mana but you won't like Mana because you got your resources let me DND your resources let me finish all your

Joseph say do what do whatever the Prophet say do what do because believe in my prophet and you shall prosper whatever brother Brown I'm saying do amen let me rephrase it again whatever William Marion Bram say we do [Music] amen because he's the only one that got the answer for this age he's the only one that can provide the bread for the hour the bread of this day is not in the Pentecostal it is in William Mar BR amen Pharaoh never say certain things Joseph say do in other word what Joseph say is a command of pharaoh that's the reason why we read quotes if you ever ask yourself why do we read quotes we read quotes because quotes are that save the Lord amen we are not feeding on the word of man we are feeding upon the unfailing of the [Applause] who so when we say brother Bram say we are saying Joseph [Applause] say yes sir can I continue sister Faith she said go ahead so you in trouble my friend go ahead my friend 56 and the I have to touch up here and the and then I'm moving go ahead my friend and the famine and the famine was what over all the face of the Earth stop the famine was not just in Egypt the famine that came was affecting what of the Earth the entire world so now father help me Father help me listen to what he's telling me okay he's telling me that the ministry of Joseph is to expand the Dominion of pharaoh not only to Egypt so that Pharaoh can rule the entire world in other words Pharaoh is recuperating territory because of femine when femine hit you you become slave to Pharaoh even if you in Africa if femine hit you and Africa you become slave to Pharaoh if famine reach you in America you need to search Pharaoh because the entire world depend on [Applause] Pharaoh if you never had a Clear Vision of this message today is your day if you have question today is your day I'm pulling everything from the scripture can I continue glory to God where are we my friend let's go 56 the fine was what all over all the face of the Earth continue and Joseph opened all the storehouses and did what sold unto the Egyptians uhhuh and the famine waxed sore in the land in other words God is increasing the temperature Egypt is okay but God have children there

all the lands of what all lands of what all land of what in all land thank you now we understand the ministry of Joseph is to seize the opportunity by hunger by famine to provide food food and to bring the whole land of Egypt back to pharaoh to ask for bread but we begin to see that his influence now is no longer only limited to the country he's operating amen his influence begin to leave America begin to leave Egypt and begin to extend to other country and other country begin to heal the word that there is corn in Egypt and Faith cometh by what hearing hearing what word can I continue second scripture Genesis chapter 42 my friend don't worry let's go as far as we can okay don't worry about the time take that clock put them under your foot okay I know what to do everybody okay amen Genesis 42 verse what one it's on the board let's go verse one now what when Jacob did what saw that there was corn in Egypt ah now the influence of Egypt went to the land of Judah so it's a ministry that's going to do something to the Jew [Applause] [Music] amen are you lost the seven seal to the Gentile is what it's the seven trumpet to the Jews that's what brother Bram did say can I continue remember Joseph looked for Benjamin but Benjamin cannot go to Egypt when in the years of plenty only when it's famine that's the time to catch Benjamin can I continue amen can I continue amen father help me let's go to verse one my friend let's go when who Jacob saw that what there was corn in Egypt Jacob said to who his sons he said to his son what why do you look one upon another in other word what are you wasting your time here everybody's waking up in the morning Jacob say you didn't hear the news which news there is food food where in Egypt they say there is a man there called Za Joseph changed the name so that the Jew don't know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him can I continue it's written in your Bible my friend please don't do me like this we clear okay let's go my friend and and he said what verse two behold behold what I have heard that there is corn in in Egypt get get you what down tither down down there and do what and buy for us from Den from that place that we may what live and what not die the survival of the Jews is now back into the hand of Joseph amen by famine famine is on is affecting everyone and it's bringing everybody back to Bow before Pharaoh can I continue amen let's go to verse three and Joseph's 10 Brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt how many brothers was left 10 did you see Benjamin going no so when the fine came everybody okay it is the femine that begin to bring Joseph brother back to him it is the femine that brought the prodigal son back home it is the hunger that brought Egypt back to Pharaoh but Israel do not understand the mystery yet they say you know what everybody go let's keep Benjamin I don't want to lose Benjamin do you know what happened I'm not going to read the whole thing you know the story Jump to verse 38 father help me I'm I'm skipping all of this because you know they went there they pick up Simeon and they kept Simeon and everything you know what happened let's go to verse 38 if you thereare you can say amen amen let's go and he said what my son shall what not go down this is Jacob because they kept Simon and when they kept can you check that one when they kept Simeon do you know what happened when they kept Simeon they say you cannot I mean take him until we see the younger one when they went they told the father they say Simon is kept we cannot pull him up from there because uh the boss say we need Benjamin do you know you know what happened Jacob say no I already lost Joseph I'm not going to lose Benjamin do you know why because he got corn he got bread when he got bread he disregard he disregard the order of Joseph or maybe it's me and him are we together it's the devil if you want me to change I get the Bazooka you want me to change my friend praise God is that good now amen I just leave here so forget about it we clear amen so now they told Jacob they say bring Joseph uh bring Benjamin he says no no no no no no no no no why he got food do you know what happened God increased fine I'm going to go slowly and you see what happened verse 30 and he say what my son shall what not go down with you for his brother is what dead and he's left what alone do you see the uh the the ignorance of the Jew he need to be removed by Joseph continue my friend if Mischief befall him by the way in the which you go uhuh then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the Grave so bottom line Jacob say he's not going he's staying here they say well but the men say if we go there we cannot go back to Egypt until we bring Benjamin they stop down question why didn't he have an idea to pick up anybody else and to use him in the place of Benjamin because this ministry will begin to trouble to remove your trouble and begin to bring sincerity because they to lie but this ministry begin to bring them that they realize they need to be back to the truth everybody okay but as long as they brought food down to Egypt Jacob said no guess what everybody sat down they begin to eat food after a while food is finished let's go to 43 chapter 4 three if you dare you can say Amen let's go to verse one what happened again and the famine was what he was soaring the land now word god increased the temperature say Jacob I know what to do let me use up again the femine to finish everything that you have and I'm going to see how you going to stay here everybody okay and he came to pass when they had what you don't have a volume I can't hear you when you have what no don't worry my friend devil whichever way you going get this my friend brother the David try this one do you see why he's fighting praise God let's go he said and it came to pass when they have eaten up all the water corn do you see that when food is there you don't remember the father you don't fall under the leadership of pharaoh God continue with the fine to bring you back again he said the hunger he says and they and they eat up The Corn which they had brought out of what Egypt their father said to them what go again and do what buy us a little food and Judah spoke saying what the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except what your brother be with you in other word you must produce Benjamin or you going to die amen amen so femin is used to bring the brother of Joseph and Benjamin back to Egypt and let me use this again if you can swallow it can I continue can I drop something he was this famine it was this hunger that took all Israel even Jacob and took the whole Jewish race and put them back in go [Music] in other word god used the famine to relocate Israel back to aan [Music] amen so now faming to you you begin to see feminine a different eyes your perspective has changed now the femin is not to kill [Applause] you your trouble is not to

pharaoh and give us what seed he begin to call that what seed they spoken word is the Original Seed let's go my friend that we may do What live and not what die that the land will be not what desolate verse 20 and Joseph brought what all the land of Egypt for for Pharaoh so all Egypt belong to who now pharaoh who can brag anything nobody even if you have a house we all know that house belong to Pharaoh am you're just a renter you're just a servant you're just an employee for Pharaoh I'm an employee to Pharaoh so let's be nice to one another okay don't come and brag because all our stuff belong to Pharaoh I know your house belong to pharoh I know your clo to Pharaoh I know the car you driving belong to Pharaoh so chill out if you put it on WhatsApp I look and say Pharaoh you put it on Instagram and say Pharaoh everybody okay let's go to verse uh 20 uh 20 and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for who Pharaoh for the Egyptian sold what every man his field because the famine did what prevailed over them so the land became who Pharaoh remember the land is not Joseph it is pharaoh and as for the people he removed them uh to cities from one end of the body of Egypt even to the what other end thereof only the land of the what priest by brought he not I can't get to this teaching right here let me leave it alone if you notice they bought everybody not the priest because let me read and he say only the land of the what priest brought he what for the priest had a portion assigned to them by who of pharaoh because the land of the priest belong to Pharaoh so you cannot buy the Pharaoh Pharaoh's hand in other word the priest has an exemption that's why the priest could break the Sabbath that's why the priest could break the Sabbath and they are not found guilty because they're working for Jehovah they can work even in the Sabbath day but if you work on the Sabbath day it's sin spoken word spoken word amen let's go quickly and did eat the portion which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their what land because they already belong to who Pharaoh then F Joseph said to the people behold I have bought you this day and your land for who Pharaoh Lo here is seed for you and you shall SW what the land in other word hunger famine is used to bring a complete surrendering of the entire land of Egypt to the supremacy and the preeminence of pharaoh the corn and the bread and the seed of Joseph is powerful the seed of Joseph can produce a house the seed of of Joseph can produce people the seed of Joseph can produce cattle the seed of Joseph can produce money that's why when the third pool anointing came brother Bram begin to give at right option option of money option of healing option of this option of this because the third pole which is the message of can bring money it can bring it can bring it can bring anything amen because the third pool is the message it is the cor of Joseph it can produce [Applause] anything let's stop here my friend Hallelujah I cannot get to the material I have not finished my my uh reading we will read the other reading later let's stand teach us to pray the mystery of Redemptive hunger Why seven years of soreness Why seven Grievous years it is what God used it is what God used by sending a man into Egypt a prophet into Egypt with a Ministry that would take the entire land and bring it back to pharaoh and that Ministry if you an Egyptian if you are part of the Kingdom that ministry will break you down until everything that you are will be pharoh in other word you are Pharaoh the land of the Corn of Joseph remove the distinction that's right between pharaoh and Egypt at the beginning when you go to the land of Egypt you can say these are the people of Egypt this is the king of Egypt but after the bread of Joseph was given you can no longer say this is the people of Egypt all you see is Pharaoh because the people are pharaohs the money are Pharaoh the car are Pharaoh the house are Pharaoh the effect of this ministry when people see you they see Christ amen there is no more distinction between you and the Christ that's why the Brad is called M Jesus Christ amen everything that you are is Christ [Applause] amen Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly father Who Am I who are we to sit down and to hear things that we hearing it has nothing to do with me all is because of your grace how we misunderstood many things in our life and and we thought that you don't love us we thought that we have done something wrong but we did not understand that everything that you do in our life you did it for a purpose you sent the trial for a purpose father May whoever is going through a trial wake up and read the letter language of the trial to see if it's really a trial or it's really something that have a meaning that God is using to bring me more to him because there are aspect of my life that I have not surrendered yet there is too much me controlling my life there is too many doors that I have not open to the word to the ministry of Joseph but father now you spoke and I understand I begin to understand your language now I begin to see the purpose of the hunger that it's not to make us suffer but it's a hunger so that the word can have more effect in our life that the word can soak every aspect of our life that once we become servant of pharaoh we will no longer ask Pharaoh for bread because it's going to be Pharaoh responsibility to take care of his servant and to make sure that his servant are fed and his servant are paid and his servant are rewarded in other word everything that we bringing to you you just take it back and send it back again in our lap all you want us to understand is the source of the ownership that we don't have anything all that we are all that we have all that we have ever accomplished belongs to you father may you take this sermon may you give people the ability to go back and to sit down home not to listen to me but to listen to the message that you have given me to deliver so that they can try to glean a little bit more than what they got here sitting because I know what I got I know what you gave me you want to take them into a deeper depth than they can imagine so that they can see the Supernatural on daily basis father we thank you and commit everything unto the hand forgive me for going over time all I was trying to do father is to reach a point where I can let them into a certain level where they don't question many things yes but they can go home and from there they can meditate and catch what you're trying to tell them Lord bless them for this sacrifice let them focus on the word and not on pus and if that Terry come again and speak to us strengthen us father in Jesus precious name amen
