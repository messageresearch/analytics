[0:00] time his uncle had a daughter and it's
[0:02] down during the times of the reigns of
[0:04] the median persian
[0:05] it's a very beautiful type there the
[0:07] king
[0:08] one of the greatest kings in the world
[0:10] that day he had a great
[0:12] feast and he called the queen to come
[0:14] set by
[0:15] but she wouldn't do it she refused to do
[0:18] it
[0:18] so what did he do he was so uh
[0:21] humiliated didn't know what to do
[0:23] that his own life wouldn't come
[0:26] i think that's a whole lot like christ
[0:28] today christ has invited us to sit in
[0:31] heavenly places with him
[0:32] and we're ashamed of us many people are
[0:36] ashamed to say they forgot the baptism
[0:38] of the holy ghost pentecostal people
[0:44] they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed
[0:47] of him
[0:48] and so the queen wouldn't come she
[0:51] refused to come
[0:52] it humiliated him his face turned red
[0:55] everybody noticed i wonder if jesus's
[0:57] face don't turn a little red to
[0:59] when he calls on us for a work calls on
[1:02] the pentecostal movement for
[1:03] fellowship and brotherhood
[1:07] and we're so tightly organized little
[1:09] groups that we won't bend for the other
[1:12] we're so getting so worldly and things
[1:14] like that we're getting ashamed of
[1:16] the name of pentecost some people is
[1:18] afraid to say
[1:19] say well i belonged i'm a christian but
[1:22] i'm glad i got a pentecostal experience
[1:25] amen
[1:26] i'm glad to bear the name of jesus
[1:28] christ
[1:29] it's the greatest privilege i ever had
[1:32] will say i'm part of him
[1:35] now we find out then he got some
[1:38] consultants to ask what must he do and
[1:41] they said
[1:41] if this goes on like this all the rest
[1:45] of the women throughout the country
[1:46] will take the example of the first lady
[1:48] of course that's what's happening
[1:50] tonight
[1:52] i look at some of these women i hope i
[1:53] don't hurt your feelings and yet i
[1:55] hope i do trying
[1:58] trying to be this your first lady stuff
[2:00] these waterhead haircuts
[2:02] i've never seen such a thing in all my
[2:04] life
[2:06] the other day there's a woman come up in
[2:08] a store while i was waiting for my wife
[2:09] and that woman's head was that big and
[2:11] she had green paint under her eyes and i
[2:13] said go back booger man i'll be good
[2:17] it was scarier
[2:20] what is it the first lady
[2:25] it's a first lady that's it
[2:28] and they take an example by that and let
[2:31] me say this now i didn't say it jokingly
[2:33] but in a parable it you'd see that's
[2:36] exactly
[2:37] what you older christians are doing for
[2:39] these younger
[2:42] exactly right yeah i'll just say that
[2:44] again
[2:46] you're supposed to be examples right you
[2:50] pentecostals and profess to have the
[2:53] holy ghost
[2:54] you're supposed to be examples right you
[2:57] pentecostals that profess to have the
[3:00] holy

[44:31] so if it's your first time second time
[44:33] you're not a visitor
[44:34] you're a family member so welcome to
[44:37] spoken word tabernacle
[44:38] body elijah if you can turn on this
[44:42] in the book of matthew we have a baby
[44:44] dedication this morning
[44:46] brother john porter grandson
[44:50] and it's an honor for us
[44:53] to have the beautiful baby being
[44:55] dedicated this morning
[44:57] brother jeffrey is here with his lovely
[45:00] wife god bless you sister
[45:02] good to see you this morning and the
[45:03] family
[45:05] in the book of matthew the bible says
[45:07] that they brought leader children to
[45:09] jesus
[45:11] in the book of mark the bible say they
[45:13] brought leader children to jesus
[45:16] and brother branham used that scripture
[45:18] several times
[45:19] saying that he uses that scripture to
[45:22] bless babies
[45:24] so somebody must say they say little
[45:26] children they didn't say
[45:28] babies so how is he using that scripture
[45:31] to bless the babies
[45:33] let's go to the book of luke chapter 15.
[45:36] same version of that scripture the
[45:39] prophet
[45:40] is always lined up with the scripture
[45:44] amen luke chapter 18
[45:48] verse 15.
[45:52] matthew say little children we know a
[45:55] baby is a child
[45:57] but we want to help those that are still
[45:59] struggling
[46:00] with intellectual amen
[46:05] luke chapter 18 verse 15
[46:08] and they brought to him also water
[46:15] we clear now if you look at another
[46:18] translation it speaks of
[46:20] babies amen
[46:23] so brother branham was right
[46:28] all right praise the name of the lord
[46:30] and they brought
[46:31] unto him also infants or babies
[46:35] that he would touch them but when his
[46:38] disciples saw it
[46:39] they rebuked them but jesus called them
[46:42] to him
[46:42] and said permit allow
[46:46] little children to come to me and forbid
[46:49] them not
[46:50] for of such is the kingdom of god
[46:54] there is an old saying that they say
[46:56] that when a child is a little boy
[46:58] or a little girl she's going to be
[47:00] trampling on your feet
[47:03] and when they grow up they trample on
[47:05] your heart
[47:07] and people always believe that and i
[47:09] heard it
[47:10] among the message believer when they go
[47:13] to trouble with their children
[47:14] brother branham say that if a child is a
[47:17] little baby
[47:18] or a little infant they're going to
[47:20] trample on your feet and when they grow
[47:22] up they're going to
[47:23] trample on your heart let me read this
[47:26] quote a little bit
[47:28] to help you up you know when i see this
[47:31] old
[47:32] fellow like that and he always take me
[47:36] back when i was
[47:37] a little bully and now the old saying is
[47:41] you know
[47:42] they on your feet now
[47:45] because the babies the little kids and
[47:48] your heart
[47:49] later in other words we are built to
[47:52] expect trouble
[47:53] but this is what right now but i don't
[47:56] believe
[47:57] it will be so when we dedicate
[48:00] them to the lord
[48:06] so from now on if somebody tells you
[48:08] that tell them brother branham say
[48:10] if you dedicate your baby i don't
[48:13] believe it
[48:14] they're going to stay in line with the
[48:16] word of god
[48:18] amen so let's sing bring them in
[48:22] as we're going to dedicate the baby this
[48:23] morning amen
[48:25] we're going to call brother jeffrey your
[48:27] wife the baby
[48:28] and the grandparent
[48:32] sorry brother john but welcome to the
[48:34] clip of grandfathers

[53:27] let's stand for the reading of the bible
[53:30] ezra chapter 1. everybody receive a text
[53:34] for the reading
[53:38] few people
[53:41] amen unless you didn't subscribe
[53:46] if we got your number you receive a text
[53:49] ezra
[53:50] chapter one if you dare you can say amen
[53:55] praise the name of the lord now
[53:58] in the first year of cyrus
[54:01] king of persia that the word of the lord
[54:06] by the mouth of jeremiah might be
[54:09] fulfilled
[54:11] you might be seated
[54:15] if you watch the scripture this morning
[54:19] jeremiah prophesied
[54:23] and it took a while it seems like the
[54:25] prophecy
[54:26] of jeremiah would not come to pass
[54:30] israel was taken out in captivity
[54:33] but when the time of the prophecy
[54:37] according to god john 9
[54:42] something happened amen
[54:47] that the word of the lord by the mouth
[54:49] of jeremiah might be fulfilled
[54:52] the lord stirred up the spirit
[54:56] of cyrus king of
[54:59] persia so the spirit of saras
[55:02] was trouble was stirred
[55:07] because there was a prophecy and the
[55:10] prophecy
[55:10] must come to pass and for some reason
[55:14] god enter into a political world
[55:18] and stir the spirit of this king
[55:22] this king was living normally
[55:25] living peacefully in his kingdom and
[55:28] suddenly something struck him
[55:30] when that happened it didn't happen by
[55:33] any chance
[55:34] it happened because it was time for the
[55:37] prophecy
[55:38] to be fulfilled amen
[55:42] and he made that he made the
[55:44] proclamation throughout
[55:46] all his kingdom and put it also in
[55:48] writing saying
[55:50] that says cyrus king of persia
[55:53] the lord god of heaven has given me all
[55:56] the kingdoms
[55:57] of the earth and he has charged me
[56:01] to build him a house at jerusalem
[56:04] which is in judah so whatever is
[56:07] happening
[56:08] it's not happening by any chance modern
[56:11] events
[56:12] are made clear by prophecy
[56:15] amen let's go to psalm chapter 83
[56:23] somebody will say we don't know what
[56:24] happened to this king he begin to make
[56:26] such a declaration such a proclamation
[56:29] it doesn't happen by any chance all is
[56:32] controlled
[56:33] by prophecy everything controlled
[56:36] by god amen
[56:40] psalm chapter 83 verse 1
[56:43] a song or psalm of azer keep not
[56:47] your sound your silence o god hold not
[56:50] your peace
[56:51] and be not still o god follow your
[56:54] enemies make it tunneled david doesn't
[56:58] call them
[56:59] his enemies he's calling them the
[57:02] enemies of god
[57:04] amen your enemies make a tumult
[57:07] and they die hate you they are heading
[57:10] god
[57:11] not david it seems like they're heading
[57:13] you they don't hate you
[57:15] they are having the god that you serve
[57:18] amen
[57:19] and they that hate you have lift up the
[57:22] head
[57:23] they have taken crafty console against
[57:26] your people
[57:28] by taking crafty council against the
[57:30] people of god you are attacking god
[57:33] because god spoke to soul soul soul why
[57:36] are they persecuting me he was not
[57:39] persecuting the man
[57:41] jesus christ but saul was persecuting
[57:43] the church
[57:44] everybody clear they have taken crafty
[57:47] council against your people
[57:49] and consulted against your hidden ones
[57:52] they are hidden somewhere
[57:54] they have said come and let us cut them
[57:57] off
[57:57] from being a nation so somebody is
[58:00] against the people of god
[58:02] somebody is against israel somebody is
[58:04] against the nation of god
[58:06] and they're trying to wipe completely
[58:08] the nation of god
[58:10] amen that the name of israel might be no
[58:13] more in remembrance
[58:15] so they want to destroy not only the
[58:18] nation but erase the name of israel
[58:21] but we know that israel is god's
[58:23] redemptive name
[58:24] for his church amen for they have
[58:27] consulted together with one consent
[58:30] and they are confederate it's a union a
[58:34] confederation
[58:36] of churches they are confederate
[58:39] against you where is that god
[58:42] amen the tabernacles of edom
[58:48] and an ishmaelite of moab
[58:53] and the hagarins verse seven
[58:56] kiba and emon and amalek
[59:00] amen the philistine with the inhabitant
[59:04] of tara so amalek we are dealing with
[59:07] amalek here
[59:08] but we found out that amalek is not
[59:10] alone now
[59:12] amalek is going into the confederation
[59:15] of churches
[59:16] the confederation of tabernacle he's
[59:19] pulling
[59:20] edom esau he's pulling moab the
[59:22] nomination
[59:23] they are bringing them together even the
[59:25] ishmaelites
[59:27] in other words the confederation of
[59:29] churches
[59:30] god even muslim insider amen
[59:34] but they are all confederate
[59:37] against the people of god amen
[59:41] and david is crying unto the lord to
[59:43] intervene
[59:44] because there is a confederation of
[59:46] tabernacles
[59:48] a confederation of churches that is
[59:50] rising up against
[59:52] his nation we know david is a prophet
[59:55] let's go to acts chapter 7 then we will
[59:58] pray
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:03] act chapter 7
[1:00:10] verse 6. if you dare
[1:00:14] you can say amen
[1:00:22] act chapter 7
[1:00:25] verse 6 and god spoke on this was
[1:00:30] that his seed should adjourn
[1:00:33] in a strange land and that they should
[1:00:36] bring them
[1:00:37] into bondage and entreat them evil
[1:00:41] 400 years that was a prophecy given to
[1:00:43] abraham
[1:00:44] israel will go into egypt everything
[1:00:47] will be calm
[1:00:48] everything will be nice because joseph
[1:00:51] will be there
[1:00:53] joseph will be the prophet bringing a
[1:00:55] great message
[1:00:57] but suddenly something will happen there
[1:00:59] will be a flip
[1:01:01] amen verse 7
[1:01:05] and the nation to whom they shall be in
[1:01:07] bondage will i
[1:01:08] judge say god and after
[1:01:12] that shall they come forth and serve me
[1:01:15] in this place job to verse 17
[1:01:20] amen this is the key for this sermon
[1:01:24] this morning
[1:01:25] but when the time of the promise drew
[1:01:29] now so everything
[1:01:32] is controlled by prophecy amen
[1:01:36] everything was fine then trouble comes
[1:01:41] when trouble comes there is a
[1:01:44] significance to your trouble
[1:01:46] it means that there is something that
[1:01:49] god is trying to
[1:01:51] accomplish there is something that god
[1:01:54] is trying to fulfill
[1:01:56] amen so when the time of the promise
[1:01:59] erav
[1:02:00] trouble started
[1:02:04] so when you see trouble don't be
[1:02:06] discouraged
[1:02:07] there is a message to it amen
[1:02:10] but when the time of the promised
[1:02:12] juvenile
[1:02:14] which god had sown to abraham we just
[1:02:16] read the promise
[1:02:17] on verse six the people grew
[1:02:21] and multiplied in egypt till
[1:02:24] another king arose another pharaoh
[1:02:28] which knew not who we already preached
[1:02:32] about this one
[1:02:33] joseph was a mighty prophet the first
[1:02:36] pharaoh
[1:02:37] loved joseph the first pharaoh believed
[1:02:40] the message of joseph
[1:02:42] but another pharaoh came another spirit
[1:02:45] came
[1:02:46] that spirit rejects the prophet of the
[1:02:48] hour
[1:02:50] amen when he's rejecting the prophet of
[1:02:53] the hour
[1:02:53] it's bringing persecution to the church
[1:02:56] but that persecution does not happen by
[1:02:59] any chance
[1:03:00] the rejection and the persecution is
[1:03:03] only
[1:03:04] telling you that the time of the
[1:03:07] exodus has come the time
[1:03:10] of the promise of god has come the time
[1:03:14] to leave this earth
[1:03:15] has come the time has joined now
[1:03:19] that's why the spirit of saras is turned
[1:03:22] that's why the pharaoh changed that's
[1:03:25] why pharaoh is rejecting
[1:03:27] the message of joseph that's why the
[1:03:30] prophet
[1:03:31] is clearly rejected publicly
[1:03:34] because the rapture has come amen
[1:03:38] verse 19 the same death suddenly
[1:03:42] with our kindred an evil entreated our
[1:03:45] father
[1:03:46] so that they cast out their young
[1:03:48] children to the end
[1:03:50] that they might not live there is a
[1:03:53] rising
[1:03:54] of a power pharaoh ramses was not there
[1:03:58] but pharaoh says enter into the throne
[1:04:02] his entrance into the throne is god
[1:04:06] controlling everything god knows he
[1:04:09] needed a ramses there
[1:04:11] because ram says is needful for the
[1:04:13] exodus
[1:04:14] you can't have the exodus without ramses
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:18] the reason why god is permitting ramses
[1:04:21] to arise in power
[1:04:23] is because there was a promise given to
[1:04:25] abraham
[1:04:26] but that promise is connected to ramses
[1:04:30] amen and ramses must be there for the
[1:04:33] promise to be fulfilled
[1:04:35] that's why god said that i raised
[1:04:37] pharaoh
[1:04:39] i already predestinated pharaoh i knew
[1:04:42] what pharaoh is gonna do
[1:04:44] i am the one that is allowing this
[1:04:46] pharaoh to rise
[1:04:48] because through this pharaoh i'm gonna
[1:04:50] show my power
[1:04:52] are we clear i'm just bringing pharaoh
[1:04:55] on the scene don't be discouraged
[1:04:57] but the reason why i'm putting pharaoh
[1:05:00] because i'm gonna demonstrate my power
[1:05:03] but to demonstrate my power i need a
[1:05:06] pharaoh that's going to reject the
[1:05:08] message of the hour amen
[1:05:10] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:05:13] you again for your grace for your love
[1:05:15] your mercy
[1:05:16] and for everything you're doing for us
[1:05:18] father thank you for your presence this
[1:05:20] morning
[1:05:21] thank you for everything you're doing
[1:05:23] for us and thank you for the message of
[1:05:25] the hour
[1:05:26] and father to help us stand for this
[1:05:28] message
[1:05:29] in spite of everything that has happened
[1:05:32] lord we are committing this service unto
[1:05:34] the hand
[1:05:35] be the alpha and the omega speak to your
[1:05:38] children move me completely out of the
[1:05:39] way lord
[1:05:40] father may heaven be opened up and may
[1:05:42] hell be shut up
[1:05:44] father we commit everything unto the
[1:05:46] hand in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:49] amen god bless you good to see everybody
[1:05:52] this morning
[1:05:53] we had a wonderful thanksgiving message
[1:05:56] on wednesday on tuesday if you miss it
[1:06:00] you better go back on youtube
[1:06:02] and look into it we are on part six
[1:06:06] of the king of king ahazary's three
[1:06:08] fists and esther
[1:06:09] to banquet amen
[1:06:13] let's go to esther chapter 3 now
[1:06:16] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:06:20] esther chapter 3 verse 1
[1:06:24] after these things did king a hazaris
[1:06:28] promote heaven we know who herman is
[1:06:32] heaven was not in this position before
[1:06:36] anybody clear we already went and we saw
[1:06:39] the background between this war
[1:06:41] the war between mordecai and haman it is
[1:06:44] not a war of men
[1:06:46] it is not a battle of flesh it is a war
[1:06:49] of
[1:06:49] god and amalek because there was a
[1:06:52] promise
[1:06:52] made way before that god
[1:06:56] will fight with amalek amen
[1:06:59] we went through esther chapter one
[1:07:01] esther chapter two
[1:07:03] everything went fine esther has been
[1:07:05] chosen to be queen
[1:07:06] and she has replaced queen faster
[1:07:09] everything was calm in the kingdom
[1:07:11] suddenly stirred
[1:07:14] the king suddenly something happened to
[1:07:18] the king
[1:07:19] the king picked heaven he never picked
[1:07:22] any of the other princes
[1:07:25] he picked emman and when we look at him
[1:07:28] and we found out that
[1:07:29] heaven was from the seed of amalek
[1:07:33] amen and he picked emman and
[1:07:36] rose emman elevate emman
[1:07:39] into a higher position than
[1:07:42] any other priestess in the kingdom
[1:07:46] amen why verse one
[1:07:49] after these things did king hazards
[1:07:52] promote heaven
[1:07:53] the son of hamadeta the agar guide an
[1:07:55] amalekite
[1:07:57] and advanced him and set his seat above
[1:08:00] all the princes that were with him and
[1:08:03] all the king's servants
[1:08:05] that were in the king's gate bow and
[1:08:07] reverence heaven we saw that
[1:08:09] for the king had so commanded concerning
[1:08:11] him
[1:08:12] but mordecai by not nor
[1:08:15] did him reference then the king's
[1:08:18] servant which were in the king's gate
[1:08:19] said to mordecai
[1:08:21] why transgressors you the king's
[1:08:23] commandment
[1:08:25] now he came to pass when they spoke
[1:08:27] daily to him
[1:08:29] and he hearkened not to them that they
[1:08:31] told him and to see whether mordecai's
[1:08:33] mother
[1:08:34] would stand for he told them that he was
[1:08:37] a jew
[1:08:38] we know a jew in the new testament speak
[1:08:40] of a
[1:08:41] christian that is baptized with the holy
[1:08:44] spirit
[1:08:45] so the problem between him and and the
[1:08:47] problem between mordecai
[1:08:49] is not a man problem it is a problem of
[1:08:52] faith
[1:08:53] it is a problem of religion one is a
[1:08:56] seed of
[1:08:56] amalek and the other one is the seed of
[1:08:59] israel
[1:09:00] which is god's people amen now
[1:09:03] as a reminder we know in exodus chapter
[1:09:06] 17
[1:09:07] the bible says that and the lord said to
[1:09:09] moses
[1:09:10] write this for a memorial the battle
[1:09:13] with amalek
[1:09:14] in a book and he use it to the ears of
[1:09:17] joshua who's going to take over
[1:09:19] after moses for i will orderly pull out
[1:09:22] the remembrance of
[1:09:24] amalek from under heaven so we found out
[1:09:27] that when the opportunity was given to
[1:09:30] seoul
[1:09:31] to destroy or to fulfill this prophecy
[1:09:34] so
[1:09:34] never fulfill that prophecy amalek is
[1:09:37] kept
[1:09:38] and amalek continued to go by the beauty
[1:09:41] of it
[1:09:42] god spoke again on the following verse
[1:09:45] he says that because the lord has sown
[1:09:48] there is enough
[1:09:50] that the lord not israel the lord
[1:09:53] will have wall with amalek
[1:09:57] from generation to generation
[1:10:00] so god knew that amalek will continue to
[1:10:04] escape
[1:10:05] that's why god said there will be a war
[1:10:08] from generation
[1:10:09] to generation so there will be a first
[1:10:11] generation
[1:10:12] that will kill a certain number of
[1:10:14] americans
[1:10:15] but amalek will escape there will be a
[1:10:18] second
[1:10:19] generation that will come that will kill
[1:10:21] a certain number
[1:10:22] amalek will still escape but no matter
[1:10:25] how much amalek will escape
[1:10:27] one of this day amalek will be
[1:10:30] completely wiped out
[1:10:32] from the earth because god already spoke
[1:10:35] that i will wipe i will remove the
[1:10:37] remembrance of amalek
[1:10:39] from under heaven when we talk about war
[1:10:43] in this church
[1:10:44] we already seen that war spoke of a
[1:10:46] trumpet
[1:10:48] amen so when god says that there will be
[1:10:51] war
[1:10:52] from generation to generation god is
[1:10:55] speaking that they will be trumpet
[1:10:57] blowing from generation to generation
[1:11:00] and every trumpet that will blow will be
[1:11:03] a war to destroy amalek amen
[1:11:07] until amalek is completely destroyed
[1:11:11] let's go to john chapter 8 verse 44
[1:11:16] hallelujah if you dare you can say amen
[1:11:22] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:27] john chapter 8 verse 44
[1:11:31] jesus speaking to the pharisee he says
[1:11:34] you are of
[1:11:35] your father the devil
[1:11:39] and the last of your father you will do
[1:11:41] what is that last
[1:11:42] what is that desire he was a
[1:11:46] murderer a man from the beginning
[1:11:50] did satan kill somebody at the beginning
[1:11:54] no who killed someone came
[1:11:57] so it's clear the serpent seed right
[1:12:00] here
[1:12:02] right here because satan never key label
[1:12:06] he was carrying that key label
[1:12:09] right here a murderer that's why ken was
[1:12:13] off there
[1:12:14] wicked because he was displaying the
[1:12:17] attribute of satan
[1:12:20] amen he was a murderer from the
[1:12:23] beginning
[1:12:25] and the blood not in the truth
[1:12:29] a child of the devil cannot remain
[1:12:33] on the truth
[1:12:40] amen he will try like the pharisee
[1:12:45] but he cannot remain there
[1:12:50] because there is no truth in him
[1:12:54] when he speaks a lie
[1:12:57] he speaks of his own that lie is within
[1:13:01] him
[1:13:01] there is no truth in him either you have
[1:13:03] twofold you have lie
[1:13:05] amen for he is a liar
[1:13:09] and the father of it so when he gives
[1:13:13] birth he give birth to lies
[1:13:16] amen and he's going to be a murderer
[1:13:20] and we will find out that haman had a
[1:13:23] murdering spirit upon him
[1:13:26] as all the children of god which is an
[1:13:30] attribute of satan
[1:13:35] hallelujah let's go to first john
[1:13:37] chapter 3
[1:13:41] amen first john chapter 3
[1:13:46] verse 8
[1:13:51] hallelujah he
[1:13:55] that commits sin is of the
[1:13:58] devil for the devil's sin
[1:14:02] from the beginning amalekite has sinners
[1:14:07] you remember last sunday for the devil's
[1:14:10] sin from the beginning
[1:14:12] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:14:15] manifested or revealed
[1:14:18] that he might do what destroyed the work
[1:14:21] of the devil so when hell open up heaven
[1:14:25] also open up
[1:14:27] amen when the devil unfolds
[1:14:30] himself god unfolds also himself
[1:14:34] but the purpose of the revelation of god
[1:14:38] the manifestation of god the unfolding
[1:14:41] of god
[1:14:42] the purpose is to destroy the work of
[1:14:45] the devil
[1:14:49] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:14:52] we are still claiming let's go to psalm
[1:14:55] chapter
[1:14:56] 18 amen
[1:15:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:07] if the devil is fighting and he is using
[1:15:11] cain
[1:15:12] to destroy the seed of god
[1:15:15] what is god doing also to his children
[1:15:18] because the one who killed evil was king
[1:15:21] amen the anointing came upon ken
[1:15:25] and can kill abel
[1:15:29] but let's see also what god does
[1:15:32] amen because when jesus died judah also
[1:15:36] died
[1:15:37] when jesus sent his spirit on the day of
[1:15:39] pentecost judah sent his spirit back
[1:15:42] one was a child of god one was a child
[1:15:45] of hell or perdition
[1:15:47] psalm chapter 18 verse 32 if you dare
[1:15:50] you can say amen
[1:15:53] it is god that girls me with strength
[1:15:57] that's david so the strength of devi
[1:16:00] doesn't come by human strength
[1:16:03] everybody clear makes my way
[1:16:06] perfect he makes my feet
[1:16:10] like han's feet so if you look at david
[1:16:14] running
[1:16:15] it seems like david is gifted to run
[1:16:18] but it is not death that is running
[1:16:22] it is god in the flesh of david rhyming
[1:16:26] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:16:29] lord
[1:16:30] and set me upon my high place
[1:16:33] verse 34 he teaches my hand to wall
[1:16:38] you see now so when death is warring it
[1:16:41] is not dead
[1:16:43] it is god warring with you in the flesh
[1:16:47] of
[1:16:47] david are we clear
[1:16:51] so that a bow of steel is broken by man
[1:16:56] how can a man broke a bow of steel
[1:17:00] it takes another power it takes a
[1:17:03] supernatural power
[1:17:04] for samsung to break into the host of
[1:17:07] the philistine
[1:17:08] so it is not your battle that's why the
[1:17:11] scriptures say
[1:17:12] when they're gonna bring you in front of
[1:17:14] the governor
[1:17:16] take no thought of what you're gonna do
[1:17:18] just
[1:17:19] relax and let god dwell in you
[1:17:22] the god that dwell in you do the
[1:17:24] fighting
[1:17:26] you want to give somebody an answer and
[1:17:28] you wonder where did i get the answer
[1:17:30] from
[1:17:30] it is not you giving the answer it is
[1:17:33] god
[1:17:34] answering himself
[1:17:39] take psalm 144.
[1:17:43] there is a battle yes but that battle is
[1:17:46] not yours
[1:17:48] there is a battle coming up yes you
[1:17:50] don't have to fight it
[1:17:52] amen somebody is going to fight that
[1:17:55] battle through you amen
[1:17:59] you're going to do things that you won't
[1:18:00] even imagine you can do
[1:18:03] because it's not you doing it amen
[1:18:07] psalm 144 verse 1 a song of david
[1:18:10] blessed be the lord
[1:18:12] my strength that's the strength of david
[1:18:16] which teaches my to do what
[1:18:20] and my finger to do what so the hand and
[1:18:23] the finger of
[1:18:24] david are maneuvering by the power of
[1:18:27] the holy ghost
[1:18:29] no wonder david could kill like he was
[1:18:31] killing
[1:18:32] he was not dead killing he was god
[1:18:35] through david
[1:18:36] that was destroying the enemy because
[1:18:38] the son of man
[1:18:40] when he is revealed is revealed to
[1:18:42] destroy the work of the
[1:18:44] devil everybody clear
[1:18:49] but the problem is if god have a war
[1:18:52] with amalek
[1:18:53] when is that war end
[1:18:56] now everything that had the beginning
[1:18:58] has an end
[1:19:00] so there is no prophecy that can
[1:19:02] continue from generation to generation
[1:19:05] the purpose was i'm going to war with
[1:19:07] amalek
[1:19:08] from generation to generation but at a
[1:19:11] certain time
[1:19:12] i must come to an end and finish that
[1:19:14] war
[1:19:15] amen everything that has a beginning has
[1:19:18] an end
[1:19:19] there is nothing that ever began but
[1:19:21] what has an end
[1:19:23] but something that had no beginning has
[1:19:25] no end
[1:19:26] god alone is the only one that had never
[1:19:30] beginning
[1:19:31] he had no beginning of days no ending of
[1:19:34] years and therefore we have to become a
[1:19:36] part of god
[1:19:38] by birth to live have an eternal
[1:19:41] existence sin and suffering
[1:19:45] and everything must come to a place
[1:19:47] where he has no existence
[1:19:49] because he had a beginning
[1:19:52] there was a time when there was no
[1:19:54] sickness we're going back there
[1:19:57] no sin no sorrow no death
[1:20:00] and then he come by a provision so
[1:20:04] all provision must end back
[1:20:07] and all that was had a beginning has to
[1:20:11] end
[1:20:11] so that the eternal can ever exist
[1:20:15] do you see what i mean so every battle
[1:20:18] that is coming every trial that you have
[1:20:21] in in your life
[1:20:22] if it starts it's gonna have a dead end
[1:20:26] amen there is a time you have a
[1:20:28] pregnancy there is a time
[1:20:30] no matter what's going to happen you
[1:20:32] must go to the delivery home
[1:20:34] if the baby don't want to come out we're
[1:20:36] going to go with c-section
[1:20:38] and we're going to pull that baby out
[1:20:40] because the pregnancy must go to an end
[1:20:44] amen praise the name of the lord when we
[1:20:47] look at the first battle
[1:20:50] between israel and amalek before the
[1:20:54] battle
[1:20:54] started we found out that moses went
[1:20:57] into the mountain and
[1:21:00] the condition of the hill or the
[1:21:03] mountain
[1:21:04] was determining the war with amalek
[1:21:07] if the hand of moses are up israel is
[1:21:10] winning
[1:21:11] if the hands are down amalek is whooping
[1:21:14] amen so he got to a point when the hand
[1:21:17] of moses were already tired
[1:21:19] so moses needed two nails
[1:21:22] amen to keep his hand up so the two
[1:21:26] nails that god used at that time
[1:21:30] and aaron so let's get into that a
[1:21:33] little bit as we're moving
[1:21:36] a moses brother branham say a
[1:21:39] perfect type of christ
[1:21:42] was moses is that right
[1:21:46] all those patriarchs were jesus christ
[1:21:49] living pre-life in other words they were
[1:21:51] projecting the life of jesus
[1:21:54] moses born under persecution just
[1:21:57] as there was killing all the babies in
[1:21:59] the time of moses
[1:22:01] jesus when he came there was killing all
[1:22:03] the babies to get him
[1:22:05] is that right the devil tried to catch
[1:22:08] moses
[1:22:08] the devil trying to catch jesus
[1:22:12] let's call another man by the name of
[1:22:14] moses
[1:22:15] a very outstanding character of the
[1:22:17] bible the greatest
[1:22:19] of all the prophet he was a type of the
[1:22:22] lord
[1:22:23] jesus christ the priest and the king
[1:22:27] and the lord giver a very perfect fable
[1:22:30] never a man talked to god outside of
[1:22:33] christ himself like who
[1:22:35] moses amen we preach to you a prophet
[1:22:38] like unto
[1:22:39] moses that's why moses said the lord
[1:22:42] your god will send a prophet in my
[1:22:44] caliber
[1:22:45] a prophet like unto me so when moses was
[1:22:49] on that hill
[1:22:50] there was a battle that was going down
[1:22:52] there but the hand of moses must be up
[1:22:56] and must be fastened to two nails
[1:22:59] and the nerves god used in the old
[1:23:02] testament
[1:23:03] was the nerve called aaron and the nail
[1:23:06] car
[1:23:09] what is going on with those now take
[1:23:11] exodus chapter 24
[1:23:14] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:23:18] in the new testament we saw a man up on
[1:23:21] the hill
[1:23:22] but god hook nails them but in the old
[1:23:25] testament
[1:23:26] instead of using nails god used two
[1:23:29] people
[1:23:31] amen exodus 24 verse 14.
[1:23:35] if you're there you can say amen
[1:23:39] moses going to the table uh to the uh to
[1:23:41] the mountain
[1:23:44] and he said to the elder terry you here
[1:23:48] for us until we come again to you
[1:23:52] and behold who aaron
[1:23:56] and er are with you if any man have any
[1:24:00] matter to do
[1:24:01] let him come to them so aaron
[1:24:05] and er were not picked by chance
[1:24:09] are you there aaron and earl were the
[1:24:13] people that
[1:24:14] when moses went to the mountain he left
[1:24:17] the congregation into the hand of aaron
[1:24:20] and earl
[1:24:22] and when amalek come and attack his hair
[1:24:25] we saw again aaron and her growing up
[1:24:28] and holding the hand of moses
[1:24:31] but if you remember aaron came from the
[1:24:34] tribe of
[1:24:35] liver everybody clear aaron was
[1:24:38] delivered
[1:24:39] but let's go to exodus 31 let's see
[1:24:42] where air is from
[1:24:45] amen exodus 31 verse 2
[1:24:49] are you there
[1:24:52] and the lord verse 1 spoke to moses
[1:24:54] saying
[1:24:55] see i have called by name
[1:24:59] bezalel the son of yura
[1:25:02] the son of who of the tribe of what
[1:25:08] everybody clear so we found out that on
[1:25:11] the mountain
[1:25:12] the two hand of moses were held by two
[1:25:16] tribes
[1:25:18] there was the tribe of the levant and
[1:25:21] they also have the tribe of the
[1:25:23] jew of judah now let's see first the
[1:25:26] responsibility of delivered
[1:25:29] let's go to exodus 32.
[1:25:33] when we move here then i'm going to drop
[1:25:35] to esther amen
[1:25:37] exodus 32 verse 1 and when the people
[1:25:40] saw
[1:25:41] that moses delayed to come down
[1:25:44] out of the mount the people gathered
[1:25:47] themselves together to whom
[1:25:49] they never went to earth
[1:25:52] they went to the levitical priesthood
[1:25:56] amen to put pressure on that priesthood
[1:26:02] they gathered together to aaron and say
[1:26:04] to him
[1:26:05] up make us god which shall go before us
[1:26:09] for us for this moses the man that
[1:26:12] brought us out of the land of
[1:26:14] egypt we know not what is become to him
[1:26:18] everybody clear let's jump to verse 21.
[1:26:22] amen and moses said to aaron
[1:26:25] what did this people do to you in other
[1:26:29] words aaron made the golden calf
[1:26:31] and moses come down from the mountain
[1:26:33] upset completely
[1:26:35] and moses looked at aaron he said i gave
[1:26:38] you the responsibility of this trouble
[1:26:42] moses never questioned her
[1:26:46] he only questioned aaron because through
[1:26:49] the old testament
[1:26:51] israel was under the levitical
[1:26:54] priesthood
[1:26:55] so the levitical priesthood was
[1:26:58] responsible for israel
[1:27:00] and moses went straight to the levitical
[1:27:02] priesthood
[1:27:03] and say we give you charge of the people
[1:27:06] of god
[1:27:07] what happened are you following me
[1:27:11] levitical priesthood answer that's why
[1:27:14] another priesthood must come amen
[1:27:19] moses said to aaron what did these
[1:27:21] people
[1:27:22] do to you that you have brought so
[1:27:25] great sin upon who brought so great sin
[1:27:29] aaron amen
[1:27:32] verse 22 and aaron said let not the
[1:27:36] anger of my lord works hard
[1:27:38] you know the people that they are set on
[1:27:41] mischief
[1:27:43] he's blaming the congregation amen
[1:27:46] for they say to me make us god we shall
[1:27:50] go before us
[1:27:51] for us for this moses the men that
[1:27:53] brought us out of the land of egypt
[1:27:55] we know not what has become of him and i
[1:27:58] said to them
[1:28:00] whatsoever has any gold let them break
[1:28:03] it off
[1:28:04] so they gave it to me then i
[1:28:08] cast it aaron casting
[1:28:11] i cast it into the fire and there
[1:28:14] came out this calf in other words they
[1:28:18] just bring it to me
[1:28:19] i put it in a fire and suddenly the calf
[1:28:22] came
[1:28:22] out no it was aaron that was making
[1:28:28] the calf amen
[1:28:31] it was aaron that taught them to bring
[1:28:33] him gold
[1:28:34] instead of aaron refusing aaron condon
[1:28:38] with the people and brought sin showing
[1:28:41] that the levitical
[1:28:43] priesthood could not hold sin or resolve
[1:28:47] sin in the camp of the lord anybody
[1:28:50] clear
[1:28:51] let's go to hebrews 7.
[1:28:57] the congregation was given into the hand
[1:29:00] of
[1:29:00] aaron and er and the levitical
[1:29:03] priesthood was disqualified
[1:29:06] amen and moses took the first table
[1:29:10] and broke them down and brother branham
[1:29:12] said it was showing
[1:29:14] that the levitical priesthood will be
[1:29:16] destroyed because it is
[1:29:17] unable to contain and to keep the people
[1:29:21] in line
[1:29:22] that's why the law was unable to bring
[1:29:25] people
[1:29:26] into perfection but they never
[1:29:29] questioned the tribe of judah
[1:29:33] exodus chapter 7 verse 11
[1:29:36] if therefore are you reading with me
[1:29:40] perfection whereby the levitical
[1:29:44] priesthood erando
[1:29:46] for under it the people receive the law
[1:29:50] what further need was there that another
[1:29:53] priest
[1:29:54] should arise after the order of
[1:29:57] who melchizedek and not to be called
[1:30:01] after the order of who
[1:30:04] eren failed god gave a promise
[1:30:07] that i'm gonna bring another priesthood
[1:30:10] under the order of mayor
[1:30:12] kizzadek and paul is explaining that if
[1:30:15] perfection
[1:30:17] was under aaron why did god give another
[1:30:20] promise
[1:30:21] to bring another priesthood
[1:30:25] are we clear verse 12
[1:30:28] for the priesthood being what
[1:30:32] there is a changing of the priesthood
[1:30:35] from the tribe of liver to witch trouble
[1:30:41] we okay now it's dropping now right
[1:30:44] it's jumping now right praise the name
[1:30:47] of the lord
[1:30:48] everybody okay okay for the priesthood
[1:30:51] being changed
[1:30:52] there is made of necessity a change also
[1:30:56] of the law
[1:30:58] for he of whom these things are spoken
[1:31:02] pretend to another what
[1:31:05] of which no man gave attendance to what
[1:31:08] in other words nobody outside of liver
[1:31:12] could have a no uh a permission
[1:31:15] to enter into the altar but we found out
[1:31:18] that there is a promise
[1:31:20] of another priesthood as that priesthood
[1:31:23] coming up from aaron
[1:31:25] or it's going to come from another
[1:31:26] trouble but which tribe is bringing that
[1:31:29] person
[1:31:31] amen verse 14 for it is what
[1:31:35] that hour spun out of what
[1:31:40] everybody clear everybody clear
[1:31:44] sprung out of judah of which tribe
[1:31:47] moses spoke nothing concerning what
[1:31:51] in other words when aaron and earl
[1:31:54] went to hold the hand of moses
[1:31:58] he was speaking that one day there will
[1:32:01] come
[1:32:01] somebody down the road and it's going to
[1:32:04] be a transfer
[1:32:05] of priesthood from the priesthood of
[1:32:08] liver
[1:32:09] all the way to the priesthood of judah
[1:32:12] and that will happen
[1:32:13] upon the hill and upon that hill his
[1:32:16] hand will be lifted up
[1:32:18] and that person will be the priesthood
[1:32:21] under
[1:32:24] melchizedek
[1:32:28] are we there because aaron handled the
[1:32:30] bread
[1:32:32] but if you go to genesis 49 you'll find
[1:32:34] that judah
[1:32:35] handled the wine you want to see it
[1:32:40] let's go to genesis 49 you know that the
[1:32:43] shoe bread was handled by aaron
[1:32:46] let's see 49
[1:32:50] because when joseph was in prison
[1:32:53] he has the butler and the baker
[1:32:56] are you there the becker was handling
[1:32:59] bread
[1:33:00] and rebecca have to be killed
[1:33:03] everybody there the levitical priesthood
[1:33:06] have to be killed
[1:33:08] amen are you there and the battler who
[1:33:12] handle wine
[1:33:13] is the one that's going to take over
[1:33:16] because the
[1:33:16] feast of king a hazares is a feast of
[1:33:19] wine
[1:33:31] let's go to genesis 49 hallelujah
[1:33:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:38] genesis 49 verse 10 if you dare you can
[1:33:42] say amen
[1:33:43] the scepter we already talked about this
[1:33:46] shall not depart from who
[1:33:48] you see her you see why moses gave him
[1:33:51] the responsibility
[1:33:52] amen and no er what
[1:33:56] lord give a king from between his feet
[1:34:00] until shallow which is jesus come and to
[1:34:03] him shall the gathering of the people
[1:34:06] be watch verse 11 binding his fault to
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:12] that's that's judah and his ass called
[1:34:17] to the choice he washes his garment in
[1:34:21] what
[1:34:23] that's judah and his clothes in the
[1:34:25] blood of the
[1:34:27] wine everybody clear verse 12 his eyes
[1:34:31] shall be read with what
[1:34:35] and he's stiff with what so judah
[1:34:38] is a tribe that is completely embedded
[1:34:42] in wine
[1:34:43] so when joseph went to prisoner he found
[1:34:46] the battle and the baker
[1:34:49] they killed the baker showing that the
[1:34:51] levitical priesthood
[1:34:53] the hand of the shoe bread will come off
[1:34:56] but the melchizedek piece would that
[1:34:59] handle the wine
[1:35:01] will continue because the feast of
[1:35:03] pentecost
[1:35:04] takes the wine everybody there
[1:35:07] now after the battle
[1:35:11] after this earth of moses being
[1:35:14] on the mountain which is a type of jesus
[1:35:17] christ
[1:35:18] being on calvary and the problem was if
[1:35:21] the hand of moses are
[1:35:22] up amalek is destroyed if the hand of
[1:35:26] moses are down america is taking over
[1:35:29] but god made sure that the hand of jesus
[1:35:33] christ
[1:35:33] are fastened to the to the cross
[1:35:36] so that no matter what happened whether
[1:35:39] he ran
[1:35:40] whether it's not raining whether
[1:35:42] something is going good or bad
[1:35:44] the hand of jesus stayed there until he
[1:35:47] spoke
[1:35:48] he said feed his famous
[1:35:52] amen jesus was fastened to the wall
[1:35:56] until he make sure the last of malachite
[1:35:59] is
[1:35:59] finished
[1:36:03] amen so the battle with
[1:36:06] malik in the old testament
[1:36:09] is a battle that started with the cross
[1:36:13] for us everybody following me
[1:36:16] praise the name of the lord if you look
[1:36:19] to the scripture
[1:36:22] for the destruction of amalek it took
[1:36:25] seven battles
[1:36:29] i let that soak down very greg gathered
[1:36:32] already
[1:36:33] amen god said that i would destroy
[1:36:38] amalek from generation to generation
[1:36:42] how many generations we don't know how
[1:36:44] many better
[1:36:46] we don't know but today it took seven
[1:36:49] people to destroy amalek completely
[1:36:54] anybody clear the first one was joshua
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:36:59] joshua start with moses
[1:37:03] amen and the first battle of moses
[1:37:06] of joshua have to be put in the book
[1:37:09] as a memorial for generations
[1:37:13] to refer back to the battle of joshua
[1:37:17] everybody clear are you following me the
[1:37:20] second one that fought america was
[1:37:22] barack
[1:37:26] everybody clear amalek survived
[1:37:30] then gillian you need
[1:37:34] scripture you see me i'm alex
[1:37:38] then so i'm alex survived
[1:37:43] then david amalek survived then
[1:37:48] hezekiah used the simulink
[1:37:52] amalek survive you want to know the last
[1:37:55] one
[1:37:56] the last one was esther and nordica
[1:38:05] amen god gives a promise
[1:38:09] i'm going to destroy amalek from all the
[1:38:13] faces of the earth
[1:38:14] he uses joshua he blew the trumpet
[1:38:18] fought with amalek barak picked it up
[1:38:21] gideon picked it up saul picked it up
[1:38:24] david picked it up
[1:38:25] hezekiah picked it up the last one was
[1:38:28] mordecai and esther
[1:38:33] are we there but the first battle of
[1:38:36] joshua
[1:38:37] have to be put in the book
[1:38:41] brother branham says i believe that all
[1:38:44] of the old things was a tap of the new
[1:38:47] to come
[1:38:49] what israel was in the nature we are
[1:38:52] in the god leading israel naturally
[1:38:57] was what he's doing for us
[1:39:00] spiritually today just like
[1:39:04] after covering he took seven
[1:39:07] battle all the way to western
[1:39:10] to destroy amalek after
[1:39:14] calvary after the death the resurrection
[1:39:17] of jesus christ
[1:39:19] he also took seven churches
[1:39:22] with seven messengers to destroy
[1:39:26] the work of satan are we following me
[1:39:31] and the first one that fought his
[1:39:33] brother was put under the book of the
[1:39:36] law
[1:39:36] and the first messenger was paul and
[1:39:39] paul's scripture was put in the bible
[1:39:45] are you there they never put the
[1:39:47] scripture of arenas
[1:39:49] they never put the scripture of columba
[1:39:51] they only put
[1:39:52] paul because he was the first after
[1:39:55] calvary
[1:39:56] they only put joshua because he was the
[1:39:59] first after the old testament cavalry
[1:40:02] to use paul as a reference
[1:40:06] that's why paul said if a messenger
[1:40:08] comes
[1:40:09] if an angel comes and does not preach
[1:40:12] like me
[1:40:13] call him a christ because
[1:40:16] paul is going to be a reference joshua
[1:40:19] is going to be a reference
[1:40:23] are we clear together did i lose anybody
[1:40:26] praise the name of the lord amen
[1:40:30] brother bonham said in order to refresh
[1:40:32] your mind
[1:40:33] i want to point out how we arrive at the
[1:40:36] funding of the name of the messenger
[1:40:39] to various ages god in his servant
[1:40:43] will has seen to it that the history
[1:40:46] of the new testament church was not lost
[1:40:49] that's why they have to keep joshua
[1:40:51] that's why they have to keep paul amen
[1:40:54] even as he saw it
[1:40:56] that the history of israel would not be
[1:40:58] lost by placing it in there
[1:41:02] and the core bearing corroborating
[1:41:05] it today from multitude of scroll
[1:41:08] earthen vessels and other artifacts that
[1:41:11] archaeologists
[1:41:12] have discovered and interpreted we
[1:41:15] actually have a running command
[1:41:17] commentary of bible history from the
[1:41:19] first page up to now
[1:41:21] thus by reading history we can find out
[1:41:25] what men are men in various ages
[1:41:29] where the closest to god's original
[1:41:32] pattern
[1:41:33] at the apostle that's why paul have to
[1:41:36] be put in the bible
[1:41:38] that's why joshua have to be put in the
[1:41:40] bible
[1:41:42] are we clear the one that god used to
[1:41:45] bring his people
[1:41:46] back to the world of truth will be the
[1:41:49] one
[1:41:50] to examine then out of those there will
[1:41:53] be one
[1:41:54] for every age who will stand out the
[1:41:57] clearest
[1:41:58] as the closest in world pardon
[1:42:01] and power that one will be there
[1:42:05] so a reference has to be put on amen
[1:42:09] for the people and what i'm saying in
[1:42:12] this message
[1:42:13] is this the sign of the end time he said
[1:42:15] the book written
[1:42:17] when this angel finishes all the losing
[1:42:20] mysteries
[1:42:21] that through the battle they fought
[1:42:24] luther fought are you there
[1:42:28] wesley they were battles of amalekites
[1:42:33] are we clear now luther fought
[1:42:36] westlake thought the pentecost fought
[1:42:39] but there is coming says the bible that
[1:42:43] in the days of his sounding mordecai
[1:42:47] all the mysteries must be what revealed
[1:42:51] god of adam continues here when he is
[1:42:53] sending forth now
[1:42:55] that is that save the lord we have that
[1:42:57] clear
[1:42:58] when he sends off his message declare
[1:43:01] war like paul did on the orthodox
[1:43:05] like the rest of them did like luther
[1:43:08] wesley against the organization when he
[1:43:12] declared war and tell them
[1:43:14] they are lying the father of line
[1:43:17] it is not the truth and they are
[1:43:19] deceiving men
[1:43:20] when his son fought for that you can
[1:43:23] fail
[1:43:24] it won't fail because it shall be
[1:43:26] vindicated by the word of god
[1:43:28] you shall know exactly what it is and
[1:43:31] when he does
[1:43:32] he sent forth to call from babylon
[1:43:35] come out of here my people that you may
[1:43:37] not partake
[1:43:38] of her sin so we found out that just
[1:43:41] like amalek had war with israel
[1:43:44] the church today have woven all the way
[1:43:48] through the messengers
[1:43:49] everybody clear but the last one will be
[1:43:52] a prophet and a bride
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:43:57] the people who took his revelation from
[1:44:00] god
[1:44:01] became the living epistle known rarely
[1:44:04] known
[1:44:05] of all men for their generation when the
[1:44:08] mentor is failed
[1:44:09] god raised up others and so he has gone
[1:44:12] on through the years
[1:44:13] until in this last day there is again
[1:44:17] another people in the land
[1:44:19] who under their messenger mordechai
[1:44:23] will be the final voice to the final
[1:44:27] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:44:30] of god
[1:44:31] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[1:44:34] turning on her
[1:44:36] he won't confront her through them
[1:44:39] mordecai and for the voice of god will
[1:44:43] be evil
[1:44:44] that's why the last to destroy amalek
[1:44:47] is esther plus mordecai
[1:44:50] not estee lauder esther plus monica
[1:44:54] the prophet and the brother everybody
[1:44:57] created so far
[1:45:00] our thanksgiving you may say
[1:45:03] what this all got to do with
[1:45:05] thanksgiving what abandonment was
[1:45:06] preaching the invisible union
[1:45:09] what you talking about brother branham
[1:45:11] here it is quoted tonight

[1:45:21] thankful
[1:45:22] for their newfound way of life
[1:45:25] being separated from the aerial english
[1:45:28] denominations
[1:45:29] and creed they could marry to the new
[1:45:32] anointed world
[1:45:34] for their age that is right the anointed
[1:45:38] word for their age for their day
[1:45:42] so can we be thankful also

[1:45:53] ourselves from the things of the world

[1:46:34] that he believe it this way
[1:46:35] anyhow he shall start an influence and

[1:55:58] to kill one person
[1:55:59] he want to destroy everybody amen
[1:56:03] because of their religion because of
[1:56:06] their faith
[1:56:07] their faith is against what haman want
[1:56:11] women want everybody to bow down but the
[1:56:14] jewish faith
[1:56:15] is combating that we don't bow down only
[1:56:18] to god alone
[1:56:20] he says okay i'm gonna wipe them all he
[1:56:22] got the plan
[1:56:23] he got the dead he's going to the king
[1:56:26] amen
[1:56:27] when he goes to the king he's going
[1:56:30] to accuse the jew
[1:56:35] brother branham in revelation 12 7 and 9
[1:56:39] when satan is cast out do you what
[1:56:43] it's written in the bible you want to
[1:56:46] put that down
[1:56:47] because i want you to read it we have
[1:56:50] not got time
[1:56:51] it's closed 20 or 15 till 10 see
[1:56:54] but in revelation 12 7 to 9 certain
[1:56:58] the spirit the devil which is up there
[1:57:01] now
[1:57:01] accuser of the it's written in your
[1:57:05] bible
[1:57:06] amen the church is taken up
[1:57:09] and satan is cast down when the church
[1:57:12] goes up
[1:57:13] satan comes down then satan incarnates
[1:57:16] himself in the antichrist
[1:57:17] and he's called the beast in other words
[1:57:21] as long as the bride is here
[1:57:24] satan still have access to accuse you to
[1:57:26] god
[1:57:28] he is called the accuser of the brethren
[1:57:31] when we grow up into the rupture
[1:57:34] then the devil comes down
[1:57:37] clear praise the name of the lord so he
[1:57:40] goes to the king
[1:57:42] and he begin to accuse the jews just
[1:57:45] like he was talking
[1:57:47] about job with god amen
[1:57:51] because nothing that heaven can do
[1:57:54] without the permission of the king
[1:57:57] there is nothing the devil can do in
[1:58:00] your life
[1:58:01] without god first giving permission
[1:58:05] are you there that's why he was looking
[1:58:08] at job he could not do anything
[1:58:10] until god granted permission
[1:58:14] because the devil said you put a hedge a
[1:58:17] one job
[1:58:17] you are protecting job that's the reason
[1:58:20] why i cannot do anything
[1:58:22] if you will allow me give me permission
[1:58:24] then i'll do it
[1:58:26] so he's going to the king he's going to
[1:58:28] god
[1:58:29] to ask permission let's see that
[1:58:32] verse 8. and heaven said to the king a
[1:58:35] hazardous
[1:58:37] there is a certain people he doesn't
[1:58:39] call their name
[1:58:41] there is a certain people scatter
[1:58:44] abroad everywhere all over the world and
[1:58:47] disperse among the people
[1:58:49] in all the prophecies of your kingdom
[1:58:52] and
[1:58:52] what so the problem with
[1:58:56] a man is the law of the jews
[1:59:00] is against him the word
[1:59:04] that was given to the jews because the
[1:59:07] law was the word of god
[1:59:09] and the law came with a mighty angel
[1:59:14] do you know that
[1:59:18] take deuteronomy 33 keep esta chapter
[1:59:21] three
[1:59:22] take detroit number 33
[1:59:28] i spoke about it but probably some of
[1:59:30] you forgot
[1:59:31] deuteronomy 33 if you're there you can
[1:59:34] say amen
[1:59:35] deuteronomy 33 verse 2 and he says
[1:59:38] the lord came from sana and was up from
[1:59:42] sir
[1:59:42] to them he shunned forth from mount
[1:59:44] perem
[1:59:46] and he came with what
[1:59:49] ten thousand of cents you go to the book
[1:59:52] of acts he will tell you angels
[1:59:54] from his right hand went uh
[1:59:59] so when the lord descended on sana
[2:00:03] in his right hand he heard the law
[2:00:06] in revelation 10 we found also the lord
[2:00:09] descending in his right hand he has a
[2:00:12] book open
[2:00:14] you see now he has a fairy law from them
[2:00:19] verse 3 and he he loves the people
[2:00:23] all the saints are in your hand and they
[2:00:26] sat at your feet
[2:00:27] everyone shall receive of your
[2:00:30] moses command as uh it's a prophet that
[2:00:34] gave them the law
[2:00:36] even the what of the congregation of who
[2:00:40] so the law was the inheritance
[2:00:43] that god gave to the children of israel
[2:00:47] amen and heaven had a problem
[2:00:50] with the law he had a problem
[2:00:54] with the inheritance that was given to
[2:00:57] the children of god
[2:00:58] amen amen
[2:01:02] there is a problem now and i'm going to
[2:01:04] explain you something
[2:01:06] let's go to romans 7.
[2:01:09] amen the law
[2:01:12] have a mystery and we're going to see
[2:01:15] that right now
[2:01:18] amen romans 7
[2:01:22] verse 7.
[2:01:26] we're gonna see what is the law amen
[2:01:29] never understood
[2:01:30] that the law was meant to kill him
[2:01:34] are you there the law was the one that
[2:01:37] gave the commandment
[2:01:38] not to bow down before someone amen
[2:01:43] but the law has a deeper mystery than
[2:01:46] that
[2:01:48] the law was the catch
[2:01:51] that god used to expose satan
[2:01:55] if there is no law satan is quiet
[2:02:00] you will not detect satan
[2:02:04] the first way to detect satan you need
[2:02:07] to put a law
[2:02:10] are you following me are you following
[2:02:13] me
[2:02:15] if i if you buy a cake
[2:02:19] you okay and you put it at home on your
[2:02:22] table
[2:02:24] and the children ask you who belongs
[2:02:27] who that cake belongs to you say it's
[2:02:29] for everybody
[2:02:30] everybody will go pick up the cake eat
[2:02:33] there's no problem amen every child is a
[2:02:37] good child
[2:02:38] every child is obedient every child is
[2:02:41] perfect
[2:02:43] amen but says that that
[2:02:46] cake is only for mommy
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:50] let nobody else touch
[2:02:55] amen you will know which child
[2:02:58] obey you and which child does not obey
[2:03:03] you will know who can creep in the night
[2:03:06] trying to catch that cake
[2:03:08] the reason why you expose that because
[2:03:10] you put the law
[2:03:13] let's go to roman amen
[2:03:17] romans 7 verse 7 what shall we
[2:03:21] say then is the lost sin
[2:03:24] god forbid nay i have not known what
[2:03:29] but by the way
[2:03:32] when the child goes and creep
[2:03:36] and pick it up you get upset i told you
[2:03:40] don't touch it that is stealing
[2:03:43] you expose satan by the demon of
[2:03:47] stealing that demon was there
[2:03:51] amen you didn't know it until you put
[2:03:54] the law
[2:03:55] the law exposes the devil
[2:03:58] let's go back that's why paul is saying
[2:04:00] i did not sin
[2:04:02] until the law we were leaving without
[2:04:04] any problem
[2:04:05] until they say don't cross the red light
[2:04:08] when you cross the red light it's sin
[2:04:10] it was not seen before because the law
[2:04:13] was not there
[2:04:14] amen praise the name of the lord now
[2:04:17] i had not known sin but by though
[2:04:21] for i had not known lust except the law
[2:04:25] has said you shall not
[2:04:27] you see now now you begin to give him a
[2:04:30] list
[2:04:32] when somebody say hey you must say hey
[2:04:34] you begin to give him the list of the
[2:04:37] sin don't ever spit on someone
[2:04:40] it's a list of sin so the child is
[2:04:43] growing up
[2:04:44] knowing what is wrong amen
[2:04:47] are you there eight but sin taking
[2:04:51] occasion by the commandment
[2:04:53] wrote in me all can do all kind of what
[2:04:57] in other words when you put the cake i
[2:04:59] was not tempted
[2:05:01] when you said the cake is for everybody
[2:05:04] i didn't feel any problem to go get the
[2:05:06] cake
[2:05:07] that's why i just ate one time it was
[2:05:09] not a problem
[2:05:10] but when you put the law the scene
[2:05:13] in me begin to say are you gonna leave
[2:05:16] that cake alone like that
[2:05:17] wait till mommy goes to sleep it is sin
[2:05:20] that is talking
[2:05:22] amen to make to activate sin
[2:05:25] you need to put the law to expose heaven
[2:05:29] you need to bring the law are we okay
[2:05:33] let's continue for without the law
[2:05:37] sin is what everybody clear verse eight
[2:05:41] without the law sin is what
[2:05:44] for there was a love without the law
[2:05:48] was but when the commandment came
[2:05:51] sin what revive and now
[2:05:55] everybody clear and the commandment
[2:05:58] which or was ordained to life
[2:06:01] are found to be true for sin
[2:06:04] taking occasion by the commandment
[2:06:06] deceive me
[2:06:07] and by it slow me wherefore the law
[2:06:10] is and the commandment
[2:06:14] and justin was them
[2:06:17] that which is good made death to me
[2:06:21] it seems like because i believe the
[2:06:23] message now i got all this trouble
[2:06:28] because i'm a jew i am suffering now
[2:06:32] because i am a jew we are targeted by
[2:06:34] him and now
[2:06:37] i thought the jewish religion was to do
[2:06:39] me good
[2:06:40] it seems like the religion of the jew is
[2:06:43] causing me trouble
[2:06:45] it is not causing you trouble it is god
[2:06:48] who's exposing people
[2:06:51] amen praise the name of the lord
[2:06:55] god forbid but sin that he might appear
[2:06:59] what
[2:07:00] in other words that sin can truly come
[2:07:03] out
[2:07:04] and then god can slay sin away
[2:07:07] a man was living under this kingdom
[2:07:11] nobody knew him nobody was interested
[2:07:14] about
[2:07:15] him being an amalekite amen
[2:07:18] there was a seed that was laying there
[2:07:21] that is a murdering spirit
[2:07:23] but to expose heaven amen
[2:07:27] a law must challenge him
[2:07:30] you following me everything is
[2:07:32] controlled by god
[2:07:34] amen god the king was the one that put
[2:07:38] the law
[2:07:40] you follow me that everybody must bow
[2:07:43] down to him
[2:07:44] amen but there was another law
[2:07:48] that was contradicting that law
[2:07:51] and the reason why buffalo happen is to
[2:07:54] expose the true nature of heaven
[2:07:56] so that a man can come out and god can
[2:08:00] fulfill his commandment
[2:08:01] to destroy amalek are you following me
[2:08:04] now
[2:08:06] you see how god works our thoughts are
[2:08:08] not the thought of god
[2:08:10] what you think is in your life is
[2:08:12] trouble it's causing you trouble
[2:08:14] god is working out everything for his
[2:08:18] perfect
[2:08:19] will that's why the scriptures say all
[2:08:22] things work together for
[2:08:24] good amen verse 13
[2:08:27] but sin that he may appear sin
[2:08:31] working what death in me but that which
[2:08:34] is good
[2:08:35] that sin by the commandment
[2:08:38] might become exceedingly what so we can
[2:08:41] have a
[2:08:42] right reason to kill him
[2:08:45] amen you understand now as long as
[2:08:48] heaven is still quiet you're not going
[2:08:51] to touch him he didn't do anything wrong
[2:08:53] you must give him a higher position and
[2:08:56] you must put a law
[2:08:58] and somebody must challenge him and he's
[2:09:01] going to bring the true nature of a man
[2:09:04] out so that a man might be condemned
[2:09:07] and killed everybody clear
[2:09:12] for we know that the law is spiritual
[2:09:15] but i am carnal so the underworld
[2:09:18] praise the name of the lord so now we
[2:09:20] understand the mystery of the law
[2:09:23] and then the law was an inheritance what
[2:09:26] is our inheritance
[2:09:28] we have a sacred trust you know what a
[2:09:31] trust is
[2:09:32] and we have an inheritance a heritage
[2:09:34] that we
[2:09:35] where that we inherit as believing
[2:09:38] children
[2:09:39] it is a sacred trust and that circuits
[2:09:42] trust
[2:09:42] and our sacred heritage is what that has
[2:09:46] been given to us
[2:09:47] the what which is the message of the
[2:09:51] hour
[2:09:52] that's your inheritance just like the
[2:09:55] law came with a mighty angel our message
[2:09:58] also came with a mighty angel
[2:10:01] that have the book that has been opened
[2:10:03] and that book has been given to us as
[2:10:05] our
[2:10:06] inheritance but somebody has a trouble
[2:10:09] with your message
[2:10:12] somebody don't like your message because
[2:10:15] your message
[2:10:16] is exposing him because your message
[2:10:19] doesn't allow him to dominate the entire
[2:10:23] world
[2:10:24] so he has a people that follow the
[2:10:27] message of william brian branham
[2:10:30] he has a problem with them
[2:10:33] amen god is a good husband man
[2:10:38] he pruned the tree that was all cut off
[2:10:41] the dead
[2:10:42] limbs what he's going to do burn them up
[2:10:45] there exactly
[2:10:46] god is the husbandman of the tree he
[2:10:49] takes care of it
[2:10:50] he watches over his what is his heritage
[2:10:54] his on he watches over his word
[2:10:58] to confirm it to watch it see where he
[2:11:01] gets
[2:11:02] he's going to do what so just like the
[2:11:06] jews has given the law
[2:11:08] god also gave us the word of god but
[2:11:11] there is somebody that is there
[2:11:13] and the problem is the kingdom the law
[2:11:16] of these people
[2:11:17] these people have a certain way of
[2:11:20] living
[2:11:21] that is troubling him
[2:11:30] in jeffersonville thousands of what
[2:11:35] not spoken voices the thunder of
[2:11:38] god thundering out in sweetness
[2:11:42] and holiness purity and defy lives
[2:11:46] walking around in the earth today
[2:11:48] without what
[2:11:50] these are people yes sir real
[2:11:53] christian that is the thunder
[2:11:56] against the enemy when you are living a
[2:12:00] true
[2:12:01] christian life you are automatically
[2:12:04] troubling heaven
[2:12:08] are we there the devil don't care how
[2:12:11] loud you can holler
[2:12:13] the devil don't care how much you can
[2:12:15] jump or how much you can do this or
[2:12:18] shout
[2:12:19] but what hurts the devil is to see that
[2:12:22] sanctified
[2:12:24] holy life consecrated to god
[2:12:28] say anything to him call him anything
[2:12:31] just as sweet as he can be
[2:12:33] and move right on oh my dad throw him
[2:12:36] away
[2:12:37] that's the thunder that shake the devil
[2:12:41] it is what a word of god that is leave
[2:12:44] by a christian like mordecai
[2:12:46] it will always trouble heaven are we
[2:12:49] there
[2:12:50] now let's go back to esther chapter 3
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:57] verse 8 and heaven said to king of
[2:12:59] hazaris
[2:13:00] i'm watching my time there is a certain
[2:13:03] people scattered abroad
[2:13:04] and dispersed among the people in all
[2:13:07] the provinces of your kingdom
[2:13:09] and uh lord we understand the mystery of
[2:13:12] the law now
[2:13:13] amen our diverse from all the people
[2:13:18] neither keep the the kings
[2:13:21] law now emen is
[2:13:25] accusing the jews that they don't follow
[2:13:28] the commandment of god if you notice in
[2:13:32] the book of daniel
[2:13:33] first of all the first kingdom was
[2:13:35] babylon
[2:13:37] everybody remember then babylon was
[2:13:40] taken over by the middle pigeon
[2:13:43] everybody there and when a kingdom was
[2:13:46] taken by the middles
[2:13:48] that's when daniel appeared on the scene
[2:13:52] amen so daniel appeared before esther
[2:13:59] everybody clear now now if you go to
[2:14:02] daniel 7
[2:14:03] verse 25 and 27 you'll find out that a
[2:14:07] law was given by the middle prison
[2:14:11] that everybody must respect the god of
[2:14:14] the jew
[2:14:17] amen and the law of the middle and
[2:14:20] prison does not change
[2:14:22] once they put it there they don't remove
[2:14:24] it amen
[2:14:26] but mordecai was correct according to
[2:14:29] that law
[2:14:31] but the accuser is trying to show him
[2:14:34] that
[2:14:35] hey these people don't follow that law
[2:14:37] that's the reason why they acting the
[2:14:39] way they acting
[2:14:40] amen the accuser of the brethren job to
[2:14:43] verse nine
[2:14:45] i'm trying to save you time there
[2:14:48] neither keep dead that king's law
[2:14:50] therefore it is not for the king's
[2:14:52] prophet to allow them

[2:14:57] let it be written that they may be
[2:15:01] destroyed and i will pay what

[2:20:51] and job will say that i know
[2:20:53] that my redeemer leaveth he takes that
[2:20:56] trial to bring job out

[2:21:10] if you remember some of you remember
[2:21:12] you're gonna get it
[2:21:13] esther chapter eight verse two
[2:21:23] are you there remember this ring again
[2:21:27] everybody there and the king took off
[2:21:30] his
[2:21:33] the bible is very specific because you
[2:21:35] must say the king have five rings
[2:21:40] the bible is going to explain us which
[2:21:42] ring
[2:21:43] okay over there they took the ring and
[2:21:45] gave it to him
[2:21:47] now it's very specific we want to know
[2:21:49] which ring
[2:21:50] amen the king took off his wing
[2:21:54] which he had taken from who
[2:21:57] you see now you see now everybody clear
[2:22:02] and give it to who let's go back to
[2:22:05] verse
[2:22:05] chapter three amen so the ring
[2:22:09] that was given to modic to heaven
[2:22:12] to give him permission to bring
[2:22:15] trouble to the jews was the same ring
[2:22:20] that was given to moderate to reverse
[2:22:24] the trouble of heaven
[2:22:27] and we know that a ring is a signet
[2:22:30] and a signet was also called a seal
[2:22:35] so the same seal
[2:22:38] that opened the door to the devil
[2:22:41] is the same seal that gives you
[2:22:45] power to destroy the devil
[2:22:51] brother stephen this seal
[2:22:54] that was given to him and they are the
[2:22:56] same ring what are you talking about

[2:23:11] so much in the message
[2:23:13] you notice now for the end time what
[2:23:17] this what which seal
[2:23:21] so the seventh seal is what
[2:23:25] any question any question
[2:23:30] so the seventh seal is the message of
[2:23:33] the end time
[2:23:36] we're clear after all he's revealed all
[2:23:40] the six
[2:23:41] but don't say nothing about the seven
[2:23:43] and the anthem which is which seal
[2:23:47] so the seventh seal is the end time
[2:23:51] seal ever clear when the seven seal
[2:23:55] comes
[2:23:56] what do you have the opening of the word
[2:23:58] come and is given to you

[2:28:38] let's pray
[2:28:41] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[2:28:44] for your grace
[2:28:46] for love and for your mercy father just
[2:28:49] a blank of your revelation
[2:28:51] take all the worries away take all
[2:28:55] the pressure off it takes the
[2:28:58] frustration the anxiety off
[2:29:00] because many things are on tv many on
[2:29:04] the news
[2:29:04] and people are perplexed they don't even
[2:29:07] know what to do lord
[2:29:09] father but you send us a message that is
[2:29:12] giving us
[2:29:13] peace in the midst of trouble because
[2:29:16] you spoke in your word that you shall
[2:29:18] never leave us
[2:29:19] nor forsake us you will be with us all
[2:29:22] the way to the end
[2:29:23] father you are folding what the devil is
[2:29:27] doing
[2:29:27] lord father behind bars now he's coming
[2:29:31] up slowly
[2:29:32] and he's against the messenger he's
[2:29:35] against this
[2:29:35] revealed precious word the inheritance
[2:29:38] that you have given us lord
[2:29:40] father to hold dear to our life lord
[2:29:44] you have shown us that whatever is
[2:29:46] happening in this world
[2:29:48] you are the one that allow it you are
[2:29:50] the one
[2:29:51] that gave the permission just like you
[2:29:54] gave permission to judah
[2:29:55] it seems like judah took you to a rough
[2:29:58] time
[2:29:58] he took you to a difficult time but it
[2:30:01] was nothing but exactly the plan of
[2:30:04] redemption
[2:30:05] because he was prophesied that you will
[2:30:07] be crucified
[2:30:08] he was prophesied lord father that by
[2:30:10] your strap we were healed
[2:30:12] all those prophecy had to be fulfilled
[2:30:14] lord and by going through your darkest
[2:30:17] age
[2:30:18] that's when lord father you brought the
[2:30:19] greatest victory
[2:30:21] and father you have started this journey
[2:30:24] you started with our forefather in
[2:30:26] ephesus
[2:30:27] father sam died through the dark ages
[2:30:30] luther picked it up
[2:30:31] wesley picked it up the pentecostal
[2:30:33] picked it up
[2:30:34] now we are at the end of the end when
[2:30:37] you're gonna finish this battle once for
[2:30:39] all
[2:30:40] and our mortal body lord will be changed
[2:30:43] in the twinkling of the eye
[2:30:45] and father we're gonna be clothed with
[2:30:47] glorified body
[2:30:48] father you have given us a kingdom that
[2:30:50] shall never be shaken
[2:30:52] you have given us a word that will be
[2:30:54] that will withstand the devil
[2:30:56] any place anywhere under any
[2:30:59] circumstances
[2:31:00] father the hour is too late may
[2:31:03] everybody
[2:31:04] check their own life may we make sure we
[2:31:06] are connected
[2:31:07] and we are in harmony with you lord
[2:31:09] because you're gonna fight this battle
[2:31:11] and you have given us the power and you
[2:31:14] told us that
[2:31:15] what we saw temporarily manifested in
[2:31:18] the life of your prophet
[2:31:19] father when that squeeze will come up
[2:31:21] father we're gonna see that in fullness
[2:31:23] lord
[2:31:24] father we are relying on your word
[2:31:26] because heaven and earth will pass away
[2:31:28] but your word will never pass away we
[2:31:31] know lord father that we are the
[2:31:33] children of the most high
[2:31:34] there is no temptation that can take us
[2:31:37] unaware
[2:31:37] all that can be above lord father the
[2:31:40] power that you have bestowed to your
[2:31:42] children
[2:31:42] father you have given us a great message
[2:31:45] with a great power
[2:31:46] because your prophet told us that the
[2:31:48] restoration of the word
[2:31:50] bring the restoration of the power
[2:31:52] father we are
[2:31:53] under the shadow of the almighty lord we
[2:31:56] are following the pillar of fire lord
[2:31:59] father may we will ask lord father that
[2:32:01] we need to relax

[2:32:06] our lips will speak of your word until
[2:32:09] we will speak things to existence lord
[2:32:11] until we will begin to express you
[2:32:13] mightily and fully like never before
[2:32:16] because you say that before our
[2:32:18] departure lord we're not gonna go like a
[2:32:20] brother that has been defeated
[2:32:22] but we will leave this earth lord father
[2:32:24] as a victorious blood lord

[2:32:50] show your children
[2:32:51] that everything is under control we are
[2:32:54] not left alone
[2:32:55] even though it seems like we are alone
[2:32:58] it seems like
[2:32:58] we have been forsaken it seems like
[2:33:01] things happen back and forth deception
[2:33:03] lord father we are disappointed left and
[2:33:06] right
[2:33:06] but we are not lord you are controlling
[2:33:09] everything
