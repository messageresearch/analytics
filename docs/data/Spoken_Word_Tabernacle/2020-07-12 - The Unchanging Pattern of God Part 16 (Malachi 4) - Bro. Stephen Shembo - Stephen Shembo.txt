is a coming somebody's coming there is a coming there somebody's coming I am kama in my garden you might be seated somebody's coming and this person is coming to a garden I could have moved with Malachi for straight but I felt led to go the Holy Spirit want me to insist on this and Lord's willing on Wednesday so we will be talking about the second part of John the Baptist today then on Wednesday we're going to touch the part of John the Baptist that is connected to Malachi 4 that's where there is a lot of confusion where people say he shall return the heart of the people the father to the kids and things like that well we'll take it on Wednesdays so if you can please be connected on Wednesday especially on people we need to unfold that and show you where is the portion of John the Baptist in Malachi 4 because the people got confused when they say remember the law of Moses if you remember in brother metamers church we went through what happened in Horeb everybody clear you remember that so when they say remember the law of my servant Moses in Horeb you already know what it means but there is a portion there for John the Baptist that says that he shall return the heart of the father to the children and the people got really mixed up there because they're using that they say no the second portion is going to go for the Jewish we're gonna attach John the Baptist right there then laws willing on Sunday we would take brother Branham and see where brother Branham lives all right there and you were gonna separate the two you want to see it in your scripture so today is we are dealing with John the Baptist still so I am calm somebody's coming into his garden he is calling this is gardening so go to chapter 4 right there on the top I want you to catch this verse 12 everybody there you I want you to see what is this garden everybody there a gardening clothes is my so that garden is not a garden where they are planting stuff it is a woman so there is a coming to the garden coming to a woman but that woman Solomon is calling her sister why is she called sister why did in Salomon go straight ahead and say model my wife are you there a gardening clothes is my sister , my spouse so before she became his past she was first a sister are there brother before you bring somebody to be a wife that's that that woman must be first a sister you bear with me let me help you here so as we saw just keep your finger right here take first Corinthians chapter 9 let me clear this out of the way just please bear with me I know we got used to read the scripture and move on but I want you to really get it yeah first Corinthians chapter 9 if you dare you can say Amen and we're going to go back to the book of Solomon first five everybody their page is still moving I don't want you say brightest even say first carranger in chapter 9 verse 5 everybody there this is Paul talking he said have we not power to lead about air comma and wife comma as well as other apostle and as the Brethren of the Lord and Cephas Paul is saying that the other a posto are married Peter is married don't you think we also have the right to use our sister and to convert the sister to a wife are you there so brother you cannot be married outside the message are we clear the woman that you're gonna be called ie that would be call your wife must first be a sister are you there that's why Paul repeated Solomon he said first we can lead our sister she must have the Holy Ghost she must be converted first then you can make your choice on a woman that is a sister let's go back now to the Song of Solomon now clear verse 12 of chapter 4 a gardening clothes is my sister not just a woman as sister my spouse so even though you are married to her don't forget that she's our sister I'm refraining myself for marriage and divorce here I have coats but maybe down the road you will see why that's why brother Branham said remember in your relationship treat her as a daughter of Abraham ax you remember that God I believe you reading in between the liner because she is a sister a gardening clothes is my sister must pass a spring shut up it is closed a fan ten children in other word this woman is a virgin let's go back to the phone with chapter five verse one now so I am coming into my garden so there is a coming of this King Solomon is coming to his garden okay my sister that's the garden my spouse I have gathered my myrrh with my spice so when Solomon is coming to this garden Solomon is have package and that package have Mel and spice keep your finger right here I'm sorry bear with me let's go to the Book of Jonah I'm just clearing this so it won't be tedious when we move on on the scripture John chapter 20 hallelujah John chapter 20 verse 39 if you did everybody there John chapter 20 verse 39 everybody there John 20 the first 39 I'm sorry give me what first I'm sorry John chapter 19 verse 39 thank you this just came right there when I was sitting there on top of my bubble he says 20 so I got caught up with joy me I'm glad somebody's watching first John chapter 19 verse 39 everybody there and there came also Nicodemus which at the first came to Jesus by nod and brought a mixture of what you see the merriday okay and Alice it's a spice everybody clear about a hundred pound weight then took the body of Jesus and wound in other word rub wound it in line and cloves with the spices everybody see as the manner of the Jews is to bury let's go back to the Song of Solomon now chapter father so Solomon is coming when he's coming to his wife when he's coming to this woman this woman is a virgin and Solomon is anointed with myrrh and spice he's coming as a sacrifice everybody clear now he's anointed with myrrh and spice they say I have gathered my myrrh and with my spouse in other word they caught the office he's approaching this woman that office is connected to the heat to his death that office is connected to his death as a sacrifice are they okay I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey so not only is this sacrifice Solomon presenting with himself with myrrh and spice but Solomon have honey and if you go read some 19 dev he told us that there is a honey that comes from the rock are there so there is a revelation that is producing honey Salamone is coming with the sacrifice and he is also coming with a revelation that have honey because in the book of Revelation chapter 10 when John ate the book in the mouth evil sweet as water are you there so Steve's coming is coming with a sacrifice connected to a revelation everybody clear okay I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine and whatever Adam told us that one is the stimulation of that's why this honey is coming there Hani's coming with a liner there is a revelation that is unfold that Solomon is bringing who's Solomon I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine with my milk we know that Paul spoke about the milk of the gospel to give to the baby so this package is full he have the supreme sacrifice he have the revelation of the world and he also have the milk so it's going to take care of the little children and it's going to take care of the adults are we clear with the opening of the seals the barber became a new book with my milk eat or friends drink yeah drink abundantly or beloved now it's the beloved now the woman first to AH sleep so this woman all sleeping Matthew 25 you remember the virgin were [Music] everybody clear asleep but my heart waits so the oles awakening that happened to this woman were words the woman it is the voice of my beloved ah knocks so there is a voice that comes and that voice is connected to a knocking at the door and the one that is speaking and knocking is the beloved very clear praise the lord saying open to me my sister my love my dove you remember the constellation of the Pleiades with seven doll so we clear my head is filled with that we do so that means it's in the night and my love's with the job of the night remember when the foolish virgin and the wise virgin were sleeping they cried the midnight cry came and night and midnight are we there trace the Lord verse three this is the woman talking I have put up my coat if you look in another translation it's the robe the government of the woman so this woman is inside her home the husband came anointed with the sacrifice he have honey he has milk he have wine with a revelation and everything when he's knocking at the door the woman is on the inside but the woman took off her clothes in other words she's there now this is blond em naked with here you see the woman she has taken off her clothes I have put off my coat her shall I put it on I have washed my feet how shall I be found him another way to go open the door to the husband she doesn't wanna bear that sacrifice she's more concerned about her feet staying clean versus going to open her own husband who's knocking at the door verse 4 my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door now brother branham keep telling us that this door the light shed is not on the outside where did brother branham see that did he give you a court did he give you Scripture no but right here we found out that the door of this woman have a little hole and the husband was outside knocking knocking knocking knocking and finally because the woman doesn't want to open the door their husband put the hand inside the hole of the door to access the light shed that is on the Assad so this door only opens from the inside not the outside everybody clear now my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door my Bower will move for him she begin to fill her heart moving I rose up to open to my beloved and my hand job with me and my finger with sweet-smelling meal upon the handle of the look so because of there the husband insisted insisted insisted and the woman was not opening he took his hand and he put it in the hole and he accessed the latch and he anointed that door that latch of the door with myrrh what does marry means after knocking knocking daunting you don't open the latch at of your door will be anointed with Mary let's go verse 6 I opened my beloved but my beloved has withdrawn himself too late you see that Laodicea too late mmm and was gone my soul fed when he spoke he will so sweet I heard this sermon I sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave me no answer the time of mercy was cut off that's why they anointed her latch it with mer mer struck the husband first and the husband was dead but because she's that the husband is insisting insisting and the woman don't open that anointing move not the husband but he went and took the handle of the door and put death gone verse 7 the watchman if you notice this watchman our guard there soldier the watchman that went about the city found me they smote me either she is thrown into the Tribulation Period because brother branham said in the book of Revelation there is a dragon that was after a woman and when that woman took a flight by the eagle wings either the message of the great eagle took the woman out then the dragon was wroth against the remnant of the woman which is the foolish virgin and the Bible said the dragon spurred water and what venom say water means a multitude of the people which was showing the armies that's going to be spurred to go and abuse the foolish virgin that rejected the call of the husband everybody clear now now she said that I open verse 7 the watchman that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me she's under persecution now the keepers of the world took away my veil from me she is throwing down into the darkness where there is crying and gnashing of teeth because their husband took off let's go to Hebrews chapter 4 and the people think the Bible is not in inspired book they don't know what it took in about Hebrew chapter 4 verse 1 if you dare you can say Amen let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his arrest are there any of you should seem to come short of it for to us was the gospel preached as well as to them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it the gospel preached to them but yet it didn't profit them everybody clear verse 6 seeing therefore it remained that some must enter in and there whom it was first preached entered not because of unbelief again he limits a certain day he gave another opportunity after a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice the husband is knocking if you will hear his voice harden not your heart like that woman are we there for if Jesus has given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remain there remains therefore arrest for the people of God the rest is the Holy Ghost for he that is entered into his rest is also is now he also has seized from his own work as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into the rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief last scripture revelation chapter 3 verse 20 when you hear is the husband is knocking open quickly you take too long they latch it yourself will the door of the heart will be seared everybody there Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 everybody there be all that standard there remember Solomon was way at the door behold I stand at the door and knock lo lo Salomon doing knocking do you see clear now we understand at the door and knock If any man hear my verse you see the Song of Solomon hear my voice and opened the the woman opened the door to late and open the door I will come in remember the husband was coming in either I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me so in the age of law Asia there will be a coming of Christ an opportunity being given to the church to open the door so that Christ can come in and sup with you but if you take too long you going to be anointed with myrrh let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father let this scenario that we just read be not imputed to this congregation father but let each one of this congregation whether they are here or on the stream or they will be watching later may they open the door to the crust that has been kicked out by denomination but who's trying to gain back insurance into the heart of individual own father we commit this service unto the handle may the Holy Spirit Lord made inside the teacher maybe you come and Lord father unfold your word to your children bring their power download and fill these Temple Lord as we are gathered here together we seal every work of the devil away from this place may you be the Alpha and the Omega Lord as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen take your Bible to the book of Mark chapter 1 we are going with the unchanging part of God we are part 16 like we said we are laying a foundation we don't want you to get any trouble with the Ministry of the centum again on Wednesday when we open Wednesday we started with John the Baptist and we identify John the Baptist to be as they are 40 and then Malachi 3 but there was an event that happened in the house in the ministry of John the Baptist and according to that event the Lord which was the Spirit of the Lord for those who followed on Wednesday the Lord which was the Spirit of the Lord came into his temple and we proved to you clearly on Wednesday that that temple was not the tabernacle because the tabernacle was already anointed by Moses he was not the Temple of Solomon because the Temple of Solomon was already anointed but God was looking for a place of rest that's why Hebrews talking about a rest and finally God brought us a temple which we look in the scripture and we found that that temple was speaking about the body of Jesus Christ and the pillar of fire in the form of the dog enter that body because according to Isaiah 40 the Lord will come and enter suddenly into his temple and that happened in the river of Jordan now as we dig deeper into John the Baptist because on Wednesday Lord willing we will show you that John the Baptist has question and answer we will see that in the scripture are there go to the book of Mark chapter 1 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible say the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God we prove to you on my own Wednesday that mark took Isaiah 40 and Malachi 4 and put them together okay now as it is written in the prophet behold I will send my messenger before your face which shall prepare your way before you we talked about this on Wednesday the voice of one crying into the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his paths straight so we see those two Scripture were talking about one person verse 4 John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of lament of repentance for the remission of sin so the message of Jonah not only was there a message to prepare the way of the Lord and then to introduce crust and to point the Lord Jesus Christ John had a message of repentance everybody here and John have every a message of water baptism but something strange in the scripture says that the repentance here was the repentance for remission of sin now brother Branham says that if you look at the scripture superficially you're going to come up with a superficial understanding if you look at this water baptism it looks like when somebody was baptized under John their sin was already remitted if it's so when Paul came in up to chapter 19 he should not have we baptized people again if it's oh if you go by this scripture right there and say repentance of a remission of sin you want to get in trouble John had two ways in his ministry or John had the way that to fulfill something straight ahead and the second part of John he was only pointing to something that will come are you there so not everything that John spoke happened in his ministry some of them happen but other he was just pointing you to something that is gonna follow his ministry everybody clear okay verse four John did baptize in the wilderness and preach the repentance of sin for the remission of what the baptism of repentance for the remission of sin and there went out to him or the land of Judea and day of Jerusalem and we're all baptized does his message of him in the River Jordan confessing their sin why there they were there confessing their sins because there was a message of repentance everybody clear okay now verse seven and preach let me drop to verse seven and preach saying dare come one mightier than I after me now John is not fulfilling this but now he is pointing are you there they come one after me their large set of whose shoes we already explained why he didn't touch the largest that's why he didn't have the supernatural okay the large set of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and I lose I indeed baptize you with what water that was his message everybody clear I indeed baptize you with water but his shop is a future he's pointing he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost so the message of John contain repentance but the repentance was only pointing into the religion of sin I'm gonna go slowly his message on also contain water baptism and his message also contained the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody clear but this baptism but John was not the one to do it but John was only planting to somebody everybody clear so far so we have three element who are here in the message of John repent be baptized and the Holy Ghost I believe you begin to see clear everybody there we have word about this we have repentance and we have the Holy Ghost John can baptize you but not for a lesion of sin you can repent after John no problem but the Holy Ghost no he was just pointing the people into him let's go to John chapter 1 lord help me manage the time I want this to sink clearly John chapter 1 verse 33 if you dare you can say Amen now I know him not but he does sent me to baptize so John did not come with water baptism just like that it was a message that God gave to him to do it you now understand okay he does send me to baptize with water so what John was doing was a commandment of God baptized with water the same said to me upon whom you shall see the spirit descending which plane this and remain on him the same is he which baptizeth the Holy Ghost so the message came God gave John a message and the message they gave John all you need to take the people and baptize them why do we need to baptize the people there is something in the Old Testament that is called eleven are there so when the sinner was coming and approaching go into the tabernacle on the outside there was something that was delivered the I had water so what happened is you bring your Lambo and your lab have to be washed first are you there before you kill dilemma everybody clear so when John was baptizing the people the land was not dead yet go back to John chapter 1 where idea where we are go back on verse 29 the Bible say the next day John sees Jesus coming to him and say behold the lamb of God which the scene of them was Jesus crucified that's why the baptism of John only pointed but Qunari meat sin but the lamb must be first wash and the one who was washing the lamb was livid do you know that John the Baptist was a Levite are there so God took from the language the lineage of a lever and pull John the Baptist out of the Levitical priesthood and send him into a different way because one Levite must be there to baptize or to wash their Lamb of God the believer positioning cross what did he speak of the Lord Jesus Christ let me drop down here to save time God coming to his temple to be worshipped from that temple talking about the Temple of Solomon where the blood outside made in a tournament then when Jesus came on earth when he was baptized in Jordan as the washing you see brother branham ha scriptural he's as the washing of the lamp at the present level are you there notice then John bear where could seeing the spirit of god like a dog coming from above and settle on him he went into him God coming to his temple but a Branham help us more often Tom I have wondered why that that Jesus of Nazareth and many times it's been asking me why would a man like Jesus have to be baptized are you there because the people that were baptized have to confess their sin but Jesus did not seem everybody why would this person be baptized has it not of repentance and of confession when he was the Holy spotless and adulterated son of the Living God why would this person have to be baptized like a man coming Baptist fees after confession he had no confession to make because he was God and why would he have to be baptized like head unto repentance because he needed no repentance for he was the infallible God brother Branham is asking a question why the identification brother Branham say suffered that to be this is John to occupy Jesus for that he become to us that we fulfill all righteousness why then John being a prophet and him being the world know that he was the sacrifice John understood that that's why he said behold the lamb of God everybody clear knew that he was the sacrifice so the sacrifice has to be washed over here before it is presented so he baptized Jesus washing the word before he was presented you see now so everything was under the scripture but they say remission of sin now we just read here in John chapter one the Bible says that the land away that take away sin so what does remit mean remission what does he mean brother Branham every person from that day on was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they found some of that Baptist in no name at all so when John was baptizing people John just baptize them but there was no name attached to the baptism of John so the baptism of John was a baptism that didn't have any name because John himself said that I knew him not are you there and brother Branham say that and they found some that was baptized in no name at all and the original greek says right here and both the hebrew that the baptism in the name of jesus is the forgiveness of sin both Greek and Hebrew Ram it means to forgive of course if I remit anything is to take it away to remit to take it away behold the lamb of God that take away are you there that's why the baptism of John was only unto repentance take away let's go to up to chapter 19 if you go to the scripture they say for the remission of sin for the remission of sin when Paul came o Lord l prophet and a prophet usually comes and would be higher are you there now Paul in after 19 here he found the people that were baptized and Paul said to them in verse 2 he say unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they say unto Him we have not so much of her as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost do you know that when John was preaching he was telling them that the Holy Ghost will come why they didn't hear that why didn't hear that yet they were baptized unto John but they miss the part of the Holy Ghost coming be careful church are you there verse 3 and he said to them - what then were you baptized and they said to John baptism and John was already talking about the coming Holy Ghost are you then verse 4 then paul said john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance for a mission of sealing did you see Paul saying that so when Paul speak about the baptism of John Paul removes remission of sin are there because Paul understood that the Baptist was not removing sin because the lab was not crucified Paul did not contradict mark mark was telling you that Oh John was only pointing but Paul as a prophet must clarify things he said when we talk about John take away remission of sin he doesn't belong to him he belongs to the Lamba are you dead okay brother brother he said Paul met some that already had been baptized and they were shouting heads turi he says unto what were you baptized they say unto John he said John baptized unto repented he doesn't bet remission of sin now get it aren't you repentant not for remission of sin well did brother Branham learn that how many understand that not for remission of sin the blood one oblivious Christian year be careful they were baptized alright unto repentance they were replanted yes yes sir I have repented I believe he's coming they were baptized unto repentance that is to say believing pushing pointing them on the Lord Jesus Christ because if the baptism of John was for the remission of sin the Old Testament sense should have come out but all of them were under the old sacrifice in Paradise not in heaven because their sin were only covered but they were not removed it takes Jesus Christ to remove the seed of the world are we clear he says here that then when they heard this that the sec the sacrifice already come now they knew that Jesus already came and died they were baptized over again in the name of Jesus are we clear now here he says John only baptized unto repentance just as much water as you could get them under in other words just get them put them on the order out that's it under which name we don't know are we there now unto repentance not for remission of sin because the sacrifice was not here yet so when we talked about this the Ministry of John Donne name is sweet speak about these three elements let's go now to John chapter 7 so we clarified the scripture click quickly and then we take off non chapter 7 don't get tired we need this if you think this is too much if they shut you down with Quran again you will be appreciated in church time John chapter 7 verse 38 are you there Quran I showed you that they can shut you down and everything is worthless your car worthless your clothes where your hands were free you can go no way John chapter 7 verse 38 he that believes on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this is Jesus speaking but this spoke he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet been given was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet Jesus have to die resurrect be glorified then he opened the door further so even though John his message has the three element that we found in up to 38 but John lack the remission of sin and John Rock deliver but on the day of Pentecost when Peter comes Peter puts the prescription properly he say repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's go to acts 2:38 it's got to act 2:38 if you dare you can say Amen everybody they don't go by your memory please look in the book are you there at 2:38 then Peter said to them do what we planned everybody clear number two and be baptized every one of you not only Baptist but in the name of Jesus Christ what for the remission of why because that's the name that take away the seed of the world you see that the formula when you do that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's why brother Branham called that a prescription and when the happen if you notice God enter into Christ in the rising of the Sun he went there with you in see God has never separated the blood from the brilliant the pillar of fire was not only for Moses it was for all Israel the pillar of fire wasn't long before brother Branham he was further bride what happened to Jesus Christ was not only for Jesus Christ he was further [Music] so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both man and fever when God created Adam Adam or both man and and Jesus is called the second they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speak of the so if the Lord enter into the body of Jesus Plus suddenly the Lord must also enter into your body suddenly why brother Branham say that God has a three-fold purpose he says first to express himself completely God in Christ second to help preeminence by this in his church which is his body the blood till he could have the preeminence to express himself through death and turn to restore the kingdom in the Millennium why because Adam fell - to live a thousand years but Christ that's why in the third coming Jesus Christ will come with his brother brother Branham the works that I do shall you do also and in the last day the last day it shall come to pass behold our same to you why are we sending Elijah Elijah the prophet he shall turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the father what does that mean in the in the Ministry of Elijah they will be a term come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his Godhead did through his church either so when they are sending the message when the husband is coming to his garden he is coming to aunt Arina have the preeminence in the church oh my what the anointed man that was Jesus Christ now they are known people are we clear all right to bring the anointed bride the groom anointed by why accepting what is turned on and Adam coming back with the anointed world because he said my word is spirit they are not anointed with the world very Bradham the first year God promised that he will send us a true prophet after sure we fair message who returned the original Word of God they fell first the father what is the faith of the father the faith of the father to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people we clear with a power that will ways help both these things and let her in at the same time yes same world being vindicated of Jesus Christ and he is the same yesterday today and forever now in the proof of his resurrection brother Branham say that the father that sent me is with me oh my what declaration what a world the father that sent me come with me listen as the father sent me so do I send you so Jesus say the same way God sent me that's the same way I am also sending you what does he mean brother branham Alleluia he don't only send you but he goes with you we clear I will be with you even in you unto the end of the world all that was in God was pour in and all that was in class was emptied and to the believer the church notice here another thing I like to say right here Jesus say as the father has sent me now watch as the father has sent me so say my you how did the father send him brother the Father God sent him come down from heaven and dwell in him we clear now now he said I always do that which is pleases my father see he went about doing the things of the Father that's the father was showing him to do I do nothing except my father shows me first day God that sent him was on the inside of him we're going clearly now as the father sent me the same way the father sent me so I send you what is it God in you carrying on the same work as the father sent me so I send you the father descend the son went with the son and was in the Sun the Jesus descends a man goes with him and is in him to perform the same work so if God came here into his temple is Jesus the only temple God he'll take John chapter 14 if you dare you can say Amen John chapter 14 verse 18 I would not leave you comfortless okay he's trying to go but before he goes he begin to talk I will come to you how is he coming again remember Solomon have to come to the bridal either and in the age of loud ISA he's outside also nothing just like Solomon was also nothing yet a little while and the world deceives me no more but you bye you see me because I live you shall live also and that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you which day when I send you Elijah he shall returned her what is he interested in a heart the heart is the occupancy of the soul and in the soul brother Branham said there is only one access which is the South wheel and that self will is the logic that you have to happen for your husband to Camille but the logic is under Assad you have the right to reject and a right to accept let's go to verse 23 jesus answered and said to him if a man love me remember Solomon was saying my dove my love there is a love affair right if a man love me he will keep my word and my father will love me and we will come him Solomon was coming are you there we were come to him and make our abode do you know what aboard means our house our abode with him okay if Jesus say we need to come to us and make our place his house we also temple of God take first Corinthians chapter 3 I hope you're not tired first Corinthians chapter 3 if you dare you can say Amen verse 9 I want everybody to see this yourself so we are laboring together with God this is Paul you are gods what how many knows what that means husbandry means field or garden looking under translation Paul is saying you are God's garden Salomon was coming to his are you clear you are God's husbandry you are God's building do you see that did you see that yourself job 2 verse 16 now you are a building of God and you are also a garden and we find Salomon trying to get up selves to his sister his love his garden are you there let's go to verse 16 if you dare you can say Amen know ye not that ye are the temple of God always the Jesus was the temple of God today you are their temple of God and that the Spirit of God to us in because that spirit was in Jesus Christ and watch because of the groom because of death verse 17 if any male defiled the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple you are we clear now let's go to chapter 6 on first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 if you dare you can say a man everybody clear what know you not that you are your body is there so not only the body of Jesus Christ was the temple of God but your body also is the temple of you see now no you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own somebody cleanse you verse 20 for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods in other word you entirely belong to God you don't belong on your own that's why the husband is saying that I am coming to my garden he is calling that my garden you see that let's go to a vision too Ephesian to verse 19 it will be soon done with Scripture Ephesian to verse 19 if you dare you can say Amen therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizen with the same of the household of God and our built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building patatas in Carentan that we are God's building in whom all the building fitly framed together grows as a holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are built together for a habitation you are a house you are a temple just as Jesus Christ was a temple you also are a temple a habitation of God through the spirit are you there one more first Peter chapter 2 so today no more question whether you are a temple of God or not first Peter chapter 2 verse father are you there you also as living stones build up a spiritual house everybody clear a holy priesthood Melchizedek to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ in other words all these scriptures that I gave you first Corinthian 3 1st Corinthians 6 Ephesians 2 first Peter - all of them are pointing you and declaring to you that you also are the temple of God and we found out that the temple of God when the Lord came down he entered into the temple of Jesus Christ suddenly if we are temple of God let's go to up to chapter 2 you need to know this then you can claim it if you don't know you can't claim it if they don't give you your right you don't know what to claim you'll be home starving not knowing that as in American cities and you can do this you can do this you can do this so we need to give you the declaration of the independence so you know what is your right and when you go to the dss you now please stop in there and say I have a question now you get there you say I need to file for unemployment and nobody will say no they will say you go there get the application and file they say where is your Social Security said this is it where is your ID this is it you need to know this so when you get before God you say this is a this is a this is a this is a this is that are you then after chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all not some people Oh with one Accord in one place and the Lord whom you seek shall come suddenly to his temple he happened with Jesus Christ now it is not Jesus Christ it is 120 people but when the Lord is coming he's also coming suddenly we clear and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing Madi wing and fill all the house where they were sitting and they appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire and he sat upon each one of them and there were some fill so there is a possibility for the entire church to receive the Holy Ghost either are you there they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak in town and as the Spirit of God gave them what happened during Jesus Christ came before Jesus Christ if you go back in the Temple of Solomon you can put this down there was a hundred and twenty leave that in the temple do you know that take your Bible second Chronicle how many people were in the day of Pentecost let's go to 2nd chronicles chapter 5 but you get there you can say Amen second coat second chronicles chapter five verse 12 everybody there you there also delivered which were the singers all of them of Asif and Haman of Jeddah tub with their sons and their Britain being arrayed in white diamond you go to the book of Revelation you see that white land that was the address of the bride which is the righteousness of the with white diamond having symbols and psaltery and harp stood at the East End of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding grief trumpet he came to he come even to pass as the trumpeter and the singer whereas one they make one son to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lift up their voice with the trumpet and cymbals an instrument of music and praise the Lord saying for his be is good for his mercy endures forever that the house not the people are you there the house was filled with the cloud even the house of death in the Old Testament God when he came even though there was a hundred and twenty priests the pillar of fire only filled the house because the lamb was not slain it he was the one that take away the sin of the but when Jesus Christ came and John was him and he was crucified and he took away the sin of the world either in the day of Pentecost in the Sun Temple the upper room was in the temple in the sound when the cloud cancel instead of filling the temple the cloud fill the people how many people a hundred then he know he came deviate the people and fill the temple over there when he come the plug of Jesus Christ said no more the temple this way this way this way this way this way this way the pillar of fire wanna go to the altar Jesus say this is no more my temple I have new temples you when God came to his own temple yeah the church does when he came to them he feel it the temples plural that were dedicated just like he did that Solomon temple he feel it not with crib not with denomination but with he filled the temple with his Chicana grew so did he do on the day of Pentecost he filled them 120 temple that was up there with with the Holy Ghost itself the Shekinah glory brought through upon them in the Temple of Solomon the pillar of fire came he look at the people the blood of bulls and goats aha he went to the Holy of Holies and sat there but after the death resurrection and glorification of Jesus Christ Jesus opened the door that's why the mercy seat was split in two and the very walls open when the pillar of fire cameras the blood of Jesus Christ said how much the pillar of fire say how much have to feel are you there are you there and Jesus say here I have a hundred and twenty the pillar of fire said no worry I'm going to divide myself and the pillar of fire begin to divide itself one two three four and a ladder and when power may was going on the road to Emmaus he also see who the pillar of fire why when the bread was in the hand of Jesus Christ he can cut his return it's back again normal he cut back again normal he can't back again Roman he cut back and I know that's what John the Baptist said of his fullness we are go to John chapter one what did John chapter 1 John chapter 118 praise the Lord no.16 are you there and office the fullness of who Christ are you there have we all receive grace for you know that why when the pillar of fire came he divided fill the people but yet Paul can see him again because he's the fountain of water of what is fallible when you take water you still come out when you take water it still comma when he gives the bread is still come out when he cut the bread is still comma is the hole but he has other temple there is God to his temple God to his dedicated temple not the man-made achievement because that was the tabernacle that was the Temple of Solomon but the Moscow a guy God does not live in the temple made with no more the tabernacle no more the temple of God of settlement now I need living people that we found in cloud ISA brother branham say there was a painter that painted this and when the printer printed these people criticized him they say that you didn't put the light on the outside and Granum took this printer and turn around and say this printer was right if that's the profit to approve which painter is right many people view the picture of Jesus car he touched the Prophet to identify which picture is right either that's why when the Prophet to look he looked look he said the head of Hofmann and when they cloud the council God said take the cloud turn to the right he proved the head of Hartman [Applause] he touched the prophet to identify the truthful in that's John to identify the longer behold the lamb of God here are the picture of us when we had this picture of us men understand who do attacks John - pointer to you as John the Baptist was the foreigner is that's another child who went to you the Lamb of God [Music] and when he calmly said the ratchet is not on the outside it is on the inside where did brother Branham have that when you read Salomon the logit is only when the bottom say that door is the heart because in the heart is the soul but who is Salomon now he was referring to Sullivan God was phenomenal as it helped of Christ over there so Solomon was also a trappers David was a top-off if you read the Bible you don't see question what go back again hallelujah but when Solomon counsel he is anointed he is gathering up with what myrrh and we found out that the body of Jesus Christ when he was killed he was anointed with what brother Branham and anyone knows that Mel is a very question but bitter herb a man of soul appointed with grief are either what did may represent his great supreme so Solomon is a poised upon Qing this woman the supreme sacrifice of the member why because the book of redemption was in the hand of the original owner and the cry came and they said who is worthy to take the book and to practice here and no one wants way to accept that the supreme sacrifice he was the one worthy to come and to take the book and when he took the book he comes down in revelation held the book chilling revelation 5 innovation Thunder booties he's coming to job to the bride with an open with Mohammed the simulation of what did man represent his great supreme sacrifice he's crushed out young life at Calvary where the sins of the world grant him in two beats gold because of king he talking about the three things and myrrh because of his sacrifice for for sinner that he dare he was wounded for our he was blue for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was with brother Branham is connecting that to the atonement your atonement is brought for the healing of the body and for the serving of the in other words Solomon is coming with the full atonement to this Friday but he hits the door of a foolish virgin thank God did Matthew 25 they were also wise virgins are you there nerve and that's the ladies that lunch is under we seen that in the scripture the brother branham ever give you a scripture in he lied Christ not ever know Salomon was doing what but you have to open the door he will not go against you he's not gonna go there and force your latchet that your will your self away but for God if you are predestinated you don't even manager will if you are predestinated whether you say no suddenly you find yourself opening up [Applause] nobody can come to me except your father how many women have said to a man no no no no and today they are the men's how otherwise how many women have done that the man keeps coming low demand comes no the man comes no one of this day I love you thank you I love you thank you that that time I love you I love you too you see now you know why because you are predestinated for the manner [Applause] the lattice on the asada crush not yet at all but you have to open the door he will not go against you will he gives you the ability to read II mean he cannot force himself in for there is knowledge for him to come in by you must open the door that's why Paul say in the book of Hebrew when you hear his voice the harder you open yer and then what would anyone knock at the door for why is Solomon knocking for what would the object of someone knocking at the door it's trying to gain interest is a referral with a message with a present is if you will be baptized with the gift after today he's bringing you the message but that message has a gift because he's trying to bring the Holy Ghost inside of you or with a commission mark 16 or something that the one is nothing is trying to get inside to see who is inside but what happened Jesus I am going to stand outside of your door and walk all the time he not my sister my love open open the woman thought that if I keep doing what I'm doing he's going to still there stay there there is a time when we shall get enough and turn away that's your song of settlement he got enough are you there and turn away then you should do their knocking but you shall never did the sooner much found him again are you there come well it is time he before come what the reason look don't you compromise with anything less the Baptist Master Holy Ghost like they got out with the same top of the same top that they did don't you let nothing put anything in your heart unless not a different Holy Ghost but the knock the lock and the woman doesn't want what happened he anointed the latchet with me what does he know was anointed off they are nothing of what when he came as a sacrifice he already took death for you he went to the cross he took your penalty he took your shin he died in your place because the lamp in the Old Testament was dying in the place of the sinner so the first approach he's approaching you saying I took your place I died for you I took the sacrifice I took the pen and took the rejection all I want you to do is open up your heart and I am coming if he looks if he looks and you don't listen then that turn around the same word that comes - says who turn into judgment the third - to the souls in prison John the 19th chapter the 39 verse that's going to the funeral service of Jesus when Mary and a moment they taken this man to anoint him we saw that over there he must be the servant of death for jehovah see somebody had to die so bringing them a showing that the deity and with the service that he also was anointed with myrrh that's this deed he had to be put to death in order to save the imperfect one which we were that was the first approach but since he did she did not open what happened the great man across remove and custom that did have life a few years ago right because in Azusa Street the Holy Ghost dropped down when the Holy Ghost job done he quickened the gift of the Spirit because the gift of the spirits were lost so God sent the Holy Ghost to restore back the nine gift of the spirit but there was a message docume the Pentecostal took the gift and they begin to go this way and this way and this way but there was a message coming out when the message karma the Pentecostal rejected the message when they rejected the message Muir was anointed in a Pentecostal church the Pentecostal move that did have in the past life a few years ago can't you see it's being anointed now with in other word Delta we father is time deaf Inc abode is blessed day we're going clear see the same own word was in the church here has come plumbed down and anointing this one down here dying out because they are going back to the ecclesiastical rod they are living the message other going back to the ecumenical move Murr has been anointed are you there and taking after the womanís Salomon says that I am sleeping I have done what takers life you remember take off the white robe says the leader people who stood a do and a genuine Holy Spirit spoke with dogs and manifested God and brother there was as honest and all wool and yard wine they absolutely were genuine you could trust them anyway in other word when the Pentecostal move started the people that were there when the Holy Ghost anointed them they were honest people genuine people but suddenly today we found coolkid preacher crooked people speaking in tongues living your hand away adultery homosexual in a post across the world what happened now you don't know what to trust and who to trust see there is something happened something happened what is it they are being anointed with of watch the people that live the message they become bitter against the messaging leader against brother branham read about the people that don't see like them it is an anointed of learn death instructing that's why the voice said come out of there but people hey come out of there my people the message come they rejected the message now he's knocking at the door but if you watch his not saying which church he said to whom they open he's dealing not with individual individual individual so this is your job to open yourself so that God can enter you can send the message of John the Baptist had the prescription repent be baptized and then you shall receive the Holy Spirit the repentance didn't bring the sinner to the remission of sin because the sacrifice has to be presented by John then washed and clear later and matter of fact when he was killed John already died John baptized with no name because jesus said that I come to reveal the father's name I come in my father's name he was the one died have to reveal the name of God that's why the Baptist means in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord Father Jesus son Christ's Holy Ghost baptize them in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost brother Branham say come Lord Jesus Christ the Baptist means done open the way so that Christ can come in don't be like I should among where they knock the knock she doesn't want to open the door she still there she does I want to open the door she doesn't want to open the door then what Mary's for the day rejecting the message because he was their voice the bridegroom the voice came and was calling and knocking and in loud Esha there is another voice that came in at the voice of the seventh angel voices coming in in the church it is not a managed christ-rejecting that voice man in anointing of deaf is there deaf in other word they opened the door God gives permission to the white horse rather the anointing of deaf we say go ahead and struck and by the bottom say deaf needs a total separation with God eternal separation but God the church is under Ichabod the individual must come out but come out before it's too late before the husband take off and then you'll be seeking for him he's not there you're gonna fall into the Tribulation Period and the watchman of the city will begin to abuse you and you gotta pay for it let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace father again for your love and for your mercy Lord we could have gone straight ahead with Malachi 4 but you stopped me and you want your children to understand that what speaks about you also speak about a slaughter father we were the bride when you were streaking on the side water came out followed by blood and a spirit showing Lord father that it was the birth of the bride because a bride was coming up that should be anointed we and you we are one just as a husband and a wife Lord father the purpose of this message was for that this featuring were lost to other ages Lord but you took a special message and you brought to us this way to prepare our heart so that the husband can come in and you can sup in and Lord Father fellowship with us Lord may you open the channels of each one in this church father Lord Jesus Christ time is gone this world is almost at the closing craziness is everywhere Ichabod is tracking the churches even in the message that people are departing from the faith father but don't let this church don't let the people fellowshiping under this roof Lord miss it Lord Father I pray you the God that filled each temple in the day of Pentecost you the God that feel every one that was in the house of Cornelius you the one that saved everyone that was in the house of Herod everybody that entered the house of wearables save everybody that came in the house of Cornelius will save everybody that was in the upper room will says father may Lord father we get favor in your sight that each one present here when they're on the telephone or whether who they are Lord father on streaming Lord may they open the heart so that the Lord who suddenly enter into you Lord might enter into each one us feeling and baptizing us with the Holy Spirit so that we might be candidate for your coming Lord not Lord father lingering but Lord forsaking our Lord not Lord giving excuses we have washed our feet we cannot defile them we cannot do this we cannot fast we cannot come to church we cannot dismiss this and this may we remove every excuses law like the woman was given
