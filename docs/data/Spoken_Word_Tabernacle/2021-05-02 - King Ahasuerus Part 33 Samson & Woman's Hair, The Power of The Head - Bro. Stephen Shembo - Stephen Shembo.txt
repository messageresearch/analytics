there is no need to gather but he gave us a promise where two or three are gathered in his name and that name is in the message of the hour then we know that he is here amen we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and good to see you all it's always a pleasure to be in church just few announcements before we go to the reading this morning i believe i'm not sure brother david have you been working on a theme yet not yet so just be patient a little bit we on part 33 or 34 something like that so for you to follow one two three four all the way to 34 you're gonna get lost so if you go on youtube once it's done you will see under the title there is a place that's a description if you click it it will tell you the theme in other words the main focus of that part so if you're looking for something maybe earring maybe high heel maybe panning maybe the black dog or whatever you want to see you just click on it and it's going to be easy to trace amen so just give him some time because it's like 33 sermon that they have to work on it at the end of the service if you would again please we just need 15 minutes of you just to organize everything as far as the whole meeting where we have question and answer we just want to structure that a little bit brother kelly will be handling that because he's under the deacon just to give instruction now we don't need only the sister we need everybody so just 15 minutes of your time all we want to do is just to organize it as far as how to set up things and how to break it down we will be working on having like five groups so when we say five groups it means that you have to do it only twice a year to the most three times but most of the time it's gonna be you're gonna be working only twice so if you do it on on january the next time you will be helping will be in june so you have four months to be free just come enjoy and when you finish you get in your car and you go amen so we try to take the burden the most the most that we can we pay for the food we pay for the tent if we have to rent a tent or anything we take care of it but we won't grab i mean i'll rob you from all the blessings we leave just the dessert and the setting up and the breaking down to you so if you want to gain some blessing from the lord just bring a lot of dessert just get in one of the group on one or twice a year you set up and you break it out then we share the blessing the church get the blessings by supporting the meal and everything and you also get the blessing and we share the burden but the financial burden on its all is completely on the church we don't want to put it on you because it's a spiritual thing we want it to be a blessing amen we're going to do this over and over and over and over until we get deep into certain things and teach you how to listen to the prophet amen because sometimes we put the tip and we get it like a slip pill you just put a tape and you go to sleep that's not the way you listen to the prophet you can do this all year and you will never get anything you might just get a little glance or something like that no you might just get the bible oh brother brother i'm saying we need to read the bible uh a chapter in the morning and in chapter nine you just get the bible and then glance it and you really don't get it you need to be in a certain atmosphere come when you read the scripture and you might be reading just one verse you learned that from your pastor right just one verse and you can hang on the entire day just circling on that one verse and that one verse will pull this one here pull this one here pull this one here then the word will be unfolded to you amen so we don't want you just to get on a routine this is not a religion this is a life it is not a routine we're going to listen to the tape you just go ahead put play and then you're thinking about something else no when you listen to the tape there could be something there if you just go calm maybe 20 minutes you might be able to stop that tip and when you get what you get in 20 minutes all is already overflowing you then you stop the tip you meditate on that you feed on that then you come back again and you click it and you start going on amen that way it's going to be a benefit versus a routine just go ahead and put in your mind is there you talking on the phone you don't even remember what's going on amen blessed be the name of the lord so just remember that only 15 minutes by god's quiz finally brother david sent some pictures for those who received the link if your phone is connected to the church you're going to see the picture of the progress of the church so lord's willing this coming week we're going to promise and start painting the inside completely they got the sheep rock completely finished it looks great so once we paint it we need volunteer people that are know how to paint don't want to do it praise the name of the lord you did if you don't know don't worry about it we'll find somebody we'll handle it i want to take off the burden as much as i can off from the church amen we want this to be a joy you're already contributing with your money every two weeks that's already a lot amen blessed be the name of the lord everybody happy i believe i got everything covered by the grace of god so let's go to the scripture i hope everybody is on board with the sermon how many listen to the sermon on wednesday amen blessed be the name of the lord i hate when i talk to somebody and they're like four weeks behind i'm wondering where are you amen and sometimes the things that the left are the very thing they're struggling with and here the lord already provided an answer but they just don't listen amen you cannot go five weeks without listening to what has been preaching in the church something is wrong amen you gotta stop your life and find out what is wrong amen you can miss a service or two and you catch up but if you miss the first sermon the second sermon the third sermon the fourth sermon and you coming on the sixth sermon what are you really gonna get amen what are you doing at home how do you budget your time i can give you a quote brother branham say we are prostituting our time how are you budgeting your time why do you have time to do everything else except stopping and listening to the word we put it on youtube you don't want to listen we bring you to church you don't want to come to church we put it on your iphone you don't want to do it so what else do you want me to do check the condition of your heart don't fool yourself because challenges are it's getting really hot it's getting really really hot i hope ministers in the message are catching it because you will reach a point where that religion won't hold anymore amen you're going to be tired of holding yourself up to live like a christian like a christian like a christian after a while you're going to blow up because you didn't have the real thing genesis chapter 1 verse 27 we preach we stop so you can go home you digest then we add it then we stop then you go home you judge us then we add so if you you miss six meal can you do six days without eating and you go a whole month without listening to a sermon how is your spiritual health under nourishment genesis chapter 1 verse 27 if you dare you can say amen this message you can take one scripture and just keep opening one scripture over and over and over and over you know just one scripture you think you preach about it then something pop up just for more idea verse 27 so god created man did the bible say he created a woman [Laughter] uh god sister don't worry you there did god created a woman you need to listen to brother branham very carefully so god created who man when i'm gonna go back in the scripture you're gonna see how paul says the same thing and you think brother branham was adamant when so god created man in his own water this man was created in the very image of god you might be seated so if you have never seen god you need to look at man when you see man you see god that's why when god came in flesh in the person of jesus christ he came as a man not a woman [Laughter] don't worry this world is under the influence of rome rome came to the united states and entering with the beast of revelation 13 and that beast is giving his anointing all over the world because everybody that her name are not written in the lamb's book of life must worship the beast so all that anointing is worldwide so whatever is happening in america now is happening everywhere if you look at my country the way uh people are singing they just copying everything the way american people are singing i can give you a video of somebody singing amazing grace in over in africa in my country they don't even know how to speak english but when they sing amazing grace you think she's an american and the main thing i'm trying to point to you is that that spirit of the principalities of america is dominating the world and that spirit is a woman dominating spirit do you hear me then what we're trying to do is to get you off of that spirit and i know what i'm fighting against i know so don't look at me as african look at me as message believer amen because it's very easy he's from africa that's why he's saying that if it's so then your prophet was an african [Laughter] hallelujah so god created man in his own image karma in the image of god created he water him but male and water male and female so you want to see the woman where are you going to see her [Laughter] male and female created heat water them hold on sister you'll be all right we're just putting everything back the picture the right way then you're going to see christ genesis 2 verse 18. you there and the lord god say it is not good that the whole the man should be water who say that do you think god just spoke it just like that he knew inside man it was double because when he created everything male female male female male female male female then he created man then he thought okay everything looked good okay man you go ahead and you handle everything then after a while he looked at him he said something is not good now the power of the woman comes okay there's a sister say amen amen and the lord said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helper meet for water so the woman is coming as a help you miss that you messed up your marriage a woman when she comes in your life she's coming for a help not to destroy you if a woman destroys you that's dela amen rahab hides the spices and when they try to destroy the spies rahab will protect the spies but delilah will not protect you she's going to expose you i wish the whole church was here this morning and those who miss make sure you get it amen hallelujah verse 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fire of the air and brought them to whom so this man had a name his name was who adam praise god adam amen to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof in other words when adam spoke god don't change it because adam was a son of god remember created in the image and the likeness of who amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 20. and adam gave name to our caddo and to the foul of the earth and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a water right here again help a help meet for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep not just asleep but that sleep must go deep into the deep a deep sleep in other words when he woke up under this anesthesia he didn't feel anything they got to put him in a good anesthetic because they have to perform a surgery so he can't feel it hallelujah oh my god and he slept under anesthesia and he took one of his water one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof so there was a surgery that was performed from the body of a man this man was put in a body and from that body god opened up and pulled a rib and that rib he made now the body of the woman from the river everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord and the rib which the lord has taken from man not the original product you follow me when god created adam he just spoke do you follow me and then something came up from the earth and stood up like this amen then god pick up the spirit of genesis 1 27 and put it inside adam then adam begin to move amen then he was a human being then he began to move but the woman was not there amen when god created the elephant god spoke and the elephant came up and he put the spirit when god created the file of the air everything the bible just said that he created them from the earth just like adam he formed men from the earth but when he created the woman he never picked up the earth the message is perfectly in line with the scripture you follow me when it comes to the woman he took something that he already worked with not a first product not a raw product from the earth but a product from the product which is called the by-product [Music] you understand now then from that by product he created a woman you want to refuse that you are rejecting the word of god just forget about the bible amen so he's getting a bright product then from that by product he's making a woman every single thing the file of the air the beast of the field everything was created straight from earth put it up earth put it up adam in genesis 2 7 from the dust off the ground look look let's go back i don't want you to say brother stephen genesis 2 7 and the lord god from who did he form a woman can you read your bible the lord god form who of the water now go to go go down to verse job two verse of uh the two verse 19 again and out of the water the lord god form water and water do you see that now so everything else was created just like adam pumped from the earth out up from the earth out up from the earth out when it come to the woman he never created her from the earth he took another product and pulled a woman everything that came straight from the ground do you follow me were strong vessels amen but because a woman was pulled from something that god already manufactured and he take the product that was already worked with and he worked the second time do you follow me that's why peter said that women are what not the spirit of the woman but the water there it is you follow me so when the serpent comes is he going to enter by the strong vessel oh well there is weakness you understand now is it complicated verse 22 and the read which the lord god taken from men made he a water a woman and brought her to her to the man and adam saying this is not water bones of my flesh the human body and flesh of my she shall be called a water his woman a name his woman a name so eve was created but eve didn't have a name how was god calling eve somebody called it hallelujah when man was created where was eve amen and god called this man who so when god called adam hallelujah hallelujah she shall be called water woman because she was water woman means water clear woman means taken out of men therefore shall men leave his father and his mother and shackling to his wife and and there shall be water why are there one flesh because at the beginning they were all ready anybody here go to genesis chapter 3 verse 8. now men have seen ever clear done something that was wrong but at this stage the woman existed and the man existed who committed the transgression first who did it he was a woman right then adam came and just condoned to what the woman said they have a deed everybody clear so now god is coming amen and god is dealing with two children one is his son by the name of adam and the second one is a woman so normally when you're calling your children you need to come and say hey adam adam woman woman adam adam woman woman where are you adam and woman come here let's see how god called it verse 8 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam clear and his water god married them the first marriage was performed by who that's why paul said it belonged to the house of dog you don't get married in downtown and you go leave together the marriage in downtown you still go back to your parent it is the marriage in the church that puts you together oh my god that was not in my list amen adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord among the trees of the garden anybody clear and the lord god called to adam and the woman he only called water so when god was calling he was saying adam adam where are down but when he say adam two people will appear amen if one did something wrong both of them hide not one hiding and one is out both of them heal themselves so they work like a unit you come one you call the other amen adam and said to him where are you everybody clear so far job to verse 20. and adam called his wife's name after sin then this vessel is called now eve over here no name amen and adam call his wife name eve because she was the mother of all water there is a mystery to that everybody cleared so far let's go to number chapter 30. where did the woman come from can you say it loud amen i hope nobody is sleeping you need this for your marriage amen i was praying last night casting that sleeping demon out and people coming to church sleeping except if you worked last night or something like that i understand but if you didn't work something is wrong amen because if we play a movie here you won't sleep number 30 verse one everybody clear and moses spoke to the heads of the trouble concerning the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord has commanded everybody clear i want you to follow me carefully i have to go with these things slowly then when he anchor into your soul we will never come back to deal with this again amen we rush with things in the message and we didn't catch it two if who if man can i check this one here if this person the male if men vow a vow anybody clear in other words if a man make a pledge that me i will be in church every day in the morning to do this if a man make a pledge or vow a vow to the lord or swear enough to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceed out of his water in other words once men swears something he cannot take it away from god why men can change why why amen man was created how [Music] when god speaks something does he take a break god is a man of his word that's why you keep hearing brother brother say we must be man of our word brother branham said before you speak you need to feed to seven times hallelujah verse 3 a fair who oh man there is no redemption no changes if a woman also vow a vow to the lord and burn herself by a bound being in her water now moses want to say something this is the lord talking to moses that if a woman is giving pledging something number one if she is in her father's house in other words if she is under her water remember on wednesday the head of the woman is who and the redhead of man is who and the head of christ is who and god encouraged her thank you love this church amen if a woman also vow a vow to the lord and burn herself by a bunch being in her father's house in her what when you're still younger you've not married it youth i can do my own thing amen and her father hears her vow and her bond wherewith she has burned her soul and her father shall hold his water in other words if daddy doesn't say nothing not the woman the man when he spoke taken finish but if a young woman and her father speak we still have to deal with somebody not the woman the father you follow me not you young sister daddy you can vow 20 000 things you want to the one who put a seal it's not you i can decide my own life let me pull you back to the bible amen may the holy spirit open your heart so you guys can receive it especially those that are missing now that's going to come later on amen and he shall hold his piece of hair then all her vows shall do what so if daddy doesn't say something it's automatically approved in other words daddy by keeping silence is consenting to her vow that's why you don't have to keep silence when you have to talk amen then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she shall bound her soul shall stand but if her daddy do what so daddy have a power to break or to approve a vow daddy is either a man or a woman that is still a water but if her father disallow her in the day that he hears not any of her vow or her bones wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall do what the forgiveness of her is coming through daddy you follow me see how we've been playing in the message see how we play the message amen because her father disallowed her when daddy break it even god forgive her but when a mature man speak no forgiveness you see how dangerous it is buddy you see now but benjamin you hooked amen and if she has verse six if she had at all a word first father number two who his husband a man or a woman why men men men and women still under either your head she please under daddy all your headship is under if her husband when she vowed or order anything out of her lips where if she burned her soul and her husband heard it this is hard in nowadays spirit upon women and he heard his piece of hair in the day that he heard it then her vow shall stand and her bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand but if her husband do what in other words the husband has the power to break a vow or to approve it this is not african this is the bible hallelujah and that which she added with her lips wherewith she burned her soul verse 8 of non-effect and the lord shall do what the forgiveness again is into the husband let me put it here forgive him a woman what if she's not married brother stephen and all the but the husband died or something what is she going to do you want to know verse 9 but every vowel of a water i can sit with you eight hours like this every vowel for water and we know is a woman that is married she has been married but she lost to her she lost the head she was married she left her parent daddy was no longer her head she went under the new head which is the husband now the husband is not the head you follow me but remember man the head of men is who and the head of the woman is who so when you destroy man by death what is the head that is staying the head of a man is who if a man vowed do we change his vow if the woman lost a man her head is becoming who so if she vow is she gonna be flip again let's see what the scriptures say but every vowel lord have mercy on me just this is taking time but every vowel of the water oh hey that is what divorce is separated from what widow and divorce means door-head no head what is this amen wherewith they have burned their soul shall do water there is no redemption because now she's vowing under who man was vowing under who when a woman vows she either far away here or there forgiveness when she go under this like a man locked what are you trying to preach today verse 13 every vowel and every bounding off to afflict the soul her husband may do what establish it or her husband may do what the man have a power to break it or to establish it let's go to isaiah 4 then we can pray just this you understand now the scripture clearly and you see what a deadly thing it is to fight your husband in marriage and i'm gonna show now a husband what is a problem with him toward his wife i wish you give me time and let's see what is going on it's gonna go both way now amen i don't know this is a difficult territory of the black dog isaiah fought you there and in that day brother branham said it's the center seven women's y7 shall take hold of how many men one man not seven men one man don't worry about polygamy i'm not there okay your pastor is not there i have one woman and that's it okay before somebody get yeah yeah we were looking for him on that one we heard from africa polygamy i know how to kill that demon so if you want to send somebody a link make sure you put everything i say because sometimes they cut links and they put something else they did it for brother branham i have a quote what branham said they are slicing tips and then connecting them to make me say something i didn't say when seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat your bread are you sleeping these women are independent women independent women they don't want to get under hardship hallelujah you follow me we want you but we will be responsible for ourselves [Applause] don't get in marriage like that you are breaking you are blocking god to bless you i wish the whole church was here buddy i wish i wish i wish we shall eat our own bread amen and wear our own work in other words you are not supposed to take responsibility of me i have a better job i can take care of myself you don't have to tell me what to wear and not what to wear but i still need you what do you need you already read between the line all right you're already ready between the line what if not stay under your father what do you need a man for that's right hallelujah and we're our own apparel only let us be called by welcome let me just get a covering so when people see me they also call me that i'm a married woman but truly inside our marriage i am independent you follow me this is the spirit in america and all over the world are you there i'm gonna be married to you i want your name i want when i'm going they say this is mrs so-and-so this is mr so-and-so but surely when we are in the marriage my paycheck belonged to me i decide on what to do with my money matter of fact when my work i ordered lunch i eat it i buy clothes when i wanted i don't have to ask you to buy clothes only when i go in public i want everybody to see that i have a husband where did you come from but she's rejecting that i didn't come for men where god already put a weakness on you you can act like you tough i seen the women that act the toughest the toughest when you go deep you're gonna see that they are under a lot of problem and those that you see soft sometimes are the toughest one in prayer and those that give you a ball i know i don't care i'm strong you're going to see her sobbing in the corner the husband just just do a little thing i thought you tough amen take let us be called by your name to take away our work we don't want to be saying single like this it doesn't look good the more we stay longer single people will begin to question us like why is this beautiful young woman all these years she doesn't get married how old are you 40 [Music] why did all these men pass and they never marry you so maybe something is wrong with you this is the way men operate are you there this is the way men operate so now you want to search for any kind of man just come just let mary get married to me but just know when we get married we have uh an agreement in this marriage okay you do your own thing i do my own thing but i don't want to look i mean everybody look at me strange it's in your bible in that day shall the branch of the lord be water beautiful and glorious that's the bread and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remains in water there is zion and jerusalem brother branham says zion is the brother jerusalem the the the remnant of jerusalem are the 144 000. so there is something going on during this period that's going to go with the broad then it goes to the 144 thousand we already explained to you a lot on that one amen in jerusalem shall be called water the same message that is touching the bread is the same message that is going to bring holiness to the hundred and forty four thousand they're receiving the same message amen even everyone that is written among the living in water the book of life everybody clear so far let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for everything that you have been doing for us lord we thank you for your presence and your anointing this morning father all i'm asking is that you give grace to open the eyes of your children to deliver them completely out of the god of this evil age that they might get under the headship of the world and reflect heaven on earth lord i rebuke every resentment spirit whether it's here or whether it's gonna come later down the road on the streaming on youtube if they are part of this church father break that spirit that they might receive this word and be free completely and reflect you exactly the way you intended them to reflect you i ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we're on part 33 amen on wednesday we touch on the headship of a man the headship of a woman because we were dealing under the spirit of jezebel which we touch on the spiritual aspect now we in jezebel in the natural aspect everybody clear now we enter the territory of the hair and it's easy to say just that it's not good for a woman to cut the hair but there was more to it when we begin to enter that you begin to realize that the hair of a woman is not just taking a scissor and picking up it is actually the action of taking a scissor and cutting your hair is is showing a spirit and that spirit goes more than just cutting the hair it's a rebellion spirit of jezebel anybody clear so far amen now when we begin to talk about the hair in ii king chapter 9 verse 30 the bible says that when jesus come to jezreel jezebel heard of it now you know what it means and she painted her face three things she tied her hair and she looked out to the window we are still dealing with the towering of the head and brother branham said that jezebel turing her head right there means what she was cutting her hair and roll it up so tying her head which is a disgrace why is brother brad i'm saying it's a disgrace a woman that cuts her hair dishonor her welcome husband if you under your father you dishonoring who the bible said so a dishonorable woman should be divorced or put away that is a son that she does what she loves somebody else according to the bible because she dishonor her husband when she does it if there is any man on planet earth sister that you need to honor and to respect is your husband a normal woman should never be at peace when somebody play with her husband a normal woman amen and a normal man should never be in peace when somebody is praying or joking or making fun of his wife amen so when you begin to dishonor your husband it shows automatically that you are looking at somebody else even though you are innocent and you don't know what you're doing everybody clear so far but that is the way god interpreted and that is wrong everybody clear now when we touch up on wednesday we spoke about the nazarite with the woman the first example that we took for nazareth was the example of samsung and the samsung is not a woman samsung is a man and we explained to you on wednesday that every characteristic that was given under number six was talking about a man because a woman by nature automatically have long hair it is the man that is not supposed to have long in the hair and once a man begin to wear long hair it is something that look awkward it is something that looks bizarre it is something that is peculiar it is something that is odd and that was put in the scripture as a son of a nazarite ever clear the sound of the nazareth man was put on their hair everybody cleared so far that sun was assembled of a consecration i want you to listen carefully he was a symbol of separation for a purpose in other words when someone was in nazareth and nazareth was somebody that was consecrated he was somebody that was separated for a specific purpose anybody clear so far georges chapter 13 verse 7 but he said unto me this is the mother of samson behold dasha conceive and bear a water not a woman and now and now drink no wine no strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a water a nazarite unto who the head of a man is who a nazi right unto god from the womb to the day of his water in other words the hair of samson have to remain long do you follow me from the womb do you follow me on the day of his death you follow me in other words the hair of samson must be consecrated his entire life on earth throughout your entire journey on the earth you must be another right unto the lord the bible never say that for something to be an azerite up to a certain spot all the way up which is the top of a woman showing that when a woman is born do you follow me she is automatically under consecration from her breath all the way to the death all the way to the rapture everybody following me paul in first corinth in galatians 1 verse 15 say but when he please god not men who did what separated me well from my mother's womb why from the womb of the mother it is a sign of predestination from my mother's womb and called me by his water that separation started before you were born god already elected you for something so when god sent you as a woman you know on a planet earth it is a signal that god already consecrated you for something as a woman if god sent you as a man it's a different story about here first corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 and 15 do not even water nature itself teach you and god is reflected in nature that is a water have long hair it is a water that's why samson look awkward you follow me but if a woman have water it is the water it is a glory to her for her hair is giving her for her water god give a woman help for covering why the hair was not giving for a covering for a man only for a woman why why not hallelujah number six he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die nazara because the consecration of his god is upon his water and the nazareth shall shave the head of his separation this is a man but not samson at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation he shall take the hell of his head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of a peace offering you made peace with god brother branham said now we found out in number the sixth chapter we explained this on wednesday that a nazarite called a nazaratco was to separate themselves from all the water the word to the word of god that is an azerite called separated we found out that samson was a nazarite unto the lord and he was separated from the he didn't finish by a what a sun that sound was way in a hair and this son was that he was to wear his his hair how with how many locks where did brother branham get seven locks brother branham says samson has seven locks everybody clear seven lops he was a son of separation that he was called for a water wisdom built herself a house you follow me and that house has how many penis seven pillars everybody clear and the prostitute in revelation 17 she sit upon seven water seven mountains ever clear now samsung the son of nazareth was not in the hand you follow me the son of nazareth was not at the leg the son of a nazareth was not on your torso the sound of the nazarite was not on your chest the sound of an azerite was not on the belly the sun of the nazareth was on the hell but the hair of samson which was the top of the church had seven locks so brother branham say where did you get seven locks brother branham you ready brother branham in charges 16 verse 13 and delilah say unto simpson hitler too that has mocked me and told me what the brother was already lying tell me where with that mother that mother's be bound and he said unto her if that we vest the water the seven locks off my water with the water so the hair of samson have how many locks are you following me do you follow me and the hair was upon the head you follow me and samsung was a judge do you get that do you get that let me start it again the word samson means son s-u-n you follow me you follow me clear and god took a man by the name of samson and took another vow and put upon the head of samson and the nazarite vow have seven rocks just like wisdom heads has how many pillars seven pillars do you follow me and that look was put under one of the judges of israel ever clear because samsung is in the book of the judges and samsung is one of the judges and the judges must have a hair that have seven different looks and we know that in sabino canyon do you follow me there was a hell that came down are you there and the head wave also seven rocks upon the head of who it is the rising of the the son have been risen with seven locks in his head showing that this time of the nazarite is back again on the world are you following me are you following me your cloud was in the bible all along it was seven angels and the seven angels made the cloud they made the wig of christ which is a top of the judge because the supreme judge because samson was a judge this message came from heaven this message is the truth this message is jesus christ this message is the word of god for this end time hallelujah who put that in the bible who put that in the bible the seventh chamberlain of the king the seven pillars of the wisdom who put all of that in the bible because seven locks was on the head seven locks on the head of christ which was showing you that the seventh tap the seven locks the seven angels are now come and the supreme judge is coming to destroy everybody here so far everybody here so far everybody clears so far brother branham said he was dissembled of authority and the symbol of power ever clear so far but there was a woman by the name of dilala all de la la was working was to find the power of samson the power of samsung laid in the nazareth volume that was connected to the seven locks and those locks must remain from his birth all the way to his death if you shave the locks if you remove the cloud do you see why your crazy website has been attacking the crowd it is the spirit of jezebel it is a spirit of delilah because they understood that the cloud that came on sunset mountain brought power to the bride so if they can remove the crowd if they can disprove the crowd that's why brother branham said the cloud of sunset mountain is proof that the message is the truth and they understood that if they can save the crowd away from the church hallelujah hallelujah de la la all that she wanted was to get the crowd out of the church and once the crowd is taken off the church that church is done once the seven lots are removed from simpson that's it they're gonna revive your old life you're going back to the high heel you're going back to the lips you're going back to the long nails you're going back to wearing pants those people are not doing that by any chance once you remove the cloud automatically that's the anointing that enters the church thank god for heaven spare you [Applause] thank god for having sparrows because some of you could be underpants already at this time but god elected you before the foundation of the world he will be very close that he will deceive the very elect if he was possible but the elect will never be deceived hallelujah that's why you stand here you stand by the grace of the supreme judge who loves you who care for you who protected you who watch over your predestination that's not my anointing hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord we found on wednesday samson a woman looking for your power to destroy you try first time try second time try third time and samsung still can get it what was in dirala that was holding samson everybody clear so far what was in dela that was holding samsung we know that paul and peter both of them spoke to us about two women the immoral woman ever clear and the good woman ever clear and the immoral woman brother brother says that she control the man by how many things the first thing is water her beauty which is the face the second thing is water by sex control the third thing is waters head shape which is formal and the two one i told you and i'm gonna prove to you this by brother branham that it's on the torso the chest are you there and it's also on the waist when you dress sister watch carefully what you do to your chest and what you do to your waist amen brother branham pointed these two and they tried to push for the belly but it didn't work because they tried to make a a pregnant woman sexy you remember you seen that all over but it still could not work because that was motherhood there's no way you can make a pregnant woman with a big belly sexy it didn't work because the prophet must stay true are you with me hallelujah now what a difference in this day in this day of conception instead of him being her what instead of man being the ruler either by being a husband or by being a father let's go slowly she has become his water sure she rules him contrary now you can probably well understand what i have been hitting it the message by her what by her water by her water now she was given by who this beauty is not the beauty god gives you it is a beauty given by satan which jezebel bring by the painting of the face the painting of the the eye all the stuff that we talk about which is artificial beauty ever clear and this sex control is not the normal way a man and a woman live in a marriage because we showed you that there are four categories of lust of love there is a feeling and a gap in love a feeling of love then a lustful love then a fearful of those two loves that's the one these women operate by are you there and the form of the shape i'm going to show you what he does by the high heel but it was given to deceive the sons of god but delilah did you notice she knowed that samson had the power and she didn't know where that power laid she could not tell what the power was but she was some great power that samson but there was some great power that samson possessed and she wanted to fund it and as delilah she kept doing water seducing samson after her water why is even the message consistent after her beauty oh she dresses herself in real water sex control when they tell you you look sexy it's not a compliment just know you're already out of the line are you there because you should not dress yourself to provoke a man we we're gonna show you on your dressing it's coming are you there and she walked before him and she t-heed like some of this leader teenagers of the day it was not a normal work a woman walk but she worked a certain way to bring attention have you seen what what do you call those stuff that women have women walk in front of men until they have to choose the the top one what do you call it models and do you see how those women work they walk a certain way and all the young people want to walk like that and when they walk they usually walk with water how many dresses do they have like with a bathing suit and men are sitting there taking pictures and all the young sisters will want to walk like that you don't understand that walk is made for a certain thing and if you watch the walk is already coupled with high heel why did they put high heels to work like that you're going to see it amen and i want and want to just act like something another i stripped is tying to who samson to her what was in that simpson a woman chaser sure a brother became became a woman chaser he was arrogant disobedient to his father and mother they told him not to go there they told him not to go down there with that woman come on that what so brother branham is identifying the spirit upon dilla as the same spirit that was upon who you understand now jezebel but he would not listen to them what was it samson had strength now listen samson was willing to submit his strength samson gave his strength to god but he gave his heart to her to a jezebel and malachi 4 comes to take the heart of the children back to work so i finally dela ended up understanding that if i can save the crowd because there is a message that has been brought there is a wisdom on the end time that god sent to protect his children against harlot hollowed spiritually and a lot naturally if i can remove the message of the hour if i can remove the crowd if i can remove that picture off of them then i'm gonna take them to prisoner when the hair was cut down do they stop there do you know what they did to samsung they punch his eyes go call your so-called brother call your old sister give them scripture after scripture if they're going to listen to you their eyes has been what are you there you can give them 10 scriptures they won't listen to you anymore because they never understood what's the delilah remove the message that spirit doesn't stop there it will punch your eyes out so you will not see the truth anymore and once they punch your eyes out they don't stop there they're gonna take you and put you in prison you become souls in water are you there did they stop there then samsung became an entertainment for the devil [Music] when you break the message when you break the atonement of this end time when you break the cloud when you remove it from a church the next step is a chaos you're going to be blinded spiritually you're going to go back into souls in prison that's why you're going to go back to worthiness begin to wear pants begin to cut your hair begin to put the makeup because you're already reflecting hell just like the women were reflecting hair on jessie penny and later on you become an entertainment for the devil when they want to laugh they call you they say come here this used to be message believer look at them now you see i told them a long time you people with long dresses look at her now she looks sexy look at her she's dressing with a man look at her she has a paint you become uh sporting for the devil bring that samson bring that woman bring that man that was a reproach for us at work every time we do something wrong at work he's going to just do this every time we do something wrong that sister will say this is not good look at her she start wearing pants come on here tell us now you're not a skirt girl anymore now you're a pet girl right now you look sexy look how you looking you become entertainment for the devil are you there a hair to a woman is a nazirite vowel hair to samson was a nazareth vow and when a woman cut off her hair she absolutely denied her water that she is a bride too hallelujah we're still okay because there that one thing she spoke the whole picture correctly a nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose is that right samsung was consecrated to a age and to a purpose therefore he had long hair the woman that is a child of god let her hair will do what to show that she is what to what remember the condition of the church is always reflected through the life of a woman if she cuts it off i don't care how much she does sing in a choir speaking tongue runs up and down or has all kinds of heads she is working sing is in the choir first that is the self the lord the word of god first corinthians 14 she has denied her nazi right vow and sold out to the god of this water you remove the cloud always cut the hair do you follow me when we were together all the men were cutting their hair the women were keeping the hair you follow me when the cloud was removed from the church are you following me certain women came out and they kept her hair but because the cloud was removed from the church the women that stay under that church what are they gonna do to the hair the cutting of the hair is a natural sign because the cloud spiritually was removed from the church our pentecostal women like that that's too bad that's too bad shame sister there is a letdown somewhere i hope it's not in a puppy yes it's in a pulpit remember what a woman is to be she's very sweet i was talking to someone today when rebecca came to meet her did you notice she fell her face they still do it they don't know what they're doing but the bride failed her face and they failed the cover and given to a woman his hair water thank you why the man is the head the nature of a woman is to yield to a man that is the reason the church should be there it's got a head that is water remember he goes spiritually and he dropped naturally the woman is supposed to wear long nail because of her who which is her he is to shave he is to have short hair because of who brother branham is saying because woman was john pull from a man woman must have a covering we're gonna go in the scripture you okay but man was not pulled from somebody man was actually made in the image and likeness of god in other words man automatically comes on the earth as a head reflecting the head god because head is reflecting head he must cut his hair relax i'm gonna get to that surgery okay just relax i don't want anybody bleeding you there because of christ the woman wear long hair because of what one is the angels the water is everybody awake a true messenger to the water let's stop here let's go back again the woman wearing long hair because of who according to brother branham brother branham said the reason why a woman is wearing long hair not only is she coming from men that's why she was called woman anybody clear but the second reason brother branham said because of angels and brother branham is defining angela's who we already put the foundation on wednesday now i want you to stay tight so we can navigate through this because of the engine and that gen ninja is a messenger on wednesday we showed you four stages anybody clear number one the head of everything is god you remember that on wednesday everybody remember that the head of every man is christ and the head of christ is god and god and christ are water and christ is the chief shepherd which is the top pastor a shepherd is a pastor everybody clear then when you drop down just like you're dropping down from divine love and you're going down to feel you when you drop down then after christ which is the chief pastor of the entire church the entire bread from genesis from ephesus all the way to laodicea that's why the head comes with the seven locks are you there showing that i'm missing my body are you there that cloud only have the hair but not the body because the body is on the earth the head is coming to connect with the body and then take the body with him so when you cut the hell off the church that body loses gps because the gps is the head the supreme intelligence are you there so now when you go to the church ages because there are seven locks seven church ages are you there every church age has a messenger and that messenger is also a pastor not to the bride but a pastor to his edge because it's a church age the church entirely is the blood of jesus christ the head is crushed but under the bread it is divided through seven locks you understand then the seven locks every locks is a church edge and that church have a pastor which is the messenger that's why the bible says right unto them unto the water unto the water right unto the word not to you the letter was to thee because he is the pastor everybody follow me state that then from there comes the word the local pastor anybody following me the local pastor must be under the messenger and that messenger must be under christ that's why paul said follow as a follower so we the christ paul the messenger then timothy then the believer all in line but our paul is brother pronoun are you there when you leave the local church then you go into your own family if you are married the head is your husband you understand the vow and if you are not married the head is your or your legal guardian amen some people father died mother died relax i don't want to say chill out anymore are you there there's three here this is a spiritual it's christ this is a natural man he's a human this pastor is a natural man just like me your husband is natural your father is natural ever here these three are called angels if you notice jesus christ is a man messenger a man pastor a man husband a man father a man that's why a woman should never be a pastor a woman should never be a husband to another woman everybody follow me for this for the man is not of the word you want to see that in the bible it's in the bible okay let me save time for the man is not of the word in other words man did not come from the woman remember genesis it was the woman that came from man this is paul speaking in corinthians when you go home go to first corinthian 11 you're going to see this for man is not of the woman but the woman is off what paul is perfectly lining up with genesis okay for this cause because brother bradham says because the woman was pulled from the men that's why she were recovering where did brother branham get to that where did brother brother get that brother branham is saying that oh no those are just message people the message believer why are you why do you wear long hair i wear long hair because message believer long uh away long hair i don't want those kind of answers in this church i don't want it in this church not in this church do you follow me when they ask you why do you wear long hair you say sit down take your bible the bible says the bible says the bible says that's why the prophet that god sent us in this age taught us that is not good for a woman to cut her hair he gathered from there no more because if you keep that conception that's why when they sway the message away from you cut your hair you cut your hair because you were never thought that that keeping your hair long it's not because just you grown up in the message but it's the word of god and the message is the word of god because it line up perfectly with the scripture okay now for this cause other woman which caused because woman was pulled from water for this cause ought to man a woman to have water power on her water that power doesn't means like a power coming up like this the word power means a sign on her what that's why brother branham say a woman is under the nasa right because the son of a nazarite was where you understand now power means it's a sign of authority because it's power it's a sign that she is under authority are you there that's why brother branham said when a woman cut her hair she's dishonoring her authority paul is saying because woman was pulled from a man she must wear a covering as a son that she is under power you follow me now do you follow me under power that power could be her husband oh daddy or a legal guardian i'm gonna show you that in the scripture for this cause ought a woman to have power son of authority on her water the sun in the head was an azerite sun okay because of the word if you watch the angels is plural not one and if you watch that angel have a little a not the angel of the lord you understand if they're many angels who are they the big one is christ the second one is what the third one is what your your fifth one is what and the other one corona vaccine any of you reading it first corinthians the 11th chapter and the 10th verse you can see the home if you notice power why of the angel of the angels first corinthians because the engine is the water i'm going slowly young sister get this pretty good because the angel is the man the water look it's a luna a again where angel with big a are concerned of heavenly it's a big a capital a where it's a leader a it is what in other words when it's capital a it's supernatural being you follow me when it's leader a it means human beings everybody following me that was the messenger the letter to the seven church ages written prophetically to the future paul wrote of the life and the glory of the seven church ages present in his day we are good with time john wrote off the life and the glory of the water the seven logs in the water that john was addressing the seven what why did brother branham call the messenger of the pastors do you understand you cannot be birthed without your messenger of the age brother branham say that the message of noah do you follow me could not be used in the time of moses if moses went to egypt and say we need to build a boat nobody will enter there the people in the town of moses had a specific gene and that dream has a message that can only decode it you can bring the message of noah they will be sleeping if you bring elijah they're sleeping if you bring uh uh adam they're sleeping once you bring moses moses have something in his ministry that can awake them are you there are you there the message of paul will not wake you up the message of luther could not wake you up you were born under your pastor it takes a certain messenger to crack your engine because that messenger is the one from which side you are pulled do you follow me that's why brother branham said the messenger and his message are water because when he is giving you the word he's actually buffing you out of him that's why paul say i am glad because you remember me in water they keep remembering their father whenever they go my daddy told me my daddy told me my daddy told me he was perf under the messenger hallelujah lord help me that was john addressing the seven pastors all messenger as directly all christians under this what different what you must be birthed under the message of your age you understand now that is the messenger everybody clear so far you okay let's go all right yo we are no more in the message now your pastor when he stand here underwater ministering the water not craziness because the messenger brought you the message the pastor must stay under that channel because it's about birthing pulling brides do you follow me we need the correct doctor the correct obgyn to pull the brad out hallelujah he is god's word you okay now people play with choosing church they play my friends are there i'm going there he is god's word to the water messenger to the water this is now local therefore a pastor are you awake if you come later sit quiet and listen call carefully therefore a pastor should water leave that water because it's birthing the sons of god in other words there is no room for error in the pulpit that's right because if the birth is wrong it produces a stillbirth they're in the message they're dead because they manipulate the word deceitfully a pastor should never leave the world but stay straight with the world because he is what the shepherd wants you are in the place of god that's why you take time [Music] normally everybody of you should take your thought and go to jesus and give it to him normally do you follow me every one of you should take your thought and go to god and say where are you this is my thought and god take it and eat it but because god is up there he put a representative that take the thought and give it to him when you give it to him don't look at him look at me that's why character secret because he's in the shepherd place because the word pastor means shepherd look it up and find out if dying right a pastor is a water and the holy ghost has made him water over a certain flock not international pastor to feed them what with it's about birthing sons of god anybody clear this is not about just an office i'm a pastor i'm a pastor i'm a pastor i'm going to start eating taste shame let no man despise that youth timothy but be that what a what because you're taking the place of god timothy remember when they see you they must see me they must see me you must be an example to the flock because you are representing who because as a man you are made in there and the likeness of who that's why there is no room for game be dying an example of the water in water in what not playing too much because when they're approaching you they want to hear what is god saying that's right they don't want to hear politics or foolishness in water in water in what and in what do you see what strict office the pastor is that's right amen people ask what is a pastor and i was told you can't preach because you're a candidate i was told i cannot preach that message and i heard that message god gave it to me and i still never preach it what is a pastor tila come give attendance in water and to what and to what this is where the pastor's head is and azeroth consecrated his life is different than you you can do a lot of stuff he can do because his mind he want to catch what is the mind of god neglect not the gift that is indeed which was given to thee by prophecy with the laying on hand of the presbytery meditate upon these things give that self how that that prophetic may appear to us because people are looking at you as a leader take heed unto the self unto the water that's why i don't play with the message continue in them for in doing this do that shall both do what i want to go to heaven too i won't stay here for you i must save myself and then does that work i want you me and you both of us together go to heaven [Applause] hallelujah in no things showing that self and what people in the example we don't understand let's see how brother branham was living because brother branham was crushed to us the pastor christ to you you crush to your family induction showing water gravity sincerity sun speech that cannot be water that he that is of a contrary part may be a shame having water everything everything clear okay you understand the messenger you understand the pastor let's drop down to the husband are you still in love let me watch the time yeah okay so the angels here are the water but repeat it again we just saw that the angels messenger we show them that they are pastors everybody clear now we are men if you notice brother palmer in it is in the leader letter remember the little a the angels and the bible goes ahead he's talking about the water and he's what now man become an angel man and wife meaning what husband become an angel buckle up see that is what the subject is that is the way people get so confused in the bible they say well god say one thing here and one no you get off the subject stay right on the same subject that's all he's talking about what men and what when we talk about a wife and a man that man is a husband hey but here if it's a husband are you awake get this let your women keep silence in water in churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be underwater keep that in mind you're going to see why paul say wife's wife submit to yourself obey your husband it is still the same word all over are you there as also says the law and if they will do what learn what can you read it loud again learn what anything not something anything let them ask their what where when was the last time your wife asks you a spiritual question you follow me online or you want a photo letter when was the last time your wife came with a spiritual question and give it to you honey i was reading something in the bible let me know what does it mean tell me the last time you who are you who are coming later to listen to this tale when was the last time they came to your husband when was the last time your son came to you to ask you a spiritual question when was the last time your daughter came to you and say i was reading the bible i didn't understand daddy what does he mean do you know why they don't ask you those questions do you know why because you yourself don't know the word you don't go to church you don't come to church you don't read the bible you don't study the word you don't consecrate yourself your family sees that they know that if you want to ask daddy ask daddy about politics you see men on the social media all they are posting is only about politics why what is going to give a woman what is going to give a child what is going to give a young man courage to ask you a question because they never seen you spiritual to begin with all you do sit about politics argue about politics argue about churches this church did this this church did this this church did this nothing spiritual and the scripture said woman go ask him how is she gonna ask you when was the last time they asked you a question young people young men do you see why you need to study the word you want to get married you want a fiancee are you able to guard a woman not to provide her sexual desire not to provide food anybody can do that anybody can give it to her if she doesn't have food she can go get a food stamp what about the spiritual aspect can you sit with a woman and tell him about the word of god you asking young men when was the last time you listened to a sermon full sermon they didn't listen you were a husband five sermons you didn't listen what are you going to guard that woman it is not really the system it is the people the brother that becomes sisi are you there then the woman automatically must compensate to do the work because she found out that you lacking you lazy you don't want to work that's why i must work go to work it's a problem it should be a pleasure for your wife to tell you god's sick for a job are you there it should be a pleasure for your husband to tell you cook now he's cooking the woman is working a complete opposite perfection i wish this whole church was here that's why the women say we don't need you we need you

this authority this position this responsibility whether the messenger whether the local pastor whether the husband whether the father whether the legal guardian are not giving for abuse the woman being under you doesn't mean that she is a dormant that's why you heard brother branham saying that if they give me the blood of jesus in my hand i wear one drop of the blood of jesus in my hand i will be so what careful with it brother branham say but the church has more value than the blood of jesus because jesus shed the blood for you in other words brother branham is saying that if i can respect one drop of the blood i must be more respectful to the church of the age because they are the wife of christ i am the head i am the head yes we showed you the head if you the head take responsibility it's not the head by word we don't want head by word and the woman is paying the bills you the head show us that to the head show me that to the head paul said husband do autumn and the wife do what him obey your husband if you this word this life is not complicated god take the key to your life and give it to you and we leave the key that god gave us and we search keys on books and amazon and keep reading books about how how can i make my marriage spicy how can i make my marriage sweet how can i make my marriage this and they say you go to a vacation go to this and you do that you do that and still that man is still hard-headed you don't understand because god gave you the key in your hand the the part that's going to follow maybe we're going to pick it up on wednesday i wish all of you were on wednesday do you follow me god say love your wife if you love your wife not love by word that love is a responsibility you take care of the bills you take care of the food you take care of this you take care of the you take care of that woman will put herself in neutral when somebody says something she said i have to wait and talk to my husband you don't have to tell her you must do everything by me you must do everything by me you don't have to do that do what god taught you to do if a woman feels loved [Applause] if a woman feels that her husband really loves her touch that husband touch that husband you're going to see that woman because when she look at husband she's remembering a lot of stuff [Applause] she's remembering that dinner she's remembering that surprise she's remembering that paycheck she's remembering that love she's remembering that intimate relationship when she goes through all of that her anger rises up and it bursts to the thermometer oh lord oh god oh god oh god it is not complicated it is not complicated you switch to another woman you heard to your own wife you put in your own graves you put in your own grave if a woman feels love she can do anything [Applause] [Music] when you just come you say honey god bless you you see with that over there i don't like it okay i'm sorry no argument no argument the argument is she pays the bills and you keep giving others and you don't do anything [Applause] this is the trouble in the marriages [Applause] oh my god i ask sometime sometimes i sit with married people i just ask i say let me ask you when was the last time you bought a perfume from here come from that work stop get in the mall get that perfume go under her couch put it under if she sleep what is this she pulled it watch her come down the stairs you're gonna hear her slowly thank you very much for the very sweet gift you gave it to me that's it that's it tomorrow at lunch time they call you they were they were not calling you at lunchtime you too busy last time you watch politics i don't know it's it's like a wire from heaven is keep pulling and i'm sorry i don't want to hold you too long it's a wire it's pulling me when i seen this my mind was just stopping like oh my god this is the key of mary write in the scripture for years and we struggle with it we read books books books books books books to make our marriage all right the book that your marriage needs is the [Applause] bible sorry let me go back to this somebody's just pulling ii corinthians 10 if you're there you can say amen oh my god oh my god can do three four months never bought your wife anything but you have first suit second suit third suit fourth suit fifth suit they look at your wife like this they look at you they look at your kids like this they look at you they should look at you like this and your wife like this then people understand that's the husband and when people see you they say who that's your wife wow a beautiful wife like this you heard it you heard them you see what i'm saying but you beautify yourself love thereof men shall be lover of them and your wife a man heads is to do everything first for his family as a dedication he preferred to wear the same clothes but don't touch his family you might play with him at work if he invites you to his home when you get to his home you respect him but if they see you good they see your wife a different to say look at this man first corinthians chapter 10 verse 8 not for abuse for though i should boast somewhat more of our welter authority of who paul i'm about to finish which the lord has given us paul said that the lord has given us authority i'm trying to put a balance here okay that authority came from who the headship of man christ man messenger pastor came from god and i can even drive this to the governor and even to your boss at work i seen that i just pulled back because it's going to open another channel i have it that's why paul said when you do work for your boss do it like unto the lord it's another aspect it's just this territory is like this and i pull back from there to remain focused the authority which the lord has given us for what what has the word edification means paul says that we from the from god we the messenger the minister we receive an authority that authority we receive is foreign it is to build up are you following me for edification karma and not for what i should not be what the authority the position of the head of the home the head of your wife the head of the church the head of the church ages was given to man to build up not to destroy that's right oh my god jump to second corinthians 12 verse 19 and i'm gonna finish you there again thank you that we excuse ourselves to you we speak before god in christ but we do what dear beloved for your work everything you do is to build up you cannot be the destroyer of your wife you cannot be the one that crushes your children you cannot be the one that crushes your son or your daughter you should be the one building them up how can somebody go to a church knowing that the pastor is going to be after us you don't want to go to church why did your wife don't want to go home early because she knows if she goes home she's going for abuse your children don't want to stay home because every time you stay there it's a problem you took the authority for destruction and not for the building up second corinthians 13 verse 10. you there therefore i write these things being absent less being present i should use what according to the what which who give me the lord has given me for what and not for what why is paul repeating that i have power for sharpness but still when i'm bringing that razor it's not to destroy i am removing sin i'm removing bad behavior but i'm not there to kill you oh my god first timothy chapter 1 first timothy chapter 1 verse 3. you there as i besought you to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine neither give hate to fable an endless genealogy which ministers water rather than godly water which is in water or everything you do for edification i can get through the gift paul say even the gift even the song everything that is done in the church it's always to build up the five four ministry out for the water edifica always it's to build up go to first peter chapter one oh god first peter chapter 1 verse 1 hallelujah job 12 down to verse 2. you know what let me save time go to ephesian go to ephesians chapter five and then we finish here because i don't want to get tired because you're gonna miss what i'm trying to say i'd rather wait till you fresh and bring it back up let me skip this because we're going to come back to husband and wife later and show that position let's skip that one go to ephesians 6. children obey your water parent in there you see that you're doing that in the lord you follow me now when you're obeying that because you just need to obey in the lord are you there for this is a few people children this is i know your father and which is the first commandment we've promised that he may be well with you and you may live long on the earth watch verse 4 this authority is not for abuse and you what he didn't say matters you follow me you see that order he didn't say matters and you fathers provoke not your water in other words your authority is not to abuse your kids don't push your children to the way that they're now reacting back to you because you are abusing the authority provoke not your children to rough but bring them up in the water and water servant be obedient to them that are your what according to the with what and what and singingness of what as to who let me stop there god put authority christ from christ the messenger the messenger the pastor the pastor the husband if you married or pop daddy if you under your father or the legal guardian if you lost one of your uh a parent but that authority you who are under those authority those positions it is not for abused it is to build up husband respect love your wife wife respect you if everybody do just what they do because i'm gonna show you where peter said that your prayer should not be what brother kelly hindered that's why you are left your wife is left and you praying to god and nothing happened to your marriage because your prayer has been hindered and you think it's a demon somewhere or something somewhere and you keep doing something something there is a little tiny key that the devil is just drinking juice say let them keep doing it but the grace and the mercy came to unfold you that it is not complicated the message is not complicated your life is not complicated it is just as easy as to follow god order i'm a woman i'm going to stay in my woman abraham chase ismail no that's my son no problem god bless you she goes to sleep who came who came god came say abraham what sarah told you do it just like i did did abraham argue was sarah there like dela you must do what i'm telling you you must give me this car you must give me this car you must give me this car somebody else says so and so have a brand new car i'm the one driving their own car do you see because there are women that are restless if somebody does something she wants to do when somebody does something she goes she is always on the look like to be who is doing something restless and the marriage and the man is there before you know it the boy is having blood pressure i know what i'm talking about i know what i'm talking about never satisfied because she got married to the outside how can you be married you have 15 000 friends on facebook a married woman huh how let's stand how who are you going to satisfy who are you going to satisfy you are now happy when you go out you satisfy those that never seen you you don't care about the husband and the poor boys is taking pills because he's afraid of the judge because the land is going to push you tigerwood wife divorce huh try and you will see how easy it is try try try because i have a scripture that tells you you're going to commit adultery you see where you are the keys are easy let's put our lives back to the order let's put our family in order let's put our wife in order remember who's the head the head is to edify to build up that woman is a help she's there as a help god so that it was not good for you to be the way you are that's why he gave you a woman god gave you as a husband as a head even if you think he's stupid if you line up with the word you will find out that he is more smarter than you in certain things and he's going to lead you because when you take the lead i'm going to show you what brother branham said when a woman take the lead you want to see what he's going to do he might feel in the eyes of men that you are progressing progressing progressing progress progressing as it matters taking over getting their children married married today the marriage are in trouble she thought she was the one doing i got this married i got this mother i got this going i got this going trouble trouble trouble not suffering back again backfire too late they already married you taught you took everything under control you cannot you are not built for it what you see up there is perversion let's go back under the headship of the word heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father this is a heart searching sermon but it's nothing but a blessing and delivering scent in a simple way to deliver your children and take everything the devil has been holding their lives and their marriages for years troubling them where they thought it was maybe some major thing or they made a bad decision to marry this man or this woman while it was not that it was just the devil that played through the ignorance lord father to destroy their marriage to destroys the family to destroy the relationship between the fathers and their children between the husband and the wife between the deacons and the congregation between the pastor and the congregation because between the congregation themselves together until we don't trust one another and we don't even know who to trust who to share the burden who to speak with because these things has been lacking and missed in your church but father i have done all that i can do as a man under my office lord but lord father we all under you who is the great head the great shepherd may you come down father and give grace and sufficient power lord to help your children line up with your word and father there is going to be the blessings coming from heaven lord we thank you for them accepting to go a little bit extra mile with a sacrifice to let me reach those scriptures father may you bless them for lord father opening that channel lord jesus christ because it's a sacrifice unto them to sit lord father in such lord we are committing everything continue to minister unto us lord and those that have missed may you be merciful to shake the families lord that they realize quickly that this is what they need the best ingredient they need for their marriages is the word of god versus what they're trying to do because later on it might feel like what they're doing is working but it's the deception of the devil because two three years down the road they're gonna find out that they're in a mess and they need to come back and we we consecrated their life father may you be merciful and open their eyes lord by a spiritual understanding and give them the desire of the heart as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus
