the building fund i believe it's today right by the micah yes sir thank you very much if we would let's go straight to the scripture how many listen to the sermon on wednesday i hope nobody is behind is everybody on page if you're behind it's not my fault it's on youtube amen you had wednesday thursday friday saturday to catch up if you didn't so you know exactly what you're doing amen we have not we don't have sunday school yet because we need to work on that extension back there and we don't have sunday night service so you only have one service so let's unload this cargo amen whoever needs supplier i believe supplier was already been given amen if you need to be reboot the deacon are back there amen so stay tight let's unload this cargo amen few people say amen amen don't worry it's coming amen psalm chapter 130 125 i'm looking at 30. oh praise god amen i don't know why i keep looking on the right side brother john [Laughter] 125. so we stop in the middle of the mix mounted right now we're going to pick it up remember last sunday we spoke about the those that were separated as sheep and goat we started with the vessels of mercy which is the bride of jesus christ then from the vessels of mercy we move to the second step those that are not part of the blood amen they are even not believers amen they were just goat as goat amen but they have been good to the brother and because of that they enter into eternal life no one the brother branham said there will be surprise in heaven defeat the people you thought they're not gonna make it you're gonna see them making it there and some of them that you think are gonna make it will be searching for them and can find them they will be in the lake of fire amen now we move to the third stage where we have people not from outside but within the camp a mixed multitude right okay praise god psalm 125 verse 3 for the lord of the wicked this man is weakened shall not rest upon the lord of the righteous you might be seated so we have two people here again there is one bad which is a wicked the lord of the wicked and the just ever clear so the bible says that the lord of the wicked will not rest on the lord of the just why why for the road of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth his head their hands to water inequity so god need to separate the two amen because the longer the wicked the wrong seed abide in the camp it would tempt the righteous to touch what they are not supposed to touch amen the mixed quantities went up together and they caused the israel to disgust the manner amen so god have to remove that part amen because it begin to cause a trouble or it has become a stumbling block to the true seed of god amen so the lord the road of the wicked shall not stay in the property of the just because they just will be tempted to touch in things that they are not supposed to touch because it's within their vicinity it is around the reaching area amen the more you put an internet you put an internet you put it in it they just can sometimes slip up so they got to remove it amen let's go to act chapter 20. hallelujah so there is a mixed multitude but they need to be removed amen the preaching of the message is not motivational speech the preaching of the message it is not a motivational speech on tick-tock hallelujah the minister has been preaching motivational speeches to make people happy they tell you okay you're gonna be fine you go home and fall again you go home and fall again because the appropriate food is not distributed no matter how bizarre no matter how old the message look like that is the prescription you need the serpent's seed why did god bring those mysteries if it was not necessary it is because the exactly motivational speeches begin to long for those speeches on tick-tock they want to listen to a motivational spirit uh a speaker that's going to boost their their their their energy their ego if you want to know who you are you need the message of the hour [Music] [Applause] the message has been predestinated to declare your true identity you don't need motivational speaking and mixed multitude in the camper act chapter 20 verse 28 take heed therefore to yourself and to all the flock over the witch the holy ghost has made you overseer to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood that church doesn't belong to you it is the church of the living god amen for i know this that after my departing shall who but when you look at them they're not gonna look like wolves grievous wolf enter in among you not sparing the water this kind is coming from outside do you feel me they were not inside they are entering in amen watch the second one verse 30. also second part of your own self among the group that you talk to a message believer [Music] those that you thought we believe the same thing we have been in church for years among those among your own self shall men arise speaking water they have the power of perversion the devil amen perverse things to draw away disciple after water the reason why they are perversing things which thinks are they pervading because a perversion is you must have the original first and then you take from the original and you pervert the original to take somebody away from the original and bring people disciple after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn you one night every night and day with water this apostle was crying why and now brethren i commend you to god the spirit and to the word of his water the capstone when it's coming down it's crying water i commend you to the message of your hour amen which is about to do what to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are water what else do you need on tick-tock the garlic from egypt let's go to roman chapter seven two people one from within and the seed of god is right there a mixed multitude yet the mystery are supposed to clean you up to make you white and to do what to try you you remember on wednesday romans 7 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah amen no you not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives in other words he has control verse two for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law brother kelly to her husband so long as he leaves but if the husband be water so sometimes it's good [Music] it depends on which species is the husband [Music] so god have to free somebody put your belt on put your belt on if i get to where i'm going you're gonna see amen so while her oh oh my god where am i but if the husband be dead she that woman that church is loosed from the law of her water so that separation is necessary they were together but a separation must happen to save to preserve somebody to rescue somebody by separation because the righteous cannot stand with the wicked too long they're going to cause trouble in the camp [Music] amen so then if while her husband is love her husband leaves i'm sorry she has been married to another she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is water free from that law so that she's not adulterous does she be married to another man better than the first one wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to who who is raised from the dead to christ to unite you with christ that we should bring forth fruit to hope that you should bring forth the children of god the offspring of god so that you can be pregnanted by the word and produce the word because your first husband is a trouble death have to strike let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father humbly because we're in the presence of the great and mighty god that knows everything and i do everything lord father we thank you for your grace your love and your mercy and for giving us again this opportunity to gather together around the revealed world of the hour father we are committing everything and this service onto the hand lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children minister unto them and deliver them completely lord father from everything that has been bordering them and besetting them for years lord father we ask lord that's the angel of the lord only be inside this church may every spirit every demon because your prophet told us lord father last week that in the places in the in the auditorium the devil hang around there but he also told us that in the church the spirit and the angel hang around there father due to your presence the presence of the holy angel of god the elect angel of god there should be no coronavirus standing in this building father we rebuke that demonic spirit whether it's delta or epsilon or whatever it is father we rebuke it from this place in the name of jesus christ may you come lord father and minister to your children and lord father take a full preeminence of each one of us and the parking lot outside lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you already been seated i hope everybody's tuned in since last wednesday we on part six we're dealing with the second death origin four on wednesday was origin three in other words we're dealing with predestination blessed be the name of the lord on wednesday we were continuing with the spiritual man which was the second death and the second death is the lake of fire the bible says death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death if you notice here the one that are casting the lake of fire is death and the grave that is something that is not good nobody wanted death and nobody wanted the grave amen in revelation 21 verse 8 the bible says but they're fearful the coward the one who don't want to take position for the word the one who want to keep good relationship with people despite the word of god and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers and the whole mongers and the sorcerers and idolaters and all liars in other words everything that is bad death is bad the grave is bad and everything that is bad where are they going shall have their part or their time in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second one so according to those two scriptures we found out that everything that we know we look we know clearly that look bad is gonna be destroyed in the lake of fire which is the second death but now we are approaching something different which is something that you don't look good but that one also need to go in the lake of fire anybody here the bible says that there is one lawgiver who is able to do it to save and to do what and we explain to you that by serving he's a lamb hallelujah by serving by salvation he is a lamb amen and then by the destruction he is leo the lion because he is coming to destroy but to the bride of jesus christ leo the lion is not leo as you think it is leo that come to slay somebody else to deliver you amen he's not bringing you to judgment because the bible says whoever believes on the lord jesus christ shall never come again to judgment but he have passed from death onto what you're going to be the one judging but you're not gonna be judged because you already been judged in christ when he died at the cross everybody clear he said who is able to save and to destroy who are that that judges another in jude chapter 3 this is where we started in the book of jude i'm gonna skip one and two the bible says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation we explain you this on wednesday he was needful for me to write unto you and to exalt you that you should earnestly contend for water the faith in other words the faith was already in danger why in danger because grievous wolf are already entering the ship everybody clear but thank god in the end time god already prepared malachi 4. so when you think that all the faith has been destroyed i shall restore say the lord amen malachi 4 stood there when the devil played play play play play when he reached malachi 4 the prophet look at him and say boo [Laughter] amen which was once delivered unto the saint for there are certain men crept in anyways you were not aware of them who were before of old ordained or predestinated to utter so it's not only the sorcerer the whole monger the prostitute the liar that had been predestinated to be destroyed in the lake of fire it is also people that believe this message hallelujah ungodly man turning water the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ where i will therefore put you in remembrance don't ye once knew this how that the lord this is where we are because if we finish this side then we're gonna get the angel which left the first estate in the book of jude when we finish that then we get into sodom and gomorrah and you're going to see what's going on with the lake of fire the bible says i will therefore put you in remembrance do you want to know this how that the lord having deal on what having saved he was a lamb that's why they have to kill a lamb and eat the lamb and put the blood of the lamb on the lentil because he came as a lamb amen he want to pull them completely out of egypt but he having saved the people out of the land of egypt after all destroyed them that believe what because on wednesday we saw that not everybody have faith they can be among you and pretend to believe the message but they truly don't believe the message because there is nothing in them to decode the message brother branham said that if the devil would have taken something that was in the seventh seal he would have done great damage anybody here but the seventh seal has been opened we have it in tips we have it in books so the devil can take that and read it and cause damage no because a mystery is a divine truth that was hidden before and even though it is open brother branham said there is still a supernatural element despite the revelation if you are not predestinated to this message you can gain intellectual knowledge but the supernatural element will never be given to you it has been predestinated only to the royal seed of abraham it is a supernatural being that's gonna decode the message and make the child of god understand the message more clear than before hallelujah hallelujah that's why they told john the book is in the hand of the angel you must go where the angel is the angel the supernatural element have to give you the book not a preacher the angel himself class himself not mama not daddy it must be a personal revelation between you and the angel give me the book give me the book the angel must give you the book yourself not the pastor not the deacon not even brother branham the angel himself hallelujah where did you get your book who gave you the message if a man gave you this message and man can take the message away but if god gave you the message nobody can take the message away [Applause] hallelujah i didn't receive this message from men i receive it from god and nobody can take it away from me it belongs to me [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord my god he said having served the people out of the land of egypt after all destroyed them that believe not because they didn't have the love of the truth who was destroyed not everybody there are some people that cannot be destroyed i am one of them [Applause] [Music] hallelujah the bible say and the children of israel journey from ramses to sukkot about 600 000 on foot there were men beside children amen they mixed multitude went up also with them hallelujah and the mixed multitude that was among them fell everlasting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat the one who started the problem was a mixed multitude amen we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely on internet on tick tock on facebook they coco the cucumber and the melt the cucumber and the melon and the leek and the onion on walmart and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this water not even beside manda but besides this manner disgusting at the first time when the manner was coming everybody was happy but because of the mixed malted the manner became something like nothing this manner we begin to compare the mana with the garlic with the lick with the onion before our eyes we discovered this on wednesday now we continue your father did eat manna in the wilderness so in the wilderness buff the wicked the mixed multitude ever clear they're mixed multitude they mix multitude which are the wicked that are covered in sheep clothing in matthew you can read that everybody clear buff the wicked and they just both ate the same thing they all eat manna but what happened when they ate manna your father did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead how can you eat man and die this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father did eat manna and are dead he the 18th of this bread shall live forever so brother branham what happened with this death they say our father eat manna in the wilderness for 40 years he said and they are everyone dead so when the disciples of jesus christ were going with jesus christ they met the pharisee the people that were in the law of moses and they begin to brag they begin to identify with the father that were in the wilderness that's why when jesus checked them he said you are of your father the devil because those that died were the children of the devil ever here they were bragging they said they were part of the group of god they were part of the message of god they also followed the prophet what do you want to say jesus look and say yes they were in the message but they were dead hallelujah dead brother branham say take that word then run it see what it means it means what so their death was not only natural but they also died spiritually forever never to be reconciled with god when the just dies he's waiting for the resurrection when the resurrection comes he's gonna rise again and he's gonna meet the lord but these will never meet the lord again they're gonna meet him on the white throne judgment as a lionel everybody yet they were water these are not sinners remember on last sunday there was an egyptian not a hebrew among an amalekite and god came and rescued the egyptian but these are pure jews but they are not jews by birth they are jews by passport they are jews by blood they are jews by id dwarven assets they are jews but by spiritual gene they are not jews they were abraham's seed death means separation inhalation completely water inhalation jesus said they were dead every one of them yet they were wet how can a circumcised judea amen how can you eat manna and die let me see somebody who ate manna and what happened to them the bible says that in deuteronomy chapter 34 the bible says this that moses was what was he a young man a very old man moses was 120 years old when he died but when they put moses when they look at him at his death they thought they're going to see somebody who's laying like this hallelujah when he died his eyes was not water he was 120 years old but his eyes was clear 2020. what kept his eyes alive hallelujah what kept it when he dies his eyes was not dim know his natural force what what was renewing the force of death of of moses are you there when they look at moses at his death he's dead but he's dying like this 120 years what kept his strength what kept his health somebody else ate manna and died but when manna entered moses he kept moses stronger what is the result of the message in your life [Music] the more you eat the message are you getting weaker or are you getting more stronger [Music] amen hallelujah joshua chapter 14 verse 10 behold the lord has kept me alive do you know who's talking his name is caleb when they enter the promised land before they enter the promised land they send them spies 12. 10 of them came with a bad report god killed all of them and they said only to joshua and caleb everybody then god gave caleb an inheritance remember the word that can give you an inheritance amen then caleb enter in the promised land and sat down and never cared about this inheritance when he was 40 years old he didn't pay attention he waited when he is old how can an old man fight amen you taught caleb when he was coming to joshua he had the king joshua let me see what's going on caleb let me know now behold the lord has kept me alive as he said this 45 years so he's not an old man i mean a young man even since the lord speak this word unto who he was with moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day today i am welcome a score is 20 years so full score is what 80 years i am full score and water what do you want you 85 years old why you didn't come when you were 50. hallelujah verse 11 as yet i am as what this day as i was in the day that what [Music] what kept the strength of caliber what kind of diet did caleb eat that kept him strong at 85 years old as he was on 40 years old so joshua was sitting in his uh his living room he read boom boom boom boom he didn't hear they say who's there he said that must be caliber he said open the door then look at 95 years old he was not walking like this he was coming like this joshua you say oh my god kelly what's wrong again what do you want he said i'm 85 years old i am still so i'm ready to fight 85 years old what gave him strength mama was doing supernatural stuff in others but in others he killed them [Music] hallelujah as my staff was dead even so my strength is what my strength for whatever 85 years old want to go to arrow this is not something you shoot from far off this is a wall you are in a jewel with somebody 85 years old you're going to see him go in the nursing home go see an 85 years older [Applause] hallelujah i am strength now for war both to do what and do do what now therefore give me this water another way joshua i won't die if what god spoke in my life is not happened yet [Music] what god promised me i must have it even if i'm 85 years old i need my children safe i need my family safe i need my health back i am not gonna give up give me my mountain give me my children give me my wife give me my father give me my money hallelujah hallelujah mama manna gave caleb the power to hold on the word of god and can't let it go he gave him power to take god at his word with a bulldog face in other words the death you hold on until what he said is finished and death said yes sir [Music] remember apostle paul they told him he must appear over there no matter what the member is there it's not going to do nothing give me my mountain where of the lord speaking that day for that eldest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord did what manna did something to moses manna did something to caleb manna was angel food elijah was given two angels meal he was tired he run from jezebel he fell asleep they gave him the first meal from angel he ate he went to sleep they woke him up again the journey is wrong woke up he woke up they gave him food from an angel what did that angel food do to elijah first king chapter 19 and elijah he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of water which how many days and what they gave him two meals and he walked 40 days without eating and he kept moving what did manna do to the body of moses what did manna do in the body of caliber what did manna do in the body of elijah he have the power of transformation he have the power to kick the black dog off your body he have the power to death to slow death down [Music] when mama entered the body manna went into depth and say which speed were you running 85 put 25 [Music] they're growing older but they're still stronger hallelujah they grow older they're still strong because something is blocking death from uh from from from moving on faster that's why david said he renew our strength like ego they look at you 50 years old you look like you're 25 what is blocking your chin it depends on what you eat but somebody ate the same food and he killed them [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah the more you stay in the message the weaker you became something is wrong something is wrong the bible says in the book of acts chapter 13 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole the whole city together to heal water power preached and what power preached touched the people so on the next sabbath not only the people that preached came but the entire city of gastonia came so if the entire city come to receive the word of god we all should be happy right if you're sleeping you can wake up over there you can stand over there can't be sleeping amen amen so the entire city is there to hear what we ready what happened but wonder who not the gentleman not the sinner when the jews the religious one here show the world the more interested in the crowd when they see you with a church that begin to grow when the jews saw the multitude they were filled with water jealousy how can you be jealous when people are coming to get the word of god why you didn't preach what paul preached so you can get the same benefit [Music] everybody when they are filled with envy and speak against what which was spoken by what contradicting and doing what they saw that power brought a different gospel and that gospel began to touch the life of the people and they move with jealousy and begin to speak against the world the mysteries that paul was preaching they begin to tell the people how he's preaching there is just mysteries mysteries he's just preaching intellectual they begin to speak against the message that paul was preaching everybody then paul and barnabas was bold and say it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to who you are the one that was supposed to preach this message why you didn't do it we begin to preach it you get jealous what does it mean but saying he put it from you you there and judge yourself what of what rejecting the message of power was rejecting everlasting life attacking the message of the hour i'm not talking about the people outside the people inside the message you are judging yourself and worthy of the message somebody preached that 70 weeks of daniel you don't want it somebody preached the seventh color of the rainbow you don't want it revelation 4 revelation 3 adoption hebrew one hebrew two all of that you don't want people to preach that you want to give the people a social gospel and when they begin to preach to preach to preach and you begin to bring effect in the life of the people people get jealous and begin to speak against it they are judging themselves and worthy of eternal life hallelujah lo we turn to the water so since you don't want it there's no eternal life for you let's turn into somebody else who did it jews hallelujah where are we heading brother branham as soon as they get over there they begin to complain they only been out in the desert they begin to say oh if i had some water if i had some they were out there and had substituted anxious food for what and was what why [Music] why was the manner strengthening somebody but he was killing somebody else he depend on your tummy not natural tommy but spiritual tummy because the bible said john come take the book and do what and it's gonna be what sweet in your mouth but what there was not this belly it was another belly the belly of the heart because men shall not live by bread alone but by every water that word is going to the heart it depends on what was in the heart [Music] why they're telling the gastronomic was not able to water digest the water they were not programmed for the message of the hour [Music] when together you killed them hallelujah they don't hold on they go on they go back just the first little thing rise up complain first stew a church that get one of them things started it's like a water that's why the surgeon knife have to come to begin to cut that cancer out and give you even some chemo are you there he shall kill the whole church that's right we ought to get started and get it out now when there was not going very far eating angels food come down from heaven and was complaining and they were drinking a water from water the water holy waters of life and was water they wanted the muddy water of water from tick-tock from jimmy schwagert from pd jets from john austin something that is more philosophical and makes sense hallelujah a mixed multitude the phenomena had been done a big revival was on people were getting saved coming in and a group went up impersonating that they went up acting like they were water sure they put on their sandals and everything and got ready but the same mixed multitude that taken communion and went on the march was the very one that began to do water and caused the children of heart of israel their heart to turn back to water that is what it is tonight brother have a revival and there will be a water certain as anything some of them will try to come in impersonating when you talk of what it depends on where they come from from there hallelujah the strange thing there was a mixed melted eating the same manner people who are water who does not accept the lord jesus christ can still enjoy seeing the moving of the miracle of god healing the sick can rejoice in the people doing right can open their heart and rejoice in a sermon that preach under the anointing that is the same type of manna that the christian is what same manner it's killing one it is giving strength to the other if you notice what caused this trouble there was a mixed multitude went up with them the supernatural has been done down in egypt and when the supernatural has been done everybody flocked to it it caused a mixed multitude to go with them are regenerated and converted heart growing up trying to impersonate the water they're never worried will be a believer to begin with [Music] they were with you but they were not believers they can tell you what moses said but in their heart they didn't believe what moses says that's why jesus said if you have believed moses you should believe me because moses prepared me but because you miss that preparation there is no way you can get me [Music] hallelujah and it's then the day of noah it was in that in in that in the days of jesus it's prophesied in god's word for to be the same thing in this day the supernatural has been done and there is a mixed multitude gone up and he regenerated hearts not conditioned not keeping god's word but impersonating something amen that's why the slightest opportunity that happened day out because they never believed it to begin with they were having long chests but they never believed the message amen we found out that the exodus meant they're calling out god separating his people from the unbeliever and then along we found out in the scripture that there was a mixed multitude that went up and that is what got the real believer in water because he was a mixed multitude there was the one who melted their earring and saw fort and made the water so not everybody was responsible for the golden calf he was the mixed malted that created the golden calf here to go back to egypt when the phenomenon is done the miracle of god was performed and everybody really to it and then a mixed multitude followed out because they were going they were circumcised and kept the passover and so forth but still they were a water unbelievers with the unbeliever to the word of the hour yet among you amen amen a mixed multitude went out a mixed group of people some of them believers some pretending to believe people went out as professed believers and there was not believers that is where a great bunch of trouble is today we could put our fingers on him is men and women who come into church and profess to be believers of this message and they are not believers i have found it in the world preacher that professed to believe brother brother but then don't believe the message of brother branham give them the word and look how they react tell them brother branham say this you're going to hear somebody telling you we are not in the days of brother branham yet preaching the message hallelujah i have found it in the pulpit i have found it in a prayer line i have found it where where men come in and women who say i'm a believer and profess to be a believer and they are not believer a mixed multitude hallelujah what's going on if you look at this situation you will think like god fell god did nothing god will keep those that belong to him and we leave lucifer what belonged to lucifer when jesus was dying at the cross there was one that belonged to him jesus picked him up to paradise but the other one needed a cargo they needed also l.l a means of transportation do you know what happened to them judah said yes i am the cargo judah went and hanged himself in order to pick up the other one and to take him also down there one transporting one the other transporting the other i have lost nobody nothing except the what the son of perdition the son of hell he doesn't belong to me that's not my child god seek his father this is my child give me my child hallelujah transportation not as though the word of god has taken non-effect when you see these things it doesn't mean that the word of god is not effective why are people living why some can't stand it anymore god have not lost his power the key is this [Music] the key is this hallelujah for they are not all which are of what we are not talking about the world and israel we're talking about israel within israel israel naturally and israel spiritually you can be in the natural israel but you are not in the spiritual israel you can be naturally in the message but you are not the message they are all not israel which are of what needed because they are the seed of abraham are they all what but in isaac shall that seed become that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the world are counted for water for their children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to adam masten not of what but of him that do what it is israel but with a mixed multitude naturally israel israel you only need the spiritual gene to detect who truly is israel hallelujah know ye therefore that day which are of faith they say my water not all the flesh not the corner one the one of faith for by grace are you saved through what that is not of yourself it is the water fight the good fight of water lay on to lay hold onto water where unto down what you were predestinated to eternal life that's why when you take manna he does he have a different reaction in your body he has a different reaction in your life but somebody else might be eating the same thing and it doesn't change them you preach leave the high heel one sister take the high heel off another sister keep the high heel one cause want to take the high heel off what cause the other to keep it what cause the other one to wear long dresses that passes their knee what caused the other one to keep the dresses shorter than the knees what it looks like the work of god is not taking no effect no check the engine check the engine it might be a suzuki engine in the mercedes the body looks mercedes but the engine is not mercedes we need to open the engine and make sure it's mercedes mercedes it's uh it's it's nissan hallelujah hallelujah you have a perfect tap of that in israel leaving egypt they came about 2 million strong all the water escaped through the sacrificial blood how many our what in the world all the dwarfs of the world enjoying water manifestation and blessings and again water ate water and oil grain water drunk of water yet except for a very few they were not but water for the children who should follow them and go into water all israel is not and all but a tiny majority had the name in other words the father who came out from egypt they didn't enter the promised land the one who entered the promised land was their children that was born in the wilderness [Music] and brother branham is saying all that they were only carrier they were babysitters they will carry you to a certain point they are shocked they protect the ground after a while when the sun rise up the shack should not air with the seed the shack have to open and release the seed and the shark dies they were carrier they were there to carry you in your life for a certain time until a time is appropriate they're gonna pull back because the sun has risen and the sun needs to take care of the seed the seed shall not air with their shock take first samuel chapter 25. we're preaching this so you never should be shocked when you meet somebody in the message believer or deacon or whoever it is and when you begin to chase them you begin to talk to them you begin to wonder is this a message believer or your heart just check the dna by the word play religious in the pulpit three years never hear the church ages right four years they don't preach certain things every day god is gonna help you be of god courage you could be strong stand strong tomorrow be strong stay strong be more with strong sense that's not the gospel you need it is in the message you need the pure word amen first samuel chapter 25 make sure you got it my god few pages all right everybody there let's navigate this for those worrying on time we good verse 1 and samuel died and all israel and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him in other words they were mourning and buried him in his house at rhema and david arose and went down to the wilderness of perrin you ready now okay let's go and there was as a man in mount moun was a tribe in the tribe of judah whose possession his business were in carmel so this man was not living in carmen he was in mountain in the city of mount but this is his house in muhammad mahon but his business was in the city of carmel that's where he owns business is very clear and there was a man in my own whose possession were in carmel and the man was very great this was a very rich man a big man and he had three dozen sheep and a thousand water if you notice his flock contains sheep and goats [Laughter] anybody clear so he got shepherd for sheep and goat the thousands three thousand sheep and a thousand goats he was shearing his ship at water when they said shearing the ship there is a key to this let me stop right there and read it over again now there was a man in my home whose possession were in carmel and the man was very great a very rich man and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goat and he was shearing his sheep in carmel this was the time or the hour of the shearing of sheep here it was the time of the shearing of sheep if you notice this shearing is not the shearing of god anybody care but the time that they were shearing the sheep what is important in that time brother branham what we need today is to submit all your rights is to let god lay you down and shave all your rights off of you amen could you imagine how a leader or lamb or fleece hanging over that is his right but the problem imitate the painting lamb burn up and then just lay up on the shearing table they know what is best for him take all of his right away from him and share it off how cool and light he runs in other words this ship was heavy laden with a lot of wool he want to run but too much wall he wanna do too heavy he can't go he can't go they said no no we need we know what is good for this ship bring the sheep not the god put them on the table remove all the excess water and when they remove it the sheep begin to jump the sheep begin to be the will have to be separated from the womb [Music] there was a certain wall that was causing heaviness that wall need to be taken off to make the ship run his cause freely the bible says brother branham says my he is happy and jump around and has a big time yes sir if you shall forfeit your rights that is what you get but you got to forfeit your right and let the word of god do what all the water off of you take all the water habit of the world away and you become a new water shaving timer amen i shall take my choice today i shall forfeit all my talking about other people i shall forfeit all my water i shall forfeit all my water i shall forfeit everything shear me off lord take all i got you just take me lord i wanted to stand in your place i wanted to be chilled i want us selfishness all proud i want you just all take it off of me then i want to stand for you as a shield lamb willing to give all the pleasure of what they call pleasures of life all the water all the water all the water vulgar clothing don't mean only tight clothing the gloves that shows your knees is showing your nakedness [Music] a body of a woman is a sacred woman it's a sacred body what should you expose your body amen the fourth clothing makeup lipstick fingernail polish all these indifference that look like the water you say don't even act like the world don't even water associate with the world come out from among them oh god help me lord share me today take me like a lamb and let me be dumb don't open my mouth say nothing about it just stand and be what shield you always have an excuse when it comes to something hallelujah it was the shearing time of the lamb that's when this story started you there let's go to verse three now the name of the man was who never and the name remember last sunday he was an egyptian rescued from the sinner amalekite today it's not an egyptian it is a jew israel rescued from israel we're there the name the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife was who abigail manis are you there and she was a woman of water in other words she was a wise woman we have neighbor brother robert what does he mean and we have abigail abigail has wisdom what has never heaven [Music] are you there every girl the word never means what hallelujah brother branham say in marriage and divorce thank you brother mike like david he was married what was your name abigail which there was a man called what he had a nice wife and he did what and abigail was married to who he was the word one husband must die you remember reading to be married to the second husband brother burnham where did you get this that neighbor means fool in first samuel 25 25 the bible said let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of what it's a wicked man so neighbor was a wicked man the road of the wicked should not abide with the property of the water because they just will put his hand there a wise woman have a wicked around him a wicked man amen hallelujah this man of belial a wicked man belia a bad man even nabel for as his name is so is he never is his name and water is with what so never means fool a folly anybody here so we found here that we have folly and water we have a wise virgin am i reading a different bible are we okay a wise version and a what hallelujah his name for his name is as his what [Music] now we found out [Music] that they set the pace and did you ever notice our young boss has become ricky and elvis you got the child name that change it right quick call him number one or two or something it's better even to call him number one why brother branham don't do that it's horrible what a difference does that does the name mean why sure it means something your name characterize your water now brother branham you are numerology no i am not i am on water why was he when jacob he lived to his name a deceiver supplanted jacob and when god changed him he changed his name god changed saul to paul salmon to peter certainly he had something and ricky and elvis and such name as that is the modern american name which throws a child automatically right into what you watch what name you give to your baby what name you give to your son or your daughter is gonna drive that spirit right back there anybody care so we found that we have wisdom connected to folly wisdom we all know what wisdom means he is married to family and who's going to suffer but the time of separation has happened where god have to free wisdom from the headship of foley are we there let's go to verse 3. now the name of the man was never full and the name of his wife was abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful continent but the man was what do you know what he means the man was cruel he was a mean man he was rude abigail means the joy of my father a man gave birth to his daughter and called that daughter abigail and said this is my joy when that man is walking he's walking with abigail when he want to go upstairs he put abigail on his back and walk with abigail when he sit down abigail is playing on his lap when he look at abigail he said one of this day oh lord my daughter will get married he's she will go to somebody else i love her so much may she get a good husband and for some reason abigail got married to a fool how many marriages in the entire world are like nebo and abigail how many women are living under cruel husband [Music] are you there and of beautiful continents but the man was challenged harsh cruel mean rude and evil in his work he was a bad man and he was of the house of wiper how can you be from the house of caleb and being cruel [Music] this is not an egyptian this is a jew who is caliber hallelujah number 13 verse 6 of the tribe of water who from the royal seed came neville daddy say he's from the tribe of judah he's a believer i can let my daughter get married to him and they put the daughter under the hand of a fool they put the young man under the hand of a foolish woman dominating cruel rude for years but god is coming down to kill the husband hallelujah now let us stand like joshua and kill him now watch close this is going to have a water now let us stand like joshua and kill him as we see the promised land coming inside it is near the time to be given joshua in hebrew means whatever and represent the water the promise and time water who is the promising time leader and calib to take the church over and caleb represent the water who stay with who and nervous was from the house of caleb from the house of the true believer kim never in the rank of the message there is neighbor cruel to the women cruel to their wives hallelujah now let us stand like joshua and kill him our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs now joshua means jehovah's savior and he represents the end time water compound meaning the holy ghost but as the pastor of the age you have brother branham under the pillar of fire the leader under the leader the pillar of fire the true leader then moses then the children of god the pillar of fire then brother branham than the children of god the leader under the leader the shepherd under the shepherd the great shepherd the pillar of fire are you there and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as water came as the original water caleb represent those that stay true with water does that stay with the message of moses does that stay with joshua but from the house from among the caliber came nebo a neighbor is connected to a big girl who is a wise woman but connected to a fool a bigger sufferer for many years and a harsh husband a mean husband many things he did was evil doings and this woman was subject to being mistreated abused for years the time of the deliverance comes amen david is moving hallelujah jump to verse four and david did water who delivered the egyptian from the amalekite who did it david who's going to deliver a bigger from a fool hallelujah hallelujah continue dominating your home continue dominating your husband continue controlling everything because he's a lamb whatever you say must be done in the house continue that and wait he's coming hallelujah and david heard in the wilderness that never did water was the time of the shearing david got a signal there is a lamb that need to be free from here from from excess water the signal is cheering yes somebody needs to be free from the wall from a foolish war hallelujah verse five and david send out water [Music] how many young men is pen a good number why did david use 10 why he didn't use 12 because remember when eliezer went to get rebecca elias had 10 camels and brother branham said one of them was the word about here you remember that and 10 minus minus one equal what equal nine you have the word and the non-spiritual gift sent to get rebecca out did you get me do you want me to repeat the bible says there were ten cameras loaded with gift that was sent to get rebecca brother branham said one of the camera was the word he was the holy spirit that's the one rebecca gave water and that's the one that carried rebecca all the way back home but the nine of them must be there we must preach the word with the nine gift the full word hallelujah and david also to go to that side he pick up 10. but brother branham said 10 is a bad number hallelujah oh my god brother bottom said 10 is a bad number that's right to start with 10 it's a bad number they had 10 tribe on israel and their then them was just all water he had to take joseph's two sons if from him and manasseh the prophet showed them and blessed them to bring them to twelve the number of worship david took ten amen paul says that to the weak i became as what that i meant what okay i am made of things to all men that are men i might by all men do what let me continue you have not clicked here and this i do for the gospel sake paul say because of the gospel sometimes i must remain weak but i am weak to rescue somebody relax keep your belt in second corinthians chapter five the bible says for he has made him to be what who knew not sin that we might be mad the what jesus became sin not that jesus was sinful but sometime to save somebody god became bad in the purpose to rescue somebody hallelujah watch this stay tuned somebody's gonna catch it the first part you there david send out how many water young men young people and david said to the young man get you up to camel and go to naval and greet him in water so when they go there they don't present themselves in their own name jesus said i came in my father's name the father who sent me when you present there present yourself in the name of david are you ready watch that now and does shall you say to him that the water lives in water in prosperity he lives in laodicea rich increase with goods tell him that live under the laodicean spirit talk to him and tell him tell him what you're there peace be buff to who the message of david is peace peace to who the individual karma and what karma and what possession three area of peace let me read it now say to him that i live in prosperity peace be buff to you and peace to your house and peace be to all that you have there are three areas where god brings peace first peace to you then peace to your house then peace to all that you belong hallelujah hallelujah the ten men let me go here brother branham said give me a church give me how many men ten men who really jew who really jews of god the royal seed put them together and watch what shall take place give me this little house full of people like that and i shall show you a light that the world will run to it that's right that's what god wants to be you are a city setting on the hill you're a royal seed of abraham it shall possess the gate of its enemy now the three area in job chapter 1 verse 9 then sit and answer the lord and say do job fear god for not yes that not made a what a protection about what him individual karma about his what number two karma about to atom possession the three area are you there so god when he protected job he protected job he protected the house of job and he protected the business and everything that job had he started with job first because paul when he met the man the the the philippian jailer he says believe on the lord jesus christ you and you shall be saved you and your wife and your house you first then your house then i take care of everything david approaching the house of neighbor is bringing the full coverage never i'm bringing you peace i'm bringing you peace to you peace to your house and i'm bringing peace to everything that you have do you need peace if peace already existed there the house was a house of trouble a house of abuse and god came down to bring peace to the house peace to the head of the house peace to his house and peace to everything that he is hallelujah let's go to verse seven and now this is the message of david i have heard that you are you have sheriff now your shepherd which were with us we hurt them not neither was there anything missing to them all the while they were in water david was around the business of neighbor one never knew it not and david never destroyed his servant david never steal anything from him matter of fact david was a protection to the business of a mean man you see sometimes the wicked are prospering and david asked a question and he was god that was protecting the business of neighbor now before judgment comes god approaches first to bring peace i just want to tell you i'm bringing

to know who is this man david no he was a man of judah he knew who david was but it is a talk of disgust who is this david david david david who is he who is this david who is the son of what how did he know he was the son of jesus he knew him but he's just belittling david and be telling his message a mixed multitude are you there who is the son of jesse there be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his water david didn't cause a division with saul a unclean soul rejected the word of god when saul rejected the word of god an unclean spirit entered soul and because of that condition he calls separation but even though david is innocent he has been accusing gossip like somebody who caused trouble to his master it's all over the message the poor david i just separated i could do harm to him but because he was called of the lord and it is one i didn't want to pull my shift i say may the lord deal with him i'm taking my hand off i'm going but still he was treated as a malefactor he was counted among the male factor like somebody who did something wrong to saul [Music] and that's what has been giving to other people and he who is the son of jesse there'll be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master they thought he was a male factor yeah he might be some of those yeah nowadays everybody's the division the division this one leave this church so he's the same one that did the same thing innocent shall i take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it to the men whom i know not where they be they say he came from africa hallelujah so david's young men turned away and went again and came and told him of those saying verse 13 and david said to his men guard you on every man his water the lamb turn into the water the god that can save can also do what amen gird on every man his sword and the gird on every man his water his sword and david also girded on his sword the sword that he got from goliath it's a whole mystery and there went after david about 400 men and 200 above by the staff and one of the young men told abigail nebel's wife saying behold david sent messenger out of the wilderness to salute our master and he wailed on them but the men were very good to us and where and we were not hurt neither missed we anything as long as they were conversant with them oh sorry as

water even his servant knew he was a bad man so he was really really bad that a man cannot water nobody can talk to him he doesn't want to heal nobody when he get mad he get mad anybody here then

enemies of david if i leave of all that you turn to him by the morning light any that urinate against the wall in other words he was coming to kill every man that was there amen not every woman if he didn't say he was coming to kill the women he was coming to kill the head hallelujah the bible says in 23 and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and she fell before david on her
