these old songs and how he likes them a lot of them were you know they're really anointed and i and i was raised singing old hymns and anyways and i and i i don't know i'm just kind of i don't know if it's just old-fashioned or just stubborn then i don't want to move on to a lot of the newer stuff i don't know i mean some of it's anointed i think some of what michael w smith's can be redeemed i'll put it that way and we've done it you know but i still like falling back on these old ones and just singing them and if it was good enough for brother branham you know what i'm saying then we should sing them so let me have that see again and then we're gonna we're gonna try to pick up the pace on this one a little bit okay i like to sing this one a little bit fast it's our invitation as his

hallelujah i do not have any prayers praise reports written down um there are a couple of us that are working on trying to get us some little sheets made up like we had um you know so when you come in and you have a praise report or you have a prayer request and you'll be able to fill it out and give it to myself or brother abel before service starts i'm having trouble finding a full ream of a single colored paper you know we don't need five different colors and only use two i don't want to bounce around and make the praise reports pink this week and orange next week you know so we're just i'm just searching i think we'll be able to do it and but we want to try to establish that so it's easier does anybody have a praise report this morning they'd like to give yes sir come on up good morning church i wanted to give a praise report about last month the beginning of last month no about two weeks ago middle of last month but i was given an email by one of my like administrators in my high school and it was about a opportunity to like internship for like google and i was like okay so i signed up for it and they're like the google supposed to email me back but they emailed me back saying they got the email but they never gave me like the next step to the application so really i missed that i really missed the chance and i prayed about it and i left it alone and about you know yesterday yesterday two days ago i got another email from google saying you didn't complete your application i was like what it was like it was all like the due date was like last week and then they said we pressed our due date up due to some inconveniences with the with their program i was like wow that's awesome so so i finished it yesterday no the day before yesterday and i took the test yesterday and it was like a comprehensive test and they were telling me to give me practice questions had some math and i did not remember it so i kind of like did a brief study session before i took the test then i took the test and i was like wow it wasn't even that hard like the test is really just riddles so i just want to give god the glory because you know i was nervous and i was kind of pressured to take the test i was rushing and scrambling to get my papers right and out in the middle of the test my pencil broke and then having relayed i started like oh my god i just want to say give god the glory and just give him thanks i got one too brother robert you want to come up and give yours i got one too that um i wanna i wanna mention i got a red light on this is it the battery amen god bless everybody i wanna just share this testimony because last wednesday working at the church went in as normal we had some contractors working in the back of the building and they had some issues with some wasps so as soon as i got there they wanted to get some raspberry so i opened the building went in there put my things down locked it back and ran to walmart to get the spray for them when i got back i gave it to them and they see that settle that is you never came back to get back in the building put my hand in my pocket no key say no i can't do that i checked every pocket nokia said my god no man this can't happen brother greg was supposed to come to help me work and my son was supposed to be there also and i can't get in the building and it's it's critical we have to get stuff done so i went to the truck i said i'm trying to figure what to do lord where could possibly this key be i'm very you know methodical about stuff because i hate losing stuff and i always put in this pocket and it's not there and say hello that's what i call a locksmith super great cause i said well the place is locked i'm locked out man so long story short i finally decided that cobra might so i went to charlotte got his key and got in the building because i had locked it in the building i went in there nothing said god where's this key ah went back around the building walked around retraced my footsteps nothing so i was feeling very you know disturbed about that because i hate losing keys so i prayed about it and i remembered a couple saturdays ago with charles iii he had lost his key and he came and gave the testimony how the lord you know used brother kelly to get the key for him was actually when i went there this saturday to pick up the the tent i just saw the key laying on the grass just clearly and i picked it up and said this looks like his can give to berkeley and he brought to him so the ideas came to my head and said lord you had allowed me to find his keys and get it through brother kelly to get to him i said lord i need that now i need that same help somewhere in this universe you know exactly where that kid i can't find it i can't go back to walmart i'm just at a loss so i got a copy i made a second copy but but the other key that's missing is the key for the mailbox and there's only one of that trying to figure out how to break into the mailbox just a bunch of stuff so i just i said i can't i didn't really initial um you know articulate the words that i'm thinking just how myself kelly and charles was involved in that fine i need that same kind of help and he just came to me with brother kelly so yesterday brothers went to clean up at the back of the church so cold broccoli is how they were doing he said um everything's going all right and we're supposed to be there shortly and i found a bunch of keys i said what i said is the orange key he said yes i was elated so by the time i got to church he threw it for me i quote and said oh my god thank god for he found it right at the entrance where i passed thursday friday back and forth and he just thought on the grasses so thank god for that god it's good amen well you know i'll give one real quick last year you know um my wife and i had coveted in december but rebecca had it all the way back at last july and any time from what i understand that your body especially for a lady anytime that their body goes to an extreme fever they lose their hair and it was it was evident with both both of them and you know um rebecca went to the pastor and said would you pray that my hair grows back this is her glory right this is her glory will you pray for it well it's been growing it looks kind of you know kind of we compare to my older brother because he's got real kind of shaggy hair but you know it looks like sometimes she has bangs and we're like no you're not growing bangs it's just your hair growing back so it's growing back and i think you know some of my wife as well but god doesn't want her without the glory you know so we praise god for that amen [Applause] i do have one prayer request here this morning um so we'll we'll read this this is from my sister priscilla please pray for her 86 year old mother we've all i think we met her a couple years back uh she fell this past week and broke a bone near her hip she will be undergoing surgery this week please pray that god be with the surgeon and a quick recovery for mom and we will give we give all god all the glory amen amen i'ma call on brother zach to come up and pray over these if he doesn't mind he's up from georgia this weekend yes ma'am i'm sorry it might be easier sister so a lot of times we take care of patients and nothing strikes you because it's their patients but then there are particular times when you take care of a patient and something just hits you yesterday i was taking care of a 46 year old man who reminded me of my brother i have a brother who follows me who is also 46. he is so sick he needs god they put i'm not sure if you're aware of ecma where they bypass your lungs and put it in a machine so that the machine can actually oxygenate you a long story short he has covered and i was in that room i couldn't even get out i mean he was so sick people were in there trying to help him and i just asked for prayers for him i mean there are many patients in the hospital but if you could just remember him his name was so long he's of indian descent so i couldn't even pronounce his name i was just referring to him as as him so please remember him sorry mine will be very short i want to thank god for two things first one for one year now over one year we've been handling like cases of hobbit and god has taken care of me in those cases without problem i know we put on this uh what you call it they call them ppe that doesn't guarantee yes so all year long and is now coming back it's like daily you handle those people if you are not god's grace i will not sometimes i wanted even to excuse myself and ask as if they could allow me not to work with covered patients because of my age and they said no secondly i want thank god i've been praying for a job that can allow me to have time to come to church so two weeks ago i got a change not in the job but in time i'm going to do eight hours that will allow me to come to church on wednesday and my manager said i know you are a praying guy so if you can schedule yourself the rest of the days except sunday you can go to church then that is okay for me and i said thank you lord that's all i've been doing thank you god bless you amen praise the lord anybody else let's remember each other yes ma'am your sister okay sister hadassah all right yes ma'am who is it just a family name okay all

um the indian man's name back here so you know god bless you all for what you do it's got to be tough and it's got to be a little nerve-wracking but you're you're heroes yeah i think all police officers and my you know my daughter works in the ed at cmc maine in the um and she you know y'all are heroes i just want to thank god because a week before my 15 anniversary my husband bought me a watch so a week after the anniversary i lost it i was really troubled i'm like lord i love this watch so much and i don't know where i put it it was really disturbing me so i told my husband he saw me very sad he went and buy me two more watch so when he bought me two more watch the a sister came in my mind that i should give another one to the sister so i told my husband i'm feeling in my heart i have to give one of them to this sister she's like he's like is it it's your watch so you can do whatever you want i just want you to be happy so i took the other watch i gave to the sister i bought it on wednesday so i lost the watch about a month so when i gave the sister the watch on wednesday on friday my what my husband was looking for some stuff he went in and he found the watch so i thank

hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord we thank the musician god bless you you might be seated a little bit brother david i don't know you know how to put a pause you know it okay if they know praise god some stuff don't belong to everybody amen everybody on the anticipation what is going on nothing big number one we appreciate all the young people that were yesterday at work amen we call some people the book of esther is loaded with a lot of stuff and we gotta get all the tools ready the first death the second death the mystery of the death so when we go to the book of esther in the second banquet you're gonna see them popping up left and right if i show you i say this is it here you'll be like i can't see it i say this is it here i can't see it so we gotta describe all of them so when you go back you look you say i see it because armageddon is there gogo and magog is there the first death is in the book of esther the second death is in the book of esther the mystery of death is in the book of israel the mystery of sin and death laymen in the book of esther all of them there amen matthew chapter 13 brother david give me a little bit more so i blasted that devil he attacked me since yesterday if i'm standing here is the grace of god my wife knows exactly what i'm talking about if you see me preaching it's the grace of god so we're in war stay in prayer amen yeah we are in a battle just to get the building where we are there ask brother robert the last time we spoke with him till 2 a.m on the telephone because we got to go with the state left and right you send something to send about you send something descendant like we need trees we need this we need hey what do you want to do with trees matthew 13 but don't worry i already know them by the scripture another parable put him forth to them saying if i'm not mistaken matthew 13 have seven parables and if we get into them you're going to see the seven church ages lining up like this in one chapter there's seven parable in matthew 13 we're just pulling one okay the opening of the seventh seal another you go home you're gonna count them another parable put here forth to them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a man which saweth good seed in the in his field you can sit down there is a field and that field belong to the good man and do you know who the good man is you know him right because the rich young ruler when he say good master jesus said who is good but who so there is a man that i have a field and that man the owner of the field which is god everybody clear has good seed he has seeds and those seeds are good you need to be really really tight today because i am taking off amen but verse 25 while he slept his enemy so there is a second person here who is the enemy anybody clear i know you've seen this before but stay tight his enemy came and saw the tears among the wheat so the good seed are wheat everybody the wheat and the enemy which we know is satan has also some seed and they are bad seed because this one is good and he sees our tears the serpent seed right here in the scripture but when the blood was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tales also so the servant of the householder came and said to him sir did not use so good seed in your field it belongs to him from where then has its tears he said to them an enemy has done this the servant said to him will you then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you ruled up the wheat from them let both grow together until the harvest there is a harvest and in the time of harvest i was saying to the reapers gather you together first details they must be bound first and bind them in bundle to be water so the purpose of the tears according to the owner of the field is fire is burning you need to understand this stuff about clear to be burned and bind them in bottle in bundle to be burned to burn them but gather their wheat into my water brother branham call that the rapture one is going to be burned one is going to be raptured anybody clear that's finished now jump to verse 36 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciple came to him saying declare to us the parable of the tares of the field jesus gave them a lot of parables but out of all those parables there was something about this specific one that pricked the heart of the disciple and the disciples were really interested on this one more than the other one amen verse 37 he answered and said to them he that soweth the good seed is who so the owner or god is the son of man anybody clear is the son of man come up oh say my calm the field is the water so this field is the world filled equal the world that's why when they say israel was a man of the field it means he was a worldly man right makes sense now if you go in the old testament you will see the bible say esau was a man of the field the field is the world in other words esau was a carnal man but random never give you that scripture the message is perfectly in line with the scripture anybody clear he answered and said to them he that served the good seed is the son of man they filled this the world the good seed are the water so the seed of god are the children of god [Music] seed means children amen are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the water remember cain was of the wicked one so we have children of god and also children of the devil scripture not even a quote yet anybody clear verse 39 the enemy that soweth them is who satan their harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels everybody clear let's go to john chapter 18. just bear with me let me land this plane where i want it to amen because if you don't understand these two principle you're not going to understand the second death i can give you a description it's in the scripture the bible say the second death is the lake of fire it's in this bible what does the lake of fire mean what is the lake of fire is he our fire or a different fire see now john chapter 18 verse 36 if you're there you can say amen answered my kingdom is not of this world so this honor and this enemy these children are talking about two kingdoms and both kingdoms have a head and a children and a servant a head children and servant a head god children the children of god and servant the angels anybody clear a head satan children of the devil servants are demons two kingdoms we clear now my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servant fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from here he's talking to pilate pilate therefore said to him are you a king then jesus answered you say that i am a king in other words i am a king to this and was i born and for this course came i into the world that i should bear witness of the truth watch carefully now everyone that is off the water the truth do what so for you to hear the voice of god you must be a child of the truth make sense it is those that came out of the truth that can hear the truth not everybody will hear the truth you must be born of the truth for you to hear the truth so these wit here are children of the truth let's go to second thessalonians chapter two it's going to get yummy here amen blessed be the name of the lord when we have service make sure you sleep on time eat good so when you come you relax and then we load you you go home and you digest till wednesday 2nd thessalonians chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen verse 8 and then shall that wicked one remember the children of the wicked one be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth that's another problem there let me leave it alone and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him that wicked one whose coming is after the working of who satan with all power and sons and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of our righteousness in them that do water so the people that usually perish have something in them let me continue they have something in them that help them perish amen because they receive not the water the love of the truth that there might be water so for you to be saved you must first be a child of the truth and for you to be saved you must receive the love of the truth in other words a child of the truth everybody clear is a child that have been loaded with the love of the truth that's why you hate iniquity when somebody is treating somebody wrong you just feel in your heart that this is not right and somebody else is having pleasure into that like go ahead get him get him get him and you look like i don't think this is right what makes you act like that you you have a problem knowing if you're a child of god you're gonna know it today before you leave this building you're gonna know which seed you are [Applause] hallelujah we're sick of playing church [Music] and for this cause god shall send them a waters who's sending data that they should believe in water so when somebody believe a lie they have something in them helping them to believe a liar am i reading a different bible than yourself okay that day all might be water why are they them why why god cannot save them that there may be them who believe not in the water how are they going to believe the truth because they don't have the love of the truth but head water that's why when they do something wrong they like it they like the shooting stuff killing stuff making somebody bad they like that they enjoy it when they kill people intentionally they like it there's something in them that like that amen but they have pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound we are bound to give thank to who to give thanks to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god why do we give thanks for you because god from water from the beginning god has from the beginning do what chosen you to water you were chosen to be saved even if you don't like it you're going to be saved it doesn't depend on you it depends on who took the decision for you what else do you have to do to be safe [Music] hallelujah chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the water and belief of the water that's why you believe the truth sometimes it doesn't make sense hallelujah verse 14 where to he called you by our water so when the gospel goes it's somebody's calling you somebody's hearing the sermon somebody else is hearing a call anybody clear to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore verse 15 brethren stand fast and hold the water the tradition which you have been taught whether by water voice or our water books can i repeat it again [Music] hold the tradition which you have been taught whether by water tapes word voice in the tapes or by water a piece of writings in books how is the message of brother branham any question let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we thank you for helping us get into this part of the world lord where we know it's not an effort of a man but it's the working of the holy spirit ministering to your children father i thank you for touching me in a supernatural way for me to be able to even stand this morning in front of the purchase of the blood of the lamb lord may you move me completely away from this place may you come and speak to your children may the devil be completely sealed out with his army every spirit that will make people tired or sleepy father will rebuke it away from this place may you come lord father and lift up your children to the dimension lord of the heavenly places in christ jesus father we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are on part three we start with the second banquet of esther number one was the mystery of death you understand why we have to go through that number two we spoke about the first death number three today we are entering the second death like i said it's very easy to go in the scripture to look at the definition of the second death the second death is the lake of fire everybody have that every church can read that because it's written in the scripture but what is the lake of fire amen what is the lake of fire what has the lake of fire to do with us anybody clear so to understand the lake of fire we need two things in other words to understand the second death we need two things number one we need to understand what is the origin of people number two we need to understand the resurrection everybody clear we are digging deep now today we're gonna handle the origin anybody clear when you understand the origin and the resurrection when we enter the second death you're gonna know what it means what is our origin last sunday we spoke with found out that man is made of three parts the body the soul and the spirit and we found that these three parts have been divided into two different aspects the spiritual man which have the spirit and the soul and then the natural man which have the body or the clothing or the tabernacle or the other garment everybody clear and then we found out that death itself also come into two aspects death come in the spiritual aspect and in the natural aspect of the literal aspect in the literal or natural aspect when we started we touched the first death and we found out that the first death affected the body everybody clear brother bonham says here in the pergamos churches he says that if there is one death and we know about it then there is got to be another death somewhere because one death we die in here is in uh we diet here in the flesh the second death we diet in the water in the spirit commander soul so if man is made out of three elements which is body soul and spirit and the first death destroyed the body everybody clear the second death here brother branham say is for the destruction of the spirit and the soul in other words if you want to destroy an individual completely if you want to inaudible somebody if you wanna make somebody disappear completely you must give him the first death and the second death ever clear so far i'm clamping so keep your seat belt ever clear in matthew 10 verse 28 the bible say and fear not them which can cure the by which killed the body that's the devil that's the highest he can go remember but are not able to kill the water so the only person that can kill the soul of somebody is the lord jesus christ ever clear so you might be dead in the body but you are still alive somewhere so to destroy you completely you must be destroyed in the body and in the spirit and the soul you must have the first death and the second death anybody can hear so far he said but are not able to kill the soul but rather feel him which is able to destroy both what the soul and the body in water keep the hell in mind luke 12 and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that can kill the body and after that have no more that they can do that's all the devil can do but i will forewarn you whom you shall feel because when they kill you you enter the sixth dimension and nothing enters the sixth dimension except water can the devil have perfect love so he's doomed he's finished everybody okay but i will follow on you whom you shall feel feel him which after he has killed you physically physically have power to cast into water so to destroy somebody completely you must give him the first and the second death if he only get the first death he's still alive somewhere but we don't want on them everybody here if a soul died behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth is shall water so a soul can die but who can kill the soul only god they saw that sin if he shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the rapture shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him in other words everybody must be responsible for their own life but if the wicked will turn from all his sin that he had committed and keep on my statute and do what is lawful and while he shall surely leave he shall not water so we understand here that a soul can die so the second death actually applied to the spiritual part of a man because the second death killed the spirit and the soul but to understand this death we must understand the mystery of our origin you ready praise god if you didn't back up i'm not responsible for that anybody clear there is a circle here this circle is called eternity make sure you stay awake make sure you stay awake everybody clear this circle here is called eternity when we say eternity eternity doesn't have an end you follow me eternity you cannot pinpoint the beginning and you cannot pinpoint the end on eternity everybody here when you study math in school they show you a line where they were saying for me minus infinity to plus infinity eternity is not like that you follow me eternity is something that doesn't have an end in other words negative infinity and positive infinity are all blending in eternity are you following me the way our brain has been structured we have been structured to think in the plain way make sure you stay awake if you look at the earth the earth is round about clear how can we be standing straight when the earth is round anybody here when you look at the map of the earth they're going to show you africa here they show you america here and it goes all around so which side is the up and which side is the down so when we are standing straight here are we standing straight like this or a mass straight on the earth like this or am i upside down have you ever thought about it ever here if you leave gastonia and you continue to go towards charlotte everything is playing plan plan play and playing play because our brains were wired to look at things in the plain way are you following me everybody clear our brain were wired to work with the law of gravitation everybody that law does not apply to end did you get it if i take an end a n t and i put a net right here on the floor you're gonna see the ant walking straight like this you follow me if i pick up the ant and i put him on the wall here you're going to see that ant going up he's not falling back here if i pick the hand and put him on the ceiling you see the end going on the ceiling he doesn't fall down to the end everything is flat when the ant get right here he see it like a plane to you and me we have to be on the flat floor when if i take you and i put you here to walk like this you're going to fall down if i put your feet over there you're going to fall down because we were not wired like that anybody following me so eternity doesn't have a beginning and does not have an end are you following me there is one being that is called god god is the only being that is eternal you follow me so the only being that can feel eternity is god because eternity does not have a beginning and eternity does not have an end and god also as melchizedek have no father no matter no beginning of days no ending of time so the only being that if you take him you put him in eternity he feel all eternity is god i'm going slowly everybody following me if i take you and i put you into a bottle you're not gonna feel that bottle anybody clear you're gonna get in the border and there will be space around but when you take god and eternity if you put god in eternity god fit eternity in other words god is a hand and eternity is the glove when you take god you put him in eternity he fits perfectly if i take you i put you in eternity you're going to be maybe small like this what are you talking about brother stephen hallelujah god being infinite who cannot lie cannot speak anything contrary knows everything how does god knows everything please give me time wake up and buckle up what makes god to know everything are you ready if eternity is a circle anybody clear and god and eternity are blending together in other words when you put god all eternity is filled you follow me everything that is in god everything that is in god feel eternity are you there stay with me come just as perfect at the beginning as he is at the ending and just as perfect at the end as he was at the beginning in other words negative infinity and madness they blend together god is water like water you can never find a corner in a perfect cycle you could run and run through ages and eternity and there never never never be an end to it and that is the way god is god which always was he was infinite perfect to begin with and he shall always be the same he never can change his perfectly the same everybody understanding this man called god was made of seven colors relaxing god was this great big fountain of water seven colors how many knows that see and how many knows that god has seven spirit absolutely seven spirits and there was seven eyes in the lamb and so forth all that coming together now now that was god now when he the logos went out of god which was god coming from this one big fountain into a body in the form of man he made the logos which called the what theophany pay attention here this eternity here is filled with seven colors which is god these colors here are not amen visible you following me brother branham say many times that through this world what there is color coming down to prove to you that color comes down about here if we bring a tv right here and we put a tv right there you're gonna see the same color president by then have in washington right now if the president is giving a speech in washington and his style is blue everybody the color of his tie goes in a ways do you follow me and that color goes all over the world in the same time you follow me that's the reason when the president gives a speech in washington even if somebody is in africa if you put a tv you're going to see him with the same color he's giving the speech way in washington what makes you way somewhere there see the same color that is in another place over there because you are hitting the wave area take hebrew chapter 11 hallelujah did i lose someone you already need space you already forgot about gastonia are you there hebrew chapter 11 verse three everybody here through water faith we understand that the world's plural did you see that where framed by water the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do water and but here god is a spirit john 4 verse 21 if i'm not mistaken a spirit is not visible so the seven colors of god wear invisible colors the color becomes visible when it's already condensed in a certain place then your eye can detect it what are you trying to say brother stephen if you take clorox and you take a black color and you put in clorox what do you see there do you see the black color again the black color disappear because the black color has been disintegrated when it's disintegrated it doesn't carry the color you see with your eye it is there but it's broken down everybody understanding so these seven colors here are the seven spirit of god that fill all eternity do you understand so within this god inside this god there was an attribute you follow me attribute to be saved attribute to be healed we know all about it now this god in eternity sat down in his mind and he begin to write his own story are you following me this is a different language buddy this whole bible to my opinion we know the opinion of the prophet the whole set up is a dramatic weapon just starting out of eden coming out through the gate on out the way of the cross leading right back again just all one big picture god has placed out of his mind i can imagine seeing god before there was even a foundation of the world before there was a moon a star anything seeing him set in the space yonder where did you see him brother branham and in his mind he drew out that picture what it would all be and everything he just spoke and said let there be and everything just begin to come into its place in this being that i have attribute here follow me carefully god begin to write his own story you follow me you follow me god begin to say that there will be a man called brother robert he's gonna be born in the country of trinidad he will move to the united states he will be an engineer he will be a deacon in living word then he's going to be a deacon in spoken word all of that was bundled up in the mind of god do you follow me your entire life everything that you got through now your entire life from beginning to the end was all part of the mind of god everybody understanding we are talking about eternity and god everybody following me blessed be the name of the lord so this being here when he finished his story do you understand when he wrote his story when he slew the lamb in his story when he finished the entire bible and your life and my life and your life all of them together he was not having space because he was feeling eternity if he moved it's eternity if he moved it's eternity if he moves it's eternal eternity block him because eternity and him blended together are you following me him and eternity fused together he needed space when he want to move it's eternity if he goes this way eternity if he goes up eternity he goes down he wants space you follow me to create space you follow me god pulled two words the first was in my faith and the second one was kenos blessed be the name of the lord by a morphin the invisible god wanted to make himself visible you understand but if he makes himself visible do you follow me he is still feeling eternity everybody follow me so he needed to get himself out of eternity and shrink himself down i'm going to go slowly if you look at a big tree somewhere there that tree was a small seed like this you follow me when they planted the seed that seed when it grows it gives you a big trees with all the fruit there you follow me if you take this tree and you begin to shrink it back to where it started you follow me you gonna end up into a seed do you follow me in other words the branches were in the seed the fruit were in the seed the bark was in the seed so god also who feel all eternity begin to shrink himself down you follow me when he shrugged himself down he ended up into a pillar of fire [Applause] [Music] did i lose somebody did i lose someone did i lose someone in other words the pillar of fire have the fullness of god bonded up into a seed the spoken word is the original everybody okay everybody okay when god shrank himself through a murphy and kenos into the pillar of fire he created a negative pressure did i lose somebody did i lose somebody this person here was filled by god are you there but when god strike himself eternity become a hollow the hand that was filling the the glove becomes so small until the glove is flabby because god needed space so he shrunk himself into a seed so he can have space in eternity now eternity is empty now with a pillar of fire circling and the pillar of fire is god shrunk into a seed and that seed is the logos which is the word of god in the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was [Applause] hallelujah so when god shrank himself he opened the law of contrast you okay everybody okay are we still coming keep your seat belt i'm gonna tell you when we're gonna get in a correct altitude are we okay god open up the law of contrast are you there the law of contrast if you have a positive you have water if you have a bowl you have water if you have night you have water are you are you there so god the pillar of fire becomes the positive because he shrunk himself and by shrinking himself he created a negative pressure in other words in the center right here it's plus all around becomes negative he needed something to feel it eternity is now empty are you there then from this pillar of fire here god with that space available now you follow me god has a big plan you follow me he needed space then he shrank himself god but everything that was written in the paper is right in it everything there so when he had free vacant space then he begin to create because now there is space he was feeling eternity he shrunk he created an empty space then he says let there be the earth let there be pluto let there be jupiter let there be this let there be this then eternity begin to get filled with planets hallelujah if ashtan had only had the spiritual application as he had defused the physical application as he studied the law of water god is right and so forth he could have told us something but brother when i heard his message on that great water that pillar of fire i stand so the pillar of fire in the midst of all eternity anybody clear center in the sky that ever contacted with that center you could do water do what and the power won't be water so this man albert einstein when he was studying universe he saw a light standing in the middle and when he studied he came up with a conclusion that if you ever get a contact with that light you can create water and you can be unlimited and i know one person who got in contact with that light until when they took a picture of him that light was hanging on top of him that's why he could create squirrel [Applause] hallelujah brother brother continued he says they are going to find out someday that they are not seeing 150 million years of space either they are going right around in the water you understand now you are going to find out one of this day that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere you are still well right here just into another water that is faster than water what they call light years they just going into a water because when they leave the earth they begin to look at the planet that's the emptiness that elohim shrank himself and was feeling but it's all a circle are you there so he created a negative pressure all around him because in him was filled with attribute so he wanted to release the attribute but there was no space so he have to shrink himself and then out of him he begin to release his attribute and his attribute begin to fill eternity now there are two attributes that we want to know here when we're dealing with the second death one attribute is the wrath of god the second attribute is the mercy of god these attributes have been the main king of the story of redemption these attributes have been even the beginning and the end of the zodiac the wrath of god spoke about his nature as a lionel and the mercy spoke about his nature as the lamb that's why when john was crying who is worthy to take the book and to break the seal they said john behold the lion of the tribe of judah when he turned he saw water he can be a lion mlm are you following me the two end of the zodiac the virgin and the lion er barkian this attribute this nature caused god to have two kinds of seed you okay he created the children of wrath because he must express himself in the attribute as a rough and angry god are you there god was a lion he must have something that will cause him to act like a lion if god is a savior they must be a sinner so that god can express his salvation if god is a healer somebody needs to get sick so god can act as a healer if god has an anger somebody must be there so that god can demonstrate his anger if god has mercy somebody must be there so god can display his mercy through that person so we gave the children of wrath and the children of mercy take romans 9. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you see why the devil fought me allow me time you're gonna know who you are romans chapter 9 verse 11. if you dare you can say amen for the children being not yet to utter if they were not born where were they the children being not yet born hallelujah neither having done any water because when you do something good you have a tendency to say i did good so i deserve this if somebody did something bad you say yes god need to whip him because he did something bad god removed that from you you didn't do good if the bible said you didn't do evil you're gonna say yes i never seen that's what the young ruler came he said i listened i did all the law he thought he can have eternal life are you there jesus gave him a different bullet to show him that you were not qualified for it even though you follow the law it doesn't depend on you i hope i'm not talking to serpenty that's why moses can kill somebody and they pick him up amen and he saw for what seems to be a small mistake they kicked him out yet he was the one bringing food every day the other one was lazy none done evil or good that the purpose of god not your decision the purpose of god according to water election must stand not of water that's what israel missed but of him the water so just make sure he's the one that called me hallelujah he was saying to the younger it was said to her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob has outdone water and eso have had on water were they born yet why do you hate them hallelujah what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid for he says to moses i will have water on whom i will have mercy and i will have water on whom i will have water so the mercy of god where is where did i put it the mercy of god work with his compassion the mercy of god goes with his compassion watch now hallelujah so then it is not of him that will nor of him that runs but of god that shows what remember mercy over there it depends on who god revealed himself as a lamb are you there for the scripture says or to pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised you up that i must show my power in you so they created pharaoh to show the power of god was that power in pharaoh to save him or to destroy him are you there my power in you that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore has he mercy on him he will have her mercy and whom he will harden he will do what he will gonna on you you will say then to me why does he find fault in other words why does god condemn people then for who has resisted his will he's the creator so why does he condemn people nay but all men who are you to reply against god shall they fix form say to him that from him why have you made me dust has the powder pow has not the powder power over the clay of the same lamp to make one vessel of water and another of water that's why paul said do not treat your wife like a vessel of what amen watch now verse 22 what if god willing to show his water are you okay now willing to show his wrath and to make his power known and do which much long suffering the vessel of water feed it for what so in this earth you okay now these tests oh the children of satan are vessels of wrath god created them to demonstrate his nature as a lion and to make known his power and it's a vessel that is destinated for destruction burning are you okay now 23 and that he might make know the water reaches of his glory on the vessel of water so the wheat are vessels of mercy god want to show his glory the whole history the whole field the world filled with two seed are you there vessel of mercy which he before prepare for water to glory even us who he has called not of the jews only but also of the water so these vessels were prepared for glory and some vessels were prepared for destruction everybody okay these vessels of wrath here have the head which is satan and the other one the head which is crushed take john chapter 8. my god i'm going 35 miles an hour 37 if you dare you can say amen john 8 37 you there few pages going on i know that you are abraham water but you seek to kill me because my water has no place in water these jew by nature they were the seed of abraham but when jesus looked in them there was no space to receive the word of god so the children of wrath can be religious they can be religious and in them there is no space for the world i'm reading the scripture never say the pastor say anybody clear i know that you are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you so you can take the word and when you put there he bounced back because they were programmed not to receive it there is not a compartment that can fit that help me lord hallelujah i speak that which i have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your work how many fathers do we have who is your father who is your father your father will determine whether you're going to be burned or you're going to be for glory depending on your id your bloodline we okay then answer and say to him the answer and say to him abraham is our father in other words they're going to abraham look how jesus pulled them up from there in other words remove your claim from abraham i know abraham abraham is our father jesus said to them if you were abraham children you would have do the works of water another word even though you choose your spiritual gene is not from abraham what was the work of abraham because abraham did not do any work he was bi are you there job to verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham abraham could not kill me you do the deeds of your water who's that father jesus help me then say that to him we be not born in furniture of fornication we have one father even who let's see if they're the children of god jesus said to them if god were your father you will do what for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came out of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my water even because you cannot hear my water there is no decoding of language there is no translator are you there watch now the auto the origin you are of your father who and the last of your father you would do he was a murderer from the beginning king and about not in truth because there is no truth in what so for you to remain in truth there must be truth in you relax and you're going to see what you have in you even when you are a sinner wait if i can get there everybody there when they speak when he speaks he's a liar he speak on his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not everybody clear job 24 47 he that is of god his water you therefore hear them not because you are not of who so to hear the word of god is a son that you a child of god hallelujah mercy let's talk about mercy and let me see and you he has quickened a vision and we're dead in trespasses and sin are you there wearing in time past ye walk according to the course of this world according to the priest of the power of the earth the spirit does not work in the children of water so this vessel of wrath are children of disobedience they are programmed to disobey among whom also we all had our paul water saying here that you are not children of disobedience you are just among the children of disobedience hallelujah among whom also we all heard our conversation in the tempest in the last of our flesh fulfilling the desire of deflation of the man and where by water shooting of water by birth it seems that god can destroy you but not god cannot destroy you the jews looks like god we love them when god looked at them he said you are the children of the devil yet they were jesus and we gentile were completely doomed hallelujah but god who is rich in water the vessel of water god who is rich in water in mercy for his great water wherewith he loved that when we were dead in water when he was sinner [Music] hallelujah you are here because your name was placed on the lamb's book of life before there was even a foundation of the world that is exactly right you are a water a spiritual gene of your water a part of god's water you was with jesus warning he was here because he was the water you suffered with him die with him bear with him rose with him now sitting in heavenly blessings with her [Applause] are you there when you are smoking you are a child of god [Music] you don't have to fight with smoking just tell smoking who you are [Music] let me let me leave that you're going to see you don't even have to fight jesus in jesus in jesus christ hallelujah when we were what dead in sin has quickened us together with who because when christ was dying going there other thing you were representing them that's why you can't go to hell because jesus already went to hell for you [Laughter] by grace here water and he has raised up together and makes us sit together in heavenly places in jesus christ that in the edges of water he must show the exceeding riches of water and his water in other words god chose you to show his mercy through you so in the future when we are in heaven he is called he's gonna call david and say david come let me show you brother hamilton you see hamilton he comes from laodicea you see him he's going to show in the future the glory the riches of his glory he said look what i can do i can take them from the out of the marry clay out of the jungle out of the prison house out of the smoking add off the debt for help look what i can do to them displaying his mercy the mystery of the second death that is for we ourselves also wear water sometime water disobedient deceived serving devil lasting pleasure living in water and water hateful and heading water the devil say i got them but mercies say are you there after the kindness and the love of who our savior toward water appear not by water of righteousness which we have done but according to water [Music] according to water mercy why mercy because you are a vessel of mercy according to his water he has water because it's a vessel of mercy he can't help it but show mercy because you are programmed for mercy you are predestinated for mercy you were born for mercy when people die you don't die some people fail you don't fail because you have a different bullet you a different caliber when they shoot the bullet when the bullet come around you it goes this way when you get a gun and accidentally you hit the gun brother greg the nail said i cannot go there i need to go this way the nile begin to flee the flesh yet the nail is stronger than the flesh but it's a flesh of a vessel of mercy hallelujah by washing of regeneration and renewing of water you don't have to force for the holy ghost put your car in neutral the holy ghost was programmed for you which he shed on us abundantly through who our savior that being justified by water we should be made hell according to the hope of water let me see i got a head and i'm not even in half of my sermon hallelujah peter and let according to the water of god the father through sanctification of the spirit and to water because they are there are children of water you can't help it to obey oh my god and sprinkling off the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant what has water began beginning as well you are born again because you are very serious mercy hallelujah on to a lovely hope by the resurrection of jesus from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fed if not water reserved in water for who do you know what they say reserve reserve parking lot nobody can get there in heaven there is a heritage reserve for you [Applause] see stephanie when you go to heaven you're going to see safe fenney here nobody can enter there when you put your fingerprint he said kinky open then you enter it is reserved for you [Applause] [Music] oh my god oh my god i won't be able to get to the vessel of wrath because of the way you're pulling time is going let me get to the end of the vessel of mercy okay because if i go to vessel of wrath you're not gonna food will begin to drop on the floor [Music] hallelujah first king chapter 14 and at that time abaja the son of who who know who jeroboam you know jeroboam right the most wicked king of israel the very bad bad bad bad bad king his name was who jeroboam ahab follow after him now jeroboam has children and a big family and he has a son a bad man and he give birth to a son you there then the son got sick after jehovah and went completely against god so jeroboam called his wife he said i remember the prophet ehr give me the prophecy about the 10 tribes go back to him ask god if god can give mercy so my son can be saved so disguise yourself so his wife disguised herself to go see the prophet because she knew he knew what he did wrong the prophet will automatically blast him so abbadya the son of jeroboam fell sick verse 10 therefore behold now the prophet is talking to the wife of jeroboam he said i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam are you there and we're cut off from jeroboam he that pieces against the wall that means a man are you there and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as men taketh away they down till it begun so the complete house of jeroboam is spoken to be destroyed killed amen he that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dog eat and him that dive to the field shall the fall of the air eat for the lord has spoken so if you are from the family of jeroboam if you die in the city the dog will eat you if you die in the field you know the bird will go so in other words they won't bury you but when god was giving judgment there was something about this child of jeroboam though he was born from a wicked man when god begin to place judgment in the house of jeroboam next kill him next kill him this in the field kill him listen god reached the last one he looked at the young god the refrain [Music] what is what was in that child that stop god you ready eras therefore get deep to their own house and when the feet enter into the city the child shall do what this baby will die okay and all israel shall do water i thought everybody is gonna die like dogs good dogs gonna eat them and birds are gonna eat them but this one stop you must give honor to this one because he is a vessel of water honor the seal of mercy and honor you can put him like that stop on this one everybody this one lucifer in the field this one lucifer let's see this one lucifer over there this one this one the judgment is too strong i can't lose this one even if i'm going no no if i let him grow up he might end up this way so i need to retrieve him quickly now because i don't want to lose him so when you retrieve him make sure they understand he's not like the other give him all israel shall mourn for him and do what the only one that could be buried was that child why is a special care given to this boy for he only of the of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in water there is found something water toward water of israel in the house of water it was a child but in that shard when god looked he said this is me pull him this is me there is something in that boy that is different than the other that's my child when the angels were placing seed they put one in the house of jeroboam god was coming with judgment he said an angel put one day come on out here get him out there there was something in that child that when god look what was that thing hallelujah as the eternal logos i'm going to head to the airport god was manifested in the sun and in jesus dwell all the fullness of the godhead badly and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained a title of what that's jesus even so we eternal in his thought in our turn became the many members spoken word water manifested in flesh and those eternal touch now manifested in flesh our water even as we are also we are so-called we did not become seed by the rivers being born again does it make you a child of god the new birth only confirmed to you that you are a child of god it's a seal it's a confirmation are you there we were seed and therefore we were reborn so only the elect can be water because we were water is the reason we could be white in non-seed there is water because the vessel of wrath are you there it shows plainly the predestinated is the only one that is considering redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that is considering redemption people might be making like think they are but the real redemption is those that are water because the very word redeem means water to redeem anything is bringing back to its water hallelujah so it's only the predestination will be brought back because the other didn't come from water hallelujah so were you sons of god and daughters of god before there was even a moon star or a molecule you were sons and daughters of god for you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in god at the beginning for there is only one form of eternal life and that was who who is eternal life are you still doubting you still doubting yourself you still doubting wait i'm gonna help you in the image of god you was made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of god and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in who before you are an expression of the attribute of his thought before the foundation of the hallelujah john 10 but ye believe not because you are not of my what as i said unto you my sheep do what and i know them and they will water and i give unto them
