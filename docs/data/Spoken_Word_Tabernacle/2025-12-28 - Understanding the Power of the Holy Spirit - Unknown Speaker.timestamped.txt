[0:06] We had a wonderful service
[0:08] &gt;&gt; this Wednesday. Amen.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit came down
[0:13] &gt;&gt; and some of you received the Holy Ghost.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; On Wednesday,
[0:20] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Lord open up a door
[0:24] to outpour the Holy Ghost on someone.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; And it was a wonderful service.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Because brother Tony was used by God to
[0:37] come straight with a sermon that is
[0:39] called receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was a special grace
[0:46] by God that brought the Holy Spirit.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't come only with a
[0:55] sermon that is called HOLY GHOST.
[0:59] [Applause]
[1:02] AMEN.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MESSAGE BELIEVER are used to
[1:07] tradition.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; They were here. We have to preach. WHAT
[1:11] IS THE HOLY GHOST?
[1:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE HOLY GHOST GIVEN FOR? HOW
[1:15] DO YOU RECEIVE IT? And we need TO MAKE A
[1:17] LONG PRAYER line to LAY HAND ON THE
[1:20] PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME ON THE WEDNESDAY AND
[1:26] BROUGHT THE HOLY GHOST. THE HOLY GHOST
[1:29] IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN EVERY SERMON.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:39] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:42] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THIS. I WAS TALKING TO MY
[1:44] WIFE ABOUT THIS. THE BIBLE SAYS in the
[1:46] book of John chapter 6 verse 63, he say
[1:50] it is the what?
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Spirit

[1:53] &gt;&gt; That quickenth.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; The flesh does what?
[1:55] &gt;&gt; PROFERETH NOTHING. THE WORDS THAT I
[1:58] SPEAK UNTO YOU,
[1:59] &gt;&gt; not the written word.
[2:02] [Applause]
[2:04] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. NOT THE WRITTEN
[2:07] WORD.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; YOU TRADITIONALIST.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; NOT THE WRITTEN WORD.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; THE LETTER.
[2:17] [Applause]
[2:21] NOT THE WORD THAT IS WRITTEN, BUT THE
[2:24] WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU,
[2:26] &gt;&gt; THE SPOKEN WORD, THE SERMON, THE
[2:30] PREACHING, THE TEACHING,

[2:37] WHEN A MINISTER IS ANOINTED AND HE BEGIN
[2:41] TO PREACH THE WORD THAT IS COMING UP OFF
[2:46] THE PASTOR
[2:47] BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER THE PASTOR, IT IS
[2:50] GOD THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER THE VESSEL.
[2:54] WHEN THE WORD IS COMING OUT,
[2:58] &gt;&gt; THOSE WORD THEY ARE WHAT?
[3:00] &gt;&gt; SPIRIT.

[3:14] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU ARE WHAT?
[3:17] &gt;&gt; SPIRIT
[3:17] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[3:18] &gt;&gt; LIFE. SO WHERE IS THE SPIRIT AND THE
[3:20] LIFE?
[3:22] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE WORD IS COMING,

[3:38] YOU ARE RECEIVING GOD.
[3:43] [Applause]
[3:45] WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING IN THE
[3:48] ANOINTED WORD OF THE HOUR.

[3:53] &gt;&gt; YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE, YOU RECEIVE THE
[3:56] WORD THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN. THAT WORD GOT
[4:00] THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND HE GOT THE LIFE OF
[4:03] GOD INSIDE.

[4:10] UP ABOVE PENTECOSTAL. I'M RAISING YOU UP
[4:13] ABOVE LAYING ON HAND.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD IS BEEN PREACHED, YOU
[4:18] DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AT THE END
[4:20] &gt;&gt; TO PRAY FOR THE HOLY GHOST.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE HOLY
[4:24] GHOST THROUGH BROTHER TONY, ALL YOU HAVE
[4:27] TO DO IS STAND UP
[4:29] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "LORD, I RECEIVE IT."
[4:32] [Applause]
[4:36] [Music]
[4:40] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[4:43] &gt;&gt; THIS IS BEYOND SENSATION.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO RECEIVE
[4:48] THE WORD THAT WAY
[4:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SENSATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE
[4:53] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY
[4:55] AROUND UPON YOUR FEELING. I DON'T FEEL
[4:59] GOD TODAY. I FEEL ANOINTED. I DON'T FEEL
[5:02] ANOINTED. WE DON'T WANT THAT.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; WHETHER I FEEL GOD OR NOT, I KNOW GOD IS
[5:08] IN ME. I KNOW GOD IS IN MY LIFE. I CAN
[5:12] WALK WITH GOD. I KNOW HIM.
[5:20] [Applause]
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? OR I FEEL GOOSEBUMP.
[5:27] WHAT ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T feel goosebump?
[5:30] NOW YOU STUCK AND THE DEVIL WILL TELL
[5:32] YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; DEVIL IS NOT IN MY FLESH.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE FIRST POOL.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT IN MY SPIRIT. THAT'S THE
[5:40] SECOND POOL. IT IS SOMETHING WAY BEYOND
[5:44] IN MY SOUL
[5:46] &gt;&gt; THAT AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD FOR MY
[5:49] TIME.
