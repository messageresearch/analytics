work and um know it's Wednesday and um Pain's still there so I got the crutches out and said devil isn't going to keep me home and come with the crutches if I have to and um I just gave it over to the

amen amen I'm sorry I'll make this quick but I'm I'm so encouraged and I feel like God's pushing me to say it amen okay I told Brother Sten like right after that um I've had eczema my whole life really bad when Zach and I met it had cleared up and it had just progressively gotten worse since since now I had it um when we first moved here I thought surely us moving here maybe it'll take some stress off it'll clear up about five times worse it was I couldn't sleep at night I would say I just scratch it my skin would be so dry everything was painful I look like a burn victim you know people were asking me about it they thought it was poison iy they thought it was allergies all over my legs and my arms just painful and with the theme of these last couple months of services you know being healing speaking your healing taking the word and and becoming speaking over um I started doing that I I would just cry to Zach like I just don't understand why it's gotten so bad and he said you know what you need to do you need to just stop complaining about it you need to write down every scripture you can find about healing in your phone and every time it's bothering you you can't sleep at night or it's burning you need to just reread them over and over again and I told Brother Steven that whenever it cleared up I would give a testimony and I'm trying to avoid it cuz I don't like talking go too I talk too much but uh my hands over the last week it's completely gone on my hands every day every day for the last two or three weeks and I mean every day I would moisturize I would shower and every single day multiple times a day I would just say thank you Jesus for my I'm I'm completely healed I would talk to my skin saying you're healed in Jesus name I'm waiting for it to be completely healed on my ankles it's almost completely gone glory to God amen amen we have one more testimony amen hallelujah I am so happy because Sunday after the Ser one of the one of the four point was remember me remember the main thing so as the Holy Ghost was telling us about us the the last one remember me was kind of um really touches me so I heard in my heart there is two REM there is to remember me there is the one the Lord is asking you to remember him but there is also another of the F on the cross asking for the Lord to remember him so I said father remember me you want me to remember you but remember me too because you know I told my husband like two weeks ago I saw the Lord Jesus I know the Bible say I will be with you the world the world will not see me but you shall see me so you can see the Lord in Vision I have to say that so I saw the Lord he was standing there but before the Lord there were two two men talking to him they were they were wearing white clothes they were before him but the Lord was focusing on me the two men was were like here but the Lord was here looking at me over there instead of focusing on them he was looking at me so when I I came I came back to myself I told my husband oh the Lord is looking at me but he has people before him what's the meaning of it so I told my husband when the two Prophet are coming are there going to be adult baby or what because something is telling you like that before he deal with them you need to deal with us the bride so he's looking at me but these people here are pressing him like they want to go so I felt like we have to prepare for the coming of the Lord so I was telling God I said father remember me remember my children remember my husband I was there praying because I I I knew that the Lord is is about to do something I knew for sure so I was praying like that I prayed I pray I finished praying I went outside it was like Jesus waiting for me at the door sister Ed start talking to me Isaac will be fine L will be fine you you start talking to me like the things I was praying there I knew what I was telling the Lord so I knew was Jesus telling me don't worry hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and amen amen amen amen amen so brother Charles amen amen we just want to bless the name of the Lord amen and also bring before the Lord our tithes and our offerings amen two minutes that's possible devil been fighting me week and all day I mean I have class have the training and all day long I'm leaving out of class because well this accident you know um we got to reach out to this this uh insurance insurance representative they're calling me from work now we have a u a job site superintendent he's calling me from he's calling me from work hey they don't have these manholes covered now it's just me that bringing on somebody else but it's 320 or 30 between 320 350 employees and it's just me so then after that getting ready to leave they called me they said Charles somebody uh was digging up a tree with an excavator and it came through the window so I did what I had to do he was all right and everything then soon I'm on my way home and I already prepared because we got out of class late so I'm on my way home and my wife I told my wife okay while I'm on my way home and so forth and here come they called me again they said Charles they just turned the truck over I said okay where where did they turn the truck over at Davis Village and that's in Wind gate so I said all right I called my wife said sweetheart I ain't gonna make it um just go ahead so when I got to the site did everything I had to do soon as I um they asked me to take the gentleman back and it was on the way here so I said Lord I'm going soon as I get soon as I almost get here I hit

rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ and I never stopped just roll just roll just roll just roll and then just before I got here the devil well in the middle of that the devil started talking to me you know you going to be late late I said well if I'll be late I said I don't care if they getting ready to pray and leave out I'm going to come in and Get My Worship in at least a little bit you know

worship service tonight and the praise service and amen what a blessing Amen to come to the house of the Lord and amen I'll tell you there's a lot of prophecy on that third day isn't there amen if you ever run that through the scripture that's a powerful that's a powerful thought it's I think it's the third day that when Joshua raised up and went over the Jordan wasn't it and it was in the third day do you know that's the that's the day of the Jewish wedding is the third day it's it's because that it was in the third day that life was created the first time and that that third day is a powerful powerful thing I think that's when Esther went in after the golden scepter it was on that third day and it was in the book of Hosea he said in the third day amen I'll revive you amen I certainly believe tonight amen that it was the third day wasn't it when Jesus come out of the Tomb but the third day had a morning and it had an evening and in the morning of the third day there was in isua Street Holy Ghost fell and the prophet of God said they had a rumor that he was alive that's right but in the evening time he proved he was alive amen and we're in the evening of the third day amen amen when they went into that little room amen that tent of meeting they went in that little room and there the Vindication of the Resurrection was made known among them and I believe in the evening time amen it has become light amen God bless you all it's certainly beig good to hear tonight and amen the thing about a third day is it can be a third day can be a third whenever you start counting right so if it's on Friday it's a Sunday and if it's on Sunday it's a Tuesday that's right that's the reason that an eighth day can also be a third day that's and it could be a sixth day or seventh day amen it's however God counts them amen whatever he counts it's this day it's this day one more you remember in the Matthew 24 Jesus said to them they said Lord When shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and do you know that actually happened on a Tuesday Afternoon brother Bram said in the morning he answered one of them questions was asked but in the evening Tuesday I think it was April the 3 he said he sat down with them and told them the rest of those answers so in the third day come the answers yes sir and brother Bram said see it was right there that every seal was in Matthew 24 he said but the seven seal wasn't written can we unveil you something it was the one talking and he speaks himself on the third day and answers all the questions I believe this is the hour for it don't you I believe this is the time for it amen I want to say greetings to you tonight from True Word Tabernacle and our church at home and all the saints there we send our love and greetings to you all and brother Steph God bless you we so appreciate what you're doing here and the and the blessing amen I know brother stevenh shares the same vision I share somebody asked me said brother Wayne what's your vision for the church you know you start pastor and people want to know what your vision is what's your vision for the church I said Rapture amen amen my vision is Rapture it's not it's not a bigger church it's not an organization amen I want to obtain the resurrection amen amen amen and how are we going to get there there's only one path the message of the hour amen a path that'll lead you to the changing of your bodies yes sir and if we're going to walk a path what kind of atmosphere is it going to be winter time or is it going to be I tell you we want an atmosphere of the Supernatural That's the kind of atmosphere we want and we see that atmosphere here tonight amen we want to say thank you all for the lovely welcome and and we sure love you all with our hearts we think finally of you we drove a long ways to preach to you and so we just pray that the Lord would bless you and and would speak something to you we want to thank you brother Steven for the invitation to come amen and if we can tonight let's turn in our Bibles to the book of Ephesians the 2 chapter amen amen I have been uh in the book of Ephesians for quite a little while at home and uh I certainly believe that this is the New Testament Joshua amen which would be exactly uh where we are as a church amen in the book of Ephesians amen a positioning of the church in Ephesians chapter 2 and I want to read the 19th down to the 22nd verse amen now therefore you are No More Strangers yes sir and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God Amen and are built upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord Lord amen in whom ye also yes sir are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit amen uh if we could just B our hearts tonight almighty God we thank you we thank you for the atmosphere here tonight for the for the liberty of your word Lord and we so thank you for the blessing of this congregation we thank you for brother stepen Lord to hold a place for the message here here in this place and we're asking you now tonight Lord as we Endeavor to speak to them may you help us oh God and may you be the voice that's behind the voice may you speak to the need of your children God and as we would Minister in your word we invite you and we ask you for these things now in Jesus name amen and amen may God bless you tonight as you're seated amen if I would take a title tonight I want to speak to you on holy habitations holy habitations amen uh this is a beautiful uh book to me the book of Ephesians uh it's the New Testament book of Joshua amen which lets us realize amen that it was a book of positioning brother Bram tells us that this is not an Evangelical book this book is much like second Peter chapter 1 when Peter begins to uh talk about the Statue of a perfect man remember he begins it and he says a Brethren of like Precious faith and the prophet said see he begins it like Paul Begins the Ephesians this is not to people coming to the Holy Ghost this is people who already have the Holy Ghost amen and they're being positioned in the church by the word amen isn't it something the word positions the church Church in their appropriate places amen and we find that here amen that Paul has come through the first chapter which is a powerful chapter I wish I could preach the old chapter to you tonight but I can't amen but you see he moves through this whole chapter and then he begins the second chapter by saying to you that you who he hath quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins and in times Past walk so Paul Begins the second chapter speaking to these Ephesians amen who have brought into to the things of God and he spent the whole first part of the Ephesians trying to minister to them upon this but now he comes and tells them what God has actually done for them it's something that has already happened but now he's explaining to them the grace that has been shed toward their lives and while he's doing this it's amazing because if you're reading the scriptures uh you it's it's amazing because this is where brother bam brings uh uh Easter seal you who have quickened he brings a rising of the sun you who ha quickened and he's speaking of spiritual Resurrection taking place in the church and when he gets down to it he said God who is rich in Mercy and that's another title of a prophet he said which what is showing you is he says watch Israel was carried to their promised land on the wings of an eagle and he said there was many impersonators that tried to follow them but they were swallowed up by the Red Sea he said but the reason it couldn't swallow Israel was because they were following a message they were being packed On Eagle's Wings amen and so is the Church of the Living God being packed on Eagles Wings being packed according to scripture now he said we have bore thee On Eagle's Wings and he said I have brought you unto myself so where is the church coming to they're coming to their positions in God this message is packing you past uh your ideas and it's packing you past just good church membership and it's packing you to Christ it's bringing you to himself the thought he had of you before the world ever began that's where you're going back to you're going back to the mind of God Amen because he had you on his mind it's amazing to me that when Paul begins to WR write about this he begins to show the grace that has been given unto us and calls us the workmanship of almighty God we're very the creation of God the bride of Christ being the creation of God and he said now remember this you were all G Iles and you were called uncircumcision of them that were circumcision he said matter of fact you were without God in this world amen amen you were without God in this world and not only were you without God the Bible tells us that you were foreigners to the Commonwealth of Israel and you were strangers and had no rights in the very sanctions of almighty God am it's amazing to me sometimes when you begin to study the scripture and you get in the Old Testament and you realize that what we're enjoying tonight and the blessings we're enjoying the Bible itself in the days of Moses pre prevented a gentile from coming into the house of God exact they could burn in sense they couldn't have blood they couldn't make sacrifices God has called us aliens he called us enemies can you imagine being the enemy of God and being a stranger of God but Paul says but ye who were strangers and ye who were foreigners you were who far off are made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen and every scripture and every ordinance what was against you Paul said he nailed it to the Cross that's exactly and he abolished in the cross every scripture that would hold the church out of the presence of God and then he began to say to them that you're No More Strangers you're no more foreigners amen but your fellow citizens of the household of God God put you in his houseen amen and God's provided place of worship brother B said you're in the household of God now you're under his name and you have been built under the foundations of the Apostles and the prophets now when you start talking about this build upon the foundations of the Apostles and the prophets brother B actually ties this scripture to Revelation 3 and verse 12 for he that cometh will I make a pillar in the temple of God and he shall go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God yes sir and the name of the city of my God Amen what's the name of my God Jesus what is the name of the city of my God the New Jerusalem which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God I will ride upon them my new name amen now it's just amazing cuz brother bam ties this a pillar is a foundation it is a temple of the household of God the Temple of my God the house of my God it's a pillar SE a foundation now brother bam takes this word and ties it to Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 19 he says see he that overcometh will I make him a pillar in other words a part of the foundation that's exactly right what will I give him I will put in him the doctrine amen of the Apostles and prophets from the beginning and give him the Revelation sir he will put in them the doctrine of what Paul taught in the Ephesian age he will put that Doctrine in the church let me let me just say this to you once it's put in you you can't get it out of youen Amen once the doctrine of this message ever reaches your heart it can never be taken out of you it can be put on your body it'll come out it be put on your spirit it'll come out but if this word ever reaches the soul of the Church of the Living God you'll never get it out of them brother amen once Revelation breaks into that Soul it becomes a part of them it is the marriage of the Lamb it is a part of them it becomes a part of who you are amen what is it I will give to him I will put my doctr yes sir glory to God sorry I can't hardly preach with this here cold on amen you see what it is he said I'll put him him the doctrine in other words brother Ram says in another place he says I will give him in other words a part of the foundation I will give him I will put the doctrine the apostles and prophets in him and give him the levation yes sir my goodness I will put in him the foundation of my word amen in the household of God I'll put him in as a pillar you may see he'll stay with that word now watch him because he also says what is it it's he's the pillar and he ain't going out no more amen I tell you what once that word get in there there's no way to get it out of there amen you take a drop of water and put it in a glass of wine and then you get the water out of that wine for me there's no way once it becomes a part of it it's a part of it and once the word becomes a part of you yes and you're a part of the work you'll never separate them you'll never get them apart Paul said it he said nothing shall separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus there ain't nothing that has been able to do it there's nothing that can do it and there's nothing coming that can do it because it's a part of who we are when I think of the grace of God Amen that God himself has designed and desired yes sir Amen to uh make us a part of his household sir and to live in that church as a habitation now Moses himself God started this process much in the days of Moses when he told God God told Moses that he wanted to dwell with his people that's exactly right he told them I want to make a tabernacle I want to make a meeting place that's right I want you to build a tent that's amen and that tent will house my presence among my people yes my brother amen now people say brother Wayne Amen what about that tent Vision I'll tell you what Moses had a tent Vision too so this Prophet had a tent Vision in the old test and a prophet had a tent Vision in a New Testament and they're speaking about the same thing they're talking about the dwelling presence of almighty God it's got to have a house amen and Moses was building this house but what Moses build it upon Moses didn't build it on his ideas no sir can you imagine a man thinking up a way to house God a man trying to make a habitation for God uh but according to the scriptures in Hebrews 8 Paul said we serve under the example and the shadow of heavenly things Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle and he saith thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount in Hebrews 923 he said if is therefore necessary patterns of things in Heavens should be purified with these but Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these so the things that was built upon the Earth were pattering what Moses had saw in the Heavens amen when Moses build it upon the Earth he was pattering a human being amen he was showing you a human being in a tabernacle he was making it by skins the same way God would make a bride of skins he was making a tabernacle of skins and he was building it upon the pattern that's why there were three different Realms of that old Tabernacle amen that three was the outer Court the inner court and the holies of holies is that right amen and so is there a body a soul and a spirit of man there is three different Realms of the Tabernacle there are three Realms of the of the of the human being because God's Throne was not ever meant to be in a building it was only a pattern of what God was going to do in the future he was going through a pattern amen it was Moses that built it amen and Moses built that pattern and it was an original pattern David later seeing this this this this Tabernacle that traveled through the Wilderness with them so it wasn't a a permanent Dwelling Place it was a a traveling place but I tell you something that's powerful to me amen wherever that tent went the presence went with it amen wherever the tent went the presence went with it it was showing you I'm that rock that was in the wilderness and I never left the I'm the I'm the presence that was in the tent and I never left the amen if he did it in the shadow he's going to do do it in the Perfection if he didn't leave a tent how much more will he never leave this bride because she is his Tabernacle and this tent do you see amen it was Moses that built that it was Moses built that Tabernacle and Along come David and he saw that the word of God dwelt in a tent he said oh I that my God would dwell in the tent of a man he said I'd like to have him my house of Cedar I i' I'd like to build him a house I I I'd like to make him a place on the earth that he could live Nathan the prophet heard it and said oh what a powerful desire that you have David do all that is in thine heart and later he comes and says wait a minute David you can't build this kind of house too much blood's on your hands he said but I'll take your son amen and I'll use him and I'll make a tabernacle and I'll use the son of David to build a temple here in Jerusalem that I would dwell in that Temple now when Solomon gets ready to build a tabernacle he don't go look for new plans folks amen he takes exactly what Moses had already built and brought it up and built it in that Holy place that Tabernacle he built the same thing amen but he just buil it in a different place oh God this message will work anywhere as you take it it'll build a church in Gastonia it'll build a church in blon Ohio it'll build a church in Africa in India in South America this pattern is the pattern of almighty God you don't need another pattern we don't need an organization we've got the message of the hour and oh it's the pattern of God God sets a pattern and amen we can have that pattern you know the difference in the five and foolish virgins don't you amen the five wise virgins fit in the pattern of God my my my my do you see it was Solomon that was going to build him a house amen and but Solomon himself in First Kings chapter 18 and 27 he said can God dwell on the earth what a question can God can God dwell on the earth amen I'll tell you what it was when Isaiah spoke it in Isaiah 66 it was Isaiah said thus saith the Lord for the heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol but where is the house that you build me and to where is the place of my rest in other words the god that created the heavens amen and has the Earth as a foot what kind of house could you build him that he would be satisfied what kind of house could a person build God that he could find rest in that house does God dwell on the earth does God dwell in houses does God dwell that way oh there's got to be a resting place there's got to be a place for God my when Jesus came upon the Earth he was the true son of David and he said I'm going to build a house he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it I say this 2,000 years ago that was prophecy but this morning this afternoon it's not prophecy no more I say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your midst Christ the mystery he said he has achieved a church that the fullness of God can come into God has built a church that there is not one word of this Bible That's not welcome on the inside Hallelujah brother you don't know what that meant people said brother Wayne what's God looking for what kind of bride is God looking for one which stays with the word he's had every kind he's had every kind of bride but he's never had that one he's never had a bride that would just stay with the word but there's coming another Eve there's coming a bride who cannot fall from this word she will stay she will stay he has achieved a church that the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days that's a big that's a big that's a big word cuz you you know I don't want to get on off track but you know you know that God created Adam out of himself that's right amen amen God created the Earth and he planted the Earth with his seed and it was his garden but God gave adam Eve to bring forth his garden but the devil got in that garden and she couldn't bring forth only Adam seed but in the end time there's another bride who has been given as a garden of God that can bring every promise Church of the Living God every promise if you say under this mountain be moved this is an hour of Mountain Moving Faith this is an hour of spoken word faith this is an hour where every promise God has made has been given to this church yes I will build a church well let me say Amen here she is can you imagine in John when Philip looked and said show us the Father and Jesus said have I been so long with you and you have not known me people today are saying where's the bride where's the bride I say have we been so long with you and you don't know who we are amen oh when you can say I and my father are one that's when the seed separates from the Shu you come out in the light of the son of man there enough heed on this message to make you identify with your former thought of you what God thought of you that was some denomination or some man-made religion thought of you a church built upon the word of God upon the doctrine of Apostles and Prophets hey it's an achievement and I say praise God they sent somebody to the moon and they're happy about it well let me tell you that ain't near the achievement as it is God to get a church that'll stay on the word of God amen amen he's achieved a church amen amen he's achieved one Amen in Acts chapter 7 it was it was Steven that preached that great sermon yes sir our fathers had the Tabernacle in the wilderness and had been pointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen that's right and also our fathers that came and brought in Jesus the possession of the Gentiles whom God drove out before the face of our fathers under the days of David that's right who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob amen but Solomon build him a house but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophets that's Isaiah Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me saith the Lord what is the place of my rest yes sir now let's pick up Paul from Hebrews chapter 10 wherefore he cometh into the world and he saith sacrifice an offering thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me now brother random does Something Beautiful in stature of the perfect man he comes along and he reads the book of Acts where Stephen is preaching to them and he says my God don't dwell in houses made with hands that's right what kind of what kind of house could you build him that he would be at peace with that he would love to be in amen that he would dwell in and he would want to be in that he would be pleased to dwell in now now the brother BR says see but in here in Hebrews chapter 10 amen it's Paul that says a body thou Hast prepared so brother B says see Paul is answering or Paul is telling you what house it is the Temple of the Old Testament was only a type of a body prepared for God now it was spoken down there on the river with our lord Jesus in this I pleased to dwell in him I'm pleased to dwell he was pleased to rest in the Son of God but that same God was manifest in Jesus Christ he built a body he made his body thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was God above us amen it was God With Us amen amen now it's God in us the same God the same God that's right Amen brother B says it like this Solomon build him a temple but the how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foottoo what house will you build me heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol How Could You bu build me a house to dwell in the god of Jacob now you're going to build something that he's going to want to come and live now look some of us have a hard time building a house though that somebody wants to live in are you with me amen a a a place that somebody wants to live in and he's saying now we're talking about God is going to want to live there amen how are we going to build that kind of thing he says see when this body has been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed that was then coming forth God come to his own body which is his bride oh and after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ he sent back the Shak glory to come upon the church just like he did in Solomon's Tabernacle when the word went in the sockets the glory of God filled house and here we are on the day of Pentecost brother R says 120 Believers were up there for dedication oh my goodness and God came down in the Shak of glory and filled the house where they were sitting like the ark dropping into proper sockets the message of that day listen to me the Ark found its proper place it's the message of the day hallelujah amen it proper sockets for the message of that day God dropped back into a proper Channel not into a denomination not into a building made with hands but into the heart of man oh the heart of man God dropped into proper channels God in proper channels God in his Tabernacle God not a denomination not an organization but in the heart of a word believing bride the Shak light the same Glory that filled the Tabernacle the same Glory that filled the tents of Moses would fill the heart of a Believer now not in the house that God dwells in see it's not a building with a big Bell on top but a body that thou H has prepared a body that God can dwell in that God can walk in come on church God don't want to dwell he wants to walk a body that God can walk in a body that God can see in a body that God can talk in amen that God can work in a living instrumentality God walking on two feet Hallelujah when he dwelt in the Tabernacle of Solomon Solomon's Temple couldn't get up and go out and heal the sick Solomon's Temple couldn't raise up from where it was and go down to the Widow's house and save her children oh but there was coming an hour when the Shak of Glory was going to come into a tabernacle that he could walk in talk in living see oh I'm talking about a holy habitations I'm talking about God living in a body I'm talking about your pastor preaching but it ain't ain't the pastor preaching it's God doing the preaching I'm talking about the man of God praying for the sick but it ain't the man of God it's God in his Temple it's God in his body hallelujah it's always been God's intention this is not a new idea this isn't something will and brandom come up with it was in the mind of God before the world ever begin and finally finally we are back to the thought of God we're back to the original thought of God this is not a denominational idea this is not coming out of some school or some encyclopedia it was in the mind of [Applause] God it was there in the tent it was there in the Tabernacle it was there in Jesus it was there in the upper room and tonight here it is in the flesh of the Bride tent [Applause] Visions Hallelujah God is walking on two feet well I know I know you got all them thoughts about you but you know what Paul set it up before he got there and he said you that were without God you that were strangers you that were held out of God by the ordinances he has attacked them up on the cross you said preacher how are we worthy to do what you're saying because of the Cross because of the Cross he took out every reason that you couldn't do it tonight he took every excuse away from you that you can't Tabernacle God Amen but God wants a holy [Applause] [Music] habitation brother BR puts it in the scripture he said for the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of God God walking for you are written Epistles read of all men it's the Life of Christ in you oh my what the Bible does tell us statue of the perfect man brother bam says it very beautifully as a body th H has prepared me God dwells in the stature of a man you're looking for him up in heaven you're looking for him in the cloud but God dwells in a man it's a statue of a man reflecting himself in that being listen you don't pray God down I tell you what a prophet said he said we're not praying God down he said because God's in you he said all you'd have to do is start surrendering and you would see a display of God in your own flesh can you imagine God acting in your body hallelujah hallelujah God in the stature of a man it's heresy brother Wayne Paul said the way of heresy is the way that I worship the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I don't worship God in a stone Idol it's a living God manifesting himself God reflecting himself into that being perfect worship perfect worship God in us his Tabernacles God manifest so brother Wayne what's perfect worship when God gets in you that's perfect worship come on Church what did zerubabel do in the days amen of zachari he built the Tabernacle back to the place where they could have worship perfect worship worship restored the seventh seal brought perfect worship the seven seal brought Christ back to the Earth come on Church you know it's the message she is him tabernacling deity temples of deity come on Church go God is Not Just mechanics he's also Dynamics he is the Living Word and when the word is living in you that's not you that lives the word that's God in you that lives the word I know what the devil's done he's took every nasty thing that's ever happened in your life and he's tried to put shame on you and tell you that you could never come to the glory of God Amen oh but I want to remind the devil tonight not of your shame I want to tell him about your glory the glory you have before the world ever began when the glory come in the Tabernacle it was only speaking of how God one day would come and Tabernacle in this bride [Applause] Hallelujah perfect worship I'm talk about perfect worship God and man become one it's not a stone Idol it's not an organizational idea it's not a theology it's not a Doctrine it's the person of Christ himself descending in the church yes it's in the scriptures come on he descended through the line of Abraham and in that line was Rahab and Tamar you say God can't use me because I did this and I did that God can't change his mind and if he used Rahab he can use you he chose you when he chose Rahab he chose you when he chose Tamar and here tonight the the Revelation makes clear it's perfect [Applause] worship he already did it tell somebody he did it it ain't what he's going to do he's already did it the devil can't change it folks we already have rapturing Grace the seal has already opened the Thunders have already sounded Christ is already here it's the mystery of his coming it's the Bride of Jesus Christ come on that son of man ministry didn't go back to Heaven it's in the church not a first pull not a second pull the third pull [Music] well glory be to God holy habitations not a holy people a holy God living in a [Applause] people we are the people I'm so glad about it tonight I got all the enemies in the world but they couldn't keep him out of me I got critics but they couldn't keep him out of me denominations couldn't keep him out of me because God said I'll come suddenly to my Holy Temple perfect worship is what I'm talking [Applause] about denomination so silly to say we worship a prophet the only Prophet we worship is the man Jesus Christ who is the prophet of all prophets he's a prophet like an unto Moses come on church he was the god of the prophets and if you don't think God still got prophets you don't even know your [Applause] Bible Jesus is a prophet but how could he reveal himself here unless he s a [Applause] prophet and that Prophet had a vision and he begin to build the church with a vision that Vision that Vision actually excluded him from denominations you know why they wanted him to use his gift to build their Church they wanted to take his gift and build up Billy Graham or build up Oral Roberts or build up but he wasn't there to build up no man he was there to exalt Jesus Christ Hallelujah the headship of the body was returning this man only had one job point to him Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world it's Christ the Vindicated word Christ brother B said it he said Christ never sent me to build an organization may I say this tonight if God sent you he didn't send you to build an organization I know I know there's men rising up trying to build their own organizations even around the message get their own click their own group they got their own Apostles they got their own prophets listen let me tell you something there's only one thing going to stand it's this message when this is all done it's this message and I want to make something very clear I'm not here tonight to align myself with any Minister I am here to align myself with the coming of the Lord this message is Christ amen and we're here to stand on the message of the hour and that alone Church will'll take this bride into the Rapture no no no organizations in this

or any other state or any other City our headship is in heaven I'm so sick of that dirty devil trying to take away from the glory of this message and put it on some man somewhere I tell you the message of the hour deserves the glory that God has given in this age [Applause] Christ never sent me to build an organization he said he sent me that we might build powerhouses and Dwelling Places of the Spirit by his word he was s this message supposed to build powerhouses it ain't supposed to be come on church this ain't some Catholic Doctrine where it's a holy man in the pull pit and a bunch of peons in the pews amen I'm one of you and you're one of me this is a body movement of the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is God in our sisters it's God in our pastors it's God in our deacons it's God

no man will ever make you subject to a denomination of spirit if brother I'm an eagle I can't be put in the cage it's an eagle anointing where we fly we fly [Applause] [Music] high if I scared of snakes I'd pick them up till I wasn't scared no more if I scared of spiders I'd play with them till I wasn't scared no more if you're scared to preach a certain part of this message preach it till the fear leaves you Hallelujah preach the word build powerhouses oh yeah see what what what the devil would like to do is bind the preacher with fear and then it binds the people with fear let me give you a direct Prophecy from the word I have not given you the spirit of fear but of love and power and of a sound mind power houses not fearful men built up into powerhouses statues of God holy temples Tabernacles of the most high come on church this is not a Baptist tent this is not a Lutheran tent this is not a oness tent this is a message [Applause] tent built for a [Applause] purpose hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah powerhouses I'm talking about people that's not pushovers I'm talking about people that's put their life on the line we're not playing church we are the church we're not playing games we're the Church of the Living God god well Glory building living Tabernacles living Tabernacles of the Living God to place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God I like that don't you some old dead God moved into me it was a living God 1 Corinthians 3:16 Paul answers the question know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you in 2 Corinthians 6:16 Paul says it clear and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols well that's powerful ain't it I don't ain't got no place in this Temple for you are the Temple of the Living God as God ha said brother I will dwell in them and walk with them and I will be their God and they shall be my people now look at look at Paul if you're reading the First Corinthians 3 you'll see Paul said I'm a master builder and I have built a foundation take careful how you build on this one because we're building the Temple of God look at what what he says and God ha said I will dwell in them now if you're a studier that's Leviticus 2611 and 12 I will set my Tabernacle among thee and my soul shall not abhor Thee I will walk among you and be your God and you shall be my people in Jeremiah 31:33 Paul read these things folks but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and right in their hearts I will be their God and they shall be my people in Ezekiel 37 he said moreover I'll make the Covenant of peace with them I shall be an Everlasting Covenant with them I will place them and multiply them and set My Sanctuary in the midst of them forever more my Tabernacle also shall be with them y I will be their God and they shall be my people as God have said Paul's quoting the Old Testament prophets but he's not just quoting Old Testament prophets Paul's quoting our lord Jesus in Matthew 28:20 Jesus said teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you lo I Am With You Always even till the end of the [Applause] [Music] world in John 14 just before he leaves Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you now Jesus said I'm going to go away and send somebody else but look what he said in the 18th verse but I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more come on sister where you at I heard you where you at a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me but ye shall see me because oh my there's some eyes have amen the eye has been enlightened and you can see the presence of God just cuz other people don't see it don't make it real ask aaza about it and at that day what day and at that day ye shall know I in the father and ye and me and I and you now if you're a Bible reader in John 10 they asked Jesus tell us plainly who it is he said I don't do the works father doeth The Works in me and I am in him and he is in me but in the 14th chapter he adds something to that and said I and him and him and me and I in you and you in me he added you he added you look at this if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and I will come unto him and we will make our abold oh he abides he abides Hallelujah he abides with me what am I talking about not just a coming and going not just a service and go and service and go that's the Old Testament but in the New Testament he was talking about an Abiding Place let's cover that devil up let's put some word on that devil in Romans chapter 8 the Bible says in the ninth verse ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so be the spirit of God dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if the Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness and if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you you of God little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world you might as well go ahead and say it the one living in this house is greater than the one that's in the world it's greater than Temptation it's greater than the diseases of this age it's greater than the sicknesses of this time greater is he greater is he who's he he God I I love David's writings in Psalms 132 and 133 for the Lord hath chosen Zion he have desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it now y'all read the same message I read did brother bandam say that Zion was the bride is that what he said come on now is that what he said that Zion is the bride there was a natural City back there that David was looking at but that wasn't what God was looking at David was looking at a hill and God was looking at a people David was looking at a city God was looking at a body for the Lord hath chosen Zion you have not chosen me I chose you he desired it you know what desire desire desire he he desired now you Brothers It's married now you didn't marry her for her desire it was you you chased her down you dated her you brought the flowers you made the phone calls you sent the text come on you paid for the meals and the dates because you had a desire and God had a desire he desired Zion as his habitation I'll show you in the New Testament in Colossians chapter 1 and 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory of the mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you can I change it the desire of Glory the hope of glory come on it's not your hope it's God's hope it's God's desire it's God's plan it's God's anointing God made all this up before you were ever [Applause] here Christ in you the hope of glory god desired how much did he desire it brother Wayne brother brother Paul just told you here he said God took the ordinances in Colossians chapter one he said he spoiled principalities and powers and nailed them to the Cross to an open chain come on he took every ordinance that said he couldn't have a Tabernacle in Zion and he nailed it to the Cross he took everything that said he couldn't have you and he nailed it to the Cross he abolished it in his own body so that he could have what he wanted the joy that is set before him is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you now there's a lot of things been said about you but let me say something word says about you I have desired Zion as a habitation in Ezekiel 48-35 ezekiel's just playing in a great City and he said around about it was a th men measures in the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there if you're a studier of scripture there's seven Redemptive names of Jehovah right Jehovah RI the great healer and Jehovah Raha that great Shepherd and amen you know Jehovah Sid can knew that great banner and there's seven Redemptive names of all the Redemption power from Eden all the way to Eden he revealed his greatness in them but one thing in this Jehovah shama is the Lord is present what good would a Healer do if he wasn't here what good is a savior if he ain't here what good is a counselor if he ain't here listen to me what good is God if he ain't here if God's somewhere Way Out J somewhere and we can't get to it what good is that kind of God but Ezekiel said the name of of this city the Lord is there what is her name the Lord is there now I remember when I first come into this message it was a big punch word he's here I remember that is any of y'all remember that back way years back when I first come in the message it's been back in the 95 everybody was back in that time they' just say he's here and half of them I don't think knew what they were talking about and half of it I don't know if I knew what they were talking about but they were saying he's here and they were taking it from a declaration brother brandham made my Ministries declare him he's here talking about Christ amen but after I got a little older in the message they cried he's here and I cried where he's here where come on don't just tell me God's here tell me where he's at don't tell me God's here where is the god of Jacob where does he live where is his Temple what house does he live in if you're going to worship a god you better know where he lives he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about Jehovah sha the Lord is there the Lord is there the Lord is in that [Music] City now you're not much referred to a city usually but a city is a place of habitation and in Revelation 21 and2 John said I saw a holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband brother bam said the reason it said as a bride because that's exactly what it is a bride in the Philadelphian age he said the New Jerusalem is the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ come on Friends it is a city that has been set on a hill it's a city with the gates of the Apostles and the foundations of their prophets come on it's gates are Gates of Pearl and in the city there is a lamb who is the light the Sun never goes down in that [Applause] City now now in that City's a light that never goes out the lamb the word is there he's tabernacled there in that City it's his habitation now watch amen the Bible said behold the Tabernacle of God is with men now now you say preacher you're getting way off now I I just want to read to you Revelation 17 and five and on her forehead was name was written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots the Abominations of the earth what is she amen she is the habitation of all unclean and F Birds mystery Babylon is not the city Babylon it's the mystery Babylon and it's a habitation of devils there is a mystery New Jerusalem that is the habitation of almighty God that's the city God lives in he lives in his Bri come on church now I I pray you're okay tonight I pray you read the message of the hour but our God ain't in Leia wrong City it's a city that is blind it is miserable it is wretched it is naked the prophet of God said it's got beautiful worship but it's cold and formal but there is another city represented in the Bible there is a bride City this is a bride age this is a bride manifestation it's the Tabernacle of God in this age [Music] H when the enemy comes in like a flood I won't keep you all night when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit will raise a standard you said preacher raise a standard yes the enemy comes like a flood he's did that hasn't he we don't have to preach on that part what will God do though when he raises the standard he said God he said we'll do something what will God do he says God the Redeemer shall come to Zion when the enemy comes in like a flood the Redeemer is going to come to Zion Christ is coming into the church Psalms chapter 2 said I'll set my city upon the Holy Hill of Zion First Peter says I'll lay in her the foundation stone amen and Malachi 3 he said I'll come to my temple suddenly I'll come to my temple in Isaiah 2 he said the law shall go forth out of Zion law of Liberty and Life coming out of the Church of the Living God let me ask you something tonight let me just ask you something very clearly the Bible asked this question he said what is a man that God is mindful of him have you ever thought about it what is a man that God is mindful of a man why is God got you on his mind why is God so worried about man because man is the Throne of God your heart is the Throne of almighty God you have been ordained and elected of God to be the Throne of God in this age your heart is The Mercy [Music] [Applause] [Music] Seat it's The Mercy Seat now there are three there are three rounds to that Tabernacle there's an outer Court everybody's there there's an inner court and you just go in and there's those seven lampstands fires that men lit and can let go out isn't that something that church age that church age time is something to do with man the light on the outside's got bad days and good days don't ever live in a place that you're that you that you're um how me say it that you're touched by everything that happens come on get out of that place that it can rain on you don't stand out the rain so it's wet today I'm following God and I'm stopping wet well come in out of the rain come in out of the elements so and so said that about me so and so said come on out come out of them elements and come on in here a little [Applause] deeper now y'all know y'all know brother Braham took the hand of everybody people all kinds of people he took their hands what was that first pull it was in the body realm sure body to body hand to hand and watch God went to that part of it and look at all that was there look at everything was left there but watch that next phase when he starts Discerning Hearts he goes into the spirit of man and he starts dealing with men Spirits amen amen amen see it was it was it was it was coming in now that's exactly right now you said preacher what what do you let's just take it when Moses come off of the mountain the second time he was wearing a veil y'all know why right because he had become God because God's word was in him so he had to Veil his face until he spoke spoke those words and the words spoken from his mouth were put on pages and those words were put behind the innermost part of the veil and when that word was back there Moses was Moses again and God was in behind the veil with his word and the pillar of fire was over that word come on the prophet of God said in the last days there would be a spirit spoken word [Applause] and in the and when the hand was being took the spirit spoken word was going to the Flesh of mankind and and and it was a powerful time but look at how far it went it come into the it come into the spirit realm me and my wife was in and up there in Gatlinburg back my 7 May 10 years ago we was up there we sitting there in a in a little eye shrink a bunch of kids were playing and there was a lady sitting there there now in all uh respect she didn't look like a Christian she just didn't she just she looked just like the world you couldn't toally different she little older lady and she's sitting there talking to my wife and she's seeing the difference in my wife she said wh what do y'all believe and and and just just to cut the chase she just said well we follow the message of brother brandham and that lady said oh Willam brandham my wife said yeah she said well I know his ministry I was in his meetings in Mississippi she said I I think it was throat cancer and I was about to die as a kid and that man called my name and rebuked that cancer and I was completely healed but see how far it went it went to the spirit real and it healed her body she said my son is a Full Gospel preacher right now she said I was also in his meetings in Oregon when that when that man was made lay across his feet she said I was in those meetings of of Oregon I think Tommy Osburn speaks about them she said I was there in them meetings she saw it she saw the Messiah sign but it never went past the Spirit come on Pentecost failed because the message didn't get past the spirit realm the prophet of God said they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can have it every day of your life and go to hell because it only gets as far as your spirit but God was not wanting to dwell in your spirit he wants to dwell in the [Applause] soul there's three Realms there's Body Soul and Spirit now now people say now people say well brother Wayne there's only three steps yes in a birth but there's four four in restoration there's four in restoration there's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word itself now you say how do you get that in that Tabernacle I'll tell you how when you get to that last part and you step into that third Veil the word itself is in that part the fourth part is inside it and when you get in there it's a it's a soundproof [Applause] room if you ever let the word get in your soul there's no devil ever going to talk you out of it God ain't looking for to dwell in your spirit he's looking for a soul to dwell in he's looking for a soul to make his abold in the soul of a man God look at that Moses had to carry that word all the way back and when it was carried into the inner Veil Moses's job was over and that's why when brother bam carried this message into the heart of the bride of Christ his message was over the third pull is to the soul of the bride of Christ and people today think they don't even thr that the bride's a part of the third pole of course she's a part of the third pole she's a part by predestination she is the Tabernacle for the third pool the third pool is the opening of the word where is the word to dwell in this age the word is returned the word is here but where is it just is it just in our books is it just in our tapes is that as far as it got did it just get to the Bible did it just get to the book but the Bible said for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and it would become a voice it would become a part of your [Applause] [Music] life it's coming into the soul sir you're a tabernacle of the third pole tonight tabernacling deity you tell me the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you can't have God in you without having the word in [Applause] you he made listen to me he made this bride where they would only be satisfied with the word that's the reason Pentecost didn't survive you was not satisfied in Pentecost you were not satisfied in the Baptist you were not satisfied in the Lutheran because you were made you were designed upon holy prophets and Prophets that you would be a place for the message of the hour can you imagine can you imagine when they brought that word in Solomon's tent and they brought and in that Tabernacle and when they saw the place that was made for it you you couldn't just take that word and drop it off at somebody's house it was made that was that was a that was a piece of furniture made they'd set that word now when it clicked in place the glory filled the house now now that same shite did not stop at the first pull it did not stop stop at the second poll the angel of the Covenant is with this message tonight can I can I I was just I was just studying this uh I was just studying this this week and I was I was amazed to see somebody said to me the other day they said brother Wayne said we don't know about that picture you know that was taken in SE Houston coliseum's got the pillar fire brother yeah that one they said we don't know about that picture there they said something about they thought maybe something I said well here's the first thing you got to know brother bam didn't get that picture and then start talking about the pillar of fire he was telling about the pillar of fire for over three years on the field before they got the [Applause] pitcher I tell you something else William brandham didn't take that picture and his friends didn't take it and your friends didn't take it you know who took that picture the critics took the picture can I can I say something to you I bet they wish they' have left their photos at home I bet you they wish they would have never hired that photographer I bet hmon wished he' have never built them Gallows I bet you Goliath wished he had never brought his sword there's haymon's Gallows there's Goliath's sword they took the photo and we're going to beat the devil down with it everywhere we go we got a picture of what we believe yes sir somebody said to me the other day they said brother they you know they're trying to tell me a bunch of junk you know and they're trying to get me to answer questions I said well I don't got no questions I believe the message and they said well if you won't listen to what we got to say said that must mean you got your head in the sand I said no I got my head in the holies of holies see you got to know how to argue with your devil if you're going to talk to the devil you got to know how to talk to the devil he ain't your friend he ain't your brother he's come to steal and Rob and destroy your families break come on he's here to break churches he's here to tear down Hearts you don't owe that devil nothing you don't know that devil nothing I had a little dog I had a little dog she was a she was about a oh I say a little she's 75 pounds she was a Mountain Cur dog and she little strong thing she loved to play tug of war a so she had a piece of rope about that long and she'd get that thing and you sitting there and she'd throw it against your leg she'd drive you crazy she'd text call text call I want to talk about these things text call text call she just drive you crazy so finally I'd get a hold of it and she get to pulling now she cheated cuz she'd choke up on it she'd about get your hand but I'd hold on to it and she'd pull like anything she' get on man she'd pull she was Stout but I learned something over in the kitchen we had some we had some uh towel laid down there and if I ever pulled her off of that carpet over on that tow brother she let go of that thing just like that she wouldn't play on the towel cuz she didn't have a chance on the tow listen to me quit talking to that devil on the outer courts tell him if you want to talk to me come on in the holies of holies we'll talk about it in there I'll tell you why if the devil makes it to the holies of holies he'll get the Holy Ghost and he'll agree with the message then you can't talk to the devil out there he's an unbeliever you can't make him see the message you got to go to the holies of holies you got to get where it's a soundproof room that Pillar of Fire was what was planting that seed just like in the creation time he I just preached a sermon the other day I won't preach it to you tonight but it's called the brooding logos and that logos brooded over the Earth and brought seeds forth the same logos that created the heavens and the Earth is creating a bride in the end time and he's brooding over the church now here's the thing brother when brother bam was there in Sam Houston Coliseum you see that pillar of fires with him do you know they took the same picture in Dallas but it was across his shoulder and in Germany they took a picture uh footprints on Sand of times you can see that come in the room you can see it rest on brother

Jeffersonville and he was with him over in Louisiana and he was with him over there in Africa and he was with him in India he was with him in Germany he's wherever this message is that same light is with with this message God has carried this message past justification past sanctification we moved past the baptism of the spirit into the word itself when the word itself moves into the soul Christ
