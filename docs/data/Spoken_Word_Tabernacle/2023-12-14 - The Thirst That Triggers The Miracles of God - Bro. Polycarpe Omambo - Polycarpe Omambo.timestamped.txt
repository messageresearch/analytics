[18:50] $300
[18:51] but thank God for that amen that the
[18:55] Lord helped that leaking toilet amen the
[18:58] second one for healing and work meate I
[19:01] had requested the church to pray for he
[19:03] has been discharged to Rehabilitation
[19:06] glory be to our god amen
[19:10] amen
[19:12] amen we're going to call brother Michael
[19:15] up um to bless the Lord um after sister
[19:19] divine's
[19:20] testimony amen so we're going to invite
[19:23] sister Divine to give her testimony
[19:26] tonight amen
[19:41] God bless you
[19:42] Saints um I don't even know where to
[19:44] start
[19:46] um God is good
[19:50] um so I haven't been working
[19:53] consistently
[19:54] for since October and um because of that
[19:58] I had to basically rely on my credit
[20:00] card to you know pay gas and little
[20:04] stuff um so because of that reason my
[20:08] credit card well my loan on my credit
[20:11] card was over
[20:13] ,000
[20:15] um so of course like already having
[20:17] student loans and not having consistent
[20:19] job is you know is stressful um so I was
[20:23] doing my best trying to pay my you know
[20:25] my loan little by little um but of
[20:27] course that didn't help because if I'm
[20:29] not working consistently I'm not able to
[20:30] pay my uh uh my loan and because every
[20:34] time I got paid I will you know focus on
[20:35] paying my bills um first and then
[20:38] because all my my all my money will be
[20:39] gone by paying my bills then I won't I
[20:41] didn't have money to pay my loans so you
[20:43] know with timing and your credit score
[20:45] and all that stuff it wasn't looking
[20:46] good right um so then um I worked
[20:52] Friday um Saturday for the family and
[20:56] then after that um the L lady she kind
[20:58] of wanted me just to you know to kind of
[21:00] be an assistant for her because her um
[21:02] child you know had special needs so then
[21:04] she had asked me to go to the store to
[21:06] buy like little bit of groceries and
[21:07] then she will compensate me back for the
[21:09] money um for the groceries so then I
[21:11] went to the grocery store I I've used my
[21:13] credit card and because I I knew that
[21:16] you know she was ging she would give me
[21:17] back the money and then when she gave me
[21:18] back the money I just you know
[21:19] automatically just put it back in my
[21:21] credit card you know so I won't you know
[21:23] just have even more money racking up so
[21:26] after that um so I paid off the money um
[21:30] directly after she um she she paid me
[21:32] back um and then as I was paying as I
[21:35] was paying back the money I looked at my
[21:37] credit um my credit uh I don't know what
[21:39] you call it not score
[21:41] but my uh not balance uh uh my okay I
[21:46] don't know what it's called but anyways
[21:48] I was my statements there you go so I
[21:50] was looking at my statements and it
[21:51] showed that you know I paid the minus 25
[21:53] that that's basically the amount that
[21:54] was there so I paid that off and then I
[21:56] was just looking at my big B um um
[21:59] credit um credit loan that I own and I'm
[22:01] just like I was like Lord if only like
[22:02] you can do something because it was just
[22:04] stressful looking at that and knowing
[22:06] that you know of course I already had
[22:07] student loans um but I'm just looking at
[22:09] this big number that I kind of didn't
[22:11] expect to have you know um especially
[22:13] just by not working consistently and not
[22:15] being able to pay it off so then um I
[22:18] don't really recall what I did all I
[22:20] know is the next morning I was just
[22:22] randomly going through my well Spargo
[22:24] account and it is said minus so it
[22:26] overdraft um like over
[22:29] $1,000 and it showed that you know the
[22:31] $25 which was paid to my credit card but
[22:33] it also like it also it also basically
[22:35] um show the overdraft of basically
[22:38] almost all all the money that was in my
[22:39] credit card right so then I'm looking at
[22:42] this I'm like oh my goodness so I'm
[22:43] thinking like the bank is going to call
[22:44] me and be like what's going on why is
[22:46] your Bank overdraft over like almost
[22:47] over ,000 dollars or whatever but you
[22:50] know throughout the whole day I'm just
[22:51] like looking at it looking at it I'm
[22:52] just like Lord if only like you can
[22:54] create a paradox of this situation
[22:55] because I already know that I'm already
[22:57] basically struggling financially and I
[22:59] can't really pay back the money
[23:01] consistently so this was like um Sunday
[23:04] night Sunday night I just prayed that
[23:06] and then um I didn't really end up going
[23:07] to sleep until like 2: in the morning
[23:09] cuz my sleep schedule had messed up and
[23:12] I just went to sleep and I was just like
[23:13] thinking about the sister who um I know
[23:15] that she had she didn't have um any um
[23:17] any gas money you know to put gas on her
[23:19] car but she wanted to go to church and
[23:21] God you know basically provided an
[23:22] invisible type of gas for her to make it
[23:24] to church so I'm just thinking about all
[23:26] this stuff and I'm just like I just FR
[23:28] like God can you just create a situation
[23:30] for me just to kind of pin you know kind
[23:31] of point my finger on and knowing that
[23:33] you know you're with me so I went to
[23:35] sleep and then randomly I woke up I
[23:37] looked and it showed basically the
[23:38] amount that I had left in my account but
[23:40] it took off the whole a th000 plus
[23:43] dollars that was there and I was like
[23:45] okay this is confusing so the whole day
[23:47] I'm like keep looking I'm keep looking I
[23:49] went back to my credit card and it
[23:51] showed that the money was paid off so I
[23:53] only have like $300 left that I have to
[23:56] pay personally but I just want to thank
[23:58] God for taking this burden and I just
[24:01] kept singing and I kept testifying you
[24:03] know that Jesus dropped the charges and
[24:06] I don't know how he did it but I'm just
[24:08] happy that you know I don't have to pay
[24:10] over $1,000 on my loan anymore so
[24:14] amen amen and amen
[24:17] amen amen Jesus dropped the
[24:21] charges amen and we tap into that
[24:24] anointing all the bills all the charges
[24:27] that we have he's gonna drop all of them
[24:29] amen
[24:31] amen um we're GNA call brother Michael
[24:34] Mar to bring before the Lord
[24:39] um our testimony our um birthday coming
[24:43] up and then also remember continue to uh
[24:47] remember sister Christa in prayer

[43:08] whole society is done it's a different
[43:10] way if you sit down and you study the
[43:12] message you will see many things that
[43:14] were taught
[43:17] wrong many thing that were taught wrong
[43:19] because people miss the prophet
[43:21] completely and when you begin to look in
[43:23] different view you will see that this
[43:25] message is beautiful it is everything it
[43:28] is correcting our life it's correcting
[43:31] our finances it corrects our marriages
[43:33] it correct our relationship our business
[43:36] there is no area in our life that the
[43:38] message cannot penetrate and restore
[43:41] it's a message of restoration there is
[43:43] nothing even if even and and and the
[43:46] beauty of the message it can go back to
[43:48] your old life and dig into it and pick
[43:52] up something there and pull it from
[43:54] there and come and fix what is present

[1:02:51] Psalm must have been in distress
[1:02:58] and he usually take
[1:03:04] distress to bring the best out of a
[1:03:08] man it's
[1:03:11] really that's when
[1:03:14] God get
[1:03:17] down to when we
[1:03:23] fast
[1:03:25] and many times to get ourself in a
[1:03:27] position to get out of the
[1:03:30] way and I think when
[1:03:34] David got in these
[1:03:39] places then he begin to meditate on the
[1:03:43] Lord begin to think about these
[1:03:46] things paragraph
[1:03:50] 22 many times God God gets us
[1:04:00] God gets us in tight Corners where we
[1:04:03] have to look
[1:04:07] up where we have to look
[1:04:14] up sometime we even have to get on our
[1:04:17] back in a
[1:04:22] hospital or a bed some where so we can
[1:04:25] look
[1:04:28] up to look up to see where the great
[1:04:31] blessings of God comes from amen
[1:04:35] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:04:43] Lord most of the time we find oursel in
[1:04:48] trouble and when we are faced with
[1:04:53] trouble we usually have a tendency to
[1:04:55] think that God have forsaken us or
[1:04:57] forgotten
[1:04:58] us or in
[1:05:03] life maybe one day you got
[1:05:09] sick or maybe one day you pray God and
[1:05:12] go Grant you the desire
[1:05:15] of but when a new situation
[1:05:20] AR and you will forget what God did for
[1:05:23] you like did one
[1:05:27] time you don't remember that God did
[1:05:30] something for me in the
[1:05:33] past that he is the same God he can do
[1:05:36] the same thing over again amen
[1:05:41] amen in paragraph five brother Bram says
[1:05:46] this if you are listening here
[1:05:50] tonight remember
[1:05:53] this
[1:05:56] the god that made you go through the
[1:05:59] first
[1:06:02] time he can do it again the second
[1:06:07] time and we are placing our faith in
[1:06:11] God that he will grant unto
[1:06:16] you and don't take the devil's lie about
[1:06:21] anything about anything
[1:06:27] just remember that God is
[1:06:33] God and he still remain the same
[1:06:36] yesterday today and
[1:06:44] forever David one day faced
[1:06:48] Goliath and Goliath was terrorizing
[1:06:53] everybody
[1:06:55] but David remember
[1:06:57] something that one
[1:07:00] day that God delivered
[1:07:03] me out of a
[1:07:05] lion and also a
[1:07:08] bear and the same
[1:07:10] God can do the same thing or help
[1:07:14] me to take care of this go to cut the
[1:07:18] head of
[1:07:20] Goliath and he used that experience to
[1:07:23] win Goliath
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:26] amen he never forgot the past
[1:07:30] experience blessed be the name
[1:07:33] the I'm going to paragraph
[1:07:37] 34 blessed be the name of the
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:49] Lord now many times I meet people that's
[1:07:52] prone to be a little nervous
[1:07:58] when they found out that they're trying
[1:08:00] to do
[1:08:03] something and everything is just
[1:08:06] blocking it off on both sides they
[1:08:11] say it might not be the will of the
[1:08:17] Lord now don't let the devil lie to you
[1:08:21] like that amen amen
[1:08:26] maybe you have a
[1:08:30] plan and according to your plan you face
[1:08:37] obstacles now you begin to question
[1:08:39] yourself that maybe this is not the will
[1:08:41] of the Lord because every time I do this
[1:08:43] it's not working I'm trying to do
[1:08:44] something is not working all I'm I'm
[1:08:48] still so I believe it's not the will of
[1:08:52] God but look at what is the will of
[1:08:56] God God want to take Israel out of
[1:09:02] Egypt watch this and to take them all
[1:09:05] the way to the promised
[1:09:07] land but all the
[1:09:10] way they had so many obstacle on the
[1:09:14] way the
[1:09:18] were the anak was
[1:09:20] there and they found Jericho on the way
[1:09:25] but it's God who promised them the
[1:09:27] promise and God told them it's the
[1:09:30] country that have honey
[1:09:33] and and it's the same thing for you God
[1:09:36] also give you
[1:09:39] promises but you will find trials on
[1:09:41] your
[1:09:43] ways you must hold tight unto the Lord
[1:09:46] Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ and you will come out
[1:09:51] through because God is more more than
[1:09:55] able and brother is giving an
[1:09:59] example of people that get
[1:10:03] discouraged in paragraph 36 in the
[1:10:06] message
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:10] thirst brother says
[1:10:13] this like for
[1:10:16] instance seeking for the baptism of the
[1:10:18] Holy
[1:10:20] Ghost many times I run into people
[1:10:22] saying
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:25] I sought for the Holy
[1:10:30] Ghost I just could not receive
[1:10:34] it I don't believe it's for
[1:10:37] me every time I get down I get
[1:10:43] sick when I go to
[1:10:45] praying if I
[1:10:47] fast I get
[1:10:51] sick if I try to stay on
[1:10:55] night I stay
[1:10:57] up I get so
[1:11:00] sleepy I can't get off my
[1:11:03] feet remember that
[1:11:07] is the
[1:11:09] devil
[1:11:15] because God intend for you to have the
[1:11:18] Holy Ghost amen
[1:11:21] amen PR a
[1:11:25] promise when God promise you something
[1:11:28] God will fulfill amen
[1:11:33] amen another
[1:11:36] example in paragraph
[1:11:40] 40 he's talking about somebody who just
[1:11:43] got
[1:11:44] converted you might be a brother or a
[1:11:48] sister and you will see the first day
[1:11:50] you come to
[1:11:52] church or maybe you will make it to the
[1:11:56] Altar and you begin to come to the
[1:11:58] church very
[1:12:00] often when you go home that same
[1:12:03] day you will see maybe your father begin
[1:12:07] to fight against maybe it's going to be
[1:12:10] mama who keep getting upset maybe your
[1:12:12] brothers or sister begin to get upset
[1:12:15] with
[1:12:17] you so the very same day you tried to
[1:12:20] hold on to the
[1:12:22] word that's when torment start in the
[1:12:25] home it's all to discourage
[1:12:28] you but if you hold on
[1:12:32] tight God is more than
[1:12:34] able to take you all the
[1:12:37] way blessed be the name of the
[1:12:43] Lord and in paragraph 44 brother Bram
[1:12:48] says he say thirst is a natural thing
[1:12:51] amen amen
[1:12:55] it is
[1:12:59] natural it's not an a natural thing to
[1:13:02] thirst for
[1:13:04] God it's a natural
[1:13:08] thing it's just something that you
[1:13:10] should
[1:13:12] do God has made you like
[1:13:17] that and it's not super
[1:13:20] human just actually a common human
[1:13:27] being he Ain just special for some
[1:13:31] people it is for
[1:13:34] everyone to thirst after
[1:13:39] God I'm going keep a lot of things
[1:13:41] because of
[1:13:46] time in paragraph 88 for
[1:13:49] instance brother Bram says this
[1:13:56] brother Bram says
[1:14:02] this God want
[1:14:07] us God want you to thirst for
[1:14:13] him as the heart P for the water
[1:14:19] broke my soul first after the oh God
[1:14:26] I skip a lot of things when David was
[1:14:28] speaking
[1:14:30] here when he compare himself to a
[1:14:34] heart brother Bram explained this in
[1:14:37] this
[1:14:39] way brother Bram take the the animal
[1:14:42] called the
[1:14:45] heart when the heart is far away from
[1:14:48] the source of
[1:14:52] water
[1:14:55] maybe when he's facing a predator just
[1:14:58] about to attack
[1:15:00] him and the water is not too
[1:15:04] Clos if he's wounded and he start
[1:15:08] bleeding he can even die right then
[1:15:13] but if the
[1:15:18] heart found water
[1:15:21] somewhere no matter the
[1:15:26] the bleeding from the
[1:15:29] wound if the heart can only reach the
[1:15:32] water
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:35] Brook the heart will be strengthened
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:40] then that's why David compare
[1:15:44] himself and he said that my soul is
[1:15:46] thirsting amen
[1:15:49] amen that my soul is thirsting after you
[1:15:54] oh
[1:15:55] God because my soul is thirsting after
[1:15:58] God and not just a God but a living
[1:16:03] God meaning that when you going
[1:16:06] through or whatever situation you're
[1:16:08] going through or maybe somebody's
[1:16:11] condemning
[1:16:13] you but if you get closer to the
[1:16:16] water if you get closer to the presence
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:19] God God will wash away your condemnation
[1:16:22] amen glory be to
[1:16:25] God that's why David desire
[1:16:28] the and to reach that
[1:16:32] situation you must be in a state of
[1:16:36] urgency in a state that you are
[1:16:40] hungry when you are really
[1:16:43] thirsty because
[1:16:45] remember that the one creating the
[1:16:48] hunger is God
[1:16:51] himself the one the
[1:16:54] problem is God
[1:16:57] himself and when God initiate the
[1:17:01] trial he already have a great blessing
[1:17:04] for you amen glory be to
[1:17:08] God and God has trust in you God has
[1:17:12] confidence in you he knows that can so
[1:17:15] he can change your
[1:17:18] situation glory to
[1:17:22] God let me read something
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:29] here let me go to paragraph 137 and
[1:17:36] 138 glory to
[1:17:38] God blessed be the name of the
[1:17:44] Lord Brother Bram is saying this
[1:17:47] here let me tell you
[1:17:51] friend I don't care how many how many
[1:17:53] churches you
[1:17:58] join how many names you put
[1:18:04] on whichever way you
[1:18:07] go whe you were Springer or
[1:18:11] bapti or whatever you
[1:18:16] are you meet that
[1:18:19] person Jesus
[1:18:21] Christ
[1:18:24] that's the only
[1:18:27] thing that will really satisfy amen
[1:18:33] amen 138 he says
[1:18:36] this emotion won't do
[1:18:41] it you might jump jump up and
[1:18:46] down and shout as long as you want
[1:18:51] to or you might run up and down the
[1:18:57] flooor and you might speak in
[1:19:00] tongues as much as you
[1:19:03] want and Them Things Are Holy and
[1:19:06] good I don't say I don't say nothing
[1:19:09] against that I don't have anything
[1:19:12] against
[1:19:14] it but until you meet that
[1:19:19] person that satisfying portion
[1:19:26] that's something that takes every fiber
[1:19:29] of your
[1:19:31] body not by
[1:19:35] emotion but by a
[1:19:40] satisfaction brother is saying
[1:19:43] this it's like we are in church
[1:19:46] here when we join a certain
[1:19:51] Church you will see somebody full of
[1:19:53] emotions amen
[1:20:00] amen and we also are not against emotion
[1:20:04] when the Holy Ghost those things must
[1:20:07] automatically take
[1:20:09] place but there is a very cunning
[1:20:14] Spirit of the
[1:20:18] devil that can infiltrate in the midst
[1:20:21] of the children of God
[1:20:24] thinking that when you go through
[1:20:25] emotion or maybe he feels some Co he
[1:20:29] says okay therefore the Holy
[1:20:33] Ghost and you will notice that
[1:20:35] person when he have that
[1:20:38] experience he will stop right there and
[1:20:40] never go
[1:20:41] further instead of moving
[1:20:45] forward because the true Holy
[1:20:47] Ghost will never leave you in one place
[1:20:51] he won't leave you on emot
[1:20:53] or just speaking in or doing this or
[1:20:58] just dance in the
[1:20:59] spirit but the true holy spirit will
[1:21:03] bring you to live the entire word of God
[1:21:06] glory to
[1:21:08] God and to manifest that same word of
[1:21:12] God because God is his
[1:21:15] word blessed be the name of the

[1:32:07] Moses there were no flies in the
[1:32:10] country it was not the season of
[1:32:14] flies brother Bram is saying here so we
[1:32:17] can uh save some
[1:32:20] time
[1:32:22] that Moses God made him
[1:32:27] God meaning the words that Moses was
[1:32:30] speaking were the words of
[1:32:35] God and Moses tonight is you my brother
[1:32:38] you
[1:32:40] s because the word that Moses have you
[1:32:44] have and you have not just the word but
[1:32:47] the word in its
[1:32:50] fullness but you still making the same
[1:32:53] mistake that Moses
[1:32:56] made Moses forgot that he could speak
[1:32:59] flies into
[1:33:01] existence he forgot that he could speak
[1:33:05] thoughts he just speak the word and
[1:33:08] things will
[1:33:10] happen but Moses begin to cry unto the
[1:33:14] Lord that's why God remanded
[1:33:18] him I place my word in you
[1:33:22] when you speak it's me
[1:33:25] speaking and when like tonight if you
[1:33:29] speak exactly

[1:33:36] order must command every situation that
[1:33:39] is troubling
[1:33:41] you today the struggle we
[1:33:45] have and the weapon that we
[1:33:48] have it's a spiritual fight
[1:33:52] with spiritual
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:57] weapons the an that we have
[1:34:00] today or the am we fac
