[9:01] this evening um
[9:03] i did have a praise report myself uh
[9:05] actually i left work
[9:06] and we had plenty of time to get here
[9:08] but i pulled into a gas station to get
[9:10] some gas and uh
[9:12] a guy walked up to me his name was don
[9:15] and he told me he said hey
[9:17] i'm not asking for any money but um out
[9:19] of everybody in this gas station he said
[9:21] you're the only one that uh
[9:23] that stood out to me and and i really
[9:24] need something and i was wondering if
[9:26] you could take me
[9:27] over here 10 15 minutes away i lock my
[9:29] keys in my car and i'm meeting somebody
[9:31] over here
[9:32] and um i was like well you know um i
[9:35] want
[9:36] to a hundred percent but um i'm kind of
[9:38] in a push to get to church on time and
[9:40] all that
[9:41] so um but we'll work it out we'll work
[9:43] it out i'll do it and i didn't know how
[9:44] far i was going but it ended up being 15
[9:46] 20 minutes away
[9:47] but i took them and it just stood out to
[9:49] me that 20
[9:50] 24 pumps at that gas station they might
[9:53] have all been filled there was a busy
[9:54] gas station at that point but yet
[9:56] something stood out
[9:57] and he saw something in me he chose to
[9:59] ask me and then also
[10:01] i the times just didn't didn't work out
[10:04] i mean it
[10:05] should have put me here at like 7 45 i
[10:07] still had to go all the way to denver
[10:09] from charlotte pick up my wife and then
[10:11] come all the way out here
[10:12] in gastonia and i just didn't see how i
[10:14] would work out but i i was like lord
[10:16] surely you need me to do this i don't
[10:18] know why but you need me to do this so
[10:19] he went
[10:20] he was talking to me pouring out his
[10:22] life um i guess because i made the
[10:23] comment of having to be at church this
[10:25] evening he just
[10:26] he started talking to me and telling me
[10:28] things and he just asked that we
[10:29] remember him in prayer tonight so we'll
[10:30] remember
[10:31] don um in prayer tonight just for his
[10:34] situation
[10:35] and uh but it was just my testimony was
[10:38] that
[10:38] we were able to get here on time even
[10:40] early we got here like 7 15 and i just
[10:42] did not see how i was going to work but

[25:23] this evening
[25:29] [Music]
[25:40] oh
[25:45] [Music]
[25:51] before we
[25:57] [Music]

[26:12] [Applause]
[26:13] [Music]
[26:20] as we invite our pastor oh
[26:24] we exalted
[26:32] we exhausted
[26:49] oh lord
[26:52] one more time
[27:00] [Music]
[27:04] we exhausted
[27:11] we exhausted
[27:21] lord amen
[27:26] we exalt him tonight praise the lord
[27:30] amen amen amen for the miracle
[27:35] we have two amps now and it sounds
[27:38] pretty good for me
[27:40] praise the lord and it's a miracle to
[27:43] see those musician chairs
[27:45] being filled praise the lord
[27:50] hallelujah god working in a mysterious
[27:54] way
[27:56] tonight it's another surprise but it's
[27:59] not really a surprise he's our local
[28:01] minister here
[28:03] it's an elder a veteran and we owe him
[28:07] a lot of respect it's brother kelly
[28:14] glenn
[28:21] before we invite him i came across this
[28:25] code after preaching sunday i didn't
[28:28] know it
[28:30] brother branham say in the message
[28:33] is preached on 56 on april the 4th
[28:37] paragraph 13 the infallibility of god's
[28:41] spoken word if i'm not mistaken brother
[28:44] branham says that
[28:45] now the hebrew prophets
[28:50] the two major themes and practically
[28:53] from
[28:54] somewhere along in every chapter of the
[28:57] bible
[28:58] from genesis to malachi you can find
[29:02] one of those subjects being dealt with
[29:06] all the way to the bible the coming of
[29:10] the messiah that's the first
[29:12] one and the anointing and sending forth
[29:16] of the church into all the world
[29:20] so brother branham said from genesis to
[29:22] malachi
[29:23] if you check you'll find two subjects
[29:25] being dealt with
[29:26] the coming down of the lord jesus christ
[29:29] of the messiah
[29:30] and then the sending fourth of the
[29:32] church all over the world
[29:34] so number one it's a preeminence of god
[29:37] in christ
[29:38] and number two is the preeminence in the
[29:40] church
[29:42] brother branham continues he says that
[29:45] it spoke
[29:46] of in symbols and
[29:50] by animals and so forth and like
[29:53] great armies and so forth
[29:57] that march is on and
[30:00] runs over the wall and so forth of
[30:03] different
[30:04] like locusts and everything was in
[30:06] symbols and parable
[30:08] and straight teachings and everything
[30:10] come down to those
[30:12] two subjects so when you see armies
[30:14] marching
[30:16] all over the wall it's speaking about
[30:19] the bride
[30:20] of jesus christ i didn't have this code
[30:23] but we show you that the army that was
[30:25] going around jericho
[30:26] was the bride of jesus christ
[30:29] in each age one time one time one time
[30:33] then in the last stage we go seventh
[30:36] time
[30:36] because we have seven mysteries that
[30:39] must be
[30:40] unfold so we have brother glenn kelly
[30:43] tonight
[30:44] who will be preaching for us we got new
[30:46] amps
[30:47] he sounds good so brother k preach the
[30:50] house down
[30:55] let's sing only believe
[30:59] oh libby
[31:09] [Music]
[31:12] all things are
[31:16] possible

[31:34] only believe
[31:36] [Music]
[31:39] all things are
[31:42] possible
[31:44] [Music]
[31:46] only believe
[31:49] lord i believe
[32:01] [Music]
[32:40] so
[32:44] [Music]
[32:58] you know when we come in you recognize
[33:00] what the lord is doing
[33:02] and uh you know the lord said give them
[33:03] their props while they're here before we
[33:06] take them home you know no man can't
[33:08] minister like that
[33:09] it's the holy ghost that's anointed a
[33:11] man to minister that
[33:13] for his people in the end time is that
[33:15] right
[33:16] god is moving in a miraculous way he's
[33:19] moving in an anointing
[33:20] like he's never moved before is that
[33:22] right because he saved
[33:24] the best for last his bride of jesus
[33:27] christ
[33:28] [Applause]
[33:29] sit on you know i tell them i come here
[33:32] i'm just
[33:33] you know done it's a spare time you know
[33:35] they give you a donut
[33:36] and they give you a spare tire with
[33:38] these cars today right
[33:39] well i'm glad i'm not a donut okay i'm a
[33:42] spare tire because the spare tire
[33:44] can do to have the same anointing and
[33:46] bring the same anointing
[33:47] that a regular tire can bring right huh
[33:51] so we recognize here there's the same
[33:53] holy ghost is that right
[33:55] he just bursted dispersed in it
[33:58] in different ways but i tell you i'm
[34:01] excited
[34:02] i tell you i'm so excited because those
[34:04] messages that have been coming
[34:06] that i didn't talk to brother steve but
[34:08] those messages that have been coming
[34:10] say we wrestle not against flesh and
[34:12] blood but we
[34:13] wrestle against principality and powers
[34:15] and wickedness and rulers in high places
[34:18] you know we are fighting against some
[34:20] influential demons
[34:21] i'm not talking about something light i
[34:24] mean god has given us the word
[34:26] victory to face those devils when the
[34:28] devil
[34:29] came to me you see you understand what
[34:31] we said
[34:32] accepted i sat down in the face of
[34:35] someone that tried to
[34:36] switch malachi 4 on me i sat down in the
[34:40] face
[34:40] of someone trying to tell me a different
[34:42] revelation of
[34:44] of 10 um revelations 10. i'm seeing
[34:47] these

[39:34] we're working with prayer tonight okay
[39:37] we're working in prayer tonight
[39:38] you know the prophet of god said and
[39:41] that is
[39:42] one of the most powerful things that god
[39:44] had given me
[39:45] confession is that right he said the
[39:47] holy ghost is that right
[39:48] and he also included prayer in there is
[39:51] that right
[39:51] we're going to look at tonight we're
[39:53] getting ready to bust the devil in the
[39:55] head
[39:55] because when you're in the war you gotta
[39:58] have a prayer life
[39:59] you gotta have a prayer a prayer life of
[40:01] confidence
[40:02] you gotta have a prayer in life you know
[40:04] that god hears your prayers is that
[40:06] right
[40:06] that's why we know we praying do we
[40:09] already have we're rejoicing because
[40:11] we already have our building is that
[40:13] right we already have our building
[40:15] we already have our finances we don't
[40:17] speak because
[40:18] god said if your word abide in me and i
[40:21] abide in you
[40:22] whatever you ask you shall receive we
[40:24] don't ask him how he's going to bring it
[40:26] we know he's going to bring it is that
[40:28] right so we give him praise
[40:29] we give him honor we give him glory
[40:34] let's turn to james and then i
[40:36] appreciate your patience for standing
[40:38] let's turn to james chapter five
[40:45] hallelujah
[40:49] i just love coming in the house with the
[40:50] lord now you're out there warring on
[40:53] all day you know sharing this precious
[40:56] gospel
[40:57] and fi let's look at verse 13 for the
[40:59] sake of time
[41:00] 13 it says in any among you
[41:04] afflicted let him what let him
[41:07] let him pray you may be seated he said
[41:10] then let him pray
[41:11] is any mary let him sing songs is any
[41:14] sick among you
[41:16] let him call for the elders of the of
[41:18] the church and let him pray
[41:20] over him anointing him with oil in the
[41:23] name
[41:23] in the name of the lord and the prayer
[41:26] of faith
[41:27] shall save the sick and the lord shall
[41:29] raise
[41:30] him up and if he hath committed sins
[41:33] they shall be forgiven you know may the
[41:35] lord have a blessing to the reading of
[41:37] his word
[41:38] you know i mentioned here brother
[41:40] branham hit this scripture twice
[41:42] under the message if you want to pull it
[41:44] up it was 11 6
[41:45] 53 it was do ye noun believe
[41:49] and it was they also 3 2 54 the
[41:52] resurrection of jairus's daughter
[41:54] and so right then he used those two
[41:56] scriptures when he was
[41:57] pointing this out and it kind of pricked
[41:59] my heart so you pray for me there's only
[42:01] the third
[42:02] time we're looking in this area here now
[42:04] but we're looking at our topic tonight
[42:06] is going to be
[42:07] your confidence do do you have
[42:10] pr do you have confidence in your prayer
[42:14] do you have confidence in your prayer so
[42:17] now the first thing he said he said you
[42:19] pray is that right
[42:20] over there do you pray so when he come
[42:23] around and now
[42:24] god is building this house god is
[42:26] building a spiritual house
[42:28] and we have to understand them now you
[42:30] pray when you're walking
[42:31] you pray on your knees you pray when
[42:33] you're in the shower you pray when
[42:35] you're on your job
[42:36] you pray when you're when you're riding
[42:37] you're praying without ceasing is that
[42:39] right
[42:39] you're always talking to the lord so you
[42:41] know sometimes we want to
[42:43] look at this hair lord
[42:48] do ye have confidence in your prayer in
[42:51] the prayer of faith then
[42:52] we going to before we get before we take
[42:55] off
[42:56] because once we're going to just read
[42:58] the context and god's going to bring the
[43:00] rest of it is that right
[43:02] i'm just getting myself out of the way
[43:04] god is having many good ministers to the
[43:07] brothers come through here
[43:08] brother chisholm and the brother last
[43:11] week um
[43:12] i'm trying to think his name but but the
[43:15] cross
[43:16] yeah i tell you the lords have been
[43:17] ritually blessing his people
[43:19] is that right you're coming you're
[43:21] pulling on the gift of god
[43:22] you press your way out to the middle of
[43:24] the week and god has not failed you
[43:26] all you have to do and i say it as a
[43:28] testimony and it's a mark in heaven
[43:30] every place that my wife and i go to
[43:33] fellowship
[43:34] or where we went to we would always pray
[43:37] before we come into the assembly
[43:39] and god always met us there he always
[43:42] met us there you see because he's the
[43:45] author
[43:46] so we're going to look at some
[43:47] scriptures tonight so get your pencil in
[43:50] your pens or your paper
[43:51] or those that got good memories god
[43:53] bless you help me out
[43:54] i need some youth is that right yeah
[43:58] because we're getting some soul food
[44:00] here tonight is that right
[44:02] so i got my clock right here don't worry
[44:05] about it i got to work tonight i'm
[44:07] going to get you out of here in a decent
[44:09] time but we're going to walk out here
[44:10] with something is that right
[44:12] that we're going to knock the devil out
[44:14] and then you're going to come to another
[44:16] level
[44:16] let's look at this here we got some
[44:18] comments here it says
[44:20] look at the comment i wrote these things
[44:22] down i won't get a chance to go through
[44:24] all all this because i tell you i was
[44:26] just having a good time with the lord
[44:27] just me and him
[44:28] into i invited him in my room okay and
[44:31] we have come into this house to magnify
[44:33] the lord and worship him not only comes
[44:36] in the building he's entering us
[44:37] is that right huh so we're saying hey
[44:40] look at this comment before we take off
[44:42] he said there's one thing carefully to
[44:45] be observed here
[44:47] see this take two times i looked over
[44:49] this scripture for a long time
[44:52] missing and finally pricked my heart
[44:54] this is a
[44:55] prayer of faith it's a particular prayer
[45:01] and with this particular prayer it
[45:04] carries
[45:04] great authority great authority
[45:13] look what he says he said there's one
[45:15] thing carefully to be observed here
[45:17] that the saving of the sick is not
[45:19] ascribed to the anointing with oil
[45:22] but to the prayer it said prayer
[45:25] over the sick must proceed from and be
[45:29] a company with a lively faith
[45:32] it has to be a lively faith it can't be
[45:35] foreign it can be
[45:36] hypocrisy because we're going to show
[45:38] you what's going on in this one
[45:40] scripture
[45:41] there's a lot in this one scripture
[45:42] where did i get to it but we're going to
[45:44] let the holy ghost have his
[45:46] way he says now look he said there must
[45:49] be
[45:49] faith both in the person praying and
[45:52] then the person prayed for
[45:54] he said now and if he had committed
[45:57] he said sin is somebody it is both the
[45:59] root of sickness
[46:01] and the sting of it it's just sin he
[46:04] said now he said if sin be pardoned
[46:06] either affliction shall be removed in
[46:08] mercy or we shall see
[46:10] there is mercy in the contents of the
[46:13] itch
[46:13] you see what i'm saying now let's turn
[46:16] to hezekiah
[46:18] isaiah 38 let's look at hezekiah isaiah
[46:21] 38 write it down and i was going to
[46:24] quote it but let's turn to it
[46:26] i want you to see he had confidence in
[46:29] his prayer
[46:30] i'm sorry uh uh what did i say isaiah
[46:33] yeah thank you you know he had
[46:35] confidence
[46:36] has given us in this hour here and now
[46:39] now we know that hezekiah his father
[46:42] was coming down and he put up groves and
[46:45] different things and idols they was
[46:47] worshiping
[46:48] there but hezekiah 90 came he was the
[46:51] righteous king
[46:52] but now the child was about to die is
[46:54] that right
[46:55] but when hezekiah was about to die on
[46:57] the sickness
[46:58] and we're going to show you how he had
[47:00] confidence in his prayer
[47:02] no matter what his condition had nothing
[47:04] to do with the promise
[47:06] the condition had nothing to do with the
[47:08] situation
[47:09] the condition we don't look at the
[47:11] condition we keep our eyes on what
[47:13] god has promised is that right
[47:17] look what he says hezekiah's healing he
[47:20] said in those days hezekiah is sick unto
[47:23] death
[47:23] and isaiah the prophet the son of emma
[47:26] eldo
[47:27] came unto him and said unto him
[47:31] thus saying the lord set thy house in
[47:34] order
[47:35] for thou shall die and not live he said
[47:38] then hezekiah turned his face toward the
[47:40] wall
[47:40] and then what ah
[47:45] huh tell me we're going to get somewhere
[47:48] tonight
[47:49] we're going to be able to help someone
[47:51] they're going to be able to move to
[47:53] another level
[47:55] help us lord he said he he prayed unto
[47:58] who
[47:59] the lord see the prayer of faith that
[48:02] you pray with the lord
[48:04] that's a vow a vow that you and the lord
[48:08] has together not if it's going to come
[48:11] to pass
[48:12] it will come to pass
[48:14] [Music]
[48:17] a couple stories he says and said
[48:19] remember now
[48:20] oh lord i deceive thee how that i walk
[48:23] before thee
[48:24] in truth and with a perfect heart he
[48:27] come around in there
[48:28] lord i'm always
[48:32] pray i've read your word i've witnessed
[48:36] for you lord
[48:37] i came i pressed my way out to the
[48:40] service lord
[48:41] you have a heavenly bank that you got
[48:44] money into
[48:45] hezekiah has a heavenly bank that he
[48:48] knew that he could go to
[48:50] and he knew he could get god's grace is
[48:52] that right
[48:53] and hezekiah god will change his word
[48:56] but he's not going to change his way for
[48:58] anything he will change his word for a
[49:01] purpose is that right
[49:03] he saw that the kingdom everything
[49:06] israel was not restored yet is that
[49:09] right
[49:10] so he looked and he recognized lord
[49:13] i need some more time i can't see israel
[49:16] what's going to happen to him we're just
[49:19] paraphrasing it
[49:20] look and see what he was saying here he
[49:22] was not crying out for himself but
[49:24] he was crying out for the people of god
[49:27] he said
[49:28] the people who sigh and cry for the
[49:31] abomination
[49:32] for the condition of the land that's who
[49:34] i'm going to seal
[49:35] [Applause]
[49:38] brother do i need to sit still i can't
[49:40] help it hallelujah
[49:43] boy i'll try my best help me lord he
[49:46] said now look maybe i'll take my jacket
[49:47] off and help me stand still huh
[49:49] hallelujah i don't know that now huh
[49:54] i tell you the lord just been so so good
[49:56] at so much
[49:58] hallelujah he said but look he started
[50:01] pleading his case to god
[50:04] he had right to plead his case to god
[50:07] he had confidence in his prayers to god
[50:11] this wasn't a time because he knew that
[50:13] many times before
[50:15] when he went into the temple when he
[50:17] went in those places
[50:18] he knew that he went into the house of
[50:20] the lord when he went into the house of
[50:22] the lord
[50:23] he didn't fail to testify for god he
[50:26] didn't fail to praise god
[50:28] he didn't fail to worship god he did not
[50:31] fail to take care of people
[50:32] hezekiah knew he had right he didn't go
[50:36] into the heavenly bank you had right to
[50:38] go
[50:39] to the heavenly bank you've been labored
[50:41] by the grace of god
[50:43] when your body didn't want to turn
[50:44] around when god told you to get up
[50:47] three o'clock in the morning he got up
[50:49] three o'clock in the morning
[50:50] he started praying he started commuting
[50:52] with god when god needed things to go
[50:55] visit and help someone you went and
[50:57] visited someone
[50:59] you got he said when i was sick you did
[51:01] what you visited me
[51:02] when i was in prison you visit me when i
[51:05] was in cold

[51:09] hungry

[53:27] demonstrates
[53:28] that you that you're grateful of what
[53:30] the lord have done for you
[53:32] look what he said hallelujah
[53:36] and said unto hezekiah it said i have
[53:39] heard thy prayer
[53:40] i have seen thy tears behold i will add
[53:43] unto
[53:44] thee thy days 15 years
[53:47] and i will deliver thee in this city out
[53:50] of the hand
[53:51] of the king of assyria and i will defend
[53:55] this city he got his confirmation
[53:58] right there he could have said lord
[54:01] if it wasn't for you put me in that
[54:04] position
[54:05] you could have took me home right now
[54:08] lord
[54:10] but hezekiah was the one that was chosen
[54:12] to do what
[54:13] to bring god was going to use for the
[54:16] deliverance
[54:18] hallelujah look what he says
[54:21] a prayer a prayer to god it's a vow
[54:26] it's a vow to do and god has made there
[54:28] together
[54:29] it says sometimes sometimes praying the
[54:32] prayer of faith
[54:33] is like securing the promise of god
[54:38] you're securing the promise of god we
[54:41] got a few things down here that we wrote
[54:43] down
[54:43] they said the the prayer is the most
[54:47] most powerful weapon god gave to humans
[54:50] see i know i know the message
[54:52] theologians is out there they're going
[54:53] to say where you say
[54:55] the most powerful weapon he gave was
[54:57] confession
[54:58] he said the most powerful weapon that he
[55:00] gave was
[55:01] on the holy ghost see all these things
[55:03] was quote but you got to go
[55:05] dig see i'm learning that sitting there
[55:07] running my pastor now
[55:09] you got to go dig and see and see what
[55:11] he's really saying
[55:12] ah see i love it
[55:15] i got tired of going around the wall i
[55:18] got tired of going around
[55:20] the wall i needed something to take me
[55:21] here though huh
[55:23] and the only thing trevor could take you
[55:24] here the revelation of the word is that
[55:27] right
[55:27] who could have sat upon any teacher like
[55:30] paul
[55:30] then paul paul set up on the chameleon
[55:33] where paul is set up under community
[55:35] information is good information is good
[55:38] but information is not revelation you
[55:40] are getting revelation
[55:42] you are getting revelation
[55:48] ah the devil's scared of you
[55:52] i'm telling you scared of you huh some
[55:55] people say it's hard
[55:57] some people don't want to go to another
[55:59] level see when someone's coming in you
[56:01] know what a godless sorrow
[56:02] a godless sorrow in the gala repentance
[56:05] is that is that you have to now really
[56:08] omit you know i thought the scripture
[56:11] meant this over here
[56:14] ah but i found out the holy ghost came
[56:18] to correct me
[56:19] and told me it means this over here
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:24] i love that is that right that's what
[56:26] god is bringing here
[56:28] that's what god is bringing unto you if
[56:30] you
[56:31] if you if you don't have this ministry
[56:35] this ministry what god has brought in
[56:37] this end time
[56:38] because that's what we are contending
[56:40] for turning the hearts
[56:42] the hearts of the father back there to
[56:44] the children
[56:45] is that right so when it came in that's
[56:47] what peter was saying
[56:49] when peter was came in there peter was
[56:51] contending for the faith
[56:52] that he is based what both lord and
[56:56] christ is that right he's coming in so
[56:58] peter had to tell them religious demons
[57:01] see the religion look like you're being
[57:02] hard sometimes they might think brother
[57:05] steve
[57:05] said no no no no no no no no when you
[57:08] see a man stand up there
[57:09] and he goes ah
[57:13] that means god done showed him something
[57:15] and i want to know what god showed him
[57:17] you know why it's because his confidence
[57:21] builds my faith
[57:26] that means he believes what he's talking
[57:28] about
[57:29] he knows what he's talking about we
[57:31] can't possibly
[57:32] go in these areas unless god give us
[57:35] grace to go in his head
[57:39] that's why it's such a mess
[57:42] huh hallelujah
[57:45] see paul had all the kids that's why he
[57:47] said the letter killer
[57:49] but the spirit gave his life that's why
[57:52] he says that
[57:53] you are what born again put on the whole
[57:56] arm of god
[57:57] the arm of god is the word of god by the
[58:00] anointing of god
[58:01] is that right and anybody can't have
[58:04] don't say it part of what the prophets
[58:06] say
[58:07] say oh what the prophet said ah
[58:11] he said you got to be he said you got to
[58:13] be called by god
[58:14] you got to be appointed by god you got
[58:16] to be anointed by god
[58:18] you got to be the word of god you got to
[58:20] be the man of god
[58:22] it's who god chose
[58:26] ah i tell you
[58:30] when you look at that's why david come
[58:32] to him
[58:33] when goliath came in he said you're
[58:35] uncircumcised philistine
[58:37] you come and try to do what to defile
[58:40] the army of the living god
[58:42] see when you go around in there if you
[58:44] dig into it
[58:45] what he was telling me come to deform
[58:47] the word they messed up the rankings
[58:50] that's why he couldn't produce what it
[58:51] was supposed to produce
[58:53] they wanted him their way see as the
[58:56] holy ghost said the other day
[58:57] they tried try to put it on the
[58:59] prophet's son no no no no no no
[59:01] no no the prophet exposed that good in
[59:04] romans 1
[59:05] 8 he says saul no he told him he said
[59:09] samuel
[59:10] samuel don't worry about it samuel when
[59:13] saul come i want you to die
[59:15] i want you to feed them because this is
[59:18] what they want
[59:19] samuel he said they're not rejecting you
[59:23] they're rejecting me they really don't
[59:25] want the way of god
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:30] hallelujah
[59:32] what he says he said the prayer
[59:36] when he come in see when you come into
[59:38] the house of the lord
[59:39] and he sees so when you come against
[59:42] religious demons
[59:43] come hard i won't crack a smile with
[59:45] them because i know what you're doing
[59:47] see i see i had the whole witness spirit
[59:49] come up on me one time
[59:51] i'm not talking about the people i'm
[59:52] talking about that spirit that's what
[59:54] we're living now
[59:55] and that spirit came upon me and i was
[59:57] sitting there eating and when i was
[59:58] sitting there eating he turned him
[1:00:00] and and he said how you doing i said
[1:00:02] fine i said how you doing brother
[1:00:04] i knew the fellow over there he went to
[1:00:05] the prison with me i didn't know his
[1:00:07] buddy he didn't know me
[1:00:08] so i was sitting there and he first of
[1:00:10] all he disturbed me when i was eating
[1:00:14] he's already asking for trouble
[1:00:17] you see so i'm sitting in there and i'm
[1:00:20] sitting there down in there
[1:00:21] and eating he said oh brother told me
[1:00:24] christian i said yeah
[1:00:25] he said i said he said who do you
[1:00:27] worship
[1:00:29] god or jesus so i knew what he was going
[1:00:32] to say
[1:00:33] so i know what he was trying to say see
[1:00:36] you don't always have to answer the
[1:00:38] devil
[1:00:39] i said who do you worship
[1:00:42] huh i got a revelation
[1:00:45] huh jesus said in my father's houses
[1:00:49] right over in jeremiah 7.
[1:00:51] is that right he's saying that this was
[1:00:54] the house of prayer is that what he told
[1:00:56] them
[1:00:57] and in that house jesus told him he said
[1:01:00] in this house my name shall be
[1:01:04] there is that right so i looked at him
[1:01:06] and said huh
[1:01:07] who you worship you know that i said let
[1:01:11] me tell you something buddy
[1:01:12] first of all don't never disturb me when
[1:01:14] i'm eating and second of all get out of
[1:01:17] here with your religious demon
[1:01:18] i don't play with the religious theme
[1:01:20] they say but kelly that's hard no it's
[1:01:22] not ah
[1:01:24] probably god said when they came in the
[1:01:26] house of the lord
[1:01:28] where's the first place jesus went
[1:01:30] riding on that donkey
[1:01:31] the scripture says judgment begins
[1:01:34] in the house of the lord the first place
[1:01:37] jesus
[1:01:38] went he went in there after the
[1:01:40] religious demons is that right
[1:01:42] prophet of god said what he said when he
[1:01:44] witnessed the money
[1:01:45] he said he told him to take the coin out
[1:01:47] of the fish's mouth
[1:01:48] he said that was the type of what the
[1:01:51] trustees is that right
[1:01:52] he said when they got to come and get a
[1:01:54] rebuke in one time don't don't charlie i
[1:01:56] know y'all gonna love the pastor
[1:01:58] but sometimes he's gonna have to come up
[1:02:00] here might rebuke you now
[1:02:01] is that eye is that right because you
[1:02:04] see a devil trying to enter in is that
[1:02:06] right
[1:02:06] but then he said to the deacon he said
[1:02:08] when jesus came in
[1:02:10] cracked the whip turned the table over
[1:02:13] he said that was the office of the
[1:02:14] deacon
[1:02:15] is that right he didn't play with them
[1:02:16] religious devils
[1:02:18] let's give him a clap often thank you
[1:02:20] jesus
[1:02:22] hallelujah
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:26] look what he said he says you can't
[1:02:30] he says the prayer is the most powerful
[1:02:33] weapon god
[1:02:34] gave to humans it can change god's mind
[1:02:37] for a purpose it says this prayer
[1:02:41] that reaches through knowing touches
[1:02:43] god's throne
[1:02:44] this prayer we talk about the prayer of
[1:02:46] faith confidence in the prayer of faith
[1:02:49] you can have confidence in the prayer of
[1:02:50] faith he says that
[1:02:52] that it touches god's throne rests
[1:02:55] unshakably in the assurance
[1:02:57] that the answer will come in god's
[1:03:00] time isn't that right you're gonna go in
[1:03:03] it
[1:03:04] i think it was a message let me say i
[1:03:06] thought i wrote it down here
[1:03:08] and you can go and check it you see it
[1:03:10] it it
[1:03:11] ah i'll find it but you can go in there
[1:03:14] and
[1:03:14] and he had it i'll find it
[1:03:18] it'll come to me but uh where where
[1:03:21] brother brandon worked that real
[1:03:22] real well he was telling people he was
[1:03:24] helping them letting them know where
[1:03:26] they felt maybe they wasn't healed or
[1:03:28] they keep flipping
[1:03:30] back but he brought it to them and let
[1:03:33] them know
[1:03:34] that you're good you have your healing
[1:03:36] but god vindicated it in his
[1:03:38] time when god does that you see
[1:03:42] i thought i wrote that down here but but
[1:03:44] we'll get it he says
[1:03:45] next it says it's a it's prayer totally
[1:03:49] dependent upon the holy spirit a prayer
[1:03:52] of faith is totally dependent
[1:03:53] upon the holy spirit you are sure of
[1:03:57] being guided in the subject of prayer
[1:04:00] consciousness of being quickened in
[1:04:02] faith during prayer
[1:04:04] the spirit confirms to you that the
[1:04:06] request
[1:04:07] is essential it's an essential prayer
[1:04:12] the holy ghost will let you know that's
[1:04:15] why he says
[1:04:16] what is a essential prayer or something
[1:04:19] we cannot do without
[1:04:21] see they consider us essential i worked
[1:04:23] there for walmart we've been working
[1:04:24] since march
[1:04:26] that's why i need your prayers we get
[1:04:28] around they've been working they
[1:04:29] consider us
[1:04:30] essential we supply 91
[1:04:34] of america so when they get around
[1:04:37] they try to baby them with this little
[1:04:39] change give them that little change
[1:04:41] but it's essential remember the
[1:04:43] disciples of john said
[1:04:45] then teacher the disciples said teach us
[1:04:47] how to pray
[1:04:48] like john disciples is that right what
[1:04:50] did he say
[1:04:51] our father which are in heaven
[1:04:54] hallowed be thy name holy holy be thy
[1:04:58] name
[1:04:59] thy what kingdom come so that die what
[1:05:04] you cannot walk right you cannot talk
[1:05:06] white
[1:05:07] you cannot pray right what did i just
[1:05:09] say in this prayer
[1:05:11] the holy ghost comes in intercession and
[1:05:14] make
[1:05:14] droning for you is that right you cannot
[1:05:17] do it
[1:05:18] that's why he said this prayer is
[1:05:20] essential
[1:05:21] god father which are in heaven hallowed
[1:05:22] be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:05:25] thy holy ghost come so that thy what
[1:05:28] will can be
[1:05:29] done is that right on earth as it is in
[1:05:32] heaven
[1:05:33] forgive us as we forgive those
[1:05:35] dedicators is that right
[1:05:36] lead us not into temptation but to do
[1:05:39] what
[1:05:39] but deliver us from evil thou art the
[1:05:42] kingdom
[1:05:42] that are the power that wants the glory
[1:05:45] hallelujah
[1:05:47] we're talking about do you have
[1:05:50] confidence
[1:05:51] in your prayer see stop letting the
[1:05:54] devil try to condemn you see before god
[1:05:57] even brought the law
[1:05:58] before he even brought it out there it
[1:06:00] was things that god
[1:06:01] already didn't like remember in heaven
[1:06:03] he didn't like
[1:06:04] killing he didn't like stealing he
[1:06:06] didn't like adultery
[1:06:08] you see he didn't like those things so
[1:06:10] satan come and try to
[1:06:12] beat you in your mind is that right he
[1:06:14] tried to come and try to condemn you
[1:06:16] but the scripture says there is no
[1:06:18] condemnation who those that are in
[1:06:20] christ jesus
[1:06:21] that walk not after the flesh but walk
[1:06:23] after the spirit is that right
[1:06:25] we come our god is a mighty god is that
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:28] i'm telling you hallelujah
[1:06:33] he said look he said now he said this is
[1:06:36] essential it's absolutely the prayer of
[1:06:39] faith
[1:06:40] it's a prayer totally committed to sing
[1:06:44] god answers realize intense
[1:06:47] prayer in its highest form as
[1:06:50] a prayer of faith commits to you
[1:06:53] determination
[1:06:54] like a vow is that right remember when
[1:06:57] the widow got around there was praying
[1:06:59] for
[1:07:00] the promise the widow she got there and
[1:07:02] she was praying there
[1:07:04] on for a child when there and the uh
[1:07:06] let's turn it to luke 18.
[1:07:12] hallelujah
[1:07:15] i know some are out there listening in
[1:07:18] we
[1:07:18] thank you for your prayers out there
[1:07:22] look what he said luke 18 chapter one
[1:07:26] verse one it says he spake a parable
[1:07:28] unto them
[1:07:29] to this end that men all to us always
[1:07:33] pray
[1:07:33] and not to uh saint see they're not
[1:07:36] moving we're gonna show you
[1:07:38] tell you why these armors aren't moving
[1:07:40] she said put on the whole
[1:07:42] arm of god so that you may be able to
[1:07:44] withstand the wiles
[1:07:46] of the devil in the end time is that
[1:07:48] right in these last days
[1:07:50] the armor of god which is the word of
[1:07:52] god that's anointed by the spirit of god
[1:07:55] the helmet of salvation your salvation
[1:07:57] is already paid for
[1:07:59] is that right you're breastfeeding
[1:08:01] righteousness
[1:08:02] we got to realize jesus christ when he
[1:08:04] came in he died on calvary and he shed
[1:08:06] his blood
[1:08:07] for you and i we're supposed to be
[1:08:09] living a victorious life
[1:08:11] what are you talking about is that right
[1:08:13] we didn't know that's a demon
[1:08:14] see brother branham told us when they
[1:08:16] say they got a virus
[1:08:18] when they got when they don't know what
[1:08:20] something is he said they call it a
[1:08:22] virus is that right
[1:08:23] is that when they call it a virus all it
[1:08:25] is is just a devil
[1:08:27] and that devil and that demon that's out
[1:08:29] there and they come out there
[1:08:30] it's just a never another part of the
[1:08:32] flu is the flu type symptom
[1:08:34] but you have to understand god told us
[1:08:37] what
[1:08:38] if god said greater is he
[1:08:41] that is in thee then he that is in the
[1:08:44] world
[1:08:44] it's going to come at you is that right
[1:08:47] but it's left up to you
[1:08:48] if you accept it or not is that right
[1:08:51] you said that it's a real
[1:08:52] demon you don't have to accept nothing
[1:08:55] that the devil sinned upon you
[1:08:56] he said i'm going to show that you are a
[1:08:59] different group of people
[1:09:00] excuse me the different group of people
[1:09:02] he said none of the diseases none of the
[1:09:05] plagues so come upon
[1:09:06] my children is that what he said
[1:09:09] given us to what the holy ghost the holy
[1:09:12] ghost
[1:09:13] brother branham said is nothing else
[1:09:16] that wealthy people can try to go to the
[1:09:18] moon
[1:09:19] the wealthy people can try to get some
[1:09:22] mountains and dig holes in the mountains
[1:09:24] the brother and that he said the only
[1:09:26] thing is going to protect them
[1:09:28] from the whole from the atomic bomb is
[1:09:31] the holy ghost
[1:09:34] nothing but the holy ghost see
[1:09:38] that's why jesus came in and and he told
[1:09:40] us these things let me keep going for a
[1:09:42] good old trap
[1:09:42] he said look what he says hallelujah
[1:09:45] look at this woman
[1:09:47] she knew who she was the prayer of faith
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] she knew who she was she had confidence
[1:09:55] in her prayer
[1:09:59] remind me of what i've been not saying
[1:10:00] god told us to respect that office
[1:10:02] right hallelujah he said look
[1:10:06] he said he said she said verse two
[1:10:10] there was a in a city a judge which
[1:10:12] feared not god

[1:13:02] like a dove lightening upon him
[1:13:04] he said lord a voice from heaven saying
[1:13:06] this is my beloved son of whom i'm well
[1:13:08] pleased is that right now god and man
[1:13:11] we're going to look at a lesson on that
[1:13:12] one day

[1:13:17] a lamb and a sheep or a lamb and a sheep
[1:13:19] obey your goat don't hello goat

[1:13:24] is that right
[1:13:25] yeah you won't be able to tell the
[1:13:26] difference but i tell you
[1:13:28] that's why i said you know them by their
[1:13:30] fruits you'll know them by their life
[1:13:32] you know them by giving them the word
[1:13:34] test that's how you'll know who they are
[1:13:36] is that right look what it says 4
[1:13:39] chapter 4
[1:13:40] chapter 4 and verse 1 then was jesus let
[1:13:43] up of the west
[1:13:44] spirit so you have to be in the spirit

[1:14:01] with this letter but it's not bringing a
[1:14:04] revelation of the word
[1:14:05] the revelation only comes from god is

[1:14:42] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[1:14:45] church and the gates of heaven shall not
[1:14:47] prevail against it
[1:14:48] upon the revelation of the word of who
[1:14:50] jesus christ
[1:14:51] really is he's the son of god and he's

[1:15:26] by every
[1:15:27] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:15:29] god he said now look he got around there

[1:15:34] the high pinnacle let's drop down to
[1:15:35] verse seven look how he answered them
[1:15:37] he said jesus said unto him it is
[1:15:39] written then again

[1:15:44] see he thought he was just talking to
[1:15:45] jesus no no no he was dealing with god
[1:15:50] ah

[1:17:08] or something firm trust the synonym of
[1:17:11] continent is trust
[1:17:12] belief faith we can move on
[1:17:16] let's look at this here we know here
[1:17:19] i'm at the jump a little bit look at
[1:17:21] verse uh we go to verse help us lord 36.
[1:17:24] we know here is
[1:17:28] hallelujah yeah jesus is getting ready
[1:17:30] to go into the garden
[1:17:32] and when jesus is getting ready to go
[1:17:34] into the garden he has to press
[1:17:36] you know sometimes you have to press
[1:17:38] sometime you had a long day
[1:17:40] i know it's that way because we're still
[1:17:41] in the flesh did god give us seed taste
[1:17:44] filled smelling here
[1:17:45] that's the contact that's specially
[1:17:47] somebody here is that right and the
[1:17:49] spirit man
[1:17:50] is what is what is the will of god is
[1:17:52] that right
[1:17:53] that's what led them in is did you let
[1:17:55] the devil come in
[1:17:57] is because according to your will is
[1:17:59] that right but down in the soul
[1:18:01] determines it lives on the word of what
[1:18:03] faith
[1:18:04] faith and revelation is that right but
[1:18:06] now jesus was getting ready to go into
[1:18:08] the garden
[1:18:09] but he brought the best that he could
[1:18:11] with him faith hope
[1:18:12] and charity he brought the best with him
[1:18:14] he couldn't ring him but they got a
[1:18:16] little weary
[1:18:17] he recognized this time he couldn't go
[1:18:19] in there with them he got to go by
[1:18:21] himself
[1:18:22] the bible said he had to go in there on
[1:18:23] three encounters once he went in there
[1:18:25] on three encounters
[1:18:26] i'm telling you he had to claim it he
[1:18:28] had to press he had the oil he had to
[1:18:30] fight those demons
[1:18:32] he needed help down in there i know they
[1:18:34] was trying to stop him but he had to get
[1:18:36] the calvary he had to go shut our blood
[1:18:38] he had to take our sins is that right
[1:18:40] living he loved me
[1:18:41] died and he saved me bury to carry my
[1:18:44] sins far away
[1:18:45] that's what he tried to do he tried to
[1:18:47] get jesus to use the word on himself
[1:18:50] he tried to get him to use the child he
[1:18:52] tried to stop him from going to calvary
[1:18:54] but what greater than he that was in me
[1:18:56] and he that was in the world
[1:19:00] hallelujah we're talking about prayer
[1:19:04] let's walk it down look at verse 39
[1:19:07] he says and he went a little father
[1:19:10] and fell on his face and did what prayed
[1:19:14] now here this scripture how he's
[1:19:17] responded
[1:19:18] this is the only encounter that he said
[1:19:22] this
[1:19:23] in gethsemane he didn't say it in mark
[1:19:26] he didn't say it in luke and he didn't
[1:19:28] say it in john
[1:19:30] he only said it here in matthew let us
[1:19:33] read
[1:19:33] and see he said he prayed saying oh
[1:19:36] my father if it be possible let this cup
[1:19:40] pass
[1:19:40] from me nevertheless
[1:19:44] not as i will but what
[1:19:47] but battle win it was really over then
[1:19:49] you know
[1:19:51] it was over there once he said let that
[1:19:53] will be done it was over
[1:19:55] huh so he got around in there because we
[1:19:58] remember the property god told us he
[1:20:00] said once he came out of the eaton
[1:20:03] i mean gethsemane he had already taken
[1:20:05] the garden of eden back
[1:20:06] he said it was back then ah
[1:20:11] he says and he come unto the disciples
[1:20:13] and find
[1:20:14] them asleep and save him and then what
[1:20:16] could not watch with me one hour
[1:20:18] he said watch and pray look what he's
[1:20:20] telling them that he enter not into
[1:20:22] temptation
[1:20:23] the the spirit indeed is willing and the
[1:20:26] flesh is weak see that's why he said our
[1:20:28] father's on him he said lead us not into
[1:20:30] what
[1:20:31] temptation he said verse 42 and he said
[1:20:34] he went away again the second time and
[1:20:37] prayed saying oh my father
[1:20:39] this cup may not pass away from me
[1:20:41] except i drink it
[1:20:42] thy will be done let's drop over here
[1:20:46] to uh verse 50. we know the story there
[1:20:49] but for the sake of time
[1:20:51] you can go back and read it look at
[1:20:52] verse 50. he come in verse 47.
[1:20:55] he says and while he had spake to judas
[1:20:58] one of the twelve
[1:20:59] came in with him a great multitude with
[1:21:01] sword slaves from the chief priests and
[1:21:03] the elders
[1:21:04] drop down to fifty he says and jesus
[1:21:06] said unto him
[1:21:07] friend wherefore art i come
[1:21:12] see what he says he says
[1:21:16] a character brother branham said a
[1:21:18] character
[1:21:20] displays your victory
[1:21:23] jesus knew he had victory
[1:21:27] he said my friend he came
[1:21:30] after all press for you and i after he
[1:21:33] had the breakthrough
[1:21:34] query but he still displayed the
[1:21:38] character
[1:21:39] that god sent him for you look what he
[1:21:42] says here
[1:21:43] he says now verse 51
[1:21:46] he says and behold one of them which
[1:21:49] with jesus stretched out his hand and
[1:21:51] drew his sword
[1:21:52] and struck his servant of the high
[1:21:54] priest and smote off his
[1:21:56] ear he said then said jesus unto him
[1:21:59] put up again thy sword and through his
[1:22:03] place
[1:22:04] for all they that take the sewer shall
[1:22:07] do what
[1:22:08] perish with the sword he said thinketh
[1:22:10] thou
[1:22:11] that i cannot now what
[1:22:14] pray to my father
[1:22:18] and he shall presently give me more than
[1:22:21] 12
[1:22:22] legions of an angel but how then shall
[1:22:24] the scripture be fulfilled
[1:22:26] that thus it must be that the lord jesus
[1:22:30] came in his hour here now
[1:22:32] it's so much more but i gotta stop he
[1:22:34] came in his hour here now
[1:22:36] to what take away our sins
[1:22:40] fulfill take away all the pain take away
[1:22:43] all the
[1:22:44] take the abuse take all the persecution
[1:22:47] but he knew after he went through the
[1:22:49] garden he showed the power he could have
[1:22:52] spoke the word but he did not say that
[1:22:54] he said don't you know

[1:28:22] handcuff of praise this evening
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:26] amen amen
[1:28:32] he was just saying something there this
[1:28:34] evening
[1:28:35] that touched my heart i wrote it down
[1:28:39] here let me just pull it up
[1:28:43] but he asked that question to us this
[1:28:45] evening he said
[1:28:46] do you have confidence in your prayer
[1:28:49] and i believe god wants us to have
[1:28:50] confidence in our prayers
[1:28:52] that's what he's preaching about a
[1:28:53] little bit this evening and and when we
[1:28:55] come before god and we kneel and we pray
[1:28:58] i mean there's times to cry and there's
[1:29:00] times to to
[1:29:02] like ask god for forgiveness of the
[1:29:05] mistakes that we've made and those
[1:29:06] things but sometimes i believe god wants
[1:29:08] us to come
[1:29:09] come down on our knees and speak to him
[1:29:10] as as a father
[1:29:12] every time we approach our our father
[1:29:14] for something our dad our natural dad do
[1:29:16] we do we beg him do we
[1:29:18] do we cry and and when we ask for
[1:29:21] something or do we walk up to him and
[1:29:22] say hey i need this can you give it to
[1:29:24] me
[1:29:25] you know art how much more our heavenly
[1:29:26] father he wants us to come boldly before
[1:29:28] his throne
[1:29:29] he wants us to come as a son not as a
[1:29:31] weak christian but as a strong christian
[1:29:33] because that's what he
[1:29:35] created that's what he's done for you if
[1:29:37] it wasn't for him we would be weak
[1:29:38] christians but he's given us the ability
[1:29:41] through his word to be be strong and to
[1:29:43] stand before him
[1:29:44] righteous pure and he wants us to see
[1:29:47] that in ourselves he can tell us
[1:29:48] servicing and service out that
[1:29:50] that he's had grace for us mercy for us
[1:29:53] but he wants us to have a revelation of
[1:29:55] it and to come
[1:29:56] before him as a child of god and speak
[1:29:58] to him as
[1:29:59] as royalty he said we're amateur gods on
[1:30:01] earth
[1:30:02] so sometimes rather than than praying
[1:30:04] for something you just speak the word

[1:30:08] believers we're third
[1:30:10] believers and we can speak to that
[1:30:11] mountain and move it i believe you gotta
[1:30:13] be careful because i believe there's so
[1:30:14] much power and the things that we say
[1:30:16] and the things that we do because of
[1:30:18] what god given us
[1:30:19] that we have to be careful to pray for
[1:30:20] his will so we don't come out of his
[1:30:22] will
[1:30:22] but in the end of the day he wants the
[1:30:24] holy ghost more for you than you want it
[1:30:26] for yourself
[1:30:27] a closer walk more for you than you want
[1:30:29] it for yourself that's what he wants for
[1:30:30] his children
[1:30:32] so do you have confidence in your prayer
[1:30:34] ask yourself that tonight when you go
[1:30:35] down on your knees to pray this evening
[1:30:37] ask yourself do you have confidence in
[1:30:38] your prayer and if you don't

[1:33:06] oh it's already done
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:11] oh the victory is won
[1:33:14] the battle is over
[1:33:18] it's already done i know that it's
[1:33:22] done i'm gonna have to teach you all
[1:33:23] that sister brenda lewis used to attend
[1:33:25] the church i used to go to and she wrote
[1:33:27] that song
[1:33:28] and she said that people changed it on
[1:33:30] her she wrote it as a fast song as a
[1:33:31] praise song
[1:33:33] not a slow worship song and she wrote it
[1:33:35] it's already done
[1:33:36] it's already done the victory is won and
[1:33:38] the battle is over because she said if
[1:33:40] we read the back of the book we can see
[1:33:41] in revelations that we won the victory
[1:33:43] so the victory is won the battle is over
[1:33:46] it's already done
[1:33:47] so the the message kind of changed it on
[1:33:49] her a little bit but it's a faster song
[1:33:51] and the words are a little different so
[1:33:53] we'll have to teach that to y'all
[1:33:55] but you all have a good night this
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:34:02] evening
