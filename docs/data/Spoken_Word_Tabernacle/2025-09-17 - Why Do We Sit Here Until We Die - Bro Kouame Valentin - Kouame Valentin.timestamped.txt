[37:14] good.

[39:07] So many times I've questioned
[39:11] certain circumstances
[39:15] or things I could not understand.
[39:23] And many times in trials
[39:27] weakness blurs my vision
[39:31] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[39:37] Oh, then I am reminded
[39:42] I've never been forsaken.
[39:46] I've never had to stand the test alone.
[39:53] And as I look at all the victories,
[39:57] the spirit risees up in. It's through

[40:22] he ever offered
[40:25] our victory without fighting. But he
[40:28] said it will always come in time.

[41:00] Oh,
[41:02] I know within myself that I will surely
[41:07] perish.
[41:08] But if I trust the hand of God, he'll
[41:12] shield the flames again.
[41:16] again.
[41:17] [Music]

[42:30] fighting. But he said help would always
[42:33] come inside.

[42:41] the valley of decision,

[1:01:31] That's the trusty right there. And bring
[1:01:33] your Bible. And then the message in the
[1:01:35] hour and then we start soaring. I I
[1:01:38] thought I can dig deeper, but what the
[1:01:40] way the Holy Spirit is opening it right
[1:01:43] now, I don't know. We will take these
[1:01:45] two series and I have to take my time
[1:01:48] because we need to dig into the root and
[1:01:51] begin to go back up again all the way.
[1:01:54] The young man's the young sisters are
[1:01:56] already well prepared. But this is the
[1:01:58] people who are already in the marriage
[1:02:00] for years.

[1:02:11] devil from our financial work. so that
[1:02:14] we can be free. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; So, bring your Bible. You sit there, we
[1:02:18] eat, we finish, and we get into it and
[1:02:20] we sow. It might take I don't know how
[1:02:22] long it's going to take because uh I
[1:02:23] went to sleep too late because I was
[1:02:25] getting inspiration. I keep taking he
[1:02:27] give me he give you the scripture then
[1:02:29] he give you the code. He give you the
[1:02:30] scripture. So, I have to take write it
[1:02:32] down quickly on my phone quick to save
[1:02:34] before he goes away. So, he keep
[1:02:36] unfolding unfolding. So, we see how he
[1:02:38] can go. So, don't expect me to go one
[1:02:40] day and finish everything. This will
[1:02:42] take time because it's a surgery. You

[1:02:55] here. He can even preach in English. But
[1:02:57] if he preach in English, it takes a
[1:02:59] little bit of time. So I want him to be
[1:03:00] free to flow the the anointing really
[1:03:03] easily. So I will be translating. So
[1:03:06] brother Valentine also is a pastor from
[1:03:08] Maverick Coast. They usually travel
[1:03:10] together with brother Paul. You know

[1:05:45] to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:05:50] It's a wonderful thing.
[1:05:54] So I would like to thank brother Stephen
[1:05:59] for the great honor that he he has
[1:06:02] granted unto us tonight

[1:06:29] and thank you for the great work that
[1:06:31] has been uh accomplished
[1:06:35] to hear the musician playing
[1:06:38] and the choir singing.
[1:06:42] I felt the presence of the Lord
[1:06:48] atmosphere. And you know when you get to
[1:06:50] a church with such an atmosphere,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say the Holy Spirit
[1:06:57] will speak or heaven will speak.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So to save time I know that the
[1:07:09] ministers has been presented here
[1:07:11] already. So let's go to the main thing.
[1:07:16] So let's go straight to the word.
[1:07:25] It's it will be a lengthy reading. I'm
[1:07:27] going to read in second king chapter 7.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; So, brother Steven, you go ahead and
[1:07:34] read it in English.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; The whole chapter.
[1:07:38] So, the whole chapter of second king
[1:07:41] chapter 7.
[1:07:44] Second king chapter 7. If you dare, you
[1:07:47] can say, "Amen."
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Then Elisha said, "Hear ye
[1:07:53] the word of the Lord. Thus sayaith the
[1:07:56] Lord, tomorrow about this time shall a
[1:08:00] measure of fine flour be sold for a
[1:08:02] shekele, and two measures of barley for
[1:08:06] a shekele in the gate of Samaria." Then
[1:08:09] a lord on whose hand the king lean
[1:08:12] answered the man of God and said,
[1:08:15] "Behold, if the Lord will make windows
[1:08:18] of in in heaven, might this thing be?"
[1:08:21] And he said, "Behold, thou shalt see it
[1:08:24] with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat
[1:08:27] thereof." And there were four lepous men
[1:08:30] at the entering in the in of the gate.
[1:08:33] And they said one to another, why
[1:08:37] sit we here until we die?
[1:08:43] If we say we will enter into the city,
[1:08:46] then the famine is in the city, and we
[1:08:48] shall die there. And if we sit still
[1:08:51] here, we die also. Now therefore come
[1:08:55] and let us fall unto the host of the
[1:08:57] Syrians. And if they save us alive, we
[1:09:00] shall leave, and if they kill us, we
[1:09:03] shall but die. And they rose up in the
[1:09:06] twilight to go unto the camp of the
[1:09:09] Syrians. And when they were come to the
[1:09:12] uttermost part of the camp of Syrian,
[1:09:14] behold, there was no man there. For the
[1:09:17] Lord has made the host of the Syrian to
[1:09:20] hear a noise of chariots and a noise of
[1:09:23] horses,
[1:09:25] even the noise of a great host. And they
[1:09:28] say one to another, "Lo, the king of
[1:09:31] Israel has hired against us the kings of
[1:09:34] the high and the kings of the Egyptian
[1:09:37] to come upon us." Wherefore they rose
[1:09:40] and fled into in the twilight and left
[1:09:43] their tents and their horses and their
[1:09:45] asses, even the camp as it was, and fled
[1:09:49] for their life. And when these lepers
[1:09:51] came to the uttermost part of the camp,
[1:09:54] they went into one tent and did eat and
[1:09:57] drink and carried them silver and gold
[1:10:00] and remnant and went and hid it and came
[1:10:03] again and enter into another tent and
[1:10:05] carried them also and went and hid it.
[1:10:08] Then they say one to another, "We do not
[1:10:11] well. This day is a day of a good of
[1:10:14] good tidings and we hold our peace. If
[1:10:17] we tar it till the morning light, some
[1:10:20] mischief will come upon us. Now
[1:10:22] therefore, come that we may go and tell
[1:10:24] the king's household. So they came and
[1:10:27] called unto the porter of the city. And
[1:10:29] they told them, saying, We came to the
[1:10:32] camp of Syrian of the Syrians. And
[1:10:34] behold, there was no man there, neither
[1:10:37] voice me voice of a man, but horses tied
[1:10:41] and asses tied and tent as they were.
[1:10:44] And he told and he called the porters
[1:10:46] and they told it to the king's house
[1:10:49] within. And the king arose in the night
[1:10:52] and said unto his servant, I will now
[1:10:54] show you what the Syrian have done to
[1:10:56] us. They know that we be hungry.
[1:10:59] Therefore are they gone out of the camp
[1:11:01] to hide themselves in the field, saying,
[1:11:03] when they come out of the city, we shall
[1:11:06] catch them alive and get into the city.
[1:11:09] And one of his servant answer and say,
[1:11:11] let some take a pray thee five of the
[1:11:14] horses that remain which are left in the
[1:11:16] city. Behold, they are as all the
[1:11:19] multitude of Israel that are left in
[1:11:21] them. Behold, I say they are even as all
[1:11:24] the multitude of Israel that are
[1:11:27] consumed, and let us send and see. They
[1:11:30] took therefore two chariot two horses,
[1:11:33] two chariot horses, and the king sent
[1:11:36] after the host of the Syrians, saying,
[1:11:38] "Go and see." And they went after them
[1:11:41] unto Jordan. And lo, all the way was
[1:11:44] full of garments
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and vessels,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; you may be seated,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; which the Syrian has cast away in their
[1:11:53] haste. And the messengers returned and
[1:11:56] told the king. And the people went out
[1:11:59] and spoiled the tent of the Syrian. So a
[1:12:02] measure of fan flour
[1:12:05] flour was sold for shekel. And two
[1:12:08] measures of barley for shekele according
[1:12:11] to the word of the Lord. And the king
[1:12:14] appointed the Lord on whose hand he lean
[1:12:17] to have the charge of the gate. And the
[1:12:19] people throtten throd upon him in the
[1:12:22] gate. And he died as the man of God have
[1:12:25] said, who spake when the king came down
[1:12:29] in him? Came came down to him. And it
[1:12:32] came to pass as the man of God had
[1:12:34] spoken to the king, saying, "Two
[1:12:36] measures of barley for a shekel, and a
[1:12:39] measure of fine flour for a shekel shall
[1:12:42] be tomorrow about this time in the gate
[1:12:44] of Samaria." And that Lord answered the
[1:12:47] man of God, and saying, Now, behold, if
[1:12:49] the Lord should make windows in heaven,
[1:12:52] must such a thing be. And he said,
[1:12:55] Behold, thou shalt see it with thine
[1:12:57] eyes, but shall not eat thereof. And so
[1:13:00] he fell out unto him, for the people
[1:13:03] throwed upon him in the gate, and he
[1:13:07] died.

[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] You know it's very easy to preach in
[1:16:24] your own church.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know why I'm saying that? Right.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Usually brother Brandham say truly that
[1:16:37] you don't get used to the pulpit.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's the truth
[1:16:44] because a servant because uh a servant
[1:16:47] anytime he want to come to the pulpit
[1:16:51] We usually feel pressure minister
[1:16:53] understand what I'm saying.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So blessed be the name of the lord.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; But the reason why I say is that because
[1:17:01] it's a truth.
[1:17:05] When you preach and the church is
[1:17:07] preaching with you.
[1:17:15] I just heard brother uh brother brother
[1:17:17] Steven saying that last Sunday you pull
[1:17:20] so much until uh he was worn out
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; and that's the preaching of the word.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; The preaching of the word
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; goes with hallelujah and amen.
[1:17:37] Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Are you do you agree with me?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Because where life is
[1:17:46] You must have know
[1:17:48] where the word is. Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; We have hallelujah. We have hosana.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; When the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] when he was getting into Jerusalem,
[1:18:02] glory be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; We heard hallelujah.
[1:18:06] We heard worship. Amen. and even
[1:18:09] somebody
[1:18:11] but people say those people are making
[1:18:13] so much noise
[1:18:15] and somebody might think you making
[1:18:16] noises.
[1:18:18] Somebody might think you are making
[1:18:20] noises but you're not making noises.
[1:18:23] You are woriing. Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] Because the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; he usually come down upon worship,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; upon
[1:18:36] acclamation.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And we must worship the word.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You must say amen to the word.
[1:18:46] When the word is preached, you must
[1:18:47] clap. When you say amen,
[1:18:51] you are actually saying that you believe
[1:18:54] in the word. And if you believe the
[1:18:56] word, God must bless you
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; because you believe the word.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God tonight
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; tonight. Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I would like to preach
[1:19:15] upon
[1:19:19] why do we sit here until we die.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:25] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Why do we sit here
[1:19:30] until we die?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; No, brothers and sisters, we won't sit
[1:19:35] here
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; to die
[1:19:39] because we have the word.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; We have the message. Can you say amen?
[1:19:46] God gave us
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; the word
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and with the word
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; with faith
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; the believer.

[1:20:05] life and death.

[1:20:11] here and amen.
[1:20:13] Life and death
[1:20:15] is at the power of your tongue.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; So tonight you have the power
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; to speak the word
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; for healing.

[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; as seen in the day of judges,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; a little old fellow named Shemar,
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; it's found over in the book of Judges,
[1:21:36] the Philistine will come in
[1:21:39] and take off everything that they had.
[1:21:44] Every time they raise a crop,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; then the Philistine come in
[1:21:52] and get what they had they had and take
[1:21:54] it off.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a time,
[1:22:00] robbing them
[1:22:02] just like it is today.
[1:22:05] about every time

[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; that is coming in to rob you.
[1:22:49] When you got your faith placed in God,
[1:22:53] leave it there.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That is right.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; that the devil
[1:23:20] is a robber. The devil,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; he's a liar.
[1:23:25] But tonight,

[1:23:29] everything we rob from you,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; everything he robs from you tonight,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; he must restore it. Say amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Tonight,
[1:23:42] the enemy,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; he's a liar.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; He's coming to rob you.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; He's coming to destroy. But tonight,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; we have

[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 31.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And this Philistine
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; about time
[1:24:14] the Israelite didn't have any king then.
[1:24:18] And just about the time that they had uh
[1:24:21] they get their crops
[1:24:25] all raised and harvest
[1:24:28] all the hard work done.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; It would come in would come the
[1:24:34] Philistines
[1:24:36] and take off and take what they had

[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; If we sit here, we die. If we go down to
[1:56:58] the camp of the Syrians,
[1:57:00] if they kill us, we just die because we
[1:57:04] are going to die anyway.
