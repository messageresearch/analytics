everybody happy tonight are you happy a lot of the are you happy blessed be the name of the lord amen amen amen hallelujah we appreciate everybody pressing tonight we know the devil was trying to put one thing here do this do this do this do this but by the grace of god we are here tonight amen with a sound mind to worship the living god continue to pray for the afflicted among us we have people that are still suffering so in your prayer always remember them amen also remember the building work starting this week in prayer so that everything will be moving by the grace of god hallelujah lord's willing we schedule this probably couple months if i have uh if i remember well probably couple months brother andrew glover will be preaching for us on sunday lord's willing so being prayer and under expectation you know thank you brother you know brother andrew glover pretty good amen call them the fireballs they're on fire since you know them and they remain on fire that's what we want thank you very much magician we will richly bless you let's go to the word i hope you got your bible are you ready blessed be the name of the lord you've been chewing from that sunday service thinking about stuff at work checking your own lives amen it is mercy it is the mercy of god he could have left you go just like this again five ten more years and you keep struggling amen but this is ongoing time amen everything must be unfolded delivered taken away from you everything that is not like god have to be corrected amen we're not going to leave deserve a defeated brother when we leave we are leaving a victorious church amen amen blessed be the name of the lord genesis chapter 3 it is coming genesis chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah yes somebody and i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed and eat the seed of the woman shall bruise your head we already discussed with you about this when we talked about the constellation of the serpent amen how much is have to hold it by the tail and not by the head everybody clear and it shall bruise your head that is christ and you shall bruise his heel so the position of the serpent or the position of the devil right here is an attacker that is directed to the hill not to the head amen when you look at christ the crust is aiming for the head but the serpent is aiming for the hill everybody clear job to genesis chapter 25 we're still dealing with our preparation to the second banquet amen we're going to dig dig dig dig then we go back on surface amen when we get back on surface you are light you're not more no more heaviness attached to you genesis chapter 25 if you dare you can say a man a few people you need to preach with me you know me you know my style now so you're quiet i'm going to repeat it amen genesis 25 verse 26 and after that came his brother out this is jacob and his hand took hold on esau's here everybody here so by birth jacob is a mess remember last on sunday we stopped at jacob you might be seated so by birth by birth jacob is a mess because jacob is holding the heel of esau he saw who the lord hated amen but that's where that's the position of jacob at birth by birth it's a mess everybody clear and his hand took hold of eso's heel and his name was called jacob which means water is a planter or a deceiver a man by birth he's born in a mess he's born a deceiver by birth there's nothing he can do he can't help it a deceiver by birth anybody clear and isaac was three score years old when she bore them everybody clear go to genesis 27 everybody there genesis chapter 27 verse 36 i can speak this but i want you to see it yourself hallelujah everybody there let's go to verse 35 and he said your brother came with subtility amen if you go back in genesis 3 you're going to see that that word subtility was first used on the beast in eden because the bible said that there was a beast there the serpent was a very sad beast amen and there is a meaning to that so now esau is qualifying jacob that he used the same tactic why because when he was born he was holding the hill of who of his soul the position of the devil anybody clear verse 36 and he said is not his name is not he rightly named jacob in other words the name really fits his character that's the reason why they call him jacob amen because his life is proving the meaning of the word jacob anybody here for he had supplanted me in other words he have deceived me he have taken my place by deception he has supplanted me these two times he took away my birth heart and behold now he has taken away my blessing and he said have you not reserved a blessing for me is so never understood that the birthright is connected it's a combo with the blessing once you lose the birthright automatically the the the blessing that is connected to the birthright is gone amen he thought he can keep the blessing and reject the birth right that's what the people that approach christ trying to do they want the blessing of christ they want christ to bless them but they want nothing to do with the death white they don't want to do anything with their birth they don't want to change their birth they don't want to have a breath right everything they want is just blessing blessing blessing blessing but that birthright is connected to the blessing everybody clear so far let's go to genesis chapter 32 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah brother david give me a little bit the devil has been struggling with my voice it's not corona but i refuse to take medication genesis 32 verse 24 if you dare you can say amen and jacob was left alone this is a personal experience amen nobody with you you must be left alone with god you and the lord yourself nobody there everybody else not his wife who are not there his concubine were not there his children were not there it was jacob and the angel alone amen praise be the name of the lord and the wrestler a man with him until the breaking of the day water wrestling not just one minute prayer not just two pray pray pray pray until the break of the day amen and when he saw that he prevailed not against him so somebody was really desperate he touched the hollow of his tie and the hollow of jacob's tie was out of joint as he wrestled with him in other words they put a mark on him amen we saw it on sunday verse 26 and he said let me go for the day breaks and he said i will not let you go except you do what you bless me he was already blessed still looking for blessings amen had vision in his life suffering all along but it was just one thing he lacked if he had started by meeting the angel first amen his life could have been more a big difference than where he was he started by looking for the blessing firstly then the angel came later you start first seek first the kingdom of god anybody clear first the kingdom of god then everything else will be added unto you amen he went for the blessing first and he left the man thing that's why he was suffering and he was working with his intelligence cheating cheating cheating and being pushed by the gene of the family anybody clear verse 27 they never bless him and he said to him what is your name that's your problem your name your character amen what is your name amen you want a blessing you're already blessed but what is your problem what is your name what is that nature anybody clear and he said jacob be not a word i'm a liar in other words i'm a deceiver i'm a supplanter amen remember when you deal with the lord especially in the form of the angel of the lord amen there is a discernment going on it's just like jesus and the woman at the well when they begin to discuss jesus look and say go get your husband amen he knows exactly what you need in your life to get you somewhere for jacob there is a problem with your birth that birth in the birth you were attached to the position of the devil and they give you your name based on your birth so we gotta change that breath then everything else will change in your life everybody clear verse 28 and he said your name shall be called normal not that you're gonna use it another time no more this is the end of him this is the end of the name of jacob this is the end of the life of the man called jacob no more jacob batwater israel for as a priest have you power with god amen you are now associated with god and with men and have what prevail ever clear blessed be the name of the lord let's go to hosea then we're going to pray so in genesis 3 the position of the devil the hill when we move forward the birth of jacob birthing a mess coming into the world with a wrong nature a man a deceiver supplanter subtility then he got a contact with the angel according to genesis chapter 32 all we know is jacob asked for the blessings right now let's see how hosea described the same sin hosea chapter 12. if you dare you can say amen hosea chapter 12 verse 3 hallelujah you're there anybody looking at their bible he took his brother by water by the hill in the womb he started from birth from those chin right there and by his strength he had power with god yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he did water did genesis tell you that so when jacob was with the angel he was not just struggling our mind we always have a fight going on between jacob and the angel now hosea is giving you more detail remember god give a revelation he doesn't change it but he had more information to help you receive it better amen now we found out that during this fight one person was weeping not the angel amen he wept and made what supplication to him so this is a different fight where somebody's bleeding he's weeping he's he's making supplication in other words he has been begging for redemption i'm in a mess i did everything i can i work all my life i have been cheated 10 times with my salary i suffer in my family i suffer with my brother-in-law i suffer with my father-in-law i suffer with my children i suffer with difficulty having children amen now i'm hating i'm i'm in a point where i must meet esau and i don't want to continue in this way i'm weeping i'm crying for redemption amen yeah he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication to him he found him in better and there he spoke with us everybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father for giving us another opportunity together to meet around the revealed word of the hour lord we ask forgiveness for everything that we grieve the holy spirit in our heart in our ways in our thinking lord anything that we did wrong that might be a hindrance to ourself and to our brothers and sister lord father may you forgive us and put all under the blood lord father may your blood cleanse and sanctify may the holy spirit have a free course tonight lord may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord father fill this place lord bring your blessings even to those that are streaming lord father may the devil in his army be completely sealed out lord but may you speak tonight lord move me completely out of the way in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are continuing with king hazary's three fists and esther to banquet a week prior to this we spoke about three elements that affected our our lives we spoke about smoking about clear we spoke about drinking and also we spoke about women amen on sunday we added again three elements that happened to us by birth amen by birth we have the zodiac sign in our life america we have our birthplace or the territory the place of your birth your nation everybody clear everybody clear amen blessed be the name of the lord and the third one we have our gene from our family amen the gene that comes from our father and our mother just like we saw a gift coming in the life of timothy from his grandmother mother all the way down amen so when we are born we are born in a mess just like jacob everybody clear praise be the name of the lord let me move on right here we started with birth and we found out by birth the place of the nation that we are born heavily influenced on us we found out that our family trees have an influence on us and our son of the zodiac have also an influence on us i was asked a question by a young man on sunday after preaching about the zodiac he was worrying about his zodiac and i told him i said you don't have to worry about the zodiac you don't have to go on the internet and try to figure it out what you can do and what you cannot do amen you don't have to measure into the devil territory amen all you need to do is worry about christ amen once you get your relationship with jesus christ automatically the bad side of your zodiac will be cleaned up amen you can learn about your weakness and many of us already learn about those weakness we know we get a high temper we know we get our attitude we know we get all kind of stuff that we have and despite the fact that we know about them yet we cannot overcome them amen brother branham said that boy was trying to overcome them intellectually but he could not amen jacob tried the same thing and jacob could not amen he first lied to his father amen and got the blessing he also went to lebanon and cheated lebanon and got rich by cheating amen but despite that his life never changed because jacob needed a breath everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord under the seal brother branham said jacob had the birthright is that right but he sure was a letter shasta with him see he went down and deceived his daddy he deceived his brother he done everything amen but yet legally right down he headed because esau had sought out in other words he so saw that the birthright legally it belonged to jacob he also need to get the blessing amen but the main key that we are preaching we are trying to point here amen is before you get married first you must be first married with christ amen because if you are not married with christ if you don't meet the angel of the lord yourself if you don't contact the pillar of fire yourself you're gonna fight your own life like jacob you're gonna be working with your own strength until god comes and makes you weak so that he god can become stronger because when we are weak then who is stronger amen blessed be the name of the lord but then when he goes down there to work for his father-in-law he put those proper stick in the water cheating he make those pregnant kettle and cuddle and things bring forth speckled calves iron oh you know everything he done like that just to gain water money now watch now he was asked from his people now it's a top of the jews now he is a money snatcher because it's in the dream of the jews amen abraham lied as a clyde jacob lied the patriarch lied even joseph lied amen that's why jesus told uh to the nicodemus you must be born again as long as you are not born again you will be controlled by the spirit of your nation by the the gene of your family and you're going to be controlled by the bad side of your zodiac because by birth you are born wrong anybody here shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking life i don't care how he gets him he sure gets it talking about the bathroom he is talking about the money he shall skin you alive to get him now you know that he is a little shasta that's all but don't deal with him he shall get you bull in other words don't deal with a jew a jew will snatch money out of you he can't help her because it's in the chin ever clear yes sir why he's got to be that that is the kind of spirit that is water he can't just help it he's just going by what he have everybody clear then on sunday we stop where jacob had a fight and met the angel everybody clear now before he goes back and met the angel of the lord the bible says and brother branham explained to us that jacob was leaving for a long time with lebanon and then suddenly he began to long to go back home to go back to the promised land brother branham said jacob longing in his heart everything seems to be wrong everything he try is not working his life has been in a mess sometimes you get a little experience like jacob you have a vision something happened and tomorrow you flip and you move on and you flip and you move on and you flip it seems like something is wrong somewhere everybody clear he wanted to go back home the holy spirit was leading him so that longing of the heart of jacob was not a personal longing but it was a time that god began to move in his life in order to bring him deliverance for something that he suffered all along blessed be the name of the lord he had made a promise to god he had to go to battle to pay this time and so forth you already got that one corrected and and here when i saw it i was like my god right family and here on his road back he found out that eso his enemy brother was just across the river waiting for him with an army so jacob was a coward yet he had the blessings of god god had promised to bless him he had the bear fright amen but branham continues here it was jacob who had deceived his brother and lived luxuriously down with his father-in-law with camels and sheep and everything one time they come a yearning to go back home go back to water go back to water to the right thing again he went away from home from a long time and that desire that dust that is hidden in your heart that begin to pull you back to god that is not you that is the holy spirit leaving you because the bible said no one can come unto me except the father jersey so you are not the one searching for god it is god actually searching for you hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you are christian and if god had not elected you to be a christian you will not be a christian amen it is god's choice whether you like it or not when it's time to go home god will push you to his program amen not yours no man seek god no man seek god at any time you have not sought god but god has sought you just like adam adam we are down amen the one who fell was adam adam was hiding but god was chasing adam amen he was not you calling for god hallelujah it was god calling for you and then when god called you he showed he he elected you you accepted the call he was what justification amen when you receive the call of god coming like a yearning in your heart it is a sign that you are elected hallelujah then you gave your heart to christ and was filled with the holy spirit and now you are positionally placed in the body of christ ever clear so that yearning of jacob was just to bring him to a place of deliverance jacob had a possession that he must go back home but he knowed he had to face his enemy he didn't know how he was going to do it what what did he do first he stayed there until he got a hold of who god and when he was convinced that he had the blessing because god said so then he was concerned first he must stay until he knows something happened he had a what a mark in his physical being that showed that god had placed it upon him so number one before you get married you must make sure you have a mark of christ in your life everybody clear this mark is important because it will be a memorial for you all the way through your life journey amen jacob met the angel alone amen nobody was there but what the angel did to jacob could be seen publicly amen even if you are not with jacob there but if you look at the way jacob is walking it is actually reflecting his experience with the angel the experience was first alone it was first private amen but the manifestation of that experience is gonna be public amen everybody could look at jacob and say something is different with that boy we know he was a shasta we know he was a cheater we know he was doing this we know he was under drug we know he was alcoholic we know he was under fornication we know he was in a nightclub we know he used to dress wrong but for some reason now we can see a change amen there is a mark that must be there amen so every time jacob lamps he remind him of his experience amen and before he died amen he called joseph he said joseph take your hand and put way where the angel of the lord touch me and swear unto me that you're not gonna leave me here but god bury me well in palestine amen even a death that experience still mark the life of jacob amen you need an experience that's going to mark you you need an experience that you're going to mark you from here all the way until you meet the lord amen the great big strong he was jacob on this side of the river a great big strong healthy water coward amen and on this side of the river he was a limping prince on this side of the river he was strong man a jacob a deceiver and on the other side of the river he was a lamping water how can beat how can you be a warrior olympian amen we expect a warrior to be walking like this but they told you that jacob the warrior is coming you say open the door and you see somebody like this that looks like a veteran amen because a veteran is the one that received maybe a bullet or something he fought the war amen this is a warrior veteran amen he's not fighting the war anymore somebody already overcome him it is not his fight anymore it is the fight of his master if you touch jacob you touch god why do you want to fight you fought you fought you fought you can't get nowhere amen not afraid of nothing he didn't want anything esau could give him they gave him money he said no i'm good amen he was convinced that he had been touched by god every walk made it different when a man is so definitely see the difference of the mark of what the holy ghost in his life amen when he begin to approach his soul he was no longer approaching his soul to fight him on a human ability he was approaching a different fight a fight of a lamping warrior a fight of humility amen and when he saw look at him the first time he bowed the second time he bow instead of looking at the fight the first question will be what happened to you amen while you lamping then you begin to preach the gospel one day amen i was cheating my father-in-law then i met christ and my life changed everybody clear so far now let's go back to ezekiel chapter 16 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let me see my enemy time it's going to be swallowed up in eternity one of this day amen ezekiel chapter 16 if you dare you can say amen amen you must reach that place where you are whipping where you are begging for god when you are tired of your life amen amen until somebody break you like they're breaking a horse amen that wild horse that have been going on the bush in the forest all this time when they get it to the master they break him when they break him right there let's go to gastonia the horse just follow that's it he becomes useful for the master ezekiel chapter 16. we already talked about the birth let's drop to verse 8. if you're there you can say amen this is the second time in puberty now when i pass by you and look upon you behold your time was the time of love amen and i spread my skirt over you amen we saw on sunday that when ruth went to boaz amen roof asked for the same thing everybody clear to spread a skirt over here why because you are the nearest kingsman just like jacob was begging for redemption amen ruth also was begging for what for redemption amen i am in israel i have accepted the god of israel amen but still i am free i'm in the air i want to be positioned amen blessed be the name of the lord when we talk about ruth on sunday amen we found out let's go to ruth chapter 3 keep ezekiel 16 so we can catch this pretty good looks like we're navigating good roof comes i believe after the judges if you dare you can say amen everybody there roof three verse three watch yourself therefore this is now me and anoint you and put your remnant upon you and get you down to the floor but make note yourself known to the man until he shall have done eating and drinking amen just like they give food to isaac before he blesses and it shall be when he lies down that you shall mark the place where he lie down amen roof was instructed by naomi not to approach boaz until boaz sleep amen when you are approaching bars boys must be sleeping amen what a sleep mean amen the sleeping with a woman in the bible has a key amen before eve was created they have to put adam to sleep anybody clear before the bride comes out jesus have to be put to sleep at the cross everybody clear because when they told jesus that lazarus is dead jesus said uh-uh he's sleeping they say he's sleeping you're going to wake him up he said uh-uh in your language he's dead amen you must wait until boaz sleep that is when you go are you ready let's go to verse four in shabby when he lies down when he's sleeping like adam when he's

woman began to go on to compass amen normally it's a man looking after but this time god turn it around you are the one going after it amen blessed be the name of the lord it's virgin let's go to the song of solomon and let's see what's wrong with those virgins amen blessed be the name of the lord song of solomon chapter one if you dare you can say amen some people are flipping their pages song of solomon chapter one if you go to the book of proverbs after proverb is ecclesiastes after ecclesiastic song of solomon you need to be navigating your bible now read one chapter in the morning one chapter and nine note the same chapter over and over and over and over and over taking your bible opening taking your bible open you keep falling on the same chapter amen take a decision you say this month i'm going to go with john and begin to join read john 1 john 2 john 3 john 4. don't you finish you say next month i go with isaiah isaiah 1 isaiah 2. isaiah 3 you finish you go next month and you keep marking before probably if the lord terry you're going to find yourself reading the entire bible if you just do this do this do this praying with some some some son of solomon chapter one if you're there you can say amen the song of solomon the song of songs which is solomon's verse two let him do what kiss me with the kisses of his mouth we saw brother brother showed to us that it is not good for a woman to kiss a man if they are not married and brother problem explained to us that the sex gland lies on the leap the only time you're going to be permitted to kiss a man or to kiss a woman will be at the altar when they marry you after that if it's your wife no problem with it everybody now this woman here is asking for the kiss not off the lips but the kiss of the mouth the kisses of his mouth this is the tournament in solomon christ and the brother there is something new the woman is what pulling for the man anybody clear anybody clear it is the woman that is going after amen praise the name of the lord let him let him kiss me with the kisses of what his mouth what is in the mouth of god you see furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it says that we are in the mouth of god we are in grave on his palm we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in his sheepfold and in his pasture but never in water but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth amen matthew 4 4 but he also and say it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by what that proceeded out of the water so the mouth of god when this tournament is asking for the kisses of the mouth she wanna connect with a husband through the world the word is supposed to be in our mouths too because you're kissing him are you there now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church what the word first peter 11 if a man speak let him speak as the oracle of what god which is what the word of god that's why the bible said that we are born by the incorruptible word of god the tsunami is saying bring my husband let my husband enter into a covenant with a kiss with me i want to get a contact into the world hallelujah let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love the love of who christ is better than what do you remember we showed you wine the one of fornication in the book of revelation the wine that took noah's uh clothes off the one that take your understanding your heart away the one that makes a lot drunk and committed an unclean relationship with his daughter amen now the love of god the love through the word amen that capstone word when you contact with it it is better it is far greater than one hallelujah let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love is better than wine the wine of babylon that daniel refused to get everybody clear because remember the wine of babylon when they took the wine the king forgot the law and if the book of proverbs the mother of lemieux told him he said let me uh let me don't taste wine because wine will make you forget the law amen it's going to destroy king amen but the love of god is better than wine it's better than bee it's better than whiskey amen you are turned on amen you are in puberty you begin to have strange feelings amen you need to contact christ you need that skirt from him that comes by the kisses of his mouth bringing his love through his word god so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son hallelujah verse 3 because of the water the silver is the smell the fragrance amen because of the severe of your good water ointment is perfume so this man this christ has a perfume hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh my god now what does that smell do a smell women put perfume on themselves for what a present and men put aftershave stuff on sometime like that that order full order file order will be taken away from you when you walk into the presence of someone with body orders or something another perfume is to take that order away so that you in the presence of that person that you might not be found it's unbearable that is what perfume soap has order in it and you wash with soap or taco powders and whatever that is what they use it for amen praise the name of the lord now notice a man i just feel good he was the rose of sharon he was offered to god as a sweet smelling water remember the song of solomon is talking about the server of the master everybody and then when he become when we become unbearable before god and so excuse the expression so what sticky and our sin and things are so bad and so foul then we come to what cavalry where route to enter because you need the roles of sharon to perfume you a lily or any flower before perfume can be made you take a flower it's beautiful a big morning lily or a rose the rose of sharon is a beautiful flower while it's living it's beautiful but to get other out of that to get a perfume it has to be water and then they crush it and squeeze the perfume water that's why christ have to be quest so that the life of christ the holy spirit can leave jesus christ and come upon your life everybody here blessed be the name of the lord let's go to the song of solomon he said because you're severe the sever of your good perfumes your name is water it's a perfume that is what powerful the name of her husband itself is a perfume oh my god blessed be the name of the lord that is the great person the lord jesus he was who jehovah god invading flesh the bible said whatever you do in what word or deed do it all in water the bible said the whole family in heaven and earth is in heaven his name water and the whole family on earth is named what jesus let's pray in water live in water teaching water dying water bearing water baptizing water resurrected in water go to heaven in water that is his name and his proud his name this is what jesus said hallelujah it shall take a people out of a gentile for his name sake there is a fan people in the world found churches but there is only one this is what because somebody took on the name and that name is a perfumer amen and that is who he is coming for that is where his name lays there is where his worship is in here and here alone that is what truth ever creates so far blessed be the name of the lord paul in romans 13 14 he said but put you on water put the perfume of your husband are you there put you on water the lord jesus christ and make provision for what make not provision for what when you putting on the name of quest when you bury the perfume of the husband amen it's gonna block the black dog it takes the black dog under control amen and not provision for the flesh to fulfill the what the last thereof why because christ now joshua is now taking care of that amalekite ever clear ephesians 4 verse 21. let me look at my enemy he's not there yet if so be that you have water heard of him crust and helping water taught by him all that are taught her children of god as the truth is in who that you pulled off concerning the former conversation the old man the old jacob disappointed take him off which is what corrupt according to the deceitful of lot that was the life of jacob amen take their life away and be with you in the spirit of your don't stop there that you put on the water you are wearing a cologne you are wearing a new name you are taking on a new name amen and put on the new name the new man which after god is created in righteousness and through what holiness colossians 310 and help put on the water the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created what let's go back to our song of solomon verse three because of the severe of your of uh of your good ornaments your name the name of jesus you must put on the name by marriage kisses of the mouth amen anointment pull forth therefore do the water remember in jeremiah they talk about oh ye what the virgin love him the women that have not have sex yet love him the men that have not committed fornication and puberty they love him amen they love him amen blessed be the name of the lord why do the virgin love him why take first corinthians chapter seven keep the song of solomon keep your finger there or uh your pen there go to first corinthians chapter seven let me see my god we're still good amen are you full you're full you still get stressed okay anyway if you don't your cup should be overflowing not being fear overflowing so you must leave the stretch overflowing it just dropped so i just release it amen the bible says that his name is a good name his perfume is good it's the rosa sheridan we want him to meet with him unite with him in the word be born amen and the virgin love him why do the virgin love him first corinthians chapter seven i believe most of you read this chapter over and over as we gave you readings let's jump to verse 25 you there now concerning what everybody clear concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that has obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful there is a key there amen because paul was a steward and his two words have to be faithful if you want to know that it's in first corinthians 4 verse 1 and 2. you will see that amen verse 26 i suppose therefore that is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be in other words paul is saying that i want young people to remain single that is what paul is saying he say i want young virgin to remain virgin why paul why you ready don't worry you want to get married okay amen verse 27 verse 27 are you born to a wife sick not to be loosed are you loosed from a wife sick not a wife but if you marry you have not sinned if you decided i'm burning i gotta get married no problem there's no sin with it amen and if a virgin mary she has not seen nevertheless such a have trouble in the what but i do what in other words you're gonna break into a different channel by beginning to have relaxed sexual relationship in the marriage and it's a troubling area remember we already dealt with it now if you stay away with it paul is saying that you'll be better but the devil is the one telling you you're missing but if you marry you didn't do anything wrong we're balancing it okay let's go to jump to verse 33 32 you there but i would have you without carefulness that's my concern he that is a married you see that why do the virgin love him he that is a married care for the things that belong to what do you see that so young people if you are not married your first focus will be what christ are you there because that is your husband until you he provides you a space for the effort amen if you don't get married you still have a companion for life the best one that will never disappoint you they will never leave you they will never forsake you they will be there with you all the way to the end he's better than your husband he's better than your wife he's better than your mother mama can forget you peppa can forget you but me the lord i will never forget you that's why the virgin those that are not married the single love him the single love him the single are connected with him the single are in relationship with him amen so when you get in marriage he is always the preeminence even if you're my husband you're not going to tell me to steal because i have the lord i have a quote for it amen but that would help you with that carefulness paul is saying i'm trying to help you stay in your relationship with god without destruction amen that's what paul is saying he that is a married cares for the things that belongs to the lord how he may please who because that's that's your husband that's your marriage you're trying to please god amen verse uh 34 there is a difference also between a water a wife and a water and a virgin i'm reading the scripture why do the virgin love him solomon why do the virgin love him there is a difference between our wife and her virgin a wife is married she's under covenant amen a virgin is not married naturally but he is more lean into christ you understand now job to verse uh with them there is a difference also between the wife and the virgin the unmarried woman care for the things of who that she may be what buff in the water where the black dog is are you there both in the body and in the water she's more concerned about her devotion her life hallelujah but he but she that is married care for the things of what how to please who now you got a husband to please amen you got to please christ you also got to take care of your husband now it's like you see now that's why the virgin love him when they are not under covenant they love him they cling to him when they're married now they have him but they also have a spouse they got a please now they got to make sure they cook the way he wanted they go buy this in the store they go to walmart they begin to get taken care of the care of the world because they got to please somebody he wants his tech to be medium he wants his stick to be well done blessed be the name of the lord are you there he said she that is marriage and married cares for the things of the world how the man please her what her husband ever clear blessed be the name of the lord now let's go back to song of solomon you understand now why the virgin love him because the virgin are free and god is coming at that time to claim the virgin you are supposed to love me i'm the one that gave you life i'm coming the second time because by default the virgin love me it's your time of love according to ezekiel 16 that's why i'm coming as your husband in the time of love because the virgin love me oh my god oh my god i hope those that mis cling to this because you're gonna be left behind you back in song of solomon don't worry i'm watching my time we we we have just navigated too deep now it feels like you're in eternity amen let's go to verse four join me what jeremy we will run after you we know jesus said nobody can come to me except who the father joseph who is asking for redemption who is asking for that it is the woman god is doing a new thing the woman going after the other husband kiss me with the kisses of your mouth i need your perfume i need your name join me because i cannot come without you join me when you join me i shall do what we will run after you will become your disciple because you join us amen we will run after you the king has brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in you we will do what hallelujah lord help me we will remember like jacob we will remember what your love you will remember the love so there is something done in this relationship of love that the virgin will always remember that love you followed me i'm going to get into a territory of the black dog sooner amen we shall have more time we will remember your love more than what wine the upright love you in other words kiss me with the kisses of my mouth give me your perfume we like your name we want you to join us we are joined with you and the experience we receive with you have put a mark in our life that we will never forget everywhere we're walking jacob is still lamping there is an experience in check of life now he will always remember and that experience is going to be better than anything you can offer jacob hallelujah why because colossians 3 14 say love is the bonds of what perfection you are hooked into perfection until the day of redemption take ezekiel 23. i'm gonna probably close here i thought i'm gonna finish this my god take ezekiel 23 the love of a virgin with god the love of they are married young men they are married young woman with god that love will put a mark it will give you an experience it will do something in your life that you will never forget when you're gonna go through trial in life you will always remember that first love that first love that he says that remember you left your first love you will always remember that thing amen if struggle comes if the devil comes say you're not a son of god you're not a child of god look how you get upset look what you did you look what you did something will rise on you and say i remember one thing devil i was a drunkard before but one day i was delivered i remember that day when christ came in my life it's gonna be a mark that mark is the anchor of your entire life do you follow me brother branham went

us from the what the love of god that is in who christ jesus nothing nothing shall tribulation shall period shall sword shall this shall be no matter they were there there will be something that will be anchoring that is what you need before you get married that is what you need before you start having a sexual relationship in your marriage you need that if not you're gonna fight like jacob you're

hallelujah and they commit wardom verse 3 in egypt in the world they committed warden in the youth not adult you see that in their youth there were their breast pressed and there they bruised the teeth of their virginity they lost their virginity when they were younger because of the place they grew up because of the environment they grew up because they didn't know any better and some young men took advantage of them and slept with them and they lost their virginity when they were youth everybody clear hallelujah verse four and the name of them were a holla the elder and a holy boy her sister and they were who they were supposed to be gods they were virgins before the virgin belongs to him that's why he comes he spread the skirt to claim you i am your maker you belong to me you need a relationship first with me amen they were gods but instead of going god's way they took a wrong way and they committed fornication in their youth they lost their virginity amen and their both sons
