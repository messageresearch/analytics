Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have a testimony. So, please forgive me if I'm out of order, but uh I wasn't going to say anything, but I said, "Lord, if he called me up to pray, then I'm going to have to give the testimony." &gt;&gt; Um This word is I can't explain it, but you all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It's one thing for somebody to preach by inspiration, but it's one thing for the person to be present &gt;&gt; when the preaching is being done. &gt;&gt; When the Lord had brother Steven preaching on the ant, the very first sermon, I got in my truck and it was an ant over top of my head. My wife said, "Honey, it's an ant right there. said, "Okay." Got to the house. I Well, I tried to I got a napkin. I tried to pick it up. I ain't want to kill the ant. Not after that preach. So, I put the ant I tried to put it out the window, got to the house, and when I was backing into the driveway, she said, "And she said, "Sweetheart, the ant is on your shoulder." I said, "Okay, Lord." So, I took that personal, you know, because God reveals his word. That's the demonstration of the gospel. &gt;&gt; So, I followed instruction. I was diligent, diligent, diligent. Well, I didn't give all of the testimony because I don't like I really don't like coming up here. But my boss that came here that day, the gentleman that hired me, he moved on. So, he was the corporate safety director. They gave me his position. two two three days ago, maybe something like that. But they trying to they tried to work me into it. Now, my wife and my family, we had an appointment. I'm saying this all for one purpose. We went to the appointment, and that's another testimony. It's coming, so I'm just letting y'all know now. And we went to the appointment. We were driving home. We were all talking about it. And while everybody was talking, an inspiration struck me. I said, "I'm gonna have a raise this week." &gt;&gt; And one day came, spoke to the boss, said what I had to say. He said, "Okay." "Well, can you give me 45 days?" I said, "Well, nah, I can't give you 45 days." I said, "I don't I I understand how things work." I said, "I I can't accept that." He said, ' Okay, well, just give me 30. All right. Got off the phone, came upstairs. I told my family. I said, "Hey, I just got my raise." I said, "Uh, I said, uh, Lord didn't technically give it to me yet." I said, "But it's coming." &gt;&gt; I said, "And it's still this week." &gt;&gt; Well, got on the phone today, uh, with the boss and he said, "Well, Charles, you got an extra two minutes?" He said, "Remember the conversation we had?" Said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, so and so starting Monday, you'll have your raise." He said, "Now, now this is God." He said, "We don't give raises until March or April." He said, "Yes, it's a corporate. You know how they work in corporate. It's got to be by the letter." He said, "So, but you know, so don't, you know, we we got to wait a little while." He said, "But you know, I didn't have to do much twisting of the arm." He said the moment I you know I took it up the ladder he said it was it was easy. He said he said everybody here you know they speak highly of you. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; saints I can't express it. I wish I can jump into everybody &gt;&gt; so I can give this inspiration to you. But just do what the word is saying. Don't worry about a feeling. Don't worry about don't wait for it. If it comes just speak it. Get it out of your mouth &gt;&gt; and put God in a corner to make him perform that word &gt;&gt; and he'll do it &gt;&gt; and he'll do it because he did. So &gt;&gt; I thank all God's servants for submitting themselves because everybody here submit themselves when the Lord is ministering that word. So we're going into the new year with victory saints. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord God for everything that you're doing in our lives. Lord God, we thank you Lord God because you have given us a word Father that's infallible Lord God. that you have given us a word that can't fail, heavenly father. Lord, and you have determined the times and the seasons, heavenly father. And Lord, when we get weak in our faith, Father, you somehow, Father, Lord, you give us strength, Father, through the ministering of your word, Father. Lord, and as you give us strength, Heavenly Father, you are still working in the background to perform those things that you promised, heavenly father, even against our shortcomings, Father. And we thank you for it, Lord God. Lord, we know we're not worthy, Lord God, because you have made us worthy, Lord. We accept these things, Lord God, and we rejoice in these things, Father, because you promise, Lord God, to take care of us, Lord God. And every need that we have, Father, you promise to supply it, Lord God. And as we present ourselves to you, Father, Lord, we first ask for forgiveness, Lord, for our sins, Father. Lord, seeing, Lord, that today's a special day for us, Father. Lord, we can look back on the journey, Lord, that we had throughout the year, Father. We can look back and see all the things you have done in our lives throughout this year, Father. how we progressed it by the moving of your spirit, Father, following the pillar of fire, Lord Jesus Christ, as you have demonstrated your word to us, Lord God. We have taken note thereof, Father. Lord, and we applied it to our lives, Father, and we're walking in victory because you said so, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray, Lord God, that you bless the precious brother, Lord God, and remember his name, Lord God. But we rejoice and praise him and praise your name with him, heavenly father. Continue to do more in his life, heavenly father. Demonstrate more of your power, Lord, in his life, Father. Bless each and every request of your children, Father. Lord, and we pray, Father, that you come down in a powerful way, heavenly father, because your mercy endureth forever, Lord Jesus. Father, we thank you, Lord God. We commit the remainder of the service into your hands, Father. Have your way, Lord God. Take prereeminence of all things, Lord God, and help us to hear from you, Lord God. Help us all submit to you, Lord Jesus, and strengthen our hand of faith, Lord God. We pray for the tithes and offerings, Father, that you use them for the furtherance of your kingdom, Lord Jesus. We pray these things in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And amen. We invite Sister Lily. After that, the choir should be getting ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance that everything's going to be all right. And Lord, I see another battle. It's out in front of me.

You heard it already, right? So, let me give you the quote while we doing that in the message from the end from that time in 1959 in December the 31st. &gt;&gt; I didn't create the message. This was spoken in December the 31st. Which date are we today? &gt;&gt; December 31st. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you what brother Brandham say on December the 31st. Brother Brandham saying paragraph 22. Now, brother Neville and some of them will be speaking in a few moment. But I want to read just a little something out of the scripture now. And it's good I think on New Year's Eve on New Year's night to see different preachers. &gt;&gt; I'm reading brother Brandham. I'm going to start it again on on paragraph 23. Brother Brandham say it is good I think on New Year's night to see different preachers and the way they approach a text and what they say and so forth and each man having his own way of preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, God &gt;&gt; didn't make us all alike. &gt;&gt; He made us different. &gt;&gt; He made us different in our stature. &gt;&gt; He made the world different. And the big mountains, the little mountains, the prairies, prairies, desert, big white flowers, blue flowers and all different kind. He just make us different. That's all he made. Red head, &gt;&gt; black head, &gt;&gt; brown head, &gt;&gt; white head, &gt;&gt; fat, &gt;&gt; slam, &gt;&gt; tall. &gt;&gt; Oh, whatever more. See, he's just make us different. God is a God of variety. And I kind of like that. Don't you? Congregation says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; But just the same thing all the time. My mama, I like this one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's good to have a flavor of preacher. This is where I got it from. Amen. So, our next preacher is Brother Glenn Kelly. Come on, brother Glenn. Praise God. Seven minute. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Okay then. I tell you, I couldn't get out of this. I told him, I said, "No, all these fine preachers." I said, "Uh, why don't you just let me sit back and stay in my amen corner in my deacon office?" Okay. He said, "No." So, I couldn't override him as a father. He uses his influence as a pastor. Right. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us just turn to uh Ruth. You can stand. Won't be long. That's a good thing. I don't have to be long by the grace of God. Huh? But it's always an honor to come here before God's children. &gt;&gt; Okay. Our hearts and mind are clear. Let us pray. Lord God, we thank you for your grace, your mercy. We thank you, Father, for this opportunity just to come before your precious children, Lord God. So we lift your name up on high. Father, we give you praise. We give you honor. We give you glory. Father, we come to lift you up. You are the great master. You are the great king. Uh so father, we can't lift you higher than enough, Lord God. But we thank you for the testimonies that you allow us to have. So we look there on tonight. Bless your children, visible, invisible audience also, Father. Remember the sick, remember the shut in, Father. So we thank you and by faith we claim it all done in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. Let's look at Ruth uh one. You know, I've I tell you just a little thought was kept ringing in my spirit for the last two uh few weeks is uh decision. You know how but with this highstake decision these are high stake decisions. When you make a high stake decision then that mean a lot is involved. &gt;&gt; Okay? You can either lose some or you can gain some. It can be reversible or irreversible. Okay? But we're talking about making a decision. Let's look at Ruth 1 and look at verse 16. He says, "And Ruth said,"Entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee. From whether thou goest, I will go, and whether thou lodge, I will lodge." He said, "Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wherefore thine will I die." He said, "There will I be buried, and the Lord do to me, and more also if we ought but deadart thee and me." He said, "When she saw that she was steadfast minded to go with her, &gt;&gt; it says then she what left speaking to her." So, we're looking here. I'm not going. This is a uh I tell you, you need to go look into Revelations 3 and go into there in verse part uh Revelations 4 and part three. And it goes deep into this. It brings you up until the end time. It brings you up until what God is bringing in our day because you know you're a privileged people to hear this. This is the only time this information is being revealed. It was not been revealed in no other age. This is the only age that was in the back mind of God is bringing forward now. Is that right? Because it can only be brought to his bride. Is that right? Only the bride of Jesus Christ. Because remember now she was deciding. Is that right? First she come in that was justification. Is that right? And then she came she was what? Serving. Is that right? Then after she serving that what? And that was sanctification. Is that right? That was brother Brandon said she was sitting and she was just sitting there. But when she was gleaning in the field in the sanctification stage, what she was doing was uh just trying to gain favor. Is that right? Some of you still struggling in sanctification stage. Right? But you're not going to gain favor in this age. Is that right? Because the thunders have been open. The seals have released the thunders. Right? So we know the thunders that is no longer is just justification as a denominational saying it. Sanctification as a denominational will say it. Justification we know to the bride mean what? You've never done it. Is that right? Now we're sanctified by the washing of the water of the pure word. Is that right? After she was sanctified then she was doing what? She was resting. Is that right? Then she became resting. Now she had what? The Holy Ghost. Is that right? She was resting in the Holy Ghost just for Boaz to go and fulfill the plan of redemption. Is that right? She was just resting. We're just resting now sitting. Is that right? Reaping all the benefits and all the promises of God. Is that right? Because we know when you make a decision. Is that right? You got to move forward and you can't look back. But the beautiful thing about us is we can't get out of this cuz you didn't make the decision. God made the decision. God chose you before the foundation of the world. God got a purpose for you. We going to fulfill it. Is that right? Look out, Satan. Uh God has brought his bride in the end time. Hallelujah. God bless you. Come on, pastor. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. I believe this is shorter than 7 minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to pray for the all the oncoming preachers. So, you don't take time to pray. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray that you bless every scripture that will be read here tonight. Father, anoint each one of them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when you come, just know you already been prayed over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to cut it short. And now that we stopped in justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, is that right? It only occur before your bride. So, you got to understand what God has called. You know, we all get to a point where you have to make a decision. Is that right? Abraham was getting old. Is that right? Abraham had to make a decision and he had to make a decision soon. Is that right? He was a type of God. Uh, and when he coming in him being a type of God, uh, he had to find a true servant. Is that right? &gt;&gt; A true servant. Where they at? A true servant. Where's the servants at? Huh? Where's the servants at? God had to find a true servant that he can trust that was loyal to the word of God. Is that right? He saw what you were going to fulfill before the foundation of the world. Is that right? I want to read one thing. thing. I don't want him to say, "I didn't read a quote." Let me read this one quote. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; It's loaded, saints. You need to go there. You need to go there and look and look at this. Okay? &gt;&gt; And you look at it. We're talking about a decision. &gt;&gt; You're talking about decision. &gt;&gt; God made a mighty decision through you. Is that right? &gt;&gt; A high stake decision. It's a critical choice. &gt;&gt; It says with significance. It says often irresistible. The consequences for individuals. It could be organization situations involving things right risk reward or impact or of your future or your finance. Your decisions could be wrong decisions right decisions. God don't tell his prophets everything. Is that right? But remember Isa remember Isaac was deceived. Is that right? Isaac was deceived by who? Rebecca and who? And Esau. I mean Jacob. Is that right? But that was a purpose. It was there for a purpose. God allowed them to be deceived because God had already what? Made a decision that was going to be twins in her womb. Is that right? And they were going to war against one another. But the older was going to you rule the younger. Is that right? But it was a prophecy that had to be fulfilled. Uh so when he came in there, Abraham, Isaac had to make a decision. But Jacob, he knew the importance of the birthright. Is that right? He knew that important. But before we but the time before before now remember Isaac was getting older. &gt;&gt; And at the time I think I got the story but let me back up. Abraham this where I'm at. Abraham. Is that right? Abraham. Isaac was getting older with Abraham. Is that Isaac was getting what? 40 years old about that. Is that right? So he needed a bride and he had to find a bride for him. So he had to send Elees after him. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But why did he send him the bride? Why did he have to have the right bride? Uh let me read this quote. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, he says, "And the time had come for Abraham, the great patriarch &gt;&gt; and servant of God to make a decision. And this decision was that he was to decide just on who his son Isaac that he had waited 25 years for and had received him as one from the dead. He says and know that he was called and separate messenger of God. Look what the purpose. Brother Random said you know the cause but you got to know the the cause. the purpose, the cause to have a cure. Is that right? You got to know the cause. Why was it so important? Why is it so important that the Bible says, "Do not be unevenly yolked." Why is it so important? Your pastor is teaching you about courtship and leading you that way. Look what he says here. Help me, Lord. He says now and had received him as one from the dead and know that he was called and separated messenger of God. And there was a time come when he had to make a decision &gt;&gt; who would be his help meat to carry on the plan of God. &gt;&gt; You are the ones that God chose to call to carry on the plan of God. God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody happy. &gt;&gt; Everybody happy. &gt;&gt; If you happy and you know it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The Bible says in the book of Ruth, he say, "Entreat me not not entreat me not to leave thee or return from following thee." That's what the brother read. Amen. And then down he says that when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. You got to be persistent in your faith. &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People need to see your eyes. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; And see that this one there is no way to turn around. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime the discouragement may come from your family member. &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was Naomi trying to discourage ROF. &gt;&gt; Discouragement from a mother-in-law. But Ruth had a revelation. She said Naomi stopped from continuing in this path because I ain't going back. &gt;&gt; And when Naomi saw that she was steadfast &gt;&gt; on her decision, then that was it. You got to be sure on your decision. &gt;&gt; You got to be so sure until when somebody want to talk to you about this message &gt;&gt; to leave this message. When they look at your eyes, &gt;&gt; they say this one is sold out. There is no way to turn him back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So stay steadfast on your faith. Whatever the Lord revealed to you, stay right there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stay persistent and the devil will leave you alone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The second one. 7 minute. Brother Polycarp. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. Let's go to the book of uh chapter 1 verse 9. And it's time the book of Naom the prophet. Thank you. Chapi uh chapter 1 verse 9. Amen. What do you imagine against the Lord? &gt;&gt; He will make another end. Affliction shall not rise up the second time. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Matthew. Matthew chapter 11. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 11 verse two. Now when John had heard in the prison he the works of of Christ, &gt;&gt; the works of Christ, &gt;&gt; he sent two of his disciples and say unto him are da or do we look for another? Jesus answer and say unto them, "Go and show John again those things which he do hear and see." The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed. And the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them. Okay, I'm going to go again to the book of Luke. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 7 and verse 11. The Bible says this, "And it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called N and many of his disciple went with him and much people. Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out. The only son of his mother, she was a widow, and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion. And say unto him, weep not. And he came and touched the B. And they that bear him. And he say, Young man, I say unto thee, arise. And he that was dead sat up and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. My little subject tonight, be not afraid. You are not going to end up your life in distress. No matter I know that we are in the month of December and we are at the eve of 2026. Maybe you had project. Maybe you have a lot of ambitions and nothing was actually accomplished. But let me tell you, you are not late. God may do something. No matter your situation, we read what the Lord spoke in the Bible that affliction shall not rise up the second time. So we saw servants of God that were also in distress. That was John the Baptist just like you and me. Sometime we might fail on our faith. You might even lose your trust in God. This is what happened to John the Baptist. He was almost like a bachelor. And what happened to him? He was in prison and he was afraid and he forgot himself. Then he was the one that introduced the Messiah. He said, "Behold the lamb of God that can take away the sin of the world. In him was everything." But John the Baptist because of the because of the circumstances just like you. &gt;&gt; Maybe nothing is working in your life. Maybe your business are not working. Maybe your marriage is not working and you are discouraged. Maybe you in distress. Let me tell you something. The Lord is with you. &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist sent the disciple. Go ask is it him &gt;&gt; or should we wait for someone else? &gt;&gt; And here is the answer of Jesus Christ the master. He says &gt;&gt; look this the blind are the the and the devil and the gospel is preached. Go and report this to John. report to John what and what you see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like your faith, &gt;&gt; you lost faith because of circumstances because it's already at the end of December 2025 everything you were expecting nothing work but he can walk tonight. Just tonight if you can have confidence in him, God is able. We read here in the book of Luke, &gt;&gt; this is a story you all know. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a widow. &gt;&gt; And she only have one child. Amen. Amen. Only one child. Her husband was dead &gt;&gt; and they were bringing her son to go bury him. And the people came to comfort her. And Jesus also met them. She was coming out of the city to bear her son. They're trying to get out of the city. 202 leaving 2025. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was coming from 2026. And Jesus met and they met at the again. It again your situation will be stopped. &gt;&gt; What happened my brother? &gt;&gt; When Jesus saw it, Jesus had compassion and Jesus touched the widow. Say stop crying. And the widow could say, "Why are you stopping me from crying?" "H Pastor Jesus, &gt;&gt; I only have one child. My husband was already there. &gt;&gt; And today you telling me not crying and she look at other widow. You probably you're not a widow. You have husband and you man, you have &gt;&gt; but I don't have a husband. I only have one child and that son is gone. There are mothers that have four children, maybe five children. You have three children. You have two children, but I don't have so many. And Jesus understood that comforting somebody by word is not enough. I must act. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I must do something. &gt;&gt; And I want Jesus to have compassion on you tonight. Not only to have compassion, but I want Jesus to do something in your situation. Tonight, tonight, &gt;&gt; what happened there? He he he he came near. &gt;&gt; I want Jesus to approach your situation &gt;&gt; and he touched the coffin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was in the coffin or the buyer that they put the child the child of the widow. me and you tonight. I don't know what belongs to you that is already in the maybe your health is in a cup. Maybe your work is in the maybe your business is in a not working. You are moving in desperation. You are living 2025. But tonight, don't let it go. Don't let go. And your marriage is not working. And your marriage is in the coffin. Everything in the coffin. Your womb be in a coffin. And every time you have a child and a pregnancy, you keep having miscarriage. Meaning everything go into the coffin. But tonight, God is going to touch your coffin. He's going to touch your coffin. He's going to touch your coffin. Would the people that were holding the fire they stop? &gt;&gt; Whoever is carrying your problem, the the the coffin of your health, of your finances, of your marriage, of your engagement, of your study, of your work. They need to stop tonight because Jesus has come. ever stop in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he said, &gt;&gt; "Young man, &gt;&gt; I order you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stopped the young man. Somebody who was in the work that was in the must stand up. They must come out from the cross your health. I don't know your sickness. I don't care but I want it come out in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; You must be in good health. &gt;&gt; What happen again? And the one who was dead sat up and begin to speak &gt;&gt; and Jesus brought him back to his mother. &gt;&gt; So the man that was dead sat up. When they say he startability, &gt;&gt; it means there is a stability. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; What was dead came from the coffinility &gt;&gt; with stability and Jesus made him stable. I need your health to be stable, your marriage to be stable, your finances stable. Your business is stable. Your life stable. Everything that is bothering you in 2025, the life of your children stable, all your relationship stable. Everything that was unstable. May they go back to the in Jesus name.

Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's &gt;&gt; always not easy to switch from one anointing to the other shouting amen and coming back to preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But just bless the name of the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, first Peter chapter 1 verse 22. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He said, "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth." That's right. &gt;&gt; Through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. &gt;&gt; So the word is coming to purify our souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. See that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. &gt;&gt; Amen. being born again, &gt;&gt; not of corruptible seed, &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible, &gt;&gt; by the word of God, &gt;&gt; which liveth and abideth forever. &gt;&gt; For all flesh is as grass, &gt;&gt; and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass witherth, and the flower thereof fallth away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even as we sit, we want to take um Zechariah chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Amen. Zechariah chapter 10. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now my message tonight is a goodly people. &gt;&gt; Amen. a goodly people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we read in um the book of first Peter that the Lord brought his word to purify our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, making us pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the word is doing something for us. &gt;&gt; Now, when the word is doing something, there's a reason why the word is doing that. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Now, um, uh, Zechariah 10:1, it said, "Ask ye of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Reign. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the time of the latter rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the Lord purifies your heart. &gt;&gt; And then now comes back to you and says, "Ask &gt;&gt; rain &gt;&gt; in the time of the latter rain." &gt;&gt; In the season of the latter rain, &gt;&gt; the season of the latter rain. Ask for rain. &gt;&gt; So the Lord is saying do not keep mute. &gt;&gt; Open your mouth &gt;&gt; and go to the Lord and say Lord I need this &gt;&gt; because your word has said &gt;&gt; that you supply all of my needs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother saidh &gt;&gt; that God will create the circumstances. or he will create the situation to match his word. &gt;&gt; So when he has sent the word he will make sure that he will take the son of God create the condition to match up his word. So when he said I am the Lord your healer &gt;&gt; he will come to you and make sure that your circumstance will match that word. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible said that the word will not go back to him void. The word has an aim of accomplishment. &gt;&gt; So when the word is coming, it must match up with your circumstance or your situation to produce the result. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the Lord shall make bright clouds &gt;&gt; and give them showers of rain. to every &gt;&gt; every one grass in the field. &gt;&gt; Every one of us in the field, &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ is the field &gt;&gt; and each one of us form part of the field. So the promise is to every one grass. &gt;&gt; So when we come to God and ask of rain, His promise is that he will give us showers of rain. &gt;&gt; Showers, &gt;&gt; not singular, showers, plural every situation in your life. &gt;&gt; He has promised that he's going to shower rain. Amen. To accomplish the purpose of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, just jump to verse three. He said my anger was kindled against the shepherds. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means um those he he had said okay let me just read verse two. He said for the idols have spoken vanity &gt;&gt; and the divveness have seen a lie and have told false dreams. They comfort in vain. Therefore they went their way as a flock. &gt;&gt; They were troubled because there was no shepherd. &gt;&gt; That's right. My anger was kindled against the shepherds. &gt;&gt; And I punished the goats. For the Lord of hosts, the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; have visited his flock, &gt;&gt; the house of Judah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we have the Lord visiting us &gt;&gt; in this end time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the cloud. &gt;&gt; So he comes to tell you that I am the Lord of hosts &gt;&gt; that has visited you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And have made them &gt;&gt; as his godly horse &gt;&gt; in battle. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Ready for again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goodly horse &gt;&gt; in battle. &gt;&gt; What is your battle tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says he's made you &gt;&gt; a godly horse &gt;&gt; in that battle.

So whatever situation &gt;&gt; that happened in your life, &gt;&gt; the Lord is calling you as a horse, &gt;&gt; bring him to that battle and let him do the fight. You are just watching with your eyes. Whatever financial battle, whatever physical battle, whatever spiritual battle, bring him under scene tonight and he will do the fighting. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet gave us &gt;&gt; four corners &gt;&gt; of deliverance. I I call them four corners. &gt;&gt; Spiritual blessing, &gt;&gt; physical blessing, &gt;&gt; financial blessing, &gt;&gt; material blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't call us to just be um specialist in just one corner. &gt;&gt; Some of us are specialists in only healing. &gt;&gt; So it is only healing your whole life. &gt;&gt; But we have four corners of the whole building. &gt;&gt; He's asking you to enjoy your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just sit in one corner. Amen. The financial blessing is yours. The physical blessing is yours. The material blessing is yours. The spiritual blessing is yours. And he has called you as a goodly horse &gt;&gt; in battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2026. &gt;&gt; No matter the challenge, no matter the battle, we are goodly people. &gt;&gt; And goodly is somebody that is beautiful. Amen. Even in your situation, you are going to be shining. Amen. that even the situation will look at you and said, "You don't belong here." The situation of disease will say, "Hey, you are too beautiful to be here." The situation of poverty will look at you and say, "You are a son of God. You don't belong here. 2026, a goodly people." God bless you. Praise God. Amen. You see what brother Brandham say? Every preacher coming from the angle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You like a goodly horse of battle. &gt;&gt; Amen.

So like, like the brother was saying, we just push forward. Amen. You push forward and the Lord does the work. Amen. Because he swore by himself. He's immutable. He has a reputation to uphold for himself. Amen. Amen. See, because see, he's omnipotent. Amen. He's he he's he's a he's our advocate. Amen. See, amen. Uh uh because man's ways are not of himself. Amen. See, because we can think we're going a certain direction, but it's just the Lord leading us that way to begin with. Amen. Amen. See, and um we have a a word of the day I want to share with y'all. I have a app on my phone gives me the word of the day. And the word of today was a was a quintessence. And what that means is the most perfect or typical example of equality or class. Amen. So we are the quintessence of the scripture. We're the we're the quintessence of this word. Amen. We we are the perfect embodiment of this word. Amen. See you. We're the perfect class. We're we're the we're the god race. Amen. See and when when you're the god race, amen, everything is below you. And brother Benham said, brother Benham said, see when civil this civilization is below us, it's like a pig. Amen. So we don't desire the things of this world. Amen. We're soldiers in Christ.

See, because when when when you realize that in 1 Timothy 6:18, Amen. The latter part of that scripture says you must be willing to communicate. Willing to communicate. Willing to communicate what? This gospel. Will willing to communicate the goodness of God. I mean, willing because when you have the faith, the faith produces a um a willingness to to to to spread joy, to spread your testimony. I mean, when you spread your testimony, Amen. It's it's infectious. It touches others. Amen. It causes others to be convinced and then concerned as well. Amen. Amen. And uh Amen.

Let me move closer. Brother Dearm, brother Albert, come on. Don't get tired. We still have two more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm need to go five minutes, then we move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother. &gt;&gt; Hello. God bless you all. I believe we're doing good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could all stand to read the scripture. Amen. If we can go to 1 Peter chapter 5:8, &gt;&gt; if you're there, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The scripture reads this. &gt;&gt; It says, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour." You may be seated. And I also want to read a quick another one in Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter 3, excuse me. Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 2022. Surely as a wife treacherously depart departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, oh house of Israel, says the Lord. A voice a voice was heard upon the high place, weeping and supplication of the children of Israel, for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the Lord their God. Return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backsliding &gt;&gt; your backslidings. Behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the God bless the reading of his word. And as for my subject today, it's arise soldier of the cross, lock in. For those that know it, it just means to be focused. In other words, the reason why I chose that is because I love watching um soldiers of faith like Paul and like Martin that was spoken in the church ages. And the reason why I picked this because in this time and age, you can we cannot afford to be backsliding. We cannot afford to do anything that's contrary to the word because the devil, like the scripture say, is like a roaring lion seeking who he can devour. And just to give like a quick uh example, for example, I went to a place one time and it was me and a beloved. We were walking. We were trying to and I tried to greet a sister, a mother or so. And she ignored me. And as we were going up in the elev elevator, she finally noticed who I was. And after she was like, "Aren't you the son of my father?" Then he noticed the other brother. He was like, "Aren't you the son of this and this?" Then after that, she was like, "We're going to Oh, so y'all are chosen to be like a part of like the wedding or so. we're gonna see the way you're dancing. But the attitude she gave seems like they were just waiting for our downfall. And the reason why I said that because many times as believers, wherever you're walking, there's many people that are there that will always look at you to see if you're going to fall. And the moment you fall, that's when they're going to seize it and after that start acting upon it. And I'm here to tell you that you should not falter. You should not let every just because everything may seem to appear nice or someone may seem to appear good, it doesn't mean for you to slack off or anything like that because just that instant of you slacking off is what's going to cost you a lot. &gt;&gt; And if I could read from the prophet for a little bit, he says man was made a secondary god on earth. He was given the power to control all things, all elements of the earth and was Adam. And Adam was given these great powers. But then the power that he was given to make his choices is where he fell. And Adam could speak to the winds and he and it will stop. He could speak to the trees and they would obey him. He could speak to the wild wildlife, it would obey him. He could speak to the waters ever ever what it was everything obeyed Adam. Now that's the beginning of man. That's what God give men gave him power over everything on earth. And the reason why I say that because in our walk as we're walking and we're advancing to the mark of the high calling, we're supposed to stay diligent and vigilant. Sure, sometime you might fall a little bit, but you have to pick yourself up and keep going. Brother Brenham even spoke about having brethrens that will support you and help you to keep pushing whenever you backslide. They'll put you back in the right path and you and the believer is supposed to stay with the word of God. Like I was listening to the church ages when they were talking about Martin. Can you believe a man that stick with God to a point where they will even kind of crucify him and put him on on a tree and then when his enemy expected him to fall a certain way to die, the tree fell the opposite way. Can you believe certain people like Paul, someone who worked for God to the point where he was stoned and died and after he was resurrected and continued to work for God. See, people like that aspire should be aspiring us to do greater to do the greater works and to keep advancing and to not fall. And when we fall, he tells us to pick it up and keep going like Shamgar. Shamgard. There were Philistines, I believe, that came up and tried to tried to take his crop. And he said enough is enough. And after he picked up his ox um &gt;&gt; ox glow and he went on and killed a thousand people because he was diligent and he was persistent in his walk. He was persistent. All thing like Enoch, all you see in the Bible about Enoch, it says that he walked with God till he was gone. meaning he was persistent wherever he went with God and to the point where even if we don't even know if he failed or not, we don't know if anything bad happened because he was so persistent with God. When you're persistent with God in God, God will cover your faults and God will keep you moving forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I could read um one more thing, the prophet of God says in at thy word, Lord, 1954, he said this should never die and you're just with all the unity among you people. You should never let this drop. You should just keep going. Just keep on moving on. Don't get tired. If you feel a little slack, just keep moving. Anyhow, just go right on anyhow. Believe it. Just keep moving right along. Believe in God. And now and I'm sure God will bless you. And the reason why I say that you have to keep moving because our from time to time me and my me and my siblings we would talk concerning the word. And I remember one time my sister said if you're doubting that mean your house in heaven hasn't even been um constructed. Not even a break has been putting down. But every single time you believe it's like a break is being bu is building your house up. So as you keep moving and advancing God is putting down your break. As you keep saying amen to every scripture that's coming on, your house in heaven is being built. So keep on pressing till the end. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be persistent and vigilant and keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tony Allen, you know there is no way out. &gt;&gt; Come on, my brother. Praise God. You're moving very good now. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my brother. Five minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I bless y'all tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Let us go to a word of prayer. Oh, he already prayed. That's right. Okay. Get your Bibles. Turn to the book of Ephesians, &gt;&gt; chapter 3, &gt;&gt; verse 20. &gt;&gt; If you got it, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 3, verse 20 says, "Not unto him that is able &gt;&gt; to do exceeding &gt;&gt; abundantly &gt;&gt; above all that we can ask or think, &gt;&gt; according to the power that workketh in us." You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it says, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding &gt;&gt; and abundantly &gt;&gt; above all that we ask or think." &gt;&gt; So, I'm reading this scripture and it telling me tonight that there is nothing big enough. &gt;&gt; There's nothing big enough &gt;&gt; that I can ask for &gt;&gt; that God can't exceed it. So, and for God to honor that word right there, that mean everything you ask for in your corner mind that may seem big to you, God is telling you, I can always go higher. I can always give you more. I can always take you further down the road. And he said he says right here, he said it's according to the power that workketh in us. So that mean whatever you ask for tonight, &gt;&gt; you got power in you &gt;&gt; to exceed that what come out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Whatever your confession that come out of your mouth, the power lies within you &gt;&gt; to go further than that. &gt;&gt; Turn let's turn to the book of Kings real fast. The book of First Kings chapter 19. &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 19. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 19. &gt;&gt; Lord God. &gt;&gt; Yes my brother. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. &gt;&gt; And this is the story of of of Elijah &gt;&gt; and Elisha. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And if you look at this God is giving Elisha Elijah instructions. He said, he says, "And Jahu, the son of Nimsy, shall thou anoint to be king over Israel." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, Elisha the son of Shepherd of Amile shall thou anoint to be the prophet of of thy room. &gt;&gt; In thy room &gt;&gt; in thy room. He said, "And it shall come to pass that him that escape of the sword of Hazel shall Ju slay." &gt;&gt; And him that escape of the sword of Jahu shall Elisha slay. &gt;&gt; So God had already told Elijah that Elisha was going to take his place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had already told Elijah this. So, I want you to realize this. Elisha didn't ask for this anointing. &gt;&gt; Elisha did not ask for this anointing. This was all God. &gt;&gt; God decided that he was going to get Elisha this anointing. &gt;&gt; So, that mean Elisha ain't had no choice but to take this anointing. So, he tell Elijah to go down and anoint Elisha &gt;&gt; and and and anoint him that he can take his place. Now butter bann said that Elisha had a revelation. He already have a revelation that he was going to take Elijah place. So he began to follow Elijah everywhere he went. He began to keep his eyes on the prize. So sometime that's what you got to do. You got to stay focused. You got to stay focused. You got to keep your eyes on the word. Stay focused on the word. Amen. But what but what I want you to get out of this is that God ordered Elisha to receive a a a portion or not a portion but receive the same anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That Elijah had. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to break that down, I call that a single anointing. &gt;&gt; I call that a single anointing. But Elisha didn't ask for that. Elisha came back and say, "I want a double portion of that." He said, "I want a double portion of that." &gt;&gt; So Elisha was able to go exceedingly and abundantly even of what God had intended for him. &gt;&gt; It was God. God intended for him to have a single anointing. But Elisha was so anointed that he surpassed what God had for him. He made God change his mind and give him a double portion. So that's what me and you can do tonight. Whatever you need from God tonight, even if God got plans in your life, you got the ability to go up, raise it. You got the ability to take it higher. You got the ability to add on to what God has for you. You got that power on the inside to add on to that. &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Come over. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I'm sorry. We only do this once a year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should have done that maybe many time, but let me stay with the prophet at the New Year's Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will do exceedingly &gt;&gt; and abundantly above what you can &gt;&gt; ask or &gt;&gt; so when you stop God move up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elisha was entitled the anointing. &gt;&gt; But he came he say a double portion. &gt;&gt; Move out of my way. &gt;&gt; Don't try to block me. I got a race to run &gt;&gt; at the finishing line. &gt;&gt; I will see God face. &gt;&gt; Let me ask what the prophet say in this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, if I need to push, I will push &gt;&gt; because he will do exceedingly and abundantly. Right on time. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, &gt;&gt; come on up. My brother, &gt;&gt; you got 30 minutes to finish it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; We greet you in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We were praying to uh for the Lord to to you know to have a voice. This is our second service for the night. &gt;&gt; So uh &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could stand up on our feet and read Psalms chapter 124. &gt;&gt; It's a joy and a privilege to be to be to be to be in the house of the Lord and to be with you. Uh we remember that our my first service here was u was a a watch night like this one. &gt;&gt; And uh many doors opened since that service. If you if you have it, you can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "If it had not been for the Lord who was on our side, &gt;&gt; now may Israel say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; If it had not been for the Lord who was on our side, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When men rose up against us, &gt;&gt; then they had swallowed us quickh, &gt;&gt; when their wrath was kindled against us, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Then the streams uh the waters overwhelmed us. The stream had gone over our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the proud waters had gone over the soul. Blessed be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who has not given us as prey to their teeth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fogers. The snare is broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The snare is broken. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we are escaped. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a short while this evening, we want to talk about uh now may Israel testify. &gt;&gt; Amen. We &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Each time we we we are given 30 minutes, we try to preach on the seventh seal, but we we won't do that tonight. &gt;&gt; We won't do that tonight. So, as we come to the end of the year, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; and as we go into a new year, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. You know, no doubt many people tonight are in bars, some uh you know, shooting fireworks. I I had a business meeting in the afternoon and and the gentleman says, "I'm going to buy some champagne &gt;&gt; and toast some champagne with with my wife and then we'll we'll enter into the new year." I said, "I'm going to be in church today praising the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? I was thinking of Psalms chapter 124. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here the Bible is saying that if it wasn't for the Lord who was on our side, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible is saying that now let Israel say this. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes, you know, we have things upon our hearts. We have things in our minds. But it has to come to a time where God wants us to express &gt;&gt; the things that he has done for us. And if we look back in 2025, &gt;&gt; no doubt in your mind, no doubt as I'm standing here, some here in this building, some of you went to the hospitals, some few could have died. But you can say as this psalm says, if it wasn't for the Lord who was on our side, our enemies could have consumed us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God is saying, you must say that. &gt;&gt; Now, let Israel say that. If it wasn't for the Lord on my side, I could have lost my family. I could have lost my job. Uh I could have lost my marriage. Uh I could have lost my joy. I could have lost my salvation. Uh but God was on my side. Uh if God is for us, uh who can be against us. Uh if God is on my side, who can prevail against me? Hallelujah. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Let Israel say so. &gt;&gt; It was the Lord on my side. It wasn't my strength. &gt;&gt; It wasn't my intelligence. It wasn't my hard work. It was the Lord on my side. It was the Lord on my side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the the name of the Lord. No doubt some of us here are diabetic. &gt;&gt; And there was a time when the sugar went up &gt;&gt; and you could have died. &gt;&gt; But guess what? The Lord was on your side. The Lord was on your side. Hallelujah. Some of you tonight could have lost your home. Some of you tonight uh could have lost your life in an accident. Uh but the Lord was on our side. And we must testify. Uh we must praise God. Uh we must thank God. Uh we must shout. Uh we must praise. Uh we must jump. We must say hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Uh thank you Jesus. You say brother Eron you're getting too excited. You don't know what I've been through. You don't know my story. You don't know my situation. You don't know my year. You don't know my family. You don't know my finances. Uh let me rejoice. Let me rejoice. Let me rejoice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His mercy endures forever. His mercy endureth forever. Woo. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. David told his wife, David told his wife, "Let me dance unto the Lord." I say tonight, let me dance unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When David saw the ark coming, when David saw the ark coming, he couldn't help himself. &gt;&gt; He couldn't help himself. You know, he he forgot about his royal robes. He forgot about his servants. He began to shout and say, "Thank you, God. Thank you, Jesus." because he saw 2026 coming. He saw the Lord coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be the name of the Lord. Praise be the name of the Lord. If the Lord kept you, praise him tonight. Uh if the Lord healed you, praise him tonight. If God gave you a raise, worship tonight. Uh if God kept your house, uh worship. Uh if God gave you a wedding, uh worship. If God gave you healing, worship, if it wasn't for the Lord, our enemies would have consumed us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? When we are crossing over, &gt;&gt; a crossover is a bridge. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; A crossover is a bridge. &gt;&gt; And you know what a bridge is? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It's a bridge. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And you know when whenever you're crossing over &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; that's when the enemy comes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's when the enemy comes. &gt;&gt; That's when the enemy comes. But when the enemy comes like a flood, &gt;&gt; the Lord raises a standard. When the enemy comes like a flood, the Lord raises a standard. Because at the bridge, that's when the book is given to the bride. at the bridge. &gt;&gt; That's when Pharaoh and his horsemen, they sing in the Red Sea &gt;&gt; because the Red Sea was a bridge. &gt;&gt; And a bridge is a showdown. A bridge is a showdown. And I want to say tonight, let's have a showdown. Let's have a showdown. Let's have a showdown. I don't care what the devil says. I don't care what happens. I'm staying in the message. I'm staying in the message. I never chose the message. The message chose me. The message chose me. &gt;&gt; Some backslid in 2025, &gt;&gt; but you are here tonight. &gt;&gt; Why? The Lord was on your side. &gt;&gt; The Lord was on your side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are at a junction. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Many accidents happen at a junction &gt;&gt; because you know what at a junction some people they go full speedoo &gt;&gt; they ignore the traffic light. &gt;&gt; They ignore the roundabout &gt;&gt; but a son of God. When it comes to a junction he waits for the traffic light and the traffic light is an angel. The traffic light is an angel because before they cross the Red Sea, there was an angel. And the prophet says, "I the Lord will send my angel before your face." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tonight, &gt;&gt; no doubt the denominations, &gt;&gt; they are making resolutions. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's going to be the year of this. Oh, it's going to be the year of this. Oh, this is going to happen. &gt;&gt; You know what? We don't make resolutions. Because we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; And we are now under the third pool. &gt;&gt; And under the third pool, &gt;&gt; we don't make resolutions. We speak the word. Whatever you want in 2026, you can speak the word. You can stand up like a son of God and speak 2026. Whatever you need. &gt;&gt; And God says, "Why are you crying unto me? Speak the word and go forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's watch night, my friend. &gt;&gt; So, we have desert. We have desert. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:14. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens &gt;&gt; to divide the day from the night." &gt;&gt; And let there be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. So God made the sun and the moon &gt;&gt; to demarcate time &gt;&gt; and to demarcate days &gt;&gt; and years and seasons. That's right. &gt;&gt; So God is the one &gt;&gt; that created time. &gt;&gt; And God created time for his own purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the world will celebrate, oh 2025, 2026. But without God, it's meaningless &gt;&gt; because God is the one that created time. And he's the one that establishes the seasons. &gt;&gt; So you can never begin anything without the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you can never finish anything without the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why you finish the year with the Lord. You start the year with the Lord because he is the alpha and the omega. &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and the omega. And tonight is the alpha in 2025. And he's the omega of 2025. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The devil is playing with the clock. He's going too fast. &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 20, chapter 6 verse 22. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Now God spoke unto Moses. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he said, speak unto Aaron. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And his sons, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; and say to the to them, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; and bless them in this wise. &gt;&gt; Now, this was a commandment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was given to the Levites. Yes, &gt;&gt; by God. &gt;&gt; And God is saying to Moses, &gt;&gt; you must bless, tell Aaron, &gt;&gt; the Levites, the five-fold ministry, &gt;&gt; that they must bless the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we have a commandment to bless. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; we have an obligation to bless &gt;&gt; according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "The Lord," and this is the the way you shall bless them. The Lord bless thee &gt;&gt; and keep thee. &gt;&gt; The Lord make his face to shine upon thee &gt;&gt; and be gracious unto thee. &gt;&gt; And the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee &gt;&gt; and give thee peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say tonight in 2026, may the Lord bless you. May the Lord bless you. May the Lord bless your family. May the Lord bless your marriage. May he cause his face to shine upon you. May he raise his countenance to shine upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they shall put my name &gt;&gt; upon the children of Israel &gt;&gt; and I will bless them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God is saying amen. God is saying amen because we're applying the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Israel was already blessed. &gt;&gt; But God wanted the Levites to say it. &gt;&gt; So, let me say it tonight. &gt;&gt; God bless you in 2026. God bless your home in 2026. God bless your business in 2026. God bless your marriage in the name of Jesus. Uh God bless your health in the name of Jesus. Uh God bless the church in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid friends. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid friends. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Aaron, &gt;&gt; you are you you are going on a tangent." &gt;&gt; How would you greet each other? &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; There's a code for that. &gt;&gt; That's the code for that. Brother says, the nicest thing you can say &gt;&gt; to a brother is God bless you. &gt;&gt; And allow me this evening to say God bless you. &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; May his face shine upon you. And Psalms 34 says, "Those who look on him, &gt;&gt; they are radiant &gt;&gt; and they shall never be ashamed." &gt;&gt; When you look upon him, &gt;&gt; when you look upon him, you will never be ashamed. You'll never be afraid of 2026. You'll never be afraid of sickness, of bills, of divorce. If you look upon him, you are radiant. You are radiant. The Bible says the men of God, &gt;&gt; the men of David, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; the Bible says their faces &gt;&gt; were like the faces of lions. &gt;&gt; Their faces were radiant. &gt;&gt; Why they were looking at him? &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. And tonight we're looking to him. We are not looking at the White House. &gt;&gt; We're not looking at Trump. We are looking to him. &gt;&gt; I'm looking to Jesus. I'm looking to Jesus. I am looking to the lamb of God. Oh, thank you Jesus. I am not looking at the economy. I'm looking at Jesus. I'm not not looking at a brother. I'm looking at Jesus. I'm not looking at my bank account. I'm looking at Jesus. When Peter was looking at Jesus, he was walking on top of the waters. He was walking on top of the watershed in 2026. Look upon Jesus. Look upon Jesus. Look upon Jesus. But when he was looking at the situation, he began to sink. He began to sink. But Jesus reached in mercy when he reached down his hand for me. Hallelujah. Look at Jesus. Don't look at a man. Uh, look at Jesus. Don't look at your husband. Look at Jesus. Don't look at your wife. Look at Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you look at Jesus, &gt;&gt; your face changes. &gt;&gt; The face of Stephen changed. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he knew what he was talking about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses, &gt;&gt; he had to put a veil over his face &gt;&gt; because he had to be with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Upon the mountain, &gt;&gt; the prophet one time was talking to Sister &gt;&gt; Mira. &gt;&gt; He says, "I met a woman, &gt;&gt; a little Amish woman. &gt;&gt; Her face and her eyes were clear." &gt;&gt; And I could tell &gt;&gt; that she was been talking to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She had been with Jesus. There's something about you when you talk to Jesus. There's something about you when you look at Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But today, the devil want us to look at this man. Look at that man. Look at the look on the internet. Look on the news. Look on the social media. Look on Netflix. I am saying looking at Jesus. Look away to Jesus. Look away to Jesus. The prophet says we don't know &gt;&gt; what tomorrow holds. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; But we know &gt;&gt; who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; I don't know what 2026 holds, &gt;&gt; but I know who holds &gt;&gt; 2026. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; by your grace has projected to us a savior by your love. &gt;&gt; May it send him again tonight in the form of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now let me skip this and go and go and go and and go to something. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says this is brother Brham's newest message. &gt;&gt; I love this quote &gt;&gt; and I I might have read this before. He says, "Now my text this morning is an odd word &gt;&gt; shalom." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Shalom in the Hebrew means peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what I say to the church this morning. &gt;&gt; Shalom. That's peace. &gt;&gt; In Finnish is called Ja, which means God's peace be with you. &gt;&gt; God's peace. Shalom. The prophet says, "My new year's message &gt;&gt; to the church elected in Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; for 1964 &gt;&gt; for 2026, &gt;&gt; not just the church, the religious group, but the elect lady, &gt;&gt; the lady of the church, Christ's bride, &gt;&gt; whom I'm addressing to &gt;&gt; and he says, there are two scriptures rather, very contrast, &gt;&gt; one on the other, Isaiah says, arise and shine." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. for your glory has come upon you. The light is here. &gt;&gt; And then the next verse he says, gross darkness shall be upon the earth. &gt;&gt; So in 2026, gross darkness shall come upon the earth &gt;&gt; but upon the bride. The prophet saying, "Peace be with you." &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was giving the blessing according to numbers. So, brother Brennan was right in the scripture and tonight I am in the scripture and I say in 2026, peace be with you. &gt;&gt; Peace be upon your home. Peace be upon your marriage. Peace be upon your business. Peace be upon your church in 2026. &gt;&gt; So, darkness, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; is coming upon the earth &gt;&gt; and gross darkness are coming upon the people. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; But the Bible is saying, "Arise and shine." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For your light has come. &gt;&gt; And Isaiah says, "Watchmen, what of the night?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "The morning cometh, &gt;&gt; but not the night also." &gt;&gt; 20:26, "What of the night? &gt;&gt; The morning cometh, &gt;&gt; but the night also." &gt;&gt; And I'm saying, don't be afraid, church. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the news. &gt;&gt; Things will get worse. &gt;&gt; Politics will get worse. &gt;&gt; Wars in the Middle East will get worse. The church will become worse. &gt;&gt; Many others will backslide. &gt;&gt; But upon the bride, &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God be with you. God keep you. God shine his face upon you. &gt;&gt; May God bless you and keep you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says just before the breaking of the day, &gt;&gt; there's always one great light. that's always pleased in the heavens &gt;&gt; and that is the morning star. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says when you see the morning star getting bright brighter and brighter then the earth gets darker and darker &gt;&gt; and that's the reason it is bright is because the earth is darker &gt;&gt; and the church of this last days the called elected board of Christ has been promised by the Bible that he would give them the morning star. &gt;&gt; That's it. So for 2026, God has given us the morning star. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are able to walk in darkness because we have the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Job chapter 31 verse verse 35. Let's read this together. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Job was saying, "Now, &gt;&gt; oh that one who would hear me, &gt;&gt; behold my desires that the Almighty would answer me that my adversary had written a book." &gt;&gt; So Job spend a lot of chapters complaining. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; and explaining &gt;&gt; why are all these happen to me? &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I pay my tithe. &gt;&gt; I feed the poor. I've I've never looked my eyes upon a woman. I've never abandoned the fatherless. Why is this happening to me? &gt;&gt; And his friends were accusing him. &gt;&gt; And Job spent 30 chapters &gt;&gt; trying to reason his situation. &gt;&gt; He spent 30 chapters &gt;&gt; trying to make sense of his situation. &gt;&gt; How can this happen? &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a god. I'm a prophet. I'm a wise man. The wisest in the east. &gt;&gt; Why have I lost everything? &gt;&gt; Why have I lost my health? &gt;&gt; Why have I lost my finances? &gt;&gt; I've done all these righteous deeds. &gt;&gt; You can read about them the whole chapter. He talks about many things. &gt;&gt; I fed the poor. I've never, you know, I've paid my workers on time. I've never taken anything without paying. &gt;&gt; Job was righteous. And he was struggling with the wash &gt;&gt; because you know what we are trained to believe &gt;&gt; that if I'm a son of God this shouldn't happen. &gt;&gt; If I be the son of God &gt;&gt; this shouldn't happen. And that's where the devil tricks us &gt;&gt; because he said to Jesus Christ, "If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; turn the stones into bread." &gt;&gt; Because the devil likes to prove sunship &gt;&gt; by natural substance. &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; why are you still renting? &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, why are you sick? If thou be the son of God, why are you struggling? &gt;&gt; So Job was negotiating and reasoning. &gt;&gt; Why if I be the son of God, why am I sick? &gt;&gt; And you know what? &gt;&gt; All this time, &gt;&gt; God was quiet. &gt;&gt; When we when we are arguing and debating and exchanging quotations and reasoning, God was quiet. Because God does not enter into foolish arguments. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the devil wants you to prove that you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; The reason why the devil wants you to prove is because he doubts &gt;&gt; that you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know who I am. I know who I am. I have got nothing to prove. I know who I am. I know what God has made me. I know whom I have believed. I know where I come from and I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; And Job continues and says, "If I have eaten fruits thereof without money, other words taking without paying. &gt;&gt; If I have caused the owners thereof to lose their life, &gt;&gt; if I have violently taken something from someone, Let fisttos grow instead of wheat &gt;&gt; and cocoa instead of barley. &gt;&gt; Now here here's the key. &gt;&gt; But the words and the words of Job are ended. &gt;&gt; God is waiting for you. &gt;&gt; When you shut your mouth, when you shut your mouth, you stand still. When you stand still, then you see the salvation of the Lord. When you quit stalking, uh when you quit gossiping, uh when you quit complaining, uh then you see the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May I say this with closing? &gt;&gt; Don't worry about your situation. &gt;&gt; Don't talk about it. Don't think about it. &gt;&gt; Stand still. &gt;&gt; Stand still. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes, you know what? &gt;&gt; We we we we like to take, you know, we give God something. We come and take it back. &gt;&gt; It's like my daughter, she's 2 years old. She she will give me my phone. She will take it back. She will give me, she'll take it back. But God doesn't like that. He will just wait &gt;&gt; and wait &gt;&gt; and wait and then when we are quiet, &gt;&gt; when we our when our words are ended, &gt;&gt; because you know what? Many times we try to contend for ourself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We try to fight for ourself &gt;&gt; because we have rights. We we try to explain ourselves &gt;&gt; sometimes. That's why our homes are toxic. &gt;&gt; Our marriages fail &gt;&gt; because we want to explain. &gt;&gt; We want to be understood. &gt;&gt; We want to prove that he's wrong. 30 chapters. &gt;&gt; Job was trying to explain himself. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something as we get into 2026. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Don't explain anything. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't prove anything. &gt;&gt; May the Lord fight for you. &gt;&gt; May the Lord fight your battles. Brother Brham &gt;&gt; was sitting. Dr. Best was arguing with Bosworth. Divine healing is this. Divine healing is this. Brother Brham was just sitting. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was just quiet. &gt;&gt; And because he was quiet, there was a host of angels &gt;&gt; that came down &gt;&gt; and the pillar of fire came down &gt;&gt; and says, "Son of God, stand up." You know when Job's words ended, the pillar of fire came down &gt;&gt; and he says, "Job, stand up. &gt;&gt; I will speak to you." &gt;&gt; And may I say tonight, stand up. &gt;&gt; God is going to bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, church. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The praise God. Praise God. Amen. You got everything from the beginning. Eight preachers, eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody happy? &gt;&gt; Shake somebody's hand and say, "I'm still alive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're not 2026 yet, &gt;&gt; so chill out. We will enter soon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The musician can come on, praise God, and the deacon can get prepared for the Lord's supper. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; God send his word to heal us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2026, my friend, speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to see God in his whole manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2026, the manifestation of God more real in your life. Every way, every corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every single little step, you see God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. As the deacon, get ready. Brother Robert, praise God. I'm going to read a quote from Brother Brham here. Sister Akos came here with a severe headache from the morning and now she's completely healed. &gt;&gt; You see what the Lord does? &gt;&gt; You remember what I told you on Sunday? &gt;&gt; You can take Tylenol, &gt;&gt; pray for the Taleno. &gt;&gt; You can go to the hospital, pray for the hospital. &gt;&gt; But come to the house of the Lord. His presence is there. Brother Brandham say his presence brings healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And do you know that the Lord's supper brings healing? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There is another opportunity for healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say in the message ordination it's preached in 1962 in November the 4th in the evening in paragraph 73. Brother Brham say do you know that communion has divine healing in it? When the Israelite in the type took the communion and marched 40 years and when they come out of the wilderness there was not a feeble one among them &gt;&gt; two and a half million people sir &gt;&gt; because of the Lord's supper &gt;&gt; they took communion they ate the lamb the bible brotherham continue he says there is power of healing in communion everybody is welcome Welcome now. And our sister, if she will come to the piano, she plays this song. There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's van &gt;&gt; where do you see how we synchronize? Did I tell you what to sing? It came from the coat. Somebody is here. Amen. Where sinners plunge beneath the flood, lose all their guilty stand, may your sins be forgiven. Children, may the grace of God ever be with you while we are in this journey. May we all meet on the other side, happy and young again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Corinthian chapter 12 as we change the order of the service. 1 Corinthian chapter 11 actually. Praise God. Hallelujah. We still have time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will have plenty of time the whole day tomorrow to send texts, messages, posting. I already start receiving messages. So if I don't respond to you, happy new year, my friend. Don't get mad because my phone is flooded and my number keep going from one person to another and brother so and so brother so and so give me your number but so and so imagine what comes through my phone. Amen. &gt;&gt; So happy new year in case I didn't answer you because he already started. Amen. 1 Corinthianap 11 verse 20. If you there you can say amen. When ye come together therefore into one place. We are here in one place. This is not to eat the Lord's supper. Remember it's not the Lord breakfast. &gt;&gt; It's not the Lord dinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the Lord's supper. It have to be done in the evening. &gt;&gt; Years ago, I went to a church. I saw the Lord's supper in the morning in the message church. &gt;&gt; Enough of this compromise. Amen. Verse 21. For in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper. In other words, everybody already ate at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one is hungry and another is drunken. Before you know it, they start eating, drinking, and then somebody's drunk in the church. Verse 22. What have you not houses to eat and drink in? Or despise ye the church of God? So the gathering was in the church of God in one place. It was the church of God like we are tonight. And shame them that have not. What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. For I receive of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night, not in the morning, in which he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." It's a commandment. That's the reason why we do it. These ordinances we do in them because it's the word of God remembering the body of Jesus Christ. Verse 25, after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you uh this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me." So we remembering the Lord. Verse 26. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death until he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. And we're going to give you time. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. The Lord's body is the believers. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you. We don't want that. And many sleep. For if we would judge oursel, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chestnuts of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tear one for the other. How do you t one for another? Do I sit here waiting for you to finish your confession? What does he mean? Brother Brham says this so we understand what that means. In the message ordination again in 1962 brother Brandham say 11:04 in the evening in paragraph 64 he say and we believe that when we come together he said terry one for another word wait on one another. The word terry means to wait on one another. Now as uh now as has been accustomed to us, we take the scripture in this way. Brother Brandham, now he's going to show you how do we wait or t one another. He say that when we do this, we just bow our head and the congregation prays for we pastors. I'm I'm interpreting to you so today you would know what Terry means. Brother Brandham say we bow our heads and the congregation prays for we pastors. We pastors pray for our congregation. That is how we wait on each other. &gt;&gt; By serving each other by praying. &gt;&gt; You pray God forgive my pastor. If there is anything in his life that they have done you forgive them for it. &gt;&gt; Forgive them. They didn't mean to do it. And we come right back the pastors praying for our congre our congregation. God, this is the little flock that you give us to watch over. If there is anything wrong in their life, take it away, Father, so we can all stand together around, fellowship around, knowing that we are coming here keeping the order of God and taking communion. I think it's a sweet time of fellowship. &gt;&gt; So telling one another, you all pray for me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I will pray for you. &gt;&gt; So the Lord forgive you and the Lord forgive me. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So I'm going to finish the scripture. The Bible say, "Wherefore my brethren, when we come together to eat, tar one for another." You know what it means now? And if any man hunger, let him eat a home that he come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will last set in order when I come. So let's go ahead and let's pray for one another as they play softly. And then when we finish that, we will pray for the bread and we will pray for the wine. If there is anything, put it under the blood. If somebody got you mad before coming to church, put it under the blood. If you're spies, you have a misunderstanding argument because the devil usually want to wait before church. One is lingering in the bathroom taking too long. Another one is hurrying trying to be on time in church and one was upset. Let's put it under the blood. Let's approach this table for healing. Like Israel, taking the bread, entering the new year with the bread and the wine inside your body. Just like Israel entered the Exodus with the bread and the blood. They they they ate actually the lamb and they walked 40 years and God protected them in the during those 40 years. They made mistake and everything but God kept them strong. May the Lord who did it in the first Exodus naturally under the natural lamb he can do exceedingly and abundantly unto the spiritual lamb of God which is correctly the antitap. Don't look at one another. Pray. Heavenly father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, again thanking you for your grace, thanking you for your love, thanking you for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us from the beginning of this year all the way to now. Lord, tonight you have spoken to us through various gift that you put in the body, eight preachers in the row, bringing your word one after the other. And father, not only that, you are adding again another blessing tonight, Lord, to give us the opportunity to be able to participate in this communion. Lord, communion, your prophet told us that it's a showdown. He told us that it's our duty to take communion. And father, Lord Jesus Christ, you have given us a place that we can do it. And looking outside at the oncoming building, we know that if we tar in 2026, we will have a communion also in there. But Lord, Father, we are approaching you asking you forgiveness for everything that we grieve the Holy Spirit. Lord, in our word, in our mind, in our thinking, in our action, reaction, anything that we have done that we have forgotten, Lord Jesus Christ, may you forgive us, Lord. As we waiting Lord Father upon one another according to the word of the prophet Lord I'm praying for the entire congregation praying for the musician praying for the deacon in their post of duty praying for all the officers praying Lord Father for the musician here in their post of duty asking you as a shepherd as a pastor to forgive the congregation father these people loves you these people stand for your word by the ability you have given them. They are always there in the service whenever they can. Lord Father, Lord Jesus, they came tonight pressing on, Lord Father, regardless of what happened, they wanted, Lord, Father, to cross over into your presence, Lord, so that as you met, Lord, the widow woman of name, may you meet one another, Lord, Father, tonight entering 2026, beginning with you, ending, and we want to begin again with you, Lord. Father, forgive their sins. Forgive their iniquity. Forgive their trespasses. Forgive everything that they have done, Lord. Father, that the devil has brought the condemnation to their to their heart, Lord. Father, may you wipe it again, Lord, Father, by the blood of Jesus Christ. And may none tonight, Lord, Father, be found outside of the blood, but may everybody be found within the blood, Lord, and inside and covered by the blood, Lord. Father, forgive my brother, forgive my sister, forgive our children, forgive our elderly. Lord, Father, look at us through the Calvary to the blood of Calvary, the atonement tonight, Lord, Father, and cleanse us completely so that when we approach you, we're not approaching you with any righteousness of our own, but we are approaching you by the righteousness of the lamb because you are our righteousness. Father Lord, now that you have cleansed every word, every action, every reaction, any meditation that was not pleasing unto thee and we have put everything under the blood. Father, as Lord, Father, we are opening the bread and my brother is breaking it, Lord. Father, remembering the broken body of the lamb that was broken, Lord, Father, by Lord, strap going all the way and hitting your back, Lord. Father, you screaming, you crying, Lord, because you knew that one day there will be a church, there will be a spoken word standing, Lord. Father, at the Eve ready to cross over to 2026 and Father, you accepted, Lord, Father, the shame. You accepted to be beaten, Lord. You accepted your body to be broken, Lord. You accepted to receive the scar so that tonight we can approach this Lord's supper with confidence, Lord. Father to receive our healing, Lord, as my brother is breaking the bread. May you bless this bread, Father. You did it for Israel. May your spirit, Lord, Father, come tonight and anoint this bread in a special way. As this bread is entering our body, may this bread be anointed like you anointed the stone of David. May every golad in the body of your children father everything that is not functioning right every allergies any problem any kidney or whatever problem is in the body may lord father the healing power in this bread touch and remove it Lord may you give strength and energy may you renew your children Lord you told us that you renew us like the eagle Lord Father as they are uncovering Lord Jesus Christ the wine father We pray that you bless it Lord.

Whoever is struggling with stomach, oh Lord Father, whatever is going on in the body, Father, bring healing Lord. Father, we taking this with faith according to your word. And we know, Lord, Father, that Yeshua will do exceedingly and abundantly above everything we can ask and and think. Lord, we humbly ask it, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. In Jesus precious name. Hallelujah. Thank you, brother Tony. You can begin to direct the people as they coming one by one. And brother set you can lead with the song. Thank you.

Let's go to the book of John chapter 13. So we switch to the feet washing. Getting close to 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Good to see you, brother Captain. &gt;&gt; The devil made him fall twice. Fall and hit his head and swollen and went to the hospital. He's there with everything from the hospital. Right. &gt;&gt; God is alive. He still have something to do with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 13:E1. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. and supper being ended, the devil having having now put into the heart of Judas his ciote Simon's son to betray him. Jesus knowing that the father has given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God. He rise he he riseth from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself the creator of heaven and earth. After that he pour water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the tower wherewith he was guarded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter say unto him, Lord, does thou wash my feet? Jesus answer and say unto him, "What I do, thou knoweth not now, but thou shall know hereafter." Peter say unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou has no part with me." So it's important to wash feet. Simon Peter say unto him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hand and my head." Jesus say unto him, "He that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but he is clean every wheat, and ye are clean, but not all." For he knew who should betray him? Therefore he say, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, he had taken his garment and was set down again. He said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me master and lord, and ye say well for I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. That's the reason why we do it. For I have given you an example that he should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is no greater than his Lord, neither neither he that is sent greater than he that that sent him. If ye know these things, sad are ye. &gt;&gt; Happy are ye if ye do them. So if you do it is a promise &gt;&gt; for God to make you happy. &gt;&gt; So the sister will stay right here in the sanctuary and the brother will go right there.
