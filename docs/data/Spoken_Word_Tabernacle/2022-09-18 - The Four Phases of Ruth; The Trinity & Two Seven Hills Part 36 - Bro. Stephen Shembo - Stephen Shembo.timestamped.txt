[21:18] we thank you Father for traveling grace
[21:20] getting our csfully from our different
[21:22] places we are so thankful that we still
[21:25] have an opportunity to Worship You
[21:27] freely we know a lot there are places in
[21:29] the world today but Christianity is
[21:32] illegal you can't be you can't display
[21:34] or practice Christianity openly because
[21:37] you can go to jail or you can be killed
[21:39] but we are thankful Lord that we live in
[21:41] a country at least for now that we can
[21:44] freely worship you father without any
[21:46] fear of any repercussions so Lord what
[21:49] are we going to say on that day some
[21:51] people are more sincere than us they are
[21:53] even more dedicated but yet they live in
[21:55] places whereby it is so dangerous to
[21:59] display your religion but here we are we
[22:01] have this opportunity right now but many
[22:04] times Lord we don't even worship you the
[22:06] way we ought to may you forgive us Lord
[22:08] for our sins our shortcomings and all
[22:10] our iniquities Lord we bring all our
[22:13] faults and ourselves
[22:15] the wrongs and everything before you we
[22:18] kindly ask you to wash us with your
[22:19] blood Lord we are kindly ask you
[22:22] to help each and every one of us here so
[22:25] that our coming here is not going to be
[22:27] in vain and you will help us Lord to pay
[22:29] attention to what the spirit has to say
[22:32] to the church today may we go out of
[22:34] those doors being made better Believers
[22:36] better Christians because they will love
[22:38] towards us Lord is so good and so
[22:40] wonderful you have loved us regardless
[22:42] of our short fail our shortcomings and
[22:43] our failures at one time lord the poet
[22:46] wrote and said the love of God is so
[22:48] high so good so great so wonderful it's
[22:51] so high we can't even get over it so
[22:53] wide we can't get around it it's so low
[22:55] so deep we can't get under it Lord they
[22:58] said if all the people on Earth were
[23:02] scribes and the sky is made of parchment
[23:05] and the oceans were filled with ink and
[23:08] every stock was probably a pen to write
[23:10] the love of God on high who drain the
[23:12] oceans dry that is how my how great your
[23:15] love is Father Lord we are so grateful
[23:17] that your love is unconditional towards
[23:19] us even though we've seen so many times
[23:21] against you you have never loved us less
[23:24] Lord you loved us before the foundation
[23:27] of the world like Paul says while we
[23:29] were yet sinners Christ died for us so
[23:32] Lord what can we do for you there's
[23:34] nothing we can bring because all of our
[23:36] righteousness there are 50 ranks but
[23:38] Lord there's one thing we can do we can
[23:40] try to love you better you can try Lord
[23:42] to do better in these areas we have been
[23:45] failing you help us today Father may be
[23:47] a different day May it not just be an
[23:50] ordinary day but may it be a day that
[23:52] you always remember that on that day
[23:54] September the 18th in the year 2022 the

[48:17] use a young man when I say what you go
[48:20] ahead and read it brother Angelo let's
[48:21] start with you today
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:25] hahaha
[48:27] so when I say what you read it louder
[48:30] amen
[48:31] praise be to the name of God this is not
[48:35] a church of spectator
[48:37] we all participating into the service
[48:40] amen glory to God let's go to our
[48:43] reading this morning
[48:47] Hallelujah
[48:50] so be always prepared you don't know
[48:52] when you're going to get caught
[48:56] so start reading your Bibles start
[48:58] listening to the message be familiar
[49:00] with the message and the Bible in the
[49:02] scripture everything will be okay amen
[49:05] so we know you're in training so just be
[49:08] relaxed everything will be all right we
[49:11] always have one service on Sunday and
[49:15] that's the way I was led to do it so you
[49:19] eat good you go home you relax and you
[49:22] start showing back on it so
[49:25] the messages take your pressure off
[49:29] and let me do what I gotta do
[49:31] when I finish you free
[49:34] okay
[49:37] that's a plain way to say it not a
[49:40] political way I'm not a politician it's
[49:43] hard to use too much just go straight to
[49:47] the point Genesis chapter 3 verse 1.
[49:50] amen
[49:52] I'm repeating back the scripture because
[49:54] I can't even dig into it by the time I
[49:57] get there somebody's pulling amen
[50:00] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[50:04] beast of the field which the Lord God
[50:06] had made you might be seated
[50:09] and he said to the woman
[50:11] yea has God said that you shall not eat
[50:14] of every tree of the garden
[50:17] and the woman said to the serpent we may
[50:20] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[50:23] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[50:25] which is in the midst of the Garment the
[50:28] garden I'm sorry God has said You shall
[50:31] not eat of it neither shall you touch it
[50:34] lest you die and the serpents say to the
[50:37] woman you shall not surely die the woman
[50:41] gave the word of God and the serpent
[50:44] contradicted the word of God so
[50:46] automatically it's no longer the serpent
[50:49] it is Satan Lucifer in the serpent amen
[50:53] remember how Satan anointed Peter and
[50:57] Jesus Christ have to turn around and
[50:59] rebuke not Peter but we broke Satan and
[51:03] they say get thee behind me Satan so we
[51:06] start again back here with a spirit with
[51:10] the Devil
[51:11] amen
[51:13] the devil moved into the serpent
[51:17] and the serpent is the Beast
[51:21] it is impossible to preach this in one
[51:24] sermon
[51:25] amen I see the 70 weeks of Daniel
[51:28] dancing in front of me but you're not
[51:31] there yet so I came I can't get into it
[51:34] I see Russia dancing in front of me in a
[51:38] scripture I can see putting dancing
[51:40] around
[51:42] amen I see all of them dancing there so
[51:46] the more you swallow quickly the book
[51:49] everything will be okay amen I was
[51:53] sitting last night and I saw Armageddon
[51:55] pulling up
[51:56] and I saw God get my girl pulling up
[52:00] you see now
[52:01] how am I gonna get back to the Sabbath
[52:03] of Israel
[52:05] amen so we got the devil
[52:09] entering into the Beast because remember
[52:12] God does not enter anymore animal you
[52:15] know that we already gave you the code
[52:17] now from there the serpent begin to
[52:20] speak to the woman
[52:22] at first the woman was repeating or
[52:26] rehearsing the word of God that Adam
[52:28] gave it to him amen verse 5 for God does
[52:32] know that in the day you eat thereof
[52:35] then your eyes shall be open now the
[52:39] serpent begin to teach
[52:41] so not only is he a mouthpiece so
[52:44] remember last Sunday
[52:46] he's a mouthpiece
[52:48] he's a prophet
[52:50] but he's not a good Prophet because he's
[52:53] contradicting God so therefore he's a
[52:56] false prophet you remember and now he's
[52:59] teaching Eve and if he's a teacher he's
[53:03] a false one because he's teaching
[53:06] something that is contrary to the word
[53:08] of God
[53:09] the Bible says that uh the first five
[53:12] for God does know that in the day you
[53:15] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[53:17] and you shall be as Gods knowing good
[53:20] and evil verse 6 and when the woman saw
[53:24] that the tree was good for food and that
[53:27] it was pleasant to the eyes and they
[53:30] treat to be desired to make one wise
[53:32] another wisdom she took off the fruit
[53:35] thereof and did it
[53:39] and give also to her husband with her so
[53:43] now Eve becomes the teacher
[53:48] all right you remember
[53:50] she's now a mouthpiece
[53:55] she is now a prophetess
[54:00] she is now a teacher
[54:04] by the fox one
[54:06] everybody okay job to verse 11 the Bible
[54:09] says and he said this is God asking who
[54:13] told you that you were naked have you
[54:15] eaten off the tree whereof I commanded
[54:17] you that you should not eat and the man
[54:20] say
[54:22] the woman whom you give to be with me so
[54:25] in other words it's not me
[54:27] she gave me of the tree so the one who
[54:30] gave adam the tree is Eve
[54:33] amen and I did eat it and the Lord God
[54:36] said to the woman
[54:38] what is it what is this that you have
[54:41] done and the woman said the serpent so
[54:43] in other words it's not me I took it
[54:46] from the serpent the serpent began me
[54:48] and I did it everybody okay we know what
[54:52] happened to the serpent drop to verse 17
[54:54] and to Adam God say he said because you
[54:59] have hearkened to the voice of your wife
[55:01] so there is a voice that Eve have but
[55:05] that voice was not the voice of God that
[55:08] was a voice of the devil that voice
[55:10] started from the Devil Himself in heaven
[55:13] and he entered into a beast and the
[55:16] Beast went into a woman so right here as
[55:20] a conclusion there is a system that the
[55:23] devil uses
[55:25] everybody okay he uses a beast
[55:31] in combination with a woman
[55:35] and that woman is an immoral one
[55:41] everybody okay this is your formula
[55:46] the mathematics of God
[55:49] is he complicated
[55:50] [Music]
[55:53] is it complicated
[55:57] simply
[55:59] system equal
[56:00] amen
[56:02] let's go to Daniel chapter 7.
[56:06] if at least
[56:08] the Lord will help me we drop into the
[56:11] mouth you will see her numbering are
[56:13] working
[56:16] it is amazing with this message
[56:19] so good
[56:20] Daniel chapter 7.
[56:23] amen if you dare you can say Amen
[56:27] I'm using a military aircraft
[56:30] so you need your helmet
[56:33] everything back a lot because we're
[56:35] going to take off
[56:36] you know how it goes right it doesn't go
[56:39] like a commercial airplane it goes just
[56:41] straight and it's up
[56:48] seven verse 2.
[56:50] Daniel spoke and say I saw in my vision
[56:53] by not and behold the four wings of the
[56:57] heaven you know what winds are in this
[56:59] church now strove upon the great sea
[57:02] remember these animals are coming from
[57:04] the Great Sea
[57:06] they're coming from the great sea and
[57:09] you're going to see in Revelation that
[57:10] that coming also one will come from a
[57:13] sea not another one
[57:16] so the one that is coming from a sea is
[57:18] consistent with Daniel right right but
[57:20] the one that comes from the land is a
[57:22] different Beast
[57:24] that's why I told you read Revelation 12
[57:26] read Revelation 13. I know what I was
[57:29] talking about amen verse 3 and the four
[57:33] and four great beasts came up from the
[57:35] sea that verse one from another verse 4
[57:39] the first was like a lion
[57:42] and head ego wings
[57:44] I beheld till the wings thereof were
[57:47] plucked up
[57:48] and he was lift up from the earth so as
[57:51] long as those wings were there on the
[57:54] back of the lion the lion cannot
[57:57] transform
[58:00] amen the lion cannot move from a beast
[58:04] into a man
[58:05] as long as the Eagle's Wings are ready
[58:08] in other words the ego Wing are blocking
[58:12] the transformation
[58:14] or the process to amorphate the lion
[58:18] because the lion
[58:20] of Babylon
[58:23] the lion of Babylon have to move from a
[58:27] beast
[58:29] because the Bible say four Beast from a
[58:32] beast into a human
[58:35] because the Bible says a human heart was
[58:38] given to him amen so the Incarnation
[58:44] cannot happen
[58:46] these lion it symbols
[58:49] but it's a power in other words this
[58:52] power cannot enter a human being
[58:56] except you take off the wings of ego you
[58:59] remember what happened to Daniel when
[59:01] Daniel was taken off from the kingdom
[59:03] then something happened everybody okay
[59:07] okay verse 4 the first was like a lion
[59:10] and head ego Wings I'll be held till the
[59:13] wings would thereof were plucked and he
[59:16] was lift up from the earth because the
[59:18] lion have four power and he walked
[59:21] like a four-footed animal men walk with
[59:24] two
[59:25] so now the lion is no more walking with
[59:28] four the lion is lift up now he's using
[59:30] the hind feet
[59:32] as a man amen
[59:34] and he was lift up from the earth and
[59:37] made stand upon the feet as a man now
[59:40] you can see it clearly it's no longer an
[59:42] animal now it's a human being it symbols
[59:45] it's a prophetic language Kama and a
[59:48] man's heart so at the beginning he has a
[59:51] beast heart now a man's heart was given
[59:54] to him in other words they give him a
[59:56] human being and the and that Spirit
[59:59] enter the heart of the human being so
[1:00:03] when you're talking to a human being
[1:00:04] you're not really talking to a human
[1:00:06] being you are talking to a beast
[1:00:09] but he's more he's human
[1:00:13] everybody okay you have to know how to
[1:00:15] trace Satan and the man's heart was
[1:00:18] given to it amen so remember the
[1:00:21] Incarnation Never Could Happen only
[1:00:24] after the ego wings are plugged off so
[1:00:27] every time you plugged off the wind the
[1:00:29] ego Wings it's a danger
[1:00:35] okay somebody did it every time you
[1:00:38] remove the ego wings
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:41] you're making way
[1:00:44] for the devil
[1:00:49] some are still catching up do you know
[1:00:52] what I'm talking about when you take the
[1:00:54] ego wings and when you remove it from
[1:00:57] your house
[1:01:01] when you remove it from your life
[1:01:04] you just made way
[1:01:07] for the evil spirit
[1:01:10] let me go now plainly because somebody's
[1:01:12] still struggling when you take the
[1:01:15] message off
[1:01:16] outside
[1:01:19] of your church
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:23] you are inviting all hell
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:29] are we okay
[1:01:32] glory to God
[1:01:35] jump to verse 23.
[1:01:38] oh my God it's a military airplane
[1:01:41] that's how it cranks so it's now ready
[1:01:46] verse 23 does he say the four beasts
[1:01:49] shall be the fourth Kingdom upon Earth
[1:01:53] which shall be diverse from all kingdoms
[1:01:55] you already write this at home I assume
[1:01:57] and shall Devour the whole Earth
[1:02:02] there's no exception
[1:02:04] I'll accept one remember that Sunday and
[1:02:07] shall tread down and break it in pieces
[1:02:10] so this power remember this Kingdom have
[1:02:13] power over everybody except to one
[1:02:16] person you must be found in the Lamb's
[1:02:19] Book of Life
[1:02:20] let's go to Revelation 18 then we pray
[1:02:28] the ego wings
[1:02:30] I will show you what Eagle wings does
[1:02:33] they're very very interesting and I will
[1:02:37] go by the scripture and you're going to
[1:02:38] see what ego Wings do in the scripture
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:44] and as long as they there
[1:02:47] really powerful
[1:02:49] and they there for a purpose
[1:02:52] the ego Wings does things in your life
[1:02:55] but let's slow down and see where we're
[1:02:58] going to go let's go to Jeb um
[1:03:00] Revelation chapter 18. if you dare you
[1:03:03] can say Amen and after these things I
[1:03:06] saw another Angel you know that angel
[1:03:08] come down from heaven having great power
[1:03:10] and the Earth was lightened with his
[1:03:13] glory in other words the Earth was
[1:03:15] illuminated
[1:03:18] if you don't know that angel see me
[1:03:20] after church
[1:03:22] and he cried madly
[1:03:24] there is a cry
[1:03:26] madly we Face strong voice saying
[1:03:30] Babylon the lion
[1:03:32] the great is Fallen
[1:03:35] remember this Babylon is Babylon the
[1:03:38] Great
[1:03:39] not just Babylon but Babylon they're
[1:03:42] great remember that
[1:03:44] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[1:03:48] and he's become the habitation of devil
[1:03:53] and to and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:03:57] and a cage
[1:03:59] in other words a garbage can
[1:04:04] amen everything that is unclean is
[1:04:08] converging straight to Babylon the Great
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:13] so Babylon the great becomes the center
[1:04:17] of pollution
[1:04:20] the center of contamination
[1:04:23] the center of evil spirit if you want to
[1:04:26] find every bad spirit
[1:04:28] every devil you go there you're going to
[1:04:31] find them
[1:04:34] every unclean and hateful bird
[1:04:37] for All Nation because bird got
[1:04:40] something remember Abraham have to show
[1:04:42] bird off
[1:04:44] his offering
[1:04:45] do you remember the Butler and the baker
[1:04:48] the baker was eaten by birds
[1:04:57] that's fine we keep climbing for all
[1:05:00] nations have drank of the wine of the
[1:05:03] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[1:05:06] of the Earth have committed fornication
[1:05:08] with her
[1:05:11] and The Merchant of the earth our works
[1:05:14] reached through the abundance of head
[1:05:16] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:05:18] from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:05:23] my water
[1:05:25] so somebody will be in there
[1:05:30] and they can't get out without the voice
[1:05:36] there won't be a voice when therefore
[1:05:39] speak
[1:05:40] if you are a people of God when you hear
[1:05:44] that voice that voice is a jubilee
[1:05:49] he gives you power
[1:05:52] that no matter the presence of devil no
[1:05:56] matter how many Devils they are when you
[1:05:58] hear that voice
[1:06:00] there is no devil in hell
[1:06:02] that can stand in other words the devil
[1:06:05] will make way
[1:06:06] for you to live
[1:06:08] that's why they don't like you in

[1:12:47] Babylon the great will be burned
[1:12:50] amen when they say burning it is not
[1:12:54] that people will put fire and torches
[1:12:57] and go and begin to burn the houses
[1:12:59] it's a prophetic language
[1:13:02] that's not the burning
[1:13:04] amen the prophet could only use the
[1:13:06] language of their time
[1:13:08] even if they see an airplane they will
[1:13:10] look they will look they look they don't
[1:13:11] understand an airplane and the prophet
[1:13:13] just cried he said I see the wings of
[1:13:15] ego

[1:13:19] they look they see a Mercedes they turn
[1:13:21] they say I see Chariot no no no no
[1:13:24] horses and they have eyes like flame

[1:16:58] our faith we humbly ask it father in the
[1:17:01] name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God
[1:17:05] I'm going to remind you again
[1:17:08] brother Branham say now let this be
[1:17:10] known
[1:17:12] scripture does not play with words I was
[1:17:16] checking the microphone whatever is in
[1:17:19] the record is therefore the anointed
[1:17:21] eyes to see it is there for Earth
[1:17:25] still shaking is your microphone working
[1:17:28] perfect a little bit higher purpose
[1:17:31] higher purpose that's it okay amen my
[1:17:35] subject this morning is the four phases
[1:17:38] of roof the trinity
[1:17:41] and two Seven Hills
[1:17:46] not one seven here
[1:17:49] two Seven Hills
[1:17:52] before I move on
[1:17:56] my subject this morning is the four
[1:17:58] phases of roof
[1:18:00] number one the trinity
[1:18:03] and two
[1:18:05] Seven Hills so the total is fourteen
[1:18:08] Hills
[1:18:11] we are still in the threshing floor
[1:18:14] still dealing with the parable of the
[1:18:16] Virgin and we're dealing with the second
[1:18:18] one and in our Tabernacle language again
[1:18:22] we are very very very deep in the
[1:18:25] holiest
[1:18:26] we already added that we have the water
[1:18:30] you must come by the blood and you get
[1:18:33] entered by the spirit still the same
[1:18:36] work and the different name
[1:18:37] justification sanctification the blood
[1:18:40] and the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[1:18:42] bring the spirit of God into your life
[1:18:46] Jesus says this in Luke chapter 11 verse
[1:18:49] 24 when the unclean spirit is gone out
[1:18:53] of a man
[1:18:54] he walked through Dry places
[1:18:57] seeking rest
[1:18:59] and founded none he say I will return
[1:19:04] unto my house
[1:19:09] so they got so used to you
[1:19:11] until they're calling you their house
[1:19:19] everybody care who gave them the tired
[1:19:22] of Thee
[1:19:23] everybody okay I will return unto my
[1:19:27] house when sir came out
[1:19:30] and when he cometh he found defeat to
[1:19:33] how
[1:19:34] and water so the house was completely
[1:19:38] clean
[1:19:41] amen then he goes he doesn't enter
[1:19:45] then he goes then goes here and taketh
[1:19:49] to him seven are the spirit more wicked
[1:19:55] than himself and they enter in and do
[1:19:59] out there and the last state
[1:20:03] now it's eight demon
[1:20:06] at the beginning he was one when the one
[1:20:08] comes he comes and takes seven
[1:20:11] and he makes eight amen and the last
[1:20:14] state of damn man is worse than the
[1:20:17] water first in other words you cannot
[1:20:19] stay empty
[1:20:24] you cannot stop at only taking the devil
[1:20:28] out
[1:20:29] and cleaning the house you must fill
[1:20:33] that house with something
[1:20:36] because the devil that left will come
[1:20:38] back
[1:20:40] brother Branham interpret this this way
[1:20:42] glory to God brother but I'm saying now
[1:20:45] watch this evil spirit when he goes out
[1:20:49] he walk in Joy places hunting a place to
[1:20:53] find rest the Bible say he could not
[1:20:56] find it so he said I will return back to
[1:20:59] where I come out to where I come out of
[1:21:02] her
[1:21:03] he goes back to this person
[1:21:06] which is the house that he once was in
[1:21:08] and found the house all swept clean up
[1:21:12] and water
[1:21:15] we okay now so you cannot stop at
[1:21:19] sanctification
[1:21:20] it's a dangerous game
[1:21:23] that's why you see people coming into
[1:21:25] the message
[1:21:27] giving their life into Jesus Christ and
[1:21:30] they get their life Sanctified and after
[1:21:33] a while the bad habits keep coming back
[1:21:39] because they never move into the holiest
[1:21:42] and the devil is coming back again and
[1:21:45] searching the house and saying where is
[1:21:49] that man that can block me
[1:21:52] that's why you see somebody struggling
[1:21:54] with pornography and pornography goes
[1:21:58] away
[1:21:59] but once pornography is gone away he
[1:22:02] will come back again
[1:22:06] and for seven months you are not
[1:22:09] watching pornography and after seven
[1:22:11] months you don't understand for some
[1:22:13] reason you back again to the same thing
[1:22:16] what is bringing you back again it is a
[1:22:19] signal that the house is still empty
[1:22:23] foreign
[1:22:27] sanctify all condemnation gone oh I just
[1:22:32] really happy believer
[1:22:36] and oh just a really happy believer but
[1:22:40] it's water that's why you hear people
[1:22:42] coming up say oh that meeting was so
[1:22:46] good praise the Lord I felt the
[1:22:48] anointing you can feel the anointing but
[1:22:51] that anointing might make sure that
[1:22:53] anointing is in you not just over you
[1:22:56] because after a while you're gonna find
[1:22:59] yourself in trouble again
[1:23:01] up and down up and down and you're
[1:23:03] making yourself worse
[1:23:06] but Branham continue he said come here
[1:23:09] set another Spirit worse than he was
[1:23:12] will you please try to get this the
[1:23:15] Bible said that is the truth Jesus say
[1:23:18] it's the truth and he come back to this
[1:23:21] house a man who has confessed Christ to
[1:23:26] be his savior after the president altar
[1:23:29] has got rid of his wickedness
[1:23:33] has quit his water
[1:23:35] quit his water
[1:23:38] his water his water
[1:23:42] he's already in the Holy he has become
[1:23:45] sanctified clean out his house is all
[1:23:49] swept he feel free so he come back and
[1:23:53] he found a house then he goes and gets
[1:23:56] seven other Spirit words than he was and
[1:23:59] comes into this person the Bible says
[1:24:02] the last estate of the man is seven
[1:24:05] times worse than he was at the water so
[1:24:09] what I'm trying to say is never get
[1:24:12] satisfied to stop at the holiest make
[1:24:15] sure you go all the way down and you get
[1:24:19] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:24:22] the spirit of the Lord so when the devil
[1:24:24] are coming back again when they see the
[1:24:27] Holy Spirit
[1:24:30] when they see the strong men of the
[1:24:33] house then they know that the property
[1:24:36] that they thought was their property is
[1:24:39] no longer the property anymore somebody
[1:24:42] else has put claims on the house now the
[1:24:45] house belongs to God and forever that
[1:24:48] demon will never bother you
[1:24:50] so examine your life
[1:24:53] and look how Devils goes up and down
[1:24:56] and you're going to find out that you're
[1:24:58] still struggling in an area in other
[1:25:00] words walk back in the Tabernacle and
[1:25:02] you'll find out where you are whether
[1:25:04] you are in justification for whether you
[1:25:07] are in sanctification or whether you
[1:25:09] have the true baptism of the holy spirit
[1:25:12] because at the baptism of the holy
[1:25:14] spirit this is when you get your rest
[1:25:16] no more fighting you're not doing the
[1:25:19] fighting it is the spirit of the Lord
[1:25:22] doing the fighting because when the
[1:25:24] demon come you don't know
[1:25:27] you have found yourself only redoing the
[1:25:31] things that you stop doing
[1:25:33] amen so when he comes the Bible said
[1:25:36] that the holy of Israel doesn't sleep
[1:25:39] he doesn't even Slumber so somebody is
[1:25:43] 24 hours putting his weather around you
[1:25:46] and making sure not therefore can enter
[1:25:50] your house anymore when that demon
[1:25:52] Spirit comes back he found the Holy
[1:25:55] Spirit sitting while standing right
[1:25:57] there tapping his foot like that when
[1:26:00] the demons see the Holy Spirit he just
[1:26:02] turned around and he goes back again
[1:26:04] that's why you need the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:08] make sure you got the Holy Ghost to
[1:26:10] stand between you and Satan
[1:26:14] everybody okay so far my airplane is
[1:26:18] still going this way glory to God Amen
[1:26:21] now we are dealing with the subject of
[1:26:25] the Beast
[1:26:26] brother Branham says this that the Beast
[1:26:29] from the beginning was the beast in the
[1:26:32] Garden of Eden
[1:26:34] we okay
[1:26:35] we got a beast from the beginning in the
[1:26:38] beginning we are in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:41] amen and we saw that Beast was the
[1:26:43] serpent
[1:26:44] we already went through this amen now
[1:26:48] brother Branham say that he wants the
[1:26:50] beast in the Garden of Eden he is the
[1:26:53] Beast also at the end
[1:26:55] and it shows that he is a religious
[1:26:58] person and a water
[1:27:00] at the beginning he is a beast in the
[1:27:04] Garden of Eden we call him the serpent
[1:27:07] the old serpent which was the devil
[1:27:09] Satan
[1:27:11] amen Lucifer now at the end
[1:27:16] follow me carefully now in the end this
[1:27:21] Beast is a religious person
[1:27:27] amen and we explain to you that the
[1:27:31] religious person is a man
[1:27:34] black came amen and sometimes that Beast
[1:27:39] is also a denomination
[1:27:43] and the denomination is a church
[1:27:47] which is a woman
[1:27:50] anybody care and brother Branham say not
[1:27:54] only is he a denomination but it's a
[1:27:57] denomination that made the water the
[1:28:01] denomination in other words it's a
[1:28:03] church that makes church just like the
[1:28:07] church that bring forth the churches
[1:28:11] in other words it's a church that have
[1:28:14] daughters
[1:28:16] amen other women
[1:28:19] amen but those women will look like
[1:28:23] their mother
[1:28:26] everybody okay when these women are born
[1:28:30] they are virgin
[1:28:35] everybody okay at the beginning there
[1:28:39] will be good
[1:28:41] but after a while as they grow up they
[1:28:44] will begin to prostitute themselves
[1:28:47] and behave like their mother
[1:28:50] everybody okay so when you are dressing
[1:28:53] the beast at the end time
[1:28:56] sometimes the Beast will pop up like a
[1:29:00] religious man
[1:29:03] everybody okay
[1:29:05] and sometimes the Beast will come down
[1:29:08] as a woman
[1:29:11] everybody okay

[1:32:57] because Solomon said go drink water from
[1:33:00] your own sister
[1:33:02] that's right you don't know the

[1:33:38] of your own well
[1:33:40] let your fountain be dispersed abroad
[1:33:43] and rivers of waters in the street let
[1:33:46] them be only your own
[1:33:49] in other words for this system you must
[1:33:52] be very stingy
[1:33:56] you can give somebody water from your
[1:33:59] refrigerator but not this one
[1:34:01] this one is for only one person
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:05] let's continue reading
[1:34:08] let your fountain be dispersible and we
[1:34:11] first of water in the street verse 17
[1:34:13] let them be only your own
[1:34:17] and no stranger with water we cannot
[1:34:21] share this sister
[1:34:25] what is the sister and pastor
[1:34:28] job to verse 18 let your fountain be
[1:34:32] blessed
[1:34:33] and rejoice with water the wife of water
[1:34:38] of Water
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:41] everybody okay so a woman is a system
[1:34:47] so let's go back again now where we were
[1:34:49] in proverb 9.
[1:34:52] verse 17.
[1:34:56] I just ran away from there because
[1:34:58] marriage is pulling me there
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:02] you there verse 17 stolen Waters
[1:35:07] you see now it's not the correct water
[1:35:11] somebody's stealing water from somebody
[1:35:13] it's an adultery
[1:35:17] we clear now
[1:35:18] stolen water are sweet how can adultery
[1:35:22] be sweet
[1:35:23] the first sin that enter into Earth
[1:35:26] entered through adultery of evil
[1:35:28] remember
[1:35:29] that's why when brother Branham went to
[1:35:31] hell brother Branham remember only one
[1:35:33] thing he said I never committed adultery
[1:35:36] why did adultery Came From Hell
[1:35:40] because that was the original sin
[1:35:43] can we continue
[1:35:45] stolen water are sweet and bread eaten
[1:35:49] you remember
[1:35:51] so is the way of a woman that eateth and
[1:35:53] wipe of a mouth and say I have done
[1:35:56] because it's an adulterous woman so an
[1:35:58] adulterous woman can both give you drink
[1:36:02] and eat
[1:36:04] remember
[1:36:07] drink and bread
[1:36:11] amen glory to God he said stolen water
[1:36:16] are sweet and bread eating in water
[1:36:19] Secret in secret somebody's stealing
[1:36:21] something is Pleasant
[1:36:24] but
[1:36:26] the naive he knows not that the dead are
[1:36:30] dead
[1:36:31] so the house of that woman that give
[1:36:34] people Sweet Water
[1:36:36] sweet stolen water and bread eating in
[1:36:39] secret that house has dead people in it
[1:36:42] amen he knows not that the dead are dead
[1:36:46] amen and that her guest
[1:36:50] are in the water depth of water
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:55] so if you drink from this woman
[1:37:00] I can go even in the mark of the beast
[1:37:02] now in Revelation if you drink from this
[1:37:05] woman ever you eat from this woman you
[1:37:08] already enter in the depth of hell
[1:37:15] remember the system of Satan
[1:37:18] Satan uses a beast plus a
[1:37:23] come on brother we okay so far
[1:37:26] where are you taking me my brother
[1:37:29] when we spoke about Daniel too and
[1:37:33] Daniel 7
[1:37:34] we found out that Daniel 2 has five
[1:37:38] parts
[1:37:39] it's for Kingdom but five part
[1:37:42] of Branham says this that herein is
[1:37:45] revealed an exact account of future
[1:37:49] I feel history that was prophesied to
[1:37:52] come upon the Earth from the time of
[1:37:55] Daniel
[1:37:56] until Jesus would come and reign as the
[1:38:00] son of water so what the Brahman is
[1:38:03] saying that this Kingdom started from
[1:38:06] Daniel
[1:38:08] and they will go all the way to the
[1:38:12] coming of Jesus as the son of David
[1:38:18] amen we know that Jesus coming as a son
[1:38:21] of David he's coming to establish the
[1:38:24] millennium
[1:38:26] because Jesus came three times the first
[1:38:30] time he came alone
[1:38:31] to redeem his brother the second time
[1:38:34] it's what we call the Rapture he's
[1:38:37] coming to pick up his brother but the
[1:38:39] third time he's coming with his blood
[1:38:41] remember in Revelation 19 last Sunday
[1:38:44] when he was coming on the White Horse
[1:38:47] and the Army was following behind we and
[1:38:51] our maker we are coming back to destroy
[1:38:54] the kingdom of Satan that coming he's
[1:38:57] coming as the son of David
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:06] it is known as the time of the water
[1:39:11] he had within it four historical
[1:39:14] division which were known by the
[1:39:16] dominating Empire in each division the
[1:39:19] Babylonian we went through this the
[1:39:22] middle pigeon we went through this
[1:39:23] decoration we went through this and the
[1:39:25] water and we found out that the part of
[1:39:29] Rome the last part have is divided in
[1:39:33] half
[1:39:35] everybody here brother Branham said that
[1:39:38] the former Kingdom were typified as pure
[1:39:42] mineral
[1:39:43] Babylon was pure ago
[1:39:46] middle pigeon was pure silver
[1:39:49] amen the Greek Empire was pure brass
[1:39:53] this last empire was pure iron at the
[1:39:57] beginning
[1:39:59] pure iron only in the water
[1:40:02] but when he came to the feet he was the
[1:40:06] water
[1:40:07] of iron and water and mineral and salt
[1:40:11] just don't mix and produce cons uh uh
[1:40:15] constancy and strength
[1:40:17] this last empire the Roman will endure
[1:40:22] in its peculiar mixtape right up until
[1:40:26] Jesus what returns
[1:40:28] which return as the son of David this
[1:40:32] Roman Empire empire
[1:40:37] and great destructive force against
[1:40:39] water opposition
[1:40:41] Rome fell paid an imperial Rome fell
[1:40:45] Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron
[1:40:48] she crumbled she was wounded to death
[1:40:51] you remember that Rome could now could
[1:40:54] not now rule it's it's it was all over
[1:40:57] so that the world
[1:40:59] amen when the people saw Rome crumbling
[1:41:02] they thought the Empire is finished
[1:41:04] brother Branham says so thought to the
[1:41:07] world but how wrong the world was
[1:41:10] for that head remember that Sunday
[1:41:13] though wounded was not wounded
[1:41:16] anti-water
[1:41:18] brother Branham continues here he says
[1:41:20] people look at Rome
[1:41:23] they look at the nation of Italy
[1:41:26] and as they look they do not realize
[1:41:28] that room with her strict confines where
[1:41:32] the pope has a natural area as his
[1:41:35] domain is literally a nation within a
[1:41:40] nation
[1:41:40] and she has ambassadors and receive
[1:41:44] ambassadors Papa false Christian Rome
[1:41:48] she's even called The Eternal City her
[1:41:50] Blasphemous now controlled by religion
[1:41:54] even more heavily than when Pagan
[1:41:57] Imperial Rome controlled by pure iron or
[1:42:01] Force
[1:42:02] Rome took on a new lease of life
[1:42:07] when Constantine John church and state
[1:42:11] and back up the Union by force the
[1:42:14] spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the
[1:42:18] same spirit that now motivate first
[1:42:20] Christian you can see that is because
[1:42:24] you know that the fourth Empire never
[1:42:27] went out of existence it just changed in
[1:42:30] each other
[1:42:31] but the spirit remained the water
[1:42:34] so we explained to you last Sunday that
[1:42:37] when this Kingdom moved from Pure iron
[1:42:40] into a mixing of iron and Clay on the
[1:42:44] other vision of Daniel in Daniel chapter
[1:42:48] 7 it is interpreted as this Beast
[1:42:52] receiving a wound but they won't get
[1:42:54] healed so the Pagan Empire escape and
[1:42:59] enter in a religious Empire
[1:43:01] everybody okay if you notice on Daniel 7
[1:43:05] all we have here a beast
[1:43:09] the first one is a lion
[1:43:12] the second one is a bear amen the third
[1:43:15] one is a leopard and there is something
[1:43:18] very peculiar about the third one which
[1:43:21] is the Greek Empire brother Branham says
[1:43:24] this he says that the Christian age
[1:43:27] whose King was the most brilliant of our
[1:43:31] military leaders the world has ever
[1:43:34] known so it was fitly typified as the
[1:43:38] belly and the tie of water
[1:43:41] what brother Branham is saying here is
[1:43:44] at the beginning we got a lion
[1:43:48] we okay
[1:43:49] and after lion we see a bear
[1:43:52] amen after bear we see a military a
[1:43:58] leopard which is appearing with a great
[1:44:02] military chief
[1:44:06] everybody Kia
[1:44:08] everybody okay
[1:44:10] but all this Kingdom will gather
[1:44:13] together into one
[1:44:19] everybody okay because that last Kingdom
[1:44:22] according to Revelation 13 was a mixture
[1:44:26] of the Lion
[1:44:27] the bear and the leper all mixed
[1:44:30] together and when all of them are mixed
[1:44:33] together this is when the storm is
[1:44:36] coming down foreign
[1:44:50] never the shoulder
[1:44:52] never the time the Bible said that the
[1:44:56] stone hit the feet
[1:44:59] you can read your scripture home in
[1:45:02] other words that stone will destroy Rome
[1:45:06] not as an Empire
[1:45:09] that's right come on that's why their
[1:45:12] Kingdom that's why the disciple asked
[1:45:14] Jesus Christ are you now restoring the
[1:45:16] kingdom Jesus said not now because now
[1:45:19] I'm dealing with Roman Pagan he was the
[1:45:22] Roman that hung Jesus At The Cross if I
[1:45:25] destroyed them now they're going to
[1:45:27] escape
[1:45:27] they're going to go into a religious I
[1:45:30] have to wait until Rome get into his
[1:45:32] last stage in other words from this
[1:45:35] state here there is no more progression
[1:45:38] of Rome
[1:45:39] amen the word Rome is stuck
[1:45:44] Rome is put at the corner he cannot go
[1:45:48] back he cannot move anymore that's when
[1:45:52] the storm is coming
[1:45:54] to destroy not only the Roman Empire but
[1:45:58] the stone is destroying the Babylonian
[1:46:00] Empire they made operation Empire and
[1:46:03] then the Grecian Empire all of them
[1:46:06] mixed together in one Beast
[1:46:09] and that will happen when Jesus is
[1:46:13] coming as the son of who
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:19] what are you trying to say by the son of
[1:46:22] David
[1:46:23] the Bible says this
[1:46:25] first Samuel chapter 17 verse 36. David
[1:46:29] says that that servant shlew above the
[1:46:33] water
[1:46:36] let's go slowly let's go slowly let's go
[1:46:39] slowly
[1:46:41] this is David speaking
[1:46:45] anybody care
[1:46:46] are we okay
[1:46:49] are we okay did I lost somebody
[1:46:54] why did David have to first kill the
[1:46:57] lion
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:03] why was the first enemy of David he must
[1:47:07] be the lion and the next enemy of David
[1:47:10] must be water why
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:18] everybody okay
[1:47:20] everybody okay
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:22] [Laughter]
[1:47:24] that servant slew both water
[1:47:28] and the water this water
[1:47:32] fill his sin shall be as water
[1:47:34] because Goliath was a mighty military
[1:47:37] man
[1:47:39] [Applause]
[1:47:44] but here the first destruction is a lion
[1:47:48] the second destruction is a bear the
[1:47:51] third distraction must be a great
[1:47:53] military man so David look he said I
[1:47:56] already destroyed the first Kingdom I
[1:47:59] already destroyed the second Kingdom now
[1:48:02] it's a military manner
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:10] everybody okay that's why when Jesus
[1:48:13] comes as the son of water he can take
[1:48:17] all of them together and wife them in
[1:48:20] one time
[1:48:25] we okay
[1:48:32] Philistine will be as one of them
[1:48:38] scripture don't play with words
[1:48:42] everybody okay because that anointing on
[1:48:45] David is the anointing of the son of
[1:48:47] David
[1:48:49] amen when he comes as the son of David
[1:48:52] he can destroy the bear he can destroy
[1:48:55] the lion he can destroy also the
[1:48:57] military man which all three combine
[1:49:00] into the Roman Empire in other words
[1:49:02] David has the power to destroy the Roman
[1:49:04] Empire
[1:49:06] everybody okay
[1:49:09] seeing he has defiled the water
[1:49:12] off the water in Revelation 19 when
[1:49:16] Jesus is coming back the Bible said
[1:49:18] there is another water
[1:49:20] who was that army
[1:49:23] so when the Rome is trying to persecute
[1:49:26] the bread
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:31] let me continue my way
[1:49:33] David said the Lord that has delivered
[1:49:37] me out of the power of the water out of
[1:49:40] the power of daughter he will deliver me
[1:49:43] out of the hand of this water and he
[1:49:46] told Goliath I'm gonna cut your head off
[1:49:51] because the seed of the woman will
[1:49:54] always aim for the head of Satan
[1:49:58] everybody okay so far are we okay you
[1:50:01] want to go home let's continue glory to
[1:50:05] God last Sunday we found out that there
[1:50:08] is a trinity
[1:50:12] we okay in Satan
[1:50:15] amen we found out that Moses and Elijah
[1:50:18] when they finish their prophecy the
[1:50:21] Bible says that the Beast came and
[1:50:24] killed them
[1:50:26] amen and then in three days they revived
[1:50:30] and they went to heaven and after that
[1:50:32] what followed was the battle of
[1:50:34] Armageddon don't worry about it put it
[1:50:37] on the Shelf
[1:50:38] because it's a deep teaching okay and at
[1:50:42] the end of Armageddon because Armageddon
[1:50:45] is the third world war
[1:50:47] which is the third world the Bible said
[1:50:51] whoa whoa whoa those three words are War
[1:50:54] I'm gonna deal with it later on don't
[1:50:56] worry about it amen at the end of the
[1:50:59] Armageddon we found out that the Beast
[1:51:02] and the false prophet was taken together
[1:51:05] and put in the Lake of Fire but the
[1:51:07] devil Escape
[1:51:09] because when judgment hit the serpent
[1:51:11] the serpent I mean the old serpent
[1:51:14] became a snake but Satan left him
[1:51:18] God struck the Judgment by Satan Escape
[1:51:21] amen now in Revelation 20
[1:51:26] we found out last Sunday this is where
[1:51:28] we stop that here he there there is an
[1:51:32] angel coming down he shall lay the hold
[1:51:34] on the Dragon
[1:51:36] the old serpent which is the devil and
[1:51:40] Satan and banned him for what after a
[1:51:43] thousand years they will release against
[1:51:45] Satan that's when come the Battle of Gog
[1:51:48] and Magog don't worry about those
[1:51:50] battles leave them alone we will handle
[1:51:52] them later amen the Bible says in
[1:51:55] Revelation 20 verse 10 that the devil
[1:51:58] that deceived them was cast into the
[1:52:01] lake of fire and brimstone where the
[1:52:04] beasts and the first prophet are so now
[1:52:08] we got three elements
[1:52:11] wow
[1:52:13] this message is perfectly in line with
[1:52:16] the scripture we got a trinity
[1:52:20] of Satan
[1:52:22] that's why Trinity is of the devil
[1:52:25] [Applause]
[1:52:27] everybody here the Father the spirit and
[1:52:31] the son all three are
[1:52:34] one
[1:52:35] we okay
[1:52:37] the first one is the Devil Himself
[1:52:42] the second one is the false prophet
[1:52:46] we okay
[1:52:47] and the third one is the Beast
[1:52:53] what is going on my friend amen
[1:52:57] glory to God let's go slowly now in
[1:53:01] Revelation 16.
[1:53:03] put your seat belt we okay
[1:53:06] the Bible says and I saw three unclean

[1:57:03] Trinity
[1:57:05] give birth to a new Trinity
[1:57:08] uh-huh the water
[1:57:14] let's continue
[1:57:16] what
[1:57:18] he came out of it a trinity the Dragon
[1:57:22] where his body but I'm getting this
[1:57:24] their Beast and the water where is
[1:57:28] brother Brian I'm getting this
[1:57:30] this message is biblical
[1:57:33] a trinity a new one
[1:57:36] from when where this frog come out when
[1:57:41] did it brother Branham said the Frog are
[1:57:44] coming out
[1:57:45] but when are we gonna see the Frog
[1:57:48] come out
[1:57:50] in this earth
[1:57:52] brother Branham say notice they were
[1:57:56] there all the time
[1:57:58] so when the devil was working the devil
[1:58:01] had a frog
[1:58:03] the Beast also had the Frog
[1:58:06] and the first prophet had the Frog but
[1:58:10] they could not vomit those frogs until a
[1:58:13] certain time
[1:58:14] because the battle is not ready yet
[1:58:18] they have to wait also for the end time
[1:58:25] there was there all the time but it was
[1:58:29] not manifested
[1:58:31] until between the waters and the water
[1:58:35] stop there
[1:58:38] what is a vowel we went through this in
[1:58:41] a hotel
[1:58:42] Let me refresh you
[1:58:44] when God sent the message
[1:58:47] amen the message comes like a thunder
[1:58:51] we okay and the Thunder unfold and
[1:58:55] released the message of God
[1:58:57] we okay and the messenger come and he
[1:59:00] catches the inspiration of the Thunder
[1:59:03] and the messenger goes and preached that
[1:59:07] message or he brought the trumpet
[1:59:11] everybody okay when he blows the trumpet
[1:59:15] the elect of God of that time will heal
[1:59:18] the trumpet and they will come and
[1:59:21] receive the word of God
[1:59:23] everybody okay so some people will
[1:59:26] reject that trumpet
[1:59:28] and when God will finish receiving all
[1:59:31] his elect
[1:59:33] you following me amen he take them away
[1:59:36] and God brings judgment which is called
[1:59:40] The Vow everybody okay
[1:59:42] so this far is not the first one
[1:59:48] it is not the second vowel it is between
[1:59:51] the
[1:59:52] and the water
[1:59:54] so we got seven changes
[1:59:57] power preaching
[1:59:59] after Paul the first vowel
[2:00:02] and when you speak up after I reduce the
[2:00:05] second file more to pick up after
[2:00:07] Mountain the third verse Columbus pickup
[2:00:11] after Columbus the fourth one loot the
[2:00:14] pickup after Luther
[2:00:15] the fever then Wesley pickup
[2:00:20] you okay now afterwards let the water
[2:00:23] so the seven messenger have to come
[2:00:26] we okay now and when he pick up after
[2:00:29] his message then comes the water so in
[2:00:33] between Wesley
[2:00:36] and the pouring off of the rejection of
[2:00:39] brother Branham that's in between that
[2:00:42] time that's when the Frog will appear in
[2:00:45] other words the Frog will appear in the
[2:00:48] edge of laodicea
[2:00:51] and there will appear at the end time
[2:00:54] before the vowel is dropped
[2:00:59] did I lose anybody
[2:01:01] why are they appearing only at the end
[2:01:05] time because brother Branham say all
[2:01:07] this time the Frog were there but they
[2:01:09] were hiding but why do they come up only
[2:01:12] allow these such a changes
[2:01:15] brother Branham says this
[2:01:17] for in this what the problem say but it
[2:01:20] was manifested
[2:01:22] he was not manifested until between the
[2:01:25] sixth and the seventh hour just before
[2:01:27] the water
[2:01:31] everybody here
[2:01:34] so something was hidden
[2:01:37] that we did not know
[2:01:38] [Applause]
[2:01:41] but here so God pushed the devil to
[2:01:45] vomit everything that he has
[2:01:49] but here when he vomited he knew brother
[2:01:53] Branham is there now when brother
[2:01:56] Branham look at that
[2:01:58] wow
[2:01:59] he get the knowledge of what it is
[2:02:02] and now he have to break this hill to
[2:02:05] explain you what the devil is doing
[2:02:08] are we okay you don't play with the
[2:02:11] opening of the field
[2:02:13] because if the seals are not open you
[2:02:15] won't understand it
[2:02:17] but the bottom says this he said he
[2:02:20] wants be dressed before the seals open
[2:02:22] to the water
[2:02:25] because they still have to explain you
[2:02:27] what is going on Amen for in the message
[2:02:30] of the Seven Angels the water mysteries
[2:02:33] of God
[2:02:35] so the devil gotta pull everything he
[2:02:38] has God have to go in the back of the
[2:02:41] devil and beat him
[2:02:42] vomit everything
[2:02:44] quickly because I must open the seals
[2:02:47] pour everything you have
[2:02:49] when he finished he said now with the
[2:02:51] American Branham unfold him to my
[2:02:54] children
[2:02:55] let my children know how to trust him in
[2:02:58] every aspect
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:05] all these teen Italian friends and false
[2:03:08] baptism and everything wants to be water
[2:03:11] main man God help us see what is
[2:03:14] truthful
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:17] everybody okay so now we got a trinity
[2:03:21] and another Trinity this one is
[2:03:24] recruiting people for the fight this one
[2:03:27] also is still there we're dealing with
[2:03:30] two trinities now
[2:03:31] what are you trying to say Pastor glory
[2:03:35] to God but I'm saying he is himself a
[2:03:39] trinity
[2:03:40] that is what he's made up of he writes
[2:03:45] in a trinity remember all three powers
[2:03:47] has to command into one the bear the
[2:03:51] lion and then the leopard all of them
[2:03:53] make one they first sealed the second
[2:03:56] seal the third seal all three still make
[2:03:58] he always work with three
[2:04:01] okay his power is in a trinity his crown
[2:04:06] is in a trinity his horse is in a
[2:04:09] trinity that is what he is a trinity a
[2:04:12] power of Trinity a crown of Trinity a
[2:04:15] horse of Trinity that is of offices a
[2:04:19] four again the fourth one
[2:04:21] three stages of his water
[2:04:24] makes him walk one
[2:04:26] certain incarnate
[2:04:29] three stages the Antichrist
[2:04:33] then first prophet then water damn tree
[2:04:37] tapping now there is three tabs and that
[2:04:40] makes him God makes himself not to in
[2:04:45] water water and water and water where
[2:04:49] did Brother Adam get this
[2:04:51] you remember your Tabernacle
[2:04:53] makes a Christian a water Son of God by
[2:04:57] the word of God and this true power
[2:04:59] makes him air devil and there he is
[2:05:03] water blood and spirit which is of god
[2:05:04] that is politics religion and Demon
[2:05:07] power mixed together makes him water the
[2:05:10] devil what are you trying to say pastor
[2:05:14] this is where I'm heading
[2:05:16] you ready brother Barnum said he could
[2:05:20] not be an antichrist only in spirit then
[2:05:23] he became an antichrist and that Spirit
[2:05:26] took a man that thought a teacher the
[2:05:30] same thing that that Antichrist Spirit
[2:05:32] was doing and then he became a false
[2:05:35] prophet to the Antichrist Spirit now
[2:05:38] finally he becomes a beast so brother
[2:05:41] Branham say when he start he's going to
[2:05:44] start as the devil which we call him the
[2:05:47] Antichrist
[2:05:49] after this Antichrist he will move into
[2:05:52] a false prophet after false prophet then
[2:05:55] he will become the Beast let's go slowly
[2:05:58] brother random say as certain Trinity
[2:06:01] lays like that Satan all the time Satan
[2:06:05] Antichrist Spirit Antichrist Spirit
[2:06:07] incarnate then he becomes a false
[2:06:10] prophet and then he becomes a beast not
[2:06:13] a demon the Beast is not a demon that
[2:06:16] was in that Antichrist but when Satan
[2:06:19] himself is kicked out
[2:06:21] he comes down and take over the place
[2:06:24] where the demon was the devil then the
[2:06:27] devil is Incarnate in a man it's just
[2:06:30] water preparing it what are you talking
[2:06:32] about when Satan is in a spirit realm he
[2:06:37] is the devil
[2:06:39] you follow me follow me very careful
[2:06:41] when Satan begin to use a human heart
[2:06:47] you following me you're following me he
[2:06:50] becomes the false prophet
[2:06:53] amen but when Satan himself entered that
[2:06:58] human being
[2:06:59] now that human being is the Beast
[2:07:05] let me go slowly we have a human being
[2:07:09] that human being at the beginning
[2:07:12] he only have the anointing of the
[2:07:16] Antichrist on him
[2:07:18] he is an antichrist
[2:07:20] amen when he moved from here that person
[2:07:24] will now give his heart
[2:07:28] to the Antichrist spirit
[2:07:30] amen the spirit will incarnate him
[2:07:35] but here here now he becomes a false
[2:07:39] prophet
[2:07:41] remember your serpent amen when he comes
[2:07:45] the first prophet the the first prophet
[2:07:48] the third stage it is not going to be an
[2:07:51] anointing anymore it is going to be said
[2:07:54] to himself
[2:07:56] baptizing that person with the fullness
[2:07:59] of Satan badly
[2:08:05] open your bubble
[2:08:14] I'm sorry buddy this is a juicy LongHorn
[2:08:17] steak
[2:08:20] let's go to Luke chapter six
[2:08:26] if I can trace this quickly then we get
[2:08:28] where we're going
[2:08:30] to Luke chapter six if you dare you can
[2:08:32] say Amen
[2:08:33] what I'm doing right now if you go back
[2:08:35] you put the the first seal the second
[2:08:37] seal the Churchill you will be sitting
[2:08:40] just laughing
[2:08:41] what people were saying oh I can't read
[2:08:43] the seal I don't understand now go back
[2:08:45] and read the sale
[2:08:47] Luke chapter six
[2:08:49] if you dare you can say amen amen Luke
[2:08:52] chapter 6 verse 13. everybody okay
[2:08:56] and when he was there he called to him
[2:08:58] his disciple and one of n of them he
[2:09:02] chose how many who was choosing the
[2:09:04] disciple
[2:09:06] glory to God whom also he named apostle
[2:09:10] verse 14 sermon who also he named Peter
[2:09:13] Andrew his brother James and John Philip
[2:09:17] and bartolome Matthew and Thomas James
[2:09:20] the son of our fears and someone called
[2:09:22] Zealot and Judah the brother of James
[2:09:25] and Judas Iscariot which also was a
[2:09:29] traitor who chose Judas
[2:09:34] when they picked Judah was Judah bad
[2:09:38] he was a good boy
[2:09:40] we okay
[2:09:41] praise God open John chapter 6.
[2:09:49] now right here according to Luke
[2:09:52] Judah is a good boy
[2:09:56] he was chosen by Christ
[2:10:00] anybody okay I'm showing you the three
[2:10:02] steps of the Antichrist
[2:10:05] okay
[2:10:07] John chapter six if you dare you can say
[2:10:09] amen amen job to verse 64.
[2:10:12] glory to God
[2:10:15] if you dare you can say amen amen
[2:10:19] but there are some of you
[2:10:22] that believe not
[2:10:23] so the good boy was preaching the gospel
[2:10:26] but he doesn't believe the message
[2:10:27] himself
[2:10:31] he was casting out devils
[2:10:34] but he himself and the message they were
[2:10:36] not one the message that he was
[2:10:39] preaching and he himself they were not
[2:10:41] one but all along he can preach the
[2:10:43] gospel
[2:10:44] oh my God
[2:10:50] push your brakes man
[2:10:52] everybody okay but there are some of you
[2:10:55] that believe not
[2:10:57] for Jesus knew from the beginning
[2:11:02] who dare where that believe not and who
[2:11:06] should water betray him so even when
[2:11:08] he's choosing Judas he knew that Judas
[2:11:12] will betray him
[2:11:13] and yet he taught you that to go preach
[2:11:16] the gospel and when Judah went Judah was
[2:11:19] performing miracle
[2:11:21] I'm going slowly so I can shake you off
[2:11:24] completely
[2:11:26] so somebody being in this message
[2:11:28] doesn't mean anything
[2:11:30] we must watch you what you're doing
[2:11:34] everybody okay
[2:11:36] jump down to verse 70.
[2:11:39] Jesus answer
[2:11:41] have I not chose you 12 remember look
[2:11:45] and one of you is a what
[2:11:48] amen who chose the devil
[2:11:51] [Music]
[2:11:52] Judah is now decoded as the devil this
[2:11:56] is that safe for the Lord it is Jesus
[2:11:59] Christ himself
[2:12:00] verse 71 he spoke of Judas he's carried
[2:12:05] the son of someone for he he was that
[2:12:08] should betray him being one of the
[2:12:10] waters so Judas at the beginning is a
[2:12:14] good boy but yet it's a devil
[2:12:18] everybody okay but the wings of the son
[2:12:22] of man
[2:12:23] are controlling the devil Jesus is still
[2:12:27] in his ministry Jesus is powerful Judas
[2:12:31] cannot do anything
[2:12:32] Judas can only obey him obey him obey
[2:12:36] him because Jesus is still under his
[2:12:39] ministry his ministry is not finished
[2:12:40] yet
[2:12:41] as long as the wing of the eagle are
[2:12:44] flapping Judas is powerful he's
[2:12:46] powerless
[2:12:48] everybody with me
[2:12:50] glory to God
[2:12:53] go to John chapter 13.
[2:13:03] everybody okay
[2:13:05] everybody okay
[2:13:07] let's go to John chapter 13.
[2:13:09] amen now the wings of the ego are about
[2:13:13] to be plucked off
[2:13:17] the power of Jesus is going to decrease
[2:13:19] now because he finished his ministry
[2:13:21] almost
[2:13:22] verse one you there
[2:13:24] now before the Feast of the past of I'm

[2:13:39] [Laughter]
[2:13:42] your job just just drop it it's not me
[2:13:44] my friend amen now before the Feast of
[2:13:48] the Passover when Jesus knew watch
[2:13:51] carefully
[2:13:52] that is our was calm that he should
[2:13:56] water now the wings of the ego are going
[2:13:59] to be plucked off
[2:14:00] we okay that is ours should be that he
[2:14:04] should depart out of this world to the
[2:14:06] father having love his own which were in
[2:14:10] the world he loved them to the water
[2:14:12] what carefully first too and suffer
[2:14:16] being water and dude
[2:14:20] that anointing now is coming
[2:14:22] to Judah because Jesus is about to go
[2:14:25] now the door begin to open to the
[2:14:28] Antichrist the Antichrist the devil
[2:14:31] begin to come toward Judah because Judah
[2:14:33] by Nature he is a devil the wings of the
[2:14:36] ego will were
[2:14:38] blocking him now the anointing is coming
[2:14:40] now the devil when the anointing comes
[2:14:43] first he just take the heart
[2:14:46] remember when he comes first watch your
[2:14:49] preacher he only take the heart
[2:14:51] everybody okay

[2:15:08] the devil has been put in the heart of
[2:15:10] Judah is coyote someone's son to the
[2:15:13] water so now that anointing of the
[2:15:16] Antichrist is now in the heart of Judah
[2:15:20] now Judah who was working for Jesus
[2:15:23] Christ now already turned his heart
[2:15:25] against Jesus Christ to be healed to
[2:15:27] betray him
[2:15:28] amen but the devil is not inside Judah

[2:15:35] everybody okay
[2:15:36] everybody okay so Judah moved from here

[2:16:12] believe that I am he
[2:16:14] everybody okay
[2:16:16] verily I say unto you he that receiveth
[2:16:19] whomsoever Ascend receiveth me job to
[2:16:22] verse 21 when Jesus has that say he was
[2:16:26] troubled in his spirit and testify and
[2:16:28] say verily verily I say unto you that
[2:16:31] one of you shall betray me
[2:16:34] everybody okay then the disciple looked
[2:16:37] to one another doubting of whom he spoke
[2:16:39] and when they were and where and now
[2:16:42] there was
[2:16:44] there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of
[2:16:47] the disciples whom Jesus what love you
[2:16:50] know that disciple right his name was
[2:16:52] who who wrote the Book of Revelation who
[2:16:55] have the answer to that
[2:16:59] we okay
[2:17:00] job to verse 24 Psalm Peter therefore
[2:17:04] reckon beckon to him that he should ask
[2:17:07] who should be of whom he spoke
[2:17:10] then he then lying on Jesus breast said
[2:17:14] to him
[2:17:15] Lord who is it Jesus said one of you
[2:17:18] will betray me someone look he say has
[2:17:20] seen the connection between Jesus and
[2:17:22] John
[2:17:23] I know if you really want to know the
[2:17:25] secret
[2:17:26] you must go to John
[2:17:28] because John is a type of the Bride the
[2:17:31] bride can lay on your bosom and you are
[2:17:34] happy
[2:17:36] everybody okay so Peter beckon he say
[2:17:40] s uh John turn around he say
[2:17:43] who is it father
[2:17:45] everybody okay you love this scripture
[2:17:48] watch what happened
[2:17:51] the first 26 Jesus answer he it is to
[2:17:55] whom I shall give what
[2:17:57] when I deep it and when he had dipped
[2:18:01] the soap
[2:18:02] he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of
[2:18:05] who Simon verse 27 and after the shop
[2:18:09] what happened
[2:18:11] Satan did water can you say louder set
[2:18:14] and did what now he was not just a
[2:18:17] thought now the devil entered into Judah
[2:18:21] now Judah became the Beast
[2:18:27] everybody okay so first he starts as an
[2:18:30] antichrist then he gets a false prophet
[2:18:33] then after the first prophet he said
[2:18:35] what
[2:18:36] and the devil enter Satan enter into him
[2:18:39] then said Jesus to him that you do do it
[2:18:43] to how quickly
[2:18:45] job to go to Luke chapter 22 then I'm
[2:18:48] gonna run quick
[2:18:50] oh God
[2:18:53] Abraham dropped these things quickly he
[2:18:56] didn't have time
[2:18:58] so now we know we need to take time to
[2:19:00] make it clear
[2:19:02] so the bride is going to be clear Luke
[2:19:04] chapter 22 go to verse 1.
[2:19:07] now the Feast of the unleavened bread
[2:19:09] June 9 which is called the Passover and
[2:19:13] the chief priests and described sought
[2:19:15] how they might kill him
[2:19:16] for they feel the people you there
[2:19:20] Dan who
[2:19:21] entered who Satan Satan into who Judah
[2:19:25] everybody okay
[2:19:27] everybody okay that's why
[2:19:31] brother Branham says this that Judas
[2:19:34] Iscariot was the son of Satan
[2:19:38] the Son of Perdition he was a devil
[2:19:42] manifested in flesh
[2:19:46] not at the beginning
[2:19:48] but he have to go through the stages
[2:19:50] the Bible said he was the Bible say he
[2:19:54] was born the son of what brother Brahman
[2:19:57] said that you that Spirit came back as a
[2:20:00] rather on the White's horse
[2:20:02] so when Jesus died on the cross Judas
[2:20:06] also went and hanged himself so Jesus
[2:20:09] releasing the Holy Ghost Judas also
[2:20:12] releasing Satan
[2:20:16] and both of them come in the church
[2:20:21] the beast at the beginning and the Beast
[2:20:24] said the same
[2:20:25] he was white so close to the wheel just
[2:20:28] as Judah was so close to Jesus a crown
[2:20:32] was given to him that Spirit was now in
[2:20:35] the leader of the nicolaitan system and
[2:20:37] he was a triple crown Pope who sat as
[2:20:40] God in his Temple calling himself Vicar
[2:20:43] of Christ
[2:20:44] if Vicar of Christ means instead of
[2:20:46] Christ or in the place or on behalf of
[2:20:50] God then the pope was calling himself
[2:20:52] the Holy Ghost and deposing their Holy
[2:20:55] Spirit acting for that was judah's
[2:20:58] spirit in him doing that
[2:21:03] amen so when you come to the churches
[2:21:07] the first plus the second plus the third
[2:21:10] give you what but remember that in this
[2:21:14] age call the pergamas we found out that
[2:21:18] the Antichrist was given a crown
[2:21:20] brother Branham says this he said when
[2:21:23] the neglected Spirit the Antichrist is
[2:21:26] finally finally he's incarnated in man
[2:21:29] that is what he received a human heart
[2:21:32] when he start off he was just a
[2:21:34] nicolating spirit in the church he's a
[2:21:37] spirit you can cry on a spirit but 300
[2:21:39] years later he became and then they
[2:21:42] crowned him he had a crown to start with
[2:21:45] but he got a grant he had no crime to
[2:21:47] start with but he got a crime when that
[2:21:50] Spirit became water incarnate he become
[2:21:53] a man the neglect and Doctrine become a
[2:21:56] man then they could do water what are
[2:21:59] you trying to say brother Stephen after
[2:22:01] a while he was given a crown because you
[2:22:05] can't put a crown on the spirit head
[2:22:07] this Spirit becomes incarnated in the
[2:22:10] second work of his dispensation of his
[2:22:13] Mystic the second word he become Quran a
[2:22:16] weapon false prophet then he's working
[2:22:18] for the water thanks I Christ Spirit
[2:22:20] everybody clears so far why was Satan
[2:22:24] incarnate only in the age of Perkins
[2:22:29] I'm good in time but the Bible says this
[2:22:33] to the angel of the church in pergamos
[2:22:36] write these things say he which had a
[2:22:38] what
[2:22:39] with water images
[2:22:43] what are you writing I know that work
[2:22:46] that dwells even where
[2:22:52] so when they say in the churches that
[2:22:55] pagamas have the seat of Satan because
[2:22:58] the pope is there
[2:23:02] and that hold is fast my name and has
[2:23:05] not denied my faith even those days
[2:23:07] where in antipast was my faithful martyr
[2:23:10] who was slain among you were Satan
[2:23:13] dwelleth how can Satan dwell in
[2:23:16] paragamos
[2:23:17] brother random say where did Babylon
[2:23:20] move from from Babylon up to pergamus
[2:23:23] Satan shifted his word see I wish I
[2:23:26] could go through all the revelation
[2:23:31] where are you going brother Stephen but
[2:23:34] how did pergamos become the seat of
[2:23:36] Satan if Babylon was the seat
[2:23:40] we Okay we okay
[2:23:44] the answer again is in history when
[2:23:47] Babylon fell to the middle Persian the
[2:23:50] priest king atalus fled the city and
[2:23:52] went to pergamas with his priests and
[2:23:54] sacred Mysteries there he set up his
[2:23:58] kingdom outside of the Roman Empire and
[2:24:01] traveled under the care of the devil a
[2:24:03] succession of priest king follow atalus
[2:24:06] until the reign of fatalists third who
[2:24:09] for when for reason known only in the
[2:24:12] sovereignty of God he will live the
[2:24:13] kingdom to who so when this man came
[2:24:17] there he established Babylon in
[2:24:19] peregamus and Rome didn't have any
[2:24:22] control of it for some reason after a
[2:24:24] while a king Rose and took the entire
[2:24:27] Kingdom and went to Rome and said Rome
[2:24:30] take the kingdom
[2:24:34] everybody okay amen and Julius Caesar
[2:24:37] then took buff the kingdom physically
[2:24:39] and spiritually for he became the
[2:24:42] pontiff Maximus of the babylonious
[2:24:45] religion and was there for what the
[2:24:48] title begin to go from Emperor to
[2:24:50] Emperor until Maximus III refused the
[2:24:53] title amen then the pope took the
[2:24:57] headship of the emperor
[2:24:59] rejected and today he's still the what
[2:25:01] so he moved from Babylon to pergamos
[2:25:04] pergamos the church pick it up
[2:25:07] what are you trying to say brother
[2:25:09] Stephen amen
[2:25:11] let me skip this for the for the sake of
[2:25:14] time after the Pope everybody okay
[2:25:18] after the devil is incarnated into a man
[2:25:22] everybody okay after the devil become
[2:25:26] incarnated into a man what follows his
[2:25:29] water
[2:25:31] the Bible says in the age of tatarian
[2:25:33] the next age
[2:25:35] we okay now
[2:25:37] Satan pergamos the seat of Satan
[2:25:40] then tatarian who followed the seat of
[2:25:43] Satan gave the heart of a man to Lucifer
[2:25:47] when Lucifer entered he need a wife
[2:25:50] then tatarian produced the wife I'm
[2:25:52] going slowly
[2:25:55] not withstanding I have few things
[2:25:58] against thee because that suffers the
[2:26:00] woman who
[2:26:01] which calleth herself a water Prophet
[2:26:04] now we got the false prophet and the
[2:26:06] false prophetess remember the system of
[2:26:09] the Beast
[2:26:10] [Applause]
[2:26:12] everybody okay and to teach and seduce
[2:26:15] my servant to commit water fornication
[2:26:17] if it's a woman that woman must have
[2:26:19] daughters
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:24] yeah
[2:26:26] the beast at the end is a religious
[2:26:29] person first he is a what a false
[2:26:33] prophet in paragamas the seat of Satan
[2:26:35] then in tatarian a woman becomes a water
[2:26:39] prophetess but that woman must have
[2:26:41] water we okay now
[2:26:45] where are her daughters
[2:26:47] verse 22 I will cast her in the bed and
[2:26:51] then that commit adultery remember she's
[2:26:53] a bad woman with her into the Great
[2:26:56] Tribulation except that repent for their
[2:26:58] deed and I will kill her what with water
[2:27:01] so that woman have children
[2:27:03] so now we can trace that number one he
[2:27:07] entered pergamos in a man called the
[2:27:09] pope he become the false prophet then
[2:27:12] entertainment following that he get into
[2:27:15] a woman and that woman get daughters
[2:27:20] the beast at the end did I lose anybody
[2:27:23] where are you going
[2:27:24] you know her in the Bible Jezebel she
[2:27:27] was the wife of Ahab here is the woman
[2:27:31] the church Jezebel the wife of the false
[2:27:34] prophet which is supposed to be the
[2:27:36] genuine prophet of God the Pope the
[2:27:40] genuine prophet and his wife who Jezebel
[2:27:42] everybody okay so we found out that when
[2:27:45] the church age started Judas took his
[2:27:48] spirit and poured that in the church
[2:27:51] and the spirit begin to work at the
[2:27:54] first church and the second church it
[2:27:56] was just an anointing on the third
[2:27:59] Church ages called pagamas amen one day
[2:28:02] when Babylon shifted naturally from
[2:28:06] Babylon into pergamas then the devil
[2:28:09] came and entered the Pope but the pope
[2:28:12] must be connected with a woman then the
[2:28:14] tatarian produced Jezebel and Jezebel
[2:28:17] have children now we begin to rather
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:22] everybody okay amen where are you going
[2:28:25] I'm gonna skip some of this thing
[2:28:28] let me go this way any moral woman is
[2:28:32] the lowest things that can be thought of
[2:28:34] in the Earth
[2:28:35] excuse this young lady she's nothing but
[2:28:38] a human garbage can
[2:28:40] which woman
[2:28:42] not a woman but anymore
[2:28:45] listen to marriage and divorce good amen
[2:28:48] and not a woman but a woman
[2:28:51] that's all she is and immoral woman is a
[2:28:54] human sexual garbage can in a pollution
[2:28:57] where filthy dirty ornery Lord and Phil
[2:29:01] fees response with who that's why you
[2:29:04] hear she committed fornication she
[2:29:06] committed fornication she committed
[2:29:07] fornication everybody okay but the
[2:29:10] problem says this here he said I'm
[2:29:12] talking of an immoral now not to you
[2:29:16] sisters
[2:29:18] so when you're listening to marriage and
[2:29:20] divorce take yourself off the picture
[2:29:22] Amen brother Branham is not talking
[2:29:24] about you he's talking about any moral
[2:29:27] woman
[2:29:29] but the mother was making the women feel
[2:29:32] bad in marriage and divorce
[2:29:35] you need to know what you're talking
[2:29:37] about amen any more woman is the best
[2:29:41] bet
[2:29:42] the devil ever had she's worse than all
[2:29:46] the bad rooms that were ever most she
[2:29:49] can send more water
[2:29:51] than all the water that's why when the
[2:29:54] Antichrist cannot work with a false
[2:29:57] prophet alone he must combine any moral
[2:30:00] woman because the more woman knows in
[2:30:03] proverb how to kill Souls
[2:30:06] she's calling the people she said come
[2:30:07] here she knows how to send more Soul To
[2:30:10] Hell than a man does

[2:36:25] everybody okay let's continue we okay
[2:36:28] verse two you there amen glory to God
[2:36:32] watch what happened
[2:36:34] this Beast
[2:36:35] which I saw was like a leper we
[2:36:38] understand this amen and his feet were
[2:36:41] as the bear and his mother's the lion
[2:36:43] watch carefully
[2:36:45] you there the dragon gave him what power
[2:36:52] so this Beast is operating under which
[2:36:55] power
[2:36:56] the power of Satan
[2:36:59] amen he gave him his power Karma and he
[2:37:03] gave him water we know the seat of Satan
[2:37:06] was in Perkins that's why the Bible said
[2:37:08] in speed in pergamos there is a seat of
[2:37:11] Satan because spiritually speaking the
[2:37:14] devil gave the seat in peregamos you
[2:37:17] understand now every picture in every
[2:37:20] scripture now is blinding he gave him
[2:37:22] his seat and he gave him water great
[2:37:25] Authority so if this Beast is
[2:37:28] this he's talking under the power of
[2:37:31] Satan
[2:37:32] and as a man in the place of Satan and
[2:37:36] with the authority of Satan
[2:37:42] as the serpent is hurting to evil the
[2:37:46] serpent is talking under the power of
[2:37:48] Satan with the authority of Satan and
[2:37:52] he's stalking us Satan that's why the

[2:39:36] this is just a speaker
[2:39:41] everybody okay
[2:39:42] everybody okay
[2:39:44] brother Brandon take this now we found

[2:40:00] and he come out as a beast on the earth
[2:40:03] another Beast coming up if we have a
[2:40:06] beast we have a beast according to our
[2:40:09] equation whenever you have a beast it is
[2:40:12] followed by a woman
[2:40:16] do you remember the question certain
[2:40:19] system is Beast plus a woman so we must
[2:40:22] see the women
[2:40:26] are you ready amen you ready brother
[2:40:28] Branham says this he says America is
[2:40:32] number 13.
[2:40:36] he was born with 13 colonies and had a
[2:40:39] flag with 13 star 13 strap and even
[2:40:43] appear in Revelation and America has
[2:40:47] always been a what woman represented on
[2:40:50] our coins even the Indian head on a
[2:40:53] penny is a woman profile we know that we
[2:40:56] know history of Faith the Liberty Bell
[2:40:59] and everything and even the Statue of
[2:41:01] Liberty everything is the water woman
[2:41:04] woman is number one so America himself
[2:41:08] is a woman
[2:41:12] foreign
[2:41:16] let's see this Beast here let's go to
[2:41:18] revelation 17.
[2:41:24] I'm trying to go quick my friend
[2:41:27] you ready
[2:41:29] amen verse one and there
[2:41:32] come one of the seven angels with your
[2:41:35] Marion brother
[2:41:36] which had the seven vowels and talk with
[2:41:39] me saying to me come here I will show
[2:41:42] you the Judgment of the Great Wall oh
[2:41:45] that sits upon many what Waters
[2:41:47] according to one you supposed to see a
[2:41:51] woman you're supposed to see water and a
[2:41:53] woman sitting on water okay according to
[2:41:56] first one that's what we're supposed to
[2:41:58] see but let's see
[2:42:01] job two verse two with whom the kingdom
[2:42:05] of the Earth has committed fornication
[2:42:07] and the inhabitant of the Earth has made
[2:42:10] drunk with the one of her water
[2:42:11] fornication everybody on verse 3 please
[2:42:15] so he carried me away in the spirit in
[2:42:17] the wilderness and I saw a what woman
[2:42:20] sit upon a Waters
[2:42:24] stop did you see that woman sitting on
[2:42:26] the on the water
[2:42:30] the woman instead is Seated on a beast
[2:42:34] everybody okay but the Bible says she's
[2:42:37] sitting on the water
[2:42:38] scripture don't play with wood before I
[2:42:41] go further let me remind you in
[2:42:44] Revelation 13 the Beast came from what
[2:42:47] so when you look at this Beast you will
[2:42:50] see the Beast sitting on water
[2:42:52] everybody okay this Beast here sits on
[2:42:55] water but the woman sit on the Beast we
[2:42:59] must make sure if this beast and that
[2:43:02] Beast are the same because from Heaven
[2:43:04] seven had how many horns the Beast is
[2:43:08] seven heads how many ounces if a woman
[2:43:10] is sitting really on the water that
[2:43:13] Beast must match this Beast let's
[2:43:15] evaluate or examine this Beast let's put
[2:43:18] our microscope
[2:43:21] We Ready glory to God my God it's a
[2:43:25] military airplane my friend
[2:43:27] we jump to verse 3. so he Carry Me Away
[2:43:29] in a spirit in the wilderness and I saw
[2:43:31] a woman that sit in a Scarlet Scarlet
[2:43:35] means what red
[2:43:37] but the dragon what was his color red
[2:43:39] let's stop a little bit there we already
[2:43:42] seen the color red
[2:43:44] let's continue Oh Glory to God a scarlet
[2:43:48] color Bed full of name of what that's
[2:43:52] for me having water seven heads
[2:43:55] Heaven what
[2:43:57] and how many horns so now we understand
[2:44:00] that when they say the woman is sitting
[2:44:03] on the water she's not really sitting on
[2:44:06] the water she's sitting upon the Beast
[2:44:08] that sits upon the Water
[2:44:11] everybody here now this Beast is joined
[2:44:15] with a woman
[2:44:23] Beast and the water
[2:44:25] Saturn is deadly now
[2:44:30] can I continue or you want to stop here
[2:44:33] continue
[2:44:34] I'm going to skip a lot of stuff now
[2:44:37] job to verse
[2:44:39] job to versa
[2:44:41] job to verse five and upon her forward
[2:44:45] was a name written mystery Babylon
[2:44:49] Babylon the water great so remember I
[2:44:52] told you at the beginning remember
[2:44:53] Babylon the great of Revelation 17. so
[2:44:55] Babylon the great is a woman
[2:44:58] she's a cage she's an immoral woman
[2:45:01] she's a garbage can of every unclean
[2:45:04] spirit because she's a harlot
[2:45:07] everybody here Babylon the great the
[2:45:10] mother of water remember that woman must
[2:45:13] have children
[2:45:16] and her children also are Hollows the
[2:45:19] system is clear because the serpent have
[2:45:22] to unite with Eve to destroy Adam the
[2:45:25] serpent the dragon get into the Beast
[2:45:28] and the Beast has to reunite with a
[2:45:31] woman
[2:45:32] To Go destroy the serpent have to use a
[2:45:35] beast and the Beast have to unite in a
[2:45:37] woman in order to destroy the beast at
[2:45:40] the beginning and the Beast at the end
[2:45:42] job to verse 6. and I saw the woman
[2:45:47] everybody see not the Beast the woman
[2:45:51] drunken with the blood remember the
[2:45:54] rumen of revelation of proverb now she
[2:45:57] was the one that was killing
[2:46:00] amen the woman is the Destroyer
[2:46:03] that's why she's drunk with the blood of
[2:46:07] the people because once Satan which the
[2:46:10] third level of a woman he began to kill
[2:46:13] everybody okay
[2:46:15] praise God drug with the blood of the
[2:46:17] sand and with the blood of the Martyr of
[2:46:20] Jesus and when I saw her I wonder with
[2:46:22] great admiration
[2:46:25] everybody here and the angels said to me
[2:46:28] why wherefore did you mother I will tell
[2:46:31] you the mystery of the water woman why
[2:46:34] you don't want the Mysteries
[2:46:37] the woman itself is a mystery
[2:46:40] for you to understand her you need a
[2:46:42] mystery a mystery decoder let's get down
[2:46:46] so I'm gonna head to the airport and the
[2:46:48] Beast that carrier which have seven
[2:46:50] horns and water
[2:46:52] watch carefully the Beast that you saw
[2:46:55] was
[2:46:56] and he's not an ascended out of the
[2:46:58] bottomless pit and goes to water
[2:47:01] where Judas come and they that dwell on
[2:47:04] the Earth shall wonder whose name were
[2:47:07] not written in the Book of Life from the
[2:47:09] foundation of the world when they behold
[2:47:12] the Beast which was and is not and is
[2:47:14] yet in other words it's a beast that
[2:47:16] appear and disappear and appear again
[2:47:18] and disappear and appear again and
[2:47:20] disappear what does he mean
[2:47:22] hold tight and I'm gonna head to the
[2:47:24] airport
[2:47:25] what does he mean brother Branham says
[2:47:27] this I got to skip this

[2:49:09] a beast rolling that is when Pagan Rome
[2:49:12] was converted to make water
[2:49:14] the pope is a spiritual King that is the
[2:49:18] reason he is what spiritual King claims
[2:49:21] to be water
[2:49:23] everybody okay

[2:55:19] on the mountain and as Sin does Water
[2:55:22] Seven Hills
[2:55:27] we okay brother Branham since one month
[2:55:30] and also
[2:55:34] everybody okay and the mountain of
[2:55:36] brother Branham have how many heels
[2:55:42] can I continue but in the Bible Babylon
[2:55:45] is a mountain with how many heels but
[2:55:49] there must be a name on the mountain
[2:55:55] okay
[2:55:56] I've seen those seventh year and if you
[2:55:59] want to see something there was seven
[2:56:01] Peak on the top of the mountain one
[2:56:04] mountain that ran several several miles
[2:56:07] the last Mountain before you go into the
[2:56:10] other country no more mountain after
[2:56:12] that there's no more mountain and he was
[2:56:15] running from east to west everybody okay
[2:56:18] the mountain set and it was snuck up on
[2:56:21] the top
[2:56:22] the first two were small Peaks
[2:56:27] slow down with me
[2:56:29] so you got one pick
[2:56:31] second pick and then who
[2:56:34] amen and then a large pick and then
[2:56:38] another water
[2:56:39] small pick so number three is big
[2:56:43] and then another small Peak and then
[2:56:45] what number five
[2:56:48] and then the water
[2:56:50] and then a great
[2:56:54] which is number
[2:56:56] three five and seven
[2:56:59] everybody okay and a small Pig than a
[2:57:02] great large large snow cap mountain and
[2:57:05] I said Lord I do not understand what
[2:57:08] that means
[2:57:10] we okay
[2:57:12] he said the Lord spoke to brother
[2:57:14] Branham he said how many pigs are there
[2:57:19] I said there is how many seven how many
[2:57:23] letters is in your name

[2:57:33] letters
[2:57:34] yeah
[2:57:37] b-r-a-n-h-a-m how many letters so God is
[2:57:41] telling brother Branham that the big
[2:57:44] mountain that you saw that I have seven
[2:57:46] here also have a name
[2:57:50] everybody okay amen
[2:57:53] is Branham
[2:58:00] why is God putting the name of brother
[2:58:03] Branham on Seven Hills while the Vatican
[2:58:07] City is also sitting on seven here with
[2:58:11] a name
[2:58:14] but here everybody here both of them
[2:58:17] have to meet at the end time
[2:58:19] [Music]
[2:58:21] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[2:58:24] far the peculiar of the name of brother
[2:58:27] Branham is the ham
[2:58:31] [Music]
[2:58:34] are we okay I know some of you are
[2:58:37] trembling
[2:58:38] but I'm gonna drop this my friend
[2:58:40] brother Branham said God has met Abraham
[2:58:44] and give him a name from Abram to water
[2:58:47] Abraham
[2:58:50] and water we already went through this
[2:58:53] he addresses them both by the water
[2:59:00] So when you say Sarah you are talking
[2:59:02] about a priesthood
[2:59:05] priesthood was not there because Abraham
[2:59:08] met Melchizedek
[2:59:18] which name
[2:59:21] h-e-m taking part of his name into water
[2:59:27] Abram h-a-m part of God's name
[2:59:32] because he wants to be also the father
[2:59:35] by seed to many water Nations so Abraham
[2:59:41] can I continue the ham
[2:59:45] means the father
[2:59:49] of many nations
[2:59:50] [Applause]
[2:59:53] can I continue can I continue amen
[2:59:56] cannot continue glory to God here was
[3:00:00] Abraham his name has been changed from
[3:00:03] Abraham to water Abraham which means
[3:00:06] water father of Nations and he could not
[3:00:09] have a baby
[3:00:12] as long as his name was water he has to
[3:00:17] be water thanks to Abraham Abraham for
[3:00:20] ham does mean the father of water
[3:00:23] Nations the father of water Nations
[3:00:26] what are you trying to say
[3:00:29] can I continue amen
[3:00:31] Abraham
[3:00:33] H.A.M give somebody the title of a
[3:00:37] father of many nations
[3:00:40] everybody here that's why when brother
[3:00:43] Branham went into the sixth dimension
[3:00:46] [Music]
[3:00:49] can I continue when he saw the people he
[3:00:53] asked God these Brahms
[3:00:56] [Music]
[3:00:57] because he was already the father of
[3:01:01] many nursing

[3:05:46] three outstanding pigs those three pigs
[3:05:49] are the water and the water and the
[3:05:52] water the first one was your first part
[3:05:55] of your ministry that's then the first
[3:05:57] part was pretty high you know the sun in
[3:06:00] the hand and then come the water
[3:06:03] the second pool
[3:06:06] I have had another about a few years
[3:06:09] just now the little Peak back like my
[3:06:11] Ministry was not yet then come the third
[3:06:14] one three is the number of water
[3:06:16] completion 10 and then five which is the
[3:06:19] number of water Grace Three we know
[3:06:21] Perfection he flipped them and seven is
[3:06:24] the number of water perfect which should
[3:06:26] be here chair and then completion which
[3:06:28] is the in six days yusha in the seventh
[3:06:33] day is the one the end of the week the
[3:06:35] water
[3:06:36] what are you trying to say I'm talking
[3:06:40] about the headship of Christ
[3:06:42] personally
[3:06:44] identify by the original water we have
[3:06:48] the devil
[3:06:52] everybody here we have the death the
[3:06:55] answer to the question of the devil
[3:06:57] where men Glory we have the answer to
[3:07:00] the devil question who is the answer
[3:07:03] class is risen and paid the person amen
[3:07:06] and he's rising up the head the devil
[3:07:09] can stand it
[3:07:10] the reason this ecumenical kingdom are
[3:07:14] setting up that's the reason they're all
[3:07:16] coming up to what they are doing now
[3:07:18] they're therefore that's the reason he's
[3:07:20] hollowing the way he is his wickedness
[3:07:22] his scheme has been watered you think
[3:07:25] I'm beside myself I'm not we got the
[3:07:28] answer the devil answer not me that
[3:07:31] liveth but who Christ is not my dear it
[3:07:35] is his water that's why when you have
[3:07:37] Vatican is preparing with Seven Hills
[3:07:40] God also has Seven Hills that's gonna
[3:07:43] match the Vatican amen so the seventh
[3:07:46] Hill and the Seven Hill and the all of
[3:07:48] them crashed together we got the devil
[3:07:51] and sir
[3:07:53] Hallelujah
[3:07:56] Oh Glory to God
[3:08:03] glory to God
[3:08:05] the Trinity of Satan and the two seven
[3:08:08] here no matter what the Vatican is doing
[3:08:11] God also blessed Seven Hills in America
[3:08:16] one mountain with seven people which
[3:08:19] include the three pools together
[3:08:22] amen and if you notice the pop which is
[3:08:27] and is and is yet to come if you notice
[3:08:30] the ministry of brother Branham it is
[3:08:32] and it's yet to come it is any chance
[3:08:34] you come if it goes up and it goes down
[3:08:36] it goes up and he goes up he's matching
[3:08:38] the Beast so if the Beast goes up we go
[3:08:41] up if he goes down we go down with him
[3:08:43] if he goes out we go up with him if he
[3:08:45] goes down we go down
[3:08:47] [Applause]
[3:08:52] glory to God oh my God oh God
[3:09:02] [Applause]
[3:09:06] why the problem saying
[3:09:08] brother random say it's practically that
[3:09:10] now you can't go to church and preach
[3:09:13] unless you have the fellowship card or
[3:09:14] some identification on person like
[3:09:17] ourselves we are going to be cut off for
[3:09:19] all of that that's exactly because we
[3:09:21] don't want we won't be able to do it it
[3:09:23] is tightening that when that time comes
[3:09:26] the Press come to a place that we are
[3:09:29] pressed out then watch what I'm fixing
[3:09:32] to tell you now watch water
[3:09:35] so as the Vatican is going up we also
[3:09:38] are growing
[3:09:40] here don't be afraid of seven here we
[3:09:44] have our Seven Hills we have a Ministry
[3:09:48] that have the triples that Ministry can
[3:09:51] match the devil everywhere if the three
[3:09:53] four do Miracle we can still do miracle
[3:09:56] if they prophesy we have prophecy but
[3:09:59] they don't have the opening of the word
[3:10:01] which we have which is the temple we got
[3:10:05] the answer to certain questions
[3:10:09] fear not little brother you are not
[3:10:11] alone we got the devil's effort let them
[3:10:15] do what they were doing let them do what
[3:10:18] they want to do we got the answer when
[3:10:21] the squeeze come watch the Deadpool
[3:10:25] We're Not Gonna Be coward we will be
[3:10:28] speaking the word there will be a
[3:10:30] demonstration that will show this world
[3:10:33] that's the bread of Jesus Christ was
[3:10:35] there because when I was born I got
[3:10:38] number 13 which is not the American
[3:10:40] number 13 but the Heavenly number 13.
[3:10:43] that's gonna match number eight to
[3:10:45] number one and when number eight the
[3:10:48] number one match with me I'm gonna
[3:10:49] manifest the Son of God glory to God
