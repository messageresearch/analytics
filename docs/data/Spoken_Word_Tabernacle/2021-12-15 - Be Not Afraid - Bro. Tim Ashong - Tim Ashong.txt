know it it goes back to the time where ruth coming out as a stranger and not knowing exactly where she's going but something in her leading her to move forward and you can just imagine the questions also he had you know asking naomi tell me about this land tell me about this asking boaz what it is to worship the father and all these things that were so strange to her because she was born in a heathen land but we have been called out into the same transition and we want to thank god for his grace to us amen this song is tell me more i haven't heard enough i want the lord to tell us more [Music] who is this milk this kid [Music] this king of jerusalem i am a gentile i need to know for sure i am a moabite i have worshiped foreign gods tell me more about this land this different civilization [Music] tell me of this city tell me up this land tell me of this people who worship the land tell me of this earth and it's generations for i'm a moabite sitting at the threshing floor oh you told me you told me i have three bodies but there is only only one of me you told me lord you told me i am eternal and with you in eternity i'll be yes i have been quickened my course he has changed and i am no longer a stranger but i'm a citizen of jerusalem though i'm a gentile i now have access to him yes i'm a gentile [Music] there's so much i need to know tell me all about this word about these dimensions and world for i'm a candidate of the supernatural world oh so tell me of this bread tell me of this wine tell me of this body that's broken for me tell me of this way and how to change dimensions to my theophany that's the positive of me you told me you told me i have three bodies but there is only only one of me you told me i am eternal and with you in eternity [Music] you

all things are possible lord i believe amen do you believe it tonight blessed be the name of the lord you're not clapping for me [Music] you're clapping for the king of kings the lord of lords amen blessed be the name of the lord wonderful wonderful singing and wonderful sister backing up over there amen amen we want to utilize all the resources that we have all the beautiful voices instead of them sitting there and praising the lord we can't even hear them we want to hear them amen amen worshiping and praising the living god amen and that was a wonderful song sister god richly bless you we greet you all again in the name of jesus christ we don't have visitors we got family members so all the family members that are here tonight god richly bless you i see one from canada god bless you my brother welcome welcome welcome welcome amen good to see you brother joe amen i didn't know that's a surprise but it's wonderful lord's willing we shake hands probably after church amen i'm not sure where some people are probably they caught up on the traffic but maybe they will make it you pray god this is the time there is traffic on 85 because of the the lights amen which we don't believe in those kind of christmas stuff amen but because it's traffic but by god's grace we're here tonight amen wonderful how many are still chewing on that melchizedek amen amen amen amen blessed be the name of the lord ruth have to come through the land of judah and she have to enter the only door that the moabite could enter into the congregation was through the door of judah amen because the scripture already said there is no more about that can be part of the congregation of israel so there is only one tribe that can override that power amen amen because judah have the scepter and the scepter have a power to override the law that's why esther could enter in the presence of the king regardless of what how many i mean the uh the risk that was there she faced death completely but when the stretch the scepter the scepter can overpower the law and get there so even though the law say no more about should be part of the congregation of israel but by entering judah that was the perfect entrance and not only the perfect interest but that's an entrance of melchizedek because over there you can get the kinship and the priesthood together amen amen blessed be the name of the lord my god wonderful thing keep opening up with this land of judah amen lord willing just remember the oncoming service the new year's eve and everything keep it in prayer as we continue to prepare and make sure everything will be a blessing for the kingdom of god tonight we have a surprise those that are online it's no longer a surprise because they have been seeing the title already but to us here it's a

god's grace the lord work everything in a miraculous way open the way so that he can be with us here amen i wish the whole church was here tonight because i know our brother's ministry amen amen that's a true elder who stood for the message of the hour and as an elder you know your pastor i always have to salute them and respect them because these are veterans in the kingdom of god amen amen he did a lot he worked his way up to come here to be an encouragement to us and we really really really really appreciate that and lord's willing if we tarry on this side of the heaven here on this side right here because we're on the first heaven down the road you will understand that if we tear it down here we will meet him more and more as he continued to travel in the u.s amen so i told him

you and we appreciate you thank you in jesus name we pray amen let's be seated for a moment greet you in the name of our lord jesus christ and we thank the lord for grace that has brought us together again i've been in the country for about six weeks now and i'm getting ready to go back to my country by this i thank god for making a way for me to be here i felt literal to pass here and say hello to you and just to encourage you to keep pressing on so i'm glad thank you brother stephen for the opportunity given to me and we love jesus christ we love his people we love his prophet we thank god for grace upon our lives it's a privilege we are privileged people we are blessed people to see the light of our day and i just want to encourage you to keep walking in the light as the prophet of god said children of the light keep walking in the light and watch a symbol unfold so we believe the prophet of god we don't worship the prophet of god but we believe in and we thank god for a prophet we thank god for a messenger that god sent to us hallelujah so we are still pressing on and by the gym yamiche wants me to greet you and a few places i've been in the country since i came in um i just came from arizona on monday from berlin peterson's place dog baker and they all asked me to greet the church and different places michigan ohio and things and that so we're happy and we love the lord and we love his people and he said where two or three will be gathered in his name he will be there in their midst so let's just read a little portion and then we encourage ourselves praise the lord jesus let's read this mor this evening hallelujah praise the lord we love jesus we love his people all right so let's read from detroit on me chapter 7 the book of moses and say some few things just to encourage ourselves right fifth book of moses deuteronomy chapter seven yeah yeah so we read from verse 17. if thou shalt say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them that shall not be afraid of them but shall we remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt amen the great temptations which the eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom that are afraid amen shall be seated while i read some few more verses from the bible so let's read joshua 1. let's read verse nine have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be doubt this me for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever that goeth hallelujah let's read one more scripture from the gospel of saint matthew the gospel of matthew you can get all through the scripture when god tells his children not to be afraid brother said god don't want us to fear god wants us to believe yes so matthew let's read verse 14 chapter 14 matthew chapter 14. let's read from verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out of fear but straightway jesus speak unto them say be of gucci it is i be not afraid may the lord bless the reading of his word amen so for this little time we just want to encourage ourselves with being unafraid amen the prophet of god said there is nothing out of cater god is behind every move and everything there might be things you don't understand and i don't understand and we don't understand but he understands so be not afraid you might be trying to find answer to this and you don't but be not afraid why because we are not here by chance and we are not here accidentally you are not here accidentally i'm not here accidentally and you are not even here accidentally for none unto god are all his ways we have been taught his creature that he knows every flea and every fly and we should remember that he pre-planned and pre-arrange our journey here on earth god bless you amen hallelujah amen isn't it wonderful there are things you don't understand of course you would not understand and i would not understand but we have a promise that when the morning comes we will understand the prophet said you know before it rains you know there's a rugged and rough skies and thundering enlightening and this he said but out of that comes life the rain comes and life comes in so you know god is great and his ways are past finding out amen and as i have said you know did that inform you the scripture tells us he predestinated yes and do that he predestinated he called and though that he called he justified and done that he has justified his glorifies so the works were finished before the foundation of the world and i said listen you are being here man being here listen you could not be born earlier than the day you were born you understand that your mother could not have given birth to you earlier than the time she gave back to you because that is the time god planned it and therefore you cannot even live here anytime you can live here on your own because you didn't bring yourself here somebody brought you here and he will see to it so be not afraid like i have said i have said to people since this pandemic broke and you know everybody living in fear because the world leaders are confused the doctors are confused the scientists are confused everybody is confused everybody is afraid there was a time [Music] people would run away thank god that he has brought us through do you know that a lot of people have died in this mandate but why are you doing that why have you know that amen are you there be not afraid you can't go out of here until god's purpose has been accomplished in your life you believe that that is what i believe because that is what the prophet taught [Music] hallelujah praise the lord i said you can't live here until god has finished with you and that settles it now i want to say this to you don't compare your life to anybody [Applause] because you cannot be anybody you just have to be who you are because that is the way god made you and that is how you will be you cannot be me and i cannot be you [Music] amen the bible says those who compare themselves to themselves are not wise are you following that are you following that so don't compare yourself to anybody the bible says soon through the flood sun through the fire sun through great sorrows sun through great fires but all through the blood so the one that plan you are coming here it is for purpose and until that purpose has been done there is nobody that can take you out of here [Applause] hallelujah listen we are made differently for different purposes the prophet of god said god can treat a man for 40 years and use him for five minutes five minutes and that is it it's finished hallelujah nothing can take you out of here hey listen even if you want to die you will not die do you know that there are people that try to kill themselves and they don't die so you can't go nowhere no matter how you desire to go you will not go until the one who brought you here says that go but until then settle yourself settle in your mind that i am not going anywhere so lord help me to do what you want me to do so the earlier you do it the better you get your peace [Applause] amen hallelujah [Music] so stop crying and do what you have to do stop complaining start memory stop worry [Music] stop that because it will never help you you remember one time david had problems his people were against him the people his brothers and they wanted to stone him said because of you they have taken our wives and then we begin to further and he was crying and the bible said but david encouraged himself he realized that crying will not solve the problem worry will not solve the problem complaints will not solve the problem he has to do something about it problem worry cry he doesn't solve problem and david encourage himself in the lord it's a lot should i go after them will i overtake them this yeah if you stop crying and you get up and you straighten yourself up and you make things right in your life and you quit you gather you overtake them and you redeem all [Applause] hallelujah hey be not afraid don't let fear rule your life the prophet of god said there are two elements two forces and two powers that controls every man every nation every bird every gang and that one is fear and the other is faith so what is controlling your life because you can say oh have faith oh you can but your action speaks louder your behavior your attitude the way you look at things the way you take things shows what is controlling your life hallelujah may the lord help us your behavior your actions it's just what is controlling your life brother branham said god does not want his children to fear he wants his children to believe him that's why i told the scriptures all from jesus he said be not afraid fear came in because of unbelief that's when adam said i am afraid because i heard your voice when did the voice of god begin to make you afraid that was not the first time god was coming to them god was the first prophet jehovah himself was the messenger that gave them the message so god has an order that in every age and at every time he sends a prophet the prophet may not be to your taste might not be to your test but he is a prophet hallelujah jesus said to the people your father has killed the prophet and you garnish the atoms why did they keep the prophets why did they destroy the prophet because they always thought the prophets were wrong there was not a prophet were wrong the bible said jeremiah isaiah was so asander the believers did that the church did that to him but he was a prophet hallelujah be not afraid there is nothing out of cater god is in control the creator the creator of the universe the god almighty the creator of the universe is in control over nature over everything that is happening today there is nothing out of cater so be not afraid he rules and erase he's above all he is the almighty god be not afraid biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear fear people always cared and that is of the devil be scared be brave don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing there is nothing to be afraid of god said be brave he told you be of good courage whether so ever that goes i will be there with you i will not leave you and i will not forsake you oh yes church he promised never to leave us so be not afraid he is the god that controls the universe he is the almighty god hallelujah be not afraid why because he said i will build my text and the gate of faith shall not prevail [Applause] the prophet said that means there will be the gate of faith there will be challenges there will be difficulties there will be trials there will be disappointment but they shall not prevail there will be sicknesses trouble here and there but they will not prevail i will build my church the church is built by jesus christ he is the author and the finisher of our faith therefore be not afraid [Applause] praise the name of the lord listening he predestinated us unto adoption of sons and daughters the work has already been finished so be not afraid what are you afraid of what why are you afraid what are you afraid of [Music] we have almighty god the almighty god the creator of the universe and we are his children our lives are hidden in christ [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah he is a sovereign god by his own counsel he proposed the plan of salvation the salvation of its own elect which he for knew he proposed the plan of the salvation of his own elect he proposed it the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit can fully execute the will of the father he is working on things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church this great creator savior god is faithfully working among his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own his very existence is foreign [Music] in the eastern countries when jesus said i am the good shepherd i am the door to the sheepfold he said when he gathers his sheep an enormous day and make sure they are set they enter then he becomes the dog [Applause] he said he becomes the door nothing can enter and nothing can go out therefore be not afraid [Music] [Applause] nothing can happen us until he opens the door and if he allows something then he has a purpose for it [Applause] there is nothing that is out of cater he is in control his very existence is for us be not afraid no matter the situation no matter what is happening don't be afraid god don't want you to be afraid weather pandemic weather marital problem whatever don't be afraid he is in control he has a purpose for everything we don't understand why should this why should this but he knows he understands and he knows uh hallelujah he's watching he said i am watching over my word i will perform it when joseph was shown by his brothers he didn't understood why where are these problems he went here and there was problem he went here there was problem he went to potiphar there was problem he stood there was problem he everywhere but all those problems were leading him to the truth the problem was leading him to the truth his dreams what he has dreamt and what god has planned for him the problems that he was getting into here and there was leading to that place but he never know and you never know but there is somebody that is in control somebody that is in control so be not afraid [Music] hallelujah praise the name of the lord you're not afraid there is nothing to fear nothing because the bible says he has not given us the spirit to fear amen so if you have a spirit of fear it is not from god it's a fear no little flock he said any time there is a situation god say fear no that means there is some challenge around but he said don't be afraid i'm there listing hey day and night is the same before god day and night is the same god don't use light to see hallelujah and there is no way that you can hide a child of god there is no way that he cannot go when it comes to the matters of his children when he comes to the matters with his children every mother every parent will do that physically even animals when they come to the babies you cannot stand between a lion and a baby even common chicken common chicken you can't stand between that chicken and the baby you talk up any animal they will fight for their little ones they will do everything for their little ones if animals if animals if dog is cat animals chicken we fight for their little one what about the most high god what about the almighty god be not afraid he has not lost interest in his creation he has not lost interest in you god has not lost interest in you no no no no no he has not lost interest that is why he is working on that every day sometimes we give up on ourselves on our brothers on our sisters our wives and this one oh this is what i think is goddamn god don't give up it doesn't he said all that my father have given to me they will come to me i will not lose one that is why he can go he lived in 99 the 99 elizabeth stay here i'm coming and he goes and he goes for one he's looking for you he's looking for somebody somebody has to surrender somebody say i'm here somebody has to hear that voice he said and where are you where are you saying i'm here somebody has to respond because the master is calling because the serpent is calling and it's looking for you oh be not afraid [Music] don't let anything intimidate you any man or any woman any power we are sons and daughters of the king god don't want his children to fear god told every man don't be afraid of their faces whatever he said don't be afraid if you're afraid i will disgrace you so don't be afraid be a man be up and be doing be steadfast be unmovable be strong be brave [Applause] [Music] do be afraid in this hour there's a lot of fear upon people do you know what to do but god said don't be afraid like i said nothing can take you from here until god has finished with us god knew there will be a pandemic in this our day god knew i would call some of my children in this hour if god didn't see me have said to the church if god never see me going in this pandemic i will not go there were many of our brethren that were sick and god healed him there were those that went through that right and i said listen those who went through this point the michael has gone it's not because they were weak in faith no way they were not working faith they were strong in faith do you know hallelujah in the bible peter was arrested one night and they were supposed to kill him in fact the king was prepared to kill them the bible said before peter was arrested james has been killed this era has already killed james and the people were happy so he went ahead and arrested peter and peter was sleeping in truth between two people and he was in chains i slept with two men in the inner they have been put in where they put hidden creaminess at midnight the bible says the believers were praying believers were praying the believers were praying may god give us grace to be praying men and praying women praying men and praying women and remember this god answers prayer hallelujah listen listen the prophet of god said when god says no it is as good as is yes he said we should be happy with the nose jesus happy with the yes [Music] don't be disappointed don't let the devil tell you you see the prayer and you said god never get away from me because no is an answer and yes it's an answer when god said wait it means wait a minute when the sun wait wait whoa hallelujah are you there don't look down upon yourself self-pity is sin [Music] see me see me everybody is this see me after me hallelujah yourself [Music] young woman says oh my friends are getting married these people get good job and that will get great job and they say that and that you begin to compare yourself with somebody and then you say why me why not to you why not you should leave me why not you oh but we are all here for a purpose so your trial may be different from mantra your challenge may be different from my challenge but god has a ant in everything hallelujah at midnight the people were praying and praying and praying and the bible said the angel of the lord descended he went right to the prison he knew where peter was he knew where he was he didn't go looking forward no he went right there he went right there nothing can stop god's purpose nothing can stop god's purpose god has a purpose for your life god has a purpose for your life god has the purpose of my life and nothing can stop it does not matter where you are put even in the lion's den it went right there nobody can stop jehovah therefore be not afraid trust in the lord with all your heart refer your mind love the lord commit your life commit your ways into the answer of the lord it will make a way for you [Music] the india went there follow me take your shoes take a rope come follow me the people were still sleeping now before then james was killed my question is when james was arrested why was he killed did you think the people didn't pray did you think the believers didn't pray huh did you think they didn't pray they prayed but god is suffering [Music] [Applause] are you following that so don't compare your life to anybody one day one day they arrested paul and salas and the bible says they turned their clothes and they whipped them listen they give them many bibles and many lashes stripes because in those days infinity they give you 40

they bury him with that he said is it because you didn't have faith jesus was there when john was killed jesus was on the scene you think he didn't know he knew but you should remember when errold at the best of john the baptist and christ the wise men came to jerusalem where he see that he's born king of the jews and herod told him go and find him when he finally come and tell me i will also go and worship worshiping and the wise man didn't come back harold sent me to go and kill from six breath to two years old or should be killed those who were born the same day that killed them joseph was told to take jesus out but where was john the baptist where was he taken to he was there he was taken nowhere but nothing touched him nothing touched him nothing touching because he has a ministry because he has said what to do so nothing touch him they could not kill him he made it true he made it through and you make it through and you make it through the bible says a thousand will fall at my side ten thousand at my right hand but he shall not come near me he made it through and you will make it through and you will make it through and we will make it through no matter what no matter how annoyed no matter how many powers no matter how many of mine it can be diseases it can be that one it can be this one we will make it until god has finished before nothing can take us [Music] i pray to the church before i travel i say look as i'm preaching if i fall down dead here what i expect you to do is come and pray for me if you pray and god says it's okay carry me out i finished my work brother branham said when god is finished with me i'm finished with life i don't want to stay here one minute but until then but untoday but until then i'll press on i'll preach it i will leave it i'll glorify god until then listen brethren it is very natural for us to line our lives with the word [Music] check your life every day with the word of the lord am i doing what you want me to do am i living right it's not enough just to come to church [Music] it's not enough it's more than that are we following that the new birth is an experience that we have to experience christ in our lives [Music] [Music] may the lord help us don't compare your life to anybody you are different i'm different we are different people okay listen daniel was taken and thrown into the lion's den when he went to the alliance then they said that meshach and abednego went to the lion's den went down here i said that message and a bad were thrown to the fire what was that here did any compromise on the world did they never see the image no so don't compare your life to anybody we are different people we are here for purpose ask god brother branham said yes if you are employed by a man or hired to do a work you have to find out from the boss of the boss man what do you want me to do what do you want me to do and we must find from god what does he want us to do [Music] amen what do you want me to do which part of the body you want me to be and then when you know then you can stand there you can stand there and you can put your heart in it you can put your soul in it just like i have put my heart and my soul in what i am doing here then whether somebody appreciates you or nobody appreciates you there is somebody about there is somebody up there your eyes on him hallelujah brother brown said yes i know people don't want to hear a branch but it's probably that said it's not me [Music] you cannot read the bible without saying somebody said [Applause] we said daniel said isaiah said jeremiah said paul said beat the side this one sucks [Applause] [Applause] what are we saying what did isa say what as i said about jesus is what we are saying what moses said about jesus is what we are saying one person or jesus is what we are saying what brother the blood said about jesus is what we are saying what the disciples said about jesus what we are saying [Applause] when jesus was here when jesus was here jesus said moses said jesus said as i said jesus said moses said the prophet said david said [Applause] hallelujah be not afraid he's in control [Music] see it brings failure the children of israel going to cadets burning wonder why i went to cadets paneer the promised land was dead this is the place go and look at the place the work has already been done but you have to be brave god said be brave branham said god will not drive away the people and take you through a pipeline and pick you here and say that you have overcome if a man is preaching like this and telling you that you have to fight for your ground is this sin is it wrong that foot priest means possession you have to fight for your grounds god will not do everything for a fight for it is it wrong is it sin may god help us brothers may god help us i want you to sit up i want you to know that god has visited us god sent a prophet he sent a message he vindicated the prophet he vindicated the ministry with supernatural things things that have never been done since the deaths of the apostles brother branham said do you think god will give me the ministry he has given me and vindicate it all over the world and leave me in error he said god forbid i know where i'm standing [Applause] yes sir may god help us brothers and sisters don't have doubt in your mind about the prophet of god how can a man an honest man like this even things that happened in his own family i met my wife to tell a lie because telephone rang i'm tired and wonder he never hyped anything all that we know today he said it himself he said it to himself my wife backed the door on me and this one he never let any brother preachers here come and stand behind the church and say that my wife banged the door on me my wife you have to live somewhere else you will go and live somewhere else and my wife did this and so you just grace me in church yes try it anybody should try it but this man set a life there was nothing secret about it these messages was not preached in a corner the thing that god did was not done in a corner may god help us have no doubt in your mind what will you do with david david committed adultery david said there's a man after my heart abraham our father he told life and yet he's the friend of god the bible says they were men of like persons as we are but god uses man irrespective of what they are in their shackles god uses them what is important to us today is the message he preached jesus christ he prayed the resurrection he prayed the holy ghost [Applause] be not afraid stay with the message stay with the world stand with the word god will take care of it [Applause] if god took care of the prophet he whatever that ministry is watching over the ministry of the bride [Applause] god bless you brothers what am i saying don't be afraid god will take care of us he will take care of us there will be trials there will be challenges but he will take care of us we have not believed kennelly devised tables these things are the true saying of almighty god i am committed to it i am showed up to it it's my life it has helped me i got this message when i uh 1978. and i've never been the same i was a pentecostal boy i was buying christian literatures here and there we had a little we preaching the buses we do bus evangelism we go to street evangelism we go to market evangelism we go everywhere preaching and i buy christian literatures and i go everywhere buying books here and there until one day all those years i never heard anything about prophet i don't know but one day grace came down and somebody introduced jesus look look look huh and i was preparing to go to bible college i wanted to go to bible college i tried that i want to go to that we'll be hearing about a alley that was a young boy miracle valley i want to go to miranda valley but one of the first messages that i read was a true sign that is overlooked i don't want to overlook that true sound true sign if you miss the sign if you misread the sign you will get lost when the signs are given the one who breaks the road desires everything and give no signs you must know the real science you should be able to read the wrong signs and you should be able to follow the road signs when you follow the roadside you reach your destination i read the message i think the second message that i was invisible you know of the heavenly bright room and there i didn't even understood it but something he said this is the truth and since then it has been coming from glory to glory from i mean i mean glory to glory the light keeps coming plain and plainer look into your own life what has the message done what has christ done in your life because all that the prophet preached was christ nobody exhausted christ like brother branham did he exalted christ everything about christ everything about christ everything about the world he said this is my absolute year everything is here nobody did it like brother brahm did it stay with the word of god god bless you don't be afraid fear will make you to faith if you have a doubt you're going to take a medicine and you have doubt whether this thing will work or not it will never work no double minded person can receive anything from god you must be settled in your mind convinced and consent this thing i thought will it work this thing you have doubt it will never work when they pray for me will i get where hey if you don't believe it will never work for you be not afraid don't look at the opposition don't look at the people in the land the oh this one said that and that was said this and this one said that and this one said that i don't care what anybody says i am convinced on the word of the lord i don't care whether anakin's or jebusize or dwarf statement and i don't care about that i care about the holy ghost i care about the word that they preach i care about jesus christ [Music] [Applause] don't be afraid they said in our own eyes we look like grasshoppers and that is how we look in the eyes of the enemy who told you in our eyes we are like even before the enemy do you know how somebody see when they send the people to come and arrest elijah allah just said lord smile them back they had eyes like they didn't see elijah they didn't feel alas i said well you said we are looking for allah and they might be talking oh thank you thank

blinded until they got to elijah said go open their eyes now don't be afraid may god bless your enemies may god protect his children may god watch over you may god favor you may he favor you may it shine upon you scrub you upon you oh hallelujah be not afraid the battle is his battle it's not your battle the price has been paid from earth to glory be not afraid nobody can change our destination

spirit self-pity is a sin false humility is a sin [Music] in the message don't like confident people they call them proud they don't want you to be confident they say you proud they want you to wear a certain kind of of nature i am not brother greg brother greg must be just the way god created him and i must be the way god created me and we appreciate one another and there is something in the nature of brother greg that god made him that way to help me how can i make brother great to be like me this is why you see young minister copying the behavior of all the minister they're preaching like them they're moving like them no brother branham say preach on the pulpit the way you preaching on the street the way you talking on the street brother sammy's brother sam brother kelly's brother kelly brother steve and his brother stephen and we enjoy the god of variety and we can see through all of that the beauty of god being displayed don't copy nobody be original buy the card that you
