[25:12] that he should give his only
[25:16] son to make a wretch his
[25:21] treasure
[25:26] how great the pain of searing lost
[25:32] the father turns his face away

[25:54] behold the man upon
[25:57] a cross my sin
[26:00] upon his shoulders
[26:06] ashamed i hear my mocking voice

[26:36] life i know
[26:39] that it is finished

[39:04] you might be seated
[39:10] everybody know what an amalekite is
[39:12] right
[39:15] how many read matthew 25
[39:18] you read them you got all your people
[39:21] right
[39:22] praise the name of the lord so you save
[39:23] yourself time
[39:26] tomorrow i will stand on the top of the
[39:28] hill with the road of god
[39:30] i thought it was the road of moses in my
[39:32] hand
[39:34] so joshua did as moses had said to him
[39:37] and fought with amalek and moses
[39:40] aaron and er went up to the top of the
[39:42] hill
[39:44] so the battle of amalek
[39:47] the first time it happened it depended
[39:50] on what was going on on the hill
[39:54] amen so the situation on the hill
[39:58] was determining the outcome of the
[40:01] battle
[40:02] if the hill is not going good over there
[40:05] you're going to be whipped
[40:07] so when you fight amalek you must make
[40:10] sure
[40:11] the hillside over there whoever have the
[40:14] hands like this
[40:15] his hand must stay like that
[40:19] amen if you see that person's hand going
[40:22] this way then you're in trouble
[40:24] amen but in which a time when the hand
[40:27] of moses got tired
[40:29] so god used two nails
[40:34] he used a nail called arona
[40:38] and he used a nail called earth
[40:41] and aaron and earl fastened the hand of
[40:44] moses
[40:45] on the hill amen
[40:49] so the two now kept the hand of moses
[40:52] and as long as the hand of moses is
[40:55] up the battle with amalek
[40:59] is won
[41:04] amen
[41:06] praise the name of the lord
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] let me jump down to verse 13 and joshua
[41:12] disconfited
[41:14] amalek and his people with the age of
[41:17] the sword
[41:18] so on the hill someone was like this
[41:21] after somebody was like this then the
[41:25] battle that started after that man
[41:33] amen verse 14 and the lord said to moses
[41:37] write this for a memorial in a book
[41:41] amen there were many battle between
[41:44] israel and amalek but the only
[41:48] battle that was written in the bible
[41:51] in the book was only the battle of
[41:55] joshua but the battle of joshua
[41:58] had to be as a millionaire
[42:09] you must preach like joshua you must
[42:13] preach like
[42:13] joshua
[42:26] was not written in the bible among all
[42:29] of them
[42:30] they only wrote paul amen
[42:34] okay write this foreign
[42:47] from under heaven joshua was the one to
[42:50] replace
[42:51] moses and moses at this point at this
[42:54] type
[42:55] he is the one on the hill with the two
[42:58] hand
[42:59] up so the ministry that followed
[43:02] a man on the hill with two hands up
[43:06] was the ministry of joshua in other
[43:09] words the anointing the lion anointing
[43:11] that was on moses
[43:13] was reversed or poured down unto joshua
[43:19] we're gonna get there and moses built an
[43:22] altar
[43:22] and called this name of jehovah
[43:26] nasee which is the lord is our
[43:30] banner so this border birth the name of
[43:33] god
[43:33] out or reveal or unfold the name of god
[43:38] one of the redemptive names there were
[43:39] seven of them one of them was
[43:41] birthed because of the battle with
[43:44] amalek
[43:45] he opened up a unveiled revelation which
[43:48] is
[43:48] a banner amen but what is his banner
[43:52] to us amen verse 16 for he says
[43:57] because the lord has sown that the lord
[44:01] not israel will have war with
[44:04] amalek from generation to
[44:08] generation so we see right here that god
[44:11] not israel will have war
[44:14] with amalek from generation to
[44:17] generation
[44:18] because the war will be from generation
[44:21] to generation
[44:22] the first one must be written and placed
[44:25] in the book as a reference to what god
[44:29] did
[44:30] because he's the same yesterday today
[44:34] and forever if he would malek the first
[44:37] time
[44:38] throughout the edges god will continue
[44:40] to whoop amalek
[44:43] amen let's go to number 24
[44:48] amen
[44:52] hallelujah
[44:59] number 24 verse 16.
[45:03] this is balaam prophesying
[45:06] he has said which heard the words of god
[45:11] and knew the knowledge of the most high
[45:13] which saw the vision
[45:15] of the almighty falling into a trance
[45:18] that's
[45:18] balaam but having his eyes open that's a
[45:21] prophet
[45:22] the two subconscious are linked together
[45:24] that's why his eyes are open yet he can
[45:26] see
[45:27] vision amen verse 17
[45:30] i shall see him this hymn is somebody
[45:34] but not now bellamy is looking into
[45:37] vision in the future
[45:38] and he saw someone amen i shall behold
[45:42] him
[45:43] but not near in other words he's not
[45:45] coming now but i can see
[45:46] the messiah over there he saw the
[45:49] messiah
[45:50] amen there shall come a star
[45:53] out of jacob so berlin saw jesus but
[45:56] he's just explaining that i see him he's
[45:58] going to come
[45:59] but not now not in my days amen
[46:02] and except we already talked about the
[46:05] scepter with judah
[46:06] a scepter shall rise out of israel and
[46:09] shall smart the corner or the forehead
[46:12] of moab
[46:13] we spoke about it when roof have to
[46:15] depart from the land of moab
[46:17] and destroy all the children of shed
[46:21] verse 18 and edom shall be a possession
[46:25] how many knows who
[46:29] you know that or you want to see it in
[46:31] the bible
[46:33] we know praise the name of the lord for
[46:36] those who want to see it
[46:37] genesis 36 verse 1 and verse 8.
[46:42] you're gonna see clearly edom esau was
[46:44] called
[46:45] edom genesis 36 verse one and verse
[46:48] eight
[46:49] clear and edom eso shall be a possession
[46:53] seer also shall be a possession for his
[46:56] enemy
[46:57] and israel shall do violently so we
[47:00] found out that there is a star that is
[47:02] going to come out of israel
[47:04] but it seems like this star will fight
[47:07] against israel
[47:10] this messiah this star which we know is
[47:14] jesus
[47:15] will be fighting with esau
[47:19] why is jesus fighting with esau
[47:22] amen verse 19 out of
[47:26] jacob shall come he that shall have
[47:28] dominion that's the messiah
[47:31] and shall destroy him that remains of
[47:33] the city
[47:35] verse 20. and when he looked on
[47:38] amalek this is belem under the anointing
[47:42] when he fell under the anointing he saw
[47:44] the messiah
[47:46] when he began to look at the messiah he
[47:48] said wait a minute the messiah would
[47:50] destroy esau now
[47:52] when balaam under the anointing begin to
[47:55] move
[47:55] his eyes fell on amalek
[48:00] amen and when he looked on amalek
[48:04] he took up his parable and say amalek
[48:07] was the
[48:08] first of the nations even the first one
[48:12] to fight israel
[48:13] out of egypt amen so amalek is a nation
[48:18] but these his rather end shall be that
[48:22] he
[48:22] perished forever in other words when
[48:25] berlin saw amalek
[48:27] he saw that the first of the nation
[48:29] would be amalek
[48:30] but later on amalek will be wiped
[48:33] completely
[48:35] amen because god spoke already that i
[48:38] will
[48:38] blood out i will erase the remembrance
[48:42] of amalek
[48:43] and the prophecy of belem is coming and
[48:45] lining up with that that
[48:47] god will destroy amalek
[48:51] so the messiah will have war with israel
[48:54] and war with amalek amen
[48:58] verse 21 and he look
[49:01] on the key night who are
[49:04] these people the key knight
[49:09] he looks on the key night and took up
[49:13] his parable
[49:14] and said strong is your dwelling place
[49:18] the key night are strong
[49:23] amen strong is your dwelling place their
[49:27] darling place where they sit
[49:29] strong and you put your nest
[49:32] in a rock the kinite have a rest
[49:36] in the rock you know what a rock is
[49:40] so they're not too bad amen nevertheless
[49:44] the kingdom
[49:45] shall be wasted until ashure babylon
[49:49] shall carry you away captive so they're
[49:52] going to be carried
[49:53] by babylon so we see here
[49:56] that this star will fight iso
[50:00] the star will destroy amalek
[50:03] but they also remember us that there is
[50:06] a nation also called the kenite it is a
[50:09] strong nation
[50:11] and it's blocked it is seated it is
[50:14] resting
[50:14] on the rock on the world
[50:18] amen let's go to roman chapter
[50:21] 15 then we will pray
[50:25] since you already done your reading that
[50:27] was sent to you
[50:29] we're not going to read matthew 25 but
[50:31] what i highlighted there
[50:33] is a shepherd as a shepherd
[50:36] separating the sheep from the goat and
[50:39] he told
[50:40] those on the right side when i was sick
[50:43] you did this when i was hungry you gave
[50:45] me this this this
[50:46] and he said and they say when did you do
[50:49] that unto us
[50:50] did we do that to you he said when you
[50:52] did it to the list
[50:54] amen so when somebody treats you they
[50:57] are treating jesus
[50:59] amen those people never saw jesus in
[51:02] flesh
[51:03] that's the reason why they ask when did
[51:05] we see you and we did this
[51:07] and jesus explained to them that no when
[51:09] you do something to me
[51:11] it means you are doing something through
[51:13] my people
[51:15] amen let's go to romans 15 verse 1.
[51:20] if you dare you can say amen
[51:23] when we then that are strong
[51:27] or to bear the infirmity of the weak
[51:30] some are strong
[51:31] some are weak but the strong one support
[51:34] the weak
[51:35] why do you need to support the weak
[51:38] you're going to see it
[51:40] and not to please ourselves let every
[51:43] one of us
[51:44] please his neighbor for his good or to
[51:48] edification in other words we are
[51:50] building up together
[51:51] but we are not destroying one another
[51:54] amen
[51:55] but we are here to back up one another
[51:58] to build
[51:58] up together amen if you see somebody
[52:02] with a weakness
[52:03] it's not a place to kill him it's for
[52:05] you to cover himself
[52:07] up and then to back him and pull him up
[52:10] amen because the kingdom of god have
[52:13] strong people
[52:14] and weak people the church have strong
[52:18] people
[52:19] and weak people if you are strong don't
[52:22] be arrogant
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:28] for even christ please not himself
[52:32] but as it's written the reproaches of
[52:34] them that reproaches you
[52:36] fell on me jump to verse
[52:39] five now the god of patience and
[52:42] consolation
[52:43] grant you to be like-minded one-to-one
[52:45] another according to christ
[52:47] jesus that you may be with one mind
[52:51] and one month together as a family
[52:54] glorifying glorified god even the father
[52:58] of our lord
[52:59] jesus christ amen if you would
[53:03] turn to esther chapter 3 and we're going
[53:05] to pray

[53:50] light
[53:51] and you send us the evening light that
[53:53] have enlightened the path for us lord

[54:04] we shall not be left
[54:05] comfortless lord father you will be with
[54:07] us and you gonna gather us
[54:09] all the way to the end lord we are
[54:11] committing this service unto the hand
[54:13] asking you that you move me completely
[54:16] out of the way
[54:16] may you drop down father this morning
[54:19] and speak to your children
[54:20] may the devil be completely sealed out
[54:23] and may only the holy spirit
[54:25] and your angel be sailed in this
[54:27] building father we committed all unto
[54:29] the hand
[54:30] in the name of jesus christ amen
[54:34] god bless you all good to see the entire
[54:36] family this morning
[54:38] we are dealing with king ahazaris three
[54:41] fists and
[54:42] esther two banquets we are on part five
[54:46] last sunday we were dealing with esther
[54:48] chapter three we already finished esther
[54:50] chapter one
[54:51] we finished chapter two we are now
[54:53] dealing with the third chapter of esther
[54:56] chapter three and when we read esther
[54:59] chapter three
[55:00] we found out that there was a man by the
[55:02] name of heaven which we already
[55:04] described to you
[55:05] that he was lucifer but another about
[55:08] him and
[55:09] was called in the scripture a naga guide
[55:12] and we were trying to detect
[55:13] what does he mean with an aggregate and
[55:17] a man had a problem
[55:18] with a man called mordecai and if you
[55:21] look naturally you might think that it's
[55:24] a personal problem
[55:25] between a man and mordechai but if you
[55:28] dig
[55:29] spiritually you're gonna find out that
[55:31] the problem
[55:32] is not about airmen and mordecai
[55:36] but the problem is about the religion
[55:39] the faith of mordecai
[55:43] versus what amen want him and want
[55:47] the entire world to buy down him and
[55:50] want
[55:50] everybody to worship him amen want
[55:54] everybody to recognize his supremacy
[55:57] but there is a man in that age who is
[56:00] called mordecai and the bible described
[56:03] to us that mordecai was a jew
[56:05] which we all know that a jew speak about
[56:08] a genuine christian
[56:10] and the faith of modical or the religion
[56:14] of modica was the cause that was
[56:18] resisting actually emman so it was
[56:21] not mordecai firing a man
[56:24] he was the faith of modica
[56:27] fighting or resisting ammon
[56:30] amen they were not wrestling with flesh
[56:34] and blood
[56:36] but it was the spirit that was in a
[56:38] mordekai
[56:40] have something to do with the spirit
[56:42] that was with
[56:44] heaven everybody cleared so far
[56:47] now when we look at the man egg at the
[56:50] name
[56:50] agar we went into the bible in first
[56:53] samuel chapter 15.
[56:55] in first samuel chapter 15 we found out
[56:58] that there was a man
[57:00] by the name of saul and saul was sent
[57:03] by the prophet samuel to go and to
[57:06] destroy
[57:07] the amalekite let's go to first samuel
[57:10] chapter
[57:11] 15 i told you esther but i believe i
[57:14] covered it
[57:16] first samuel chapter 15 if you dare you
[57:20] can say amen
[57:22] verse 2 that says the lord of hosts
[57:25] i remember that which amalek did to
[57:28] israel we already seen what amalek did
[57:31] how he laid wait for him in the way
[57:35] he's a man that is waiting for you in
[57:37] the way
[57:38] when you are in the way when you are in
[57:41] the path of duty
[57:42] when you are in the true way of god just
[57:46] be watchful
[57:47] amalek is somewhere amen
[57:50] when he came up from egypt now go
[57:54] and smite amalek and elderly destroy
[57:58] everything oh we already spoke about
[58:00] this
[58:01] in other words when you kill a malek
[58:03] don't even touch the things that belong
[58:06] to amalek
[58:07] not only do you destroy amalek but
[58:10] destroy
[58:10] also that which belong to amalek
[58:13] whether it's good or bad kill it
[58:16] [Music]
[58:19] all that they have and spare them not
[58:22] but slave both men and women infant
[58:25] eventually the children he's going to
[58:27] grow up and be an amalekite
[58:29] and circling ox and sheep
[58:33] camel and us and so saul gather
[58:37] the people together and number them in
[58:39] tell him
[58:40] two hundred thousand foot men and ten
[58:42] thousand men of judah
[58:44] and so came to the city to a city of
[58:47] amalek
[58:48] and laid weight in the valley we're
[58:50] going to go back again to that valley
[58:53] now watch closely and i want you to
[58:56] buckle up here amen
[58:58] verse six and so brother robert saw it
[59:01] praise god if you don't have your bible
[59:04] i want you to read your bible make sure
[59:06] you look in your scripture
[59:07] amen whether it's on your ipad i
[59:10] whatever i
[59:11] just make sure you watch it amen 6
[59:14] and so say to the king knight
[59:19] everybody understand now we okay now
[59:22] you see this right here
[59:25] so say to the keynote
[59:29] go deport get you down from among the
[59:34] amalekite
[59:37] so the amalekites were mixed together
[59:41] with the king knight are we okay
[59:44] together
[59:46] so when you wanna kill an amalek he's
[59:49] not somebody that is truly separated
[59:53] he's somebody that knows how to
[59:55] camouflage
[59:58] amen because remember the dwelling of
[1:00:01] the king art are what
[1:00:03] strong and that cannot dwell in the
[1:00:07] rock so amalek get between them
[1:00:10] and sat there
[1:00:15] are we okay are we okay
[1:00:18] okay let's continue and so say to the
[1:00:22] canad
[1:00:23] go deport get you down
[1:00:26] from among the americans lest that
[1:00:29] destroy you
[1:00:30] with them for you sure what
[1:00:35] you see that matthew 25
[1:00:39] okay somebody got it hallelujah
[1:00:42] that makes sense for you sure what
[1:00:46] kindness to all the children of what
[1:00:50] so when the children of israel were in
[1:00:52] prison they cannot come to see them amen
[1:00:58] when the children of israel were hungry
[1:01:00] the canaan came to feed them
[1:01:04] when the children of israel were tested
[1:01:06] they cannot come
[1:01:07] and feed them and because of being
[1:01:10] good to their brethren
[1:01:14] matthew 25 remember the reading i gave
[1:01:16] you
[1:01:17] in other words when you are dealing with
[1:01:20] amalek
[1:01:22] so got into the valley but in the valley
[1:01:25] he found out that they are sheep
[1:01:27] and growth remember are you there
[1:01:31] the sheep are the canine
[1:01:36] and the gods are the amalekite
[1:01:40] are you there and we saw in matthew 25
[1:01:43] that the shepherd is separating
[1:01:46] the sheep from the goat the sheep were
[1:01:50] good to the brethren
[1:01:53] but they got were bad to the brethren
[1:01:56] and we found that mixture now that the
[1:01:59] amalekites are dealing with the keynote
[1:02:04] we okay now
[1:02:08] for you show kindness to all the
[1:02:11] children of israel
[1:02:12] when they came out of what egypt
[1:02:15] so the k night the kenite departed from
[1:02:19] among the amalekites
[1:02:20] they have to do a separation i'm going
[1:02:23] to bring judgment
[1:02:24] but since you are good to the brethren i
[1:02:28] want you to move away
[1:02:29] so i can destroy the wicked one
[1:02:33] everybody there praise the name of the
[1:02:35] lord
[1:02:38] in exodus chapter 17 verse 14
[1:02:41] the bible says that our orderly put out
[1:02:44] the remembrance of
[1:02:46] amalek from monday what in other words
[1:02:49] i'm gonna use the name of amalek
[1:02:52] amen but when i'm trying to erase the
[1:02:56] name of amalek
[1:02:58] around the america they are key night
[1:03:01] kinaad are good to the brother the name
[1:03:04] are in the book of life that's why they
[1:03:07] must take them out
[1:03:09] save them and destroy those that the
[1:03:12] name need to be erased
[1:03:14] from the book of life are we clear
[1:03:18] we went through the book of life and we
[1:03:19] understand that amen
[1:03:21] brother branham says this in the
[1:03:23] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:03:25] he said but these do not have eternal
[1:03:28] life
[1:03:29] and they are in the judgment the kingdom
[1:03:32] they are allowed to go into eternal life
[1:03:36] but upon what ground do they enter
[1:03:39] into eternal life certainly not
[1:03:43] upon the fact that they already have his
[1:03:45] life
[1:03:46] as does the bread they are not the bread
[1:03:48] they are just
[1:03:49] good to the bread amen but they receive
[1:03:52] it because they were what
[1:03:54] kind to the brethren that's why they are
[1:03:57] spared
[1:03:58] they are not his brethren they are
[1:04:00] kinite
[1:04:01] amen that would make them joint hair
[1:04:05] with christ with jesus
[1:04:07] they are not heirs to anything but what
[1:04:11] do they are just trying to spare them
[1:04:13] from judgment
[1:04:14] they share no throne they are not the
[1:04:16] bread etc with him
[1:04:19] their name must have been in the
[1:04:22] book of life and not now because of the
[1:04:26] love of the people of god
[1:04:29] they are recognized and you see why the
[1:04:33] old testament is written
[1:04:35] in symbols amen those people were doing
[1:04:38] things they didn't even know
[1:04:40] why they were doing it but since the
[1:04:42] opening of the sale
[1:04:44] the entire bible has been revealed
[1:04:48] amen no doubt they served
[1:04:52] and helped the children of what that's
[1:04:55] what the keynote did
[1:04:56] perhaps like who and who
[1:05:00] they stood for the children in the time
[1:05:03] of what
[1:05:04] when israel was coming out of egypt in
[1:05:07] trouble
[1:05:08] the keynote came to help them but
[1:05:11] the new king knight here brother branham
[1:05:14] is calling them nicodemus
[1:05:21] and the second keynote brother brother
[1:05:23] is calling him who
[1:05:25] remember the keynote are strong
[1:05:29] they dwell in the rock they are not
[1:05:32] pagan like you think but if you look
[1:05:37] in the mixture you're going to see an
[1:05:39] amalekite

[1:11:02] christ
[1:11:02] when jesus was killed by the pharisees
[1:11:06] yet nicodemus went there and continued
[1:11:10] to do
[1:11:10] good to the body of jesus christ
[1:11:14] that's why so say i'm not gonna destroy
[1:11:16] you

[1:12:12] the same spirit that killed jesus is now
[1:12:15] hunting the many jesuses

[1:13:18] a little space and say to them
[1:13:22] you men of israel take heed to yourself
[1:13:25] what you intend to do as touching these
[1:13:28] men
[1:13:29] jump to verse 38 and now i say to you
[1:13:32] refrain from these men and let them
[1:13:35] alone
[1:13:35] for if this council or this work be of
[1:13:38] men
[1:13:39] it will come to nothing but if it be of
[1:13:42] god
[1:13:42] you cannot overthrow him less happily
[1:13:46] you'll be found even to fight against
[1:13:49] god so we found out again camarillo here
[1:13:53] standing for the children of god yet
[1:13:56] being part of the council
[1:13:59] we're clear now that's your keynote
[1:14:05] let's go back to first samuel chapter 15
[1:14:09] i just want you to understand that so we
[1:14:11] can move on because you got to detect an
[1:14:13] amalekite

[1:14:18] get out because you show kindness
[1:14:22] you are the sheep that came to visited
[1:14:24] me in a hospital

[1:14:28] them water
[1:14:29] when they were thirsty because of that
[1:14:31] depart
[1:14:32] because i'm gonna judge the goat
[1:14:34] everybody clear
[1:14:35] when they came up out of egypt so they
[1:14:38] cannot deport
[1:14:39] from among the americans they got out
[1:14:42] the protection that the amalekite had
[1:14:46] gath amen because they cannot
[1:14:50] dwell their dwelling place are strong
[1:14:52] the americans
[1:14:53] take refuge there and sit there and use
[1:14:57] those head as their computer
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:03] hallelujah jump to verse seven
[1:15:07] and so smoth the amalekite from avila
[1:15:10] until you come to sure that is opposite
[1:15:14] egypt and he took ergag
[1:15:18] the king of thee so now we found out
[1:15:22] that
[1:15:22] the king of the americas his name is
[1:15:25] agag
[1:15:26] amen so this battle right here
[1:15:30] ag who is the king of the america this
[1:15:33] battle now between mordecai and heaven
[1:15:37] is not really the battle between
[1:15:39] mordecai and heaven
[1:15:41] it is the battle between god and amalek
[1:15:48] amen you thought so destroy
[1:15:52] all the americans but saul
[1:15:55] spared the king of the amalekite whose
[1:15:58] name was
[1:15:59] elgar at this point
[1:16:02] amalek was a pagan nation i'm going
[1:16:06] somewhere
[1:16:08] let's go to verse 8. and he took agag
[1:16:11] the king of the amalekite alive and
[1:16:14] elderly destroy what
[1:16:16] so you will think that there won't be
[1:16:18] any amalekite left right
[1:16:20] only the king right let's continue
[1:16:25] oddly destroy the people with the age of
[1:16:28] the sword
[1:16:29] but saul and the people spare agag
[1:16:32] and the best of the ship and of the oxen
[1:16:36] that's a whole message here
[1:16:38] and of the faddling and the lambs and
[1:16:41] all that was
[1:16:43] and would not utterly destroy them but
[1:16:46] everything that was vile
[1:16:48] or refused that they destroyed utterly
[1:16:52] in other words when saul got into the
[1:16:54] battle
[1:16:55] he began to choose or to pick and choose
[1:16:58] what to do he look he said ah this one
[1:17:01] we can use him in the church
[1:17:03] this one we can do it here the prophet
[1:17:06] said destroy all.

[1:21:23] amen the message is perfectly lined up
[1:21:26] with the
[1:21:27] bible when brother branham said the
[1:21:29] american is anything that denies the
[1:21:31] word
[1:21:32] there is a scripture for it even though

[1:21:52] now the war here is it looks like
[1:21:56] it's monika fighting about a man
[1:21:59] but it's not it is the amalekite
[1:22:02] fighting
[1:22:03] with who god god why
[1:22:07] when god met so paul in acts chapter 9
[1:22:11] the bible says that he fell to the earth
[1:22:14] and heard the voice saying unto him
[1:22:16] so so why persecute
[1:22:20] me have paul met jesus one day

[1:23:15] monaco and emman but the conflict is
[1:23:19] between god
[1:23:20] and satan god were god in his people
[1:23:25] brother branham says this that this
[1:23:27] world is now standing
[1:23:29] in the grip of two great spiritual
[1:23:31] forces i gave you some quote last week
[1:23:34] and they are both religious forces
[1:23:38] pharisees they are key night among them
[1:23:41] and i believe that these great forces
[1:23:44] are soon coming to
[1:23:45] a head they're going to bump and both of
[1:23:48] these forces
[1:23:50] was represented in the two sons of who
[1:23:53] the two sons of isaac are esau and

[1:24:35] went he found the king knight
[1:24:36] and the amalekite living together at
[1:24:40] first
[1:24:41] when saul was sent to kill amalek amalek
[1:24:44] was a nation
[1:24:46] separated from israel amalek was a pagan
[1:24:50] nation
[1:24:52] are you there when saul refused to do
[1:24:56] the commandment of god

[1:25:05] if you would let me drop this so it's
[1:25:09] going to help you
[1:25:10] go back to first samuel chapter 15. just
[1:25:13] keep

[1:25:20] 33
[1:25:21] hallelujah
[1:25:24] amen verse 33 are you there
[1:25:29] and samuels say in other words when
[1:25:31] samuel came he said
[1:25:32] you spare the king you spare the people
[1:25:35] and samuel look he said bring me that
[1:25:37] king hey god
[1:25:39] and samuel killed the king you will
[1:25:42] think
[1:25:43] when they killed the king when saul
[1:25:46] destroyed the amalekite
[1:25:47] it looks like there is no more amalekite
[1:25:50] left
[1:25:52] right look verse 33.
[1:25:55] and samuel said ago
[1:25:58] the sword of aggar he's a killer
[1:26:02] as your sword had made women
[1:26:06] chadlers he was a killer
[1:26:09] you see that it was killing people
[1:26:12] so shall your mother be childless among
[1:26:15] women and samuel you
[1:26:20] airgag pieces
[1:26:23] before the lord in gilgal so this
[1:26:26] prophet

[1:26:52] that
[1:26:53] the kingdom of amalek will be stricken
[1:26:56] and divided in pieces
[1:27:00] are we okay we okay now but if
[1:27:04] so would have performed the commandment
[1:27:07] of god
[1:27:08] amalek will be destroyed one time but
[1:27:11] because
[1:27:11] so did not perform the command of
[1:27:15] the commandment of god even though
[1:27:18] the kingdom of amalek was divided in
[1:27:21] pieces
