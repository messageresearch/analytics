[0:00] we have with the other churches God have
[0:02] mercy on WE poor miserable
[0:07] Pharisees what we need is the power of
[0:09] the Holy Ghost back into the buildings
[0:12] and back into the people that that have
[0:14] the oldfashioned Pentecostal power that
[0:17] clean the church from the janitor to the
[0:24] pastor amen that's what we need but we
[0:28] pray for it and when it comes oh
[0:31] no that interferes with my social
[0:35] standing oh sure cuts down some of the
[0:40] dignity if you don't have it just so and
[0:42] so the people won't come Jesus said no
[0:45] man can come to me except my father draw
[0:48] him notice again all that the father
[0:51] give me will
[0:52] come keep the thing clean we can't never
[0:56] compare with the
[0:58] world
[1:01] we're doing wrong but trying to act like
[1:03] the
[1:06] world we're never can't compare with
[1:08] them and we've got no business out on
[1:10] their
[1:12] grounds bring them over on our
[1:15] grounds we got something they haven't
[1:19] got we go to act like them then they
[1:22] know we we're saying something we have
[1:24] in
[1:25] God let the let the world come to us not
[1:29] us go out a the
[1:30] world let the world you know Hollywood
[1:34] shines but the gospel glows there's a
[1:37] lot of difference between shining and
[1:40] glowing
[1:42] glow not shine with the outward
[1:44] appearance glow on the inside by the
[1:46] Holy
[1:47] Ghost with sweetness meekness gentleness
[1:50] patience and
[1:53] love glow don't
[1:55] shine shines after the world the church
[1:59] is oh like like it was in the days of
[2:01] Esther Esther didn't take the perfuming
[2:04] of of the women she adorned himself with
[2:06] a modest apparel the hidden man of the
[2:08] heart and the King said put the crown on
[2:10] her head Esther was a type of the church
[2:13] today those who are ready to come out
[2:17] and Adorn themselves with the sweetness
[2:20] of the Holy Spirit not the perfuming and
[2:22] the dressing of the world try to compare
[2:25] with them but that hidden man of the
[2:27] heart that's the one
[2:30] notice we find Jesus sitting out there
[2:35] with dirty
[2:37] feet theyve never been
[2:40] noticed how did he get in how did he
[2:43] miss how did the foot wash flunky

[38:37] my heart

[39:35] praying heavenly
[39:40] father father you made possible this
[39:43] meeting
[39:44] tonight if you open the
[39:49] door it's because you have something
[39:52] good that you have prepared for your
[39:55] children that's why why
[39:57] Lord we are are giving oursel unto
[40:02] thee surrendering and waiting everything
[40:06] from
[40:07] thee just one word from thee
[40:11] Lord it's more than a thousand word
[40:14] receive somewhere
[40:16] else because in your word there is life
[40:20] there is
[40:21] Deliverance there is a blessing there is
[40:24] an
[40:25] anointing
[40:27] there is everything that could be
[40:28] precious for a
[40:30] Believer that's why we are surrendering
[40:33] ourselves
[40:36] into because we would like from the
[40:38] beginning to the end of this
[40:42] service we want to be totally under the
[40:45] control of the
[40:47] spirit that's why we expecting from
[40:50] you and we are surrendering ourselves
[40:52] unto the
[40:54] hand we want for the Holy Spirit to
[40:57] teach us
[40:58] T father open our
[41:01] understanding so that we can catch your
[41:04] vision your
[41:05] thoughts in all its
[41:08] depth in the name of Jesus
[41:11] Christ we thank you and ask it Lord amen
[41:17] amen God richly bless you you might be
[41:20] seated a little
[41:24] bit first
[41:26] as I
[41:30] said I really thank brother
[41:35] Steven to open the door so that I can
[41:37] Minister
[41:40] tonight when I say this day because it's
[41:43] a special
[41:44] [Music]
[41:47] day it's a day that is followed by a
[41:51] great holiday here in the United
[41:54] States Thanksgiving
[41:57] that's how you usually call it
[42:01] Thanksgiving but in French we say
[42:04] thanksging that's the way we pronounce
[42:06] it in
[42:08] French so it's a fa it's a it's it's a
[42:11] Hool day that we all
[42:15] honored because it's a
[42:19] holiday where we remember the goodness
[42:23] of the Lord throughout the
[42:25] year
[42:28] and I am fully
[42:32] convinced that's it's an attitude of
[42:36] thankfulness toward
[42:38] God because we call that a
[42:44] Thanksgiving and why such a holiday in
[42:47] the United
[42:49] States I know that it's not only to the
[42:52] United States but even in Canada they
[42:55] they honor the same
[42:57] and it's a different date of
[43:01] course because in the United States is
[43:04] the fourth Thursday of the
[43:09] month called the Thanksgiving it's not a
[43:13] surprise to
[43:14] us because we can bring everything back
[43:17] to the
[43:19] word and brother Bram even explained to
[43:25] us
[43:27] that's the United State based its value
[43:30] upon the word of
[43:34] God because since then we always see the
[43:36] president of the United States having
[43:39] enough with his hand upon this the
[43:43] Bible so in the past years it was a
[43:46] Christian
[43:48] Nation but we know that since a certain
[43:55] time drifted a little bit away from the
[43:59] word but even
[44:02] though there is still some ruin some
[44:06] leftover there is still some
[44:09] trace of Christian values in the life of
[44:12] American people you will find
[44:16] it because when you come to the United
[44:20] States everybody is nice
[44:25] kind want to serve one
[44:29] another everybody is ready to say thank
[44:33] you for a
[44:37] Christian this bring you to a
[44:41] meditation it's showing that these
[44:43] people this American
[44:46] people have inherited
[44:50] something even though the nation drifted
[44:53] away but there still
[44:54] something the custom you can see there
[44:57] is something there still values in the
[45:00] United States that Christianity and we
[45:03] really appreciate
[45:07] that personally I'm not here to but when
[45:11] I went to
[45:12] Europe and when I came to the United
[45:14] States and compare the two you can see
[45:17] the
[45:18] difference the attitude here is
[45:23] different here people are very close to
[45:26] the
[45:28] gospel very close to the Christian
[45:30] values here in the United States
[45:32] compared to
[45:34] Europe so you know that to say thanks
[45:38] thank you to
[45:40] Lord that's something that belongs to
[45:42] the children of
[45:44] God to be
[45:47] grateful it's a sign of
[45:52] humility it's also a sign of love
[45:57] amen and for us
[46:01] Christian we don't have a specific day
[46:04] to thank the
[46:06] Lord every day of our
[46:09] life we always express to the Lord our
[46:13] feelings and our
[46:17] thankfulness and then our
[46:20] acknowledgement
[46:21] remember not only every
[46:24] day
[46:26] because each day you can pray three four
[46:28] five
[46:29] times and every time you go to
[46:33] prayer always a Thanksgiving in your
[46:38] prayer
[46:40] amen that's why for
[46:42] us Thanksgiving is every
[46:48] day the simple F the
[46:51] simple thank you Lord you wake up in the
[46:53] morning thank you Lord
[46:56] coming back from work thank you
[46:59] Lord they give you food thank you
[47:02] Lord before you go to bed thank you
[47:05] Lord you wake up in the middle of the
[47:07] night thank you
[47:09] Lord
[47:10] amen
[47:13] amen that's why we
[47:17] Believers we will never thank God
[47:21] enough there won't be a time in your
[47:24] life where you will say I thank the Lord
[47:26] L
[47:28] never every time your heart is beating
[47:32] you should say thank you
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:36] Lord mer Jes thank you Lord
[47:40] Jesus mer thank
[47:46] you when we are thinking about what
[47:48] happened
[47:51] in sometime we behave like uh crazy
[47:54] people that's right
[47:57] why because it's our
[48:00] life that's why our father made
[48:05] us when we think about what we were
[48:09] before message we were like
[48:15] bums but the Lord have picked each one
[48:18] of
[48:19] us and the Lord shaped
[48:24] us and now we become partaker of his
[48:27] divine
[48:30] nature and I would like to say
[48:34] something ungratefulness
[48:37] today it's a sign of the end
[48:41] time
[48:43] ungratefulness because the scripture
[48:45] says that in the last
[48:48] day people will be
[48:51] unthankful they will be without
[48:54] religion they will be enemy of people of
[48:58] good and this is what we are
[49:02] witnessing and in this time that we
[49:05] live brother Bram
[49:09] says that it's rare for you to find
[49:14] love and you will find true love only
[49:17] where true Christian
[49:20] are that's why the true
[49:23] Thanksgiving always come on only from
[49:26] the
[49:27] believer
[49:31] because people will begin to
[49:35] Feast some will be taking beers right
[49:38] some will be drinking
[49:41] alcohol some will go to a prostitute
[49:44] house people will be telling
[49:47] lies we will see women dress ill in know
[49:53] wrong
[49:54] way and it becomes just a custom without
[49:59] but for
[50:00] us when we say thank you to the
[50:03] Lord we are bringing it from the bottom
[50:06] of our
[50:08] heart and God himself can
[50:11] witness that we are expressing unto him
[50:14] our true
[50:20] feeling oh
[50:24] Lord
[50:25] this is where I'm going to base my
[50:27] sermon
[50:30] tonight I'm going to read in the sermon
[50:33] Watchman
[50:35] of and I'm going to use this as a
[50:38] foundation listen to what brother Bram
[50:40] says brother Bram says
[50:43] this I believe you still
[50:46] following Watchmen word of the
[50:50] night November
[50:52] 1958 Jeffersonville in Jeffersonville
[50:57] brother Bram says this in paragraph
[51:00] 98 brother Bram was praying
[51:04] actually he say at this
[51:08] time that darkness is upon the face of
[51:11] the
[51:13] Earth where everywhere is speaking of
[51:17] Destruction Lord God we
[51:24] are we don't even know how to express
[51:27] our
[51:29] feelings our
[51:32] Thanksgiving
[51:35] an an acknowledgement from our
[51:39] heart from the very fact that Christ
[51:42] came down from
[51:46] glory and was made flesh human being
[51:49] like
[51:51] us and he dwelt and live among us and
[51:57] then when he died for our
[52:00] sins he went through
[52:04] paradise and he took the souls that were
[52:06] waiting for
[52:09] him he broke he broke every spiritual
[52:14] powers that the devil was banding the
[52:19] Earth and he opened
[52:23] way that the light of the Eternal grace
[52:26] of
[52:30] God May shine upon those that would like
[52:34] to receive
[52:37] it people that were predestinated to
[52:40] receive
[52:42] that that's why we say thank you
[52:46] Lord and even the sermon that I'm just
[52:49] about
[52:50] to it's a way to express my Thanksgiving
[52:53] to the Lord
[52:57] that's why
[52:59] myself let me start and I'm going to say
[53:02] Thank You
[53:03] Lord thank you
[53:05] Pastor and thank you
[53:08] Church may God richly bless
[53:12] you let's go straight to our
[53:17] scripture let's go straight to the
[53:19] scripture
[53:20] Matthew Matthew chapter
[53:24] 13
[53:26] verse 10 and
[53:28] 11 Matthew 13 10 and
[53:33] 11 10 and
[53:36] 11 and then 16
[53:42] 17 the disciple came and said unto
[53:47] him why speakest thou unto them in
[53:53] Parables he answered
[53:59] and said unto them because it's given
[54:01] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[54:03] kingdom of
[54:05] heaven but to them it's not
[54:10] given this is a privilege the Lord have
[54:13] given to
[54:17] us do you know when you say Amen it
[54:20] means so be
[54:23] it it's another way to say Thank You
[54:26] [Music]
[54:29] Lord parag
[54:36] says verse 16 and
[54:43] 17 but blessed are your eyes for they
[54:47] see and your ears for they
[54:51] he for verily I say unto you
[54:59] that many prophet and righteous men have
[55:01] desired to see those things which you
[55:03] see and have not seen
[55:07] them and to hear those things which ye
[55:10] hear and have not heard
[55:13] them Paul would like to hear what you
[55:16] hear
[55:18] evenes and Elijah all of
[55:21] them he was not given unto them only
[55:25] unto
[55:28] us oh oh Lord Jesus oh oh
[55:35] Jesus
[55:39] sometimes it put you into
[55:42] a sitation where you want to
[55:46] cry sometime you want to roll on the
[55:49] floor because it's so
[55:51] great John chapter 2
[55:55] The Book of John
[55:57] chapter John Chapter
[56:00] 2 Verse 18 to verse
[56:09] 20 then answer the Jews and say unto him
[56:13] what son showest thou unto us seeing
[56:16] that that does these
[56:18] things Jesus
[56:22] answered and say unto them destroy this
[56:25] Temple and in three days I will raise it
[56:30] up since Coral people will always have a
[56:33] caral
[56:35] understanding watch what they're going
[56:37] to
[56:37] reply then they say the
[56:43] Jews 46 years was this temple in
[56:49] building and will die we it up in three
[56:53] days but
[56:58] he spake of the Temple of his
[57:04] body when therefore he was risen from
[57:07] the
[57:09] dead his disciple remembered that he
[57:12] said this unto
[57:16] them scripture and the word which Jesus
[57:19] has
[57:21] said all of
[57:23] this
[57:25] the words of God the secrets of God it's
[57:29] only for his
[57:35] seed let's go to John
[57:48] 5 the Bible says search the scripture
[57:51] for in them you think you have eternal
[57:53] life and they are day which testify of
[57:59] me and you will not come to me that you
[58:01] might have
[58:04] life let's go to John Chapter 2 uh
[58:08] chapter
[58:12] 12 I'm going to pull them up together
[58:23] as
[58:28] John 12: 20 and there were certain
[58:30] Greeks among them that came up to
[58:32] worship at the feast the same came
[58:34] therefore to philli which was a bsid of
[58:37] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[58:40] would see
[58:44] Jesus that's why to see Jesus you must
[58:47] always have someone to
[58:50] lead in this age William Mar Bram l to
[58:57] Jesus that's
[58:59] why the Jesus that we are
[59:02] worshiping it's not the same Jesus that
[59:05] denomination are
[59:07] worshiping they
[59:09] are looking at
[59:12] Jerusalem Jesus that we are worshiping
[59:15] is
[59:16] not he is in the midst of
[59:20] us
[59:23] amen have the letter but we we have the
[59:28] Revelation and the Bible says that the
[59:31] letter
[59:32] kth it's the spirit that make
[59:37] life hallelujah
[59:47] hallelujah Philip cometh and tell Andrew
[59:50] and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus
[59:54] now listen to the answer of
[59:56] Jesus and
[1:00:00] Jesus saying the hour is come that the
[1:00:03] son of man should be
[1:00:06] glorified verily verily and say unto
[1:00:13] you except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:00:16] ground and
[1:00:19] die but if he dies he bringeth forth
[1:00:23] much fruit
[1:00:25] the Greek that came to see
[1:00:29] Jesus and then Jesus begin to talk to
[1:00:32] them about Bad Seeds
[1:00:37] agriculture if a gra wood if a corn of
[1:00:40] wheat doesn't fall on the ground and
[1:00:42] dies they were lost
[1:00:45] completely but we know what it
[1:00:49] means amen
[1:00:51] amen Jesus oh Jesus
[1:00:56] let's go to Revelation one I'm going to
[1:00:58] add one
[1:00:59] more and then I would let you
[1:01:02] sit we already
[1:01:05] prayed Revelation 1 verse
[1:01:09] 6 Revelation 1 verse

[1:01:16] this I believe you are with
[1:01:21] me I'm looking for verse six

[1:02:19] Age and this title I got it from
[1:02:23] Brother
[1:02:24] I was inspired by brother bram's
[1:02:29] quot and I tried to study in the
[1:02:35] message brother called this age the
[1:02:37] Golden
[1:02:39] Age so tonight together let's discover
[1:02:43] one brother Bram says
[1:02:47] this in the book of the church Ages page
[1:02:51] 34 brother Bram says this we yes
[1:02:55] page 34 seven Church
[1:02:58] edes what is brother brandham saying he
[1:03:01] says he
[1:03:03] say there are certain
[1:03:08] truth that we must insist upon
[1:03:15] it are
[1:03:17] truth that we must insist on
[1:03:21] it amen amen
[1:03:27] and I would like to tell you
[1:03:32] this that the message about the Seven
[1:03:38] Seals it's not destinated to
[1:03:42] the it's not destinated to the
[1:03:50] denomination for the of the end time
[1:03:56] that's why brother Bram
[1:03:59] says in the message God only chosen
[1:04:04] place that's the of the end time is not
[1:04:10] from it's true we are in the age
[1:04:14] of but we are already came
[1:04:18] out because whatever happened in doesn't
[1:04:22] matter to us
[1:04:24] because we receive a
[1:04:26] message which is a
[1:04:29] calling what kind of calling it's a
[1:04:32] calling to come out and this
[1:04:36] message is taking us out
[1:04:39] of and it's placing us into a
[1:04:43] mystery which is the mystery of the
[1:04:45] going
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:51] away that's why you will well understand
[1:04:56] why did I use the title The Golden
[1:05:00] Age event made clear by prophecy
[1:05:04] brother paragraph
[1:05:10] 56 we are not living in a Pentecostal
[1:05:14] age listen to me
[1:05:17] carefully for the Salvation of the
[1:05:20] Nations
[1:05:22] God uh
[1:05:25] already predestinated seven Church ages
[1:05:29] from ephes all the way to it's seven but
[1:05:35] brother that we are
[1:05:38] not in a pcal
[1:05:41] age we are living in another
[1:05:46] age every time God sent the promise on
[1:05:51] Earth God is always on time to fulfill
[1:05:55] it but every time God to fulfill his
[1:06:00] promise God is
[1:06:02] always his people is the one
[1:06:05] being that's why to every
[1:06:08] time it's always a long suffering in
[1:06:12] over
[1:06:13] time in
[1:06:15] Egypt God say 400 years but there was 40
[1:06:19] more
[1:06:20] years because when God is the people was
[1:06:25] even in
[1:06:29] this coming of he already passed through
[1:06:35] why because we were not ready
[1:06:38] yet I want you to be
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] ready
[1:06:46] hallelujah amen
[1:06:49] amen that's why brother
[1:06:53] say we are not living in a
[1:06:57] Pentecost it doesn't mean that we have
[1:06:59] another age that is following
[1:07:02] pente no because there
[1:07:05] will we call them the 11
[1:07:10] worker those that are coming
[1:07:12] late the
[1:07:15] message
[1:07:17] thatw it is not the message of
[1:07:20] Pentecost it's the message of the seven
[1:07:23] SE it is
[1:07:25] the since
[1:07:27] the after the seven Church
[1:07:36] ages this is
[1:07:39] why we are living in another
[1:07:42] age it's not a
[1:07:45] Methodist we are living in another
[1:07:49] age we are in the Brad age
[1:07:54] where the
[1:07:56] church is called to come
[1:08:00] out and it's gather for the
[1:08:03] rupture it is the message that is
[1:08:06] gathering it is the message that is
[1:08:09] uniting
[1:08:10] us the
[1:08:13] ration the
[1:08:17] body amen
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:22] hallelujah I believe you listening and
[1:08:24] you're understanding this that's
[1:08:28] why we are in the period to in a season
[1:08:32] to come
[1:08:34] out this is the age we're living
[1:08:38] in clearly
[1:08:41] brother I believe this is the
[1:08:45] truth and in paragraph 62 brother Bram
[1:08:48] says this he said
[1:08:49] now with
[1:08:52] patience we must wait for this
[1:08:57] because the prophecy that were
[1:09:01] given all of them must be fulfilled at
[1:09:04] their
[1:09:07] time now they have predicted these
[1:09:11] things because the author did it before
[1:09:15] do you know the author it's the Lord
[1:09:17] Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ and we are expecting him to do it
[1:09:26] again what kind of time we living
[1:09:29] in it's like a
[1:09:33] calendar when you look at the calendar
[1:09:35] you want to make sure which day you you
[1:09:38] are living
[1:09:40] in and the same way you are Consulting
[1:09:43] the
[1:09:45] Bible to see in which age you are living
[1:09:50] in we are not living in a Methodist
[1:09:54] or a
[1:09:56] Baptist we are in the broad
[1:10:00] Age The
[1:10:03] Calling to bring her back to
[1:10:07] God through a
[1:10:10] channel that he promised to use to bring
[1:10:13] the Brad back what is that channel
[1:10:17] William Mar
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:21] BR that's why when I'm talking
[1:10:25] I don't have a new message to give
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:29] you the work ofion
[1:10:35] for letter by letter Willi
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:42] Mar nothing to add nothing to take
[1:10:49] away if it's
[1:10:52] a and somebody saying there
[1:10:55] is you need to swallow
[1:10:58] that come from Brother take
[1:11:02] it no one have a
[1:11:05] right to correct a major
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:13] prophet
[1:11:16] brother I
[1:11:19] love not because he's a
[1:11:22] great he believe everything that
[1:11:25] is he believe everything that I
[1:11:29] said even though brother was not
[1:11:32] understanding he always say
[1:11:35] amen that's why we here in this
[1:11:39] time
[1:11:41] either
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:48] nothing amen
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:55] if you want to agree with me repeat
[1:11:59] brother this is the only
[1:12:03] Channel when he had the
[1:12:07] vision when he had the
[1:12:10] vision says that
[1:12:13] the fit his
[1:12:16] hand and only his
[1:12:19] hand harmonize with the sword not
[1:12:25] not me not you only his hand
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:33] fit amen amen amen amen amen
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] amen we cannot correct
[1:12:46] God
[1:12:49] said that we are living in the calling
[1:12:52] out time
[1:12:55] and it's putting us in the mystery of
[1:12:57] the
[1:13:00] departure explain that in the Feast of
[1:13:02] the
[1:13:03] trumpet listen to me
[1:13:06] carefully in this Natural
[1:13:09] Life to respect somebody really
[1:13:13] good you must know that person
[1:13:17] first you must have a revelation about
[1:13:20] that
[1:13:22] person that's
[1:13:26] why you might meet the governor of North
[1:13:30] Carolina if you don't know
[1:13:32] him you might greet him like anybody
[1:13:35] else and sometime he will be the one
[1:13:37] greeting you he will say hey and you say
[1:13:42] hello and you just walk out walk
[1:13:45] away why because you don't know who he
[1:13:49] is but if somebody
[1:13:51] tells do you know who just pass you back
[1:13:55] that's the government that's the
[1:13:56] government of North do you know what you
[1:13:59] will change your your your behavior
[1:14:03] quickly you will change your behavior
[1:14:07] quickly amen
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:12] yes because when you have the revelation
[1:14:14] of the
[1:14:15] person it brings
[1:14:18] confidence
[1:14:21] at if I knew this
[1:14:25] I would have explained him or asked him
[1:14:27] some
[1:14:32] questions and if you have a chance to
[1:14:35] meet him again the second time you will
[1:14:37] change your
[1:14:42] attitude you will change your
[1:14:46] attitude do you know why denomination
[1:14:49] are the way they
[1:14:51] are brother say domination are against
[1:14:56] God they are what they
[1:15:01] are have the true revelation of the God
[1:15:04] they're
[1:15:09] worshiping they are in the
[1:15:11] history but we we are in the actuality
[1:15:15] the very
[1:15:19] thing
[1:15:20] am M if you read the message
[1:15:25] brother BR was
[1:15:27] speaking Jesus in the
[1:15:30] East can you give that to a
[1:15:33] Pentecost what is the Jesus of
[1:15:37] the the Jesus of the East is the man
[1:15:40] that was born out of
[1:15:42] Mary in that body the fullness of the
[1:15:45] godhead was
[1:15:47] B and he only worked in
[1:15:51] Israel his ministry was
[1:15:55] only work in
[1:15:56] isra and he stopped there
[1:15:59] in but the Jesus that came on the on the
[1:16:02] west who is
[1:16:05] it is not the body physical
[1:16:08] body is the spirit of the
[1:16:11] Lord that was making that
[1:16:14] body
[1:16:16] that the body of
[1:16:19] Jesus and that Spirit
[1:16:22] came then begin to seek for other
[1:16:26] vessels vessels that were
[1:16:29] predestinated and every time he found
[1:16:32] one of those
[1:16:34] vessels dwell in those
[1:16:37] vessels he would repeat the same thing
[1:16:40] in
[1:16:42] those when he was in gilee that's
[1:16:46] why the ministry of
[1:16:49] Jesus was only one
[1:16:51] person min on the
[1:16:54] West in the evening
[1:16:56] time it is in many
[1:16:59] members in
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:09] in all over the
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:17] world you cannot worship something you
[1:17:20] don't
[1:17:22] know
[1:17:24] know that in
[1:17:26] every God change
[1:17:29] mask God change
[1:17:31] fail but he doesn't change his
[1:17:38] character amen
[1:17:40] amen that's
[1:17:43] why when you have a revelation about the
[1:17:46] individual he brings
[1:17:49] confidence he brings
[1:17:52] assurance
[1:17:53] he brings
[1:17:55] conviction and
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] determination that's
[1:18:02] why it's the same for the
[1:18:06] worship the church that we
[1:18:10] are we must have the
[1:18:13] Revelation about
[1:18:17] yourself you must know who you are when
[1:18:20] you are in this church no
[1:18:24] we we are not
[1:18:27] here because we must be in a certain
[1:18:29] Church no no that's not the reason why
[1:18:32] we
[1:18:32] here we know why we
[1:18:36] here that's why a
[1:18:39] church to worship
[1:18:42] God that church must have a revelation
[1:18:46] upon upon its
[1:18:50] message upon a revelation of of
[1:18:54] his and the revelation of your
[1:18:58] messenger and you must have also a
[1:19:00] revelation of the god you trying to
[1:19:03] worship and we must
[1:19:09] understand we are living in the most
[1:19:12] glorious age than any other
[1:19:18] age since God created heaven and earth
[1:19:21] in this earth
[1:19:24] God never sent a prophet like
[1:19:27] brother no Prophet matches
[1:19:30] brother the only one that Matti it's
[1:19:33] only John the Baptist but he was greater
[1:19:36] than John the Baptist bti because John
[1:19:39] the he didn't know the Silence of the
[1:19:42] seven
[1:19:45] seti John the
[1:19:47] Bap never even done one
[1:19:51] miracle
[1:19:53] he was kept
[1:19:56] somewhere for a Ministry for 6 month and
[1:19:58] that was
[1:20:00] it when he presented the Lord Jesus
[1:20:02] Christ that was his end God took him
[1:20:06] away but the one that we got in this
[1:20:09] end this is the revealer of the
[1:20:14] Mysteries not only the
[1:20:16] mystery even Mir even the
[1:20:19] Revelation all of them were going
[1:20:22] together
[1:20:31] amen we are living in a specific
[1:20:34] age we are living in an
[1:20:40] age where we have witnessed the
[1:20:43] Fulfillment of the sueme
[1:20:46] promise what is the Supreme promise Luke
[1:20:51] 1730
[1:20:54] if you don't understand that
[1:20:56] Revelation your Revelation is
[1:21:01] blocked and whatever the devil is
[1:21:05] doing is to block you to recognize who
[1:21:08] you
[1:21:10] are every time the devil want you to
[1:21:13] doubt
[1:21:17] yourself that's why you will notice
[1:21:21] Judas with Jesus three
[1:21:24] years who called Jesus Lord and then at
[1:21:28] the end he sold Jesus
[1:21:32] why
[1:21:34] why he didn't have the
[1:21:36] revelation of the person of Jesus
[1:21:42] Christ he went and sold
[1:21:45] Jesus because Judah say you
[1:21:48] know this man he knows how to do miracle
[1:21:52] I just
[1:21:54] he will never let anybody stop him he
[1:21:56] will know how to get himself
[1:21:58] away he didn't know who Jesus
[1:22:03] was you might live with somebody without
[1:22:06] knowing that
[1:22:07] person you can live with this and you
[1:22:10] call him pastor but you don't really
[1:22:12] know
[1:22:16] him that's why even in a local
[1:22:19] church you don't have a revelation for
[1:22:21] your your your Revelation is
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:28] blocked you call him your pastor but
[1:22:31] you're not the only
[1:22:32] one even the people online are calling
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:37] him sometime you will see people who are
[1:22:40] unbeliever will respect him more than
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:51] you he was calling AB little brother
[1:22:54] little
[1:22:55] brother he was calling him little
[1:22:59] brother know the worship he didn't have
[1:23:02] a revelation of
[1:23:06] worship he had a false Revelation about
[1:23:12] offering you understand
[1:23:16] well
[1:23:18] yes you can
[1:23:20] worship With all sincerity
[1:23:23] and yet to be
[1:23:27] wrong sry I have not even started the
[1:23:32] sermon I'm just the
[1:23:37] introduction I don't
[1:23:40] have because no Pastor ever finish his
[1:23:43] seron I don't know any Pastor that
[1:23:46] always sit and say I finish my
[1:23:48] sermon your pastor here he never finish
[1:23:51] a sermon
[1:23:55] he will start a title he preach hee just
[1:23:59] stop some and then he move on because we
[1:24:02] cannot finish
[1:24:04] God if you take
[1:24:06] God in the face of love you will never
[1:24:10] finish
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:16] God that's why when we preach we give
[1:24:20] the best when the chur
[1:24:24] and we stop glory to God we go
[1:24:30] home that's
[1:24:33] why it is not really the act
[1:24:37] of must worship with
[1:24:41] [Applause]
[1:24:43] Revelation you following
[1:24:46] me God's only chosen place of
[1:24:51] worship 1965 November the
[1:24:55] 28the
[1:24:56] preach where louisan in
[1:25:02] louisan
[1:25:05] says in his
[1:25:10] time spoke to some sincere people
[1:25:15] only the worshiper of that
[1:25:19] time sincerity alone is not enough
[1:25:23] you can be sincerely
[1:25:29] wrong the worshiper of
[1:25:33] that in do you worship
[1:25:39] me him from the bottom of their heart
[1:25:42] with all
[1:25:44] sincerity Jesus them you're doing that
[1:25:47] in
[1:25:49] vain teing for Doctrine Commandments of
[1:25:53] man in other word their Creeds from
[1:25:57] denomination they were
[1:25:59] sincere full of
[1:26:01] respect so
[1:26:05] religious it didn't start with Pharisees
[1:26:09] only we can see the same attitude today
[1:26:12] being
[1:26:14] manifested when we looking at
[1:26:19] and the first two worshiper that
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:28] see was SOC as much sincere as AB
[1:26:32] was but he lacked
[1:26:36] Revelation lack of revelation will bring
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:44] anger that's why he
[1:26:50] killed because revelation bring the
[1:26:52] freshness of deity on an
[1:26:55] individual upon an
[1:27:00] individual amen
[1:27:03] amen are you still following
[1:27:08] me that's why brother says
[1:27:11] this when I will start my sermon I'll
[1:27:13] tell
[1:27:16] you in the message invisible
[1:27:19] Union
[1:27:21] 243 brother
[1:27:23] say a man born of
[1:27:26] God a Son of
[1:27:30] God must have the nature of
[1:27:34] God he must be like
[1:27:37] God he honors
[1:27:40] God he's a part of the word of
[1:27:44] God and in this last
[1:27:48] day that this has been formed
[1:27:54] with the power that he started with at
[1:27:56] the
[1:27:59] beginning and that same power went
[1:28:01] through organization and so
[1:28:04] forth and has been manifested for the
[1:28:09] bride and then she can not be anything
[1:28:12] else but
[1:28:14] that that's why
[1:28:18] today a special message
[1:28:24] we had a special
[1:28:27] messenger
[1:28:29] and we also
[1:28:32] had speci a special
[1:28:38] brother so now let me start my sermon
[1:28:42] can I
[1:28:43] start I'm skipping things so let me
[1:28:45] start my
[1:28:49] message I don't have the sermon here but
[1:28:51] I'm just
[1:28:53] let me just take what is
[1:28:56] important brother said that there is
[1:28:58] seven
[1:29:00] Junctions yes that's exactly theun the
[1:29:04] first Junction it's
[1:29:07] Noah the second Junction it's Abraham
[1:29:12] the third it's
[1:29:14] Moses the
[1:29:16] fourth it's elah of the of the time
[1:29:20] of and fifth
[1:29:23] Junction is Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ that's where I'm
[1:29:29] starting and Jesus in
[1:29:33] his he came to deal with the issue of
[1:29:37] sin that's why he
[1:29:41] died and he uh pour his
[1:29:44] blood as a a price for our
[1:29:50] Redemption listen to me care
[1:29:55] Jesus never gave us the
[1:29:59] inheritance because we
[1:30:01] were from the beginning of the
[1:30:05] world and the Bible say we are jointed
[1:30:08] her with
[1:30:10] Christ so whatever Christ came to
[1:30:13] do he who was the perfect
[1:30:16] landet who he was the prophet
[1:30:19] godet not a prophet of God
[1:30:22] Jesus was the prophet God he was the god
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:30] Prophet Jesus was not a prophet of
[1:30:33] God he was the god
[1:30:36] Prophet or God the
[1:30:41] prophet because we we we lost that
[1:30:45] inheritance when Adam gave it to the
[1:30:49] devil and Jesus when he came
[1:30:52] he came only to pay the price so that we
[1:30:59] can go back and get back to our position
[1:31:02] before the fall and that
[1:31:05] position God already gave it to
[1:31:08] us before Jesus became the Son of
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:15] God
[1:31:18] amen amen
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:22] and the sixth
[1:31:24] Junction it was the the
[1:31:28] reformers Luther Worley and so
[1:31:31] forth and the seventh
[1:31:36] Junction is the biggest
[1:31:40] Junction more than even the junction of
[1:31:46] Jesus this is the crucial things right
[1:31:50] here how can can a Ministry be
[1:31:54] bigger because Jesus himself said that
[1:31:58] he
[1:31:59] that do greater
[1:32:01] work and he will do greater work than I
[1:32:04] do
[1:32:07] meaning if he
[1:32:09] resurrect we can
[1:32:12] resurrect and not only that
[1:32:16] brother Jesus in his
[1:32:20] time never added something out of
[1:32:24] nothing he always has a
[1:32:27] substance like maybe a
[1:32:29] bread and then he
[1:32:31] multiply or maybe some f and he multiply
[1:32:35] fishes maybe water and
[1:32:46] he the
[1:32:50] word
[1:32:54] hallelujah
[1:32:57] hallelujah it's the greatest Junction of
[1:33:00] all
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:04] Junctions that's where we are and just
[1:33:09] not that the scripture of John
[1:33:13] 14 is connected to Revelation 10
[1:33:19] 1-7 Hallelujah
[1:33:24] that's what I have been ministering
[1:33:25] somewhere
[1:33:28] else listen to me
[1:33:30] carefully the greatest Junction of all

[1:33:54] until I want you to be very to pay
[1:34:02] attention I am grateful to
[1:34:08] God to live in this end time of the last
[1:34:13] event of this world are you following me
[1:34:17] carefully I don't
[1:34:20] know
[1:34:24] I don't know if I would have have my say
[1:34:26] before the foundation of the
[1:34:31] world that God would have given me all
[1:34:34] his plan
[1:34:36] saying I want you to
[1:34:38] preach brother
[1:34:44] now brother say if the Lord would
[1:34:48] have in which age would you like to go
[1:34:55] brother if God would have asked me that
[1:34:57] question before the foundation the
[1:35:00] before the foundation of the world and
[1:35:03] say
[1:35:05] Bram I would like to send you on Earth
[1:35:08] to
[1:35:10] preach tell me which age would you like
[1:35:13] to go on
[1:35:15] Earth listen to brother
[1:35:20] br
[1:35:22] I would have chosen this age
[1:35:28] here because I believe it's the golden
[1:35:32] age can you say
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:39] Amen never chosen the time of
[1:35:42] Jesus but
[1:35:44] you you didn't
[1:35:46] ask God
[1:35:49] himself took you and put you as a
[1:35:51] believer of this priv what a great
[1:35:55] privilege God chose you for this age I
[1:36:00] listen
[1:36:02] [Applause]

[1:36:08] time when he was here on
[1:36:10] Earth in fifth
[1:36:14] Junction but I believe
[1:36:17] that
[1:36:19] now this is a greatest time
[1:36:27] why because this is the time that is
[1:36:30] coming to get those that he has
[1:36:33] redeemed those that Jesus
[1:36:36] redeemed in other word it's a
[1:36:39] time that the work is
[1:36:45] completed you
[1:36:48] know when there is a competition
[1:36:52] Sports and then your your team reach the
[1:36:57] final they don't put any kind of player
[1:37:00] in the final because
[1:37:04] losing we always they always choose the
[1:37:07] best in final the best team in the
[1:37:14] final and when they are making the team
[1:37:17] for the
[1:37:19] final they don't need any eror don't
[1:37:22] give room for error that's
[1:37:25] why God
[1:37:27] never by sending brother Bram in this
[1:37:31] God never made a Mist by Ching
[1:37:35] you as a brother
[1:37:39] sister Manifest this message in this
[1:37:42] time God never made a mistake about
[1:37:45] [Applause]
[1:37:49] you that's why brother Bram say
[1:37:54] today God is
[1:37:56] waiting and
[1:37:59] me word God is expecting something from
[1:38:01] us God is waiting for
[1:38:06] us amen
[1:38:09] amen are you following
[1:38:11] me
[1:38:15] yes because it's the time that is coming
[1:38:18] to get his
[1:38:20] redeem when the resurrection is is is
[1:38:24] closed the time that all the redeem will
[1:38:29] come what a glorious opportunity we
[1:38:33] have to speak to a dying
[1:38:37] people great
[1:38:40] time we areed about
[1:38:44] it it's in this
[1:38:46] time that God is calling you
[1:38:50] Christian that you are being called a
[1:38:52] Christian that's why I was telling
[1:38:55] you we of this
[1:38:58] age when we understand our
[1:39:01] position even if you walking
[1:39:04] alone you just say thank you Lord thank
[1:39:07] you Lord thank you
[1:39:10] Lord and then sin itself will get away
[1:39:13] from you sin will run away from you when
[1:39:18] you just say than you God cannot
[1:39:23] God cannot
[1:39:25] you God can never call you without being
[1:39:30] without already being equiping you to
[1:39:33] win the
[1:39:34] devil in this
[1:39:37] time is greater than the time of Jesus
[1:39:41] in the time of Jesus
[1:39:44] devil only had an experience of 4,000
[1:39:48] but in this
[1:39:50] timean have an experience for
[1:39:52] six that's why
[1:39:56] God reinforce the of
[1:39:59] this with the
[1:40:01] word that's why in
[1:40:04] this we have the fullness of the
[1:40:07] word that's why
[1:40:10] brother we have the we we are in the
[1:40:13] time of the double
[1:40:15] portion because our Lord
[1:40:18] know in this
[1:40:23] devil will be worse than any other
[1:40:27] age and then to mat the
[1:40:30] devil God will equip his
[1:40:34] bride and now we the become the word
[1:40:40] word listen to
[1:40:43] me Jesus one time went to
[1:40:46] the for 40
[1:40:49] years and devil went to tempt and
[1:40:52] brother
[1:40:54] said when the devil
[1:40:56] tempted he say he never used a gift to
[1:41:00] win the
[1:41:01] devil to overcome the devil he only Ed
[1:41:04] it's written it's
[1:41:07] written and in
[1:41:11] this have
[1:41:14] sopped the fullness of the word listen
[1:41:17] to me
[1:41:18] Care in the beginning was
[1:41:21] word and the Word was
[1:41:23] with and the Word was
[1:41:26] God and the word in
[1:41:29] the make you God that's
[1:41:33] why God is on Earth
[1:41:36] today in human
[1:41:39] beings yes God is already on
[1:41:43] Earth you canot have the word without
[1:41:47] having
[1:41:47] [Applause]
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:54] listen to me carefully
[1:41:57] why
[1:42:02] denomination
[1:42:04] why because the
[1:42:07] devil in the in the portion of the word
[1:42:11] that they lacked and that's why but in
[1:42:16] this anything
[1:42:18] we if the devil come here we are there
[1:42:22] here are if he goes here we are there if
[1:42:26] he touches here
[1:42:28] we and we say it's
[1:42:30] written he goes there we say we reply
[1:42:34] back it's also
[1:42:37] written
[1:42:39] Hallelujah that's why
[1:42:42] brother this
[1:42:44] message never be a
[1:42:47] denomination after this
[1:42:49] message
[1:42:51] denomination that's
[1:42:53] why we are in the mystery of the
[1:42:58] Rapture the work is already
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:08] done you know what gold
[1:43:11] means means
[1:43:14] what always speak
[1:43:18] about the gold
[1:43:22] age of
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:24] deity they went to see the Child
[1:43:28] Jesus the ma brought
[1:43:33] three
[1:43:35] and every gift
[1:43:38] have because God
[1:43:40] was was
[1:43:44] service and then mer spoke of
[1:43:48] death service to die
[1:43:52] that's why in this it's only
[1:43:56] the in other words
[1:43:59] it's manifesting himself in human
[1:44:04] beings that's why brother
[1:44:09] says that since God came down he never
[1:44:13] left the Earth say
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:19] that God is
[1:44:22] because you are on
[1:44:22] [Applause]

[1:44:35] Rapture don't miss the
[1:44:39] Rapture don't don't be caught up into
[1:44:41] the
[1:44:42] things don't be blinded by by worldly
[1:44:47] pleasure don't be do not be blanded by
[1:44:52] by men
[1:44:53] civilization brother Bram was born in he
[1:44:56] was an americ but he was not living like
[1:44:59] an American he was living like a
[1:45:02] Christian in this message there is no
[1:45:05] americ no French no Eng no Brazilian no
[1:45:11] African it's only children of
[1:45:14] God and our
[1:45:16] nationality we are only heavenly
[1:45:19] bodies
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:28] amen he say it's a great
[1:45:32] time we areed
[1:45:36] about and we know that history is
[1:45:39] closing
[1:45:40] out the world history will come to be
[1:45:44] over going to step into a new day to the
[1:45:47] great
[1:45:48] millenum that as one
[1:45:51] believer I believe in a
[1:45:53] millennium a millennial
[1:45:56] Reign Christ for, years
[1:46:00] Earth phical Return of the Lord
[1:46:05] Jesus to take a physical people GL
[1:46:11] glorify by his cleansing blood that's
[1:46:15] why every child of
[1:46:18] God that is living in this
[1:46:21] message you are living in the glorified
[1:46:25] why because it's the time of adoption
[1:46:28] Transfiguration it is the time of
[1:46:35] transformation amen
[1:46:38] amen now you begin to understand why is
[1:46:41] it a golden
[1:46:43] age you begin to understand
[1:46:46] now
[1:46:49] yes says this in modern event made clear
[1:46:52] by
[1:46:54] prophecy I'm just going to read
[1:46:56] somewhere
[1:46:57] here
[1:46:59] yes I believe that you are
[1:47:02] ready listen to me
[1:47:05] carefully more than event made clear by
[1:47:08] prophecy paragraph 2 and three he
[1:47:13] say I was expressing like brother Henry
[1:47:17] says listen to me carefully
[1:47:22] these
[1:47:23] men these men that have hair like women
[1:47:26] should
[1:47:28] have because this time today we have a
[1:47:32] world upside
[1:47:33] down we are men with long hair and women
[1:47:37] are cutting hairs it's a
[1:47:42] confusion brother says that's uh
[1:47:47] earrings all this time of earrings
[1:47:50] it's a sign of
[1:47:52] heathenism but today you see even men
[1:47:55] with
[1:47:58] earrings it's so
[1:48:01] complicated to tell is this a man or a
[1:48:06] woman men want to be like women women
[1:48:09] want to be like men so
[1:48:11] confusing yeah they change
[1:48:15] values you say those men with them hair
[1:48:18] like women should have you
[1:48:22] look like I
[1:48:23] see trying to have their kind of
[1:48:27] hair they even put those roller
[1:48:31] curlers around their face I don't
[1:48:36] know sometime I became
[1:48:45] discouraged I took my wife and the
[1:48:47] children to a a shop and and I saw a
[1:48:51] woman I said I told my wife I
[1:48:54] said is she
[1:48:58] naked Pap my my daughter Sarah say daddy
[1:49:04] you have not seen the worst
[1:49:07] Yet brother says here you follow
[1:49:12] me he say I was I became
[1:49:17] discouraged it look like a true time of
[1:49:19] perversion
[1:49:22] because when Grace AB sin also ab
[1:49:26] ab so just be
[1:49:29] careful don't be sucked into those
[1:49:35] foolishness men are trying to wear
[1:49:37] women's
[1:49:38] cloth and women wearing men's
[1:49:42] clothes and Men leaving their hair like
[1:49:45] women and women having hair like
[1:49:49] men
[1:49:59] really the very thread of decency and
[1:50:02] honor left this nation and these people
[1:50:04] this
[1:50:07] world now listen to brother Bram now
[1:50:10] after
[1:50:12] he he say this is a horrible
[1:50:15] time
[1:50:18] but it is the most
[1:50:22] glor it is the most glorious time in the
[1:50:25] world to preach the
[1:50:27] gospel if it's a
[1:50:29] glorious it's a message glorious he must
[1:50:33] be a glorious prophet he must be a
[1:50:35] glorious bride everything must be
[1:50:38] glorious and brother
[1:50:41] say when Jesus himself
[1:50:44] was there was not even one% in
[1:50:49] Israel knew that God was on Earth that's
[1:50:52] Jesus was walking and they were cing
[1:50:56] they said look at him a Bast child look
[1:50:59] look a Bast child that that child do you
[1:51:02] know about his mother he went and she
[1:51:05] got before she she was
[1:51:09] married and it's that man that took over
[1:51:12] the shame the
[1:51:16] reproach but when Peter was looking and
[1:51:20] are telling me and
[1:51:21] Andrew they say you are the Holy One Of
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:28] God that's why
[1:51:31] us no matter what the
[1:51:35] world no matter
[1:51:38] how that much they
[1:51:41] critici as a matter of fact even
[1:51:44] reinforce our
[1:51:46] position
[1:51:48] because
[1:51:54] the devil must fight
[1:51:56] [Applause]
[1:51:58] him even you even
[1:52:03] yourself the devil
[1:52:05] stop fighting you it means he won
[1:52:09] you but if you are
[1:52:12] always it means he has not got you
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:18] yet
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:24] amen
[1:52:27] amen it's the most glorious time to
[1:52:30] preach the
[1:52:31] gospel and
[1:52:33] today how many people in this United
[1:52:35] States knows that God send a prophet how

[1:54:25] this
[1:54:26] time not
[1:54:32] you if the church does not
[1:54:36] understand what God have done for the
[1:54:39] church in this
[1:54:40] time you will not be able to worship God

[1:55:14] out but they never even know that Jesus
[1:55:17] already
[1:55:18] left
[1:55:20] that's why they continue to do
[1:55:21] everything
[1:55:22] in they are singing in the name of Jesus
[1:55:25] Christ in
[1:55:27] Everything Jesus is not even minding

[1:56:00] carefully I would like to change
[1:56:03] now just for one
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:08] moment and to draw your attention to the
[1:56:11] king of these
[1:56:12] Eagles or these
[1:56:15] prophets all those Watchmen upon the
[1:56:18] tower
[1:56:21] when you say eag Prophet Watchmen it's
[1:56:23] the same
[1:56:25] thing because prophets are
[1:56:28] Watchmen and they are also
[1:56:32] Eagles
[1:56:34] yes it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:56:37] listen
[1:56:40] this and the day that we are living in
[1:56:44] are you following me are you following
[1:56:47] me listen
[1:56:52] this day that we are living
[1:56:55] in is more
[1:57:00] glorious than the day that Christ lived
[1:57:11] here you don't have to
[1:57:15] worry to desire to be like Peter or
[1:57:19] Andrew or the people that walk with
[1:57:21] Jesus let me tell you
[1:57:23] something do you know
[1:57:28] that let me say this do you know that
[1:57:31] today we know about Jesus Christ more
[1:57:34] than the Peter knew Jesus In the
[1:57:37] [Applause]
[1:57:39] Flesh why because
[1:57:43] Peter knew
[1:57:45] him just
[1:57:48] as on what they saw him
[1:57:53] doing and what they saw him doing after
[1:57:56] his resurrection and they stopped there
[1:58:00] but they didn't know that the spirit
[1:58:04] of will go through the
[1:58:08] ages and finish its course in the age
[1:58:13] of and then a prophet will come on
[1:58:16] the and bring up
[1:58:19] that were never been known before in any
[1:58:23] ages they didn't know about
[1:58:25] it and I'm going to tell
[1:58:29] them Jesus today is
[1:58:33] doing he never done even when he was
[1:58:36] here on Earth
[1:58:44] today don't be
[1:58:48] distracted God have given us a glorious
[1:58:53] position and we must be really thankful
[1:58:56] unto
[1:58:57] him
[1:59:00] yes says
[1:59:02] this when he was close to the
[1:59:07] Cross he spoke more about his second
[1:59:10] coming than his
[1:59:13] death if you search the scripture
[1:59:17] carefully you would notice
[1:59:21] just before his
[1:59:27] death he prophesy about things that
[1:59:31] should come in this
[1:59:33] time that's why brother Bram says the
[1:59:38] Lord Jesus
[1:59:39] Christ have more
[1:59:42] success in his ministry brother Bram
[1:59:44] Ministry than his own
[1:59:46] Ministry and brother Bram says this
[1:59:52] that what Jesus did
[1:59:54] in just
[1:59:57] in without counting other state and
[2:00:00] other
[2:00:02] count what Jesus did in
[2:00:06] Jeffersonville where
[2:00:09] brother Jesus never done so
[2:00:13] many but
[2:00:17] when the Holy Spirit did Miracle
[2:00:20] regardless of
[2:00:23] unbelief and did things just in
[2:00:27] Jeffersonville was greater than what
[2:00:29] Jesus did in his own
[2:00:31] Ministry
[2:00:34] and that it's not me it is Jesus in me
[2:00:39] that did
[2:00:41] it hallelujah
[2:00:45] hallelujah it is Jesus in me that did it
[2:00:51] amen
[2:00:55] listen seven Church
[2:00:59] ages those that come out of the
[2:01:02] bride only do his
[2:01:06] will no
[2:01:08] one can make them do
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] other they have safe the
[2:01:18] Lord or they keep
[2:01:20] [Applause]
[2:01:22] still when brother Bram doesn't say
[2:01:25] anything we
[2:01:27] har we speak when he
[2:01:29] speak because in
[2:01:31] thise God
[2:01:33] thought
[2:01:35] spoke and the
[2:01:37] word is the expression of the
[2:01:40] thought and the
[2:01:43] word and the spoken word
[2:01:46] that is the expression of the very
[2:01:49] thoughts of
[2:01:52] God
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:56] Amen they have that sa the
[2:02:02] Lord they know that it must be God in
[2:02:05] them to do the
[2:02:06] work fulfilling his own word that's
[2:02:12] why everything that God can do in you
[2:02:16] you cannot take the glory it is only
[2:02:19] God's glory why it is not theor it is
[2:02:23] not me it's
[2:02:25] not Jesus Christ Jesus in you Jesus in
[2:02:31] me it was Jesus
[2:02:34] [Applause]
[2:02:35] inam amen that's
[2:02:38] why everything that was fulfilled in the
[2:02:42] life of it's the glory of Jesus Christ
[2:02:45] but be careful in this age
[2:02:50] the bride share the glory with his
[2:02:54] groom why because
[2:02:58] today God cannot heal without
[2:03:01] me God cannot bless without God cannot
[2:03:05] save without he cannot do anything
[2:03:07] without
[2:03:10] me it is not really Jesus pray it is
[2:03:14] your pastor praying for you
[2:03:16] but when there is healing
[2:03:19] you don't go see Jesus even though it's
[2:03:22] Jesus you go back to the pastor you say

[2:03:51] desire his children to be glorified more
[2:03:54] than
[2:03:56] him Jehovah J 1962 I can give you the

[2:11:38] you
[2:11:40] himself it is his work mer thank you
[2:11:44] very
[2:11:47] much
[2:11:48] let's
[2:11:53] stand thank you Lord everybody
[2:11:56] happy everybody happy you cannot have
[2:12:00] the word without God in the beginning
[2:12:03] was the word and the Word was with God
[2:12:06] and the word is God and when the word is
[2:12:09] made flesh you become God we spoke about
[2:12:13] this over and over and the Holy Spirit
[2:12:15] is coming back to tell you that you must
[2:12:18] know who you are God didn't put you in
[2:12:21] this Earth at this time just hophazardly
[2:12:24] God chose you to be the best but you
[2:12:29] don't want to acknowledge and to accept
[2:12:31] that you're the best because you are
[2:12:33] looking at your failure and you are
[2:12:36] looking at your physical being and the
[2:12:37] things that you did in the
[2:12:42] past stop looking at yourself look
[2:12:45] through the
[2:12:46] seed look at what God had in his mind
[2:12:50] accept the thoughts of God regardless of
[2:12:54] who you
[2:12:56] are in other word accept the word
[2:12:59] because God's word is more true than
[2:13:02] your
[2:13:05] thoughts amen you can have an optical
[2:13:09] illusion about yourself you can look at
[2:13:11] this carpet and you say it's green
[2:13:14] because you're
[2:13:15] suffering until you get healed then you
[2:13:17] will see correctly and the picture you
[2:13:20] looking at yourself is not the correct
[2:13:23] picture you need some glasses and the
[2:13:26] glasses that you need is the word of God
[2:13:29] without glasses you have a blur vision
[2:13:31] of yourself without this message you
[2:13:34] have a blur vision of
[2:13:37] yourself look at yourself through the
[2:13:39] filter of the world Amen through the
[2:13:42] filter of the word then you will see
[2:13:45] exactly clearly what God in intended you
[2:13:48] to do because the glasses will refocus
[2:13:51] your vision the word of God will refocus
[2:13:54] your vision and you will be looking at
[2:13:57] yourself like an overcomer versus a
[2:13:59] coward or something else because that's
[2:14:02] what the devil has been using to keep
[2:14:04] you down amen let's pray Heavenly
[2:14:08] Father Lord we are approaching you again
[2:14:11] humbly
[2:14:12] tonight father thanking you for this
[2:14:15] Thanksgiving service that you have given
[2:14:17] us us
[2:14:20] tonight letting us know
[2:14:23] again that we are your
[2:14:25] brde we are joined her we have been
[2:14:29] chosen before the foundation of the
[2:14:32] world to be partaker of your divine
[2:14:35] nature in this same
[2:14:38] time
[2:14:41] father we didn't have the opportunity to
[2:14:44] ask you or to be asked by you about
[2:14:49] which age we should be living
[2:14:53] in you could have put us with
[2:14:57] Moses we could be probably part of the
[2:15:00] scripture tonight being read all over
[2:15:03] the world like Jonah and the other but
[2:15:07] father you heed our name even in the
[2:15:11] scripture so that the devil could not
[2:15:13] even read our name in the scripture
[2:15:17] because our name were
[2:15:20] Mysteries and you by your own counsel
[2:15:24] you determine and you chose to put us in
[2:15:27] this end time and you qualified US to be
[2:15:32] able to overcome in this
[2:15:35] age father may this
[2:15:38] Revelation be always
[2:15:41] fresh in our mind when we going through
[2:15:44] trial L when we going through our d
[2:15:48] time when things are
[2:15:51] complicated that that revelation will
[2:15:53] always flash like a beacon in the midst
[2:15:56] of
[2:15:58] Darkness Illuminating our mind that
[2:16:02] remember I chose you before the
[2:16:05] foundation of the word because I know
[2:16:08] that you can make it I know what I place
[2:16:11] in you I know the potential I know the
[2:16:15] struggle that you went through I am the
[2:16:17] one who chose you in that family I am
[2:16:20] the one who chose you to be born the way
[2:16:22] you were born I am the one who picked
[2:16:24] the trial that you're going to go
[2:16:26] through because I knew what I put in you
[2:16:30] and your trial is what will
[2:16:33] take the potential to be
[2:16:36] unfolded exactly the way as are planed
[2:16:39] because nothing will take us of God
[2:16:43] Luther was taken off God because of the
[2:16:46] portion of the word
[2:16:48] that remain mystery to him Wesley the
[2:16:51] same thing even the Pentecostal were
[2:16:54] taken down because of the mysterious
[2:16:57] part that they missed father but Lord
[2:17:00] you came and you pick all these losing
[2:17:03] and you unfolded the seals to reveal the
[2:17:06] entire word so that now there is no
[2:17:09] mysterious part that the devil can bring
[2:17:13] without the Brad being able to tackle it
[2:17:17] that's why Prophet scream and say that
[2:17:19] we have the devil answered father these
[2:17:22] things are that are not just cat they
[2:17:25] are the thoughts of God that were
[2:17:28] expressed Lord and father we want to say
[2:17:30] thank you for that and we want to commit
[2:17:33] ourself unto the hand for the remaining
[2:17:35] of this week that you continue to
[2:17:38] protect us protect us in the remaining
[2:17:41] of this week of Thanksgiving may we
[2:17:43] always remember what you did on Calvary
[2:17:46] and what you did on Sunset Mountain
[2:17:49] because sunset Mountain finished
[2:17:51] everything when you came down and broke
[2:17:53] the seals because
[2:17:56] now we are guarantee for the Rapture
[2:17:59] Lord give travel Mercy to your children

[2:18:05] they have taken Lord father in the midst
