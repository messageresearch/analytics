[33:02] how many enjoy the fellowship yesterday
[33:06] do you did you really enjoy it
[33:10] okay few people
[33:11] okay now i can tell
[33:16] amen
[33:17] that was
[33:19] very very very helpful
[33:22] a lot of questions we went through most
[33:25] of them probably there were two left by
[33:27] the grace of god so we'll catch up on
[33:29] the next time lord's willing but it's
[33:32] very encouraging it gives us a little
[33:34] bit of time we can sit with brothers and
[33:36] sisters just talk and laugh and have a
[33:39] sense of humor
[33:41] [Laughter]
[33:47] if you were not there yesterday you
[33:49] won't understand this code so it's a
[33:52] special code for those that were there
[33:54] yesterday we had a sense of humor
[33:57] amen
[33:58] so you better be there because we don't
[34:00] record this and if you're not there you
[34:03] are losing a lot of questions and a lot
[34:06] of answers and sometimes you might come
[34:09] back again and we already answered that
[34:11] maybe two three times ahead or something
[34:13] like that already in the past so make
[34:15] sure you can make up your time you're
[34:18] there it's not only for young people
[34:20] adults are there just give us a time to
[34:22] fellowship together and have a good time
[34:24] amen we go to work we go through a lot
[34:27] of things in life sometimes we just need
[34:29] to sit eat talk laugh and spend some
[34:32] good time and we go home refresh amen
[34:36] and you ready to start the week
[34:38] everything in the sanctuary is moving
[34:41] pretty good they already painted the
[34:43] ceiling i don't have the
[34:46] pictures with me maybe brother david can
[34:48] upload it and send it he probably is
[34:51] streaming today so
[34:53] the ceiling is really is already painted
[34:55] they're working on the walls so lord's
[34:58] willing brother mike daley this week
[35:00] right probably this week the walls
[35:04] all four walls to the best of my
[35:06] understanding if everything goes well
[35:09] should be completed so the trustee had
[35:11] to be there look at the color and like
[35:14] it because the trustees
[35:16] and they have to agree with it and
[35:18] lord's willing will finish everything we
[35:20] put up the chandelier and they look good
[35:23] and everybody loved them so either we
[35:25] keep it secret until you get there and
[35:27] you're gonna see it but everything is
[35:29] looking pretty good it's moving well by
[35:31] the grace of god so you keep praying for
[35:34] it we're moving slowly as the finances
[35:37] are giving us time but one of this day
[35:40] if the lord terry we will be in the
[35:42] building amen
[35:44] so we have brother daryl ward
[35:48] if you see him preaching today it's just
[35:50] a miracle
[35:52] if probably there was somebody else he
[35:54] would have
[35:56] dodged budget and probably not being
[35:58] able to be here this morning
[36:01] he had an injury to his foot
[36:04] and that happened if i'm not mistaken on
[36:06] friday
[36:07] and despite that injury his leg was
[36:10] swell his foot was swelling and
[36:12] everything he still say that i'm gonna
[36:15] get on the road and drive and come here
[36:17] so at least
[36:19] amen
[36:20] amen
[36:23] so he made it yesterday the lord has
[36:26] been gracious for him and he's able to
[36:28] wear a shoe this morning so but daryl if
[36:31] you feel like you want to take off the
[36:33] shoe take it out
[36:35] we are free here amen
[36:38] amen so he's preaching despite the pain
[36:42] this is a real soldier of god
[36:45] i have been looking for him i know him
[36:47] since the old church
[36:49] that's the first time i saw him and for
[36:51] some reason over the year
[36:53] it seems like when they were coming and
[36:56] preaching the lord was breaking into my
[36:58] heart
[36:59] their caliber and i knew brother wayne
[37:02] and i learned most about them so i knew
[37:06] him by face but could not put the name
[37:09] with the face so i didn't know that that
[37:11] was bodhidero so i kept looking for him
[37:14] and i could not locate him and i asked
[37:16] my wife i say
[37:18] who is that preacher that when he
[37:20] preaches there is an anointing that
[37:22] usually flows like oil
[37:24] my wife and my and my wife look at me
[37:26] she said that's brother there award i
[37:28] say are you sure he said by the day or
[37:30] what i say can you show it to me so we
[37:32] went to youtube and brother darrell we
[37:34] found one of your servants okay that's
[37:36] him i said that's the one i was looking
[37:38] for so i have to chase for his number
[37:40] and by the grace of god we got a hold of
[37:43] him so if you don't know him many of you
[37:46] should know brother daryl here but if
[37:48] you don't know him just stay up and
[37:50] you're going to see before the end of
[37:52] the service you'll feel like the
[37:54] anointing all is dropping all over the
[37:56] building amen
[37:58] that's brother darrell so if he goes
[38:02] into prayer don't leave early stay with
[38:05] prayer because i know his ministry i
[38:08] know how he preaches let's give him his
[38:10] time his liberty his freedom brother
[38:13] you're not a stranger you're a part of
[38:15] my family so you hear take your liberty
[38:19] preach like home take your time there is
[38:21] only one service and
[38:23] let's bring some deliverance from heaven
[38:26] amen

[40:22] reality amen with the revelation that we
[40:25] have in this hour we certainly know
[40:28] where he is amen
[40:29] and what a privilege it is to serve the
[40:31] living god to know that no matter what
[40:33] we face in life we do not have to face

[40:42] living god this morning and
[40:44] uh kind of an honor to be here we're
[40:46] grateful that we got to come and

[41:33] if you have your bibles turn with us to
[41:35] the book of saint john
[41:37] we want to read from saint john chapter
[41:38] 11 this morning starting at verse 17
[41:40] this little thought the lord gave us
[41:42] here just a while back and we trust to
[41:44] be a blessing to you and we just count
[41:46] it's such an honor to be able to serve
[41:47] the living god today amen

[41:56] could ever hope for
[41:58] knowing that he keeps his word today
[42:00] amen
[42:05] saint john 11 starting at verse 17.
[42:19] the bible says this
[42:22] then when jesus came he found that he
[42:25] had lain in the grave
[42:27] four days already
[42:30] now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem
[42:33] about 15 followings off
[42:36] and many of the jews came to martha and
[42:38] mary to comfort them concerning their
[42:41] brother
[42:43] then martha as soon as she heard that
[42:45] jesus was coming
[42:47] she went and met him
[42:49] but mary
[42:51] sat still in the house
[42:54] then said martha unto jesus lord
[42:57] if thou has been here my brother had not
[43:00] died
[43:02] but i know
[43:04] that even now
[43:06] whatsoever that will ask of god
[43:09] god will give it thee
[43:14] jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[43:16] rise again
[43:18] and martha said unto him
[43:20] i know
[43:22] that he shall rise again in the
[43:24] resurrection
[43:25] at the last day
[43:27] jesus said unto her i am the
[43:30] resurrection and the life
[43:34] he that believeth in me though he were
[43:36] dead yet shall he live
[43:39] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[43:42] shall never die
[43:46] believe us thou this
[43:50] amen let us bow our heads
[43:54] i want to speak to you for a few minutes
[43:56] this morning on go meet jesus
[44:04] heavenly father
[44:07] we bow in your wonderful presence this
[44:10] morning
[44:12] and we want to thank you lord for your
[44:15] mercy and your grace that's been given
[44:18] to us
[44:20] for thy word says that while we were yet
[44:23] sinners
[44:24] christ died for us
[44:28] lord we thank you lord for the privilege
[44:31] we have to come and serve the living
[44:34] god to know lord that there's no chains
[44:38] of denominations and organizations upon
[44:41] us
[44:42] but whom the son hath made free is free
[44:45] indeed
[44:46] [Applause]
[44:47] and we are gathered here under the
[44:49] liberty of the holy spirit today
[44:53] believe in dear god that you will back
[44:55] up every promise of your word
[44:58] [Music]
[44:59] that we will not leave defeated for we
[45:01] are overcomers in this hour
[45:05] bless your people here lord we pray
[45:07] bless our brother stephen lord in his
[45:09] ministry and use him in a great way
[45:11] bless the saints of god here today lord
[45:14] that no matter what need they would have
[45:16] god may they realize today
[45:18] lord their need may be the greatest need
[45:20] in the building but it's not greater
[45:23] than you lord
[45:24] so we cast all of our cares upon you
[45:26] today because we know you care for us
[45:30] bless your word today lord that when we
[45:32] leave the building may we say did not
[45:34] our hearts burn within us
[45:37] as you met with us along the way
[45:40] granted lord for we ask these things in
[45:42] jesus name
[45:43] and the bride says god bless you saints
[45:47] you may be seated this morning
[45:52] i want to call your attention back to
[45:54] verse 20.
[45:56] it says then that martha as soon as she
[45:58] heard that jesus was coming she went out
[46:00] to meet him
[46:02] but mary set still
[46:05] in the house
[46:07] i believe that these two
[46:09] sisters
[46:10] that we read about in the scripture this
[46:12] morning represents everyone that is in
[46:15] this building today
[46:18] for the way i see it we can do one or
[46:20] two things
[46:21] we can do like martha when she heard
[46:23] that jesus was coming she got up and
[46:26] went to meet him or we can be like mary
[46:30] and set still in the house
[46:32] because you see we're going to do one or
[46:34] the other things
[46:35] we're going to be moved by one
[46:37] atmosphere or another atmosphere
[46:40] amen jesus said where two or three are
[46:43] gathered in my name i will be in their
[46:46] midst amen
[46:48] you know many people come to church for
[46:49] many different reasons
[46:51] we know the devil comes to church to
[46:53] aggravate everybody amen
[46:56] but when he comes hallelujah when jesus
[46:58] comes the he comes in the power of his
[47:01] resurrection
[47:02] he sends healing in the form of his word
[47:05] he comes to pour out the holy ghost he
[47:07] comes to fulfill every promise that he's
[47:10] made to the believer he comes to bring
[47:12] deliverance he comes to bring healing he
[47:15] comes to bring forgiveness he comes to
[47:17] bring joy unspeakable and full of glory
[47:21] when jesus comes the tempted power is
[47:24] broken and when he comes we can either
[47:26] get up
[47:28] and go meet him
[47:30] or we can sit still in the house
[47:34] but i say to you this morning let's not
[47:36] sit still he's here his word says he's
[47:39] here amen
[47:41] he's hearing the promise of his
[47:43] resurrection let's get up let's step out
[47:46] let's possess what belongs to us this is
[47:49] our day this is our hour this is our
[47:52] time amen
[47:55] hallelujah
[47:56] the promises of god's word they are for
[47:59] us they belong to us amen when christ
[48:02] died in calgary every redemptive
[48:04] blessing belongs to the believer and is
[48:07] in our possession today amen
[48:11] amen we're like the sister in the
[48:13] communist country
[48:15] well they wasn't allowed to have church
[48:17] and the baker man was a believer and he
[48:20] would bake a certain bread
[48:26] he would leave a message to where the
[48:28] meeting was to be that night
[48:31] and so the sister went and brought the
[48:32] bread and she broke the bread and got
[48:35] the revelation
[48:37] of where the media was to be held
[48:40] and on the way to church she ran into a
[48:42] communist soldier
[48:44] aren't you glad we could still gather in
[48:46] the freedom
[48:48] but she ran into a soldier and he said
[48:49] where are you going
[48:51] she said my brother died and i'm going
[48:54] for the reading of the will
[48:56] and she goes to church and they sing the
[48:58] songs of zion and
[49:01] somebody gets healed and somebody gets
[49:03] saved somebody got the holy ghost
[49:05] somebody got delivered amen they had
[49:08] foot wash and then they had communion
[49:10] and oh my and on the way home she was
[49:12] singing joy is mine the holy ghost is
[49:15] mine peace is mine all mine just
[49:17] rejoicing in the lord and she ran into
[49:20] the same communist soldier and he stuck
[49:22] the rifle up in her face and said what
[49:24] did your brother leave you
[49:26] she said oh he left me everything
[49:31] hallelujah
[49:32] he left me everything every redemptive
[49:36] blessing belongs to the believer let's
[49:38] let the devil rob us of none of them
[49:40] amen
[49:41] i say to you and i brother and sister
[49:43] let's get up today and go meet jesus you
[49:46] see jesus is the answer to every problem
[49:49] [Music]
[49:51] amen i don't know who started covent
[49:54] china says america did america says
[49:56] china did i don't know who started it i
[49:58] just know who can stop it this morning
[50:02] hallelujah he's the inoculation jesus is
[50:05] the vaccination this morning
[50:08] you say i'm sick i said get up and let's
[50:10] go meet jesus i'm discouraged let's get
[50:12] up and go meet him amen
[50:14] [Applause]
[50:15] whatever you have need of this morning
[50:17] he is the answer amen
[50:21] you see all mary knew
[50:23] all that mary knew was death had come to
[50:26] their house
[50:27] sorrow and fear
[50:29] had all come to their house
[50:32] but martha oh my
[50:34] she called a revelation that caused her
[50:37] to get up
[50:42] now in our bible story
[50:44] death had struck this home of mary and
[50:46] martha
[50:48] and no doubt they thought how could this
[50:49] happen to us
[50:51] jesus is our friend he's slept in our
[50:55] spare room he's he's set at our table
[50:58] we're message believers
[51:01] we've left everything to follow him
[51:05] how could sorrow come to us how could
[51:07] the doctor's report be so bad
[51:10] we're his people
[51:12] we should never have trials we should
[51:14] never have troubles every day should
[51:16] just be blue skies and smooth sailing
[51:18] every day should be a picnic
[51:22] well those are real nice thoughts
[51:25] a sunny picnic does sound pretty good
[51:28] but you see the problem of it is
[51:30] jesus never promised us that
[51:34] come on somebody
[51:35] he never said we wouldn't cry
[51:38] he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he
[51:41] never said we wouldn't bury loved ones
[51:43] he never said we wouldn't suffer he
[51:45] never said we wouldn't get sick he never
[51:48] promised move salem
[51:50] he never said there wouldn't be storms
[51:53] he never said that but he did say
[51:56] i will never leave you nor will i
[51:58] forsake you
[52:01] and sometimes god allows things to come
[52:04] into our lives so that he can come to us
[52:07] and show us just how great he is
[52:11] you may have a great problem you may
[52:13] have a great trial you may have a great
[52:16] cancer but our god is greater this
[52:18] morning
[52:20] hallelujah he's greater than any problem
[52:22] this morning
[52:24] amen
[52:29] listen i'm not taking light of your
[52:30] suffering we have real tears
[52:34] we have real pain

[52:56] [Music]
[52:57] real tears

[53:04] but a real god

[53:08] but a real god who's bigger than all of
[53:10] it this morning
[53:13] hallelujah
[53:15] mary and martha in this great time of
[53:17] sorrow
[53:19] in this great time of need it was their
[53:21] darkest hour
[53:24] that was mary and martha just these two
[53:26] girls left alone in the world their
[53:28] mother and their fathers done dead
[53:31] and they looked to their brother lazarus
[53:33] you know as their security blanket
[53:36] the one who would pay the bills the one
[53:38] who would look out for him
[53:42] it was big brother he would take care of
[53:44] him
[53:45] now he was gone
[53:47] the world had come crashing down around
[53:50] them
[53:51] just these two girls left alone in the
[53:53] world the brother was gone they said in
[53:55] sackcloth and black veils and weeping
[53:58] and mourning
[53:59] over their brother
[54:01] it was the darkest hour
[54:04] but the prophet of god said it's always
[54:05] the darkest hour that's when jesus shows
[54:08] up
[54:09] that's just the way he does it in the
[54:11] darkest hour amen he comes alone just at
[54:15] the darkest hour it was the darkest hour
[54:17] that the woman with the blood issue had
[54:19] ever seen 12 years of bleeding and the
[54:22] bleeding would not stop she tried
[54:24] everything she tried herbs essential
[54:26] oils young living she tried everything
[54:29] but she couldn't stop the bleeding and
[54:31] when she spent all her money
[54:36] sold her land and everything then the
[54:38] doctor said he couldn't help her
[54:41] wouldn't it be nice if he told that the
[54:43] first visit
[54:48] it's to the factory got all her money
[54:51] and then he said he couldn't help her
[54:55] oh but i know someone
[54:56] whether i've got money whether i don't
[54:58] got money he can still help me amen
[55:04] it was her darkest hour when every hope
[55:08] was gone that's when jesus showed up it
[55:10] was jairus darkest hour his little girl
[55:13] laying it dead but that's when jesus
[55:15] showed up
[55:17] amen
[55:19] and it was the darkest hour
[55:21] that mark the god word
[55:24] that jesus said come you said brother
[55:26] now you know i want to rejoice this
[55:27] morning with everybody else but i live
[55:29] in such a dark time i'm having such a
[55:31] hard time you know what that's telling
[55:33] me it's just about time for you to get a
[55:35] visitation amen
[55:38] amen don't quit now just keep pressing
[55:41] on amen just break through the barriers
[55:43] amen there's a blessing for you this
[55:45] morning there's healing for you this
[55:47] morning there's joy here for you this
[55:49] morning there's deliverance here for you
[55:51] this morning amen
[55:54] hallelujah just keep pressing on amen
[55:57] [Applause]
[56:01] it was in that dark hour that martha got
[56:03] word that jesus had come
[56:06] you see martha realized the answer to
[56:08] her sorrow
[56:09] was jesus
[56:10] the answer to her darkness was jesus the
[56:13] answer to her fear was jesus she
[56:16] realized god had a way provided
[56:20] and jesus was the answer for everything
[56:23] she was going through he was the answer
[56:25] then he's the answer now and if there's
[56:27] a tomorrow he will be the answer
[56:30] tomorrow
[56:32] and when she got word that he had come
[56:35] she got up
[56:37] and went to meet him
[56:40] because the answer to her sorrow
[56:43] had come
[56:46] it reminds me of blind bartimaeus
[56:49] sitting there on the rocks of the walls
[56:51] of jericho
[56:53] he wore a beggar's robe that identified
[56:56] him as a blind beggar
[56:58] and standing there in the sun trying to
[57:01] get a few pennies
[57:03] he got to thinking about his life
[57:07] he got to thinking
[57:10] you know sometimes it's good brother
[57:11] sister if we just slow down a little bit
[57:15] and think about our lives
[57:18] what do you really want young man in
[57:20] life what do you really want young cyst
[57:21] in life what do you really want to
[57:23] achieve
[57:25] you look at most people that strive for
[57:27] riches and strive for success and
[57:29] there's nothing wrong with having money
[57:30] and nice clothes and a nice car thank
[57:32] god for everything that we've got
[57:34] but when that becomes our god there's
[57:36] something wrong with that
[57:39] and you look at most of the people that
[57:40] sells they're sold out for popularity
[57:42] and fame end up hanging themselves in a
[57:44] hotel room somewhere
[57:46] because there's no life and money
[57:55] but sitting there he got to thinking
[57:57] about his life
[58:00] and he got to thinking about these doves
[58:02] that he wants he said what happened to
[58:04] those doves
[58:06] oh i remember
[58:09] my little girl got sick
[58:14] and i went behind the house and lifted
[58:16] up my eyes to god
[58:18] i said father my little girl's sick
[58:23] but don't take her from me lord
[58:26] i need her
[58:29] i see the world through her eyes
[58:32] i hear a bird sing she tells me what it
[58:34] looks like
[58:36] the color of its feathers
[58:39] she tells me what the clouds look like
[58:41] in the different images that they make
[58:44] i see the world through her eyes
[58:48] if you let her live i'll give you my
[58:51] dubs
[58:54] and she got well
[58:56] and he kept his promise to god
[58:59] oh let us be like that if we make a
[59:01] promise to god
[59:02] let us do everything within our power to
[59:05] keep that promise
[59:09] and she got well
[59:10] and it wasn't long after that
[59:13] that his wife took sick
[59:16] perhaps it was a pandemic
[59:19] or whatever it was his wife had got it
[59:21] too and he slipped out behind the wall
[59:23] of the house there and he looked up to
[59:25] heaven
[59:26] he said father
[59:29] my little queen is sick
[59:33] and i need her lord
[59:36] don't take her from me
[59:39] she cooks my food
[59:41] she keeps my clothes clean
[59:44] she puts my cup where i can always find
[59:46] it she puts my fork in the exact same
[59:48] place so i always know where it's at i
[59:50] need her lord
[59:53] if you let her live
[59:55] i'll give you my lamb
[59:59] and she got well you know the story
[1:00:02] and on the way down to the temple he
[1:00:03] read it to the priest he said blind
[1:00:05] bartimaeus we're going thou
[1:00:08] he said i'm going down to the temple to
[1:00:10] give jehovah my lamb
[1:00:12] they said you can't do that you need
[1:00:15] that lab to help you get around you know
[1:00:16] they use lambs in that day like they use
[1:00:18] dogs today is it a service animal you
[1:00:21] need that service animal to help you get
[1:00:22] around sit here here take this money go
[1:00:25] buy a lamb and give it to jehovah
[1:00:27] he said i never promised god a lamb i
[1:00:29] promised god islam
[1:00:32] and if i give god this lamb
[1:00:35] he will provide a lamb for my eyes
[1:00:39] and set him on the rock that day you
[1:00:42] know what made me say that
[1:00:45] what inspired me to say that god would
[1:00:47] provide a lamb for me
[1:00:52] and sitting there on the rock thinking
[1:00:54] about those things he began to hear a
[1:00:56] noise
[1:00:57] he said hey what someone could you
[1:00:59] please tell me what's going on and
[1:01:01] someone said it's jesus of nazareth the
[1:01:04] lamb of god
[1:01:05] he's come
[1:01:06] and we blind barnabas heard that the
[1:01:09] lamb the provided way had come he began
[1:01:12] to cry out the lamb that's my lamb amen
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:17] and he began to cry out jesus thou son
[1:01:20] of david have mercy upon me
[1:01:22] someone said hey hold your peace
[1:01:26] we don't act like that around here we
[1:01:28] just
[1:01:29] we just nod our head if we agree or just
[1:01:31] a couple of fingers if it's an amen or
[1:01:34] maybe raise a hand for a hallelujah
[1:01:37] so you need to calm down we don't get
[1:01:39] but let me tell you any word jesus is
[1:01:41] there's always a lot of noise amen
[1:01:43] [Applause]
[1:01:51] and someone said hey hold your peace but
[1:01:54] the bible said he cried the louder jesus
[1:01:56] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:02:00] and the bible said jesus stood still
[1:02:04] but you see it wasn't his voice that
[1:02:06] stopped jesus
[1:02:08] he was more than 150 yards away and all
[1:02:11] the commotion of the crowd he would have
[1:02:12] never physically heard his voice
[1:02:15] it wasn't his voice that stopped jesus
[1:02:17] it was his faith that stopped jesus and
[1:02:20] if his faith can stop jesus your faith
[1:02:23] can stop him this morning amen right
[1:02:25] here in north carolina
[1:02:30] if his faith could stop him your faith
[1:02:32] can stop him the bible said that jesus
[1:02:34] stood still
[1:02:36] and they said he stopped
[1:02:38] and he calls for you
[1:02:42] now blind bartimaeus is left with this
[1:02:44] decision
[1:02:45] either set on the rocks
[1:02:48] or get up
[1:02:50] and go meet him
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:55] the choice was his jesus had done
[1:02:57] stopped the situation was set that the
[1:03:00] two ends had come together hallelujah
[1:03:02] the channel was open
[1:03:06] but now he would either get up and go
[1:03:08] meet him
[1:03:09] or sit still on the rock
[1:03:12] but the bible said that he casting away
[1:03:15] his garment
[1:03:18] he got up he took that blind beggar's
[1:03:20] robe and before he ever got to jesus he
[1:03:23] done threw it away
[1:03:26] he was already identified himself as a
[1:03:29] seer oh hallelujah
[1:03:31] he was already testified of his healing
[1:03:34] i don't need a blind beggar's robe i'm
[1:03:36] not blind amen
[1:03:38] i've got a lamb provided for me
[1:03:44] casting away is blind beggar's robe i
[1:03:46] don't need it no more can you see what
[1:03:48] he saw he was blind as he could be
[1:03:53] he saw more than most people standing
[1:03:55] around that day
[1:03:57] he was blind as blind could be but he
[1:03:59] saw a lamb provided
[1:04:03] and i say to you my brother my sister
[1:04:05] can we this morning rise up and step
[1:04:08] towards the promised word for our day
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:12] cast off the fear cast off asthma cast
[1:04:15] off high blood pressure
[1:04:17] cast off back trouble
[1:04:20] i don't need an arthritis rope i don't
[1:04:22] need a depression robe i don't need an
[1:04:24] asthma room i don't need a high blood
[1:04:26] pressure rope i've got a lamb provided
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:33] that's god's way provided for us the
[1:04:35] prophet said it's to go meet jesus
[1:04:38] got sorrow in your home go meet jesus
[1:04:41] got sickness in your home go meet jesus
[1:04:44] got heartache in your home go meet jesus
[1:04:46] hallelujah if you've got a need for
[1:04:48] anything
[1:04:50] go
[1:04:51] meet
[1:04:52] jesus go meet him
[1:04:55] he's got all the remedy and everything
[1:04:56] and then the prophet says he ain't got
[1:04:58] the remedy
[1:05:00] he got the cure
[1:05:04] jesus is the cure of everything that
[1:05:07] ails us this morning
[1:05:09] you know what the answer is for this
[1:05:10] nation it ain't the democrats or the
[1:05:12] republicans the answer for this nation
[1:05:14] is jesus christ amen
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:20] then if god
[1:05:22] provided a way for us to meet him
[1:05:25] there has to be a way for us to do that
[1:05:28] in the day we're living in or he
[1:05:29] wouldn't be just he would not be a just
[1:05:32] god to make us a promise
[1:05:34] and then not be able to keep the promise
[1:05:35] that he made us
[1:05:40] so if he made a way for us he sent a
[1:05:42] prophet in this hour to tell us he told
[1:05:44] us right here in the quote i read you
[1:05:46] the prophet of god said you got need of
[1:05:48] anything go meet
[1:05:51] jesus
[1:05:54] then there has to be a way for me to do
[1:05:56] that
[1:05:58] or he would have never anointed the
[1:05:59] prophet to say it
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:03] so when the devil will tell you there's
[1:06:04] no hope and there's no way and there's
[1:06:06] no future you're just telling me he's a
[1:06:08] liar
[1:06:09] i said the devil is a liar
[1:06:18] the answer to every problem is go meet
[1:06:21] jesus
[1:06:24] but in order to meet him
[1:06:26] you got to know where he's at
[1:06:31] if i told brother stephen brother
[1:06:32] stephen i'll meet you tomorrow at 10
[1:06:34] o'clock what's the next thing he's going
[1:06:36] to say
[1:06:38] we're at
[1:06:41] where you want me to meet you at if i
[1:06:42] don't he'll be at starbucks and i'll be
[1:06:44] at wendy's or something
[1:06:46] so in order to meet him you've got to
[1:06:48] know where he's at
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:51] now notice what jesus said in a little
[1:06:53] while the world will see me no more
[1:06:57] but you shall see me
[1:07:05] how lord how will i see you
[1:07:08] you see if there's a biblical question
[1:07:10] there must be a biblical answer
[1:07:12] little while the world see me no more
[1:07:14] but you shall see me how lord how will i
[1:07:16] see you
[1:07:18] for i'll be with you
[1:07:20] even in you
[1:07:26] then where is he at he's right here in
[1:07:28] this building right now
[1:07:30] [Applause]
[1:07:32] hallelujah just like he said he would be
[1:07:36] a little while the world will see me no
[1:07:38] more but ye shall see me i'll be with
[1:07:41] you even in you
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:48] oh god open our eyes this morning
[1:07:51] it's not something that's going to
[1:07:53] happen it's happening right now amen
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:01] someday some happy day i say why not
[1:08:05] today
[1:08:06] why not now
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] amen
[1:08:18] open our eyes lord let us see
[1:08:21] if we could ever get a revelation an
[1:08:23] understanding
[1:08:25] that all he did
[1:08:28] i went to the store the other you know
[1:08:29] everybody wearing a mask
[1:08:31] of course thank god we're starting to
[1:08:32] get away from him
[1:08:34] and i went into a store and i was
[1:08:35] sitting there and a man came in the door
[1:08:37] and he must have been a local
[1:08:38] because the lady behind the cast just
[1:08:40] said john
[1:08:42] you've changed your mask
[1:08:46] and when she said that how about had a
[1:08:49] spell right there behind the cheetos
[1:08:54] don't you see my brother my sister
[1:08:55] that's exactly what he's done
[1:08:59] the same god that was with jesus he was
[1:09:01] veiled behind the mask of jesus but that
[1:09:04] same god hallelujah is now veiled behind
[1:09:07] the mask of his people
[1:09:10] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:09:12] forever
[1:09:16] he's just changed his mask
[1:09:19] same character same god same power same
[1:09:22] holy ghost
[1:09:24] hallelujah making him the same yesterday
[1:09:27] today and forever
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:31] well
[1:09:32] we want to see jesus you can only see
[1:09:35] him in the manifestation of his word
[1:09:37] that's promised in the hour that you're
[1:09:38] living in
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] jesus said i'm the vine you're the
[1:09:43] branch
[1:09:46] the vine doesn't bear the fruit
[1:09:48] the branch bears the fruit of the life
[1:09:50] of the vine
[1:09:53] there's no beauty in the vine
[1:09:56] the bible said there was no beauty that
[1:09:57] we should desire him the beauty's not in
[1:10:00] the vine
[1:10:02] where is his beauty it's in the branch
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:12] nobody walks up to a grapevine and says
[1:10:14] my god look at that vine
[1:10:17] but we do say look at them grapes
[1:10:23] amen the the fruit of the branch
[1:10:25] testifies of the life that's in the vine
[1:10:28] verily verily i say unto you the works i
[1:10:30] do shall you do also and greater than
[1:10:33] this shall you do because i go to the
[1:10:35] father amen
[1:10:37] now we couldn't do nothing greater than
[1:10:38] raise the dead and open blinded eyes
[1:10:40] he's done done that but the greater it
[1:10:42] doesn't mean something greater than
[1:10:44] opening the blinded eyes or raising the
[1:10:46] dead it means more
[1:10:52] amen the mystery is not it's not in the
[1:10:54] it's not the quality
[1:10:57] the quantity
[1:10:58] the quality never changes it's the same
[1:11:01] holy ghost
[1:11:02] but it's the quantity what he did in one
[1:11:04] body he's now doing in a mini membered
[1:11:07] body around the world
[1:11:12] what kind of fruit would it bear it
[1:11:14] would bear the life amen and if we're
[1:11:16] the branch amen of that vine will bear
[1:11:19] the life that he bore when he was here
[1:11:22] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:11:25] in the person of the holy ghost
[1:11:28] manifesting among the branches
[1:11:34] the prophet said your lips are his lips
[1:11:37] when you're energized
[1:11:38] your hands or his hands when you're
[1:11:41] energized
[1:11:42] your feet is his feet when you're
[1:11:44] energized from the life of divine amen
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:11:49] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:11:51] forever
[1:11:54] for the glory of the lord i was in
[1:11:55] nicaragua here a couple of years ago
[1:11:57] there's about 600 in the meeting he was
[1:11:59] going to have a prayer line that night
[1:12:00] it was just so many i said this we will
[1:12:02] not have a prayer line we'll have a mass
[1:12:04] prayer for everybody in the building
[1:12:08] so i told the people lay hands on one
[1:12:10] another and i was on a platform about
[1:12:11] four or five foot off the ground
[1:12:13] something like that
[1:12:14] and just as i got ready to pray i told
[1:12:16] people lay hands on each other and bow
[1:12:18] our heads we'll say one prayer
[1:12:21] and just as i got ready to bow my head a
[1:12:23] voice spoke to my heart and said go lay
[1:12:26] your hands on her and i looked and about
[1:12:28] halfway back on the end was a sister
[1:12:30] with her hand up and the voice said go
[1:12:31] lay your hand on her and i jump off the
[1:12:34] platform and i go back to where he she's
[1:12:36] at
[1:12:37] and i've not prayed so people start
[1:12:39] peeking out of their eye you know to see
[1:12:40] why the preacher ain't praying
[1:12:42] you know how we do sometimes
[1:12:47] hey man
[1:12:48] i'm from tennessee you ain't too far
[1:12:50] from me
[1:12:56] and so i got back to where she was and i
[1:12:58] just put my hand in her hand and we
[1:13:00] begin to pray and the saints begin to
[1:13:02] pray
[1:13:03] and after service the sister said can i
[1:13:04] speak to you
[1:13:06] so through an interpreter i said yes
[1:13:08] ma'am
[1:13:09] she said tonight when you told the
[1:13:11] people to lay hands on one another
[1:13:14] she said nobody laid hands on me
[1:13:18] and she said i thought lord
[1:13:20] why don't nobody want to lay hands on me
[1:13:24] why don't nobody care enough about me
[1:13:27] to lay their hand on me and she said i
[1:13:29] begin to cry
[1:13:30] because i just wanted somebody
[1:13:34] to pray for me
[1:13:37] and she said i began to cry and a voice
[1:13:39] spoke to my heart and said i'll lay my
[1:13:41] hand on you
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:48] she said that voice no sooner spoke then
[1:13:50] you put your hand in my hand
[1:13:52] and begin to pray now friends i'm not
[1:13:55] jesus you're not jesus but i believe
[1:13:58] that the anointing of christ is in me i
[1:14:00] believe it's in you
[1:14:03] using my hands using your hands using my
[1:14:06] lips using your lips
