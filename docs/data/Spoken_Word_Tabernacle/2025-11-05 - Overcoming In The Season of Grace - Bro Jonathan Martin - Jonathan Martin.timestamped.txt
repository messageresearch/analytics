[0:00] The devil always looked in to find out
[0:01] what he was. One day they said, "If he's
[0:03] the Messiah, he'll he'll certainly do
[0:05] some strange signs." He said, "If thou
[0:07] BE THE SON OF GOD, TURN THESE STONES
[0:09] INTO BREAD." Messiah is a miracle
[0:10] worker. He is yet. He's always been
[0:13] certainly the Messiah was anointed one.
[0:15] The anointed one TODAY IS THE MESSIAH
[0:17] CHURCH. THIS CHURCH, this church OF THE
[0:19] NEWBORN, THIS CHURCH HAS COME THROUGH
[0:21] THE WATER. FAITH COMETH BY HEARING
[0:22] THROUGH THE BLOOD CLEANSED LIFE THROUGH
[0:24] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. Holy
[0:26] Ghost is the anointed one, the Messiah
[0:28] Church. GLORY TO GOD.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; WHY? MESSIAH CHURCH WILL HAVE SIGNS OF
[0:32] MESSIAH. HALLELUJAH. SURE. BECAUSE IT'S
[0:35] A MESSIAH CHURCH.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; It is the church of the Messiah.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; That makes me feel as good AS THAT I DID
[0:42] A WHILE AGO.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. A Messiah CHURCH WITH THE
[0:46] MESSIAH power with Messiah signs. Amen.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; There you are. That's where you have
[0:52] fellowship. Oh, there's nothing like it.
[0:54] It's perfect. Now, think of Jehovah
[0:57] doing a thing like that. Here he was.
[0:59] The devil looked at him and said, "I
[1:00] wonder if that really is the son of God.
[1:03] I wonder is that just an ordinary
[1:05] prophet or is that the son of God?" HE
[1:07] SAID, "IF THOU BE THE SON OF GOD,
[1:08] COMMAND THESE stones to be turned to
[1:10] bread." See, he was really an
[1:12] intellectual boy. He he he really knowed
[1:14] what he was talking about. But Jesus
[1:15] said, "It is written."
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Now, he take him up and kept trying him
[1:21] to find out. One day, he got him in the
[1:23] in the gentile courts and he kept
[1:25] wondering, "Could that be?" See, God
[1:27] really pulled the wool over Satan's eyes
[1:29] when that super sign came.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't know what he was. How could
[1:32] Jehovah be born in a manger? How could
[1:35] Jehovah cry like a baby and wearing's
[1:38] claw?

[33:46] Heavenly Father, such a great privilege,
[33:49] oh Lord, after last night's prayer
[33:51] meeting that we had. You took us into
[33:54] your presence. Father, we thank you for
[33:56] the leadership that, oh, Father God,
[33:58] brought this together, Lord, that we can
[34:01] gather and [clears throat] bless a time,
[34:04] oh Father God, where as a church, we can
[34:07] come whether it be by Zoom or together.
[34:10] We thank you for your presence that came
[34:12] down, Lord. And today is another day,
[34:14] Father. You've brought us into your
[34:16] house, Father, to come and hear from
[34:19] you, Lord. Lord Jesus, you are such a
[34:22] wonderful God.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; You've taken us from this muck of sin.
[34:27] Oh father from the world from different
[34:30] places in life just hearing my son give
[34:34] a testimony Lord Jesus that is the
[34:37] desire of its parents oh God here to see
[34:40] their sons and their daughters filled
[34:42] with the Holy Ghost. Oh God seeing that
[34:45] the ministry that we have here in this
[34:47] church is having an effect on the young
[34:50] people that they can see feel the
[34:52] presence of almighty God. The God of
[34:55] Abraham had to become the God of Isaac.
[34:58] The God of Isaac had to become the God
[35:00] of Jacob and the God of Jacob. So on and
[35:03] so forth. Oh God, each father had to
[35:06] teach his son. And that God did not just
[35:09] remain the God of Abraham, but it had to
[35:12] become the God of Isaac. The same
[35:15] experience Abraham went through, Isaac
[35:17] had to go through. Lord Jesus. So as it
[35:19] is today, these children will not go
[35:22] behind our coattails, but they have to
[35:25] have the oh God the same experience. As
[35:28] your prophet say, you do not have
[35:30] grandchildren, but you have sons and
[35:33] daughters of God. We thank you for this
[35:35] church. We thank you for the young
[35:37] people in the works that they're doing.
[35:39] Oh, Father, we truly see the word taking
[35:42] an effect in their lives. We thank you,
[35:45] Father. Thank you for the different Oh,
[35:47] God. uh testimonies that went forth. Oh,
[35:50] Father God. We pray now that the
[35:52] minister that will be coming, may you
[35:54] take them out of the way, Lord, and may
[35:56] you have your perfect will. Bless the
[35:59] offering, the tithe, the giver. We
[36:01] desire to give you cheerfully, Father.
[36:04] May you multiply the dollar bills in our
[36:06] account like you did with Brother
[36:08] Sherid. Oh God, like you did with all
[36:11] these other ones. Oh, Father, you're
[36:13] still the same God today. Bless the work
[36:15] that's being done. Miraculously, we're
[36:18] seeing the building being erected, Lord
[36:20] Jesus, just to show that you are among
[36:23] us. Father, we love you. We praise you
[36:26] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[44:53] working up a little bit. Then suddenly,

[45:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just move on with the service.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] [laughter]
[45:31] It was it was about two weeks ago, if
[45:33] I'm not me, two weeks or three weeks
[45:35] ago, they were the the the the builder
[45:39] came to pour the concrete and they were
[45:42] waiting on the inspector and the
[45:43] inspector came and push a block. It I
[45:47] mean it stopped right there and with the
[45:49] mixed cement and everything was mixed
[45:52] and everything was ready to be poured.
[45:54] They stopped they say we cannot pour. We
[45:57] need to There was a drawing that it's
[45:59] not our fault. The drawing was missed by
[46:01] the CD to look at the drawing or
[46:03] something like that. So now all that
[46:05] material that was wasted is on us. Don't
[46:09] worry about it. We got the God of John
[46:11] Shar. Amen. God will take care of it. So
[46:15] we say, you know what, the best way to
[46:17] do it, no more inspection when the poor.
[46:19] You come and do your inspection first,
[46:21] then we poor later. So yesterday we had
[46:23] a prayer meeting,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; a wonderful one,
[46:26] &gt;&gt; and we pray for inspection for the
[46:28] concrete slab and the footing. And guess
[46:30] what? Both of them pass.
[46:34] [applause]
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. after the rain and all the
[46:38] suffering of removing the the mud and
[46:41] the leaves and repositioning everything
[46:44] and and sucking the water out and you
[46:47] don't know what type of work was done
[46:49] here. But brother set, brother Michael,
[46:52] brother John, brother Robert, I don't
[46:54] know. God richly bless you and return a
[46:57] thousandfold for all the work and the
[46:59] labor that has been doing. Amen. So now
[47:02] everything is wide open to come and
[47:04] pour. God started this work.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[47:15] you go ahead and finish it.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I forgot. Brother Zach, I am so
[47:24] sorry. Brother Zach was there, too. My
[47:27] apology. He was there getting everything
[47:29] ready. Praise God.
[47:33] Oh my. My My apology. That's the problem
[47:35] when you start naming names. So now the
[47:38] next time I say the whole crew that was
[47:39] there. So I get everybody covered. But
[47:43] it is a big miracle that we cross that
[47:46] because he can't block everything. We
[47:48] can't move. And if another rain would
[47:50] have come, oh then it will be a disaster
[47:53] that you have to cover everything and
[47:55] water and get the water out because they
[47:57] don't even want to see a mud around the
[47:59] the the rebar or anything. So you got to
[48:02] remove the mud and everything need to
[48:04] look nice and neat and that's the job
[48:06] that was done by the brothers. So we
[48:08] thank you for everything and praise the
[48:11] Lord. Now we got the way paved so they
[48:14] can pour. Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there was a correction that
[48:18] needed to be done on the front u
[48:21] connector up there when they did the
[48:23] framing there. And we call on brother
[48:25] Solomon to come and do the work. And he
[48:28] say he will not charge us to do the
[48:30] correction. And brother Solomon is right
[48:32] there tonight. [applause]
[48:37] Amen. So, Brother Solomon, on behalf of
[48:40] Spoken Word, thank you very much for
[48:43] everything, for the labor and the love
[48:46] and the framing. It's it give you such a
[48:50] peace. You know, you're dealing with
[48:51] brothers and you are investing on the
[48:55] brother. they're getting blessed and
[48:56] also they're doing a wonderful job that
[48:59] you sure they're really doing the job
[49:01] from the bottom of the heart knowing
[49:02] that they're doing the job for the Lord.
[49:04] So God richly bless you for everything
[49:07] and may he bless your company. Amen. And
[49:10] may we prosper. If you need quote I got
[49:12] the line up and I got scripture line up
[49:15] so everything is good. Amen. So we greet
[49:18] you all in the precious name of our Lord
[49:20] and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and
[49:23] invisible audience. Any family members
[49:26] here God richly bless you and welcome on
[49:29] Wednesday to our convention at spoken
[49:32] word tabernacle. Amen. Everybody clear
[49:35] now with the wisdom of God.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; So when we speak about prosperity, we're
[49:39] speaking about the person of Jesus
[49:42] Christ. Amen. And that person take care
[49:45] of everything for us.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; He can heal. He can provide financially.
[49:51] He can raise the dead. He can do
[49:53] everything because he's our LA Leon.
[49:56] Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; If you ask for wisdom, then you get
[49:59] everything else. But if you ask for
[50:01] money, you will miss wisdom. If you ask
[50:04] for long life and you will miss wisdom.
[50:06] But if you got wisdom, wisdom will
[50:08] provide everything. That's why we seek
[50:10] first the kingdom of God, then
[50:12] everything. Don't stop at first the
[50:14] kingdom of God. Continue the verse. Then
[50:17] everything will be added unto. So if the
[50:21] first one is already fulfilled, so don't
[50:23] block my way.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Don't block my way for God to begin to
[50:29] add because I'm under expectation now
[50:31] for God to begin to add everything
[50:33] because the kingdom is already there.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The young men's remember
[50:39] we got a meeting on Saturday. Everything
[50:41] you know the place, you know the time.
[50:43] But as a reminder, brother Tony will
[50:45] probably put it on uh uh church group
[50:47] chat so you remember that continue in
[50:50] prayer. I usually give you like 3
[50:52] minutes to stay in silence, but that's
[50:54] just an exercise. But when you're alone
[50:57] praying, this is when you sit down 20 30
[51:00] minute quiet and you wait on the Lord
[51:02] and you will hear that voice begin to
[51:04] talk to you. Then everything will be
[51:06] you've been hearing in the message won't
[51:08] be anymore just quote. it will become a
[51:11] reality to you and you will learn how
[51:13] God specifically talk to you different
[51:16] than somebody else. Amen. But prayer is
[51:20] doing a lot of things and prayer changes
[51:22] things. Amen. So tonight our speaker for
[51:26] the convention is brother Jonathan
[51:29] Martin.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; This is your first time probably to see
[51:33] him here. He's welcome. He's the brother
[51:36] of brother Shawn Martin. If you
[51:38] remember, Brother Sean preached for us.
[51:40] He's a pastor in Virginia. If I'm not
[51:42] mistaken, he preached for us in a hotel.
[51:44] So, we've been hunting his brother for a
[51:46] while. And suddenly, the Holy Spirit
[51:49] gave us an open door. So, coming down
[51:52] from Ohio all the way there coming down
[51:54] to preach for us. Amen. So, Brother
[51:57] Jonathan Martin, welcome. I told him
[51:59] he's home. He's not a visitor. He's
[52:02] going to preach like home and we will
[52:04] pull like home. Amen. I don't talk to
[52:07] preacher about what they need to preach.
[52:09] I let them do what the Lord, what the
[52:11] Holy Ghost speak. So hear what the
[52:13] spirit say and you will see how God is
[52:16] working in a miraculous way. Amen. So
[52:19] forever only believe. [music]
[52:22] Oh,
[52:25] believe.
[52:27] [music]
[52:30] Oh,
[52:32] we believe [music and singing]
[52:37] all things [music]
[52:40] are impossible. [singing]
[52:45] Only
[52:46] [singing and music]
[52:48] believe.
[52:52] Only [singing and music]
[52:55] believe.
[52:59] All [singing]
[53:02] we believe [music]
[53:06] all things [singing and music]
[53:09] are
[53:14] [music]
[53:18] Lord. I receive.
[53:20] Lord [singing]
[53:22] [music]
[53:22] I receive.
[53:27] Lord [singing]
[53:30] [music] receive
[53:34] all things [singing]
[53:36] [music] are possible.
[53:41] Lord [singing]
[53:42] I [music]
[53:43] receive.
[53:47] Oh Lord [singing]
[53:49] I [music]
[53:50] receive.
[53:54] Lord,
[53:55] [singing]
[53:56] I receive. [music]
[54:00] All things are [singing and music]
[54:04] possible,
[54:07] Lord, I [singing and music] receive.
[54:16] Isn't that a tremendous thing to be able
[54:19] to say that we not only believe, but we
[54:22] receive the promises of God and
[54:25] everything that God has promised us in
[54:27] this hour. We are beneficiaries.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; We're beneficiaries of his resurrection.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; He not only died, he was not only
[54:36] buried, but he resurrected. That's
[54:38] right. And we are a part of the
[54:40] resurrection in this age.
[54:42] not a part of dead denominationalism,
[54:45] but we've raised out of that and
[54:48] &gt;&gt; we're a part of a living God and a
[54:51] living reality that God is in the midst
[54:53] of his people.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh it's so good to be in the
[54:57] house of the Lord on a Wednesday night
[54:59] and and uh we just appreciate uh your
[55:02] pastor, brother Stephen, for just
[55:04] opening the uh invitation to us to come
[55:06] and and uh we've just uh uh we've just
[55:11] been hearing about all the good things
[55:13] that God has been doing for you and and
[55:16] uh just been blessing you, prospering
[55:18] you, and and uh the building project and
[55:21] things. And uh I just say God just keep
[55:24] pouring it on.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I tell you I I I believe in the
[55:30] right kind of prosperity and [cheering]
[55:32] the the prosperity our our brother spoke
[55:35] of and you know I think that we are uh
[55:38] again beneficiaries
[55:41] and and uh I think God is just pouring
[55:43] out his blessings upon his people and
[55:46] &gt;&gt; and uh you know he's just going to keep
[55:49] pouring it out until we are not
[55:51] for God's going to take us home.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're not beggars in this
[55:57] life. We're we're kings and we're
[55:59] priests and and uh we we have a right to
[56:03] come into his presence and into his
[56:06] shakina glory. And uh amen. So uh for
[56:10] those of you who don't know me, I say
[56:12] God richly bless you. And uh we love the
[56:14] message with everything that is within
[56:16] us. And uh we believe that Jesus said
[56:19] that if I be exalted, I'll draw all men
[56:22] unto me. And we believe this message is
[56:24] Christ. And we're just trying to exalt
[56:27] this message so high
[56:29] &gt;&gt; above every problem, above every
[56:31] difficult situation in your life. And
[56:33] just keep exalting Christ higher and
[56:36] higher. Amen. I believe that's the
[56:38] anointing that is upon the church of the
[56:40] living God. And it's an eagle anointing.
[56:43] It's
[56:43] &gt;&gt; and it's just causing us to lose all uh
[56:46] just lose uh just just rise above all of
[56:50] our these earthbound senses.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so we bring greetings from
[56:56] brother Wayne and uh True Word
[56:58] Tabernacle there and uh at home. Brother
[57:01] Wayne's our pastor and uh so we just
[57:04] send uh just bring greetings to to
[57:06] everyone.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And uh so uh see brother Solomon back
[57:10] there. God bless you, buddy. Amen. And
[57:13] uh so we just want to go into the word
[57:15] now and we'll turn to Zechariah the 4th
[57:18] chapter beginning at verse one and then
[57:21] also Psalms 110 and verse three. And uh
[57:26] there's a lot of things that we can
[57:27] bring out of these portions of
[57:29] scriptures. Uh but we've just got
[57:32] something that uh that has just uh been
[57:35] dropped into our heart and we just pray
[57:38] that it'll be a blessing to you. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to speak on overcoming in
[57:43] the season of grace.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Zechariah the 4th chapter
[57:50] beginning at verse one. And the angel
[57:53] that talked with me came again and wake
[57:56] me as a man that is wakened out of his
[58:00] sleep and said unto me, What seeest
[58:03] thou? And I said, I have looked, and
[58:06] behold, a candlestick all of gold with a
[58:09] bowl upon the top of it, and his seven
[58:13] lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
[58:15] seven lamps which are upon the top
[58:18] thereof, and two olive trees by it, one
[58:22] upon the right side of the bowl, and the
[58:24] other upon the left side thereof.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So I answered and spake to the angel
[58:29] that talked with me, saying, "What are
[58:32] these, my Lord?" Then the angel that
[58:35] talked with me answered and said unto
[58:38] me, "Knowest thou not what these be?"
[58:41] And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he
[58:45] answered and spake unto me, saying,
[58:46] "This is the word of the Lord, and
[58:48] Zerupel, saying, Not by might, nor by
[58:51] power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord
[58:55] of hosts."
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who art thou, oh great mountain,
[59:00] before Zerubabel? Thou shalt become a
[59:03] plain sir.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And he shall bring forth the headstone
[59:07] thereof with shoutings, crying, grace,
[59:11] grace unto it. Ain't that a beautiful
[59:13] scripture?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He shall bring forth the
[59:17] headstone,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; shouting grace, grace unto it. Yes.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 110 and verse three,
[59:28] thy people shall be willing in the day
[59:31] of thy power.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that I'm speaking to that
[59:36] people, which is God's people,
[59:38] &gt;&gt; that we are a gentile bride that's been
[59:41] called out for his name's sake.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And so, the scripture that is he's
[59:45] referring or the people he's referring
[59:47] to is a bride. I I believe that we are
[59:52] that people. Thy people
[59:54] &gt;&gt; shall be willing.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; That word willing is meaning
[59:59] spontaneous.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. They will they'll be willing to
[1:00:04] move into action.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; In the day of thy power
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; in the beauties of holiness from the
[1:00:11] womb of the morning thou hast the dw of
[1:00:14] thy youth.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we could just bow our
[1:00:17] hearts in a word of prayer and maybe you
[1:00:20] want to be remembered this evening. Why
[1:00:22] don't you just make it known by an
[1:00:24] upraised hand? I know God sees every
[1:00:27] need. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful
[1:00:31] to be assembled in divine presence on
[1:00:34] this Wednesday night. Lord, we so
[1:00:37] appreciate the songs that have been
[1:00:39] sung. We appreciate the atmosphere that
[1:00:42] has been created. Lord, truly we
[1:00:45] recognize that you're in our midst. And
[1:00:48] Father, there's a group of believers
[1:00:50] gathered together, called out for your
[1:00:53] name's sake, Lord, we're we're
[1:00:55] recognizing that this is our time. This
[1:00:58] is bride time, Lord. And it's a time
[1:01:02] that we could ask for whatsoever we
[1:01:05] would and you would give it to us, Lord.
[1:01:08] I pray God that you would meet the needs
[1:01:11] of the people Lord and the request that
[1:01:13] is upon their heart father and move so
[1:01:16] supernatural Lord.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I pray God that there would be such a
[1:01:21] Lord just such a moving of your spirit
[1:01:24] just bless your children. We ask it at
[1:01:27] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen.
[1:01:32] God richly bless you. You can be seated.
[1:01:35] Overcoming in the season of grace. And
[1:01:39] we're very familiar uh with this uh
[1:01:42] quote in the invisible union of the
[1:01:44] bride of Christ. And you are wearing the
[1:01:48] wedding band of predestinated unmarited
[1:01:51] grace. That's right.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; A wedding band of grace unmmerited of
[1:01:56] your own.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; God did it himself.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the
[1:02:02] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[1:02:04] you there, put your name on a book.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I I think that that is a marvelous thing
[1:02:11] that the prophet would say that God did
[1:02:14] it himself.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; He would say in the message of of grace,
[1:02:20] he would say that grace is from a
[1:02:23] sovereign one. Sovereign grace is from a
[1:02:27] sovereign one. And God is that sovereign
[1:02:31] one. He is the sovereign king and he
[1:02:35] does as he pleases. He does as he
[1:02:38] chooses, as he elects to do. Uh he
[1:02:43] doesn't need to ask permission from
[1:02:45] anyone. God simply does it because he is
[1:02:49] sovereign.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we were chosen in
[1:02:54] him before the foundation of the world.
[1:02:58] And God being infinite and God knowing
[1:03:01] the end from the beginning. God knowing
[1:03:04] that you were in him. You were a part of
[1:03:08] his eternal life. Therefore, God forneew
[1:03:12] you. Therefore, he could predestinate
[1:03:15] you. And nothing is changing in his
[1:03:19] infinite wisdom. God being infinite, he
[1:03:23] never has had a new thought about
[1:03:25] anything. So God could predestinate
[1:03:29] because of his fornowledge.
[1:03:32] Therefore, he placed your name on the
[1:03:35] lamb's book of life. What a beautiful
[1:03:38] thing it is as the lamb's book of life.
[1:03:42] It doesn't have your deeds. It doesn't
[1:03:44] have your works. It just has your name
[1:03:48] because you are identified
[1:03:50] with the lamb. You're identified with
[1:03:54] his perfection.
[1:03:56] identified with his completion. So when
[1:03:59] we are looking at grace, we are looking
[1:04:02] at something that is unmmerited.
[1:04:05] It is simply the unmmerited favor of God
[1:04:09] upon your life. Amen. to think this
[1:04:13] evening that we are under the influence
[1:04:16] of the divine favor of the sovereign
[1:04:19] God, the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:04:23] Lords who is the amen. He's the final
[1:04:28] say. You know, I know the devil, he
[1:04:30] likes to think and and likes to convince
[1:04:33] us that he's got the final say over our
[1:04:36] life. But in this last days, the leoty
[1:04:41] age, we find that the amen of God came
[1:04:44] into the age. The final say, the the the
[1:04:48] the absolute authority over our life has
[1:04:52] moved into the age. The infinite ancient
[1:04:56] of days, the the one who knew you before
[1:05:00] the foundation of the world has moved on
[1:05:04] in on the scene to declare that the
[1:05:07] devil does not have the final say over
[1:05:09] your condition. He doesn't have the
[1:05:12] final say over your family. He doesn't
[1:05:14] have the final say over anything. But
[1:05:18] when God says enough is enough, let me
[1:05:21] just say it like this. The devil will
[1:05:24] never have enough. He's never got enough
[1:05:26] over your family. He's not got enough
[1:05:29] over your situations. WHEN GOD says
[1:05:33] enough is enough, then he changes the
[1:05:36] scene. Hallelujah. So, the devil WAS
[1:05:40] CREATED AND ALL OF HIS angels were
[1:05:43] created to just be an adversary. But
[1:05:46] that adversary is working for our good
[1:05:49] to mold a character that is fit to rule
[1:05:53] for all eternity. I tell you friends,
[1:05:56] it's a the GREATEST REVELATION I
[1:05:59] believe. Amen. That God has given us is
[1:06:03] the revelation that God lives and he is
[1:06:06] supreme authority over this bride. He is
[1:06:09] our headstone. He is Amen. He has the
[1:06:13] Amen. He has the amen, THE FINAL SAY
[1:06:17] over our lives. Amen. The devil doesn't
[1:06:20] have enough. You see, we are under his
[1:06:24] influence. Amen. For a people who could
[1:06:28] not help themselves. Amen. Situations
[1:06:31] that are impossible to change. Amen.
[1:06:35] Health situations. Amen. Impossible to
[1:06:38] change. AMEN. HOME situations impossible
[1:06:43] to change. But you see, when we come up
[1:06:46] to a mountain, a situation that we can't
[1:06:49] go over it, we can't get around it, we
[1:06:52] can't get UNDER IT, BUT GOD WILL make a
[1:06:55] way through it. Hallelujah. I think of
[1:06:59] how the prophet Isaiah said, "Who hath
[1:07:02] believed I report and to whom is the arm
[1:07:06] of the Lord revealed?"
[1:07:08] The prophet of God in the OPENING OF THE
[1:07:10] SEALS HE SAYS BELIEVE the report and the
[1:07:15] arm OF THE LORD WILL BE MADE MANIFEST.
[1:07:18] Uh you WANT TO SEE GOD MADE manifest in
[1:07:21] your life believe this message. You want
[1:07:24] TO SEE A SITUATION change in your
[1:07:27] marriage BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. UH YOU
[1:07:30] WANT TO SEE THE POWER OF GOD SHAKE THIS
[1:07:33] CHURCH then believe THIS MESSAGE.
[1:07:36] IT'S THE AMEN OF GOD. IT'S THE FINAL SAY
[1:07:40] OVER every condition, every situation.
[1:07:43] Hallelujah. The prophet of God would say
[1:07:46] that Jesus Christ was God's love
[1:07:50] expressed. Hallelujah. It's not an angry
[1:07:54] God. You know, God being mad at us, but
[1:07:58] Jesus loves us. No sir, it is Jesus
[1:08:01] Christ is the expression. It it is the
[1:08:06] characteristics
[1:08:07] of God BEING EXPRESSED, AMEN, to his
[1:08:11] people. Amen. Slaved to sin, AMEN, BOUND
[1:08:17] IN DARKNESS and unbelief and going to a
[1:08:21] DEVIL'S HELL. AMEN. BUT GOD BEGIN TO
[1:08:25] begin to express his divine love. And
[1:08:29] when HE WENT TO CALVARY, IT WAS BECAUSE
[1:08:32] you were in his mind. AND IT WAS
[1:08:34] SOVEREIGN GRACE UH THAT NAILED HIM TO
[1:08:38] THAT CROSS. Uh hallelujah. It wasn't it
[1:08:41] wasn't because it wasn't Roman nails
[1:08:43] that did it. IT WAS THE LOVE OF GOD AND
[1:08:48] SOVEREIGN GRACE MET WHAT GOD needed for
[1:08:52] his sacrifice.
[1:08:53] Amen. You see the prophet would say it
[1:08:55] like this. When divine love is projected
[1:09:00] and comes to its destiny. Oh, don't you
[1:09:03] like that? When sovereign when divine
[1:09:06] love is projected and comes to its
[1:09:10] destiny, then sovereign grace takes
[1:09:13] over. Hallelujah. Well, I'm thinking of
[1:09:16] this last days, amen, when the church
[1:09:19] has been growing, amen, into a complete
[1:09:22] bride body. And it's prophesied, amen,
[1:09:26] that there will be a ministry that will
[1:09:28] introduce ush to the capstone. And the
[1:09:32] capstone is charity. It is Christ
[1:09:36] himself, the love OF GOD THAT IS COMING
[1:09:40] to its destiny. And it's moving upon
[1:09:43] individuals, sons and daughters of God
[1:09:47] that he forneew before the foundation of
[1:09:50] the world. Uh and he PREDESTINATED YOU
[1:09:53] FOR THIS TIME AND THIS SEASON. UH AND
[1:09:56] NOW IN THIS AGE UH THERE IS A MOVING UH
[1:10:00] OF DIVINE LOVE UH AND IT'S MANIFESTING
[1:10:03] THE POWER OF GOD INTO THE BRIDE BODY OF
[1:10:07] JESUS CHRIST. I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S
[1:10:09] DOING. UH as that love is coming upon
[1:10:13] this BRIDE BODY, THERE IS A SOVEREIGN
[1:10:15] GRACE UH THAT IS TAKING OVER OUR LIVES.
[1:10:19] UH THAT WEDDING BAND, A PREDESTINATED
[1:10:22] UNMMERITED GRACE UH THAT SAID I YOU'RE
[1:10:25] MINE. YOU'RE MY BRIDE. I'LL NEVER LEAVE
[1:10:28] YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL NEVER
[1:10:31] LOSE YOU. YOU'RE GOING IN THE RAPTURE.
[1:10:34] YOUR FAMILY'S GOING IN THE RAPTURE. I
[1:10:36] BREAK EVERY STRONGHOLD OF HELL IN YOUR
[1:10:39] LIFE. UH IT IS THE SOVEREIGN GRACE OF
[1:10:42] GOD moving on the scene in this age.
[1:10:50] Hallelujah.
[1:10:51] [cheering] Grace,
[1:10:53] grace unto the headstone.
[1:10:58] You see,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; you can't separate love and grace
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; because brother Brennham said, "Love and
[1:11:05] grace are the same thing."
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; It's just simply divine love
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; is what comes to its destination.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Then sovereign grace
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; takes his place. I tell you it's grace
[1:11:21] that has brought us this revelation
[1:11:23] that YOU CAN BELIEVE NOT IN YOUR WORKS,
[1:11:27] not in your ability. This is not a
[1:11:30] denomination. This is not an ecumenical
[1:11:32] move. This is a moving of the Holy
[1:11:35] Ghost. AND GOD HAS BROUGHT US TO A FAITH
[1:11:40] to believe in grace.

[1:12:54] Brother Brandham says, "We have received
[1:12:56] the king's message."
[1:12:59] And then he would say, "This is the
[1:13:00] lamb's message.
[1:13:03] King's message
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; and the lamb's message
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; at the same time. We have received the
[1:13:12] greatest message that the world has ever

[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; We are preaching the uncarchable riches

[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; my commission, sir,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; is to introduce you to the coming word."
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; We've entered into another age.

[1:19:08] age.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; THIS IS HIS AGE.

[1:19:29] of the love of God that nothing CAN
[1:19:32] SEPARATE US FROM GOD'S LOVE.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Famine can't do it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; NO. NO. NATIONAL CRISIS CAN DO IT.
[1:19:44] NO ANTICHRIST SPIRIT REJECTING THE
[1:19:47] MESSAGE of the hour can do it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; MAN DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS REVELATION
[1:19:55] [cheering]
[1:19:55] AND MAN CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. IT'S
[1:19:59] GRACE.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; It's grace.
[1:20:08] Everything that Jesus died for
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; is in full effect.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; The title deed that Adam lost
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; is back into the hands of the sons and
[1:20:19] daughters of God.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Not a partial title deed,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; but the same title deed.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Where do you get that?" The
[1:20:29] message of THE HOUR.
[1:20:31] GOD SENT A PROPHET IN THIS HOUR,
[1:20:33] VINDICATED HIM,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; AND THEN SAID, "THE TITLE NEED IS PUT IN
[1:20:37] YOUR HANDS.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT ADAM LOST IS IN YOUR
[1:20:40] HANDS.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; The only thing that WE DON'T HAVE IS THE
[1:20:44] BODY." BUT IT'S COMING.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; But the grace TO CHANGE MY BODY IS
[1:20:52] ALREADY HERE.

[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; When omnipotence speaks, the miraculous
[1:21:14] takes place.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; The lepers are healed.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; The Lazaruses are raised from the dead.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Dead churches are brought to revival.
[1:21:25] FAMILY SITUATIONS ARE CHANGED. IT'S
[1:21:28] BECAUSE you're not hearing from a man.
[1:21:30] YOU'RE HEARING FROM THUS SAYAETH THE
[1:21:32] LORD.
[1:21:35] [cheering]

[1:21:41] MESSAGE AND YOU HEAR YOUR PASTOR PREACH
[1:21:43] THIS MESSAGE, WE ARE HEARING THE VOICE
[1:21:46] OF OMNIPOTENCE.
[1:21:48] WE ARE HEARING, AMEN, A WORD OF POWER
[1:21:52] RELEASING GRACE INTO YOUR HOME AND YOUR
[1:21:55] LIFE AND SITUATIONS THAT SEEM
[1:21:57] IMPOSSIBLE. YET GOD, WHEN HE DROPS THAT
[1:22:02] REVELATION IN YOUR HEART THAT YES, I
[1:22:04] BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A [screaming] grace
[1:22:08] that begins TO MOVE
[1:22:10] and changes the situations,
[1:22:14] CHANGES the atmosphere.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; People have been in drugs for 20 years
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; and yet by sovereign grace sir

[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Alcoholics
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; for maybe 30, 40 years totally
[1:22:34] delivered.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Marriages falling apart. The devil
[1:22:39] wreaking havoc. And yet the amen of God
[1:22:41] comes and says enough.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; I'm the amen over this marriage. HAD THE
[1:22:46] FINAL SAY over this family.
[1:22:49] [applause]
[1:22:50] [cheering]
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; It's time that we get our faith where it
[1:22:52] needs to be and that is the word of
[1:22:55] omnipotence THAT HAS BROUGHT GRACE.
[1:22:58] GRACE IN this hour.
[1:23:03] The opening of the seals was to bring us
[1:23:06] a faith in rapturing grace.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I know I I'm quoting to you now. the
[1:23:12] opening of those seven thunders. Those
[1:23:15] seven thunders of thunder is the voice
[1:23:16] of God. Those seven thunders was the
[1:23:18] mysteries of the seventh seal releasing
[1:23:21] of faith into this bride THAT YOU'LL
[1:23:23] REALIZE THERE'S A GRACE. But it's not
[1:23:26] just any KIND OF A GRACE. UH IT'S A
[1:23:28] RAPTURING GRACE. UH IT'S A CATCHING AWAY
[1:23:31] GRACE. UH IT'S A CHAIN BREAKING GRACE.
[1:23:34] UH IT'S A BULK CUTTING GRACE. UH THERE'S
[1:23:37] A GRACE UH THAT IS MOVED UPON THIS
[1:23:41] BRIDE.
[1:23:43] AND IT'S PROPHESIED THAT IN THIS DAY OF
[1:23:45] GRACE WHEN THE POWER OF GOD IS REVEALED,
[1:23:48] THERE WILL BE A PEOPLE THAT WILL STEP
[1:23:50] INTO IT. THEY'LL BE WILLING TO MOVE,
[1:23:54] WILLING TO ACT, WILLING TO CLAIM THEIR
[1:23:56] BIRTHIGHT. WILLING TO SAY, "YES,

[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; We've heard the king speak himself.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; We're not under an earthbound anointing.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; This is not a REFORMER ANOINTING.
[1:24:40] THIS IS NOT DEALING WITH YOU ACCORDING
[1:24:41] to your deeds.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST THREE POWERS WERE earthbound
[1:24:49] creatures.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; But this is something greater.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's going to BE SOMETHING. WE NEED
[1:24:54] SOMETHING GREATER TO GET US OUT of
[1:24:56] Leosa.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Lukewarm,
[1:25:00] dead, formal, religious.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And that religious spirit is the
[1:25:06] greatest spirit to break. BUT THIS EAGLE
[1:25:09] ANOINTING WILL BREAK IT.
[1:25:12] [cheering]
[1:25:14] HALLELUJAH. You can sit in church for 50
[1:25:17] years, BUT THIS EAGLE ANOINTING IS WHAT

[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SAYING COME UP HIGHER.
[1:25:34] IT'S AN ANOINTING
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; THAT is you're being magnetized from
[1:25:39] above.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; The magnetism is from above.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Look up.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; For your magnetism.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Look up. [cheering and applause]
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; I am he that was.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I am he that is
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; and I am he that is to come. I am the
[1:26:03] amen of God.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; The magnetism that is DRAWING US TO THE
[1:26:07] HEADSTONE is coming from above.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You see, LET ME SAY IT LIKE THE PROPHET.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He said he went to a factory
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; and he said that he seen, you know, the
[1:26:20] magnet come over and it began to pull
[1:26:23] all of the shavings that were magnetized
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and it all came to the magnet.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; He the PROPHET SAID, "WELL, WHY WEREN'T
[1:26:30] THEY MAGNETIZED?" He said, "They're
[1:26:32] aluminum. THERE'S NOTHING TO PULL,
[1:26:35] NOTHING TO DRAW THEM." OH, I SEE. BUT
[1:26:39] WHAT ABOUT THEM? HE SAID, "OH, THEY'RE
[1:26:42] THE SAME MATERIAL." That's right. But
[1:26:44] they're bolted down.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; For a long time, I read that
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; and I think I may have read it wrong
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; because I left them bolted down.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I kept thinking, "Well, bless their
[1:26:59] hearts. THEY'RE THE SAME MATERIAL, BUT
[1:27:02] THEY'RE NOT COMING UP.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And then when I then I BEGIN TO THINK
[1:27:08] THIS IS A CYCLE BREAKING MESSAGE.
[1:27:11] THIS IS A BOLT BREAKING MESSAGE.
[1:27:14] THIS IS A POWER THAT HAS THE DYNAMICS TO
[1:27:18] GO AND BEGIN TO CUT AWAY LEAN,
[1:27:22] CUT AWAY HURT FEELINGS, CUT AWAY PRIDE,
[1:27:26] CUT AWAY LUKEWARMNESS. GOD'S NOT GOING
[1:27:28] TO LEAVE YOU IN LEOSIA. GOD'S NOT GOING
[1:27:31] TO LEAVE YOU IN A HOPELESS CONDITION.
[1:27:33] GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU NAKED. HE'S
[1:27:36] COME TO BREAK THE CYCLE. HE'S COME TO
[1:27:40] BREAK THE GENERATIONAL CURSES, THE
[1:27:42] THINGS THAT ARE BOLTING YOU DOWN IN YOUR
[1:27:44] SPIRIT, OF YOUR MEMORIES, OF YOUR PAST.
[1:27:48] AMEN. THE THE THE THE THINGS IN YOUR
[1:27:50] IMAGINATION, THE THINGS IN YOUR
[1:27:53] CONSCIENCE CAUSING YOU TO FALL APART.
[1:27:57] BUT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO BREAK THE
[1:28:00] CYCLE, BREAK THE COMPLEXES, TO HEAL THE
[1:28:04] WOUNDED SPIRITS, TO BREAK THE
[1:28:06] STRONGHOLDS OF THE DEVIL IN your life.
[1:28:10] [cheering]
[1:28:12] I'm
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; telling you, we're in a season of grace.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; We're under a different anointing.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; It's a chain breaking anointing.
[1:28:26] God's grace covenant
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; is in full effect.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; the power of grace
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; is in full effect and will not fail
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; to accomplish what he forneew
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; and predestinated to be in your life.
[1:28:50] You see, the prophet of God would say
[1:28:52] that we are
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; in the dispensation,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Yes, sir.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; We've went through the church agesh
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; under the dispensation of son of God.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost moving.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:08] The lamb interceding on the ignorance of
[1:29:10] the people
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; knowing there would come a time
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; that the lamb would take the book open
[1:29:16] the seals
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; and the day of IGNORANCE WOULD BE OPEN
[1:29:20] would be over.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Because the son of man anointing
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; is the revealing of the word. So, as it
[1:29:29] was in the days of Noah, as it was in
[1:29:32] the days of Lot, so shall it be in the
[1:29:35] revealing of the son of man. Who was
[1:29:37] that son of man? Elohim.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Elohim come in flesh. [screaming]
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Just a few days before,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Abram had his name changed from Abram to
[1:29:50] Abraham.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Abram had received A PORTION OF GOD'S
[1:29:55] OWN NAME,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; THE HUM.
[1:29:58] Elohim
[1:30:00] Abraham.
[1:30:04] But he didn't stop there.
[1:30:06] He said, "I'm going to change Sarah's
[1:30:08] name, too.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; SHE'S SARAH,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; but now she's going to be called Sarah."
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; SARAH'S NAME WAS CHANGED,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF ABRAHAM.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; SO, THE SAME PROMISE THAT WAS WITH
[1:30:24] ABRAHAM WAS ALSO WITH SARAH. Abraham
[1:30:28] [groaning]
[1:30:30] was walking with God. Abraham was
[1:30:32] receiving growing and grace and
[1:30:34] revelation. BUT THE SAME TIME SARAH, IT
[1:30:38] LOOKED LIKE NOTHING WAS HAPPENING IN HER
[1:30:40] LIFE. BUT THROUGH JUSTIFICATION,
[1:30:42] SANCTIFICATION, the baptism OF THE HOLY
[1:30:44] GHOST AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THE
[1:30:46] NAME CHANGE WAS THE ADOPTION.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; So it went from ABRAM TO ABRAHAM.
[1:30:54] Sarah the whole time it looked like she
[1:30:56] was in unbelief,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS A PART OF THE ANOINTING.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; WITH EVERY SEASON, SHE WAS CHANGING WITH
[1:31:05] THE SEASON. It didn't LOOK LIKE IT. IT
[1:31:08] DIDN'T LOOK LIKE BY HER WORKS, BY HER
[1:31:11] ABILITY, IT WAS JUST THE SAME OLD SARAI.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ELOHIM WAS MADE flesh
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; and Abraham recognized [screaming] my
[1:31:22] Lord,
[1:31:23] And now Elohim, the son of man, IS
[1:31:27] SITTING THERE EATING CALF. AMEN. CALF
[1:31:30] AND AND AND HE'S GOT SOME HE'S GOT SOME
[1:31:32] GOAT MILK AND HE'S DRINKING IT AND HE'S
[1:31:35] GOT DUST ALL OVER HIS CLOTHES. AND THEN
[1:31:37] HE BEGINS to tell Abraham.
[1:31:39] ABRAHAM, I REMEMBER MY PROMISE.
[1:31:44] I'VE SWORE BY MYSELF. IT'S A GRACE
[1:31:47] COVENANT, ABRAHAM. It's not anything OF
[1:31:50] YOUR WORKS. IT'S NOT ANYTHING OF YOUR
[1:31:52] ABILITY. I'VE GOT WHAT YOU LACK AND I'VE
[1:31:56] COME TO VISIT YOU ACCORDING TO THE TIME
[1:31:58] OF LIFE. [cheering]
[1:32:01] SARAH [screaming]
[1:32:02] WAS IN THE tent behind him.
[1:32:05] And when she heard about that, Amen. She
[1:32:09] heard what Elohim said. She kind of
[1:32:11] snickered up her sleeve and said, "ME
[1:32:13] BEING AN OLD WOMAN HAVE PLEASURE WITH MY
[1:32:16] HUSBAND, US BEING OLD." AND ELOHIM SAID,
[1:32:20] "WHY DOES SARAH laugh behind you?"
[1:32:22] Notice he didn't say Sarah. HE SAID,
[1:32:25] "SARAH,
[1:32:26] THY WIFE, WHY DOES SHE LAUGH?" AND WHEN
[1:32:30] SHE CAME OUT AND SHE SAID, "NO, I DIDN'T
[1:32:33] LAUGH." THE PROPHET SAID GOD WOULD HAVE
[1:32:35] KILLED HER RIGHT THERE, BUT SHE WAS A
[1:32:37] PART OF THE PROMISE.
[1:32:39] NO ONE COULD TAKE SARAH'S PLACE.
[1:32:43] [cheering]
[1:32:44] HALLELUJAH. So Elohim had to HAD TO
[1:32:49] DECLARE TO SARAH AND PROVE BY
[1:32:51] VINDICATION THAT SHE IS A PART OF THE
[1:32:54] PROMISE.
[1:32:56] AND HE DID IT NOT BY ACCUSING HER, NOT
[1:33:00] BY CONDEMNING HER, NOT BY BEATING HER
[1:33:03] DOWN, BUT HE CALLED HER BY HER NAME
[1:33:06] CHANGE.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:10] AMEN. TERRY, YOU'RE A PART OF THE
[1:33:12] PROMISE. NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
[1:33:14] PLACE. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:33:18] YOU'RE IN THE FORN KNOWLEDGE OF GOD.
[1:33:20] [applause]
[1:33:21] [cheering]
[1:33:23] Let me SAY IT TO YOU LIKE THIS. IF
[1:33:25] YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO COME
[1:33:27] AND be a better church member, IF YOU'RE
[1:33:29] WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE, AMEN, TO
[1:33:32] FULFILL THE GIFT THAT GOD HAS PLACED IN
[1:33:33] YOUR LIFE,
[1:33:36] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT GOD IS WHAT THE
[1:33:39] PROPHET OF GOD SAYS. HALLELUJAH. IF
[1:33:42] YOU'LL REALIZE YOUR position
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; and if you WILL LET HIM HAVE HAVE HIS
[1:33:48] POSITION IN YOU.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; OH, HOW YOU'LL SAVE GOD A LOT OF TIME. I
[1:33:55] TELL YOU, IT'S TIME TO SAVE GOD SOME
[1:33:58] TIME. AND JUST SAY, LORD JESUS, I AM the
[1:34:02] sinless, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:05] I AM A PART OF THIS END TIME BRIDE
[1:34:08] MINISTRY. I AM ANOINTED FOR SUCH A TIME
[1:34:10] AS THIS UH TO TEAR DOWN UNBELIEF UH TO
[1:34:13] MOVE BEYOND MY FIVE SENSES OF REASONING
[1:34:16] AND AFFECTION AND WHAT I SEE AND WHAT I
[1:34:18] HEAR. I'M ANOINTED TO MANIFEST THIS
[1:34:22] WORD. [cheering]
[1:34:25] [applause]
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God in the opening of the
[1:34:32] seals, he said, "So you'll understand,
[1:34:35] I'm not going to call you church any
[1:34:36] longer. I'm going to call you bride.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; The name change took place in the
[1:34:45] opening of the seals.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; But God,
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; oh, God's been patient.
[1:34:55] This season of grace that has been
[1:34:57] moving over the bride.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This word THAT HAS BEEN
[1:35:02] PROPHESIED OVER our lives, God has been
[1:35:06] growing us, a little changing us,
[1:35:10] ripening us. The heat of the vindicated
[1:35:13] sunlight of THE WORD, JUST BAKING ALL
[1:35:15] THE GREENNESS out of us. Hallelujah. So
[1:35:18] we can come into the position OF WHO WE
[1:35:20] TRULY ARE. A POSITION OF SUNSHIP, A
[1:35:24] POSITION OF SUPREME AUTHORITY, A
[1:35:26] POSITION THAT I AM HERE TO MANIFEST THE
[1:35:29] PROMISE.
[1:35:30] IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD UPON MY LIFE AND
[1:35:34] NO ONE ELSE CAN [screaming] DO IT BUT
[1:35:36] ME. [cheering]
[1:35:39] [applause]
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; This adoption message has been waved
[1:35:44] over your life for years and years and
[1:35:46] years. But we are in a season to come
[1:35:49] into manifestation.
[1:35:51] We are in a SEASON THAT WE'RE NOT JUST
[1:35:54] QUESTIONING IT AND WONDERING ABOUT THIS
[1:35:56] QUOTE WITH THIS QUOTE AND AND AND WELL
[1:35:58] DOES THIS MEAN THIS AND WE GOT TO ARGUE
[1:36:00] AND DEBATE. NO SIR, THERE'S A JOSHUA
[1:36:03] GENERATION THAT SAYS I'VE BEEN RAISED UP
[1:36:06] TO STEP INTO MY INHERITANCE. UH THIS IS
[1:36:08] MY PROMISED LAND. UH IT'S MY SEASON.
[1:36:12] IT'S MY APPOINTED TIME.
[1:36:14] [cheering and applause]
[1:36:18] HALLELUJAH. It's a dispensation.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say
[1:36:23] dispensation of son of man,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; but it's also a dispensation of
[1:36:26] adoption.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS YOUR
[1:36:32] ADOPTION IS NOT YOUR BIRTH.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Your adoption is your placing.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say yes to it?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Your birth is your rest.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Rest.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; REST.
[1:36:50] BUT YOUR ADOPTION IS YOUR POSITIONING.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; SO YOU COME INTO YOUR REST.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN THERE'S a position.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT TO COME INTO YOUR POSITION,
[1:37:01] YOUR PLACING AND SAY, "THIS IS WHO GOD
[1:37:03] HAS PLACED ME TO BE."
[1:37:06] SO LET ME JUST SIMPLIFY THIS. THE
[1:37:07] MESSAGE of the HOUR CAME TO PLACE YOU.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PLACED AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:37:12] CHRIST. YOU ARE PLACED AS AN INVINCIBLE
[1:37:15] ARMY. YOU ARE PLACED AS A JUSTIFIED
[1:37:18] ELECT LADY, AS IF YOU HAD NEVER SINNED
[1:37:21] IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU ARE PLACED FREE
[1:37:24] OF FEAR, FREE OF CONDEMNATION, PLACED
[1:37:27] FREE OF GUILT, PLACED AS ONE OF GOD'S
[1:37:30] ETERNAL THOUGHTS MADE MANIFEST. THAT'S
[1:37:33] YOUR POSITION.
[1:37:35] [applause and cheering]
[1:37:37] [screaming]
[1:37:42] And no, no. See,
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; see, thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; We're born of the spirit of God. We are
[1:37:48] sons of God, but we were predestinated.
[1:37:50] Now, here's what I'm trying to get to
[1:37:52] you for the sons of the last day. We
[1:37:54] were predestinated
[1:37:56] unto adoption.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; So, it's the dispensation of the son of
[1:38:02] man.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; The revealing,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; it's the dispensation of adoption, your
[1:38:07] placing, sir.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But it's also the dispensation of
[1:38:10] overcoming.
[1:38:14] When I see of the dispensation of
[1:38:15] overcoming, I think of Caleb.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; We had heard when when when he and
[1:38:26] Joshua went to the land of promise,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; my goodness,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; it was everything the prophet said it
[1:38:32] was.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; It was flowing with milk and honey and
[1:38:35] sir,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; oh, the the fruits were Amen. in full
[1:38:39] bloom. Hallelujah. They were carrying
[1:38:42] back the evidence. It's a good land.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; They were partaking of the grapes and
[1:38:47] the pomegranates and
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; they HAD GRAPE JUICE RUNNING ALL over
[1:38:50] their face. They were just full. THEY
[1:38:52] WERE JUST IN THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE
[1:38:55] ELATED
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; FULL OF THE EMOTION THAT THE HOLY GHOST
[1:39:00] GAVE.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Coming back and saying yes
[1:39:06] sir. The healing is mine. Joy is mine.
[1:39:10] Victory is mine. My family is mine. The
[1:39:14] rapture is mine.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO SHOUT BECAUSE THEY WERE
[1:39:22] RIGHT SMACK dab in the bride's revival
[1:39:25] and all they had to do is take it as an
[1:39:27] inheritance.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; They seen the same walled cities. They
[1:39:34] seen the same giants, but they didn't
[1:39:37] even look at them. You know what they
[1:39:39] said?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; They're not even in the eternal thoughts
[1:39:41] of God.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And God has already told me that this is
[1:39:48] my land.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And I was here before the foundation of
[1:39:51] the world. God created this land of the
[1:39:54] Holy Ghost. AND IT'S MINE. IT'S MY
[1:39:56] INHERITANCE.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; And all I've got to DO IS JUST STEP INTO
[1:40:02] it as an inheritance. Don't have to beg.
[1:40:06] Don't have to plead. don't have to WORK
[1:40:09] A REVIVAL UP. ALL I'VE got to do is just
[1:40:12] step into it and say, "Joy is mine.
[1:40:15] Peace is mine. Happiness is mine. FAITH,
[1:40:17] VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE,
[1:40:20] BROTHERLY KINDNESS, GODLINESS, ALL OF
[1:40:21] THESE THINGS, IT IS MINE." [screaming]
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And there they are. They're carrying the
[1:40:35] evidence. And then they start hearing an
[1:40:37] evil report.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's not for us.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD LAND, BUT IT'S NOT FOR US.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FOR MY CHILDREN.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; MY CHILDREN IS GOING TO GET SWALLOWED
[1:40:48] UP.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; WE NEED SOMETHING BETTER. We need
[1:40:51] ANOTHER PROGRAM. WE WE NEED PSYCHOLOGY.
[1:40:53] WE WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO HELP OUR
[1:40:56] FAMILIES.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:41:01] [screaming]
[1:41:02] I DON'T KNOW FOR YOU, but that's an evil
[1:41:04] report.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I HAVE NEED OF IS CHRIST. AND
[1:41:08] AND THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST. AND THIS
[1:41:11] MESSAGE HAS JOY. IT HAS PEACE. IT IS
[1:41:15] FULL OF NEW WINE. IT IS IT IS THE
[1:41:18] STIMULATION OF REVELATION FOR MY BLUES.
[1:41:21] IT IS RAPTURING GRACE. [cheering]
[1:41:28] Glory to God.
[1:41:32] Joshua and Caleb
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; silenced the people
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and said, "Don't do this."
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Let me just put IT TO OUR MODERN WAY.
[1:41:41] DON'T DO THIS.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; It's an antichrist spirit.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; THAT IS A FALSE ANOINTING.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO TURN YOUR HEARTS TO UNBELIEF.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD LAND. HERE'S THE EVIDENCE.
[1:41:53] HE'S ONLY LOOKING FOR A HEART OF FAITH
[1:41:56] TO SAY, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO POSSESS
[1:41:58] THE LAND.
[1:42:04] 40 years.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; 40 years.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; God said
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; that every one of you is going to die in
[1:42:12] the wilderness except Joshua and Caleb
[1:42:14] because they had a right spirit.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; He said the children that you said would
[1:42:20] fall prey.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; They're the ones that's going to possess
[1:42:23] it.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we've had a generation of
[1:42:26] old fighters.
[1:42:31] But let me tell you something, friends.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Caleb was an old man when he took this
[1:42:36] took that mountain.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I believe that there's an old gener
[1:42:41] there's that old generation that has
[1:42:43] stood with this message that you don't
[1:42:46] HAVE TO GET A COMPLEX WHEN YOU TALK
[1:42:48] ABOUT THOSE old fighters. BUT I'M HERE
[1:42:51] TO TELL YOU THERE ARE SOME THERE IS SOME
[1:42:54] WARRIORS THAT HAS STOOD WITH THIS
[1:42:56] MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A
[1:42:59] FRESH GENERATION
[1:43:01] IN THE SEASON OF RESTITUTION OF ALL
[1:43:04] THINGS. THERE WOULD BE A GENERATION RISE
[1:43:07] UP THAT IS FLEXIBLE TO THE MOVING OF THE
[1:43:09] HOLY GHOST THAT CAN BEGIN TO CLAP THEIR
[1:43:12] HANDS TO THE WORD AND SAY YES LORD. YES,
[1:43:16] LORD. UH, MILK AND HONEY, LORD, IT'S MY
[1:43:19] INHERITANCE. UH, AMEN. THOSE CITIES IS
[1:43:22] MY INHERITANCE. UH, OH THOSE THOSE JOY
[1:43:26] AND THE PEACE AND ALL OF THIS IS MY
[1:43:30] REVIVAL. [screaming]
[1:43:32] [cheering]
[1:43:33] I'M TELLING YOU FRIENDS, WE'VE TURNED
[1:43:36] THE CORNER. IT'S A SEASON OF GRACE. IT'S
[1:43:41] TIME TO OVERCOME [screaming]
[1:43:43] IN THE PROMISED LAND.
[1:43:46] [cheering]
[1:43:51] [applause]
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Caleb began to look around.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He's watching.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; He's watching this family conquer.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Glory to God.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; That's the revival we're in."
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Looks around and sees that family
[1:44:08] conquer. that tribe conquer.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; He's amen. They've all got their swords
[1:44:14] in hand saying, "Greater is he that is
[1:44:16] in me
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world."
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Something begin to bubble up in his
[1:44:22] heart.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And he said, Joshua,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Joshua's a type of the Holy Ghost. Now,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; it's a type of the grace dispensation.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Moses was a type of law.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Law had passed away. Denominational ages
[1:44:37] passed away. And now God's provided play
[1:44:40] God's provided place of worship. God's
[1:44:42] provided way of worship is completely
[1:44:44] open.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA HAS LED HIM INTO IT.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; This is where the giants fall.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; This is where deliverance takes place.
[1:45:00] Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; In that place,
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; in that position,
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; IN THAT DISPENSATION OF ADOPTION,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; WHERE MECHANICS and dynamics HAVE COME
[1:45:10] TOGETHER, IN THAT PLACE, I MEET YOU.
[1:45:14] [cheering]
[1:45:16] THAT'S WHERE RESTORATION TAKES PLACE.
[1:45:19] THAT'S WHERE MARRIAGES ARE RESTORED.
[1:45:21] THAT'S WHERE DRUG ADDICTS, SONS, OR
[1:45:24] DAUGHTERS COME HOME.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; NOT BY YOUR WORKS.
[1:45:30] BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAITH THE LORD,
[1:45:35] [cheering and applause]
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; CALEB.
[1:45:45] YES, SIR. Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Caleb had to wait a long time,
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; but now Caleb,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; is a part of a new generation.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; They've come into the promised land.
[1:45:54] They believe the report, the arm of the
[1:45:56] Lord has been revealed.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; And Caleb,
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; he's different
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; because he's a gentile,
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; he's a gentile, and somehow he had found
[1:46:09] his place in the inheritance of Israel,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; a part of the adoption
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; and he had a different spirit. He
[1:46:17] believed the word of God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; When Caleb
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; came to Joshua and said, "Now Joshua,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; we need to have a conference.
[1:46:27] I think I I I think some of us just need
[1:46:30] to go to the Holy GHOST AND SAY, "HOLY
[1:46:32] GHOST,
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; we need a conference. [cheering]
[1:46:49] I've heard the tapes.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; I know what the spirit of grace has
[1:46:53] spoke to my heart.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID, "THAT'S MY
[1:46:58] INHERITANCE."
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; NOW, JOSHUA,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just as capable.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST AS STRONG THE DAY that that
[1:47:06] that that THE PROPHET SPOKE THAT PROMISE
[1:47:09] TO ME.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE GOT THE STRENGTH TO GO and
[1:47:13] conquer. and I've got the strength to
[1:47:16] return.
[1:47:18] In other words, those giants doesn't
[1:47:20] have ENOUGH TO DESTROY MY LIFE. THEY
[1:47:22] DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DESTROY MY HOME.
[1:47:25] THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE my joy.
[1:47:29] [cheering and applause]
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; I THINK WE JUST NEED TO HAVE A GOOD
[1:47:32] OLD-FASHIONED HOLY GHOST MOVE AND SAY,
[1:47:35] "SATAN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. You tried
[1:47:38] to TAKE MY FAMILY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:47:41] ENOUGH. YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY HEALTH, BUT
[1:47:44] YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. AMEN. AMEN. WHERE
[1:47:47] WERE YOU? AMEN. AMEN. A YEAR AGO WHEN
[1:47:51] THE DEVIL SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE
[1:47:52] IT ANOTHER YEAR, BUT YOU'RE HERE BY THE
[1:47:54] GRACE OF GOD. WHAT ABOUT AMEN. 10 YEARS
[1:47:58] AGO WHEN YOU WERE TRAPPED IN SIN,
[1:48:01] TRAPPED IN DRUGS, TRAPPED IN ALCOHOL,
[1:48:04] AND THE DEVIL SAID YOU'RE MINE, YOU'RE
[1:48:06] NEVER GOING TO GET FREE, BUT YOU'RE HERE
[1:48:09] IN YOUR RIGHT MIND, IN YOUR POSITION,
[1:48:12] STANDING AS CALEB'S. IT'S TIME TO SAY,
[1:48:16] SATAN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T
[1:48:19] TAKE ME. YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME. YOU CAN'T
[1:48:22] TAKE MY FAMILY. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY JOY.
[1:48:25] YOU CAN'T TAKE MY RAPTURE. YOU CAN'T
[1:48:27] TAKE MY MARRIAGE UP. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY
[1:48:30] MILLENNIUM. YOU CAN'T TAKE ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:48:34] [applause and cheering]
[1:48:36] I think it's TIME TO TELL THE DEVIL THAT
[1:48:38] I'M GOING TO BE THERE and I'm GOING TO
[1:48:41] BE THE ONE THAT TAKES YOUR SCRAWNY NECK
[1:48:45] AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BOOT INTO
[1:48:47] THE lake of fire. HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:51] IT'S MY POSITION. IT'S MY SUPREME
[1:48:54] AUTHORITY.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR THAT DAY.
[1:49:01] I'M GOING TO CAST YOU OUT. I speak
[1:49:04] peace. I SPEAK JOY. I SPEAK DELIVERANCE.
[1:49:08] I SPEAK HEALING. I SAY THIS IS NOT BY
[1:49:11] MIGHT. THIS IS NOT BY POWER. THIS IS NOT
[1:49:15] A PREACHER'S REVIVAL. THIS IS A BRIDE'S
[1:49:18] REVIVAL.
[1:49:19] THIS IS A BRIDE AGE. [screaming]
[1:49:22] IT'S YOUR SEASON OF GRACE TO CONQUER
[1:49:26] THAT ENEMY. [cheering]
[1:49:31] [applause]
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb did?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; He acted on the promise.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; An 85, I believe it was, 85y old man
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; was willing in the day of God's power.
[1:49:55] I tell you,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get into all of
[1:49:57] these things.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; But I I let Let me just tell you about
[1:50:02] another battle.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; When Joshua was leading
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; his army.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And now now this is the season of
[1:50:11] adoption, right? Dispensation of
[1:50:13] adoption.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; And God said, "It's time, Joshua. Yes,
[1:50:17] sir.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Take them on into it."
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Well, I tell you, sir.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God had a vision
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; and he seen a map of Palestine. Yes,
[1:50:26] sir.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You come twothirds of the
[1:50:28] journey,
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; the first two pools."
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T HAVE A PART IN THOSE first two
[1:50:35] pools.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TRYING TO REPRODUCE THE first
[1:50:40] two pools.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; But when God told his prophet said,
[1:50:43] "It's now time to go into the fullness."
[1:50:47] go into the full manifestation of the
[1:50:51] covenant word.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; It's time TO MAKE THE WORD EFFECTIVE IN
[1:50:57] THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO COME INTO THE THIRD POOL,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; THE OPENING OF THE WORD WHERE ALL THE
[1:51:08] PROMISES ARE.
[1:51:12] AND THE PROPHET UNDER THE JOSHUA
[1:51:14] MINISTRY, A SON OF MAN, REVEALING THE
[1:51:16] SON OF MAN, LED US INTO THE PROMISE AND
[1:51:20] SAID, "IT'S YOUR LAND. IT'S YOUR
[1:51:22] INHERITANCE."
[1:51:24] [applause and cheering]
[1:51:25] THEN GOD TOOK THE PROPHET OFF OF THE
[1:51:27] SCENE, BUT HE LEFT US WITH THE GREATEST
[1:51:30] MESSAGE OF OMNIPOTENCE THE WORLD HAS
[1:51:32] ever known. And now there's a PEOPLE IN
[1:51:34] THIS SEASON SAYING, "YES, IT'S MINE.
[1:51:37] [screaming]
[1:51:38] I SEE IT. I SEE IT. MY EYES ARE OPEN.
[1:51:41] THE EYES OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS OPEN.
[1:51:44] [cheering]
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hype you up. I'm
[1:51:50] trying to tell you the season you're in.
[1:51:53] [cheering]
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:52:00] [cheering]
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; as they stepped into the into that new
[1:52:04] dispensation
[1:52:06] turned the corner.
[1:52:09] THE DENOMINATION JUST KEPT ON GOING.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals just went RIGHT ON DOWN THE
[1:52:14] LINE.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRIDE ALL OF A SUDDEN TURNED THE
[1:52:16] corner
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; and they went right into battles.
[1:52:25] All of the forces,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; ALL OF HELL,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; HELL
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN released
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; because they recognize something. Satan
[1:52:39] has recognized THAT THIS IS HIS TIME TO
[1:52:43] STRIP WOMEN. IT'S HIS TIME TO TAKE
[1:52:46] SANITY AND MAKE THEM INSANE. HE SEES
[1:52:49] IT'S HIS TIME TO WORK IN POLITICS AND
[1:52:52] NATION AGAINST NATION. IT'S HIS TIME.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; But by A VINDICATED WORD, PROPHET, THIS
[1:53:01] BRIDE IS RECOGNIZED. IT'S BRIDE TIME.
[1:53:05] [cheering]
[1:53:07] DON'T RUN FROM THE DEVIL.
[1:53:10] PUT YOUR SHOULDERS BACK. YOU'RE
[1:53:12] PREDESTINATED FOR THIS SEASON.
[1:53:15] YOU'RE PREDESTINATED FOR ADOPTION.
[1:53:18] YOU'RE PREDESTINATED FOR THIS MOUNTAIN
[1:53:21] DRAW MOUNT TREETOP WHERE THE SUNLIGHT IS
[1:53:25] RIPENING THE FRUIT.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:53:29] HOUR [screaming] MADE FLESH.
[1:53:32] [cheering]
[1:53:34] [applause]
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Don't think me crazy,
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; BUT I AM [screaming]
[1:53:43] THE WORD.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; I AM THE DWELLING PLACE OF CHRIST.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I AM [screaming]
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; MESSIAH.
[1:54:01] [cheering]
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that the law says that to
[1:54:04] whom the word has come to, ye are gods?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET OF GOD SAYS, "YOU are
[1:54:09] miniature creators."
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU CREATING? WE don't need
[1:54:13] squirrels. We don't need to speak a
[1:54:15] storm out of existence. WE NEED A HOLY
[1:54:17] GHOST ATMOSPHERE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT BY
[1:54:20] MIGHT, IT'S NOT BY POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY
[1:54:23] SPIRIT, SAYETH THE LORD. WE NEED TO
[1:54:26] CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF BELIEVING THAT
[1:54:28] ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. WHEN WE'RE IN
[1:54:31] THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE, WE CAN RECOGNIZE
[1:54:33] WE'RE UNDER ANOTHER DISPENSATION.
[1:54:42] spontaneous
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; in the heat of the battle,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; but was in
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; it was when the shadows were falling.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; It was when sir
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; it was becoming a dismal day.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; It was when sir
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Joshua understood that the forces were
[1:55:03] going to gather all together against
[1:55:05] Israel.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; So something in him Yes, sir.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Spontaneous.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't pray about it.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a 40-day fast.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "God, is this your will?
[1:55:20] Can I speak?"
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He just SIMPLY SAID, "SON, STAND STILL.
[1:55:26] MOON, you stay in your place on Agelon."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was A SON OF GOD
[1:55:33] THAT WAS ANOINTED TO LEAD THEM INTO THE
[1:55:36] PROMISED LAND. AND HE SPOKE THERE SHALL
[1:55:40] BE LIGHT IN THE EVENING TIME
[1:55:43] [applause and cheering]
[1:55:45] AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE WAS NOT A
[1:55:47] DAY LIKE IT from that time AND THERE'S
[1:55:50] NOT BEEN A DAY LIKE IT SINCE
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY LIKE THIS PSALMS
[1:55:57] 118 verse 22- 24 THE STONE WHICH THE
[1:56:00] BUILDERS refused has become the
[1:56:02] headstone OF THE CORNER THIS IS THE
[1:56:04] LORD'S DOING IT'S MARVELOUS IS IN OUR
[1:56:07] EYES WHOSE EYES OUR EYES.
[1:56:13] THIS IS THE DAY WHICH THE LORD HATH
[1:56:16] MADE. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:56:23] This is not man's day. This is the
[1:56:26] Lord's day.
[1:56:30] THE SAME DAY THERE'S GROSS DARKNESS. THE
[1:56:34] SAME DAY judgment has been pronounced
[1:56:37] OVER THIS OVER THIS NATION, OVER THE
[1:56:39] WORLD. THEY'RE IN THE spirit of
[1:56:42] tribulation.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DAY, GOD HAS MADE A BRIGHT
[1:56:49] AGE.
[1:56:51] HE'S MADE A DAY TO REVEAL HIS POWER THAT
[1:56:55] THE VINDICATED SUNLIGHT OF THE WORD MADE
[1:56:58] MANIFEST COULD SHINE OVER THIS END TIME
[1:57:02] PRIDE THAT YOU COULD DO BATTLE AGAINST
[1:57:05] YOUR ENEMY.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I'm closing for LISTEN NOW. WE ARE
[1:57:13] DEALING with a defeated enemy.
[1:57:16] [cheering]
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
[1:57:20] THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; HAS ALREADY CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND
[1:57:25] THE GRAVE.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN STRIPPED OF ALL OF HIS POWER.
[1:57:30] [applause and cheering]
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet of GOD WOULD SAY IT LIKE
[1:57:34] THIS.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; He would say,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; "We
[1:57:40] Amen. We are dealing with a defeated
[1:57:42] enemy."
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; And doomed devils are on the run.
[1:57:49] Glory to God.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; The sun is still shining.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; He tried to hide, but the sun's still
[1:57:56] shining.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; He tried to gather forces against you,
[1:57:59] but the sun's still shining.
[1:58:01] [cheering]
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS LIGHT? THE WORD made manifest is
[1:58:06] light.
[1:58:09] AND THE SAME LIFE THAT HAS EXPOSED THE
[1:58:11] DEVIL
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; is the same life that has ripened you to
[1:58:15] maturity. [cheering]
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE COME TO A PERFECT FAITH

[1:58:25] SAYING I am healed.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; I am I am delivered.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; JUST SIMPLY SAYING WHAT IS ALREADY
[1:58:32] WROTE.
[1:58:33] It's a confession. JUST CONFESSING WHAT
[1:58:36] HE ALREADY SAID. THAT'S PERFECT FAITH.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; JUST A SIMPLE FAITH THAT GOD SAID IT. I
[1:58:45] BELIEVE IT. It's settled.
[1:58:48] [cheering]
[1:58:50] [applause]
[1:58:51] THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS HE'S A DOOMED
[1:58:53] DEVIL. HE'S ALREADY DEFEATED. AND THEN
[1:58:55] HE SAID, "LOOK, I SEE HIS TAIL LIGHTS GO
[1:58:58] OVER THE HILL. [screaming] I SEE HIS RED
[1:59:00] TAIL LIGHTS GO OVER THE HILL." WELL, I
[1:59:03] TELL YOU, FRIENDS, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST

[1:59:09] [cheering and applause]

[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE DEVIL KEEPS TRYING to say
[1:59:14] you're the bluff.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; He takes those quotes and said, "Now,
[1:59:18] you can't bluff it now. You either got
[1:59:20] to have it or you don't."
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; And the devil tries to talk you out of
[1:59:23] the Holy Ghost.

[1:59:26] rights.

[2:00:15] the devil on the run."
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the problem with this last
[2:00:19] revival, that Pentecostal revival,
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; he says we did not." He said, "We led
[2:00:24] off."
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; We had him on the run.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.

[2:01:25] FIGHT. DADDIES, YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
[2:01:28] [screaming] TO FIGHT. CHURCH OF THE

[2:01:33] PROPHET FIGHTING FOR FOR TO GIVE GOD A
[2:01:36] FRESH DRINK OF PENTECOSTAL WATER. YOU
[2:01:39] FIGHT.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; YOU FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; People are so fearful. And I'm closing.
[2:01:55] Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the word corrects
[2:01:59] the error.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Remember he shot that 22 and he got it
[2:02:03] nine times in the same hole.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And then and then he got an affidava
[2:02:08] what took place and then it went off and
[2:02:11] he couldn't understand it. Y'all
[2:02:12] remember that?
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; He took a he sent it back to Winchester
[2:02:17] and they said, "Ah, it's a it's it's
[2:02:19] only good for 25 yards. It's just a
[2:02:21] little plinkster." But uh Mr. Brandom
[2:02:25] And brother Brand said, "But I I proved
[2:02:26] it.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I shot it at 50 yards in the same hole
[2:02:30] and it hit it every time."
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; His wife said, "Why? Why can't you just
[2:02:35] simply be satisfied with what the people
[2:02:37] who who who made the gun?
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Why can't you just BELIEVE WHAT THEY
[2:02:42] SAID?" HE SAID, "Because I proved it."
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He said he went hunting and all the
[2:02:50] other brothers could shoot the squirrel
[2:02:51] anywhere, you know.
[2:02:54] You know, they could get up and preach a
[2:02:56] sermon and it sounded good,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; but it would hit here and hit there and
[2:03:02] hit there. And brother Bam says, you
[2:03:05] know, I'm not satisfied
[2:03:07] with those denominational teachings and
[2:03:10] ideals of man. And
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; so he said, I'm sitting there, I'm
[2:03:17] leaning up against a tree and I'm
[2:03:19] crying. He said, why am I such a baby?
[2:03:22] and I why have you made me this way? Why
[2:03:25] can't I be like the other brothers?
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; And about that time, God spoke to him
[2:03:29] and said, I made you thus.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He said, because you know, if it hit it
[2:03:33] the if you hit it in the mark the target
[2:03:36] once, it'll do it again.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; If you hit it in the bullseye once,
[2:03:40] it'll do it again. If you aimed at the
[2:03:42] eyeball, and you hit it, it'll do it
[2:03:44] again.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:03:46] And you know that if Peter preached this
[2:03:48] and it hit the target and you preach it
[2:03:51] again, it'll do it again.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; If you preach what Paul preached, it'll
[2:03:55] produce the same effects.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God was
[2:04:03] correcting the error where they went
[2:04:05] off. The message of the hour was meeting
[2:04:09] the challenge of the age. The prophet OF
[2:04:12] GOD SAID THE CHALLENGE WAS DEALING with
[2:04:15] that uninspired leadership that was
[2:04:17] keeping the people so far below their
[2:04:20] privileges that they couldn't LIFT THEIR
[2:04:22] HEAD UP AND believe for even for A
[2:04:25] HEADACHE HARDLY THEY LET ALONE RAPTURING
[2:04:28] FAITH.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God says you got to
[2:04:34] you got to start stop living below your
[2:04:36] privileges.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; You got to realize WHO YOU ARE NOW. YE
[2:04:41] ARE THE SONS OF GOD. NOT GOING TO BE,
[2:04:44] BUT YOU ALREADY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. NOW
[2:04:47] REALIZE WHO YOUR WHERE YOUR POSITION IS.
[2:04:50] SEE YOUR PLACE IN THE WORD. Just as THE
[2:04:53] BRIDEGROOM CAME TO FULFILL THE Old
[2:04:55] Testament AND HE'S SEEN IN THE OLD
[2:04:56] TESTAMENT WHO HE WAS, SO THE BRIDE HAS
[2:05:00] COME AT THE END TIME TO FULFILL THE NEW
[2:05:02] TESTAMENT. SHE SEES HER POSITION IN THE
[2:05:06] WORD.
[2:05:10] the prophet in the message of grace.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Now, if you haven't heard that in a
[2:05:14] while, uh it'd do you good, I think, to
[2:05:16] just go back and listen to that message
[2:05:18] of grace.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon gives us some before he
[2:05:21] starts his sermon and starts reading
[2:05:24] there in Zechariah the 4th chapter of
[2:05:26] Azerubable.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He takes us to three rainbows
[2:05:29] he's seen while he
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; he's in the woods and it's still dark
[2:05:33] and
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; and it's rainy and he sees three
[2:05:37] rainbows coming up.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; And and and they're coming up, you know,
[2:05:41] and and and and then he's and then he
[2:05:45] turns and he sees Amen. It's it's like
[2:05:48] God brings his attention to a tree down
[2:05:51] the way and he goes to that tree and
[2:05:53] it's the same same place that just a
[2:05:56] year before he spoke squirrels into
[2:05:58] existence
[2:06:00] and the prophet of God is meditating
[2:06:02] upon that and describes the tree and and
[2:06:05] and if you remember the first time it
[2:06:09] happened brother Brandham was talking he
[2:06:11] was thinking about the scripture if you
[2:06:13] say into this mountain
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; and he was thinking about how sir
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; how how could it be that a man
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; this was before the atonement
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; not if I say but if you say
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; that's exactly
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; and then it took him back to Moses and
[2:06:29] how that Moses spoke creation into
[2:06:31] existence
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden that voice a
[2:06:35] voice began to talk to him and and take
[2:06:37] him through all of these things and you
[2:06:39] know and Moses and on and then he says
[2:06:41] now what do you have need of
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; and how that brother Brandham got
[2:06:45] excited Remember that he spun around and
[2:06:48] said, "Who? Who's there? Who am I
[2:06:51] talking to?"
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; And then God spoke back.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:06:57] Jacob. And understood who he was in the
[2:07:00] presence of omnipotence.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And then he tells him, "What do you have
[2:07:05] need of?" And brother Brandham couldn't
[2:07:07] think of anything. So he said, "Well,
[2:07:09] you need game, don't you?"
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "There was no squirrels
[2:07:12] anywhere."
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He said, "But he
[2:07:16] spoke and he said, and and there was a
[2:07:20] young red squirrel and and how the
[2:07:22] brother Brandon was still he got so e
[2:07:24] excited and and so caught up and like
[2:07:27] like is this really happening?"
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And and then the squirrel came and and
[2:07:33] remember he shot and he missed it
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; because he got ahead of where he said it
[2:07:39] was going to be.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And now here he IS IN THAT SAME VOICE.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; THE SAME POSITION.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "What do you have need
[2:07:53] of?" He said, "Oh,"
[2:07:56] he said, "Just, you know, the same
[2:07:58] amount as last time, the limit."
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "I no longer had said that."
[2:08:05] Then I said, "Now," he said, "I was in a
[2:08:07] swarm of mosquitoes and I said, now not
[2:08:09] one of them will bother me the rest of
[2:08:11] the day." He said, "And then the sun is
[2:08:13] going to shine in 30 minutes." He said,
[2:08:16] "And I'll have my limit by 10:00." He
[2:08:18] said, "Every one of those things
[2:08:20] happened, I have my limit by 3 minutes
[2:08:22] till 10:00."
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "As soon as I said that," he
[2:08:26] said, "I heard a chatter chatter and I
[2:08:28] turned around and there was a red young
[2:08:31] squirrel 70 yards away." He said, "I put
[2:08:34] up my rifle and he said, I could barely
[2:08:36] even see through that powerful scope. I
[2:08:38] could barely see its eyeball."
[2:08:40] He said, "But I just no more than just
[2:08:43] aimed above it and I pulled the trigger
[2:08:47] and it hit it right in the eyeball."
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; How did the prophet know?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; So relaxed,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; not nervous. He knew what was happening.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; You see, he had been there. He had
[2:09:01] already had that experience.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; And he knew. How did he know exactly
[2:09:07] that? All he had to do was just not even
[2:09:11] aim,
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; just simply put the gun above the
[2:09:14] squirrel
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; and pull the trigger.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; And the bullet knew exactly where to
[2:09:22] hit.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say, "I'm going to put
[2:09:27] the gun above it. I'm going to aim two
[2:09:30] inches above it. It's going to be like
[2:09:31] this. It's going to be like this. And
[2:09:33] then I'm going to hit." He didn't say
[2:09:35] that. He just said,
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; he just spoke it and then the Holy Ghost
[2:09:39] got a hold of it.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; You see, I immediately began to think of
[2:09:49] how that there was another example of
[2:09:51] that
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; and how that there was an anointed
[2:09:54] little boy
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; that had been overlooked by all of his
[2:09:58] brethren and all the great men of
[2:10:00] battle.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; He was just put on the back side of the
[2:10:03] desert with the sheep.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; But there was a lion and a bear that
[2:10:07] rose up and
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; he got that slingshot and he beat that
[2:10:12] lion, slung that stone and hit the line,
[2:10:14] hit the bear and then he grabbed a hold
[2:10:16] of it and killed it with his knife.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; As he come into the battle, he's seeing
[2:10:21] his brethren and they're all hiding,
[2:10:24] discouraged.
[2:10:25] For 40 days, they'd heard the boast of a
[2:10:29] giant.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Calling them the armies of Saul. Come
[2:10:33] and fight me. Bring a champion. The
[2:10:36] armies of Saul. Do you see when you
[2:10:39] leave the pillar of fire
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; and you leave the voice of omnipotence?
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; You're under another headship.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; All of them others were being
[2:10:53] identified. And you know what? They had
[2:10:54] to sit there and take it
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; for 40 days. That giant said, "You
[2:11:00] armies of Saul." Yeah.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; But when David showed up,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; he said, "Who is that uncircumcised
[2:11:07] Philistine that he would challenge the
[2:11:09] armies of the living God?"
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; You see, the revelation,
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; we're not under man.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; We're under the divine leadership of
[2:11:20] Almighty God.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS MORE than just a
[2:11:26] picture
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; over over that prophet. But that pillar
[2:11:30] of fire accompanies the message always.
[2:11:34] And this message is in you, in you, in
[2:11:37] you. AND WHEREVER [screaming] YOU GO,
[2:11:40] CHRIST is
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden David
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; said, "I'll go fight that giant."
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; And he began to dance. Now, this is what
[2:11:51] the prophet said. He danced all all the
[2:11:55] way down to that brook. And he got five
[2:11:57] stones. And then and then he danced all
[2:12:00] the way to to that giant. And the
[2:12:03] prophet of God said he had already seen
[2:12:06] by faith that giant falling and he took
[2:12:09] his head off.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Already saw it. So dancing is a sign of
[2:12:15] victory. And he was not defeated.
[2:12:19] He was going to battle with the
[2:12:22] revelation that he was fighting FROM THE
[2:12:26] POSITION OF VICTORY.
[2:12:30] I tell you, BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST,
[2:12:32] whether you can see it now OR WHETHER
[2:12:34] YOU'LL SEE IT TOMORROW or a month from
[2:12:37] now, BUT YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF Jesus
[2:12:40] Christ. You are the elect lady. You are
[2:12:43] an invincible army. And it's time that
[2:12:46] you recognize that your position, YOU
[2:12:49] ARE NOT FIGHTING FOR VICTORY. YOU ARE
[2:12:52] FIGHTING FROM THE POSITION OF VICTORY.
[2:12:55] [cheering]
[2:12:56] AND THE DEVIL IS NO MATCH FOR YOU.
[2:13:00] SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DANCE.
[2:13:03] [cheering and applause] YOU CAN PUT THAT
[2:13:05] CONFESSION IN THE SLINGSHOT OF YOUR
[2:13:08] MOUTH
[2:13:10] AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
[2:13:13] [screaming]
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; I AM HEALED.
[2:13:15] I AM RAPTURED. I AM DELIVERED.
[2:13:19] [cheering]
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; The whole time
[2:13:27] Goliath is making his boast, laughing.
[2:13:33] You sent a scrawny, ruddy little boy to
[2:13:36] FIGHT ME. BUT WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW IS
[2:13:39] THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF ZERUBABLE. IT'S
[2:13:42] A MESSAGE OF GRACE. IT'S NOT BY MIGHT.
[2:13:45] IT'S NOT BY POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY
[2:13:48] SPIRIT, saith the Lord. AND THE PROPHET
[2:13:51] OF GOD SAYS THE HOLY GHOST GOT A HOLD OF
[2:13:54] THAT STONE AND IT THAT STONE WENT A
[2:13:57] THOUSAND MILES a second.
[2:14:01] AND IT HIT BETWEEN THE ARMOR, THE ONLY
[2:14:04] PLACE IT COULD HIT. HOW DID DAVID KNOW
[2:14:06] IT?
[2:14:08] HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING ON
[2:14:11] [screaming] HIS OWN. IT WAS NOT HIS
[2:14:13] ABILITY, BUT HE WAS OVERCOMING IN THE
[2:14:17] SEASON OF GRACE. HE WAS ANOINTED,
[2:14:21] ANOINTED
[2:14:22] IN THE SEASON OF GRACE [screaming] TO
[2:14:25] DESTROY THE YOLKS OF THE DEVIL.
[2:14:30] [cheering and applause]
[2:14:36] [cheering]
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; The stone is confession.
[2:14:41] I know it looks I know it looks crazy.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; It may even look crazy to your family,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; but if you've got a wavered son or a
[2:14:49] daughter, go ahead and speak it. They're
[2:14:51] saved. They may be drug addicts, but
[2:14:54] they're coming home. They're coming
[2:14:56] home. What are you doing? upon the
[2:14:59] authority of the vindicated
[2:15:03] spoken word of omnipotence. You are
[2:15:06] confessing the same thing THAT HAS BEEN
[2:15:09] PROVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK IT AND THE HOLY GHOST GETS A
[2:15:21] HOLD OF IT. [cheering]
[2:15:27] It'll hit the mark.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME?
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO CALCULATE THE QUOTES.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK the quotes.
[2:15:41] [cheering]
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; David already knew. It was time-tested,
[2:15:45] time-tested testimonies. He already knew
[2:15:48] the effects, the lion and the bear. And
[2:15:51] he SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE ONE OF
[2:15:52] THOSE, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR HEAD
[2:15:54] OFF." AND THEN HE WENT FORWARD to make
[2:15:58] IT HAPPEN.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE it
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; and then he ran to make it good.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Friends, the Let the musicians come,
[2:16:08] friends. The prophet of God said, "If
[2:16:09] there's ever a time to speak,
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; it's now."
[2:16:15] [cheering and applause]
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; David didn't have to get prayed up.
[2:16:20] The prophet of God says God got him
[2:16:23] prayed up before the foundation of the
[2:16:24] world
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; of God.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; If there is ever a time
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; to realize
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; that the only ones that can use this
[2:16:36] word
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; to kill the enemy
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; is this elect lady.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; You're elected for it.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Five stars aligned in 62. And the
[2:16:46] prophet of God says it's grace.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; And the power of God has begun to fall
[2:16:51] upon this bride. Friends, we're no
[2:16:53] longer just an infant bride. We are a
[2:16:57] bride that has come into position.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; A mature a mature bride. We're not just
[2:17:03] fighting with quotes any longer.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; We're putting our the quotes in our
[2:17:07] mouth. We're convinced.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; We're convinced. I honestly I I I am
[2:17:14] taking too much liberty.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; When it comes to this message,
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; you can take it
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; or you can leave it.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; But as for me, I'm convinced.
[2:17:32] [cheering]
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; It's the answer for my children, my
[2:17:34] wife, my home. It's my rapture. I'm
[2:17:37] convinced.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you want to talk, I'll
[2:17:42] talk. But I'm not going. You're I I'm
[2:17:45] already convinced.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; IT IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD FOR MY LIFE.
[2:17:52] Supreme authority.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; I've already seen the miraculous. I've
[2:17:56] already seen the vindication. I've
[2:17:58] already seen deliverances take place.
[2:18:00] HEALINGS TAKE PLACE. MIRACLES TAKE
[2:18:02] PLACE. CANCERS DROP OFF. BLIND EYES
[2:18:04] OPEN. BUT I'VE SEEN THE GREATEST
[2:18:06] MIRACLE. LIVES THAT THE DEVIL HAD
[2:18:09] DESTROYED. AND GOD RESTORED THEM BACK TO
[2:18:12] THEIR RIGHT MINDS. FILL THEM WITH THE
[2:18:14] HOLY GHOST.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; It's a living word.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; I'll just say what the prophet of God
[2:18:23] said about it. I'm riding on it.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; I I'm not fighting with it. I'm riding
[2:18:28] on it.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Step into it.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord has stirred the
[2:18:37] waters.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] step into it
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; and say it's my inheritance.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Every say let's just
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; let's say you are God alone
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; from before time began.

[2:19:02] You are God alone.

[2:19:25] [music] You are not a God [singing]
[2:19:28] created

[2:19:44] in [music] need of
[2:19:46] anything we can give [singing]
