[55:16] amen we are aware of our struggle in the
[55:19] body but still let's aim to do what the
[55:21] prophet said regardless of what you're
[55:24] doing if you can discipline yourself
[55:26] yourself to look at your phone every day
[55:29] why can't you discipline yourself to
[55:31] read the Holy
[55:34] Scripture huh why can't you discipline
[55:37] yourself to read the Holy
[55:38] scripture when it come to your phone you

[1:05:15] mighty he God judges among the gods you
[1:05:21] might be seated verse
[1:05:23] six I have said this is God saying you
[1:05:27] can cut this off I'm going with my thing
[1:05:29] yes please thank you I have said ye are
[1:05:34] gods and all of you are children of the
[1:05:38] most high amen am we say this multiple
[1:05:42] time that verse six it's pertaining to
[1:05:46] our D
[1:05:48] part our divine
[1:05:52] part our clean part
[1:05:55] are we clear and then verse seven this
[1:05:59] is where the trouble is the Bible says
[1:06:03] but God himself is saying but so there
[1:06:07] is a problem right there but you shall
[1:06:10] die like men and fall like one of the
[1:06:14] princes so this one is our human
[1:06:19] part or our Earthly
[1:06:22] part which is connected to sin
[1:06:26] and to
[1:06:28] fall
[1:06:29] Etc everything bad and basically last
[1:06:34] week last Sunday this is the
[1:06:39] Beast amen amen amen amen this is the
[1:06:43] quote we read last Sunday and according
[1:06:47] to this quote brother Bram say that let
[1:06:50] us make men in our own
[1:06:54] image and if if he made man in his own
[1:06:58] image he made a supernatural being we
[1:07:02] clear it together amen yes indeed
[1:07:07] Genesis 1:28 read and see if this is not
[1:07:10] right and then when he made man in his
[1:07:13] own image he had ruler over the
[1:07:18] beasts so the supernatural being amen
[1:07:22] rules the Beast
[1:07:26] the supernatural being rule have
[1:07:30] rulership over the
[1:07:33] Beast over the
[1:07:37] Beast we okay okay praise God he says
[1:07:41] and he led the beasts around them like
[1:07:46] the holy spirit is supposed to lead the
[1:07:50] church so man was the Holy Ghost of the
[1:07:54] Beast
[1:07:55] there

[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:23] God are we together
[1:17:25] are we
[1:17:27] together brother Bram says this in the
[1:17:30] message testimony he says always want to
[1:17:33] think it to be the act of the Holy
[1:17:37] Spirit In The Water brother Bram didn't
[1:17:40] want to called The Book of act the book
[1:17:42] of the Apostle Act of the Apostle
[1:17:45] brother say that's not correct it is the
[1:17:48] act of the Holy Ghost where the act of
[1:17:52] God in human being
[1:17:58] I don't know if we're together and we
[1:18:00] found out that when God enter human
[1:18:03] being Peter changed his
[1:18:05] terminology he says what I have I give
[1:18:09] it to you we found out that even the
[1:18:12] shadow of
[1:18:13] Peter begin to heal the people they took
[1:18:17] apron and they touched the Apostle and
[1:18:20] healed the people and as a matter of
[1:18:22] fact even philli was stress
[1:18:27] sled are we together are we together
[1:18:31] needed an airplane but there was no
[1:18:34] airplane and God took him God in the man
[1:18:39] took him as an airplane and he traveled
[1:18:43] to a different
[1:18:49] place are we together are we together
[1:18:53] are we together am
[1:18:57] listen to me carefully this might be too
[1:18:59] strong okay Jesus went to heaven after
[1:19:04] his
[1:19:09] resurrection Jesus went to heaven with a
[1:19:12] glorified body but when the Holy Spirit
[1:19:15] enter man with a natural body not a
[1:19:19] glorify one Philip used the Natural Body
[1:19:23] and then was transposed by a natural
[1:19:27] body in other word the Holy Ghost in man
[1:19:31] is more
[1:19:34] [Applause]
[1:19:38] powerful than the Holy Ghost In
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:46] Jesus don't say Amen I'm going to repeat
[1:19:49] it again the Holy Ghost in man is more
[1:19:52] powerful than in Jesus
[1:19:56] exactly I don't think so that's why
[1:19:59] Jesus say the works that I do you will
[1:20:03] do it
[1:20:12] even even worker and the
[1:20:14] work that's why Bram say when Jesus
[1:20:17] created he always uses
[1:20:20] materials they give him a bread to make
[1:20:23] bread they give fish to make fish but in
[1:20:30] thiser when brother came out of nothing
[1:20:35] let a squirel be there let a squirel be

[1:31:00] choice okay I don't condone with it I am
[1:31:05] 100% against it but I got to use that

[1:31:21] boy
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:24] they take his diaper off he's a

[1:31:35] woman and then he believe it so much
[1:31:38] until he begin to even act like a
[1:31:41] woman and that's an
[1:31:44] impersonation but what I'm telling you

[3:00:25] the eyes don't open he open only a
[3:00:28] little bit to see man as a tree but
[3:00:32] there is a mystery it help us understand
[3:00:35] the serpent
[3:00:39] seed because he sees man as a tree so
[3:00:43] when we go back in the Garden of Eden
[3:00:45] when we see the tree of Good and Evil we
[3:00:47] know now that it's people it is not trth

[3:02:16] reason why when the BR will leave this
[3:02:18] earth it's going to be hell and Chaos
[3:02:21] because Deliverance is gone the blood is
[3:02:24] taken off the Earth that's why the

[3:02:40] something didn't happen no wonder you
[3:02:42] came up Lord with the parable of the
[3:02:45] unjust judge and you told your disciple
[3:02:48] to always pray and never to lose heart
[3:02:51] because you
[3:02:52] will answer your elect and you will
[3:02:55] answer them speedily Father I commit
[3:02:57] them unto the hand touch the he sick and
[3:03:01] those that were Afflicted Lord father
[3:03:03] May everyone that has been struggling

[3:03:14] may D overlay on the inside and the
[3:03:18] outside so that Lord father once again
[3:03:21] this Earth will see a manifested son and
