Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I am very very happy about what the Lord about what the Lord is doing. So it was like two weeks before having all of this sermon. I keep having the same dream like I had the dream like three days one two three three days following one after the other one. The first time I saw myself walking on the road and as I was walking on the road, anytime I would make I I would make a step, they would deposit uh a a big sum of money on my side that I had to pick up. I would try to make another step, they put another uh another big amount of money on on my step. I'll be walking like that and I woke up for my dream. In the dream, I saw some of the people that I know. They were standing on the side and they were like, why only you? So, I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do, but something keep telling me it's for you. You need to take it. Whenever we drop it, you take it. That was the the first time. The second time I saw again, I was going somewhere, they keep dropping that on my way. So then I I I woke up I say two time it means something. So I went I asked my my husband what's what is the meaning of money according to brother Brana? He say the money means the the p purchasing power purchase power. Okay thank you for helping me. The money means purchase power. So spiritually it means also faith. So I was like okay I think the Lord is dropping faith whenever we are moving on the the Lord is providing us sufficient faith to deal with our problem. So I take it in a spiritual way. I told the Lord I'm taking it that way. Then my husband came with uh a testimony here where a brother gave uh $18,000. Then some spoke to me. You see, it's not just spiritual. &gt;&gt; So that's why I was shouting there because my husband didn't tell me. I I heard the testimony here in church &gt;&gt; and before you know that again, he brought up another testimony, another someone say he want to send 5,000, another one also. So I went back to my bedroom where I pray and knelt down. I say Lord Jesus now I understood you are not speaking only spiritually as I was thinking is the both aspect spiritually and naturally naturally or I don't know how to say both way so I say Lord Jesus thank you so much right now I'm calling those spiritual blessings spiritual or financial I call them in the name of Jesus from the north from the south from the west I call them and I receive them in Jesus Christ's name &gt;&gt; because I know you have decided I don't have any choice but to receive &gt;&gt; because some then some something spoke to me what do you think about Solomon in the Bible because what Solomon had was just a dream the same way you had a dream so why you doubting so I'm like Lord forgive me I'm taking it I'm receiving in Jesus Christ's name &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; coming to church when the pastor start preaching about the the parable of the 10 pound I understood how God would give us faith you know the 10 pound was f that's why I was rejoicing because the lord confirmed to me that it's spiritually and naturally so I thank God for that something else happened the same s this s last Sunday a couple came from uh uh Kentucky and if You remember the name of the brother? The brother was brother William Mariam and the sister was sister Addie and Addy, right? So when we went outside, the Lord confirmed to me, you heard the sermon, they told you about faith and everything. You see this couple, they came the day they preaching this. So the Lord was trying to explain to me my dream to make to convince me that it's not just just spiritually as I was thinking. It's it's spiritually and phys uh naturally. So he say they are they are a sign brother Brham bringing you the faith of the rapture the the faith of the third pool because this is William Brham this is right. &gt;&gt; So you understand now I say Lord I receive it. I accept it in Jesus name. Hallelujah. God bless you. [Applause] God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. I'm happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And you see when when one person receives it is for the whole church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as she's receiving, I'm also receiving. Sister Sharon, you can you can continue. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am sorry. This is this is God. Because I told my husband something spoke to me. Even though the in the in the dream it was me, I was representing the church as a woman. So he just say that. &gt;&gt; So that is I I've been told that forgive me church. I forgot. That's God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We're going to invite brother Khalima. Amen. Amen. And even as we have said it, it is established. &gt;&gt; Amen. My God. Why don't we all stand? I also have a short testimony.

May God bless you tonight. Let's just bow our heads together and have a word of prayer before we would uh go to the word. And if you have a need upon your heart, just ask the Lord to come minister to you and uh just lift your hand before the Lord to show that you would have a need. Father, Lord, we're so honored to be able to call you that, Lord. And Lord, it's by revelation to know that we came out of the eternities, Lord. And one day we'll go back to where we come from, Father. Lord, as Abraham uh was looking for that bu that that city whose builder and maker was God. Truly, Lord, we're looking for that same city. And Lord, we believe that by faith, Abraham, he sojourned in a strange land. And truly, we're here tonight, Lord, sojouring in a strange land. This world is not our home, but Lord, we are looking for that same great city, Father. And Lord, we just pray this evening, Lord, that the the king of that city would come. And Lord, you would be here in our midst, Father. We we don't want to just welcome you to come or ask you to come. But Lord, we we want to make you feel welcome, Lord. We want you to be comfortable, Father, to move in our midst, Lord. And may you just have your will and your way, Father. May you just search us, Lord, and try us. And Lord, discern the thoughts and intents of our heart, Lord, and see if there be any evil thing in us, Lord. And if you find anything, may you just cut it out by that sharp two-edged sword of your word. Lord, we just give you preeminence in this service. I ask you that you would heal the sick and the afflicted, encourage the discouraged. Lord, I believe that you can so curate this service, Father, that you can speak to every individual here, Lord. Maybe someone disappointed or discouraged. May you minister to that person's life this evening, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would just help me to get out of your way. You know, Lord, the only gift I have is to surrender to you. I'm asking for your help tonight, Lord. May you help your children to just put off the things of tomorrow and and what they've got going on today and may they just pull up to the table as it were and begin to hear what the spirit would say to them. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just give everything into your hands. We pray you'd help us now as we look to your word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God richly bless you this evening. Uh if you have your Bibles, I'll just go and invite you to be uh turning in in the scripture. Uh two places I'd like to read the first place in 2 Kings the 6th chapter as well as uh 2 Corinthians. As you're turning there, I just want to be sure and greet you the name of the Lord tonight and greet you from our pastor, brother Josh Bennett. He certainly loves you and appreciates you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um as Stephen mentioned just briefly, I was just in Africa uh for about a week to 10 days. And um I was just sharing with him, I was in uh a city there in Kenya, Africa, and I had many people coming up to me saying, "Are you brother Solomon?" I'm like, "Yeah, I am." We we know exactly who you are. Like how do you how do you know who I am? You never met me before. They're like, "Well, you do you know Brother Shimbo?" I'm like, "Absolutely." Like we watch Brother Shimbo's sermons all the time. and they said, "We're so blessed by that church and their worship and the ministry." And I was just very uh proud. I thought, "My, there's fruits of this ministry uh on a 30-hour journey on the other side of the world." And uh it was such a tremendous blessing and and those people, they uh they're hungry for the word &gt;&gt; and they're hungry for the word to be preached straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh not not not watered down, not not compromised, not anything like that. And I think that's what we need more of. And we just need people just to preach the word. And amen, just like the prophet preached it. And and you know, uh the the people there were just tremendously blessed. And they told me when I came back here, they said, "Be sure and greet that church for me and tell them how much we how much we appreciate them." So I wanted to be sure and do that for them. and they send their love and support and prayers and I just want you to know you're a great blessing to a portion of the bride on other side of the world and I think that's a great honor to be a part of that. So &gt;&gt; uh may God bless them and bless you this evening. Let's read here together I don't want to prolong the service very much but here in 2 Kings the 6th chapter uh begin reading at the 8th verse familiar scripture to us. The Bible says, "Then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servant, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp." &gt;&gt; And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, "Beware that thou pass not such a place, for thither the Syrians are come down." And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. Notice the scripture. And therefore, the heart of the king of Syria was so troubled for this thing. &gt;&gt; In other words, he he's so troubled. He's saying, "Who's the traitor?" And and who's who's given away our plans? And he called his servants and said unto them, "Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?" And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel. He tellth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In in 2 Corinthians the 2 chapter and the 11th verse. The Bible says, "Lest Satan should get an advantage of us." Lest Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask God to bless his word and you can be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And from these scriptures, I want to draw a subject of discernment of spirits. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Discernment of spirits. And I'm sure you're familiar. Brother Brandon preached that sermon titled exactly that. And uh he preached on discernment of spirits and said a lot of great powerful things about it. And I think as believers, the prophet taught us, he said that we are ordered by God to discern the spirit of everything. Now, now, now sometimes you got to slow down and re-evaluate and think about it. But, uh, we're called as the bride of Jesus Christ to stop a minute and discern the spirit of what what's the spirit motivating this? What's the spirit motivating that? because uh something may seem innocent, but there's a bad spirit behind it. So, you're called to discern the spirit. And then when you discern it, it's up to you. What do you do after you discern it? So, if you've discerned something as the prophet's telling us, if you discern something and realize, hey, this is not of God, then we are called by God to get get away from that thing. So, amen. We know as the bride of Christ that we are called to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. And you know, I just appreciate how simple brother Random made things because uh he never he never put some kind of gray line. But but it was always there's only two spirits that work within the framework of the Christian church and there's only two spirits in the world today. Now, now I know a lot of people they try to blur that, but there's only two spirits that influence absolutely everything in the world. &gt;&gt; And everything you face in a Christian life, it's being either influenced by God or by the devil. Now, now what does the devil come along to do? He tries to say, well, you know, that's not alltogether bad and that's not alltogether good. And so that's how the devil works is because amen, the prophet's so clear on it. He said the way the devil works is through shrewdness and he comes in so subtle and so little and you think well you know it's it's altogether not that bad but it's altogether not that good. And so you got to ask yourself is this thing of God or is this thing of the devil? Amen. And see, the prophet said that we are called to discern the spirit and see what is the spirit of the thing. Amen. The Bible talked about to try the spirits. Now, now, now it's uncomfortable to do it, but you're demanded to do it by the scripture. Amen. Try the spirit and see is that of God or is that not of God. And so we see here in the scripture that Elisha, he was a prophet, he was a seer and he would see into another realm. He would see into the future. And he would see uh the plans of the Syrian army before those plans was even, if I could say it this way, he saw in the beginning stages of what the plans were going to be a year down the road or or or next week, how the Syrian army was going to attack. And Elisha knew exactly, hey, they're going to come down this valley and they're going to come down this hill. And so the prophet would tell the children of Israel, don't go to such and such a place and don't go here and don't go here. Now, if if Israel was spiritual enough, they would listen to what the prophet said. Because you got to realize that prophet had eyesight that they didn't know anything about. And he was seeing something into the future. Amen. see a prophet and and to me and you we're seeing it's so infant and it's so small and it's so little but the prophet is seeing something in infancy but yet he's seeing it in maturity at the same time and you'll realize brother Brandham said he said destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you and so you'll realize that that's exactly how the enemy works is he starts out something so small and so little. But you got to understand, a little problem turns into a big problem if it's left unattended. A little spirit turns into a big spirit unless it's unattended. Is that right? Amen. A small spirit of lust turns into divorce if it's left unattended. That's exactly right. Listen, sister. You got to deal with something when it's small. If you don't, I mean, why in the world would you wait till you got stage four cancer, when you can get rid of it while it's manageable? Why would we want to wait till it's so progressed that they say it's terminal and there's no help. But see, a true spiritual person would deal with something at the beginning of it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so we realize that we're called to deal with stuff before it grows up. We're we're called to discern that spirit and stop it. I mean, let me tell you, the enemy is a real enemy. &gt;&gt; And he don't want what's best for you. All he wants to do is to kill, steal, and destroy. Amen. He's the friend that'll convince you to do something, then go call the cops on you while you're doing it. That's the kind of enemy that we're serving. He He convinced you to go rob a bank and then call the cops on you. Is that right? That's the kind of enemy that you and I are up against. Listen. Amen. He don't want what's best for you. He wants to destroy you. And unless you realize it's him working, he'll do just that. And so the prophet would see the tactics of that Syrian army and he would constantly reveal these tactics and and he did it in such a way that the literal king of Syria said if there's got to be a traitor that's amongst us because every time we go to do something, they know exactly what we're going to do. Every time we try to go hit here and hit here, they know exactly what we're where we're going to hit, how we're going to fight, what we're going to do. And that's the way it ought to be with you and I, brother, sister. Amen. We know the tactics of the enemy because God has sent us a prophet like an unto Elisha. And when the devil comes in here and the devil comes in here, we say, "Devil, I see that you working. That is not my brother. That is not my sister, but that is a spirit. Amen. Even Jesus himself had to rebuke his disciple Peter. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let me just preach here for a moment. Because he had Peter and Peter was trying to get Jesus to go against the word. Is that right? And he said, "Peter, I rebuke you, Satan. Get be." Could you imagine who Satan? I'm your disciple. What do you mean, Satan? He said, "You're being influenced by Satan." Peter, you don't mean to say that. You don't mean to talk like that, but you're being influenced by an evil spirit. And I'm not influ And I'm not ignorant of Satan's devices. You got to realize the devil will use your family. The devil will use your spouse. &gt;&gt; The devil will use the people in the church. He'll use whoever he can use to influence. I'm not saying they're the devil. I'm saying they're being influenced by that spirit. And the prophet said if the devil can get us fighting against one another, he could just sit there and fold his arms because we're doing the devil's work. Amen. I think it's a shame, brother, sister. Amen. When we're fighting against brother and we're fighting against sister, the devil just sits there and lets us fight and lets us war and he's just laughing, sitting in hell. See, I didn't even have to do what he's saying because he's talking against him and he's talking against the pastor and well, is that the truth this evening? He's doing this and he's and you don't realize that you're doing the work of the devil and the devil's just sitting back while you're destroying one another and destroying each other's character. Listen, don't you be a mouthpiece for the devil. You be a mouthpiece for God himself. Don't you be influenced by the God of this evil age, but you be influenced by the real and living God. Well, I just speak what comes to my mind. That ain't always good. Well, I just speak what I think. That ain't always good. Well, that's just who I am. Well, maybe that's not what you should be. You ought to run everything you think by the word. You ought to run everything you say by the word. The Bible tells us that death and life are in the power of the tongue. And you're pronouncing death. and you're pronouncing all of these things and you wonder why you're discouraged and you're defeated. It's because you pronounced it on yourself. You spoke it on yourself and you're manifesting it yourself. Amen. Do you realize there's so much power in what you speak? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it matters. Well, according to the word, it does. Why do you think when God told Moses when Moses is complaining, "Well, God, I don't know about this and I don't know about this." And God said, "Why cry, Moses, speak? &gt;&gt; Why cry, Moses, speak?" And we say, "Well, you know, we've got power to speak a world and go live on." Listen, I'm not concerned about speaking another earth and going and living on it, but I want to speak my own earth right here today. I want to live in my own atmosphere. Do you realize you're an amateur creator? Do you realize the Bible said that ye are gods? You've got the power to change the situation. You got the power to change your environment. You've got the power as the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. The problem of it is is you're poor in your mind. That's why you're poor in your spirit. But my father, he owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Oh, praise the Lord. You're not poor, you're rich. You're not sick, you're healed. It's the truth, brother. Amen. It's the word that's in your mouth, and it's what you pronounce, and it's what you say. I'm saying the job is on the way. I'm saying the check is on the way. But brother, I don't know about all that, but I do know about that because my God is Jehovah Gyra. Amen. My God is Jehovah Rafa. He's everything I have need of financially with my family, with my church. He's got everything I need and he's waiting on me to believe for it. Amen. The problem why people don't get nothing is because they don't believe for it. They don't believe God can give them a job. They don't believe God can restore their marriage. They don't believe God can do it. And so it never happens to them. But to those that believe that God is concerned about the detail, let me tell you, God is concerned about the detail of your life. The place that you work, the place you go to school, the living that you got, God is concerned about it. You got to have discernment of spirit enough to realize God is concerned about it. It's the devil is telling you don't ask God. It's the devil is telling you, "Oh, that's too impossible. Oh, that's too you think God is telling you that." You think God is telling you, "Don't don't bother me with that. Don't ask me about that. I What do you think I am?" Amen. The prophet said directly, "God wants to be bothered." That's a direct quote. God wants to be bothered. Hey, you bothering everybody else. Why don't you bother God about your job? Why don't you bother God about your family? Why don't you bother God about your situation? Well, let's just preach for a moment. Why don't you stop bothering the pastor and bothering this and bothering that and go to the throne of God and say, "God, I've got a need." And you said that you will provide all. You'll provide all of my needs. What kind of God do you serve? I don't serve a little God. I serve a big God. I don't serve a halfway God. I serve a big God. How big is your God? My God is big enough. Every need I got, every situation I got, my God is big enough. [Applause] I believe it this afternoon. My God's big enough. He can handle it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you got to believe it. &gt;&gt; You got to believe it. You got to believe that God can do it. &gt;&gt; Was that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you ever thought about it? What spirit is it that's telling you don't go to God over that? &gt;&gt; What spirit is it? Amen. Have discernment of spirit. What spirit is it that's telling you that God can't bless you in that way? &gt;&gt; That don't ask God about that. Listen, I'm telling you, brother, sister, I believe we got everything we need in the word of God. I mean everything in this message. Everything. I believe the question for the young people is in the message. I believe the questions of your marriage is in the message. I believe where you ought to work is in the message. I believe the right mental attitude is in the message. I believe how you ought to raise your children is in the message. I believe God gave us everything we need. Now, if you don't believe that, I just can't help you. But it's what I believe. I believe we've got everything we need. Why in the world would I go seeking after something, Amen, some psychologist or or this here or this here or or &gt;&gt; this program or this program? Amen. Have you ever tried the Lord? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Have you ever tried the Lord? &gt;&gt; Well, you tried Indeed. You tried Zip Recruit. You've tried Walmart.com. &gt;&gt; You've tried this. You've tried that. Have you ever tried the Lord? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried the Lord? I've been there where I didn't have a job lined up and I watched God come on the scene and give me job after job after job. Amen. And the fact of the matter is this is I got pushed into a corner to where I had nowhere to turn but God. But you don't got to be pushed into a corner. Amen. If you got faith enough, you can ask God right now. Oh, hallelujah. I said you can ask God right now. You don't have to wait for the interview. You can ask God right now. Lord, I need you to provide for me and for my family. &gt;&gt; What's the truth this evening? &gt;&gt; I believe God's got it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to have discernment of spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll realize that that that that Elisha here in the Bible that that he knew more about the situation than Israel did. &gt;&gt; That's why they went to Elisha. Elisha, where's the enemy going to come and how's it going to be? All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Why in the world would you go somewhere else when you've got a &gt;&gt; Why would you go somewhere else when you got a vindicated prophet's message that is ordained to lead you and guide you all the way through. Listen, this ain't a message to leave us in the wilderness. This is a message to bring us to the promised land. This ain't just a message of Moses come out of her. It's a message of Joshua as well. It's a dual ministry. It's a Joshua come out of her my people. And it's a Moses go into the fullness of the promise of God. That's what this message was sent to do. Amen. To bring us out of the world and then out of the church. Well, it's just the truth. You are the called out of the called out of the called out and you are called to go all the way in into the fullness of the word of God. Amen. How long are we going to walk around the mountain? How long are we going to ramble in the wilderness? We've been given a message to go all the way into the promise. But there's a provided way to do it. There's a right way to do it. Listen, there's only one way, brother, sister. You ain't going to obtain rapturing faith out here in the world. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You're not going to obtain rapturing faith by by some other message. But our message was given to us to bring rapturing faith. You do you realize it takes a perfect word to bring perfect faith? And listen, this message is perfect. It's a perfect word that produces perfect faith and it's producing a perfect bride. How are we being perfected? We're being perfected by the word. Praise the Lord. I say we're being perfected by the word. You said, "Well, I don't see a lot happening." Every sermon that you hear, it is perfecting you and it's causing a perfection to come over your life. That's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we we understand here that that the prophet knew more about the situation. If I can say it this way. Amen. Like your parents growing up and they told you don't touch the pot on the stove. The pot is hot. &gt;&gt; And many of us we needed to get a greater revelation that it was hot. But what do they know? I'm going to go touch the pot anyhow. And then you got burned and you said and you cry. Why are you crying for? You knew better. &gt;&gt; You knew better. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the prophet forbade something and said to stay away from that, why in the world would you want to get remotely close? Listen, can I tell you this? This is not the hour to see how close to the world you can walk. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach for a moment. This is not the hour to see what you can get away with, how close to the line you can walk. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be driving here at the cliff's edge. I want to be driving hugging the hugging the mountain. I want to be driving hugging the mountain. Well, you know, I'm a skilled enough driver that I can I can drive right where the cliff is. No, you're just a dumb driver. You're not skilled because you drive here at the edge where the cliff is. Amen. You're just cocky your mind and think you'll get away with it. Amen. But see, to the true church of the living God, we don't want to see how close to sin we can get. We want to see how close to God can I possibly walk? How close to this man? I don't know about you, but that's my revelation. Why do I want to see how close to the world I can walk and still remain bride? I want to see, Lord, how close to your word can I walk and still remain on earth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How close to the word can I walk without being raptured yet? Let me tell you, one day there's going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; One day there'll be I still believe in that. Do you? One day there'll be the change of our bodies. Amen. And I've got discernment enough to tell you that day is coming here soon. If it ain't tomorrow, it'll be the next day. Amen. Listen, you I'm looking for it. I'm looking for the change of my body. Amen. I've got discernment enough to see the the the the signs of the time and the conditions of this world. And it can't last much longer. And I can't wait, brother, sister. Amen. To where this this mortality takes on immortality. I cannot wait till I get a body to match my soul. My soul has already been redeemed. This is the season of rapture. It's the season of rapture. Amen. And to those that believe it, they preach about it. They talk about it. They think about it. To the people that don't believe in it, they don't preach it. &gt;&gt; They don't think about it. They don't talk about it. But to the people that believe it, they're thought they're they're they're talking about it. They're thinking about it. Amen. Listen, I can't wait for it, brother, sister. Amen. I can't wait to see the Lord that saved me. I can't wait to I believe in a literal returning as the prophet said of Jesus Christ. I can't wait to behold him and embrace him. I can't wait to see the Lord that saved me. I can't wait to see the Lord that snatched me out of the fire. I can't wait to see him that has done great things. And I believe one day soon. Amen. Right now, I'm feeling the effects of him. Amen. Remember, there's coming a day there'll be a literal returning of our Lord again. And when we see him, we will be like him. We'll have a body like is under his glorious body. But I'm not waiting to get a new body before I worship my king. I'm not waiting to get a new body before I give him the glory that he's deserving of. But right now in this past house, my lungs will give glory and honor unto my God. My feet will dance, my hands will live. While I'm trapped in this body, I will still give him what is rightfully his. &gt;&gt; Oh, when folks say, "Oh, brother, you know, when I got no more problems, I really worship God." No, you won't. If you won't worship God in your situation, you won't worship God out of it. If you won't worship God while you're sick. You won't worship God when you're healthy. If you won't worship God when everything ain't going your way. You won't worship God when it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; You've got to have discernment. &gt;&gt; I'm getting pulled everywhere. I'm trying to get somewhere. The the the the prophet told a story. He told a story of a mechanic was out there working on a vehicle in in the garage and and that man was working and and and the prophet said, "Here come a a man that was well-dressed. He walked up and looked at him a few moments." He said to the mechanic after he he let him butt his head for a little while. He said, "Why don't you just touch this here because you're not getting any current?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he turned around and said, "Well, who are you?" He said, "You know who it was? It was the chief engineer of General Motors. He made the vehicle. He designed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. See what it was. This man was here working on this vehicle and he tried this and he tried that and he tried this and he tried that and nothing was working for him. He just couldn't come to victory. Oh, glory. He couldn't come to victory and he couldn't get it to start. And the chief engineer of General Motors, he says, "See, the issue of it is is you're not getting any current." You ever been there? You're not getting any current. He said, "But if you'll touch this here," he said, then it'll start back up. And do you realize that's what the prophet's ministry come to do? Because the church wasn't getting any current. Hallelujah. The church wasn't getting any current. Oh, sure. Sure, it could shout a little bit. Sure, it could say amen a little bit, but it could not overcome and it could not go down the road. And the prophet says here, he said where they failed is they got away from the Holy Ghost and they got away from the dynamics of the Holy Ghost. Let me tell you, I don't care how revelated we get. You've got to have the dynamics of the Holy Ghost to make the word live in your life. There ain't nothing wrong with you. You just need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You don't got a problem. You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? You ain't got some issue wrong with you. Ain't nothing wrong with the vehicle you're in. You just got to have the quickening power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You got to have the quickening power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And see, we've got I think it's such a powerful quote here the prophet's talking about. He said there was a man that came up. It was the engineer General Motor. He designed it. He knew about it. &gt;&gt; And that's why God sent us this message. Amen. And took the prophet into that realm of spirits. Amen. So he could I think some of the most powerful messages is demonology in the physical and demonology in the spiritual. The prophet breaks it down. If you had to listen to them and be very encouraging to listen to because the prophet's breaking down and show them that we're all affected in a spirit realm. &gt;&gt; And he said the flesh body when you've got an element in the body and a sickness in the body. He said what it actually is is there's a spirit in there and that spirit is holding that nerve. And so that pain is caused by a spirit. And see what the devil does is he comes to you and say, "Well, you know, it ain't it ain't really me. It's just your body. It's just your just your sick. That's how the devil works in." He said, "You're just in a fallen body. You just got to deal with it. You You just got to live in this condition." And all the while, it is a spirit that's coming to your mind. And if he gets you to believe that it's not him and that it's not a spirit, then he's got you beat and you'll be living with that condition. And you'll be coping with that condition because you think it's got to stay that way. But I'm here to tell you, you don't got to cope with the condition. You don't got to cope with the devil. You don't got to cope with a problem. But there was a God here. There was the light of God. and he can drive away every spirit of darkness that wants to hold you bound. Oh, y'all know what I'm talking about. That devil that tries to bind you in your spirit. That devil that tries to bind you in your mind and he comes against you and tries to bind you in your body. There is a God here that can drive away any spirit in hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirits of tiredness. &gt;&gt; There was a sister I heard one time, I'll share this with you. A sister I heard one time she she kept on coming to church and as soon as she sat down, she just &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I I know I know Wednesday night we &gt;&gt; I know Wednesday night we worked. I worked today, too. But I want to show you this because it shows you how sly the devil is. This sister, she she sat down and she just just fall asleep. &gt;&gt; And it started plaguing her. She said, "My why why can I not stay asleep during the preaching of the word? I I I can sit down at my home and I'm fine. And I can sit here and I'm fine and I can sit here and I'm fine. But when I come to church and sit here, I fall asleep." and she was hearing a preaching of the word one day and she realized, wait a minute, that's a spirit that is doing that to me. It's a spirit of tiredness. And they literally caught a spirit of tiredness. And this sister come up and this preacher rebuked the spirit of tiredness on her and said, "You demon of tiredness, you are bringing a spirit of weary on her mind and you're causing these problems." And the brother rebuked that spirit off of her and it left her and she sat there and was wide awake. &gt;&gt; And she thought, well, it's just a problem in my body. It's just an issue in my body. But really, it was a spiritual warfare in another level and it was coming to her and bringing all of these feeling. Now, I know there's times you get fatigued. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a spirit that tries to block the visitation. A spirit that tries to block you from your deliverance. A spirit that tries to block you from being healed. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that's doing that. And you cannot be ignorant of Satan and his devices. &gt;&gt; But you got to say, "Devil, I see you doing that. I refuse to fall for your trap." and rebuke that devil. Rebuke that spirit and say, "Devil, I I'm not allowing you to do that." Do you realize that a lot of times, I just want to preach from my heart, a lot of times, the reason the devil's having his way in your life is because you let him. &gt;&gt; You let him. &gt;&gt; And he's gotten comfortable you letting him do it. He's gotten comfortable sitting on your shoulder. He's gotten comfortable sitting in your car. He's gotten comfortable. I'm just going to preach. He's gotten comfortable sitting in your home. And you let him stay there. That old gloomy, depressive spirit and that old spirit of sadness. Or you just you just leave him alone and he'll just stay there and he's gotten comfortable living there. I think it's time we ought to make the devil uncomfortable. [Applause] [Music] Make that devil uncomfortable. Do you realize when the prophet was teaching about healing, he talked about it. He said, "You just battle with some kind of sickness in your body." He said, "You go forth." You realize God heals in many different ways. &gt;&gt; Sometimes there's a miracle. Sometimes it's progression. Sometimes it's one day. Sometimes it's multiple years. But regardless, God is faithful and God heals. Is that right? He's faithful and he heals. But the prophet gave a little key to this. He said, "See what it is when you go testify." And he said, "You leave this place." Because how many knows healing is the finished work? &gt;&gt; The Bible records it as past tense, right? By his stripes, we were &gt;&gt; already he already settled and done. So, you're already healed according to the word of God. And the prophet said, "What you do is you go forth praising God, &gt;&gt; worshiping God. God, you've healed me. Thank God for healing me. God, you've healed me. I thank you for it. And the prophet said, you go worshiping God and you go praising God like it's already done. And the devil says, "Well, well, you know, you're not really healed and you don't want to lie on God." You rebuke that devil and say, "No, devil. I'm already healed, but look at your I don't I'm not looking at my condition. I'm looking at the word and the word said I'm already healed and the word said it's already done. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't want to lie on God. And and that's the thing the devil says. Well, well, you're lying if you say that. You ain't lying. You're professing the word. And the Bible says that he is a high priest to your confession. He's a high priest to what you confess. Amen. The prophet said, "What you do as you worship God and you praise God," he said, "And after a while," Hallelujah. He said, "After a while, that spirit gets tired." This is right in the message. He said, "That spirit gets tired, brother Kalema, of hearing you worship and hearing you praise." And he says, "Well, I guess if they're going to believe they're healed, I'll go leave them alone." And the prophet said, "There it is." He said, "There is the manifestation of your confession." He said, "That devil got tired of listening to you praise." Hallelujah. To listen to you worship, to listen to you testify, and so that devil just left you alone. That's the way it's got to be with your situation. You got to start praising God and start worshiping God. I don't care if it ain't getting no better. I don't care if the situation ain't changing. You're commanded in the word. You're already healed. You're already delivered. I'm telling you this. Amen. If you can believe it and you can receive, it's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Amen. When Jesus was on the cross, what did he say? &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; Finished. &gt;&gt; I tell you, your situation's finished in the mind of God. Your problem is already finished. Your sickness is finished. Amen. Cancer was finished. Anxiety was finished. Nervousness was finished. Marriage trouble was finished. He finished it on the cross. [Applause] Oh, praise God in the highest. I said he finished it already. What do I got to do? You got to believe, sister. It's already done. It's already finished. The victories be won. Oh, let me tell you. You may lose the battle, but the war has already been won. Hallelujah. I said the war has been won. You may fall out. You may lose a battle, but Christ is victorious. And he won the battle over sickness. And he won the battle over sin. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what the prophet said? He said, "To you that's on tape, the day of sin is over." &gt;&gt; Do you realize the prophet declared the year of Jubilee is right now? He said, "And to those that can hear it, this is your Jubilee trumpet. You don't have to serve the devil anymore. You don't have to serve that problem no more. You don't have to serve sickness no more. You don't have to serve I don't know if you believe in me tonight. You don't got to serve that spirit. Amen. You are called by God, brother and sister. You take dominion. You take authority. Amen. Take that spirit and put it beneath you where it belong. Amen. Whatever the situation is. Amen. Where does it belong? Underneath your feet. Hallelujah. It belongs under your feet. You're the bride of Christ. Stomp the devil down. Fear, you got no hold on me. Anxiety, you got no hold on me. Worry, you got no hold on me. Take that devil that's been lying to you and put him where he belongs. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] That's where that devil belongs. He's lying to you. &gt;&gt; He's lying to you. He tries to convince people, I got a right to be here. I got a right. He ain't got no right. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you? He's got zero rights with your children. &gt;&gt; He's got zero rights with your family. &gt;&gt; He's got zero rights with your He don't got no right. &gt;&gt; Who said, "How can you say that?" Because Jesus went to his house. [Applause] Oh, hallelujah. I said Jesus went to his house and he had some keys on his side and he knocked on that door that great day. He thought, "I got him. He's coming to I tell you what, boys. I really got him." Amen. The prophet said he kicked the door down and he went up to the side of that old devil. He had the key to death. He had the key to hell. He had the key to the grave. He had the key to sickness. He had the key to fear. He had the key to every element, every spirit. And what did Jesus do? Oh, Mr. Can I please have them key? You You know what? I really That's not what he did. He didn't make no deal with the devil. He said, "Give me those keys." And the devil this evening, he don't got the key to his own house. So why in the world do you say he's going to ride in your mind or ride on your shoulder? He's got no ride on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said he's got no ride on you. He don't even got the keys to his own house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Christ has won the victory. He don't got no right with your body. He don't got no right with your spirit. And he sure don't got no right with your soul because your soul, my sister, has been sealed until the day of your redemption. And the devil may attack your body. And the devil may attack your mind. And the devil may attack your spirit. But there is a seal of God that is around your soul. And the devil could not get to you. [Applause] I said your soul has been sealed by the seal of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's a revelation because you'll be attacked in this body. You'll be attacked in your mind. But the devil's done come too late because I've done been sealed by by the Holy Ghost. Amen. The devil should have had you when he had a chance. He should have got you while you was out in the world. I want to tell the devil tonight, you come too late. You come too late. You should have got me while you had a chance. But what did Jesus prophesy? Jesus said that there will be none that can pluck them out of my hand. And I will not lose the one that the father has given me. I'm so thankful &gt;&gt; because the devil would have stopped us a long time ago. &gt;&gt; The devil would have hindered us a long time ago. I remember see &gt;&gt; predestinated before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Chosen in God. Elected for this time. Elected for this season. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for it? &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to turn a corner here. I know I've just done a lot of preaching this this evening, but &gt;&gt; the prophet, he talked about how he dealt within that in that realm of spirits. Let me read you this quote. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, my work is in the realm of spirits. That's where I live a big part of my life." He said, "See, it's in another dimension &gt;&gt; that the world knows nothing about." He said, "See, I speak in the name of the Lord and they don't understand it." He said, "There's no need of trying to explain it. There's no way to explain it. And the prophet's given us a revelation that he's seeing into the spirit realm and he's seeing spirits of world. How many knows the prophet said he said that each and every one of you are a spirit. &gt;&gt; And when you come in here, you come in as a spirit being, triune being, body, soul, and spirit. &gt;&gt; And sometimes your spirit ain't right. You can affect the service. That's right. &gt;&gt; In fact, the prophet said you can hinder somebody from being healed. &gt;&gt; Because of your unbelief &gt;&gt; and because of that spirit that you carry with you. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said, he said, "Don't be up running around and moving around during this time of discernment." He said, "You're a spirit and you're causing a distraction." And the prophet said, "It is so powerful. I just don't have time to read all of it. It's so powerful to me because underneath that discernment, you know, I think it's beautiful to realize this because whenever you see a spirit that's manifesting, I don't know how many's ever seen that before, &gt;&gt; but a spirit manifesting itself through through somebody &gt;&gt; and you think, "Oh, the devil's really gaining power." But that's not the case. &gt;&gt; It's the presence of God that was made so manifest that that spirit has acting out from it. Right. &gt;&gt; That spirit is acting out. It's same way with the maniac at Gera when he he ran to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come running to the man. That maniac came to Jesus. Why did you come to torment? Amen. What was it? It was a manifestation of God. And the devil is always working right there when the manifestation of God is working. How many knows the prophet said that? He said, "Whenever a true revival is happening, you'll find an insane asylums fill up and all of this wickedness happens because the move of God, it exposes the works of the enemy." &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "All of us, we're a spirit being and we carry a spirit." &gt;&gt; Now, you're very familiar with all of these discernments. I think they're very powerful to listen to. The prophet with this particular case, I would like to read this to you. He said, "Sister, I see you're strictly a stranger to me. You're away from here. You've come from another city. You've got a lot of trouble on your heart. You got heart trouble." He said, "To begin with, is that right? There's a whole lot of blackness. I see a black sheep that keep you following like that." He said, "Oh, I see it. It's a lie." He said, "Somebody told a lie on you, and that was a man that was professing divine healing." The sister said, "Yes, sir." He said you was a witch. &gt;&gt; Yes. Is that true? He said you got a holster in your church or something another like that. Isn't that right? He said your pastor's sick right now. He's got polio. Is that right? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I don't know about you, but I've never read or heard where a person says, "No, brother, you missed him." &gt;&gt; No, brother. That wasn't right. Now, I know the critics say that, but but I never found on tape. Surely to goodness, if it was wrong, it' have been right there on the platform. &gt;&gt; I just dropped that over here for somebody. He said, "Your pastor's sick right now. He's got polio. Is that right?" Yes, sir. And notice what says there, "Sister, don't pay no attention." &gt;&gt; What was her problem? She was paying attention, brother Robert, to what they were saying about her. Don't pay no attention to what them people tell you. The prophet says they're lying. &gt;&gt; He said the only thing wrong with your heart is a nervous condition. &gt;&gt; Now notice this. The prophet first in discernment. He said you got a heart trouble. Then it begin to dig behind to bury into her life a little bit and said, "Oh, it was a lie that was told on you." And see the issue. His sister believed the lie that was told about her and it invited a spirit of nervousness on her and that spirit was working her up and no doubt all she could think about was what them people said. &gt;&gt; He said the only thing wrong with you is a nervous condition. He said sister go home in peace and God bless you. He said you're all right. God bless you. And then he says, "You're not a witch. &gt;&gt; She needed to hear that. &gt;&gt; You're not a witch." Because that devil had so anointed the words of that false person. And that's all she could think about was the lie that they was telling of her. And the prophet said, "Listen, they're lying to you. You're not a witch. They're lying to you." And the prophet said, "Go home and go in peace. [Music] and she got deliverance. &gt;&gt; Then there's other people, brother Random would come into they would come into that line of discernment and then he's talking to them and then they would have a spirit cast on them or cast off of them rather and then brother say now brother you go and you go worship God &gt;&gt; and you go praise God for healing you. &gt;&gt; Now have you ever thought why did the prophet say that? because he knew that individual in the future would no doubt battle with a spirit of doubt or a spirit of fear. Amen. Have you ever have you ever tried to praise God and worship God while you're afraid? &gt;&gt; It's hard to be afraid while you're praising God. &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried when when when you got an oppressive spirit on you and you're so low, you just start singing and worshiping God? I I don't know you ever tried. I have. It is very hard to be discouraged while you start praising God and worshiping God. It is very hard to be full of anxiety and all of these problems while you're praising and worshiping God. Amen. See where the revelation is? is that spirit gets so uncomfortable. And that's why the prophet said, "Brother, you leave this place and go worship God and go sing and go praise God." What is it? You got to keep the atmosphere of victory over your life. Keep the atmosphere of deliverance over your life and keep on singing and keep on worshiping and keep on testifying. So next time y'all y'all know what I'm talking about. Next time that spirit starts moving in around you like that big old shadow as the devil moves, you just start praising God. You just start, Victory is mine. Hallelujah. You just start singing, God will make a way. God will make this child a blessing. You just start worshiping God and praising God. And that spirit that tries to hang around you You know the devil's got a target on your back. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of y'all wonder, you say, "Why can I not escape this spirit?" Because that spirit knows you got a weakness with it. &gt;&gt; Some people, I personally don't battle with fear or anxiety, but I know there's people that battle it tremendously. It's because with their human makeup, they war in that in that realm. I I don't understand that cuz I don't battle with it. But to that person, that's very real. to that person. It's extreme and you can't tell them just don't feel that way, brother. Well, sure they would try that if they could. Well, just don't be that way. They would try that if they could, but it's in the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; And spirits follow you and they try to they they they they try to follow after you because they know you battle with that. That's why the prophet said, he said, "See what you got to do? You got to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can. And you got to keep the weak parts of your life guarded. &gt;&gt; Can I give it to you in a very natural illustration? If somebody battles with drinking alcohol, they ought to not be where alcohol is. &gt;&gt; If somebody battles with worldly music, they ought to not be where a bunch of worldly music is. &gt;&gt; You can take that with any application. You don't want to put yourself into a position. Am I preaching to real people here tonight? You don't want to put yourself into a spot because then that devil will come out and you wonder how in the world did this happen. Do you realize if you give the devil an edge, he'll take a mile. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's right in the message. The prophet said, "But Legion," he said, "Maybe he just had one social drink. Maybe he just told one lie and then Legion had to lie to his wife about drinking. Then lie to cover that lie. Lie to cover that lie." He said, "But see what happened is it all started somewhere. &gt;&gt; He allowed a spirit to stay longer than it should have ever stayed. And he allowed himself to get close to something that he never should have got close to." So we realize, listen, we're the bride of Christ. I believe that. You believe that. But you are not immune from the devil. The moment you think you're more spiritual than these things is a moment you're going to get trapped. The moment you think you're above that is the moment the devil's going to get you. If you ever think you're above temptation or or you're above this, I've seen the greatest of great men fallen. &gt;&gt; I've seen the best of the best taken down. &gt;&gt; The person you would have thought my if there was ever an Enoch, that man was Enoch. And I watched him fall. If you ever think you're above sin or you're above this or you're above that, that's exactly what the devil wants you to think because then he'll creep in and creep in and then you'll compromise and you'll say, "Well, it's just a little drink or or well, it's just a little this or a little that." And that's exactly how the devil gets the victory is over a small thing. &gt;&gt; I'll read a couple quotes here and close on this note. But &gt;&gt; but the prophet uh Samuel here in the Old Testament when he came to Saul and and he told him give me a minute. I'll find the scriptures here on it. But he told him he said that uh you're you're you're commanded to go kill the Amalachites. &gt;&gt; You're commanded to go destroy them all. You're commanded to go Amen. the the young, the old. I'll just have to preach it to you. I don't have enough time to get to all of it. But the prophet Samuel told him, he said, uh, to to go out and you go kill a gag and you go you go kill all the rams and kill all the oxen and kill all of these. &gt;&gt; And in the natural mind, if you was being a reasonable person, you would say, well, you know, it's just a it's just a child of Malachi. It's just a baby Malachi. And notice what I want you to notice this spirit in closing because notice him in his mind he he had thus sayeth the Lord from the prophet &gt;&gt; kill them all &gt;&gt; in his mind he thought you know God would really appreciate a good lamb. &gt;&gt; God would really appreciate a good sacrifice. &gt;&gt; God would really be thankful if I did this and did that. But what did the prophet say? And in his mind, he was innocent. In his mind, it was not that big of a deal. &gt;&gt; But Saul went out and he took the be what did he say? I took the best of the sheep. I took the best of the ram and I got Aag right here. And Saul and Samuel came to him. He said, God said to destroy all of them. &gt;&gt; He said, "Isn't it a lot better to obey than the sacrifice?" And then Saul Saul be or Samuel rather Samuel began to tap into that spirit of discernment and he said that spirit of rebellion is likened unto witchcraft or brother you know I just don't agree with the prophet that's a spirit of witchcraft brother I just don't you know it it's the best it's for the Lord I'mma do it for the Lord and it sounds Good. &gt;&gt; But what's the spirit? &gt;&gt; Listen, you may sound fundamentally right, but what's the spirit motivating it? &gt;&gt; It may make sense. That's great. But what's the spirit motivating it? &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Samuel was opening up the prophet in discernment. He said, "That spirit that is on you, it is likened unto witchcraft." &gt;&gt; Amen. Could you bring that home to you and I? Amen. when we want to go against what God has said, we want to go against the word of God. And you think, well, you know, it's harmless and it's not that big of a deal, and it's just a small amalachi. Listen, brother, sister, if you don't deal with it while it's small. I'm telling you, if you don't kill the little Amalachi, that thing will turn into a big amalachi and he'll cut your throat. It's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us to get rid of the little things. &gt;&gt; What's the Bible say? It's the little foxes &gt;&gt; that spoil the vines. &gt;&gt; It's the little thing that does it. And we and we think, well, the devil's going to come out like some great big That's not what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; He'll come in so little. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, the Lord would appreciate that. But would he? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, the Lord would be thankful for that. But would he &gt;&gt; discern the spirit? &gt;&gt; What? Let me just say this. Any ministry, any any anointing, anything has got to be judged by the word. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how anointed it is, it don't matter how how Listen, the devil wants you to reason with the word. &gt;&gt; And the issue of it is is that people get to where they understand. And if you can so break something down to where it makes sense, people go with it. &gt;&gt; The devil makes a lot of sense, but he's a liar. &gt;&gt; The devil makes a whole lot of sense, but there ain't no truth in him. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he did to Eve. He made it made sense. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God wants you to be like God. Well, yeah, that that sounds good. And that's what the devil would do with you. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God, he wants you to he wants you to be this way and enjoy it this way. And you know, God, he really wants you to be blessed. And and if you're not careful, the devil will have you pushed out into material gains &gt;&gt; and not spiritual gains. And the devil will get your focus on all of these other things instead of where they should be. And he'll make it make sense. And he'll make it sound right. And he'll make it intellectually be exactly right. But yet it be false. Because what is the spirit that is under it? Is the spirit vanity? Is the spirit self- gain? Is the spirit popularity? Is the spirit self-reputation, self-exaltation? What is the spirit behind it? Even in preachers, you know, I want to preach so good. I want to do such a good job. We appreciate that. But what is the spirit that is under it? Do you want to do it to be heard and to be saved? You got to discern the spirit. And you ought to sit down and re-evaluate for a minute. But the true spirit has to exalt Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's what this message come to do. It came to lift up Christ. &gt;&gt; It come to exalt Christ. And let me tell you this, you don't have to push Brother Brandham down to lift up Christ. &gt;&gt; As high as you put the prophet, you just put Christ high. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. as high. I put him exactly where brother put him. But I put Jesus higher. &gt;&gt; I put him higher than any man. I put him higher than any prophet. He was the prophet of the prophets. He was the God prophet. And he is the only one that we worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Discernment of spirit. You realize that's why the devil hates this message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I I know I'm trying to close. You forgive me. That's why the devil hates at this the message as bad as he does because it exposes him. &gt;&gt; The prophet says very clearly, he said, "I wish you could be in these meetings and see the people." &gt;&gt; He said, "See the countenance on the people's faces." He said, "The devil," notice what the prophet does because this is so crucial. He makes a difference between the people and the spirit. [Applause] He's never attacking a He says, "Notice the faces of the of the people and how they're the devil and how they're so bad." He don't do that. He says, "Notice the countenance of the people." He said, "The devil realizes he's about to be exposed." And there's such a peculiar change that comes across the people's faces. And the devil's scrambling and running and scrambling because he can't hide in the presence of God. And that's why the devil attacks this message with everything he's got because it exposes him in the world. It exposes him in the church. It exposes him in the leoty. It exposes every trick of the devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "What the devil does is try to get you to disprove or disbelieve God's word." He said, "And if he can break your confidence in the word, then the devil can hide. &gt;&gt; He can hide because then you don't believe it's your spirit." Amen. I just love the way the prophet said it because he said, "See that devil, he can hide from the doctor, but he cannot hide from Jesus Christ." That spirit, it can hide from the doctor. It can hide from the lenses. It can hide from these things, but it cannot hide from Christ. I want to tell the devil, Amen, you may hide from the doctor and you may hide from the church and you may hide from the pastor, but God sees you and he sees exactly what you're doing and your day is coming to an end. &gt;&gt; And I just love it because the prophet said, "Here's the cause." Right. &gt;&gt; And it's just so powerful because the prophet would never leave us with the cause without introducing us to the cure. &gt;&gt; He said, "Here's the cause of your problem." &gt;&gt; And here's the cure. &gt;&gt; Here's the cause of anxiety. Here's the cure. Here's the cause of sickness. Here's the cure. Here's the cause of unbelief. Here's the cure. &gt;&gt; And spirits will follow generations. You realize that &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament, sins will be visited upon generations. &gt;&gt; But see, there's got to be somebody rise up that stops it &gt;&gt; and please. Let me tell you this. The blood of Jesus Christ is stronger &gt;&gt; than your generational spirits that's following your family. It is stronger than the spirits that try. Amen. Do you realize you ever thought about why do you battle with what your father battled and your greatgrandfather and his father's father? It's because that spirit has seen a gene of weakness and he's going from generation to generation to generation. And because your father didn't deal with that spirit, you're having to deal with it. And because your mother didn't deal with that spirit, you're having to deal with it. But I say, let's do just that. Let's deal with that old devil and let's put him underneath the blood. Hallelujah. And let's get rid of it and say, "Devil, you may have done it through my great grandparents and you may have done it through my parents, but I have discernment of spirit and it took her down and it took him down and it took him down, but it stops right here today. It stops right here. Y'all know exactly what I'm talking about. That spirit of temper or that spirit of anger or whatever it may be, you can tell that devil, devil, you may have done what you wanted to with him, but you stop right here. I plead the blood of Jesus Christ over you and rebuke that devil and bind that devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stand to your feet this evening. [Music] bind that devil. &gt;&gt; You speak the word. You bind that devil. I'm telling you, church, you you you're you're you're commanded to do it. &gt;&gt; You say, "What stops a cycle?" When the individual raises up and says, "Enough is enough." &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't lost you. I'm sure you're with me on it. &gt;&gt; It's the devil cycling. Let Let me tell you this. I want to just drive this home. &gt;&gt; A cycle don't stop unconsciously. &gt;&gt; We're facing a new year. Your your life is not going to get better unconsciously. &gt;&gt; Your prayer life will not get better unconsciously. &gt;&gt; Your marriage, it won't get better unconsciously. &gt;&gt; Your situations, whatever you're dealing with, it won't get better uncon. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?

I want my prayer life to change. Then change it. In the name of the Lord, change it. I want this situation to change. Then change it. You cry about it and you dream about it and you think about it. What would it be like if I got delivered? Listen, this is a place where you don't got to dream about it. You can experience it. You don't got to dream about getting healed. You can be healed. You don't got to dream about your situation changing. But right here in this place this afternoon, the situation can change. The sickness can be healed. The need can be met. This ain't some wishbone. This is faith. This ain't some hope. This is a no. [Music] And we're facing a new year coming up soon. &gt;&gt; You want to have a better prayer life, then have a better prayer life. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Uncut. You got to decide. &gt;&gt; It ends right here. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living this way. I'm tired of putting up with these things. Discern that. That problem that you got real, that's a spirit that's doing that. It stops tonight. That's a spirit of worry. It stops tonight. It's a spirit of fear. It stops tonight. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; Whatever the situation is, it stops tonight. I mean, declare it. Believe it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This then is the message that we have heard that God is light &gt;&gt; and in him dwells no darkness at all. That's this message. This then is the message. God is light. I mean, that devil couldn't hide if he wanted to. He's been thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly exposed. Oh, he's like a deer in the headlights tonight. I mean, that devil's in plain view. And you know it's the devil that's doing it. &gt;&gt; You know it's the devil that's plaguing your mind and plaguing your spirit. You know it's the spirit that's doing it. You've been given authority, church, to bind it. &gt;&gt; What the word say? Whatever you bind on earth. I'll bind in the heavens. So I bind it in Jesus name tonight. Hallelujah. Are you with me? I bind it in Jesus name tonight. Whatever the whatever the spirit is, bind it tonight. Devil, it's enough. I I bind fear in Jesus Christ's name. I bind unbelief in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word, Lord. We thank you for this message. We thank you for Elijah the prophet you sent unto us, Lord. Lord, all the tricks of the enemy is exposed. Every spirit of hell is exposed. The devil's fighting him. The devil's against it. But Lord, these are real devils that we're fighting up against, Lord. those spirits of worry and fear and unbelief. But Lord, tonight in your presence, we bind the devil in Jesus Christ's name. We bind worry. We bind fear. We bind anxiety. We bind lust. We bind every devil out of hell that is trying to bring your children down. Oh Lord, we believe it tonight. We receive it tonight, Father. Oh Lord, we walk from this place, Lord, realizing that all the works of the enemy has been exposed and we're leaving tonight a free people. We're not waiting to be free, Lord, but you have set us free already by the preaching of the word. You sent your word and brought healing. You sent your word and brought deliverance, Lord. You sent your word and brought victory tonight, Lord. And we thank you for it, Lord, in Jesus' name. and we bless your holy name. Hallelujah. God bless you tonight, brother Steven Co. God bless you.

Leave it in the hand of the master &gt;&gt; and go home free &gt;&gt; and do what you has been instructed to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever is in the life, kill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Israel ever doubted one word of Elijah, he was costing their life. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Believe his prophet and you will prosper." Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't reason with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know the truth about what the word says. &gt;&gt; We have the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Whatever the message point out to you and say take it out. &gt;&gt; Do not reason. &gt;&gt; Even if you struggle with it, obey &gt;&gt; because a rebellious spirit is a spirit of witchcraft. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul told the the Galatian, he said, "Who has bewitched you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a spirit that was bringing rebellious to the revealed word that was coming up trying to bring the people back again into bondage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is unfolding his word so clear. &gt;&gt; We went in one extreme with the legalistic. &gt;&gt; We went another extreme with the Calvinistic over there. and we find oursself into a mess. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We preach so much about how powerful the devil is &gt;&gt; and we forget to preach how powerful God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We focus so much on divine healing and we forget the other things in our life.
