[56:16] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[56:18] believer says amen and amen Romans the
[56:22] 8th chapter and I just want to read one
[56:24] verse and the 11th verse
[56:26] the Bible here speaking says but if the
[56:29] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[56:33] the dead dwell in you yes sir I want you
[56:37] to catch this it's not visiting you but
[56:40] it's dwelling in you that's right then
[56:43] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[56:45] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[56:49] his spirit that dwelleth in you not by
[56:53] his spirit that visits you but by his
[56:56] his spirit that dwelleth in you we ask
[56:59] Lord this evening to add the blessings
[57:00] the reading of his word as you can have
[57:02] your seats here this evening I want to
[57:04] uh just for a few moments by the help of
[57:06] the Lord tonight and if I if I would
[57:08] take a title tonight I want to speak to
[57:10] you for just a few moments here on we
[57:12] must not lose our enthusiasm we must not
[57:15] lose our enthusiasm now amen I want I
[57:19] want to begin by saying that I believe
[57:22] the enthusiasm of an age amen is the
[57:24] message of that age in other words I
[57:27] don't believe it's something apart from
[57:28] the message but I believe it's something
[57:31] that is the message now in 1965 brother
[57:33] BR preaches two very powerful sermons
[57:36] amen and both of them are revolving
[57:38] around the subject of God's quickening
[57:40] power the first one he preaches is the
[57:42] Easter seal and then he preaches it is
[57:45] the rising of the Sun in the message it
[57:47] is the Easter seal 1965 paragraph 47 he
[57:51] said now as Christians we all claim that
[57:53] he is alive or we have been quickened
[57:55] from the to death amen to Life by his
[57:58] spirit and if we haven't been quickened
[58:00] then we've not been made alive see now
[58:03] we're going to break into this subject
[58:04] the Lord willing and kind of teach it
[58:06] for a few minutes how that are we
[58:08] quickened and how can we be sure that
[58:11] this is the truth he said now this is
[58:13] your own life and this is my life and if
[58:16] this isn't the truth then what am I then
[58:18] what I'm fixing to say then I'm one of
[58:20] the most foolish people in the world he
[58:23] said I've give my life for something
[58:25] that there's nothing to and so have you
[58:27] but if it is the truth he said then I
[58:30] owe everything that I am he said I owe
[58:33] everything I could be to the cause of
[58:35] which we're standing for he said and I
[58:37] think that we mustn't lose our
[58:39] enthusiasm amen so here's a prophet who
[58:42] saying amen what I'm preaching is not
[58:44] something I'm guessing about not
[58:46] something I'm hoping about but it's
[58:48] something that I am sure amen that it is
[58:50] the truth and that if it is the truth
[58:53] amen then we must not lose our
[58:55] enthusiasm now I know when you mention
[58:57] the word enthusiasm people automatically
[58:59] start thinking different things amen but
[59:01] I want to say thank God for a prophet
[59:04] amen who preached a message that was a
[59:06] message of enthusiasm amen but he
[59:09] preached it from a balance on both sides
[59:11] 1950 he said I'd rather have amen a
[59:14] little
[59:15] enthusiasm amen than no ASM at all I'd
[59:19] rather have a little enthusiasm amen
[59:22] there no ASM at all amen just to have
[59:25] somebody amen get enthused about it you
[59:27] know amen now when I begin to think
[59:29] about this I think of how amen that a
[59:32] prophet made a very powerful declaration
[59:34] and announcement he said the church
[59:36] today amen has lost its enthusiasm he
[59:40] said why because it's got out of the
[59:42] vine it's no more being energized by the
[59:45] spirit he said the wells of water
[59:47] bubbling up into everlasting life he
[59:50] said they've lost that Zeal something's
[59:52] missing amen now God Remains the Same
[59:55] amen and Christ Remains the Same but his
[59:57] church amen has disassociated itself
[1:00:01] amen with his connection which is the
[1:00:03] vine is the spirit now you all know the
[1:00:06] Bible said that Jesus said amen that I
[1:00:09] am the vine and ye are the branches
[1:00:11] right amen I am the vine and you are the
[1:00:14] branches then the spirit amen is the is
[1:00:17] the vine amen or it is the source amen
[1:00:20] of zeal or energy amen or enthusiasm
[1:00:23] that's coming into the church now the
[1:00:25] prophet of God in 1964 spiritual Amnesia
[1:00:28] he said now have you noticed today's
[1:00:30] crop he said if you notied today what we
[1:00:32] do he said we actually we got enough God
[1:00:35] about us till we come up to the platform
[1:00:37] and we say yes maybe I better come up
[1:00:39] and now this is the experience of
[1:00:41] worldwide he said yes I better go up and
[1:00:44] stand and say well well I don't know
[1:00:46] here I am see amen what a place to be in
[1:00:50] he said there's no fire burning there's
[1:00:52] no enthusiasm he said there's not a go
[1:00:55] into it
[1:00:56] amen so there is a connection between
[1:00:58] enthusiasm amen and a desire to go
[1:01:01] forward into something let me this we
[1:01:03] are not going back amen into the shck OR
[1:01:07] to the stalk or to the tassel amen but
[1:01:09] we're going forward am we're moving into
[1:01:12] every Divine promise that God has
[1:01:14] ordained us to move into he said see and
[1:01:17] as and as an evangelist he said that
[1:01:20] just kills me to see God's people Amen
[1:01:22] in that shape amen we are supposed to be
[1:01:25] on fire
[1:01:26] now people they actually misunderstand
[1:01:29] enthusiasm the prophet of God said see
[1:01:31] people misunderstand enthusiasm they
[1:01:34] misunderstand the power of the Holy
[1:01:36] Spirit they call it a bunch of Holy
[1:01:38] Rollers they call it a bunch of people
[1:01:40] that ain't got their right mind he said
[1:01:43] they
[1:01:43] misunderstand that you had to lose what
[1:01:46] you call your right mind because you
[1:01:48] have the mind of Christ in you you can't
[1:01:52] have the mind of the world and the mind
[1:01:55] of Christ at the same time see one's
[1:01:57] carnal and the other's spiritual he that
[1:02:00] walks after the flesh is carnal but he
[1:02:03] that walks after the spirit amen is
[1:02:05] spiritual amen so I'll lose myself Amen
[1:02:09] to find the mind of God he said see so
[1:02:12] God is misunderstood that's right it's
[1:02:14] not you that's misunderstood it's the
[1:02:17] Holy Spirit making you do that that's
[1:02:21] exactly come on church it's the Holy
[1:02:23] Ghost making you do thaten that's
[1:02:25] understood he said amen they're not
[1:02:28] speaking against you amen they're
[1:02:30] speaking against him can I say this amen
[1:02:33] I I'm sorry that if it offends you amen
[1:02:36] that somebody shouts or somebody dances
[1:02:39] somebody enjoys the anointing amen amen
[1:02:42] but but really you're not offended at
[1:02:44] them amen you're offended at the holy
[1:02:46] spirit amen that's doing it through them
[1:02:50] I'm going to go prach for here amen I
[1:02:52] know sometimes people get offended amen
[1:02:54] I've had them get offended it me for
[1:02:56] preaching certain things about about the
[1:02:58] pictures in the church about the cloud
[1:03:00] or about the seven seal Amen in all
[1:03:03] reality I don't have no issue with them
[1:03:06] because they're not offended at me amen
[1:03:08] they're offended at the one who is
[1:03:10] dwelling on the inside of me because the
[1:03:13] only thing the spirit will preach amen
[1:03:16] is the message of the hour yes my
[1:03:19] brother now it's either the truth or
[1:03:20] it's not and I believe the spirit amen
[1:03:23] is taken possession of vessel
[1:03:26] who will preach the message and
[1:03:28] believers who will believe the message
[1:03:30] yes sir they're not misunderstanding you
[1:03:33] amen they're misunderstanding the Holy
[1:03:35] Ghost that's making you do it now I
[1:03:38] just Foundation here for a second amen
[1:03:41] when you look at this word enthusiasm
[1:03:44] amen it's it's got a very powerful
[1:03:46] definition it means a strong excitement
[1:03:49] a feeling it is something inspiring it
[1:03:52] is Zeal it is fervor nowen this is what
[1:03:55] God me on this brother amen is that I'm
[1:03:57] looking at a definition amen of the word
[1:04:00] enthusiasm and this is actually
[1:04:02] connected to the definition it is a
[1:04:05] belief in a special revelation of the
[1:04:08] Holy Spirit that's exactly the word
[1:04:12] enthusiasm is connected to a belief of a
[1:04:15] special Revelation amen of the holy
[1:04:19] spirit amen now in John chapter 1 the
[1:04:21] Bible says amen that Jesus chose his
[1:04:24] disciples he chose Phillip by name he
[1:04:27] said and when Phillip after he got
[1:04:29] converted amen he was all enthus see and
[1:04:32] any man when he finds Jesus and he gets
[1:04:35] saved there is an enthusiasm see you got
[1:04:38] to be born again and when you're born
[1:04:40] there's an enthusiasm Rises with that
[1:04:43] birth amen and sets the solar fire and
[1:04:46] takes all the differences away and the
[1:04:48] isms and come straight to Calvary and
[1:04:51] recognizes Christ with a burning love
[1:04:54] and a zeal amen for the lost and Fallen
[1:04:57] World brother said enthusiasm amen that
[1:05:00] will burn your heart that will make you
[1:05:03] so happy and so full of joy amen till
[1:05:06] you'll stagger like you were full amen
[1:05:08] of strong drink listen I don't believe
[1:05:11] this message come to kill the church I
[1:05:13] believe it come to resurrect the church
[1:05:16] I don't believe this message come Amen
[1:05:18] to put our fire out I believe the
[1:05:20] message come to cause our fire to burn
[1:05:23] hotter and to burn bigger yes we are not
[1:05:26] following a man's idea we are following
[1:05:29] the Vindicated Revelation that has been
[1:05:32] brought into this age by the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit I'm talking about enthusiasm and
[1:05:39] enthusiasm goes beyond just a feeling it
[1:05:42] goes beyond just a sensation it goes
[1:05:45] beyond just an emotion even the even the
[1:05:48] dictionary testifies that enthusiasm is
[1:05:52] connected Amen to a special revelation
[1:05:56] of the Holy Spirit now now I'm the guy
[1:05:59] I'm sorry but I'm the guy that reads
[1:06:01] that part of the definition that it is a
[1:06:03] belief and special revelation of the
[1:06:06] Holy Spirit and I say now I got to go
[1:06:08] find amen the history of this word
[1:06:11] enthusiasm do you realize it it now now
[1:06:14] now listen to this it may come as a
[1:06:16] surprise to many people when they first
[1:06:19] Look up the word enthusiasm to see that
[1:06:22] its original meaning has to do with the
[1:06:25] passion for religion rather than
[1:06:28] passionate or eager interest in general
[1:06:31] it is a brief explanation of the words
[1:06:34] amen aty should clear this up now watch
[1:06:37] this enthusiasm it entered the English
[1:06:40] language around the beginning of the
[1:06:43] 17th century it was borrowed from the
[1:06:46] Greek enthus meaning inspiration or
[1:06:50] possession by God that's it oh God for
[1:06:54] the first 200 years or so it was used in
[1:06:58] English enthusiasm amen was primarily
[1:07:01] employed to refer Amen to beliefs or
[1:07:04] passions that related to religion by the
[1:07:07] beginning of the 18th century however
[1:07:10] the word begin to describe amen having
[1:07:13] strong feelings amen or interest in
[1:07:16] secular matters now watch this in just
[1:07:18] one century amen the word or the meaning
[1:07:22] of enthusiasm changed now let me just
[1:07:24] say this what is happening in the
[1:07:26] natural is also happening in the
[1:07:30] spiritual if they were losing the
[1:07:32] meaning of enthusiasm in the natural
[1:07:35] amen so where they were in the spiritual
[1:07:37] and the prophet of God said now the
[1:07:39] sincerity he said we don't have it it
[1:07:41] seems to be such a small interest it
[1:07:43] should be in the time of this Jubilee
[1:07:45] right now amen and are positive these
[1:07:48] things it should be this streetport
[1:07:50] would be buzzing like a bus all he said
[1:07:52] but we've lost the sincerity and the
[1:07:55] enthusiasm it is to receive it he said
[1:07:58] now that's the truth he said and we'll
[1:08:00] never come back until we can appreciate
[1:08:03] or get to the spot of appreciation of
[1:08:06] God making a way for us and then calling
[1:08:09] us in it Church of the Living God God
[1:08:12] made a way for us and then he called us
[1:08:14] into the way that he made and he
[1:08:16] Vindicated it to us by his spirit and by
[1:08:19] his word amen there's where our
[1:08:22] Assurance comes from listen what the
[1:08:24] prophet said what a tragedy it is to see
[1:08:27] amen the church is in that condition do
[1:08:29] you realize the prophet of God said just
[1:08:31] as Israel amen become ritualistic he
[1:08:34] said Israel was using the word and the
[1:08:37] Commandment of God he said and the
[1:08:39] church today amen they're taking things
[1:08:42] out of the Bible amen but there's no
[1:08:45] sincerity with it that's exactly right
[1:08:48] now we can prove that can I say this the
[1:08:50] message of the hour restored sincerity
[1:08:54] to the church exactly right come on the
[1:08:57] message of the hour brought the element
[1:08:59] of sincerity yes sir yes sir back into
[1:09:02] the church now you all know I'm in the
[1:09:04] message amen because we didn't even know
[1:09:06] how to come in the building that's right
[1:09:08] come on we didn't know how to come in
[1:09:09] the building until God sent a prophet
[1:09:13] who would begin to teach Church order
[1:09:15] and by teaching Church order he would
[1:09:17] show that you can't come in talk and and
[1:09:20] chewing gum and hollering back and forth
[1:09:22] but you got to create an atmosphere
[1:09:25] this amen amen can I go a step further
[1:09:28] amen they were having communion without
[1:09:30] sincerity that's ex it had become it had
[1:09:32] become great juice it had become graham
[1:09:35] crackers or or what amen but a Prophet
[1:09:37] come and said that's not that's not
[1:09:40] something to be taken lightly amen that
[1:09:43] is a that is a that is a commandment of
[1:09:45] God it is an ordinance to remember the
[1:09:47] crucifixion of our Lord and savior let
[1:09:50] me say thank God the message came and
[1:09:53] fulfilled the words of Paul when Purge
[1:09:55] out this old Heaven that you may be a
[1:09:58] new lump yes my brother that you may be
[1:10:01] a new lump as ye are unle for even
[1:10:04] Christ Our Passover amen is sacrificed
[1:10:07] for us now now when you look at this
[1:10:10] word leaven it is a mental and moral
[1:10:13] corruption it is viewed in its tendency
[1:10:15] to infect others amen Le is applied to
[1:10:19] that which though small in quantity yet
[1:10:22] by its influence amen thoroughly
[1:10:24] pervades a thing it is either in a good
[1:10:27] sense as in the parable of Matthew 13 or
[1:10:30] in a bad sense amen of a of a pernicious
[1:10:33] influence see a little leav leth a whole
[1:10:36] l so we've come to a time where we
[1:10:39] cannot just say well we can let this in
[1:10:42] and let that in and let that in amen the
[1:10:44] more you let
[1:10:45] in come on Church the more you let in
[1:10:49] that's right is the more message you're
[1:10:51] letting out that's
[1:10:53] right on now come on we let our
[1:10:56] televisions back in and now we can't
[1:10:58] even quote what a prophet said about it
[1:11:00] that's exactly right come on come on
[1:11:02] amen amen we let high heel shoes back in
[1:11:05] and now we can't even preach pain in
[1:11:06] face Jezebel no more because with high
[1:11:09] heel shoes can makeup come on I'm
[1:11:12] talking to you now and then when we
[1:11:14] start letting things in we start letting
[1:11:17] the message go out that's right because
[1:11:19] the message will not dwell where Liv has
[1:11:22] an influence that's let me say this if
[1:11:25] if we start letting Pentecostalism come
[1:11:27] back
[1:11:28] in if we start letting Pentecostalism
[1:11:31] come back in we're going to start
[1:11:33] letting the message out and it's already
[1:11:35] got oh God what can I preach it's
[1:11:38] already got to a spot we can't even quot
[1:11:40] the bride AIDS no more and we can't
[1:11:42] preach adoption and we can't preach the
[1:11:44] seven Thunders amen but you know what I
[1:11:46] say I say Purge the church I say Purge
[1:11:49] the church Purge of 11 Purge of
[1:11:52] tradition Purge of men's ideas and bring
[1:11:55] back the message of the hour bring back
[1:11:58] the
[1:12:00] Revelation yes
[1:12:01] sir amen the Bible said therefore let us
[1:12:04] keep the feast not with o 11 not with
[1:12:07] oleen and neither with a leav of malice
[1:12:10] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[1:12:12] bread of sincerity and Truth can I say
[1:12:16] this there are many things in life that
[1:12:18] we can gain and there are many things in
[1:12:20] life we can lose can I say this some
[1:12:23] things we lose affect us
[1:12:25] and some things we lose we never realize
[1:12:28] they're gone until we've lost them
[1:12:30] that's
[1:12:31] right right can I say something to you
[1:12:34] amen I truly believe there are some
[1:12:36] things that the church can afford to
[1:12:39] lose I believe that brother stepen I
[1:12:42] believe that we can afford to lose the
[1:12:44] cold the complacent and the
[1:12:47] critical I believe it I believe that we
[1:12:50] can afford to lose the formal the
[1:12:53] Busters and the fighters you know what I
[1:12:55] believe I believe we can afford to lose
[1:12:57] the doubtful the dull and the dead but
[1:13:01] we cannot afford Amen to lose our
[1:13:04] sincerity and
[1:13:07] enthusiasm we cannot afford Amen to lose
[1:13:10] our sincerity and our enthusiasm now I'm
[1:13:14] taking my text amen from Romans 8:11 and
[1:13:17] the Bible said if the spirit of him that
[1:13:19] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:13:23] you than he that raised up Christ R from
[1:13:25] the dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:13:28] Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:13:31] look at this word dwelleth it means to
[1:13:33] dwell in one and influence him for the
[1:13:36] good so when you allow leevan to come in
[1:13:40] leevan has the ability to influence you
[1:13:43] for the bad or to influence you for the
[1:13:45] good but when you receive the spirit of
[1:13:48] him that raised Jesus from the dead he
[1:13:51] will only influence you for the good
[1:13:55] now look what the prophet of God says
[1:13:57] see then what is quickening power amen
[1:13:59] it is God paraphrasing it is God
[1:14:02] dwelling in the soul of The Believer by
[1:14:05] the power of the Holy Spirit can I say
[1:14:08] this we are under amen the influence of
[1:14:11] quickening power now let me say God by
[1:14:14] the holy spirit amen dwelling in The
[1:14:17] Believer is a scriptural promise in 2
[1:14:21] Corinthians 6:16 he said what agreement
[1:14:24] have the temp of God with Idols for ye
[1:14:26] are the Temple of the Living God as God
[1:14:30] has said as God has said I will dwell in
[1:14:34] them and walk in them oh Church of the
[1:14:38] Living God Amen if you'd walk in light
[1:14:41] as he is in the line you have Fellowship
[1:14:43] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:14:46] Christ put the blood on it the blood of
[1:14:48] Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all
[1:14:51] sin come on Church the spirit is not
[1:14:55] just dwelling in us but the spirit is
[1:14:58] walking us
[1:15:01] forward if the spirit dwell in them and
[1:15:04] I will walk in them and I will be their
[1:15:07] God and they shall be my people in
[1:15:10] Colossians 3:16 Paul says let somebody
[1:15:13] say Let Let the word of God or the word
[1:15:16] of Christ dwell in you richly in 2
[1:15:19] Timothy 1:14 that good thing which was
[1:15:22] committed unto thee amen keep by the
[1:15:25] Holy Ghost which dwelleth in US brother
[1:15:28] says and ashamed he says Lord we are
[1:15:30] certainly a blessed
[1:15:33] people above our thinking above our
[1:15:36] understanding for if there was a noble
[1:15:38] one among us such as some Personnel from
[1:15:41] some other country or a diplomat of some
[1:15:44] sort we would think it was so great to
[1:15:46] have such a noble person among us but
[1:15:49] today but today we have the god of
[1:15:53] Heaven he's not only among us but he's
[1:15:57] in us and he's dwelling come on he's not
[1:16:00] just among us but he's in us he said
[1:16:04] he's dwelling amen and living his life
[1:16:07] through us see it's beyond our
[1:16:11] understanding now when you start looking
[1:16:12] here at this word enthusiasm amen I find
[1:16:15] it very amazing amen that one way of
[1:16:18] interpreting or using the word
[1:16:20] enthusiasm amen is this the spirit of
[1:16:23] God within now job 328 the Bible says
[1:16:27] that there is a spirit in man and it is
[1:16:29] the inspiration of the almighty that
[1:16:33] giveth him understanding look at this
[1:16:35] word Spirit it is an impelling Prophet
[1:16:38] to utter instruction or warning so when
[1:16:41] you receive the spirit that raised him
[1:16:44] from the dead is the same spirit that
[1:16:47] possessed the prophets Was the Same
[1:16:50] Spirit that was in
[1:16:52] Jesus come on Church now watch the
[1:16:56] spirit of God is within man and he will
[1:16:59] utter instruction amen or warning to man
[1:17:04] come on now the prophet of God picks it
[1:17:06] up in John 16:13 he says how be it when
[1:17:09] he the spirit of Truth is come he will
[1:17:12] guide you into all truth he will not
[1:17:15] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[1:17:17] hear amen that shall he speak and he
[1:17:21] will show you things to come so when he
[1:17:24] the the spirit of Truth has come when
[1:17:27] the same spirit that raised our Lord
[1:17:29] from the dead dwells in you he will be
[1:17:32] an impelling Prophet who will utter
[1:17:34] warning and instruction to those who
[1:17:37] have ears to
[1:17:39] hear now the prophet picks this up in
[1:17:42] the Revelation series he said I want you
[1:17:44] to notice the symbols of Christ in the
[1:17:46] Bible here on Earth on the earth he was
[1:17:48] a prophet do you believe that now watch
[1:17:50] what a prophet says and a prophet is the
[1:17:53] word
[1:17:55] well glory to God a prophet is the word
[1:17:59] we know that the word Prophet means a
[1:18:03] Divine interpreter of the word see the
[1:18:06] Divine word is wrote and the prophet has
[1:18:09] the Divine spirit of God within him come
[1:18:13] on church then the same spirit that was
[1:18:16] dwelling in a prophet is now dwelling in
[1:18:19] a
[1:18:19] bride come on it's changed from the
[1:18:23] prophet to the prophecy
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:27] The Same Spirit that was in Jesus was in
[1:18:30] the prophet is in the bride listen
[1:18:33] friends the pro of God said you know the
[1:18:35] prophet of the Old Testament was called
[1:18:36] God how many knew that see he was called
[1:18:39] God because he packed within him the
[1:18:43] word of God goodness gracious he packed
[1:18:47] within him the word of God thus saith
[1:18:51] the Lord see therefore the word Prophet
[1:18:54] means his interpretation isn't to be
[1:18:57] mingled
[1:18:58] with oh now we're getting somewhere when
[1:19:02] a prophet packs the word his
[1:19:05] interpretation isn't to be mingled with
[1:19:08] see he says if there be one among you
[1:19:10] who is spiritual or a prophet then I the
[1:19:13] Lord will speak to him what he says will
[1:19:16] come to pass then hear him because I am
[1:19:20] with him but if it doesn't come to pass
[1:19:22] then don't hear him I haven't sent him
[1:19:24] him see then you see the Divine
[1:19:27] interpretation of the word are y'all
[1:19:29] ready for this has to coincide with this
[1:19:33] last Revelation to the
[1:19:35] church so the Revelation coming to the
[1:19:39] church will have to coincide with what a
[1:19:42] prophet said but you see what happens
[1:19:44] when you start mingling interpretation
[1:19:47] of what a prophet said Le starts coming
[1:19:51] in come on church I know what I'm
[1:19:54] talking about amen and Le is crep in
[1:19:56] churches and it's creeping into homes
[1:19:59] it's creeping into pull pits well we
[1:20:01] might as well preach we're here and now
[1:20:03] we're getting so scared amen we don't
[1:20:05] quote brother Ram's name we don't hang
[1:20:07] the pictures up I tell you what that is
[1:20:09] that's a devil from the pits of
[1:20:13] hell I am not ashamed of the prophetic
[1:20:17] interpretation that has come in this
[1:20:19] generation with Divine Vindication come
[1:20:22] on I'm not packing Billy Graham idea I'm
[1:20:25] not packing or Robert's view I'm not
[1:20:28] packing TD J's anointing I am packing
[1:20:31] the word of thus sayith the
[1:20:36] Lord come on I have this sayith the
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:43] Lord hallelujah hallelujah God said I
[1:20:46] will dwell in
[1:20:48] them I will dwell in them and walk in
[1:20:53] them come on church now how will he
[1:20:56] dwell in you and walk in you look here
[1:20:59] in third John 1:3 for I Rejoice greatly

[1:21:05] testified are you ready for this of the
[1:21:08] truth that is in
[1:21:10] thee even as thou wst in the truth look
[1:21:14] at verse four I have no Greater Joy than
[1:21:18] to hear that my children are walking in
[1:21:23] truth brother come along and a man
[1:21:25] running from the presence 1965 and he
[1:21:27] says somehow or another I just feel

[1:21:32] right ahead for us now just remember I
[1:21:35] believe I am prophesying great Joys lay

[1:21:55] will be made clear and people who are
[1:21:57] sad will be turned into
[1:22:00] Joy come on church I have just
[1:22:03] identified to you the source of the joy
[1:22:07] unspeakable and full of Glory it's not
[1:22:10] when we sing a new song it's not when a
[1:22:12] new preacher comes along it's when the
[1:22:14] revelation of the word of God is made
[1:22:18] plain in the age you're living in then
[1:22:20] Joy will return to the
[1:22:23] church well I got my joy shoes on in the
[1:22:26] house of God I'm not walking in
[1:22:28] confusion I'm not walking in men's ideas
[1:22:31] I'm walking in
[1:22:33] Revelation and I'm enthused about it I'm
[1:22:37] walking in Clarity I'm walking in
[1:22:39] understanding I'm walking in wisdom I'm
[1:22:42] walking in knowledge I'm walking in the
[1:22:44] power of the
[1:22:47] Resurrection when the Mysteries are made
[1:22:49] clear the people who are
[1:22:52] sad come on church will be turned to Joy
[1:22:57] I can take it to Malachi 4 amen and that
[1:23:00] day their
[1:23:02] hearts shall be turned to the father I
[1:23:06] can take you to Corinthians Paul said
[1:23:08] there shall be one day which shall be
[1:23:10] known to the Lord and at that day when
[1:23:13] it shall turn to the Lord the veil will
[1:23:16] be done away with see the Mysteries
[1:23:19] being revealed was a prophecy to bring a
[1:23:22] great joy in the church now you know the
[1:23:25] prophet of God said the Palmer worm he
[1:23:27] has eat away come on now he has eat away
[1:23:31] the Joy from the church in 1962 the the
[1:23:35] restoration of the Bride tree he said we
[1:23:37] find out he took away the joy see David
[1:23:40] one time lost the joy of his salvation
[1:23:43] he didn't lose his salvation he lost the
[1:23:46] joy of it see but he just cried out Lord
[1:23:50] restore to me the joy of my salvation
[1:23:55] come on church do you see what happened
[1:23:57] when the message come people were done
[1:24:00] with religion they were done with men's
[1:24:02] ideas they were done with Creeds they
[1:24:04] were done with dogmas but God behold in
[1:24:07] his word restored the joy of our
[1:24:10] salvation by revealing the Seven Seals
[1:24:13] and thundering seven Thunders and
[1:24:15] opening our
[1:24:18] eyes see then there is a connection
[1:24:21] between eating and the fruit see the
[1:24:24] Palmer worm are you with me the Palmer
[1:24:26] worm begin to eat fruit off eat the
[1:24:28] fruit of Joy off right amen but watch
[1:24:31] but the bride begins to
[1:24:34] eat God have mercy the Palmer worm eats
[1:24:38] the fruit off but as the bride begins to
[1:24:41] eat the fruit is
[1:24:43] restored come on as the Palmer worm ate
[1:24:46] the enthusiasm left the church but as
[1:24:49] the bride begins to eat Joy begins to
[1:24:53] return
[1:24:55] now come on I want to know what is she
[1:24:57] eating come on I want to know what is
[1:24:59] she eating well according to Revelation
[1:25:02] 2:17 to him that overcometh will I give
[1:25:05] to eat of the Hidden mana and will give
[1:25:08] him a white stone and in the stone a new
[1:25:10] name written which no man knoweth saving
[1:25:13] he that receiveth see the brother said
[1:25:16] look he said the hidden Mana is a little
[1:25:19] something
[1:25:22] special the hidden man man is a little
[1:25:25] something special what is the special is
[1:25:28] it the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no
[1:25:31] that's for the whole congregation but
[1:25:33] the hidden Mana was a special Revelation
[1:25:37] CZ he had to teach it to others see was
[1:25:40] a little more knowledge of the scripture
[1:25:43] that he could teach others come on
[1:25:45] Church Pentecost was shouting and
[1:25:47] dancing but when a Prophet come among
[1:25:49] the church he begin to reach in there
[1:25:51] and get some of that hidden Mana well I
[1:25:54] don't I don't know what's wrong in here
[1:25:55] tonight amen but it's a devil trying to
[1:25:58] bind this meeting and I rebuke it in the
[1:26:00] name of Jesus
[1:26:02] Christ I rebuke the devil over this
[1:26:04] church I rebuke the spirit of confusion
[1:26:07] I rebuke the spirit of division I rebuke
[1:26:10] the spirit I bind it in the name of
[1:26:12] Jesus Christ and I loose the anointing
[1:26:15] of the Holy Ghost to fill Hearts bring

[1:27:19] sink this church you may try to bind
[1:27:21] this Fellowship you may try to break
[1:27:23] this Ministry but you're too late
[1:27:26] there's a bride who has already gone
[1:27:28] beyond the veil and she's feeding on the
[1:27:31] special Revelation she's overcoming her
[1:27:34] problems she's overcoming her situations
[1:27:37] she's overcoming the sicknesses and the
[1:27:39] confusions because she's feeding on
[1:27:42] something that's giv her some enthusiasm
[1:27:45] it's giving her some Joy it's giving her

[1:28:17] sanctification let's go beyond the
[1:28:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost let's go into
[1:28:22] the word
[1:28:25] let's go into the hidden
[1:28:27] Mana let's go where only the priest can
[1:28:31] go let's go get some shoe
[1:28:34] bread yes sir it was a special
[1:28:39] thing that hidden Mana it was a special

[1:29:20] when brother Steven was talking about
[1:29:21] that three-fold purpose I just received
[1:29:24] a text from brother Donnie Reagan before
[1:29:25] church and he was actually sharing with
[1:29:27] me where someone had went on a on an
[1:29:30] artificial intelligence and they spoke
[1:29:32] to the artificial intelligence and they
[1:29:33] said would you tell me the what would
[1:29:36] you tell me what William Brandon meant
[1:29:38] when he preached a sermon called Christ
[1:29:40] is the mystery of God revealed this this
[1:29:43] person asked artificial intelligence and
[1:29:46] artificial intelligence comes back and
[1:29:48] says I know who William Brandon was he
[1:29:50] was the 20th century Prophet who was
[1:29:53] prominent in the healing campaign and
[1:29:55] give the exact date of when he preached
[1:29:57] Christ is the mystery and said now this
[1:29:59] was the point of what he was trying to
[1:30:01] make and Christ is the mystery he was
[1:30:03] trying to show that Jesus Christ is the
[1:30:07] entire theme of The
[1:30:08] Bible I thought oh my God oh my
[1:30:13] God and begin to break it
[1:30:18] down begin to break it down as if we
[1:30:21] were reading the book itself can I I say
[1:30:24] this even artificial intelligence knows
[1:30:27] that this message is a special
[1:30:31] Revelation only given to the Overcomers
[1:30:34] you know what I say I don't care what
[1:30:36] you think about it I don't care what you
[1:30:38] label me I am a message
[1:30:41] believer come on Amen the artificial
[1:30:43] intelligence ain't going to out believe
[1:30:46] me and hell ain't going to out believe
[1:30:48] me I believe this manner will change our
[1:30:51] bodies
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:56] my goodness even artificial intelligence
[1:30:59] has testified that this is a special
[1:31:02] Revelation see what is it it's word it's
[1:31:05] word
[1:31:09] bread it's word
[1:31:14] bread it's perfect
[1:31:17] mana and if a man lives by it he shall
[1:31:21] never die come on Church in every age
[1:31:25] God begin to give back by Revelation
[1:31:28] what was hidden until this last day
[1:31:31] according to Revelation 10:7 a prophet
[1:31:34] will come and will reveal all the
[1:31:37] Mysteries and then the Lord will come so
[1:31:40] I say this to you tonight we are not
[1:31:42] feeding on
[1:31:44] enthusiasm but there is an enthusiasm
[1:31:47] coming from what we're feeding
[1:31:50] on come on Church there is a special
[1:31:53] revelation
[1:31:56] now now now how many has got the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost let me see your hand you got the
[1:31:59] Holy Ghost so the spirit of God is
[1:32:02] dwelling in you now we always talk about
[1:32:05] the words got to feed us but listen what
[1:32:08] a prophet said he said if you neglect to
[1:32:11] feed that Holy Spirit the word of
[1:32:15] God so it's not just the word feeding
[1:32:18] you but it's you feeding the Holy
[1:32:22] Spirit that's on the inside of you see
[1:32:25] every word shall be by the Holy Spirit
[1:32:28] and listen if you're trying to feed it
[1:32:30] the wrong thing if it's the genuine Holy
[1:32:33] Spirit in you it will know the
[1:32:35] difference now watch here God is feeding
[1:32:39] his church how is he feeding his church
[1:32:41] by the revealing of the son of man in
[1:32:44] Luke 17:30 who is the son of man he is
[1:32:47] the word see and he comes in three sons
[1:32:50] names the son of man the son of God and
[1:32:54] the son of David but in between the Son
[1:32:56] of God and the son of David he promised
[1:32:59] to reveal himself as son of man once
[1:33:02] again not down through the church age
[1:33:05] through justification sanctification but
[1:33:08] the son of man the word and is quicker
[1:33:11] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:33:13] listen the son of man is Christ he is
[1:33:17] the one that you're feeding on you're
[1:33:19] not feeding on a man a man his words
[1:33:22] will fail but you are feeding on the
[1:33:25] unfailing body
[1:33:29] word you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:33:32] body word of the son of man so let me
[1:33:35] say this the son of man is
[1:33:38] here to feed the church and as he's
[1:33:42] feeding the church he is establishing
[1:33:44] our hearts Amen in the present truth let
[1:33:47] me just say this to you you put any
[1:33:50] scripture in the Bible under
[1:33:52] consideration and you take what brother
[1:33:54] bandam taught about it and and lay it
[1:33:57] over it amen you will see it's the
[1:34:02] truth whatever he taught just lay it
[1:34:05] over that scripture and it's the truth
[1:34:07] see because it wasn't him it was the
[1:34:11] spirit of
[1:34:12] Truth when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:34:16] come he will lead you and guide you into
[1:34:19] all truth amen now now now can I just
[1:34:22] say this we have have had a prophet
[1:34:24] among us we're not looking for another
[1:34:30] one we have had a Vindicated voice among
[1:34:33] us we're not looking for another one the
[1:34:36] prophet of God said and we do have today
[1:34:40] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[1:34:44] of the word with Divine
[1:34:48] Vindication how many agrees we have it
[1:34:51] we're not looking for it we have it
[1:34:55] but then he comes along and says as it
[1:34:56] is in every age people let man put their
[1:35:00] own interpretation to it by Theology and
[1:35:04] they will not believe God's Divine
[1:35:06] Vindication of it that's God's
[1:35:09] interpretation and what I say what
[1:35:11] somebody else says not what I say not
[1:35:14] what somebody else says but what God has
[1:35:16] promised and what God does proves that
[1:35:19] it's God doing his own interpreting of
[1:35:21] his word now listen friends
[1:35:23] denominations have established people in
[1:35:26] misinterpreted and misrepresented views
[1:35:29] of the scripture but let me say this the
[1:35:31] Holy Ghost is here now the spirit of
[1:35:35] Truth to establish our lives in the
[1:35:38] perfect interpretation of the scriptures
[1:35:41] can I just go ahead and say it can I
[1:35:42] just get it out there the message of the
[1:35:45] hour is not
[1:35:48] cliches it's not words of memorization
[1:35:52] it's the present day power power to live
[1:35:55] a Christian Life that is worthy of the
[1:35:58] Gospel listen friends the message of the
[1:36:01] hour is the Divine or rather perfect
[1:36:04] interpretation with Divine Vindication
[1:36:08] do you realize we find the all the way
[1:36:09] back in the Old Testament in Genesis
[1:36:12] chapter 3 that there was Messianic
[1:36:14] prophecies right and the Bible said that
[1:36:17] he would put enmity between thee and the
[1:36:18] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:36:21] and it shall bruise thy head and that
[1:36:23] shall bruise his heel now the prophet of
[1:36:25] God picks this up and he says they spoke
[1:36:28] of it in symbols and it went Plum over
[1:36:30] the top of their head and Plum under the
[1:36:32] rest of them see went under one and over
[1:36:34] the other one see by the time he arrived
[1:36:37] on the scene of time the people to whom
[1:36:40] he was sent had their own
[1:36:44] interpretation of what he was to be are
[1:36:46] y'all ready for this in their own
[1:36:49] imaginary
[1:36:51] interpretation my goodness
[1:36:54] so there's actually an imaginary
[1:36:56] interpretation but the Bible never
[1:36:58] changed he said now the Messiah had been
[1:37:01] prophesied and when he come was in such
[1:37:03] a simple way in Simplicity till the
[1:37:07] whole church group stumbled over it but
[1:37:09] listen here he said now look all those
[1:37:12] lived right in the word but they formed
[1:37:14] their own way of it and their children
[1:37:16] had accepted it in such a way that the
[1:37:18] fathers had taught it until the fathers
[1:37:21] had taught it off of the real way and
[1:37:23] they made such an organization out of it
[1:37:25] to when the spirit tried to present
[1:37:27] truth they couldn't receive it and
[1:37:30] that's the same thing today now I know
[1:37:33] what I'm talking about because imaginary
[1:37:37] interpretation has returned again and we
[1:37:40] have imagined the way God has fulfilled
[1:37:42] his word but listen church we don't have
[1:37:45] to imagine we've had a prophet Among
[1:37:49] [Applause]
[1:37:52] Us come on I know what I'm talking about
[1:37:55] amen because false Doctrine goes from
[1:37:56] one
[1:37:57] generation to the Next Generation oh
[1:38:01] well we might as well preach at me
[1:38:02] brother Craig it just keeps on going and
[1:38:05] somewhere somebody's got to stand up and
[1:38:08] have a backbone and say that's not the
[1:38:10] way the prophet taught
[1:38:13] it come on that's not the way William
[1:38:16] Brandon preached it come on if somebody
[1:38:19] don't stand up our next generation is
[1:38:22] going to be believing God only knows
[1:38:25] what come on now I know what I'm talking
[1:38:28] about oh glory to God they've already
[1:38:31] taken the pictures out of the church
[1:38:32] they've already silenced the tapes
[1:38:34] they've already laid aside the books
[1:38:36] they've already brought commentaries
[1:38:38] back in and dror so and so in this
[1:38:40] Pentecostal Revival and this revivalist
[1:38:42] let me say it as plain as I know how
[1:38:44] come back to the perfect interpretation
[1:38:48] of the message of the hour say it the
[1:38:50] way a prophet said it
[1:38:54] come on there wouldn't be imaginary
[1:38:56] interpretations about the Rapture if men
[1:38:58] hadn't made him come on somebody amen oh
[1:39:02] brother Steven is just okay amen Amen
[1:39:05] brother br's going to come back and
[1:39:06] found an airplane imaginary
[1:39:09] interpretation imaginary interpretation
[1:39:12] well brother Ra's going to come back and
[1:39:13] sit up at 10 and we're all going to
[1:39:15] follow for two years imaginary
[1:39:19] interpretation well there's seven
[1:39:20] Thunders and there's seven men that's a
[1:39:22] voice to each Thunder imaginary
[1:39:26] interpretation come on I might as well
[1:39:28] preach I'm this close to it amen they'll
[1:39:30] go as far as to say this amen that the
[1:39:33] Holy Ghost is just a feeling imaginary
[1:39:40] interpretation it's the same thing today
[1:39:44] but the spirit is here to present
[1:39:47] truth can I say this but it's going to
[1:39:50] be present day truth
[1:39:56] can I ask you all just to brother stepen
[1:39:58] I'm at
[1:39:59] home can I just can I just ask y'all a
[1:40:02] real just a real blunt question is that
[1:40:04] okay brother Greg why do we have
[1:40:06] churches who claim to be message
[1:40:08] churches who claim to follow brother B's
[1:40:10] teachings and then they have meetings
[1:40:13] and say well don't quote brother
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:20] brand why do we have preachers who claim
[1:40:23] to be message preachers and they get up
[1:40:25] and work hard not to recognize that God
[1:40:28] sent a prophet I'll tell you why is
[1:40:31] imaginary interpretation has taken the
[1:40:34] place of perfect interpretation but you
[1:40:36] know what I say I say tear down every
[1:40:39] imaginary interpretation and lift up
[1:40:42] what a prophet
[1:40:43] said come on you can shoot me you can
[1:40:46] stab me you can beat me and bang me but

[1:42:22] pay the bills we come out of that
[1:42:25] nonsense we come out of man's
[1:42:27] interpretation we come out of Creeds and
[1:42:29] dogmas and ritualistic oh
[1:42:33] God I ain't going
[1:42:36] back I ain't going back I ain't going
[1:42:39] back to wondering around how to preach

[1:43:09] somebody actually sent it to me some
[1:43:11] some hirling that left the message and
[1:43:12] LIF off the ties of people for years but
[1:43:14] now all of a sudden the message is wrong
[1:43:16] so he gets up and says well there ain't
[1:43:17] no move of God in the message movement
[1:43:19] well you know what I say I say that's a
[1:43:21] line devil from the the pits of Hell
[1:43:24] William Mari and brandham taught a
[1:43:26] Pentecostal experience from 1947 to 1965
[1:43:31] and he never replaced a person receiving
[1:43:34] the indwelling of the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost will me prove it to you by the
[1:43:41] message brother RS asked two powerful
[1:43:43] questions in
[1:43:45] 1963 the first one is would the bride of
[1:43:47] Christ have a Ministry before the
[1:43:50] Rapture
[1:43:51] sure sure sure that's what's going on
[1:43:54] right now see the bride of Christ
[1:43:57] certainly that'ss the message of the
[1:44:00] Hour come on now she's got a Ministry
[1:44:04] it's a great ministry it's the ministry
[1:44:07] of the hour but it will be so
[1:44:12] humble oh mercy so where did he bring
[1:44:16] that humility in under the third pull so
[1:44:19] the bride's Ministry was not a public
[1:44:21] show
[1:44:26] 1964 will there be a move of the Holy
[1:44:29] Spirit signs and wonders and miracles
[1:44:32] done by the bride before she goes away
[1:44:35] or are we just waiting for his appearing
[1:44:37] he says now will there be now he says
[1:44:39] wait let me get this right see will
[1:44:41] there be Miracles done by the bride yes
[1:44:46] sir it's being done right
[1:44:50] now come on Amen I'm just going to say
[1:44:52] it I rebuke every Lon devil that says by
[1:44:56] the preaching of this message Miracles
[1:44:59] can't be done that's a ly devil I've
[1:45:02] heard him with these ears say well you
[1:45:04] can't just stand up there and teach the
[1:45:06] message and read quotes and have a move
[1:45:08] of God amen amen try to tell brother
[1:45:10] Wayne Lawson that when he stood over
[1:45:12] there in Norway and preached about the
[1:45:14] Seven Stars and declared the seven star
[1:45:17] was a man named William brandham and a
[1:45:19] woman bound with leukemia said amen to
[1:45:22] it the leukemia left her
[1:45:26] body come on Church truth is truth no
[1:45:30] matter what form it's preached in if

[1:45:46] about amen amen just a few years ago I
[1:45:49] was preaching and while I was preaching
[1:45:51] Amen on the influence of the third p I
[1:45:53] was preaching down the aisle just like
[1:45:55] this brother Greg preaching down the
[1:45:56] aisle and I didn't know it amen but
[1:45:58] there was a friend of mine sitting there
[1:46:00] who has having back trouble and as I
[1:46:02] went by him I just laid my hand on him
[1:46:04] not even knowing what was wrong with him
[1:46:06] and he told me after service he said
[1:46:08] brother Andrew he said while you were
[1:46:10] preaching about the influence of the
[1:46:12] third pull he said the back pain left my
[1:46:16] [Applause]
[1:46:18] body come on Church come on you know why
[1:46:22] we're not running around hollering Jesus

[1:46:59] amen amen I'm I'm running out of time
[1:47:04] but but but but I'm getting here okay
[1:47:06] take your time can I your time can I say
[1:47:09] something the bride's Revival begin with
[1:47:13] the opening of the
[1:47:14] word which is the third pull which is
[1:47:18] the manifestation of those seven unknown
[1:47:21] Thunders which is opening of Seven Seals
[1:47:25] which is the divinely revealed mystery
[1:47:27] truths that were contained in those
[1:47:30] Seven
[1:47:33] Seals now in 1963 a prophet made that
[1:47:36] statement in
[1:47:38] 1963 and the word come open
[1:47:44] 1963 the word comes open and a prophet
[1:47:48] declares the revealing of the son of man
[1:47:51] the power of the word the re revelation
[1:47:53] of seven angels bringing the mystery
[1:47:55] right all those things are the opening
[1:47:57] of the word which was the igniting of
[1:48:00] the bride's Revival but right before he
[1:48:02] goes off the scene in 1965 he comes
[1:48:05] along in a sermon called ashamed and
[1:48:08] said see the Revival itself amongst the
[1:48:11] churches has
[1:48:14] died everyone knows that you feel it in
[1:48:18] this Tabernacle you feel it everywhere
[1:48:20] are you ready for this he says there is
[1:48:22] is a fum a dead feeling there is just
[1:48:25] something isn't right are you ready for
[1:48:28] this it's because the Revival
[1:48:34] enthusiasm it's because the Revival
[1:48:37] enthusiasm has gone away from the
[1:48:42] people go into the churches and you'll
[1:48:45] see them sitting there and the pastor
[1:48:48] stumbling around for a message and
[1:48:50] something other and the first thing you
[1:48:52] know he turned it off on some kind of a
[1:48:54] party they're going to have or something
[1:48:56] it seems to be a dead thump
[1:49:00] everywhere
[1:49:02] 1963 the Revival enthusiasm is already
[1:49:07] leaving the churches and a dead feeling
[1:49:10] th has come in there now now can I just
[1:49:13] say something to you I was I was sitting
[1:49:16] last night and I was just pondering over
[1:49:18] these things and I said Lord why is it
[1:49:20] that we have such a powerful message and
[1:49:23] and here we are amen amen here we are 50
[1:49:26] 60 years and we still got guys playing
[1:49:28] with
[1:49:30] it we still got churches saying things
[1:49:32] like well we need to get back to the
[1:49:34] Bible we just need to get back to
[1:49:35] preaching Christ and we just need to get
[1:49:37] back to B oh God I'm going to get in
[1:49:40] trouble sure as the world are you
[1:49:42] hearing me why is that Lord and just as
[1:49:45] plain as I'm talking to you the spirit
[1:49:47] of the Lord spoke these words to My
[1:49:48] Heart said if we lose our enthusiasm of
[1:49:51] the belief of special Revelations we
[1:49:54] will become embarrassed of them I said
[1:49:57] oh my Lord right there it is we've lost
[1:50:01] our enthusiasm of being identified by
[1:50:04] special
[1:50:07] Revelation and instead of being enthused
[1:50:09] by it we become embarrassed by
[1:50:12] it come on Church am amen we become
[1:50:15] embarrassed to say that a woman
[1:50:17] shouldn't dress a certain way and a man
[1:50:19] shouldn't act a well come on Amen but
[1:50:22] what happened is the the
[1:50:26] enthusiasm so now you got entire groups
[1:50:29] of people scared to death of Revelation
[1:50:31] well I'm not afraid of
[1:50:34] Revelation I'm not afraid of it I don't
[1:50:37] care what a man done with the word
[1:50:38] revelation I know what a prophet
[1:50:41] taught listen friends amen the devil
[1:50:44] wants us to do listen what the devil
[1:50:45] wants to do he wants to replace our
[1:50:47] enthusiasm of the message with
[1:50:50] embarrassment of the message that's why
[1:50:52] Jesus Jesus said whosoever therefore
[1:50:53] shall be ashamed of me and of my words
[1:50:56] in this adulterous and sinful generation
[1:50:59] of him who also shall the son of man be
[1:51:01] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[1:51:04] his father with the Holy Angels Paul
[1:51:08] says Romans 1:15 he says so as much as
[1:51:11] in me is I am ready to preach the gospel
[1:51:14] to you that are at Rome also that's
[1:51:17] right listen in other words he says I'm
[1:51:20] infused yes sir I'm ready to tell
[1:51:22] somebody about the pillar of fire I'm
[1:51:25] ready to preach to the Romans about the
[1:51:27] power of Christ I'm ready to tell them
[1:51:29] about my conversion well well I might as
[1:51:32] well say it amen Andrew Glover is ready
[1:51:34] to preach the message Steven Shango is
[1:51:37] ready Thomas cross is ready brother
[1:51:39] Kelly is ready we are ready to preach
[1:51:42] the revealing of the son of man because
[1:51:45] we are infused by it we're not
[1:51:47] embarrassed about it we are infused
[1:51:50] about it
[1:51:53] it's a fervor it's a Zeal it's a passion
[1:51:56] it's an ability to bring a
[1:51:59] special
[1:52:03] Revelation it ain't a burden to get up
[1:52:05] and say what a prophet said it's a
[1:52:08] blessing I'm not
[1:52:10] ashamed I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:52:15] Christ for it is the power of God under
[1:52:18] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:52:21] the Jew first first yes sir and also to
[1:52:24] the Greek that's right can I say this
[1:52:27] he's
[1:52:28] here he's here he's here the special
[1:52:34] Revelation is here the shoe bread is
[1:52:37] here sir the Seven Seals are open the
[1:52:40] mind of Christ is in the bride she has
[1:52:43] thus saith the Lord come on somebody the
[1:52:47] Holy Ghost is in the church quickening
[1:52:50] power is in the flesh of the mortal
[1:52:53] bodies of the Bride of Jesus
[1:52:55] Christ Hallelujah for the Lord God
[1:52:58] Isaiah 57 for the Lord God will help me
[1:53:01] therefore shall I not be
[1:53:05] confounded I will not be confounded
[1:53:08] therefore have I set my face like a
[1:53:10] flint and I know that I shall not be
[1:53:13] ashamed it it I know I shall not be
[1:53:20] embarrassed I know I shall not be
[1:53:24] humiliated
[1:53:26] Hallelujah now amen I've got to tie this
[1:53:29] together because what is happening in
[1:53:32] the natural yes sir is also happening in
[1:53:34] the spiritual do you realize it's an
[1:53:36] identity crisis
[1:53:38] time where there's pressure on men not
[1:53:41] to be
[1:53:43] men and women not to be
[1:53:46] women that's why you have boys going in
[1:53:48] girls'
[1:53:49] bathrooms and women going in men's
[1:53:52] bathrooms rooms because it's an identity
[1:53:54] crisis it's an age of pressure but look
[1:53:57] what a prophet said he said but the
[1:53:59] bride of Christ is not unsure of what
[1:54:01] she believes he said she is not ashamed
[1:54:04] of him see she knows he is the word so
[1:54:08] the word of God and the messenger of the
[1:54:11] age was the self same thing all the time
[1:54:15] see Jesus was the word that was
[1:54:18] prophesied of he was the word manifested
[1:54:21] so what is Christ Christ is revealed and
[1:54:24] made manifest in his own word now look
[1:54:27] here what a prophet of God says and
[1:54:29] we're inside of Christ now all True
[1:54:32] Believers see him the Word of Promise
[1:54:35] for this day openly manifested in order
[1:54:39] to do this our old denominational Veil
[1:54:43] must be rent again see then look in Luke
[1:54:45] chapter 4 aen now I'm going to tie this
[1:54:48] together okay in Luke chapter 4 the
[1:54:50] Bible says the Messiah was sitting in
[1:54:53] the temple he was there to identify
[1:54:55] himself with a Word of Promise for that
[1:54:58] age and the prophet said how could those
[1:55:00] people failed to see who he was how did
[1:55:02] they ever miss it when it was so plainly
[1:55:05] made known and showed how could they
[1:55:07] ever miss seeing it think of it this day
[1:55:09] this scripture is fulfilled see now
[1:55:13] watch the Messiah himself is standing in
[1:55:17] the presence of the congregation he's
[1:55:19] reading a word out of the Bible that's
[1:55:22] pertaining to himself and then says
[1:55:25] today this scripture is fulfilled and
[1:55:29] they fail to see it can I say this they
[1:55:32] should have been filled with enthusiasm
[1:55:36] but instead they were full of
[1:55:39] embarrassment that's right come on when
[1:55:42] Jesus picked up the scroll and turned to
[1:55:44] Isaiah and read about himself and went
[1:55:47] over and sat down and said this day this
[1:55:50] scripture is fulfilled they should have
[1:55:52] been rejoicing they should have been
[1:55:54] shouting they should have been hollering
[1:55:56] they should have been pumping their fist
[1:55:59] and saying this is him scriptures
[1:56:01] fulfilled but instead they was
[1:56:03] embarrassed now how was they embarrassed
[1:56:06] because they believed
[1:56:09] man's
[1:56:11] private
[1:56:14] interpretation
[1:56:17] imaginary imaginary
[1:56:20] interpretation blind them from
[1:56:23] seeing word
[1:56:27] manifestation what are you saying
[1:56:29] preacher I'm saying it's very popular to
[1:56:31] say I'm a Christian very popular to say
[1:56:34] oh yes I'm a Christian but do you
[1:56:36] believe the word of God where it said
[1:56:37] these signs shall follow them that
[1:56:39] believe oh even ministers faces will
[1:56:42] blush that's right Are you ashamed to
[1:56:45] say Divine Healing or the Full Gospel or
[1:56:48] your Pentecostal experience that's being
[1:56:51] ashamed of his word see that's his word
[1:56:56] made
[1:56:57] flesh in
[1:56:59] you can I can I leave you with this
[1:57:04] remember to be ashamed means you're not
[1:57:07] sure that's right brother R said if
[1:57:10] you're embarrassed so you would rather
[1:57:13] not discuss the
[1:57:17] subject now we just found
[1:57:20] out so don't get in the pull pit and
[1:57:23] mention brother br's name so you don't
[1:57:24] have to explain it to somebody that God
[1:57:25] sent a
[1:57:28] prophet because you yourself are unsure
[1:57:31] that's
[1:57:32] right so you yourself is unsure so how
[1:57:35] can you exactly
[1:57:37] right so you'd rather not discuss the
[1:57:40] subject that's
[1:57:43] right well the problem of God said how
[1:57:45] can a man who's filled with the Holy
[1:57:47] Ghost how can a man full of the power of
[1:57:49] God and the love of God in his heart
[1:57:51] talk to a man a few minutes and not
[1:57:54] mention something about the love that's
[1:57:56] in his heart that's right come on church
[1:57:58] if I'm in love with this message how can
[1:58:01] I stand in a pull pit and preach to you
[1:58:03] for a solid hour and never say nothing
[1:58:06] about
[1:58:07] it this must be the evil day that Jesus
[1:58:09] spoke of people are ashamed of the word
[1:58:14] and of the spirit of God that acts
[1:58:16] within
[1:58:17] them that's exactly right but when the
[1:58:20] truth is made plain to the people that's
[1:58:22] it God then himself reveals himself
[1:58:27] through the word amen amen amen can I
[1:58:31] Leave You Fifth people are not
[1:58:33] embarrassed by claims that are not made
[1:58:35] in the Bible claims that are not made in
[1:58:38] the Bible people are not one bit
[1:58:39] embarrassed about it but for some odd
[1:58:41] reason brother CLA they are embarrassed
[1:58:44] by claims that are made in the Bible
[1:58:46] said allil flowing through people he
[1:58:48] said blood out of their hands and women
[1:58:49] on their back in this blood and running
[1:58:51] down their shoes and raise up their
[1:58:53] shoes and pour oil out and frogs jumping
[1:58:55] out and hopping down the platform and
[1:58:57] all kinds of things like that he says
[1:58:59] they'll believe that they're not they're
[1:59:01] not embarrassed to that he said but when
[1:59:03] it comes to genuine unadulterated word
[1:59:05] of God confirmed by God it seems to even
[1:59:08] embarrass the other group on the radical
[1:59:11] side see there is an embarrassment about
[1:59:13] it are you ready for this but it's a
[1:59:16] reality it's a reality to a man or woman
[1:59:19] to a boy or girl who is really a genuine
[1:59:22] Christian when God made the promise of
[1:59:25] the Holy Spirit and you receive it there
[1:59:27] is something that settles within you
[1:59:29] it's not an emotional workup it's not
[1:59:32] some enthusiasm or some religious
[1:59:34] Doctrine or some catechism or Creed or
[1:59:36] Dogma amen but when he really comes to a
[1:59:39] place like Moses did on the backside of
[1:59:41] the desert he can walk up face to face
[1:59:43] with almighty God and you see the voice
[1:59:46] speaking to you exactly with the word of
[1:59:48] the promise of the hour there is
[1:59:50] something it does to you
[1:59:53] see see you're not ashamed of it it does
[1:59:58] something to you can I tell you what it
[2:00:01] does to you it restores the joy of your
[2:00:07] salvation Hallelujah the preaching of
[2:00:10] the message of the hour is the restoring
[2:00:13] of the Salvation to the Sons and
[2:00:15] Daughters of
[2:00:16] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:21] hallelujah yes hallelujah what are you
[2:00:23] saying I'm saying the word sir is the
[2:00:26] identification upon the
[2:00:29] church hallelujah
[2:00:32] hallelujah let me say what a prophet
[2:00:34] said he says see this modern church is
[2:00:37] embarrassed see this modern Church
[2:00:39] neither does she wanted them hear
[2:00:40] screaming
[2:00:42] shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young
[2:00:46] ons around her yeah see she don't want
[2:00:49] of them whooping crying screaming amen
[2:00:52] and
[2:00:56] Hallelujah why such a child would
[2:00:59] immediately put her out of her
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:04] denomination can I say this yes sir you
[2:01:07] were carrying Christ and you had to
[2:01:09] birth him so it put you
[2:01:12] out the birth of the
[2:01:15] word put you
[2:01:19] out so you see she she's pregnated with
[2:01:22] something cuz she's bringing forth
[2:01:24] members all the time but she don't want
[2:01:27] none of them screaming hollering
[2:01:29] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[2:01:33] she thinks they are it would certainly
[2:01:35] embarrass her it would ruin her and her
[2:01:39] educated ethical scientific Society
[2:01:41] Church that she belonged to they would
[2:01:43] throw her out at the next Council she
[2:01:45] can't have it so she don't want to be
[2:01:47] pregnated with the word because that's
[2:01:50] the only kind
[2:01:53] that's it that's the only kind that the
[2:01:58] word that the word can bring forth born
[2:02:03] of the spirit of God it has the spirit
[2:02:08] of God in it won't you stand your feet
[2:02:12] tonight and give God
[2:02:13] [Applause]
[2:02:17] praise we must not
[2:02:20] lose our enthusias
[2:02:23] can I say this Paul was not embarrassed
[2:02:26] of his
[2:02:28] conversion on the on the road down to
[2:02:30] Damascus he come in presence contact
[2:02:32] with God an angel come down from heaven
[2:02:34] in a form of a pillar of fire a light
[2:02:35] struck him on the ground he raised up
[2:02:37] and said Lord who are you and he said I
[2:02:40] am
[2:02:41] Jesus now listen standing before a
[2:02:44] grippa he repeated the story
[2:02:49] again he said I'm not ashamed
[2:02:52] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is
[2:02:55] the power of God un salvation sir to
[2:02:59] everyone that believes he said see a man
[2:03:01] who once come in contact with God which
[2:03:03] is the word and the word has been made
[2:03:04] plain and manifested to him there is no
[2:03:07] shamess about that you're not
[2:03:09] embarrassed it oh I could shout on this
[2:03:12] quote it don't embarrass me to say I
[2:03:14] believe every word of God it don't
[2:03:16] embarrass me when the Lord says to say
[2:03:18] anything you go say it and do it it
[2:03:20] don't embarrass me to say that I've been
[2:03:21] filled with the Holy Ghost it don't
[2:03:23] embarrass me to say that I spoke with
[2:03:25] other tongues it don't embarrass me to
[2:03:27] say that the Lord has showed me Visions
[2:03:29] it don't embarrass me to say the same
[2:03:31] yesterday today and forever God help us
[2:03:34] not to be ashamed but help us to be a
[2:03:37] living
[2:03:41] testimony any disciple of Christ who has
[2:03:45] come in contact with him in Redemption
[2:03:47] and salvation has come into his heart he
[2:03:50] is a possessor of God amen and what kind
[2:03:53] of life should we live how should we
[2:03:54] walk how should we talk if God is
[2:03:57] representing himself through our own
[2:03:59] mortal bodies who could be
[2:04:02] ashamed of
[2:04:05] that we've been given a duty
[2:04:08] Church brother said if I was come to a
[2:04:11] place I was on the police force here in
[2:04:12] Jeffersonville and I walked down the
[2:04:13] street and all the authorities I
[2:04:15] wouldn't be ashamed of the city I

[2:04:36] conduct no a prophet said I'm a part of
[2:04:39] the

[2:04:49] part of it
[2:04:52] come on somebody you know why you're

[2:05:01] because you're a part of
[2:05:04] it it's who you are to be embarrassed of
[2:05:08] this message is to be embarrassed of who

[2:06:45] taught used to be an old brother I used
[2:06:48] to have a saying he'd say it's time to
[2:06:49] get in get out or get run over cuz we're
[2:06:54] going
[2:06:56] on you say brother Andrew that's hard is
[2:07:00] it
[2:07:01] really you're called to this
[2:07:04] word you're
[2:07:06] called Don't Lose Your
[2:07:09] Enthusiasm don't lose your
[2:07:12] Zeal don't lose your

[2:08:28] into the fifth row and then the fifth
[2:08:30] row turns in the back
[2:08:32] row and then the back row turns into the
