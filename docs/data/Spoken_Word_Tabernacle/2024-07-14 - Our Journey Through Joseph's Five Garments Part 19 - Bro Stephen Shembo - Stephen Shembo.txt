do it like job put them under prayer so that the Lord can give them a successful and blessed year and everybody can come here valedictorian with great great do you believe it if he did it for one he can do it for the other amen yes we got some folks out time of the year for vacation and things so enjoy your day and hopefully where you you are you are somewhere in service amen let's go to our sermon and pick up where we started uh last Sunday amen amen amen amen glory to God Amen before we read this scripture let me just give you the title okay so if we get where we supposed to get praise the Lord if we don't you know brother Aon say We Don't Preach to finish amen so our life journey through Joseph's five garment we are on part 19 everybody clear so far so let's go to our scripture now glory to God it's in the book of Exodus chapter eight if you dare you can say Amen brother Charles is not here he did a great job on Wednesday but he's moving up quickly Exodus chapter 8 verse one if you dare you can say Amen am the Bible says and the Lord spoke to Moses amen he said go to Pharaoh he says it's me saying not the scripture I don't want to add anything to the scripture that was me the Lord spoke to Moses he saying go to pharaoh and say to him that save the Lord let my people go that they may serve me you might be seated amen let me pray so we can move on Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is the best that I can do with the ability you have given me but when it comes to interpret to preach to minister to your children it only take you you are the only one the holy spirit that can do it father Lord I'm asking that you take me you move me completely out of the way and may you move the audience the congregation also away Lord father may you be the one speaking and the one hearing and the one interpreting and the one teaching because your Prophet taught us that you are the inside teacher be the beginning and the ending of this service and bless your children and those that are still on the road coming father may you protect them and give them to our Mercy we commit it all unto th hand father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen the Bible says and the Lord spoke to Moses go to pharaoh and say to him thus says the Lord let my people go that they may serve me everybody okay and if you refuse to let them go behold I will smart all your borders with frogs yes Lord and the rivers shall bring forth frog abundantly which shall go up and come into your house and into your bed chamber and upon your bed and into the house of your servant and upon your people into your ovens and into your needing throw meaning your balls and the Frog shall come up both on you and upon your people and upon all your servant and the Lord spoke to Moses saying to Aaron say to Aaron stretch forth your hand with your road over the streams of the rivers and over the ponds and cause frog to come up upon the land of Egypt and Aaron stretched out his hand over the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and cover the land of Egypt and The Magicians did so with the enchantment and brought up frogs upon the land amen amen when we read scripture like this the way I just read we come up with all kind of ideas yes we just read it together so at the end you have an idea of what we were reading and if I ask several of you right here I say what did you read you would tell me Moses went to pharaoh and when he went to Pharaoh God told him let my people go and he spoke to Pharaoh he said Pharaoh let my people go if you refuse I'm going to send frog and Moses brought up the Frog and the magician also did the same thing and they brought up the frog that is what everybody will say Amen we will say it in the message amen and outside of the message but that's not the case that's not really what the Bible is saying and the people take this and they make movie amen am here we say amen and the people make movie and they make cartoons and all we know we will see Moses and Aaron bringing for frogs and then the magician also creating frogs so this one is bringing this one is bringing and that's what we have that's not what the scripture says break it down it are we together amen are we together amen we are dealing with the five garments of Joseph and amen and we are still in the Garment of a slave or a servant and we went through Jesus Christ we took Elijah we took uh Elisha we took uh uh what is his name we took Paul we took David we took Joshua we took Israel we took Rebecca we took zipora Rachel all these and we landed on Moses right amen when we landed on Moses we found that Moses first started as a prince amen amen and when he was a PR a prince in Egypt the Bible say he was m in words you remember that brother Greg pred up to me and he was also Mighty in Deeds this word here he was mighty in speech amen and if Moses was mighty in speech in Egypt that's what when God asked him let me send you back to Egypt why was he having a problem with his tongue when he come to the word you are a champion amen when it comes to the things of God then we begin to back up I'm not worthy to do it again but in the world he was a m ined m in speech but when it comes to take responsibility or position of what God put him Moses backed up let's go so I told you keep your seat belt amen amen and then he moved from a prce he become a servant because he desired to be like a slave he become a servant to jro amen his father-in-law and from there in the Burning Bush brother Bram told us that he became a prisoner and then from there he have to go back again to appear before Pharaoh amen but when he goes to appear before Pharaoh he's going to be a God so God Was preparing Moses to become a God can you say amen amen the problem is all of this you will agree with me you will accept it without any problem when it comes to a God you got a problem thank God he was written in the Old Testament I didn't write it you didn't write it my parent didn't write it your parent didn't write it so we know it's the word of God and Heaven and Earth will pass away by the word of God will never pass away so the the the hardest thing we have is Moses taking his position as a god brother Bram say God would have healed him of his speech impediment amen but he doubted and turned it to his brother amen so now we hear the God is sent to pharaoh and according to what he what we read we found out that hey he spoke to Pharaoh Pharaoh didn't listen they brought up frog the magician did the same thing and that's what we have in movie that's what we' seen in Jehovah witness's books that's what we have in cartoons but that's not the case that's wrong come on come on brother Bram says that in the exposition of the church ages that but as usual when one regard a verse superficially amen amen he comes up with what a superficial understanding this is very serious it's simple but it's serious meaning if you look or you have a knowledge of something superficially amen you will even behave based on The Superficial understanding you reing I don't know if you're getting me if you know a woman superficially you will treat her based on The Superficial knowledge to you she might be just a human being sir you don't understand that this is somebody that God created in his own image and God own likeness and if you lack that understanding to really understand who she is you're going to treat her any kind of way you going to be her any kind of way a super fici understanding goes with a superficial life and the same thing happen in message churches we all read the prophet but the understanding is different and depending on the level of understanding whether the church understand the prophet superficially or in the deepness of what the prophet is saying and if the church understand the prophet superficially your life will go no higher than your understanding can you say Amen brother Bram says this glory to God we already prayed so I'm sorry brother Bram says this in the bless said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram say usually in a meeting it should be three night of teaching I'm reading brother Bram it should be how many nights of teaching three night so before brother brandham prays for the sick brother brandham have to teach the audience three night in the room but look what we doing that's why people don't get healed because they they only cut into a superficial understanding which will produce a superficial Faith a faith that work for sometime and when the devil begin to challenge you you are not granded in the word you don't have grand you don't have solid root in the word and before you know it your healing begin to be doubted and nothing happened to you amen and brother Bram said before he goes to start praying he goes three night teaching the church bringing the church back down to the scripture to the word of God first didn't I tell you keep your seat belt glory to God brother Bram say it should be three night of teaching before we even have a what a prayer line wow we preach 45 minutes we preach 25 minutes and you start praying for the sick because we have inserted a story that plays with the emotions of the people and before you know it the people begin to feel pity and they begin to come to the altar to be prayed for all of that is superficial they don't have a real fa real faith when they teach three night you won't wait for the prayer line when the teaching goes the first night the second night before they even get to the third night somebody will leave the whe chair because they begin to understand the purpose of God and the Very thought of God about the situation [Applause] my people suffer for lack of [Music] knowledge everybody okay everybody okay brother Bram say because why do you do that because many time as these days especially when people who are not may be what T just in the what the Deep things can you say Amen so there is two kind of a teaching hallu they can teach you superficial things amen amen or they can teach you deep things amen and your faith [Music] depend the level of your faith the an gear of your faith the magnitude of your faith depend on where they granted youah if they Grant you on the first pole you won't go higher than that if the preacher can only Grant you on the second pool you won't go any higher than that but whoever is granted on the third pool the third pool is a package of the first and the second pool are we together brother brandham say this day especially when people who are not may be taught just in the what the Deep things of this great move of God in the past 40 years that swept around the world they might not understand just right because of lack of teaching and they come just a little critical of what or something so when people criticize things sometime it's not their fault they were not t right that's why they criticize things that's why Jesus told the woman at the if you know who's asking you you know if you have an understanding of who is asking you instead of me asking you what you will be the one asking me the water of life but lack of understanding you are you are you are you are living without restrain you are even criticizing the very work of God and you're going to find yourself fighting against God amen Amen brother Bram said they might not understand just right and they come just a little critical of something or may be no wanting to be but not understanding what the word so you can imagine what a job it will be for who the Holy Spirit to do what to press that into hearts at at what night in other words even God have a hard time to use one night to press faith into people because of lack of teaching but teaching of the spirit make it easy for you to receive it are we together are we together are we together Paul says this in the book of First Corinthians chapter 2 he said but as it is written what I have not seen and nor ears have what heard neither have entered into the heart of what the things which God had prepared for them that do what that love him it's already prepared for you but how do we receive it but God had one revealed revealed them unto us by what his spirit for the spirit search what all things yeah the what the Deep things of God so to receive the Deep things of God you don't just need the message you might have the message and the books and the tap and still you don't receive the things of God you need the message and the god of the message you need the prophet and the pillar of fire because the god of the Prophet is the one that's spoke to the prophet holy man of God spoke moved by the spirit of God so to really understand what the spirit was speaking through the prophet you need to have the spirit that was speaking in the prophet to really grasp what God is saying if not you're going to say superficially and lose the very deep things and your faith won't be different than a Pentecostal amen amen amen amen for what man knoweth the things of men sayth the spirit of men which is where in him in other word how can I know what brother Benjamin is thinking it takes brother Benjamin to know what he's thinking so the only way you would know what brother Benjamin is thinking you need to have brother Benjamin spirit and how are you going to know the things of God it's it's one plus one equal to how are you going to know the things of God you we we have to break it down like this so he sink really deep brother Paul say even saw the things of who God Noth what no man but who the spirit of God so to get into the deep things you got to get the spirit of God amen amen you need a submarine to take you down in the word and that submarine is the holy ghost without the Holy Ghost you will read the message but you don't really catch the vision and your behavior will prove how where you are which level you are which depth you are with God the deeper you get with God the more sincere your life will change not deeper in knowledge but deeper in Revelation are we together are we together brother Bram says in the message testimony he said May something special happen tonight this morning just something out there that the H holy spirit will just fall over what the people in such a way till they just keep they just can't keep from receiving it how hardly Lord do what granted and may they have a what a deep understanding open up their heart and and understanding Lord to know that these things are on to what the glory of God and for the edifying of God Church which Jesus purchased with his own blood for we ask it in Jesus name what amen and I pray this is my prayer for all of us this morning so that we can understand what is God really telling us when he said that you are [Music] God are we together we coming back to our scripture we read and according to our scripture MOS Moes and Aaron went they produced frogs and the magician imitate or mimic them and they also produce frog and that's what the movie says now let's go back again and let's reread together amen amen amen amen don't worry my friend you're doing good we there amen let's go Exodus 8 verse1 and the Lord spoke to Moses go to Pharaoh now let's read slowly I read with you quickly the way we read the Bible and we close and we think we got something superficial understanding amen and when they ask you a question after four or five weeks it's gone superficial understanding when it's a revelation it doesn't go anywhere amen amen if God reveal something in the scripture you won't forget it you will always remember that amen let's go and he say th sayth the Lord let my people go that they may serve me and if you refuse to let them go behold I will Smite all your borders with frogs watch now clearly and the river shall bring forth water now you begin to understand number one we talking about frogs amen the Bible say the river shall bring forth what FR that word the river singular shall do what bring forth in other words the river will produce are you following me or manufacture I'm going slowly now let me strike it hard oh create I'm going to go slowly I have to go 25 miles an hour so you get this soaked in okay how many people here have seen a pond yes a pond before maybe a river amen have you seen a river filled with frog have you ever seen a I mean a pond filled with frog even if you go there and you hear frog how many will you see only few of them but God needed frogs and God need a certain quantity of frogs and that quantity need to be in people house am I reading a different Bible they need to be in the oven when you open your oven frog must be there okay let's read it because when I begin to go this rout it looks like my Bible different than yours let's go my friend let's go and the river shall bring forth what frog how abund so it means those frog were not in abundance that's right are we together are we together in other words God is saying the river must produce a great quantity meaning that the frog that were in the river were not a great quantity true bring forth how abundantly let's go slowly abundantly what which shall go up and come into what thine house and into your what thy bed chamber and into what thy bed and into the house of who thy servant and upon who thy people and into your water thine oven and into your water thy needing even in the pen that you cooking with there must be frog there can a river produce such a frog look at the city of uh Gastonia I mean right here how many houses do we have do you think that River Kaba that is here have enough frog to fill one house and fill the second and fill the third and fill every single houses in Egypt amen it's telling you that some frog were created amen they were not enough frog to do the job are we there and God told Moses he said the river will bring forth the river will give birth amen it will produce it will manufacture frog abundantly I need a great manufacturer I need a great order God is making an order a frog because he want those frog to fill every house every bed chamber every everybody that is in Egypt frog must be in your house frog in the kitchen frog in the oven frog everywhere so the first part here is about the creation amen who is going to create that right here he said the river are we together it didn't tell us who spoke the river will do it let's go slowly drop to verse four and the Frog shall come up on both upon both of you and upon your people and upon your what Serv so number one is the production of fruits follow me carefully number two is the movement of frogs amen from the river amen unto the land you need to read the scripture slowly if not you will come up with your own conception of what the spirit say do you remember I told you that the pillar of fire last time the way the Jo it was like the pillar of fire was on top and we found out that I was wrong the pillar of fire covered the entire the cloud covered the entire Mountain so we need to change our concept our way of looking at the scripture and come back to the word of the hour amen so number one the the Frog are created and the manufactur the river is filled with them number two the Frog must move from the river and come up into the land to go to their destination the package must be delivered are we together jum to verse five and the Lord spoke to Moses say to Aaron do what stretch forth thine hand with your road over what the streams over what the rivers over what all the warehouses are we there amen over the river and over the ponds and do what and cause frog and create frogs and create frogs is that what the scripture say and cause frog to do what to come up Aaron was not creating [Music] frogs I'm going slowly there the road of Aaron when he was stretch out he was not to create the word of Aaron was stretch out to cause the frog that were already been created to move onto the land the same God that took the animal in the time of Noah and brought them into the ark he knows how to give frog signal and give them a GPS to tell them which house to go and which of to get into it and the Frog are obeying following God's GPS until they reach their destination and they do God's job number one it's a creation number two it's a moving of the frog from the river to the land and that moving was made by Aaron not Moses Aaron amen but who created the Frog are we together we okay together jump now to verse uh uh six and Aaron stretch we on six amen yes and Aaron stretched out his hand over the water of Egypt and frog did what came up frog were not created frog just begin the moving when Aaron do this all the Frog begin the moving it looks like everybody was waiting for Aon amen amen and the Frog came up are we there amen and covered the what the land of Egypt we clear and the magician did so what did the medician do because we got two things here follow me carefully we got the creation and the moving amen when the magician copy what did they copy do you see now now your now your eyes are changing amen did the magician also create now we begin to talk my friend now we begin to talk my friend we getting somewhere the Bible says and the magician did so when we read did so in our conception the magician also created frog but let let me help you up with this my friend brother Bram says in the message sir we would see Jesus brother brandham say see God is alone in creation when it comes to Creation it is God only so if you make a movie of magician bringing up frogs you are giving power to Satan to create we going slowly my friend you are God you are God you are God all of you are gods and the ability to create only remain in the hands of a God I'm going slowly my friend God's alone in what creation the devil can create if you say the devil can heal then you make him what Creator then he is how Co equal with God Only God Alone can do what create the devil can only do what pervert what is already what created so God is the only one that is a Creator only God who is a Creator amen if you make the devil a Creator you make him coequal Co equal Co equal in other word the devil is not coequal with God that's why what the magician did the magician did not manufacture the Frog they didn't bring forth the Frog but they just caused the Frog let's read it together let's read it together my friend amen amen let's go to verse seven and the magician did so did so what what Aaron just did God Aaron moved the Frog to the land and the magician did so in other words they repeated what Aaron did follow me carefully my friend amen and they did so which their what enchantment their enchantment that's why they can have a circus and play with a lion it's an enchantment it is not Noah bringing the lion into the ark that is God power what happened in the circus is a is a pervasion an impersonation amen from the devil that's why a message believer should not go to a circus wherever you take your children watch where you taking your children you don't take your children to sit down and watch magician tricks they are bewitching your children I don't care if it's in the fair watch which fair you going to are we together are we together are we together glory to God he says the magician did so with their what enchantments and brought up not bringing forth bringing up bringing up frogs upon what so what the magician copy is number two they only copy to move the Frog into the land but the magician were not able to create the Frog nor to remove the Frog they can even bring the Frog but when it comes to remove the Frog they can't remove it if you having hard time drop to verse 11 verse 11 if you thereare you can say amen amen and the Frog shall depart from where the from thee and from what thy houses and from what thy servants and from what thy people and shall remain in the what river only so they were also frog in the river even though there were frog in the land frog still remain in the river and those that remain in the river are those that some of those are those that the magician move from the river all the way there what are you trying to say jum to verse 16 if you dare you can say amen amen and the Lord said to Moses say to Aaron follow me stretch out your road and smite the dust do you follow me of the land that he may become what light do you follow me we move from a frog amen now we got life follow me carefully amen amen life throughout all the land of Egypt and they did so for Aaron stretched out his hand with a road and smok the dust of the earth and he became Li in man and in beast and all the dust of the land became what Li throughout what all the land of Egypt and the magician did so follow me carefully with their what enchantment to do what to bring forth watch that word bringing forth amen amen Aaron took the road Smite and the dust turn into a life if you don't understand what I'm saying when Jesus was hungry I hope you getting the devil came to Jesus Christ and say if you are a son of God and you are hungry take this Stone and do what turn it into bread flip it into a bread a Son of God can do that amen what the devil was telling Jesus Christ if putting a doubt because a Son of God is a God you remember that and he said if putting that you a Son of God prove to me because a Son of God can take something like this and Manufacturing do you follow me and back here God is telling Aaron take your road Smart in the dust when Aaron smoke every dust follow me carefully every dust amen amen became what life when we die and and we get buried in a coffin and we are buried in the cemetery after a while your body begin to get destroyed yes sir if they give you more time maybe 10 15 or 20 40 years what will happen to that body it will become what so your body came from the dust that's what the scripture say and God told Aon stuck the dust now you begin to get my friend not stuck the word strick the dust and let the dust become what it was a creation I don't know if we are together amen amen amen whatever happened came from the dust if you destroy it everything bring God back to the dust God told ad I mean Adam I pull you from the dust and you will return from the dust so if God want to create a loved one that passed 200 years ago all that God have to do is speak to the and the element your composition your formul is still preserved and your element will begin to come together and reproduce your body and God told Aaron go back to the Dust this is what I did with Adam before I created Adam in Genesis 2 I formed him from the dust of the ground are we together are we together so God told Aon struck the desk and then it's going to be turned onto what light which is an action of what creation and the magician want to copy that let's see now job to Verse 18 and the magician did so with their what enchantments to bring forth what stop if you read right here you lost because brother Bram said the devil cannot create if you stop here you will think the magician created because the Bible said bring forth producing but let's continue the scripture my friend he says and the magician did so with their enchantment to bring forth FL but do you see that but in other word they try the magician try to create liall this is a creation right here if you don't understand me this is the third pool the magician try to impersonate the Third they tried to [Applause] create are we together are we together the Bible say but amen they could not for they were what light upon men and upon what they thought this is a cheap magician trick oh let's go ahead and do it they took it and struck nothing struck nothing struck nothing why is this not working when it's the moving of the Frog it's working but when it's Creation The Devil is locked because only God can create so there is an area where you can pass the border and the devil will never follow you if you stay on the first pool the devil can match you the second pool the devil can match you but if you are there pass the third Lon into the holiest of holy and you enter into the holiest under the third po no devil can enter there that is the real of the God you must have an identification of a god before you get there you show your ID I'm a God then the door open if you don't have a god chip a chap of God to use on the door that door will never open [Applause] up he won't open for the devil and his children but he will open for God and his children Aaron was able to do it but not the magician are we together I'm going slowly so we can sink this in are we together are we together amen the Bible says in verse 19 then the magician said to Pharaoh what this is the finger of so they understood that am I reading a different Bible when he reached creation the magician say ah this is what God this is the Finger of God this one is not a human being in other words our level have reached the limit we are stuck here we cannot go any higher than this this only take the Creator do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me if he was the Finger of God where was that finger [Music] [Applause] did you see God finger going and reaching the dust it was a rod of Aron that which the dust so who is the Finger of [Applause] God are we together are we together are we together Jesus say if you cast that Devil with what Finger of God with what the finger the Finger of God so if God want to do job who does he need to which finger does he use do you see who you are do you see who you are do you see who you are my brother we are not nobody we are somebody you are a god [Music] magician is stuck but Aaron did it if God is the only one that can create so Aaron is creating are we together stop looking at this man right here follow forget this man if time allow I'm going to show you not this man but another man but that man is still you that's the one I'm talking to this one don't understand my language now only that man understand my [Applause] language you don't understand my language but you understand my language the one who say am man is not you it is [Applause] you are we together are we together have I lost somebody have i l somebody if I L you you raise your hand my friend amen amen amen let's go to verse 19 my friend he says then the magician said to Pharaoh what this is the Finger of God this is the Finger of God and Pharaoh's heart was what was hardened he was hardened he was hardened and he hen not unto them as the Lord has what said listen to verse 5 20 and the Lord said to Moses do it rise up early in the morning and do it and stand before pharaoh and lo he shall come forth to the water and say to him th sayith the Lord let my people go that they may do What serve me else if you would not let the people go behold I will send swarm of flies we move from frogs to water Li and Li to what keep this three thing my friend you're going to see how the message of this message is powerful amen amen he said I'm going to send a swarm of flies upon you and upon your servant and upon your people and into your houses remember amen same GPS address and the house of the Egyptian shall be full of swarm of flies and also the grand whereon they are where can you find this type of fire where was this manufacturer verse 22 and I was sever in other words separate in that day the land of Goan in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of of the earth and I will put a division in other word a distinction between my people and your people tomorrow shall be the Son and the Lord did so how me and you don't know but he did it okay so far we don't know hallelujah amen but he did it and there came a gous SW of flies into the House of who pharaoh and into his servant's house and into all the land of what Egypt and the land was corrupted by reason of swarm of the swor of what now let's go back to verse 24 and the Lord did so and there came a what a Grievious SW he was not a regular flies this were Grievous it was another speech that was created manufactur can flies be Grievous but these were Grievous so these were not only n flies do you follow me so these flies were also created are we together are we together let's go to Exodus chapter 10 Lord help me if you there you can say Amen Exodus 10 verse2 you there amen and the Lord said to Moses stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the who the low priests we move from frogs created life created flies created do you see the magician coming back again do you see the magician again hallu do you see any magician there they learn that hey this is the Finger of God do you see anybody there do you see any more impersonation it's a different level Hallelujah so God never stop creating only one thing [Music] he created frog he created life and he created also flies now we are in a locust amen amen verse 12 and the Lord said to Moses stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the what the Locust that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that uh all that the hell has left and Moses stretched forth his road over the land of Egypt remember he's using his road but we will see what really happened amen and the Lord brought a nwing upon the land of that day I mean all that day and all that night and when it was morning yes the East Wind brought what the Locust so the wind is blowing all night in the morning Locust let's see jum to verse 14 and the locus went over all the land of Egypt and rested in all the coast of Egypt very what Grievious were they before them there were no such Locust in other words those Locust never existed they were how and they were created are you I'm reading the Bible with you before them there were no such Locust as they neither after them shall be what so it's a Spees that only happened for a frame of time are we together are we together so these Locust were also created by God the FL created by God the L created by God the Frog created by God and according to what we see it m stretch uh Aaron Smite the dust that's what we hearing so in our man we look in at boom boom let's go to Psalm 105 then we begin to swar I was reading the Bible my friend amen let's go to Psalm 105 we are very good on time and you're doing very good on your reading of the scripture you there Psalm 105 verse 26 if you there you can say amen he sent whoes Moses's servant and who whom he has what chosen we back in Egypt you there he showed his son among them and wonders in the land of H that's another name for Egypt he sent Darkness who sent God and made it dark and they Rebel not against his word he turned their water into blood and slew their what fish it's God doing that when you go to Egypt who was doing that no when you look in Egypt who was doing all of that you look it's Moses amen but it's God Amen it's God in Moses are we together and then uh verse uh 29 and he turned the water into blood and slew their fish their land did what brought forth frog stop when we look and in uh Exodus the Bible say the river will do what bring forth but right here it says the what the land brought forth because everything come from the dust everything come from the dust of the Earth the water cannot produce a creature God created frog from the dust of the earth it was the land that produced it amen and then they came up upon the water and they moved them up so the land of Egypt was producing the dust of Egypt was producing the land was producing now we clear so far the this is David anded the anointing now he's picking up amen the PM are from David prophetic the Bible says their land not their River brought for frogs in abundance in the chambers of their King you there verse 31 he spoke who spoke God and there came a sort of whates so the Flies were not coming up by this somebody spoke now you begin to understand you need sometime to go to two places in the Bible and to get the scripture or the story correctly if you read the book of the king you need to go to first king and you need to go to the chronicle and you get the king and the chronicle together then you will get more light in the scripture if you stop in the chronicle you will miss something in the Kings if you go to the king you will miss something in the chronicle that's why they call the chronicle the third and the fourth book of the Kings amen amen when we read in uh in Exodus it was like Moses was stretching but now David say it was God speaking amen and God was speaking through Moses so these things were created by the spoken word now we begin to go somewhere the Bible says amen verse 31 he spoke not he struck not he struck something the Bible didn't say God struck and last came up David said God spoke but God was not there who was there who was speaking God he spoke and there came David source of what FES in and what so lights watch here and flies came by the spoken word whatever you read in the book of Exodus you need to upgrade your computer now what you have was elementary now your computer need to be upgraded that truly what happened Moses spoke Moses was speaking and the FL came they spoke he was not stretching like this life and death in the power of the tongue when they say you are God God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with who God and the Word was God so God created everything by the word if Moses is a god Moses must create things by the are we together are we together that's why squirel were created by now we begin to go slowly my friend amen amen oh God we on 31 drop to verse 34 my friend we almost finished with our scripture you there amen verse 34 he did what spoke again and the what the loc watch right here and the what loc when we go over there it was like the stretch here spoken when he spoke the Locust came and what caterpillars you see they added something that was not over there so it was not just look it's also the caterpillar upgrade your computer my friend amen and the cillar and that with number where did they get a Lo and caterpillar with number it was God creating that's why brother Bram says this remember Moses did what called into creation the message and the Bible are perfectly in line together when brother Bram say something God you with him you don't take the written word to challenge the word made flesh I don't know if you understanding me I don't know if you understanding me you don't take the written word to challenge the word made flesh let me say it plainly you don't take the Bible to challenge the message you need to go to the message and the message will bring you back to the Bible [Applause] that's the biggest error the Pharisee did that's why Jesus said go search your scripture brother Bram say Moses spoke in Exodus they say he stretch his head who do you believe today you found out that brother Bram was right because brother Bram is a Vindicated prophet of God for this age the the Bible one if you don't understand something BR Bram say cheat out if you don't understand something shut up give God some time to bring another minister to bring things together to clarify things so you can really get [Applause] it a superficial understanding have caused a mess in the [Applause] message who are you to challenge a Vindicated Prophet amen amen who wrote the book of of uh of Genesis who wrote exoduses who wrote Leviticus who wrote Deuteronomy who wrote all those books there those four that I read and Moses was a prophet how do you challenge Moses under which authority when Moses wrote was Moses with Adam how can Moses tell us what the conversation between Eve and the [Applause] serpent do you follow me we got Adam all the way to Enoch Enoch to Noah and Noah the Earth was destroyed and from Noah came the people and from there came Abraham and from Abraham came Isaac from Isaac came Jacob from Jacob the patriarch and from there came Levi and L Moses under which authority Moses can you tell us what happened in the Garden of [Music] Eden why didn't Abraham give us that why didn't Abraham give us that but only Moses because God say with all the prophets I speak to them in vision and in dreams but with Moses I speak to [Applause] him and in this age we have a prophet like unto Moses with two sons that God spoke to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him until God was pleased to take a picture with [Applause] him can I shock you again can I shock you again God came down and touched somebody's shirt and left an imprint on it and brother Bram came with his hand born in Kentucky from Al and CH Bor born in sex he put his hand and he matches it that's why when the sword of the king hit his hand brother Bram say he fed his because he was the hand of [Applause] God this is not Elementary my friend we are in University amen we are in the Deep things of God you need to know who you are and whatever God does to your messenger that's why I accept He's My Messenger whatever he does to the messenger it's an example to what he's going to do with me that's why I follow brother BR because brother brother follow Jesus Christ and I know when I follow him I will become God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Church be happy to be in this message [Applause] but Glen I'm still on the top of the ASP I'm trying to jum down my friend amen amen amen Have I Lost somebody can you chew that steak I made it well done so that even a child can bite and swallow it okay okay okay if it's too hard just swallow it Hallelujah brother Bram say Moses did what called into creation that is what he pick up the Sun and throw up in the air and say let what fleas come and flee did what let what flies come and flies did what come let what frogs come do you see those kind of stuff and frog did what come he did what he brought into creation Now a man can cannot create but he was not man to begin with he was who Jehovah in what his Prophet am that's why brother I'm say the pillar of fire was in Moses I know this is hard to chew my friend how can Moses walk and his face begin to Even Shine are we together are we together are we together there's only one person that can create it's only God if you try to put it on the devil you make the devil coequal that's what brother brandham say let's look at the word coequal glory to God everybody okay if you fool you tell me I push the break because this maneral they have to sink slowly brother Bram say in the message show us the father you believe God is well here you believe God is well in his creation God is where in his word God is where in his son now God where in his [Applause] people are we together everything that God was was put where into Jesus Christ he was what called equal with the father is that [Applause] right everything that was in God was put in who Jesus and Jesus Christ was what with God glory to God brother Bram say is that right thinking not he give you scripture thinking not what robbery but he was what equal with the father in other words when Jesus say I am God Jesus doesn't think like ah I'm taking I'm taking too much upon myself he thought not robber he was not stealing something away from God he was that God that's why he say I am God so so the thinking of Jesus was not like God is different than him [Music] Hallelujah but when he speak to the people he said my father is greater than me and the people say come on where is that father and then he turned around he say ah you never understand all this time that when you see you see who father are we together are we together are we together look at this my friend look at this my friend the Bible say in Jeremiah 10:10 but the Lord is what the true God push the break my friend who's the true God the Lord the Lord is the true God brother let's Worship the Lord who is the true God the Lord Satan in the name of the Lord move out he'll be looking at you no Revelation superficial understanding superficial understanding Satan is looking at you he say who's the Lord who the Lord amen amen amen amen he says the Lord is the what true God he is what the Living God and an everlasting King stop first John 5:20 and we know that the who Son of God is come remember who the Son of God is because the the Jews tried to kill him they say ah the problem is not the Sabbath the problem is you call yourself the Son of God and we know what Son of God means I gave you the scripture last Sunday a Son of God means equal with God so the reason why we want to kill you is you a man making yourself so when man want to become God he trouble the devil [Applause] follow me carefully the Pharisees say for good work we Stone you what do you know what the good work the miracle for the miracle we love you come and pray for me come and pray for my daughter I'm going to give you a prayer request put that in your church so my grandma can get healed for good work we love you but when you brother John you calling yourself God Ah that's why I don't want to come to your church for prayer request I will give it to you but I don't want to come to your [Applause] church I don't know if you're getting me good work we want Miracle we want prophecy we want but a man becoming God come on man come on on man come on man what's wrong with you are you all right are you out of your mind what about Moses God say I make you god let's go my friend he says we know what do we know we know that the what Son of God is come even Pentecostal will say Amen and have given us what an understanding okay which understanding that we may know him that is what true we need to know who that is true and we are in him that is what so the Revelation is not just knowing who is the true God but it's know knowing also when you first know who is the true God the second step is to know that you also you are in that true God in other words you have you are part of the Commonwealth of that God you are part of that the inheritance of that God in other way you are part of that God you know your father and you know that you are part of your father not just knowing who is the father no I know who's my father ah I know who's my father this is my father one so I am part of him and Paul is saying here John is saying that God gave us the understanding to know first who is the true and now we know who is the true he said don't stop there do you see that true yes do you see that true you are let me go this way okay this is the truth okay okay this all here is the TRU amen if you stand here who is this if you stand here who is this if you stand here who's this if you stand here who's this if you stand here who's this if you look as an ey bird who is this true if you go under who is this but you are in [Applause] here I don't know if you're getting me if you stand here you look at this who is this you see you see you see you got quien you see you see how you got quien you see how you quieted now amen this is true if you look and this who is this true here who is this who is this who is this which part of this is true and which part of this is not true it's all true and God John is saying you were here [Music] so if you look at this who is this ouch ouch you have a problem Jesus say I am the truth I am the truth if you looking for the truth I am the truth and we were in [Applause] him so where is the true [Applause] God where is the true worshiper that will worship God in the spirit and in truth you must be in the truth [Applause] is this too strong we okay listen my friend he said you have given us what an understanding that we may know him that is what true we know him and we are in him that is what true if we are in the truth if you want to find me you need to find me where so if the message is the truth of the hour where do you need to find [Applause] me you need to find me in the message because the message is the truth of the hour I can't leave the [Applause] message wherever I'm going the message [Applause] [Music] I am the confirmation that this message is [Applause] true I know it's hard because God said I will send you elij the prophet so see elah the [Music] [Applause] prophet don't worry my friend you will catch some of them dead can I continue and we are in him that is what true even in the what his son Jesus Christ so where are we we are in who Jesus Christ this is the what the true God verify your Bible my friend so who is the true God now you can tell Satan in the name of Jesus because your Revelation is [Applause] different listen to me carefully listen to me carefully listen to me carefully if I have a servant and my servant I'm just picking up my friend is brother Angelo and I say brother Angelo go tell the the man over there to leave my property amen or go tell him go get my stuff over there brother Angelo goes as a servant amen he's hired he's going to go he say brother Steven say Amen give this thing it belongs to him amen amen if the servant give get some difficulty he can stop and say you know what I need to go back to the BS and go tell the boss but if I call my son and I tell my son you see what is there it is for us it belongs to us the son will understand that hey this is my property I said go get that thing belong to us my son won't behave like brother Angelo even though brother Angelo is my son I'm just picking up an example my son won't belong like he won't behave like brother Angelo my son will go with a different understanding what belongs to Daddy belongs to me so when my son speak his face is [Applause] different one speak with a revelation one thing speak as a super fish servant and that's the problem with the devil you can say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ and the way you saying that you are saying in the name of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ is a God and I'm getting authority to throw you you need to change that when you telling the devil you say in the name of Jesus understanding that me and Jesus we are one so whatever belong to Jesus belong to me [Applause] I don't know if you getting me I don't know if you catching me brother Angelo can stop and back up my son won't back up if the man say no my son will change his behavior he will say give it it's for my father give it give it it's for my daddy he can fight for it because of the level of revelation so what belongs to me when I put when I engage in a fight I don't let it go until Satan give me because it belongs to me and my father can I add something can I add something if my son knows that I'm doing that so he can show me that he's really courageous it get even more deadly because he want to prove his father if I don't bring this daddy will think I'm a coward so I need to do everything I can until I come back with fa and when he come back I say good boy that's how a man should beave so when you engage in the B don't go back make your father proud of you thank you let God testify to the devil and say do you see Shadrach do you see M do you see job what did I tell you look at him what did I tell you that boy knows how to fight my friend do you [Applause] see because when I sent you to him I knew who he was I knew he's not going to disappoint me are we together are we together Lord help me oh God he says and we are in him that is what true even the in his son Jesus Christ this is the what true God and what eternal life now we don't know just the Lord now we begin to understand that that Lord is Jesus Christ so the true God is Jesus Christ that's why we worship Jesus Christ as the only true God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus in the New Testament are we clear with that Revelation are we okay are you full that was Jesus Christ everybody say Amen now let's look at you are we together are we together if you fool you let me my friend know because I thought I'm going to preach this quickly and be out Amen in Hebrew last week on Sunday we saw that the Bible Paul say that Thou loveth righteous and hateth what iniquity and hateth iniquity therefore therefore God even thy God you remember it's like God talking to God therefore God even th we found out that those two gods are one are we together therefore God even th God has anointed thee with oil of greatness above th fellow stop therefore god with a capital G even th God we just found out that the father and the son they are one amen amen and they are one and it's one God here oh Israel the Lord your God is one God and Paul say God th God has anointed thee above th fellow fellow the fellow of who let's go with our terminology the fellow of who the fellow of God if these are fellow of God how are they is is that a problem are you a human is he a human you are a fellow human amen he's your fellow because he's a human like you but this God got fellows and another translation he got Brothers if he is God his brother must be from the same parent his brother are what [Music] I'm letting that sink on you do you see how you have a problem when I say this God all of you agree with me this God God fellows and they say they anointed this God above his fellow in other word he's a little bit higher he's the general the other one are captain or whatever or or or or Colonel or whatever they are but this God is Anointed above if this is a god this fellow are who they are God amen amen so this fellow and the one who is Anointed above him both of them are Gods am let's look at this my friend Lord help me brother Bram say in the God of this evil age he was talking about Isaiah 140 and Brother brandham begin to read the scripture of Isaiah 14 that's why I didn't put the scripture because he was taking that from the Bible and Isaiah 14:12 say how are thou fallen from Heaven oh who Lucifer you know Lucifer right Satan right son of the morning how are thou cast down to the what ground which did what weaken the nation for that said in th heart I will do what Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne stop so Satan had the [Music] throne are we together is it hard no if it's you tell me so I break it down amen amen amen Satan Lucifer has a throne amen amen he has a throne and I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt Maron above the what stars of God push the break and brother Bram said those stars of God are what sons of God let's go slowly According to Hebrew we found out that there is a fellow amen that is above his fellows can you see that clear let me make it bigger let me make it bigger there is a fellow he's above his fellow both of these material are [Applause] one amen Hallelujah this word and this word are one sir same quality my friend only different quantity any question I'm going this way so he soak deeper amen only different quantity this we find a fellow this fellow this fellows have their fellow and their fellow is Anointed a little bit above them amen amen and this fellow is God Amen and his fellow are what let me use your terminology Gods with littley you love it so much these fellow are Gods the way you want it that's the way you want it now that's the way you want when I say that you say yeah amen that's the way you want these

by Amnesia because we bypass at the and we don't know really who we we are and Satan take advantage of our ignorance to walk on us hallelujah and now God send a message to tell you who you [Applause]

the end and so in the beginning Satan knew that he's under the sons of God and he want to be over the sons of God that's why he want to exalt his throne of the who son of to move from here Satan was here Satan want to move and come over here when he come over here he reach the position of the big fellow are we together I'm going to exalt above the star of what God and I will sit upon the what the

there is somebody there that need to so that this pyramid is coming when he comes we will turn from this into this and when this is our God we are ready for the Millennium to r a thousand year like Adam because Adam never exercise his godship for one day which is a thousand year with the Lord now God is restoring the Brad to reach that position so that we can go in the Millennium and exercise a thousand year one day where Adam fell we going to stand there and when we stand there do you know what will happen to the devil in the Millennium he will be bound and brother Bram say that bound doesn't mean that they take feed and they put on the devil because the Devil is a spirit brother said the reason why he's bound is there is no other fellow in other word in the Millennium me and you will be talking and the devil is coming and nobody pay attention attention to just like we were in [Music] heaven when I see the devil in the Millennium he will be walking right here and I say brother Benjamin oh good to see you for a thousand Year my friend oh do you know how we were in the world do you know how we suffer and the devil is here you said did you see who pass here don't mind him he

my oh my glory to God I am 40% of that sermon so we got 60 left you pray for me my friend amen go chew on this Revelation sit down and Ponder on this revelation realize who you are stop crying the devil is not in control of your life the problem is the timing you want things to be done a certain time and it's not done yet and you think God is uh is forsaking you no we gave the devil too much power ask him everybody this one is leaving the message why are you not leaving the message why is not good why are his argument no strong enough to convince you and sometime you look at one knock people off the message you laugh really you say you are not even a message you are Jehovah Witness in the message why do you want to remove me from here because I know that the day I realize who I am you don't like that go to the Pentecost over there they pray for the sick over there they do this ask the Pentecost do you know you are God and watch their face go look at the word amateur God ask the Pentecost do you know what AM God me let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father this even this afternoon thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy for the understanding of the spirit for the brde to realize who we are and our very purpose here on Earth yes Father that this Revelation releases tension away from us worries goes away Spirit are driven Away by themsel because Lord father we realize that we are in the hand of the good master and if with a finger you can do this how much more when the Brad is completely blended with you and the head is united with the body Lord may you take these words that were spoken here and there and may the Holy Spirit continue to work and to unfold this word more and more Lord to your children until this become not a knowing but a life and a revelation for this church and the bride all over the world Lord whoever will come in contact with this father granted unto them touch those that have struggle in their body and those that needed answer in their situation may you provide for that answer we humbly ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen ready where up Hallelujah amen amen glory to
