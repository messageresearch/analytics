somewhere and someone came on the back with a motorcycle and hit him from the back and ran away and he fell down he lost his mind he took him to the hospital and the check the check everywhere the chest and everything is in pain but this everything is good i just thank god the devil tried to kill him last year with cancer the devil keep trying to to kill my dad but god is there watching over him i thank god for that [Applause] amen yes sir brother we received notice that brother blue was in a real bad car accident he hit a tree the airbags deployed the car was totaled and he came out

had you know a little bout of whatever but my sister she works in the hospital so now she they her test saying that she has kovid but they're doing good and i'm just want to give god thanks and just keep them in prayer that i believe that the same blood that is shed for me will will protect my family amen hallelujah anybody else [Applause] amen i've been kind of discouraged at work a little bit you know i'm doing a lot more physical labor i try to take an opportunity and left a job back in january or december not really chasing money but just trying something different and it didn't work so i landed where i am last week and i got on linkedin i kind of that's my only i guess you won't call it social media but it's and i noticed that my old company the one that i left in january there they were hiring for a customer service rep which is what i left so i texted my old boss and i said am i am i eligible to apply for this he told me when i left you know and he said absolutely so i went over and talked to him thursday and they hired me so i'm in my last week at the physical labor camp and then i'll be uh and i'm not listen i don't know who watches these so i'm not dogging him the man gave me a job when i need it and i've talked to him and i've told him i appreciate it you know i did my best it's you know you know i mean i work pretty hard but um if if i can go back i'm going back i told him that i said i don't know how fast they're going to move but i might not work this whole week you know but god is good that's part of what you know part of what i was going through my mind when brother stephen was talking about justification and just how good god is and how amazing his love is you know because you know sometimes you walk away from things that maybe you shouldn't and that may be been the case but you know i thought i could do some good at another company and it just didn't work out so praise the lord i'm happy i'm happy that and i told him i'm gonna do my best there i got one prayer request up here does anybody else have another one out there yes sir okay all right everybody hear that brother um enoch's family is coming back from virginia did you have something brother same amen amen well that's why it's on recording too we can always go back and listen to it 15 times if we need it yes yes that's exactly right a different dimension right we need to go into the faster one amen praise god it's good too it is so we are so special in god's eyes to be receiving what we are amen that's the truth amen amen so brother michael um he says god bless you

head your hand went up quickest hallelujah everybody happy this morning is everybody happy you're in the presence of our king hallelujah thank you jesus good morning everyone god bless you all this song has been in my heart and the way the lord keeps moving us and um as bruce stephen is being inspired from one level to the next it's just so much coming out you know but um speaking about origin and how everything originated and abraham's seed was shown in the stars this song just came back to me i pray i can be a blessing to you the heavens declare the glory of god [Music] day on today authorities be [Music] night on tonight it showeth knowledge [Music] for they are all in god's perfect peace for tell me what will happen if the moon should leave her place then the face of the earth would be a dark and chaos again so what about the earthly hosts who are made in the image of god if we are not in order how can we do the works of god yet once more lord shake not the heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place but there are some who stayed the pleiades and orion in every age we kept the first estate and though the power of heaven are shaken we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved or that can be shaken will be shaken let thy word lord shake us into place [Music] the world is again falling apart soon the millennium will [Applause] but first this kingdom will be in you spiritually before it comes in the earth literally but in the days of the ten toes came a rock struck without hands despite every image in our earth made by man i know you're not the kingdom of the lord is in you for the stone did not only strike but grew into a mountain too yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place [Applause] but there are some who stirred the pleiades and orion in every age who kept their first estate and though the powers of heaven are shaken we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved all that can be shaken will be shaken but let your word lord shake us into place [Music] we were like dry bones down in the valley then the son of man came with a prophecy and out of his mouth came seven thundering voices [Applause] to quicken and bring to life this scattered body then came a noise and a shaking as each bone came to its bone sinew and flesh skin came upon it but it had no life of its own but then he prophesied again the dynamic came into this body so today we can stand upon as a mighty marching army yet once more lord [Music] shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of places but we are those who stood the pleiades and orion in this last day we've kept our first estate and though the power of heaven are shaken we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved all that can be shaken will be shaken let thy word lord shake us into place though the powers of heaven are shaking we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved or that can be shaken will be shaken but let thy word lord shake us into play let thy word lord shake us into play peace let thy word lord shake [Music] shake us lord into place hallelujah you know i got a text early this week that brother ben and sister um devine were going to sing this morning and i forgot about it until just now i looked over there y'all come up i'm brother enoch i'm sorry we're gonna have to just wait a week or till after the service praise the lord [Applause] where's the other bazooka who angelo cool okay i don't know how we're gonna do it [Music] yeah okay hey let me give a quick announcement we're

next song that the group's gonna practice hopefully is in french it's a french song i'll put it out there but um like i say let's welcome our pastor out this morning with a seat everybody ready got your bibs on the big fork you know it's gonna be a lot on the plate amen oh leavingly [Music] believe all things are possible all the [Music] oh all things are high [Music] lord and i believe [Music] all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe amen i believe all things are possible lord i believe one more time jesus is here jesus [Music] jesus [Music] all things are possible lord jesus [Music] jesus jesus [Music] amen you believe that this morning let's give the lord a clap offering hallelujah you might be seated a few minutes i believe all that were in traffic already free hopefully amen hard to say it but i'm going to say it if church is at 11 o'clock you need to leave a little bit early and you will give yourself a buffer if something happened on the traffic you can play with your buffer in other words it won't hurt you if you 20 minutes early can you say amen if you're 20 minutes early that's fine you get into the church if brother david would or if it's the leadership of the holy spirit we can play a tape here you can get in here and sit with the atmosphere of the holy spirit while the tape is playing 20 minutes you get prepared is good but if you always live right straight and 45 minutes or 40 minutes or 30 minutes and you're living right straight if something happened on the highway you doom to be behind except if you have a legitimate reason amen amen [Laughter] oh my god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord anyway i won't stop because i know how i've been fighting with the devil left and right but he's not going to win amen how many are still reading their cod one question every day you need a back you need to get back in line amen you need to get back in line we spend some money to invest in your spiritual soul make sure you use it you might wonder where we're getting our information we don't have any special place where we're getting our information the preacher the deacon the trustees the laity everybody we go into the same source either it's coming from the bible or it's coming from the message so make sure you read the message for yourself and i will strongly encourage the young people take note you will need it one day amen take note you're going to need it one day you don't know if the lord is going to use you to witness to somebody and if you don't have your scripture put up together you won't know how to introduce the message to somebody because you'll be like i remember brother stephen saying that and you don't know so my encouragement if we're teaching something we're preaching something here you take those scriptures and put them together you say this is water baptism this is the scripture these are the scriptures here this is we talked about women now wearing paint these are description we're talking about this so you can keep that in your bible handy if you're talking to somebody you know you say open here open there open here up and there then they say where did you go to school no it was malachi for schooling amen blessed be the name of the lord we have a meeting yesterday with the team host leader yesterday and it was a wonderful meeting by god's grace we iron up almost everything so you give us some grace maybe couple weeks we will go ahead and explain it to the church in detail how after this last meeting that is coming up how are we going to start proceeding with a meeting i send a text specifically saying team leader or anybody else who feel like they want to help so if you were not part of the previous team leader that doesn't mean that you cannot be a whole story team leader anybody in this church can be a team leader any sister if you wanted to but if you want to be a team leader you got to be here on time you got to commit it you got to do what we ask you to do because we're going to depend on you to make sure everything is running smooth everybody clears so far so you give us a couple weeks we're going to put everything together and present it to you this is the way things are going to be running amen in a hotel there was a special grace in the house of uh obedience amen if you were not yesterday you know you won't understand what we're saying by obedience so god gives some time grace until things are put up but we can continue with that grace over we gotta move into a different step of grace in other words things have to begin to get in order later by a little little bit later you must feel like i'm speaking a strange language but if god give me grace when i will get into that justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost you can see how you can be in the message but you're under denomination but you are in a message okay no problem it is coming you're going to see how you are in the message church for years but you're under a denomination and you're already trapped in a prison and you think you're a message believer and you're not progressing you must be able to stand at home sometime quiet and look at your life where you come from and then look where you are and make sure you can see a difference from last year to where you are if there is no difference it's telling you something is wrong if you keep worshiping god the same way you were worshiping god one year passed something is not correct you must be going from height to height from height to height religion is something that leaves you in one state and keep warming you like a microwave amen so if you're in step one 20 years you're still in step one you just go to church go back up go to church go back up and nothing changes that is religion the message is not a religion the message is a life it's christ himself amen so make sure sometimes you stay at home and you watch your life and you say five years what was i doing am i keep doing the same thing if you keep doing the same thing something is wrong don't fool yourself something is wrong thank you musician something is wrong amen so lord willing we put up everything together and send to you our i mean presented to the church and probably we might have to present it again in one of the meeting when we're here just to rehearse and make sure everything is running smoothly amen and do me a favor i know you super busy you more busy than your pastor i know that but when we send the text from the church and we need response if you are gonna be there or if you are not going to be there please respond say no brother i won't make it oh yes i can make it so we have a head count and we know what we're doing amen it won't help if you're looking at the text because that's a lot of habits that we have we're looking at the text and we just don't respond i'm not going to be there i'm not going to respond and sometimes you don't respond and you show up so now we're confused so it just it takes less than maybe five seconds when we send the text and the text say please respond please respond amen don glenn said the text there is a difference between reading the text and glancing glancing did you see the text yes i saw the text and then you ask a question and the question that you asked was already given in the text it is telling me you didn't read the text you glanced at the text read the text and if they say respond just respond and say i cannot make it or i will make it or i'm a little bit tight lord's willing i'll try my best to be there amen we have people on the front hook up yesterday they were not here but at least they were on the front hook up in the meeting amen so if you can't make it there are many ways you can do it but at least respond so we know what we are doing if we need some people to work at the church respond and say i can make it or i cannot make it everybody clear on that one make the deacon job so easy amen don't worry i'm gonna get that devil not you i'm gonna get that devil out amen another thing if you would when we bring the children in the sanctuary make sure the kids don't have any pain or any sharpies we don't want any riding on the chair these are the church furniture we will need to keep it cherish it and make sure everything is good we already saw a mark of a pen on a chair so make sure if your children are coming watch them no sharpie no crayons or no marker whatever you call it don't bring it inside the church if they have it you must make sure you oversee them so we don't end up having to find a new chair or something like that amen so just want to remind you you're taking your children to the nursery the nursery is not a playground the nurse is for you to change your baby you finish changing if there is nothing else to do you get back again in the church amen we don't want those all the habits and pull them up here where we get to the kid leave them there and they begin to run there like a playground the church is not a playground we're coming to get the word of god when we finish we go back up amen so we need your participation in what we're doing in the church we're here to serve god's people amen whatever we do is to serve god's people be part of it and it's going to help amen if we're starting the meeting for the young people for question and answer and the meetings start at three try the best if you can to be here before three amen especially the young people we cannot start a meeting at three o'clock and everybody shows up at five o'clock when everything is set they already lay everything on the table you come late you eat and you leave early that is not good amen brother branham say it's like a pig who sits under the tree who always eats the apple but never stop back to stop and to think where are the apple coming back amen in other words you're eating food but you never stop and say who prepared this food who set up this table what can i do to also help the next time what can i do to clean up i came there is a tent that is already put there who put up this tent who was here placing the chairs have that mentality of always serving eternal life brother branham he says what living for others amen so make sure your life is also living for others we cannot have 20 meetings and you never show up on one of them or when you show up you late you get in church get the word get out get in the car out can't even shake somebody's hand you're going to see me in heaven for eternity i don't know how are you going to run away amen at least stop shake somebody's hand you say sister lorell it has been a long time i have not seen you everything is okay now is the family the family good god bless you then you can move on and get in your car and go at least you made a difference for one sister amen everybody clear like it or not here i come let's stand and go to the word i already decided one thing i'm not gonna have your blood in my hand that is clear and that's the way it works brother david it looks like we're going through the same headache so we probably bring it back here and we figure it out what to do you say it's 100 feet but it's still playing up amen so be patient with us i'm going to give you the scripture let's go to genesis chapter 19. have a mentality of serving that's a good mentality of serving and of sacrifice if everybody come late we won't have church somebody must be here earlier to make sure the light is turned on the air conditioning is good and everything so if you always come when the air conditioning is already set up that's not good make sure one day you also you come and say brother robert how can we turn that air conditioning on amen if brother mike i really need to travel how can i turn that instrument on when brother mike daley is not there if brother kelly is not there how can i play the drama amen so we have replacement like that on wednesday brother caleb had to leave the song if he was not there amen he's going to move brother robert up to here then it's a different story i believe he was brother david who was playing the drum right if brother david was not there always have a mentality of serving amen we are a family always have a mentality of serving there is no spot here that are hauled by somebody definitely except the pastor until then everybody even the trustees and the deacon at the end of the year all the offices expires then on january we got to bring them up again and ask you do you want to continue with them or not amen so anybody can serve god in this church so no more saying i thought it sister so and so who always take care of the this this this no did you ask a question or did you assume based on the old tradition if you feel a burden ask a question brother robert how can i help brother stephen can i do this if you want to learn an instrument i'm going to send you to brother john porter but john porter will guide you how to go ahead and get an instrument and start preparing yourself and everything and here we got it amen but don't stay assumed that oh no maybe in that church me i'm just a believer coming sitting and listening to the word and i'm out it's a family you don't see a sister two three times pick up a phone call call you say sister miriam brother mickey where are you at it has been two weeks i have not seen you in the church it makes a big difference amen blessed be the name of the lord genesis chapter 19 verse 24. lord help your children consecrate yeah help your children consecrate it's a weekend you doing a lot of stuff you're going through a lot of places create a habit of way whenever you're going on the weekend keep praying in your heart consecrating yourself it's gonna help you in church when you're in the car you keep praying you say lord help me we're coming on sunday may you speak to me may you speak to my family may you help brother stephen may you help the song leader do that all the time on wednesday you start praying like that you start praying like that when you get here you won't be heavy amen but if you were out in a different environment you get here it's like your battery is low and you got to be recharged you're driving your car it takes 20 minutes you can pray 20 minutes you're working instead of chatting chatting chatting you can sit quiet working and in your heart father consecrate me consecrate my child before you know it you're gonna get here when we start singing you're already in the spirit amen not five minutes before church then you start praying battery law genesis chapter 19. then the lord reign upon sodom and upon gomorrah what brimstone you might be seated [Music] then the lord reigned upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and the first word is brimstone and the second one is fire who ran it amen lord help me deliver this cargo brimstone and fire everybody clear from who from who so this brimstone and this fire comes from god everybody clear you need to be very center to get it from the lord out of heaven verse 25 and he offered through those cities if you already read genesis 19 you know it is sodom and gomorrah day and the cities that are around and he overthrew those cities and all the plane and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon though in other words the grass the people the city their houses everything was destroyed and wiped completely by brimstone and let's go to luke chapter 16. hallelujah thank you my brother hallelujah luke chapter 16 if you're there you can say amen verse 22 hallelujah we read this like two or twice or three times but we need to dig into this a lot so it's gonna help your justification open up a different level of stuff it's amazing if you see that hallelujah verse 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died you already know that story right the reaching young ruler that's why i skipped the other one and it came to pass that the beggar died and he was carried by angel into the bosoms of into abraham's bosom you know what it is it was in paradise the rich man also did water and he was the rich man died we know what kind of death that is and he was water what do they bury in the cemetery so the body of the rich man was in the cemetery or in the grave anybody was the rich man in the grave when you preach this message it's a different sound was the rich man in the grave he was not there right so in the cemetery do we have people there why are you afraid of him you see now you see now you see now why are you afraid there because that person is not there [Laughter] i'm preaching the message [Laughter] why are you afraid am i waking you up are you ready enough thank you is my bible different than yours okay now let's see where this huge young ruler is verse 23 and in water so if somebody say i was in a cemetery i saw the rich young ruler will you believe him again so why do people say they go to cemetery to do stuff and they talk to spirit why sorry we're going to take the loose further out hallelujah and in water in hell this body was on earth but the soul slash the spirit was way inhale everybody clear okay let me drop this when the witch of endor wanted to bring the spirit of samuel did she go to the grave of samuel [Music] did he help you now did he help you amen hello help us amen and in hell he lift up his eyes being in water inhale it's torment number one inhale it's torment torment if you can give me grace we'll get into it and sees abraham a pharaoh and lazarus in his bosom because abraham is the father of all that's why the jews say we got abraham for our father you remember in john chapter 8 right and he cry and say father abraham have mercy on me he can talk not at the cemetery in hell and said lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water do we have water in hell water where are you going pastor tip of his finger in water and cool my water so out of this entire soul not body because the body is in the earth out of all the soul the only place that the rich young ruler is more concerned in hell is water are you awake it's water why not concern about the the arm burning oh my arm is burning so much put water here but the rich young ruler in hell was worrying about one place to be refreshed and that place is water [Music] be careful with your tongue [Music] be careful with the tongue the organ that is causing trouble in hell be careful with your amen and cool my tongue for i am burning in this flame let me start it again somebody is still not awake father help your children and cool my tongue for i am burning in this flame few people are waking up let me start it again if i have to take five services i'm going to take five services because you're not connecting you need to stay prayed up at home and cool my tongue for i am burning in this flame in the water so the flame is burning or is he tormenting [Music] i'm in flame but the flame are doing water tormenting he didn't say the flame are burning me amen but abraham said son remember that you in your lifetime receive your good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and you are water oh i thought he was burning they are tormenting what the body they are tormenting though let me help you up again are they tormenting the body are these flames attacking the body the flame are attacking water are we okay now if i don't go this hard you're going to miss when i'm flying amen 26 and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf so that there which would pass from here to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from there in other words no crossing no communication the bridge has been broken on 85 then he said i pray you therefore father that you would send him to my father house for i have five brethren that he may do what or warn them lest they also come into this place of burning so hell is a place of water and the rich young ruler when he was in hell did he wish that anybody else come to meet him why torment 29 abraham said to him they have ander the law and the prophet the word of god is there and the prophet let them hear them and he said nay father abraham when this man was leaving did he ever seen abraham how did he recognize that was abraham [Music] there is a recognition of abraham even though he was not there when peter john and james was on the man transfiguration when the cloud came peter look he said that's elijah and that's moses was peter in the time of elijah moses did they have a picture of moses did they have a dvd player that they recorded moses where did peter see moses how did peter recognize moses and elijah hallelujah and he said no father abraham but if one went to them from the dead like jesus resurrected they will repent and he said to him if they hear not moses and the prophet neither will there be water you can say all you want though one rose from there did one rose from the dead yes jesus rose from the dead how many are persuaded origin origin now let's go to revelation chapter 13 chapter 14. genesis 19 brimstone fire into which city sodom and gomorrah and the city that i round about anybody clear the rich young ruler his body was in the grave on the earth in the cemetery his soul and spirit in hell we go in the cemetery we are afraid like those people are sitting there they're going to tell you don't sit on my tomb [Laughter] revelation chapter 19. if i say something wrong you come and tell me because i was reading the bible uh 14 i'm sorry revelation chapter 14 if you're there you can say amen i believe we already dealt with these three angels you remember there was one that flew with everlasting gospel then there was a second one and there was the third one you know those angels i already preached about it who was the first one and the second one and the third one if you have any question you need to go back and listen to the series because we already explained it we're building on things that were already placed there amen verse nine the third angel which is brother branham and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand we already explain you this the mark on the forehead knowledge understand our knowledge and in the hand your works you can go back to the ceiling the same shall drink off the wine of water remember he's a lion of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation his anger and he shall be everybody clear he shall be water he shall be tormented he shall be tormented tormented tormented like in hell he shall be tormented with water and water he shall be tormented with water everybody on the board and water this happened in genesis 19 now it's going to happen again right will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the the elect angels you got it now you remember that elect angel from in the presence of the holy the angel that did not fall with lucifer because there were two categories of angels some were coming out of god the other one came out from the lineage of lucifer the holy angel and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of the i thought the smoke of the fire so torment got smoke torment got smoke so torment got smoke not only fire and the tomb and the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever and they have no rest day no night who worship the beast and his image that's why the voice say come on from among them amen and whosoever received the mark of his name here is the patient of the that's a different category now here are dead that keep the commandment of who and the faith of who these are the saints and i heard a voice from heaven saying to me right blessed are the dead which die in though from here after yes says the spirit that they may rest from their labor and their works do follow let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father as a shepherd as a spiritual father i am standing like job lord when he was pleading for his children father when his children were out fellowshipping and having a feast job had a sacrifice for his children lest per adventure some of them sin and father i'm standing here if any that is here have done something that grieved you or spoken something that you were not pleased with or didn't consecrate the way that they are supposed to be oh we're caught up into a lot of talking a lot of frenzy a lot of stuff that took them away from the channel father as his father i'm pleading that you forgive us all may you come down this morning lord and lord father look to us through the blood of the lamb may you speak to us in a powerful way again this morning may you move me completely out of the way may you seal the devil in every single lord the demonic power of the work of darkness and may only the holy spirit and the holy the elected angel lord be in this place lord blessing and delivering your children we ask it and commit everything unto the hand may you be the alpha and the omega and speak to our soul father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you are already seated amen i'm going to read something here just to refresh you we have many keys that we have been used a lot in the scripture amen the first key that i gave you i gave you a scripture a quote where brother branham said god cannot give a first revelation then add another one amen when god gives a revelation he's going to continue with that same revelation but god can add more information to that revelation to help you get that revelation and understand it better you need those keys to understand the message and to also understand the scripture i also gave you a key where brother branham said that every scripture and every prophecy has a compound meaning so he can go one direction on another one depending on the scripture that's why a pastor can take a scripture and preach and an evangelist can come and take that same scripture and preach and then a teacher come and take that same scripture and preach and you're gonna see like every one of them keep coming with something new it is because there is a flexibility that goes with the scripture amen and i'm going to remind you on this key again because we need it today brother branham said that the bible is written in water in mysteries amen and jesus thanked the father for it see that he was wrote in mysteries in symbols amen but when you see when but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of god the whole world is wrote in water if you don't look through the eyes of the revelation of god you might end up with a conclusion that the bible is contradicting itself and you can end up with the same thing like brother branham say one thing here and brother one i'm saying another thing here and it seems to be like it's a contradiction when it's not the problem is you need to get under the spirit of god and once you are in the spirit of god then you're going to see that everything is dove telling from genesis all the way to the revelation brother brother say the whole world is wrote in mystery and only the knowledge of god can reveal it then when you get and say punctuate every word of god with an amen then add that to your faith in the church ages brother branham say but a mystery if the word of god is written in mysteries if the whole bible is written in mysteries what about them say a mystery require the preaching of the spirit [Music] anybody clear i hope you're still awake a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or he never become water so if we stay under preaching preaching preaching preaching we can keep moving forward but a lot of questions will continue to be in the life of the people and you will never resolve them and as long as those questions are there you're going to be confused because you don't know what you're shooting for amen a mystery require the teaching of the spirit not the teaching of a man but the teaching of the spirit or in never become clear how we need to hear from the pastor how we need to hear from who from god and lay yourself open and become yielded to the spirit to heal and to water you gotta know because my people perish for lack of water everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say again this one here now we're climbing pretty good hallelujah brother branham said we realized that reading the bible you do not read it like you would the newspaper because it's been the wisdom of the holy spirit to hide water many things that's why the bible is written in mysteries god want to hide certain things to certain people and that certain people is the children of the devil god will reveal his word only to his children so it depends on the origin that you come from then god can either block his word or unfold his word to you because it's been the wisdom of the holy ghost the holy spirit to hide many things from the eyes of the water and prudent and would reveal it to her such as woodwater how can you learn if somebody doesn't teach you god wants somebody who is water so he can just take them over to one side and sit them down and say here it is why is god not showing you things why is god not talking to you why is god not giving you even a dream why is the holy spirit not talking to you you must check your appetite you must check your spiritual anger you must check what you like the most because where your treasure is that's where your heart is going to be if we call people in church look how you react with going to church everybody so far when they say going to work how do you react going to work you can even take a tylenol to make sure you make it work going to work you're gonna do everything you must do in order to be at work on time if you gotta wake up on time you gotta go to sleep early on the bed but when it comes to go to church how do you react god will not bring you his revelation if you lazy god will not speak to you if you are not interested to him god will not speak to you if you only interested in everything else and the last thing you have to think is about the things of god hallelujah he said he's gonna take them over to one side and sit them down and say here it is child of man this is it the world don't understand this but you shall understand let it be this way then all scripture given by water then it must be interpreted by water then scripture must compare with water the bible is written in water if you want god to unfold his word to you you need to begin to get closer to god everybody clear so far now we found out when we started here that last sunday that the devil sinned and the devil his angel his theophany his men all of them were put into hell ever here so those that were precipitated down into hell which was a prison we found out that we have four categories there the devil is the king of hell that was the first person the king which was satan himself was precipitated into hell the second one are the children of satan which are the tears or the wrong seed amen the third one are the angelic beings everybody clear which we call the demons everybody clear and the fourth one we have what we call the theophanies because these three categories here we found them that they fall under the word angel so when we say angel it's theophany angel is angelic being angel is also the children of whom satan ever clear so far now when we spoke about god we say that god was the bride and the morning star when we spoke about the children of god the children of god where the morning stars everybody here when we talk about the devil the devil was the son of the morning you remember that but when we talk about children or men children of satan they also have a name in the book of jude the bible says this in verse 12 that these men that we spoke about the children of satan these are water these children of satan called the tears called the men the bible said their water spots what are you trying to say the bible says that the bride will be without water [Music] anybody clear the bride of jesus christ will be without water there won't be any child of the devil inside the bride of jesus christ [Music] so far jesus put in your feast of water so when the children of god live in love when the church is going in love when everybody in the church is under the feast of love the spot or a child of the devil will be always there to disrupt that order these are spot in your feast of water when they're feast with you because they're a crow the crow can eat the same thing the dove is eating they it's a much multitude everybody when they're feast with you feeding themselves without water in other words they are sitting with you but they are feeding without respect they are not afraid of anything they are not afraid of the presence of god they are not afraid of the authority and the working of the holy spirit they can go outside sleep with a man and come to church and sit down they can go outside sleep with a woman come to church and take the lord's supper because their origin is an origin from the devil anybody here there are clouds that are without water usually when you see clouds gathering up what are you expecting rain it is the brother or the sister that you think you can get a rain out of him but when you get there there is no rain you say i'm gonna call him i'm gonna talk to him i feel depressed when you talk to him he's filled with politics there is no rain there is no word that you can receive from them to encourage you every time you talk to them the outside on certain things they are uncomfortable there is no rain yet the crowd they look like a brother they look like a sister but there is no rain here carry out of every water brother branham said wind in the scriptures speak about truth so anytime there is a problem in the church you're going to see them in the problem you talk to them they are filled with people's problem they know about this one they know about this one they know about this one they know about this one the last thing they can talk to you is about the word of god everybody here trees whose fruit are water you cannot eat that without fruit twice dead naturally and spiritually plucked up by the water there is no life into them raging waves of the water forming out their own water and they are wandering water so these children are wandering stars we have the bright and morning stars we have the morning stars we have the sun of the morning and now we have wandering stars why are they wondering because they once had a position because they was have a mistake but they lost their position they lost their god-given position in heaven and when they lost their position then they become wandering stars ever here when you lose your position in christ you're gonna live a wide life of going left and right because you lost your given position you don't have any position anymore you became a problem causing traffic on the highway to whom is reserve the blackness of darkness for water so now this hell here we told you that here is a prison it is a place where god took them put them into a prison then god would judge them at the white throne judgment and after the judgment is finished then god is going to destroy them everybody clear so far now this prison here is divided in three parts stay awake put your back a seat brother bonham say now when the first the first place on this side is the soul of the water when a man dies he goes into a place waiting for water so when someone a son of perdition comes from hell get into his mother's womb when he's born the day you die like the witch young ruler ever here you're gonna go down to hell but when you get down to her you're gonna stop right here at the first compartment of hell this compartment of hell here is called the fifth dimension it is a dimension that holds the souls the souls of the unjust all the children of the devil anybody clear so far if you're a child of god you're not going to go there anybody clear if you have uh time god listen to souls in prison it's a bottomless pit where brother branham job and brother branham saw people there and before you know it because brother branham did not belong there they only told him to go there okay let me drop this when brother if brother branham when brother branham received the holy ghost brother branham could no longer go down to hell everybody brother branham went to hell when he was sinner so god allowed him to go there so that he can have a vision when he's still in sin automatically if you pass to death you're going to go down to the region of the lust so when he have the vision god retrieve him back again and got him the holy ghost never to go back there again a man or a woman that is filled with the holy spirit will never go to hell because jesus died for you and jesus went to hell for you everybody so far so when a sinner die they go straight to hell they go first into that compartment that's why you see the star the wandering star stop there so here have division everybody clear brother branham said the next is the water is the demon which are the angelic being that resisted god as well they stay here everybody clear so far brother bonham said that the next is water is the devil himself so when you enter hell the first place you enter it is the soul of the unjust that's why when brother branham entered he didn't see the devil he said that's why when brother upon him entered he didn't see demons brother branham saw the souls and the spirit of the people that died under sin ever here but if you go further down then you get into the realm of the demon and if you go way down there then you're gonna see satan himself that is a copy of heaven everybody here when you're going down you're going into the fifth dimension then the region of the angel then the devil himself but when you're going up you're going in the sixth dimension then the holy angel brother branham said on the seventh it is god himself everybody here so far do you still have your seat belt everybody clear so far and in heaven the bible says that our theophany behold what the face of the father and the theophany of the people in hell will also behold the face of lucifer who is their father we okay so far did i lose anybody the first now damning there is ghost spirit of dead man that never did what they are waiting for water the only thing they know is water and what they did they are staying right here the demon are right there the devil is there so when you die your tea off and you will leave right here ever here and come straight to the hospital and pick you up and jump with you back to hell and if you're a christian your tea off and you also come down and wait for you on the hospital there and pick you up and pick your problem and pull you back up depending on your origin everybody here so far hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord this hell that we're talking about that is divided into three parts it's a horrible place very horrible a horrible place anybody care hell is horrible what is going on the bible says in ii peter chapter 2 verse 4 for if god spare not the angels that sin now you understand those angels but cast them down to water and deliver them into chains of water so in hell we have the chance of darkness hell have chance of darkness everybody clear who is in hell the angel the angelic being the tiopani can you put a chain on angel can you put a chain on a tiophone can you put a chain on the soul can you put a chain on the spirit can you catch the devil and put a chain and say call the police now we got him if he was so the devil could be in prison in a long time ever here the devil is a spirit but the bible says when god put them in hell he put them in chains the chance of what of darkness what kind of chain is that the bible continue reserve for water that's why hell is a prison they dare reserve for trial and spare not the odd word but save noah the earth person and preacher of righteousness bringing the flood upon the world of the water so you know who went to hell the ungodly notice that in ii peter peter stopped by the angel that sin reserved to darkness then peter pick up water sodom and gomorrah i want you to notice that peter started by speaking about the angel that fell hell then sodom and gomorrah right about keep that order the angel that sin the ungodly people then hell chance of darkness then sodom and gomorrah and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into water condemning them with another troll making them a water unto those that after should leave water so what happened to sodom and gomorrah is a preview it's a type it's an example of god of what god is gonna do at the end you understand you go back to the book of jude jude says this we were here the angel which kept not the first state you remember that but left their own water he had reserved into everlasting water peter called that the chance of darkness but jude called that the everlasting chance in other words you put them together everlasting chain of darkness everybody everlasting chain of darkness unto what you see that unto the judgment of the great day so peter started by angel that sin put them in hell unto judgment and then sodom have gomorrah jude started with the angel that sin put them into chains everlasting chain then look at verse seven he picked up water why are these two people putting the same thing everybody here hallelujah put a you'd say even as sodom and gomorrah remember we start with sodom and gomorrah in 19 out sodom and gomorrah and the cities above them in like manner giving themselves over to water and going after water which means homosexuality ever care are set forth as a water so who is gonna be destroyed into the lake of fire ungodly people those that live in fornication set your relationship before marriages those that are homosexual set for in the water suffering the water the vengeance of water so jude is saying what happened in sodom and gomorrah because jude first started with israel leaving egypt then he left that and he went back to the origin and said look where they started from they start from heaven now not only did they start from heaven and they lost their position but they're gonna be destroyed because what happened in sodom in gomorrah and the cities around the back is an example of what god will do at the end showing his vengeance of eternal water eternal fire everybody here so far let me reiterate this hell is a horrible place why is he horrible because hair is a prison hell is a horrible place why is he horrible because in hell you have chance of darkness and if you go to her you are prepared to be destroyed forever nobody in hell will be safe again everybody understanding so angels sheds of darkness sodom and gomorrah angels chance of darkness sodom and gomorrah solomon gomorrah as an example sodom and gomorrah as an example everybody here so far we keep climbing hell not only is it a horrible place hallelujah but hell is a place of disorder amen here everyone that went to hell had a position originally in heaven you follow me when they lost their god-given position they didn't have any more position anymore so when they put them together nobody knows their position he became a place of disorder [Music] hallelujah before i go job chapter 10 before i go once that shall not return even to the land of water you understand now darkness and the shadow of water everybody clear so far a land of darkness as water because it's the chance of darkness ever here and of the shadow of water without water and where the light is as water there is no light at all in here anybody care hell is a place of disorder but god is not a god of disorder [Music] bible said god is not the author of water in hell it is confusing everybody god is not the author of confusion but of what as in all churches of the water so if you see confusion in the church just recognize that hell have already entered the church ever care so far let all things be done how and what make sure you keep your order in the church if you are a strong leader keep your order in the church as a song leader if you are a musician keep your order in the church as a musician if you are a trustee keep your order as a trustee if you deacon stay in your position because god is not the author of confusion daddy stay on your position mama stay on your position children stay on your position i told you what a father responsibilities i told you what the wife's responsibility is when you start crossing those lines the devil will see that that there is a disorder there and the devil will target you and the devil will hit in that hot spot there and you're going to get in trouble i told you what a man should do in wedding i told you what a man should do in marriages i told you the place of a woman keep the sister in the press keep the man in the place the more you keep crossing you're gonna get in trouble because you're now living under permissive will which is not the perfect will of god [Music] brother stephen a crowd can drop down on the sunday so we can pick it up that's fine don't let that car keep dropping down on sunday all the time because the devil will notice that amen you can go into a period of transition god grace is there and god grace is there but god grace don't work like that hallelujah when god came under luther [Music] he was god grace for that age everybody that was living in that age was under the grace of god then grace moved to sanctification grace never stopping justification grace moved into sanctification and the one who stayed in justification the devil came and killed all of them do you follow me so make sure you stay on your position if you don't stay on your position longer the devil will see through that that this house is not in order amen god is the god of order hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the bible say in genesis 22 that abraham built an author there and laid the wood in water in exodus chapter 29 when they were putting the candlestick the pure candlestick with the lamp thereof even with the lamp to be set in water exodus floating and do that shall bring the table and set in order the water defeats that ought to be set in water the bread in water opponent before the lord as the lord has commanded who so everything in the tabernacle have to be placed in order because god is a god of order leviticus one and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay the wood in water and the priest aaron's son shall lay depart the head and the fat in water upon the word the wood which are already in order that is on the fire which is upon the altar who is already in order even the sacrifice have to be put in order hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and elijah he put the wood in water and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the water he put the bullock on the wood that was already in order paul say though i'll be absent in the flesh yet i am with you in the spirit join and be holding your water and the steadfast vastness of your faith in christ and in taddus paul say for this cause i love to deal in create you tattles that that should set water defeats that i want the holy spirit is a spirit of order why is your bedroom in disorder which spirit are you reflecting why is your house in disorder why do we have food in your bedroom for three days why do we have juice into the bathroom why is your dishes staying for 10 years for 10 for two weeks it's not washed young man why is your house in order young woman you're gonna take care of your home you're gonna be a mama one day why is your bedroom in disorder what kind of spirit are you reflecting heaven or are you reflecting hell disorder is the spirit of hell it is not the spirit of god open your car look at what is in your car open your car open the trunk of your car hallelujah hallelujah brother branham said i believe i have been in both places and i've seen the redeemer they're blessed and i seem they lost and where they wear it and that is why i stand as your brother today to warn you to free water hell is a horrible place it is a place of disorder it is a place of chance of darkness hallelujah flee from that downward path don't ever go that road and you got everything to live for that blessed upward way where they redeem our enjoy in peace and they can sing and can be sorry and there is nothing they are what perfect see both sin both places i know that is an awful statement for a person to make but god being my judge i solemnly believe i have been in both places and oh fire it from any person ever entering that region of the water if you are standing with a hot wire ball through you tormented in every day it will be not like the devil torment there is in that place brother bottom is saying if you cut a hot wire and you put it in fire and it's really hard and they take you they bound you and they put that hot wire in you the pain and the suffering you have cannot be compared with what is going on in hell hallelujah there could be nothing human man could not the human man could not comprehend what the region of the lust is there is no way to explain it hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord that's the reason why the rich young ruler was telling abraham go and send lazarus tell my brother i don't want anybody to come here [Music] [Applause] they have no idea what i'm going through hallelujah i pray this day for that would send him to my father's house i have found brethren that they may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of water how do you avoid it listen to the prophet listen to the word amen hell is a horrible place hell is a prison hell is a place of chance of darkness and hell is an unfitted place to anyone i'm going to help you up again hell is a place that is not even good for demon [Music] if you're sleeping you need to wake up hell is a place that is not good for the devil hallelujah in luke chapter 8 the bible says and when he sent forth the land they met him out of the city a certain man which had water how and why water how many times am i gonna preach in this church about your clothing now you start having two clothing you have clothing you bring to church and you have clothing you wear outside when it's a party i told you as a sister you make sure your knees are covered now you bring your knees up here and you put what they call lace that is still showing your knees i told you avoid tight dresses you keep wearing that dressing i told you avoid high heels and it hurt me after everything i thought sisters in this church keep wearing high heels and i hear you're gonna push your back up it is a spirit of lust on you that is trying to cause men to last after you hallelujah wear no clothing neither boiling water but in water brother stephen you say that in the prison there is no spirit you say that in the spirit in a prison it's only the body the souls are in hell why do therefore like prison why i'm i'm sorry why do devil like cemetery if there is no spirit there stay up and put your seat belt are you there i'm going to come back there what is going on when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice saying whatever to do with jesus that son of water i beseech the water did he say burn me for he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for often time he had cut him and have kept bond with him and he was kept bound with chains that's natural man and feathers and he broke the banks and was driven off the devil into water why is the devil warning the wilderness can i get this out we found out here that as we spoke as as we speaking about the condition of hell hell is a horrible place and we found out that the devil loves the love tombs or cemetery cemetery anybody care and they also love water wilderness why my people suffer for lack of knowledge anybody care and jesus asked him saying what is that name and he said my name is who because what many devils were entered into him this dem this name legion is not the name of one devil it's a name of many devils it's be 8 000 something grouped together but they are in unity when they ask them demon one didn't say my name is so so my name is so jesus would have started there and everybody presenting themselves one by one one by one but they were cluttered together as a unity they didn't say that's not my problem that's his problem you touch my brother you touch me [Music] demon learn that that's what they were trying to do in the tower of babel they're trying to put everything because they'll learn the power of unity the children of god don't learn that selfish everybody clear 31 and they besought him who's besotting jesus who's begging jesus what are they begging jesus for they besought him that he will not command them to go out into the water hell is a horrible place [Music] hell is a place of chance of darkness hell is a place that is not fitted to live hell is an uncomfortable place for even devils devils are begging jesus christ don't please let us go out but not back again dead why do you want to go to hell and you saying people to hell go to hell do you know what hell means do you know what hell means and you want to send people to hell the devil themselves don't want to go there and they are begging jesus they say please jesus cast us the way we understand but don't go we don't want to go back there and the rich young ruler said send somebody there tell them don't come here hallelujah and there was there a herd of son feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter there let us go into the pig it is better but we can't go to hell because here is an unfitted place for anyone including the devil and his angels and jesus went to hell because of you [Music] the one who never seen the one who never done anything wrong the one who was perfect accepted to go into this place so that you can become the righteousness of god why you don't want to serve him why you don't want to serve god why when it comes to the things of god you always have an excuse why you want to be the last one to be in church [Music] now we found out that the devil preferred to enter a beast they were into a person and they drove that person into the tomb but the tomb the bible tells us that when the rich young muller died his soul went into water there's nobody in the tomb it's the bodies what happened everybody anybody here god was omnipresent he was omnipotent he's the god that knew everything anybody care when god immortal himself into the pillar of fire the first thing god began to create brother kelly was the zodiac you follow me god created the heaven genesis 1 1 the first thing god created as a creator was the heaven everybody so far brother branham said we are creators the first thing god created god have to create an atmosphere and from that atmosphere god begin to work yes hey and as creature of god the first thing we usually create is an atmosphere around us do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me hell is unfitted for the devil you follow me but we create atmosphere anybody here when people go to the womb to the cemetery or when people go to the grave everybody that goes there is sad do you follow me you might you follow me when we go to the cemetery we are sad somebody is crying somebody is in sorrow somebody is in tears somebody's in pain that's why they're going to the cemetery because they lost a loved one and this is the last time they're gonna see their body and they're gonna be separated forever from the one that they love for the child that they love for the husband that they love for the father that they love for the mother that they love everybody and that atmosphere that we go with it in the cemetery is what makes the cemetery a gloomy place do you follow me do you follow me the one who died is not dead that person is already either in hell are they in heaven but with a living are creating an atmosphere in the cemetery of the things we're bringing into a cemetery do you follow me then the cemetery become a place of sorrow the cemetery become a place that is gloomy the cemetery become a place that always remember us of a bad memories do you follow me if we on summer and the temperature is 105 outside the sun is bright who want to stay outside who want to stay outside who want to get into the house where there is ignore conditioning and when you get into the house where there is an air conditioning in that day do you want to go out hell is 105 degrees did you hear that did you hear that i'm just paraphrasing so when the devil leaves hell ever clear everybody they are looking for a place where there is no conditioning do you follow me do you follow me then those prayers must be gloomy must be sorrowful that's why the devil hang into the cemetery because he keep them warm do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me and when you in your home you follow me you begin to live a certain kind of life everybody fasting all the time pulling all the time gossiping all the time talking all the time left and righting disorder you begin to create and now conditioning for the devil brother branham say the atmosphere you create either attract or it's gonna repost something are you there when your home is always depression in your home is always sadness it's always fasting it's always yelling it's always talking about somebody your home become an air conditioning for devils before you know it if somebody is out of hell they're looking for a place where there is a sea and you the one providing them ac and when they get there they begin to they don't want to go they prefer to stay there rather than going back in hell everybody clear anybody clear about here then the little first that started you entered there where is makaki i don't know then the devil goes let her talk to you like that don't ever talk to me like that then the devil goes back tell him you are not a christian are you really a christian then the same devil goes back up tell him that if you let her go like this she's not going to listen to you whisper go ahead and tell him that you are the head and don't play with you go i am the head in this house don't play with me then the devil goes back up say tell him also you are not a dormant i'm not going nowhere i'm not going nowhere who are you then the devil turn around everybody here before you know it before you know it an atmosphere begin to get created ever here a liquid supernatural begin to create a heaven in your house ever here when he created you created hell in your own house can i continue can i continue if you notice the devil don't want to stay in hell they want to come out you're going to feel like if you are arguing in the bedroom the first thing you do you want to come out of the bedroom the reason why you coming out of the bedroom because you already contaminated the atmosphere so just like the devil wanna flee you also wanna flee and you go sit in the bed in a in a living room and you feel like you're good the bedroom now it's a problem my people suffer for lack of work can i continue can i continue can i continue can i continue can i continue can i continue as you fasting that milky atmosphere is already created in your bedroom it's time to go to bed you're gonna notice if you are sitting in the bed if your husband gets in you get up everybody here ever here ever here because you caused that yourself and before you know it you gotta go sleep in a different bedroom now you have created the chance of circumstances where you too cannot sleep on the bed on the same bed again and the devil are sitting there are you there now a pastor have to drop down and to pull you aside and pull somebody and say apologize to one another and now when you apologize you break that chain but your homies still in darkness now you gotta go home and de-program everything that you did [Music] hallelujah when you are home sing song when you are home praise god when you are home be happy when your home appreciate god create a good milky atmosphere for the holy ghost and the angel of the lord brother branham said when the atmosphere above jump down into a church it become a heavenly atmosphere because god inhabits the water the presence of who do you believe you are people of god so you need to praise god when you are cooking you say praise god you singing hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] when your job you need to be singing if you can put a bluetooth put a bluetooth listen to the word listen to the christian song create an atmosphere around you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and when the devil sees that it is a torment and when an angel sees that they say that's what we like [Applause] ever here the trap is praying you are cooking the tape is playing you are cooking suddenly wow i never hear that one let me put the tape back again then enough for the revelation they need up for the revelation and before you know it you're going to see yourself praising the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are a creator you can create your own atmosphere and live inside of it [Applause] if your friend comes he begins to talk about somebody cut him off because you're trying to create an atmosphere again i am not the air conditioning of devils go see that person go tell them ah leave me alone i have children i have a husband i have a wife i need to take care of my family i don't want no more devil the hour is late [Music] i am in two thirds of the sermon hallelujah hallelujah remember that that's why devil when they go there that's what jesus said when an unclean spirit come out he goes into the what wilderness and brother branham said the wilderness never existed before it was sin that caused the wilderness that's why in the millennium the wilderness will do water it will blossom again they have to remove that curse so they want to go in cursed places hallelujah do you think brother branham was going to the mountain to pray for nothing he was getting away from the cities because devil's embargo and boy a nightclub are they he goes out to in the wood when the atmosphere is clear then the sooner he starts praying he's in contact with god that's why brother bonham said he loved to pray early in the morning he said because the night clever closed he said the activity of the devil are slowing down [Music] when they turn the nightclub on they're giving them air conditioning they're more happy dead than in hell [Music] hallelujah learn to create a good atmosphere check who is your friend take what you're talking about brother random say you create that atmosphere by your life by the things that you do and the things that you talk about hallelujah you sit around and keep talking about the church about the church about something this one this this one this you're not happy about this you know before you know it it's a milky atmosphere that has been created that has been created that has been created that has been created and before you know it the devil put the chains on you and to break it you need a sincere repentance amen how this man that you love you can't sleep with him anymore what happened he put his hand get him off really really let him die [Music] and we will see you rolling here lord resurrect him so why is that devil making you think that he is your enemy you have created an atmosphere that is unfitted and the husband prefer to stay longer at work because when he get home it's a fast that is waiting hallelujah hallelujah he can't go home he preferred to go home late when he gets there he eats he goes to bed to avoid any confrontation the home become a hair becoming air conditioning for hell my people suffer for lack of knowledge hallelujah the cemetery we create that atmosphere and before we know it when we get in the cemetery you feel funny feeling and those who knows of the kingdom of darkness approach the devil through the cemetery because the atmosphere is already created there they can connect quickly with the fifth dimension let me i gotta stop here and let you chew on this hallelujah let me stop here this is tough i gotta stop here if i get this i gotta dig again deeper hallelujah take home hell it's not a good place hell it's a horrible place hell it's not even fitted for the devil brother brother say if anything i can do i'm going to warn you do not go that path avoid hell and hell is on earth hell is burning what does burning hell what kind of fire is in hell if brother brother say they take a hot wire and the ball you through it's not compared to that what is really in hell why is the rich young ruler saying put water in my tongue why only the tongue i gotta get that brother branham do you mean to tell me that you believe there is a burning hell i say it's not what i say it's what the bible says do you mean to tell me that a loving heavenly father would burn his children up who told you to the children of god hallelujah why say you wouldn't burn your children i say no sir well then if you as a human that has that much love how people can twist their things around see how people treat they can twist their finger one if you that's a man talking to brother brother if you as a human have that much love you think that the loving father brother branham the loving father would destroy his children but i'm saying i say never he don't destroy his children but whose child are you original god don't destroy his he's trying the best to get them but it's there that turn loose will destroy his so god just permits satan [Music] hell is burning mark nine jesus said if their hands are fendi cut it off it is better for them to enter into life name than having two hands to go into water because of that skirt you find yourself in hell because of one shoe you're gonna find yourself in hell a shoe purchased in walmart into the fire that never shall be water hallelujah hallelujah okay i'm going to live this so you think over the week jesus said there is a fire in hell that burn brother branham just say there you believe in a burning hell right get this and we get the answer later brother bottom say the judgment is not now because the people are in hell in prison and there is no burning hell now you see now you see now that's why the message having a lot of complications that's why you have a lot of contradiction he said here he said here he change you see you see somebody tells you the guy is in the water burning hair now that is what ouch a judge of this earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to what and god will never throw a man into a fiery furnace until he's first he is condemned by god's own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have the water and the trial is the white throne but now he's in a place called water how did jesus say burning hell and brother branham say no ponder on that let's stand jesus is right brother branham is right keep that in mind when you're pondering just keep that in mind that jesus is right and brother branham is right you just need to be put together amen i thought i'm gonna finish the lake of fire and get into the resurrection for the second death but we got to pick it up remember church hell is a horrible place hell is a bad place hell is a place of disorder your life needs to be put in order your home needs to be put in order this church need to continue to resume back in order because we're no longer in a hotel your home is not hell it is a property that god gave you but you can make hell yourself or you can make it
