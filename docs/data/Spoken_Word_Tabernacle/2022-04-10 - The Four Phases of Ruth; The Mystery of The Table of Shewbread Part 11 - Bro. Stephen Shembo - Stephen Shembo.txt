and I was watching your faces and there was joy and there was peace and there was happiness We Can't Stop thought thinking about him some people he never even comes up to and we can't we just can't stop all right so I'm gonna read this one first uh it's a praise report brother brother Sam came this morning man I got a testimony on his way home last night he normally gets off at exit 92 down in Gaffney he says he remembers passing 96 and then he didn't wake up until he was past exit 80 he has no recollection there's there's construction barriers and everything else going on down there he said he went to sleep pling simple home there he is though God protected our brother [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he's not done with you yet brother that's so I can't wait what's next amen amen amen I have two spoken testimonies I'm going to read this this real quick um we got another birthday today and and uh brother polycarp and the church family want to wish wish sister Sephora a birthday today they want to thank the Lord for granting her another year this today amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah sister zad has a testimony you want to tell it right there or you want to come up here whatever you want to do God bless you Saints I'm going to make it quick it's actually two testimonies that um when it happened I didn't have the opportunity or didn't take the opportunity to tell it but I think it was so profound that I wanted to share it with you guys um it was a maybe about two three weeks ago our brother MB came here and preached um on that week um I was sick um with I believe it was a stomach virus that was going around a lot of people had it at my job and different things um I thought I had food poisoning um but I wasn't sure to identify what it was um as as I got really sick it was on the Wednesday that I got sick so the same day I was sick I came home I was throwing up um uncontrollably and um in my heart though I knew it was Wednesday and I wanted to go to church so as I'm home um I'm trying to rest and I'm tossing and turning with excruciating pain um and I couldn't even I was so weak I couldn't even pick up my phone to like send out a message or text anyone to say can you please pray for me I just need someone to intercede on my behalf um um I also said Lord you know help me that's all I could say I didn't really even send a prayer up for myself because I was so disoriented um so I I after throwing up about three times or so I I I went to sleep and when I woke up it was exactly 7:18 now I wasn't aware that brother MCB was preaching on that night and I didn't wasn't aware that I was having people come in town um to basically support him which are my very close friends so I um they called me when they called they said uh you know are you're not going to church I said I've been sick all day I said I couldn't even text anybody to say anything and something in my heart was like as soon before she called I would I felt better I felt completely good I was like I believe I can go to church it was my first thought before she called and then when she did um I told my mom I said Mom she was she she was already prepared just to stay home with me to make sure I was okay and I went downstairs said Mom you know you want to go to church I said I want to go in the house of the Lord um and so when I went when I came um they're in service so of course I felt better but as I was driving driving then I had excruciating back pain and I literally couldn't even sit down and almost couldn't stand up through service and so I was praying to the Lord and I was claiming my healing because whatever brother Brent pra was preaching about it was talking about you know speaking you know over yourself and over your situation so I said Lord I claim my healing and nothing was changing I said I claim my healing nothing was changing and so after church um brother Stephen found out that you know I wasn't feeling well I went to the car immediately cuz I could barely stand up and I started singing my healing I just started singing song that came to my heart and I said I rebuke this I said I'm not going to be sick tomorrow I refuse I said I know if I claim that he'll do it then I went um then brother steam came over he's like do you want me to pray for you mind you I already claimed it so I didn't want I didn't feel like it was necessary to have anything else added to that because I feel like that would be doubting God and he said are you sure I said yes I'm sure I'm Healed he said are you sure I said I'm Healed and the next day I woke up I was healed God bless you Church um on Friday morning all of y'all know that I deliver milk I was in my um truck and I stopped to talk to my wife because our policy is you can't drive and talk at the same time even with the handfree stuff so as we talked you know we said all goodbyes and I said how much I love after got on the road I was headed towards Greenwood and about maybe 20 minutes the speed limit had changed from 55 to 45 so I dropped my speed and it it's like a four lane two going this way and two coming up on 25 and there was an intersection I noticed the 18wheeler stopped you know to have me p pass and the other one was coming in the opposite direction he was about to make a left turn I don't know how he didn't see me the man didn't stop just pulled in and started making his turn and I was coming down 45 50 miles an hour and I said I'm there was no other way I said we're going to crash we are I'm going hit his cargo whatever is in that cargo it'll I I just saw the end of my life I mean it's God's grace that I'm standing in front of y'all amen so everything slow down amen amen I was looking and thank God I was not in the far right lane I was in the left you know left lane that gave me uh ability to maneuver the truck and I had to to avoid him otherwise my whole cab would have been in this cargo and I God only knows what he was carrying could have been metal it could have been whatever so I maneuvered a truck and went into the other two lanes had there been a vehicle coming it would have been a head on collision so God had a said where there wasn't any other vehicle coming and so in the truck I didn't Panic it was such a a lovely uh presence that came in the truck and the Lord just slowed everything down I was able to see the that was the only way to get out of that uh uh not happening so I got in the other lane and and then I pull back just slow soft no Panic amen hallelujah amen [Applause] hallelujah amen does anybody have a a a prayer request let's go with let go with um unspoken as we stand okay Amen brother Lamont would you mind coming up and leading us you're welcome our hearts and mind are clear dear precious father we just uh

keep missing I don't know what to do amen we usually let you know a month ahead or couple 3 weeks ahead so you can make some preparation it is is very important for you to be there amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord yesterday I have to be a little bit hard on the young people right no cording somebody into the world Amen I have to insist it because I was sensing something so if you hear cording with somebody or talking to somebody who's not in the message you need to stop what you're doing amen amen regardless of how nice that person is if you're texting with a boy or something and you know he's not part of this church or part of the message somewhere in a message Church you got to stop it that's the reason why I was insisting because somebody probably is doing something so I'm not talking about you that are already here I'm talking about you being here going now outside then it's a problem that's what I was insisting amen so if you're texting with some somebody in the world who's smoking or maybe he's not smoking he's just a good boy look clean at work or something or in school stop it if you don't the holy spirit will catch you bad and I will rescue you before I rescue you I spank you first amen so I was talking about the people that are already here going into the world Amen everything clear so far blessed be the name of the Lord you saw something outside right how many are curious to know what it is somebody is not curious because they already know or somebody already Tau them what's going on Amen all right that was just a gift that I have to buy for the church amen I have to amen I saw it years years ago before I was even a pastor and I was passing by it and I look I say this looks so good but this is something to put on a church if I wish I had a church I would have put this [Applause] one that was years ago and here it happened and guess what came back down straight online if I tell you how much discount I got from that thing you won't believe I'm on YouTube so I have to you want to know yeah oh my [Laughter] God if I'm not mistaken the discount they gave me was almost this you want me to tell you again they gave me a discount almost 12 ,000 off everybody C everybody C everybody clear everybody clear so you might think that he was maybe higher than this that's what you think right the problem is I'm on YouTube M muted Brother David you heard them you got it am I already muted not so after service you stay right there you wait for me I'm going to cut it off and you will see what he on [Music] amen I want it to be like a gift for the church cuz I knew it's going to look good amen blessed be the name of the Lord and somebody bought this as a gift they say Pastor keep putting his suit on the chair and somebody brought me this for free this one I got 100% [Applause] amen somebody order a box I don't know where it's coming from and he came and he was delivered in the church we got it there so if it's a gift for the church you don't want me to know go tell the Deacon so I know okay we figure it out okay praise God so now I can okay now we makes s if you want to give something to the church you don't want me to know that's fine just tell the Deacon and tell the Deacon I want to keep secret from the pastor if they [Laughter] can I didn't put them in trouble amen they kept it from me I don't know who bought this so whoever did it may the Lord bless you let's go to Exodus chapter 25 blessed be the name of the Lord the material is heavy and I would need Grace if I Rush somebody will be left behind so relax a little bit you took my time a little bit so relax the material is heavy all right I believe we're back on YouTube right before somebody should have TT or something amen the pastor say the material is what so don't sleep the Deacon will handle you Exodus chapter 25 with everything we went last night it was Heavy I didn't want to give you any more reading I want you to go home and relax because that was deep Exodus 25

the temple not everybody eat it amen common bread everybody can eat it everybody okay praise God there is no common bread under my hand but there is hollow bread he's talking to a priest in the Tabernacle everybody here the priest say hey I don't have your normal bread over there that you eat a warm I mean a mcdonal or whatever all I have here is the good stuff that come from the Tabernacle everybody okay now if the young men have kept themselves El leas from what to eat this bread you cannot play around with women beauti you the one pulling slow everybody here this bread if you want to eat it you must be separated from women not a woman women plural a woman represent what chur you must separate it from the churches am am I okay to eat the showbread you cannot eat the showbread being in certain churches you must come out of those churches you cannot interact with those churches if you want to eat the showbread you cannot listen to Pentecostal preachers all Baptist preachers all Presbyterian preachers and then come back again and eat the showbread [Music] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen verse 5 and David answered the priest and said said to him of Truth women have been kept

young man are holy everybody here they did mingle with the women they are holy and the bread is in a manner what what so the young men are holy and because they are holy even if they eat the showbread they show bread to them become as normal bread everybody okay Amen in the manner common yet though he wear what do you see that word let me read it again the bread is in a manner common come on yeah though he were what you see that word sanctify though he were Sanctified this day in the what so it's a bread of sanctification everybody okay amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah you there verse 6 so the priest gave him hollow bread for there was no bread there but the what bread so the showbread is a hall bread we okay now and the showbread that was taken from before the what there is a key Point here those showbread that they gave David was taken from the what the table of the Lord why do we need this detail why do we want to know that they just took it away there is a key to that amen they were taken from before the Lord to put what hot bread everybody care in the day when he was taken away in other word you came in the time that we just exchange the bread that's right we took the old bread down we just put fresh bread bread that's the time David came in the temple so David came at the junction of the exchange of bread Hallelujah everybody okay so far jump down to verse uh8 and David said to aimc is there not here under your hand spear or what sword sword for I have neither brought my sword nor my what nor my weapon with me because the king's business require haste watch this and the priest say the sword of who the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you slew in the valley of a behold is there WRA behind the what behind the EOD where thebody behind the EOD so the EOD was there for the high priest and behind the EOD they took the sword of Goliath and put it there and the epod will have the UR but behind the there was the sword of Goliath it was used one time yes by David and it disappear and this time that sword came back again alive let me help you again I'm going to go it is behind the eold if you shall take that take it for there is no other no weapon in the Tabernacle except the sword of Goliath David Avid when he fought golad he didn't have a weapon he have a slingshot when golad fell down David went on top of Goliath and took the sword of golad not the sword of Israel the sword of Goliath and pull it away and then Cho the head of Goliath and took that sword and they put it in the Tabernacle and he came at the time of the exchange of the bread yes first they gave bread and after giving him a bread they added a sword you have not cut it yet everybody care give me he said David said there is none like that give it to me so that sword was unique no other sword look like the sword of Goliath it's a sword that is different than any other sword he only was used first with David then they give David the sword after they gave him the bread first David had the bread that was consecrated for the people that are holy everybody okay but after the bread David cannot stop at show bread only he will end up with a sword in his hand is he clicking now do you know somebody who was preaching preaching preaching preaching preaching and after a while there come an event in his life that he stopped from preaching and the sword hit his [Music] hand did I lose you no did I lose you no when Brother brandham begin to preach did he have a sword no but toward the end of his ministry in 1963 when he went to Sabino what happened in his hand was that sword a new sword it was a sword of somebody that used it before and he used it when he Cho the head of Goliath at the cross Hallelujah when he came down and went in the cross there was a goath that made us suffer for a long time and he cut the head of Goliath and that sword went back again to Heaven [Music] Hallelujah let's go to first king chapter 17 just reading the scripture you know what for the sake of time let's pray this scripture we read it before Elijah meeting the Widow women and then he asked for water water then the cake and the cake and the other one you remember that right for the sake of time let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly again father this morning thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is only thing the only thing that man that you give ability to do can do is to read the word of the scripture father this is loaded and I pray that you help me and help the church may you move us completely away May tiredness sleepiness whatever is troubl in your people may live now father may your blood continue to protect us and may you speak to our souls this morning in the name of Jesus Christ amen that's why you need to read the message that's why why you need to listen to the tape cuz some of you are lost everybody here the Bible says in Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with all men and Holiness Holiness without which no man shall see who if you want to see God you must be what everybody okay my subject this morning is the m of the table of the showbread normally I should call this the four phases of roof roof at the table of the showbread but I call this the mystery so you can have a reference quickly instead when you need it everybody here the mystery of the table of the showbread or the four servies of roof roof at the table of the showbread everybody okay when we looked in the Tabernacle we found out that the Tabernacle have different stages of our life you cannot be happy to just being in the camp of Israel but being in the camp of Israel doesn't bring you Redemption because Paul say not all Israel is Israel you must go through the process of redemption that was locked up or the Plan of Redemption that was locked up into the Tabernacle you got to find your way in when you get your way in you enter the Tabernacle you find an altar you remember last night and when you find the the the altar you take your decision over there you repented of your sin and then from there you are justify because you made peace with God after justification you move to the next step and then over there you get your water baptism amen and then from there you continue your journey you don't stop there and you enter the holy place this is where we have roof roof under the holy Place everybody okay so far now roof under the holy place means roof serving it means roof under sanctification it means roof under Wesley it means roof under Armenian ISM everybody okay so when you enter the Tabernacle inside the Tabernacle we have furniture there go ahead everybody here and as you approaching the inside of the Tabernacle you must interact with every Furniture of the Tabernacle that is correct everybody here if you meet the bre and altar you must deal with that bre and Al and dealing with that bre and Al for us today means you got meet Jesus Christ at the cross you got to repent of your sin you got to recognize yourself as a sinner even if if you were born in the message you are still a sinner even if you never went to the nightclub you are a sinner you just a clean sinner everybody even if you never drunk a whiskey in your life you still a sinner a sinner by birth everybody so you need to meet the Lord you need to interact with the braen Altar and once you finish your interaction with the braen altar you move to the next step and you interact with the lever and with the lever you got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and what a baptism is essential the only time you're going to be spare is when you on the death bed and there is nothing else to do and you got to die and you give your life to Jesus Christ then you go but if you still alive you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit everybody okay so far all right praise God now Ruth under serving we says that rof under serving means to make herself ready make herself ready for what brother bam continue because you already know this quote he say under serving he said Ruth have to serve in the field of boas because the field of boas was the only one that have the power of transformation he can take you from a widow wood until you get married to a new husband and be counted as a child of Israel and be dissolved in the nation of Israel until when they look at you they cannot find any Gentile Trace in you everybody okay she was serving barefooted painful and gleaning behind the Reapers when you serve you do not glean ahead of the he you must stay behind the reaper when the Ark of the Covenant was moving toward Jordan everybody have to stay behind the ark and the Ark was carried by the priest and the sheath was carried by the Reapers the Reapers move on and they drop the sheave and you solo behind the Reapers and you start picking up your food everybody care so far so what we saying here is we are under sanctification under sanctification I want to remind you brother brandham say that sanctification is the second stage of Grace which cleans the Mind everybody okay and set the heart the mind of the heart because the heart have mind as a man thinking in his heart everybody here you can think here or you can think here everybody here in order of what because with our Holiness you cannot see who a man can repent of sin you already know this and he's still thinking maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he found he's still there maybe he's a drunker every time he smelled the drink he's still there so the justify state in the Tabernacle here doesn't take away the desire of sin that's why you see people in the message keep backsliding back and forth back and forth in the world and come back and repent and re baptize and go back in the world because they don't understand they're in a wrong State they need to move quickly forward everybody care so far and brother brandham say but then when he gets Sanctified roof under sanctification that cleanses that desire out of him it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but he takes the want of it way but is not right yet why because even though the want is taken away in your beautiful heart you still have a snake that's exactly right brother amen thank you Lord everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the Lord and brother Bram said that is what the matter we don't get seal so much because we are too lose about things everybody care the Holy Ghost will not come on you if your life is not Sanctified yet because God live in the holiest everybody if your life is still not clean yet there is no way you can see God there is no way you can enter the holiest you need to clean up that's why roof serving that serving is making roof ready preparing her to meet the King brother Bram say that's what the matter we don't get seal so much we are too lose about things when the inspector goes around to inspect your life to see if you are not just a little loser about things a little lose about your what little lose about that what you still have that snake active little lose about to that what that talk about what you need to cut away from every brother or every sister in this message that whenever you meet them or whenever they call you they always have story about other people you need to cut those people [Music] away if you are enjoying the story and being informed of everything that happened in every Church CH you have a snake in you that is still active and the snake want to feed on certain things everybody okay you got to cut those people because they are blocking you from moving forward I love them they're your friend your friend is blocking you from moving forward everybody here all you need to tell him listen if we want a fellowship from now on I don't want to hear about people's mother when you call me don't tell me about anybody else mother let's talk about the word or things that belong to me and you he shall never seal the car some dirty habit under justification some vile things under justification some vulgarity what constantly your mind is vulgar all it takes a little bit of sleeping you pornography he cannot seal you everybody okay he can't seal the car but when he's found everything in place the inspector then he does what there be anybody open that seal until the car reach what its destination to where it's what because once you seal with the Holy Spirit you are seal until the day of what nobody can touch you anymore the devil can tempt you he can make you suffer but he's not going to do anything and even the suffering of the devil he need permission from God if it's in your path of Life everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so when we clean up this table and we are dealing with the Holy place we find out that roof entering justification or the other cour roof have to interact with the furniture of the the other court she had to interact with the braen Altar and she has to interact with the lever now the holy place also have furniture right and those Furniture we already told you is the Candlestick the table of the showbread and the golden altar which we already spoke about so Ruth when she entered the holy place just as she interacted with the present altar just as you have to interact with the braen which is the cross in your life you have to interact with the lever which is your word of baptism when you enter in the Holy place you must interact with everything that is in the Holy place that's right did I lose somebody in the Holy place we spoke last Sunday on roof under the golden Candlestick now I want to remind you we were in rof Chapter 2 that the golden cand sck the Bible says in the Book of Revelation that the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sest in my right hand and the Seven golden candles stick the Seven Star are the Angels of the seven Church ages and the Seven Candlestick which the S are the what in other words you cannot separate the candles stick from the Star amen everybody here the candlestick are the churches everybody here and the star are we have the star and we have the churches everybody here the Candlestick are the churches and the star are not just star but they are the star of the church ages in other words you cannot speak about the star without talking about the churches or you cannot talk about the churches without talking about the star everybody clear I hope the devil I mean God will keep your mind straight from moving around everybody so the star and the church ages both of them are connected if you need to go to the restroom that's fine but let's stay focus a little bit the star and the church ages both of them are connected you cannot speak about one without talking about the other everybody clear so far and then when we deal with it on Sunday we found out the Bible say uh brother Bram says that the next thing she has to do is serve that is what the church has to do the church after making your decision you have to serve serve God according to his what you don't serve God any kind of way God is a god of order the Devil is a man of disorder that's why hell there is no other in hell but if you want to serve the devil you can serve him any kind of way you can sleep in the world and don't come to church the devil is fine or you can come to church and be a hypocrite the devil is still fine but God you don't serve him any kind of way you got to serve God according to his plan according to his diagram you got to serve God according to his diagram according to his what blue blueprint you must serve who what is the diagram of God under the Candlestick the diagram of God under the Candlestick we found out in roof that we have bers everybody here boas was a type of Christ who was the owner of the field and because the seed in the field belongs to boas and he is the one that have the plan of everything everybody here and under bers we have the chief Reaper everybody here the chief Reaper is one is the messenger of the age you serve God according to the blueprint you must know what is the blueprint under the Candlestick in order to serve God properly everybody here because remember when God spoke to the churches God always say write unto the angel not to you do you hear me right unto the angel of Ephesus right unto the angel of smina right unto the angel of pergam not writing to you the letter goes from the chief yes from Bowers to the chief Reaper the chief Reaper is the messenger of the age he's the boss of the age he's the manager of the age he's the supervisor of the age he is the pastor of the age in other words when boas is not there the chief Reaper is responsible for the age am Hallelujah by the btom say unto the angel of the Church of Taran do what did you notice these addresses these messenger are address to the what or the what bearing the what because he's a star bearing the light of that church everybody that's why why when boas came in the field he didn't ask the other Reapers he asked the chief Reaper who is this woman in my field everybody that's why Paul say You must be judged according to my gospel because the plan of bers has been given to the chief Reaper the letter of God is given to the messenger and the messenger knows what is the program of God for that age the chief Reaper knows what is the program of Boaz for his field Hallelujah the brother Bram says the lat to the seven Church Ages were written how prophetically to the Future age Paul wrote off the life and glory of the seven Church ages praising in his day everybody okay John wrote off the life and glory of the seven Church ages in the future that John was addressing the seven what all the seven what M the messenger are the pastor of the age as directly all Christian and and the seven different whats so you must serve God according to the blueprint blueprint what you must be under a chief Reaper the chief Reaper of your age who is the pastor the boss the manager the supervisor the responsible light in the absence of the sun when the sun is not there the star come to give you light you need to find which star is giving light so you can be under that everybody so far that's why boas told him brother Bram says here little baby say well I go to church my mama belong to this church I have nothing against that dear brother and I realize this being tape that's all right belong to Mama's church but listen Mama walk in one light yes sir you are walking in another light L walk in what one one light where walk in what different dosage of a moying wle walk in one light and Pentecost walk in water but we are working on a higher than that today everybody okay so far the light we have today the prescription we have today the dosage we have today is higher than Luther higher than Wesley higher than Pentecost everybody okay brother Bram say and if there is another what brother Bram didn't say there is another [Music] generation brother bam say if there is another generation why did he say if because the Bible say the generation that will see Israel going back to the promised land that generation will not pass away until Jesus Christ come there is not another generation we are the missing generation you remember the missing generation we are the missing generation the generation of MEC there is nothing else that is coming up that'sall amen if there is another generation it shall go what in other words if God move again it's going to be higher but we know this is the end this is completion this is number seven everybody okay so far I have heard of you don't you go to another field roof ah I like that don't start Mission thotting stay right here in my field stay with mine stay here stay with me don't go running around from places you're going to pick up Spirit you can be running around in places on YouTube and before you know it you're going to swallow a wrong [Music] Doctrine everybody here if you believe the message what do you do hang on to it matter what the price is stay right with it right on if you means sacrifice this that all the other and I have to quit my drinking I have to quit my stealing have to quit my lying I'm going to stay right with it in the process of time you got to get away from stuff you got to clean up yourself you got to clean up your friend even your message friend because he's in the message doesn't mean he's in the holiest he might be just in the camp so you are on the holy place he is in the camp who's pulling the other one because he was a friend for you for 5 years you didn't change him somebody's changing somebody either they're going to be like you are you the one becoming like them but if you check them they don't change meaning you the one that is dropping because you are compromising to keep them alive because if you stand with what the message say they won't like you anymore you better leave them alone because the Lord is coming I am not going to stay on this in this world because of you you going to stay here I am going everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the Lord so after the chief Reaper the blueprint of God you got Reapers everybody here plural and these Reapers works with Maiden you remember a Reaper we found out in the scripture and under brother brandham that a Reaper was an angel and menen were women and women speak of what everybody Hallelujah brother Bram says this that you who remember the messenger are Pastor your you remember in the hotel your pastor when he stand here on the platform ministering the what the word of God the word of God he is God's what to the what he's a Reaper for that church Messenger to that not messenger of the age but messenger of the local church the messenger of the age is the chief Reaper but the pastor is Messenger to his own local flock everybody here therefore a pastor should what never leave the what that's why brother Bram say if he leaves the word what do you do you leave him because he's not under the program of God he's no longer under the diagram of God he's no longer under the blueprint of God everybody here because but stay with the word because he's feeding the shepherd place because the word pastor means what look it up and find out if that Ain right a pastor is a Shepherd the Holy Ghost has made him overse here over a certain flock to feed them what with the chief Reaper must be under boas the reaper must be under the chief Reaper and the Maiden must be under the reaper that are under the chief Reaper can I repeat again because boas thought stay with the maiden and follow the reaper you must stay under a church that have a pastor that is following the messenger of the age according to the program of God you must be following a maiden under a Reaper under a chief Reaper under bers Amen in other words The Church Must preach bers according to the revelation of the chief [Music] Reaper and The Reaper must preach Bowers according to the revelation of the chief Reaper and The madeen must reflect Bowers according to the revelation of the chief rep that have been given to to the reaper because that's why the church is a reflector you must reflect bers you must reflect the word that you have been preaching why because if a new roof comes in the camp God expect the new roof to follow you if a if a woman come from the world and she was wearing pants and everything when she gave her life to God and she get baptized God put that woman under you to follow the older sister that are already in the churches so that woman will begin to watch you oh they don't wear pant then she changes she put another another skirt okay they don't wear makeup and the sister remove it oh they don't wear earrings so you become the word to the roof that enter in the camp GL everybody here everybody here that's why we need to be very careful you who believe the message a long time because sometime you are the hindrance to the children that are coming up the children are coming up but they have bad example bad example from their parent your child is 11 years old can your child drive a car how is your child going to church if you don't come to church what does that child have to do stay home because they don't know how to drive a car because they don't own a car because daddy stay home home Daddy is a hindrance to that child Mama become a hindrance for that child when they younger children want to be on time on Church it is the parent causing the [Music] delay until the young children come to church and the parent are still struggling to make it to church you forgot you are the menen you are the reflector that the new younger are following but you mama are not an example that is not an example you come late every day what example are you giving to your child every day before you come to church you must argue why because somebody's dragging everybody okay Mama want the child to diee what do you want that child to be everybody here the child is telling you we need to go to church mama say I'm tired I cannot go to church who is hindering the work of who you think you have the Holy Ghost because you've been in the message 20 years you're going to get surprise before you know it you will find out this younger generation will begin to rebuke you that's it everybody you will hear them telling you Mama AR supposed to do this he said shut up you are trying to use Authority now to shut the word down because the child is telling you the truth you must be humble enough to recognize when you are wrong even if you a parent the children are ready Daddy's the one in the bathroom the children are ready momm is the one in the bathroom until the children are tired they have to pick up their own car and leave you and you still don't understand you don't wake up you okay you're going to come when the service start when they already start the song leading that's when you come because you already have your own Holy [Music] Ghost check your Holy Ghost check your Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will not make you behave like that because there are certain young people that are coming up they are looking at the order in the message they expecting you to be the guide they expecting you to give us an example how to talk how to behave how to dress how to [Music] react stay by the medens that are under the reaper Hallelujah brother Bram says this the minister has got a place of Duty to stand and preach the searchable Riches of Christ without what if he's called to be a preacher he will not spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher and the member of the church the maiden he's called to be a member of this certain group then he will not do what so not only does the minister do not have to compromise you also don't have to compromise if the church believe that we should not gamble then you the member of spoken word Tabernacle you should not what not play not play you cannot even touch it do you follow me if you we do not believe on certain clo clothing young sister s under government clothing you are not even supposed to touch [Music] them I will hand that later you should not touch a deck of a card we don't believe in what you should not turn you should turn his head completely from what not go touch drinking when you see it you turn around this way why do you still wear high here help us why do you still wear dresses that are here help us Lord why are you still coming late to church why you don't come to church why do you still driving around young people in the same car you not married why everybody here if we do do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of this church should what never do what never if you did it know before that's fine once it's unfolded on a pit you should never do it if you struggling at least for respect fear God Amen you say father I still like it but because your word say I'm going to take it [Music] away I will show you how to serve everybody C give God God gives complete deliverance he will do it if we shall completely what surr ourself to what the problem is we don't want to let go we want to serve God in the message but be cool because it seems like the message people are they don't have fun everybody okay if we will completely deliver ourself into his hand then God can live in US cross the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us as we get oursel out of the water the program The Blueprint you must be on bers boas work with the chief Reaper and the chief Reaper have Reapers under him and those Reapers have menen that are reflecting boas through the chief Reaper through the Reapers under the word of God that is the program of boas everybody now those Kindles stick we spoke again that they were beat work what has beat work speaks right around I'm say but the only but not only is the Candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold hand grafted beat gold according to her blueprint which were spirit-given outside of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as The Brood of Jesus Christ when you are living under your Candlestick remember you are working barefooted there is a suffering that goes with it there is a pain with sanctification sanc ation is not a easy process they got to put it in the hot water and boil everybody care surely she is filling up the suffering that Christ has what there is a measure of suffering her goods are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy she is accounted as a sheep for Slaughter she kill all day long she suffer much but it in uh in it all or retaliate not because God is working on your character neither that shos areed to do what worthy of the Gospel is this lovely bread of Christ and the gold is malleable whereas bras will break with the water this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord Not Bow not compromise not broken you're not going to quit not destroy but for as a thing of what and joy Forever by there and the testing of what it is on your path of way of life what brother digs was ministering everybody here according to Paul God has left his church a measure of what suffering but their faith in God while suffering for him will come to a place of what the Bible say my brethen count it all joy when you fall in diverse Temptation knowing this that the trying of your remember Peter are pay for your faith amen because you were under justify and sanctification now God is working on that Faith before he seals it everybody the trying of your faith work what but let patience have her perfect work that he may be perfect and entire wanting what it's a time of preparation Roman unless we suffer with him we cannot what remember when you under sanctification this is the Tabernacle you already finished justification with the Brazen Altar and a lever now we are here God is trying to bring you into the holiest because over there this is where the king is that's right God is trying to get you in a place where you will begin to rain yes sir but to get you to that place because the Bible says when the Holy Ghost come on you he will give you power do you remember that do you know that it's on act 1 ver8 the Bible say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come on you and God cannot give you power if your character is not correct how many have the Holy Ghost your character is how you claim to have the Holy Ghost unless we suffer with him we cannot what you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without water that's why rof have to serve Why didn't boas stop the serving of rof and say rof I already heard about you you know what you a virtuous woman no more work if you notice Bo has never done that he say I already heard about you I'm giving you instruction stay in this field don't go anywhere but continue to work he didn't take the work off of roof why because that work will create character everybody okay so far brother theam say a man without character character is a victory it's not a gift a man without character cannot because power apart from character is what but Power with character is fit to rule so since he want us to share even his what the holy of holiest on the same basis that he overcome and sit down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him you got to work until bers look and say that's what I want now push him here then I'm going to seal it everybody here and if you notice when the roof came the Bible say Naomi returned and roof the Moab as her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab they came to Bethlehem when in the beginning of the barley Harvest they just start working and you think boas would look and say this woman travels so long she she's already a good woman let her go Bo I say uh-uh you came right on time now you're going to jump into the work you're going to start working suffering how can you make a woman that you want to marry suffer you want to marry her normally we understand if you marry her you make everything good flower in the morning flower in the mailbox flower everywhere flower everywhere flower everywhere not Bas the flower are there but they are in the holiest I want to get your character first because if I give you what I have with our character you're not going to serve me everybody okay oh God give me a million dollars you don't come to church you don't give your tth and you want a million dollar no he's not going to give it to you and the one that give more it looks like God is keep giving him more there is a law in the scripture on that there is a law in the scripture let's leave Prosperity let's get into this and rof the Mo B say he said unto me also th shall keep first with my young men the reaper until they have what all the what you stay there until you plateau your sanctification you got a complete sanctification all the way not halfway all the way everybody here and Naomi say unto Ruth daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that that go out with his menen stay with those churches that they meet did not in another field on Tik Tok on YouTube when nobody's there quit listening to motivational speaker and I'm going to say this with respect even motivational speakers among the message right preach like Baptist everybody okay so keep fast by the maidens of boas so she kept fast roof by the maidens of boas to glean unto the end of what barley Harvest and what roof stays until the end of the Harvest why do you want to make her work until the end a character must be formed amen so now we have completed the Candlestick what is going on with rof interacting with the table of the showbread you want me stop or if you want to continue what is going on with the table of the showbread you need to stay alert now this is a different territory let me see where I am I'm good everybody here roof under the golden alar you understand your prayer life roof under the program of the Candlestick you must be under the messenger of the age and you must find a pastor that is line up with that messenger and you find you must find the church that believe the message correctly if that church compromise on the message you need to leave that church and you need to find another another church yes sir if you need to move you got to move you got to pray and go to another state versus keeping your job and having a lot of money but dying spiritually because you don't want to move where there is a good church everybody okay roof under the table of the showbread let me remind you this that the death of Malon was important but it was not at the death of Malon that move Naomi and roof what move Naomi and roof is what bread what is upon the table of the showbread everybody okay so far put your seat belt as I'm moving everybody here there is an asteroid I'm going to try to do this everybody okay everybody okay all righty what is going on with the table of the showbread my friend on the computer you ready yeah praise God watch what's going on the table of the showbread brother Bram says hallelujah amen how the hob keep faster on the computer so you can read this at home I'm trying to get to the main point the Hass and Cedarwood and all mixing together how they W in the Tabernacle had the what we already talk about Kama and the what we already talked about it K and the what this is where we are everything pointed toist the Bri Christ the L Christ the showbread crust they came to Seck chrust but which crust which message behind the crust everybody here the chist under the showbread or the Christ under the altar the braen altar is not the same Christ under the lab but it's still the same person amen the message that Christ is giving you under the Bren altar is not the same message that he's giving you under the L under the braen AL must want you to remember him that he died on the cross for you that he paid the price for you that you must give your life for him you must confess your sin you must repent you must remember that you a sinner born in sex shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking lies and Christ under the lever he want you to get baptized and Christ under the altar of says he want you in prayer and Christ under the Candlestick he want you under your messenger under your pastor who is under the messenger and under a church who is under a pastor that is under the messenger is it okay now you like it now now what is my chist under the showbread you love it now I summarize everything praise God hallelujah what is the CR standard the showbread brother the Bible says this in number four you okay put your seat belt if you can decrease the moving I don't want to lose you there is an asteroid you're going to feel the the airplane doing this and sometime I'm doing this I'm just avoiding asteroid okay you okay I'm in the space my friend you ready let's go when the camp set forward when Israel was moving with the camp temp everybody God say Aaron shall come and his son and they shall take down the covering Veil and cover the Ark of the testimony with it and shall put there on the covering of the bares skin and shall spread it with a cloth holy of which color blue fine so when Israel move they got to break down the Tabernacle and the priest got a Buri uh carried and when they breaking down the Bible says upon the table The Mystery of the table of the sh bread upon the table of the Sho bread they shall spread a cloth of which color just like the ark you understand and put there on the what and the what and the what and they cover and they continue shall be what this bread is how in other word the table of the showbread follow me carefully can never be separated from the bread everybody okay the table of the showbread can never be empty when you see that table automatically they must be Bread on that table everybody here it is like the alt of the Covenant amen because inside the Ark of the Covenant we have Mana you cannot carry the ark without carrying the Mana if the ark is moving the Mana is moving with the ark everybody here and the bread upon the sh bread were also like the Mana when you move the table you move the bread in other words the bread will always continue every time time upon the table in other word if there is no bread in Israel if you go in the temple they must be bread over there everybody here why did David flee going to the temple looking for food because under emergency there is only one place that will never lack bread everybody under the emergency you need running a certain place that place is guaranteed 24 hours 7 days a week 365 days a year there is a bread there continually even if you see the priest moving in the in the desert like this just know behind there there is bread Hallelujah the mystery of the table of the showbread number one the bread are always connected to the table anybody C praise God where are we going my friend so we've bring we I spoke about the ark and the table of the showbread and I gave you the ark here and the table of the showbread Hallelujah you ready yes brother Bram says this you need this you really need this the old Brides skin we found out behind inside of there was the word and the word there was also the showbread something is not working correct why is he not working correct before somebody tell you say thisam say this what is not working correct this is the Tabernacle follow me very well and we have the three places of the Tabernacle when you end enter what do you see the Brazen alt what follows it the L when you enter the holy what do you see on the south and what do you see here T of the showbread what do you see here and here only thing we have is what the ark with its lead the mercy it brother Bram is saying that when you enter here you see the showbread but we know the show bread is where in the Holy Place why is brother Bram putting the show bread in the holiest follow me very carefully this will help you whenever you will listen to the message the unveiling of God and everything it will remove all the confusion brother bam say the word is a seed and it cannot bring forth until the sun strick it the son has got to be upon the seed to make it be or to make it comfort that is the only way you take the word take the word of God in your heart and walk into the what which is the holiest and when you do that he shall bring forth what which is what that is only given for the what separ people the showbread was not in the holiest place but the problem is brother Bram is calling the showbread manner who's saying the truth brother br Bible but the message we know it's always what is wrong here that's why you need to study the message you ready what's going on brother Steven in Exodus chapter 16 follow me carefully the Bible says when the children of Israel saw it they say one to another it is what when they came up in the morning they look they say it's Mana they gave the name Mana everybody here for they wish not what he was they didn't know what it was God told them I'm going to give you food bread they came up they say what is this food Mana everybody here and Moses say unto them this is the what bread so Mana is a bread did that miss somebody Mana is also Al a bread and the table of the shoe Bread have what this is the bread which the Lord has given you to do whatat in Exodus 16:31 the Bible says the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like corander seed white and tasted the taste of it was like what wafer made with what what the bread of the Holy place the holiest was mana and Mana tasted like honey not the showbread the showbread didn't have honey I'm going to go slowly the honey is on the bread that is in the holiest follow me carefully follow me carefully everybody okay number 117 the Mana was a coriander seed right here and the color thereof was the color of delium and the people went about and gather it and did what ground it in the mill and did what in the mortar and did what bake it with pan and did what off it and it taste and the taste of it was as the taste of what oil and honey both of them in the Mana and the Mana have to be worked on and baked into a cake the Mana have to be baked into a cake that tasted like honey you know what honey means and then oil everybody okay everybody okay that is the Mana everybody here in other word in the Tabernacle we have two bread did you get me in the Tabernacle we have two bread and both bread are carried upon certain things the first bread is the sh bread everybody here and the second bread is the Mana when you carry the ark when you move the Mana is moving when you go back the Mana is going back when you move forward the man is moving forward when you carry the table you move the bread are moving you go back the bread are moving you go up the bread are move because they always connected everybody okay why is brother Bram calling that the same brother Bram give me some explanation hidden manner which is in the holiest let's give the interpretation the best we can what do hidden Mana tap what does he do what not to what he is what he hidden Mana was the Mana that was kept or a what in what everybody okay but the Bram was calling the Mana show bread in type because Mana was also bread go back and listen to the uning of God now your eyes will be open Hidden manner show bread in the Bible that was only for the what they had the bread for the congregation but there was a special bread for the common bread and hollow bread this is a special bread a special bread hidden what what is it who is our Mana who the six uh John 6 Jesus say the bread I am the bread of life that came out of what the what tartarian churches brother I'm say now we got to find also the hidden manner the hidden Mana is what tap to what the hidden Mana is not the showbread but it is T as the showbread because the shortbread and the Mana both of them are bread that's why I brought the Bram sometime will call the Mana the showbread in type you okay now everybody okay the show bread was for the priest alone the show bread was just for The Who so now we understand that in the Tabernacle you have bread in the table of the showbread and you also have bread in the what in the ark right here the priest who was entering could eat but in the Holy Place only the high priest can go and eat the everybody okay now praise God hallelujah you ready you ready Lord help me tighten up pretty good the asteroid is coming now you okay you okay Shake somebody's hand because somebody's like this thank you yes sir okay okay praise God all right let's focus I know all your position some have a PhD everybody here everybody here now this table of the showbread is connected to the Ark in other words to understand the show bread you need to see the Ark of the Covenant am everybody okay why because we found out that the ark it's made exactly like the showbread shood sh M gold gold he have a crown he have a crown so if you understand one it will help you understanding the next one amen everybody okay the mystery of the table of the showbread you ready according to Moses God told him that the showbread table must be the length thereof how much. no two everybody okay look at your board there look right there two Cubit the left everybody here and the breath was what and the height was what everybody okay now the ark the length was what and the breath was what and the height was what if you notice the height of the table and the height of the Ark are the same everybody okay the height and the height are the same the difference between the Ark of the Covenant and the difference between the table is the difference goes with the length and the bread everybody okay stay in tuned the length of the Ark is 2.5 everybody okay the length of the table is two 2.5 - 2 equal what the breath of the Ark is 1.5 and the breath of the table is one 1.5 - 1 is what so the difference between the Ark of the Covenant and the table of the showbread is only a half this is Christ this is Christ the difference between this Christ and this Christ is 1.5 which is half everybody okay what does he mean brother Bram say it's been through the F test friend don't believe but thank God we are still on the Victorious side today because we are in Who and the what has never yet been what everybody okay everybody okay so when you are in the Justified state in the Tabernacle and you eating the bread you don't eat all the bread you are only eating half there is another half that you have not touched yet did I lose somebody if I lost you raise your hand praise God everybody K the measurement of the table and the AR the difference is half everybody so when you eating on the table of the showbread you are missing half of Christ because the table have bread and the AR also have bread everybody here you eating bread here but there is another type of bread that you don't eat yet it belongs to the high priest but the our high priest his name is who Jesus Christ so you need to move on to Jesus so Jesus can give you the other half so staying in the Holy place you don't know anything yet you know half of it you need to move into the holiest for you to know Christ in his completeness everybody okay so far everybody okay so far brother Bram say how do you know this half he say it is in the what you are still in the Holy Place everybody watch it when he comes out in the so the other half is in a great seal everybody what you getting here is half you need to go to the Great Seal and the Great Seal have the other half Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you ready oh my God Lord help me uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh I need this you have time blessed be the name of the Lord Brother bam say that there seven rainbows seven colors I meant seven colors of the rainbow when we look at the rainbow the rainbow looks like this he have seven colors everybody okay brother Robert don't betray me he said that meant seven what seven bows which are seven whates what was under the Candlestick seven what churches seven churches in the Holy place under the Candlestick seven churches Hall you need a prophet my friend seven churches reflecting seven what which is the Seven Stars everybody here each light wrap into the other one they overlapping the first color is what the second is what and the other one and the other one and the other one and the other one and the other one seven colors I'm not going to get there let me Dodge that everybody okay God in his seven color rainbow his Covenant that he made a covenant that through seven Church ages the seven colors he would save the what praise God everybody okay brother bam say this rainbow only is what hor horizontal doesn't mean that the rainbow is flat this is vertical this is horizontal horizontal because the rainbow is pain like this everybody that's why it's horizontal rainbow so when I say in this church horizontal rainbow don't say don't think it's something like strange because preacher comes the horizontal rainbow and you like what is the horizontal it's just the rainbow you see everybody here try to complicate the message everybody here this rainbow only horizontal just cover in a what what everybody okay the rainbow if you come outside after rain it's always half and this half is the seven Church Ages which are the seven golden Candlestick in the Holy place but we find out that the the ark which is in the holiest have another half that has not been told you everybody okay blessed be the realy of the Lord that is our rainbow all know as rainbow colored just half of the earth he was in the that is all you can see but when John saw him in his Emerald he surrendered the whole what open Revelation 4 Lord help me help me help me please Lord help me let's go to Revelation 4 hallelujah amen if you want to put it down you can read the home Ezekiel 1: 128 I'm trying to save time Ezekiel 1: 128 it will tell you the same thing but let's go to Revelation 4 for the sake of time you there verse two and immediately I was in the what in the spirit and behold a what where is the Throne of God where God in the Tabernacle God was sitting between the Caribbean the mercy seat right that was the Caribbean and God was in the middle so the Throne of God was on The Mercy Seat everybody okay everybody okay on the mercy seat in the holiest place this is where John is looking at the Tabernacle in heaven and John say that in the spirit Behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne everybody and he that sat was to look like a what Jasper and a sing Stone and there was a rainbow what so in heaven when John went and enter the heaven then he found a throne and somebody sitting on the throne and a Mor this person was a rainbow not an arc but he was all around 360 rainbow everybody here but in the time of Noah he was only half which brother Bram say half symbolizes the church ages because the half has not been yet where is the other half everybody here brother bam say the Earth just make a KN oh no sorry but when John saw him in Emerald color he surrounded the water the half has never yet been what the first half is already revealed we don't know where is the other half but when John get in heaven he see a man fully covered but but on the earth we only have half because another half is missing everybody here he said the Earth just make an ark it's just a half of it that is the what the Candlestick in the Holy Place everybody here but when John saw him in this Ember color the Ember color he surrender and cover around like a what a Halo of am color and he surrendered his being one color one God over all through all in all but there is what everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so where is the other half here that is missing go to Revelation 10 everybody okay everybody okay the half is the seven Church ages you get that and the showbread everybody here remember the Candlestick were sending light to who to the table of the sh everybody care the light of the Candlestick were shining on the table of the sh they only give you half everybody here but there is another half it is not in the Candlestick it is hidden somewhere in the holiest everybody clear that's why the ark was half Cubit bigger than the table everybody here Revelation 10:1 and I saw an ad might Angel come down from what cloth with a water and a what was upon his water did you see a rainbow round about only what only what the missing the missing House That Never Was t now when the book is open when the book is open when the seals are broken God have to release the second [Music] half everybody okay everybody okay we have the teaching on the seven Church ages everybody Luther preach but when Paul preach Paul say I preach in part you remember that because half was not yet been told when arenus preach they was losen when colomba preached they were losen when Martin preach they were losing when lther preach they were losing when Wes preach they were things missing when the Pentecost preached they thought they got the Holy Ghost they were only the Shar there were things missing but when Malachi fall came when the seven seal was open they losen the missing part that was missing through the edges that's why the constellation have seven angels the missing part of Paul the missing part of colba the missing part of Martin the missing part of Luther the missing part of Wesley all those part mix together and give the head of Christ the King himself everybody that's why brother Bram say when he entered the constellation the six Angel were familiar to him because they were used they were used by the messenger but there was one that brother Bram said this is the one I was looking for the one with a chest like this it was never been preached before he was never told yet it is the missing rainbow that came down on Revelation 10 with a book now revealing the seal bringing the word in the completeness now today we have the full word of God we have the sh bread and we have the Ark of the Covenant all of them put together [Applause] Hallelujah do you want me to continue or stop here do you want me to continue or stop here you want me to continue or [Applause] stop the mystery check the the sign my friend The Mystery of the table of the showbread everybody here let me skip this let me skip this because of time let me skip this let me get you to this amen now the table of the showbread when you look into this you have six bread here 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 there's six bread there and if you notice those six bread are placed in two rows we okay where do you get six where do you get 12 in Leviticus 24 the Bible say thatou shall take fine flour and do what how many bread the Mana when he was baked he was making cake you remember now the table of the showbread Lord help me amen I have two hours to squeeze concentrated milk everybody here not skim milk concentrated milk when the children take it you you see them waking up in the morning they have energy all the time you see a baby walking up and he start mov and momy is tired like all this day this child is still moving it is the milk he's getting it is not skin milk they wake up in the morning and they start jumping and you see people in the message like this I wonder which milk are you getting everybody here we have 12 cake 12 is the number of what thank you Jesus and 12 cake two 10th deal shall be in one cake Lord help me and they shall set them in how many row two row six in a row upon a pure upon the pure what so how many row do we have six six six is a number of what and six is a number of what it seems like there are two men on this table everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay relax and that shall put pure what roof roof everybody that shall put pure frence upon each Ro that he may be on the bread so this bread have frankincense in all of it why they have to put frankincense on the bread because roof in is under the witch everybody here for a memorial even an offering made by fire unto the Lord every what shall you what in order before the so when do we change the bread on which day which day do they change the bread on the Sabbath day which is which day the seventh day which day did David get to the Tabernacle and they just changed the bread amen they just changed the bread which day was David in the Tabernacle on the on the seventh day after three days he's on the seventh the three work of Grace Luther Wesley Pentecost then he's on the seventh day did I lose you did I lose you first church age second Church Age 3 4 5 6 7 everybody justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost David say we were how many days one 2 3 and David was in which day everybody okay so far everybody okay so far did I lose somebody Hallelujah he says and it shall be Aon send his son that eat it and they shall eat it in the Holy place you don't take it outside oh wow for It's the Most Holy unto him of the offering of the Lord made by fire the top one in 1 Chronicle 9:32 the son of the katat which are Li were off the shoe bread to prepare it every what so the preparation of the bread and the changing of the bread was buff done on the seventh day so on the seventh day they got to take take the old bread out and they got to put fresh new bread and when they put fresh new bread a sword will come to bring the half everybody okay everybody okay what does he mean brother bam say gram is six Le six is the number of men men's day but the seven is the number of what God number seven day God did what so the seven is missing so the table of the showbread in the Holy place is not complete amen because you still under number six on the holy place you're not completed yet your Redemption is not completed yet you need another step further and it will put you on the seventh day everybody clear Hallelujah brother Bram say and six is the number of the what creation and what the snake is still there everybody okay we will show you how to handle the snake well brother Bram said the little animal I saw was 6 in Long the string of Dove that Mom so was six six is what your Redemption is not finished yet when you are in the Holy place you don't have the Holy Ghost yet everybody I know that someday I shall see the S one that was man number six which means what rof is suffering the beating of the Candlestick the suffering for character it's under number six under man so it's a bread that when you take you have suffering that's right everybody okay but it's not the half bread because the half taste like honey the half bread in the holiest taste like honey and when John was given the book he put it in his mouth he tasted like what because it was the second half of the rainbow everybody okay everybody okay Hallelujah Jesus said the hour cometh when it shall nether be in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem to do what number 12 to worship the father but the hour cometh now that the true what number 12 shall worship ship number 12 the father how in what and in what Tru for the father seeketh such to worship Him number 12 for we being many are what am I reading a different Bible and one what for we are all partaker of that what we talking about the blood of Jesus Christ everybody what does he mean brother Bram say the fourth mystery of the New Testament is the mystery of the New Testament Church as one body composed of what you remember the body of Samaritan and we found one row was how many bread and another row was how many bread and they were under the Candlestick speaking of the Church of Jesus Christ composed of two kind of men the Jews and the Gentile that are eating the bread of God in the blood of Jesus Christ did I lose you did I use you under the blood of Jesus Christ under the seven Church ages it's not only Gentile we have Jews and Gentile you got six the number of men and six the number of men both of them are eating the same bread under the same candles s and they are part of the same Brad The Mystery of the table of the showbread Paul say the genter should be fellow her of the same and partaker of his promise in Christ by the what in Ephesian 2 the Bible says at that time we Gentile we were without what we were alien from the common wealth of what we were stranger from the Covenant of the water we have having what and without what but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were Gentile off we are made what n by the blood of who for he is our and who made both what both the Jew and the Gentile he put them on the same table one and had broken down the water the m a wall of partition now rof a gent can can enter the field of boas and she can glean like the women of the Jew so the field of Boas have Jewish women and Gentile women in one field the table of the showbread number six and number six on the same table Hallelujah having abolish in his flesh the enmity everybody even the law of commandment containing ordinance for to make in himself of the what the do what one bread so making what that he might reconcile both unto God in how many body because we are one bread by the what raing slain the enmity what so in the blood of Jesus Christ we have melchisedek Jews and Gentile Ruth and the menen of Israel they are both in the same field under the mystery of the table of the showbread everybody care so far everybody so far and the show bread was change what every what Sabbath day brother bam says from the 50 days will be exactly Sabbath and seven Sabbath represent the what the Feast of Pentecost have 50 days 7 * 7 is 49 and the 50th day was the day of Jubilee everybody here so you have seven s 7 7 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and the 50th day was the day of Jubilee and brother Bram say every seven everybody here it's a church age the second seven is a church age because in the tabernac every Sabbath they change the bread everybody here after 7 they change the bread after 7 they change the bread after 7 they change the showbread after seven the message are changing because they under the Candlestick the Candlestick is shining on the bread and every seven they have to change the message and put another message under the Candlestick and they change the message and they put another message every Sabbath every seven every seven every Church AG they are changing until one day David came on the seven Church ages when they just changed the bread because the Pentecostal message have to be removed they have to put fresh bread now Hallelujah brother Bram said the seventh Sabbath is the seven Church ages let me call move forward you can read this at home Hallelujah the Bible says this that Jesus said I am the living bread which came down from what if a man eat this bread he shall live what forever and the bread that I will give you is my flesh which I give for the life of the water now brother pram say your old husband must be dead roof that's right your new husband is the what a bread seven days do shall eat 11 11 water seven days what does that typify they complete what church seven Church ages why why had they have to eat it seven days before what before going out and the whole church age from the beginning to the end has to live only by the word of God for that the Candlestick shining on the table every seven new bread new message Luther new message Wesley new message columus new message they changing the bread every Sabbath day but it's going to be unle bread they cannot be seen in that leav everybody care so far and then we found that the 11 those bread must have frankincense on them brother Bram say frankincense is the offering of a service to who that's why rof have to work everybody here if you want to put this scripture down Leviticus 2:2 and Leviticus 6 6-5 we found out that is the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah when he made the offering he had to be made and mixed with what Frankin says for a sin offering they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering Frankin sin was added because he was acceptable to Jehovah if he was what Anointed with frankeny so when the priest was putting frankeny the priest was anointed anointing the bread with service everybody okay Frank which mean the service to who Jehovah and they brought him frankincense was a tap that he was a service to who Jesus is Jehovah's servant everybody brother Bram says this he said in s Matthew 12 15-2 one we found out that he was Jehovah's servant because the Bible say behold my servant which was Jesus in whom I'm well what and I put my strength upon him so his life was anointed with what to Jehovah's as a what so the bread you are receiving from the messenger is the food that God gave you so that the food can put you in service for God that's why woff was under service everybody here let me go to the airport oh my God let me go to the airport if you notice here we have what a crown here how many Crown do we have I'm heading to the airport your prayer will be answered my friend everybody here how many Crown do we have in the ark one how many Crown do we have in the in the table two in the table we got two crowns we got also two crown and those two Crown we also have two rows and if you remember the crown was like a border right and the crown was separated by a hand breath do you remember that what does hand breath means everybody here Psalm 39 David say Lord make me know my end and the what David want to know the measure of his day on Earth what it is that I may know how FR I am behold th has made my day as a what so the hand breath is the measure of your life on Earth everybody okay everybody okay and the two Crown have to be separated by a hand breath everybody in other word David is saying that my life in Earth is short that's why job says that man that is born of a woman is of what which represented what the hand breath but thank God why thanking God everybody here because Jesus say I I am the bread of life that came from what that a man eateth and do what you will live forever because David by the hand breath it is showing the shortness of a human life because life is no more eternal men sin and because of sin we begin to die so we needed a bread that when we eat that bread will give us eternal life and it will s the hand breath of man and we won't die anymore I know now it's sping on someone everybody okay the crown on the Ark of the Covenant how many Crown you do have who do we Crown King so it seems like we got two kings there and here we got one king right right yes sir why brother Bram brother Bram say they put a crown on it on the ark why he was the what what did that gold crown laying on top of that box means it means that here with that gold laying over it Humanity was covered with God blood sprinkling on top of it and a crown was laying there so the crown on the ark brother Bram say because he was a King Jesus was 100% man and he was a 100% God he was Humanity cover with deity and they put a crown of him everybody clear brother Ram said the Gold Crown does that represent Christ yes when Christ was here on Earth he was crowned with the crown of thorn to shed the blood that's right but every believer that come through the shed blood pull forth the crown of thorn and crown him with what Glory of praises and what every believer that Step In The Presence the holiest of holiest accept that blood from his breast BR with tone and crown him glory and praise and what he crown him as what so the crown in the Ark of the Covenant is a crown of Jesus as king of King it's only one Crown everybody here everybody here get this one so I have to stop somewhere brother Bram in the message melkisedek he says melkisedek was what everybody now in Hebrew 2 he was king of righteousness and king of what king of Salem Paul say MEC king of righteousness and MC king of Salem how many kings he is how many King on the table of the showbread how many [Music] Crown the two Crown represented MEC who was king of Salem and king of righteousness because under the seven Church ages we under the lineage of MC thank you Lord but you don't stop there because m was a theop God have to enter in human flesh for God to enter in human flesh by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must go in the holiest of holiest and there he's going to be crowned king of King everybody okay king of righteousness king of Peace he is to King now since he has come in the flesh and receive his body up he is called what the holiest he is all three of them one Crown two Crown King God King theophan King Jesus he is king of what all comes to make what king of righteousness the spirit toopan king of Peace In the Flesh he was what king oface under the seven Church ages when you eating the messenger the bread from the messenger you under the meis clean but you are number six you are incomplete you need to move on number seven and when God enter in human flesh the Holy Spirit enter in you and baptize you you are now crowning Jesus Christ as king of King amen everybody care so far everybody care so far I have to stop here after the similitude of melchisedek there riseth another priest who has made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of what why he have to be melchisedek on the table of the sh because the lineage of melchisedec is a lineage of eternal life because the old priest were dying they were changing the high priest because of death everybody but when Jesus Christ came he doesn't die anymore he have a power of endless life that's what he say here they have to change the king the the the priesthood but after the power of handl life truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of what it was only a hand breath but this man because he continue forever that's why we need to be under the table of the showbread because under that table MEC bring eternal life and that hand if you notice it was a hand breath which was the shortness of her life MC take it together by being king of righteousness and king of Peace when he takes you he give you eternal life you won't die anymore even if you they take you to the Grave you are leing somewhere else and one day when the trumpet will come you will leave where you are you're going to jum here and pick up your body and you're going to stand up again because you ate bread for MEC king of righteousness and king of uh peace both King taking care of the shortness of breath of human life The Mystery of the table of the sh let's stop here let's stand folks you need to go home and review [Music] this because if I drop what is coming up again it will spill over everybody here you must follow God according to his plan according to his program that's how you must serve God amen amen amen am you must serve him according to the to his messenger and make sure you're eating the bread that has been illuminated by the messenger because when you're taking the message of your age that is change every Sabbath that message will when you eat it when you begin to obey the message and taking the message into your life then things will begin to change in your life because the message is Anointed to put you in CC and you eating the unfailing body word of the son of man amen you still under six in complete you got to move into the holiest it's a lot let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we thank you for the people and the sacrifice that they made to let me go all the way to this place Lord father many things has been dropped and spoken but father you can take your children and unfold more than what was spoken here because you know what is behind the concept that has been brought up this word that you given them it's moral father than Natural Life father if somebody is not even in this holy Place may they understand that it's important because the holy place is a place of preparation to prepare them so that the king can come and seal them and this bread is a bread that is coming to remove every habit every bad habit every bad thing in our life it's a bread of pain and that's where the message get tough sometime and the people having hard time because the message begin to chop off the high heel chop off the earring chop off everything that is not like Christ chop off the high temper chop off the Bad Habit removing everything because the king now is coming and he want to seal and he will not seal any box Lord father that is not set properly and in order father May your children understand the importance of staying in order with the instruction that were given by the messenger may they understand Lord that this is not a law even though the serving father is reflecting a legalistic aspect but Lord we will unfold that as you given us Grace Lord so that your children will understand how does Lord work Lord father under the holy place but for the meanwhile father may you help them understand that there must be a reflection of what has been preached here because there is a roof that is watching somewhere there is a roof that is looking at you work there is a roof that could be in your neighborhood that you don't know that your life has been a light for that roof and one of these day because of you they're going to thirst as the salt is giving them thirst until they want want to be like you and father we're going to guide them to the Plan of Redemption Lord we thank you and commit them unto theiry hand may you continue with them throughout the week Lord and make them consecrated Lord father their life more and more as we continue to move on this series as we humbly
