god richly bless you maybe someday the lord will open up the door amen so you can minister for us blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy the worship service i really like it amen just uh remember sister bridgenet in prayer the family brother mike dally sister bridgenet is here tonight despite everything that happened she's not in the other court amen she is not in the other court for sure because she's here tonight she lost her brother in jamaica so you keep the family in prayer and despite the loss in the family she's here pressing on so the family especially mom needs your prayer so just remember them in prayer so everything the funeral will be coordinated well amen blessed be the name of the lord brother jim is not here but i believe brother robert the building fund is this coming sunday right yes so the building fund remember this coming sunday lords willing amen sister priscilla when you got involved in a car wreck any scratch any problem any pain did you hear those answers so what do you think happened it's a time of change it was a time of change she loved that car so much and the change have to come in a brutal way saving her life by just swapping cars and giving her a better car than what she had before so all things work together for what so sometimes your trials are just blessing in disgustment you think it's a trial but it's not really a trial because she's there without a scratch without any pain god just swapped the car in a different way amen the language of god is different sometimes but he all work amen blessed be the name of the lord everybody okay with the showbread anybody lost you good okay praise god okay praise god i went home and i thought it was really really heavy and then you have to go back the second time and then review and make sure because a lot of stuff will drop quickly but i have to stop where i have to stop so we didn't even touch on the drink offering to see the drink offering on the table of the show bread so you keep keep us in prayer and we know the lord will certainly open the door again so we can take where we are and keep moving until we get in the holiest but from now you can already see and have a taste of what is in the holy of holi amen they have have not yet been told so now you understand if you really want to get that half you got to go somewhere amen because if you stay in the holy place you can understand the message intellectually okay we will handle that on sunday amen lord's willing we'll handle that on sunday somebody asked me a great question either yesterday or today i'm not sure again but i wish that question was in uh in the [Music] uh house meeting but it's very very very important he asked a question he's he was reading the book of jos uh the story of joseph and suddenly when you start the story you usually expect the story to flow from the beginning all the way to the end then in genesis i believe 38 the story stopped and went to judah and begin to talk like in and out of another story so it seems like you start joseph and you're following joseph when you reach genesis 38 you stop there then it's speaking about judah going to tamar you know the story about tamar and everything and if you look at the connection there is no connection between judah and joseph at all then after genesis 38 in genesis 39 then the bible pick up again and begin to speak about joseph again so it looks like there is a chapter that was inserted somewhere that doesn't really look like it should be amen okay i gave you a homework i see some of you look at me you give your homework you go read the story of joseph and you'll find that genesis chapter 38 seems to be like it's odd it's not in a proper place but it is in the proper place amen the scriptures are mathematically placed in the scripture if you need the quote i will show you brother branham say there are the the bible have some mathematics that goes with it so what seems to be like it's out of place it's really a revelation that it was inserted there if you study you will go with genesis leviticus numbers you get to judges if you study the process of the event the event goes well until a certain time roof is inserted if you look you look like they're taking you off from the story of israel to another land then after roof then the go back again to the promised land with first samuel and then they begin to introduce the first king of israel then it goes to the chronicle and you will wonder why is roof inserted right there it looks like roof came and then it's like a bracket in a scripture that the cut the scripture left and right and they insert something there those things are inserted for a certain way amen let me give you one so he can't help you up if you go in revelation chapter six you will see the open all the seals except the seven seal have you noticed that if you go to revelation chapter six you will see the first seal is open the second city is open the third is open the fourth is open the six is open and you will think the seven will be open there then when you reach the end there is no seven seal then when you go to revelation chapter seven you will think you will expect the seventh seal to be there it's not there and then when you go to revelation eight then you see the seventh cell so why is the seven entered there why why is that separation it's things that are hidden in the scripture so i'm saying that so to kind of stir you up so you can go home and review some of you are lost because you don't read the bible the way you're supposed to some are reading the bible they open here they close they open here the clothes they open here the clothes that's all they do you don't read the bible like that sometimes take the book of genesis start from genesis 1 all the way to the end and you take leviticus all the way to the end amen you already we already went to exodus 25 and the tabernacle now whatever seems to be hard in the scripture you can begin to see that it's not hard there is message locked in the scripture amen so it's a great question lord's willing we'll see how we will handle it if we have time on our next question and answer amen so remember uh sister sending prayer and remember sister bridgenet in prayer and the family amen we got brother tim cross here tonight but tim cross is not a visitor he's a family member amen so when he's here he's home amen blessed be the name of the lord so we will sing only believe i don't have anything to introduce you know him well a wonderful brother wonderful minister i thought somebody who brought the team is preaching and they were already excited like wow so i knew already that the church is ready to receive something from the throne of god amen so brother tim you're home take your liberty we home preach like home only [Music] we believe all things are possible [Music] me [Music] can we sing lord i believe lord i believe is that your testimony tonight [Music] i know [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] amen you know if if we are believers and we are if you're wondering you wouldn't have come here tonight if you weren't a believer so the very fact that you're here is is testament but when we believe it's a guarantee we will receive amen so we greet you tonight in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ i want to thank brother seth coffey for coming with me this evening and uh my wife went over uh to her post of duty there at the home church but we bring greetings from brother josh and the believers there brother richie douglas asked me to give greetings to the believers tonight he's he's ministering where brother fred mullins pastors down in south carolina tonight and so god is good i want to invite you to turn with me in your bibles to ezekiel chapter 37 and as i uh i was getting close to coming out and i thought i've preached on from this passage of scripture before but it's got a maybe a new inspiration tonight and so we want the lord to minister in our midst and have his way and i wanted to tell you this too many of you have been praying for a situation with my wife and i to adopt a child and so at first uh you know we were just kind of keeping things uh to ourselves and then eventually the county became involved and they came they said we want to do a study of your home and so they sent a lady out and she interviewed me she interviewed sister faith she she looked all over the property in the home there and she called my wife last wednesday and she said faith that's my wife's name she said faith when we do a home study she said even under the best of circumstances we always try to find one weakness one thing that we can point to to ask the parents you know to improve upon this to make the situation ideal for the adoption she said in your case we find zero we find no weaknesses and so praise the lord for that amen you know uh we're not doing anything we're in the middle of what god is doing amen when you're pushing and you're pressing and you're doing all this relax when when when you're in the middle of what god is doing you're going to be amazed at what he does through you amen so we appreciate the lord tonight uh we're going to read here in ezekiel 37 beginning at verse number 11 and just before we read these verses of scripture we'd like to go to the author in prayer and if you're desiring something from the lord tonight you'd like to lift your hand in his presence we believe the lord will supply heavenly father we are grateful that we have strength lord and we have liberty and freedom to be able to come lord and we're thankful for a desire that you place there to come lord and join with other believers in lifting our voices and our hearts to you we're thankful lord that you promised where two or three are gathered you would be in our midst that's what we're depending on tonight that's what brought us here and lord as we now approach your word we know with some education we could read its contents but lord we want the contents to come from the pages lord and live in our lives and we want what only the holy spirit can do that's to come break the bread of life to our hearts we don't question that this is your word but we realize it takes a supernatural element lord to quicken this word into living word and we pray tonight lord as as that happens as that takes place it will bring spiritual healing it'll bring physical healing it'll lift the faith lord of your children to rise above the circumstances or whatever may appear to our natural senses but lord made the word appeal to that super sense lord to lay hold upon the promise lord and to walk into the realization of it granted tonight lord bless brother stephen and the believers lord and bless your children who have come some perhaps lord don't even know why they're here tonight but you do and we pray father god that your purpose and your desire for this service would fully express that i lord would not hinder may you forgive me lord may the blood of jesus christ right now atone for all of our sins our faults our iniquities our shortcomings lord we plead the blood of jesus christ over our lives and over this service tonight that all that is said and done will bring glory and honor to you that we may walk out of here tonight lord in liberty and in victory lord for your glory and honor we ask it in jesus name we pray amen verse 11 then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god now i want to ask you tonight what are you interested in what you say or what he says because we just read what they said but now we're going to read what he says thus saith the lord god behold all my people he's taking possession ownership behold my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you my spirit in you and you shall live and you shall i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord may the lord bless the reading of his word and you can be seated tonight amen i'm going to read i'm just going to jump right into this portion of a message called the revelation of jesus christ and the brother adam is talking about the book of revelation and he says it has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the bible it has more symbols because it is a book of prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand it hardly this book is made for a certain class of people over in on in deuteronomy it says the hidden things belong to the lord that is right and he reveals to us his children the hidden things oh my you're not making yourself one of his children you're recognizing what he has already made you amen the carnal mind cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them now he's talking about the bible he's not talking about his ministry he's not talking about his message he's talking about this bible and he says it's a foolish book it's a mysterious book it's a misunderstood book it's an argued book to everybody but one group or one class of people that's the bible now if that is the case with the bible then it would certainly be the case with the revelation of that bible which is revealed through the ministry of god's prophet william branham the carnal mind cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but to the ones who are lovers of the word of god that's who the book was written to that's the church the revelation of jesus christ to the church at ephesus to the church of smyrna to the church churches on death the revelation of jesus christ to the church you say which church brother tim the one he started in matthew 16 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and notice it is also the consummation of the scriptures the complete consummation and it's geographically placed at the right place at the end of the bible the revelation of the whole thing placed back here with a blessing to who hears it who reads it and hears it and a curse to them that'll add or take away so what i want to share with you tonight as we just move into this is a prophetic class of people is a people that have the ability amen to hear to recognize to be affected by and to respond to a prophetic ministry that's not everybody that's a special class that's a special group of people you know i i just think of the time when elijah was up in the mouth of the cave and he said lord you know i'm just i'm the only one left i'm the only believer and god said no you're not there's seven thousand that have not bowed the knee to bell amen god didn't just send you elijah i sent some followers amen i said you weren't just sent to make yourself the object or the show amen i sent a people who are predestinated with receivers down on the inside that when they hear your voice it's going to enact a response to prophecy they are a prophetic class of people amen i believe you're part of that tonight amen he said in peter first peter 2 verse 9 peter said but ye are a chosen generation and unholy nation a peculiar people you know young people get defeated they say brother tim i am different i'm odd i stand out you're supposed to you're not supposed to blend in with the world they're not supposed to be comfortable around you and you're not supposed to be comfortable around them and then why because you're from different origins and you have a different destination so there's a reason you're different and it's nothing to be ashamed of and the only reason that the devil's trying to shame you is because he's jealous of who you are what you have where you came from and where you're going so it's about time amen we lift our head up put our chin out and puff up our chest and say satan i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i came from god and i returned to god get out of my way you have to know who you are otherwise you're wishy-washy you're weak you're compromised you don't know who you are you wake up one morning you feel one way you wake up the next morning you feel another way and the devil pushes you around and bluffs you around like the weak little chicken you are but if you ever hear an eagle cry and you recognize that ain't the only eagle there's one down on the inside of here and you get up and fly out of that barnyard you're gonna show those chickens you never was a chicken in the first place amen hallelujah that little eagle never became an eagle he recognized what he had been the entire time and it took him here in the cry of another mature eagle and he said my goodness if one can do it i can do it too because the same potentials lie within you doesn't make every woman a prophetess doesn't make every man a preacher but it makes you a prophetic class of people hallelujah that have the ability to recognize and respond to prophecy so the prophecy has a unique effect upon you because when you hear it you're not hearing opinion you're not hearing an argument you're not hearing an enlightened view you're not hearing yet one more ministry you are hearing an absolute you are hearing a divine interpretation with divine vindication and i want to tell you that that vindication is not confined to what a camera could capture or what could be printed on a piece of paper or what could be engraved on a stone but that vindication is a living bride hallelujah with rapturing faith down on the inside and her life is being transformed by that word justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and rapture amen the rapture is not coming for books and tapes the rapture is not coming for perishable things the rapture is coming for the intangible value of who you are down on the inside you've already heard the shout out you're not waiting on a shout you recognize to shout the shout is what awakened you and you said i'm not a pentecostal i'm not a baptist i'm not a catholic and i'm not a sinner i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god these bones shall live again amen resurrection is not replacement it's bringing back to a divine order what was once in the mind of god before the foundation of the world as he came down and was wrapped in flesh now his word is wrapped in flesh in a many-membered body praise the lord i want to title this message tonight better than before [Music] [Laughter] better than before i go out to phelps kentucky that's coal mining country and out there they'll find cold deeply embedded in those hills and in those mountains they've got all manner of ways all sorts of ways to go extract that coal but they're also some legal parameters there are some legal guidelines that those mining companies have to follow one of the things they'll do is they'll go find a hill or find a big tall mountain and it's just full of coal that you know they can mine that coal out and turn it into electricity somehow but those mining companies have laws they have to follow they'll go in and they'll drill down in that mountain they'll drill drill drill drill drill and they'll blow it up and they'll get all that coal out i mean just truckload after truckload train load after train load a coal comes out of there but when they're done they can't leave it they can't leave it in that chaotic mess that they made to extract the coal there's something called reclaiming and there are federal and state laws that absolutely dictate to those mining companies they have to put the mountain back so first of all they had to know what it was in the first place so they've got geographical ways of measuring the height the breadth all the dimensions of that mountain they know what it is before they drill the first hole before they put off the first stick of dynamite they know exactly what that mountain is and so they have to reconstruct that mountain back to the exact dimensions that it was before they extracted the coal and there's state and federal authorities that will enforce that onto those mining companies to make them put it back the way it was before but here's the thing about it brother sister as far as what is humanly possible no matter how well to the to the eye to to our visibility no matter how much it looks like the mountain before i mean they have to put grass on it they have to plant trees there's all kinds of things they have to do so to you know to somebody just walking up to it it can look like it's been restored to everything that it was before but man is limited in his ability and what man cannot do is put the treasure back it may look like the same hill it may resemble everything it resembled before but it's missing the treasure it's missing the value it's missing the essence or the worth that it once held oh my which is why it was destroyed in the first place is because there was value on the inside that someone recognized and they were destroying the mountain to try to get the treasure out and you wonder why you're fighting and you wonder why you're struggling and you wonder why the devil's telling you why don't you give up why don't you quit why don't you just lay it down and walk away he's trying to destroy something because he knows there is value down on the inside of you and he's trying to tear your life apart amen he's telling you why don't you quit church why don't you leave the message amen why don't you just give up and go away you know you can't live it you know what a hypocrite you are he's trying to tear you apart because there's treasure down on the inside of you and he's trying to marginalize the effect the value of who you are in your own eyes [Music] before a man can ever take advantage of a woman he has to first destroy her self-esteem he has to first lower her worth and her value in her own eyes he can never physically overtake her until first of all he reduces her [Music] that's the devil doing that that's the devil trying to get you to lay down your morals trying to get you to lay down your values trying to tell you you gotta settle for something less you don't have to settle for less amen there is no peace achieved through compromise there is no victory achieved by backing up and making a deal with the devil we don't have to deal with the devil we are dealing with a defeated devil and what we've got to do is recognize the battle has already been won and we've got to stand our ground and say satan i didn't win this jesus christ did but i sure ain't backing up from it i'm not backing up for my healing i'm not backing up for my salvation i'm not backing up for my loved ones everything that book says i'm gonna stand on it hallelujah friends amen god has staked his reputation on your victory god's not wondering if you're going to make it god's not wondering if you're going to go victorious out of laodicea god's not wondering if you're going to make a rapture god has staked his eternal reputation on you amen hallelujah if you knew the truth tonight you know you already made it you know you're already an overcomer he's already seen you on the other side amen but satan cannot defile you till he first reduces your value in your own eyes [Music] amen so here let me just for a moment refer to my opening scripture god takes ezekiel out to this valley not only dead bones and dry bones but dismembered and disunified and scattered from the way they were originally joined together and then he asked his prophet a question can these bones live again and god wasn't just going to make them live again he was going to restore them back to their original order the way they were originally joined he was going to put bone back to his bone he was going to put sinew upon him he was gonna put skin upon him and they were gonna stand up and he was gonna breathe his spirit of life into those bones and they were gonna go out and defeat a new enemy enemies who had advanced in their weaponry and their armament and their strategy and their tactics these enemies had honed the craft of war to be more mighty more powerful and hate israel even more than they did in the beginning but we have this idea amongst our ranks today that our young people need a modernized holy ghost like we need to play some more modern music or we need to bring some some worldly themes into the church you know we need to attract our young people i'm going to tell you what's going to attract young people is reality we don't need a different holy ghost we need the same holy ghost that fell on the book of acts the same holy ghost will bring a body up out of the grave amen bring a dead body back together again with the same power the same vindication the same demon conquering power that god has always been god just wants to get his glory through a new vessel amen we don't need a modernized holy ghost we need the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost when it falls again it don't matter how much the devil is modernized you can't improve on perfection and god's plan was perfect in the beginning god's power was sufficient at pentecost and insufficient tonight the problem with these watered down weakened and diluted versions of the gospel is we've tried to weave man's ideas into a divine message from god and i wouldn't go for it either i wouldn't go for it either if i can't have something original if i can't have something invincible if i can't have something with a proven track record that satan has never been able to withstand let me go it's the old time holy spirit and the devil can't come near it that's the reason modernists fear it but it's good enough for me hey man hallelujah amen praise god praise god amen this army is going to be better than the army that fell this army is going to be stronger than the before they were victimized then before they were disunified before they were scattered from one end to the other they're gonna come back together and they're gonna defeat satan again even more so than they did before praise god better than before you know what the devil is almost as dumb as he is determined that is the most determined devil i've ever seen in my life no matter how many times he fails no matter how many times he loses no matter how many times god turns his own tricks around on his own head he still comes back for more better than before satan entered the garden of eden and began having a conversation with mrs adam to lower her worth by getting her to move out from under the protection of the word by convincing her that he had a little more to offer the devil's more is less trust me amen so he felt like he had achieved his objective when eve entered into the transgression and god came and dealt with the situation but you know what when adam and eve embraced again adam wasn't embracing a new wife he was embracing an original [Music] god didn't go out and find another piece of clay and make another bride for adam he had already made the only bride that adam would ever know as a bride you see friend they weren't just joined at that time they had not even known each other as husband and wife in the way of family relations but they had an emotional bond they had a bond because they came from the same source they could have fellowship because they loved the same creator they had the same interest in the same objective and the devil defiled those interests but don't you know don't you know that the day he embraced her again they had a stronger bond because now they no longer took for granted the things that before they could never appreciate because there was no contrast so in the devil's efforts to make the relationship severed inseparable never to be restored he did the opposite god rejoined her back to the side she originated from and she said honey i'll never leave you again oh he said he said dear darling i'll never ignore you again i don't care how tired i am from speaking things into existence i'll make some time for you in the evening i'll take you somewhere nice we'll go down by the ocean side and feel the breeze we'll share some romantic time together he learned how to rearrange his priorities amen so she would have no interest in what any other man had to say she had one bond and that was to the macho man adam her husband the man who saved her the man who rescued her the man who reached across the chasm and said you're the only one for me i can never have another because you came from my side a redeemed relationship friends relationship is everything relationship is the key jesus said i come from god i return to god you've got to go back where you came from amen your destination wealth can be no other than your origin oh hallelujah that's the only thing you can go back to is what you came from in the first place i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you you will be my only attraction and adoration all my heart and soul you see the the serpent the serpent could entertain her the serpent could fascinate her the serpent could capture her attention momentarily but he could never fulfill her soul because she and adam were of the same source and of the same soul and that's what made the bond was they were together originally so she could never ever be remarried or rejoined to any other person no matter how wonderful he would be you'd never be adam no matter how beautiful she may be she would never be the original mrs adam that's why adam took her back he took himself back in a feminine expression [Music] oh my it said there was a there was a lady going through the airport one day and the flight was about to leave you know it was past departure time she's an old lady she's staggering you know she's on a k and she's walking through this terminal and they keep announcing over the intercom the boarding is closing the boarding is closing hurry up and get on this flight you know maybe she was leaving charlotte going to somewhere you know and she never she never sped up she never got worried she never fretted she never got anxiety and and everyone around her was getting more and more anxious can't you hear me don't you understand does the urgency of the situation not have any impact on you and finally she said look let me explain my son is the captain i'm not worried i don't care what they say i don't care how late it is i don't care what the intercom say i don't care what youtube says i don't care what the internet says i don't care what the unbelievers say i have a relationship to the captain and i'm on that flight i have a reserved space and it's not leaving without me i have my ticket i have the token i have the baptism of the holy ghost and he's not leaving without me i'm not nervous it's not about my church it's not about my affiliation it's not about how long it's not about how weak i am it's not about how old i am he's my captain and we're related and he's not going to leave without me knowing your position gives you faith and will relax you you don't have to you don't have to tell anybody you don't have to convince anybody you know when you see people trying to convince a devil you see people trying to convince the devil to come out of somebody [Music] it's because they don't know who they are you see somebody trying to convince somebody that they're a christian they're a member of the bride they don't know who they are when you know who you are you don't have to say a word jesus never walked up to a demon and said let me give you my resume know who he was was his value he walked up he never said a word and the devil said why have you come to torment us before our time hey man you get that kind of relationship you get that kind of connection with god amen you'll be a walking powerhouse at home at school at work at play in laodicea the devil knows exactly who you are the question is do you know do you know who you are you don't have to bow down you don't have to buck i mean you don't have to compromise one thing stand your ground as sons and daughters of god hallelujah amen years ago i had a real close my wife and i both had two of our dearest friends i mean our dearest friends we were close to them because they were dedicated believers we was in a church years and years ago mixed multitude some were worldly some were loose some were moderates and some were really dedicated some took the message for what it meant and what it said and they weren't trying to carve out or cut away or trim up or no they just took it if if the word of god says it that's that's it that's that's who i am and we had this relationship we were the best of friends with this brother and his wife and then uh separation came the church we were attending begin to you know just kind of go into some things and we just it just wasn't you know it was given a lot of spiritual indigestion we're going to realize something's wrong with the diet you know i i don't know i just don't set well i just i i find myself you know i come home with this irritation and upset stomach and i'm struggling and i'm tormented i'm troubled and the the only satisfaction i can find the only piece the only answers is is in the bible and in the message so i started eating in the word more i started reading my bible i started listening to the message more and the more i listen the more apparent the deviation became and i began to realize i'm gonna have to choose one or the other i'm gonna either have to stay with the word of god or i'm gonna have to stay with a group with people i love with the church i love with a ministry i love but i got to make a decision here and so my wife and i god moved us away from this particular assembly this particular church so it affected this friendship because at the time god had not yet opened their understanding or to to the same way he had shown and friends this is what you have to realize god operates on different time frames with his people everybody don't see it at the same time everybody don't move at the same time god leads his children individually and severally as he will he's got a different times times a timeline for each person so it separated our friendship now i'm going to tell you this if i had compromised my views or my stand on the word i would not have a friendship today but the word of god was an absolute to my wife and i and to my brother and his wife and because we both stayed our love for god and our love for his word never wavered eventually god opened the understanding of the other party and they too began to see and so it brought us back together in a relationship that was better than before [Applause] oh my so what i'm telling you tonight don't compromise you cannot compromise if you have to compromise to maintain a friendship it didn't come from god if you have to compromise the word to maintain a marriage it didn't come from god whatsoever god hath joined together let not man put asunder and many men great men great ministries anointed ministries have attacked you by attacking the word they didn't attack brother branham they attacked you brother branham has sealed his testimony and is divinely vindicated of god and now you are the witness now your life is on trial and you are the witness you are the one that the devil attacked when this message was attacked because it's your identity it's who you are and so they were never attacking brother branham or his teachings they were attacking the vindication and had you compromised had you compromised you would have given up your identity you would have had surrendered your divine your deity and god won't let you do it he won't let you do it why because it is his declaration and god won't let his word fail it is his declaration that he's going to have a bride out of laodicea and he staked his reputation on you [Applause] so he will reinforce his own word by reinforcing your faith in the unfailing body word of the son of man you're not feeding on a man his words will fail we're feeding on the body word of the of man amen praise god it's it's our diet if the devil wanted to know the secret the secret is in two things our genetics and the diet i'm just going to say this tonight you can be muhammad ali's birth son birth daughter you can be michael jackson's direct i send it you can be the descendant of a world champion with all the muscles all the bone density all the structure all the potentials of a champion but your diet will determine if those potentials are ever realized or exercised in you hello church oh brother tim we're the bride of jesus christ well you keep eating fast food and sugar and high cholesterol and movies and video games and gossip and all the devil's nonsense you keep on chomping that down and you're going to be the weakest christian that's ever walked the face of the earth you got all the potentials amen you got all the power you've got all the ability but your diet is weakening your testimony amen and you are the weakest excuse amen you're a poor excuse for a hypocrite much less a christian because you've been feeding on something that is not conducive to championship performance amen if you're going to get raptured out of here you better get yourself into the word of god you better wake up in the morning and pray and read your bible and study this message and say satan you're not going to limit me you're not going to hinder me you're not going to defile me i'm going to be like daniel and the hebrew children i'm not going to defile myself with the laodicean diet i'm going to eat a proven recipe that takes your determination you gotta exercise don't make the pastor do it don't make the deacon do it you do it god called you to be an overcomer you get in that bible you get in that word you start searching out god what have you called me to do who have you called me to be i want to be an esther amen i want to be a rahab i want to be a ruth i want to be an overcomer lord i want to be a david i want to be a daniel amen i want to be a peter i want to be a bible hero feed on the word of god pray and read your bible every day amen you've got the you've got the genetics but you've got to have the diet and the exercise to unleash the potentials amen i tell you muhammad ali didn't become a world champion eating twinkies he had to drink water and eat oatmeal and he had to work out and he he had he had a war he had to exercise he had to go work out every day he was a world champion but he didn't rest on his laurels he didn't rest amen on his history he didn't rest on the hero he used to be and you can't either what god did 20 years ago it's wonderful as a memory but you need a real experience tonight oh my praise god praise god better than before jeremiah 29 says verse 10 says thus saith the lord after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my word to you and causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all a double l all of your heart you know our problem with today we want to make god work on our schedule we're living in such a structured world you know people don't want to come to church anymore they want to have virtual meetings i want to tell you what god wants to meet you but the bible says forsaking not the assembling of yourselves together as the matter of some is the more so as you see that they approach you i for one believe in coming to the house of god and worshiping shoulder to shoulder elbow to elbow with your brother and your sister and working out your differences and coming to foot washing and communion and saying brother please forgive me sister please you know some i'm just going to preach it for a minute but simba there's one thing i can't stand and that's a blanket apology somebody come up to you they done stumped your toes stabbed you in the back and bruised your head and say brother sister please forgive me if i've ever done anything to offend you come on friend that ain't an apology that ain't repentance and that ain't god you know what you you know what you said why don't you expose that devil and really repent and say i know i said it i know i did it it was evil in my heart and brother and sister may god forgive me for it and i want to make recompense i want reconciliation i don't want you just to forgive me i want to make the wrong right i want you to know that i've been changed friends repentance is not repentance it's turning from your old ways and your old habits and saying god has changed my heart god has changed my life and i'm a new person amen repentance is willing to demonstrate the difference not repeat the same old habits that ain't repentance friends that ain't god when god does it everybody's going to know there's been a change and you're going to know there's been when god does it you'll know the devil did it and you'll put the blame and the shame on him and you can confess your faults one to another i know what i said i know what i did i'm making full acknowledgement of my sin and i'm asking for genuine forgiveness you'll get somewhere with god when you do that amen that was free but it's the truth amen that blanket apology is going to burn in the fiery furnace one day along with the devil because it's just a religious covering and you'll pull that blanket out every time you know you've done wrong just so you can walk through the line get over that friend get right with god get on your knees in front of an altar and let old-fashioned repentance change your heart change your life let the tears of repentance come out your eyes and go to your neighbor and make your wrongs right in the name of the lord that's the reason you ain't got victory that's the reason the devil don't bow to you that's the reason you have no overcoming power it's because the devil has got control over you amen he knows he can't kill you the devil cannot destroy you but he wants to marginalize you he wants to move you to the middle where you're just floating along just a church member friend if all you're going to be as a church member you might as well be a roman catholic you might as well be in anyone [Music] because being in a church don't make you a christian any more than being in a garage makes you an automobile the church don't save you the baptism of the holy ghost is what saves you and that's the only ticket that's getting on the plane is a token ticket not your association not your mama not your daddy not your history not your knowledge hey man it's the old time holy spirit and the devil won't come here that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me brother kelly oh my amen [Music] peter said in his epistle you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out out of darkness into his glorious light [Music] oh my arise shine forth thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee years ago when i was just a child we went to a church and there was a man there who had come and been converted out of a prison he was a prisoner he was in the penal system you know prison system and he got saved and he really got saved i i tell this story when i was a boy this brother he would witness he worked in the prisons and he would bring in these these men and and they'd get a pass they'd come to church with him one night they heard something you had three or four guys came they heard something they didn't like they got him walked out they unscrewed the light bulbs and the porch you know where we all walked outside and fellowship they unscrewed the light bulbs they took one man he had a he had a toyota uh i believe it was a tercel it was a station wagon five door and they picked his car up and turned it sideways in the parking space now i'd venture to say those men never got to go to church on a pass again that was the end of them getting a a pass to come true they weren't getting changed but this man got changed god saved him uh you you know who i'm talking about sister destiny but you may not know at the moment but you've met him i'm sure he was neighbors he married he married a sister within the church and she was a believer and brother after she married him when she came to church you could smell her before you saw her she wore the nicest perfumes i mean not loud not obnoxious beautiful odors and wore beautiful dresses he still had the resemblance of a prisoner he was missing he had shaved they had shaved off an eyebrow he bore the mark of a prisoner but he let his glory express in her because he knew the value of having a godly wife and he would bestow upon her these beautiful clothes i mean beautiful dresses flowing very modest all these things it was never was never anything to to bring attention to her but what it was showing was what he had become as her husband and as her provider and as her protector and as her guardian he did not take her for granted he respected having a godly wife and it didn't take anything away from him for her to grab the attention because any attention she was getting and had it not been for his background had it not been for his past and she was raised poor i mean she she was raised in a big family a bunch of kids she was one of the older children she you know relatively poor but when she married him she was no longer poor she was no longer a pauper everything she had need of he provided for it and you know something she never had to say a word every man knew she was taken every man knew she is off limits she's not marketing herself for husband number two or for boyfriend number three or for another lover she is taken [Music] even if he's 10 feet away from her she is under his protection she is under his guardianship she is under his watch he gave a message through her that was a non-verbal communication i am married to somebody stronger than you i'm married to somebody richer than you i'm married to somebody more powerful than you no matter what your mind might be thinking no matter what your interest may be hands off and that's what i want to tell the devil tonight hands off devil i'm not in the market for another message i'm not in the market for another ministry i'm not looking for another groom or another husband i'm taken [Applause] hands off devil by his stripes i am healed hands off devil many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord god delivereth him out of them all hands off devil you want to see the glory of god look at me look at my life look at my testimony look at where god brought me from to where i am today she can walk into the room and the atmosphere changed she could walk into a setting and the atmosphere changed because there was peace there was tranquility there was power she had a command over the room because she was married [Music] oh my better than before i love him more after the sickness i love him more after the trial i love him more after the valley after all the adversity after everything i've been through i love him more than ever before would you stand with me tonight amen amen hallelujah i'm not going back to what i used to be it's gonna be better than ever before because this involves god and i'm showing forth his power his nature [Music] amen better than before yes sir amen the first eve had to fall the second eve is predestinated [Music] amen amen i was looking forward here amen this is it and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminences in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept now you know why the devil was trying to talk you out of believing this message he wanted to marginalize who you are and put you in a state of spiritual amnesia because he cannot destroy you and actually cannot defeat you but he can neutralize you by dimming your view an understanding of who you are see that hybrid condition again just exactly what he'd done if he told eve don't you do this don't you do that and you can do this and that see legalism legalism how many have ever tried to tell you this message is legalism it's not legalism it's a love letter but to those who are not predestinated it looks like legalism relationship makes the difference oh satan said oh you know but she turned around listen to him but the even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said his church would be there without spot or wrinkle she is going to stand there in the splendor of him his word may manifest as a brother stephen comes there was a boy one time you know he got lifted up and pride and he said i'm going to go demand my inheritance i'm going to cash out early and i'm going to go live the way of the world and it was a dead-end street only days later he was penniless friendless and slopping the hogs hoping to get a bite of what he was feeding to them sometime went by and one day the bible says he came to himself he said you know what i may be in a different place i may be penniless i may have a different appearance i may have a trashed reputation but one thing has not changed i am still still my father's son i think i'll go home and the closer he walked to home the more he grew into the realization of who he was and then when his father saw him coming he didn't send him through a reform school he didn't send him through a three-step program he didn't send them through penance or some program to reprove himself as a son he said kill the fatted calf bring the finest garment give him the same as he had before because he's still my son his value was never measured on a bank statement his value was never measured and how many facebook friends he had his value is in whose son he is and when he recognized it the father ratified it welcomed him and killed the fatted calf and said my son has come home again and don't you know there was a bond between that boy and his dad that was better than before you know something i left this out and i apologize for going so long but if you are a prophetic class of people then you have a prophetic attribute in you god wanted to restore those bones back to everything they were before and more but he needed somebody to speak his desire god ain't waiting on brother brethren to come back god's not waiting on an eighth messenger to write so god's not waiting on some great fantastic ministry god's waiting on you to realize the power of his desire expressed through his spoken word and let that word speak through you you speak to your situation you speak to the mountain you speak to the condition the word of god is nigh unto thee even in thy mouth if you're a prophetic class of people then you are echoing and i wanted to get to that quote where he talks about it was echoed you can bring it later but steve buddy but brother ben's i'll is it okay if i read this i i know it's i know it's 905 but it's later than we think and i know what the devil hates he hates this word so i'm gonna give him one more black eye amen praise the lord why i'm against organized religion the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word it can't vindicate dogma there's no life in him he's life notice the laodicean church age had denied and rejected them and they put them on the outside now this angel is the last messenger before the coming of christ in the 19th chapter of revelation the messenger's voice if we notice when he gave his voice on the earth there was a voice that echoed in heaven fourth verse if you want to read it alright fourth verse 19th chapter the messenger on the earth was so inclined with god until when he spoken on the earth god echoed the same thing out of heaven what is that fourth birth translation what does it mean god's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying come out of her just exactly what the voice was he's got people all out there all throughout all out through babylon come out of her that you be not partakers of his sins now we always put this in denominations but it ain't in denominations it's in the denominational spirits that reside right within so-called message churches [Music] it's denominational spirits when men try to preserve a move of god they paralyze they embalm the move of god by trying to preserve they make it all about what god did friend it's not about what god did it's about what god's doing and as soon as they build walls and denominate around it the pillar fire moves right on and the bride follows along with because it's who she is yes sir out of that dogmas and creates to the word made spirit in life notice the 19th chapter is the next after these things did you notice here in the 19th chapter after these things watch what after what after the message of come out of her after these things watched is the shout of the bride saints he didn't say the prophet he said the bride saints this the shout of the bride saints with the bridegroom going to the marriage of the lamb it's no longer two voices it's one voice oh and he is echoing it whatsoever you bind on earth abide in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven we've arrived we're here now is he going to speak speak to your circumstance speak to the sickness speak to the situation in your whole in your family say satan i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm standing here on the word of god and i'm saying come back come back bones come back husband come back life come back relationship come back and don't be what you are before be better be better than what you were before oh my god come out of babylon come out of unbelief come out of anything any knowledge that exalts itself is the word of god give a key of g give me your hand let's agree together [Music] that all of our enemies crumble at our feet for whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and at the name of jesus satan has to flee because we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power in the name of the lord though satan rages we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord [Music] oh but the bride of jesus is very much alive and

rages we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord you believe it with all your heart tonight we've got the power it's in the name of jesus name above all names we've got the

about that day god opened the waters of the red sea and israel marched across on dry land and pharaoh said i'm going to impersonate this i'm going to mimic a gift of god and god said israel i want you to turn around and i want you to take a good look at them egyptians because this day you will see these egyptians no more today i'm gonna get me honor upon pharaoh what the enemy thought would destroy
