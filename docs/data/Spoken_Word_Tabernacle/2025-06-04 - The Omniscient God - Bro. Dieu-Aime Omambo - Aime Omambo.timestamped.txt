[0:00] Father placed them here because some man
[0:04] likes mountains, some people likes
[0:06] waters, some likes deserts. So you see
[0:10] your coming, he knew your nature and
[0:12] what you would be so he made it just the
[0:15] way that you could enjoy it. Oh, I think
[0:18] that's a wonderful father. See though
[0:20] that he made it like this. I'm glad he
[0:23] made mountains. I'm I like the
[0:25] mountains. I And I I like that where the
[0:27] others are. I can't stand all the must
[0:29] have emptied his mortar box out there.
[0:31] Well, he emptied out so I could enjoy
[0:32] it. You see, so then I like the planes
[0:36] where I can see a long ways. Well, the
[0:37] two different natures, both of us
[0:39] Christians, but the father knew that you
[0:42] would be here and prepared everything
[0:44] for you before you got here. Amen. Your
[0:48] first coming here, he had it ready for
[0:51] you when you got here. Isn't that
[0:52] marvelous to think of what he done? Now,
[0:55] now but remember these are only temporal
[0:59] gifts in type. Now we know that Moses in
[1:03] building the tabernacle in the
[1:04] wilderness or preparing it, he said he
[1:07] made all things after the order of what
[1:10] he saw in heaven. See, so the earthly
[1:13] things only express what the eternal
[1:16] things are. Amen. And if this earth that
[1:18] we live in today being so great as we
[1:20] love it and love to live and breathe the
[1:23] air and see the flowers and things, if
[1:26] if that if this share is the expression,
[1:30] one that's dying is only expressing one
[1:33] that's eternal. When you see a tree
[1:36] struggling, pulling, trying to live,
[1:38] that means there's a tree somewhere that
[1:40] doesn't have to do that. When you see a
[1:42] man here struggling to live, somebody in
[1:45] a hospital or on a sick bed or in an
[1:48] accident struggling and the death
[1:50] rattles in their throat and pulling and
[1:52] crying and screaming for life. What does
[1:54] that mean? There's a place somewhere.
[1:56] There's a body that doesn't struggle and
[1:58] scream for that. See, it just doesn't do
[2:01] it. Now, there are temporal gifts to us
[2:04] these things only expressing that there
[2:07] is one where it's eternal one. That's
[2:10] what Jesus has gone away to prepare the
[2:13] eternal one for us. Now they only
[2:16] express there's a greater uh of the same
[2:18] kind because these are a same kind. I
[2:21] remember the Bible said if this earthly
[2:23] tabernacle of our dwelling if it perish
[2:27] be dissolved. We have one already
[2:30] waiting
[2:32] just as the little baby its little
[2:34] muscles in the mother are twisting and
[2:37] turning and but just see and you notice
[2:40] you can take a woman if she is ever so
[2:42] foul but when she's become a mother a
[2:45] little while before that baby's born
[2:47] there's a kindness about the woman get
[2:49] around her there's always something
[2:51] she's more tender why there's a little
[2:53] angel spirit waiting to receive that
[2:56] natural body just as soon is born, the
[2:58] breath of life comes into it and God
[3:00] breathes it in there and it becomes a
[3:02] living soul. Now just as this baby is
[3:06] being formed then the spiritual body is
[3:08] there to receive it and now when this
[3:12] body is dropped here in this earth like
[3:14] the baby's dropped also there is a
[3:17] immortal body waiting to receive the
[3:20] spirit back into itself again. Oh, what
[3:23] a great thing we are. We are now in
[3:26] Christ Jesus. Amen. Babies, babies in
[3:30] Christ, children of God, waiting for the
[3:33] full deliverance at the coming of our
[3:35] Lord Jesus, the to receive us up unto
[3:38] himself when the body, this mortal will
[3:41] take on
[3:43] immortality, the likeness, all the
[3:45] things that he did expresses the things
[3:47] that are to come. Just as the body
[4:19] [Music]
[4:37] Heat. Heat.
[4:39] [Music]
[6:13] Amen. And amen. Can be upstanding
[6:16] tonight. Amen. Even as we commit the
[6:19] service into the hands of the Lord.
[6:21] Amen. And ask that the Lord himself take
[6:23] preeminence tonight. Amen. and commit
[6:26] all those on their way coming that the
[6:28] Lord lead them safely on the road. Lord,
[6:31] despite all the heavy traffic, may the
[6:33] Lord guide them safely. Let us pray.
[6:35] Father, in the name of Jesus, we are
[6:37] just grateful, Lord Jesus. God, we
[6:41] humbly come before you tonight, Lord.
[6:44] Coming before you, Lord Jesus. Oh God,
[6:46] with our thanksgiving, come before you
[6:48] with our worship, Lord. And we asking,
[6:50] Father, Lord, may you take absolute
[6:52] control tonight, Lord. Father God, we
[6:55] just thank you Lord for being with us.
[6:57] God is midweek. Lord, you've been with
[7:00] us. You've kept us, Lord Jesus. You
[7:02] protected us, Lord. You provided all our
[7:04] needs, Lord. Father God, you you've been
[7:08] there, Lord Jesus. Oh God, when we
[7:10] needed you, Lord Jesus, we just want to
[7:12] express our joys, Lord. Father God,
[7:16] Bible say that I was glad when he said
[7:18] unto me, let us go into the house of the
[7:20] Lord. Lord, we know, oh God, we've come
[7:22] here, Lord Jesus, expectant, oh God, and
[7:25] we know we'll be filled, Lord Jesus. Oh
[7:27] God, with all our heart desires, Lord
[7:29] Jesus. Oh God, you've already provided
[7:31] for us, Lord. And we just express our
[7:34] joys. We just express our thanksgiving,
[7:36] Lord. We asking, Lord, if there be
[7:39] anything, Lord, in our lives, Lord
[7:41] Jesus, there's a stumbling block, Lord,
[7:42] tonight. We ask, Father, for your
[7:44] forgiveness, Lord Jesus, and ask for
[7:46] your mercies, Lord. And Lord, even as we
[7:49] stand before you, Lord, to hear from
[7:51] you, Lord, we ask Lord, may you set the
[7:54] atmosphere, Lord. And Lord, committing
[7:56] your minister tonight into your hands,
[7:58] Lord, and asking, Father, may you take
[8:00] him aside, Lord Jesus. Oh God, and speak
[8:03] through him, oh God, freely, Lord Jesus,
[8:06] as you will tonight, Lord, those on
[8:08] their way coming, Lord, are in your
[8:10] hands, Lord, we ask for a protection. Be
[8:12] with them, oh God, on the road, Lord.
[8:14] Lead them safely, Lord. And together in
[8:16] one accord in one spirit, oh God, we
[8:18] lift your name on high once again, Lord.
[8:22] We thank you. We bless you, Lord. We
[8:23] give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's
[8:26] name we pray. Amen. And amen.

[47:06] king. I'm going to have a time of my
[47:08] life when my life is
[47:11] over. I'm going to get carried away when

[47:50] can't express feelings deep inside me.
[47:54] One thing I know and cannot show. One
[47:57] day will

[48:01] roll the road.
[48:04] I'm going to get
[48:09] myself. I'm going to have my
[48:12] life

[48:17] I get carried
[48:19] away. Oh, pass the clouds and I shout so
[48:23] loud. They sound like thunder. My dear
[48:28] life looks like rain. When I leave this
[48:31] world, pass the gates above and stand
[48:34] before my savior. I lift my soul. Let
[48:37] the glory roll. And from the roll it
[48:39] calls my name. I'm going to let the
[48:42] glory roll with the rolling glory. Oh,
[48:46] I'm going to find
[48:50] myself. I'm going to have the time of my
[48:53] life. When the time of my life is
[48:55] over, I'm going to get carried away.
[48:58] When I get carried
[49:00] away, I'm going to let the glory roll.
[49:03] When the road is rolling
[49:05] glory, I'm going to get beside myself.
[49:08] When I get to

[49:13] life when the time of my
[49:16] life. I'm going to get carried away.

[49:28] cheerful life through the sky until it
[49:31] looks like rain. When I leave this
[49:33] world, pass the gates of pearl as dance
[49:36] before my savior. I let my soul let the
[49:39] glory roll. And when the rolling calls
[49:42] my name, I'm going to let the glory
[49:44] roll. The Lord has told me glory.

[50:52] Everybody happy. Ready for the word?
[50:56] Glory to God. We greet you all in the
[50:58] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[51:00] Jesus Christ both visible and invisible
[51:04] audience. Amen. Any family members here?
[51:07] God richly bless you and welcome to
[51:09] spoken word convention on Wednesday. And
[51:12] I believe everybody now is clear with
[51:14] what a purpose and our prayer works.
[51:16] Amen. Even Jesus Christ himself could
[51:20] not change the purpose of God for his
[51:22] life.
[51:24] Amen. He say, "Father, if it's possible,
[51:27] uh, there is no possibility. You came
[51:30] for redemption. You were born to die for
[51:33] the seed of the world." Amen. Brother
[51:36] Brandham say he was a young man. He
[51:38] wanted to stay. He love his disciple but
[51:41] he have to surrender to the purpose of
[51:43] God. That's why he said nevertheless not
[51:46] my will but my will. And when he look at
[51:49] the joy that was set before he saw the
[51:53] purpose redemption and all the sense of
[51:56] the old testament. Job prophesies that I
[51:59] know my redeemer live and the redeemer
[52:01] is praying trying to stay in the world.
[52:04] [Laughter]
[52:07] God God is so good to us. He unfolded
[52:10] this so much so that you're not going to
[52:13] be too hard on yourself.
[52:15] There will be time when you so
[52:17] pressurize until you want to even
[52:19] change. You say, "Father, please." But
[52:21] if Christ overcame
[52:23] by surrendering to the will of the
[52:25] father, the same God that helped Jesus
[52:28] Christ overcome will help you also
[52:30] surrender to the will of the father.
[52:32] Amen. So you pray for us because I'm in
[52:35] between the what do you do in season or
[52:39] whether do we need to pick up Paul or
[52:41] not because I was coming tonight and I
[52:43] heard brother Brandham say something and
[52:45] it's shifting me toward a different
[52:47] direction. So you pray for me whether we
[52:50] need to pick up Paul or not. If not, so
[52:52] we go to what do you do in season and
[52:55] what do you do out of season? It seems
[52:56] like things has been changed going to
[52:58] that direction because it feels like the
[53:01] spirit is convinced you really got what
[53:04] it means by time, season, and purpose
[53:08] and your prayer. It looks like
[53:10] everything is now settled. Amen. No more
[53:14] pressure. God knows what he's doing.
[53:15] Amen. Amen. So young man remember this
[53:19] coming Saturday. Brother Robert, I
[53:21] believe, brother Glenn, I believe it's
[53:22] 2:30, right? So be there on time. I have
[53:25] been
[53:26] longsuffering for five years. So
[53:29] sometime I give a little bit the extra
[53:31] time and I wait for those that came. No
[53:34] more. Have I say something wrong? No
[53:37] more. If it's 2:30, we it's 2:30, we
[53:40] start at 2:30. If it's uh 2 o'clock, we
[53:42] start at 2 o'clock. Will you catch up
[53:44] whenever you come? You will find out
[53:46] moving on. Amen. Five years it's already
[53:48] grace. So let's now turn the corner and
[53:52] then move to a different direction. If
[53:53] it's 2:30, it's one person. We start
[53:55] with one person. Whoever comes, you do
[53:58] that at
[54:00] work. Brother Joshua, who goes to work
[54:03] late because of a
[54:05] paycheck. And this is more than a
[54:08] paycheck. Amen. We do it here in church.
[54:11] when church started we by the to the
[54:14] best of my understanding we are always
[54:16] on time. So let's keep that rolling on
[54:19] in the meeting whether it's couple
[54:21] meeting or whatever let's go straight on
[54:23] time and move forward. Amen. So your
[54:26] longsuffering uh is in the shelf for
[54:28] some time. Amen. So boys make sure we
[54:32] there young man at 2:30 and we move on.
[54:34] Amen. I'm not preaching tonight. It's a
[54:37] convention. A lot going on outside. So
[54:39] you pray for us. We we it seems like
[54:43] it's a little bit slower for our
[54:45] expectation because everybody goes there
[54:47] to see what's going on. It's just we
[54:48] have to go through the inspections once
[54:51] the inspector goes it's like stop. You
[54:53] got to stop and they have to check and
[54:56] if there is something to fix the fix and
[54:58] the second and the third once the third
[55:00] the three inspection goes through then
[55:02] we start again soaring and moving on.
[55:04] Amen. You pray for us the city we have
[55:06] how many weeks left brother Glenn? four
[55:08] weeks or three weeks left. Three weeks
[55:12] left. So you pray. We have three weeks.
[55:14] We came from 14 coming down. So pray so
[55:17] that everything is good. It will help us
[55:19] begin to move on the other side quicker
[55:22] by God's grace. Amen. And brother set
[55:25] love your faith with
[55:27] works. Amen. I'm hiding behind the
[55:30] trustee. Amen. Uh behind the trustee. So
[55:33] brother set love your faith with work.
[55:35] If not, he will preach you a sermon.
[55:37] faith without work is
[55:39] dead. So just move on quickly so he
[55:42] won't preach that sermon. Amen. Brother
[55:44] dear M is preaching tonight. Again amen.
[55:48] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. I
[55:51] told them I said brother Brandham say
[55:53] you only have three years for a minister
[55:56] to establish your ministry. You know
[55:59] that quote. You want me to send it to
[56:02] you or you don't know? If you don't you
[56:04] don't know that quote. Brother, I'm
[56:05] saying ministry. You have three years to
[56:07] establish a ministry. You stay after 3
[56:10] years the remaining of your life you
[56:11] live with the reputation that you built
[56:14] on. So I have to say that so to put them
[56:17] under pressure so that they can work
[56:21] hard and reach the the the summit so
[56:25] that you can begin to soar. You know an
[56:27] eagle at the beginning you flap your
[56:28] wing but when you get to a certain level
[56:30] you begin to soar with the wind. So if
[56:33] you dedicate it stronger by the time you
[56:35] get there you begin to follow the wind
[56:37] of the Holy Spirit and now begin to move
[56:40] with sermon according to what the spirit
[56:42] is saying and you need to move. Amen.
[56:45] Glory to God. I put you in a hot potato
[56:47] seat but that's good for young men.

[59:18] Uh thank you brother Stephen for this
[59:21] privilege and honor to come up here and
[59:23] preach and minister before the bride of
[59:25] Christ.
[59:27] It's it's always nerve-wracking
[59:30] but we're grateful.
[59:37] Before taking much time, if you can go
[59:39] to the
[59:41] reading to Exodus chapter
[59:48] 3, chapter
[59:50] 15:3,
[59:52] pardon. First, let's go to the Lord in
[59:54] prayer.
[59:56] Lord, heavenly father, I come to you
[59:58] this evening, Lord God. I come first off
[1:00:00] to thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for the
[1:00:01] breath of life. Thank you for this day
[1:00:02] that you gave that you given unto us,
[1:00:04] Lord God. Thank you for everything that
[1:00:05] you've done. You protected us in the
[1:00:07] high wisdom by wisdom and got us, Lord
[1:00:08] Jesus Christ, through another week, Lord
[1:00:10] Jesus Christ. We're halfway through the
[1:00:12] week, Lord God. And we come over here to
[1:00:13] replenish oursel with your word, Lord,
[1:00:15] heavenly father. We come to hear from
[1:00:17] you, Lord God, not from a man, Lord God.
[1:00:19] May you remove me out of the way and may
[1:00:21] you speak to your bride, Lord. Heavenly
[1:00:22] Father, may you fellowship with your
[1:00:24] people, Lord God, because that's that is
[1:00:26] what you desired, Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:00:28] since the foundation of the world. and I
[1:00:29] come Lord Jesus Christ healing myself
[1:00:31] unto you Lord Jesus Christ that you may
[1:00:32] use me and may you also use the
[1:00:34] congregation to listen Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:36] and understanding Lord God may reveal
[1:00:38] Lord Jesus Christ everything that you
[1:00:40] showed unto me may you reveal it onto
[1:00:41] them Lord God and I pray Lord heavenly
[1:00:43] father whatever that will be spoken Lord
[1:00:45] Jesus Christ may they keep pondering
[1:00:47] upon them may bring may you strengthen
[1:00:49] their faith Lord Jesus Christ and bring
[1:00:51] their faith higher Lord heavenly father
[1:00:52] and so they might have a stronger Lord
[1:00:54] heavenly father foundation in you and in
[1:00:57] your word uh bend their or the service
[1:00:59] onto you may take control in Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen. If you
[1:01:04] can go to Exodus chapter 15, if you're
[1:01:06] there, can you say amen? Amen. The
[1:01:09] scripture says this, "The Lord is a man
[1:01:12] of war. The Lord is his name." Amen. If
[1:01:16] we could drop to verse 13, it says,
[1:01:19] "Thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[1:01:22] people which thou has redeemed. Thou has
[1:01:27] thou hast guided them in thy strength
[1:01:29] unto thy holy habitation. You may be
[1:01:32] seated. May the Lord God bless the
[1:01:34] reading of his word. Amen. And as for my
[1:01:37] subject this evening is the omnisient
[1:01:41] God. Amen. And as we see throughout our
[1:01:45] journey as we're going through as a
[1:01:47] soldier because I keep saying soldier
[1:01:49] soldier and I just wanted to clarify a
[1:01:51] soldier. You can type it with a pilgrim
[1:01:53] also. And the inspiration of it was when
[1:01:56] I'm looking at um when I'm looking at
[1:02:00] believers that stick with the word of
[1:02:01] God. When I'm looking at people that
[1:02:03] stick because brother Brandon say a real
[1:02:05] Christian genuine true Christian stays
[1:02:07] with the word of God and he doesn't
[1:02:09] deviate. And when I look at people like
[1:02:11] Paul who stayed with the word of God
[1:02:13] since they went through trials. Paul
[1:02:16] even in um some places Paul even died.
[1:02:20] He was killed, stoned, and he got right
[1:02:22] back up and went back to uh ministering.
[1:02:24] When I look at those type of people, it
[1:02:25] gave me strength. When I look at people
[1:02:27] that are sticking with the word of God
[1:02:29] like Jeremiah that God chose since his
[1:02:31] youth and God made sure that he aligned
[1:02:35] kind of typing it with Christ, not even
[1:02:37] getting married and everything, God
[1:02:38] chose him since his youth to work for
[1:02:40] God. When I look at those, it kind of
[1:02:41] gave me strength. And that's why I I was
[1:02:44] going through this journey. And as I'm
[1:02:46] going through this journey, there's a
[1:02:48] thing about God in this journey. He's
[1:02:49] always watching over us. He's always He
[1:02:53] like we when we read he purchased the
[1:02:55] map. He gave us the map and he's
[1:02:56] watching over us and guiding us through
[1:02:58] it. So the Lord God is like our HQ also
[1:03:02] because he's giving us information and
[1:03:04] telling us where we need to go, where we
[1:03:06] don't need to go.
[1:03:08] Which in another word, he's a watchman
[1:03:11] for us. And tonight I wanted to talk
[1:03:14] about why you should listen to that
[1:03:16] watchman. Why is it important important
[1:03:18] to listen to the watchman and why
[1:03:21] everything that watchman is telling you
[1:03:23] is is absolute and why is always
[1:03:26] relevant. That's what I'm want to talk
[1:03:28] about. And as we've been talking and
[1:03:30] going through this journey, brother
[1:03:31] Brena has been telling us to stand still
[1:03:33] and to listen to God. Be patient on the
[1:03:36] Lord, not to be impatient. Because some
[1:03:38] of us when we're going through trials,
[1:03:40] we want to hurry up
[1:03:42] and make the thing happen before it
[1:03:45] being God's time. Like we could take um
[1:03:49] certain people in the Bible, you could
[1:03:50] take King Soul. King So the prophet had
[1:03:54] told him to wait for him before the
[1:03:56] sacrifice. And King Soul didn't listen.
[1:03:59] And because he didn't listen. And the
[1:04:00] thing the beautiful thing about it is it
[1:04:02] was right instead of being patient, it
[1:04:05] was right when he started doing it,
[1:04:06] that's exactly when the prophet came.
[1:04:08] It's almost like when um a parent puts a
[1:04:11] little cook in a cookie jar that leaves
[1:04:13] it there for a child that goes hide in a
[1:04:15] corner and that that he just waits. The
[1:04:17] moment the kid takes it and puts in his
[1:04:19] mouth, the parent comes right out. And
[1:04:21] if they say, "See, I knew you weren't
[1:04:22] mature enough." You see? And there are
[1:04:24] certain other like um you could take the
[1:04:27] apostles
[1:04:29] because when uh Judas Escaria was
[1:04:32] removed out of the 12
[1:04:34] they were in a hurry to replace him
[1:04:38] without it being God's will instead of
[1:04:40] waiting on the Lord they did not wait
[1:04:42] and because they did not wait they
[1:04:44] thought it was um Messias that was
[1:04:47] supposed to be a replacement and brother
[1:04:48] Brandham in another place also spoke
[1:04:50] about it he said that Messiah they chose
[1:04:53] the best kind of like um King Soul. They
[1:04:55] chose the best that they could find.
[1:04:57] They chose the best person that they
[1:04:59] believe fit that standard. And because
[1:05:01] they they thought he fit that standard,
[1:05:03] they chose him. And they said, "Oh, we
[1:05:05] appoint you." And brother Bren say, "If
[1:05:07] you look in the scripture, they they
[1:05:08] didn't even mention about him. He he was
[1:05:11] I don't want to say irrelevant, but he
[1:05:13] was he was irrelevant to the scripture."
[1:05:15] Amen.
[1:05:17] Except for the fact that you showed that
[1:05:19] you shouldn't lean onto your own
[1:05:20] understanding and try to appoint stuff
[1:05:22] without it being God's God's will. And
[1:05:25] the prophet even says
[1:05:27] um first the prophet says in the
[1:05:31] testimony of a true um of a
[1:05:34] true of a true witness in paragraph 250.
[1:05:39] God fill us with awe, with deity. Fill
[1:05:43] us with the power and energy until our
[1:05:46] souls are a flame. That our strength
[1:05:49] will be him. Our testimony will be God,
[1:05:53] our words will be his, devils will
[1:05:56] tremble, the world will shake and rock
[1:05:59] under the impact of it. Lord, if you can
[1:06:02] only find people who are willing to wait
[1:06:04] upon the Lord, you see, willing to wait
[1:06:07] upon the Lord. Because I just came for
[1:06:08] talking about people that were impatient
[1:06:10] because brother Brennham this
[1:06:13] um brother Brennham um was saying over
[1:06:17] here in from that time paragraph 60 he
[1:06:19] says the church had the keys Jesus told
[1:06:22] them he gave them the keys look how they
[1:06:25] used it they said now it's written in
[1:06:27] the scripture the scripture must be
[1:06:29] fulfilled let but let another take
[1:06:35] bishop talk of
[1:06:38] Judah talking of Judas and he said and
[1:06:42] he find f and he find fine cultured men
[1:06:46] good men just as religious as they could
[1:06:48] be to the key men that were good
[1:06:51] reputation as in good reputation and
[1:06:54] they cast their lots and chose Msiah
[1:06:58] but but what good did it do there isn't
[1:07:02] one thing recorded in the Bible that he
[1:07:04] ever did not one thing just a good old
[1:07:07] deacon or something another like but he
[1:07:11] was supposed to be an apostle. But
[1:07:14] here's the here's the other part where
[1:07:15] brother Brandon speaks about what God
[1:07:18] God's choice and he says God went over
[1:07:21] and chose a little old hightempered
[1:07:24] hooknose church hater. It it shows that
[1:07:28] God can take nothing and make something
[1:07:31] out of it. That's what makes him God.
[1:07:34] And Amen. That's the very thing that
[1:07:37] makes um God God. And the the reason why
[1:07:40] God chooses certain certain things and
[1:07:43] we do not understand it, but he
[1:07:45] understands it because he's omnisient.
[1:07:46] He's all knowing. So when he's choosing
[1:07:49] something, he already knows what what's
[1:07:51] in them. That's how God chooses. That's
[1:07:53] why the prophet says to be wait and wait
[1:07:55] upon the Lord. Don't be in a hurry.
[1:07:57] Because there's also other times like
[1:07:59] the apostle when they're in the upper
[1:08:01] room, they waited on the Lord and they
[1:08:02] were praying and supplementing. That's
[1:08:04] actually what they were supposed to do.
[1:08:05] They waited. You It did It It doesn't
[1:08:07] say that um the apostles left, you know,
[1:08:10] because they if you're in someone that's
[1:08:13] impatient, you could have also gotten up
[1:08:14] and left, but they didn't. They were
[1:08:16] obedient and they were patient.
[1:08:19] Just like um Elijah. Elijah was patient
[1:08:22] when he went to the cave and waited upon
[1:08:24] the Lord. Brother Brandon say he waited
[1:08:25] for this little still voice. See, those
[1:08:27] are people that are patient. There are
[1:08:29] people that are impatient. There are
[1:08:30] people that are patient.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah. Now, Brother Brandon said,
[1:08:36] "In the power of the devil," paragraph
[1:08:39] 45, he says, "I know you think I'm
[1:08:41] crazy. That's all right. I feel better
[1:08:44] crazy than I did the other way. So, I'll
[1:08:47] just stay this this away." That's right.
[1:08:50] Amen. If it takes a crazy person to
[1:08:52] believe the word of God, let me stay the
[1:08:55] way I am. Then if I'm supposed to be
[1:08:59] crazy and believe this. See, this
[1:09:01] reminds me of after the um the pillar of
[1:09:04] after the Holy Ghost came, people were
[1:09:06] thinking that the the apostles were
[1:09:08] drunk, but they were not drunk. They
[1:09:09] were thinking that they were they were
[1:09:11] um they were basically crazy, but they
[1:09:12] weren't crazy. And they were saying this
[1:09:14] is that that was prophesied. Yes, sir.
[1:09:16] And the prophet Kina says, "I believe
[1:09:18] that Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[1:09:21] raised from the dead, standing right
[1:09:24] here in a m in in this building tonight.
[1:09:27] I believe he's omnisient, omnipresent,
[1:09:30] omnipotent. Hallelujah. Has all wisdom,
[1:09:34] all places, fills all space, and is all
[1:09:37] powerful. He's the true and the living
[1:09:40] one." You believe that? That's the way
[1:09:43] to believe and to be saved. That's the
[1:09:46] only way you can be saved is to believe
[1:09:49] in it. He's here. He's the one who
[1:09:52] looked over his audience. Remember, he's
[1:09:55] a watchman. He's the one who look over
[1:09:56] his audience. And he says this is the
[1:09:58] only way to be saved to believe in his
[1:10:00] omnisient. He's omnipresent. He's
[1:10:03] omnipotent. And see it's the only way
[1:10:06] because if God because because if God
[1:10:10] knowing all things and he is true if he
[1:10:13] says something that mean that thing is
[1:10:16] the only choice there is and if you go
[1:10:18] any if you go left or right you go
[1:10:20] contrary to it that mean you're doomed
[1:10:22] to fail. That mean you're not going to
[1:10:23] be saved. That's what the prophet say is
[1:10:25] the only way to be saved. You
[1:10:28] see that's what the prophet say is the
[1:10:30] only way to be saved. And the thing
[1:10:32] about it, God being all knowing, he's
[1:10:34] all knowing
[1:10:36] by he's omnipresent by his omnisient.
[1:10:39] The prophet of God says that he's
[1:10:41] because he knows all things. That's why
[1:10:44] he's omnipresent.
[1:10:46] He knows everything simultaneously. What
[1:10:48] do I mean by that? It means if God were
[1:10:50] here tonight and you would ask him
[1:10:52] anything that happened in the past, he
[1:10:53] would be able to tell you. If God and if
[1:10:56] you ask him anything that's happening on
[1:10:58] today in this world right now, he would
[1:10:59] be able to tell you. And if you ask him
[1:11:01] for future things, he would also be able
[1:11:03] to tell you. That's why he's all
[1:11:05] knowing. He's it's he's omnipresent. I
[1:11:08] believe it was
[1:11:09] um in John chapter one when God was
[1:11:12] talking to he told Philip. He told
[1:11:14] Philillip, he chose Philillip. And
[1:11:16] Philip was so eager he went to tell um
[1:11:18] Nathaniel. And when Nathaniel came to u
[1:11:21] Jesus,
[1:11:22] Jesus started telling him before you
[1:11:24] even came I saw you at the tree. You see
[1:11:26] go God he alo in order to see something
[1:11:30] in order to say I saw you that mean you
[1:11:32] have to be there but Jesus who is in
[1:11:34] flesh because the prophet of God said
[1:11:37] that he's omnipresent by his um by his
[1:11:41] knowledge and he even went on to talk
[1:11:43] about how people think he's like the air
[1:11:46] or such such and such a
[1:11:49] thing which the prophet says in the
[1:11:52] junction of time he's infinite he's god
[1:11:55] He's omnipotent, omnipresent, omnisient.
[1:11:57] See, he knows all things, all wisdom,
[1:12:01] and all time. Covers all space, all
[1:12:05] power, he's infinite. And if he isn't
[1:12:08] that, he's not God. That's right. If he
[1:12:11] isn't almighty God, which he is, if he
[1:12:14] can't do all things, which he can, he's
[1:12:18] not almighty God. But if he is all
[1:12:22] almighty God, he can do all things. See,
[1:12:25] so that's the way we have to believe
[1:12:27] him. See, that's the only way that we
[1:12:29] have to believe him because he say, see
[1:12:31] the part about omniscience, it speaks
[1:12:32] about knowledge and it speaks about
[1:12:34] wisdom. And I remember when I was
[1:12:36] meditating the the the uh original
[1:12:39] transfer thought that I had was for
[1:12:41] knowledge and insight. For knowledge
[1:12:43] speaks about prophecy, about knowing
[1:12:45] things of the future. And insight speaks
[1:12:47] about understanding. And omnisient takes
[1:12:50] both for knowledge and insight into it.
[1:12:52] That's why he says wisdom speaks about
[1:12:54] understanding and all knowledge speaks
[1:12:56] about any knowledge past, future or
[1:12:58] present.
[1:13:00] And the prophet of God continues says it
[1:13:02] wasn't so from the beginning. Now God is
[1:13:05] omnipotent, omnipresent by being
[1:13:07] omnisient. It make it making him omnip
[1:13:11] omnipresent. He knows all things but God
[1:13:14] could not be just like the air is
[1:13:17] because God has a dwelling place. God is
[1:13:20] not a myth. God is a being. God Jesus he
[1:13:26] God pronoun he is a being. Therefore
[1:13:29] he's omnisient, omnipresent, omnipotent
[1:13:32] and infinite. Now to be infinite it
[1:13:35] comes from the word infinite. Infinite
[1:13:37] which there is no limit. He is eternal.
[1:13:40] Eternal is like a ring. It goes around
[1:13:43] around and you're trying to find where
[1:13:46] it begins or where it ends. There is no
[1:13:48] beginning or ending to it because there
[1:13:50] are certain other religions or belief
[1:13:52] where their god is like a myth is like
[1:13:54] the air where if you go outside the
[1:13:56] universe you're going to find yourself
[1:13:58] literally still in the god in still in
[1:14:00] the palm of God as some other um
[1:14:02] religious be um depict their own um
[1:14:06] version of God. But over here the
[1:14:08] prophet is saying that he's not a myth.
[1:14:10] He's not somewhere that's up in the air
[1:14:11] that wherever you go he you're going to
[1:14:13] see the literal hand of God just being
[1:14:15] everywhere.
[1:14:17] And that's what the prophet of God is
[1:14:18] talking about. He's not a myth. And he
[1:14:20] continues in inspiration 1956 he says
[1:14:24] how God forn knows all things and making
[1:14:26] preparation for it. Amen. God knows all
[1:14:30] things. He's omnipotent. He's
[1:14:32] omnipresent. He's omnisient. He knows
[1:14:35] all things when when the world before
[1:14:37] there were ever was a star in heaven.
[1:14:40] Before there were ever was a light in
[1:14:42] the firmament. God knew every prophet
[1:14:45] that ever lived or ever or or everything
[1:14:48] that men and women would ever do. He's
[1:14:52] infinite and how that he he warns his
[1:14:55] people to get things ready like in the
[1:14:58] antidolivian destruction. Like he's
[1:15:00] getting people ready today like he got
[1:15:03] that woman ready. Watch
[1:15:06] watch what that little U bed did later.
[1:15:09] See this part where the prophet talking
[1:15:11] about how God knew every prophet.
[1:15:13] Remember the prophet Jeremiah, God was
[1:15:15] God came to Jeremiah and he told him
[1:15:16] that when you were in your mother's
[1:15:19] belly, he knew you. And when you were in
[1:15:22] your mother's womb, he chose you. Then
[1:15:24] Jeremiah comes in saying, "Well, I'm a
[1:15:26] child." After God comes and says, "Don't
[1:15:27] say you're a child because I ordained
[1:15:29] you. I commanded you. I chose you and I
[1:15:31] will lead you." And the thing about it,
[1:15:34] the prophet said that God knows
[1:15:36] everything. And because he knows
[1:15:38] everything, he gives you warnings ahead
[1:15:40] of time. If you remember the prophecy
[1:15:42] that brother Brandham had given about
[1:15:44] the pope the pope God because in
[1:15:47] Jeremiah was talking about
[1:15:48] how how in Jeremiah God was talking
[1:15:52] about how he saw Jer Jeremiah in his
[1:15:55] mother's womb and in the time of the
[1:15:57] prophet God has seen the the the pope
[1:16:00] before he was even formed before the
[1:16:02] deeds was even done God has seen the
[1:16:04] popet after I told the prophet and the
[1:16:05] prophet came in and and prophesied and
[1:16:07] said watch out the pope is coming and
[1:16:09] he's giving you a warning and because of
[1:16:12] his omnicient that's why I say he's a
[1:16:14] watchman you're supposed to rely on him
[1:16:16] and I'm going to speak on why you should
[1:16:17] rely on him and why it's very important
[1:16:19] to rely on him because the prophet says
[1:16:20] it's the only way to be saved there's no
[1:16:23] other way to be saved
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:26] now the prophet continue and says make a
[1:16:28] way 1956 but order to be order to be God
[1:16:32] he has to know who will do that or he
[1:16:36] wasn't God cuz he is omnipotent He is
[1:16:41] omnipresent. He is omnisient. He knows
[1:16:43] everything. He is that every excuse me
[1:16:47] he is at every place and all powerful.
[1:16:51] So for knowledge looks back and says
[1:16:54] that he foraw this and knowed that's the
[1:16:59] reason he could tell what the end was
[1:17:02] from the beginning. from the very
[1:17:04] beginning. And therefore, knowing that
[1:17:08] all these marvelous days that we're
[1:17:11] living in now and to stand and witness
[1:17:14] and see the things that we see now, God
[1:17:17] had to make a preparation for it. See,
[1:17:20] God is omni. God is omnisient and he
[1:17:23] knows everything by his fornowledge.
[1:17:25] He's giving his people warning. He's
[1:17:27] giving his people signs as he gave the
[1:17:30] signs about um the Catholic church
[1:17:32] coming into power. He gave the signs for
[1:17:34] that as he gave saying if it was going
[1:17:36] to be a woman or or a priest or a
[1:17:39] Catholic that will rise into the seat of
[1:17:40] power. He gave every single prophecy
[1:17:43] that he gave came most of it already
[1:17:45] came true and those that haven't came
[1:17:47] true are build or in the process of
[1:17:49] coming true. You see, and the thing over
[1:17:52] here, the prophet God says that knowing
[1:17:54] that all these marvelous days that we're
[1:17:57] living in now and stand and witness and
[1:18:01] see the things that we see now, God had
[1:18:03] to make a preparation for it. See, when
[1:18:06] a prophecy is fulfilled, the prophet of
[1:18:09] God said that that's a witness because
[1:18:10] we have three witness. There's one
[1:18:12] that's us and that there's the prophecy
[1:18:14] being fulfilled and the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:16] which I'll get into that later. But the
[1:18:19] prophet God says that what is prophetic
[1:18:21] is just his knowledge.
[1:18:24] He's the chief attorney. He's the judge
[1:18:27] and he just speaks the lawyer the lawyer
[1:18:30] some of his wisdom. And that's what
[1:18:32] prophecy is that can foretell it because
[1:18:36] he knows that's what's going to be. See
[1:18:38] he says that prophetic is just his
[1:18:40] knowledge. That mean prophecy the future
[1:18:44] it's something special to us but to God
[1:18:45] it's like basic knowledge. It's
[1:18:47] something that he knows. It's that's why
[1:18:50] sometime when you go in um when you have
[1:18:52] a dream, let's say you have a dream
[1:18:53] about the future. Usually when you're
[1:18:54] telling that dream, you say I saw
[1:18:56] instead instead of saying this will
[1:18:59] happen, you're saying I saw I saw I saw
[1:19:01] you. You're speaking as if it's a past
[1:19:02] tense because prophecy and stuff like
[1:19:05] that to God. It's something that's it's
[1:19:07] already a done word. It's already a done
[1:19:09] deal.
[1:19:11] And the prophet says in Abraham and his
[1:19:15] seed after him. Amen. Not that God would
[1:19:18] say, "I choose you and condemn you."
[1:19:21] Never. But if he's infinite, how many
[1:19:25] believes he's infinite? Well, well, then
[1:19:29] he knowed from the from he knowed from
[1:19:31] the beginning that the end would be.
[1:19:34] That's what the scripture says. omni
[1:19:36] omnipresent, omnisient, omnipotent, and
[1:19:38] infinite. And now he's
[1:19:40] infinite by his knowledge. But he's for
[1:19:43] knowledge. He knew who would come to him
[1:19:47] and who would not come to him. He knew
[1:19:50] who would be saved and who would not be
[1:19:53] saved. That would that would certainly
[1:19:56] clear up Romans 8 and N for you. If
[1:20:00] there's any question about God whether
[1:20:03] he calls his children by election or not
[1:20:06] for there Paul speaking to Esau and
[1:20:08] Jacob before either child was born not
[1:20:12] even knowing what was right or wrong God
[1:20:15] said I love Jacob and hate Esau before
[1:20:18] either child had a way to even make a
[1:20:21] choice. God knew from the beginning what
[1:20:24] Esau was. He knowed what what Jacob was.
[1:20:28] In another in another quote, brother
[1:20:29] Brandon said that he God knew that Esau
[1:20:32] was a ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
[1:20:33] ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch. He knew
[1:20:34] the nature of Esau. Esau, he knew that
[1:20:37] Esau was not someone that that could be
[1:20:40] a part of him because if you remember
[1:20:43] when Jesus was talking to the Pharisees
[1:20:45] and they were claiming to be the
[1:20:46] children of Abraham and that that Jesus
[1:20:48] had told them that you're of your father
[1:20:50] the devil because they have nothing of
[1:20:52] God in them and in order to have
[1:20:54] something of God in them that mean you
[1:20:55] must have been back up yonder. must have
[1:20:57] been somewhere with God in the beginning
[1:20:59] before the foundation of the world.
[1:21:03] And the prophet of God says, "And he
[1:21:05] made creatures, and creatures fell, and
[1:21:09] then God by his infinite his infancy
[1:21:13] looked down through the stream of time,
[1:21:16] and saw every man that would be saved."
[1:21:20] Every man he knew it by fornowledge.
[1:21:23] Therefore, if he by for knowledge knew
[1:21:27] who would be saved and who would not be
[1:21:30] saved, he could predestinate.
[1:21:34] And I just want to I guess so the word
[1:21:37] is not such a bad word after all. Is it?
[1:21:41] He could predestinate because he knew
[1:21:44] who would and who would not. Therefore,
[1:21:47] in order to catch those who would, he
[1:21:50] had to make a propitiator, a
[1:21:53] propitiation for s for their sin.
[1:21:57] And oh, if we can, we want to get to it.
[1:22:02] Just a few verses below, the
[1:22:04] predestinated us to eternal life. He
[1:22:06] predestinated us to eternal life.
[1:22:08] Knowing that those who would lay aside
[1:22:10] everything and no matter how indifferent
[1:22:13] it would look towards the cho children
[1:22:15] towards the children of the world, it
[1:22:18] wouldn't mean one thing to them because
[1:22:20] they were children of God and he called
[1:22:23] them. See what I want you to notice is
[1:22:25] brother Brand has said God by his
[1:22:27] infinity looked down to the stream of
[1:22:30] time. If you know for those that I guess
[1:22:32] those that know that are are
[1:22:34] knowledgeable in science usually they
[1:22:36] have they come up with their own
[1:22:37] theories and stuff like that and there's
[1:22:39] this there's this one theory that they
[1:22:41] speak of where there's I guess it's a
[1:22:43] timeline theory based and the prophet of
[1:22:46] God says God God through all through all
[1:22:50] um stream of time meaning through every
[1:22:53] possibility that every possibility where
[1:22:56] where human the human science says well
[1:22:58] what if this what if this what if this
[1:23:00] and to them it's like if let's say you
[1:23:03] were going to a road and after there's A
[1:23:05] and there's B if you take B they
[1:23:08] automatically start creating another
[1:23:09] timeline saying that oh if you had taken
[1:23:12] um uh A this this would have happened
[1:23:14] but God the prophet God is saying that
[1:23:17] God already knew what you were going to
[1:23:18] choose that there's no stream and stuff
[1:23:20] like that there's no any type there's no
[1:23:23] any type of things such as like uh
[1:23:25] multiverse or anything like that because
[1:23:26] God already know God knows what you're
[1:23:29] going to choose and He predestinated you
[1:23:30] based on what you're going to choose.
[1:23:32] There's no whatifs or any type of thing
[1:23:34] like that. And the prophet continues and
[1:23:37] he talks about how he, as you remember
[1:23:40] last time we were talking about God's
[1:23:41] preparation. God had foreseen sin. He
[1:23:46] already saw that humans were going to
[1:23:48] fall. He saw the issue of sin. So he
[1:23:51] prepared the atonement before the
[1:23:53] foundation of the world. He prepared it
[1:23:55] before you even enter into your trials.
[1:23:57] Before you would ascend, before you
[1:23:58] fall, God had already prepared a
[1:24:01] solution for you. He already prepared,
[1:24:03] he already had the money and everything
[1:24:04] to purchase you.
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:07] Hallelujah. Now, in in 1960 Watchmen,
[1:24:11] War of the Night, Brother Brand says,
[1:24:13] "Now, before we approach the word,
[1:24:16] there's many people that can take the
[1:24:18] Bible and pull that cover back like
[1:24:21] that, but it takes God to open that
[1:24:24] word." See, God alone, it's it's of no
[1:24:28] private interpretation. Just read it and
[1:24:31] believe it. And in the prisoner of 1963,
[1:24:34] he says, "And now then, I want to try. I
[1:24:38] believe the Lord has somehow given me a
[1:24:41] little insight on the reasons why there
[1:24:45] is some people are not healed. I believe
[1:24:48] it's lack of understanding. I believe
[1:24:51] maybe we'll speak on that Sunday
[1:24:54] morning. The Lord's willing. See, or
[1:24:56] here the prophecies that it's only the
[1:24:58] word that interprets God's own um it's
[1:25:01] only the word that interprets God's
[1:25:03] word. It's only the spirit that
[1:25:05] interprets God's word because the
[1:25:06] scripture says that what
[1:25:08] um what knows a man's mind except the
[1:25:12] spirit of the man. That mean in order
[1:25:13] for you to interpret God's word, you
[1:25:15] need a spirit of God which is the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost. And then he says that in order
[1:25:19] for you to even have understanding
[1:25:21] insight, you need God because you can
[1:25:23] have your own proper understanding.
[1:25:25] That's what the pre the pas um the
[1:25:27] prophet preached about not leaning onto
[1:25:28] your own understanding. You need to ask
[1:25:30] for the insight of God, the
[1:25:31] understanding of God. Because if you
[1:25:33] have that understanding of God, even
[1:25:34] healing would be easier for you to get
[1:25:36] healed. If you understand what what the
[1:25:40] purpose of why God is healing you, if
[1:25:42] you understand the reason and
[1:25:44] everything, if you understand all that,
[1:25:46] your healing would even come to you even
[1:25:47] easier. It would be easier to believe.
[1:25:52] And the prophet say in the invisible
[1:25:54] union of the bride of of of Christ, may
[1:25:57] your spirit fall upon us and anoint the
[1:26:01] word to our heart. Amen. That we might
[1:26:04] go from here this evening. Amen. Better
[1:26:07] people than we are now. That we that we
[1:26:11] might come that we might have a closer
[1:26:14] insight on Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord,
[1:26:18] that we might understand the day that
[1:26:21] we're living in and the preparation of
[1:26:24] God for his people in this hour, this
[1:26:28] great crucial dark time that we're now
[1:26:32] living in. God anointed God anoint us
[1:26:36] not only speakers but hearer and
[1:26:39] together make our hearts to tremble at
[1:26:42] your word for the fear of the for the
[1:26:45] fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[1:26:47] Grant these things father for we ask in
[1:26:50] Jesus name. Amen. We're asking that God
[1:26:53] may give us an insight of his purpose.
[1:26:56] Give us an insight of the events that
[1:26:58] are happening around us. Because if God
[1:27:01] gives us an insight and understanding of
[1:27:03] what's happening around us, it will give
[1:27:05] us courage. It will give us courage to
[1:27:08] rely more on him. It will give it will
[1:27:10] push us. In fact, it will push us to
[1:27:13] even manifest the third pool if we
[1:27:15] understand God's purpose and what the
[1:27:17] events are happening around us.
[1:27:20] And the prophecies in the testament of a
[1:27:22] true witness. Yes, sir. There was there
[1:27:25] was the prophet's word fulfilled. There
[1:27:28] was the people
[1:27:31] There was there was the prophets word
[1:27:35] fulfilled.
[1:27:36] There was the people bearing witness.
[1:27:39] And there was the Holy Ghost itself.
[1:27:43] There is three of them. And the Bible
[1:27:46] said in a mouth of three witness, let
[1:27:48] every word be established. That's right.
[1:27:51] There was the prophet's word fulfilled.
[1:27:53] There was the people said something has
[1:27:56] happened to me. Something has happened.
[1:28:00] I'm no more afraid. I'm not afraid of
[1:28:03] death. I'm not afraid of nothing.
[1:28:05] Something happened. I forgot all my
[1:28:08] theology. I forgot all my man-made
[1:28:11] traditions. Something has happened. Let
[1:28:14] this be known to you. And hurricane to
[1:28:17] my words, these are not drunk. They they
[1:28:21] lost all their dignity. They were just
[1:28:24] drunk on the spirit. And I pray that we
[1:28:27] all could be drunk on the spirit
[1:28:28] tonight. Because if we're drunk on the
[1:28:31] spirit tonight, it will reveal all
[1:28:32] things to us. It would give us all
[1:28:34] understanding. And it would by us having
[1:28:37] understanding, it will remove fear from
[1:28:39] our heart. It will remove fear from our
[1:28:41] mind, from our whole being.
[1:28:44] The reason why a lot of people fear over
[1:28:47] the books of revelation is because they
[1:28:49] don't have an insight in it. They don't
[1:28:50] have an understanding in it. And the
[1:28:52] only way to have an insight and
[1:28:53] understanding in it is to have the Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost to have the mind of God. And the
[1:28:57] mind of God was revealed in this age in
[1:28:59] the message through the message of the
[1:29:01] hour. So the only way for you to have an
[1:29:03] understanding on the book of Revelation
[1:29:05] so you can remove the fear of what's
[1:29:08] written in there is to have the mind of
[1:29:10] God is to have the message of the hour.
[1:29:13] And the prophet continues. He says they
[1:29:15] said we are his witness. Now, there was
[1:29:19] three
[1:29:21] definite definite witnesses at
[1:29:23] Pentecost. Yes, sir. First, the word of
[1:29:26] those prophets. That's right. That God
[1:29:28] would pour out his spirit in the last
[1:29:31] days upon the people. The witness that
[1:29:35] the prophets had was the word of God. It
[1:29:39] had been fulfilled. That was one
[1:29:42] witness. The prophet's message was
[1:29:44] fulfilled. I'll pour out of my spirit
[1:29:48] upon all flesh. They shall have
[1:29:51] stammering lips and other tongues will I
[1:29:54] speak to this people. There it was. They
[1:29:58] couldn't deny it. Then there was three
[1:30:00] witness. That was one that the prophet's
[1:30:03] word had been fulfilled. The other
[1:30:05] witness was the people. They were
[1:30:07] testifying something has happened. See
[1:30:09] the word of the word of God. The word of
[1:30:13] God through the prophet had been
[1:30:15] fulfilled and that fulfillment is a
[1:30:17] witness and us by observing that
[1:30:20] prophecy being fulfilled. That makes us
[1:30:23] also a witness of it. Because to be a
[1:30:25] witness, you have to be there. You have
[1:30:27] to see something to be a witness. And
[1:30:29] that's exactly why in this age by you
[1:30:32] witnessing the prophet being fulfilled
[1:30:34] that makes you the witness. And the
[1:30:36] prophet says that we are his witness. In
[1:30:39] order to be his witness, you need to
[1:30:41] have the spirit of God in you to be his
[1:30:43] witness.
[1:30:46] And the prophet says, his word testifies
[1:30:50] in the last days that there will come a
[1:30:53] falling away and there will come up a
[1:30:56] cold, formal, powerless church age.
[1:30:59] That's what we're living in. a church
[1:31:03] that had no power, having a form of
[1:31:06] godliness, but denying the power
[1:31:08] thereof. From such turn
[1:31:10] away, he gave the sign that there would
[1:31:14] be times when a man would sit in the
[1:31:18] temple of God, showing himself he was
[1:31:21] God. He's He'd come ruling the nation.
[1:31:24] He was perfect. How perfectly all these
[1:31:28] things how God's word has been perfect.
[1:31:30] See the fact that God's word are perfect
[1:31:32] that are being fulfilled. That's what
[1:31:34] makes it a witness. And the prophet of
[1:31:36] God is saying that there will be a
[1:31:37] church which is in this time if you go
[1:31:39] look outside the world there's a bunch
[1:31:41] of people that cannot even man. You
[1:31:43] don't see the power of God in their
[1:31:44] church. You don't see the power of God
[1:31:46] because they don't have God in their
[1:31:48] church. They don't have the spirit of
[1:31:49] God. They only have the letter. They
[1:31:50] only have um the mechanic. They only
[1:31:54] read the letter because the letter kill
[1:31:55] it. But if you have the spirit of God
[1:31:56] that gives life, if you got the spirit
[1:31:58] of God that will interpret, if you got
[1:31:59] the spirit of God that's giving you
[1:32:02] understanding, insight, and for
[1:32:03] knowledge, it will lead you to all
[1:32:05] things. And and the prophet God says
[1:32:07] it's simply perfect.
[1:32:09] And he says he said, "I'm waiting,
[1:32:12] brother Brennham, to see to see what
[1:32:15] will what will be said there." The Holy
[1:32:18] Spirit went away back down through his
[1:32:21] life. That's right. all all the way back
[1:32:24] to when something happened told him
[1:32:26] about it and what happened and what
[1:32:29] condition all about it and told him that
[1:32:32] told him that thing what was it God's
[1:32:34] spirit giving witness see the Holy Ghost
[1:32:37] is witness see you know the thing is the
[1:32:41] Holy Spirit is a witness to you and when
[1:32:43] the Holy Spirit is witnessing to you it
[1:32:45] can witness for you or against you can
[1:32:49] witness for you as in when something
[1:32:52] happened as it was the prophet just gave
[1:32:54] a perfect example as in something
[1:32:55] happened it will bring it to your
[1:32:56] remembrance and that they tell you for
[1:32:58] example uh the prophecy say you see the
[1:32:59] prophet spoke about this he bring it to
[1:33:01] your remembrance and the the Bible even
[1:33:04] says that if you have the Holy Ghost it
[1:33:06] will bring things that God knows into
[1:33:08] your remembrance and and the other part
[1:33:11] where the Holy Ghost can witness against
[1:33:13] you in a sense is if you do wrong it
[1:33:16] will go tell on you every wrong thing
[1:33:18] that you're doing it's keeping record of
[1:33:20] it that You need to watch your step. You
[1:33:22] need to watch everything that you're
[1:33:23] doing because all of those will catch up
[1:33:25] to you. And the Holy Spirit is the one
[1:33:28] that's that's witnessing it and that's
[1:33:30] keeping track of everything that you're
[1:33:32] doing. So, might as well just stay with
[1:33:34] the word. That way, if you stay with the
[1:33:37] word, the Holy Ghost will witness for
[1:33:40] you. It will witness with you instead of
[1:33:42] witnessing against you.
[1:33:45] Just like um like uh what's it called?
[1:33:49] when the uh rich young ruler when he
[1:33:52] went to hell the and he was talking to
[1:33:54] Abraham and he was telling Abraham, "Oh,
[1:33:56] can you
[1:33:57] um send someone over there so they can
[1:34:00] be saved and stuff like that." And the
[1:34:02] thing is when he was in hell, the thing
[1:34:05] that was condemning him was the fact
[1:34:07] that he had people telling him, he had
[1:34:10] people telling him the right path, but
[1:34:12] he wasn't listening. See he had people
[1:34:14] tell him but now that inside was it was
[1:34:17] witnessing against him telling him you
[1:34:18] remember the word of God came to you did
[1:34:20] not listen the word of God came to you
[1:34:22] and did this this this you did not
[1:34:23] listen that's why even in judgment when
[1:34:25] people will say oh Lord God when I when
[1:34:27] did I treat you wrong and God said
[1:34:31] whenever you did to one of these see the
[1:34:33] holy whenever you're treating the Holy
[1:34:35] Ghost bad within a believer because the
[1:34:37] believer is a witness that that's
[1:34:39] witnessing against you and now within
[1:34:42] yourself If you're doing wrong, the Holy
[1:34:44] Ghost will also witness against you.
[1:34:48] And the prophet of God says, they say,
[1:34:50] "We are his witness because we are
[1:34:53] filled with a s with a which is the Holy
[1:34:56] Ghost." Peter said, "You men of Judea
[1:35:00] and you that dwell in Jerusalem, let
[1:35:03] this be known unto you. These are not
[1:35:06] drunk as you suppose, seeing it's the
[1:35:08] third hour of the day, but this is that
[1:35:11] which was spoken of by the prophet Joel.
[1:35:14] It shall come to pass in this last in
[1:35:17] this last day, says God. I'll pour out
[1:35:19] my spirit upon the flesh. We are bearing
[1:35:22] witness that the prophets the prophet's
[1:35:25] word are true because we are filled now.
[1:35:29] Amen. See, if the prophet's words are
[1:35:32] true, which is the word of God, God
[1:35:33] speaking to the prophet. That's why the
[1:35:35] the that's why the prophet has said that
[1:35:38] this is the only way to be saved because
[1:35:39] it is true. If it is true and he's
[1:35:41] giving you a warning and say if you go
[1:35:43] left, you're going to get injured. You
[1:35:45] doubting it. That mean you're going to
[1:35:47] get injured. That mean there's no other
[1:35:49] way to escape it except for listening to
[1:35:51] the word of God because that's the only
[1:35:53] way to be saved. And the prophet continu
[1:35:56] says Jesus in Mark 16
[1:35:59] that the Holy Ghost Yes sir. when he
[1:36:02] come he would testify in every
[1:36:05] succeeding generation to come every
[1:36:08] generation to the end. He said these
[1:36:12] signs go ye into all the world and
[1:36:15] preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:36:18] These signs shall follow them that
[1:36:21] believe in my name. They shall cast out
[1:36:24] devils. Now long, how long is this
[1:36:27] witness going to be? To the end of the
[1:36:30] world, how long? Every generation in my
[1:36:34] name, they shall cast out devils. They
[1:36:37] shall speak with new tongues. If they if
[1:36:40] they taking up, if they taking up
[1:36:43] serpents or drink deadly drinks, it
[1:36:46] would it wouldn't harm them. If they lay
[1:36:48] hands on the sick, they shall recover.
[1:36:52] Amen. Jesus said that the Holy Spirit
[1:36:55] that he would send would be a witness to
[1:36:59] the end of the age every generation
[1:37:02] afterwards. Now, being that he said that
[1:37:06] we are his witnesses. Amen. In closing,
[1:37:09] listen. Pull on your understanding now
[1:37:12] and listen on close. We are as I close.
[1:37:17] We are his witness who have received his
[1:37:21] spirit. That mean to be his witness, you
[1:37:23] have to receive his spirit. And there's
[1:37:25] no other way. And in another place,
[1:37:29] brother Brennham has said
[1:37:34] uh give me a second. In another place,
[1:37:36] brother Brennan was talking about uh
[1:37:38] being a witness and how there's
[1:37:40] different all kinds of witness in in um
[1:37:44] the testimony of a true witness.
[1:37:46] Paragraph 233. Brother Brandon says
[1:37:48] this. We have we have all kinds of
[1:37:51] witness. We have all kinds. We have
[1:37:54] Methodist witness, Baptist witness,
[1:37:57] Presbyterian witness. We have
[1:38:01] um we even have message witness. Amen.
[1:38:05] We even have Jehovah witnesses which
[1:38:07] y'all know. See, Catholic witness. I'm
[1:38:10] going to I'm going to preach next Sunday
[1:38:12] the Lord willing on the four different
[1:38:15] stages of church if the Lord willing.
[1:38:17] Now we all now we have all kinds of
[1:38:22] witness today but there is one true
[1:38:25] witness and I'm going to tell you where
[1:38:27] where that one true witness is in
[1:38:29] paragraph 185. The prophet says let me
[1:38:32] tell you let me tell you something else.
[1:38:36] Why did this little fellow Why did this
[1:38:38] this little fellow sitting over here
[1:38:41] called hanging bath? A deacon
[1:38:45] was excuse me a
[1:38:50] deacon a deacon was here in the church
[1:38:53] served his time out and and now just a
[1:38:56] loyal member he raised this morning to
[1:38:59] speak in tongue I believe and prophesy.
[1:39:02] Why did that Holy Spirit said in this
[1:39:05] morning when he was giving
[1:39:07] interpretation? See the Holy Spirit
[1:39:09] giving interpretation. I have anointed
[1:39:12] my servant to bring you things that you
[1:39:15] ought to know. That mean it's a must.
[1:39:17] You have to know this. If you're a child
[1:39:20] of God, you have to know this. There's
[1:39:22] no deviating for it. In fact, if you
[1:39:24] want to be raptured, you have to know
[1:39:26] these things. You have to know the word
[1:39:27] of God.
[1:39:29] You have to know. Uh oh. Why? And I
[1:39:32] heard him standing here with my head
[1:39:35] down was choking the tears down through
[1:39:37] my heart. That meant no no more. I had
[1:39:40] never said a word to him or nobody else
[1:39:45] what I speak on cuz I just come to the
[1:39:47] pulpit and there there he was revealed
[1:39:51] the text and told the people to set
[1:39:54] themselves in order for it. It'll speak
[1:39:57] to you. Yes, sir. It'll speak to you.
[1:40:00] said, "I've sent him to many nations, to
[1:40:04] many people this same message as in this
[1:40:07] same message here, and I'll speak to you
[1:40:11] this morning. Take heed to it." He said,
[1:40:14] "For I have anointed him and sent him
[1:40:18] in." Oh God, what is it? The Holy Ghost,
[1:40:21] the true witness of God. What is it?
[1:40:25] Deity tabernacle in man. Hallelujah.
[1:40:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:30] All nature still witnessed there is a
[1:40:33] God. He still remains God like he was
[1:40:37] was the first tree he ever created. Is
[1:40:40] that right? See, brother Brandon says
[1:40:42] that the only witness because he says
[1:40:43] there's we have all these type of
[1:40:45] different witnesses but the only witness
[1:40:47] is the Holy Ghost. And that brother
[1:40:48] Brandon says that deity tabernacle in
[1:40:51] men. That's that's where the Holy Ghost
[1:40:52] is. The Holy Ghost is deity tabernacle
[1:40:55] in men. And I believe we have vessels
[1:40:57] here that have deity that's residing in
[1:41:00] them. I believe so. And he says that
[1:41:02] nature still witness there is a God. All
[1:41:06] of nature still witness there is a God.
[1:41:08] If you look at um brother Brandham
[1:41:12] um the fact that brother Brandham saw um
[1:41:16] preached a whole sermon off a pack of
[1:41:18] cigarette. See that's speaking that
[1:41:19] nature itself testify of God. You can
[1:41:21] look at creation, look at the sun,
[1:41:23] everything. You can see the sun, how God
[1:41:24] is good, how we rely on the sun, and
[1:41:27] just how we need to rely on the son,
[1:41:29] which is Jesus Christ. You see, you can
[1:41:30] look at the constellation. You can look
[1:41:32] at everything, all of nature, and see
[1:41:35] how everything works so perfectly. All
[1:41:37] of that is testifying of God. All of
[1:41:40] that is speaking and witnessing of God.
[1:41:42] And that and all of that, all he does is
[1:41:44] it's speaking about God's supreme
[1:41:45] intelligence. If you ever noticed,
[1:41:48] brother Brennham says God's witness, the
[1:41:51] Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost itself living
[1:41:53] in us would never affiliate itself in
[1:41:56] organizations.
[1:41:58] You can't organize God.
[1:42:01] You can't organize God. He's God. What
[1:42:04] will it do? Go back the way it was at
[1:42:08] the first place. Oh, go back to the
[1:42:10] beginning. Back to the original. Back to
[1:42:12] where it started from. It's baptized the
[1:42:15] same way they did. It'll teach the Holy
[1:42:17] Ghost the same way it did. They'll teach
[1:42:20] the people the same way it did. It'll
[1:42:22] abstain from organizations like they
[1:42:25] did. It will have a room for all like
[1:42:29] they did. Who will come? They will be
[1:42:32] clean and holy like they did. They will
[1:42:35] be filled with the spirit like they
[1:42:37] were. They will be fearless like they
[1:42:40] were.
[1:42:42] And the same things that happened to
[1:42:44] them will happen to these in the last
[1:42:47] days in the evening light like it was
[1:42:50] back before. God sent that voice call
[1:42:53] out. And I believe God had already sent
[1:42:55] that voice that call out through the
[1:42:57] prophet of through the prophet of the
[1:42:58] hour. And God is saying that if you have
[1:43:00] the spirit of God, if you have the Holy
[1:43:02] Ghost, it will remove you from from
[1:43:04] being affiliated with clicks, for being
[1:43:06] affiliated with different organization.
[1:43:08] It will push you away from anything
[1:43:09] that's contrary to the word. It will
[1:43:11] keep you aligned with God if you have
[1:43:13] the Holy Ghost. That's what the prophet
[1:43:15] of God is telling you. It say if you
[1:43:17] have it, you will have the same mind
[1:43:18] that they had. You will have the same
[1:43:20] mind that they had which was the mind of
[1:43:21] Christ. But he say if this mind be in
[1:43:23] you, it will even quicken your mortal
[1:43:25] body just like he did Christ. That's why
[1:43:27] the prophet of God also came and say
[1:43:28] that he preached like Paul. Why? Because
[1:43:31] he had that same mind. He had that Holy
[1:43:33] Spirit in him. He preached like Paul
[1:43:36] and
[1:43:38] and excuse me
[1:43:41] and
[1:43:56] that's that's what the prophet of God
[1:43:58] once was speaking about how certain
[1:44:00] people say that the days of miracles and
[1:44:02] all that has passed away. old that it
[1:44:04] stopped with the u the apostles the time
[1:44:06] in the opera room but then he said that
[1:44:08] we see the same thing happening today
[1:44:09] that mean it's not over it's still today
[1:44:11] that mean if you have that same spirit
[1:44:12] you will manifest what they did during
[1:44:14] their time you will do the exact same
[1:44:16] you will stick with the word manifest
[1:44:17] signs and the power and demonstration of
[1:44:20] God if you have that spirit of God in
[1:44:21] you
[1:44:23] and the prophet of God says in testimony
[1:44:25] prophets prophets back there witness and
[1:44:29] had the word of God and spoke the word
[1:44:31] of God and It was fulfilled right before
[1:44:34] them.
[1:44:36] Excuse me. And God said, "If there be
[1:44:39] one among you who is super who is
[1:44:42] spiritual or or a prophet, I the Lord
[1:44:46] will make myself known to him. In
[1:44:48] visions, speak to him in dreams."
[1:44:52] And if what he says come to pass, then
[1:44:56] hear him. That's right. And I'll tell
[1:44:59] you, it's time for falling out. All
[1:45:01] right. falling out of the things of the
[1:45:04] world. Where will you fall, brother
[1:45:07] Brennham? Back into the arm of God.
[1:45:10] That's right. Let the Holy Ghost bear
[1:45:12] witness, he is God's witness. And
[1:45:16] the scripture, the prophet quoting said
[1:45:18] that if anyone among you have visions,
[1:45:21] have vision and speaks and if God speaks
[1:45:24] to them in his dream and he prophesy,
[1:45:26] all what he says come to pass to hear
[1:45:28] him. Brother Brennham came and God spoke
[1:45:30] to brother Brennham. God showed him
[1:45:32] vision visions. Brother Brandham in fact
[1:45:34] could stand right here talking to you at
[1:45:36] the same time seeing a vision at the
[1:45:38] same time seeing um seeing heaven and
[1:45:42] tell you about what happened in your
[1:45:44] heart. Tell you what's happening in
[1:45:45] heaven. He can see it both at the he can
[1:45:47] see both planes of existence at the same
[1:45:49] time. And we had a man like that. And
[1:45:52] God is saying that you need to hear him.
[1:45:53] Yet there are people that that hear
[1:45:55] about that. There are people that are
[1:45:57] saying that and they're refusing to
[1:45:58] listen to it. They're rejecting the word
[1:46:00] of God. They're rejecting the word of
[1:46:02] God by rejecting the messenger of God.
[1:46:04] You see, and God is telling you to stay
[1:46:06] away from the world. Stay away from the
[1:46:08] desire of the world. Stay away from
[1:46:09] being associated with the things of the
[1:46:12] world.
[1:46:15] All all nature, all everywhere testifies
[1:46:20] the heaven, the skies, so many things. I
[1:46:23] sitting in my study yesterday. I wrote
[1:46:25] down I won't have time to go to it but
[1:46:28] you can just look around to anything
[1:46:31] that God created gives testimony to his
[1:46:34] glory. Anything any creation of God
[1:46:38] gives testimony to God and for his
[1:46:40] purpose shows the great supreme
[1:46:43] intelligence. So he's saying for
[1:46:45] everything the fact that everything
[1:46:46] works for his pro purpose whether it
[1:46:50] appears to be good or bad to you but to
[1:46:53] God it works for his purpose and the
[1:46:55] prophet of God saying that since
[1:46:56] everything works for his purpose and
[1:46:58] everything is testifying of God all of
[1:47:01] that speaks of his supreme intelligence
[1:47:03] all of that that's why earlier I even
[1:47:05] mentioned if you look at it the universe
[1:47:08] all of it everything working um in one
[1:47:10] accord everything you see every you see
[1:47:13] um a pattern pattern in creation. You
[1:47:15] see a pattern in in the universe and
[1:47:18] people are trying to grasp how did this
[1:47:20] p pattern came to be or how could a man
[1:47:23] make such pattern and man cannot by the
[1:47:25] supreme intelligence of Jesus Christ the
[1:47:27] supreme intelligence of God is what made
[1:47:29] all this pattern that can keep all of it
[1:47:31] together because sometime I would look
[1:47:33] at certain things that man made and I'm
[1:47:35] like the the person that made this is
[1:47:37] extremely smart but when you look at
[1:47:38] creation the word everything make it
[1:47:40] makes the creation of men look like
[1:47:42] child's play because that's the supreme
[1:47:44] intelligence that works behind it and
[1:47:46] the things that God make does not falter
[1:47:48] does not um does
[1:47:50] not does not falter and does not uh last
[1:47:54] for a few days and it could be eternal
[1:47:56] because everything that God creates is
[1:47:58] eternal if it's not created from God
[1:48:00] because the prophet speaks about sin
[1:48:02] because sin is not created I mean sin
[1:48:05] everything that created has pardon
[1:48:08] me everything that God
[1:48:11] creates it he can create it for a very
[1:48:14] long period of time compared to humans.
[1:48:18] But now the prophet God speaks about how
[1:48:20] God created sin. And when he created
[1:48:23] sin, excuse me, when he created
[1:48:28] sin, help me Lord. When God, when God
[1:48:33] created sin, which was a perversion of
[1:48:35] the truth, because everything that comes
[1:48:36] out of God is eternal and everything
[1:48:39] that God knows is also eternal. And the
[1:48:42] thing is about sin and lies which is the
[1:48:47] thing is about sin and lies because lies
[1:48:49] sin is a perversion of of
[1:48:51] of the truth. A lie is the perversion of
[1:48:54] the truth. In order for you to have a
[1:48:56] lie you have to have the truth. You just
[1:48:58] need to take the the truth and twist it
[1:49:00] a little bit and you'll find yourself in
[1:49:02] a lie. And sin was the only thing that
[1:49:05] was created. and sin. Sin with all
[1:49:09] creation. The word says the the word of
[1:49:11] God says that everything, excuse
[1:49:15] me, everything. He says, the word of God
[1:49:18] says that his word does not pass away,
[1:49:20] but
[1:49:21] everything everything else passes away.
[1:49:24] The heaven and the earth will pass away,
[1:49:25] but his word will not pass away. And the
[1:49:28] reason why which ties back to the
[1:49:30] omnition of God, his word does not pass
[1:49:32] away because in all eternity he searched
[1:49:35] in all eternity. Before God speaks a
[1:49:38] word in the in the back part of his mind
[1:49:41] before God speaks a word, he searches in
[1:49:44] all eternity. He searches in all
[1:49:45] possibility. Then he speaks. And that's
[1:49:48] why his word does not falter.
[1:49:51] And the prophet of God says that this
[1:49:54] tower man, he got up and then if
[1:49:57] anything happened, he was supposed to
[1:50:00] warn the people of any approach, any
[1:50:04] approaching danger. We see our Lord
[1:50:06] Jesus when he was here on earth. He was
[1:50:11] great watchman. He was the great
[1:50:13] watchman of the hour.
[1:50:15] He was He was here on earth. He was the
[1:50:19] great watchman of the hour. We noticed
[1:50:21] that in his earthly journey. He talked
[1:50:24] more about his second coming than he did
[1:50:28] his going away. He said more about his
[1:50:31] second coming many times more than he
[1:50:34] did of his going away. Right in the
[1:50:37] shadows of the cross, he kept talking
[1:50:40] about his second coming and warning the
[1:50:43] people what would take place just before
[1:50:45] his second coming. He was the watchman.
[1:50:48] He was the chief of the watchman. You
[1:50:50] see the thing is because remember
[1:50:53] earlier I told you I was talking about
[1:50:55] why you should listen to God and God is
[1:50:57] the watchman. Why you should listen to
[1:50:58] that watchman? And as and as I'm closing
[1:51:01] the musician can start coming. And the
[1:51:04] thing
[1:51:05] about why you should listen to God
[1:51:08] because he's omnisient. The simple
[1:51:09] answer is because he's omnisient. And
[1:51:11] because of his omnisient, because he's
[1:51:14] omnisient, God whenever he makes a
[1:51:16] decision, he never has a plan B. Because
[1:51:19] if you remember with Esther, God had
[1:51:22] chose Esther. And when Esther had a
[1:51:24] complex, he's her own personal complex.
[1:51:27] And at that Mori, the prophet had to
[1:51:29] come in and wake her up. The Mori came
[1:51:32] in and told her, "If you don't do it,
[1:51:33] redemption will come from elsewhere. You
[1:51:35] don't even know. Maybe this is your very
[1:51:37] purpose." And because God already knew
[1:51:39] that she was predestined, that she was
[1:51:41] going to do it, God chose her. That's
[1:51:44] why it wasn't anyone else. God chose
[1:51:46] her. Just like um Mary, God knew that
[1:51:49] she was the person who would receive the
[1:51:52] prophecy of a virgin birth. She was the
[1:51:54] only one who would keep herself and
[1:51:56] would receive it easily. That's why God
[1:51:58] doesn't have a plan B. Whenever God
[1:52:00] makes a decision, it's absolute. And
[1:52:02] because it's absolute, it's absolute
[1:52:05] because he already knows it through
[1:52:07] fornowledge. And he has the inside of it
[1:52:10] which is understanding. And all of those
[1:52:13] combined speaks of the supreme
[1:52:14] intelligence of God. And because of all
[1:52:17] those things, that's the reason why you
[1:52:18] should rely on God. That's the reason
[1:52:20] why you should rely on the words that
[1:52:22] God speak through his prophet and his
[1:52:24] messenger. Amen.
[1:52:30] I'll read one more quote from brother
[1:52:33] Brandham to to
[1:52:35] close. Brother Brandham says in
[1:52:37] testimony paragraph 104 he says David in
[1:52:40] the spirit as I like to refer to as I
[1:52:44] like to refer to it as Jesus said there.
[1:52:47] Why did why did David in the spirit
[1:52:49] called him Lord? David, not David but
[1:52:53] David in the spirit.
[1:52:55] He says there is a lot of difference
[1:52:58] between David and David in the spirit.
[1:53:01] There is a lot of difference between
[1:53:04] church and church in the spirit. Why did
[1:53:08] David in the spirit call him Lord if he
[1:53:11] was his son saying the Lord said to my
[1:53:16] Lord sit thou on my right hand? They
[1:53:20] could ask, answer him no more, ask him
[1:53:23] no more questions after that. But David
[1:53:27] in this 22nd Psalm fell into a
[1:53:31] spirit, this
[1:53:33] spirit. And when he did, he even gave
[1:53:37] the words that he groomed at the cross.
[1:53:41] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[1:53:43] me? All my all my bones, they stare at
[1:53:47] me. and and how my pierced my hands. How
[1:53:51] they pierced my hands and my feet. Yet
[1:53:54] he was wounded for our transgression.
[1:53:58] Come across the other prophets, bruised
[1:54:01] for our iniquity, and chastisement for
[1:54:04] our peace was upon him. And with his
[1:54:07] stripes, we were healed.
[1:54:10] Now watch this. the accuracy, the
[1:54:14] perfection of those prophets. Not one
[1:54:17] word did they speak about him, but what
[1:54:22] come to pass the last seven prophecies
[1:54:25] give of him was answered in the last
[1:54:29] seven hours on the cross.
[1:54:32] He w how that every word was fulfilled.
[1:54:37] Not one thing was left was left undone.
[1:54:42] And the prophet says, what does it speak
[1:54:45] of? The prophecies is supreme
[1:54:48] intelligence. The fact that all those
[1:54:50] prophecies that came to that David was
[1:54:54] prophesying about Jesus Christ came to
[1:54:55] fulfillment. The prophet of God is
[1:54:57] saying that that all of that is the
[1:54:59] supreme intelligence because nothing
[1:55:01] else could have orchestrated it to be
[1:55:02] that perfect. And the supreme
[1:55:04] intelligence is God himself. Amen. The
[1:55:07] supreme intelligent. It wasn't those
[1:55:09] men. Those men were just men like you
[1:55:12] and I. That's exactly right. Just like
[1:55:15] everything brother Brandham has said,
[1:55:16] brother Brandon was a man just like you
[1:55:18] and you and I. But it was the supreme
[1:55:20] intelligence that brother Brandham was
[1:55:22] relying on that was giving forth these
[1:55:25] words that were coming to true that were
[1:55:27] coming um to pass that we're witnessing
[1:55:30] that are coming to pass. It was a
[1:55:32] supreme intelligence that whatever
[1:55:34] brother Brennham is speaking sometime he
[1:55:36] may not even give you u the reference
[1:55:39] but he aligns perfectly with the Bible.
[1:55:41] The reason why he aligns perfectly with
[1:55:43] the Bible is because he had that supreme
[1:55:45] intelligence behind him guiding him.
[1:55:49] And he continues says, "Those men were
[1:55:51] just men like you and I, but they were
[1:55:55] inspired by a supreme being which was
[1:55:59] giving testimony that we in this
[1:56:02] generation and in the generation to come
[1:56:04] and all generations between them and
[1:56:07] here look could look upon his word and
[1:56:13] know that they are true. is a testimony
[1:56:17] that the word of God is truth.
[1:56:21] All his works are perfect. They are
[1:56:24] perfect and on time. They don't miss one
[1:56:27] hour. Sometime we think they're going to
[1:56:30] but they don't after it's all after it's
[1:56:34] over. We seen it. It couldn't come any
[1:56:37] quicker. It couldn't have been any
[1:56:39] better. It's perfect and it's on time.
[1:56:42] Just like Jesus Christ when he came to
[1:56:44] Lazarus's tomb. People would have
[1:56:46] expected him to come earlier when he was
[1:56:48] sick but he didn't and when he came he
[1:56:51] was already four days late and people
[1:56:53] were were thinking probably it would
[1:56:55] have been late. But Martha has said even
[1:56:58] now if you speak even now if you speak
[1:57:01] see everything is perfect it doesn't
[1:57:03] mess it be it was just perfectly aligned
[1:57:06] and and the reason why even God terried
[1:57:10] was to glorify his name to show glor to
[1:57:13] glorify his name to glorify himself in
[1:57:16] the son because if he had came and and
[1:57:18] healed him healed him from his disease
[1:57:21] people don't just say well this this
[1:57:23] probably because of doctor probably
[1:57:24] because he rested etc etc
[1:57:26] But because he had died,
[1:57:30] not not just three days, not just one
[1:57:32] day, but four days, four days in the
[1:57:35] tomb already rotten, because that
[1:57:38] happened, all the glory goes back to
[1:57:40] God.
[1:57:42] Even in our day today when we see these
[1:57:45] visions happen and of things take place
[1:57:48] and they're foretold and we wonder when
[1:57:52] they'll be fulfilled what will take
[1:57:54] place but we find out that they're
[1:57:57] they're perfect and on time exactly.
[1:58:00] Amen. Amen. So we find out that the
[1:58:04] omnisient the omnisient God if you break
[1:58:08] down the word omnisient to try to
[1:58:09] understand why is it important to listen
[1:58:11] to God. The omnisient God has
[1:58:13] fornowledge and insight. That's why
[1:58:15] that's why it's very important to listen
[1:58:17] to him. That's why his purpose always
[1:58:20] comes to pass because of his
[1:58:22] fornowledge, his understanding and his
[1:58:24] insight. And he sees he sees like the
[1:58:27] prophet said that his prophetics is his
[1:58:30] knowledge. He knows it. It's it's a
[1:58:33] present tense for him. That's why you
[1:58:35] even look when the prophet was looking
[1:58:37] in the vision. When the prophet was
[1:58:39] looking, he was being um raptured, he
[1:58:41] turned back after he saw that the United
[1:58:43] States was in ash. He was saying that I
[1:58:44] saw. He he was saying that I saw because
[1:58:47] to God, it's already a done work. It's
[1:58:49] already a done work. There's nothing
[1:58:51] that you you there's nothing you can do
[1:58:52] beside relying on God's word. So I
[1:58:55] encourage you tonight to rely on God's
[1:58:57] insight, to rely on God's knowledge, to
[1:58:58] rely on God's on God's word. And by you
[1:59:01] relying on God's word, guy relying on
[1:59:03] God's insight, it makes you a witness.
[1:59:05] And by you having the witness inside you
[1:59:07] and you witnessing the prophets the pro
[1:59:10] the prophecy being fulfilled and all of
[1:59:12] those happening because of God. And
[1:59:15] that's that's my message tonight for the
[1:59:18] omnisient um God.
[1:59:21] May God bless you.
[1:59:25] If we can stand and go to the Lord in
[1:59:27] prayer.
[1:59:29] [Applause]
[1:59:35] Lord heavenly father, we come to you
[1:59:36] this evening. First off we come to you
[1:59:38] to thank you. Lord heavenly father.
[1:59:40] Thank you for your word that was brought
[1:59:42] forth. Lord heavenly father. Thank you
[1:59:43] for everything that was said. Thank you
[1:59:44] for everything that was done. Lord
[1:59:46] heavenly father, I believe, Lord
[1:59:47] heavenly father, you have spoken to
[1:59:49] someone. You have touched someone. Lord
[1:59:50] God, Lord heavenly father, you're the
[1:59:52] god who know all things. Lord God, may
[1:59:54] Lord heavenly father forgive me Lord
[1:59:55] Jesus Christ for my mistakes and errors
[1:59:57] Lord Jesus Christ. Wherever Lord Jesus
[1:59:59] Christ myself I I may have tried to
[2:00:01] enter and may you forgive me for those.
[2:00:03] I pray Lord heavenly father that your
[2:00:05] spirit Lord heavenly father that was in
[2:00:07] Jesus Christ your spirit that was in the
[2:00:08] prophet that was breaking down the
[2:00:10] prophet breaking down your word to the
[2:00:12] prophet Lord Jesus Christ revealing all
[2:00:14] those things may you reveal it to Lord
[2:00:16] Jesus Christ your children Lord Jesus
[2:00:17] Christ may you may you reveal Lord Jesus
[2:00:20] Christ your pure word to your people
[2:00:21] Lord Jesus Christ may you bring them to
[2:00:23] an understanding that they may catch
[2:00:25] Lord heavenly father your your omnisient
[2:00:28] Lord Jesus Christ and that they may rely
[2:00:29] on you Lord heavenly father as they're
[2:00:31] going through their trials Lord heavenly
[2:00:33] Father, you already told us that you
[2:00:35] chose us before the foundation of the
[2:00:37] world. You chose us, Lord, heavenly
[2:00:38] father. Before everything, Lord Jesus
[2:00:40] Christ, you chose us. You chose us. You
[2:00:42] predestinated us, Lord God. And your
[2:00:44] word, your choice does not falter, does
[2:00:47] not fail, Lord heavenly father. So we
[2:00:49] rely on you tonight, Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:51] We thank you for reinforcing us, talking
[2:00:53] to us, and reminding us, Lord Jesus
[2:00:56] Christ, why we should keep trusting in
[2:00:58] you, and why every word that you speak,
[2:01:00] Lord, heavenly father, is the only way
[2:01:02] for us to be saved, Lord God. Thank you,
[2:01:05] Lord Jesus Christ, for speaking to us.
[2:01:06] Because you are the best, Lord Jesus
[2:01:08] Christ, watchmen ever because your pro
[2:01:11] your prophet himself said that you are
[2:01:12] the best. You're the chief of watchman,
[2:01:14] Lord God. That mean there's no other way
[2:01:16] to there's no other way for us Lord
[2:01:18] Jesus Christ to even escape tribulation
[2:01:21] if it's not by your word Lord God if
[2:01:24] it's not by relying on you Lord Jesus
[2:01:26] Christ for that is what you spoke to us
[2:01:28] and that is what you told us Lord God
[2:01:29] may help us Lord Jesus Christ to stay
[2:01:31] faithful help us to stay under your word
[2:01:33] help us to stay grounded Lord Jesus
[2:01:35] Christ on your word help us to rely on
[2:01:37] you Lord Jesus Christ rely on your
[2:01:39] insight rely on your knowledge Lord
[2:01:40] Jesus Christ rely on that in supreme
[2:01:42] intelligence that the prophet himself
[2:01:44] relied upon on Lord heavenly father so
[2:01:46] you can make the words Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:48] of your scripture come um become flesh
[2:01:50] to us Lord God so you can make every
[2:01:52] word in the scripture that we may
[2:01:54] understand it in simplicity Lord God
[2:01:56] that way Lord heavenly father even our
[2:01:58] healing will happen um will happen
[2:02:00] easily Lord heavenly father as your
[2:02:03] prophet say Lord Jesus the reason why we
[2:02:04] don't have healing is because we don't
[2:02:06] have understanding Lord God and you're
[2:02:07] the person who bears all understanding
[2:02:09] Lord God so we pray that you may come in
[2:02:11] us Lord Jesus Christ that you may
[2:02:13] fellowship with us and reveal more unto
[2:02:15] us and give us more understanding. Uh
[2:02:17] bend their remaining of tonight unto
[2:02:19] you, Lord God. Protect your children,
[2:02:20] Lord Jesus Christ, as they will be
[2:02:22] returning, Lord Jesus Christ, to their
[2:02:24] respective place, Lord God. May you
[2:02:26] watch over them, Lord God. May you
[2:02:28] encourage them. May you touch them, Lord
[2:02:30] God. And may you just be with them, Lord
[2:02:31] Jesus Christ. You know their needs, Lord
[2:02:33] Jesus Christ. For yourself, Lord,
[2:02:35] heavenly father, you said you knew us
[2:02:37] before the foundation of the world.
[2:02:38] Before even sin entered, you had
[2:02:41] prepared the atonement. that may before
[2:02:43] our problems you had already had a
[2:02:46] solution. So we're simply praying Lord
[2:02:48] heavenly father that you may reveal to
[2:02:50] us that solution that you had for us
[2:02:53] Lord heavenly father we ask that you may
[2:02:55] give us patience Lord Jesus Christ give
[2:02:58] us patience to listen to you give us
[2:03:00] patience to wait on your time give us
[2:03:02] patience to wait on your season give us
[2:03:04] patient to wait on your purpose Lord
[2:03:05] heavenly father because now Lord
[2:03:07] heavenly father we understand Lord Jesus
[2:03:09] Christ that time season and purpose all
[2:03:11] of those the reason why all of those are
[2:03:13] absolute Lord heavenly father is because
[2:03:15] of your omniscience The reason why all
[2:03:17] of those Lord heavenly father are
[2:03:19] absolute and they do not change. They do
[2:03:21] not falter is because you're omnisient
[2:03:23] God. Lord heavenly father you took
[2:03:25] precaution. That's why you even say that
[2:03:26] Lord heavenly father you have an
[2:03:28] expected end for us Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:03:31] The reason why you have that expected
[2:03:32] end because you already know through
[2:03:33] fornowledge Lord Jesus Christ. You
[2:03:35] already know because you're omnisient
[2:03:36] Lord God. So we're abandoning everything
[2:03:38] unto you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:45] the prophet if the pastor may come.
[2:03:54] Praise God. Praise God. Wonderful
[2:03:58] message. I like it when they are
[2:04:01] overloaded with the message. Amen.
[2:04:05] Wonderful. The omni the omniscient of
[2:04:07] God. The omniscience of God. God knows
[2:04:12] everything.
[2:04:13] And because he knows everything, that's
[2:04:15] why he can foretell the f the future.
[2:04:18] That's why he's the same yesterday,
[2:04:20] today, and forever. Because God knows
[2:04:23] everything. Amen. Amen. Rely on God.
[2:04:28] He's the supreme intelligence.
[2:04:33] Maybe one day the Lord will help us get
[2:04:35] into the garment of a prisoner and you
[2:04:38] will understand why you need to rely on
[2:04:40] God. But God already spoke tonight. He
[2:04:44] knows everything. He knows your life
[2:04:46] before you were born, before you were
[2:04:47] formed. He knew the pope. He prophesy
[2:04:50] about the pope. And 71 years down the
[2:04:53] road, the prophecy came. The one who
[2:04:55] prophesied died.
[2:04:58] But because he was not William Marion
[2:05:00] Brham, because he was God, because he
[2:05:03] was the supreme
[2:05:05] intelligence who spoke,
[2:05:08] that word have traveled all the way and
[2:05:12] then brought the pope right there into
[2:05:14] place. Nobody thought he will come from
[2:05:17] America. Amen. God combine everything
[2:05:22] together.
[2:05:24] He's bringing the next Catholic
[2:05:25] president and then he bring a woman in
[2:05:28] purple. Then he bring Donald Trump
[2:05:30] twice. The first and the last Trump and
[2:05:33] then at the same time simultaneously
[2:05:35] he's bringing the pope. Why is this
[2:05:38] event happening quickly? Now all the
[2:05:40] prophecy that we linger through the ages
[2:05:43] waiting, waiting, waiting. Now in one
[2:05:45] time all the prophecy are coming. You
[2:05:46] need to watch carefully.
[2:05:49] You need to come away from the world.
[2:05:51] You need to cling into the word of God.
[2:05:54] That's why I say whenever you want to do
[2:05:56] something, always consult the prophet.
[2:06:00] Did I make myself? Whenever you want to
[2:06:02] do something in your life, stop and say,
[2:06:04] what did brother Brandham say about
[2:06:06] this? When we say brother Brandham, what
[2:06:08] did God
[2:06:10] say through the messenger about this? In
[2:06:13] other words, I want to know the mind of
[2:06:15] God. I want to know the thoughts of God.
[2:06:17] I want the omnicient, the supreme
[2:06:19] intelligence of God to know what is the
[2:06:22] purpose of God about this type of
[2:06:24] situation. And once we receive the
[2:06:26] answer from the prophet, then you apply
[2:06:28] the answer according to what the prophet
[2:06:30] said and you are doomed for success
[2:06:34] because you are following the mind of
[2:06:36] God. And brother Brandham say we have
[2:06:38] the mind of Christ. If you look at that
[2:06:40] picture, it's the head.
[2:06:43] And brother Brandham say we are in the
[2:06:45] age of the intelligence.
[2:06:47] Not the eyes anymore. The eyes was the
[2:06:49] seer. That was brother Brandham. Brother
[2:06:51] Brandham said the tongue was the
[2:06:52] Pentecostal and the eyes was himself.
[2:06:55] But if you notice now, it's a different
[2:06:57] story. And the greatest victory of
[2:07:00] Samson happened when his eyes was taken
[2:07:02] out.
[2:07:05] The greatest victory of this will happen
[2:07:09] when the prophet is taken out. When the
[2:07:11] prophet is off the scene, that's when
[2:07:13] the second hair, brother Glenn, the
[2:07:16] second hair, not the first hair, not the
[2:07:19] first hair, the second oil, the second,
[2:07:20] there is another anointing. There is
[2:07:23] another hair that is coming out. That
[2:07:26] hair will destroy hell. It will manifest
[2:07:30] the third pull because now we have the
[2:07:33] supreme intelligence. We have the mind
[2:07:35] of God. We are tapping into the
[2:07:37] omniscience of God. Amen. Amen. Put
[2:07:41] everything aside. Humble yourself before
[2:07:43] the word. The word, the prophet knows
[2:07:46] what it is. Sometime it's foolish to the
[2:07:48] world, but let's stick with the prophet.
[2:07:50] Let's stick with the mind of God. And
[2:07:53] the mind of God will take you through.
[2:07:56] Amen. Amen. Because your intelligence
[2:08:00] will get you in trouble. Brother
[2:08:01] Brandham spoke about a man who was
[2:08:03] thirsty and they got to a point they
[2:08:05] were looking for water and then the man
[2:08:07] have to trust the horse.
[2:08:10] And the and the and and the road the
[2:08:12] horse was taking the man was differently
[2:08:14] than the road everybody was taking.
[2:08:17] Amen. And he ended up he found water
[2:08:20] because there was something in the
[2:08:21] horse.
[2:08:23] Amen. That was bringing the the man
[2:08:26] toward the water. And brother Brandham
[2:08:28] was riding on a pl horse. Brother
[2:08:30] Brandham called that horse the word. Go
[2:08:33] watch in the anointing time or something
[2:08:35] like that. You will see or or a shame.
[2:08:37] You will see the vision. There is a
[2:08:39] horse. There is the word that is
[2:08:41] directing the word. That's why whatever
[2:08:43] we do, whatever you I'm I'm trying to
[2:08:45] do. You say, "Brother Steven, have a
[2:08:46] quote for everything." Yes. Why do I
[2:08:48] have a quote for everything? Because I
[2:08:51] want to make sure I'm doing things
[2:08:53] according to the supreme intelligence.
[2:08:56] Amen. How do I put something in the
[2:08:58] church? What did brother Brandham say?
[2:09:00] What did brother Brandham say? That
[2:09:01] brother Brham is the supreme
[2:09:03] intelligence of God. So when I tell you
[2:09:06] stick with the message, I'm just
[2:09:08] bringing you back to the supreme
[2:09:09] intelligence. Now because of his
[2:09:12] intelligence, we understand that there
[2:09:14] is a time, there is a purpose and there
[2:09:16] is a season. Why? Because of the
[2:09:19] omniscient God, a God that knows
[2:09:21] everything. Rely on him and he will give
[2:09:23] you the desire of your heart. Let's
[2:09:25] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:09:28] approaching you humbly tonight. Father,
[2:09:30] we thank you again for your grace, your
[2:09:32] love, your mercy, for speaking to us
[2:09:34] through your servant, Lord. Father, we
[2:09:36] pray that you strengthen him, Lord.
[2:09:38] Father, and take his life and continue
[2:09:40] to guide him and fill him and lead him,
[2:09:43] Lord, Father, from to higher height,
[2:09:45] Lord. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, if Tom
[2:09:48] Terry, we are committing this week unto
[2:09:50] thy hand. May you protect us and give us
[2:09:53] travel mercy as we go into our
[2:09:54] respective place. And Lord, help us with
[2:09:57] the young men meeting. And Lord, prepare
[2:09:59] our heart for the oncoming service on
[2:10:02] Sunday if that ter come. We thank you
[2:10:04] for everything and commit it all unto
[2:10:06] thy hand in the name of Jesus Christ.
