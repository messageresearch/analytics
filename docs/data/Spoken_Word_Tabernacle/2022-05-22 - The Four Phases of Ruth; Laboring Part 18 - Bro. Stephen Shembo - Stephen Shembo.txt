you might be seated for a few minutes just a few minutes still folks out looks like summer started amen how many are up to date with the sermon i will ask you this question over and over amen blessed be the name of the lord how many are reading their cod book and the church ages really you finish it not yet you're taking long or maybe you start striking that supreme anointing that's when it take really really really long amen how many enjoyed the house meeting yesterday [Music] [Applause] that was wonderful i'm sorry we could not address all the questions so we still keep them for the next

not have visitors we got family members and we got a special family this morning it's sister charlene's family with his parents brother and sister god richly bless you amen god bless you and welcome this morning amen next sunday this coming sunday lord's willing we will have brother abraham mara preaching for us so he's already preaching for bloody child lambs as soon as he finished by thursday lord's willing he will be already here and then on sunday he will be preaching for us so there are some folks that are coming from other churches so you will have some family members here next sunday amen so you pray for the service so it's going to be a great blessings for the church continue to remember brother bob's in prayer sister pam was taken to be with the lord so remember brother bob in prayer he really really really really need prayer for his own health and everything else amen so we pray and we will wait for brother joe green and see how they're going to coordinate everything and lord's willing will let you know about the funeral amen but if you hear something sooner shoot me a text or spoke uh speak to the deacon and we go from there amen blessed be the name of the lord how many heard about sister joker bad album only few people okay praise be to the name of the lord so our sister has a gift if you cannot see that gift you have a problem you're blind amen so she went with uh the lafontaine brother and they did the special recording for her and she put up an album and it's called crucify wave crust [Music] amen you should be proud this church is producing even singers [Applause] and i hope she's not the only one so i'm expecting more and more and more until the lord will begin to give you inspiration and write song and we put up more cds and more cd there's no way we can preach like this and you don't have an inspiration for song so somehow you must come up with songs amen blessed be the name of the lord and usually when people do this kind of stuff they sell them and they make money out of it but for some reason the sister put it up for free so she's not making any money of it so if you just want it when i look at the title crucified with christ i just went i didn't even speak to her much on it so i went and said let me see what the scriptures say about crucify with christ and let's see what the prophets say about crucified with christ this is what the scriptures say paul said i am crucified with christ that's the title nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which are now live in the flesh i lived by the faith of the son of god who did what and gave himself for the brazen altar right here brother branham say what is crucified with christ do you know that amen he said is to live for others that's what eternal life is about living for others brother madam say what kind of others those who hate you [Applause] those who would not like you those who will make fun of you live for them hallelujah be with them and do water praise god pray for those who despitefully use you say all manners of evil falsely for my name's sake they persecuted the prophet which was before and we want to be crucified with him amen so if you want to get the album we will put it up on the board over there it's free you can just go ahead and download it and get it for free so sister yoke bed congratulations come on up and take a token from your pastor i hope you're not going to be emotional god bless you sister congratulations that's a token from the pastor amen blessed be the name of the lord when you serve the king this is what follows it is not you it's the result hallelujah let's stand and go to our scripture this morning amen blessed be the name of the lord we stop on wednesday we have to change the title i miss you on wednesday [Laughter] but yeah they told me you caught it you you already caught on me amen not only brother greg i miss all of you i was like i hope i wish the whole church was there amen but i know if he missed they gotta be a legitimate reason amen let's go to ruth chapter two verse eight ah this cargo is heavy so i don't know how we're going to deliver it but let's see how the lord will lead roof chapter 2. i tried to move in ruth chapter 3 i came there is so much in this scripture you read it and then you read the next time something open up you say i got it and you read next time something again open up we touch the unlimited that's right amen verse let me read verse six so that will save you down the road and then we will go to verse eight the bible says and the servant that was set over the reapers you understand this now this language answer it and say it is the jewish damsel in other words when you look at roof there is nothing on the outside that looked like a jewel nothing yet he's already a jew amen see i told you you might be seated amen so when they present the roof it's easy to look and say that's not an israelite very easy very easy because when you go to the brazen altar you don't see changes on the outside you're still the same amen you say it is the moabitish demuzel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab she's still even identified with her country so there is no much change on the outside that you can tell that this woman belongs to the uh nation of israel when you look at her straight ahead you can tell she's not from here she's from another country amen but she was not anymore from that country because she already said my people your people will be my people your god will be my god so she was no more more about but when you look at her on the outside she still looks like a moaba hey buddy okay so far let's jump to verse eight then say boaz to roof hear you not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from here but abide fast by the maiden boaz didn't tell her to abide first by the reapers everybody okay he says abide with the maidens amen that's the commandment so her liberty was now restricted let me start it again she could go to any field and glean and get whatever she want everybody okay but once she met boaz boas restricted her liberty so before boaz you can stream anybody you can listen to anybody as long as the christian but once you meet boaz then you're you are restricted only to one specific field because the other field can give you food but they can never give you marriage they can never give you redemption only the field of boars can give you redemption in addition to what everybody else can do hey back here so once you hit boaz you meet him your liberty is kinda restricted you cannot go any more out the way you were going because he need to channel you into a different pipe anybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord lord i didn't even give you the scripture job to verse 15 and when she was raising up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves i'm repeating the same scripture wednesday because we could not even touch it and we approach her not and let fall also some of her some of the handful of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not we spoke on wednesday that we have two foods they were the food that roof labor or work for anybody care and another food she didn't really work for it was given purpose for on purpose anybody care from boaz through the reapers hey mark here in other words as you work boaz is working amen amen so when you come up you coming up with a double portion everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord verse 17 so she gleaned in the field until evening and beat out that she had gleaned so there is some work going on here and it was about a nephi of barley hopefully i'm gonna get it one if i for a day what does it mean amen blessed be the name of the lord let's drop to verse uh verse 18. and she took it up and went into the city and her mother-in-law saw what she gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was so fast two kinds of food again job to verse 21. remember boaz told her to abide by the maidens amen watch roof when she comes back at home and they ask her what happened verse 21 and roof the moabites say he boasts say to me also you shall keep fast by my young men is that what boaz told her this is roof talking what did the man tell you oh no he said you need to keep fast by the man by the young man but boaz told her you need to stay by the maiden amen watch something between the line amen you need to keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest and verse 22 now me say to wolf her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with his where did naomi know this who told naomi this you see this bible is different who taught naomi this amen she came back oh what happened she was so excited she said boy i said naomi recalibrated her corrected her like no what they told you is stay by the maidens do they have cell phone in these days do they have facebook they can text how what happened here amen what is the communication there let me help you go back to verse 11. just bear with me and boaz verse 10 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said to him why have i found grace in your sight in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me saying i am uh on the outside nothing and boaz answered and said to her he has fully been showed me in other words i have received a report who gave boaz the report what report let's see he have been fully showed me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband was ruth husband dead in israel or in moab was boaz in moab who told boaz what happened in moab did he have a facebook or a cnn somebody reported what happened in moab who brought the report to boast about something that happened that only naomi and roof knew the story so there is some kind of communication that is underwater going on under current communication that roof is not aware of but it's all working for her amen and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your nativity and now come to a people which you knew not before everybody care watch now the lord recompense your word your labor may the lord recompense your labor the labor of ruth and the full reward be given you of the lord god of israel under who's what what are the wings of god god have wings in other words whatever you did in the country of board and then what you did to naomi and the decision you took you put yourself under the wing of jehovah you thought you were just talking but spiritually speaking you were entering the wings of jehovah what is the wings of god let's go back to our verse verse 22. and naomi said to ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with his maiden that's what they told her how did you know that you were home here you were not there on the field when they told me but you know everything that they meet you not in any other field so naomi's telling her you are put under uh custody here you don't understand they're pretty good make sure you don't mess up here because somebody's watching you there is pies all over amen make sure you do what they told you to do because if they caught you somewhere you're in trouble amen verse 23 so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean to the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest and dwell with her mother in law everybody clear now let's go to matthew chapter three so we understand clear there is two foods ruth has to work until she complete the full harvest she have to work through the wheat hovers and barley harvest in other words the complete circle of harvest must be completed you cannot cut corners you must finish it all the way up amen matthew chapter 3 verse 5 the bible says this then went out to him to john the baptist jerusalem and all judea and all the region around about jordan and we're baptized the laver of him in jordan confessing their sin so you confess your sin at the brazen altar and you get into the liver you baptize amen but when he saw many pharisees and sadducees the religious one come to his baptism he said to them oh generation of vapors who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit need for water that's what i want you to get repentance doesn't stop just a repentance anybody care repentance is always followed by the fruits of repentance when you repent you are repenting to god america but the fruit this is not only to god even men will see that anybody care so john is telling them you coming here coming to the brazen altar you go into the river everything is okay but i want to see the result i want to see something more than just coming at the brazen altar confessing your sin what follow after amen what kind that life will follow your repentance what kind of fruit what life what works amen what are you doing after you are repented what is your behavior after repenting repenting is good everybody can come to the altar but what follows after so john say you must bring for fruit meat for repentance amen and think not to say within yourself a proud spirit we have abraham to our father you remember yesterday in question and answer jesus told them abraham is not your father your father is the devil amen we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of this storm to raise up children to her to abraham so don't stay there and say because i was born a jew automatically i have a right no the jew have works everybody here blessed be the name of the lord and now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree which brings not forth water is water and cast into the water so if you got repentance and you never produce fruit or there is not a life that is following your repentance or they are not works that are following your repentance or we cannot see a behavior meet for the repentance they will cut you off you are drinking and you are spending for free you are spilling off this resources of life you don't use it it's not benefiting you let's go to john chapter six then we pray probably i need to read couple more john chapter 6 verse 25 amen if you dare you can say amen drop for 26 so i can save you some time you already know this from what is there jesus answered them and say verily verily i say to you you seek me not because you saw miracle but because you did eat off the loaves and where what you're following me for not your food for food stamper it's free that's what you're following amen i'm putting that here so you get it quickly verse 27 labor not so somebody must labor labor not for the meat which perishes jesus says that man shall not live by what which is natural meat but by every which is spiritual meat anybody care so jesus is telling them do not labor for this don't do it for this don't label for this because this one the the bird of the air they don't work they don't clock in they don't clock out i take care of them they don't wake up with an alarm clock going to work so don't worry about this i know you need it seek ye first there go first here then i will take care of everything later that's why jesus is saying do not label for this don't take all your mind and put it into worldly stuff anybody care but seek that which is eternal i want you to labor right here how do you label amen labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth to water so the laboring here will lead you into everlasting life everybody here so before you reach everlasting life you must go through labor you must go through work you must go through serving amen but liberal follow faith everybody here so when you repent you must move to the next stage and labor when you labor it's going to move you to the next stage eternal life blessed be the name of the lord labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth to everlasting life which the son of man shall hold not any man can give you that only the son of man it's a personal relationship only the son of man can tell you come up and take it remember john in revelation 10 only the son of man does that amen for him has god the father seal then say that to him what shall we do that we might work the works plural of god yeah tell us we need to stop praying for the sick and they're here we need to start having campaigns go ahead how can we do the work of god how can i speak and then a squirrel come up slow down you are jumping steps before you want to see the squirrel coming up or you speak something happen you must go through a process verse 9 29 jesus answered and said to them this is their work singular if you catch this everything else that you're looking for is connected to this this is the work of god that you do what believe on him who has water believe he's speaking about faith but here so when you got your faith your faith has a package of works amen so as soon as that faith is unlocked it will follow automatically into works and those works will lead you into everlasting life that's why brother branham said justification make way to and sanctification makes way too you don't have to worry about it if you did the first step right everybody okay so far let me get these two here on the board then we can pray by god's grace the bible says in psalm chapter 103 verse 2 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefit which benefit who forgiveth all that iniquities and heals all the diseases so we can see here that the atonement or the propitiation for our sin have two a compound word amen it works for the forgiveness of your sins and your iniquities amen and he also heals you for the healing every disease anybody care isaiah 53 verse 5 speaking about christ the bible said he was wounded for our transgression the first part there amen he was bruised for hour our iniquity iniquities you know something better but you don't want to do it you need to be in church on time you come late it's inequity everybody he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of her peace was upon him and with his trap we are so you cannot have forgiveness of sin or iniquities or transgression anybody care without having healing they all go together but here that's why they call god el shaddai america because el shadda means the breasted one there is a breast for your forgiveness for your salvation amen and there is another breach for your healing depending on where you want to get it amen let's go ahead and pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father what a joy this morning to gather together with families and lord not gathering about natural food but gathering for the spiritual food because you spoke that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children this is as far as i can go according to the ability you have given us but lord father when it comes to opening the word and speaking to your children and bless them and bring people unto you it only take the supernatural action of the holy spirit may your anointing come and work among your children we humbly ask it we seal everything that is contrary to your word away from this place and let's that the holy spirit and the elect angel only continue to work in this building in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you on wednesday we were on roof the four phases of roof roof laboring that was part 17 we have to change the title so coming back we call that part 18 where we are dealing with the stable of the showbread amen brother branham say roof under sanctification means roof is laboring and she's laboring in the legalistic way and we only we already explained to you that legalistic is not good but what kind of legalistic is brother brown i'm talking about amen it's a roof resting waiting for boaz to return from the finish work if roof under sanctification is roof laboring what does it mean to us when we spoke about the tabernacle here we begin the teaching on the tabernacle and from there we stop and we went to the story of roof and we took the story and the phases of roof in her life and we blended together with the tabernacle that's where we got roof deciding in the other court roof serving in the holy place then roof resting in the holiest place amen then from there we blended the church age messenger and we blend the three steps of grace which is justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit we blend the messenger and the deviation either you going to looter you don't pay attention calvin will suck you in if you're going through wesley you don't pay attention you're going to find yourself in armenianism if you go through the message of the hour you don't play right you don't uh get yourself set up pretty good or robert will pull you up everybody here then we move on to the book of ezekiel and then we inserted the three phases of ezekiel according to the plan of redemption so all these things locked the plan of redemption the tabernacle speak about redemption of mankind the church ages speak about redemption of mankind the step of roof speak about a gentile woman a hidden that is coming up and becoming part of israel which is speaking about the redemption again and then bro uh ezekiel says that god spoke and said i'm gonna give you a new heart i'm gonna give you a new spirit and i'm gonna give you my spirit all of them are in three because god is perfected in three everybody clear so far so now when ruth was coming into israel roof was coming under the dispensation of the law because israel was still under the law and paul if you recall spoke and said that the law was a school master the law was your teacher and it was good because the law paul said that the law was a school master that lead us unto christ so if you enter the law correctly anybody here if you enter the law correctly that law will point you to christ everybody here if you enter the law of moses and you don't end up in christ you miss something because moses himself spoke he said the lord your god will send you a prophet like unto me so moses was pointing the people to christ the bible says this hallelujah that the law was given by moses but grace and not only grace grace plus truth anybody care why truth because the bible say you shall not die and the truth has set you so your freedom comes from the truth everybody here so when grace comes grace is a company with something that will free you everybody here grace and truth was not given grace and truth came but here the law was given to moses so moses was here and somebody came and gave moses the lord but when it was time for grace and truth amen amen grace and truth came in other words grace and truth is a person [Music] everybody here jesus said i am the way i am the water so the truth is a person the grace of god is a person hallelujah the bible says in john 1 14 and the word was made that's jesus christ and dwelt among us and we behead his glory the glory of jesus christ the glory has the only begotten of the water because he came out from god i come from god i'm going back to god and that son was full of water and full of water so you cannot separate jesus from grace [Applause] amen you cannot separate jesus from truth jesus is the grace of god made flesh [Music] jesus is the grace of god and the truth of god in human form ever here so grace is a person of christ [Music] everybody okay so far that's why brother branham said may i add to this woman her name is water because it's the bread of jesus christ we are graced because our husband is grace ever here may i place her in the bible also as called the elect lady dismiss whatever i'm going to talk about you know the bible declares said to the elect lady and if you notice elect come from the word elected lady she was chosen among other women that's how you do for your brother man one lady amongst all other water but she was elected why is she misgrace because her husband is grace grace is a person everybody cares so far so when this grace came israel missed it israel rejected the grace why did israel rejected the grace what caused the israel to misgrace because the law was a school master to point them to christ so automatically when jesus come everybody that was under the law should see him but why did they miss him let's go to the book of romans amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord romans chapter 9 if you dare you can say amen if i pass this then i'm soaring quickly amen roman chapter 9 verse 30. if you dare you can say amen few people pages are turning you can't sleep amen what shall we say then that the gentile or the hidden which follow not after righteousness have attained to the righteousness even the righteousness which is of water it seems like the people to whom the law came miss god and the one that did not even have the law of god caught god but they caught god by faith everybody okay verse 31 but israel who had the law which followed after the law of righteousness has not attained to the law of righteousness in other words israel entered with the law but they never reached christ why amen they have not attend to the law of righteousness verse 32 wherefore in other words why what is the reason why israel missed god amen because they sought it not by water am i reading a different subject anybody here so the reason why israel never met christ when christ came because they lack faith amen so when you enter the law you must enter the law with faith faith is revelation [Music] everybody if you enter this message you must make sure you have faith everybody cares so far he says because the the sorted not by faith but as it were by what they thought by doing something they automatically will have what they're looking for armenianism stumbling stone everybody cares so far go to hebrew chapter three as we're building because we need to understand the labor amen hebrew chapter 3 verse 12. if you dare you can say amen the bible say take heed brethren lest there be in any of you a what an evil heart of what unbelief is an evil heart unbelief means you don't have faith you are under the law but you don't have faith you are into something but you don't really believe what you are in [Music] everybody here you are born into something you grew up into something but you really don't believe what you born under now hallelujah he says that the an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the water so a proof of somebody that was into something and did not believe in that which he was the result one day that person would leave it everybody here so when somebody is departing from the message do not be surprised they were in the message but they never believed the message i won't play games verse 13 but i exhort you but exalt one another daily sorry what it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitful of sin for we are mad partakers of christ if we hold yes brother if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the water everybody here if you enter into the holiest can you come out again if you come out it means you never was there anybody here so if you start with christ you don't come out if you coming out it means you never got into the same place you thought you were in it you were in something else but you were not in christ anybody cared so far the bible says in verse 15 while it is said today jump to verse 16 so i can uh gain some time for some not everybody when they had heard did provoke however not all that came out of egypt by who so when moses police were here many people came out 2 million if you look you say wow this is a big church a lot of believers watch out because none of uh the majority of them never made it to the promised land but they were following a prophet they were eating the manner every day but they miss the promised land what makes them miss the promised land while they were under the anointing of god following god what happened anybody here verse 17 but with whom was god was he grieved 40 years so 40 years god is grieved jesus the people that he brought out amen was he grieved for years was he not with them that had seen whose carcass their bodies fell into the wilderness and to whom saw he that they should not enter into his water but remember roof resting but to them that believe what so somebody followed moses but he did not believe moses everybody here so verse 19 we see that they could not enter because of water everybody drop down to verse chapter four verse one let us therefore fear paul is showing you an example he said now be careful look what happened to israel you also be careful be careful of what let us therefore feel less the promise being left of us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it i don't want anybody to miss the step of roof resting but i have to show you what made the other miss that step because they never believed into what they got into amen verse two fought to us was the gospel preached as well as to water so they were going to church they were going to church on wednesday they heard moses preach they went to church on sunday they went to church on thursday moses was preaching to them some were even taking notes some were sleeping in church some as soon as they say moses is calling the congregation again everybody here some when they say moses is calling the people no i need to wash my clothing today so i cannot make it today nothing is new everybody here he continued he said but the word preach even though they heard it did not profit them why did the word did not profit them not being mixed with water in them that eat water so when you listening to the word of god that word of god must be mixed by faith if it's meets my faith automatically it will lead you to jesus christ [Music] what are you saying my brother this is what i'm saying jesus said do not think that i jesus i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even who in whom you do what so when moses is in heaven and you are there you say we follow moses moses said no no no no that was not me this is not what i told them to do [Applause] instead of moses talking for you moses is actually rebuking you in heaven everybody okay for he had he believed [Music] did he say have you believed the lord [Music] he said have you believed the law does it mean we are worshipping moses when they say moses they're talking about the law of moses so when they say believe moses that's why paul told king agrippa do you believe the prophet so when we say believing brother branham we're not talking about the man brother branham we're talking about the message that was brought through brother branham [Applause] because brother branham was a man brother branham was a prophet moses was a man and moses was a prophet but you must believe moses you cannot separate the man from his message the message and the messenger are one and the same [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay you must believe jesus say if you believe on whom i sent so if god sent somebody you must believe that person that person is not god you believe in god send him and you get the instruction that god gave to that person and you continue your journey [Applause] [Music] so we're not worshiping brother branham but we believe the message of brother branham because the message is lined up with the bible so it's no more a man but it's god who spoke to this generation i'm sorry i gave you vaccine i'm putting boosters [Laughter] for ye have been for had you believe who you would have believed water so you cannot say you believe jesus christ if you didn't believe moses because moses was the law and the law was pointing you to who so if you miss jesus it means you never even believe moses [Applause] amen he would have believed me for he did what [Music] moses did water everybody here in other words moses gave you the written word anybody here that's why israel was going in the sabbath and the bible said in the book of acts that moses was preached you remember i gave you the scripture every sabbath so on the sabbath they open the bible and they read like this they say moses say moses say moses said moses and israel say amen not amen to moses amen to the written word of moses everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so the proof that you believe the written word is when you can reveal is when you can receive the manifested word [Applause] [Music] i'm reading the bible let me read it again but if you believe not his what the writing of who if you don't believe if you don't believe the written word if you don't believe the bible everybody okay how shall he believe my because jesus was the word made flesh everybody here so when you are rejecting the word made flesh yes but here you are automatically rejecting the bible you cannot be a bible believer and rejecting the word made flesh the proof that you really believe the bible is when you when you accept the manifested word of god that means you already believe the scripture because the bible will point you to the word man's flesh [Applause] everybody here everybody here because when he came he did what moses spoke of him ever here so you cannot reject jesus christ and you say no i believe the word i believe jehovah you don't even believe jehovah you don't believe jehovah if you believe jehovah if you really believe jehovah when you see jesus christ you will recognize jesus christ that oh the jehovah of the old testament that's him right here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so the law was good the law was a problem when it's followed without faith then it becomes a burden if the message is a burden for you [Music] but here it means you have not gotten the revelation yet that's why you feel like a prisoner or they say don't do this they say they don't do this they don't touch you they don't wear this they don't wear this it's not really that the day you're going to receive the revelation that all that god is telling you is the law and the prophet all of them are in one commandment you shall love the god the lord your god then everything is no more a law anymore then it leads you to christ lord paul say is holy and the commandments are holy and just and what it is the behavior of israel that made the lord look like he was bad for we know that the law is spiritual but i am colonel showed under sin david says this the law of the lord is perfect converting what how can someone love the law and another one doesn't love the law for someone the law is something perfect for somebody else the law is a prison the testimonies the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the lord are right doing what so when they were reading the law the heart of david was rejoicing when they were reading the law somebody else was again yeah do and don't yeah when i'm going there they're going to tell me what something bad i did but when they tell david david say praise the lord thank you jesus everybody here he said the commandment of the lord is water enlightening the water it's opening your eyes to the things you never knew before but here the fear of the lord is clean enduring forever the judgment of the lord are true and righteous all water this law that is good this law that is pure this law that is holy was only one law for everybody exodus chapter 12 the bible say when a stranger shall join with thee not an israelite and will keep the passover to the lord let all his smell be water and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is water so when you get circumcised everybody okay everybody okay automatically you receive the passport the citizenship of israel ever here when you are circumcised there is no difference anymore between you and a jew even if you're outside look different than a jew hallelujah and it shall be as one that is born in the land for not on circumcised persons shall water so even if you are a jew and you are born in israel if you are not circumcised even though you are a jew you cannot approach god [Applause] so approaching god is not based on where you are born approaching god is based on the circumcision and paul spoke about the circumcision of the heart [Music] let me continue two laws one law shall be to him that is and unto the water that's a journey among so whether you are born in israel oh you are not born in israel there is only one law whether you are born in a message oh you are not born in a message you only have one line [Music] hallelujah leviticus 24 22 you shall have one manner of law as well further as for one of your own so when roof was moving to israel she cannot use a different law one law everybody okay the bible continues one ordinance shall be buffed for your congregate for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that's a journey with you an ordinance forever in your generation as year so shall they stranger be before no distinction so through the law already god was showing israel that he was the god of everybody [Music] israel missed it everybody care one love and one man shall be for you and for the stranger that's a joy with you not different lord that's why we say that whether you are born in the message oh you are not born in a message there is only one door and usually the problem is with the one born in a message the problem is usually with the jew because paul say the gentiles who were not looking for jesus christ found him but the jew that were born in the law they're the one that rejected him ever here paul was born in the law taught in the law and he found himself crucifying the word made flesh and paul said that he was the chief sinner hallelujah brother branham said the legalist got a hold of this idea hallelujah i shall wear my dress down this way and my dress down this way i shall let my hair grow long i shall be all right that's a lie and they point back to the woman with short hair and with short dresses and say she's going to hell because she was born in the message because she was born in israel she can say that's a more british woman everybody here i can't say that but i think those things are water so dressing with your dress down it's good keeping your hair long it's good i'm not condemning them but when you rest your eternal hopes and salvation upon that doctrine you are damned with it dressing with long dresses keeping your hair is the result that will follow later you don't start with the result and you're missing faith [Music] then your labor you are the one doing the label it is not god doing the label that's why it's hard for you that's why the message is hard because you're doing work everybody here the man or woman it doesn't matter whether you are this that or the other you come to that fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuels and let the purgative of the blood of jesus christ do what in other words start first with repentance everybody okay what about him say men and women can go to church and have long faith and pious as they can be and never lie the jews never steal the jews and try to live to there like paul as best as they can but unless they are water because we found israel following moses but they were not believing moses but they were living according to the custom of the jew so those customs they were doing that by work not by revelation i hope you can clearly see where you are everybody here but unless they are a believer they are so there is no scratch of legalists in the bible not a scratch of it anybody here that's why the door is always at the cross that's why you hear at the cross at the cross where i face and the burden of my heart he was there by faith i received my son and now i am happy [Music] [Applause] here now you're going on your journey all the way everybody cares so far so i'm good in time i'm just sorry amen so the decision that roof took for leaving her country everybody here i wrote it somewhere here leaving her country boaz when he met roof boa said that what you did when you were over there you put yourself under the wing of who because roof say your people will be in other words i'm no more more about i am a jew your nation will be i'm no more moabite i'm an israelite and your god everybody here will also be in other words wolf completely turned away her first nation and move into the next nation and that decision board says you put yourself under the water what does it mean the wings of god brother uh uh david says this in psalm 61 i will abide in that word everybody okay forever i would trust in the coverage of water so the tub and alcohol is water everybody here so the tabernacle of god is the wings of god so boys were telling ruth that the decision you took over there you were already entering the tabernacle [Music] that's why roof deciding was already roofed the president have brother branham gave you that scripture the message is always everybody here so when the roof was saying hey your people will be my people your god will be my god she already entered the tabernacle and she went into the brazen altar she took decision she stripped herself off from her first nation now she's moving to the and when she meet boaz boaz acknowledge first to her faith that i know everybody here now watch since she put herself in the tabernacle when she was coming back to israel with naomi now me begin to teach her the law anybody here naomi begin to teach her the law because the law is important amen it will it's a school master that will lead you to who which is our powers anybody here but the only way the law will bring you to boaz you must mix that lord with faith everybody okay so far so when roof begin to heal the word of god like israel was listening to the gospel into the wilderness roof heard the word with faith when naomi said when you get there we got food stamp in israel when you get in israel and you don't have food at home which i don't know if i'm gonna find something at home god gave us a law you can go to any field you will go ahead and reap and you can do everything nobody's going to bother you he'll be okay who read all of her she heard it she was coming and in roof chapter 2 ruth woke up in the morning it was not naomi that thought groove go to there amen roof order medically knowing the law everybody here moving by work everybody okay because her love was mixed by faith and automatically in that same day she met boaz because the law when it's mixed by faith will automatically point you to who everybody okay so far automatically that law will strike will will it'll take you straight ahead and put you there david says this in psalm 91 he said he that dwelleth in the secret water of the water what is the secret place of the monster everybody okay he was in the tabernacle everybody here shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my and my that's why boaz was protecting her my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver me from the snare of them and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with water so he has wings everybody okay which is the tabernacle and under his water shutdown he is truth shall be there and everybody okay so as roof is moving by the law automatically she's entering the second stage which is roof serving and brother branham said roof serving means roof under sanctification which means roof is laboring on the legalistic way what kind the legalistic way everybody cares so far blessed be the name of the lord let's go to 1st thessalonians chapter 4 i'm good on time somebody get filled quickly because they drink a lot of juice before the meal come and now they have to take it to go box you tell the kids don't drink juice eat your food everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord amen you know what if you don't mind we're talking about roof under sanctification why sanctification wire go first to exodus so we get this then it's going to load a solid foundation then we can come out of it go to exodus 28 first if you don't mind exodus 28 36 why sanctification if you're there you can say amen exodus 28 30 36 everybody here and you shall make a plate of pure gold and grave upon it like the engraving of a signet what do you place upon it you know what it means holiness to the sanctification to the god told israel told moses i want you to make a mature or a hat for the high priest anybody here when you're making that take a plate of pure gold right on that plate holiness unto the lord in other words sanctification unto the lord amen and take that and put it verse 37 and you shall put it on the blue lace i'm going to stay away from these that it may be upon the middle or the turban upon the forefront of the meter it shall be so you put it on the forehead on the forefront here so when the high priest goes all you see is holiness to the lord holiness to the lord when you're talking to the high priest why amen verse 20 38 and it shall be upon aaron's what brother branham said the forehead means the revelation and what i'm saying in another place the forehead means the knowledge anybody care it shall be upon aaron's forehead that aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israel shall hallow in all in all their holy gift and it shall be always upon his water that they may be accepted before who so if the offering of israel have to be accepted aaron every day he's approaching with the offering he must put something right here that reminds him that holiness unto the lord so when aaron we know that the priests were entering in the tabernacle only on the first and the second anybody here nobody could enter the holiest on me the high priest god said take a hat put it on the high priest make sure there is a plate that goes on his forehead where his memory is where his mind is where his knowledge is amen and put upon that holiness unto the lord because he's the only one that can cross into the holiest ever here and before you enter in the holiest i want you to remember aaron you do not enter here without holiness you cannot enter here without sanctification you don't come in here any kind of way amen when you are approaching me i need to see in your mind that you talked about repenting you thought about cleaning up your life you thought about stripping everything that is bad before me and you meet face to face you okay now now let's go to first thessalonians i just want you to get that let's go to first thessalonians chapter 4 now hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord don't worry i'm already up i will let you take off your seat belt soon first thessalonians chapter four if you there you can say amen first one you there i thought i have it and then i flip on the wrong one amen furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exalt you by the lord jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to do what and to do what this work is a work to please god anybody here and without faith can you please god anybody okay so far it is a walk a walk that you might please god amen and with that faith you cannot please god so automatically we can see which work it is it's a work of faith to water so this work cannot happen without faith you have faith first then you start walking because faith works is faith what praise god he says so you would have burned more and water so the more you walking pleasing the lord what happened to your life you begin to more and water what kind of work is this verse 2 for you know what commandment we gave you by the lord jesus for this is the will of god what is the will of god are you reading amen this is the will of god camera even your water i want you to be sanctified god wants you to be sanctified holiness unto me because the caribbeans that are there they always sing holy holy holy unto the lord so you don't enter like that ever here this is the will of god even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessels or his body in sanctification and water everybody okay verse five not in the lust of concupiscence or passion even as there which no not what you were gentle before do not walk anymore like the denture you need to work now a different work a work that is pleasing unto the lord and a clean walk anybody here that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner that's what you were doing before you came to christ because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testify for god has not called us unto but to water at the present altar god doesn't care much on the outside anybody care because you give your life at the altar right here you get baptized into the level god is calm with you when you enter your second stage and your purpose is to go into the holiest to receive the baptism of the holy spirit god raises his flag he said remember before me and you meet you got to clean up certain things in your life but here because i'm a holy god me and you cannot unite like that you need to clean up so me and you can connect everybody okay so far what am i saying hallelujah the bible says in first peter as obedient children you remember that word remember that word because according to ephesians 2 paul say we were among the children of disobedience everybody care now because you receive jesus christ you become an obedient child because god wants you to obey his commandment everybody here as obedient children not fashioning yourself according to the water this is what you were before this is your former life before you enter back here so paul is saying peter is saying you are moving right here you must have obedience roof i'm restricting you now don't go anywhere you must obey the commandment you must do some work here and i want to transform you before marriage you just came from moab you look like a moabat i cannot marry you like this daughter get with the maiden do some work but don't move from here stay in the good camp stay there i don't want to meet you anywhere stay tight here do work and later on when i see what you do i will handle the remaining for you everybody here so far hallelujah he said according to the former last in your water you did many things you didn't know better you did it in ignorance now that you know the truth that the way you were treating your wife was bad the way you were what uh treating your husband was bad the way you treated your children was bad now that you know that you need to change your work i want to see fruit meet for repentance show me prove me abraham that you love me [Music] everybody okay but as he which call you is so be what in all manners of what god cannot ask you to do something without him making a way for you to do it [Music] everybody here when god asks you to do something in you there is already a power to do it the problem is the self-will it is you surrendering your will to his will then your work take over come on let's go he said but as he which call you he is so be he what he is holy he must connect with somebody who is holy that's why you need to clean up everybody here in all manners of conversation because it's rising be ye for i am what how can we be holy amen follow peace with all men and water with that no one should water you cannot see the god here in the holiest if you are not holy even the high priest have to remind himself that i must clean up before i see him because no one can see me without holy ever here what is holiness and how do you get it let's get it now amen in mark chapter 12 we remember if you remember this they asked jesus what is the greatest commandment jesus said love your god with all your heart all your strength you know that and love your neighbor as yourself and that person replied this is what he replied he said to love him with all the heart without the understanding we fought the soul we fought the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than the whole burnt offering and what which was done under the law anybody okay if you notice this man pointed the law he says if you love god more than anything and you love your brother automatically it is more important than the gift that you give him because you can give a gift by routine by just religion this is what we normally do we give offering we give that we go to church we sing we dance we come out we live any kind of life do you really love the one you're serving that's a different story you can bring a lamb but you mad at your wife and you sacrifice the lamb and you go the same person you don't change you go back again abusing again at home anybody here look at jesus saying and when jesus saw that he answered this quickly he said unto him there are nothing from water you are pretty close here you almost about to enter you ride at the door right here if you answer like that you understand you have a revelation of the law now what does it mean sacrifice an offering in the book of samuel god todd so go to the america kill everything saul went and he did his own thing and he came back and the prophet came and said so did you do what god told you to do he said yes i did it amen oh my brother they were so good we slayed those amalekites we killed them the meeting was so good young people went to the altar he was so yummy everything was good the food was good the fellowship was good and samuel just waited when he finished he said i'm hearing some buzzing on the internet tonight [Music] no i was i was listening to the tape really were you listening to the table why did you do this oh no the people told me we can get the sacrifice to sacrifice to the lord [Music] god say kill them all do you think god didn't see that those those calves were beautiful and healthy and samuel rose up and say listen to me carefully has the lord a great delight in water and what is more than the whole and what you okay that's what that man caught anybody here has the lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifice as in water [Music] children of obedience anybody care obedience everybody here roof stay here i'm not restricting you there will come a time you're going to shop around all these are you i want to see something i want to test and see if i tell you to walk this way if you're going to do it or not everybody here he said as obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than what and to hearken to listen then the father no water all god is answering you instead of focusing on how much a calf cost how many calf do i need where can i find the healthy one i'm tired of buying this calf i just want you to do one thing if you can obey and if you can hearken or if you can listen that's all i require on you so it was not really killing the animal i just wanted to see if when i tell you something you're gonna do it exactly the way i did it i had a plan i know what amalek is i already written in my law that i'm gonna wipe amalek that is my perfect will i just took you to obey and execute my will but you thought your intelligence is more higher than my will do you know who killed saul he was an amalekite what about if saul would have killed all the amalekites if you need a scripture you see me the one who killed saul was in america he saved the amalek and what he spared kill him later so god was looking at the life of saul he saw an amalekite in the future he said so i'm going to spare you tell you your life come here kill the americans saul never understood that god was protecting his future life but he thought he was the law he missed the love of god and that which he spared kill him if he would have wiped amalek no one would have killed saul here for rebellion is as the sin of water when you rebelling against god's word against the message of the hour you wonder a witchcraft spirit that's why you need to be careful who you hanging around with [Applause] let me help you up again everybody here and stableness in other words paul so you got two things that are discerned out of your life you got a rebellion spirit and you got a stubborn spirit rebellion is exactly like do you see the holdu doctor over there because they give you commandment and you didn't do it it's a rebellion spirit one number two stubbornness is as water and water why is stubbornness like iniquity iniquity is when you know something and you don't want to do it anybody care so a stubborn person is a person that was already been told what to do but they are refusing to do what they know should be done that's why stubbornness is like iniquity everybody okay so when a child is stubborn it's pretty bad and stubborn is also like a dollar tree what is idolatry brother branham say when you take something and you elevate that thing above god that becomes your adult everybody here so when somebody's stubborn it means that that person has something in their mind that they give more preeminence to it over the word of god that's why stubbornness is like iniquity and like idolatry but what god is require is obey and hearken and listen that's all i'm looking for hallelujah how do you hearken where are you going brother stephen this is it paul say john say for this is the love of god that we do whatever is he difficult you love the lord yes you cannot say i love the lord then you're quiet if you love a woman you're going to stay quiet everybody here amazon will be rich because she will begin to receive delivery at home all of that because you love her when you go to the restaurant you want to pay her meal you bring in flour so love doesn't stop right there it's accompanied by a life by a behavior by it by some doings by some works if you really love you got fruits [Applause] you got the life we see some works we see some doing we see some behavior that that woman really understand that this man without me he's gone hallelujah and his commandments are not water because of love we need food at home oh mom i'm tired i work last time and then we have homework i have to finish homework there are some they are supposed to be submitted uh uh by two o'clock so i gotta be working no problem mama flip the subject your fiance is coming home you know what happened right who's gonna tell you to cook who will tell you to cook you will be forgetting about your submission work and everything now you rose up and you start doing something quickly you making sure the bathroom of the visitor is clean so he can see that your home is clean [Music] ever here you make sure the living room are there if your little brother is jumping on the chair you ready to slap him because you want everything to be clean because he's coming his commandments are not grievous [Music] because you love him everybody okay the grief is when there is no love hallelujah if you love me you do whatever he that has my commandment and keeping them everybody okay he that person he that is obeying the one that is hearkening the the one that is following the roof that is staying under my commandment and doing what i told the roof to do here it is that love me and he that love me shall be love of who roof never knew boaz naomi no because when they asked her who did you work with she said there was somebody his name is boaz then naomi say oh that's a kingsman but ruth did not know anybody here now boaz come and say don't go anywhere stay there why why do you want me to stay here why did she obey how can you obey somebody that you meet the first day how do you obey somebody that you meet the first day and he said you know what don't move anymore stay there and you're obeying that person the first intention is why you don't want me to move what is wrong what do you want right what do you want in other words you wanting something he said and he that love of me shall be love of mine when i'm giving you commandment when i'm telling you to obey something and you are right here when i'm giving you commandment i'm telling you to obey something there is somebody here if you begin to obey what i'm telling you this person begin to like you everybody okay in other words your obedience is increasing his love everybody okay he said he that loves me shall be love of mine and i will do what and will do what when you keeping the commandment of god you are forcing god now to move into your life and to reveal himself to you how do you enter into the holiest by water jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will do what and my father will do what and we will come to him you don't have to worry i will be coming when i see that you are following what i'm telling you you it's not you doing the work i will be coming i will come and make more what i am coming myself to dwell in you when i give you a commandment and i tell you to do something and the more you obey the more you are forcing me now to come to you and to fill you with the spirit that's all i was looking for everybody okay for this is love that we do whatever anybody okay that you do what after his water this is the commandment as you have heard from the beginning you should walk in water roof walking roof obeying roof laboring what does it mean my god oh my god brother branham says this only believe for all things are possible to them that believe faith and words are water i'm good in time so relax everybody okay faith and love are water husband and wife and they do water that's why when this faith started good automatically the wife is following everybody here he says the husband work with the wife and the wife with the husband they identify what is going on brother stephen this is what i'm gonna go now handle tight and let me shoot you ready devil this is not the time to play around all right there is only two ways to do anything roof laboring how are we laboring and that is the right way and the wrong way and that is our way the wrong one and god's way our way always forever guaranteed the wrong way god's way always guaranteed right no matter how foolish are you okay are you okay i'm just moving the airplane are you okay foolish it seems to us how simple it is god behind it there is nothing that can do whatever speaks it in his laws and his ways operate how what are you trying to say brother stephen my god this is what i'm trying to say come on oh my this is the devil it's going to come up there we go the battery is working that's it okay now he's trying to run away not that one and then he say go and sit no more or worse things come upon you so therefore in order to obtain your healing you shall have to become a christian after you are here and i believe i would say this talking about the dual atonement when you are healed your sins are water what is happening anybody here when you meet christ at the cross we were taught by tradition that it's easy to give your life to god anybody care and it's hard to get heal everybody here give your heart to god lord jesus i give your heart and you go easy when they say believe on your healing then you have a hard time maybe i need to fast maybe i need to do this maybe i need to do this that's what we were taught but the atonement of cross have both of them everybody okay we have both of them connected anybody here so when you are approaching god in salvation you cannot have salvation without healing [Applause] hallelujah even if you don't need healing at that time healing is coming once you pull the other the other one come [Music] hallelujah when you are healed you are forgiven your sins are forgiven i didn't hear very emotes on that but it's the truth confess your fault one to another and pray you one for another that you may be water so confession and healing are put together go ye and sin no more always things come upon you jesus said which is easier to do say that since be what oh take up the bed and water do you remember that story it's all the water in other words when jesus began to discern the man came down from bed and he was sick instead of jesus healing him jesus look and say that sin be forgiven the pharisees look they say amen forgiving sin jesus looked at them he said i know he came for healing but i don't know what is hard for you you think which one is hard if i say healing or forgiveness of sin which one do you think is hard in other words both of them come as a package so when i say i forgive you if that man really understand he's going to walk and take up his bed and go [Applause] everybody okay why is this important in roof laboring why is it important in our sanctification why should i know what to do in our sanctification this package here of healing and salvation ever here lies in the greek word called sozo no man can save you only god can do that and he has already done it when jesus died he finished the works on your salvation for birth for your body and your water the very same word is used every time did you notice our text do not he say that faith has what faith save you and faith also heal you and the greek word there is so so sozo is used for both salvation and divine healing you are either saved or saved are we okay i go back to my greek to look it up and that word in the greek is so so the word save or salvation is sozo same one for healing means that they were physically safe or spiritually both words apply because it's the same the man on the same day he was wounded for hour with his trap we were both of them are connected [Applause] what are you saying brother stephen this greek song scholar here will tell you that the word there in the greek is sozo which means just exactly like save physically or save water that faith saved thee from hell the faith sent thee from death their faith safety from water it is also the same word listen to me carefully you ready so the same faith everybody okay that you have in god for your salvation is the same faith you use for your water just water [Music] how do you get sanctified you ready you ready let's start with healing when you somebody comes and they pray for you in jesus name amen do you feel better no you don't feel better except it's a miracle if it's a miracle right away you heal if it's not a gift of miracle when you come up it looks like everything is the same anybody here anybody here the headache is there the pain is there every symptom on the outside is still accurate but the demon is gone anybody here the way to remove the symptom is for you to begin to behave [Applause] [Music] everybody okay and act like you are already here [Applause] [Music] let me help you jesus came and was looking for food and he looked at the tree nothing what did he do to the tree he cursed the tree did the tree change [Music] nothing they went in the morning when we don't know what time whether it was 3 a.m or 4 a.m or whichever time we don't know in the morning something happened when peter jesus was going if you notice jesus didn't even pay attention jesus never came back and said let me look at the tree if he worked jesus was just going but purposely he passed that avenue to teach the disciple a lesson because if he never passed that avenue they would never have known him he said i know my voice if they don't see they don't understand let me pass that up any master which avenue do we go back we're going to use 85 again or the 75 we use yes enter an 85 use exit 13 again 14 again and go on 85 85 okay let's go they start going then jesus is going there looking straight and suddenly peter always speed ever jesus pushed the break he said what's going on what's going on peter why did you make me stop the guy i said no master look at the tree it took a while for the tree to die amen he said the tree that you cursed yesterday and it looks like nothing happened look at the tree now today it's manifested that the tree is dead jesus pushed the brick and turned the car off he said that's what i was looking for come asad guys amen amen when they came outside he said look at that mountain day he said do you see that mountain over there they say wow that's a big mountain he said if you speak to that big man [Music] everybody okay you say mountain move the human brain shut down they said that mountain he said yes if you say to the mountain move and put yourself in the sea if you don't doubt and if you believe that what you say happen that mountain will move and get into the sea and jesus turn around here so when they pray for you nothing happened it's still hurt it's still stolen it's still big you can't feel any more good amen abraham you're going to receive a child where's the baby abraham said no problem i know this god when he say something if he already came out of his mouth [Music] [Applause] [Music] ever here that's all i need he said sarah let's go to walmart [Applause] ever here sarah move on he said yes honey let's go wait for me i need my walker he said take your walker he said what do you want to purchase the groceries abraham say no go to the baby station [Music] sarah said what do you need in the baby station he said i need a diaper we need the crowd for the baby we need the pampers for who for my baby sir do you remember what he says when he say it's finished i don't have to wait i need to even get quickly in action [Applause] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far and matter of fact your name is no more sarah it's saray meaning that you have many children and when you call me call me father abraham the father of many children where are those children everybody okay everybody okay anybody okay so far the same way you acted for your healing that's the way you get sanctified [Applause] because the same key open both doors everybody here ever here so when you already accepted jesus christ as your savior and you give your life to jesus christ you have to begin to behave like somebody that is already sanctified [Applause] everybody here [Music] yes sir i have a few minutes one minute everybody here listen to brother right now he said the same faith that you have in god for your salvation is the same faith you use for your water just simple do what and do what doesn't take any sensation it doesn't take anything in the world but it's just a common water you don't have to feel the only thing you do is to do what believe that jesus died that you might be it is faith is what [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah what are you trying to say brother stephen this is what i'm trying to say when you are prayed for you are confessing against your symptoms [Music] [Applause] but you are saying i am here [Applause] but truly hurt don't worry about the hurt so when you are getting sanctified you are removing something in your life by commandment even though you still like [Applause] [Music] it you follow me god say remove cigarettes over here the desire of sea diet is there but you take cigarettes by obedience and you throw it away and you begin to confess that from today i'm no more a smoker but the desire is there so so we'll enter in [Applause] oh my god brother branham saying remember you can't play with satan he knows whether you believe it or not don't try to make it out you really believe it that you would get down to business with god he come to business with you oh how if you could just get that friend look then by faith now look he is the high priest of your what you are here just by the same merit that you are what you are saved by the same merit of who not trust on your merit there is nothing you can do to be saved only do water i could not go to heaven in my righteousness neither can you go in your righteousness god will not receive it but he will receive his own righteousness of his son and if we believe on him as the scriptures say believe that he is and will confess him he will what lord help me i'm trying to get the airport well you say that give me plenty of room then brother branham i can do what i want i always do always but when a man can really see what jesus done for him and turn around and do something contrary he shows he never received if a sinner comes when out today and say well i got saved what shows that you save you still wearing the same pants you're still having the same hair you're still doing the same thing but you already say that you saved it came out from your mouth everybody here but you are not cleaning it how do you get clean everybody here you look like you always did you are the same person well if you say well maybe i didn't get it maybe it was just a thought i did you shall go right back to your scene again like a hog to each wallow or in the dog to eat water in other words the same way you take your healing and you have to stand on your faith and say i believe that you heal me even though it hurt that's the same way you get sanctified when you rose you say this deadly life is over today everybody here even though the symptoms are there even though the desires are there you begin to confess that you don't do those stuff no more amen because it's the same law my god help me lord amen come on come on come on buddy brother branham say how do you get saved let me take it in a childlike form where every believer no matter what church you belong to your pastor if he's a right man he will tell you that you can only be saved through faith not true works through faith now you believe that he saved you first things that come from the heart you believe it then you walk up and do it and say i accept jesus as my personal savior i believe he did what at that time there is not a physical things in the world that you could prove that you are saved [Music] just like your healing i'm safe i'm healed what shows you healing nothing but something already happened in the spiritual realm everybody here ever here your eyes are the same color got the same shirt on your head go outside and the old gang say they are nothing to your friend when they see you they say if he is safe is not safe because nothing changed yet amen but you believe there is something to it don't you what if you say well i'm going to see how we worked out it shall never work out until you keep your [Music] everybody okay everybody okay you believe you are then you do it then you do what then you do it and he does what everybody okay so when you believe you are delivered begin to act like a deliverman [Music] [Applause] look at somebody that has already been delivered look how they behave and begin to behave the same way even though you still struggling don't worry about the struggling you keep your confession lord you deliver me from beer no beer should enter my house even if the desire is there don't approach bill anymore after a while he's gonna kick out [Music] let me head to the airport jesus went to the tomb of lazarus ever here ever here he got there everybody crying he also looked he began to cry everybody and after a while he shook his head they said what's going on he looked and he looked lazarus he see that before lazarus there is an obstacle there was a storm do you think jesus didn't have the power to move that stone did he have power did he have power in his own tomb who removed the stone he removed himself but in your tomb he doesn't do it [Music] he wants you to do some work [Applause] [Music] ever here jesus said you removed the stone and they said no no no no no no he stinks the situation is very bad it's already finished there is no way that can work do the work obey my commandment obey my law you move the stone and move ever here when they pick the stone and they move did anything change it's no more your problem [Applause] you do your part you move the stone [Applause] [Music] act like you are saved confess like you are saved believe that you are saved walk like you are safe associate to the people that are saved and god will kick in and he will remove whatever obstacle is there [Applause] everybody here even as bad as your child is don't say my child is bad look at your child you say i have best children they are obedient children they are lovely children they are the best that i can get no matter what is happening even if at night they're coming from the nightclub you look at him you say look at the redeem of the lord look how beautiful they are look how they are saying look how they are before you know it it will be over [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody here you remember the story of john ryan you remember john ryan brother branham told him what go ahead and confess praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for saving my children praise the lord from delivering my children even if he smoke even if my husband is still drinking that's not my problem i'm gonna label i'm gonna move my stone i'm gonna remove my stone and god will move [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah let me finish with this go to second king go to second king and i finish here and i'll drop you in the airport [Music] how do you get sanctified it's also the same faith you use for the healing it's the same way the same way that you use for your deliverance hallelujah let's go to second king chapter seven and then i stop here blessed be the name of the lord second king chapter seven verse two somebody got it but have not caught it yet you there you there you there let's go to verse three and there were how many water four healthy people you know the law of leprosy in israel they can't even enter the city they gotta stay outside unclean when you see them unclean anybody care fall lepers at the entering your decade and they say one another god told israel i'm going to bring you deliverance the situation is bad farming everywhere no food until parents begin to cook their children [Music] it's written in the bible god came right in the middle of the situation he says i'm gonna send food the situation is very bad let's go to verse one so you understand then elijah said hear you the word of the lord that says the lord tomorrow there is no food people are eating their own children you say tomorrow no you need to say tomorrow the rain will come then we will plant then we wait six months then the plant grows then food comes that makes sense he says tomorrow at this time finished product he said two more about this time shall a measure of flower be sold for shekel and two measure of barley for a shekel in the gate of water the situation was bad and then a lord on whose head on whose hand the king lin answered the man of god and say behold if the lord will make windows in heaven my distance be in other words brother i understand your anointing even if god opened the windows of heaven with this situation do you think something can come up amen elisha turn around and look at him he say behold you shall see it with your eyes but you shall not eat thereof because he got killed he said you will see it because you died but you're not going to eat it amen how is god going to send food somebody say yeah i remember moses said the man i was falling so maybe they were waiting god pulled a different way everybody here he look not at the good people everybody okay he went to the bad one the lepers nobody want to get closer to them they call them unclean they say give me the unclean how many are they four four is the number of four is the number of who put them only four he knew he's gonna use them watch now and there are four lepers man at the entering in the gate and they say to one another why sit we here until we if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit there we die also now the city there but over there the enemy was there and in the camp of the enemy plenty of food they're taking the rice and the throwing that on so israel is starving they're showing them all the coca-cola like this and israel is saying how can i get there you get there they kill you and god use four lepers why lepers anybody okay if we say we will enter into the city then the feminist in the city we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come let us in other words let us surrender to the host of the syrian if they save as they laugh we shall leave if

also life i'm gonna take my chance if they save me fine if they don't save me i'm gonna die the same way as i'm gonna die here or die over there anyway we are lepers what do we lose our situation is already bad nothing to do with us what else do we lose what happened verse five and they rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the syrian and when they were come to the other most part the outskirts of the camp of the syrian of syria behold there was no mandate amen stop what did they do did they pray did they fast were they all not praying did they fast 40 days what did they do they took a decision of life and death everybody okay and they acted under the decision they didn't take a decision and sit there everybody okay they took a decision and they stood yes and back here and they begin to go straight to the camp of the enemy one two one two determine die or leave we're going there and back here did god say he's gonna deliver israel from the enemy the word of god say i'm

her wherefore they did water and did what and left in the tent the what and there even they kept as he was and fled for the water so the the work of the four lepers everybody here that looks like nothing to you when the whole city was watching them they saw four people walking but they were not just walking they were walking by faith when they walked by faith god was moving there when they walked by faith god was moving there when they walked by faith god was moving there by the time they get there they got food they got horses they got money they got clothing they got everything because they acted upon their faith so from today don't look at your situation don't look at your condition no matter what you are struggling with in your life don't pay attention to that speak like

let's stand there hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah all that god need is a work of faith in obedience to what he says hallelujah don't worry about anything else don't watch the weakness that you're struggling you want to get that weakness off begin to confess it begin to act like you already been delivered from that and associate with the people that already get delivered from that and they will work into righteousness let's pray my friend heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for unfolding these things for us lord these things has been taught to be things that are complicated that are difficult that people went left and right and could not find deliverance but you heed everything under the word sozo into the dual atonement that the simplicity of salvation is the same key that is applied for healing and father we have measured many times in healing about getting be getting delivered for a sickness or praying for a loved one or praying for an operation or praying for an oncoming surgery but father we have been also suffering from demonic spirit from bad habit from smoking from cussing from gossiping from treating our families our husband our children our wife bad from not behaving good and we don't know the key to get delivered from those things and the key was still in the atonement you are the lord that forgive us all ours all our iniquities and you heal us from all our diseases if you can heal our body and you can remove a demon by healing you can also remove a demon by that way of salvation father may your children never pay attention to their weaknesses if their leper would have looked at their condition would have looked at the situation where there were leopards and maybe they already lost somebody members maybe they lost their fingers maybe they already lost their toes maybe they already lost some of their members but they never look at that situation they only took a decision and by decision they acted upon that decision and lord you step on the scene because when we do our part you also come and you add your part and when you took over not only did you bring food but father you brought more because you always give us exceedingly and abundantly above all we can ask and think and father i'm praying for this church if somebody's struggling with a habit if a young man is struggling with a habit that for years they can't get away from me or a parent a brother or a sister or those that are streaming they are struggling with certain things maybe they gather genetics from their family and they just behave a certain way or they have a weakness in a certain way by the power of the holy spirit father i'm standing here upon the atonement of cavalry i rebuke those demonic spirits make them leave their body made them live their life made them leave their family in jesus name [Music] whoever is sick in this building father touch them and heal them deliver their families deliver the marriages deliver the children deliver your children in jesus name and make them take this today and begin to confess it and act like it and believe it and move on and father you're gonna do your part because you always keep your part of the covenant we are the one that fell but not you lord and father if somebody is weak in the faith may you strengthen his faith like you did for peter that they never let it go and may this opportunity be taken lord father this time to free them completely for whatever situation they're struggling lord we humbly ask it and commit them unto the hand in jesus precious name amen god bless you brother john god bless you church [Music] the windows of [Music] the heaven are falling
