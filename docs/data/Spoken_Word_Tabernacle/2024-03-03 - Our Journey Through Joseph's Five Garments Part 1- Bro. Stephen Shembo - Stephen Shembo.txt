TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for my eyes I couldn't do it now by his grace I'm tied to him the one that said like he did in the days of Moses I am Moses you know he had an absolute when he was down there he had all the theology a man could have and he tried hard he was a military man he looked out the windows and by faith listen now remember by faith Moses esteemed the Repro of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt he had faith in what he was doing he absolutely believed it he know that he was raised up for that purpose but he failed he went out to raise sheep and he failed but one day back on the back side of the desert he come to an absolute he come to a place where he met something that was real that was a bush on fire he didn't want to take the leaves and go down to the laboratory to see the reason they they didn't burn he just sat down by take off your shoes Moses I'll go down and ask my pastor what about this he didn't have time to do that he must take off his shoes and when he heard in there there was a the word of the Living God that was in that bush I am that I am I remember my promise that I made with Abraham I remember my Covenant and I've come down to deliver them now then he had an absolute he was tied to that as long as he lived and it took him to Heaven he was tied to that absolute no matter what any of the theologians said he didn't need anybody to explain it to him he noted he had met God and the voice that big Pillar of Fire at let him through the Wilderness and plong to the promised land that Pillar of Fire in there had a voice in it and that voice was a voice voice of God that Vindicated the word amen I hope you're not asleep now notice that pillar ofar spoke the word and Vindicated to make it sure he quoted the scripture I am the god that made the promise to Abraham I'm the one that's what's the matter with Israel that's what's the matter down there I remember my promise and I've come down to see that it's done God only uses man to work with he doesn't use our organizations he doesn't use Machinery he could have done it but he chose a man that's right he could chose the Stars the wind or anything to preach the gospel but he chose man he does not change himself he always the same he chose blood for salvation education and nothing else will ever take his place blood is a God's appropriate way for salvation that's true now I want you to notice he can't change 20 he talk to Moses he said Moses I'm sending you down there but before you go I want to prove to you you that I am God said what you got in your hand there said a stick said throw it down and it turned into a serpent he picked it up again and come back a stick oh when Moses come to the place where the impersonator raised up trying to impersonate when he threw his rod down and said here a pharaoh I'll show you what God told me to do I'll throw this rod down watch it turn to a serpent and then Pharaoh said I've got them guys too my denomination can produce that so they come over and some impersonators what did Moses do he stood right there why he had met God he know that was God he had done his part it's God's time to move then he stay right there the Bible said the same thing we repeat in the last days for as jamers and jamus with stood Moses it's true but he stood there then he saw the hand of God come down and that snake goed up the rest of them did you ever notice what become of them sticks they were in the belly of this one stick Moses led the children of Israel through the Wilderness with that same stick with all them snakes inside of it again for I [Music]

Greg you send me something throughout the week I believe on Tuesday something about it Joseph so just keep that in mind amen I spoke about it last Sunday right on Sunday right it was not on Tuesday it was not on Wednesday it was not even on Monday I mentioned that last Sunday we clear so now let's stand and go to our scripture if you have any question I will tell you remember that sermon I mentioned that on Sunday we clear am clear amen glory to God praise be to the name of the Lord all is well let's go to Isaiah 46 verse 9 Isaiah 46 verse 9 if you dare you can say amen amen verse n the Bible says [Music] remember the former things of old so God want you to remember what happened before that's why the scripture even says that the Old Testament was written for our example and God is saying here remember the former thing of hold amen for I am God amen hallelujah and there is none else you might be seated so God is God one and only amen amen and there is no one that is like him there is no other God there is no other president there is no Prophet noet that can be compared to God no one else he's unique he's he's the top of everything I am God and there is none N El amen I am God and there is none like [Applause] me and we also know that the brde is him and the husband and the wife are one so if the there is no one like God there is also no one like the bride when I say God you will say Amen when I say the brde then you start thinking twice she is [Applause] him man shall leave the the father and mother and shall cling to the what and the two will become what and God is also male and female amen so God and his wife are what so if God there is no one like him what about the brde of God do you believe it glory to God hallelujah he says there is none else like me amen I am God and there is none like me amen how is this God this God that have no one that can be compared to him how is this God what is the characteristic of this God that makes him unique that make him different than anyone else that makes him special what makes him special what makes him different what makes him unique what is it verse 10 he's a god declaring the end yes from the beginning the end of your life God sees it before your beginning what makes this God special is before even the story is finished God can tell you about the story before tomorrow God can tell you what's going to happen tomorrow and once he speak nothing will de deviate from what he spoke am in other word glory to God in other word God has the full movie amen before the movie start is my Bible different than yours God has the full drama God has your entire life amen before you even begin that's why he can declare the end he can tell your end before you even stop start he can tell you who's going to win am before the race start amen so if you go to God and you talk to him about the race he can pull something aside and say do you see the winner and you are assured that no matter who's running even if the winner that God told you seems to be the last one running just be assured that one will be the winner amen because God said amen [Applause] yes what are you trying to say Pastor what I'm trying to say is the full movie of your life amen is in the hand of God am that's right amen amen and this movie is there before you even start the movie am that's why God could make such a statement when he was talking to Jeremiah God says that before I do what formed thee where in the belly so you existed before Mom and Daddy met amen amen when your father was in high school you already were [Applause] somewhere when Mama was in another city you were already existing somewhere that's right amen are we together the Bible says that before I formed thee in the belly I did what KN this knowing is not what you think okay brother okay everybody okay because the Bible say many should come in my name oh my and say Lord Lord have we not prfi in your name have we not done many miracle in your name and God say I never knew [Music] you but when it comes to Jeremiah God is saying I already knew [Applause] you there are some people that are not known by God oh my God Amen this knowing is not intellectual knowledge sir sir God knows about who's preaching God knows about who's doing miracle but there Ison another knowing amen amen that you can work for God you can do whatever you want to do for God and God say I never knew you but there is somebody that even before you are born God already knew [Applause] [Music] you it is good to be known by God amen amen even if the pastor don't know you but as long as God knows you even if no one knows you even if you are not popular in this message that's not the problem the problem is that God knows you amen hallelujah because if God knows you he has your movie if God knows you he has your life if God knows you there is nothing in your life that surpasses God even the mistake you [Applause] make are we pushing the right gears yes we are we claming good yes sir he says to Jeremiah he said before I formed thee in the belly I did what knew thee and before that came forth out of the womb I did what sanctify the how can you sanctify somebody who di even come up from the womb he gave John the Baptist the Holy Ghost before John was born is my Bible different than yours and the Bible says I did what orain thee a prophet unto what the nation so your calling is before even your parent get married Amen in other word whatever you going through this life Journey sir somebody have a recording somebody has a movie Hallelujah before your great great great great great great great great great great grandpa was born somebody already have a movie before L was born L paid tax in Abraham amen that's what the Bible says amen so L existed when Abraham was there amen but Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat L but in Abraham L was paying T to God am that's that's the Bible is my Bible different than yours Sir Paul says this in the book of Roman verse 9 chapter n he said for the children what being not yet born neither have been done what any good or evil so some will be born doing good right can you say amen amen some will be born doing bad and Esau was doing good can you say Amen am and Jacob was doing bad [Music] amen so who will go to heaven isau because he's doing good no they one God knew amen that's why the Godless of what e so do God say I love the bad one [Music] Jacob but I hated [Applause] his in other word what happen in the natural has nothing to do with you [Applause] am everybody okay am everybody good he says having done no good and done any good or evil that's the what purpose of God the purpose of who God your purpose no sir my purpose no sir the president purpose no sir the purpose of who God because he hold the movie amen the purpose of God the purpose of God I have to go this way because this need to soak in remember I told you this when last Sunday okay he says that the purpose of God according to what election might do what stand in other word when God elected Jacob uhhuh amen amen amen what God took as a decision is what matter that's it right what matters whether you agree with it or not it is not your purpose whatever happened in my life you have no control of it I don't know if you understanding me amen it is not your decision in my life it is the decision of God in my life or your life and that decision is the only thing that's going to stand everything else will fall apart right right that's right I hope you will soak this and I believe you will amen he says not of what words so what can you do then what can you do then there are people born in a message going to hell can you say amen amen there are people not born in a message born in a nightclub Mama begin to have I'm mean I'm in pain yeah Construction Construction in the nightclub and that person goes to heaven onas was of the devil brother say and he was the high priest but the fif the cross Jesus told him that today you going to be with me Paradise am what can you do amen amen amen even what you thought you were doing was he really you doing it is he really able coming up with this great Revelation no sir no sir thank you Lord thank you Jesus are we together not of works but of what him that call so your work is not a problem it is what does God what did God decide about you that's what the matter if God say you going to hell no matter what you're going to do even if you sleep with the Bible you will get your Bible in hell am come on you can Cho this steak right amen you can choose the steak right it shows you how privileged you are to feel God talking to [Applause] you because the Bible say out of the same clay God can make a vessel of honor and a vessel of what [Applause] but the clay is the same our flesh are the same our blood are the same but one is going to hell and one is going to heaven based on the decision of God everybody okay everybody good are we together in the back day are we together I need to hear some amen the coming [Applause] there let's go back to verse 10 declaring the water the end from water let's pray so we continue Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as much as I can do with the ability you are given me but Lord when he come to speak to your children I am not worthy to stand before the purchase of the Bride it's only Grace that predestinated me chose me and appointed me to this office to be a blessing to your children here and worldwide father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you move me completely out of the way may come and speak to your children and bless Al all of us Lord be the beginning and the ending of this service May the devil be completely sealed out in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen the Bible say he declared the end from what the beginning that's why he can speak about Jacob and Esau before they were born that's why he can talk about Jeremiah before Jeremiah was already was even formed in the belly of his mother amen he says and from ancient times the things that are not yet done amen nothing is done yet God from way way way way back he can say Behold a virgin shall conceive and it takes 800 years but God already spoke about it that is what makes him unique amen amen he continues he says from ancient time the things that are not yet done saying my what counsel the councel of who God the purpose of who God the councel my counsel amen my counsel shall do what stand amen not your counsel sir not your father's councel sir not your mother's councel not your friend councel but the Cel of God amen amen the Cel of

verse 11 calling a ravenous bird from the East the man that execute my Cel from a what our country so if it takes God to pull somebody from Africa Amen in his plan in his movie if he need an African he will pul that man from Africa and put him there to fulfill his plan if he need somebody from America he will go in America and pull that person and put him there if he needs somebody from the east or in Europe or South America God will pull that person and put him there to fulfill what he purposed to do so even you're moving even you're traveling when you say I feel like I need to go this place

cancer from a far country yeah I have done what spoken it I will also do what bring it to pass I have what purposed it I will also what do it so when God speak what will happen it will happen when God purpose it what will happen let's read it again let's go back again I will I have what spoken I will also do what bring it to pass so as soon as God speak uhhuh what do you expect and he say I have what purposes and I will also do what do it so what God speaks and purpose must happen amen that's why there is no one like him amen there is no one compared to him he's the only one that can speak can it happen amen he's the only one that plan and it happened you can plan and something can change but when God plan nowh no sir even if he has to snow God will freeze the snow because his purpose

if you dare you can say amen amen everybody hearing me okay yes Roman 28 uh not 8 verse 28 you there amen let's read it together you know this Bible you can read it you thought you got everything and when we read it's something new now let's read it based on what we read in Isaiah the Bible says and we know that some things even when you go to the barber shop oh you don't go to the barber shop okay man goes to the barber shop even when you go to the saloon let's balance that up all things do what work together for bad no sir for what goodus so whatever is happening in your life even though some of the stuff that happen in your life looks bad but there are for your good amen amen amen are we together amen are we together amen the Bible says that all things work together for what good not to everybody remember there is a knowing and a knowing you must be known by God if you are known by God then everything in your life God has the movie amen so I'm talking about the Royal Seed of Abraham are we together the Bible says we know that all things work together for what good to them that do what love God we already went through that love of God not everybody love of love God that's right the love of God means something else because it's God who put the love in you even if you go to church it doesn't mean you love God because the Bible say if you love me keep my commandment do you think everybody that goes to church keep the Commandment of God because some don't have the love of God that's the trth can I continue God is love so the love of God is God himself so everything is good to those that have God that's correct am am am am to the Gods is is brother okay he says all things work together good to them that do what love God to them who are the what according to what his purpose so God has a purpose amen and there are people that are associated with that purpose am and whoever is associated with that purpose that plan that project that agenda of God everything in

he might be the what the first born of among what many Brethren so we have a stature of a perfect man and God is producing children to look like the stature of a perfect man so that at the end all of us look like him am and there is nobody like me am because there is nobody like God and we are God [Applause] am can you say Amen say Amen so he so amen even if your brain cannot get it just say amen amen your brain will catch up lat amen this time it's your soul to say amen amen I'm not talking to the brain I'm talking to souls Souls of the Living God elects of God before the foundation of the world those that God predestinated that God forne that God purpose amen that God plan am that God associated in his hidden agenda that's the one I'm talking about for those people everything yes sir in your life work together for good am everybody okay verse 30 moreover who whom he did what predestiny what a package them he did what also called so before you are called you must be what predestinated so when you are called it means what predestin so if God calls you you automatically have to include in your agenda that I have been predestinated amen amen everybody okay amen and him who call he did what also justify do you know what justify means right it means you what justify and him he also what Justified he also did what glorified what shall we then say to what these things if God be for who us who shall be what against us so there are certain people that God have for for them am am that's why Paul say is there any Injustice in God he said God forbid but there are certain people that God are for them if they ever in trouble God leave everything he said not that one some other people God say that don't belong to him go ahead and who him but if it's their children if it's the children of God even if he's whooping he's watching say the devil not too much decrease decrease not this one HH go ahead whoop him in the back okay but don't put any scar on him

the Babylonian are coming beating the Jews they don't know that God is watching when they exaggerate God turn around and begin to whoop them in either way this is not what I told you to do if God be

just sh the woman to him he didn't want her so there is no true love what do you expect but God when he saw that friend we have a big God our brain are too tiny to comprehend the mysteries of God but God see fit to open them to you so you can begin to understand how he operate and when the Lord saw that Leah was how hated he did what opened her womb open opened her wound but Rachel was how Buren so God put a break unrel are we together let me say it this way God Blocked Joseph he did that's right Hallelujah that's right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen that's why your position in your family is not the problem amen you might be the first or the second or the third that's not the problem [Music] [Applause] [Music] am are you getting what I'm saying amen are you soaking in what I'm

Leah and opened the womb and God releases somebody from there are we there amen verse 32 and Leah conceive and bore who a son not a daughter because the birthright won't go to the daughter so God made son amen and she call his name who Reuben for she said surely What the Lord Has Done what looked upon my Affliction and did what now therefore my husband will love me so these women were prophetic brother Bram says that when they were giving birth amen they will prophesy something so instead of Joseph coming out and getting the birth right do you follow me amen amen Ruben now came out so the birthright is changed it is no longer in the hand of Joseph now the birthright is given to the hand of who Reuben oh Rachel is crying oh my God God do you really love me God look what happened I thought you love me you know this husband was mine you know what my daddy did Father father I'm praying you know my daddy he's the one that played the trick this man loved me he gave me his wing and daddy took my sister and put her there now Lord instead of you vindicating me after everything they have done for me amen you block me and now she's having a birth now her baby he's going to be the one receiving the birthright father why this why do you allow all this R everything work together for [Applause] good am and I have an answer for youer Joseph never lost the birth right no sir no sir
