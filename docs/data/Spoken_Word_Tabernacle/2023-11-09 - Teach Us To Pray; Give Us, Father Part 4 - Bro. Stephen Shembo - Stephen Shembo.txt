there is any visitor here any family member we don't call visitor we call you family member God richly bless you and once again welcome to spoken word Tabernacle on this Wednesday which I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon everybody is reading their Bible some are reading the Cod the church ages the adoption 70 weeks of Daniel the Ser or somebody have listened to the message of the hour amen when I say the Bible twice two chapters day one in the morning one before you go to bed amen you will really need your Bible today you really need the Bible if you don't have one check the Deacon if they can get you one make sure you keep up with your Bible because we will approach it as a teaching I thought it's going to be short but it turned up to be very very extensive so let's see how far we can go by the grace of God amen amen hey amen let's go to our scripture let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 8 Hallelujah Yes dear sister say amen back there if no one will say Amen you say amen amen Deuteronomy chapter 8 glory to God praise God praise God praise God praise God hopefully it's working would you try it praise God okay now we can preach if you there you can say Amen so on Wednesday I will see what I'm going to do Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 2 the Bible say and you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God LED you these 40 years in the wilderness to do what humble thee you might be seated so the Wilderness have a purpose amen amen amen amen you need to say amen amen the wilderness have a purpose and what's the purpose my friend to Humble thee God wants you to remember those hard time amen amen because they were there for a purpose he says God to Humble you come and to do what prove thee in other word to test to Humble you and to prove you or to test you amen amen why does God who knows everything need to test us he already know why do we go through the testing amen he says to Humble you Hallelujah to Humble you and to prove you to know what was in your heart amen that's the purpose whether you will keep his commandment or no it so all the trial of 40 years is for God to see whether you're going to keep his commandment or not so when you go through the Wilderness be careful it doesn't mean God have forsaken you amen when you go through a lot of headache be careful amen God is there he's watching he just want to make sure you can hang on to this word amen glory to to God verse three and he did what humbl thee he humbled you and allow you to do what hunger so where is the devil there I have a question for you where is the devil here who put you in the wilderness the devil no when I say God lead you in the wilderness who took Jesus to the wilderness who took him the spirit God why he didn't take him to Paradise come on so where is the devil here who humble you the devil no no sir who cause you to hunger the devil no all things am all things work for the good work together for what girl if you are God child everything is under control everything amen everything even what you think the devil is doing before he does it he always get permission you remember the story of on Lord amen he says he humbled you verse three and allow you to hunger God allowing you to hunger did he stop there if he allows you to hunger what else is he going to do himself amen and did what feed thee and feed you and fed you with what man so when God bring the hunger he doesn't even give you natural food come on Brother come on brother yes sir who brought the hunger God so who need to provide for the food God what kind of food did he give if you tired we close we go home right Mana glory to God Amen and then he fed you with Mana which you knew not so if God never brought hunger to these people they would never know mana come on it your hunger will cat you to McDonald your hunger will take you to Chick-fil-A but God's hunger will give you something you never experienced it's a hunger that will produce oil in the vessel and your children will never be slave again yes sir Brother come on brother yes sir [Laughter] it amen amen so it's an opportunity for God to show you something that you never experienced yes sir I don't even know if I would touch what I'm trying to preach tonight I know where I am it's so deep amen glory to God oh my Lord help me which you knew not neither did your father no so God can give you a personal experience that nobody in your family ever experien it if you waiting for whatever happened to your father to happen to you God can give you something that never even your father experiences maybe your parent never even experienced God can give you a special blessing that no one in your family ever touch that kind of blessing am I reading a different Bible no sir GL GL thank you Jesus amen glory he said neither did your father know that he man make you know that water man does not live by bread only so everything that happened here God was doing that for one purpose he make you hungry amen where there is no food that's right amen am so humanly speaking we're looking for food but God ambushed us and he placed Us in the wilderness in the place where there is no food to show you that you need to look at something more than food you need to look at something more than the natural that's why I put you because if food was there if food were there you're going to be looking at the tree to get something for food when Jesus was hungry he saw a tree what did he do curs the tree he went to the tree straight ahead to find food when there was no food he cursed the tree that's right but if you get in the wilderness there is no Tree in other word everywhere you look there is nothing God Did It for a purpose how can you hunger in the wilderness in a place where there is no food God wanted to teach Israel something that my word is more than food are we together so God want to teach you that man shall not leave by Bread what only but by every what that word word that proceed out of the mouth of what the Lord does men what live so the purpose of the trial is to bring men to a higher Dimension is to take man from a natural dimension come on now amen into a spiritual Dimension where men begin to depend not on natural resources but man is depending on the word of God Amen because the word can produce bread but bread cannot produce the word the word of God can produce your hamburger amen God does not only produce natural food God can produce a cook food because Jesus they gave him cooked food and cooked fishes Jesus never multiplied them into raw fishes he multiplied them in a food that was already cooked and seasoned and well [Applause] done so God can produce natural food and he can produce also cooked food so the word of God is greater than anything come on now what is the purpose of the Wilderness is to take you away from the natural resources yes into a spiritual resources sir is to take you away from the natural dependency into a spiritual dependency am where you can be in the wilderness and you still trust him Amen in the of death you still trust him when there is no oil you still trust him when there is no food you still trust him when there is nothing at home you still trust God because he is Jehovah jar amen glory glory glory come are we together yes are we together the song that was sung here should have taught you the level of the anointing that is in this place tonight whoever stay at home I'm sorry my friend you should be here tonight and feel what I'm feeling because we are in the ocean of Honey glory to God amen glory glory glory let's go to verse four your Remnant did what wax not old so when God put Israel Into the Wilderness he did something to the clothing before the Wilderness no no problem your clothing can get in trouble because you don't have time to find clothing in the wilderness so God hold on to the clothing so they Remain the way you got them if you got a brand new shirt it's going to remain brand new why what is he trying to do in other words you don't need another shirt just keep the way you are amen your remnant works not old upon you so whatever you wear it still Brin new what caliber he say neither did your water foot swell because they were using the feet for transportation so your transportation is guaranteed so when you're going into the Wilderness your car cannot break down if your car is broken down you need to go back to [Applause] God he's taking care of the food he's taking care of the clothing and he's taking care of the transportation and he's taking care of the health everybody okay he say your Remnant works not old upon you neither did your fut Des is what 40 years how can you keep a clothing for 40 years is still the same what power is there amen amen your feet don't swell 40 years 40 years 40 years working everything is still okay what kind of material what what what medication what pills is that that keep you younger and keep even your clothing younger your artificial clothing can be kept younger even the Mana in the holiest was kept younger everybody okay amen so according to Deuteronomy chapter 8 we find clearly here that God put Israel through the Wilderness caus Israel to go to the test in order to move Israel from a natural resource dependency from DSS everybody okay everybody okay amen because some people want to depend on the government they don't want to work they want to keep the low income so they can keep their food stamp you don't need the food stamp you need the god of the food stamp why should you limit your income to food [Applause] stamp I don't know who's doing that you want to depend on the government all the time on the healthare the healthare will fail you but God will never fail you [Applause] amen doctor reach a point where they don't have any solution but God always have a solution am because he's the god that can heal you from all sickness that's the one you need to depend on he is powerful Oh Glory to God father help me I'm trying to move let's go to Matthew chapter 6 Jesus Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus if you dare you can say amen amen but you know watch out with that camera when I remove that then he flip on you amen Matthew chapter 6 we understand Deuteronomy 8 keep that in mind Matthew Chapter 6: 5 if you dare you can say amen amen and when you pray you shall not be as the what Hypocrites Pretenders amen for they love to pray standing where in the synagog in the corners of the what streets that they may be what seen of men so the purpose of their prayer is to impress somebody to show somebody that they prayer Warrior when you pray in church pray honestly everybody okay amen everybody okay amen verily I say to you they have what their reward because you're going to be praised by man oh man that man that that sister is a prayer Warrior that's your reward corre everybody okay verse six but when When you pray enter into your water Clos and when you have shut your door pray your father which sees where in secret and your father which Sees In Secret shall do what reward thee openly the third pool is right there that's what they told Brother Bram but I will see where I'm going to go amen amen verse seven but when you pray use not what vain repetitions as the who Heathen do for for they think that they shall be heard for the what much speaking so what touches God is not too much talking [Music] amen teach us to pray amen not too much talking brother you need to pray 3 hours you pray three hours as the spirit Lead You amen you don't sit there and begin to repeat repeat repeat repeat like a Catholic yes Lord [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] am amen amen oh God why God doesn't want us to repeat so much because the problem is do not use vain repetition because the reason why they're repeating to repeat the things that if they talk too much God will hear them watch what God is saying amen why is God saying that why we don't need to have V repetition why V repetition we don't want to have V repetition one why what is the purpose follow me carefully verse 8 he says be not you therefore like to them for your who father not your husband that's it amen amen know what I'm talking about go go not your mother not your husband your what father keep that in mind amen your father father help me your father does what knoweth what things he have need of your father knoweth what things you have what need of before you do what ask him so why do we ask you will understand God tonight you will understand something if God already know what I'm about to ask why should I ask amen amen amen so there got to be something about asking if God knows he knows we ask amen so that why do not talk too much pray but don't go with v repetition because I already know what you are here for is you going to the left you going to the right you going to the left you go to I know your heart it's like a child that come that say Mommy how are you doing today are you doing okay Mommy I see that you tired but you know that he or she is after something that's right and you like okay I'm doing good so what's next in other way keep going and after a while do you know what can I go outside to play come on and you are sitting there just smiling because you knew there is something behind that so God is telling you come straight to business amen yes sir yes sir just come straight up front and say I want to go outside amen do you need a a a complicated formula for prayer no sir they giving you prayer simple you were waiting for me to tell you now you need to speak another language and Elijah was a man of like passion amen he pray and God understands what was in that man that God understand him was he praying in Tong no sir we think like when you go that's when really God is is understanding Pentecostal that's it everybody okay amen everybody okay amen verse n after this manner therefore pray you our who father remember again he's talking about what our father okay your father knows Our Father we already went through this which are in heaven amen Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name amen your kingdom come your will be done in earth as it is where in heaven you understand all of this today this is where we getting verse 11 give us what this day our what Daily Bread why does Jesus say your father already knows what you need and in the prayer Jesus is is putting for us to ask God again why amen amen today we're going to deal with go read verse uh 11 give us this day give us this day our daily bread our daily bread if I can even reach the word daily if I can just move from here and then get to here that's the problem amen let's go to Luke chapter 11 all of this is because of the seals it's the power of the seals since the seals are broken the Bible open up in a different form and in the deepest way amen Luke 11 verse one if you dare you can say amen amen and he came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he sees whoever Miss part one 2 and three one of his disciples said to him Lord do what teach us to pray this is where we draw our title so you can teach somebody to pray everybody okay amen teach us to pray as John also did what taught his disciples so John taught his disciple had to pray amen and they asked Jesus Christ to teach also us how to pray amen verse two and he said to them when you pray say what Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name Your Kingdom Come your will be done in uh as uh your will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us what this day give us day by day our what Daily Bread here he say give us this day over the day he say give us what day by by day day by day so we gave the two versions amen give us day by day in other word every day God need to give us something amen he need okay let me go your way God need to give us bread that that one you will say amen amen every day God need to give us bread so every day you need to do what to God pray doing what asking for asking him for what bread how many days every day did you ask him for bread today no we didn't did you ask him for bread today because you got bread in your storage that's why you don't ask him but Jesus say every day what do you do ask for bread but we already got bread at home we got bread I already went to Sam's Club I got a big bag of rice why should I ask again bread when I have bread what is really Jesus saying am huh we got a big storage at home with food and Jesus say every day you need to ask for bread so why do I ask for bread I have bread what is really Jesus saying if we got bread do you ask for it so we don't need to ask for God anything let's just leave our life but Jesus say every day every didn't Jesus know that you're going to put a storage amen that's right didn't Jesus know that in your kitchen there is a closet where you pack stuff there so why did he say every day ask for bread when you already pack everything for one month so you need to ask bread every month no no every day so why we don't ask for it show me anybody here tonight who ask for bre bread today you see what I'm saying you see what I'm saying did you wake up in the morning you say Lord give me food today why you didn't ask for food you have it what has Jesus say what is he saying why instead of saying uh I mean give me a car he didn't put a car he didn't put a house he put just bread what does he mean teachers to pray amen amen amen amen amen amen one more scripture and then we go it's right here in the B the Bible say in 1 Peter 5:7 casting some no all casting what all all what your care upon him so all our care are supposed to go to who Jesus not some of your care sir sir you don't pick which care to take to him that's it right amen as little as it is amen you don't have big cares you say okay this big cases goes to God this one I take it all your care all amen whether they are little medium or greater amen all your care goes to who to God all our care all our care where they are small medium I have to put it this way and large yes sir oh all our cares goes to who to Jesus goes to God why for he carth for you for he does what carth for you because God car he Care Health Care the ACT care that you see on your medic and stuff there God have one for you I know that's right because he car amen God cares for you amen he say cast casting all your care upon him for he carth for you if you notice that care you put it on him in other words you bring that burden and you put it on him amen and let him carry that burden amen not you amen are we together amen not you carrying not you carrying your burden you put that burden on him in other words as much Lord as you get that's when you transfer toward Jesus Christ don't you pity Jesus Christ when he cared for you so when Jesus is caring you say no Jesus is caring too much Lord we need to spare him a little bit no sir he's the big Samson [Applause] amen he's the one that can take the gates of Gaza and pull the Gate of Gaza out as little as he is but he can carry big things that's why you take all your care and you put it on him Amen in other words you're not supposed to have anything any burden on you you supposed to be free in your life amen soon as something happen you take it and you ship it directly in other words you need to link your account with God's account and put dra account as soon as a deposit come it is automatically transferred to Jesus Christ so that your life will be easy because somebody car for you let's pray my friend Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again again humbly tonight father we thank you for your presence and this anointing Lord father to take the Yoke and make it easy father thank you for your children that have gathered here tonight and those that are streaming at home Lord father you know various reason Lord father while they are streaming but we commit them unto their hand that father the same presence that is here bless them as well Lord move me completely out of the way may you come again as you did for your disciple come and teach us how to pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God my subject tonight is as we promised teach us to pray my brother you ready on the internet everything is going to be there thank you brother Angel he say teach us to pray and we are talking today it's part four on our daily bread our provider amen let me go this way so you make sure you look at teach us to pray Our Daily Bread provider amen Amen on part one we spoke about Our Father which are in heaven and we explained that he was showing a relationship that exists between us and God and that relationship is a relationship between a father and a son so when you are approaching God In Prayer Jesus wants you to approach God In Prayer as a child who's approaching a father everybody clear amen then we went on part one and seen that Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name in other words when you come into His presence you need to worship him then on part two we went through your kingdom come amen and your will be done amen and part three we went through your will be done in earth on Earth as it is in heaven and we seen the scene of Queen Esther whenever she goes to the king she say whatever pleases the king because there could be a uh uh uh there could be something contrary between your will and God's will that's why Jesus said nevertheless not my will but your will they could be a contradiction between your will and God's will that's why we always say your will be done you bring your petition but God might have something better for you because he always have something better for us amen and when we say the kingdom come in part two we explain to you that the kingdom of God according to brother BR means the spirit of the Lord because we need the spirit of the Lord to come and to help us pray if not we will be praying with our own intelligence Paul is saying this in Romans chapter 8:1 15 Paul say that for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to do what fear but ye have received the spirit of what adop whereby we cry what ABA father ABA father if you notice the spirit also when he comes into your life he want to establish the fatherhood of God into you amen he want you to understand that God is your father amen and Jesus say when you pray you say your father before even you pray your father already know amen he's your God but when it comes to prayer he want you to understand him as a father amen everybody okay and then Paul say this Spirit itself which is the kingdom beareth witness with our spirit that we are what the children of God so when the spirit of the Lord comes he convict you that you are God's son Amen in other word the spirit bring the connection back the spirit of the Lord when he comes in your life he move your connection from a natural father into a spiritual father because your natural father can die your natural father I or might not be saved but if you have a relationship with your spiritual father that one you are guarantee for eternity amen amen so he move your dependency from your natural father onto your spiritual father the spirit of the Lord convict you or unfold to you or reveal to you that you are God son or god daughter everybody okay amen and he said likewise verse 26 the spirit also do what helpeth our infirmity he help our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself do what maketh intercession for us with what groaning which cannot be other and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is in the mind what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the what Saints according to what the will of God that's why when you say th will be done the spirit of the Lord knows the will of God Amen and if the spirit of the Lord pick up the steering wheel he will take you straight to the whe of God and your prayer will be always answered amen because the spirit and God are want so the only way to have a perfect prayer answer is you got to be moved by the spirit of the Lord and you our prayer will be effective pray in the spirit it is very important amen everybody okay amen as we ding into our sermon tonight glory to God we know that prayer brother Bram says this he says father notice again I know why I'm saying this he said father it is the greatest what privilege that a mortal ever had was to do what close his eyes and open what his heart and do what speak to you brother Bram said the greatest privilege that a mortal can have is to just have the ability to close your eyes to open your heart and to talk to God Amen so if you can e a talk to God it's a greatest privilege amen so prayer should not be a burden Hallelujah prayer should be a privilege amen when they are calling you to pray you should be happy amen because they're calling you to the greatest privilege of speaking to your true father am your father who is your god who is your husband who is your maker amen who careth for you brother Bram continue he say and we know that you here if you could just believe that you here for Jesus say if ye ask the father anything in my name I'll do what be granted it shall be granted that was UN condition if we would not doubt it father he goes again back to Father help us to believe this afternoon that our petition will be granted and may there be no one Shadow of Doubt anywhere but it may come to pass the things that we are what asking in other words take any doubt from our heart and let us receive what we asking and brother Bram is saying that father is addressing God as a father we know that according to brother Bram we already established just remanding you so we can fly he says God never come for just any halfhazard way amen prayer is not a perhapse prayer is what a sincere thing prayer is what talking to God prayer is not get down and do what shut your eyes and thinking about your watching or your work you are doing and say Lord help me and John and heal Mrs John and so forth that is not what prayer that is what repeating some words Hallelujah everybody okay amen we clear so far Amen brother Bram said but prayer is to come into a what an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of who God if you recall when we spoke about prayer here brother brandham say see what does prayer what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing God down to men it is bringing who man up to God see as you pray you lose sight of this Earthly thing you sway out into somewhere Way Beyond and on and on and on until you come into what his presence that's why brother brandham say Until you realize that you are in his in the presence of God and you are moving to them in the what deepest of sincerity first you must do what it's a worship oh Jehovah I love you you see then after worship of prayer then you come with a sincere our heart doing what asking everybody clear so what are we talking about tonight now that we understand prayer clearly that's prayer you come with worship after worship then God give you the privilege to talk to him and to ask him what are we dealing with here here tonight amen amen in the sentence that we wrote there on the board Jesus say when you pray after you have worshiped after you understand that God is your father Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven now give us this day our daily bread or give us day by day our daily bread amen amen amen if you notice this sentence here it is a person asking somebody amen everybody okay amen and it's it is not just any person the one we are talking to is a father amen everybody okay amen are we together amen we are talking to a father they give us is not you not talking to your boss sir you're not talking to your wife you are not talking to your husband you are talking to your father am not any father but the Father which is in heaven everybody okay amen and the Bible say give us this day our daily bread it's a request are we together between a father and a son are we together amen Jesus is talking about a request between a father amen amen and his child amen and his child is addressing a petition he's bringing a request unto him saying Our Father which is in heaven give us this day or day by day our daily bread everybody clear so it looks like like the son depend on the father amen that's right amen amen amen amen I'm going slowly everybody okay so this sentence here speak about a dependency amen a dependency of one party toward another and the one who depending is the child depending on the father for the Daily bread in other words this child is unable to provide for himself I know you think you're going to work that's why you're providing your own food but when you get sick you're going to find out you're not the one providing food [Applause] amen because you working it doesn't mean you the one that put food on the table if they put you on a ventilator I don't know how you going to provide food in other words the strength that working you is God [Applause] Amen the money that you have in the bank is God Amen it is not your money amen it is God who gave you the ability to have it amen we need to remove our civilization away from our mind we are spoiled completely until we depend on material versus God everybody okay so this child is unable to provide himself and he have to depend 100% Amen to his father because it's the child telling the father give us this day our daily bread in other words you wake up in the morning and you say mama I'm hungry do you expect that child to go to food line no the Child Is Waiting For Mama to respond Amen in other words somebody still on the cast amen and God custody you don't come out of it everybody okay everybody okay forever we remain Sons unto us a child is what and what his name shall be called what what wonderful and what counselor and what Prince of Peace and what Everlasting what father Everlasting what it's a father that is Everlasting Everlasting father he will always be father everybody okay so this statement here is talking about the dependency of a child toward a father amen amen and this dependency is based on the responsibility [Applause] in other words someone is responsible for somebody amen and somebody's depending on the one who is under the responsibility are we together on the side of God it is responsibility everybody okay amen but on the side of the child amen it is dependency [Applause] amen so the child doesn't go to the father just like that the child knows that my care my problem my solution whatever I need of need to come from One Source if I need a marriage somebody need to give it to me if I need a car somebody need to give it to me if I need a house somebody need to give it to to me if I need a job somebody need to give to me whatever I need of I depend on one person because that person is responsible for me he's the one that birth me he's the one that brought me in this world am he need to take care of me amen Oh Glory to God I wish I had five hours man glory to God hallelujah amen in other word we depend on God Amen you the one that put me on Earth here I didn't ask to be put on Earth you the one that chose for me to [Applause] come hallelujah hallelujah what an anointing my God because at the beginning he was Elohim amen he was existing by himself and he was not satisfied to be Elohim he want to have children he want to be Jehovah so since you brought me here you need to take care of me amen glory to God amen glory to [Applause] God oh my God glory to God Amen why didn't you stay Elohim you were existing by yourself but he was not satisfied he want to have children now that we come what do we have to do uhuh we got to deal with our father am you the one that brother us here you need to take care of us

[Applause] everything if I go to school and I cannot pay my school I go R back to you amen I say I cannot go to college I was kicked out because I don't have money you need to provide for money you the one that started the temptation of Abraham you will provide the sacrifice amen because I was sitting quiet at home you the one that started you need to provide the sacrifice Jehovah jar hallu provider Oh Glory to God oh my God glory to God are we together amen are we together amen are we all together so give us this day is a relationship about dependency and responsibility amen and there is something that is hidden here too this relationship hide assurance [Applause] amen when these thing are coming a I mean a work it comes with an anointing that you don't know what to do everybody okay it comes with an assurance let me do this oh God responsibility here and then here we have dependency between responsibility for the father dependency for the ch but between the two there is a key word that is hidden here is Assurance follow me carefully in other word the one depending doesn't question whether the father have the ability to do it or not [Applause] amen spoken word Tabernacle you need to rise up with faith the time is coming that you need to depend on God your eyes need to look up to God my eyes look up to thee that's why David say where cometh my help and then he goes he goes and he say where I find my help come from the Lord [Applause] amen Are You full Are You full I have not left the airport yet when you see me doing this I'm trying to control myself everybody okay everybody okay so this relationship here it goes with the Assurance in other word the child when he's coming he doesn't think about daddy being in trouble [Applause] he doesn't know that Daddy missed the last payment he doesn't know that the house is two month not paid off that's not his worry he knows that whatever I bring will be granted Hallelujah so when they say give us this day our daily bread it is not just asking like that I'm asking somebody because I depend on him amen and he responsible for me amen and whatever I ask him I know he can provide it amen let me put some stabilizing screw brother KH miss you my brother let me put some stabilizing screw okay let's go to Matthew chapter 7 and we see this assurance am oh god brother Enoch if we can cannot touch what we

thing is you read this all all day do what ask when you ask what happened it shall be given to you so if you don't receive is because what you did not ask is that complicated no sir what did you ask God today see see how busy you are see how the devil keep you busy see how the devil keep you busy that's and you let the baker pass you by that's it that's [Music] it do you know what we do when we meet big people you know what we do we shake hand and then we take a picture quickly and we put on WhatsApp so everybody will see that me and the president of United States and then we get all the glory and that's it foolishness if if I meet the president of United States can I have your number I'm going to give you my number I am so and so in other word you want to grab that opportunity to even ask for something amen don't worry you don't need him I understand it but I know what I'm talking about watch what happened I tried to help you but somebody's over spiritualized Hallelujah I seen people who know big people but they poor and they just brag about it you know I know so and so I have a connection with so and so with so and so you look at him he's struggling I said so what are you doing with all this connection because this connection come in your life for a purpose you should be asking them how can I have a better job how can you have my husband have a better job but you are just using that for pride and showing off wasting your time and if you know a big God a big connection you just bragging I'm a message believer I'm a message believer I'm a message believer I'm a message believer what does the message do for you what are you drawing from the message amen the message need to change your life amen the message need to change your family the message need to bless you amen the message need to prepare you for the coming of the Lord I'm a member of spoken word Tabernacle what do you gain somebody's far way he gets just one sermon and they got a miracle and you got it right here and you don't have a miracle but they are far away in Australia and God touched them and they got a miracle but the one who's connected closer don't know how to use the connection amen am let me go back to the highway I was putting some guys on The Filling Station let me go back on 85 we there amen glory to God verse 7 ask and it shall be what given you remember these principle these are principle and what seek and what you shall find so you don't find do you seek do you seek so you want somebody to bring you a DSS seek and you shall do what fine and do what knock and it shall be what open how many doors did you knock it you don't knock lazy you don't seek you don't ask you got everything yet poor can I continue can I continue for everyone that what ask it do what receive this is a prle how many people that ask can receive everyone everyone this is why denomination or get stuff and message believer don't because some of message believer are proud everybody okay everybody that ask will receive so if you want to receive what do you have to do if you notice in the prayer you saying Our Father which is in heaven did you ask no hallow be that name did you ask no that Kingdom Come you are wishing his kingdom to come th will be done on Earth as it is in heaven did you ask no but the first time Jesus put a request he said now you already worshiped me you want the kingdom to come you want my will to be done now you already pass that step there is another step in prayer that step you don't worship anymore amen amen I'm helping you you don't worship anymore in other word worship has a beginning and an ending now you need to switch the button you need to switch the power you need to switch the G now you ask who are you asking your father amen and Jesus is saying whatever you everyone that ask is guaranteed should what receive amen this principle we don't use it I've been places you go they say how much is this you pay for and something come you say ask and you turn around you say can I get a discount and they then they look left and right and they give you a discount because you [Music] ask be unto you according to your faith if you don't have that Faith fine me I have it and I seen it [Applause] working I seen it working over and over when I get somewhere it's locking I say can I ask you a question and I have the answer because it's a principle you need to know who you are you're not asking because it's good to ask you asking with a background of the scripture right that's why you work amen don't worry continue your life my friend let's go he said for everyone that ask do what receive it and he that seek do what find it it's guaranteed and him that knth it shall be what open so if you knock it's not open you need to go back to God because heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away God it's impossible for God to lie it is impos the Bible say it's impossible for God to lie so what God Said must happen [Applause] amen I'm not venturing I'm coming upon the authority of the word you told me ask and it shall be given to you that's why I'm going to go and ask even if they already told me no when I remember the scripture I go back again amen Jesus spoke about the widow woman and the unjust judge how many times she was turned down but because of importunity because of persistence finally they open the door some of you got married do you know how many time your wife say no don't tell me the story you know the story yourself sometime the first time you came said no I don't want it and sometime he takes you yes and finally she say yes and you married don't worry keep it in the back let me continue amen verse eight for everyone that ask he shall be what receive and he that seeketh shall do what find it and he that knock it shall be what opened watch carefully Assurance you ready mm verse 9 or what man is there of you when who his son slow down let's go back again what man is there of you whom if his what son stop a son have what ask bread a son has what so Jesus is giving a relationship between a son and a father he said which one of you you are fathers you have children which one of you here if your son come and ask because here is give us this day we are asking our father now I'm trying to show you Assurance in this sentence look at this oh what man is there of you whom of his son his son so that man is a father his son do what ask bread stop asking what bread look at the board give us this day our what Daily Bread we asking our spiritual father now Jesus take it back to the Natural to humanly speaking because man is created in the image and the likeness of God and Jesus say let me drop down to your level between you you and your son I'm telling you to ask me bread every day now let me go down if your son ask you bread the same way I'm telling you to ask me bread what is the result of you watch carefully or what man is there of you whom of his son if his son ask for what bread will he give him a what a stone stop we talking about Assurance you are depending on God and God is responsible for your life and God is telling you you I want you to come every day to ask me for bread and I told you that it's not just dependency and responsibility but there is an assurance an assurance why this one must provide what the other one is looking for and Jesus now is Shing is adding now that not only is he going to provide but he cannot give something different [Applause] spoken word am I reading a different Bible he cannot give something different than what the child [Applause] ask do you get what I'm saying a natural father a natural father amen amen his son is asking for what bread am and Jesus is bringing the other one stone remember the devil told him to turn Stone into bread leave it alone everybody okay everybody okay bread and stone and Jesus say you when your child ask you for bread do you give him Stone in other word when your child ask you for bread what do you give him bread amen so whatever the child is bringing to God to his father he gets it can I continue let's continue to the next verse verse 10 or if he ask for what a fish what is the opposite which father is this one is Heavenly or a natural father natural father watch Jesus Christ if you then being how evil hallu I don't know if you get the point here our father give us this day our daily bread now Jesus is ding in our L he say you evil you bad the way you are you are bad but if something came out of you that is called your baby even if you you are bad your wickedness doesn't work against your [Applause] [Music] babyl everybody okay amen everybody okay because of the relationship of the one asking amen the one asking is not your friend it is not your enemy it is not your wife life it is your child it is your own blood amen it is your manifestation that's your DNA is asking you for something even if you are wrong do you give him the opposite everybody okay everybody good this one is bread a living thing it's dead it's Stone a living thing no this thing I drop right now serpent living fish living but look at the opposite and Jesus say you bad as you are which we expect you to do this because of your evil heart but when you remember this is my blood not my blood not my blood my blood I need to give him bread come here get bread the other one no I don't have anything but your blood it's something different why because it's your son I'm reading Jesus Christ verse 11 if you then being what evil know how to give what good gifts if you notice Jesus mov from bread amen am and fish into gifts are we together amen are we together am because most of us are corner by the word bread and we lock through there so if we if we have bread why should I ask God anymore that's why you lock now Jesus is opening the parenthesis everybody okay he started with water and he started with what now he doesn't talk normally Jesus should have said if you who are evil knows how to give good bread and Fishes then we are locked are you following me but Jesus forget about bread he forget about fishes now Jesus move into gifts what is the gift hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord a gift can be anything amen Hall when you go home you review this you're going to realize what God is telling you now that you're not catching Jesus is moving from bread and fish into what gift into gift gift now can be anything if I give you this it's a gift if I give you my shoes it's a gift and what kind the gift can you read it good gift huh what kind the gift good gift not just gift so if your child ask you for something you going to give him something good amen this is not your father amen it's not spiritual father yet it is still on the natural he's going to give him what are the gift good giftss how many Gift how many Gift how many gifts how many do we have [Applause] [Music] I hope it's I hope it's soaking I hope it's soaking if you then being what Bad Evil know how to give what good gifts to who your children to who your children so when it comes about father and children what kind of gift will come out good gift so when you approaching God as a father walk the gift must come good gift [Applause] let's go my friend he says good give to your children how much what more oh God shall who your father now look at Jesus Christ moving now from the earth now he's going back up to heaven because there too father now how much more your what Father which is where in heaven Our Father which is where in heaven how much more that Father in heaven give what good things stop is he using gift he's using what [Applause] things is my Bible the same as your Bible yes the father give what good things so if I have something bad in my life I'm ask question [Applause] God do you get me do you get what I'm [Applause] saying hallelujah hallelujah sister brid if brother Michel bring a bouquet of flour and they are all dead and something don't answer that question you going to question him why am I getting this what what did I do to deserve this because you know what kind of bouquet he need to bring because his bouquet Express his intention toward you amen and his love toward you am the the the gift of the father is expressing the the love of the father toward the child [Applause] amen my time is almost stop my friend I have I tou surf he say your father from which is in heaven give what good things now it's no more gift it's what good things things how many things how many things I love my translator my my myot hallah amen we move from what bread bread to what fish fish to what gifts gift to what things now when he say give us our daily bread do we stop a bread no stop we continue amen amen amen amen amen he says good things to them that do what ask him because ask and it shall be what given unto you and if you ask him he's going to give you what kind of thing good things why because you are his [Applause] child everybody okay everybody good amen everybody good amen let's go to Luke chapter 11 teach us to pray when you begin to approach god with this understanding sir your prayer changes because at the beginning we approaching God by routine we don't even know what to ask we just doing praying because they say you need to pray but now you need to know that's why the Bible say him that comes to God must first believe that he is and he is a what rewarder so you cannot approach god without first believing he's a reward amen so you must first convince yourself that hey the one I'm going to talk to is my reward when you accept that that's when you go to pray if you have not accepted that don't pray don't pray yet because you not you know no you might as well go to sleep I can prove to you by the scripture that you're not going to receive anything by the scripture don't worry let's go my friend Luke chapter 11 father help me if you thereare you can say amen amen I only read two quotes everybody okay amen you there amen jump to verse n and I say unto you do what ask and it shall be what given you seek and you shall do what find knock and it shall be what opened unto you for everyone that ask do what receive it and he that seeketh do what find it and to him that knth he shall do what open if a son shall ask for what bread again it's right there of any of you that is a father so it's a relationship between a what a son and father a father and a son if you ask you if if they ask you a bread of any of you that is a father will he give me give him a what stone or if he ask a what fish will he for a fish give him what serpent watch again we on that was verse 11 verse 12 oh if he shall ask for what an egg hallah let me ask you a question what is there that you cannot ask God now abely we move from a fish to a what bread a bread to gift gift to things now even the [Applause] egg so if one day they say there is no more don't worry H do you know what the third pool created did he create elephant he created what if he was us we would want to have an elephant in other word whatever brother Bram was looking for that's what came out now Jesus is putting what egg if they ask you for an egg amen will of a what a scorpion Scorpio is he going to harm you a serpent to kill you a scorpion to kill you Stone to do what to crush you can I continue watch verse 13 very well if you then being how evil know how to give what good good gifts to your children how much more shall your who Heavenly Father the father of heaven give what the Holy [Applause] Spirit give what Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit to who them that ask because ask and it shall be what given to you now we move from gift into the what Holy Spirit and do you know that the Holy Ghost is a gift amen am do you know that amen and you shall repent and be baptized in the name of what Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift the Holy Ghost is a what and it's a good gift so you can ask God for a bread you can ask him for a fish you can ask him for a egg you can ask him for gifts and things and Holy Ghost amen am you say brother Steven when you got receive the Holy Ghost you you have seal once until the day of redemption that's true but why in act four the disciple went to trouble and they came back again and the lord gave them again the Holy Ghost brother Bram called that the refilling so even if you were filled with the Holy Spirit you have a right to go back again and to continue to ask for what amen refilling for a refilling of the Holy Ghost oh my God amen amen amen amen let's go to James I might have to stop somewhere here let's go to James because time is running Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done give us this day our daily bread talking about dependency 100% And resp responsibility but there is an assurance what is the Assurance whatever we ask the father we're going to have it amen and the father will give us he won't swap it he will give us exactly what we need he won't swap it because if bad father knows how to give good gift to their children how much more god with his children because the father of the earth only reflect God in an imature way amen amen father help me let's go to James chapter 1 if you thereare you can say amen amen I wish I can even touch this Lord help me oh my five minute amen James chapter one if you there you can say amen amen let's go to verse 17 my brother make sure everybody read it you there amen every what good gift amen amen amen let me back up here watch it if you ask a what bread or what fish or what egg or what gifts how many what kind of gift good gifts now watch James okay good gift good things Holy Ghost watch James verse 17 every what good gift and every what perfect gift amen hallelujah your natural father can give you good gift according to the Bible your natural father can give you good thing but here it is not only good gift but also perfect gift oh spoken word every what good and what perfect so where are we reaching who's perfect the natural can give us good things they can give us good gift now every good gift and what perfect gift perfect gift amen and perfect gift amen comes down from who the father everybody okay we talking about the father and the child look at James is not saying come from God come from the father he wants you to remember he's father that's right every good and perfect gift come from your father because when we say you're God then we have a tendency to go like this when you say my father you can go and hug him it's Jesus Christ who gave us the C the the the courage and the ability to hug God in the Old Testament you don't touch the mountain only if God is in Jesus Christ that's when even a PR can touch him amen amen amen am and he keep talking about the Father the Father the father and Philip look he say show us who the father he say Philip you don't understand when you see me who do you see the father that's why you can hug me that's why you can sleep closer to me that's why even John can put his his head right here on my chest because I'm a father [Music] Jesus Christ he say every good gift and every perfect gift is from who above Heavenly Heavenly and comes where down from who the father of life with whom is no what varess stop let's go back here Jesus say if you ask for bread is your father going to give you what a stone does it happen no if you ask for fish are they going to give you f no did it happen if you ask for egg are they going to give you scorpion so the natural father doesn't have valuableness he doesn't change amen he says in whom there is with whom there is no what variableness neither shadow of what turning so when you come to God asking God something it's an assurance that God won't deviate from what you're talking about [Applause] because the natural father cannot deviate your evil father cannot deviate our evil father cannot deviate I'm not telling you our father are evil but evil because we were born in sin shaping iniquity coming into this word speaking life even in our bad State we have a conscience to do good things to our children amen but how much more God so when you come and you say our father give us this day our what daily bre it's a dependence of responsibility but it's lock with Assurance in other words when you approaching God you cannot think twice whether he's going to give you something or not you cannot even doubt that maybe he will say yes or no you are coming straight with a 100% confidence that whatever I'm going to ask God is going to give it to me because he is my father amen he is the good father amen he is my shepherd amen he's the one that bur me he's my [Applause] responsible amen amen amen amen oh my now if I get to this it's going to be something else we got to stop here let me see yeah I just passed one minute if I dig into this it's more extensive amen amen bear with me we're going to catch up again Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thaty kingdom come thy will be done in heaven as it is on Earth give us this day our what Daily Bread God expect us to ask why because God is our father we are his offspring we are his children and we depend on him he understand that he expect us to ask him and when you ask him ask him as a child that is asking a father ask him knowing that he cannot give you something bad ask him knowing that he's the good God because he said no one is good but God so ask him knowing that he cannot wather ask him knowing that every good gift and every perfect gift come from him that's why I'm approaching you if my father can give me this how much more you if my father can give me something good so you can give me not only good but you can give me something that is perfect do you want a perfect health do you want a perfect marriage do you want a perfect children do you want a perfect life do you want Perfection God is the author and the finisher of your faith whatever you have need of God is able to do and he can do exed inly and abundantly above everything you can ask and see teachers how to pray God richly bless you let's stand and stop you [Applause] amen When you pray Paul say you praying with understanding now when you go to prayer you you know what you're saying you know what you're going to talk you're not just going just guessing of some invisible being that is somewhere maybe way in the sky maybe in the galaxy somewhere that I'm going to talk to and I have been talking to him sometime he works sometime he doesn't work that's not the concept that's not the mentality brother Bram say any correct mental attitude toward me mental attitude you need to have that correct mental attitude brother say toward every Divine promise will bring it to pass in other word when you approaching God you know who you're talking to if you have a difficulty believing before you pray sit down and think about what you do to your children meditate a little bit like what if my child ask me this what will be my response after you begin to meditate then when you come come and you soak that Revelation then you turn around you say this is the same thing God will do for me and he can also do more so than what me I can do because me as a man I can turn down somebody and say no you know what because you did this I'm not going to give it
