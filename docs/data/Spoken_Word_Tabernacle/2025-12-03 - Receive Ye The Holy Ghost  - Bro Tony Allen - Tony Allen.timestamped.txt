[23:13] So my husband had a surprise trip where
[23:17] he wanted us to travel with him, but he
[23:21] didn't didn't tell me like he told me
[23:23] like two days before. So when he told me
[23:26] I didn't like it. I didn't like it. I'm
[23:28] like, "Oh, where are we going? I don't
[23:31] want to go. You did not prepare me."
[23:35] He's like, "I'm sorry, but you have to
[23:38] pack." So we did. We did. We went biking
[23:43] with my children. Then we went then he
[23:46] sent me a quote where about the B was
[23:48] say was saying about the trip to go with
[23:50] the children. He sent me the quote. So
[23:52] when I write the quote I'm like oh I can
[23:55] say nothing. I say amen.
[23:58] I say amen to the court. So let's go. So
[24:02] when we went there he was he was
[24:05] supposed to dedicate the the house of
[24:07] one of our sister and invisible audience
[24:12] family. So he did he did not tell them
[24:16] that we were coming to dedicate the
[24:19] house. He was trying to surprise them.
[24:22] So when we got there we got home nobody
[24:25] was home. Only the brother was home. So
[24:29] he explained to the brother that we came
[24:31] for this and this. The brother said, "My
[24:33] my wife is at work." I called the wife.
[24:35] The wife was in shock. She was like,
[24:38] "Why you didn't tell me?" I'm like,
[24:39] "Your pastor didn't tell me. I could not
[24:41] tell you."
[24:43] So the sister say, "Okay, no problem.
[24:45] We're going to meet." Then when we uh we
[24:48] got there and we have another family
[24:50] from Florida. So I thought they are they
[24:53] are living in the the same the same city
[24:56] where we went Orlando
[24:59] as texture that we here but the sister
[25:01] did not answer me. Then uh we returned
[25:04] to the hotel where we were with my
[25:06] husband and the children. The sister
[25:09] sent me a message that they are exactly
[25:13] in the city where we are. that when my
[25:16] husband put the the address on the on
[25:19] the telephone, it was showing we are
[25:20] about uh 30 minute apart. So my husband
[25:25] say it's 12 a.m. we cannot go. It's it's
[25:28] too it's too late. So we didn't go on
[25:32] Saturday. The the family where was
[25:34] supposed to dedicate the house uh asked
[25:37] to come back on Saturday. We went there
[25:39] on Saturday and the sister invited so
[25:43] many people
[25:46] They came the very same day. Then when
[25:50] they came, the pastor start preaching
[25:52] about about dedication, the meaning of
[25:56] it. But as he was preaching, the Holy
[25:59] Ghost was so strong in the house. It's
[26:02] just the dedication, but the Holy Ghost
[26:04] was so strong. I thought I was the only
[26:08] one who felt it. But when I got the
[26:10] testimony from the owner of the house,
[26:13] she told me so many people testify about
[26:15] it. Some of the unbeliever,
[26:18] they also asking for for us to start
[26:22] like a church over there.
[26:28] Then I told my sister, say sister, ask
[26:32] them to pray. Ask them to pray about it
[26:35] because I don't know. So everything went
[26:38] well. The dedication was so good. So the
[26:41] next day we were supposed to catch our
[26:43] flight. My husband tried again the
[26:46] address of our sister when we were in
[26:47] the hotel. It turned out to be they were
[26:50] close to us 15 minutes. So we are like
[26:52] okay we going there. We got there.
[26:56] It was a blessing when we met. The
[26:58] sister told me say, "Sister Chevron, we
[27:01] were coming to North Carolina to
[27:03] surprise you guys."
[27:06] But they are in Florida, Miami. But when
[27:10] we we we the car we rented was broken.
[27:13] When we got to Jacksonville, my husband
[27:15] say like, "Okay, let's go to Orlando
[27:18] just to visit people." When I opened the
[27:21] phone, I saw your message. You are here.
[27:23] I told my husband, "This is God."
[27:26] So we went we met over there we we share
[27:29] about the words we got there at 11 and
[27:33] we left there maybe at 1 something
[27:36] before we get the the before getting the
[27:38] plane. So the brother and the sister
[27:41] they were with their younger sister who
[27:43] was newly engaged. So we start sharing
[27:46] about the word uh how to quote a a girl
[27:51] all those stuff and they told then the
[27:53] man said pastor we are many of us in
[27:57] here in Florida a bunch of us what I'm

[28:07] like I don't know about it
[28:11] so pray pray about it so I'm like but
[28:14] Stephen we need to pray. But the the
[28:16] things that we really that I really

[28:24] we can meet then he can share the word
[28:27] with this brother and the presence of
[28:29] God in the house as we are praying. So I

[29:29] also have a testimony.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Um,
[29:33] &gt;&gt; do you guys remember
[29:36] my wife had a has a friend that works um
[29:40] with her and her grandson happened to
[29:43] have uh
[29:46] clots
[29:47] and he was 16, clots in the heart and
[29:51] they took him to Greenville Memorial and
[29:53] when they opened the heart they were
[29:55] overwhelmed. They just could not do it.
[29:58] So they ended up airlifting him to
[30:00] Charleston
[30:02] and when he got there the condition was
[30:04] so bad um we I believe we put it on the
[30:08] zoom and we prayed for it and and then
[30:12] the Wednesday we came here we prayed
[30:15] some more
[30:18] that bad condition
[30:21] I don't know how to put this um he got
[30:25] so better that he they had to send him
[30:27] home.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; So, church of the living God,
[30:34] I am telling you, we are serving the
[30:37] living God.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; And the zoom, the zoom is not a joke.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; When we get in that zoom, we are in
[30:47] connection
[30:48] &gt;&gt; with heaven.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Why don't we all stand? So the boy is
[30:53] doing very very well
[30:55] &gt;&gt; and they had put him on the um on the um
[30:59] how you call that the heart uh
[31:02] transplant and they're saying that he
[31:04] might not even need he don't need a
[31:06] heart transplant. So because of your
[31:08] prayer let's just bow our heads. Thank
[31:10] you Lord Jesus.
[31:12] Thank you Lord. Thank you father
[31:16] how much we appreciate you this evening
[31:18] Lord Jesus.
[31:20] Truly, you're showing us that you are
[31:22] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[31:25] And we receive, oh, Father God, the

[42:43] operation. and you just go with a drone
[42:45] destroy and come back and then you're
[42:47] back again normal. Amen. You already

[43:28] if you realize what God is doing all
[43:30] over the world. Amen. We are preaching
[43:32] things here and don't know that people
[43:34] somewhere are getting healed.

[44:00] This prayer service on Tuesday is
[44:02] powerful.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't know, I don't know where
[44:06] you are, but I see God doing things.
[44:10] There is uh a woman. She's not even a
[44:14] message believer.
[44:16] She she she work if I'm not mistaken
[44:18] with sister Adasa. She put a prayer
[44:20] request and she requested the link and
[44:22] they asked me if I would allow her to
[44:25] get in the zoom link. I say go ahead and
[44:27] give the link and she jump on it and you
[44:30] seen her daughter coming up like Amelia
[44:32] yesterday and they put a request
[44:34] yesterday. This woman put an application
[44:36] sixth time and was declined and and she
[44:40] put an application the seventh time and
[44:43] she stopped at uh at a food store or a
[44:46] fast food or something trying to get
[44:47] something to eat for $22 and she got
[44:51] declined. Her car declined because she
[44:54] didn't have the fund. $22. And then we
[44:57] pray with her on Tuesday. And today, by
[45:01] God's grace, she received a letter. She
[45:04] has been sent me a check of $2,200.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. She tells I tell your church, God
[45:22] is working.
[45:25] Amen. God is working.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine those numbers?
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Are those number telling you something?
[45:32] &gt;&gt; $22.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; She got declined trying to get food
[45:38] because of the condition that she was
[45:40] going on. And she received an approval
[45:42] the seventh time, an approval of $2,200.
[45:48] So, so this times 100.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; So maybe when she got declined, she was
[46:00] worrying about it. She didn't know God
[46:02] was giving her her number right there.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; And the next day, $2,200.
[46:08] So I saw the letter. They even took a
[46:10] screenshot and sent me the letter. I saw
[46:12] the letter coming up. $2,200
[46:15] a 100 time
[46:18] God gave.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; God is alive.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; You see Sister Olivia right there?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see her right there? It's a
[46:29] miracle.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; If I show you the picture
[46:33] &gt;&gt; of how she was and how the devil
[46:35] attacked her twice
[46:38] &gt;&gt; and how she is today, this is a miracle.
[46:41] It looks like nothing happened. until
[46:43] you see the picture.
[46:46] Her face was swollen and everything
[46:48] swollen up. I saw the picture. They come
[46:51] I mean from uh Florida, wherever I got
[46:53] the message, the face was swollen up
[46:55] twice. And by God grace, she's standing
[46:58] right there on the post of duty singing
[47:01] and everything back to normal.
[47:06] Church, God is doing things beyond our
[47:10] brain. You have no clue. I'm talking I
[47:13] was talking about transplant here and
[47:15] then uh a healing and God touched sister
[47:18] AOS and another sister in Florida got
[47:20] healed.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Church
[47:30] only God will let us know. Brother
[47:34] brother Glenn keep telling me this all
[47:36] the time. And he say only on the other
[47:38] side
[47:39] &gt;&gt; that we will realize what God is doing
[47:41] right here. Amen. There are people that
[47:44] are desiring to be right here sitting
[47:47] right here. They are they are even
[47:49] praying and because of their job and
[47:52] being there being in a certain place for
[47:54] years and trying to move. It's a
[47:56] difficult brother.
[47:58] Only when you go out you begin to
[48:00] realize what God is doing. The people
[48:02] that my wife told you that were invited
[48:04] there were not message believer.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; There were 20 something people if I'm
[48:09] not mistaken. Only one two people the
[48:12] remaining all of them denominational
[48:14] people. It's on it's uh it's over there.
[48:16] It's recording. They were not message
[48:18] believer. And you should feel the
[48:19] presence of the Lord. And you should
[48:21] feel how people begin to pray in that
[48:23] house. And one even uh send a message.
[48:26] They say tell that pastor he should have
[48:28] come and pray for my house too.
[48:32] So I know I got few houses here that I
[48:34] need to visit. Please allow me. Give me
[48:36] some time. We work with my schedule.
[48:38] Don't get mad. You say, "Brother
[48:40] Stephen, you left me here. You went all
[48:42] the way to Florida to dedicate a home
[48:44] over there." I will try. My schedule is
[48:47] packed and booked left and right. We
[48:49] will try to work things out. But it is
[48:51] good. Sister Sheron is happy.
[48:56] People say you don't go to vacation. You
[48:58] don't go to And I'm just sitting quiet.
[48:59] I said, "One day you will learn." Amen.
[49:02] And I schedule everything. She didn't
[49:04] know. I just keep saying, "Oh, no. We
[49:05] need to get to the vacation." Say, "Keep
[49:07] you you just keep moving." Until I
[49:09] pulled the trigger and say, "Okay, get
[49:11] in. Where are we going? Are we going
[49:13] alone?" I say, "I'm going to go with
[49:14] you. Get in."
[49:17] But now everybody came relax and we
[49:20] praise the Lord and thank you for
[49:21] allowing us and giving us a time. Today
[49:24] it is our convention. I'm not preaching.
[49:26] Brother Tony Allen is preaching. By
[49:29] God's grace, brother Tony has been a
[49:31] tremendous help, helping brother John
[49:34] with the music and then picking up where
[49:37] sister Yuk is on a honeymoon and then
[49:40] deacon here and minister, a man of many
[49:43] heart, brother Michael. Amen. So, but by
[49:46] God's grace, we are in the midst of
[49:49] people that are gifted. Let's cherish
[49:51] one another. Cherish the gift and
[49:53] embrace it and nurture that because God
[49:57] help us. It's easy. It's very easy if we
[50:00] have a wedding right here to just go
[50:02] talk to sister Pam.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; It's very easy. It makes things simple.
[50:05] I just talk and I know I'm dealing with
[50:07] a believer and they're going to take
[50:09] care as a believer. And sometime they go
[50:12] beyond
[50:14] just because they wanted to make it look
[50:16] nicer. If I want a cooking, I can call
[50:18] sister. I can call sister so and so. I
[50:20] can and and it's a tre. You don't know
[50:23] what a tremendous blessing it is just to
[50:25] know that my things are handled by a
[50:28] believer. Somebody who believe the
[50:30] gospel like me. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for each one of you
[50:34] and let's pull on the gift of the Lord
[50:36] as we call brother Tony tonight. Only
[50:39] believe.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Oh

[1:00:19] through the love
[1:00:24] of all this.

[1:00:41] an empty
[1:00:48] gra.

[1:00:55] That'll be all musicians.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Put your hands together for
[1:01:00] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He's here.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Just want to thank brother Stevens for
[1:01:14] allowing us to come on tonight. Um
[1:01:16] it's a privilege um just to be called on
[1:01:19] and we're glad to be here to be with the
[1:01:21] saints amongst the believers
[1:01:23] and it's good to see y'all back off your
[1:01:25] trip. It's it's it's a different thing
[1:01:28] when you see someone face to face. You
[1:01:30] know, we we we saw you on the Zoom last
[1:01:32] night, but face to face is a different
[1:01:34] feeling.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; It's a different u feeling. Um,
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; and and I think about it on that day
[1:01:40] when we get to see Jesus Christ.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; It's going to be so much different
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; than what we have right here. Just to be
[1:01:50] able to look upon his face.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; It's not the same.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; I promise you, it will not be the same.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; It won't be the same.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; If you can get your Bibles, let's turn
[1:02:04] to the book of
[1:02:07] The book of Acts, chapter 2,
[1:02:12] verse 37.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; When you when you found it, you can just
[1:02:29] say, "Amen."
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] Verse
[1:02:34] 37 reads,
[1:02:38] it says, "Now, now when they heard this,
[1:02:43] they were pricricked in their heart
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:02:48] the apostles, men and brethren,
[1:02:53] what shall we do?"
[1:02:55] Then Peter said unto them,"Repent
[1:02:58] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:03:00] name of of Jesus Christ for the
[1:03:03] remission of sins,
[1:03:05] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:03:07] Holy Ghost."
[1:03:09] Verse 39 says, "For the promise is unto
[1:03:12] you."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; "And to your children, and to all that
[1:03:16] are far off."
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:03:20] call.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Be
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; on. Bow your heads. Let's
[1:03:25] Lord God, we ask that you bless your
[1:03:27] word tonight, oh Father. Oh God, as we
[1:03:30] come to you, oh Lord God, with high
[1:03:31] expectations tonight, oh Father. Oh God,
[1:03:33] we didn't come to see your man tonight,
[1:03:35] oh Father, but we came to hear from your
[1:03:37] Holy Spirit, oh Father. Oh Lord God, I
[1:03:39] pray, oh God, that you touch every heart
[1:03:41] in here tonight, oh Father, all the
[1:03:43] desires of their hearts, the wants of
[1:03:45] their needs, oh God. And I'm sure you
[1:03:47] know all about them, oh Father, before
[1:03:48] we got here, oh God. Oh God, even their
[1:03:51] visible audience tonight, oh God,
[1:03:52] whatever their needs are tonight, oh
[1:03:53] God, I pray that you would reach through
[1:03:55] that channel, oh Father, and touch their
[1:03:57] bodies, oh God, and their hearts, oh
[1:03:59] God, and their minds, oh Father, and and
[1:04:01] and fill, oh God, their spirit, oh God,
[1:04:04] with whatever it is they have desire of
[1:04:06] tonight, oh Father. Oh God, we ask that
[1:04:08] you bless the remaining of the service,
[1:04:09] oh God, and we put it back in your hands
[1:04:11] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[1:04:31] I'm going to use for a s a short subject
[1:04:33] tonight.
[1:04:35] Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Receive ye
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Now, when we look in the scriptures,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; It it it plainly states that this Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; is a promise.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; And and and if you don't mind, I would
[1:05:05] like to read this quote.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; This powerful quote that was in the
[1:05:09] group chat Brother Steven sent out. It
[1:05:11] was real powerful and I and I I must
[1:05:13] read it.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. is it it say it says
[1:05:17] in 1957 in Hebrews chapter 2 number one
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; it said when God makes a promise in the
[1:05:23] Bible
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; he said I see a man here in a wheelchair
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; he said when God makes a promise
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; he is guilty
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; of that promise
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; unless he brings it to pass
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; he
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; it say God is guilty when he makes a
[1:05:44] promise
[1:05:45] And the scriptures are guilty until they
[1:05:48] are fulfilled.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; See there right there he say as a
[1:05:53] statement that God has made
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; and it's God to be fulfilled or God is
[1:05:58] guilty.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; You see? So
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; God has promised you the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] tonight.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let me take my time here tonight. I try
[1:06:09] not to rush and I want I want to go back
[1:06:10] because I I originally had planned to
[1:06:13] speak on something else and um I got up
[1:06:15] this morning I went to work and I was
[1:06:17] riding down the road and
[1:06:19] it dropped in my spirit said receive ye
[1:06:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; and you know the you know me thinking as
[1:06:25] a man I'm like Lord this is the day of
[1:06:30] you know how can I change this up this
[1:06:32] is the day of so I was like well I'll
[1:06:34] take it home and pray over it and I you
[1:06:36] know when I came in the house I walked
[1:06:37] in the
[1:06:38] you know, we had the prophet was already
[1:06:40] playing and I said, "Well, Lord, if you
[1:06:42] you know, if this is the way you want me
[1:06:44] to go, then you you have your prophet to
[1:06:46] speak to me
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; and I I didn't think about it no more."
[1:06:49] So, you know, I went to preparing to
[1:06:51] come up here tonight and um I noticed
[1:06:54] that the volume was turned a little low
[1:06:56] because I started shaving and and the
[1:06:57] and the noise from the Clippers was too
[1:06:59] loud. I couldn't hear what he was
[1:07:00] saying. And I was like, "Let me turn it
[1:07:03] up a little bit. If God gonna speak, I'm
[1:07:05] going to be right on time. So when I
[1:07:08] went to speaking and he was um praying
[1:07:10] um he had a prayer line going and he was
[1:07:12] basically was saying the moral of the
[1:07:14] prayer line was that I don't know these
[1:07:17] people they're strangers to me. You know
[1:07:20] how brother Brown praying. He was like
[1:07:21] if you if you believe you know that God
[1:07:23] can do this or do that he's like you
[1:07:25] know you you believe that God can tell
[1:07:27] me what your condition is. And um he
[1:07:30] went to the second or third person and
[1:07:32] he asked the brother, he was like,
[1:07:34] "Would you believe me if I tell you what
[1:07:36] it is that you have need of?" He said,
[1:07:37] "You he said, "You want the Holy Ghost?"
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "Uh, he said,
[1:07:43] "That's what you desire." He said, "Go
[1:07:44] away and receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; So I threw my hands up. I said, I said,
[1:07:49] "Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you,
[1:07:51] Lord. Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel
[1:08:01] chapter 36.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 36.
[1:08:19] And we're going to start at verse 16.
[1:08:23] And if you read this story, you know
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:27] Ezekiel is uh caught up in a vision and
[1:08:30] God is God is telling him what he going
[1:08:32] to do, prophesying what he going to do,
[1:08:33] telling him what and he first started
[1:08:35] out, he was prophesying what he was
[1:08:37] going to do to the land.
[1:08:39] So, and then when he get down to verse
[1:08:41] 16, he start talking about the about his
[1:08:44] people. Start to talk about his people.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And verse 16
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; says, "Moreover, the word of the Lord
[1:08:52] came unto me, saying,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; "Son of man, when the house of Israel
[1:08:57] dwelt in their own land,
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; they defiled it by their own way."
[1:09:01] Right?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "And by their doings," he said,
[1:09:04] "Their way was before me as the
[1:09:07] uncleanness of a removed woman."
[1:09:11] So there was their way was very unclean
[1:09:14] to him.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wherefore I poured my fury
[1:09:17] upon them for the blood that they have
[1:09:19] shed upon the land and for the idols
[1:09:22] where wherewith they had polluted it."
[1:09:25] And he says in verse 19, he says, "And I
[1:09:28] scattered them among the heathen."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; "And they were dispersed through the
[1:09:32] countries according to their way and
[1:09:34] according to their doings, I judge
[1:09:36] them."
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 20 say, "And when they enter into
[1:09:41] the heathen where they went, they
[1:09:44] profane my holy name." So they basically
[1:09:47] disrespected. Profing to disrespect my
[1:09:50] holy name. when they when they said when
[1:09:53] they said to them, "These are the people
[1:09:55] of the Lord and are gone forth out of
[1:09:58] his land."
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; So God beginning to realize that
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; he had caused them to go amongst the
[1:10:04] heathen,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; But now that they are out there, the the
[1:10:08] the the heathens are beginning to look
[1:10:10] at his people
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and and say, "Are these the people of
[1:10:14] God?"
[1:10:15] And and God are realizing that, okay,
[1:10:17] they're they're in a bad place right
[1:10:18] now, but most of all, it's making him
[1:10:20] look bad.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; It's making him look bad.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I had pity for my holy
[1:10:26] name."
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; So he had pity for his name,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; which the house of Israel had profained
[1:10:31] among the heathen where they went. Verse
[1:10:35] 22 says, "Therefore say unto the house
[1:10:37] of Israel, thus sayith the Lord God, I
[1:10:40] do not this for your sakes,
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; oh house of Israel, but for my holy
[1:10:46] name's sake,
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; which you have profained among the
[1:10:49] heathen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Whether you went."
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; So he telling you what I'm getting ready
[1:10:53] to do is is for me.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't even got nothing to do
[1:10:56] with you.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to do this for me.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; So I want you to I want you to pay close
[1:11:01] attention what is what he getting ready
[1:11:03] to do.
[1:11:04] He says, "And I will sanctify my great
[1:11:07] name."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; "Which was profained among the heathen."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Which you have profained in the midst of
[1:11:13] them, and the heathen shall know that I
[1:11:16] am the Lord. That's right.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Say the Lord God, when I shall be
[1:11:19] sanctified in you before their eyes.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; So God is saying, I'm going to do a work
[1:11:25] in you.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; In this condition, I'm going to do a
[1:11:29] work in you. So they going to know that
[1:11:31] even though they thinking this type of
[1:11:33] way, they going to know that I am still
[1:11:35] the Lord our God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; So that's how God has done you and me.
[1:11:38] We have came in this world as sinners,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; you know, speaking lies or whatever in
[1:11:44] in a messed up condition. But God said
[1:11:46] that he was going to put his spirit in
[1:11:48] us and he was going to show the world
[1:11:49] that that's my child, that's my son,
[1:11:53] that's my daughter before the foundation
[1:11:54] of the world. And I'm going to make them
[1:11:56] come to that.
[1:11:58] Don't go to make them come to that.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. What? Watch where he starts
[1:12:04] out. He said, "Then will I sprinkle
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; clean water upon you."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; This is how he start the process. He
[1:12:11] going to clean. He going to clean them
[1:12:12] up.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will sprinkle clean water
[1:12:15] upon you and ye shall be clean."
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "From all your filthiness
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and from all your idols will I cleanse
[1:12:22] you."
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. In verse 26, he says, "A
[1:12:26] new heart,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; also will I give you."
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And a new spirit
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; will I put within you.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; He say, "And I will take away the stony
[1:12:37] heart
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; out of your flesh, and I will give you
[1:12:40] an heart of flesh."
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And then verse 27 says, "And I will put
[1:12:45] my spirit Yes, sir.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; within you,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and cause you to walk in my statutes,
[1:12:51] sir. and you shall keep my judgments and
[1:12:53] do them.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, they they didn't ask for
[1:13:00] this.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Now, what I want you to catch that or
[1:13:03] not, they did not ask for this
[1:13:05] cleansing.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; They did not ask for their heart to be
[1:13:08] changed. They did not ask for a new
[1:13:10] spirit. They did not ask for him to put
[1:13:12] his spirit inside that new spirit. But
[1:13:15] God knew that that were his people and
[1:13:17] he was not going to let them be lost. So
[1:13:19] he made a decision to bring them to that
[1:13:21] condition.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 29, he said, "I will also save you
[1:13:29] from all your uncleanness,
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; and I will call for the corn and will
[1:13:33] increase it."
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And lay no famine upon you.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I will multiply the fruit
[1:13:38] of the tree,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; And the increase of the field, sir.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That you shall shall receive no more
[1:13:44] reproach
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; or famine among the heathen.
[1:13:49] He say, "Then shall you remember your
[1:13:52] own evil ways
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; and your doings that were not good,
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and shall load yourselves into your own
[1:13:58] sight, for your iniquities, and for your
[1:14:01] abominations."
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He say, "Not for your sakes.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Do I do I this, say the Lord God, be it
[1:14:08] known unto you, be ashamed and
[1:14:10] confounded for your own ways, oh house
[1:14:13] of Israel."
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So, let's look at this. Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; He says not for them, but for his sake,
[1:14:25] for his for his name's sake.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to
[1:14:36] let's turn to the
[1:14:40] one second here.
[1:14:52] to see the devil is trying to mess with
[1:14:53] my tablet. Okay. And you might as well
[1:14:56] get off it.
[1:14:58] Amen.
[1:15:01] So when the message question and answer
[1:15:03] number four
[1:15:05] in 1964
[1:15:08] is a they asked brother Bren a question,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; right? And they said, "Dear brother
[1:15:12] Brandon, what is the difference
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; when Jesus breathed on the disciples and
[1:15:17] said,
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." That's it.
[1:15:20] Yes, sir.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "And when they had to go up to
[1:15:22] the upper room to cherry it,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it was a promise."
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; He gave them.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; He breathed upon them his promise.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; He said it was a promise.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He said they went to the upper room to
[1:15:39] wait.
[1:15:41] See, they went to the upper room to wait
[1:15:43] for the promise
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "The same thing is when we lay
[1:15:48] hands upon you
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; to be healed."
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then you go on about your
[1:15:53] business
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; waiting for the promise to be
[1:15:56] fulfilled."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't see attributes of the
[1:16:01] Holy Ghost, you just tar. You wait on
[1:16:04] the promise.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He said the promise is given to you. And
[1:16:08] he said, "Wait on it." And I want I want
[1:16:10] to use the board tonight
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; if it's okay.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; I want to use the board.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; First, I want to I want you to get this
[1:16:35] process.
[1:16:36] He said the first thing he that he told
[1:16:38] in Ezekiel when he started dealing with
[1:16:40] with his people, he said, "I'm going to
[1:16:42] give you a new heart."
[1:16:54] And number two, the second thing he
[1:16:56] says, "I'm going to give you a new
[1:16:58] spirit."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Now, this this spirit is not his spirit
[1:17:02] is what he talking about. He said, "I'm
[1:17:04] going to give you a new spirit." Yes
[1:17:05] sir.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; So ba basically he's not going to take
[1:17:08] away your old nature but he's going to
[1:17:09] revive it.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? He going he
[1:17:12] going to give you a new spirit.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And the last thing he says
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; he's going to give you his spirit.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He's going to put his spirit.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] in I put in the in in in the middle
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; of the new spirit.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; So first God is going to deal with your
[1:17:52] heart.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; This this is when this is when you feel
[1:18:00] that pull. God start dealing with your
[1:18:02] heart and you start feeling that pull
[1:18:04] and and and you start to feel things you
[1:18:06] don't know where they came from, you
[1:18:08] know, and and and I can tell my
[1:18:09] testimony. I was out in the world and
[1:18:12] and all of a sudden this pull came upon
[1:18:14] me and and I decided I would go go and
[1:18:17] see
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; and I heard about the message and and
[1:18:19] and I was witnessed to but I couldn't
[1:18:21] come until God started dealing with my
[1:18:23] heart. That's right.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And he began to deal with my heart and I
[1:18:26] and I just and it dropped in my heart
[1:18:27] and I was like, you know what? I'm going
[1:18:28] to go Sunday morning. and I'm going to
[1:18:30] go check this church out.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And I went and then I went on from
[1:18:34] there. He gave me a new spirit.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But Bam say that new spirit he gives you
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; because you can't even get along with
[1:18:43] the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; He said without that new spirit, you
[1:18:47] can't even get along with the spirit of
[1:18:49] God.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; So God has to change your nature.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; He has to change the way you think.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; He has to change the way you look at
[1:18:57] things. So that's why he changes your
[1:19:00] your spirit and give you a new spirit
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; so that you can agree with his spirit.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So when the Holy Ghost try to lead and
[1:19:08] guide you,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; you won't fight against the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; You agree not the Holy Spirit because
[1:19:15] when you don't your natural spirit will
[1:19:18] not agree with the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost is a promise tonight.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And and and everything in the scripture,
[1:19:36] every scripture is a promise to me and
[1:19:38] you tonight.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Healing is a promise to me.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; So, all I got to do is wait on it.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Take him at his word and wait on it.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Take him at his word and wait on it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; God bless.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] In 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17, the
[1:20:01] Bible say, "Therefore, if any man be in
[1:20:04] Christ, he is a new creature."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And old things are passed away and all
[1:20:10] things are become new.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:16] And let's go to the
[1:20:19] uh book of Samuel
[1:20:22] chapter 10
[1:20:25] verse 6. Chapter 10 verse 6.
[1:20:31] When you find it, just say amen.
[1:20:44] And and and this is when the prophet
[1:20:47] Samuel would then begin to deal with
[1:20:49] King Saul. That's right.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And and and when when they they asked
[1:20:53] for a king and God gave it to him. Yes,
[1:20:55] sir.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; So God couldn't just send Saul in his
[1:20:58] condition the way he was.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; So just to show you that God starts
[1:21:02] dealing with the heart.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; In in verse six, he says, "And the he
[1:21:06] was telling Saul what was going to
[1:21:08] happen."
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he was telling you,
[1:21:10] saying, "And the spirit of the Lord will
[1:21:11] come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy
[1:21:13] with them, and shall be turned into
[1:21:16] another man."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; So he was telling Saul, you going to
[1:21:19] receive a new spirit.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; In verse seven, he said, "And let it be
[1:21:24] when these signs are come unto thee,
[1:21:27] that thou do as occasion as occasion
[1:21:29] serve thee, for God is with thee."
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. In verse eight, he said,
[1:21:33] "And thou shalt go down before me to
[1:21:35] Gilgal, and behold, I will come down
[1:21:37] unto thee to offer burnt offerings, and
[1:21:40] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace
[1:21:43] offerings, seven days shall thou tar
[1:21:45] till I come to thee, and show thee what
[1:21:47] thou shalt do." And verse 9 say, "And it
[1:21:50] was so that when he had turned his back
[1:21:54] to go from Samuel,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; God gave him another heart."
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And all those signs came to pass that
[1:22:01] day. Yes, sir.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; See, he gave him he gave him another
[1:22:04] heart first.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Because the prophecy hadn't been
[1:22:07] fulfilled yet.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He gave him another heart.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And the message, why some people can't
[1:22:13] keep the victory.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Why some people can't keep the victory.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; In 1957,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Paragraph 50.
[1:22:28] He says, "Yes, that's what we need today
[1:22:30] is experiences of the new birth."
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to watch the order
[1:22:34] that Ezekiel brought it in."
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will give you a new heart."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And I'll give you a new spirit.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; And I'll put my spirit in you.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to watch. There's
[1:22:45] three of it."
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; A new heart.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I'll take the old stony heart away.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's the old different heart you have.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He's saying I'll give you a
[1:22:54] new spirit.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Now many time and there's been a
[1:22:58] terrible mistake.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; The people has thought sometimes that
[1:23:01] the new spirit was the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; He said but it isn't.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It's a new spirit.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He said God gives you a new spirit.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; He said why you couldn't even get along
[1:23:14] with yourself
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; with your old spirit.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He said how you going to get along with
[1:23:18] the Holy Ghost?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He said God had to give you a new
[1:23:22] spirit. so you could get along with his
[1:23:24] spirit.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "And sometimes people a new
[1:23:27] heart of flesh so you will receive it."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then a new spirit in that in
[1:23:32] their heart
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; and then I'll put my spirit in that."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You see, he said new heart,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; new spirit.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And my spirit,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; three things he spoke of.
[1:23:44] He said, "Now many times we try to make
[1:23:46] that thing just say, "Well, as soon as
[1:23:49] you get the new spirit, you quit your
[1:23:51] stealing." He said, "You'll quit your
[1:23:53] lying."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Things like that.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, hallelujah. I got it."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "You found out the first time
[1:24:01] anyone crosses your path a little bit,
[1:24:04] oh mercy, what a difference.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Sure, you blow up like a frog eating
[1:24:08] buckshot." He said, "But let me tell
[1:24:10] you, brother,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; that's the reason you never got God's
[1:24:13] spirit."
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true." Oh, you say he
[1:24:16] stepped on my toe. I just I'll just not
[1:24:19] put up with that.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; All right. That shows what you got in
[1:24:22] you.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true. I put a new
[1:24:24] spirit in you
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and then I put my spirit in you."
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, the heart is in the
[1:24:30] center of the emotions, sir,
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; of the human being."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your heart is the middle of
[1:24:35] you."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He said, "So God
[1:24:38] puts a new heart in the middle of the
[1:24:40] old man.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Then he puts a new spirit in the middle
[1:24:43] of the new spirit."
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And then he puts his spirit in the
[1:24:46] middle of that new spirit.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now it's all just exactly like
[1:24:50] the main screen in a famous watch."
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ber going to use a watch to
[1:24:56] to show to show you how this how this
[1:24:58] connect.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; He said he said it's just exactly like
[1:25:02] the main screen in a famous watch. He
[1:25:04] said they got a little click over here
[1:25:06] working, a little click over here
[1:25:08] working. He said it's little wheels are
[1:25:11] turning. He said but it's all controlled
[1:25:12] by the main screen
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; that you could have. He said the trouble
[1:25:16] of it today we left off the main screen
[1:25:19] brother. He said we try to make
[1:25:21] ourselves Methodist, Baptist,
[1:25:23] Presbyterian and build great churches.
[1:25:25] Say look here what a fine watch I got.
[1:25:28] He said look at what a fine stem is got
[1:25:31] on it. Look at the face out of it. He
[1:25:34] said it's got rubies in it. It got
[1:25:36] jewels in it. He said it isn't it isn't
[1:25:38] worth a dime if it don't keep time.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; He said it isn't worth a dime if it
[1:25:45] don't keep time.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; He said that what's the matter today? He
[1:25:49] said we try to make that Methodist and
[1:25:52] the Baptist trying to make the Baptist
[1:25:53] and the Presbyterians and the
[1:25:55] Pentecostals and we try to get the
[1:25:57] prettiest church, the best pastor and
[1:25:59] the smartest man and everything. And our
[1:26:01] church just don't keep time with God's
[1:26:03] Bible.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's the matter."
[1:26:06] See,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; you left off his spirit.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hasn't Jesus said, have you
[1:26:11] heard that the stone that the builders
[1:26:14] rejected has become the chief of the
[1:26:16] corner?" That's right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Certainly the main screen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; He say now when the main screen is in
[1:26:23] the watch,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; not a self- winding, it's a God winding
[1:26:27] watch. He said the only thing you do to
[1:26:29] a self- winding watch, the only way you
[1:26:32] do is your emotions with the watch is
[1:26:34] what it is what winds it your emotions.
[1:26:36] He said your emotions towards the word
[1:26:38] of God is what winds you up with the
[1:26:40] Holy Ghost.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; He said if you're taking God's word,
[1:26:43] there it is that new watch. He said now
[1:26:46] you know Ezekiel saw it again
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; and he this same prophet he saw it as a
[1:26:51] wheel in the middle of a wheel.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Turning up in the air. Now the will he
[1:26:56] say first there is a
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; real
[1:27:01] sir
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I can get
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; you say first there there's a will
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; he said first there's a rim the he said
[1:27:19] the tire then the rim
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; then the spokes
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; and then the hub.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's it. He said, "Now when Luther
[1:27:25] started,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; they just they just shall live by faith,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; justification."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Say he bought the tire around it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He bought the tire around it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; So this
[1:27:41] going, we're going to make it live.
[1:27:49] The tire,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; they all play their part.
[1:27:54] He said he put the tire on it. He said
[1:27:56] yes. All right. He said wasn't much of a
[1:27:58] will yet.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He said all right there. Here come along
[1:28:01] the Methodist with sanctification.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Put the tire on it and then in the rim
[1:28:05] around it.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; So we you see the rim and the tire.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; He say and then along come Pentecost
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; and they taught sanctification. He said
[1:28:15] the Luther or the Methodist. The Luther
[1:28:17] taught justification which was a tie on
[1:28:19] the outside.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said the rim then was
[1:28:22] the Methodist with with sanctification
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and the Pentecostals come along and they
[1:28:27] put a spoke in it
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; speaking in tongues.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Now he didn't he didn't say they put all
[1:28:34] the spokes in it. He said they put a
[1:28:36] spoke in it.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; They put one spoke in it.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; So evidence speaking in tongues was all
[1:28:46] they needed to see. So basically what he
[1:28:48] was saying, long they spoke in tongues,
[1:28:49] they believe they had it.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; That's not enough.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Well, let me tell
[1:28:59] you, brother,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; it don't consist just of that.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we're we're lumping,
[1:29:05] bumping down the road the way we are."
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's not one spoken there,
[1:29:09] but there's nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:29:12] church, not just one." He said, he say
[1:29:16] all them's all right. The tire all
[1:29:18] right. The rim is all right. The spokes
[1:29:21] all right. But he said but like the
[1:29:23] colored man eating the watermelon. He
[1:29:24] said there's more of it.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He said that's what I mean today.
[1:29:29] There's more of it. There's nine
[1:29:31] spiritual spokes in this wheel and it's
[1:29:33] turned by the wheel in the middle of a
[1:29:35] wheel
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; all connected with the hub.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:29:42] And I wonder I I used to ponder I said
[1:29:44] what do Ezekiel mean when he say he saw
[1:29:46] him as a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So what Ezekiel was saying is here
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Christ is that hub
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; and it ain't just speaking in tongues
[1:29:57] but all nine spiritual gifts.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Connects that hub to the rim.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; To the tire
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; and Christ is in the middle and he
[1:30:06] controls all the spiritual gifts.
[1:30:10] That's accept.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; So that's why they can impersonate the
[1:30:14] gifts.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; They can impersonate the speaking in
[1:30:17] tongues. They can impersonate
[1:30:19] prophesying. They can do all these
[1:30:20] things. But they don't have Christ the
[1:30:22] hub in the middle.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; And that will separate us from them
[1:30:26] because we got to live life
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; and not just a spiritual gift, but we
[1:30:30] have a life that we can live. We have
[1:30:32] something that can stop us when we get
[1:30:34] ready to do wrong. We got something that
[1:30:36] can control our eyes when we looking at
[1:30:38] the wrong things. We got something that
[1:30:40] can make us repent when we do wrong.
[1:30:43] That's the piece that they're missing.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, brother.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; The good thing, no matter what we're
[1:30:55] doing,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; how you're doing it,
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; you're fighting the air because God done
[1:31:00] said, "I will restore, say the Lord."
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; It's got to come. He said, "Now, the hub
[1:31:06] is where it all turns from."
[1:31:08] in the main screen where all the watch
[1:31:10] works from. He said the main screen it
[1:31:12] ticks he said ticks it right up keeps
[1:31:15] every blessing just exactly where it's
[1:31:18] supposed to be.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; He said now these gifts your gifts of
[1:31:22] tongues wonderful. He said just
[1:31:24] justification by faith wonderful.
[1:31:26] Sanctification fine speaking in tongues
[1:31:29] wonderful interpretation fine. Messages
[1:31:32] from God wonderful. He says prophecy
[1:31:35] fine. He said, "Brother, if it hasn't
[1:31:38] got no hub in it,"
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; he said, "What's it going to amount to?"
[1:31:42] He said, "Your spokes will get all
[1:31:43] crossed up with one another.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; They'll cross up, fuss, fight, isolate,
[1:31:48] and ch and tear up on each other." He
[1:31:50] said, "That's what's the matter. We need
[1:31:52] the main screen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; What God does is do to have the little
[1:31:56] bitty springs and the little bitty
[1:31:58] gadgets in here and the winding springs
[1:32:00] and the alarms and the faces and the big
[1:32:02] hands and all these things." He's saying
[1:32:04] there isn't something in there to make
[1:32:05] it operate.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; He said if there isn't something in
[1:32:08] there to make it operate, what good is
[1:32:11] to have it?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; What good is to have the spiritual
[1:32:14] gifts? What what's good to be able to do
[1:32:16] all those things and you don't have the
[1:32:18] you don't have the hub?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; You don't have the Holy Spirit on the
[1:32:21] inside that tells you how to use these
[1:32:23] things, how to control these things.
[1:32:28] He said, "I believe the Pentecostal
[1:32:30] church has got the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:32] Ghost." He said, "I believe the rest of
[1:32:34] you do too that claim it." He said, "I
[1:32:37] believe you speaking in tongues is
[1:32:38] right." He said, "I believe that your
[1:32:40] prophecy is right." He said, "I'll go
[1:32:41] with you." He said, "I'll go with you on
[1:32:43] being a Baptist." I believe it. He He's
[1:32:46] saying he agree with that. Sure, I do.
[1:32:48] He said, "But here's one thing,
[1:32:50] brother." He said, "It's not it's not
[1:32:52] keeping the right kind of time." That's
[1:32:55] what I'm trying to say. So it take the
[1:32:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost to come into
[1:33:00] that human heart there to make the thing
[1:33:02] run right.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He said the love of God, God is love.
[1:33:07] And unless each one of these gift is put
[1:33:09] right in the center of love,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; it becomes selfish and indifferent.
[1:33:13] That's right.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And pull itself off and isolate itself
[1:33:16] and cross over and fuss and stew. He
[1:33:18] said, but when it's anchored right into
[1:33:20] the middle of love,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; it'll fellowship anywhere.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; It'll fellowship everywhere. And that's
[1:33:25] right. That's exactly what we need. The
[1:33:27] church is dying for love, brother.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Now, Ezekiel
[1:33:36] says this, and brother Brenham put this
[1:33:38] in the personation of Christianity.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; In paragraph 45, he says, he says, "Now
[1:33:44] the new heart
[1:33:46] does not mean work up the old one."
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Doesn't mean that the
[1:33:52] church need a facelifting." He said it
[1:33:54] mean that the church needs a birth.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; He said God's church don't need a
[1:33:58] polishing. It needs a conversion.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; He said that's right. That's just to
[1:34:02] take the old church and and set say well
[1:34:05] I tell you we'll change the deacon
[1:34:06] board. We'll swap the pastor. He say
[1:34:08] that isn't what the church needs. It
[1:34:10] leads to baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; It leads to power of the living God.
[1:34:15] Yes, sir.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; He said a revival doesn't mean to go out
[1:34:18] and get new members. He said a revival
[1:34:20] means to revive that what you already
[1:34:23] got.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; So denomination think revivals is to go
[1:34:29] out and pull in members. But the true
[1:34:31] meaning of revive is to take what you
[1:34:33] already have
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; and revive it.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Take that spirit you already have and
[1:34:39] revive it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Take that Holy Ghost you already got and
[1:34:42] refill it.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something new.
[1:34:46] We're going to take what you already got
[1:34:47] and revive it.
[1:34:53] Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; In paragraph 194,
[1:35:03] impersonation of Christianity.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And he says in and father we are tired
[1:35:08] of impersonation of Christian life.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; He said create in us Lord today a new
[1:35:13] heart.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; A new spirit.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. and put your spirit according
[1:35:18] to your prophet's word.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; In the middle of our new spirit. Yes,
[1:35:22] sir.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And control us by love. Yes,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; joy, peace, sir.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Longsuffering, goodness, gentleness,
[1:35:30] patience,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; and faith, and all the fruits of the
[1:35:34] spirit may be found in us. Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; As we humbly yield ourselves, our souls,
[1:35:39] the innermost part, the life that brings
[1:35:41] all this earthly calcium and petroleum
[1:35:44] together and holds it dust, when it
[1:35:46] leaves, we go back to the dust. He said,
[1:35:48] "And we yield our spirit." He said, "We
[1:35:50] yield them to you
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and create in us the right kind of
[1:35:53] spirit and let the Holy Spirit, the
[1:35:55] spirit control us and lead us and guide
[1:35:57] us as we journey on."
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, God keeps his word
[1:36:07] in 1957 paragraph 212.
[1:36:11] He says, "Now, won't you sweetly,
[1:36:13] father, move on into their heart." He
[1:36:16] said, "Put your spirit in their new
[1:36:18] spirit." He said, "You had to give them
[1:36:20] a new spirit." I want you to catch this.
[1:36:23] He said, "You had to give them a new
[1:36:25] spirit or they would never held their
[1:36:27] hand."
[1:36:29] So, it it even takes that new spirit for
[1:36:31] you to be able to just lift your hands.
[1:36:35] That's how important that new spirit is.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; It takes a new spirit for you to just
[1:36:40] lift your hands.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Now you see how important it is for that
[1:36:43] new spirit to help you agree
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He said he said you had to give them a
[1:36:52] new spirit or they would never held
[1:36:54] their hand.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; He said they wouldn't have desired it.
[1:36:57] So the new spirit that new spirit brings
[1:36:59] the desire.
[1:37:01] He said, "But they went down to the
[1:37:03] potter's house and they let you change
[1:37:05] their emotions and their ideas,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and now in their heart they're being
[1:37:09] tender." He said, "And you said, no man
[1:37:11] can come to me except my father draws
[1:37:14] him." They could not have raised their
[1:37:16] hands from the youngest to the oldest
[1:37:19] unless you had told them to do it.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "They did it because you spoke
[1:37:23] to them." That's right.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And it's God giving them to Christ as a
[1:37:27] love gift.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; They have yielded their heart. Amen.
[1:37:31] Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; So they have yielded their heart and had
[1:37:33] a had a heart change. God have changed
[1:37:35] your heart.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Then that new spirit begin to work on
[1:37:38] you.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And then you become you become the
[1:37:41] church and then you be come to search
[1:37:42] for something that there's nothing left
[1:37:44] but the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And you begin to search for something
[1:37:47] and you know something missing
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; and and you and you can't figure it out.
[1:37:50] You're like I know it's something else.
[1:37:52] It's more to this. I I I spoke in
[1:37:54] tongues and I I can feel the pull and I
[1:37:57] can feel the urge when I'm inside the
[1:37:59] sanctuary. But it's more to this. It's
[1:38:01] like I need something that can control
[1:38:03] my life.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I need something that can help me love
[1:38:08] my neighbor. I need something that can
[1:38:11] help me love every brother and sister
[1:38:12] here on the same wave. And that's what
[1:38:15] the Holy Spirit does. It do things that
[1:38:17] you can't do yourself.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; It makes you live a life that you can't
[1:38:22] live yourself. You can't impersonate the
[1:38:25] Holy Spirit.
[1:38:29] He says in paragraph 214, he said, "And
[1:38:32] we can hear your great voice say, he
[1:38:35] that hearth my word,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; not your church, your church has your
[1:38:40] word, and it isn't contrary to your
[1:38:42] word." He said, "But he that hearth my
[1:38:44] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:38:47] have everlasting life
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; and shall not come into judgment, but
[1:38:51] has passed from death unto life."
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] And the message said, "What does it take
[1:38:57] to make a Christian life?" Yes, sir.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; He says in paragraph 35, "The Holy
[1:39:02] Spirit will make every movement like
[1:39:04] Christ."
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Not one movement. The Holy Ghost will
[1:39:09] make every movement like Christ.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Listen at this. It'll make you
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Christlike.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; It ain't It ain't going to ask you, "Do
[1:39:21] you want to be Christlike?" It will make
[1:39:23] you
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Christlike.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; He said all the fruits of the spirit. He
[1:39:29] said those things are what the Holy
[1:39:30] Spirit controls our emotions. He said
[1:39:34] our emotion emotions is not so much as
[1:39:36] jumping up and down. You could do that.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; He said he said a sheen did will bring
[1:39:41] that to you. He said, "But the Holy
[1:39:43] Spirit brings you into operation
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; or in control of God. That you walk in
[1:39:47] peace,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; that you walk in love,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and joy with long suffering
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; and and all the spiritual gifts." You
[1:39:54] see, it isn't something that you do.
[1:39:56] It's something the Holy Spirit does in
[1:39:58] you.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; See, you you see, it's no longer an
[1:40:02] intellectual thought of your own. It's a
[1:40:05] subconscious movement of the Holy
[1:40:06] Spirit.
[1:40:07] Oh, I wish I could shout the praises of
[1:40:10] God around the world to that.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "Church of the living God,
[1:40:14] that's where our Pentecostal move fail."
[1:40:16] He said, "We have some man-made musical
[1:40:19] clap hands, jump up and down emotion."
[1:40:21] He said, "When if we go back out on the
[1:40:24] street and the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:40:25] govern our lives to cooperate with that,
[1:40:29] we have not got the Holy Spirit."
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; That's not ski milk. He says, he said,
[1:40:34] "But brother, that's what the church
[1:40:35] needs.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Only life can come by the Holy Spirit."
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; So he's saying, "Don't be amazed that
[1:40:42] you can do these things." He said, "But
[1:40:44] when you walk out and you don't see
[1:40:46] yourself manifesting or lining up with
[1:40:48] this word," he said, then you need to
[1:40:50] take inventory. You need to check
[1:40:52] yourself. And there's nothing wrong with
[1:40:54] if you coming up short with something,
[1:40:56] you just got to recognize it and then
[1:40:58] you got to call out. You got to cry out
[1:41:00] for whatever it is you need. There's
[1:41:02] nothing wrong with crying out if you re
[1:41:05] first you got to recognize you need help
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; first you got to recognize you need help
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; so you can't you can't see that you need
[1:41:15] help and sit there and think that God is
[1:41:18] just going to come along and find you
[1:41:20] and just give you what you want God say
[1:41:22] you got to cry out you got to cry out
[1:41:26] for the things that you need
[1:41:29] to cry out for healing you you You are
[1:41:32] healed by his stripes. But God want you
[1:41:34] to cry out for
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; it.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; In the book of Psalms. Turn to the book
[1:41:45] of Psalms, chapter 51,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; verse 10.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 10.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You got it. Say amen. Verse 10 says,
[1:42:01] "Create in me
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; a clean heart, oh God,
[1:42:06] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:42:10] Cast me not away from thy presence,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; and take not thy holy spirit from me."
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:42:19] salvation
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; and uphold me with thy free spirit."
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So he these are requests. He said, "Then
[1:42:28] will," He said, "Then will I teach
[1:42:30] transgressors thy ways, and sinners
[1:42:32] shall be converted to thee."
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; So, what what what he's saying is, I
[1:42:38] want you to work on me
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; first.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; This is this is his petition. I want you
[1:42:44] to clean me up first.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; So, what he's saying right there, I
[1:42:47] can't help nobody,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; God, until you fix me.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying right there. He
[1:42:54] said, he said, "If you clean me up,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; if if you give me a clean heart, oh God,
[1:42:59] and if you renew the rot spirit within
[1:43:01] me,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; and you cast not away from thy cast me
[1:43:04] not away from thy presence,
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and take not the Holy Spirit from me,"
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; and he's saying, "And if you restore
[1:43:10] unto me that joy
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; of the salvation salvation." So, he
[1:43:15] realized that he lost that joy.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And not only did he realize that he lost
[1:43:19] it, but he realized that he had to have
[1:43:20] it. that he couldn't help nobody else
[1:43:23] with it. If he didn't have joy, how you
[1:43:24] going to help somebody else?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; How I'm going to preach to you joy and
[1:43:28] if I don't have joy?
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; How I'm going to preach to you healing
[1:43:31] if I don't believe in healing?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And that's that is what he's saying. I
[1:43:35] got to believe this. I got to have this
[1:43:37] before I can bring it to you.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; He said, when you give me these things,
[1:43:43] he said, then I will teach transgressors
[1:43:45] thy ways.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And then he says, and and what's going
[1:43:48] to come out of this? Sinners shall be
[1:43:50] converted unto thee.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Sinners shall be converted
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; unto thee.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; So he he's tell he's telling you that
[1:43:59] once you fix me, then you're going to be
[1:44:03] pleased with the results.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He say, "Now I can go out and do your
[1:44:07] work.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I can go I can go out and witness for
[1:44:10] you.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Now you can give me the right words to
[1:44:13] say because all things are lining up."
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:20] But he recognized that he didn't have
[1:44:23] what he needed.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to do tonight. We
[1:44:26] got to recognize
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; where we at tonight.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; In the in the book of Isaiah chapter 6
[1:44:33] verse 5,
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Isaiah says this in chapter um 6 verse
[1:44:37] 5.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; He says then said I wo
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; is me.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; He say for I am undone.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I am. He said, "Because I am a man of
[1:44:48] unclean lips."
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I dwell in the midst of a
[1:44:52] people of unclean lips."
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "For my eyes have seen the
[1:44:57] king, the Lord of hosts."
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; So Isaiah begin to cry out.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He begin He begins to speak out and say,
[1:45:04] "I am a man of unclean lips."
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And not only am I unclean, Isaiah
[1:45:09] testifying that. And I'm looking around
[1:45:11] and everything around me is unclean,
[1:45:12] Lord.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I need you to clean me
[1:45:15] up." Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; So this first you got to cry out then
[1:45:20] the cry the cry come first
[1:45:23] and in the message things that are to be
[1:45:25] in 1965
[1:45:28] in paragraph 77 brother Brandon says now
[1:45:30] think
[1:45:32] if God in his mercy has the mother
[1:45:35] before the little baby is born is
[1:45:38] craving for some vitamin and the mother
[1:45:40] word speaks for a dad I want cantaloupe
[1:45:43] or watermelon he say I want something or
[1:45:45] mother. He says he'll do everything he
[1:45:48] can to get that.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He said because he knows that he wants
[1:45:52] his child born as perfect as he can be.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; You see, he said and he'll do everything
[1:45:57] that he's able to do to get it.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; He says how much more able he is to get
[1:46:03] it. He's a creator.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Now, think how able he is to prepare us
[1:46:08] a body.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; To live like his own glorious body. If
[1:46:12] we want to live, there is something in
[1:46:14] us calls us to live.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And there is something in us that calls
[1:46:18] us to do right.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Then God will cause somebody on the
[1:46:21] platform or the pull pit that will
[1:46:23] preach the absolute truth.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; He say, "Why?" See, it shows you then if
[1:46:28] you a real child of God, you begin to
[1:46:30] cry out,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; "God, take it away from me.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Circumcise me from this. Take these
[1:46:37] things away from me." Why? It's needed
[1:46:39] for your heavenly home that you're going
[1:46:40] to. He's saying where he's going to
[1:46:43] prepare, you got to be a real word bride
[1:46:46] of Christ.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; And see, when you got that Holy Spirit
[1:46:48] in you, you begin to take inventory
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; and you begin to look over your life and
[1:46:52] you begin to see where you coming up
[1:46:54] short.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And when the minister begin to preach
[1:46:56] and minister to your heart and when God
[1:46:58] speaks to you,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; then you the Holy Ghost in you will
[1:47:01] speak back to the word. And when you see
[1:47:03] that, you are missing these things that
[1:47:06] I that I'm coming up short. It could be
[1:47:07] something simple as I not I don't study
[1:47:09] the word enough. I don't read my Bible
[1:47:12] enough. It could be something just as
[1:47:14] simple as that. But when it's spoken to
[1:47:16] you, you're supposed to cry out. Say,
[1:47:17] "Lord, that's me.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That's me tonight. Wherever you falling
[1:47:22] short, you got to cry out." And God
[1:47:24] loves for you to cry out.
[1:47:30] But it takes that Holy Spirit to cry
[1:47:32] out.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And the choosing of a bride in 1965.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 240, he said, "Oh, Pentecost,
[1:47:43] run for your life."
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Flee to the horns of the altar
[1:47:47] and cry out."
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Before it's too late. He said, "For an
[1:47:50] hour will come when you can where you
[1:47:52] can cry and it'll do no good." That's
[1:47:55] right.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "For Esau sought to find a
[1:47:57] place
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; of his birthight and couldn't find it.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; I could," he said, "I commit you, oh
[1:48:02] California, oh convention of the full
[1:48:04] gospel businessman who I he said whom I
[1:48:07] love, whom I left and scrum to." He
[1:48:09] said, "With all my heart," he said, "I
[1:48:11] commit you to Jesus Christ tonight. Flee
[1:48:14] to him. Don't let the devil ever cool
[1:48:16] you off from this." He said, "Stay right
[1:48:20] with it until you everyone is filled
[1:48:22] with the Holy Ghost." in so much that
[1:48:25] will make you come to this word that
[1:48:27] will make you women straighten up and
[1:48:29] that will make you men straighten up.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; If you say you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:48:34] won't cope with the word, it's another
[1:48:36] spirit in you.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He said if you if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; and it won't cope with the word,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; he said it's another spirit in you.
[1:48:52] Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; He said God's spirit is God's spirit is
[1:48:56] on his word.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; So how can you have the Holy Spirit and
[1:49:00] then deny one word
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; and deny one word of his
[1:49:11] bride must be a messiah the anointed
[1:49:13] word
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; in the message a trial
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; in 1964.
[1:49:22] Paragraph 114, he said, "One of these
[1:49:24] days,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; men and women will cry out."
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll be too far, but too
[1:49:29] late."
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "The door will be closed."
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It will be that way."
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The virgins come and knocked
[1:49:35] on the door."
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And said, "Let us in."
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; He said they wanted to get some of the
[1:49:40] oil.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "But they ought to have got oil
[1:49:43] when oil was being given out."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He said they knocked on the door. It
[1:49:48] said, he said, "They will cast into
[1:49:49] outer darkness where there'll be weeping
[1:49:51] and whailing and nashing of teeth." He
[1:49:54] said, "I'm only trying to make that
[1:49:55] little sideline of the defense to the
[1:49:57] court now." Oh, the word. He He said,
[1:50:00] "You got to get the Holy Spirit. You got
[1:50:03] to get this Holy Spirit now while you
[1:50:04] got a chance."
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; In the message, Birth Pays.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In 1965,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; he says in paragraph 71, he says, "And
[1:50:21] that's the way that we get what we want
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; is cry for it."
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't be ashamed."
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed tonight.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; He say, "I'm hungering for God.
[1:50:35] Don't care whether the deacons,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; pastors,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; or whatever is around
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; say you scream out
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; anyhow.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He said the Jones are sitting there. He
[1:50:48] say what difference does it make?
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; He said cry out.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He said that's the only way that there
[1:50:55] is to get it.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; He said until you get help.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; He taught that when he was here on
[1:51:00] earth, you know about the unjust judge.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:51:05] So God, he telling you that how to get
[1:51:07] it. He said the only way you going to
[1:51:08] get it, you going to have to cry out for
[1:51:10] it.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to cry out for it.
[1:51:13] And you going to have to forget about
[1:51:14] who's around you.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You going to have to forget about your
[1:51:17] family.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to forget about your
[1:51:20] friends.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And you going to have to just get
[1:51:22] yourself behind the veil and just drop
[1:51:24] everything around you. And you going to
[1:51:26] have to cry out to God.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I see why I'm coming up
[1:51:30] short.
[1:51:32] Lord, I see why I'm failing you in your
[1:51:33] word, Lord. Lord, I see why I'm not
[1:51:36] lining up with your word. And you just
[1:51:38] got to block everything, God, and say,
[1:51:40] "Lord, I need something to keep me.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something to keep me.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something to scrape me out.
[1:51:47] I need you to take away these things
[1:51:48] that I can't get rid of."
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And see, and see, you would try over and
[1:51:55] over again to get rid of these things,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; but you're not able.
[1:51:59] sir,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; you're not able
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; and you and you and you may be free from
[1:52:04] it from that debt for that day, but it's
[1:52:06] coming back because you don't have what
[1:52:08] it take to control it. The Holy Spirit
[1:52:10] will forever guide you and lead you.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; In the message, Who is Jesus? 1964
[1:52:25] paragraph 112.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; He said if they hold their peace,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; the rocks will cry out immediately.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; He say something is going to cry out
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; when he is around.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He say something is going to cry out
[1:52:41] whenever he's around.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; So wherever the president of God is,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; something is going to cry out.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And God say if it don't cry out, he'll
[1:52:50] make the rocks cry out.
[1:52:53] He's going to get his praise.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Accepting God's provided way at the end
[1:53:07] time.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; 1963, paragraph 191.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's the way we're
[1:53:15] supposed to do."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I see a promise in the
[1:53:19] Bible,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; that's it. That's God's word.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I just stay there."
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I cry out
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; to God give it to me."
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; I cry out until God give it to me.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "And he do that.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Get you off his hands." You see,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; that will be in the natural, but wanting
[1:53:40] you to do it.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; He likes for you to ask.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; that your joys might be full.
[1:53:50] He say cry until his word is vindicated.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; God say he want you to cry out until you
[1:53:57] see that word living in you.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Don't you stop crying out until you can
[1:54:02] see that you can live this word. Don't
[1:54:05] you start crying out till you can walk
[1:54:06] right. Don't you start crying out till
[1:54:09] you can talk right. Don't you start
[1:54:11] crying out until you can love right.
[1:54:14] Don't you start crying out until you can
[1:54:15] live right. You cry out until you can do
[1:54:18] these things.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Don't give up tonight. You keep crying.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; You keep asking God.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; You keep pulling on God. You keep
[1:54:29] lifting your hands.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You keep yelling, "Hallelujah. You keep
[1:54:33] telling him, Lord, I need you, Lord. You
[1:54:35] keep calling on his name tonight." And
[1:54:38] you stay right there.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; You stay right there.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Stay right there until he come.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:54] He say cry out until the word is
[1:54:56] vindicated.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; So he telling you don't you be
[1:55:00] satisfied.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be satisfied until
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; you can see the word the full word
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; come in manifestation in full view. Not
[1:55:11] in my life but in your life.
[1:55:15] in your life
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; say the trouble of it is
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; he say he said we get a cookie and think
[1:55:30] that's all there is. He said he said
[1:55:33] there's a whole table full.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He said he said we got so we can speak
[1:55:38] in tongues. We say oh brother that's it.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Oh no. He said, "That ain't." He said,
[1:55:44] "That just some of it."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right." He said, "Oh, I
[1:55:49] got a happy enough to shout." He said,
[1:55:51] "That's some more of it." He said, "But
[1:55:53] there's a whole lot more of it." He
[1:55:55] said, "Just keep on crying out until
[1:56:01] Amen."
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; God said, "There's so there's so much
[1:56:08] more to it.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; So much more to it." Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; So much more to it.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; And I and I didn't know why God gave me
[1:56:22] this message, but I challenge you
[1:56:23] tonight.

[1:56:36] my hearts tonight.

[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; It's here.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; And and and it's here.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; And and and and God has promised that it
[1:56:54] can be given to you.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Even to your children.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; And your children's children.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to sit here in the
[1:57:01] message of the hour
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; and be short of anything.
[1:57:06] We don't have to sit here in the message
[1:57:08] of the hour
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; and come up short with anything in our
[1:57:11] lives.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't say we we wouldn't fall short.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't say we wouldn't come up short.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; But we in a position
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; and we have the Holy Spirit that we can
[1:57:21] recognize and all we got to do is cry
[1:57:24] out.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is is is is admit
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; that I have a problem.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. All we have to do
[1:57:35] is admit that I have a problem.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; And when we admit that we have that
[1:57:40] problem,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; whatever it is,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; God is obligated.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; He's obligated.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; He's obligated to come meet your needs.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Confess."
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And once you confess, he's obligated.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; It's on him. And if he don't, he's
[1:57:58] guilty.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; He's guilty.
[1:58:09] I don't know who I don't know. I'm
[1:58:11] pretty sure we have a lot of believers
[1:58:13] in here tonight that that possess the
[1:58:15] Holy Spirit. And I I I know this, but if
[1:58:19] if if it's one in here tonight, I I
[1:58:22] don't I don't know who it is. If it if
[1:58:24] it's just one, maybe an invisible
[1:58:26] artist, if there are one that's been
[1:58:28] seeking the Holy Spirit,
[1:58:39] It's here.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; It's here.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; My message to you tonight is you don't
[1:58:45] have to you don't have to be in that
[1:58:48] same condition. You don't have to be
[1:58:50] that way.
[1:58:52] There there's something here that can
[1:58:53] pull the things of the world straight
[1:58:55] out of you.
[1:58:57] You don't have to battle with the things
[1:58:58] of the world. We have something here
[1:59:01] stronger than the things of the world.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; We have we have something more powerful
[1:59:05] than the things of the world.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; And and and you don't have to keep these
[1:59:09] things. But I I just pray, oh God, that
[1:59:12] whoever this for tonight that that you
[1:59:14] have pricked their heart, that you have
[1:59:17] pricricked their heart and and and
[1:59:19] bought a change on this night and and
[1:59:20] and and the new spirit is beginning to
[1:59:22] come in
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; and and then there'll be testimonies
[1:59:25] that that you have put your spirit in
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; and they can testify and see, you know,
[1:59:29] I used to do this, but I I don't do this
[1:59:31] no more.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I used to go here, but I don't go there
[1:59:34] no more.
[1:59:36] I used to look at this, but I don't look
[1:59:38] at that no more. and and and that
[1:59:40] testimony will come forth that I have
[1:59:44] somebody in me that is greater than me.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; And and you can you can be a a walking
[1:59:50] testimony.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Just like he he cleaned Israel up. He
[1:59:55] did it in the midst of the heathen.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; God can clean you up in the midst of
[2:00:00] this darkness in this world.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; And when when you go out, you don't have
[2:00:04] to feel you don't have to feel guilty by
[2:00:05] saying, "I'm a Christian."
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I believe in the message
[2:00:08] of the hour because when you say that,
[2:00:10] your life will line up with it.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want tonight.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; We want to won't vindicate the word
[2:00:16] fully.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that this been a blessing to you
[2:00:20] tonight. Y'all put your hands together
[2:00:21] for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:00:42] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:00:45] Amen.
[2:00:47] God when he send his word
[2:00:50] the word will never return void to God
[2:00:54] until he have fulfilled that which he
[2:00:59] was sent for. The biggest mistake we can
[2:01:03] do right now is worry about our
[2:01:06] tomorrow,
[2:01:08] worry about our job, worry about our
[2:01:11] schooling and worry to rush
[2:01:16] And at the end, everything you're going
[2:01:18] to be working with for will be burned
[2:01:23] except the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:26] Amen. The biggest mistake you would do
[2:01:30] is to live tonight without taking any
[2:01:33] opportunity to pray. I know we have a
[2:01:37] tendency for me to pray for the
[2:01:39] congregation. I'm a pastor. I will pray
[2:01:42] for you. But before I pray, you need to
[2:01:44] cry out.
[2:01:46] Number one, you need to admit.
[2:01:50] Admit where you are. Once you admit,
[2:01:54] automatically, that's a humility right
[2:01:56] there. Because as long as you think you
[2:01:59] right, there is no way God will help
[2:02:02] you. Forget about where you are. If we
[2:02:06] are already perfect, the rapture would
[2:02:08] have taken place
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; and we will be completely out of here.
[2:02:12] If you reach perfection and the rapture
[2:02:14] and coming back yet, then you need to go
[2:02:18] to the grave because God won't want to
[2:02:20] you lose you. He will pick you up and
[2:02:22] put you there. So if you still alive, it
[2:02:26] means there are still things in our
[2:02:27] life. Let me leave you. There are still
[2:02:30] things in my life that I need to work on
[2:02:34] it that the Holy Spirit need to work on
[2:02:36] it. You know how you struggle with the
[2:02:39] message of the hour? God knows you
[2:02:41] better than me. God saw you where you
[2:02:44] are. God saw the things that you did
[2:02:47] that no one knows. Only you and God. God
[2:02:52] sees where you struggling in the
[2:02:54] darkness where you can block the pastor.
[2:02:57] You can block the deacon. You can block
[2:02:59] people until no one have access to what
[2:03:02] you're doing except the Holy Spirit who
[2:03:05] sees everything. And the Holy Spirit who
[2:03:08] saw all these type of things have come
[2:03:11] tonight to help you and to tell you that
[2:03:14] I'm ready right now to clean you up. And
[2:03:16] I cannot send a message without
[2:03:18] confirming my word. He's here to
[2:03:21] vindicate his promise and he's here and
[2:03:24] he's guilty of his promise. There is two
[2:03:28] choices before you leave this church.
[2:03:30] One of you will be guilty. Either it's
[2:03:33] going to be God who's going to be guilty
[2:03:36] or you will be guilty. And the only way
[2:03:39] you will be guilty is when you leave the
[2:03:41] church without asking because he gave
[2:03:43] you the opportunity and spoke to you to
[2:03:46] ask. But the only way you can leave this
[2:03:49] church clean without any problem and
[2:03:52] even you on a invisible audience, the
[2:03:55] only way you can live without any
[2:03:57] problem and have your heart clean is to
[2:04:00] make sure you take the burden. In other
[2:04:02] words, send the ball back to God. Tell
[2:04:05] God, you send your word. You spoke to me
[2:04:08] tonight. I see where I'm struggling. I
[2:04:11] see where I have difficulty
[2:04:13] understanding what the pastor preach
[2:04:15] here or there. Or I see where I don't
[2:04:18] agree with the message. I still wrestle
[2:04:21] with certain things. Even those online,
[2:04:24] I'm still reasoning with certain things.
[2:04:26] I see where the problem is. And here you
[2:04:29] came to my rescue to help me. So now I'm
[2:04:33] going to act according to your word.
[2:04:36] Number one, I'm going to admit where I'm
[2:04:38] wrong. And number two, I'm going to ask
[2:04:41] you to help me because if you don't help
[2:04:44] me, there is no way I can be changed
[2:04:46] because I tried all these years in the
[2:04:49] message and I'm not able to change. But
[2:04:51] I want you to help me tonight so that
[2:04:54] you yourself will come and put you a new
[2:04:57] heart. If that's what you needed, put a
[2:04:59] new spirit if that's what is needed and
[2:05:02] put your Holy Spirit in me. If you
[2:05:04] already have the Holy Spirit, ask him to
[2:05:07] refill you again with the Holy Spirit.
[2:05:10] The Holy Spirit to touch your body, to
[2:05:12] touch your soul, to touch your your
[2:05:15] spirit. Even you children, do not sit
[2:05:17] and walk and then look at people around.
[2:05:19] You cry up to the Lord yourself. You
[2:05:22] say, "God, I want to leave this church
[2:05:24] right here filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:05:27] and be different." Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Remember, he say, "Seek ye first the
[2:05:36] kingdom of God." If you notice the
[2:05:38] scripture the brother read in Ezekiel,
[2:05:40] after you receive the new heart, then
[2:05:42] the new spirit, then the Holy Spirit. If
[2:05:44] you watch what follow, God begin to
[2:05:47] increase the corn and God begin to
[2:05:49] increase remove the famine because those
[2:05:52] material blessing will follow
[2:05:54] automatically because the first one has
[2:05:57] been rich. I'm going to help you up with
[2:06:00] a scripture in case you don't know how
[2:06:02] to pray. I'm going to give you a
[2:06:04] scripture and use this scripture because
[2:06:06] God is guilty of his word. So if you
[2:06:09] don't know what to tell God, use this
[2:06:12] scripture tonight. It is not my word. It
[2:06:14] is not your word. It is the word of God.
[2:06:17] It's in the book of Luke chapter 11. You
[2:06:20] don't have to turn there. If you want to
[2:06:21] turn, that's fine. Luke chapter 11 verse
[2:06:24] 9. The Bible says, this is the word of
[2:06:27] Jesus Christ. He say, "And I say unto
[2:06:30] you, ask." This is what the brother was
[2:06:33] saying. Cry out. In other words, ask. I
[2:06:36] say unto you, ask and it shall be given
[2:06:39] unto you. In other words, you are you
[2:06:42] have a guarantee when you ask tonight.
[2:06:44] God must give it to you. I'm putting
[2:06:47] that master because I know an elect must
[2:06:50] receive the Holy Ghost. He says ask and
[2:06:53] it shall be given to you. He says seek
[2:06:56] and ye shall find. I know you you know
[2:06:58] this but just pay attention. Knock and
[2:07:01] it shall be open to you. If you don't
[2:07:03] know how to ask, seek. If you don't know
[2:07:05] how to seek, knock tonight. Tell God as
[2:07:08] a child, you say, "I'm knocking right
[2:07:10] now at your door." Boom, boom, boom,
[2:07:11] boom, boom. Do you hear me? I'm
[2:07:14] knocking. Talk to God like that. Don't
[2:07:15] Don't Don't try to be like, "I'm
[2:07:18] knocking spiritual." No. Tell him I'm
[2:07:20] knocking. I'm knocking right now. Amen.
[2:07:22] Verse 10. For everyone that ask
[2:07:26] receiveth. Everybody understand tonight?
[2:07:29] Everyone that ask will do what?
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; So if you don't ask tonight, that's your
[2:07:34] problem. Amen.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Ah, everyone that ask receive him. And
[2:07:38] he that seeketh doeth what? Findeth, and
[2:07:41] to him that knock, he shall be how? And
[2:07:45] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[2:07:48] that is a father, we got fathers here.
[2:07:51] Will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a
[2:07:54] fish, will he uh will he for a fish give
[2:07:57] him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an
[2:08:00] egg, will he offer will he offer him a
[2:08:03] scorpion? And this is your scripture
[2:08:06] tonight. If ye then being evil, know how
[2:08:10] to give good gifts plural unto your
[2:08:13] children, how much more shall your
[2:08:16] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[2:08:20] them that ask him? It's written right
[2:08:23] here. So God will give you the Holy
[2:08:26] Ghost if you ask him the Holy Ghost that
[2:08:30] will make this message easy for you.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that will not wrestle
[2:08:35] with any quotes of brother Brham. The
[2:08:38] Holy Ghost that will not you won't need
[2:08:41] anybody to come on you to tell you leave
[2:08:44] this place.
[2:08:45] Somebody will tell you this is not the
[2:08:47] right place for you. You won't need the
[2:08:49] deacon to be on you every time to tell
[2:08:52] you how to dress or you dress wrong. You
[2:08:55] don't need any reminder about the
[2:08:57] dressing anymore because it's the Holy
[2:08:59] Spirit. You won't need your parent to be
[2:09:01] there all the time with you because the
[2:09:04] Holy Ghost will tell you it's time to go
[2:09:06] home. The Holy Ghost will tell you this
[2:09:08] is not the right friend. Even if they
[2:09:10] are friending a message, the Holy Ghost
[2:09:13] will tell you this is not a good message
[2:09:15] friend. This is somebody you need to
[2:09:17] separate from them because most of our
[2:09:19] trouble are coming from our friendship
[2:09:21] because they are supposedingly to be in
[2:09:23] the message but they're not in the
[2:09:25] message. So now let's start. It's a
[2:09:28] season to be blessed and God want to
[2:09:30] bless you spiritually, physically,
[2:09:33] materially, financially and everything.
[2:09:36] Let's start by the Holy Spirit. So you
[2:09:39] play softly.
[2:09:43] If you in a rush, you can the door are
[2:09:45] open. You can leave. Don't put a rush on
[2:09:48] us.
[2:09:54] Remember, don't mind the deacon, don't
[2:09:59] mind the pastor, don't mind whoever is
[2:10:02] around all the journes.
[2:10:06] Mind your own business
[2:10:09] and ask the Lord tonight.
[2:10:13] Mommy prayed for you so much. Daddy pray
[2:10:16] for you so much. Tonight it's not about
[2:10:18] mommy or daddy. You yourself open your
[2:10:21] mouth please and talk to the Lord. Let
[2:10:25] mommy pray for himself, for herself. Let
[2:10:29] daddy do his own praying. You pray for
[2:10:31] yourself and talk to your maker.
[2:10:34] Approach him as your creator, as your
[2:10:37] father, and tell him when he send his
[2:10:40] word, the word never return void. It
[2:10:43] will always fulfill. Let that the word,
[2:10:46] this rain come down tonight and find the
[2:10:49] appropriate ground where it will bring a
[2:10:52] transformation.
[2:10:54] God does things unusual. He chose this
[2:10:57] Wednesday. If you know why this brother
[2:11:00] is preaching here, he was not even
[2:11:02] supposed to be preaching today.
[2:11:06] It was another minister who was supposed
[2:11:07] to preach today
[2:11:10] and an inconvenience happened and he's
[2:11:12] now preaching today. A message he didn't
[2:11:15] prepare. It's a fresh one coming from
[2:11:18] the throne of God. Pray in the name of
[2:11:21] Jesus Christ and ask him.
[2:11:37] Heavenly Father,
[2:11:39] Lord, we are approaching you humbly
[2:11:41] tonight.
[2:11:43] Father, thanking you so much for your
[2:11:47] grace, for your love, and for your
[2:11:50] mercy, Lord, and for intervening tonight
[2:11:53] in a special way when we were turning
[2:11:57] the corner. Father, as a pastor, I know
[2:12:00] exactly why I'm saying turning the
[2:12:02] corner. And there was something standing
[2:12:05] in the corner.
[2:12:07] And Lord, Father, you heard my prayer.
[2:12:11] And you open up a door again after many
[2:12:14] doors that you open up. You open up
[2:12:17] another window tonight to make sure
[2:12:20] whoever was lagging behind. Whoever was
[2:12:23] left and was not progressing and moving
[2:12:27] with the move of the Holy Spirit as you
[2:12:30] are unfolding the word, you want to pick
[2:12:32] them up tonight, Lord, and to make sure
[2:12:35] they are in this exodus so that Lord,
[2:12:38] Father, not even a hoof will stay
[2:12:40] behind, Lord. Father, whoever is
[2:12:43] struggling from this audience or the
[2:12:47] invisible audience, wherever they are,
[2:12:50] whichever state, Father, things that we
[2:12:53] know better not to do, but we found
[2:12:55] oursel caught up into them, things that
[2:12:58] we know and been preached for. And
[2:13:00] Father, here we still struggling after
[2:13:03] many years. Father, anything connected
[2:13:06] to the temple, anything that we see not
[2:13:09] aligned by the word, Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:13:11] we coming tonight and me as a pastor, oh
[2:13:15] Father, crying out for myself, crying
[2:13:18] out for my family, crying out for the
[2:13:21] church, crying out for your children,
[2:13:24] Lord, Father, admitting where we are
[2:13:26] wrong and asking you because you sent
[2:13:28] your word and your word will never
[2:13:30] return void. Father, now that we have
[2:13:33] opened up and you heard our prayer
[2:13:35] yesterday in a Zoom prayer and you came
[2:13:38] down to visit us according to the
[2:13:41] prayer, Lord Jesus Christ, I pray right
[2:13:44] now for everyone that have obey your
[2:13:46] word and open up their mouth. Your word
[2:13:49] stated, Lord, Father, that you also give
[2:13:52] the Holy Ghost to them that obey you,
[2:13:55] Lord, as they are crying up, you the
[2:13:57] great fountain, you the great ocean. May
[2:14:01] you open up the windows of heaven. May
[2:14:03] your presence come down. May the windows
[2:14:06] of heaven come. May father, Lord Jesus
[2:14:09] Christ, the Holy Spirit come down and
[2:14:12] fill each one of us here. Father, you
[2:14:14] did it on the day of Pentecost. Not one
[2:14:17] person left that building without
[2:14:20] receiving the Holy Spirit. Father,
[2:14:22] whoever don't have the Holy Spirit
[2:14:24] tonight, our children, our young people,
[2:14:27] our old one, Father, fill them with the
[2:14:29] Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:14:32] And if somebody have it, Lord, we fill
[2:14:35] him with the spirit of the Lord.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, fill our body, our soul, our
[2:14:41] spirit, every fiber of our being.
[2:14:44] Father, change, remove the old stone,
[2:14:48] remove the old spirit, remove the old
[2:14:50] nature. May the fire of the Holy Spirit
[2:14:53] burn and remove any root that is not the
[2:14:57] root and the offspring of David. Lord,
[2:14:59] may predestinated seed be quickened
[2:15:02] tonight
[2:15:04] because you say ask
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; and we are asking in the name that is
[2:15:09] above every name, the name of the Lord
[2:15:12] Jesus Christ. Because this is your
[2:15:14] promise and the promise was to us. The
[2:15:17] promise was for our children. The
[2:15:19] promise was for as many as you will call
[2:15:22] again Lord. And father we are praying
[2:15:24] tonight Lord. May nobody left leave this
[2:15:28] building
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; the same way they came in here. Father,
[2:15:31] this is your mercy that have been
[2:15:33] extended again in the midst of a series
[2:15:37] to Lord Father bring another opportunity
[2:15:40] to feel and bless somebody before the
[2:15:43] closing of 2025
[2:15:45] so that it will be a testimony that that
[2:15:48] night the Holy Spirit came and changed
[2:15:51] my life. That night, that night the
[2:15:54] spirit of the Lord fill my heart. I felt
[2:15:58] my body, my spirit, my entire being
[2:16:01] completely changed. Lord,
[2:16:05] you told us in your word to seek ye
[2:16:07] first the kingdom of God. Father, this
[2:16:10] is what we seeking tonight. And Father,
[2:16:13] we are coming according to your word and
[2:16:15] the opening of the word tonight. May you
[2:16:18] strengthen your man's servant tonight.
[2:16:20] Father, the one that you use, Lord.
[2:16:22] Father, remember him and his family as
[2:16:25] well, Lord. Father, we pray for those
[2:16:27] that didn't have opportunity to be in
[2:16:30] this building tonight. Father, may the
[2:16:32] spirit of the Lord touch them where they
[2:16:34] are and may whatever reason block them.
[2:16:38] May it never happen again unless it's
[2:16:40] legitimate. May Lord, Father, you burn
[2:16:43] every desire of the world. May you burn
[2:16:46] everything that is contrary to your
[2:16:48] word, to the message of the hour. Lord,
[2:16:50] may you come down in the power of
[2:16:52] resurrection
[2:16:55] and fill.
[2:16:57] Let our cup be overflown tonight, Lord.
[2:17:01] Father, we praying. I'm standing as a
[2:17:04] pastor, as a shepherd for the
[2:17:06] congregation, visible and invisible. And
[2:17:10] Lord, Father, they are also praying. And
[2:17:12] you spoke in your word where two or
[2:17:14] three are gathered in your name. Father,
[2:17:16] you will be in the midst of them. You
[2:17:18] were already here present Lord. But
[2:17:20] Lord, Father, we pray as door are
[2:17:23] opening up Lord. Father, inviting you to
[2:17:26] come and sine and abide and stay and
[2:17:30] feel and and and and and Lord affect our
[2:17:34] bodies, affect our mind, our spirit, our
[2:17:37] soul, our children. Lord, touch every
[2:17:40] part of the body that is sick. Lord,
[2:17:42] tonight may the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; fill Lord tonight, Lord. Those that
[2:17:49] don't know how to pray, Lord Jesus
[2:17:52] Christ, I'm standing as a pastor,
[2:17:54] standing Lord, Father, and Lord Father,
[2:17:57] putting my shoulder to their prayer and
[2:17:59] pushing the name of Jesus Christ so that
[2:18:02] you be merciful to them. You forgive
[2:18:04] them for every iniquity, any sin, any
[2:18:07] trespasses, just being obedient to speak
[2:18:10] to you. Father, look at their heart,
[2:18:12] Lord, and give them exceedingly
[2:18:16] and abundantly above everything that
[2:18:19] they can ask and need, Lord, in the name
[2:18:22] of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:24] Fail tonight, Lord.
[2:18:28] Break the heart, Lord. Change and
[2:18:31] transform.
[2:18:34] It's a baptism of fire.
[2:18:37] Father, you say we shall receive power,
[2:18:41] Lord, fill with power tonight.
[2:18:44] And may testimonies
[2:18:46] come from this night
[2:18:50] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:55] It's a promise.
[2:18:57] God is guilty for his promise. God is
[2:19:00] obligated to his word.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; It's a gift.
[2:19:07] And if natural father knows how to
[2:19:09] grieve, good gift, the Holy Spirit is
[2:19:12] far better gift than what we can give to
[2:19:15] our children.
[2:19:19] Remind him it's a gift. It's a promise.
[2:19:23] He promises.
[2:19:24] He say he will pour his spirit in the
[2:19:27] last day.
[2:19:32] In the day of Pentecost, they waited 10
[2:19:34] days. Tonight it's available. We don't
[2:19:37] have to wait 10 days.
[2:19:40] May he cleanse everything
[2:19:43] that is contrary to his word.
[2:19:47] Cleanse and wash our homes.
[2:19:52] Remove every memories
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; of things that were contrary to your
[2:19:57] word.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:01] so that we can be children of full
[2:20:04] obedience.
[2:20:06] Children that synchronize with your
[2:20:08] spirit. Children that follow the
[2:20:10] leadership of the spirit. Children that
[2:20:14] are glowing and reflecting the word and
[2:20:18] the light of this hour because our light
[2:20:21] have come and the glory of the Lord has
[2:20:23] risen upon us.
[2:20:26] We ask it father in Jesus precious name.
[2:20:31] You the God who is rich in glory. You
[2:20:34] who supply all our needs.
[2:20:39] You who said in your word that from that
[2:20:42] fullness we all drinking.
[2:20:45] Father may your fullness supply to every
[2:20:48] heart tonight
[2:20:53] in Jesus precious name.
[2:20:56] Fill again this building Lord. Fill the
[2:20:59] extension Lord.
[2:21:02] Touch this property again in a special
[2:21:04] way
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name.
[2:21:30] Believe it.
[2:21:33] Believe that he have given to you.
[2:21:42] He may come very quiet.
[2:21:44] He may turn you upside down on the
[2:21:46] floor.
[2:21:49] He may allow you to feel something in
[2:21:51] your body.
[2:21:53] And he may also not even let you feel
[2:21:56] anything, but he's there.
[2:22:00] Hold him by his word
[2:22:04] and continue to water. And from today
[2:22:08] when that devil comes back, tell him,
[2:22:11] "Remember this night.
[2:22:14] The Lord spoke to me. The Lord saw my
[2:22:17] weaknesses. The Lord came to my rescue.
[2:22:20] The Lord gave me his spirit and I'm a
[2:22:23] different child. I'm a different young
[2:22:26] man. I'm a different person. I have
[2:22:29] completely changed
[2:22:32] and he have filled me with his spirit
[2:22:37] and I'm a candidate that if he come
[2:22:39] tonight, I will be ready to meet him in
[2:22:42] the air. This is more important than any
[2:22:46] other things.
[2:22:49] Hold on to the promise of God. You have
[2:22:52] obeyed him. You have spoken to him. He
[2:22:55] is guilty of his promise. He is guilty
[2:22:58] of his word. You're not guilty anymore.
[2:23:02] All you have to do is thank him
[2:23:06] for giving to you the Holy Spirit
[2:23:09] tonight and filling you tonight.
[2:23:12] Thank him and continue to order.
[2:23:15] Continue to consecrate yourself.
[2:23:18] Continue to read his word. Don't mind
[2:23:20] again the devil. And don't mind whatever
[2:23:23] he's going to try to bring again as a
[2:23:25] memory. Remind him you were dead that
[2:23:28] night. God spoke. It was not you that
[2:23:31] spoken. And if it was for my sake, but
[2:23:34] it's not for my sake. It is for the sake
[2:23:36] of his holy name. Even the reason why
[2:23:39] he's picking up a bride from the
[2:23:41] Gentile, it's for the sake of his name.
[2:23:44] It is the decision of God
[2:23:47] to give unto us the Holy Spirit
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Hold to that
[2:23:59] promise
[2:24:00] and go home in peace.
[2:24:05] Enjoy
[2:24:07] knowing that God
[2:24:10] answers prayer.
[2:24:18] A woman that is not a message believer
[2:24:20] came in the prayer
[2:24:22] and receive what she was looking for.
[2:24:27] She got into the commonwealth of the
[2:24:29] message and she got her benefit. You do
[2:24:33] believe the message of the hour. You
[2:24:35] didn't reject the message of the hour.
[2:24:37] If God can do that for that lady, he
[2:24:41] will do that for you too. He just want
[2:24:44] you to get this first and everything
[2:24:47] else will take care of itself. Stop
[2:24:50] worrying. Quit worrying. God is alive.
[2:24:54] And from today, whatever he says, obey.
[2:24:58] Work on that possession. Don't linger
[2:25:00] anymore to act. Be quick to act when he
[2:25:04] tells you,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; no matter the cost,
[2:25:09] do what he's telling you to do and he
[2:25:12] will pack his own word and he will take
[2:25:14] care of it. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:25:18] thank you for your blessings tonight for
[2:25:21] coming Lord Father, our way and stopping
[2:25:24] by Lord Jesus to bless us in a
[2:25:27] tremendous way with a wonderful service
[2:25:30] tonight. Father, thank you for filling
[2:25:33] our children, for quickening
[2:25:35] predestinated seed, for touching each
[2:25:38] one of us here and on the
[2:25:41] streaming online. Father, thank you
[2:25:44] again for opening, Lord, another door
[2:25:47] tonight as we are changing and turning
[2:25:51] this corner. Lord, Father, we thank you
[2:25:54] for everything that you have done and we
[2:25:56] are committing your children unto that
[2:25:58] hand. Father, I claim the blood upon
[2:26:01] them. We're going through a cold weather
[2:26:03] of winter. Lord, protect us and immune
[2:26:06] us against every viruses, any
[2:26:09] sicknesses, any allergies, any attack
[2:26:12] from the world of darkness. Lord,
[2:26:14] Father, may you stand them, stand
[2:26:16] between them and the devil and any
[2:26:19] attack, mental attack and in talks from
[2:26:21] the devil. Father, give us all travel
[2:26:24] mercy. And if Tom Terry, may we meet
[2:26:27] again, Lord, if you have not come back
[2:26:29] yet, may we meet again to worship you
[2:26:33] and Lord Father to fellowship about the
[2:26:35] things of the kingdom. Thank you very
[2:26:37] much, Lord, Father, for sending your
[2:26:39] word to heal us because your prophet
[2:26:42] stated that the sickest body that he
[2:26:44] knows of is the body of Jesus Christ.
[2:26:47] And the healing that we needed is the
[2:26:50] word and you send that word tonight,
[2:26:52] Lord. And that word have touched us,
[2:26:55] have made a difference and brought the
[2:26:57] Holy Spirit in our life, Lord. Father,
[2:27:00] Lord, we thank you. Protect us, Lord.
[2:27:03] Fight for us, Lord. Lift up the standard
[2:27:06] for this church, Lord. We commit
[2:27:08] everything unto thy hand. All our
[2:27:10] desire, all our want is in your hand,
[2:27:14] Lord, in Jesus precious name.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead, brother S.
[2:27:23] We just want to thank the Lord tonight.
[2:27:25] Amen. With this song.
