amen can we be seated tonight we have a lot of testimonies tonight and I'm gonna give the chance for everyone to express his Joy To The Lord tonight amen amen amen um first I'll start with brother Charles the second amen amen [Music] oh there you go okay now I told you I didn't give the whole testimony but three Witnesses came and said you should have gave the rest but um I'm gonna give it now by God's grace so with everything that transpired with the First with the first portion of it what I didn't say was when they offered me the position it came with a truck so when that truck came I don't pay no fuel I don't pay no maintenance if anything happens to that they take care of it it's completely 100 free now but when we were looking for the position we hit a we hit a spot to where my wife said she said sweetheart you got the experience but you just don't have the paper so you're gonna have to go to school somewhere or find somewhere you can get in the door to get the experience to equal to the paper I don't know well when they offered me the job during the interview he said would you mind going back to school for these things so he's paying for all of it so it's the last portion you know I had a few concussions in my life so my my brain wasn't working the way it supposed to work and anybody that suffered with concussions you know you you know that and um by God's grace it said Lord my you know this position you know I can't my mind can't do what it has done in times past I said I need you to restore to me that's that um Supreme intelligence that I had with you before the foundation of the world I lead my portion and when I got in the position and the first time I had to speak in front of everybody I was just amazed with the words that were coming out of my mouth so I'll leave the testimony with this I'll leave the Bride of Jesus Christ with this when brother Bradham says stay with that word stay with that word [Applause] stay with that word amen and amen amen amen amen so I I I just decided to start out with the husband uh because I know the wife comes after that so because it's like Airline man amen amen then after that we have sister diamond giving a testimony amen tough act to follow um but you know we live in the same household we're husband and wife but it's an individual walk um he had his trials at work I had my own and I was fortunate enough to be brought back to my old employer about a year ago exactly in May and you know he was good to me my hours if the children had something at school and I needed to leave I could do that so sometimes you you hold on too long I got into a crossroad to where I began you know at work they would you would hear them joking I would be at my desk reading my messages or praying or talking about the Lord to another co-worker of mine and you would hear the jokes about the Lord and I said okay lord well they're not talking to me so Lord just forgive them and I would you know go about my business and then pastor preached a couple Sundays ago we're living below our means mediocracy we're compromising we don't have to know who we are and it begins to really Vex my spirit just sitting there and I said Lord I said I need you to either move them or move me and you know I'm in school for accounting and same situation not having the experience but not the paperwork so the doors are being closed and closed and closed and so I said well it's not my time to apply my husband's telling me my mom's telling me my co-worker where you need to apply you need to no I said I'm praying on it the Lord will direct me well just like Downton Thomas the lord loves us all he knows what he has to do to get each and every one of us I overheard a joke and someone in the office sneezed and my direct supervisor said huh God bless you and then it was a statement he made after I won't repeat it but it was so offensive to the Lord that I serve I said that's it I don't have something inside of me rolls up faith has muscles I don't have to compromise this is the day and I had applied maybe the Wednesday before that four position hadn't heard anything back they reached out to me that day I said oh Lord what are you doing and at the time most of the time I researched the companies and I know where all the information I hadn't researched anything wanted to interview on the spot called me

such a wonderful testimony he's the Kayla a man amen amen you're lining them up and they are more coming amen amen God bless you um I wanted to give a testimony um of what God done for me what he did for me um the Sunday before last so I wasn't feeling well and I put in a Praying request but by God's grace I was able to come to service and I was having really bad pain that day my stomach was hurting really bad I was going to go to the emergency room but I was just like I just need to get in service so I got in and I was just in here praising and I thought about and I was like huh I'm not

stand alone but it's just he's doing so much you know we just don't serve a good God but we serve a great God a miraculous God a powerful God for everything we need he's supplying all of our needs is that right Hallelujah some will get delivered tonight is that right because in his presence he promised what is healing in his presence it's salvation in his presence his Deliverance in his presence it's your blessing is in his presence what he said he wants us to what prosperous in all ways is that right why because we got the Full Gospel is that right in this hour in this rage he's given us to us come on the pride of Jesus Christ I'm not even worthy to Stand Here let him suffering up such a people Hallelujah thank you Lord there's no turning to Genesis um 22. and we'll look at the verse 15 y'all pray with me because the Lord been doing such a great things and um be out there and saving souls and they're in the institution the Lord has really been loading me up out here you know when I leave here and pass down I'm I'm fully loaded why can we got the message of the hour is that right so we know we got Christ with us is that right all we want to do is make sure we went in our position and God have indicated the Hallelujah this is not just letter only right this comes empowering and demonstration Hallelujah and all that happy Bible is that Genesis 22 and let's go to verse 15 for this good time he says in the angel of the Lord called on the Abraham Out of Heaven how many what the second time and he said by who myself have I sworn saved the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy only son is that right now we don't want to make these scriptures already you know a common to us so we'll see what the prophet of God said about this so we'll see how we're going to come up tonight right he's going to bring us up to stand is that right this is an individual walk is that right God just didn't call you for nothing at all is that right no no no no no no no he called you for a purpose yes sir he said now look he said that in blessing I will what who's going to do it God's doing it that's why the pastor came up and said God is blessing us yes God is blessing us is that right yes sir every little thing we give him the praise him the honor yes we give him the Glory thank you Lord because I Will Bless thee and multiply I will multiply by what see he said as the stars of the heaven and as the same in which are upon the sea and thy seed shall possess what enemies but not if come on now we should be the happiest people in the world not if he shall right he shall right yes we're going to possess every enemy the enemies should have no hope in your life that's your Victory no nothing in his life why because you are the Royal Sea of Abraham yes sir [Applause] Hallelujah he said and in and in dice he said You shall possess the gates of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has what obeyed may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated amen he said now you know it's something because I didn't know which way by the grace of God we're going to go it's just so much been opening up when I leave here and you're going to the institution you know you kind of got to go another Direction so if I go this way that way y'all keep me in the middle and keep praying say Lord bring him back so you gotta realize right we get around and because we've been working with that inner man you know we're still working with that inner man with them there's something now that is going to happen when the Holy Spirit changed that channel you know he was talking about the body the spirit and the Soul you know they don't have the little they can't get a whole other deep things yet right first we got to help them in being born again you got to bring him in the office of a prophet you got to bring in these things but God has given us grace and mercy to do so and so when you're dealing with that inner man you know you'll find out that that voice that's speaking to you and the things that you speaker is not really you in the flesh is that right it's not that fun not that she takes feel smell in here person is that right so you have to now God is bringing us to be able to fight this spiritual war in the end time now because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places so what you have to do is get in your position is that right if you don't get in your position if you jump in here you jump in there you're running here you're running in I'm trying to tell you something God is just going to keep with you whooping you is that right because he promised he's not going to lose not a one so we have to understand for you to fully be operating the way God called you first you got to get in your position once you learn your position and then you know you have that Authority because God will confirm it with what signs and wonders and things behind it the these signs shall follow them that what believe is that right so we're going to show you that this Abraham seed you know where I got my timer on here so I'm all right he got around there so you have to realize in this hour now who you really really are that right so we want to do some reading tonight and we're going to jump back and forth um in some scriptures also so we're coming out of the inspiration came out of the patriarch um Abraham right that's where the inspiration comes it was the faith test promise of the word okay because each each time God gives us the word but being the Seed of Abraham or a Believer all of us is going to be tried and tested you're gonna be tried and tested that's why he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers we're at in high places so we're so what we're dealing with is an organized Army of Satan so we remember our War's religion versus salvation this religion versus salvation so let's read down here I meant the paragraph two with the message 2 7 64. those that streaming if you want to uh keep up y'all just got to bear with me don't have a board so you got to pray he said now he said well look when God promised that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy the enemy he says now what a promise because because of what obedience is that right so now we're getting somewhere it's because of obedience like when I tell them in an institution obedience brings you a blessing Disobedience bring you a consequence so you have to understand when you're when you're Abraham's seed let me keep going he said now what a promise because of obedience obedience is what God wants it was once said obedience is better than sacrifice is that right the Lord is better than sacrifice he knows the time he was talking about in The Book of Samuel remember me shall God came and he was working with Samuel then by the way there and he was there and he was trying to tell Samuel uh uh with Saul and Saul was telling him he should have stuck with the word like you heard from somebody's testimony I think might have been John said what stay with the word you stay with the word and when you speak there because why because the word is God and it will lead and guide you into all truth so he told them when he was telling Saul remember Saul didn't stay with the word and so God had to take what he had to take that Authority in that position from him and when he took it from him but you got to remember that Disobedience you can be careful because now you you can open the door for sorcery you can open the door for witchcraft you can open the door with those iniquity Spirits is that right I'll tell you what some of you looking at me turn to first Samuel 15. help me Lord he's getting around in there he says uh first Samuel 15 for the sake of time let's look at verse uh 20 uh 22. what you have it say Amen and Sam you said have the Lord has the great delight and burning offer and sacrifices and obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey his what better than sacrifice and and hearken than the fat of rams he says for what rebellious is as the sin of what witchcraft he said so in stubbornness is as this as iniquity and what idolatry because thou has rejected thy what the word of the Lord huh so you're not running and moving rejecting the pastor you're not running and moving rejecting the order of the Lord I mean of us of the deacons or the trustees of someone what you're running against you're kicking up against the word of God that's what you're kicking up against and so especially if you know better is that right so you need to be careful because you this Mission here that has been given to the to the pastor and the ministry that come through is to bring you higher is that right it is to bring you higher not to stay in a religious uh sector it's to bring you higher because you already have your salvation right because you told us Prosper as your what so Prosper your soul is prospering is because Christ already came and paid for your salvation is that right now once the Holy Ghost comes in there in your life he's the leading and guiding you into all the truth so you gotta want to receive these blessings just bear with us by the grace of God and we'll see what the prophet said here he said now we're facing a grand Patriot Abraham he said which was called the father of what faith because that God made him the what the promise to inherit the earth and who else and his seed not just Abraham but the Abraham seed now you have to realize who you are right so sometimes God wants to show us how to operate and for you to operate you got to understand that inner man is that right then you've got to understand when the spirit is moving that inner man and sometime it may be someone in the world that God is speaking to to give you a message we got testimony it's the testimony night you know I've got an institution down there I'm going in three institutions now you keep praying for me and sometimes we Minister four times a week you gotta understand what God is doing God is what he's loading me up here so when I go out there I got them credit for every demon every religious demon that tries to come against me because God said uh no weapons formed against me shall what prosperous so you gotta understand them we were sitting in a meeting one time and we were looking going down trying to get into an institution and the brother came and all he did was ask me we were sitting next to me he said brother are you down in the Mecklenburg yeah and I looked at him but it wasn't him it wasn't him that said it you got to understand when it's a voice down here that speaks to you and when you got around in them and if it's God come on we're bringing you up that's what the Holy Spirit been ministering through the pastor he's trying to understand that inner man is that right when you're dealing with that inner man so what you got the body you got the spirit you got the soul but remember he said what when that light come is that right when that light and that sperm and that egg straight is what now that seed is coming forth is that right is life that's going to start moving but down in there you can have who you can have faith or you can have doubt is that right you're right because you had Jacob and you had Esau is that right he said Jacob by love and Esau I hate it even that time it's funny when there's something faith that inter strikes you so I went on there and I called and when I called the lady said oh they hadn't called you yet to be reinstated you see so it wasn't it wasn't him it was is God speaking through him you got to learn that he and have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to you amen amen [Applause] then we come down there and the Lord is richly blessing okay you're having a study we can minister to one-on-one we go pray with them God is doing some great things and that's what I'm saying you got to understand we'll keep going in a minute but you got to realize what God wants to do through you God just didn't call you just to sit there and do anything that's why the holy spirit said no one's de-christianizing you but what are you doing since you got the Holy Ghost you see so now we got to understand that God is vindicating what he called us to do so within them and the Lord is just richly really richly blessing and we got a good just some things going on I can't say on on the tube but it's just some great things that's going on huh and and I'm telling you you'll see the devil just ain't gonna let you walk in now we gotta have one when we went to the meeting and we went to the meet I went to one of their sisters and she was going to help me she said well you want me to talk to the sheriff I worked with him I know him personally and I said oh let's wait and then let's see and then we waited and after we waited then the Lord kept being persistent that's why he said you're going to possess the gates of the enemy but you gonna have to fight for every inch of it huh I bring the quote up I'm like the pastor now and I pulled a quote for you if you want me to brother Brandon said he said you're gonna have to fight for every inch of it you ain't cadillacing out of here because A promise is the promise of God so you got to understand Satan don't forfeit his what his benefits what he say bless the soul I mean bless the Lord all my what huh what's in the soul it's the seed that's down in the soul so the seed that's down in the soul it feeds off the word of God and when you're down to bless my soul and forget not what all your benefits so in the word in the word bring me my blessings in the word so your benefits is in the word yes in the word bless my soul that's what it feeds off of so you're dealing with body you're dealing with the spirit and you're dealing with the soul and so the Lord came and ministered US told us no don't judge yourself on your zodiac sign [Music] don't judge yourself on your flesh don't judge yourself on what part of the earth you were born in is that right don't judge yourself by your education so the Lord came and showed us those things are temporal that's right yes you're dealing with it you got body you got Spirit you got sower those things are what and your spirit are temporal is that right but now deep down in your soul that's it God put a seed there yes he put a foundation of the world now and why is he the faith or even doubt is that right we feed man should not live by what bread alone but by what everywhere Saints preach yes [Applause] see the devil don't like that my brother colleagues be back there and then back then he said ah [Applause] huh then he's like preach that devil don't like that because he's bringing it from his soul it's something down in his soul you just can't bring it up like that just for entertainment no stop [Applause] help me Lord he said now look what else you tell us he told us those things are temporal but he said oh bless my soul and forget not all thy benefits it's in the words let me keep going help me Lord he said we're facing now he said because God made him the promise he says in inherit to inherit the earth and his seed he said so and it's through Abraham we being dead in Christ become Abraham's seed and or what heirs with him according to the promise that's a powerful thing when you answer everything that God has your heirs to what Christ has that's why the same movement that Christ that when Christ was here that's how we got the testimonies we got those testimonies is because you're Abraham see and you're believing the word so it can't just be louder the testimonies will continue to come he said now you look now Abraham was just an ordinary man Ordinary People common people you know what I'm saying well used to say ordinary people doing the extraordinary job he knew it too he get no he making billions and he paying them five dollars leave that alone huh he knew he knew that was extraordinary people don't take a rocket scientist to figure that out he said look he says in Abraham sees our heirs with with him according to what the promise he said now Abraham he doesn't ordinary man wasn't special he wasn't special God never called him as far as as we have any record until he was what 75. right he said God called a complete what this is where we get in trouble some of us God called a complete separation from any doubt [Applause] any doubt not right God don't want to surround no unbelief I'm family members that's on family members I love them I love them dearly but if I was in the hospital I wouldn't call them huh watch Abraham see you watch Abraham you watch Abraham see see what God meant he meant it too I called one of y'all before I would call them oh you're my family huh I know imma get a word of faith I know imma get a word of Grace I know I'm gonna get a word of Mercy I know I'mma get it I not believe it I know I'm gonna get it [Applause] yes sir Hallelujah anyhow he said God Called It complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world he said a minute and from all his people and from all his Kindred he said there was a special thing for him to do huh God got a special thing for us to do and God called us to do he called them in the scriptures for a special assignment just an ordinary person and most of us think we're not even worthy to do what he called us to do amen he called you to sing get in your position be the best singer there is is that right huh why because it's for the glory of God you can't get out of it God chose you you want to be a musician learn from the best position there is is that right you gotta realize that you want to learn how to show me young ladies want to cook and set up a buffet or something real nice you need to find sister Odessa huh because she can help him along is that right huh she can help you along you gotta watch you gotta understand the gifts that's there that's around you that's right you see so when you get certain ones I mean certain things you like to do you keep on you got Brother Sam somebody that's dedicate his life to the Lord do it let us keep going help me Lord we didn't plan to be long but I wanted you just to see that there but he has rejected the word of the Lord that's what happened and that's why I was sharing that with you when people were disobedient what you're doing you're rejecting the word of God and God's trying to bring you into position he said now you look over here help me Lord he said and when God and and when God expects you to do a special thing he demands complete separation let me keep going Hallelujah help me Lord we're going to get to some uh individuals in a minute just bear bear with me because I want you to see what the prophet of God said on these things here he said the child he's he he said now he knows God promised it he said the child in the ladder when he returned when Abraham went there with the child and the lab he didn't have any doubt because God promised it if God said it it's going to happen it's going to happen in God's time but it's gonna happen is that right he said now let us keep going he says that's all we care to know he said I'm at 14 paragraph 14 the ones is writing it down he says that's all we care to know he said God promised it how it's going to be I can't tell you but God said so he says he will send Jesus Christ the second time he will come in a physical form is that right we know we're looking for the second coming of Christ is that right so we're looking at the second coming of Christ is because God promised it he said I will not have you what ignorant is that right he said the Lord who himself shall descend from heaven what with a shout with a voice and with a trunk he already came not a physical Court body when he came on the mountain he came down and opened his seals up for each and every one of us is that right the ones that don't want the seals and they don't want the Thunders that Sumter it then that's why some of you you're going to find out you're still fighting this battle in your flesh and moving forward prospering is that right especially in your health because what you're doing is you're not taking down the rapturing faith of Grace message everybody is invented the pastor's sharing with you look at the question and answers huh look at themselves okay he's sharing those things you're ages he's sharing those things with you because he's gonna build your rapturing faith of Grace you gotta have him now because why the second oil now has been open Matthew 25 is that right we know that he came now and that oil that we're getting now is those the Thunders that was hidden up under the seals is that right so now we had to have a covenant Messenger to come and bring us that message to get us ready to meet Jesus in the air is that right let me keep what I'm trying to I'm interpreting I'm trying to do my best slowing down he said now look he says now he said all that we know they come in a second time the physical body he says and with the redeem let us drop down there to what verse 15 chapter 15. he said he promised to do what heal the sick now we don't know how you're gonna do it but he promised amen God promised to do it in this agent now if Christ is back inform again Christ said all scriptures are written by the inspiration of God is that right for reproof for correction all is worth now so the same as Christ when he was here in the flesh the son of man the first time he was here now he's here again what in the spirit form is that right so to see Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever never so we should be lacking nothing God promised he said told us forget not all those what benefits his Lord came and the Lord thy God that heal of all thy diseases is that right when Moses came up against they had to be what used when Moses came and he had to be tested and the time for him to bring them out of the liver bringing them bringing being the deliver her and bringing Egypt bringing Israel out of Egypt come on now Moses what he had to do he had to be tried and he had to be tested so if he tried and he had to be tested so he had to run up against who uh uh James and Jamboree is that right they had a ride and Moses had a ride but Moses had to be tested but Moses knew that who God sent to him is that right God told him Moses I'm going to deliver my people but I'm gonna show you these things you're going to have to be facing up against him so when he came in there and when he ran up against that what sorceries that right Moses but God had to vindicate that Moses was his man and when Moses was his man he swallowed up what their rod is that right now it's the same way when we're out there we're battling these religious demons when the religious demons that's out there now you got now we got the word by Revelation that God is bringing us is that right you don't have to worry about because we got the quote and you got the message which is the revelation of the word which is all of them is what one so we have the women the word is the voice of God so you should meet him no sicknesses no diseases no Affliction will come apart in your body is that right and when it comes and someone asks you what's wrong uh I'm okay I'm glorifying God God is going to come and make it delivered God said it this sickness this disease is doing what it's trespassing is that right this disease and this sickness is trespassing you have to understand it's like a natural code when you get a natural code and that natural cold when they get there on your body you got to be able you know when it's coming when you know it's coming you gotta drink you some hot tea you got to get around there and get the bacteria off your tongue and out of your mouth was the same way when Satan Satan come at you like he came at Jesus is that right he said man should he says he said if you be the Son of God turn these words stones to bread is that right until you say what man should not live by bread alone but by every word I perceive the value of the mouth of God we're talking about being tested and we're talking about your faith now being tested you got to understand I'ma get back to the reading but you got to understand in this hour here now it's a lot of lack of faith they got more doctors more medicine more equipment all these things but there's less Faith out there is that right A man is not going to be quick not to tell you not to take something when he's making two 10 or 15 billion dollars a year off of it you think he's not going to tell you I'm telling you that your faith has to be tested maybe this is testimony night then let me tell you about when my wife and I went to the doctor you know when we go there to the doctor sometimes I guess they look at me and they look at my face bro Steve you know and when they look at my face I was a pretty bad patient when I first started out you you know because I didn't go there unless I I didn't go there unless I had to go there you see what I'm saying so when you get there and you get yours you get to retirement you got to go once a year so we got around and then the fellow was saying and now if you don't get on there and know you you supposed to know you and God know you is that right you got to know you and God know you and so when you get around and the doctor said well you know you look like Prospect but Prosperity might be such a size I looked around in there I said okay doc he said uh well uh it might be cancerous you know some might be cancerous I said oh really doc I said uh I tell you what what you talking about doing he said well you know they go in there and they gotta go in there and cut a piece of your prosperation look I said I tell you what doc I said first of all I said I ain't no test laboratory and second of all I ain't no pincushion I said let me tell you right now I said so when you get in there you got to understand ain't no cancer can come in this body ain't no sickness can come in his body you might even realize that doc you talking to the wrong one because I got a promise no diseases no sickness he come upon his body I don't know I don't believe it I know it cause God said it God said don't let him speak nothing on you [Applause] when that we're back six months later he got over that and then my primary doctor said you're going on huh well that's enough so first of all he looked like he didn't sleep all night I say he didn't shave see I'm old school you gotta understand what tell my age but you got to understand you got to understand certain things I'm looking for a certain Behavior you know and I said no he said he said well you wanna sign you to another doctor no I said because six months I'm gonna go show them what God done did [Applause] [Music] I had the six months to win back and as we went back he said well he said uh you ain't changed your mind yet said no sir he said I see your numbers ain't changed I said I know this wasn't going to change he got over there so he said well if you don't mind me checking you about a year he said well come back in 12 months I said you're all right doc [Applause] and my wife was sitting right there too put up with him you know what I mean then you're going to come there and then I gotta ask you questions are you supposed to be telling me and I gotta ask you I'm telling you how to examine them they asked me that money then I'm coming in there I told my wife I said see you see the way she got a good doctor I said see he tell you this this this this this this this this I said what did that one tell me I had to ask him this ask him this ask him that ask him this he just don't know after that I'm through with him huh you got to understand don't play with him I'm telling you what's going on out there you you better be able to discern huh I don't know why we got on that but it's for somebody I mean maybe this testimony night huh God come around in there God doing some great things out there for us hallelujah help me Lord he said now look he said he he was outrage that that verse I mean 15 15. he said now he promised to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils he promised to do that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said he promised to do it he said we believe it he said that sound was it when a man believed God he believes all he says now some of it but he's all he said uh-huh uh-huh you say you've got the holy spirit said that the other day huh you believe you you you you waiting to have a child yeah go buy your booties go by the clothes huh you got a promise from God you're the Royal Seed of Abraham you're the faith Seed of Abraham faith without works is bad enough you'll know me by my faith by my works and you know my works by my faith son got to back you go ahead and do it why because now you're putting God on the spot you're putting God Out There Our God we serve a great God a mighty God is able to keep all of his promises no woman in his bride shall be unfruitful or Byron is that right you got a sickness you got an illness in your body keep speaking it it's trespassing it has no right to touch your body [Applause] say look help me Lord he said now he says and that's the way Abraham believed God now is asked to destroy now look what he said they wanted him to destroy the evidence they wanted him to destroy iron the evidence is that right but he had to be tested right but it has to be tested but he's focused the latter and I shall what return is that right brother Brandon said it was the buzzing the intellect battle started he said the intellect started up there that's why some of you don't get what you need right now because you're listening too much of what the doctor said you're reading too much on the internet you're out there running and looking at that forces is that right because God promised it to you now if the pastor the Lord give a pastor something for you to tell you then you become disobedient you don't become obedient to the word of the Lord so you become to a halt is that right maybe something is affecting your health or maybe getting your finances or what you what you need there are the life if God promised to supply all of your needs is that right he promised it you have to write if you've Got Confidence with God if you're doing what God's sharing with you telling you to do then you've got right to go to God to find out why is that right if you've got a business and that business is not prospering if you prayed and you went to God and God told you to get it then you need to go to God and ask God why it's not prospering is that right that's exactly right Faith tested that's what it is the promised words he said help us Lord he said Not only did he give give this great he says and that's the way Abraham believed he said now was asked to destroy every evidence that his promise would be taken care of but he was persuaded that God could do it raise him right back he says not only he gave he gave this great promise he give it to who his seeds you see and also and because Abraham was what faithful the word God God promised him and knowed that God could raise up this child and he spared not his own what child but with God his son let me drop one down for the sake of time he said all Abraham's seeds all Abraham's seed as us as Christ see as the faith see that's the Royal seed is that right all Abraham she believes God just like that God said it I believe it I stand on it and that's it we don't look at the condition we are the Abraham seed the faith see the look who we are my my my We're The Germ of God we're the economy of God huh the devil can't touch this what we got he can't come near it he said now look he said oh Abraham she believes like that they are believing God and we know that it pleases God so well that here is what he what he said what the seed shall do what possess the gates of his enemy but what after the trial everybody's going to be tried and tested he said now look he said remember he's he said now remember that we shall possess the gates of the enemy that's thus say the Lord Abraham's C believes that if you are a genuine Seed of Abraham the faith that Abraham had in God it's in you is that not your hook and you believe that what God's saying has said God keeps his promises he said now you look you look into the word you got to realize God has brought in examples In Those Old Testament looking shot right Michelle is that right they had to be what tried and tested is that right come on now look how much the Lord loved you so much look how much you love you what did she write me check in the Bendigo had to bow down to is that right once they did what played the music come past them once they played the music is that right some of you gotta understand now it's just music what's in the music it was the rhythm is that right he told us It's the Rhythm that grabs a hold of them so why did why did Nebuchadnezzar first start playing the music is that right because they know if they didn't bow down to the music and then he was going to what throw them into the fire is that right so we all got to be what tried and tested so shy right me Shaq independigo they had a fake seed inside of them and they recognized that their God how great their God was no matter what what Nebuchadnezzar would try to do to them they're not they wasn't going to bow down to that God so we have to understand the anything come at you any sickness any diseases any doubt if you know you apply for a specific job and you need that job God will get that job for you if it's there to glorify God if you need a certain vehicle to get your to and fro from work God will get that vehicle for you because you need that vehicle don't cut yourself short that's what the Holy Spirit been saying don't cut yourself short you would believe in the word of God he said of your word abide in me and I abide in you whatever you ask you what you can't receive is that right but you're going to be tried and tested Satan is going to bring all kinds of obstacles before you he's going to throw stumbling blocks before you so we have to understand that God is greater is he that is in thee is that right then he that is in world so what is he building you have to be tried and tested so your character can be just like him job said we brought nothing in this world we'll take nothing out of this world but Joe was talking about material things and things you could see but who the character because the Bible asks they say we may not appear to be anything but we're going to be just like him who when we leave here we gonna have the character of Christ is that right so you don't see the the seed of God is led by the spirit of God is that right you're not born of The Incorruptible seeds I mean other corruptible sea We Are The Incorruptible sea which is the word of God that's going to be manifested in his hour here now no weapons formed against you can prosper you speak the word uh move that sickness from in front of you speak the word more than Demons from in front of you speak the word my father will be saved by mother will be saved my sister will be saved my grandchildren will be saved speak the word it's inside of you the same seat that was in Abraham the light and I shall return the same sea is inside of you speak the word [Applause] [Music] amen he's building a character that's where you build turn the uh first Peter help me Lord I'm over first Peter 1. yes let's see what we got here help us Lord you got to understand you're the one the whole world is groaning for the manifestation of the sun and the daughters of God that's what they're looking for help us Lord look at First Peter and there you go thank you Hallelujah he said now look where we go you got it amen verse 7 he says that the trial of your what being much more what precious than what of goal that perish though it be tried with what

the what Grace that is to be bought to you at the what revelation of Jesus Christ so now we know that when it's the revelation of Jesus Christ has come to you now you're left by the spirit and the Holy Ghost comes and it seals you I Know a Man the other day so I wonder if I got the Holy Ghost brother I said brother what is the desires in your heart now you don't have the same desires do you

spot verse 20 who really was ordained from from the West foundation of the world but was manifested in these what last times for who for you yeah he said who by him do what believe in God that be what raise them up from the dead and gave him what Glory that your Faith and Hope might be in who God God can fill you God said it that's it in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with

your Bible pick those those seals and those ages up just pick them up and read them constantly look at your time if you're wasting time most people that waste time you got financial problems uh huh because the businessman uh a businessman is based on his things on time and money what he's paying you he's basing it on time that's what he's basing it on so if you're not doing that then hello he said now look thus say the Lord let's look at Christ let's look at Christ here then we'll wind it up help us Lord he said now I'm a paragraph 61. he's there at paragraph 61. you can look into Romans 4 13 through 18. he said then one day Along Came what the Royal season of Abraham Jesus Christ the son of God Abraham see by what faith not through Isaac the natural scene they did not depart that's why last time when I was here I was working with the Inner Man and the inner man always have conflict with what the end of man has conflict with the flesh with the intellect with the carnal mind so that's why they can't grasp it no no you got to pray for your pastor pray for the gift it's not his gift is our gift it's my gift was the Bible said once it's revealed it's mine it's not what he said it's mine now I take it out there and when I take it out there I'm getting results uh why because I believe it I believe it I know it's God that's minister to us so when you take it you got to realize that what God has called you to do is that right help us Lord I know we're jumping tonight but let me keep going he said now not who was not Natural Born he come one and let me say this here thank you Jesus you got to understand some of you don't listen why did I believe the Lord we're sharing that about the medical terms because we're in the Supernatural walk is that right he told us to do what Pastor put on the what whole armor or what now we're talking about the whole armor of God a helmet of salvation let's play the righteousness preparation of the gospel of peace girtual good in your loins with truth but we're talking about the whole armor of God on the inner man that's what we're talking about that's what we've been ministering that's what he meant that's what we're getting it's the inner man is that right love peace Joy righteousness long-suffering is that right what's the Holy Spirit then he brings this flesh under subjection he bring your intellect under subjection now you're starting to recognize when that inner man is speaking to you and if it's him it will come to pass foreign that's why he came in through Luther's day that's why he had to come with what Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. Revelations 10 7. is that right Abraham had to come which was Melchizedek he had to see that sign is that right that sign of Melchizedek I think it was Genesis 17 when he came to the 10th what did God do God burned that body is that right he said that same sign that had to be brought again but was not brought yet he had to tell William Mary and Brenham don't drink her don't smoke her don't do anything to your body why because I gotta use that body to bring this last sign to my bride in the last time the no Christ is not dead but he's alive the resurrected Christ is here back on the scene again speech the word for the miraculous Saints in a message he got that hurt the other day a young man that went there went to a meeting when he went to a meeting with his son and his wife huh and his wife said got there the Lord had delivered her from cancer and the Lord delivered up from cancer then he turned over there and he saw that his son needed some lungs he went to the to the meeting and brother random spoke and told him that your son is healed went to the doctor the next day and God had gave him a new set of lungs don't tell me he can't give you no new kidney God could give you a

you in Jesus name we pray amen and Amen brother Steve [Applause] thank you praise God amen amen amen are you ready to speak the word amen you know brother Branham say if you got God inside of you you see God everywhere you know that I remember being in school and they were teaching Immunology and when I'm looking at the slide I'm seeing the seals I see how your body fight he looks like the devil the way he's attacking the body it's looked like the first seal the second cell and I wrote The Sermon spiritual Immunology and I have not preached it yet since I was in Dental School in other words when God is in you when you're looking at things you see in God amen that's why he can remember the Lion King and he can see a message through amen amen do you know that that beat him on the head by the Bible do you know that do you know that when Simba was growing up the baboon hit him on the head he hit him the first time and he heard him and he came the second time and he dodged it do you know what he told him he says the past hurt but you can dodge it because the past was was what was blocking him to go back to take over so when the devil begin to bring your past dodge it [Music] [Applause] don't let the devil hit you with the past because you will hurt and when he hurt you at this courage you don't have the strength to continue but when he begin to bring the past you dodge it just remember who you are you have to look through the mirror of the word and to see who you are remember who you are remember who you are amen and go and take every territory that is not functioning properly everything that is below a hundredfold you need to fight for it amen you need to fight for it amen God gave you the victory God said so he knows what he's doing God is challenging our faith because we have been so lazy in this message so relax and we got used to everything we got health care we got this insurance we got this we got this we got this until we don't trust God for even a headache amen that's why God begin to rock the boat and Shake everything so now whenever they close the door you don't have to worry when the pressure of The ecumenical move begin to come you're not gonna be worrying about that pressure anymore why because you got the spoken word you're not gonna be worrying if Walmart is closed you're not gonna be worrying if Sam's Club is closed because you already got used to a god that is daily taking care of you and day by day he's unfolding his strength and his goodness towards you amen the trial is not your trial it is the trials of the faith but remember faith is always coupled with patience that patience is what gives you the under the endurance for you to continue to hold on to the promise until you get it amen actually when you get a vision from God you automatically have to be a prepared for a test but they're not testing you they're testing the vision that God gave you when Joseph got a vision he was so good he came up he said I saw everybody bowing down that Vision have to be tested but when he was testing he only developed your character and release the inner man and you will know really who you are after every battle that you went through now you can turn around you say I can see that I'm a better person than what I was before if I didn't go through that through this through this probably I would not have been closer to God the way I am right now so everything worketh together for good everything is working together for goodness everything we will understanding better when and you will appreciate God more and more before you begin you say oh my God now I see the reason why you were doing that amen God knows it you know that marriage that you start with your wife and you're buying your little stuff together and then you work together and then you buy a home together and you move together Those whom are more sweeter because you want together through the trial every trial in the family was just bringing you the devil thought he's gonna bust them up before you know it that's why brother Branham say tension is blessing it's attention and he comes back tension and until a certain time you will reach a time of peace you'd argue no more you know where everybody pretty good you can look at one another eyes and you understand what the person is saying you get the signal and you know what had to operate and and it's like automatic you are you are synchronized together but it takes certain trial to Rob Iran and get the dirt out by God these know what he's doing all right young people God knows what he's doing amen stay strong God is challenging our faith you can do it don't look at this man don't look at your zodiac don't look at where you were born don't look at your past failure look at the man who is inside as long as you have a breath of life there's still hope as long as you're living there's still hope as long as you're living meaning you have not finished the purpose of God yet in this life you still have something to do amen so cheer up and let's move on and fight again and recuperate some territory so on Sunday we come with more testimony amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this evening Lord father once again thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and father for speaking to our soul tonight encouraging your children and father reminding us Who We Are that we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and things that must seem normal because of the way we were educated and the civilization you begin to unforce to us that they are not normal they are contrary to your word they're not ramming together with what the promises of God are saying because in according to your promise you want us to prosper you want us to prosper in every aspect of our life you want us to have a a prosperity of our spiritual work with you you want our family to prosper spiritually to prosper material to prosper in every aspect and you want your children to be in good health so that we can serve you more so that we can serve you with our whole heart our body our soul father you want our soul also to continue to prosper father may you shake every devil that is trying to hang on to this to keep your children in bondage because the time have come that we have to stand and move on move on into the deep reality of God begin to experience the supernatural power of God begin to experience the things that we have been reading in the scripture that we thought it's only for Abraham it was only for Daniel he was only for Joseph but now father you're bringing them back into reality that we are more we are even the Royal seed father how can you take care of a generation that you destroy and when you came down in human flesh you say all of them were dead and your Prophet stated that they were totally eternally separated from you but that Eternal seed that was not even your seed you took care of them you give them bread when they whine you give them Lord father the flesh they quell you took care of them in the wilderness you healed them when they rebel against you father you took the present Serpent and you told that generation of rebellions to look and you heal them until they were all dead because your prophets say it was their children that have to enter in the Promised Land father if you can take care of a rebellion generation of people that withstood your messenger that shattered with Moses that argued that wanted to Stone Moses that were constantly longing to go back to Egypt they wanted to find a new captain that would take them back to Egypt there are even esteemed the things of Egypt greater than the manner that you have given them and yet you took care of them because of the promise that you gave to Abraham father how much more we who are honoring your prophet we don't argue with the prophet we are humbling ourselves below the word that was spoken by the prophet because we realized that it was not the word of man he was the unfailing body word of the son of man we don't chat with brother Branham we don't try to remove him from being the messenger we acknowledge and we respect it and we uphold his position where you put him Lord father how much more should you take care of us should you take care of our families should you take care of every single aspect of our life that is not functioning that is not responding well that is giving us trouble father may you Quicken that Revelation to your children that was the first Exodus that we are in the third one in the perfected one where not only are you changing the ins word man you're gonna change even the odd word man father you even told us that if we receive the one that you sent we will receive the prophet reward father we have cherished this message your Prophet taught us you don't only remember the curses but you remember the blessings father there are many of them in the Bible who remember them Lord and may the Holy Spirit Quicken them and pour them down in the life of this church in Every Family on this church may we see changes in our life May a spiritual realm broke open it Lord so that we can get access to the Unseen World father looked at the young children look at our young men that we call patriarch Lord father if any young man can be taken out to the world and the devil can fulfill his part so successfully until it's harder it's getting even harder to go by a day without seeing someone with tattoo father sure the Holy Spirit also will fulfill his word more may you take a hold of the young men of this church may you refocus them may you bring them Lord to a greater responsibility father make them prosper cut every bound Every Chain from the world every foolishness on the telephone on the computers every spirit of destruction that is always pulling them toward pleasure toward hanging around [Music] they are precious to us you gave us these children father make them prosper those that have backsliding those that seems to be offended by this message father we're not looking at them we're looking at our faith in you because you taught us to have faith in you father turn them around I don't care the situation because that's not the problem for you because all things are possible to them that believe father I'm believing for every family in this church that heaven loved one that is not where they're supposed to be father May the Holy Spirit hunt them and bring them back to the folder because we won't leave anything not even a hoof father protect us tonight strengthen brother Kelly Lord give us travel Mercy and may your blood continue to protect us throughout this week and may you consecrate us more and more until we meet again on Sunday if that theory to me does
