Jesus is here [Music] all things are possible Jesus is Jesus [Music] is Jus is all things [Music] are Jesus is amen am amen clap your hands for the Lord tonight how many you glad to be back in the house of the Lord tonight amongst the Believers you know I was thinking over the last Services we heard and um God just been he's been pounding on faith I don't know if anybody else noticed that he's been pounding on faith and know I was talking with my wife I was like God is trying to get somebody ready for a Rapture that's right and and he he knows if you don't have that type of Faith there's no Rapture and and and that's the reason why he's still in the basement for four months because he can't leave until we develop that faith yeah cuz he said he won't lose none so in order for that to be true he got to make sure we get the type of faith that we need so we can take a Rapture but I don't know about you but I'm looking to go up one of these mornings amen yes sir and this in is he's trying to get us to go back to that Faith yes sir that original faith that the Pentecostal fathers had and and and and he said am Malachi folk came to do that came to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and and and and we we got to develop that Faith yes sir so if you got your Bibles let's turn to I try not to it's imperative I'm going have to use this scripture tonight Psalms 82 I I don't see no way around it tonight I'm going to have to use Psalm 82 tonight and you know brother B say the Sheep will take the spirit of the pastor all right and and I I don't believe we just here by chance I mean I believe there's a special group of people here that's designed just for the ministry that's here and know I was talking to brother Stephen in the back and we was talking about it I believe I said your ministry is designed for a certain class of people it's not for everybody so so you know and and I even had someone I even had someone to throw shadeed at me because of this message because of what I teach and what I believe but but my message was that when when we came here I seen a line of cars at Burger King I've seen a line of cars at McDonald's I've seen a line of cars at zby but they're all eating from two three different tables so let me eat at the table that I am if that makes sense you you're not going to find nobody in McDonald's lying worrying about a Whopper that's at Burger King you you let them be so so so if I believe this message you let me eat at this [Applause] table and that settles it you got you got to stand for something and and I'm not I'm not I'm usually not the type of person that will let people know but sometimes you got to let them know what you [Applause] believe sometimes you got to let them know what you believe Psalms 82 and we we know this verse God standeth in the congregation of the mighty yes sir and he judgeth among the gods amen you can be seated and I want to go to verse six as well and verse seven this this is what I need uhh I have said ye are Gods sir and all of you are children of the most high in verse seven says but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes that's right so by the help of this board I'm going try to use this board this this go I have to do this tonight glory to God amen amen here we go yes sir so we got verse six and we got verse seven yes sir which we all know that verse six is the Divine verse yes my brother which I'm I'm I'm going to say God cuz that's what we are tonight and verse seven is is is the human part yes sir amen okay yes sir my title tonight is a testimony by faith a testimony by faith and I'm I'm not I'm not talking about that testimony after you receive what it is you want we we we talking about if you want to call it a pre- testimony and and and this testimony only lives by faith because you testifying about something you haven't received yet or you testifying about something that that you can't see with the natural eye so we we want to talk about a testimony by faith tonight my brother now brother brandham talks about two levels of faith and and he calls he calls one is the human Faith that's exactly which is your natural Faith yes sir and and and you know you this this is carnal you know no this is the type of faith that you possess as a natural human being that's right and the second level he talks about is which is God's faith yes my brother which is the supernatural Faith or the Divine Faith yes sir and and that that is what this guy possess the supernatural Faith or that Divine faith that Faith to believe things that you can't see that it exist and the human this human faith it can only go so far but bam says see this this faith has no power this Faith right here has no power the only thing this this this person right here can do this part of you can do is produce the testimony about this guy that that's the further that this part of you can go is a testimony yes sir and and and and and believe it or not the testimony of this guy is what pleases this guy God God say he pleased with a testimony by faith so if you want to please God you got to have a testimony by faith and by the help of the Lord we're going to show that to you tonight hope that the Holy Ghost will can reveal that to you tonight in the message blind bmus yes sir in 1956 brother ber says you're a wonderful set of people he said I don't believe you can find any any more faith is what I mean to as what would call what we would call and and he goes on and say I'll explain it to Mara the levels of Faith you see what human faith is and what divine faith is yes sir he says one of them is the human faith and the other is the is the one is the Divine Faith that's right and then he goes on in the message of faith is our Victory and he says but I will say this after this thing I preach conviction to myself he said I believe if you would just be reverent and just take all the faith that you got as human faith and turn it over into the hands of God and say now Lord take my little I got to give you and let your faith come to me I believe that he he'll heal you and let me call you right out from this platform without even you coming up here at all so butter Bron was was saying you know this Congregation of people they came to but Brown on meetings because they they they seen the healing the healing that he was doing the healing campaign that he was doing the these people weren't Christians some of these people weren't Christians but they believe if they could have got the brother BR they could they could get healed so so they brother bham saying if if you could have enough Faith right to believe in him that to believe that the God that was in him that could perform whatever that that he wanted that they could get it so so so that that's going to show you that that this guy well brother bam is saying the faithful lever in this guy can only go so far that's right so so so what so the job of the faith level in this guy is to believe that God is able to perform that which what he want and that pleases God and and and that what makes God come down see God come down he takes the look the faith that you have in him and then he comes down and mix his facei with yours and bring it to pass see see only in this faith if there's no waver wavering in this Faith all things come to pass in this Faith you always get results in this Faith there's a limitation on that human Faith let's go to this message uh be Be not Afraid be not afraid it is be not afraid it is I in 1961 and brother Brenham says this he said there's only one One Faith and that's the faith of God Amen God's faith yes he says your human Faith don't go very far but God's faith in you yes brother so so so there's two levels of it but but there's only one kind and that's and that's that's the faith of God and that's what God's going to honor his word he's only going to honor his faith but he's pleased when you can take your human faith and believe that He's [Music] Able you'll bear with me for a minute the message the Queen of Sheba am man and he says but bam says he said always remember Church God's word are true I believe the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass he said if you can look at look at it in the right way he said but remember here's being my standard in life yes I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not he said then I know it's God 's will the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it he said then if it's the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith that it'll be done because first is the will of God and I have and my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory see so there is no selfish motives about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something why you will never succeed he say and then try to do something outside of the will of the Lord then it won't work it begin with so there is genuine Faith yes sir but you must come to into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith he said there is human Faith then there's faith of God and you must have that Godly Faith to believe to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you then that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations and all these things come by the mind of Christ being in you you get it let the mind that was in Christ be in you yes sir that's why Jesus was so boldly when he approached situations because he had the mind of Christ and he said I do nothing unless the father show me so he already had the vision before he even went to approach the problem so so when you pray for thus sayth the Lord and God can reveal to you that it's thus sayth the Lord there's no room for doubt there's no room for doubt so that's the correct way you go you won't just said the Lord so once God reveal to you that whatever you want is what he want then you have no room for doubt then you can approach that situation boldly why because God has shown me thust said the Lord this is for me this is for me can't nobody take it away from me cuz God showed me so the devil can't talk me out of that cuz God revealed it to [Applause] me and and and and that and that's what you want that's what you want sir Hallelujah GL to God in the Church age thou has not denied my faith it says in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his u in jesus' name through faith right in Jesus name have made this man former strong y the faith which is by him Jesus have given him this perfect soundness in in the presence of you all see there it is Jesus name and Jesus Jesus Faith brought about the miracle right Peter did Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name he said that Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work yes sir this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2:13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers brother in Romans 12:3 according as God have dealt to every man according to verse one the men or Brethren The Measure of Faith and then Ephesians chap 2:8 Say by grace are you saved through faith and that faith is not of yourself it is a gift of God and it also says in James 2 verse1 my brother have not the faith of have not the faith of in our Lord Jesus Christ with respect the persons right and it says in this in this pergament age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord having cast aside the doctrines of election and open wide the church door and their Fellowship to any and all who who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only used that faith in Acts of power but with stood those who darare to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus himself yes sir as today church is filled with mental believers who endur the Virgin birth and shed blood going to the church and taking communion or not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human Faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with [Music] hands now let's turn to the book of Hebrews yes Hebrews 10 chapter 10 chapter 10 verse 38 now we going to get into the to the subject a testimony by faith and verse 38 says now the just shall live by faith right but if any man draw back my soul should have no pleasure in him verse 39 said but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul so so so God God is saying right here he's not pleased when you when when you draw back from the faith that's exactly right he's not pleased and we and we want to go on and go to Hebrews 11 And1 Wonder Hebrews 11 And1 say now Faith is the substance of things hoped for yes sir and it's the evidence of things not seen right so this is this this is your evidence this this faith is the only thing that that you have as evidence that proves that you believe that it's going to come to pass that there there's not anything else that you can put in that spot right there am there there's nothing that you can do that shows evidence of something that you haven't received yet it takes Faith to stick right there that's the only proof that you can have this is what God is saying and we want to go to uh Hebrews 11 verse 5 it says by faith yes sir Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God has translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God yes sir what is this testimony Enoch had Enoch was looking for a Rapture uhuh and he belied it was coming that's the reason he went walking every day went walking down King's Highway cuz he believed that the Rapture was coming right so a testimony by faith yes sir when you testify by faith right and and the about and I'm going to get to this in a minute but the Bible said without faith without works faith is dead with no works is dead so that mean you got to do something so so it's requiring you to do something and I know sometimes we sit back and have and believe oh God just going to deliver me but God say he's not pleasing unless you testify go God say he is pleased when you testify before before your deliverance he say remember me after the Deliverance he said but you testify before the Deliverance he said in in in in this testimony before before you get delivered I am pleased in verse six in verse six says this it said but without faith it is impossible to please him that's right for he that cometh to God must believe that he is so he that cometh to God yes sir must believe that he is that's right he you must believe that he is and God saying when you come to me you must believe that I am more than able to perform that which is what you need he said when you come to me you must believe that's right and he say and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he's saying it ain't just enough for you to come to him and believe that he is who he is he said but you also must believe that he is rewarded to them that seek him so so what he's saying is you must believe that God is going to do whatever it is not just do it but he going to do it for you wonderful sir so so number one when you approach God yes sir you must believe that he he is who he say he is that he's able to give you able to perform he able to back his word up and then after that number two you got to believe that he going to do that for you see and see that makes it personal that he going to do it for me so so now that's when that genuine Faith ks in so so if if that's why it's important to know that you are God cuz this here is the foundation of of the rest of the thing if you don't believe you God you can't take hold to that genuine Faith you first got to believe that you a God so so then you believe that God going to do it for you why he going to do it for you because you are God [Music] amen we talking about gen the Believers possess that genuine Faith yes my brother that that that unwavering faith that that faith that bring all things to pass you you always get results there there's no guessing this is is th sayith the Lord am am and Jesus said I do nothing unto the father show me that's it and then and then in one verse he said my words are not my words so he he said my words are not my words and I do nothing until the father show me so so basically if his words is not his word then who words are they so it's God talking to God that's exactly what going on it's God talking to God so so so if you catch the Revelation that you are God so so when you go talk to God so now you know that it's God talking to God you you see what I'm saying You must believe that ye are God so then you won't struggle did no wonder Jesus say father you always hear me when I pray because Jesus Jesus know he was God if you if you take butter Charles and stick him in the room by himself and he begin to talk to himself brother Charles begin to talk to himself he going to always hear Brother Charles he going to always hear Brother Charles why because but Charles is the one talking so Jesus knew he was God so whenever he approach God he know God always heard him because this his words wasen his words it was God talking through him so it was God talking back to God you don't think God hear himself talking so God is talking to God he always hear himself talking so you must believe that you are God's tonight so you won't struggle When you pray you won't struggle when you approach God you know every prayer is going through because it's God talking to [Applause] [Music] God but B say how you going to take Rapture you don't have enough faith for Divine Healing you must have faith in a Rapture you got to believe that you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] God that's why Jesus was so boldly he didn't worry about nothing he was he he was calm because he had dust say the Lord and and and and if and if he didn't see he waited on the vision he tered he waited on it he waited till the vision came once he got hold of the vision once he got a hold of the vision the devil couldn't do nothing else with him because he already seen it and he knew it was going to come to pass and and and think about I'm thinking about Lazar right now when they when they came to Jesus um they tell him Lazarus was sick he wasn't dead yet that's right when when he first got the message they told him your friend is sick take your time he is sick take your time but brother Brown said he believed God showed him a vision he said he seen Lazarus he said but it didn't go then but the vision was raising him from the [Applause] dead he couldn't go there God God sent him somewhere else to do another work because Jesus had saw the vision he raised him from the dead so Jesus say I'll just go over here until he take place till he die to the vision fulfilled he got to wait on the vision to fulfill and then he turned around and say I think I'll go wake Lazarus because Jesus has seen brother B say he seen the vision when he noticed that Lazarus had already passed then he went that way now all things are in place now all things are in place see that that's why God don't come when you want him that's why he don't come when you want him if he come when you want him it'll throw the vision off if he if he come when you want him to come it will throw the vision off it'll mess the vision up but he's always on time you might be going through something right now you might be facing a test you might be facing a trial he ain't showed up yet but just wait have faith because it ain't time yet if he come rescue you now he rescue you now he'll break the [Applause] vision so so so whatever it is between that time frame that you want God to come on the scene right now and between the time that he get there there's something that he want you to get out of that period of [Music] [Applause] time there's something he want you to get out of that period of time come it's it's something that you don't know about it but it's something that he want you to get out of that period of time and and it might be just a simple things or just raising Faith or raising your faith level as an individual within yourself hallu and Enoch had a testimony by faith and and and God and God is plainly stating in his word say this is the only way for you to please me I I I like I like when you testify after you receive receive it God is saying I love when when you make mention of me showing what I did for you he said but it pleases me when you testify of me [Applause] beforehand he he say this is what pleases me and he say if you don't if you don't do it this way I'm not pleased [Applause] [Music] in the message faith is the [Music] substance we're going to get we're going to get somewhere we're going to get somewhere faith is the substance 1947 it said faith we got to get in such a place till we be translated like Enoch was that's right Faith testimony that it pleased God did not Enoch or following scripture said that Enoch had a testimony right by faith that he pleased God uhhuh is that right right and the Bible said without faith is impossible to please God that's right so you got to have that same kind of faith that you believe and [Applause] know now we let's go to Genesis chapter 40 oh man clock getting away let's go to Genesis of chapter 40 amen wonderful see see can I get through much of this as I can verse 14 yes sir we going we're going to come out the basement for a minute we going we going go back in P house just for a second we going we going to regroup for just a second yes sir vers verse 14 he says he said but think on me yes sir when it shall be well with thee and show kindness I pray me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house all right we we got one the first thing he said was what think on me which was remember me yes sir and number two he say show kindness can everybody see the board number three mention me or yes sir okay we already know four mean Deliverance so so we already know that but but but but what I want you to see from this am he says remember me and show kindness yes sir mention me which is mean to testify there is no Deliverance [Applause] help me [Applause] Lord there's no Deliverance without a [Applause] testimony God he said testify me and then Deliverance come so God God is showing you the order he's showing you the order how it's supposed to be done you you can't operate Faith right here you you you can't operate Faith right here this is the only spot that you can that you can bring Faith In Action this the only place that you can bring Faith in so so God is saying you testify before your deliverance [Music] [Applause] then once you delivered you remember me you show kindness remember what I did for you it's a repeating cycle it's a repeat cycle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] testify I bring you out remember what I did for you show kindness then once you reach your next battle you testify me again and I bring you out remember me show [Applause] kindness Jes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the and the butler sir he forgot to testify two years went by two years went by but but but two years went by but notice there was no Deliverance until his testimony came [Applause] [Music] for there was no Deliverance until his testimony came for so I'm telling you tonight you got to testify testify testify what God is able to do testify what he doing for you testify that you already know it's done if you sick you already healed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] H thank you Lord if we go to chapter 41 and it and it and it tells you that verse one it says and it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven well favored King and fat flesh and they fed and a metal so God God is having pharaoh to have a dream right so so let let's let's let's look at this yes yes wonderful I'm trying to skip some so I can save time said go go down to go down to um verse 12 at this point it say and there and there was there with us a young man so here here's the part when the butler begin to testify now watch this testimony if if you know if you if you look at this testimony when when the when the butler begin to testify his his testimony wasn't about [Music] himself not not one time did he tell Pharaoh what he could do his testimony was not about himself but his testimony was about what Joseph could [Music] do Joseph taught [Music] [Applause] Christ so so he began to talk about what what Joseph was able to do when I was locked up Joseph was able to interpret this dream to me and and and by faith he had Faith to believe that Joseph was able to come and interpret the dream for cuz he was taking a chance so just because he interpreted his Dre don't mean he could interpret his but he had faith and Joseph cuz cuz he had a he had a walk a top he had a walk a Top Line he just came out of prison so he didn't want to mess up anymore but he had enough faith in Joseph to believe that if I tell Pharaoh that Joseph is able I believe that Joseph can perform and and and and that's what God is saying You must come to me you must believe that I'm able to perform that which is is what you want and that I'm going to do it for you oh man and think about the woman with the issue of blood and and we know her condition we know what her condition was yes sir she went 12 years with with this condition and and and they talk about her story how she she spent all her money she went to all kind of doctors and but but but some some kind of way after 12 years she developed up enough faith that if I can touch the H of His Garment and and and and that's what she had faith in and and and her testimony if you want to know her testimony was her testimony was when she pressed her way through the crowd get to him the Bible say without works is dead so what are what are you doing tonight that says that you believe that God's going to can perform what are you doing what what what are you doing what are you putting in AC and what kind of works are you putting in action that PS that that that tells God that he's able so and the prophet of God talks about it I can't I can't get into it but I'm I'm just going to tell it like this he talked about how she pressed her way through the crowd and and and this woman was an outcast she was the outcast to the economy she wasn't supposed to be around nobody but she she risk her life and pressed her way to get to that garment because she had faith that if I could touch to him with that garment I was going to be made whole and and and you got to put her shoes on but but B say she came low say she came real low he said she was so low every now and then she would pop her head up to see how far she had to go he said then she would get down and she but go real low matter of fact when she when Jesus came when Jesus came through uhhuh if you know the story yes he was actually on his way to jarus house yes cuz jar jarus had just left him and told him that his daughter was sit right he was on his way to Jerry's house but in the midst of him going there she slipped in by faith and touched the him of His Garment so so that's why that's why the Bible said don't neglect to assemble yourselves in the house because because you might not have enough Faith to bring God down but but out of all the people in here it only take one of y'all to bring them down if you can get him down then I can touch him right here I can touch him I can touch this is the best place you can be right here and The House of the Believers yes sir look how many chances you got in here to bring God down look around look around so many chances it don't take but one to bring him down so if I'm coming to here and I'm weak and I ain't able to quiet bring him down if if but self got enough Faith this service this service right here to bring him down then I'm pleased with that long as he in the building then I can get what I [Applause] [Music] need and and she had so much Faith she only had faith in Touching to him with that garment but brother brand say when she when she touched that garment say she turned around he saying she went back in the crowd that's it so so that told me this woman had no intentions of having a conversation with Jesus she had no intentions of talking to him having no conversation her faith was If I Could Touch to him with that garment and I could be made whole and that what she had faith in that what she received but her testimony she pressed away to get there cuz she believed that she got there it was going to be done in the shite woman she had she had Faith she had Faith yes sir the prophet gave her a son prayed for her to get a son and then he died but when she she wanted to go see the prophet about why he died and and and if you know the story I can't read it all if you know the story when she was getting ready to go to the get the prophet her husband say why why are you going up there say he's not there that's what her husband told her he said he's not there he say it's neither new moon or the Sabbath say he's not there so there was particular times when Elijah would be on MAR karma when he would consecrate himself but she had enough Faith that's it that she was going there and that he was going to be there that's it and surely when she got that he was there that's right he was there and he said the Lord had hid this for me he said the Lord don't reveal Everything To His prophets that's right and he didn't know what was her problem but what I'm saying is her faith caused him to be at a place that he normally wouldn't be just like the but B say the suite woman held that plane down it was her f that held that plane and you you you got to have faith in something and her faith was in the prophet because he tried to send his staff down there he he told he told gazel to take my staff down there but the the woman didn't have she didn't have faith in the staff she had but B say she didn't have no faith in that staff she had faith in Elijah oh boy amen but God is pleased with that type of testimony sir and what about you and me tonight we got the fullness of God the God have about living on the inside of us genuine faith that we possess on the inside of us we got dust say the Lord walking in us that should be not no reason why while we struggling with faith sir if you know that you are God yes sir yes my brother you could come on music come on music and and I I just I got so much here I'm I can't get it all out but uh it it's it's it's a test I mean it's real simple a testimony by faith testimony by faith and God God God saying this pleases me this pleasing me so so my my my my in my conclusions don't don't don't wait around till after the fight start testifying now start testifying now if if you sick start testifying you he start testifying you he start acting like you he but Bown say keep going saying I'm Healed just just keep going and and and and it's only at that point in your life that you able to
