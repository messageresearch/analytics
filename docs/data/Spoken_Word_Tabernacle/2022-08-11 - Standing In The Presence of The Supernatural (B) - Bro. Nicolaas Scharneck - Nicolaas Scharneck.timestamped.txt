[0:08] i have spent my days believing
[0:13] that what he have me be
[0:18] is who i am
[0:20] [Music]
[0:22] as i come to see
[0:25] the deeper side of me

[0:33] i
[0:34] realize his graces
[0:37] what i need
[0:42] i seen the man of justice
[0:47] for my soul

[2:19] as midnight fell on
[2:23] crucifixion day
[2:25] [Music]
[2:28] the light of hope
[2:32] seems so far away
[2:38] as satan tries to stop redemption
[2:44] but mercy says no

[2:53] i'm not gonna let you slip away

[3:33] i'm not gonna let you slip away
[3:38] you don't have to be afraid
[3:42] mercy said no
[3:52] [Music]
[3:57] as darkness tried to steal my heart away
[4:06] but thank you jesus

[26:11] and it came to pass that as he as the
[26:14] people pressed upon him
[26:17] to hear the word of god he stood by the
[26:20] lake
[26:21] he he never
[26:22] had other things
[26:25] he never kept him busy with other things
[26:28] people were always pressing around him
[26:30] for the word and
[26:32] jesus was always kept busy with the word
[26:35] there was no business deals and
[26:37] you know trying to find
[26:39] a network where you can have wi-fi and
[26:42] stream no he was always busy
[26:44] with the work of god he stood by the
[26:46] lake
[26:47] of januzaret
[26:49] and saw two ships
[26:51] standing by the lake
[26:53] but the fishermen were gone out of them
[26:56] and they were washing their nets
[26:59] and he entered into one of those ships
[27:02] which was simon's
[27:04] and prayed him that he would trust
[27:06] out
[27:07] a little from the land
[27:10] amen
[27:11] he wanted to see the people better he
[27:12] wanted to just get a little
[27:14] pulpit there and
[27:16] really see the people as he preached the
[27:18] word
[27:18] out of little from the land and he sat
[27:21] down
[27:21] and taught the people out of the ship
[27:24] oh my you could have imagined the
[27:26] atmosphere for those people
[27:30] standing in the presence
[27:32] of the supernatural
[27:34] oh my anything was about to happen the
[27:36] supernatural was there he was their
[27:38] brothers and sisters
[27:40] now when he had left speaking he said
[27:43] unto simon
[27:44] launch out into the deep
[27:47] and let down your nets
[27:49] for a little drought for drought
[27:51] oh my
[27:53] something was about to happen
[27:55] something was about to take place
[27:58] and simon answered and said unto you
[28:00] master master
[28:03] we have toiled
[28:04] all night
[28:06] and have taken nothing
[28:09] nevertheless
[28:11] and i would
[28:13] i will let down
[28:14] the net heavenly father bless us now as
[28:18] we have read your word
[28:19] father lord jesus we are
[28:22] standing in your presence
[28:24] and lord jesus something is about to
[28:27] happen
[28:28] and we are under expectation lord

[28:54] hallelujah
[28:55] i wonder
[28:57] you know
[28:58] maybe some of you has
[29:00] listened to the testimony
[29:02] but i feel that just we have to
[29:05] share one or two of these testimonies
[29:08] you know and
[29:10] i went to the amazon and
[29:12] and i ministered for four weeks
[29:15] it was quite a difficult time it was a
[29:18] it was it was it was tough territory
[29:21] i would love to ask our young people
[29:23] make sure before you get married you
[29:25] know i know you want to get married you
[29:27] want to get a wife and start and and you
[29:30] know but but before you get into that
[29:32] face
[29:34] do me one favor travel a little bit
[29:37] you know just form a missionary group
[29:40] and save some money
[29:42] and go to these places
[29:44] because some of these places that i went
[29:47] you know your age your age is catching
[29:50] up with us i'm almost 50. i'm i'm not
[29:53] old but it's catching up with us because
[29:55] i was thinking
[29:56] when i was on the boat it was it's like
[29:59] a banana boat a very small boat you can
[30:01] google that you will see those little
[30:03] boats that are used on the amazon river
[30:06] you know with all the anacondas and the
[30:07] alligators around you
[30:09] all those big spiders and all those
[30:12] those dangerous animals if you are
[30:15] younger you can easily escape from those
[30:17] animals
[30:18] but if you are my age and your pastor's
[30:20] age if you fell from that boat
[30:23] i mean how long will it take for me to
[30:25] swim away from oncoming anaconda coming
[30:28] behind me but if you are young
[30:32] amen god can use you
[30:34] hallelujah don't wait until you stand
[30:36] behind this desk
[30:38] and and then just wait until the past
[30:40] retires then you can start to preach
[30:41] here you have a big platform out there
[30:44] there's a huge pulpit outside there
[30:48] in all those remote areas

[35:26] country
[35:27] you know and it was just pressing me to
[35:30] take the offering and
[35:32] i said lord i cannot take the offering

[35:37] rather let them
[35:38] have the money and you know do something
[35:42] for for the brothers and sisters around
[35:44] the area

[35:54] i said lord how
[35:56] can i have this offering while i'm here
[35:58] lord and
[36:00] knowing the needs are a bigger year than
[36:03] needs at home
[36:06] you know and
[36:07] that was about 1 500 dollars
[36:12] from poor people
[36:14] i said lord i cannot take this money
[36:17] i was about
[36:19] 9 000
[36:21] rice
[36:23] brazilian rice about 1
[36:25] dollars
[36:26] in cash
[36:28] i said lord i cannot take this money
[36:29] home
[36:31] what should i do with this money spoke
[36:33] to my wife
[36:34] and i said sweetheart i've been with
[36:36] these people you know i
[36:37] i don't know but i cannot take this
[36:39] money home
[36:40] she said i asked he said what should i
[36:42] do with the money
[36:43] she said to me okay let's walk on let's
[36:46] work on something
[36:47] she said what you do you had you have
[36:49] three translators there that have
[36:50] translated for you spanish and in
[36:52] portuguese
[36:53] tried to give each one of them a
[36:55] thousand
[36:57] then you know so
[36:59] so i put the money into my envelopes in
[37:01] my room
[37:02] and then i had
[37:04] i had no i two translators i gave them
[37:06] each one a thousand i had it in the
[37:08] envelope and i had about seven thousand
[37:09] left
[37:12] and
[37:13] the lord ministered to me
[37:15] there was a family
[37:17] that i have seen for the last for the
[37:19] few days that i've been there
[37:21] you know in one village and i
[37:23] had such a pull to them
[37:27] i had such a pull to that family
[37:29] and i also wondered why
[37:31] this pool
[37:32] and the lord just ministered to me
[37:35] to give the rest of the offering to the
[37:36] family and took seven thousand of that
[37:39] put it in one envelope and i closed the
[37:41] envelope
[37:42] and after the meetings it was my last
[37:43] meeting it was a sunday evening
[37:46] at the very sunday after that meeting i
[37:47] had to leave back three hours drive to
[37:50] terrazina and from there when i take a
[37:52] flight
[37:53] you know uh back to sao paulo but before
[37:55] i could get to sao paulo i had to take
[37:57] four flights out of the amazon to get to
[38:00] sao paulo
[38:02] so just before the service
[38:05] i asked my translator one of my
[38:07] brother's brothers from germany a young
[38:10] brother came to me he came actually to
[38:12] help to translate to me from germany a
[38:14] young brother he came to translate for
[38:17] me in portuguese
[38:19] and
[38:20] he i said to him brother carlos please
[38:23] brother now i will ask this family
[38:25] personal questions
[38:27] so please make sure you translate good
[38:29] for me because i wanted to know
[38:31] something
[38:32] i realized that they the situation was
[38:35] not good the brother works for foot for
[38:38] four forty forty dollars a month
[38:41] he drives on a scooter bike throughout
[38:43] delivering gas bottles
[38:45] so what can you do guys with forty
[38:47] dollars
[38:49] i'm talking about per month that's what
[38:51] he earns per month forty dollars
[38:53] a month
[38:57] i asked him a little bit questions and
[38:58] asked him about his house and he said to
[39:00] me nikki
[39:02] um
[39:04] we're staying in a little place here i
[39:06] saw the place it is it's not good you
[39:08] wouldn't even allow
[39:09] as brazil was always mentioning it in
[39:11] the camp meetings you only allow your
[39:13] dogs or your chickens to live in there
[39:16] but these are the areas that people
[39:17] lived in
[39:19] and i said do you have your own house he
[39:21] says no we have a we have a place a
[39:24] house but unfortunately we cannot stay
[39:27] in the house
[39:28] because of the condition of the house
[39:31] we don't have money and for for about
[39:33] seven years we have tried to save up
[39:36] money to see if we can
[39:39] get the house to be
[39:41] so we can get into the house
[39:43] and i said to him brother
[39:45] how much do you need
[39:47] to fix the house
[39:49] to get into your own house
[39:52] says so that your wife
[39:55] can start to prepare
[39:58] to have a baby
[40:00] i said to him goddess withhold this baby
[40:02] from you because you don't have your own
[40:04] place
[40:06] says brother i need about 5000.
[40:10] to be able to fix that building
[40:12] that little house
[40:14] and put some electricity in and fix it
[40:16] in and out
[40:18] so that we can get in
[40:19] and i went to my back
[40:22] and i said to brother i have something
[40:23] for you and i took out the envelope and
[40:25] i said to him here is seven thousand
[40:29] go home
[40:30] and fix your house
[40:32] says after these meetings
[40:34] you go home
[40:37] and fix the house
[40:40] and you and your wife
[40:42] start preparing for that miracle baby
[40:45] had you been waiting for eight years now
[40:48] god is gonna give you that
[40:50] baby hallelujah
[40:53] and in the meantime
[40:56] i was praying
[40:58] for god to
[40:59] provide for me because the car that i
[41:02] drive
[41:03] was
[41:04] already i need to replace my car
[41:08] i have to replace my car
[41:12] and i never
[41:13] realized
[41:15] that i was actually planting seed
[41:20] i'm a farmer
[41:22] i'm a farmer
[41:24] i know the principle of seed
[41:28] and what power lays within the seed
[41:32] and the energy that's in that sea to
[41:34] bring forth
[41:37] so if you doesn't know what it is to
[41:39] plant seed
[41:40] tonight
[41:42] you start tonight
[41:44] you start tomorrow
[41:47] because you cannot
[41:49] plant and not have a house
[41:53] i was praying
[41:56] for the lord to help me
[41:59] to have a
[42:01] a proper vehicle
[42:04] for the mission field
[42:06] because the one i'm driving now
[42:09] is about almost
[42:11] half a million kilometers on
[42:14] 500 000 kilometers
[42:16] on the clock
[42:18] it needs to be replaced
[42:22] and in the meantime
[42:25] god was waiting for me
[42:28] to plant the seed
[42:32] in my money
[42:34] that money would have been
[42:36] 48 000
[42:38] and to have 48 000 in my country
[42:42] i could have take that offering and go
[42:44] home
[42:46] and
[42:46] maybe
[42:48] spend it
[42:50] or you know
[42:52] it's 48 000
[42:55] but i
[42:56] invested it
[42:58] into the kingdom of god
[43:02] amen
[43:05] and i want to encourage you tonight
[43:06] brothers and sisters
[43:09] and this testimony is to encourage you
[43:14] and to build up your faith
[43:17] to realize
[43:19] that
[43:20] when you stand
[43:23] in the presence of god all things are
[43:27] possible
[43:31] just say the right word
[43:34] and what you ask
[43:36] shall be given to
[43:38] you amen
[43:43] there is nothing
[43:45] so comfortable
[43:47] is when you are a missionary
[43:49] remember i have been watching my dad
[43:52] for many years how you suffered
[43:56] with old cars
[43:58] in my country
[44:00] always his hands was full of oil
[44:03] many times he would come behind the desk
[44:06] and his hands will be pitch black
[44:09] oil under his nails
[44:11] and then he would come and preach
[44:13] one time one brother asked him are you a
[44:15] preacher or are you a mechanic
[44:19] it's not nice
[44:21] because always he has to be underneath
[44:23] the car
[44:25] fixing the car young people
[44:28] you know sometimes we would drive
[44:31] and the exhaust underneath will break
[44:33] into pieces
[44:35] then what we would do
[44:36] i will just try to get the can you know
[44:38] the scan the peanut butter cans the the
[44:41] metal ones
[44:43] i will just get one of those and i would
[44:44] cut it in the middle
[44:46] open it up like that and i would lay
[44:48] underneath and go and join those two
[44:50] pieces of the exhaust together and i
[44:52] would use that can bring it together use
[44:55] a wire here and a wire there and there
[44:57] we go
[45:01] then we can go from one meeting to
[45:03] another meeting
[45:05] and when you go to the next bomb the
[45:07] exhaust breaks again
[45:13] you know how great blessing it is
[45:17] when you are a missionary
[45:19] and you can get into a proper vehicle
[45:22] after you have so many meetings
[45:25] night after night you have to start a
[45:28] car
[45:28] and you get into it and you drive home
[45:31] maybe in a thousand miles or more
[45:34] but you know how painful it is
[45:37] when you have to open the bonnet
[45:39] and use a screw dryer to start a car
[45:45] you have to start it right there by the
[45:46] starter there's a little ball there and
[45:49] you connect that ball to the there's
[45:51] another bolt on the other side and you
[45:53] touch them like this
[45:54] [Laughter]
[45:56] you hold it and it goes
[45:58] and when it starts you close and you
[46:00] jump in
[46:01] [Music]
[46:08] and i said lord
[46:11] i'm your servant
[46:18] i need a good vehicle
[46:21] i need a strong car
[46:23] to get in and drive
[46:26] and preach the gospel
[46:31] amen
[46:34] i came from the amazon
[46:39] maybe you put up these lies brothers and
[46:42] give us more good quality here on the on
[46:44] the screen here
[46:45] because i want to give show you the
[46:47] testimony
[46:50] brother called
[46:51] i planned the seat
[46:55] and he said brother nikki
[46:58] i want to do something for you
[47:00] for the work of the lord
[47:03] and i want to bless you my brother
[47:06] so you go and collect your blessing
[47:10] without money
[47:12] without price
[47:14] but before that blessing could come
[47:17] i had to take one thousand five hundred
[47:19] dollars
[47:21] and give it to a family
[47:23] to get a little home fix
[47:27] right there in the deep amazon village
[47:34] put this on the screen the testimony
[47:36] brother
[47:39] i tell you i did not even had hours in
[47:42] this car
[47:43] i came i just you know i went to pick it
[47:46] and my little girl said to me daddy
[47:48] i want to go with you when you go to
[47:51] collect this miracle
[47:53] i want to go with you
