[46:13] listening to the message of the hour
[46:15] somehow amen amen amen at least you got
[46:18] to listen to the message of the hour you
[46:20] cannot go one week without the bread of
[46:24] Joseph amen the only way you can
[46:28] withstand famine you got to have the
[46:30] bread of Joseph amen amen glory to God
[46:34] God will show you what is the bread of
[46:36] Joseph shortly amen glory to God Lord's
[46:40] willing on uh December 16th we have the
[46:45] Young's men meeting and all the
[46:47] information will be sent in the group
[46:49] chat and uh December the 23rd this is
[46:53] when we have our question and answer and
[46:55] I said a message to the young uh adult
[46:59] uh group about the young Sisters Meeting
[47:01] I have not gotten any feedback yet so
[47:04] you tell me what we supposed to be doing
[47:08] so we talked about finances in a
[47:10] personal aspect and we have not gotten
[47:13] finances into the investment part yet
[47:16] but certain keys were given to the young
[47:20] sister to make sure they know how to
[47:21] handle their money and when they married
[47:24] they know how to budget their finances
[47:26] when they are home but before we move
[47:28] into the investment part I felt led to
[47:32] stop and to make sure I get some
[47:34] feedback on what we spoke and to know
[47:37] that the material was soaked in pretty
[47:39] good versus just getting it memorizing
[47:42] it and go and you don't use it then
[47:44] you're going to be find yourself into a
[47:46] trouble so you think over it you ponder
[47:49] it you send me question then the next
[47:51] time we sit down we talk a little bit
[47:53] more and we point certain areas that we
[47:56] didn't get pretty good then we can move
[47:59] on to the investment part because if you
[48:01] do not master the personal finances
[48:04] there is no way you're going to be
[48:06] successful in the business part like I
[48:09] said all over the country in the
[48:11] internet and if you look there is many
[48:13] books that are written about finances in
[48:15] this country and as as much as we have
[48:19] the knowledge of finances this country
[48:22] is
[48:24] broke a amen amen amen there is so many
[48:29] people in depth in this country versus
[48:32] the people that own everything why with
[48:36] all the knowledge that we have we still
[48:38] find ourselves in depth because there
[48:40] are certain keys and I proove you those
[48:42] keys by the scripture all of them by the
[48:44] scripture if you don't Master those keys
[48:47] No matter how much knowledge you're
[48:49] going to acquire for business or for
[48:51] finances you're going to find yourself
[48:53] in trouble because those key are the
[48:55] best Bic that you need to have in order
[48:58] to withstand what is coming out brother
[49:00] Bram say America is a bunch of slaves am
[49:03] if you need a can you say amen amen oh
[49:05] you right there so you say Amen louder
[49:07] Amen brother Bram say America is a BN of
[49:10] slave because the system the way the
[49:13] world was created from Eden When sin was
[49:16] introduced brother brandham Trac it all
[49:18] the way from Eden and then when he got
[49:20] to Babylon and we inherited the system
[49:22] of Babylon so we are trapped by birth
[49:26] and as you grow up and you go to school
[49:28] everything we learn in school we are
[49:30] learning it according to the system and
[49:33] once you are hooked pretty good in a
[49:35] system it's hard to break away from it
[49:38] and the only thing that can deliver you
[49:40] is the word of God Amen that's why we
[49:42] brought those principle from the word of
[49:44] God if you don't understand this
[49:47] principle you're going to get in trouble
[49:48] somehow amen amen but if you understand
[49:52] the principle they're very simple and
[49:54] you put them in in in place
[49:56] automatically you're going to build 12
[49:58] without any strength so I don't want you
[50:00] to memorize it and go and tomorrow some
[50:03] of you are broke or I find you with a
[50:06] bad credit score or something that is
[50:08] not going on or with big depth so it
[50:10] means that you didn't soak the material
[50:13] pretty good so wherever you are look at
[50:16] what you are where you struggling come
[50:18] back send me directly the question so he
[50:21] stays between me and the worshipper
[50:23] directly or put it in the box but if you
[50:25] put it in the Box make sure you say this
[50:27] is for the young Sisters Meeting then we
[50:29] can sit down and make sure we know how
[50:32] to budget we know that when your husband
[50:35] have a paycheck and he goes into direct
[50:37] deposit you know how to properly divide
[50:40] the
[50:42] money can you say amen amen you know how
[50:45] to properly divide the money and know
[50:47] what to do and don't put the family into
[50:49] depth because we want to eat too much or
[50:52] we trying to get something that is
[50:53] beyond our mean all of this I gave you
[50:56] from the scriptures so give me some
[50:58] feedback and I know what it is but if
[51:00] you say we are okay you understood
[51:02] everything then I'm going to jump into a
[51:05] big animal that is called investment and
[51:07] that's a different thing for you to
[51:09] understand so make sure we soaking
[51:11] before we get there amen amen you see
[51:13] there are older people here they wish
[51:15] they were in that meeting before you
[51:18] they are right there they can say Amen
[51:20] they wish they were in that meeting
[51:22] before you they learn it first before
[51:24] you
[51:25] [Laughter]
[51:29] amen I'm learning things in this message
[51:32] and the Lord is opening things in this
[51:34] message that I wish myself if I was in
[51:37] your shoes and I soak everything that
[51:40] I'm getting I will be far away than what
[51:42] I am here so you are most gracious to
[51:46] receive these things before you get
[51:48] married before you get in trouble before
[51:50] you mess up your credit God is unfolding
[51:52] these things to make sure you're
[51:54] successful amen amen amen amen so make
[51:57] sure you don't hear it but you do it
[52:00] amen because whatever Joseph say we
[52:04] do
[52:05] [Applause]
[52:08] amen glory be to God we have a baby
[52:12] dedication this morning and uh it's uh M
[52:18] Anto Scott Johns mommy's here Daddy's
[52:22] out of town he was unable to make it my
[52:25] mom is right there it's a family that is
[52:27] a big uh uh friend to brother Preston
[52:31] and uh they wanted to dedicate the baby
[52:33] the little one is there with the sibling
[52:36] and Mommy's there Mrs U Mary Scott so
[52:39] let's sing bring them in you know what
[52:42] before you do it let me read the quote
[52:44] so we make sure we finded everything in
[52:47] the scripture
[52:49] Amen in the Book of Luke 18 verse uh 15
[52:53] the Bible says and they brought unto him
[52:56] also what infants babies we clear that
[53:01] he will do what touch them and Jesus is
[53:04] not here today but brother Bram say he
[53:07] our hands are his hands amen amen amen
[53:10] he's using the bride's body he's using
[53:12] the church and Jesus said that he would
[53:15] touch them Luke say that he will touch
[53:17] them but when his disciples saw it they
[53:20] did what rebuked him but Jesus called
[53:22] them unto him and said suffer the
[53:25] children to come unto who and forbid
[53:29] them not for of such is the kingdom of
[53:33] God and brother Bram in the message
[53:35] talken he said you know when I see
[53:38] little fellows like this like that he
[53:41] always takes me back when I was a little
[53:43] boy and now the old saying is you know
[53:46] they on your feet now and your
[53:49] heart Le in other word when they grow up
[53:51] that's when they start giving you
[53:53] trouble but brother brandham say but
[53:55] that don't believe it'll be so when we
[53:59] dedicate them to the Lord so when we
[54:02] take our children and we give them to
[54:04] the Lord because they don't belong to us
[54:06] it's a gift that the Lord have given to
[54:08] us if we return back the gift to God
[54:11] automatically God is Duty man to protect
[54:14] those children even if they struggle
[54:16] through teenager because the doors has
[54:19] open up for the black dog and all kind
[54:21] of stuff the holy spirit will watch over
[54:23] them if we dedicate them to the Lord
[54:25] and brother I'm say we have a
[54:27] responsibility here and God placed this

[59:58] word I had a quot and I refrained to
[1:00:00] send the
[1:00:03] quot and the quote was speaking this but
[1:00:06] I'm going to read it and I found out

[1:00:11] it
[1:00:15] amen glory to
[1:00:18] God if I can find it quick it's not on
[1:00:21] the board here but brother Bram says in

[1:00:38] Amen if it's hard for you to go to

[1:00:46] the church is open there is something
[1:00:49] wrong with that
[1:00:50] spirit I wanted to send this morning he
[1:00:54] say is uh it is trying to keep you away
[1:00:57] from God the spirit of God will run you
[1:01:01] right straight to the church every time
[1:01:04] the door opens for
[1:01:07] Fellowship yes sir see so you got to be
[1:01:10] sure of this now the time is a hand amen
[1:01:15] I'm going to send it to you later on we
[1:01:17] must be in the house of the Lord the
[1:01:19] best that we can with everything that is
[1:01:22] happening with amas over there and
[1:01:24] Israel
[1:01:25] I don't know what you're looking at I
[1:01:27] don't know if you usually I'm not in the
[1:01:29] news but this one I follow because
[1:01:31] Israel it's a clock and I have to make
[1:01:34] sure I'm looking at the second and the
[1:01:36] minute and everything the way it's going
[1:01:38] on everything that you see happening
[1:01:40] there clearly it's in the Scripture it
[1:01:43] is a fulfillment of the prophecy so you
[1:01:46] need to be careful who you
[1:01:52] condemning you need to be careful what
[1:01:55] you're saying if you don't understand
[1:01:57] the word stay quiet but the scripture
[1:02:00] say you pray for the Peace of
[1:02:03] Jerusalem amen amen if I pull it from
[1:02:06] the scripture you'll be amazed how
[1:02:08] everything is L everything that you see
[1:02:11] is coming from the Bible am it is clear
[1:02:13] and only a prophetic Insight can get it
[1:02:16] amen because the the the whole world
[1:02:19] must come against Jerusalem according to
[1:02:22] the test according to the to the word
[1:02:25] according to the Bible and according to
[1:02:27] the message of the hour the whole entire
[1:02:30] world have to go against Jerusalem
[1:02:32] that's when we coming back to AR I mean
[1:02:35] in Armageddon but for you to go against
[1:02:38] Jerusalem something must be
[1:02:41] stirred let me leave it alone we'll
[1:02:44] catch up maybe one of these day I just
[1:02:47] want to shake you and tell you make sure
[1:02:50] you check your calling and election and
[1:02:53] make sure your faith is not a religious
[1:02:55] faith of coming to church and go home
[1:02:57] and leave any kind of way make sure you
[1:02:59] are ready for the going am you are ready
[1:03:01] for the coming of the Lord amen let's go
[1:03:04] to our scripture Genesis 41
[1:03:09] again I'm going to try again if I can
[1:03:12] cross the scripture and then get to the
[1:03:14] material okay we will try okay if we
[1:03:19] can't finish it then we wait until we
[1:03:21] cross the material so I can't move on
[1:03:23] until we cross the scripture and we go
[1:03:25] so in other word you need your Bible
[1:03:27] amen yeah never come to church without
[1:03:30] your
[1:03:32] Bible the message of the hour is a bible
[1:03:36] message if somebody tells you that the
[1:03:38] message take people away from the Bible
[1:03:41] they don't know what they're talking
[1:03:42] about or whoever preached to them the
[1:03:44] message preaches
[1:03:46] wrong because the message and the Bible
[1:03:48] are one amen amen let's pray Heavenly
[1:03:53] Father Lord Lord we are approaching you
[1:03:55] again humbly this morning Father we
[1:03:57] thank you for your grace your love your
[1:03:59] mercy and for everything you have been
[1:04:01] doing for us father this is as far as I
[1:04:04] can go with the ability you have given
[1:04:06] me but when it comes to the word and to
[1:04:09] interpret the word it is only something
[1:04:12] that the Holy Spirit himself Can Do Lord
[1:04:15] father may you move me completely out of
[1:04:17] the way may you come and speak to us and
[1:04:20] bless us Lord father let nothing of this
[1:04:23] weather affect the people people Lord
[1:04:25] may they forget about what is going on
[1:04:26] outside but if you can give us rain
[1:04:29] outside may you give us also rain on the
[1:04:31] inside Lord so that we can be blessed
[1:04:34] this morning and go home like the
[1:04:36] disciple on the road of EMAs saying Lord
[1:04:39] did not our heart burn within us as you
[1:04:41] spoke to us be the beginning and the
[1:04:43] ending of this service we move every
[1:04:45] demonic spirit away from us may you
[1:04:48] speak to our soul lord father may you
[1:04:50] help those that are backsliding in the
[1:04:53] name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen am let's
[1:04:57] go to Genesis 41 verse
[1:05:01] 28 if you dare you can say amen amen and
[1:05:05] the Bible says that this is the thing
[1:05:08] which I have spoken uh which I have
[1:05:10] spoken to Pharaoh what God is about to
[1:05:14] do he show to who Pharaoh we know that
[1:05:18] God was about to bring plenty and was
[1:05:21] about also to bring something that was
[1:05:23] bad which which is famine so both the
[1:05:25] plenty and the famine are coming from
[1:05:27] the Lord now you understand why famine
[1:05:29] should come amen verse 29 behold there
[1:05:33] come seven years of great plenty
[1:05:36] throughout all the land of Egypt and
[1:05:39] there shall arise after them seven years
[1:05:42] of water you might be seated and all the
[1:05:45] Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of
[1:05:48] Egypt in other word the famine will
[1:05:50] devour everything amen when when we
[1:05:54] talked about famine what is really
[1:05:57] coming behind famine is death that's
[1:06:00] right amen amen
[1:06:03] amen hold your finger where you are go
[1:06:06] to Revelation
[1:06:08] 6
[1:06:10] please so we see where we
[1:06:15] are you can go to Revelation
[1:06:21] 6 amen verse eight you know this clearly
[1:06:26] we went through the seals and I'm going
[1:06:28] to go back to Genesis you there yes and
[1:06:31] I look and behold a
[1:06:35] what a Pale Horse and his name that sat
[1:06:39] on him was
[1:06:41] water so the P horse his name is clear
[1:06:45] identified by the eag which is the
[1:06:47] fourth Beast the P horse you know this
[1:06:51] Clearly Now is death
[1:06:55] it's identified by the eagle it is the
[1:06:57] eagle anointing that is identifying
[1:07:00] death amen want to show you something
[1:07:03] and Hell follow with him and power was
[1:07:07] given to them death and Hell amen over
[1:07:11] the fourth part of the earth to do what
[1:07:15] to kill with what sword the sword and
[1:07:18] with
[1:07:19] what we clear so when hunger is coming
[1:07:23] it's a pale hor in
[1:07:26] disg are we together have i l somebody
[1:07:30] so
[1:07:32] famine
[1:07:34] famine which will bring hunger amen it's
[1:07:39] a
[1:07:41] riding of a p
[1:07:45] horse amen and if the P horse is coming
[1:07:49] the only way you can withstand the P
[1:07:52] horse you need an e
[1:07:55] we okay now by ego you need a
[1:08:00] prophet amen let's go back now to
[1:08:07] Genesis so when I give you this inside
[1:08:10] you know how we
[1:08:12] traveling Genesis 41 amen verse 30 and
[1:08:16] there shall arise after them seven years
[1:08:18] of famine and all the Plenty shall be
[1:08:21] forgotten in the land of Egypt and the
[1:08:24] famine shall consume the land we clear
[1:08:28] and the Plenty shall not be known in the
[1:08:31] land by reason of that fine following
[1:08:34] you understand what it means now for it
[1:08:36] shall be very Grievous and for that the
[1:08:40] dream was double to Pharaoh twice you
[1:08:43] understand the seven Church ages and the
[1:08:45] seal it is because the thing is
[1:08:47] established by who by God and God will
[1:08:51] shortly bring it to what yes we clear so
[1:08:56] the one who's opening the door for fine
[1:08:58] to strike is God but before that God
[1:09:01] send the plenty but the Plenty in the
[1:09:04] years of plenty there is a Ministry by
[1:09:06] the ministry of Joseph which we clearly
[1:09:09] identify last Sunday that Joseph was
[1:09:11] William Marian we clear on that one amen
[1:09:15] that's the one that has a Ministry to
[1:09:18] gather the food that
[1:09:20] escape amen I use the word lost last
[1:09:24] Sunday to match what brother Bram is
[1:09:26] saying even it's lost the way I mean uh
[1:09:30] the the terminology brother brandham
[1:09:32] says it's not really lost you cannot
[1:09:34] lose the word of God but it's a food
[1:09:36] that actually escaped the people or was
[1:09:39] not given to the people it was taken out
[1:09:43] from the people and it was stored for
[1:09:45] the time of famine so throughout the
[1:09:47] years of plenty you can never reach that
[1:09:50] food or you can never eat or be exposed
[1:09:53] to that food
[1:09:54] the food will always come when famine
[1:09:56] struck the land amen so the fif is what
[1:09:59] you need to withstand the famine so this
[1:10:03] famine that is coming with a pel horse
[1:10:05] bringing death can only be conquered by
[1:10:09] the fif amen which is the ministry of
[1:10:15] Joseph everybody okay if you're not in
[1:10:18] that Ministry if you don't have it
[1:10:20] you're going to die because it's going
[1:10:22] to conquer every single nation and he
[1:10:25] will kill and if you notice this famine
[1:10:27] was not in one place it was all over the
[1:10:31] world so there will be a famine that
[1:10:34] will come all over the world I will get
[1:10:37] you those scripture down the road if I
[1:10:39] can reach that level the fine will come
[1:10:41] all over the world and it will affect
[1:10:44] every single country and you got to find
[1:10:46] where is the wheat without the wi you
[1:10:49] going to find yourself in trouble amen
[1:10:51] we clear now amen are we claming okay
[1:10:53] amen so it's a it's a worldwide
[1:10:58] famine amen famine everywhere every
[1:11:03] country amen is affected every country
[1:11:07] is affected by the famine if you don't
[1:11:10] find food you're going to
[1:11:12] die because the fine is intended to
[1:11:16] destroy everything and the only
[1:11:18] resources you need is the fifth part
[1:11:21] that was taken or collected by Joseph so
[1:11:24] if you ask Joseph to give you food he
[1:11:27] will never give you the 80% he will give
[1:11:29] you the one that he have the fifth part
[1:11:32] but that fifth part represent every
[1:11:34] single year amen everybody okay amen and
[1:11:37] it is the fifth part the missing part
[1:11:40] that the devil will always attack you
[1:11:42] because they are the one you are already
[1:11:44] familiar to
[1:11:46] amen are we together if let me go this
[1:11:50] way so we can clim slowly if he takes 10
[1:11:54] keys for you if the devil attack people
[1:11:58] in 10 different ways and you only know
[1:12:01] eight you are still vulnerable to the
[1:12:04] devil that's right make sense that's
[1:12:06] right if the devil come like one you
[1:12:08] will face him and bat him if he comes
[1:12:11] like two or three you will face him and
[1:12:12] bat him but if the devil ever attack you
[1:12:15] with nine and 10 you will find out that
[1:12:18] it's a different combat it's a different
[1:12:21] battle it's a different weapon that you
[1:12:23] are never been exposed to it and the
[1:12:26] devil will get you there so the only way
[1:12:29] for you to get the devil completely you
[1:12:31] need to have the missing part make sure
[1:12:34] but if you already been exposed to from
[1:12:36] 1 to 8 amen do you need it over
[1:12:40] again because you're already familiar to
[1:12:43] it so when the devil come it's already
[1:12:45] we already know about this thing but you
[1:12:47] need to focus more on the missing part
[1:12:51] because that's what the devil use every
[1:12:53] sing single time and knock everybody
[1:12:55] else that was before us everybody clear
[1:12:58] we clear so far as far as Paul I mean
[1:13:01] elaborate and and and and open the word
[1:13:04] plainly and clearly the devil came in as
[1:13:07] a nicolan spirit and inflict something
[1:13:10] when Paul was even there Paul even said
[1:13:12] the Antichrist is moving he's already
[1:13:15] there there is only one thing that can
[1:13:18] with stand it takes the ministry of
[1:13:20] Joseph are we clear amen we okay now now
[1:13:23] jum to verse
[1:13:25] 45 if you dare you can say amen and
[1:13:29] Pharaoh called Joseph what he called
[1:13:32] Joseph names what zna P zna pan my
[1:13:37] daughter even asked me this he said
[1:13:39] Daddy what
[1:13:40] do means and I gave her the answer I say
[1:13:44] okay I'm going to use her and quote her
[1:13:46] that that's where he comes from the word
[1:13:48] zaf panea means the man to whom hidden
[1:13:52] things are
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:03] revealed any question I have three
[1:14:06] definition that I found out the word zap
[1:14:10] first definition means the man to whom
[1:14:13] hidden things are
[1:14:15] revealed the second definition is the
[1:14:18] man who reveal
[1:14:21] Mysteries amen
[1:14:25] so Joseph is
[1:14:27] Za he's the man that reveal Mysteries
[1:14:32] and the third definition is a founder of
[1:14:36] mysteries everybody okay so Joseph
[1:14:40] that's why we call Joseph William Marian
[1:14:43] Bram because the ministry of brother
[1:14:45] Bram is a Ministry to reveal the
[1:14:48] mysteries of God Amen which are the
[1:14:51] Revelation that were
[1:14:53] in the seven seal that's why this
[1:14:56] message is the mystery
[1:15:01] amen everybody okay amen are we clear so
[1:15:05] far everybody okay so far if you have a
[1:15:07] trouble with this message it's clear now
[1:15:11] amen verse 45 and Pharaoh called Joseph
[1:15:15] named what ZF p and he gave him as a
[1:15:19] wife Alena the daughter of pipera priest
[1:15:22] of
[1:15:23] and Joseph went went out over all the
[1:15:27] land of what Egypt and Joseph was 30
[1:15:30] years old when he stood before
[1:15:36] Pharaoh when did Jesus started his
[1:15:40] ministry so this is the ministry of
[1:15:43] Christ
[1:15:46] himself are we together I already pray
[1:15:49] so don't wait for me to pray I already
[1:15:51] pray I'm just claming every everybody
[1:15:53] Okay we okay is it clear he say he was
[1:15:57] 30 years when he stood before Pharaoh
[1:15:59] king of Egypt and Joseph went out from
[1:16:02] the presence of who Pharaoh they don't
[1:16:05] say he went out from Pharaoh from the
[1:16:08] presence of pharaoh because Pharaoh
[1:16:12] Pharaoh is the type of God and God and
[1:16:16] Joseph must meet together am amen so
[1:16:20] before Joseph started ministry he
[1:16:22] already met with God Amen and then when
[1:16:25] he left Pharaoh he left the presence of
[1:16:27] God in order to execute his commission
[1:16:32] amen everybody okay the presence of God
[1:16:35] are recognized Amen in his
[1:16:39] presence are we together have I lost
[1:16:42] somebody sir okay praise God you need to
[1:16:45] put your head in the message amen and
[1:16:47] then he says that he went throughout all
[1:16:50] the land of what Egypt and in the seven
[1:16:53] plenus
[1:16:54] years the earth brought forth what by
[1:16:57] hand because remember the ministry of
[1:17:01] Joseph for the first time the entire
[1:17:03] land of Egypt begin to cry unto Pharaoh
[1:17:08] amen all Egypt was crying unto Pharaoh
[1:17:10] in other words the bread of Joseph took
[1:17:13] all Egypt and put him back to
[1:17:15] relationship with pharaoh and I quoted
[1:17:18] something and I'm going to give it to
[1:17:19] you so you make sure you get it Amen

[1:17:30] what a message to the people that they
[1:17:32] may what follow me if you notice the
[1:17:35] entire Ministry of Joseph he never
[1:17:37] brought anybody toward him that's right
[1:17:40] everything Joseph was doing was giving
[1:17:42] toward pharoh amen everybody okay he
[1:17:44] says all to join what my church or to
[1:17:47] start some fellowship and what
[1:17:49] organization I have never done that and

[1:18:34] to bring us to form a denomination amen
[1:18:36] it was not to bring us to bring I mean
[1:18:39] to bring us to go back to him because
[1:18:41] brother Bram is already dead am but it's
[1:18:44] to establish a relationship between the
[1:18:46] bride and Jesus Christ between the Son
[1:18:49] of God and God

[1:22:33] supposed to deliver to the entire world
[1:22:37] Amen when he was put together are you
[1:22:40] following me he looked like the sand of
[1:22:43] the sea and he was without number what
[1:22:47] does he
[1:22:49] mean we clear let's clam a little bit
[1:22:53] in the Book of
[1:22:54] Genesis 15 verse 2 and
[1:22:58] 5 God was talking to
[1:23:02] Abraham he have not clicked yet it's
[1:23:04] coming and God begin to talk to Abraham
[1:23:08] and Abraham expressed his concern to God
[1:23:11] and in verse two the Bible say and
[1:23:13] Abraham said Lord God what will that
[1:23:17] give me seeing I go how childless and
[1:23:20] the steward of my house is this elzar of
[1:23:23] Damascus in other word I don't have a
[1:23:25] child I don't have a descendant and if I
[1:23:28] die everything will be given to to
[1:23:30] elezar of Damascus but elezar is not a
[1:23:33] true blood from me he's a man from
[1:23:36] Damascus amen and Abraham said behold to
[1:23:40] me thou thou has given what no
[1:23:43] seed Abraham was concerned about the
[1:23:46] seed and L one born in my house is my
[1:23:49] water air and behold the word of the
[1:23:51] Lord came unto him saying this shall not
[1:23:54] be what thine air in other words elar is
[1:23:57] not the hair amen but he that shall come
[1:24:00] forth out of thy own what bows shall be
[1:24:03] what thine air and he brought him forth
[1:24:06] where abroad in other word Abraham come
[1:24:08] outside and say look now toward what
[1:24:11] heaven and tell what the Stars if thou
[1:24:14] be able to do what number them and he
[1:24:17] said unto him so shall what thy seed be
[1:24:20] so the seed of Abra
[1:24:23] is a seed that is without number amen
[1:24:27] are we cling together amen the Seed of
[1:24:31] Abraham amen the Seed of Abraham was
[1:24:35] compared to the stars of
[1:24:37] Heaven amen and when he was compared to
[1:24:41] the stars of Heaven he was a seed
[1:24:44] without number Amen in other word
[1:24:46] Abraham cannot put a numbering to the
[1:24:48] Seed of Abraham if you look at that that
[1:24:52] word seed is it plural or singular
[1:24:55] singular the seed is in singular it's
[1:24:58] not plural are we clear now when we go
[1:25:01] to the book of uh in the New Testament
[1:25:04] Paul is saying this in the book of
[1:25:06] Hebrew Paul says this that therefore
[1:25:10] sprung there even of one and him as good
[1:25:13] as what dead so many as the what stars
[1:25:17] of the sky in what multitude and as the
[1:25:20] what sand which is by the what Seashore
[1:25:24] are what innumerable so the Seed of
[1:25:27] Abraham doesn't look only like the
[1:25:31] star the Seed of Abraham also look like
[1:25:34] the sand of the sea
[1:25:36] amen are we together the Seed of Abraham
[1:25:40] is also represented as the sand of the
[1:25:44] sea amen amen if you say the star of
[1:25:48] Heaven it's the Seed of Abraham if you
[1:25:50] say the sand of the sea it's it's also
[1:25:52] the Seed of Abraham and that seed is in
[1:25:55] singular it is s e e d singular not in
[1:25:59] plural amen and the Bible say when
[1:26:01] Joseph collected the food the food that
[1:26:05] Joseph collected looked like what the
[1:26:07] sand of the seed and the Seed of Abraham
[1:26:09] look like what the sand of the sea so

[1:26:42] many but as of what one and to that seed
[1:26:45] which is who
[1:26:47] Christ amen everybody okay amen so the
[1:26:50] Seed of Abraham is who Christ
[1:26:54] Hallelujah and chist look like what the
[1:26:57] sand of the sea and Joseph collected the
[1:27:00] multitude of bread like what the sand of
[1:27:03] the sea so the sand of the sea which is
[1:27:06] how without number so the food of Joseph
[1:27:09] represented who Christ any question so
[1:27:12] far amen everybody okay so what Joseph
[1:27:15] put off there was Christ
[1:27:18] amen everybody okay the food that were

[1:29:14] crust of Luther is only justification
[1:29:17] the crust of Wesley is only
[1:29:19] sanctification the crust of the

[1:30:36] moon everybody okay if you look at the
[1:30:39] Moon it look like the sun if you look at
[1:30:41] the sun it look like the

[1:31:20] pick up the light of the Sun
[1:31:22] but before he pick up that sun we need
[1:31:24] to know what was the light of that sun
[1:31:27] before that light be reflected in the
[1:31:29] moon we need to know whether that light
[1:31:32] was one or two or three or four we need
[1:31:35] to know the magnitude of the sun are we
[1:31:38] together follow me carefully he says and

[1:37:45] that people in the message are playing

[1:38:36] playing with the very corn the very sand

[1:38:45] he looks like what sand of the sea the
[1:38:49] sand of the sea right there
[1:38:53] God so the corn of Joseph represented
[1:38:57] who Christ if the corn of Joseph
[1:39:00] represented Christ so when Joseph begin
[1:39:03] to send out his cor it is who is looking
[1:39:05] for who it is Christ looking for who
[1:39:09] that's why his corn could not stay only
[1:39:11] in Egypt
[1:39:15] amen his cor have to go all of the world
[1:39:19] because the cor represent Christ and
[1:39:22] Christ has his children all over the
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:30] world everybody okay everybody okay
[1:39:33] everybody okay that's why brother Bram

[1:39:53] flies all over the planet it is looking
[1:39:56] for things that look like Christ amen it
[1:40:00] is Christ searching for his children
[1:40:03] that's why brother say when you when you
[1:40:05] recognize this message to be eager food
[1:40:10] then you heard from your own you heard
[1:40:13] from your own representation
[1:40:19] amen thank you Jesus Christ is what the
[1:40:24] seals the seals that was what open what
[1:40:27] is the opening of the water seals
[1:40:30] revealing to who Christ so what is the
[1:40:32] opening of the storehouses of Joseph
[1:40:35] revealing Christ it is bringing the food
[1:40:37] crossed out so that the people can
[1:40:40] withstand the femine and that femine is
[1:40:43] the death angel it is the P horse so to
[1:40:47] combat the P horse you need an eagle
[1:40:49] anointing amen and the eagle anointing
[1:40:52] must be the seals to withstand the devil
[1:40:56] in this end time
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:01] Amen in this church this is where we
[1:41:04] stand the seals are the m and the seals
[1:41:08] are the tempol and the seals are Crist
[1:41:12] and the seals that's the bread of
[1:41:18] Joseph never let anybody sit around that
[1:41:21] say do you need to know all of these
[1:41:23] seals do you know what the seals
[1:41:26] mean who can interpret the Bible without
[1:41:29] the opening of the
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:34] seals let me say even this he might
[1:41:37] shock you if brother Bram never reached
[1:41:40] the opening of the seals he was also
[1:41:43] vulnerable to the
[1:41:45] devil because brother Bram had the first
[1:41:48] food they impersonate him the second P
[1:41:51] they imperson him but when he Reach the
[1:41:54] the third pool that's why the devil
[1:41:56] could not touch it is a higher level
[1:41:59] amen the devil cannot reach that level
[1:42:02] amen and if you want the devil to get
[1:42:04] away from you take him inside the third
[1:42:07] pool
[1:42:12] Amen in the first pool the devil got
[1:42:15] oxygen the second pool he got oxygen but
[1:42:19] when you take him deep in the third pool
[1:42:21] he can no longer
[1:42:23] brief his oxygen is completely dep keep
[1:42:27] him in the third
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:36] po everybody good have I lost someone
[1:42:40] have I lost somebody oh
[1:42:42] sir let's go to Genesis 41 my
[1:42:46] friend
[1:42:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:58] I can move forward but I can't I'm
[1:43:00] following the boss Hallelujah he's the
[1:43:02] one preaching to this church he's the
[1:43:04] one telling me what to preach everybody
[1:43:07] okay never play with the seals the seals
[1:43:10] are not a
[1:43:12] book the book is only a little material
[1:43:15] that was put together because by the BR
[1:43:17] I'm saying one seal he can preach for
[1:43:19] three month did he preach one seal in
[1:43:22] three month so the seal is not really
[1:43:24] the book The Seal is Christ it is a
[1:43:28] person before brother Bram preached the
[1:43:31] seals Christ himself came to him and
[1:43:35] told him what the seal is so what Christ
[1:43:38] was telling him was
[1:43:41] himself so the seal is a
[1:43:46] person that's why this Bible is
[1:43:48] unlimited now we keep seeing new things
[1:43:51] every day because of the breaking of the
[1:43:54] seal you cannot find a number to put a
[1:43:57] stop here because Christ doesn't have a
[1:44:01] limitation he is eternity he is meis EDC
[1:44:05] no beginning of there no ending of Life
[1:44:09] he's unlimited he is Christ it is the G
[1:44:13] that is without
[1:44:16] number and if you are a Seed of Abraham
[1:44:20] you must your portion in this message
[1:44:22] there must be a part of this message
[1:44:25] when you open up to you you say that is

[2:26:55] Moab amen and after a while Naomi left
[2:26:58] the land of Moab and returned back to
[2:27:01] Judah we need to know what caused the
[2:27:03] moving back and
[2:27:08] forth what what what what started the
[2:27:11] moving toward uh uh Moab and what
[2:27:14] triggered the moving from Moab to
[2:27:18] what started North and
[2:27:23] South everybody okay are we clear we
[2:27:27] back in roof right let's go verse one
[2:27:29] now it came to pass in the days when the
[2:27:32] H judges r that there was a what a
[2:27:35] famine in so what start the trouble
[2:27:39] famine what start the history of
[2:27:45] redemption amen and fine in the land and
[2:27:50] a certain man of what Bethlehem Judah
[2:27:53] why only someone from Judah have to
[2:27:58] move not any other tribe only the tribe
[2:28:01] of Judah can
[2:28:03] move
[2:28:06] sir and not any family only the family
[2:28:11] of the royal lineage where Jesus will
[2:28:15] come yes
[2:28:17] so fine feine when he reach Israel amen
[2:28:22] he moved from the whole country of
[2:28:27] Israel everybody okay everybody okay
[2:28:31] everybody okay amen Israel is a
[2:28:36] clock everybody okay you know that a
[2:28:39] clock have hours right and after hours
[2:28:42] we have what minutes and after minute we
[2:28:45] have what seconds we clear so we need to
[2:28:48] move from a clock to hour to minute
[2:28:50] until we reach second amen when famine
[2:28:54] reach amen it struck Israel but it's not
[2:28:59] just Israel but when he struck not
[2:29:02] everybody move only a certain tribe was
[2:29:07] selected everybody okay but not
[2:29:10] everybody not everybody Israel not
[2:29:15] everybody from the
[2:29:17] tribe
[2:29:19] moved amen but when you reach down into
[2:29:23] that tribe it's a
[2:29:27] family so now we are
[2:29:30] precise we know the minute we know the
[2:29:32] second we know even the hour it is the
[2:29:35] tribe of Judah that moved it is the
[2:29:38] family of ALC and that family came from
[2:29:41] the lineage of the
[2:29:44] Messiah everybody okay what why only
[2:29:47] Judah have to
[2:29:49] move why only the royal family have to
[2:29:53] move because Judah is the only one that
[2:29:56] can marry a
[2:29:58] gentile and don't say
[2:30:05] anything can you say Amen can you say
[2:30:08] Amen when Jacob has his children of
[2:30:11] children it was Judah that went and
[2:30:13] marry outside and nothing happened
[2:30:17] if you marry from another tribe you
[2:30:18] bring them in they sack them up and they
[2:30:20] cast them away they're not going to
[2:30:22] accept them into the Commonwealth
[2:30:24] because Judah got
[2:30:28] decept decept break the law do you
[2:30:32] remember the Book of Esther the Lord
[2:30:34] said nobody can enter but when Esther
[2:30:37] enter what happened the king took the
[2:30:40] septer and did in other word when I I
[2:30:42] killed the law only Judah can make
[2:30:45] someone enter
[2:30:49] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:30:53] okay and the country they were going
[2:30:55] towards the country of Moab which we
[2:30:58] already seen that Moab the Bible the law
[2:31:01] say no
[2:31:03] moabite can enter into the congregation
[2:31:06] of what so you need a
[2:31:10] king to break the law you need a king to
[2:31:15] to veto
[2:31:22] you need a king that have the VOR right
[2:31:25] that can say no I take this person and
[2:31:28] pull him in and what move that family is
[2:31:33] famine hunger started
[2:31:36] Redemption we together hold on I'm going
[2:31:39] to finish my friend because I have not
[2:31:41] start the sermon yet if I start the
[2:31:43] sermon so it's a problem let's go verse
[2:31:45] one and now now it came to pass in the
[2:31:48] days when the churches rule that there
[2:31:50] was a what famine in the Land There was
[2:31:52] a famine in the land and a certain men
[2:31:54] of what Bethlehem Judah not just
[2:31:57] Bethlehem Bethlehem look where it's

[2:32:18] verse six that was the exod the starting
[2:32:21] of the journey started with a fine what
[2:32:23] is going to bring that family back to
[2:32:26] Israel verse six you there amen if you
[2:32:30] there you can say amen amen then she

[2:32:46] she was still lingering she's not going
[2:32:49] look what trigger Naomi you there amen
[2:32:52] you there amen then she arose with her
[2:32:57] daughter everybody okay inlaw that she
[2:33:00] might do what return from the country of
[2:33:03] Moab for she have what heard in the
[2:33:06] country of Moab slowly that God how the
[2:33:11] Lord that the Lord has what visited his

[2:33:36] Naomi and Ruth back to the promised land
[2:33:40] it is a bread that bring you back to

[2:33:59] lost our identity we didn't know who we
[2:34:03] are we thought we were the children of
[2:34:06] the parent that birth us but later on we
[2:34:09] begin to realize by the cone of
[2:34:13] Joseph by the bread of Joseph by the
[2:34:16] message of the hour by Christ by the
[2:34:20] third po by the opening of the seals
[2:34:23] that we are no longer Charles of a and
[2:34:26] Charles BR that we come from somewhere
[2:34:29] else we belong to another country and we
