[22:52] we shall see him as he is a man we shall
[22:55] be changed amen amen
[23:01] uh you know we've been hearing that we
[23:03] don't know who we are
[23:05] and
[23:07] we're 60 years down the road
[23:11] from the opening of the seals
[23:13] um
[23:14] and the other day my wife and I went for
[23:16] a ride
[23:18] to uh and we stopped at an antique place
[23:22] and coming out of there I just
[23:25] something hit my throat
[23:27] and it was just it was strange it was
[23:30] just um
[23:33] it was just weird the way it did it and
[23:36] um
[23:38] I told myself I said Satan you have no
[23:41] power over me
[23:44] and
[23:45] I don't know what it was I don't know
[23:47] where it came from
[23:49] but I know where it went back to
[23:52] and I haven't had no problems with it so
[23:54] I thank the Lord so we don't know who we
[23:57] are it's it's time church that we
[23:59] realize Who We Are
[24:01] uh just like I was telling brother Kelly
[24:04] in the back there
[24:06] that slave that walked with his chest
[24:09] out and his head up he was the son of a
[24:12] king
[24:13] we're Sons and Daughters of the king
[24:18] and
[24:19] we need to act that way
[24:21] and expect things to happen
[24:25] let us pray
[24:26] father once again
[24:28] would just come before your father and
[24:31] Lord we're so thankful that you brought
[24:33] us here again Lord and Lord through the
[24:36] Mind battles that we go through during
[24:37] the week father and when Satan tries to
[24:39] drag us down but father
[24:41] we are Sons and Daughters of you
[24:45] and Satan has no authority over us
[24:48] you're the only one that has authority
[24:50] over us
[24:52] and Lord
[24:53] we're so far down the road father but
[24:56] Lord the things that you have been
[24:58] bringing to us father in this little
[25:00] assembly father
[25:02] and hearing the pastor say over and over
[25:05] again you don't know who you are
[25:08] but Lord we need to realize Who We Are
[25:11] and we need to stand up and say Who We
[25:13] Are
[25:14] and walk as Jesus walked
[25:18] unconscious of anything around him
[25:21] knowing who he was
[25:23] and knowing why he was here
[25:25] and nothing bothered him
[25:28] and Lord we need to believe that too
[25:30] father because we are your children
[25:32] father and Lord we need to rise up Lord
[25:36] as the song says there's an army rising
[25:39] up
[25:40] Lord we are that Army father we see the
[25:43] the destruction that is going on father
[25:46] just one after another
[25:49] Lord we know it's judgment and we see
[25:51] the perversion Lord that has taken place
[25:53] just on and on
[25:55] and we look at these things Lord and I
[25:58] seen the other day where they're they're
[26:00] calling for a Revival in California
[26:03] and Lord we know judgment is is uh the
[26:07] only thing Californians have before is
[26:09] judgment
[26:10] but Lord we see these things and we know
[26:14] where we're at
[26:15] because you have told us through your
[26:17] end time Prophet father to watch these
[26:19] things
[26:21] and father we see it transpiring very
[26:23] very fast
[26:25] and Lord as you told us through your
[26:27] prophet in the last hours of your life
[26:30] things manifested more in the last
[26:34] several hours than they did your entire
[26:36] life
[26:37] and Lord here we are at the end time
[26:38] seeing these things manifest just one
[26:40] after another
[26:42] and Lord we know that the body change
[26:45] can take place anytime and Lord we
[26:48] expect it Lord we're looking for
[26:51] and father we just Commit This service
[26:53] into your hands For Your Glory your
[26:55] honor
[26:56] Lord just let our hearts burn within us
[26:58] father as you speak to us along the way
[27:02] Lord let us look past the veil of Flesh
[27:04] and see you standing there
[27:07] Lord as the prophet looked out over the
[27:10] audience Lord and seen you moving across
[27:13] the audience Lord
[27:15] may you move across this audience Lord
[27:18] and then and and just sweep over us Lord
[27:21] as as I was thinking earlier the the
[27:24] little Whirlwind that you caused to come
[27:27] to brother Stephen and brother Robert
[27:28] before we even moved into this place
[27:31] and Lord made that Whirlwind come
[27:33] tonight Lord and just hover over us
[27:37] father and Lord we just Commit This
[27:39] service into your hands father bless the
[27:41] tithes the offerings that we never want
[27:43] to forget that multiplied at 104.
[27:47] and Lord just all the prayer requests
[27:49] the unspoken we all know that we all
[27:52] have things on our hearts the father
[27:55] family members friends relatives Lord
[27:58] whatever they may be father we just
[28:00] commit them all into your hands
[28:03] Lord not worrying about anything father
[28:05] when we just bring it to your feet We
[28:08] Lay it there and we leave it there
[28:11] just knowing Lord that you're going that
[28:14] you're in control of it all
[28:16] as Ruth laid her life at the feet of
[28:18] Boaz
[28:19] after all the work that she did when she
[28:21] laid her life down there it was over
[28:23] and Boaz took care of her from then on
[28:27] and Lord that's what we believe
[28:29] we just committed to your hands father
[28:31] in Jesus name we pray amen

[40:51] Jerusalem
[40:53] now you can exhort or preach somebody
[40:57] exhort meaning the sisters
[40:59] preach meaning the brothers
[41:01] everybody okay how about the power of
[41:04] the Resurrection
[41:06] now you see the power of the
[41:08] Resurrection
[41:09] oh my God the Holy Spirit gave me a
[41:11] clear scripture straight that shows that
[41:14] without the real Direction there is no
[41:16] New Birth beside the one I give from
[41:18] First Peter chapter one there is another
[41:21] one clear with that the resurrection of
[41:23] Jesus Christ no holy ghost coming upon
[41:26] the believer amen
[41:28] because Jesus even says that I need its
[41:30] experience for me to go
[41:32] but how is he going with which kind of
[41:35] body with the body that he has
[41:37] he needed to change the body
[41:40] so the resurrection is very important
[41:42] amen so you pray for me because you keep
[41:45] unfolding it keeps opening up what I had
[41:48] already was loaded now I had to add more
[41:50] loaded stuff amen so you pray for me
[41:54] remember this coming uh
[41:56] Saturday at four o'clock that would be
[41:59] music part two here four o'clock so you
[42:02] pray for me because I will be the one
[42:04] here and you'll be the one enjoying back
[42:07] there so I need prayer amen
[42:09] because we got Easter coming up so you
[42:12] pray for me so everything will be okay
[42:14] but I believe the big bulk of it we
[42:16] already got it on the first uh part one
[42:19] and part two Lord's willing will dig
[42:21] into something else amen amen somebody
[42:25] wrote a question and answer about
[42:27] marriage there is no name
[42:30] but uh it's an invasive one so if
[42:33] possible send me a text
[42:35] whoever wrote it maybe they hear or
[42:37] maybe they're not here so I know exactly
[42:40] what you're looking at because I need
[42:42] more detail and probably it's a question
[42:45] that I would rather answer somebody
[42:47] individually than uh
[42:50] publicly because it's going to open a
[42:52] lot of Canon because everybody's a
[42:54] situation is different from one person
[42:57] to another so if I give you your answer
[42:59] maybe your situation is not exactly what
[43:02] somebody else is going and if we apply
[43:04] that across the board then we're going
[43:06] to get in trouble amen so it's a
[43:09] question about marriage so try to send
[43:12] me a text and tell me who you are and
[43:14] then we can set up an appointment and we
[43:16] can sit and talk and see what's going on
[43:19] Amen there is another question that was
[43:21] given to me about the firstborn that's a
[43:25] very difficult one
[43:27] but uh it is hard also for me to open it
[43:31] to the public I have to talk to the
[43:34] person individually amen and it's some
[43:37] of the stuff that are hard for somebody
[43:38] to open up finally somebody broke and
[43:41] opened it open it just a little bit and
[43:43] God help me to
[43:45] catch it and then say hey this is what's
[43:47] going on and the person admitted so you
[43:51] pray for me I have to deal with those
[43:53] question individually it only happened
[43:55] to the firstborn
[43:56] mm-hmm
[43:58] only happened to the firstborn
[44:00] and usually we do that unconsciously we
[44:03] don't know what we were doing and we
[44:05] didn't even mean harm but they usually
[44:07] are the first one that get affected
[44:09] that's why it's always good to seek for
[44:12] the Holy Spirit
[44:13] and to get into marriage with the Holy
[44:15] Ghost
[44:16] so that the children will grow up
[44:18] without any headache
[44:20] amen by the time you stabilize
[44:23] everything somebody is already have
[44:25] registered a lot of stuff
[44:28] that we need now to start cleaning up
[44:30] amen but thank God we got the word we
[44:33] got the bomb in gilia amen

[48:06] let's go straight to our scriptures
[48:13] second king chapter 7.
[48:19] verse 3.
[48:23] beginning verse 3.
[48:28] second king chapter seven are you there
[48:33] okay
[48:38] I believe I can start from the first
[48:41] verse
[49:02] that say the Lord tomorrow
[49:07] be sold for a shekel and two measures of
[49:10] barley for sheko in the gate of Samaria
[49:15] foreign
[49:55] you see
[49:59] and there were four leprous men at the
[50:02] entering in the gate and they said one
[50:06] to another why sit we hear until we die
[50:14] why situate here until we die
[50:20] why situi here until we die
[50:25] hallelujah amen
[50:31] is
[50:45] if we say we will enter into the city
[50:48] then the feminism City and we shall die
[50:51] there and if we sit still here we die
[50:55] also now therefore come and let us fall
[50:58] unto the host of the Syrian if they save
[51:00] us alive we shall leave if they kill us
[51:03] we shall but die
[52:02] and those that are following streaming
[53:03] don't say that I don't know
[53:05] foreign
[53:29] [Music]
[54:05] maybe we had so many excuses not to make
[54:08] a difference
[54:09] but God gave us Grace to be here
[54:13] and I also I'm grateful to the past
[54:17] to give me this opportunity
[54:21] so that we can bring the brothers
[54:24] may God greatly bless him
[54:27] and his house and everything that he's
[54:31] doing according foreign
[54:33] once again I greet you all
[54:56] you know a man that is leprous or
[54:59] leprosy on itself
[55:02] it's something that is
[55:13] built a camp for them
[55:17] so that they cannot be in fellowship
[55:20] with other people amen amen
[55:23] our Lord man
[55:27] messenger but those people
[55:31] they were sitting at the gate
[55:37] there was a moment of a crisis of famine
[55:41] in Samaria in Japan
[55:43] no food
[55:47] and the man of God Elijah spoke about
[55:50] the feminine okay
[55:53] and that he prophesied that we will have
[55:55] food a measure of barley for shekels
[56:03] but there was a land a lord on Whose
[56:07] hand the King was leaning
[56:22] and he said
[56:24] secretary what you are prophesying about
[56:28] yes
[56:30] I don't care even if God opened windows
[56:33] from heaven
[56:35] and Lord and the man of God look at him
[56:39] he said you're not gonna be partaker of
[56:42] it
[56:45] and that was the end of his part
[56:51] but since the famine was all over the
[56:54] country
[56:56] we had four lepers
[57:02] they made a decision to go into the camp
[57:05] of the Philistine amen of the syrians
[57:09] of the Syrian
[57:11] we must go up there basket
[57:14] because we are hungry not
[57:17] reconditionally
[57:19] our condition cannot be a hindrance to
[57:22] us
[57:23] to make it to the Philly to the Syrian
[57:26] cancer
[57:27] you see they say if we stay here
[57:30] we die
[57:33] if we go there
[58:02] if you continue with the rest of the
[58:04] scripture
[58:10] [Music]
[58:19] and when they arrived there
[58:23] as they were going
[58:27] God made the Syrian to hear a noise
[58:36] like a noise of a great horse
[58:40] like a noise of horses
[58:44] of a great host
[58:55] [Music]
[59:01] and the kings of the Egyptian to come
[59:03] upon us
[59:08] that was the testimony
[59:12] when they heard the noise
[59:48] and those four people that were walking
[59:51] were not healthy people
[59:55] there were people that were feeble
[59:57] family
[1:00:00] maybe you are civil tonight
[1:00:04] you think that because you feeble there
[1:00:07] is no Solutions
[1:00:10] these people never look at the State
[1:00:12] lost in immersion when they were walking
[1:00:15] their son in the premium
[1:00:18] nobody could even hear the noise of the
[1:00:21] footsteps the communities or pray in a
[1:00:24] decision but because of the decision
[1:00:28] God Almighty took over
[1:00:32] because every time they make a step
[1:00:36] I say God said that's enough that's all
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:40] and God took care of the rice said the
[1:00:43] fair air brewing and God made it here
[1:00:46] and not
[1:00:47] in the camp of the enemy
[1:00:55] first before we continue

[1:01:28] a hindrance to us
[1:01:30] to block us from moving in life
[1:01:35] to claim on the benefits of God
[1:01:38] to claims on the Promises
[1:01:42] they say we gotta make a step yeah
[1:01:45] and when they took that decision to go

[1:07:50] Branham is saying here
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:59] in the message believe is that this I
[1:08:02] believe in
[1:08:04] 1950 1962.

[1:09:33] slave to buy
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:46] I'm in paragraph 107.
[1:09:54] before I read this he says
[1:09:57] when he looked at the slaves
[1:10:02] they noticed one of the slaves
[1:10:07] that every time he was working he was
[1:10:10] whistling illness they didn't see him
[1:10:13] with his head bow down
[1:10:16] he always have a chest
[1:10:19] upcoming press and then he was walking
[1:10:21] like a priest
[1:10:23] but he was still a Slave
[1:10:30] took notice of him
[1:10:35] what about that one do you sell it

[1:48:55] that the master must pay tax the
[1:48:58] discipline see
[1:49:00] Elizabeth
[1:49:04] and the disciple went and ask questions
[1:49:08] and Jesus gave them answers
[1:49:13] now to save some time let me go to verse
[1:49:17] 27. notwithstanding

[1:50:43] he didn't want people to talk bad about
[1:50:46] him that he's a man that doesn't pay
[1:50:48] taxes and things like that he refused
[1:50:51] that bad reputation
[1:50:53] he refused it completely
[1:50:58] he refused to be victim of that
[1:51:01] circumstance and you and one day after
