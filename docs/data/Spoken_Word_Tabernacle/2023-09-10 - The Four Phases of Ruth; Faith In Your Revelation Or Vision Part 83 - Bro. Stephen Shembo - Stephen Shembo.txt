pray is that okay amen amen let me get you a microphone sister God bless you precious Saints a few years ago I had given a testimony to the glory of the Lord that he had healed me of lactose intolerance it used to be so bad that before they discovered it was they wanted to do surgery and I I refused and so holding on to the word of the Lord one day I mean it used to be that when I started eating I start coughing really really bad like I was choking and and it would just be like that it didn't matter what I ate then later on I was told that it was lactose so but despite all that I was still on allergy medications but they added another one and and so the Lord took away that lactose issue and I was able to continue to drink milk and eat milk products and continued on the medication for the allergy so I'll give glory to the Lord today because he reminded me that you got the inspiration and told your husband to stop jadians right in this the middle of the service and he did and the Lord honored it and and um took care of his blood sugar but you continue to take these medications and just so you know the allergies were so bad to a point that if I I was taking medication once a day and when the 24 hour reaches before I take the medicine I start sneezing I start coughing and start drooling it was that bad and sometimes during even the seasons I could even go up and take two or three medications with a spray and my eyes also so that's how bad it was and despite these even with the medications that I would still that trigger would still come and I would start sneezing and and coughing anyway so when that inspiration came I said and all the preaching and God you are in me and you're part of me I'm part of you and you say that nothing is impossible with you and that if you're in me I can do all things and you know the the preaching just kept on and I said you know what I'm stopping these medications for me native fact and I did that was two weeks ago and the fight continued and every time the symptoms come said you're a liar yeah I'm not listening to you you have to go you have to leave because you will not make my God be a liar there is nothing that is impossible with him and I continued and I am standing here I have not taken a single medication for two weeks and I'm glorifying God and I just want to encourage you who might be going through the same if you take that Leap of Faith remember the enemy will start keep trying to come back but you just have to keep talking to him and rebuking him and I give all glory to an honor to God amen amen

and invisible audience if there is any family members here God richly bless you we don't have visitors here God bless you but Mark good to see you again and congratulations for the program that you finish all the glories given back to God Amen once again my apology I send you a scripture late last night so whoever could like I say if possible so don't be under condemnation if you saw the message in the morning and you are unable to read it but if you were still up and you had an opportunity to read it then that's between you and God Amen but I felt like I cannot read the whole chapter I will try the best that I can but if you get the background story it's going to be easy to move together amen glory to God I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon I believe everybody is reading the Bible in the morning one chapter and before you go to bed one chapter that's what the prophet said I believe everyone is reading the Cod book at least one question a day we have the church ages we got the seals and we got the 70 weeks of Daniel it's my responsibility to remind you so that you constantly stay in the word amen even if you don't have a chance while you're driving put that tape on listen to the prophet God will give you an inspiration right there and he can change the course of your life so in other words let's stay constantly into the word amen but Abel I'm still waiting for the Young's men meetings sister Divine I'm waiting for the young Sisters Meeting and Lord's willing on September the 16th which I believe it's next Saturday that's our question and answer the remaining of the uh the instruction will be sent in the WhatsApp chat and if you have any question please do so by Wednesday night so I have a little bit of time to kind of prepare for it amen I believe I got everything covered up let's go straight to our scripture amen body Kalima seems like he is not here so somebody need to compensate amen somebody need to say Amen and keep the fire moving we need one another I need each one of you I need the small amen the bigger man the medium email Amen all amen amen Oh Glory to God let's go to the Book of Judges amen glory to God who are the friend we have in Jesus amen you there let's see how far we can even go with this scripture amen looks like the more you read the scripture you open up more because the seals did something to the Bible he turned the Bible into a new book everybody there we are now Judges chapter 6 verse one if you're there you can say amen amen the Bible says and the children the Bible didn't say the people the Bible says the children the children of Israel not the people the children amen they're still the people of God but the Bible says the children the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the me of median how many years seven years so seven years the children were under trouble does it ring your bed seven years you should be jumping with these numbers in other words trouble started at E1 and it's gonna end in year so what do we expect at the seventh year what do we expect the mathematics of the scripture you might be seated amen he said and the Hand of median Prevail against Israel and because of the medianat the children of Israel made them the then made them the dance which are in the mountains and caves and stronghold so somebody now is under the enemy has taken the hand over amen and so verse 3 he was when Israel had sown that the millionaire came up and the amalekite you see a malachite and that's why God said wipe them up they came miss an opportunity over Israel whenever something goes about Israel malachite have to be there amen he said and the children of the East even they came up against them verse 4 and they encamp against them and did what destroyed destroy water the increase when Israel or sowing no problem they stay away when they increase come when that new paycheck comes [Music] you've never been there you've never been there every time when it's Thursday or when it's a Friday that's when sickness begin to come you've never been there oh okay maybe you've been fine and nothing have been happening to you all your paycheck has been 100 covered amen you know what happened right and sometime before even the paycheck comes I'm just picking paycheck as an example so it makes sense okay before it comes you know what happened right this one's sick and the hospital bill and this this and it looks like after all the money is gone everything goes back to quietness they don't want to see money in your bank account they want to eat and leave you with two dollars or overdraft it's a malachite it's not normal amen it's not normal don't think it's normal don't even get used to that like money comes and money goes that's not correct I'm bringing you that frees you not only spiritually but you have to free you physically financially material everywhere brother Brown and preach a message told Deliverance the Deliverance have to be told in other words in every aspect you must be free amen your children delivered everything that you do deliver amen the Bible says in verse 4 and they encamp against them and destroy the increase of the Earth until you come together and left no sustenance for Israel neither ship nor Ox nor water they only come to destroy amen not even to take it to just destroy verse 5 for they came up with their cattle and their tent and they came up as grasshopper for multitude the system you get that amen and he said that was her question for birthday and their camel where with that number and they enter into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly rich impoverished Israel was greatly impoverished because of the median Act and the children of Israel did what Cried unto the Lord they Cried unto the Lord and he came to pass when the children of Israel cried they went they went because of the medianade that the Lord sent a prophet so at the end of seven years what comes a prophet [Applause] so if we have seven churches what do you expect at the end of the sentence a prophet that is the order of God is the program of God it is how God operated When the Children when his children are out of line to bring them back in line you need a prophet I love this church I love this church amen a prophet what is a prophet going to do at the end of the seven years amen amen don't worry brother kalim is here amen don't worry everything is okay amen the Bible says and that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of water Israel notice he's calling them the children everybody okay which say to them this is age of the prophet thus says the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from what Egypt the prophet when he comes he's taking the children [Music] everybody okay and bring them to the fifth that started from Egypt [Applause] he returned them to the origin amen he said remember you all came out of Egypt and the coming out of it and the coming out of Egypt started with a prophet and his name was Moses so the prophet at the end of the seventh year returned the children back to the fifth of the prophet of The Exodus amen and the prophet of The Exodus was Moses who brought the law amen so the beginning of Israel started with a prophet amen so the prophet is returning the children back to the faith of their fathers everybody okay the children's heart have been turned back to the faith of the water fathers the father had a prophet there and Paul was a prophet and Paul took the law of Moses and opened up the law of Moses so from Prophet to prophet so at the end of The Seven Year a prophet comes and the prophet is coming to restore the faith back to the faith of the father amen amen the Bible says and I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of water of the House of bondage everybody okay job two verse 11. for the sake of time after the prophet came after the prophet deliver his message who get on the scene amen verse 11 and there came water an angel why is it a combination of the prophet and the angel of the Lord okay amen that's why we have that picture over there the prophet and the angel of the Lord amen that's why we have that picture over there there is nothing out of the scripture in this message this message is perfectly in line with the Bible you have a prophet and you have the god of the prophet that Pillar of Fire is also called the angel of the Lord he is an angel of the Lord when he moved Faith or he take the form of an Angel that's why they call him the angel of the Lord when he take the form of a priest they call him water Melchizedek it's God in Murphy we okay verse 11 and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under the oak tree which was in offer that pertain to Jewish the abezzarite and his son who Gideon stressed with by the wine press to do what to hide it he already got into the system you have to have a pig or something to keep putting some senses there because if he put it in the bank account to pull it up you have to hide it okay it's a Battleground in the bank account that's where all the bills are coming and the angel of the Lord amen and the angel verse 12 and the angel of the Lord appeared to him did the angel of the Lord appear to anybody else no you appeared to who get in the angel of the Lord which is God himself amen he came to Gideon amen and he appeared to him amen amen the message that came from the angel was to all Israel but the coming of the angel is not going to all Israel the angel is individual we okay and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him the Lord is with you all no thee the angel is talking to who Gideon the Lord is with who Gideon keep that in mind the Lord is with you you who Mighty Man of Valor number one the angel of the Lord say that God number two he says you are a Mighty Man of value amen remember there is to you you know that right there is you and there is also you who is the Angel talking [Music] you you you are who is the Angel referring to you and you because the other you was hiding the stuff yeah how can a mighty man of value hide stuff amen amen what I'm trying to say is when God talked to you he doesn't look at you I don't know if you get my term when God speak to you he doesn't look at you as much as we were nice clothing this morning and we all look nice handsome and pretty and beautiful God don't look at that when God is starting this morning he's not talking at you but God is still talking at you look how God look the Bible says in first Samuel chapter 16 verse 7 but the Lord say unto who Samuel he said look not in his what consonants or on the height of water his stature God doesn't even care about your height amen everybody okay he says because I refuse him for the Lord sees not as water man see when we talk to one another we look at ourselves when God is looking at you he's not really looking at you he's looking at you he said for man look at what on the outward appearance the heart is soul deceived it to you he's looking at you see in that word god acknowledge what looked like him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you need to be very careful when God is talking to you when God tell you I'm strong you will realize the time he tells you you stronger is the time you are really weak [Music] and it's usually a paradox you say I feel weak but God saying you are strong because God is seeing you [Applause] glory to God everybody okay listen to Gideon and give yourself God was talking to who Gideon he said the Lord is with who d Gideon look how Gideon responded verse 13 and Gideon said to him oh my Lord if the Lord be with water us did God tell him he was with them no Hallelujah [Music] when God is preaching this morning he's not preaching to everybody [Applause] leave your wife fell on leave your husband alone leave your brother and your sister alone God is dealing with you [Applause] we want to include everybody did you hear what the pastor say maybe they're not even interested [Music] the Lord is with you oh no the Lord is with us I'm not talking about us did I come to our Israel I come to you I'm talking to you I know who you are amen don't think I didn't see everybody Oh Glory to God and Gideon said to him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us as collective revelation why then is all this befall in US and where Beyond his miracle which our father so the faith is restored remember the prophet came and said hey remember Egypt now when he's talking to the angel of the Lord he's producing the faith of the father he said the Father the faith they had miracle and everything so Gideon is all he's already been restored back to the original faith but he want to see that God entering on sin he says and I wish our father told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from what Egypt the message of the Prophet amen but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of water the midianites and the Lord look upon them know him and say go in this what thy might where was that strength in other words God is looking at Israel I'm in Gideon he say you have a strength you see the strength that you have there go with it not distress but that strength he said go in your mind and you still specific shall save water Israel I just need one person that's it I don't need all Israel I just need one person if I can deal with that person I can handle the remaining amen you shall save Israel from the hand of the water the midianites remember they were without numbers have I not send thee what does it mean to send you because Jesus said as the father yes [Applause] when God sends you you don't go alone [Applause] when God sends you somewhere he's already there he's just waiting on you to catch up [Music] he says he says uh verse uh 15 and he says to him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel now he begins to say I he removed the collective as now the angel of the Lord say good now you begin to identify yourself I was dealing with you now it's no more how can we say this now understand you are talking about me amen but there is a you that is still causing trouble to Gideon watch this you amen his greatest enemy and behold my family is how do you think God didn't know that Moses you think I didn't know you have a problem talking so so you are thinking I made a mistake I should have looked at your impediment before I Choose You that's not the way I'd make my choice [Applause] my family God is with you what else do you need that's enough you have the potential and you get the god with you what else do you want these two things are sufficient [Music] to do the job the potential and the god of the potential [Applause] [Music] sometimes we want to be more humble than God when God said you are Mighty Men of Allah no God you know I'm just a simple guy saved by his grace a wrong confession confession means you repeat What God Says [Music] [Applause] confession doesn't mean you please the people that are around you [Applause] [Music] let them call you you are proud Paul say I'm boasting in the Lord [Applause] all right because we want to bring people in our own humility men talk like men don't talk like you know I'm sorry if I I don't want to offend you you know what men don't talk like that men when they talk to each other they say what's up man how's it going straight ahead that's men [Music] they talk like sisters come on he's he's saying that his family is poor so God has to make sure your family is rich before he uses you [Music] when you were born were you born with even a clothing job say we came and naked how did you get the clothing amen which clothing did Adam and Eve have amen he says behold my family is pouring water in all the trouble everybody knows we are the poorest family so God made a mistake in other words I'm not worthy amen amen and Karma and I am water the leaves of water my father's house thank you I am the least of what my father's house these two things are called complex [Music] [Applause] amen amen it's called a complex you yourself build things about yourself and you lock yourself up because of what somebody told you somebody say you're not ready you begin to believe what does praying means [Applause] who have the responsibility of American Idol in the message to tell people who is president who's not ready [Applause] to Hope [Music] if I don't please you that's not my problem maybe you're not my Academy [Applause] I'm saying that to break your complex in other words don't worry about the outside appeal we take one woman and we put her and we say beauty is this so every woman want to be like that woman and do her like that woman because they told them duties like that your mother told you you were beautiful believe your mother [Applause] believe your mother how many of you you thought you were nobody and you got married [Music] and the one that thought they were beautiful it looks like the man bypassed them [Applause] the day she thinks she got a man she said Oh Praise the Lord this one is coming and the men come and say I want to ask you where is the restroom [Music] we have built complexes for nothing God don't look at you God look at you everybody okay everybody okay verse 15 and he says to him oh my Lord where we shall I save Israel so he's using the wrong eye amen because his eye is my family is poor and I'm the least of my fathers amen listen to God and the Lord said to him surely our water will be with thee when I send you I know what I'm doing you're not going to go alone when I send you it means me and you are going I will be with you and you shall Smite the midianite as what one man how can they multitude with that number you can Smite them as one person what is the key message here you have a choice to either take this or continue with this the angel says you are this God is with you you are a Madman of value the other says you are poor you are the least of your father you have to choose who you want to believe but remember last Sunday God's word is true and everybody else testimony is alive [Applause] come lie when they are contradicting the original plan of God in other words if you seek it's a fact that you are sick but when God say you are healed [Applause] this is now a lie [Applause] if the doctor say again that you are sick you say no that's now it's a lie because now it's contradicting the word of God before God spoke to me you are right but once God speaks it you are no longer right amen you are wrong you are wrong because you're going against God can we learn how to grab God at his word chapter one oh glory to thank you thank you Jesus amen Luke chapter one we've been reading this over and over I wish they can turn my clock out when I read the scripture and then when I start preaching this put it back up then the service starts amen Luke chapter 1 verse 26 you there amen I'm gonna skip some quickly let's go to verse 27. today virgin is passed to a man whose name also Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary I'm going to go quickly and the angel came to her and said hell you that a house highly favored according to the angel Mary is how highly favored amen that are highly favored Kama and water glory the lord is water with thee what did they taught Gideon who's with me so when they say God is with you we think everything is good God was already there amen amen the God is with you same like Gideon amen God is with you bless are you among what women and when she saw him

I'll just go for the sake of time then say Mary to the angel how shall this be seeing a water I know not a man how am I going to deliver Israel out of the median I'm a poor my family is poor you don't do you think God didn't know that you were engaged you're not married yet and God is telling you you're going to have a baby so in other words he looks like God made a mistake if he was a married woman who doesn't have a child she could have said praise the Lord thank you Jesus now I'm going to have a baby but God is asking a baby of somebody who's not even married just engaged hey amen amen and the angel answer and say to her the water the Holy Ghost shall not you [Music] when I tell you something don't worry about how it's going to happen [Applause] you just do me once ever just take

your cousin Elizabeth she also has conceived a son in her water old age and this is the sixth month with her who shall be uh who was called Baron for with God what nothing shall be impossible so what they were asking her was impossible they were asking her The Impossible amen so she has to believe the impossible and God is giving her an example of the impossible you did you see that impossible it happened with God nothing is impossible everybody okay everybody okay listen to this precious word and Mary said behraw the water the handmaid of the Lord me according to what Thy word another word I have accepted division amen I have accepted the message I have accepted the contract I have accepted the proposition amen and the angel did whatever departed from her mission accomplished the engine never say and then say and now I'm gonna enter into you no that's all we need in either way they brought the package you put the signature and the closer they say dildon that's how you can go to sleep amen amen be unto me according to your word let's go to the book of Acts then we move on Lord help me act chapter 27. if you dare you can say Amen ah yeah yeah yeah yeah father help me up I'm gonna try the best that I can for those who read this chapter amen Paul was going toward Italy he was going to Rome amen we are dealing with Acts chapter 27. now let me pull this up so it makes sense in Acts chapter 23 everybody good God spoke to Paul and say the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for us that has testified of me in what Jerusalem so much that bear witness also at what Rome so once when Paul was saying I appeal unto Caesar he already knew why did he only chose Caesar because in act 23 God already gave him the program say you will go to Rome everybody okay and you know that when God has a purpose nothing can stop that purpose it will happen no matter what you already know that you know that right so Paul was going to Rome because God already purpose it that Paul will go there now enough to 27 something is trying to block Paul for reaching that way now it's okay now it's okay in other words something is trying to block the program of God I can preach this in different angle everybody okay so the launched going to Italy and when they moved from one spot to another the wind was wrong amen and they stopped it and they continue again did you read the scripture when they continue Against the Wind was bad and they stop and pop took his diagnostic devices and stick it there and when Paul looked he says red he said something is wrong here verse six amen amen everybody okay amen glory to God and the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria selling into water Italy he's going toward home and he put us there in and we and when we had self slowly many days and scarce will come opposite to notice the wind not allowing us we sell under Crete opposite to someone and hardly passing it he came to a place which is called what the Fair Haven it's a good place a nice place it's called Fair brother Robert amen near unto the city of Lassie now when March time will spend and when selling was now how dangerous because the fast was now already passed Paul admonished them Paul decoded something brother brought them said the Holy Spirit spoke to Paul remember Paul was a prophet [Music] Paul was a prophet I already gave you a scripture for this for people who have trouble saying brother Branham say Paul was a prophet it's not written in the Bible I already gave you the scripture on that acts 13 Verse 1 Paul a prophet everybody okay a prophet and the teacher the Bible says now was much was spent Paul admonished the verse 10 and said to them sir I perceive that this Voyage this trip will be with hurt and much water damage not only to the lady and sheep but also of water Our Lives according to the under the Holy Spirit brother was Paul said this Voyage is going to destroy the ship everybody okay not only the Sheep it will destroy the cargo whatever is in on the ship and he also will destroy the lives of the people including Paul didn't say he's going to destroy your life not my life everybody okay but God told Paul you're going to go to Rome now the holy spirit is decoding a message from hell where Satan is trying to destroy the ship destroyed the cargo and he also destroyed everybody including power because sometimes the devil will try to seek everybody because of you [Applause] many children were killed in Egypt because of Moses many children were killed in Israel because the devil was looking for Jesus Christ [Applause] so you are a dangerous fishy you are very dangerous [Music] [Applause] when you get into an airplane the airplane has two ways either You're Gonna Save everybody or if you go down everybody goes down so you become the salvation of the airplane [Applause] that's why when you're traveling you are quiet because the true palette is you [Music] [Applause] when you are leaving home you say I am going to Canada your word is what is taking the airplane [Applause] father help me move with this sermon everybody okay everybody good verse 11 nevertheless the Centurion water believed there is a matter of Faith there he believed the master of the honor of the ship brother say he taught that he knew more about the Sheep than the Holy Ghost that's what brother Bradham said the Bible says that the Centurion believed the master of the honor of the ship so Paul had the message and the master had the message we okay two messages this one his message is based on the expertise he's an expert he knows disease scientifically he's right [Applause] the scientific approach is against the prophet [Music] [Applause] amen because we have scientific approach that has risen against this message to prove that brother Branham was wrong [Applause] everybody okay verse 11 nevertheless this until you believe the master and the owner of the ship more than those which were spoken by who Paul so they didn't believe Paul and it's a dangerous thing not to believe a prophet can you say Amen because the Bible says in second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 20 believe on the Lord your God and you shall be how established he leave his prophet and you shall do whatever Prosper when you go against the prophet you have blocked your prosperity [Music] [Applause] everybody good everybody good you going like a Titanic or the Titan an impression is guaranteed because you have rejected the word of the prophet cannot continue Hallelujah glory to God verse 12 and because the heaven was not how commodious he was not suitable to the water wintering so logically the place was not even good for the winter Kelly how can we stop here in a place that is not even good why should I stay in this city when he doesn't even give me a future for my family why should I stay in North Carolina [Applause] I need to go away there is opportunity [Music] everybody okay everybody okay this is how we make our decisions what did the prophet say what does the word say before you make your move because if you go against the word of God guarantee you get trouble there [Applause] everybody good glory to God verse 12 and because the heaven was not commodious to enter in the more part did water advise the majority everybody say yes yes it's good it's good it's good you're right you're right how are we going to stay here for the winter so they took a vote the majority say yes everybody okay the advice to depart from there also if by any means they may attend to who feelings to

Softly on you in other words you will see feet begin to open up like you are going through prosperity [Applause] it looks like yes we were right see now everything is working ah we got a big

Rich Young Ruler rejected Jesus Christ he prospered [Applause] he was a soft wind he didn't see hell [Applause] he didn't see her hair was after the suffering when you go against the warming that that one went the first time and work the second time you were the third one pop he became the most damned person everybody criticizing him because he didn't take heed to the prophet the prophet of the year the scientific Prophet that told him what you have is not strong enough to go down there what you have is not strong enough to withstand La audition you need a correct material from the seven angels from William Mayon Branham [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no other message can stand in audition are you with your my brother [Applause] some people are afraid to say their name that's their problem [Applause] [Music] some Churches some Churches in the message don't even want to read brother if a church don't want a weak brother Branham don't even preach there [Applause] have ever put me on tick tock [Music] how can you be ashamed of the messenger the messenger and his message I want [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a wife who doesn't want to quote her husband if it's your wife your wife when she said she said my husband my husband my husband my husband and brother brother is the pastor of the age amen [Music] [Applause] I don't know what to do my friend I don't know what to do Lord help me whoever needed Deliverance in the air somewhere Please Release the break so I can move amen verse 13 and when the south wind blew out softly supposing that they had obtained the water their purpose what did they do losing them in other words everything is working you see the Lord open up the door it's going this one open up it's going that's why we're going over there we call the application work we already got a job over there everything is working everything is good it looks like all hell has paved you they put a red carpet on you you eat the Soft Wind if you are for the messenger and everything is open up then you good but if you went against the prophet and everything is open up it's dangerous [Music] um [Applause] [Music] amen and they lose their and sell clothes by water Creed verse 14 but not longer after day Rose there thereafter there arose against City Water attempts to a swing attempt your sweet cold water you roll Clayton amen if a thing went fine we have rejected the message we have come out of the message we moved we did this we left that place we left the church everything is going slofty wait for the Euro Clan [Applause] when the EU Academy is coming it is breaking everything down [Music] amen it is destroying your move completely because you try to make the prophet alive with your scientific research you try to prove that power was wrong [Applause] person don't go you say the weather is good now see the soft wind is growing everybody okay everybody okay amen watch what happened to verse 15 and when the ship was what cause and could not bear up with the water the wind we did water we let her drive in other words now you are driven by circumstances because you rejected the word you are now taken up with something you don't know because of the decision you taken was against the word of God was against the prophet of God you are doomed you need to make sure among your crew every destination because Paul was against it but as a prisoner he didn't have any choice so sometimes we are trapped in circumstances that it is not me who took the decision it was my parent that took the decision it was not me but because you have something with God [Applause] glory to God father help me up where am I at Lord amen chapter verse 20. because if you read they begin to take all the cargo and throw it on the sea you're gonna lose everything You're Gonna Lose Carl accident this doesn't work this doesn't work this stuff you want to listen to All motivational speaker the God is continuing to be driven this way amen amen you will take all the tap in the Bible oh job no it's not job it is eurocard you're not job because you rejected the word of God job didn't reject the word of God I don't have time to listen to preachers I'm just saying what I have to say everybody okay not that I don't want to listen my time is just booked so if you think I'm listening to you that's why I'm directing this you're wasting your time everybody okay jump to verse 20. and when this son and one need the water the sun no water stars in how many days appeared you on the sea for 40 days no sun no moon under your clutter to prove that the prophet was wrong everybody okay neither son appear no star and no small Tempest lay on us what oh that which should be safe was how then taken away remember before all of this God told Paul you will go to Rome amen look what Paul did father help me verse 20 but after a long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and say sir you should have hearkened to me not to God to me because he was God's poking man the mouthpiece of God [Applause] everybody okay you should have spoken to uh uh harken to me and not have loot from Crete and to have gained this harm and loss and now I exalt you to be water of good cheer you telling somebody in 14 days don't see the sun no moon going boom boom boom that be of Gucci in other words begin to laugh be happy for there shall be no loss of water any man's life among you but of the water sure so according to the board the plan of the devil will destroy the ship it didn't belong to Paul it will destroy the cargo it didn't belong to Paul but when it comes to the life because Paul is part of that God pushed the brick and say Satan don't take the life of Job [Applause] everybody okay everybody good where are we going verse 22 and now I exalt you we already read that verse 23 for there stood by me this night the water angel of God the angel of the Lord that made Gideon the angel of the Lord whose water I am I belong to that angel a and whom what I serve I'm serving that angel so that angel is God everybody okay saying fear not who oh you must be brought before who Caesar because that's what I told you before and love God has given you all them that sell water with thee so the life of the people are now dependent on the life of God the life of the family of Rahab have the heart Hallelujah the Bible says wait for sir be of Gucci for water you there verse 20 uh five for I believe who God so Paul have to believe the message of the Angel regardless of the circumstances Gideon have to believe the message of the Angel of the Lord regardless of his present condition man we have to believe the message of the Angel regardless of her present situation Paul have to believe the message of the Angel regardless of the bad situation he found himself in everybody okay amen hey that it shall be even as it was taught me however we must cast Upon A certainly amen amen amen let me try to skip some of them quickly job to verse uh uh Lord have mercy job to verse job to versa 33 and while the day was coming on Paul besought them out to do what take meat when the message came to Paul Paul didn't only spoke the message but Paul began to behave according to his vision at the beginning nobody was eating including Paul because the Bible say it was a long abstinence right but since the angel unfolded the plan Paul changed his behavior he got over there he went to the microwave and the ship is going this way and he's pushing the microwave and the people are looking at him amen verse 33 and what the day was coming on probably sought them all to take me saying this is the 14th day two weeks a complete circle that you have carried and continue doing what fasting who put them on faster not listening to the prophet you will go to fasting to fasting trying to bring God outside of the prophet thing won't work having taken water nothing wherefore I pray you to take some meat for disease for your health for they shall not ahead fall from your head fall from the head of any of you and when he has just spoken he did what it took bread gave thanks to God this is can you behave like that everybody okay and give thanks in the presence of a demo and when he had broken it he began to do what eat then where they all of good cheer and they also took water some me so when the supper begin to eat they say you know what man I'm hungry too because Paul God spoke to Paul God didn't speak to all of it God spoke to Gideon God didn't speak to all of them when you begin to act according to your revelation [Applause] it's like a perfume it will begin to move on and he will begin to affect somebody else and before you know it everybody when David killed Goliath all Israel stood up nobody want to go home anymore without the blood on the shin if I go back my wife would ask me how many did you kill I must Chase these people because one person stood for something that everybody amen you stand for God Alone [Applause] because of your position [Applause] some children are struggling because the parent didn't take a decision it's the parent you would have condemned the thing the child would look at the parent and say I'm behind my father but the child is looking at Daddy and daddy is under hesitation we are the one confusing our children [Applause] stand for the message your children will stand for that message amen [Applause] if you don't stand for the message how are the children gonna stand for the message you are coward you want to please everybody you wanna be friend to everybody not with the message you leave the message that leaves you amen because I have to make a stand for my family amen [Applause] I don't want my family to be confused glory to God Lord help me where am I ate where am I verse 37 and when there and when and we were all in the ship how many people 203 score and 16 Souls 276 people 200. three score his score is 20. three score is 20 times three it's 60 and 16 200 plus 60 plus 16 is 276. 276 people would like to die but because one person was in that ship and that person has a covenant with God [Applause] amen the life of those people were given to power in other words if any of them die Paul and God are in trouble [Music] everybody okay let me read this quote here brother Branham saying for death stood by me this not the angel of God whose servant I am and whom I served saying water fear not Paul that must be brought before who Caesar for God has given thee all them that sell with thee brother Branham say listen at what his faith in his vision he must have faith to his vision [Music] [Applause] so when that Vision come it is not enough you must believe that Vision amen to me according to your word you must my subject this morning is the four phases of roof faith in your water Revelation vision God will give you a revelation but you must believe it God will tell you who you are but you must believe your package [Music] everybody good so far everybody okay amen everybody okay father help me up what are we dealing with ah where am I at I'm good in time my friend we are good don't worry when I say good we really good amen we know clearly and we understand clearly now that God has a plan for us he has a project for us he had a purpose for us God have an agenda for us and that agenda was hidden in God and it's not a bad agenda it is a good agenda because Paul is saying that eyes have nothing no water you're heard neither water have entered into the heart of man it's not revealed yet the things which God has what prepared for them that love him so God has something that he has prepared for you and it's a good thing amen amen verse 10 but God has water revealed them to us by the water his spirit for the spirit to do whatever search is all things yeah the Water Deep things of God am I the word whatever God has for you is still blocked is still locked in God and for you to receive yes that information all that Vision or that Revelation or that instruction that you need to be delivered you need an agent that's gonna take that information from God and bring it to you everybody okay the agent that take the information from God unto you is the Holy Spirit that's why Paul is saying that those things are delivered or revealed to us by the what spirit because the spirit goes into God and goes into deep the Deep of God and go inside and say who is it it's brother so and so and the spirit pick up what he has there and he come up with it and he come and delivered to you are we clear so far Paul says that for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the water spirit of God so to know things from God you must be connected to the Holy Ghost amen that's why the Holy Ghost come in your life to waking you up and to give you those things verse 12. now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of what God that we may what know the things that are freely given to us of God the spirit we are freely given to us by who God in other words what God has for you is a gift amen because it's really in other words God has gifts your purpose is a gift it's a present amen because it's freely you don't pay for it they just go bring it and give it to you everybody okay so God what he has for you in store is a gift it's a present amen where are you trying to go the Bible says this in the book of Deuteronomy 29 29 that the secret things belong to her the Lord our God you okay another word when something is in God it is not your responsibility what is a secret in God you are not accountable for it you are not liable to it God cannot condemn you if you don't know or if God have never told you what he has for you in other words when things are in God he put God in danger because if you die brother and you have not fulfilled that God is in trouble everybody good so it is God responsibility to find a way to remove the liability from him [Music] because if God judge you and he never told you God himself will be guilty God doesn't want to be guilty the Bible said nobody can win God in a court so God make an effort to deliver your package as soon as possible so that the liability is no longer on him the liability is on you everybody okay so when God uh uh Moses says here that the things which belong unto unto uh the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are house revealed belong to who us and to our children how forever in other words when God brings something that belongs to you and delivered that to you that thing don't belong to God anymore he was for God when he was Secret when it's reveal it doesn't belong to God I'm reading the Bible in other words the transferring of gift of the transferring of a vision or the transferring of a revelation is a transferring of liability [Applause] it is a transferring of accountability it is a true fearing that God is pushing something to you now you are responsible to do what that thing says amen why brother Branham says this glory to God yey foreign for instance could not believe that God was Enderman that was the biggest obstacle that they have to do what climb over was how him being a man yet made himself how God they could not see how God could dwell in a human flesh in human flesh in all ages in all times God has always thought well in man is God's agent in every generation God speak to his people through water human lives he always chooses who someone or something that he can do what use 96 God uses man for his water agent is that right how always God uses a man to be who his agent continue my friend Jesus was God's agent and who Elijah was God's agent and who John was God's agent if this age God has a witness Lord let me be your wife agent [Applause] so when God brings something to you you are liable in other words God expects you now to be responsible for your gift [Music] let's go to Roman one as I'm climbing father help me glory to God Romans chapter one if you dare you can say Amen thank you Jesus faith in your revelation faith in your vision when your vision comes to you you must believe it amen you must be saying be unto me in either way that I believe what you say because when God is transferring whatever belongs to you he is also transferring himself remember you don't go yourself he goes with you I will be with you the Holy Ghost will come on you so when you are receiving what he says you are receiving him you are receiving his ability you are receiving cookies [Applause] because God of God watches over his word when God releases the word God is in that way [Applause] in other words if you ask God fulfill that he said no I already gave it to her if it's not done it's not me it's her it's him Romans chapter 1 verse 19 if you dare you can say amen amen because that which may be known of God is how manifest in them is that the word God made known to them for God has showed it to them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are now made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are how without excuse in other words once God we feel it you are with that excuse before Mary was with excuse but when the angel came and spoke to Mary no more excuse for Mary everybody okay verse 21 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as what God neither were water thankful but became van in the water imagination and the Foolish Heart was water darkened so what God unfold himself to you God is accepting you to be thankful and he's expecting you to impress what he's saying and to act according to it are we together are we together let's go to act chapter 19 chapter 17. then we saw my friend amen amen amen Acts chapter 17. amen amen amen if you dare you can say Amen acts 17 verse 29 the Bible says this that for in him in God we live and we do what we move verse 20 8 and we move and have our being as certain also as your own power to have said for we are also his offspring verse 29 my apology for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like to go all silver all Stone driven by art or men's devices and the time of this water ignorance God did what wink that but now commandeth oh man everywhere to do whatever repent in other words when you did not know God closed his eyes in other words when you were dancing in a nightclub God didn't want to see that because you were ignored everybody okay everybody okay God will another word that God Wicked that means god look over it because you didn't know any better but once God revealed to you that the eyes of God are open to you are we okay now that's why Paul said everything that I did before I did it in ignorance in other words God doesn't look at that [Applause] [Music] they knew that you talking about poor family then you that is the least of my father the you that was bad then you that killed somebody in Egypt God damn look at that amen when you did it God went because you didn't know you are not responsible for it but now once God revealed to you it belongs to you last one let's go to John 3. I hope somebody caught what I just say Amen the you that you looking at yourself that you built a complex with God ignored that one the complex man God ignore him God ignore her when you are doing all you think you are doing bad to that God doesn't look at that because you are ignorant when the Devil comes he said hey she didn't know what else do you want she didn't know how am I going to blame her for something she didn't know you therefore you knew what did you do about it this one didn't know amen amen amen Elizabeth was condemned or who satire was condemned because Zechariah had the example in the Bible that's why God said I'm going to shut your mouth so no negativity come out of your mouth anymore but because Mary did not know Norman not scripture in the Bible's ever this thing happened God winted that he said I all have some explanation so when you were ignorant God waited that so when God is coming to talk to you stop bringing out your past [Applause] when God bring you the vision of your life stop bringing that old man stop revolving those bad souvenirs because those souvenir God Wicked that [Applause] because you are ignorant you didn't know what you were doing even if you were born in the message you were not born again yet you didn't know what you were doing because Paul was religious and he called himself a chief sinner so you can be born in a message you didn't drink any Bee by your Chief sinner because you did it ignorantly you didn't have the Revelation yet and God went to that can I continue amen John 3 verse 27 the Bible says that John answer and say what a man can receive water nothing except he be given him from water heaven so there is nothing that you can receive if it doesn't come from heaven nothing nothing and I say nothing amen so going back to the board Moses said the secret things belong unto the Lord our God in other words when it's healed it is not our responsibility he will stays with God but those things which are revealed belong to who us once God unfolds something to you God have changed ownership amen [Applause] everybody okay amen and it's not to you but it's also to your Waters children when division was given to power he also saved everybody that was in the book amen [Music] that's why God rebuked Moses because when Moses met God God demonstrated to him who he was God God Moses the plan of his life God told him the purpose of Moses and every time trouble come Moses had a tendency to go back to God until God looked he said hey why are you crying to me you are the one responsible I thought you I made you God [Applause] it's written in the Bible when you are going to Egypt didn't that tell you that you are God in other words I want to take a break you take the godship and handle Egypt right one now God to me again to talk to me and say God help me he said Moses when you were going to Egypt I told you something I say that I make you God you when you meet Pharaoh you are Jehovah [Applause] [Music] over here and when your brother that is your prophet so when you meet Pharaoh it is Jehovah talking to pharaoh God have had a business to mind [Music] I already just for the responsibility to you I'm expecting you to believe what I told you and to act according to what I told you you must have faith in your vision amen you must have faith in your Resurrection amen you must have faith in what God tell you that you are and you must act according to it amen everybody okay everybody good so when they leave God it belongs to me it is no longer the responsibility of God Moses how do you go I will go with you he said what do you have in your hand you don't remember the burning bush what happened over there what do you have in your hand take it do it this way brother Branham said that was the name of Jesus Christ so when trouble come what do you have to do breathe the holy name in prayer everybody okay why cry speak you crying to me again after everything that I have unfolded I told you when you go in there I'm gonna hide and fail did not tell you so when Pharaoh is hardened what is the problem I told you I'm gonna hide and Pharaoh because I have an agenda when he's there when he says no you struck when you say no you struck we already already talked this so you already have the movie before the move is played out you have the preview of the movie You Must Believe your movie everybody good let me continue he says but don't think which I revealed belongs to who us and to our children the promise is unto us you and to your children the promise of the Holy Ghost that we may want to do all the words of the so the purpose that God is revealing things to you it's not for you to stay mesmerized there and say ah it looks beautiful oh I never knew I'm a Mighty Men of Valor that's not the reason why in other words I'm coming today you've got to fight [Applause] I'm coming to anoint you like wake up I'm telling you get to work I'm revealing to you your vision so you can do it that's why when Paul receives the vision Paul came out he said be of Gucci bring me the food from the refrigerator he went to the microwave everything is good now why Paul begins to act according to the vision amen [Music] [Applause] why because Paul believed his vision he believed his Revelation it's gonna be to me as the angel of the Lord have said that angel never lie to me if he spoke that's it he told me I will go back to Rome if I'm gonna go to Rome this thing will happen everybody okay everybody good glory to God listen to uh habakkuk the Bible said this in verse 2 the Lord answered me and say write the Water Division and make it plan upon water tables that he may run that the water read it so the one who's going to read the vision must have division for the vision is yet for water in a point in time but at the end it shall what speak and not water lie don't eat Terry do water wait for it when it's already revealed to you even if you tell me wait for it be patient safe and precious Gods together division cannot lie God cannot lie it is impossible for God to lie [Applause] cannot continue he says don't eat Terry do what wait for it because it will surely come it will not what Terry foreign the Bible said don't eat Terry and the Bible said he will not tell so they reached two times there there is your time and God's time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in your time he might be telling because you want it to happen now but it's not God's time yet in God's time it will happen according to that time [Applause] did I miss you no no in other words if God say September 9th tomorrow today is September 10th right okay let me change the date so somebody can take it today if God says September 10th this one will not tell but if God told you on September 7 you probably am thinking maybe September 8th is gonna happen God said don't eat Terry you wait but it will not hear it in other words when the rich the date that God predestinated it will happen exactly on the Block in the minute in the second exactly how God said [Applause] the word if according to your time it is taking time be patient but just know God will keep his word amen whatever God said will happen amen no matter what [Music] that's why you must trust your vision amen you must stress your revelation you must trust what God told you it will always happen in your vision have fat in your Revelation have faith in the word of God he will never lie Heaven and Earth might pass away but his word will always [Applause] why God says so God says so and abaka said wait for because it will surely come it will not water behold his soul which is lift up is not upright in him but what just shall live by his faith they just shall live by what hey who they were talking about vision now they're talking about faith in the Old Testament they were talking about Vision now they said they just shall live by revelation I walk by faith and not by sight sight my Terry by faithful don't Terry amen everybody okay so far everybody good so far therefore brother Branham says this that we met a member of the Virgin Brad will do what love him and they will have his water potentials when God is coming to talk to Gideon because he didn't get potential he was a married man of fellow he said we will have his potential in other words the potential of God are in you that's why God can transfer his plan to you amen because you can act like him [Applause] [Music] in other words you are his caliber [Music] [Applause] God don't handle his business to nobody when he gives it to you he already contacted you to worry [Applause] he says for he is the water their head and all powers belongs to him they are subject to him as the member of her body are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the who son Jesus never did anything until he was first shown him by the what Father John 5 19. in other words Jesus when he acted he always acted after Revelation or a vision that's why he always succeeded can I continue amen there had this harmony is now to exist between hope to grow and what his bride Jesus time is finished he shows her his water Word of Life God revealed to you God unfold his word she does What receives it like Mary she never doubtsy you must receive or have faith therefore nothing can do whatever harm her in other words will receive your vision what you accepted What God Says help push the brick thank you nothing can harm her not even water death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is where in the bride as he was where in Mary [Applause] the bride has the estimate of who Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performed the water command of the word the command of the word in his water name for she has that sets the Lord then the word is quickened by who the spirit and he come to Water Pass like a seed that is planted in water he comes to full Harvest serving water its purpose the reason why God unfolded your plan is God has seen your potential now it's up to you to believe who you are and what God is saying about you and now you act upon it father help me glory to God brother Branham saying when you come to Total obedience then you can have water possession but until you totally obey you got to completely do it Surrender Your Own thoughts your water own will mine and let the mind of Christ do what operate in you so when God bring your revelation or your vision or your plan you must change you must turn the switch from manual to automatic everybody okay you must remove manual is you doing everything you the one pushing the gear you're the one pushing the whatever you the one doing you need to remove that you need to push it in automatic amen and when you push automatic it is not your mind it is the computer mind of the car that begin to change the gears come on everybody okay automatic doesn't mean he's out of control automatic means their heart their mind of the computer has taken over the car [Music] so when God bring you your plan your project your Revelation whatever he wants you to do at a specific time you need to humble yourself [Applause] you need to lower yourself you need to release your mind your matter your sake you need to give it away and you must let now the mind of God begin to operate in you in other words you need to move out of your way because you will be blocking yourself because you are the poorest of your family because you are the least of your family God already knows that move out of the way let God do his own work father help me brother Brahman says this if we could throw ourselves wow completely to God and to his water will and be lost to our own that and just let the mind of Christ beware in us damn same operations of the spirit will work through us just as the Natural Things does just the same because we were first genesis created for that purpose to do what control to do what to rule to do what and to praise God to do what live for God Jesus say if ye abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if he abided me and my word about what in you so when the program of God is revealed to Gideon Gideon not surrender his thought and believe What God Says Mary must surrender her thought and say be unto me according to what you have said Paul have to surrender his thought and say you know what I believe that angel it's just going to be as the Angels say matter of fact I change I'm not anxious anymore I can eat now because for 14 days I was not able to eat now that I got a revelation from God that everything will be okay that's not my problem even if you bring shock in the ocean I'm laughing no shark will bite me amen there won't be no shark biting me when a shark come he sees me he proved to the other direction when your vision is revealed even demon will avoid you when you go to the hospital when you go to your work people are coughing beside you but you go home nothing happens because the semen knows you're not the one they're supposed to attack [Applause] let me land the ship my friend brother Branham say what is faith bear with me I'm going to land the ship he says what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you I'm reading brother that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God [Applause] the will of God for your life God reveal it to you by faith so what you call Faith is not just faith it is the will of God for you it is what God wants you to do it is what God is expecting from you and God bring it as a faith as a revelation as a vision you must take it because once it's revealed it don't belong to God anymore father help me up brother Branham say just simple trying to hide behind some kind of church doctrine instead of coming out and saying you ain't got no faith that's all Satan never received the Holy Ghost and will never receive the Holy Ghost he ain't got nothing than to give you what faith it's God that is God the faith and just as you are filled with God you are filled with water babe you are the Son of God you are like her God speaks the word and he creates itself his word the creative power how how the world come here he made it out of Faith which was not he just said Let It Be and here it is he believes he's on what word let me nail it here when God bring you the program of your life when God bring you your package your gift because whatever you have is a free gift of God everybody okay when God brings it to you God is transferring his omnipotence in other words God now expects you to behave like him because he belongs to him he was the one responsible to do it now he changed he gave it to you now you the one to do it that's why the Bible say all things are possible to God and all things are possible to him that believe when you believe you become like God father help me learn this ship Ephesians 2 verse 8 the Bible says for by grace are you what to say through what faith and that not of yourself it is water the gift of God so faith is what the gift of God because everything was given to you how ever thing that belongs to you is free even your faith is free [Applause] your faith is a gift because what they're bringing you is already a gift is not the word you cannot manufacture faith you don't work for faith God will deliver that to you the Bible say in James 1 every good gift and every how perfect give is from where above and cometh down from the father of what light with whom is know what variableness need a shadow of waters something God will never change his mind [Applause] God can never sit down and say I made a mistake even if you make a mistake after you receive it he won't change God's program because Moses never lost Moses God told him he's not going to enter in the Promised Land what was he doing on man Transfiguration how did he get there how did he get there how did he get there in other words God will never lose Moses he won't change his mind about you once God give you something that said God cannot come and say you know when you ask me I was too busy I didn't hear what you're saying and now I realize that what you were asking me was big we need to sit down and renegotiate God doesn't do that there is no valuableness was God opened his hand and give it to you it's forever not therefore can take it away from you that's why you must believe it that it's for me [Applause] [Music] let's now hear my brother brought him say I'm going to stop here we have faith in our heart the faith of who God in our hearts the faith of who God amen because it's a gift that's right God take his faith and drop it in you so that when he sends you his gift let me let me finish this way God wanna give you something he look at you he said she won't receive it God take a part of him and put in you and the path of God entering you and get into position to receive the gift so when God sent the gift God in you receives the gift so it's no longer you God is working with God to get you blessed [Applause] they're giving you a free gift of faith to receive the free gift from God so the one receiving the gift is faithful the faith of God so God is believing God [Applause] has happened [Applause] all you have to do is be out to me according to your word God will treat bless you let's stop here [Applause] we stop here we will pick up from there Lord willing amen it's God believe in God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] why all this time you didn't believe it why do you only believe now what makes you believe Paul already received the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost was talking to the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost pick it up and that's it is God another word God is determined give you what he purposed to give you regardless and to make sure he doesn't fail he takes you out of the way so that himself speak himself receive and his mid-selves believe it and himself manifested all you have to say is be unto me according to your word and that's it and just continue your route Mary whatever happened will have to happen you must have faith in the vision you must have faith in the Revelation you must have faith in the world that God is speaking to you through this prophet when a preacher comes here and he's sending the word you must take it and believe it because why did you come to speak to me if it was not my time and even though he Terry wait division one life it might tell you according to us but he won't tell recording to God it will happen in his own time let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this afternoon father thanking you once again for your grace for your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking to us and unfolding this channel to us Lord so that whoever was struggling about this message maybe not here maybe elsewhere maybe who will listen to this later on father may you stabilize them to understand that this message is that safe for the Lord this is God provided way for this entire and when we cling to this message we are bound to success all the way to make it to the rapture because this message is the Original Seed it will produce itself according to it father many times you ask us things that humanly speaking when we look in the scripture we feel like we don't qualify and it's a human part of us where father you understand it well because you yourself when you look at the cross you ask the father to take the cup away but father nevertheless you humble yourself and you become obedient even to The Obedience of the Cross because you had to believe the vision and fulfill the vision as Paul of old says that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision yes father each one of us here this morning those that are here and those that are streaming you have a purpose for our life you have an agenda for us yes and you taught us that it's for an expected end meaning we will come out right because you when you start a journey you are the alpha and you also the Omega and father I pray Lord father yes that you who says that faith is a gift may you help us Lord because we've grown up in a society that have built complex surrandas our family built complex around us our health our doctors father the civilization this cooling that we went through we poke so much in our memories until those things became a hindrance for the working of the spirit but father may you give us that revelation that will help us climb above our complexes so that we understand that when you're looking at us you don't look at the continents you don't look at the height you don't look at which family we came from you don't look Lord father about a position in the family whether we are the eldest or whether we are the middle or whether we are the youngest that's not what you're looking at you don't even look at the city saying that from Nazareth is a bad City if you were looking at the city Mary would have failed if you were looking at the family Gideon would not have been taken if you were looking at David he would not be Lord father elected but father you pass all those things and you look at your plan and the predestinated seed that you have with our individual life father that's why I'm praying Lord that you have that Faith to your children so that they can have faith to believe your word and father to Humble themselves and to obey totally to the vision to this message to Humble ourselves knowing Lord father that when we believe your prophet father who will prosper bless your children and strengthen them touch those that are sick and those Lord father that I have requests and expected certain things to happen father may you granted unto them we thank you for everything and commit this wonderful and precious congregation both visible and invisible unto the hand in Jesus precious name amen God bless you we love you Church thank you God's abiding peace is in my soul today yes I feel it now yes I feel it now [Applause] I cannot tell you [Music] he has given peace [Music] [Applause] [Music] he is
