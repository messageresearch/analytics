[56:33] sisters
[56:35] everybody okay but when Jesus came to
[56:38] their home
[56:40] each sister chose their own place
[56:45] everybody okay one chose the feet of
[56:49] Jesus
[56:50] and Marta chose a certain place
[56:53] but if you look
[56:55] Naturally Speaking
[56:57] there is nothing wrong that Marta done
[57:05] watch
[57:06] and she had a sister call Mary
[57:10] which also sat at Jesus feet and heard
[57:14] water so Jesus was in this house and
[57:18] Jesus was talking
[57:20] and the word that came out of Jesus we
[57:23] know it's the word of eternal life so
[57:25] Jesus was having a service in this house
[57:30] your boss just drop it to me now Jesus
[57:34] was having a house meeting
[57:38] he just dropped right now that's why I'm
[57:41] saying that Jesus was having a house
[57:44] meeting amen and Mary chose to be at the
[57:48] house meeting right at the feet of Jesus
[57:51] Christ to listen to what Jesus is
[57:55] talking in the house meeting
[57:57] are we okay let's look at Marta where
[58:01] she is
[58:03] verse 40 do you know where I got this
[58:08] I just got it few minutes ago in the
[58:10] office because your boss talked to me
[58:14] and I have to tell you whoever have a
[58:17] tendency to miss church to miss house
[58:19] meeting to do everything that you can to
[58:23] keep you away at the very last minute
[58:25] you will pick up something that will
[58:27] move you away from the church or away
[58:29] from a meeting or away for something
[58:31] that is spiritual you need to listen to
[58:33] this
[58:35] he says but Marta was Gilbert do you
[58:40] know what kilbert means
[58:43] do you know what he means she was
[58:45] distracted
[58:47] amen she was burdened
[58:51] amen Marta was cooking for Jesus
[58:57] do you follow me Martha if I don't get
[59:01] to what I want to preach no problem but
[59:03] I have to say what the boss is given to
[59:05] me MARTA was distracted not going in a
[59:10] nightclub
[59:11] she was not distracted because she went
[59:14] to the Ball Game
[59:16] because if you do that you completely
[59:18] backsliding amen but when Jesus was
[59:22] having the house meeting Marta was drawn
[59:25] to something else in pretense of working
[59:29] for Jesus Christ
[59:33] we talk about pretense yesterday some of
[59:36] you are lost because you were not there
[59:37] amen Marta went and did something and
[59:42] what she was doing
[59:44] she was doing it for Jesus but she was
[59:47] doing that at the same time that Jesus
[59:51] is talking
[59:56] do you follow me your boss just tell me
[59:59] something right now listen what he's
[1:00:01] saying
[1:00:02] brother I'm saying there is no way a
[1:00:05] minister can speak on the pope and you
[1:00:08] give a message
[1:00:10] because it's a disorder
[1:00:13] he said the spirit must wait until the
[1:00:17] sermon is finished then you can give the
[1:00:19] message in other word when we start
[1:00:22] preaching the word nobody should be
[1:00:25] talking in the sun booth
[1:00:27] except when it's necessary
[1:00:30] nobody should be on the hallway talking
[1:00:35] nobody should be in the in the cry room
[1:00:39] sitting and talking
[1:00:41] except you doing something like sister
[1:00:43] can you give me a diaper yes sit down
[1:00:46] and do this
[1:00:47] because the master is talking
[1:00:52] amen you can move into another position
[1:00:56] and engage into a talk and if they ask
[1:01:00] you you say no no I'm doing something
[1:01:01] like this but the talk you're doing is
[1:01:04] not according to what is happening you
[1:01:07] out of order
[1:01:08] Amen brother amen amen do you understand
[1:01:14] you will love me one day amen amen he
[1:01:16] said but Martha verse 30 was killed in
[1:01:19] other words was distracted about much
[1:01:22] water serving who was she serving the
[1:01:25] devil was she serving the people in the
[1:01:28] nightclub was she a waitress said the
[1:01:30] restaurant she was serving Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] but the Bible called that he was a
[1:01:35] distraction
[1:01:36] he's serving Jesus a destruction it is a
[1:01:39] destruction when Jesus Christ is
[1:01:41] speaking in other words when God is
[1:01:43] having a service
[1:01:45] whatever you trying to do that will keep
[1:01:48] you away from the service of God it
[1:01:51] becomes a destruction amen even though
[1:01:54] you're doing that for Jesus Christ no I
[1:01:56] went to do this no I went to visit
[1:01:58] somebody at the hospital it is good
[1:02:01] but when did you do it you did it when

[1:03:55] the time because they will try to keep
[1:03:57] you away from the things of God away
[1:03:59] from the things of God and you don't
[1:04:01] discern and you think you're doing

[1:16:52] my vision you took my time so give me my
[1:16:54] time
[1:16:55] Daniel spoke and say I saw in my vision
[1:16:58] by night and behold the four wings of
[1:17:02] Heaven strove upon the great sea for
[1:17:04] those that were yesterday you remember
[1:17:05] what they see me now
[1:17:07] and the four beasts and the and four
[1:17:10] great beasts came out from the sea
[1:17:12] diverse or different one from another
[1:17:15] I'm gonna suck on the first one
[1:17:17] for now the first was like a lion you
[1:17:21] might be seated and head ego wings
[1:17:25] I beheld till the wings thereof were
[1:17:27] plucked and he was lift up from the
[1:17:30] Earth
[1:17:31] and made stand upon the feet as a man
[1:17:34] and immense heart was given to him again
[1:17:38] I'm going to refresh this at the
[1:17:40] beginning this Spirit was not in a human
[1:17:42] being
[1:17:43] it was just a spirit on the kingdom that
[1:17:46] was moving amen but after a while that
[1:17:50] spirit will receive will have a human
[1:17:52] being that is available from a spirit in
[1:17:56] the land that spirit will have a human
[1:17:59] being available
[1:18:01] to learn
[1:18:04] or to give
[1:18:06] their heart
[1:18:08] Amen to that spirit amen
[1:18:12] but before that happened the wings of
[1:18:15] the ego must be plugged off
[1:18:19] hey everybody okay in other words the
[1:18:21] wings of the ego
[1:18:24] block incarnation
[1:18:29] the wings of ego
[1:18:33] blocks
[1:18:35] incarnation
[1:18:38] amen as long as the wings are there
[1:18:41] there is no way that Spirit can move
[1:18:44] from a spirit and enter a human being
[1:18:45] you have to take the wings out when you
[1:18:48] take the wings out then that spirit will
[1:18:51] enter somebody
[1:18:52] and that person become talking it's the
[1:18:55] Devil Himself everybody okay
[1:18:58] let's go to Daniel 12.
[1:19:02] glory to God
[1:19:06] will be okay

[1:19:39] you now and you call me deceiver like
[1:19:41] that woman no it won't happen
[1:19:43] Daniel chapter 12 verse 8.
[1:19:47] and I heard
[1:19:49] but I understood not
[1:19:51] then say that I oh my Lord what shall
[1:19:55] the end of these things of these things
[1:19:58] and he say go your way Daniel
[1:20:02] for the words are closed up and sealed
[1:20:06] they are kept secret until the time of
[1:20:09] the end
[1:20:10] many shall be purified and made white
[1:20:14] and tried with this word
[1:20:17] amen but the wicked shall do wickedly
[1:20:22] and none of the wicked shall understand
[1:20:29] only the wise virgin
[1:20:32] will understand and what made you wise
[1:20:36] is the second novel
[1:20:39] only those that have that second
[1:20:41] anointing will understand we'll
[1:20:45] understand what the word that has been
[1:20:47] sealed in the book
[1:20:49] everybody okay let's go to revelation
[1:20:52] 17.
[1:20:57] only the wise
[1:20:58] will understand
[1:21:00] glory to God
[1:21:02] Revelation 17 verse 12. if you dare you
[1:21:06] can say Amen
[1:21:08] the Bible says and the ten horn you know
[1:21:11] what he means
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:13] which you sow are Ten Kings
[1:21:17] so this Beast that have seven horns are
[1:21:21] seven heads and ten horns
[1:21:24] it's a beast
[1:21:25] and the Beast have seven heads
[1:21:29] and he have ten horns
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:33] if you remember those horns had crowns
[1:21:36] you remember you don't take a crown and
[1:21:38] put on the horn it's telling you that
[1:21:41] horn is not really a horn it's a symbol
[1:21:44] because you Crown the people you're
[1:21:47] crying the king you're crying a human
[1:21:49] being brother Brian I'm saying you don't
[1:21:51] cry in the spirit you have to Crown a
[1:21:53] human being so when they say ten horns
[1:21:56] with crowns they're already telling you
[1:21:58] that that horn is a human being
[1:22:02] did I lose somebody
[1:22:04] so these that's why the Bible say they
[1:22:07] are Ten Kings
[1:22:09] everybody okay
[1:22:10] they are Ten Kings
[1:22:12] glory to God
[1:22:15] I'm on the military airplane this thing
[1:22:18] is deadly
[1:22:20] but we're not going to crush
[1:22:22] that's clear that's guaranteed
[1:22:25] and there is no crashing everybody okay
[1:22:27] but just keep your helmet
[1:22:30] because the where we go in there you
[1:22:34] need to be able to breathe good amen
[1:22:37] glory to God
[1:22:39] amen I'm in 10 I mean uh 12. the 10
[1:22:43] horns which you saw are 10 Kings which
[1:22:46] receive no Kingdom as yet
[1:22:49] amen but receive power
[1:22:53] as king
[1:22:56] nobody gave them the kingdom
[1:22:59] amen but they already have power
[1:23:02] so they are operating with a power that
[1:23:05] is not a king power
[1:23:09] can I repeat it again
[1:23:11] do you want me to repeat
[1:23:14] do you want me to repeat let's read it
[1:23:16] together
[1:23:18] there are Ten Kings which receive no
[1:23:21] Kingdom as yet
[1:23:22] so they don't have Kingdom as yet nobody
[1:23:25] crammed them yet everybody okay but they
[1:23:28] are operating with a power
[1:23:31] if you're not crown and you are
[1:23:34] operating as a king who are you who are
[1:23:37] you
[1:23:38] where you chosen were you elected no so
[1:23:44] how did you get in the power
[1:23:50] for you to be elected you must go
[1:23:53] through election when they go to
[1:23:55] election you win the election then they
[1:23:57] bring a Quran they say this is the
[1:23:59] pastor
[1:24:03] everybody okay and then they put a crown
[1:24:06] on you but if the dev had done an
[1:24:08] election and you begin to Reign like you
[1:24:10] the pastor of the church
[1:24:13] it's a coup d'etat
[1:24:16] it's a dictator
[1:24:19] it's a dictator he took the power in a
[1:24:23] different way but he didn't take it by
[1:24:25] election no
[1:24:26] maybe he slayed the king for him to take
[1:24:30] his place
[1:24:32] maybe he deceived the Army and went an
[1:24:35] attack and took the power because he
[1:24:38] didn't get the power yet
[1:24:40] are we okay we okay
[1:24:43] so these Ten Kings have something to do
[1:24:46] with dictator
[1:24:50] because they are operating they're not
[1:24:52] crown
[1:24:53] amen but they're already ruling like
[1:24:55] kings
[1:24:58] glory to God Amen
[1:25:03] back there verse 12 and the ten horns
[1:25:06] which you sow are Ten Kings which
[1:25:08] receive no Kingdom as yet but receive
[1:25:11] power as as king how many hour
[1:25:15] with who
[1:25:17] so these King will first work with the
[1:25:22] Beast
[1:25:24] are you okay amen at the beginning of
[1:25:27] the Reign there will be associated
[1:25:32] there will be associated
[1:25:36] with the Beast
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:41] so when they are killing
[1:25:44] it is not really them killing
[1:25:48] there is a beast behind
[1:25:50] that is using them to kill
[1:25:53] we okay
[1:25:55] job to verse uh 13. these have what
[1:26:00] they don't have two minds
[1:26:02] in other words all of them
[1:26:04] think the same way
[1:26:07] right amen all of them have the same
[1:26:10] concept they have the same mentality
[1:26:14] if you talk to the first king the second
[1:26:16] King the third King they belong to one
[1:26:19] group
[1:26:23] they belong to one group
[1:26:26] they speak one mind
[1:26:31] they have one mind not two mind one amen
[1:26:36] they have one group in other words you
[1:26:38] can identify them by their mind
[1:26:42] do you follow me if you talk to one you
[1:26:45] talk to the other they believe the same
[1:26:47] thing in other words if one is against
[1:26:50] brother Greg if you go talk to the other
[1:26:52] one he's against brother grade you talk
[1:26:54] to the third one he's against whether so
[1:26:56] you can identify them their group by
[1:26:59] what they believe
[1:27:02] everybody okay now amen okay job to
[1:27:05] verse 13.
[1:27:07] they these have one mind and shall give
[1:27:11] their power and strength to who so there
[1:27:15] is a covenant between them and the Beast
[1:27:19] that's why they have an association
[1:27:21] there is a covenant
[1:27:24] where we're going is very deep
[1:27:29] verse 14
[1:27:31] these shall make war with dilemma
[1:27:35] and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:27:39] for he is Lord of lords
[1:27:41] and King of Kings Revelation 19 and they
[1:27:46] that are with him
[1:27:48] who are with the lamb being a battle
[1:27:50] you remember now they that are with him
[1:27:54] are called water
[1:27:59] what does the man do to a wife he picked
[1:28:03] a wife he chose the wife
[1:28:07] that's why those that are follow him
[1:28:09] our father have fine Lenin which is the
[1:28:12] brother remember the marriage of dilemma
[1:28:15] have come and the blood have made
[1:28:16] herself ready she was away in fine
[1:28:19] learning which are which is the
[1:28:21] righteousness of the what because they
[1:28:23] are chosen so they're not making War
[1:28:25] only toward God
[1:28:27] they hate you too
[1:28:30] they don't like you
[1:28:32] they don't like you and they don't like
[1:28:34] your husband
[1:28:36] they don't like your family
[1:28:39] everybody okay so these shall make war
[1:28:42] with the lamb and the lamb shall
[1:28:44] overcome them
[1:28:46] for he is Lord of Lord and king of kings
[1:28:48] and they that are with him are called
[1:28:51] chosen
[1:28:52] and faithful it's a faithful woman
[1:28:56] you there
[1:28:58] verse 15 and he said to me the water
[1:29:02] which you saw remember yesterday

[1:29:15] and they turned on which you saw upon
[1:29:19] the Beast these shall Hit The Horde
[1:29:24] so at the beginning they are friend
[1:29:28] something will happen with the whole
[1:29:30] with the horn that they would turn
[1:29:32] around and begin to hit
[1:29:35] The Horde
[1:29:37] in other words the Covenant will be
[1:29:40] broken
[1:29:42] are we okay so the reason that's how you
[1:29:45] read the prophecy
[1:29:47] so and there will come a time when the
[1:29:50] Covenant is going to be broken
[1:29:54] amen and hatred will begin to come
[1:29:59] amen you will wonder why so and so was
[1:30:03] friend to so and so but now they are
[1:30:07] they hurt each other so much
[1:30:10] they were bodies
[1:30:13] now they don't talk no more and one is
[1:30:16] even at the point that if we get an
[1:30:18] occasion he will kill the other one
[1:30:20] because the Covenant was broken
[1:30:23] everybody okay amen
[1:30:26] glory to God verse 16. and the tenthorn
[1:30:29] which you saw upon the Beast these shall

[1:30:51] 10 horns will break their Covenant head
[1:30:55] the and burn her
[1:31:01] anybody care
[1:31:02] so what the Beast is carrying
[1:31:07] he's carrying his own Autodesk Auto
[1:31:10] destruction
[1:31:14] do you follow me
[1:31:15] God took the Beast and opened the
[1:31:20] software of the Beast do you follow me
[1:31:22] and put something that would destroy the
[1:31:25] Beast and kept it and let the Beast go
[1:31:28] at the beginning that device will help
[1:31:31] the Beast
[1:31:33] until a certain time God where he is
[1:31:37] with his iPad like Brother David God
[1:31:41] will push the button and for some reason
[1:31:44] that device don't work anymore
[1:31:47] amen when the beasts say let's go right
[1:31:50] the device is going left
[1:31:54] amen so the Beast and the device will
[1:31:58] break the Covenant and the device will
[1:32:00] turn around and destroy the Beast
[1:32:09] you say God programmed that
[1:32:12] you say brother deceiver you are saying
[1:32:14] that it's God that program that
[1:32:16] read the scripture verse 17.

[1:32:35] know God
[1:32:41] amen the thing that destroy him is on
[1:32:44] himself

[1:32:54] owner push the button and explode
[1:32:59] everybody okay
[1:33:00] for God he have a suicide mission
[1:33:04] therefore God has put in their heart the
[1:33:08] heart of the king

[1:33:15] and that will is destruction

[1:42:35] not knowing when he was coming but
[1:42:39] remember in Daniel 12 he says the wise
[1:42:43] shall understand in the last day
[1:42:47] so the wise are gonna be in the last day
[1:42:51] what made them wise because of the
[1:42:54] second oil is activated in other words
[1:42:57] throughout the edges that oil was never
[1:43:00] available in other words throughout the
[1:43:02] ages that anointing was never available
[1:43:06] because if that anointing was given to
[1:43:08] power power would have opened the seals
[1:43:11] and if Paul opened the sealed Jesus
[1:43:13] Christ must come but if Jesus Christ
[1:43:15] come in the edge of power you're going
[1:43:18] to be left
[1:43:20] Jesus cannot come without you being on
[1:43:23] the board
[1:43:24] you must have your ticket confirm it and
[1:43:27] go to the airport and get all your
[1:43:29] luggages you get inside then Jesus take
[1:43:32] off
[1:43:35] glory to God
[1:43:37] the spirit of wisdom
[1:43:40] that makes people wise
[1:43:42] comes into the church to make known to
[1:43:46] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[1:43:50] Ghost bringing the church in and

[1:47:22] this I understand this where else can we
[1:47:26] go
[1:47:28] because we found out that you have the
[1:47:31] word of what eternalize
[1:47:33] everybody clear so far
[1:47:36] glory to God as we look at this image of
[1:47:39] Daniel we divided this image into five
[1:47:43] and we are dealing with the last one
[1:47:45] which is Rome and we found out that Rome
[1:47:48] have two stages
[1:47:50] he moved from the Pagan empire into a
[1:47:54] purple Empire amen and in the Beast it
[1:47:58] was interpreted as the Beast that was
[1:48:01] wounded but the wound was not here
[1:48:04] everybody okay now if you notice you are
[1:48:07] here somewhere around here this is where
[1:48:11] your church age is started
[1:48:21] everybody okay
[1:48:23] everybody okay
[1:48:26] Rome started in 68 before Christ
[1:48:32] and once destroyed a 476.
[1:48:37] 80
[1:48:38] s after crust
[1:48:40] anybody okay
[1:48:42] the churches started at 53.
[1:48:46] Amen in other words the true changes
[1:48:49] started when Rome was still pagan
[1:48:55] are we okay
[1:48:57] are we okay
[1:48:58] are we okay
[1:48:59] and the church changes continue to move
[1:49:03] amen
[1:49:05] the first churches went
[1:49:09] the second went
[1:49:11] the third was peregamus amen
[1:49:15] started from 312 into six or six
[1:49:19] amen this is where
[1:49:23] 476 feet
[1:49:25] Amen in other words from the time of
[1:49:28] power
[1:49:29] all the way to the edge of pilgrimus the
[1:49:33] church was operating with Pagan room
[1:49:39] somebody
[1:49:41] pigeon Rome is the one who killed Jesus
[1:49:44] Christ
[1:49:46] Jesus was not killed by the Pope
[1:49:49] Jesus was killed by the Roman
[1:49:52] amen Paul was destroyed in Rome
[1:49:56] Paul was not killed by the Pope
[1:49:59] everybody okay so far do you follow me
[1:50:02] do you follow me so the churches started
[1:50:05] here all the way there then when the
[1:50:08] Empire of Rome was destroyed Rome
[1:50:11] changed from and get into pepperon
[1:50:16] what are you trying to say brother
[1:50:18] Stephen
[1:50:19] this right here is pure iron
[1:50:22] it started as a kingdom he started as a
[1:50:25] kingdom when he got to somewhere toward
[1:50:28] the end of it the church age is kicking
[1:50:30] and the church edges went with the groom
[1:50:33] until Rome was destroyed and when Rome
[1:50:37] flipped the church edges continue
[1:50:39] do you follow me if we can see the
[1:50:42] church edges in connection to the image
[1:50:45] of Daniel too we must also see the
[1:50:48] church ages in connection to the Beast
[1:50:52] because those two goes together Daniel 2
[1:50:57] is the physical Daniel 7 is the spirit
[1:51:00] behind the kingdom
[1:51:03] everybody okay glory to God
[1:51:07] now we got the Beast and the two changes
[1:51:11] amen when we speak about the church ages
[1:51:15] we are talking about a dispensation that
[1:51:18] God is trying to take a breath
[1:51:21] out of the Gentile amen because Jesus
[1:51:25] came to the Jews and the Jews rejected
[1:51:28] Jesus Christ
[1:51:29] and Jesus Christ turned around to take a
[1:51:32] breath from the Gentile and at the cross
[1:51:35] we found what happened to Jesus that
[1:51:37] Jesus was pierced like Adam and out of
[1:51:40] Jesus Christ came water came blood and
[1:51:42] the spirit which was showing that the
[1:51:44] bread was coming out of Jesus Christ
[1:51:46] everybody okay and Paul as a messenger
[1:51:50] of the age pick up the Revelation and
[1:51:52] say wait a minute the bread is born
[1:51:55] everybody here but if the bread is born
[1:51:58] I'm afraid how was the bloodborne Paul
[1:52:02] look he said oh my God that preached
[1:52:05] Jesus At The Cross but this is what
[1:52:07] happened to Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:52:09] so somewhere there must be a serpent
[1:52:16] I am jealous over you with Godly
[1:52:18] jealousy for I have expressed you to one
[1:52:21] husband that I may present you as a
[1:52:23] chest virgin too
[1:52:25] but I feel less by any mean as the
[1:52:29] serpent began if through his water
[1:52:32] and we found out that the serpent was a
[1:52:35] beast
[1:52:38] amen he was not a snake
[1:52:42] but that Beast was destroyed
[1:52:45] and made into a reptile
[1:52:48] amen so he's no longer a beast he's a
[1:52:52] reptile amen but Paul is afraid of the
[1:52:56] serpent
[1:52:57] amen but we found out now that when John
[1:53:01] unfolded the serpent
[1:53:03] John says that that oh serpent
[1:53:07] amen
[1:53:08] really he's the Dragon
[1:53:14] you remember Revelation 12 verse 9 what
[1:53:19] are you trying to say brother Stephen
[1:53:21] as we start from heaven
[1:53:24] in Revelation 12 we found out that in
[1:53:27] heaven something appeared there was a
[1:53:30] great red dragon having seven heads and
[1:53:32] water
[1:53:33] so this dragon in heaven had seven heads
[1:53:39] and he had ten horns everybody okay
[1:53:43] and the Bible says the seventh crime was
[1:53:46] put upon his head
[1:53:48] and he still the tale of this Dragon
[1:53:51] drew the third part of the star
[1:53:55] of heaven and did cast down amen
[1:53:59] catch them down into the Earth
[1:54:02] this Dragon follow me carefully
[1:54:05] not only did he have seven heads and ten
[1:54:09] horn but this Dragon took the stars of
[1:54:13] God and dumped them into the Dust
[1:54:18] keep that in mind I'm not gonna touch
[1:54:21] the woman that will come down the road
[1:54:23] amen and the dragon stood before the
[1:54:26] woman we would see that woman later on
[1:54:28] which is ready to be delivered for to
[1:54:31] devour her child as soon as he was born
[1:54:33] we will see that down the road and the
[1:54:36] Great Dragon was Caster the water
[1:54:46] everybody okay so the Beast now in the
[1:54:51] end time is a dragon
[1:54:56] but the dragon is in heaven
[1:54:59] what is in the on the Earth
[1:55:02] brother Stephen he says in Revelation 13
[1:55:05] John Abyss rise up out of the sea we
[1:55:08] talked about it yesterday having how
[1:55:10] many horns
[1:55:12] seven horns and water and ten horns
[1:55:15] everybody okay so In Heaven There was a
[1:55:19] beast with seven heads and ten horn on
[1:55:22] the earth there must be something that's
[1:55:25] gonna match that Beast
[1:55:30] in heaven we have God
[1:55:34] and Lucifer
[1:55:36] you remember
[1:55:37] president and vice president on the
[1:55:40] earth you have Adam
[1:55:42] and you have the serpent amen God went
[1:55:47] to Adam and Lucifer went to who because
[1:55:51] this is a president to president vice
[1:55:54] president to vice president they marched
[1:55:56] together
[1:55:58] are we okay now so in heaven the dragon
[1:56:01] have seven hands and ten horns so
[1:56:04] something must be on the earth that's
[1:56:06] gonna match that dragon
[1:56:08] and we find that a beast is on the earth
[1:56:11] and that Beast also have seven heads
[1:56:16] so when the dragon comes he looks he
[1:56:20] found something that looked like him
[1:56:25] everybody okay
[1:56:26] and the dragon the Beast and the Beast
[1:56:30] that came out which you saw was like
[1:56:32] unto a water
[1:56:34] let me stop here
[1:56:36] when the kingdom of the Gentiles started
[1:56:38] in Daniel 7 he started with a lion
[1:56:43] right then he moved all the way down
[1:56:45] into a bear after the bear like David
[1:56:49] showed to us he moved into a leper
[1:56:52] everybody okay and from a leopard he
[1:56:55] went to a mixing of all three
[1:56:57] amen a mixing of all three which is
[1:57:01] wrong everybody okay if you look from
[1:57:04] here the succession is going down
[1:57:09] do you follow me
[1:57:10] it is going from Babylon
[1:57:13] two middle passion two Greek to roam but
[1:57:17] if you look in Revelation 13 scripture
[1:57:21] don't pray with words
[1:57:23] you okay
[1:57:25] the Bible started with leopard
[1:57:28] everybody okay and the feet of the water
[1:57:31] damn
[1:57:32] so now it looks like we're going back
[1:57:37] you follow me
[1:57:40] and after the bear was fellow
[1:57:42] the lion so we were running away from
[1:57:45] Babylon
[1:57:49] you following me the lion was Babylon
[1:57:53] everybody okay Babylon was destroying we
[1:57:57] run away from Babylon but through this
[1:58:01] Beast
[1:58:02] we are rebuilding back again through
[1:58:04] Babylon we are going back again toward
[1:58:09] Babylon back again that's why in
[1:58:11] Revelation 17 that woman is called
[1:58:14] mystery Babylon the great because
[1:58:17] Babylon is rebuilt back again
[1:58:23] are we okay
[1:58:27] and what happened to this Beast that is
[1:58:29] rebuilding Babylon the Bible says that
[1:58:32] the dragon gave him his water
[1:58:35] and his water and his water
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:38] the another word the dragon take
[1:58:40] everything that he has and poor in this
[1:58:44] Beast this Beast received the
[1:58:47] Incarnation of the Demonic anointing
[1:58:49] straight into him
[1:58:51] everybody okay
[1:58:53] everybody okay and the Bible says that
[1:58:55] the dragon gave him his seat yes
[1:59:01] if I want to explain that to you
[1:59:04] in a simple way the dragon have a throne
[1:59:07] let's make it simple and the Dragon Rise
[1:59:10] From the throne and say you best come
[1:59:13] and sit down here in other words the
[1:59:15] reign of the devil
[1:59:18] that was in heaven he's winning and
[1:59:20] ruling every Kingdom by that Beast
[1:59:26] everybody okay now in pergamas the Bible

[1:59:33] that dwells even well what
[1:59:36] now according to the Beast the Beast
[1:59:39] receive a seat where is that seat we
[1:59:42] don't know
[1:59:43] but when we look at the church edges and
[1:59:45] blending the church edges and the beasts
[1:59:48] remember that I'm blending the church
[1:59:50] edges and the Beast when we go through
[1:59:52] the church ages we found out that
[1:59:54] certain seed is in pergamers you
[1:59:57] remember that last Sunday so now when we

[2:00:07] seat of Satan amen and the dragon gave
[2:00:11] this Beast here his seat in other words
[2:00:15] the Incarnation of the Demonic power of
[2:00:18] Satan upon this Beast here happen in the
[2:00:23] age of pergamas

[2:00:32] that I saw one of his head as he were
[2:00:35] wounded to death and his deadly wound
[2:00:38] was water and all the world will begin
[2:00:41] to water

[2:06:19] understand remember wisdom and
[2:06:21] understanding in the Book of Proverbs
[2:06:23] they together now let him that has
[2:06:27] understanding count the number of the
[2:06:29] water
[2:06:30] for it is the number of water
[2:06:34] so the Beast is a man now
[2:06:37] we okay
[2:06:38] and his number is water
[2:06:45] 666. how many six do we have which is a
[2:06:49] trinity of six
[2:06:52] because his power always worked in
[2:06:54] Trinity
[2:06:56] everybody okay brother Branham say but
[2:06:59] when this awful deceiving Spirit oh man
[2:07:03] incarnated incarnate spirit this
[2:07:07] Doctrine Spirit became incarnated to
[2:07:09] take the place of Christ into Earth
[2:07:12] it must be worshiped
[2:07:14] turn to be a worship like Christ in
[2:07:16] other word over a dead Vatican I have
[2:07:19] been right there it is wrote vicarious
[2:07:22] Philly day
[2:07:25] V
[2:07:27] everybody okay
[2:07:29] in the Roman numeral is that the file
[2:07:32] it's number five
[2:07:33] you know that how many feet do we have

[2:07:51] continue counting five how many do we
[2:07:54] have
[2:07:55] how many
[2:07:57] one times six is what
[2:07:59] now see in the Roman numeral it's 100.
[2:08:07] everybody okay l in the Roman numeral is
[2:08:11] 50.
[2:08:13] and D in the Roman numeral is what
[2:08:18] now let's do the math
[2:08:20] 500
[2:08:22] Plus 50 is what
[2:08:25] 550 plus 100
[2:08:28] 650 plus six
[2:08:31] plus ten
[2:08:38] it's a man
[2:08:40] this is what is written on the Pope
[2:08:45] continue and it's wrought in Roman
[2:08:48] numeral you just joined line at the
[2:08:51] bottom of those Roman numerals it means
[2:08:54] instead of the son of God in other words
[2:08:57] he is the vicar you know what is a
[2:09:00] whatever is just take the place of
[2:09:04] something he is the Vaca he is in the
[2:09:06] state of the Son of God a demon calling
[2:09:09] himself
[2:09:10] Jesus Christ
[2:09:14] everybody okay so far now when this
[2:09:18] connected into a man why did the
[2:09:21] Incarnation happen remember the
[2:09:23] Incarnation cannot happen as long as the
[2:09:26] wings of an eagle are there
[2:09:29] everybody okay
[2:09:31] glory to God Paul says that I know that
[2:09:35] I that after my departing
[2:09:38] not when I'm
[2:09:40] because Paul was a prophet
[2:09:42] everybody okay after I am proud of
[2:09:46] I am killed by Rome everybody okay shall
[2:09:50] grieve his wolf enter in among you not
[2:09:54] sparing the water the flock and Paul
[2:09:57] said that the mystery of iniquity do
[2:09:59] already work he already saw it but he
[2:10:02] knows that he cannot do anything I'm
[2:10:04] long as I'm there
[2:10:05] amen only he who now let us will let
[2:10:09] until he became uh he he be taken out of
[2:10:13] the way and then shall that we can be
[2:10:15] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[2:10:18] with the spirit of his mouth you know
[2:10:20] what he means and shall destroy with the
[2:10:22] brightness of his water so this
[2:10:25] Incarnation could never happen until
[2:10:28] Paul is taken off
[2:10:31] where are you going my friend
[2:10:34] I'm saying what there help was there a
[2:10:38] prophecy concerning that you remember
[2:10:40] Paul prophecy last night and not that
[2:10:43] after my departure Grievous wolf shall
[2:10:45] enter in among you and man of your own
[2:10:48] class rather in your own church damn
[2:10:50] water
[2:10:51] Catholic Church saw that will raise up
[2:10:56] among you and pull away the disciple
[2:10:58] after them and Paul's wolf
[2:11:00] we found out became the worker the
[2:11:03] nicolete and that started up there
[2:11:05] everybody okay glory to God where are
[2:11:08] you taking me amen now when that Spirit
[2:11:12] enter man what happened to the church
[2:11:15] brother Branham said natural he fell in
[2:11:18] Eden by listening to certain reasoning
[2:11:21] against God's word that is how she fell
[2:11:23] all right sir she fell because she did
[2:11:25] that spiritual Eve which is the church
[2:11:28] now now that is the church Chris Brown
[2:11:31] She also fell
[2:11:35] how did she fell the game that they were
[2:11:38] playing opened the door for Satan to
[2:11:41] enter a human being
[2:11:43] hey everybody okay nothing either now
[2:11:46] but in Rome at the nursing Council when
[2:11:49] she rejected that Pentecostal church
[2:11:51] that went down to Nazi and listening to
[2:11:55] Roman reasoning instead of holding on to
[2:11:57] the word of God she fell and everything
[2:12:00] away from her died with her around water
[2:12:03] so the church the brother started like
[2:12:07] he fell how did she fail because the
[2:12:11] beasts have entered into somebody just
[2:12:13] like he did in the Garden of Eden
[2:12:15] anybody okay what happened now in the
[2:12:18] Church of tatarian a woman rose up who
[2:12:21] is Jezebel
[2:12:23] amen because the Beast now have sexual
[2:12:28] Affair spiritually with the church and
[2:12:32] the church became an immoral woman which
[2:12:35] is called Jezebel that is teaching
[2:12:37] people just like evils teaching Adam how
[2:12:41] to commit adultery or fornication
[2:12:44] everybody okay so far
[2:12:46] where are we going with this my friend
[2:12:48] glory to God the Bible says in
[2:12:51] Revelation 17 verse 3 that so he carried
[2:12:55] me away in the spirit Into the
[2:12:57] Wilderness and saw a woman sitting upon
[2:13:00] a scarlet color Beast full of the name
[2:13:02] of blasphemy having seven horns and
[2:13:04] water and horns so we found out now that
[2:13:09] this dragon is in the Beast this Beast
[2:13:12] is now having a wife and the Beast and
[2:13:15] the wives are blending together
[2:13:17] amen just like the Beast and Eve Blended
[2:13:21] together
[2:13:22] we okay
[2:13:24] something happened when they Blended
[2:13:26] together can I erase some of them
[2:13:31] let me go here
[2:13:33] everybody okay
[2:13:35] yeah
[2:13:36] glory to God now we got the best and the
[2:13:40] woman what happened next follow me
[2:13:42] carefully the Bible says that when John
[2:13:46] saw the woman
[2:13:48] she was drunken with the blood of the
[2:13:51] saint
[2:13:53] amen she didn't drink the blood
[2:13:58] she drunk so much
[2:14:00] until she became drunk
[2:14:04] because for you to become drunk you must
[2:14:06] drink beyond your limit
[2:14:08] amen amen
[2:14:10] everybody okay you cannot take one one
[2:14:14] glass and you get drunk no you have to
[2:14:16] drink drink drink until it's beyond your
[2:14:18] limit so this woman killed
[2:14:21] killed killed until she kills so much
[2:14:25] and she become drunk
[2:14:27] drunk of what of the blood of your
[2:14:31] brothers and sisters
[2:14:34] she was drunken with the blood of the
[2:14:37] scent and with the blood of the Martyr
[2:14:40] of who Jesus
[2:14:41] so this will happen after the coming of
[2:14:45] Jesus Christ
[2:14:49] because the more they believe in Jesus
[2:14:51] Christ so it's not in the Old Testament
[2:14:53] it is in the New Testament everybody
[2:14:55] okay it is the Church of God the Bible
[2:14:58] continue he say but John said I saw her
[2:15:01] and I wonder with great water how can
[2:15:05] something so beautiful
[2:15:08] but it's so bloody
[2:15:11] what is happening with this woman
[2:15:13] I'm going slowly Revelation 18 verse 24
[2:15:17] the Bible said in her in that woman was
[2:15:21] found the blood of the water prophet and
[2:15:23] Waters and of all that was slain upon
[2:15:27] the Earth
[2:15:29] it's a killer
[2:15:31] she looks beautiful on the outside but
[2:15:34] she will kill you
[2:15:35] Revelation 19 2 for true and righteous
[2:15:39] are his judgment the Judgment of God for
[2:15:41] he has judged the water
[2:15:44] that woman right there which did corrupt
[2:15:48] the Earth with her fornication she's
[2:15:50] teaching people and his Avenge the blood
[2:15:54] of his servant at water so God is
[2:15:57] seeking for a Revenge
[2:16:02] amen the reason why God want to destroy
[2:16:07] and burn this Beast here because the
[2:16:10] Beast has killed so many of God children
[2:16:15] everybody okay and the Beast is drunken
[2:16:19] with the blood of descent everybody okay
[2:16:22] where are you going in proverb 9 verse
[2:16:26] 17 if you remember that woman said
[2:16:28] stolen water sweet Brad dating in secret
[2:16:32] is water but he knoweth not that they're
[2:16:35] dead that day and that her guests are
[2:16:38] water
[2:16:39] she's a piece of Hell herself killing
[2:16:42] people
[2:16:43] everybody good so far where are you
[2:16:46] going my brother now we found out that
[2:16:48] this woman is now responsible for the
[2:16:52] killing of the saint of God
[2:16:54] amen the combination of this woman and
[2:16:58] the Beast is bloody
[2:17:04] everybody okay when you take the Beast
[2:17:07] and you match him with this human with
[2:17:11] this woman this woman has become a
[2:17:13] killer
[2:17:15] in the same language
[2:17:19] what is happening is when the Beast
[2:17:23] matches with a church he opened the
[2:17:27] second seal
[2:17:34] I'm letting that sink in
[2:17:36] the festival is completed
[2:17:38] everybody okay we're blending John
[2:17:41] Daniel the seals the seven churches
[2:17:43] together
[2:17:45] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:17:48] why is he blending the seventh seal the
[2:17:51] the second film listen to this the Bible
[2:17:54] says this that when this Beast Rose and
[2:17:58] was healed he was given unto him to make
[2:18:02] war with the what you see now
[2:18:05] everybody here and to the water
[2:18:08] that's why the disciple couldn't do
[2:18:10] nothing to Rome
[2:18:12] they have to be taken to the stack and
[2:18:14] they burn them they put them in the lion
[2:18:16] they kill them because the power was
[2:18:18] given to this Beast to destroy descent
[2:18:22] and power was given him of the all
[2:18:25] Kindred and tongue and water so anybody
[2:18:29] that this beasts want to kill he will
[2:18:31] kill
[2:18:33] him and all that dwell upon the Earth
[2:18:35] shall worship Him whose name are not
[2:18:37] written in the books of lamb of uh in
[2:18:40] the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[2:18:42] before the foundation of the world if
[2:18:44] any man has a near let him water he that
[2:18:48] leadeth into captivity shall go into
[2:18:51] captivity he that killeth with water
[2:18:54] must be water why is God saying somebody
[2:18:58] is killing with the sword here
[2:19:03] because in the second seal when it was
[2:19:07] open the Bible says when they opened the
[2:19:10] seconds here I heard the second beast
[2:19:12] say come and see and then went out
[2:19:15] another horse that was what the color of
[2:19:18] the Dragon was what red
[2:19:22] are we blending together
[2:19:24] are we blaming together I'm going slowly
[2:19:27] until you will see your enemy
[2:19:30] if you're sleeping that's your problem
[2:19:32] everybody okay and then and then power
[2:19:36] was given to him that sat there on to
[2:19:39] take peace from the Earth
[2:19:40] and that he should kill one another and
[2:19:43] they was giving him a water
[2:19:45] that's why the woman is a killer
[2:19:50] everybody okay
[2:19:51] brother Branham says this glory to God
[2:19:54] he says I am coding from the materology
[2:19:58] from the time of Saint Augustine of
[2:20:01] Hippo until 1586 on the Roman
[2:20:05] meteorology the Roman Catholic Church
[2:20:08] put how many
[2:20:10] 681 million
[2:20:13] your brothers and sisters were killed
[2:20:18] how many
[2:20:20] was she drunk

[2:20:27] riding your head I I mean a red horse
[2:20:30] what was it the same power the same
[2:20:34] rather there is your seal they admit 68
[2:20:39] million this is what the Catholic Church
[2:20:40] admitted but it was more than that
[2:20:42] brother Branham say on the martyrology
[2:20:45] beside all those put to death outside of
[2:20:48] that oh mercy during the Dark Ages there
[2:20:52] were a million fat to lion and
[2:20:55] slaughtering every way because they
[2:20:57] would not bow down to water
[2:20:59] foreign
[2:21:03] you see the Catholic Church killing you
[2:21:06] don't understand because those Mysteries
[2:21:08] were still until the end time
[2:21:11] why do we need to know this everybody
[2:21:13] okay now we have seen that that Beast
[2:21:17] goes to peregamus pick up a woman in
[2:21:20] tatarian and when he joined with the
[2:21:23] woman he kills this hand and he's and
[2:21:25] and and he's completely drunk with the
[2:21:28] blood of the sin amen he kills so much
[2:21:32] ah until the age of tartarian was almost
[2:21:36] gone

[2:23:32] America America was established a plum
[2:23:35] of Rock with the Mayflower for one
[2:23:38] purpose for water because the Beast is
[2:23:41] killing them in Europe they run away
[2:23:43] completely to a new continent where
[2:23:46] there is nobody so that they can worship
[2:23:49] God in their freedom foreign

[2:26:34] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:26:37] everybody okay the one that is killing
[2:26:40] is not the Beast really
[2:26:43] it is the woman that is destroying
[2:26:47] do you follow me remember brother
[2:26:49] Branham said the greatest bait the devil
[2:26:51] have is a woman any moral woman do you
[2:26:55] remember do you remember so when Rome
[2:26:58] saw that
[2:27:01] Roman look and say I'm gonna send this
[2:27:04] woman
[2:27:06] to chase those people up there
[2:27:10] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:27:13] the Bible says this because later on the
[2:27:17] beasts begin to speak like a water
[2:27:20] so somehow the Dragon Enter America
[2:27:24] everybody okay but we know that the
[2:27:27] dragon was in the Beast of Rome
[2:27:30] amen and the Beast of Rome was working
[2:27:32] with a woman but we found that the
[2:27:35] Buffalo now when he talked he's talking
[2:27:38] like a dragon
[2:27:40] when the serpent talk he talked like
[2:27:43] Lucifer who was in The Serpent
[2:27:46] when the Beast the Buffalo began to talk
[2:27:49] he talked like a dragon in other words
[2:27:52] something happened when the American
[2:27:55] people were getting happy dancing
[2:27:58] the Dragon Enter in America
[2:28:01] and then sat alone to be there
[2:28:04] everybody okay
[2:28:05] the Bible says this
[2:28:08] let me go and he the Beast exercise
[2:28:12] water
[2:28:14] all the power of water remember the
[2:28:17] first Beast the devil gave him his
[2:28:19] authority his power and his secret
[2:28:23] if his exercise in the power of the
[2:28:26] first Beast the power of the first
[2:28:28] priest came from Lucifer so America at a
[2:28:31] certain age will act for Lucifer
[2:28:37] I'll let you soak that in
[2:28:39] with your Patriot
[2:28:43] I'll let you suck that in
[2:28:47] I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I let
[2:28:49] you soak that in
[2:28:51] you will be that's why you heard brother
[2:28:54] Branham say everybody working in the
[2:28:56] government that is not born again you
[2:28:57] remember the court is working for who
[2:29:00] why is brother Brian I'm saying that
[2:29:05] why because the power that is working
[2:29:08] there is a power that is coming from
[2:29:10] Satan
[2:29:11] I'm going slowly and you're going to
[2:29:13] understand the world
[2:29:16] can I continue
[2:29:18] glory to God and the Bible says that he
[2:29:22] should make an image to the Beast which
[2:29:25] had a wound by sword and did live so
[2:29:29] this Beast not only is he speaking like
[2:29:32] a dragon but he makes something
[2:29:35] an image is something that look like
[2:29:38] something
[2:29:39] he looked at Rome Rome that he fled away
[2:29:42] now he take Rome and reproduce Rome
[2:29:45] again
[2:29:48] everybody okay and had power to give
[2:29:51] life up to the image of the Beast that
[2:29:54] the image of the beach should buff
[2:29:55] Waters and cause as many as would not
[2:29:59] worship the same thing they had in
[2:30:01] Europe the image of the Beast should be
[2:30:03] water so America now is also a killer
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:12] don't say Amen
[2:30:15] it's okay
[2:30:18] everybody okay everybody okay I am
[2:30:21] speaking the Bible
[2:30:24] what is going on
[2:30:26] so some reason the dragon came in this
[2:30:30] beast and this Beast combined with a
[2:30:32] woman but we found out that later on the
[2:30:36] Buffalo also spoke like a dragon so for
[2:30:39] some reason there is a connection
[2:30:41] between this woman and the buffalo
[2:30:44] amen
[2:30:46] thank God for Malachi 4.
[2:30:49] [Applause]
[2:30:53] thank God for this message
[2:30:56] because when this begin to happen God
[2:31:00] said brother Branham
[2:31:04] but here when brother Branham came
[2:31:07] brother Branham took his binoculars
[2:31:11] and he put it like this

[2:32:10] president I believe he shall make a
[2:32:12] water it is not him
[2:32:18] what are you trying to say
[2:32:21] naturally in a Protestant pen in a
[2:32:24] Protestant Nation for the first time in
[2:32:28] America a Catholic President is elected
[2:32:34] naturally all you can see our president
[2:32:37] is Catholic when they say brother
[2:32:40] Branham the president is Catholic
[2:32:42] brother Branham went
[2:32:46] took the binocular he said the president

[3:02:10] thanking you for your love
[3:02:12] thanking you for your mercy
[3:02:15] father we could be just as bright as
[3:02:18] anybody
[3:02:21] looking at the things that are happening
[3:02:23] in this world
[3:02:24] and saying that oh he always happened
[3:02:27] like this
[3:02:29] it will get better
[3:02:31] and that's what they will try to do to
[3:02:34] make things better
[3:02:36] but the scriptures say when everybody
[3:02:38] will say peace then sudden destruction
[3:02:41] will come

[3:03:09] that is telling us that we must be ready
[3:03:13] because at any time when you step in you
[3:03:16] will be able to meet you into the air

[3:03:36] and neglecting
[3:03:38] the very good part that cannot be taken
[3:03:41] away from us
[3:03:43] Lord may you break that intellectual
[3:03:46] spirit
[3:03:48] that Spirit of stubbornness
[3:03:51] that Spirit of reasoning that Spirit of
[3:03:55] proud
[3:03:57] that is fighting against the ministry
[3:04:00] and do not want to Humble themselves not
[3:04:05] to Humble before me but to Humble before
[3:04:07] the word before the message that is
[3:04:10] preached so that people can take their
[3:04:12] life in seriously and check the life and
[3:04:16] correct what needs to be corrected and
[3:04:19] leave circumspectingly knowing that any
[3:04:23] time

[3:04:53] may you be merciful to them that somehow
[3:04:56] you can shake them to wake them upload
[3:04:59] because we don't want anybody perish we
[3:05:02] don't want anybody left to be honest we
[3:05:05] don't want to leave any hoof we all want
