[1:00:25] served him and made him overseer over
[1:00:28] his house and all that he had he put
[1:00:32] into his hand so there was some
[1:00:35] restriction at the beginning there were
[1:00:37] certain rooms that Joseph could not
[1:00:39] access but as as P for
[1:00:43] notice the ministry of this
[1:00:46] man notice
[1:00:49] Christ in the life of Joseph he begin to
[1:00:52] open certain doors that he didn't want
[1:00:54] to open at the beginning

[1:06:25] the son of man that Ministry of the son
[1:06:29] of man is not come to destroy his man
[1:06:33] life but he comes to save them and they
[1:06:36] went to another Village the ministry of
[1:06:40] William Maran Bram came to save
[1:06:44] life not to destroy
[1:06:48] people amen amen in other words you're
[1:06:51] not ready yet to handle such a power but
[1:06:55] they were calling on the power from the
[1:06:58] ministry of Elijah the prophet and our
[1:07:01] Elijah is William Marion
[1:07:05] Brandon what do you want to do with the
[1:07:07] third pole let's go to First Timothy
[1:07:11] chapter 3 we already pray so we can
[1:07:16] sore 1 Timothy chapter 3 if you dare you
[1:07:20] can say amen
[1:07:24] amen verse one
[1:07:26] one need to keep your
[1:07:31] Bible it sounds very strange but I'm
[1:07:34] trying to pull something from here verse
[1:07:37] one the Bible says this is a true
[1:07:44] saying if a man
[1:07:47] desire in other word is
[1:07:50] Aspire you are longing
[1:07:52] for you feel a pull
[1:07:56] in your life if I don't want to get into
[1:08:00] something here because it can strick
[1:08:01] pretty hard let me just leave it
[1:08:04] alone because you don't force somebody
[1:08:06] in an office of a
[1:08:08] pastor there must be a pool in that
[1:08:13] person an office must be desire there
[1:08:16] must be a pool you don't just take
[1:08:19] somebody like a Bergen and say you go
[1:08:21] ahead and be a pastor if he doesn't have
[1:08:23] a pool
[1:08:26] he said this is a true saying if a man
[1:08:29] desire or
[1:08:32] Aspire amen the office of a bishop
[1:08:36] Bishop is an elder there's two ways
[1:08:39] different the the the the office is the
[1:08:42] bishop and the one who enter there is
[1:08:43] the elder amen he said the office of a
[1:08:47] bishop he desire a good things so the
[1:08:52] problem is not a the office no sir the
[1:08:57] office is one thing the office is one
[1:09:00] thing the office of a
[1:09:03] bishop is one thing yes sir amen number
[1:09:07] two the pull or the
[1:09:10] desire or the aspiration that you have
[1:09:14] amen amen is another thing and Paul is
[1:09:17] saying if you desire this office it's
[1:09:21] good you didn't sin there is nothing
[1:09:24] wrong with it that's it's a good thing
[1:09:27] to Aspire very good good
[1:09:30] thing but where is the
[1:09:33] problem to
[1:09:35] Aspire to desire is one thing are we
[1:09:40] together but to
[1:09:44] qualify for that office that's the
[1:09:47] problem anybody can desire it but do you
[1:09:50] qualify for it that's one more thing the
[1:09:54] problem is the
[1:09:59] qualification what are the qualification
[1:10:02] of a Bishop Paul say you desire good I

[1:25:09] galatian 4 verse 1 and
[1:25:12] two the Bible says Paul says that now I
[1:25:15] say that the heir as long as he's a
[1:25:18] child thater nothing from a slave though
[1:25:22] he be Lord of all
[1:25:25] I'm insisting in this scripture because
[1:25:27] this scripture give us the full review
[1:25:30] the full the plain picture of what the
[1:25:32] process is and how God operate in our
[1:25:35] life according to the scripture the
[1:25:38] first thing we see is that we are here
[1:25:42] we are air meaning somebody has an
[1:25:46] inheritance amen you have a throne that
[1:25:49] you have to inherit yes sir amen when
[1:25:52] you born you born the king of the Jews
[1:25:54] right there by birth you already have a
[1:25:57] a position and even before the
[1:25:59] foundation of the world you already have
[1:26:01] a position and according to Paul Paul
[1:26:04] said that this air is Lord of all he's
[1:26:08] the Lord of everything everything
[1:26:10] already Belong To You amen amen amen but
[1:26:14] you are still a baby amen amen Paul say
[1:26:18] a there as long as he's a child he def
[1:26:22] nothing from a servant the second thing
[1:26:25] here Paul is showing us is a n is a
[1:26:29] child in other word he's
[1:26:33] immature we clear number three Paul says
[1:26:38] that you got to go under the hand of a
[1:26:41] tutor or a
[1:26:45] governor or a
[1:26:48] mentor or a
[1:26:50] teacher and that is according to an
[1:26:53] appoint appointed
[1:26:55] time there is an appointed time from the
[1:26:59] father amen and that is for your
[1:27:02] training
[1:27:03] am we clear and if you look here on the
[1:27:08] word chart brother Robert if I can get
[1:27:10] another one please the Bible says that
[1:27:13] the heir as long as he is a child I

[1:28:42] amen amen am somebody who had some
[1:28:45] knowledge amen somebody who had some
[1:28:48] experience amen and Paul is saying here
[1:28:50] if you a child even though you are heir
[1:28:53] of of everything even though we know you
[1:28:56] have a position still you are qualified
[1:29:00] or you are taken as a slave that's right
[1:29:04] are we together let's go to First
[1:29:06] Corinthians chapter 3 as we
[1:29:10] building soon it's going to stck home 1
[1:29:14] Corinthians chapter 3 if you there you

[1:29:39] caral even as to who babes in Christ
[1:29:42] Paul say I cannot speak to you like
[1:29:44] spiritual people because you're still
[1:29:48] carnal and because you Conor I'm going
[1:29:50] to talk to you like babes are we
[1:29:53] together amen Paul continue he say I I

[1:30:31] for you because you are not at the age
[1:30:34] to handle certain things am that's right
[1:30:37] that's why we we we we address you like
[1:30:40] a
[1:30:41] servant that's why mama is on top of you
[1:30:45] that's right that's why Mama have to
[1:30:46] chase you because you are immature yet
[1:30:50] even though you think you know a lot it
[1:30:54] but you don't know yet because your age
[1:30:56] is determining how your brain is
[1:30:59] functioning there is brother are we

[1:31:47] to continue explaining here and when you
[1:31:49] finish he will be looking at you smiling
[1:31:51] and go to sleep
[1:31:53] because her brand her level of maturity
[1:31:57] cannot handle credit card stuff that's
[1:32:00] right that's right everybody okay am
[1:32:03] everybody okay I seen young children
[1:32:05] turn around and say Daddy Cann I drive a
[1:32:08] car and daddy say no you cannot drive a
[1:32:10] car because you're 10 years old because

[1:32:15] a car amen if we ever give you a car
[1:32:18] before you know it the police the
[1:32:20] ambulance 911 is right there because
[1:32:22] somebody hit the tree that's right are

[1:32:28] if you put a seat
[1:32:31] belt did you put your seat belt yes we
[1:32:33] turn around go ahead and put the seat
[1:32:36] belt because the level of maturity is
[1:32:39] still low are we together amen Paul says
[1:32:42] for when for the time you ought to be
[1:32:45] how teachers you have need that one
[1:32:47] teach you again which which be the what
[1:32:50] first principles of the Oracles of God
[1:32:53] and now be come such as have need of
[1:32:55] what milk and not what of strong meat
[1:32:58] because of your level I cannot move
[1:32:59] deeper into the word because if I move
[1:33:02] deeper in the word you are lost
[1:33:04] completely and this block Minister
[1:33:07] sometime because the church have been
[1:33:09] fed so much on milk amen amen 20 years
[1:33:14] they keep giving the church milk milk
[1:33:16] milk milk milk milk milk all the time
[1:33:19] and the day another preacher come and
[1:33:21] he's trying to take off the church is
[1:33:23] completely lost
[1:33:25] because the church never dive into the
[1:33:28] deep are we together are we together am
[1:33:32] are we together we want Pentecostal
[1:33:36] sermons but not the message sermon if
[1:33:39] you start talking about the four
[1:33:41] anointing and the 24 they say where is
[1:33:43] he coming from with all this kind of
[1:33:45] stuff because the pastor himself is on
[1:33:50] milk are we together the pastor himself
[1:33:53] is sucking milk for years and what is he
[1:33:56] going to give you nothing but milk and
[1:33:59] the church cannot grow how can you take
[1:34:01] a 17 years old and give him milk from
[1:34:04] the morning all the way to the evening
[1:34:06] he needs some hamburger am he need to
[1:34:09] chew on something bigger amen he need a
[1:34:12] whole pizza
[1:34:16] amen are we together amen glory to God
[1:34:20] jump to verse 13 for everyone that uses
[1:34:24] milk is how unskillful unskillful in the
[1:34:28] word of righteousness for he is how obey
[1:34:31] but what strong meat belongs to them
[1:34:33] that are what of full age even to those
[1:34:36] by
[1:34:37] reason are we together of you have their
[1:34:41] sense how exercise to what discern both
[1:34:45] good and evil so if you are immature
[1:34:47] there is certain there are certain
[1:34:49] things God won't give you amen amen not
[1:34:53] that God doesn't want to give it to you
[1:34:56] but you are not ready yet you are not at
[1:34:59] the position at the level that you
[1:35:01] should be to handle whatever you want
[1:35:03] amen God can give you whatever you want
[1:35:07] but God is so gracious to us that he
[1:35:10] look and he say at this stage this one
[1:35:13] if I give him this one he's going to get
[1:35:15] lost amen you need to grow into some
[1:35:17] maturity and Paul is saying here that as
[1:35:21] long as he is a child so your age is
[1:35:25] what is blocking you
[1:35:28] amen are we together amen your lack of
[1:35:31] experience your lack of knowledge your
[1:35:36] immaturity will slow down your adoption
[1:35:40] amen

[1:35:50] says when I was a what a child did what
[1:35:54] I spake as a child and I did what
[1:35:56] understood as a child and I did what

[1:36:26] speech will betray you your
[1:36:29] understanding will betray you the way
[1:36:31] you thinking the way you process thing
[1:36:33] will affect you and because of that b
[1:36:37] God who is rich in Mercy put you under a
[1:36:40] tutor amen he put you under somebody
[1:36:44] who's going to Mentor you amen who's

[2:16:43] John and James last week and we found
[2:16:48] out that James was hope was love and the
[2:16:52] other one was Peter which were the three
[2:16:55] pillars Peter means faith and you
[2:16:57] remember the two BO that we talk about
[2:17:00] and these boys John and James grew under
[2:17:04] their father zebede Yes and Peter grew
[2:17:09] under his father I believe Jonah amen
[2:17:13] and their father trained them had to
[2:17:16] fish because the father has a business
[2:17:19] of a fisherman yes but this boy doing
[2:17:23] this business they thought that they
[2:17:27] just fall into a family that do fish's
[2:17:31] business they didn't know that God
[2:17:35] ordained that
[2:17:37] family are you following me now to
[2:17:41] prepare them for the oncoming
[2:17:44] task you remember you remember where we
[2:17:47] stopped last Sunday so when God it was
[2:17:50] time for God to come and to pick up
[2:17:53] these
[2:17:53] boys God picked up these boys saying
[2:17:57] something he didn't just come and say
[2:17:59] you know what come follow me be my
[2:18:02] disciple no Jesus
[2:18:05] acknowledged their first
[2:18:09] profession he acknowledged their
[2:18:12] job in other word God knew that they
[2:18:16] have to be
[2:18:17] trained under a certain environment
[2:18:21] under a certain task because that task
[2:18:25] will be used in the
[2:18:28] future when Joseph went down to Egypt
[2:18:31] God already prepared
[2:18:33] Piper sir he knew that the appropriate
[2:18:37] home that will train Joseph the right
[2:18:39] way toward his future position is only
[2:18:43] the house of Piper
[2:18:46] amen are we together amen so maybe when
[2:18:50] zebede was saying hey John you and James
[2:18:54] let's go work maybe somebody say
[2:18:58] ah again this morning they look their
[2:19:01] friend are playing over there they say
[2:19:04] Daddy our friend are playing over there
[2:19:06] we every day going to this Fishing
[2:19:08] Station Fishing Station all the time
[2:19:10] Fishing Station they didn't know God was
[2:19:12] using that that's right amen so when
[2:19:16] Jesus came Jesus looked at them he said
[2:19:18] come and follow me and I'm going to make
[2:19:21] you fisher of men so their fishing
[2:19:26] technique was a preparation for the
[2:19:29] gospel amen
[2:19:32] amen you say brother Steven fishing
[2:19:35] prepar somebody for the
[2:19:38] gospel brother brandham says this he
[2:19:41] said I love to fish so
[2:19:45] well and most all preachers like to fish
[2:19:52] I'm reading brother Bram I I don't I
[2:19:55] don't fabricate anything you know that
[2:19:59] is where Peter seen who the Lord one
[2:20:02] time and the Apostle when they were what
[2:20:05] fishing so God appeared to them when
[2:20:08] they were fishing I think that is the
[2:20:11] reason preacher like to
[2:20:16] fish I don't know about eating chicken
[2:20:19] now
[2:20:21] I'm reading brother
[2:20:23] Bram amen they all like about that
[2:20:27] crowing of the what rooster but God puts
[2:20:31] these people into a fishing business for
[2:20:34] a
[2:20:35] reason and even the whole kingdom of God
[2:20:39] is compared to a fishing amen Jesus says
[2:20:43] this in Matthew 13 he say again the
[2:20:46] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto what a
[2:20:49] net that was what cast into the sea and
[2:20:52] gather of what every kind which when it
[2:20:55] was full they drew to the what Shore and
[2:20:58] sat down and gather the what the good
[2:21:00] into vessels but cast the bad how away
[2:21:03] so even God kingdom is given like a
[2:21:08] Fisher man going into the fish to fish
[2:21:11] amen so meaning when we preach the
[2:21:13] gospel we pull everything
[2:21:17] amen we're bringing everything to the
[2:21:19] church but the word will
[2:21:25] come from the pulit and begin to
[2:21:28] separate the good from the bad because
[2:21:32] not everything in the nest is a fish
[2:21:35] amen sometime you cut a
[2:21:38] t sometime you cut a
[2:21:42] frog and frog always go forward Looking

[2:32:48] second pool is the pool
[2:32:50] that separate the small fishes and
[2:32:53] exposes the big
[2:32:57] one everybody okay that's why the second
[2:33:01] pool was given to
[2:33:03] Sarah in Genesis 18 as the Messi
[2:33:08] son because when he does one will say
[2:33:17] be and another one will say where the

[2:34:01] minute wait a minute he was not at home
[2:34:04] with me how is he saying this from the
[2:34:08] pulit where did he know this me and my
[2:34:11] wife argue in the morning and now he
[2:34:14] begin to preach about
[2:34:16] argument it is the word discerning
[2:34:22] because as soon as that is right the
[2:34:24] next message you're going to receive
[2:34:27] it if your heart confirmed that what he
[2:34:30] saying is right the next one I am he the
