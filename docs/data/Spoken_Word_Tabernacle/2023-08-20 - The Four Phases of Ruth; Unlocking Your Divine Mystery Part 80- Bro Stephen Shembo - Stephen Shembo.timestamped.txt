[44:18] Genesis 1 verse 26 glory to
[44:22] God you know this now pretty
[44:24] good and God say
[44:28] let us we already answered these
[44:30] questions make man in our own image
[44:35] after our what likeness okay it's
[44:38] working after our
[44:41] likeness and let them have
[44:45] dominion not one person because it's
[44:49] them let them have dominion over the
[44:53] fish of the
[44:54] sea and over the foul of the Earth a and
[44:58] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[45:02] and over every creeping things that
[45:06] creepeth upon the Earth you might be
[45:10] seated right here man is not created
[45:14] yet this is just God expressing his
[45:18] desire to what he's about to create God
[45:21] created the herbs he created the trees
[45:25] he created the fow he created everything
[45:28] now this is at the evening of the sixth
[45:30] day now God have a project amen so
[45:35] whatever we just read here in Genesis
[45:38] 1:26 is just what God has as a project
[45:42] amen man is not created yet are we
[45:45] reading the same Bible let me read it
[45:47] over again and God say let us make men
[45:52] it is a plan it's a project God have not
[45:55] made men yet amen
[45:58] amen let us make man in our image after
[46:03] our what and let them have what Dominion
[46:07] so in other word before Adam
[46:14] existed we okay before Adam is
[46:18] created
[46:20] amen
[46:23] Adam already was
[46:28] that's it are we together are we
[46:31] together amen Adam already was and God
[46:36] is already opening the very
[46:41] plan yes sir the very purpose purpose
[46:45] amen of why what he's trying to create
[46:49] am sir and why is he trying to create it
[46:53] amen God is already explaining it before
[46:57] even one Speck of Adam is
[47:01] manifested everybody okay so what you
[47:05] are on brother today sir and the purpose
[47:10] of God for you today already
[47:16] existed
[47:19] on on now brother Adam didn't have a
[47:22] mother
[47:24] sir no sir come on
[47:28] Adam didn't have a father a natural
[47:32] father
[47:33] Adam is a man the only man that didn't
[47:37] have a belly
[47:39] button that's
[47:41] it in other word this thing
[47:46] happened before your mother even
[47:51] exist Lord before mama and daddy even
[47:55] get married that's it
[47:58] God already knew what he's going to do
[48:00] with you everybody
[48:03] okay so there is a pre-plan if I can
[48:07] call it that way there is a
[48:10] pre-plan amen that already
[48:14] existed and it's
[48:16] described
[48:21] Amen Let Me remove that word pre-plan so
[48:25] he help somebody there is a
[48:28] plan amen that God had for you before
[48:33] you were even
[48:36] created
[48:39] amen God wanted to achieve two things
[48:42] with Adam the first thing God want Adam
[48:47] to look like
[48:52] him everybody okay that's why Adam must
[48:56] have the
[48:58] image and the
[49:00] likeness of God Amen the second part is
[49:06] Adam is not created just to look like
[49:10] God in other word god did not create
[49:13] Adam just to create somebody God had a
[49:16] purpose for Adam amen he had a mission
[49:21] he had a thought that he want Adam to
[49:24] fulfill the second thing is the purpose
[49:28] amen amen of creating
[49:32] Adam what is the purpose and the purpose
[49:36] of Adam is to have
[49:39] dominion in other word God created
[49:42] everything but he want somebody who's
[49:45] going to be on top of
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:48] everything he want the
[49:50] president of what he has
[49:53] created he created the trees he created
[49:57] the fishes he created the bird he
[49:59] created the elephant he created the
[50:01] zebra and all that when he finishes he
[50:05] wants somebody to be in
[50:07] charge somebody to be in control
[50:10] somebody to be responsible a steward for
[50:14] everything that he has created that's
[50:17] the purpose of creating Adam so Adam is
[50:20] not just created for God to see how he
[50:23] can make a man that's it am amen come on
[50:27] Adam is created to take care of certain
[50:31] things and give God a
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] breakes it
[50:41] is that's why when God created Adam the
[50:45] Bible say in the seventh day God did
[50:47] what because there is nothing else God
[50:50] have to do
[50:52] anymore it is up to Adam to take over
[50:56] begin to do what God is supposed to do
[50:59] in other word God wanted to rest sir sir
[51:03] but for God to rest he wants you to be
[51:06] dead yes
[51:10] Lord so when God create you it's for God
[51:14] to rest yes sir yes
[51:16] sir when God activat you in your life it
[51:21] is for God to rest
[51:28] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[51:32] purpose of Adam is to take
[51:35] control is to rule is to take
[51:40] over Amen to have
[51:43] dominion over everything so that God can
[51:47] get a
[51:53] break everybody good have lost somebody
[51:58] because sometime I look at your facial
[51:59] expression then I know somebody's
[52:01] probably have not gotten it yet so I
[52:04] have to break it down again so we make
[52:06] sure we all soak it in
[52:08] amen go verse 27 so God did what created
[52:14] now God is creating amen So the plan of
[52:19] Adam the purpose of Adam Even Adam
[52:23] himself doesn't know it
[52:26] come on now
[52:28] brother when God purposed for Adam Adam
[52:31] was not there yet that's right that's
[52:34] right it was a purpose within God yes
[52:37] sir amen so when God has created Adam
[52:41] Adam doesn't know why God has created
[52:43] him the way he
[52:46] is the mystery is still with God sir yes
[52:51] sir yes sir and God doesn't talk to
[52:54] anybody he say let us
[52:57] so God was talking to
[53:01] God so that nobody understand what he's
[53:04] trying to
[53:05] do so when he finished talking with God
[53:09] God created Adam when Adam is created
[53:13] Adam is just existing but he doesn't
[53:16] know come on now brother who am I come
[53:18] on now brother what am I doing here amen
[53:21] that secret is in God before he created
[53:25] Adam that's right we okay
[53:27] so every potential is in
[53:29] Adam Adam created is unconscious of who
[53:33] he
[53:34] is everybody okay everybody good he is
[53:39] God but somebody need to tell him that's
[53:43] right somebody need to tell Moses who he
[53:45] is come on brother am amen somebody need
[53:49] to tell him
[53:52] amen his mother told him he killed some
[53:57] but when God told
[54:01] him Moses was
[54:04] different when God spoke to Moses who he
[54:08] was things
[54:12] changed but he was born already a
[54:17] liberator but they have to tell him if
[54:20] not he's going to behave like an
[54:22] Egyptian there it is there it is come on
[54:26] now come
[54:28] on uh verse 27 so God created man in his
[54:34] own what image in other words God is now
[54:36] doing what he plan that's right created
[54:40] uh in his own image Amen in the image of
[54:45] God created he him male and female
[54:49] created he them that part is fulfilled
[54:53] the part of creating is fulfilled is now
[54:57] a history amen but the part of let him
[55:00] have dominion God have not done that yet
[55:03] that's correct amen we okay now jum to
[55:07] verse 26 and God did what bless
[55:13] them so despite who you
[55:17] are sir despite what you were created
[55:21] for am you need a blessing
[55:28] that blessing doesn't put stuff in
[55:34] you the blessing doesn't bring the
[55:37] potential of Adam in him that's right
[55:40] Adam is created with
[55:42] potential the blessing don't add
[55:46] anymore
[55:51] sir if you can work we can move I me
[55:54] it's a traffic like I on 85 okay
[55:59] amen but God blessed them and God said
[56:04] to
[56:05] them so the blessing of God comes with
[56:09] an
[56:13] instruction amen scripture have layer
[56:16] I'm just peeling a layer God didn't just
[56:19] come and say bless you and Adam goes no
[56:24] when God is blessing Adam he is also
[56:26] saying something so the blessing of God
[56:31] comes with some words sir some
[56:34] instructions that's right that's
[56:36] right there is a blessing of God and the
[56:41] blessing is couple with
[56:45] instructions amen or it's couple with
[56:48] some
[56:49] words or it's coupled with a revelation
[56:56] amen amen everybody okay everybody okay
[57:00] this instruction that God is about to
[57:03] say is not different than what God had
[57:07] for Adam before he created
[57:12] him
[57:15] remember when Adam is created he doesn't
[57:19] know who he is but before Adam is
[57:23] created God had a plan when God created
[57:27] Adam he's coming to bless him but when
[57:30] he's blessing Adam and
[57:32] Eve he's giving
[57:35] instruction that instruction is an
[57:39] unfolding a
[57:41] revelation of what God had in mind about
[57:46] Adam and
[57:47] [Music]
[57:49] eveen it is not to add anything it's
[57:52] just to let you know who you are amen
[57:55] and what you were created
[57:58] for what is the purpose of your life now
[58:03] you are already existing I need to tell
[58:07] you why I created you and what you are
[58:10] supposed to do and what is your
[58:14] responsibility and what I'm expecting

[1:05:34] the Earth with
[1:05:35] what he's a spirit how is he going to
[1:05:38] replenish the Earth how was God
[1:05:40] replenishing the
[1:05:44] Earth amen and do it subdo it amen in
[1:05:51] other words take full control of the
[1:05:53] Earth make sure everything in the earth
[1:05:55] is under
[1:05:56] you am in other way you make the Earth
[1:06:00] obey
[1:06:03] you that's why you heard brother Bram
[1:06:06] say Adam could move stuff the message is
[1:06:10] perfectly in line with the
[1:06:14] scripture in other word if Adam come and
[1:06:16] say Mountain you cannot be there the M
[1:06:19] have to obey Adam and say uh uh Master
[1:06:25] where do you want me to go he say move
[1:06:27] over there and the mountain goes and
[1:06:29] move they say why did you move he say
[1:06:31] because Adam say
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:36] it not because God
[1:06:44] say because the Earth is already given
[1:06:47] to
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:52] Adam father help me in so
[1:06:56] 115 verse 16 the Bible say the
[1:07:00] what the what even the what are the
[1:07:06] what so the universe don't belong to you
[1:07:10] it belongs to God Amen whatever happen

[1:07:16] everybody okay but the
[1:07:22] what we need to know our band
[1:07:26] so we know what belongs to
[1:07:29] us the sun belongs to God the moon let
[1:07:33] God handle
[1:07:35] that even though sometime I can handle
[1:07:38] also that that's right everybody okay
[1:07:41] but the Earth has he given to the what
[1:07:44] children
[1:07:46] of if they would have said to Adam you
[1:07:50] would have left that to Adam and you put
[1:07:52] yourself out that's correct amen God
[1:07:54] said the children of men
[1:07:57] plural am so the Earth belong for to you
[1:08:00] and me where is that scripture coming
[1:08:03] from because from the beginning they Tau
[1:08:06] man that you need to rule over
[1:08:08] everything that is on the earth in other
[1:08:11] word God is not responsible for what is
[1:08:15] going on on the earth it belongs to man
[1:08:17] to hander the
[1:08:22] Earth you have your house
[1:08:26] but you gave to your son his
[1:08:29] bedroom whatever happened in the bedroom
[1:08:32] is to the son to take care of the
[1:08:33] bedroom that's
[1:08:34] correct that's
[1:08:36] right the remaining of the house belongs
[1:08:39] to you the bedroom is for the boy or for
[1:08:41] the girl the Earth in the universe that
[1:08:46] little chamber that room belongs to me
[1:08:50] amen amen God have given to
[1:08:53] me Hallelujah when I say that your man
[1:08:57] this this thing here is a problem this
[1:09:00] thing amen he says have dominion over

[1:09:06] of the air and over every living thing

[1:09:17] purpose before you are created and when

[1:09:31] instruction amen so the instruction of
[1:09:34] God is a
[1:09:38] blessing the instruction of God is a
[1:09:42] blessing when God speak to you it's
[1:09:44] already a
[1:09:47] blessing because you shall know the
[1:09:50] truth and the truth shall do
[1:09:53] what you shall know the truth if you
[1:09:57] know the truth the truth changes you
[1:10:00] when you know the truth the truth
[1:10:03] changes

[1:12:03] 18 father help
[1:12:09] me the holy spirit is lingering in this
[1:12:12] channel so you understand one thing once
[1:12:15] he will take off from this channel
[1:12:17] whoever didn't get it it's going to be
[1:12:19] up to you and God because God will move

[1:12:29] move on to a different territory and
[1:12:31] later on when I'm going to ask you I say
[1:12:33] do you remember we talk about it and you
[1:12:35] say I don't remember because your mind
[1:12:38] was somewhere when God was trying to
[1:12:40] talk to you so let's keep our mind
[1:12:43] focused amen Genesis
[1:12:46] 18:10 if you dare you can say amen
[1:12:50] amen sometime I'm trying to read more
[1:12:52] quote I just read three and he locks me
[1:12:55] and I go home and he add
[1:12:59] more because he's doing everything so
[1:13:01] you can catch what he's
[1:13:03] saying Genesis 18:10 if you dare you can
[1:13:06] say amen amen glory to God the Bible
[1:13:09] says this and he said Elohim I will

[1:13:28] Sarah your wife shall have a son and
[1:13:32] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:13:35] was behind him now Abraham and Sarah
[1:13:40] were how and how well stricken in
[1:13:45] ag
[1:13:47] Abraham
[1:13:49] Abraham and Sarah amen were
[1:13:53] old and well stricken in age in other
[1:13:59] word they were well
[1:14:03] done when you look at them they are
[1:14:06] really well
[1:14:08] done when you look you cannot even think
[1:14:11] twice whether they are old or not they
[1:14:13] are really old even in the dark you can
[1:14:16] tell that that man is an old man
[1:14:19] that's and God is telling somebody like
[1:14:23] that that you going to I have a
[1:14:28] son not in the 50s because in the 50s we
[1:14:32] can begin to argue with signs correct
[1:14:35] correct when it's
[1:14:39] impossible God say you going to have a
[1:14:44] son amen amen amen verse n 11 he well

[1:15:10] happen God even went to the detail of
[1:15:13] Sarah so we understand the the the the
[1:15:17] the complexity of the
[1:15:20] situation because you must say okay in

[1:21:42] man and my wife is how well stricken in
[1:21:46] years we already
[1:21:48] there we okay amen it is
[1:21:51] confirmed from their own mouth in other
[1:21:55] word how can this
[1:21:58] happen the way we are we are not old we
[1:22:01] are well stricken in
[1:22:04] years we okay jum to verse 26 now we get
[1:22:10] it you there amen and in the sixth month
[1:22:14] the angel the angel Gabriel will sent

[1:22:27] Elizabeth amen and Elizabeth bear a

[1:22:42] Christ everybody clear amen everybody
[1:22:45] clear and a woman in the Bible is a
[1:22:48] church
[1:22:50] right so we got a church burying
[1:22:53] Elizabeth by the name of Elizabeth and
[1:22:56] that church will bear John that's right
[1:22:59] amen and another church will bear
[1:23:02] Christ and those church are together in
[1:23:09] connection verse 26 amen 27 to a virgin
[1:23:14] is passed to a man whose name was Joseph
[1:23:17] of the House of David and the virgin's
[1:23:20] name was Mary and the angel came into
[1:23:24] her and say hell you that are how highly
[1:23:29] favored God spoke in
[1:23:32] Eden and God say the seed of the
[1:23:36] woman shall bruise the head of the
[1:23:38] serpent who is that woman we don't know
[1:23:41] her that's right it is lock under the
[1:23:44] seven seal we okay then later on with
[1:23:48] asaiah Isaiah come and say you know what
[1:23:51] a virgin shall conceive amen yes sir now
[1:23:55] we have more information that is not
[1:23:58] just a woman but that woman will be a
[1:24:00] virgin but who is that woman we don't
[1:24:04] know because many women any woman that
[1:24:07] is born is a
[1:24:10] virgin but who is going to fulfill that
[1:24:12] promise it is hidden in the plan of
[1:24:17] God so now we found a Woman by the name
[1:24:20] of
[1:24:21] Mary so before Mary was
[1:24:26] born 800 years ago away from
[1:24:30] Eden so when God was saying the seed of
[1:24:34] the woman God had Mary in the
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:39] mind everybody okay when Isaiah was
[1:24:43] talking a virgin shall conceive he was
[1:24:46] not any virgin he was Mary in the
[1:24:50] mind but Mary was not aware of who she
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:56] is she needed an
[1:24:59] instruction to reveal to her the purpose
[1:25:02] of God in her
[1:25:05] life are we together Adam didn't know
[1:25:09] who he was he needed an
[1:25:16] instruction Mary thought she was just a
[1:25:19] fiance to somebody she didn't know she
[1:25:23] was the one chosen
[1:25:25] amen until then she cannot produce what
[1:25:28] God sent her to
[1:25:31] produce so to produce what God sent her
[1:25:34] to produce she need the blessing of the
[1:25:37] Lord with
[1:25:40] instruction she need a
[1:25:44] revelation everybody good I'm inist
[1:25:48] that's why brother Bram say I can never
[1:25:52] overemphasize the need up a revelation
[1:25:55] for a Believer Revelation give you
[1:26:01] power Revelation give you the authority
[1:26:05] over the
[1:26:07] Devil Revelation changes your
[1:26:17] world verse 28 Lord help me and the Lord
[1:26:22] came into her and said the angel came
[1:26:25] into her and say hell you that are how
[1:26:29] now Mary knows that she was highly
[1:26:30] favored amen maybe she didn't she
[1:26:34] thought that she was a
[1:26:37] nobody now an instruction come the first
[1:26:40] instruction is you are highly favored
[1:26:43] amen you have to come on brother okay
[1:26:47] you are highly favored the Lord is how
[1:26:51] with
[1:26:52] stop Hallelujah
[1:26:58] Hallelujah do you see any scripture in
[1:27:00] the Bible that says that Mary had
[1:27:03] Visions sir do you see any scripture in
[1:27:06] the Bible that says that Mary had maybe
[1:27:08] miracle in her life so when Mary was
[1:27:13] unconscious of the purpose of God for
[1:27:15] her life God was with her GL
[1:27:21] GL can you please help me preaching
[1:27:28] huh the angel didn't say now that I come
[1:27:32] God begin to be with
[1:27:35] you the Lord the angel said the Lord is
[1:27:37] with you in other word even when you

[1:28:44] man in Genesis 18 was created an old
[1:28:50] man so brother Bram have to match the
[1:28:52] age of Genesis
[1:28:55] [Applause]

[1:52:59] God if you want to know it say amen amen
[1:53:03] you want to know what is impossible to
[1:53:07] God the Bible say in Hebrews 6 that by
[1:53:11] what two imitable things in which he was
[1:53:15] how imposs for God to do what
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:28] all things are impossible to God but
[1:53:32] there is one thing God cannot do is to
[1:53:35] tell a lie in other word when God tell
[1:53:39] you
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:44] something yes sir when God promise you
[1:53:47] something yes sir God can never go back
[1:53:51] and change it
[1:53:59] Paul is saying that it is impossible for
[1:54:03] God to do what we might have a what not
[1:54:08] just a
[1:54:10] consolation in other word when you are
[1:54:13] waiting for the promise and it seems
[1:54:15] like it's not happening remember God
[1:54:18] doesn't lie
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:22] yes
[1:54:23] Lord God can do anything but not try in
[1:54:27] other word whatever God put it's
[1:54:31] finished you can rest your soul there
[1:54:35] and know that it's going to
[1:54:37] [Applause]
[1:54:39] happen everybody okay everybody okay is
[1:54:43] there anything too hard for the Lord no
[1:54:46] with God what nothing the guarantee is
[1:54:49] what 100% guarantee he cannot lie
[1:54:55] in other word he cannot
[1:54:59] change I am the Lord and I
[1:55:03] changes if I determine that I'm going to
[1:55:06] use Mary I have no more option that's
[1:55:10] why you will see God like begging
[1:55:13] Moses
[1:55:15] Jesus oh my God God was begging
[1:55:21] Gideon when Mo say I don't want to go he
[1:55:23] said no no no no no I have uh I have
[1:55:26] already taken care of it Moses say okay
[1:55:29] if I go but they won't believe me okay I
[1:55:31] give you this go show them the first
[1:55:33] sign okay if they don't listen show them
[1:55:35] the second sign if they don't God have
[1:55:37] to do everything to convince Moses
[1:55:40] because he doesn't have a second
[1:55:47] choice if you bring anybody to deliver
[1:55:50] Israel they will fail
[1:55:53] because they are not built for
[1:56:01] deliverance and not only is all things
[1:56:05] impossible possible to God but we saw
[1:56:08] last Sunday that be Jesus say if that
[1:56:11] can what what all are possible to what
[1:56:22] so if you have faith hallu All Things
[1:56:25] become you become like God
[1:56:29] right everybody okay everybody okay

[2:00:19] or knowing God's will for maybe some
[2:00:22] specific things that they
[2:00:26] doing we Okay we okay the Bible says
[2:00:30] this in Revelation 10 verse 7 that but
[2:00:34] in the days of the voice of the what
[2:00:38] seventh angel when he shall begin to do
[2:00:40] what the what mystery of God the mystery
[2:00:44] of God should be how if you look the
[2:00:47] Bible uses mystery
[2:00:49] singular that's right
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] please verify your
[2:00:56] Bible the Bible uses mystery singular we
[2:01:00] the one that say
[2:01:07] Mysteries everybody okay then when
[2:01:10] brother Bram was interpreting this
[2:01:12] scripture brother Bram used a second
[2:01:15] scripture which is Matthew
[2:01:18] 13:1 and brother Bram couple the
[2:01:20] scripture together and in Matthew
[2:01:24] 13:1 the Bible say he answer and say
[2:01:27] unto them because it is given unto who
[2:01:31] you to know the what Mysteries plural of
[2:01:34] the kingdom of what heaven but unto them
[2:01:37] it is not what brother Bram from there
[2:01:40] begin to show that it's not just one
[2:01:43] mystery if you go to the sermon God uh
[2:01:46] sir is this the son of the end time you
[2:01:49] will see brother bam giving a list of
[2:01:51] mystery mystery number one mystery
[2:01:53] number two mystery number three mystery
[2:01:55] number four all the way down the Bible
[2:01:58] say in the Book of Revelation it is
[2:02:01] Mystery singular of God but in Matthew
[2:02:05] it is Mystery plural what is the problem
[2:02:11] there brother Bram say the entire Bible
[2:02:15] is Seal with seven
[2:02:17] seal according to the Book of Revelation
[2:02:20] amen Amen brother Bram said the way
[2:02:23] those seals were locked is that the the
[2:02:27] book in the Old Testament they were not
[2:02:30] like the book that we have here the book
[2:02:33] in the Old Testament were
[2:02:35] Scrolls so the scroll brother Bram say
[2:02:38] they will write a mystery and when they
[2:02:41] finish writing a mystery they will roll
[2:02:44] the mystery everybody okay and when they
[2:02:47] finish rolling the mystery at the end
[2:02:49] here they put a seal
[2:02:52] amen everybody okay then they take the
[2:02:54] second mystery and they write it down
[2:02:57] and they take the second mystery
[2:02:59] everybody following me and they roll it
[2:03:01] on top of the first mystery and when it
[2:03:04] finished they seal it up everybody okay
[2:03:08] and they did it all the way to the
[2:03:10] seventh
[2:03:12] mystery everybody okay so the book on
[2:03:16] the
[2:03:17] outside is Seal with the last seal
[2:03:22] which is the seven seal in other word
[2:03:26] the Bible entirely is locked by one
[2:03:33] [Applause]
[2:03:35] seal everybody good that's why in The
[2:03:38] Book of Revelation when they open the
[2:03:41] first seal God gave
[2:03:44] information that it's a white horse
[2:03:46] right there it is this this this this
[2:03:49] when they open the second seal God gave
[2:03:51] an instruction the third but when they
[2:03:53] open the seven seal if you notice God
[2:03:57] never give one
[2:03:58] instruction God just say it is what a
[2:04:02] silence why because the last mystery
[2:04:06] doesn't have one specific
[2:04:11] mystery everybody okay it is the Seal of
[2:04:15] the seals it is the Seal of the entire
[2:04:19] seal it is the seal
[2:04:22] once you open it it begin to open other
[2:04:27] [Applause]
[2:04:30] seals everybody okay everybody okay
[2:04:34] brother Bram says this Oh Glory to God
[2:04:37] he says if Satan should get a hold of it
[2:04:41] he might do what that's why God locks it
[2:04:45] there is one thing he don't know and he
[2:04:48] can interpret anything he want to he can
[2:04:51] interpret what is on the front path and
[2:04:53] impersonate any kind of a gift I hope
[2:04:55] you learning but he can know what this
[2:04:58] it is not even written in the word it is
[2:05:01] a total what
[2:05:04] secret the
[2:05:06] angel it is not written in the word
[2:05:10] doesn't means it's not in the
[2:05:12] [Applause]
[2:05:15] Bible it is not written in the word
[2:05:18] because it was seal in the word not
[2:05:22] written but seal so you cannot read it
[2:05:26] and see the seals the seal have to be
[2:05:32] broken everybody okay we already went
[2:05:35] through this the angel the angel
[2:05:38] everything shut up if they have made how
[2:05:41] one he might give away what something
[2:05:44] away he will tell who Mary is and the
[2:05:47] devil will nail her so they just do what
[2:05:50] shut up virgin shall conceive who's the
[2:05:53] Virgin we don't know they quit doing
[2:05:56] what everything did what seven gods what
[2:06:00] perfect number he didn't say the number
[2:06:02] of perfection that's three he say God
[2:06:04] perfect number everybody okay and
[2:06:07] brother Bram knocks on the pit how many
[2:06:10] times bum buom buom buom till seven he
[2:06:13] said just write down the what seven what
[2:06:17] Thunders adding straight together like
[2:06:20] they were doing what out something in
[2:06:23] other word brother Bram say when they
[2:06:25] were rap when they rap the seven seal
[2:06:28] the seven seal doesn't open and lock
[2:06:31] once you open the seventh seal the
[2:06:33] seventh seal goes and open the Sixth
[2:06:35] Seal and the six and he goes again and
[2:06:38] open the other one it is in a check in a
[2:06:41] sequence like 1 2 3 4 5 until the whole
[2:06:45] book is
[2:06:47] out in other word once the sevenant here
[2:06:51] is open it is the seven seal that
[2:06:55] continue to open every scripture in the
[2:07:02] Bible the seventh seal is not limited to
[2:07:06] the
[2:07:07] book The Seven seal continue to unfold
[2:07:11] all the way to Eternity that's why
[2:07:14] brother Bram say it's like a rocket that
[2:07:16] open and shoot and open again and shoot
[2:07:19] and open up in other word the seven seal
[2:07:23] is what you need to open and our life
[2:07:26] also our Hidden

[2:08:09] mystery will take care of every other
[2:08:15] Mysteries everybody good everybody clear

[2:08:21] Mysteries but the mystery of your life

[2:08:31] remaining of Mary's life is taken care

[2:09:04] back in our Tabernacle where we are
[2:09:06] still waiting for rof before she
[2:09:08] departed amen we understand now clearly
[2:09:12] that to be born again or to receive the
[2:09:15] baptism of the Holy Spirit or to receive
[2:09:18] eternal life you must be predestinated
[2:09:20] for now we this stretch it clear let's
[2:09:24] climb and let me see how far I can climb
[2:09:27] in act 13 verse 48 the Bible say when
[2:09:31] the Gentile heard thisuh they were how
[2:09:34] glad and glorified the word of the what
[2:09:37] Lord and as many as were how orain to
[2:09:41] eternal life did what so to receive
[2:09:44] eternal life you must be ordained for it
[2:09:49] right everybody good if I if you have a
[2:09:53] question with my Bible you open your
[2:09:55] Bible and you
[2:09:59] verify those that were in question and
[2:10:01] answer we already handled this so to
[2:10:03] have eternal
[2:10:05] life amen to have eternal life you must
[2:10:09] be how
[2:10:12] orain father help me in other word if
[2:10:15] you not ordain you're not going to
[2:10:17] receive eternal life that's right that's
[2:10:19] why brother Bram say in non there is
[2:10:22] nothing to
[2:10:28] Quicken we all have
[2:10:32] this right the unbeliever have this GL
[2:10:37] everybody okay you got a body the
[2:10:40] unbeliever got a body you got a spirit a
[2:10:44] human Spirit the unbeliever the drunker
[2:10:47] that is on the street there he also have
[2:10:49] a spirit like you he can sometimes speak
[2:10:52] better English than
[2:10:54] you and you even speak crooked
[2:10:57] English so if you try to match up in the
[2:11:00] body some probably might be more fairer
[2:11:03] they beautiful than you you won't match
[2:11:05] them in the spirit they might be more
[2:11:07] intellectual than you you won't match
[2:11:10] them they also have a soul that's right
[2:11:13] we also have a soul so in those
[2:11:16] perspective there is no difference
[2:11:18] between you and the child of the devil
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:23] on everybody okay the only difference
[2:11:27] between you and anybody is what is in
[2:11:33] here what is inside
[2:11:37] here everybody okay some people have it
[2:11:41] some people
[2:11:42] don't we clear we clear so to receive
[2:11:47] eternal life you must be ordained
[2:11:50] [Applause]
[2:11:56] the Bible in the book of second
[2:11:58] Thessalonian speak of the body the soul
[2:12:01] and the spirit and never mention the
[2:12:03] seed the seed was unfold by Brother BR
[2:12:07] that's why when they tried to kill the
[2:12:09] baby of jeroboam the Bible says you kill
[2:12:13] everybody from the family of jeroboam
[2:12:15] you remember we went through that amen
[2:12:18] you don't bury them you only bury the
[2:12:20] baby because in the baby there was found
[2:12:23] something good toward
[2:12:26] God he was not an adult a baby but when
[2:12:30] they say something good it is not our
[2:12:32] good the Rich Young Ruler thought Jesus
[2:12:35] Christ good Master Jesus say how do you
[2:12:39] call me good there is no good but who so
[2:12:42] the good in that baby was God in that
[2:12:45] [Applause]
[2:12:46] baby everybody okay that's why that baby
[2:12:50] could be buried but no body else if you
[2:12:52] need a scripture for predestinate
[2:12:56] seed we okay now you okay my friend so
[2:13:00] to have eternal life you must be
[2:13:02] ordained for it no ordination no
[2:13:05] predestination no eternal life in John
