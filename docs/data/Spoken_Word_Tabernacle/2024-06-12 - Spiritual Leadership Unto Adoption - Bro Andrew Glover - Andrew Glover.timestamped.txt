[31:46] Heavenly Father, Lord, your power, Lord,

[31:51] Lord, and Lord, your word is light,
[31:53] Father. And your word is the healer,
[31:55] Lord God. And Lord, as you sent out your
[31:57] word, Father, Lord, we received your
[31:59] word, Father, and we put it into action,
[32:00] Lord God, by praying and believing, Lord
[32:03] God. And you have answered our request,
[32:04] Father. Lord, you're faithful, Lord God.

[32:12] anything lingering, Lord, from the cares
[32:14] of the day, Father, Lord, if we have
[32:16] sinned against one another, Lord God, or
[32:18] said something wrong, Lord God, Lord,
[32:20] what a better place, Lord, to ask for
[32:22] forgiveness, Lord, for our sins and in

[32:43] your continuation, Lord God, of your
[32:45] healing power, Lord, amongst the people,
[32:46] Lord God, that are continuing to

[32:49] sometimes you work a healing, Lord God,
[32:51] and not always a miracle, Lord God. And

[32:55] Lord God, we pray, Lord God, for the
[32:57] remainder of the service, Lord Jesus
[32:59] Christ, that you take it into your
[33:00] hands, Father, and minister to your
[33:02] children, Father, the things that we

[33:05] uncarchable riches, heavenly Father,
[33:07] that you have declared to us, Lord, when

[33:10] the word that we all have need of,
[33:12] Father, according to our needs, Lord
[33:13] Jesus. Father, we pray, Lord God, that
[33:15] you bless the tithes and the offerings,
[33:17] Lord God, and that you use them for the
[33:19] furtherance of your kingdom, Father. We
[33:21] ask that you grant the wisdom, the

[41:38] happy.
[41:39] Amen.
[41:40] We greet you all in the precious name of
[41:42] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Both
[41:45] visible and invisible audience. Amen.
[41:50] We appreciate all the family members
[41:52] here. We do not have visitor. Good to
[41:54] see you, brother Manuel, Sister Grace,
[41:56] my brother back there. If I miss
[41:58] somebody, God richly bless you. And
[42:01] mama, God richly bless you. Good to see
[42:04] you again. And welcome to Spoken Word
[42:06] Tabernacle. Amen.
[42:09] God bless you, Sister Morai and Malachi.
[42:12] If you know she's here, you know what it
[42:14] means.
[42:15] So I won't tell you who's preaching
[42:17] because you already know what's going
[42:18] on. Amen. Glory to God. You see that's
[42:21] your home. This is your second home.
[42:24] Amen. Glory. Glory be to the name of the
[42:26] Lord. So everybody up to date with the
[42:28] sermon.

[42:31] catching up and being right there. So
[42:33] Lord's willing on Sunday we take off
[42:35] again. Amen.
[42:36] Glory to God. So brother Andrew Glover,
[42:39] I need to repent. I have to tell you
[42:40] who's preaching. Brother Angel Glover.
[42:44] At least I need to repent. Amen. I can't
[42:47] hide the secret from you. So just
[42:50] understand. Brother Brandham had the
[42:51] same thing. Not that I'm brother
[42:52] Brandham. I'm just feeling what he was
[42:55] feeling for the church. Amen. I don't
[42:57] want somebody say he says that he think
[42:58] it's brother. No, there is no one who
[43:01] can replace or no one can take the place
[43:04] of brother.
[43:06] Amen. He's the only one that is the
[43:09] seven angel messenger. Period.
[43:13] Amen.
[43:14] Amen.
[43:15] So we got we got the prophet of the age
[43:18] which is the pastor of the age.
[43:20] Everybody else Ephesians 4.
[43:23] Whether you a pastor, you a teacher, you
[43:26] are evangelist, you an apostle, whoever
[43:28] you are,
[43:30] Ephesians 4 under Malachi 4.
[43:34] We clear on that one. That's the
[43:36] position that we stand in this church.
[43:38] That's why we quote brother Brandham say
[43:41] ah that's the one that we can quote
[43:43] here. We quote the Bible and the message
[43:45] of the hour. That's it. Amen. We can
[43:48] appreciate one another. We can pull from
[43:50] somebody else. But what we are standing
[43:52] on is what the prophet said.
[43:55] Amen.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:56] So let's go with only believe and pull
[43:59] on the gift of the Lord. We love brother
[44:02] Andrew.
[44:04] Wonderful.
[44:05] And this is his second home.
[44:08] And we love brother Sean Martin and
[44:11] everything they're doing for the kingdom
[44:12] and him being available. I was talking
[44:14] to brother Maurice today. I say we just
[44:17] gracious this year that I can get him
[44:19] like this because usually if you know
[44:22] him better, it's hard. You have to
[44:24] schedule six month down the road or
[44:26] something just to get this man right
[44:28] here. But but God's grace this year is a
[44:31] special year. God is doing many things.
[44:33] Amen.
[44:34] So let's go with only believe.
[44:37] Only
[44:40] believe.
[44:43] [Music]
[44:45] Oh,
[44:47] we believe

[44:53] all things
[44:55] are impossible.
[45:00] Only

[45:13] [Music]
[45:15] All

[45:23] all things
[45:26] are possible.
[45:30] Only
[45:34] believe.
[45:36] Oh, and Lord,
[45:40] I believe.
[45:45] Lord,
[45:48] I believe
[45:52] that all things
[45:56] are possible.
[46:00] Lord, I

[46:05] [Music]
[46:07] Oh Lord,
[46:10] I believe.
[46:14] Lord,

[46:21] that all things are possible.
[46:29] Lord, I
[46:33] believe.
[46:35] Amen. How many believers do we have here
[46:37] tonight?
[46:38] Amen. We know that wherever believers
[46:40] are, something good always happens.
[46:42] Amen. And looking around tonight and see
[46:44] so many, Amen. Not just believers, but
[46:47] genuine believers and faithful
[46:48] believers. And Amen. The devil give you
[46:51] every reason not to believe, but here
[46:52] you are still believing. Amen. Because
[46:55] that's who you are. Amen. As a believer,
[46:58] amen. What an honor it is tonight to be
[46:59] in the house of God. And want to thank
[47:01] you, brother Steven, once again, for the
[47:03] opportunity, the invitation to be here.
[47:05] Amen. Amen. We want to just say it's a
[47:07] real privilege to be uh speaking to you
[47:09] once again tonight. And if you have your
[47:11] Bibles, we want to go straight to the
[47:12] word. We want to turn to the book of St.
[47:14] John the 16th chapter. Amen. We want to
[47:17] look there tonight. And we just want to
[47:19] greet you all on behalf of our pastor,
[47:21] Brother Shawn Martin. And the saints
[47:22] there at Faith Tabernacle said to be
[47:24] sure and greet you all tonight. And
[47:25] amen. Also want to bring you bring you
[47:27] greetings from a dear friend of your
[47:29] alls, brother Emanuel Salazar. Amen.
[47:31] From out there in Espanola, New Mexico.
[47:33] We were just there with him this weekend
[47:35] for some meetings and just the Lord done
[47:37] some wonderful things there. So we sure
[47:39] want to I know he'd want us to greet you
[47:41] all for him and Amen. So you all
[47:44] remember us in prayer. We're here
[47:45] tonight and flying out tomorrow to
[47:47] California and then Tuesday to
[47:48] Australia. So you all keep us in your
[47:50] prayers and Amen. We'll be praying for
[47:52] you and we'll see you when we get back
[47:54] on this side. Amen. Amen. The book of
[47:56] St. John the 16th chapter in the 13th
[48:00] verse. We want to read there in St. John
[48:03] 16 and verse number 13,
[48:06] the Bible says, "How be it when he, the
[48:10] Spirit of truth, is come,
[48:13] he will guide you into all truth."
[48:16] For he shall not speak of himself,
[48:19] but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall
[48:22] he speak, and he will show you things to
[48:25] come.
[48:25] Amen.
[48:26] Now, Brother Bram says, in other words,
[48:28] he'll be the one that will reveal
[48:30] the thing you see. So, you're going to
[48:31] be looking at something, but when the
[48:33] spirit of truth comes, he will lead you,
[48:36] guide you, or show you
[48:39] what you're looking at.
[48:40] Now, in the book of Romans, the eth
[48:42] chapter, Romans chapter 8 and verse
[48:45] number 14,
[48:47] Romans chapter 8 and verse number 14, I
[48:50] just want to read a very, very familiar
[48:54] uh reading there in Romans 8 and verse
[48:56] 14.
[48:57] Yes, sir.
[48:59] The Bible here says, "For as many as are
[49:03] led by the spirit of God,
[49:06] they are the sons of God."
[49:08] Amen.
[49:08] Now, we have just identified the spirit
[49:11] of truth of John 16
[49:13] as the spirit of God in Romans 8. That's
[49:16] leading the sons of God.
[49:17] For ye have not received the spirit of
[49:20] bondage again to fear,
[49:23] but ye have received the spirit of
[49:25] adoption. Now, Brother Brham says, "I've
[49:28] come, God, rich in mercy." He says,
[49:29] "I've come to get you away from this
[49:32] fear and scare that you don't know who
[49:34] you are.
[49:35] You're not going to be the sons of God.
[49:38] You always were the sons of God." So,
[49:40] we're not going back to an up and down
[49:43] lifestyle of one day I'm a son, the next
[49:45] day I'm not. But we're receiving the
[49:48] spirit of adoption whereby we cry ab.
[49:52] Now watch. And the spirit itself beareth
[49:55] witness with our spirit,
[49:57] not that we will be, but that we are the
[50:01] children of God.
[50:02] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts together
[50:04] tonight. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[50:06] for the reading of your word. We thank
[50:08] you for the anointing, Lord, that we
[50:10] feel in the building tonight. Lord, it's
[50:12] more than just a song anointing or a
[50:14] music anointing, but Lord, it's the
[50:16] anointing of Isaiah that destroys the
[50:19] yoke of the enemy. And Lord, as we look
[50:21] into your word tonight, I pray that you
[50:23] would open the windows of heaven. And
[50:25] Lord, may you fill this this building,
[50:27] this room tonight with the anointing of
[50:30] revelation. Lord, may confusions be
[50:32] broke. May unbelief be broke. Father, I
[50:35] pray that you would send strength into
[50:37] every heart here tonight. And Lord,
[50:39] we'll be sure to give thee all the
[50:40] praise, all the honor, and all the glory
[50:43] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[50:45] Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all
[50:48] the believers says, "Amen." And amen.
[50:51] God bless you tonight. As you may have
[50:53] your seats here tonight, I want to by
[50:55] the help of the Lord for just a few
[50:56] moments, I want to speak to you here.
[50:58] And if I title this tonight, I want to
[51:00] speak to you on spiritual leadership
[51:02] unto adoption.
[51:04] Spiritual leadership unto adoption. Now,
[51:07] you all know that the prophet of God
[51:09] said that we were predestinated unto
[51:12] adoption. So, we were not just
[51:13] predestinated just to be predestinated,
[51:16] but we were predestinated unto
[51:18] something. And what we were
[51:19] predestinated unto is adoption. Now,
[51:22] when we speak of this adoption, we're
[51:24] not speaking of a natural adoption, but
[51:26] rather we're speaking, amen, of a
[51:28] spiritual adoption. So, amen. If you're
[51:31] going to get somewhere spiritual, you're
[51:32] not going to do it naturally, but you're
[51:34] going to have to do it by the spirit. If
[51:36] you're going to get somewhere naturally,
[51:38] you're going to have to do it naturally.
[51:39] So if it was a natural adoption, then
[51:41] there would be a natural leadership unto
[51:43] that adoption. But this is not a natural
[51:46] adoption. This is a spiritual adoption.
[51:49] Amen. So there must be a spiritual
[51:51] leadership to arrive. Amen. At that
[51:54] spiritual adoption. Now, brother Ben
[51:56] preaches a sermon. It's amazing. End of
[51:57] his ministry, right before he goes off
[51:59] the earth, he preaches a sermon called
[52:01] leadership. And he said, "Now remember
[52:04] this that each one of us, young and old,
[52:06] your first step you ever made in your
[52:08] life, Amen, someone had to lead you."
[52:11] That's exactly right.
[52:12] And the last step you ever make, someone
[52:15] will be leading you. Amen. Someone has
[52:17] to lead. Now, I've met people, they say,
[52:19] "Well, I'm my own leader." In all
[52:21] reality, that's not the truth. Amen.
[52:23] Something is leading you. You're you're
[52:25] either being led by by God. Amen. Or
[52:28] you're being led by the devil. But
[52:30] something is leading you. See, because
[52:33] God has likened us unto sheep. And if
[52:36] anyone knows about raising sheep and the
[52:38] nature of sheep, Amen. then you know
[52:40] that a sheep cannot find his way around.
[52:43] Amen. He has to be led. So, Amen. A
[52:45] sheep cannot find his way. Amen. He has
[52:48] to be led. Even in the slaughter pins,
[52:51] we find that they bring the sheep there
[52:53] and he's led up into the slaughter by a
[52:55] goat. Amen. A goat leads him up. Then
[52:57] when he gets to the end, he jumps out.
[52:59] Amen. And the sheep goes right on in the
[53:01] slaughter. Amen. Because we find that a
[53:04] sheep cannot find his way around. Amen.
[53:07] Now, let's let's take that a step
[53:08] further. Amen. Do you realize that
[53:10] people are not going to find their way
[53:12] into tribulation? Amen. But there's
[53:14] something leading them into tribulation.
[53:16] Now you all know the Bible says that the
[53:18] blind lead the blind and they all fall
[53:21] into a ditch. Amen. Do you realize that
[53:23] creeds and dogmas is leading people,
[53:26] Amen, into a tribulation? Amen. But at
[53:28] the same time, AMEN. THERE'S A BRIDE ON
[53:31] THE earth that's being led, Amen, not by
[53:34] the enemy, BUT BY GOD WHO IS THE SPIRIT
[53:36] of truth. Listen, the spirit of error is
[53:40] leading people to tribulation. AMEN. BUT
[53:42] THE spirit of truth is leading the
[53:44] bride, amen, to the TRANSLATION OF HER
[53:47] BODY. LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
[53:49] THINK TONIGHT, BUT I WANT TO tell you
[53:50] what you ought to be thinking. YOU OUGHT
[53:52] TO BE FAKING GOD. THAT HE SENT A PROPHET
[53:54] THAT HE SENT A MESSAGE IN THIS
[53:56] GENERATION. THAT HE WOULD CALL YOU FROM
[53:58] THE IDEAS. HE WOULD CALL YOU FROM THE
[54:00] TRADITIONS OF RELIGION and would place
[54:02] you underneath an anointing. Amen. That
[54:05] had the ability to lead you to a
[54:07] brighter future. Amen. Than where the
[54:09] world is headed. Hey, I think it's a
[54:11] powerful thing to know. Amen. That we're
[54:13] not just going through the Bible on our
[54:15] own. Amen. But the spirit of truth,
[54:18] amen, has returned to the church and he
[54:21] is leading us through the word. Now, you
[54:23] all know that that brother Brandham was
[54:25] a lover of the Bible. How many knows
[54:27] that?
[54:27] Amen.
[54:28] Brother Brandham loved the Bible. He
[54:30] would say things like this. I love to
[54:32] study the Bible. He said, I like to take
[54:34] the books of the Bible. Amen. And just
[54:36] study through them. You all, you all
[54:38] know that he he said one time he
[54:39] preached a series on Genesis and then he
[54:42] went through Exodus and when he preaches
[54:44] the kinsman redeemer, he takes time to
[54:46] show you how that they were wanting to
[54:48] put the book of Ruth out of the Bible.
[54:50] He said, "But no, God would not let him
[54:52] put it out." Amen. Because there was a
[54:54] hidden secret of redemption in there.
[54:56] Amen. Then he comes and preaches the
[54:58] book of Ephesians. And he would preach
[55:00] the Hebrew series. HE HE WOULD PREACH
[55:02] THE BOOK OF REVELATION. He said, "See in
[55:04] adoption part three," he said, you know,
[55:06] I'd like to take time where we could get
[55:08] on the book of Hebrews or the book of
[55:10] Exodus, how God Exodus bringing out his
[55:13] people out of Egypt. Amen. In Exodus, a
[55:16] very beautiful type. Amen. Of us now
[55:19] getting ready for our Exodus. Amen. Oh,
[55:21] it's such a beautiful thing. Amen. The
[55:24] whole scripture just ties together.
[55:26] Amen. And it's one big story. AMEN. I
[55:29] SAY WE OUGHT TO WE OUGHT TO REJOICE
[55:31] TONIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. THAT WE DID NOT
[55:33] RECEIVE A THEOLOGIAN. WE WE DID NOT
[55:35] RECEIVE A REFORMER. WE DID NOT RECEIVE
[55:38] some philosopher or some commentator.
[55:41] Amen. That was probing at things IN THE
[55:42] WORD. BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED A DIVINELY
[55:45] SENT PROPHET OF GOD THAT HAS THE
[55:47] ABILITY, AMEN, TO TAKE GENESIS and to
[55:50] take Exodus and to take Ruth and Hebrews
[55:53] and Revelation, amen, AND SAY, "LISTEN,
[55:55] THIS IS NOT A HISTORY LESSON. AMEN. THIS
[55:58] IS NOT SOMETHING JUST HISTORICAL. BUT
[56:00] THERE'S A REVELATION laying here. And if
[56:03] you CAN CATCH THE REVELATION, IT WILL
[56:05] LIFT YOU OUT OF THIS EARTHLY DIMENSION
[56:07] and will place you into HEAVENLY PLACES.
[56:10] HEY, I SAY THANK GOD THAT WE'VE received
[56:12] a heavenly MESSAGE WITH A HEAVENLY
[56:14] ANOINTING WITH A HEAVENLY POWER. LISTEN,
[56:17] WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN ERROR. AMEN.
[56:19] WE'VE RECEIVED the spirit OF TRUTH.
[56:23] YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY THE DAYS OF
[56:25] MAKING excuses for error ought to be
[56:27] over.
[56:28] COME ON. IT OUGHT TO BE LONG GONE.
[56:29] THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. 40 YEARS AGO,
[56:31] IT WAS OKAY CUZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE
[56:33] COMPUTERS and they didn't have the
[56:35] things THAT WE HAVE NOW. AMEN. BUT THERE
[56:37] SHOULD BE NO ERROR IN A MESSAGE PULLPIT
[56:40] WHEN WE'VE GOT WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT.
[56:44] NOW, COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. IF WE GOT A
[56:46] MESSAGE and it's a vindicated message,
[56:49] THERE SHOULD BE NO PERSONAL IDEAS. AMEN.
[56:52] ON ONE SUBJECT IN THIS BIBLE IN A
[56:54] MESSAGE PULLPIT. WE OUGHT TO COME BACK
[56:56] TO THE LANDMARK OF THE CHURCH, WHICH IS
[56:58] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND SAY WHAT A
[57:01] PROPHET SAID. SEE, it's tying the
[57:04] picture together. Now, you all KNOW IN
[57:06] THE BIBLE, AMEN, THAT Jesus himself
[57:08] instructed us, amen, to examine the
[57:11] scriptures. He said, "Search the
[57:13] scriptures." Amen. For in them you think
[57:16] you have eternal life. Amen. and they
[57:19] are they which testify of me.
[57:22] Brother said, "Oh, I just love this
[57:23] word, these old nuggets." See, I'm a
[57:26] prospector. I like to dig down and get
[57:29] the nuggets and polish them up. Amen.
[57:32] And hang them out there. Amen. Everyone
[57:34] you find will point to Calvary.
[57:36] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[57:38] SO, A PROPHET was digging through the
[57:40] scripture. Amen. TO FIND THE GOLDEN
[57:43] NUGGETS. AMEN. TO TIE THEM TOGETHER AND
[57:46] TO PLACE THEM BEFORE THE CHURCH AND SAY,
[57:48] "NOW, YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR WAY TO
[57:50] CALVARY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY
[57:52] DENOMINATION. YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR WAY
[57:54] TO CALVARY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY
[57:56] EDUCATION. BUT IF YOU'LL COME BACK
[57:58] UNDERNEATH the spirit of truth, he will
[58:01] lead YOU AND HE WILL GUIDE YOU ALL THE
[58:04] WAY TO THE PLACE OF TRANSFORMATION,
[58:06] which is Calvary." Amen. Amen. I'm going
[58:08] to slow down here. I'm going to slow
[58:10] down here for just a second and I'm
[58:12] going to read you something from the
[58:13] book of Acts, the 8th chapter and the
[58:15] 26th verse. And I want you to see, amen,
[58:18] that it takes spiritual leadership,
[58:20] amen, to go through the scriptures.
[58:22] That's right.
[58:22] In Acts chapter 8:26, the Bible says,
[58:25] "And the angel of the Lord spake unto
[58:27] Philillip," AMEN. SAYING, "ARISE, AND GO
[58:30] TOWARDS THE SOUTH, UNTO THE WAY THAT
[58:32] GOETH down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
[58:35] which is a desert." And he arose and
[58:38] went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a
[58:40] unic of great authority under Cadence,
[58:43] the queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
[58:45] charge of all her treasure, and had come
[58:48] to Jerusalem for to worship, was
[58:50] returning and was sitting in his
[58:52] chariot. Amen. READING ISAIAH THE
[58:55] PROPHET. AMEN. HE WAS READING THE BIBLE.
[58:57] HE HAD THE BIBLE. HE WAS READING WHAT
[59:00] ISAIAH SAID. BUT THEN THE SPIRIT said
[59:02] unto Philillip, Amen, go near and join
[59:05] thyself to this chariot. That's right.
[59:07] And Philip ran thither to him and heard
[59:10] him read the prophet Isaiah and said,
[59:12] "UNDERSTANDEST THOU WHAT THOU READEST?"
[59:15] AND HE SAID, "HOW CAN I ACCEPT some
[59:18] man?" AMEN. SHOULD GUIDE ME. COME ON,
[59:21] CHURCH. AMEN. PEOPLE SAY WE'RE MAN
[59:23] FOLLOWERS. AMEN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
[59:25] WE'RE A MAN FOLLOWER, YOU GOT TO SAY
[59:27] THIS MAN WAS BECAUSE HE WAS HOLDING THE
[59:29] BIBLE AND HE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT
[59:32] HE WAS READING. BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT OF
[59:34] THE LORD, AMEN, COME UPON THE SITUATION,
[59:37] HE CARRIED HIM AWAY INTO THE SPIRIT.
[59:40] AMEN. AMEN.
[59:41] NOW WATCH. HE SAID, "HOW CAN I except
[59:44] some MAN SHOULD GUIDE ME?" And he
[59:46] desired Philillip that he would come up
[59:48] and sit with him. The place of the
[59:51] scripture which he read was this. He was
[59:53] led as a sheep to the slaughter. And
[59:56] like a lamb dumb before his sheer, so he
[59:59] opened NOT HIS MOUTH. IN his
[1:00:00] humiliation, his judgment was taken
[1:00:03] away. And who shall declare his
[1:00:05] generation? For his life is taken from
[1:00:08] THE EARTH. GO AHEAD. OH, CAN I AMEN. CAN
[1:00:10] I JUST BREAK IN ON AMEN. HERE'S A MAN
[1:00:13] READING SOMETHING. AMEN. AND NOT EVEN
[1:00:15] REALIZING HE'S A PART OF WHAT HE'S
[1:00:18] READING. NOT EVEN REALIZING THAT HE IS A
[1:00:21] PART OF THE SEED THAT WILL DECLARE THE
[1:00:24] GENERATION.
[1:00:25] PREACH MY BROTHER, PREACH.
[1:00:27] OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I REMEMBER
[1:00:30] THOSE DAYS WHEN I READ GENESIS AND I
[1:00:32] READ EXODUS AND I READ HEBREWS AND I
[1:00:35] READ THE BOOK OF RUTH. I READ THE BOOK
[1:00:37] OF REVELATION AND I HAD NO IDEA, BROTHER
[1:00:40] EMANUEL, THAT I WAS A PART OF WHAT I WAS
[1:00:43] READING. BUT IN THE EVENING TIME IT
[1:00:46] SHALL BE LIGHT. GOD WOULD SEND A PROPHET
[1:00:49] TO THIS GENERATION WITH THE SPIRIT OF
[1:00:52] TRUTH TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY
[1:00:55] WHAT YOU'RE READING IS WHO YOU ARE. YOU
[1:00:58] ARE TAMAR. YOU ARE RUTH. YOU ARE
[1:01:01] REBECCA. YOU ARE THE BRIDE. YOU ARE THE
[1:01:04] QUEEN OF HEAVEN. YOU ARE THE NEW
[1:01:06] JERUSALEM. YOU ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS.
[1:01:09] HEY, YOU ARE THE SEED THAT SHALL POSSESS
[1:01:13] THE GATES OF EVERY ONE OF ITS ENEMIES.
[1:01:17] GLORY.
[1:01:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:19] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:20] HAD NO IDEA. BUT GOD WOULD SEND A
[1:01:24] PROPHET.
[1:01:24] YES, MY BROTHER. TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:01:26] AND THE UNIC ANSWERED PHILILLIP,
[1:01:28] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:01:29] AND SAID, WELL THEN I PRAY THEE of whom
[1:01:30] speaketh the prophet this
[1:01:32] OF HIMSELF
[1:01:33] OR OF SOME OTHER MAN? THEN PHILIP OPENED
[1:01:36] HIS MOUTH
[1:01:37] AND BEGAN at the same scripture and
[1:01:40] preached UNTO HIM JESUS.
[1:01:41] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:01:42] AND AS THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY, they came
[1:01:44] UNTO A CERTAIN WATER.
[1:01:45] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:01:46] AND THE UNIC SAID, see here is water,
[1:01:48] what do hinder me to be baptized? And
[1:01:51] Philip said, if thou believest with all
[1:01:54] thine heart,
[1:01:56] come on. Any man, if any man's going to
[1:01:59] lead you, the first thing he's GOING TO
[1:02:02] DO IS CHALLENGE YOUR BELIEF. THAT'S IT.
[1:02:04] HE'S GOING TO SAY, "IF THOU CAN'T
[1:02:06] BELIEVE,
[1:02:07] THAT'S IT.
[1:02:07] THEN ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE." THAT'S
[1:02:09] IT.
[1:02:09] IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, NOT EVEN CANCER
[1:02:13] will stand in THE WAY OF YOUR PRAYER.
[1:02:15] AMEN.
[1:02:16] Come on, church. YOU KNOW I'M IN THE
[1:02:18] MESSAGE. THE HARDEST THING, THE HARDEST
[1:02:20] THING THAT GOD HAS EVER HAD TO DO is to
[1:02:23] get one mortal to believe another. BUT
[1:02:26] DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IT WAS EASY TO
[1:02:28] BELIEVE WILLIAM BRANDHAM? IT'S BECAUSE
[1:02:30] IT WAS NOT ONE MORTAL BELIE.
[1:02:33] IT WAS A BELIEVER BELIEVING THE SPIRIT
[1:02:36] OF TRUTH THAT WAS PROMISED TO RETURN to
[1:02:39] them and to lead THEM INTO ALL TRUTH.
[1:02:42] LISTEN, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CHOKE ON WHAT
[1:02:45] A PROPHET SAID. BUT BECAUSE I HAVE A
[1:02:48] SEED IN MY SOUL, I CAN'T CHOKE ON IT.
[1:02:51] I'VE GOT TO PREACH IT. I CAN'T CHOKE ON
[1:02:53] IT. I'VE GOT TO AGREE WITH IT BECAUSE I
[1:02:56] FOUND MY PLACE IN the word of God.
[1:03:01] I BELIEVE THAT HE IS JESUS CHRIST, THE
[1:03:04] SON OF GOD.
[1:03:05] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:03:07] THAT'S WHAT PHILIP SAID.
[1:03:08] HE SAID, I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS
[1:03:11] THE SON OF GOD. ARE YOU HEARING ME? ARE
[1:03:14] YOU HEARING ME? AMEN. WHAT DID HE WHAT
[1:03:16] WHAT DID THIS person get him to
[1:03:17] acknowledge? Did he GET HIM TO
[1:03:19] ACKNOWLEDGE WHO HE WAS? NO. The first
[1:03:21] thing he did was get him to acknowledge
[1:03:23] that Jesus Christ,
[1:03:25] Amen,
[1:03:25] IS THE SON OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:03:27] COME ON, YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO, BUT
[1:03:29] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THIS PROPHET DID
[1:03:31] BEFORE HE WENT ANYWHERE. BEFORE HE DID
[1:03:33] ANYTHING, HE GOT YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
[1:03:37] JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY BEGOTTEN son of
[1:03:40] the almighty God.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:43] Glory to God.
[1:03:44] I've met people, THEY SAY, "WELL, YOU
[1:03:46] ALL ARE FOLLOWING A MAN." WELL, WELL,
[1:03:47] COME ON, CHURCH. ARE WE REALLY FOLLOWING
[1:03:50] A MAN? NO.
[1:03:51] ARE WE REALLY FOLLOWING A MAN?
[1:03:52] NO.
[1:03:53] IF WE WERE FOLLOWING a man, we would
[1:03:55] hear more about the man than we do THE
[1:03:57] GOD.
[1:03:58] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:03:59] BUT I HEAR MORE ABOUT THE GOD ON THEM
[1:04:01] TAPES than I hear about the man BECAUSE
[1:04:04] IT WAS NOT NATURAL LEADERSHIP. It was
[1:04:07] spiritual leadership returning TO THE
[1:04:09] CHURCH.
[1:04:10] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:04:12] I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST is the son
[1:04:15] of God. And he commanded the chariot to
[1:04:18] stand still. And they went down both
[1:04:20] into the water, both Philillip and the
[1:04:22] unic. And he baptized him. Are y'all
[1:04:24] ready for this? Go ahead. And when they
[1:04:26] were come up out of the water, the
[1:04:28] spirit of THE LORD CALLED AWAY PHILILLIP
[1:04:31] that the unic SAW HIM NO MORE. THAT'S
[1:04:33] RIGHT.
[1:04:33] AND he went on his way rejoicing. THAT'S
[1:04:36] RIGHT.
[1:04:36] IN OTHER WORDS, PHILILLIP HAD TO
[1:04:38] DECREASE.
[1:04:40] COME ON. AMEN. PHILIP HAD TO DECREASE.
[1:04:43] And the one that HE INTRODUCED THE UNIT
[1:04:45] TO HAD TO INCREASE. OH CHURCH OF THE
[1:04:48] LIVING GOD, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT HOUR
[1:04:51] YOU'RE LIVING IN? HEY, WILLIAM BRANDHAM
[1:04:53] INTRODUCED US TO JESUS CHRIST, THE SON
[1:04:57] OF GOD. HE FINISHED THE SEALS AND SAID,
[1:05:00] "I HAVE NOW INTRODUCED TO YOU THE ALL
[1:05:02] AND ALL. HE IS NOW HERE. NOW I MUST
[1:05:06] DECREASE AND HE MUST INCREASE."
[1:05:10] WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME TO SHOUT ALOUD.
[1:05:13] I THINK IT'S TIME TO REJOICE. I THINK
[1:05:15] IT'S TIME TO PRAISE GOD. WE'RE NOT
[1:05:18] FOLLOWING A MAN. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE
[1:05:20] SPIRIT OF TRUTH THAT HAS RETURNED IN
[1:05:22] THIS GENERATION TO LIBERATE US FROM THE
[1:05:25] SPIRIT OF ERROR AND TO COME BACK TO THE
[1:05:28] SPIRIT of truth.
[1:05:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:31] I'M NOT A CRAZY MAN. I GOT CARRIED AWAY
[1:05:33] IN THE SPIRIT.
[1:05:34] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:05:38] I MUST DECREASE.
[1:05:40] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:40] AND HE MUST INCREASE. YES, MY FRIEND.
[1:05:43] THE ONE YOU JUST MET
[1:05:45] HAS GOT TO BECOME THE PREEMINENT ONE.
[1:05:47] THE ONE I JUST INTRODUCED YOU TO HAS GOT
[1:05:50] TO BECOME THE FOCUS OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:05:52] THE ONE I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT. HAS GOT
[1:05:54] TO BECOME YOUR LORD. HE'S GOT TO BECOME
[1:05:57] YOUR SAVIOR. WELL, SPOKEN WORD
[1:05:59] TABERNACLE. MAY I SAY THIS? IT'S TIME TO
[1:06:02] LET JESUS CHRIST BECOME THE PREEMINENT
[1:06:05] ONE. In our singing, IN OUR PREACHING,
[1:06:08] IN OUR TEACHING, IN OUR WORSHIP, IN OUR
[1:06:11] PRAYERS, IN OUR FAITH.
[1:06:12] AMEN.
[1:06:13] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:15] LET JESUS, LET JESUS INCREASE.
[1:06:19] PREACH.
[1:06:21] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:06:22] I MUST DECREASE.
[1:06:25] And he MUST INCREASE.
[1:06:28] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:06:30] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:06:31] NOW TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:06:32] NOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
[1:06:34] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:06:34] THAT ETHIOPIAN unic got in the spirit
[1:06:37] and the prophet OF GOD SAID THAT JOHN
[1:06:39] WAS IN THE SPIRIT SIR
[1:06:40] TO RECEIVE TREMENDOUS REVELATION
[1:06:43] THAT WAS FRESH FROM JESUS.
[1:06:45] HE SAID THEN WE need to be in the
[1:06:47] spirit.
[1:06:48] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:06:48] TO UNDERSTAND the revelation that God
[1:06:51] has given us to live by in his word.
[1:06:54] Amen.
[1:06:54] For it is the same spirit.
[1:06:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. SO THE SAME SPIRIT
[1:06:59] that wrote the Bible
[1:07:02] is here interpreting the Bible and is
[1:07:05] leading you into your position in that
[1:07:08] Bible. Brother said, "Look at it this
[1:07:10] way." He said, "All too many." Thank
[1:07:12] you. HE SAID, "ALL TOO MANY, they read
[1:07:15] the Bible where it says in Acts 2:38,
[1:07:18] repent and be baptized, every one of
[1:07:20] you, in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE
[1:07:22] REMISSION of sin, and you shall receive
[1:07:25] the gift OF THE HOLY GHOST." AND THEY
[1:07:26] JUST PASS RIGHT ON. SEE, THEY DON'T SEE
[1:07:29] IT. HE SAID, "BUT IF THEY SAW IT BY
[1:07:31] GETTING IN THE SPIRIT, they would know.
[1:07:34] They would know THAT IF THEY WANTED TO
[1:07:36] RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, THEY need to
[1:07:38] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:07:41] the Lord Jesus." And then GOD WOULD BE
[1:07:44] DUTY BOUND TO FULFILL HIS WORD by
[1:07:47] filling them WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEY
[1:07:49] NEVER GET in his spirit OR IT WOULD
[1:07:52] HAPPEN TO THEM EXACTLY as the word says.
[1:07:55] YES, SIR.
[1:07:56] PRAY TO GOD FOR A revelation by his
[1:07:59] spirit. That is the first step. Amen.
[1:08:02] Get in the spirit.
[1:08:03] YES, MY FRIEND.
[1:08:04] I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M HERE. I
[1:08:06] THINK IT'S TIME TO GET IN THE SPIRIT
[1:08:08] AGAIN. I THINK WE'VE SEEN ALL THE
[1:08:10] PROBLEMS. WE'VE SEEN ALL THE ISSUES.
[1:08:12] WE'VE SEEN ALL THE SITUATIONS. AND YOU
[1:08:14] KNOW WHY WE'RE SEEING THEM IS BECAUSE
[1:08:16] WE'RE TOO EARTHBOUND.
[1:08:18] AH,
[1:08:19] COME ON. WE'RE TOO EARTH BOUND.
[1:08:20] YES, SIR.
[1:08:21] COME ON. AMEN. AMEN. WE'RE TOO
[1:08:23] EARTHBOUND. It's either one or two
[1:08:25] things. We're too earthbound OR WE'RE
[1:08:27] TOO BACKSLID.
[1:08:28] AH, PREACH.
[1:08:30] BECAUSE IF YOU WAS IN A REAL REVIVAL,
[1:08:33] LISTEN. AMEN. THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT'S
[1:08:35] HAPPENING NOW WAS HAPPENING WHEN YOU
[1:08:37] FIRST GOT SAVED. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU
[1:08:39] WERE SO IN LOVE WITH JESUS. THAT'S NONE
[1:08:41] OF THE PROBLEMS GOT YOUR ATTENTION. NONE
[1:08:43] OF THE GOSSIP GOT YOUR EAR. NONE OF THE
[1:08:45] SITUATIONS CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION. HEY,
[1:08:47] BUT YOU GOT OUT OF REVIVAL. I SAY, BUT
[1:08:50] OH GOD, COME IN OUR MIDST TONIGHT AND
[1:08:52] CARRY US AWAY IN THE SPIRIT AND LET US
[1:08:54] SEE YOU IN THE REVELATION OF YOUR WORD
[1:08:57] as declared BY THE PROPHET OF THIS
[1:08:59] GENERATION.
[1:09:00] GET IN THE SPIRIT, CHURCH.
[1:09:02] YES, SIR.
[1:09:04] LET ME JUST USE ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION.
[1:09:06] SUPPOSE YOU NEED HEALING. WHAT DOES THE
[1:09:08] WORD SAY? WELL, WE'VE ALL READ IT
[1:09:10] COUNTLESS TIMES, BUT DID NOT get in the
[1:09:13] spirit when reading it.
[1:09:14] That's it.
[1:09:16] Did we ask GOD FOR HIS SPIRIT TO TEACH
[1:09:19] US?
[1:09:20] OH, NOW WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE. SO, WE'RE
[1:09:23] NOT JUST ASKING FOR THE SPIRIT TO EXCITE
[1:09:25] US OR TO EMOTIONALIZE US. WE'RE ASKING
[1:09:28] FOR THE SPIRIT TO TEACH US
[1:09:31] THE REAL TRUTH OF IT.
[1:09:33] AMEN. AMEN. BROTHER KELLY, THE SPIRIT
[1:09:36] HAS RETURNED TO THE CHURCH TO DO MORE
[1:09:39] THAN JUST MAKE US SHOUT, TO DO MORE THAN
[1:09:41] JUST MAKE US DANCE, TO DO MORE THAN JUST
[1:09:44] MAKE US PROPHESY OR SPEAK IN TONGUES.
[1:09:46] WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTAL BABIES OR EAGLES.
[1:09:50] WE'RE SEE JEANS OF GOD. AND THE SPIRIT
[1:09:53] HAS RETURNED TO TEACH US THE WORD.
[1:09:55] YES, MY BROTHER. GLORY.
[1:09:58] NOW, Y'ALL KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
[1:10:02] YOU ALL KNOW I'M TELLING the truth. The
[1:10:04] spirit has returned to teach us the
[1:10:06] word. Now, if we did, WE WOULD CALL THE
[1:10:09] ELDERS, CONFESS OUR SINS, be anointed
[1:10:12] AND PRAYED FOR, AND THAT WOULD be that.
[1:10:14] It might not come immediately, BUT IN
[1:10:16] HIS SPIRIT.
[1:10:16] YES, SIR.
[1:10:17] COME ON, CHURCH. IN HIS SPIRIT, IT'S ALL
[1:10:20] OVER. DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU COULD
[1:10:22] STILL BE SICK AND BODY, BUT OH, GOD, BUT
[1:10:25] GET IN THE SPIRIT AND IT'D ALL BE OVER.
[1:10:28] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:10:31] COME ON, CHURCH. YES, SIR. YOU COULD
[1:10:33] STILL BE SICK IN THE BODY. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:10:35] THE SYMPTOMS STILL BE THERE. BUT YOU
[1:10:37] COULD GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT.
[1:10:39] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:10:40] HALLELUJAH. YOU COULD GET SO CARRIED
[1:10:42] AWAY IN THE SPIRIT THAT THE SYMPTOMS
[1:10:44] COULDN'T BOTHER YOU.
[1:10:46] AMEN.
[1:10:47] I feel good.
[1:10:48] YES, YOU GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE
[1:10:51] SPIRIT THAT THE ISSUES DON'T BOTHER YOU.
[1:10:54] YOU GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT
[1:10:56] THAT THE CHATTER CHATTER CHATTER DON'T
[1:10:58] BOTHER YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[1:11:00] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING. YOU MET
[1:11:03] JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, AND YOU'RE
[1:11:06] REJOICING.
[1:11:07] GLORY,
[1:11:09] GLORY.
[1:11:10] THERE'S NO OTHER COURT OF APPEAL.
[1:11:12] There's no other court of appeal. GOD
[1:11:15] WILL FULFILL HIS WORD.
[1:11:16] THAT'S IT.
[1:11:17] OH, HE SAYS we need to get in the spirit
[1:11:21] and then things will be done. Don't go
[1:11:24] through the acts first,
[1:11:26] but get in the spirit and then go
[1:11:28] through the acts and then watch what God
[1:11:31] will do.
[1:11:32] My goodness.
[1:11:34] My goodness. Amen. NOW WATCH WHEN A
[1:11:36] PROPHET WHEN HE COMES AMONG us and
[1:11:38] begins to take these BOOKS OF THE BIBLE
[1:11:40] AND BEGINS to teach us. Look how that he
[1:11:42] approaches the book of Revelation in the
[1:11:44] church ages. HE SAID, "YOU WILL RECALL
[1:11:46] THAT I MENTIONED at the beginning of
[1:11:48] this message that this book we're
[1:11:50] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:11:53] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:11:56] in the future ages." THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:11:58] BUT THEN I MENTIONED THAT IT TAKES THE
[1:12:00] HOLY SPIRIT to give us revelation or
[1:12:03] we'll fail to get it. Bringing these two
[1:12:05] thoughts together, you will see that it
[1:12:07] won't take just ordinary study and
[1:12:10] thinking to make THIS BOOK REAL. NO SIR.
[1:12:12] NO SIR.
[1:12:13] ORDINARY STUDYING AND THINKING WILL NOT
[1:12:16] MAKE THIS BOOK REAL.
[1:12:17] NO SIR.
[1:12:18] IT IS GOING TO TAKE THE OPERATION
[1:12:21] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:12:22] THAT MEANS THIS BOOK CANNOT BE revealed
[1:12:25] to anyone but a special CLASS OF PEOPLE.
[1:12:28] AMEN.
[1:12:29] COME ON CHURCH. WE BELIEVE IN THE
[1:12:31] OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE FIRST
[1:12:34] POOL. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:12:34] WE BELIEVE IN IT IN THE SECOND POOL. BUT
[1:12:37] YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE STOPPED WAS WHEN
[1:12:39] IT COME TO THE THIRD POOL BECAUSE THE
[1:12:41] FLESHLY MANIFESTATION AND THE SPIRIT
[1:12:44] REALM MANIFESTATION WAS NOT OPERATING IN
[1:12:46] THE THIRD POOL LIKE IT WAS IN THE FIRST
[1:12:48] AND SECOND POOL. BUT CAN I SAY THIS? THE
[1:12:51] OPERATION of the third pool was A
[1:12:54] GREATER OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAN
[1:12:56] THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL.
[1:12:58] YES SIR.
[1:12:58] YES MY BROTHER.
[1:13:00] YES SIR.
[1:13:01] BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE ONE WITH PROPHETIC
[1:13:03] INSIGHT.
[1:13:04] THAT'S IT. IT WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY
[1:13:06] TO HEAR FROM GOD. IT WILL REQUIRE
[1:13:09] SUPERNATURAL INSTRUCTION, NOT JUST A
[1:13:11] STUDENT COMPARING VERSE WITH VERSE. BUT
[1:13:14] THAT IS GOOD. AMEN. AMEN. I'm I'm just
[1:13:17] now getting to my FOUNDATION POINT.
[1:13:19] BUT A PROPHET SAYS THIS. WILL YOU HEAR
[1:13:21] THIS?
[1:13:22] But a mystery REQUIRES THE TEACHING OF
[1:13:26] THE SPIRIT OR IT NEVER BECOMES CLEAR.
[1:13:29] NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. IT REQUIRES
[1:13:33] THE TEACHING OF THE SPIRIT OR IT NEVER
[1:13:37] BECOMES CLEAR. NOW, NOW, NOW I'M GOING
[1:13:39] TO SAY SOMETHING IF THAT'S OKAY. TAKE
[1:13:40] YOUR TIME.
[1:13:41] PEOPLE HAVE DISMISSED TEACHING
[1:13:43] BECAUSE OF UNANED TEACHING.
[1:13:45] THAT'S IT.
[1:13:47] WELL, WE DON'T NEED TEACHING. WE DON'T
[1:13:49] NEED TEACHING. AND I TELL YOU WHY THEY
[1:13:51] DON'T THINK WE NEED TEACHING IS BECAUSE
[1:13:53] WHAT HAPPENED, AMEN, IS EVER SIXOOT
[1:13:55] ICICLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A BIT OF
[1:13:57] ANOINTING INVADED A PULPIT AND WE CALLED
[1:13:59] HIM A TEACHER.
[1:14:01] PREACH TO MY BROTHER.
[1:14:02] BUT I'LL SAY THIS, I BELIEVE IN BIBLE
[1:14:04] TEACHING.
[1:14:05] BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH SOMETHING,
[1:14:07] MAKE SURE THERE'S SOME ANOINTING ON IT.
[1:14:11] Make sure there's some dynamics.
[1:14:14] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:14:16] MAKE SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO LAY THE
[1:14:17] MECHANICS OUT, WHEN THE DYNAMICS COME,
[1:14:20] THERE'S SOMETHING TO STRIKE THE
[1:14:22] DYNAMICS.
[1:14:22] THAT'S IT.
[1:14:23] ALL RIGHT.
[1:14:24] ALL RIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. YOUR PASTOR HERE
[1:14:27] IS A VERY A very a very student of this
[1:14:30] message. I've heard some of HIS SERMONS
[1:14:32] AND HOW HE LAYS THINGS OUT AND HOW HE
[1:14:34] DIGS INTO things and HOW HE TEACHES
[1:14:36] THINGS. SERVICE IN AND SERVICE OUT,
[1:14:37] RIGHT? AMEN. Can I SAY THIS? I CAN TELL
[1:14:40] THAT'S A HOLY GHOST GIFT OF TEACHING.
[1:14:44] BECAUSE WHEN I COME IN AND BEGIN TO
[1:14:46] PREACH THE WORD, AMEN. THE FIRE IS NOT
[1:14:49] FALLING ON DEAD WOOD.
[1:14:51] BUT THERE'S SOME MECHANICS LAYING THERE
[1:14:54] THAT WHEN THE DYNAMICS BEGINS TO STRIKE
[1:14:56] IT, THERE IS A SPIRITUAL CONFESSION AND
[1:14:59] THERE'S A PRAISE AND A SPONTANEOUS
[1:15:01] PRAISE AND FAITH BEGINS TO RAISE. YOU
[1:15:04] KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY, GOD FORBID WE
[1:15:07] EVER CLOSE THE DOOR ON THE ANOINTED
[1:15:10] TEACHING OF THIS MESSAGE.
[1:15:11] PREACH.
[1:15:14] PREACH.
[1:15:15] I KNOW WHAT PREACH.
[1:15:18] I KNOW WHAT GUYS DO. THEY SAY, "WELL, WE
[1:15:20] DON'T NEED NO TEACHING BECAUSE WE DON'T
[1:15:21] NEED NO TEACHING BECAUSE TEACHING DOES
[1:15:23] AWAY WITH ALTAR CALLS AND TEACHING DOES
[1:15:25] AWAY with prayer lines and teaching DOES
[1:15:27] AWAY WITH EMOTION." NO. IF YOU'RE
[1:15:28] TEACHING THIS MESSAGE, WHEN the rain
[1:15:31] begins TO FALL,
[1:15:33] COME ON. IF THERE'S A LATTER RAIN, THERE
[1:15:36] HAD TO BE A FORMER RAIN. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:15:38] AND THE FORMER RAIN WAS A TEACHING RAIN.
[1:15:40] THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THE LATTER RAIN WAS A
[1:15:43] HARVEST RAIN. AND WHEN THE HARVEST RAIN
[1:15:46] BEGINS TO FALL ON THE SEED, IF IT'S GOOD
[1:15:49] SEED, IT'LL BRING FORTH A GOOD CROP.
[1:15:52] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:15:53] HALLELUJAH,
[1:15:54] PREACHER.
[1:15:55] GLORY TO GOD. I SAY GET BACK IN THE
[1:15:57] BOOKS. BREAK OPEN THE TAPES AND START
[1:16:00] TEACHING AGAIN WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT.
[1:16:02] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:16:04] WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTALS. WE'RE MESSAGE
[1:16:07] BELIEVERS.
[1:16:09] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:16:11] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:16:13] PREACH.
[1:16:14] TEACH THE MYSTERIES.
[1:16:15] YES, SIR.
[1:16:17] PREACH.
[1:16:17] BUT MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GET DONE
[1:16:19] TEACHING, IT'S STILL NOT A MYSTERY.
[1:16:20] THAT'S IT.
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:24] GLORY.
[1:16:25] TEACH THE PARABLES.
[1:16:27] BUT MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GET DONE TEACHING
[1:16:29] THEM, IT'S NOT STILL A PARABLE. BUT MAKE
[1:16:32] SURE THE SPIRIT HAS COME IN THE CHURCH
[1:16:35] BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT THERE'S A
[1:16:37] REALITY.
[1:16:38] YES, MY BROTHER. WE OUGHT TO PREACH THE
[1:16:40] SEVENTH SEAL SO WE CAN SHOUT DOWN THE
[1:16:43] AISLE. WE OUGHT TO PREACH THE THIRD SO
[1:16:45] WE CAN'T STAY IN OUR SEATS. WE OUGHT TO
[1:16:47] PREACH THIS MESSAGE UNTIL THERE'S A FIRE
[1:16:50] IN EVERY HEART.
[1:16:51] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:16:52] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:16:53] GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL GOOD IN THE HOUSE
[1:16:55] OF GOD. I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER.
[1:16:58] WOO. GLORY. I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER. I
[1:17:02] BELIEVE WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT.
[1:17:04] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:05] PREACH.
[1:17:06] And I BELIEVE IT OUGHT TO BE TAUGHT.
[1:17:08] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:10] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:17:12] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:17:13] WE NEED TO HEAR FROM GOD.
[1:17:16] YES, SIR.
[1:17:17] AND LAY OURSELVES OPEN.
[1:17:19] YES, SIR.
[1:17:20] AND BECOME YIELDED.
[1:17:22] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:24] SOMEBODY SAY YIELDED.
[1:17:25] YIELDED
[1:17:26] TO THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:17:27] YES, SIR.
[1:17:28] AND KNOW.
[1:17:29] YES, SIR.
[1:17:30] NOW, you all have to agree.
[1:17:32] Uhhuh.
[1:17:33] The spirit.
[1:17:34] Yes, sir.
[1:17:34] IS THE AUTHOR
[1:17:35] YES, SIR.
[1:17:36] OF THIS BIBLE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:17:39] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:41] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:42] SO, THAT means this Bible
[1:17:44] Uhhuh.
[1:17:45] is more than a book.
[1:17:46] Amen. Amen. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:17:49] CAN I SAY THIS TO YOU?
[1:17:50] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:17:50] IT'S BECOME OUR BREAD.
[1:17:52] AMEN.
[1:17:53] WHICH IS OUR STRENGTH.
[1:17:55] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:17:56] SEE, OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM THE WORD.
[1:18:00] AMEN.
[1:18:01] NOW, IF YOU MISS A NATURAL MEAL, it will
[1:18:04] affect YOUR NATURAL BODY. THAT'S EXACTLY
[1:18:06] RIGHT.
[1:18:07] BUT IF YOU MISS A SPIRITUAL MEAL,
[1:18:08] THAT'S IT.
[1:18:09] IT WILL AFFECT THE SPIRITUAL BODY.
[1:18:11] MISS THAT ONE.
[1:18:11] SEE, BECAUSE THE BIBLE
[1:18:14] IS GOD'S SPIRITUAL DIET.
[1:18:16] THAT'S IT.
[1:18:16] THEN HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU CAN STAY HOME
[1:18:19] AND BE JUST AS GOOD A CHRISTIAN AS YOU
[1:18:21] WOULD BE AT CHURCH.
[1:18:22] UH-UH.
[1:18:23] NO, SIR.
[1:18:24] LET'S SAY WHAT THE PROPHET SAID.
[1:18:26] YOU JUST can't do it.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:30] Read the word. The Holy Spirit FEEDS ON
[1:18:33] THE WORD.
[1:18:34] YES. THE BIBLE IS GOD'S SPIRITUAL DIET.
[1:18:37] YES, SIR.
[1:18:37] FOR HIS CHURCH.
[1:18:38] YES, LORD.
[1:18:39] AND THE HOLY SPIRIT is the one who
[1:18:41] brings it TO YOU.
[1:18:42] YES, SIR.
[1:18:43] AND PLACES IT IN THE HEART. YES, SIR.
[1:18:45] AND with thanksgiving, YOU WATER IT.
[1:18:48] YES, MY FRIEND.
[1:18:48] AND EVERY DIVINE PROMISE WILL PRODUCE
[1:18:51] EXACTLY WHAT GOD SAID IT WOULD DO. IT'S
[1:18:55] GOT to his word AND IT'S LIFE.
[1:18:58] YES, MY FRIEND.
[1:18:58] SEE, THEN WE MUST, SOMEBODY SAY, WE
[1:19:00] MUST.
[1:19:00] WE MUST,
[1:19:01] WE MUST KEEP FEEDING ON THE WORD. THAT'S
[1:19:04] EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:19:05] BUT CAN I SAY THIS?
[1:19:06] YES, SIR.
[1:19:07] WE MUST KEEP FEEDING ON THE REVEALED
[1:19:09] ONE.
[1:19:10] [Laughter]
[1:19:13] PREACH.
[1:19:14] THERE'S 900 DENOMINATIONS. AND BROTHER
[1:19:17] ABEL, THEY'RE EVERYONE HEADED FOR
[1:19:18] TRIBULATION. THAT'S IT.
[1:19:19] AND THEY'RE HOLDING THE SAME BIBLE
[1:19:21] YOU'RE HOLDING.
[1:19:21] THAT'S IT.
[1:19:22] BUT IN THE END TIME, THAT'S IT.
[1:19:24] THAT JOSHUA WOULD COME AMONG THE CHURCH.
[1:19:26] AND HE WOULD OPEN THE WORD AND HE WOULD
[1:19:28] BEGIN TO POSITIONALLY PLACE YOU AND SAY,
[1:19:31] "LISTEN, CHRIST IS THE PREEMINENT ONE IN
[1:19:34] EVERY VERSE.
[1:19:35] AND IF YOU DON'T FIND CHRIST, GO BACK
[1:19:38] AND READ IT AGAIN AND HE WOULD RELEASE
[1:19:40] TO YOU REVELATION THAT WOULD PUT
[1:19:43] STRENGTH ON YOU TO FLY ABOVE."
[1:19:45] THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
[1:19:47] COME ON. THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT HEADED FOR
[1:19:50] TRIBULATION. WE HAVE GOT A FOOD THAT IS
[1:19:53] CAUSING US TO BYPASS.
[1:19:55] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:19:57] THE TRIBULATION. CAN I SAY THIS? AMEN.
[1:19:59] WE'RE CLOSER TO OUR CHANGE NOW
[1:20:01] THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN.
[1:20:03] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:20:04] AND THE CLOSER WE GET,
[1:20:06] THE HARDER THE BATTLE GETS.
[1:20:08] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:20:10] THE CLOSER TO THE TIME, THE HARDER,
[1:20:13] AMEN. THE BATTLE GETS. BUT CAN I SAY
[1:20:15] THIS?
[1:20:16] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:20:17] PRESS ON.
[1:20:18] YES, SIR.
[1:20:19] PRESS ON.
[1:20:20] YES, SIR.
[1:20:20] I SAID PRESS ON.
[1:20:22] YES, SIR.
[1:20:22] PRESS ON OVER DISCIPLINE.
[1:20:24] YES, SIR. PRESS ON OVER
[1:20:25] MISUNDERSTANDING. PRESS ON BAD HARD
[1:20:28] DAYS. PRESS ON BEYOND SICK DAYS. AMEN.
[1:20:32] YOU GOT TO KEEP ON PRESSING.
[1:20:34] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:20:35] YOU GOT TO KEEP ON PRESSING.
[1:20:36] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:20:37] SEE, THE BATTLE RIGHT now is between the
[1:20:40] OUTWARD MAN.
[1:20:41] THAT'S IT.
[1:20:42] THAT IS PERISHING.
[1:20:43] THAT'S IT.
[1:20:44] BUT THE INWARD MAN, YES, SIR.
[1:20:46] IS GETTING STRONGER.
[1:20:47] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:20:48] COME ON, CHURCH. THE outward man is
[1:20:51] living on the SPIRIT OF ERROR. THAT'S
[1:20:53] IT.
[1:20:54] THAT'S IT.
[1:20:55] NOW, LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU.
[1:20:56] YES, SIR.
[1:20:57] SCIENCE, EDUCATION.
[1:20:59] YES, SIR.
[1:21:00] YES, SIR. YES.
[1:21:01] COME ON. AMEN. AMEN. CHEMICAL FOODS AND
[1:21:05] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:21:07] I'M NOT I'M NOT GETTING ALL THAT. ARE
[1:21:09] YOU WITH ME, SCIENCE? AMEN. THE SPIRIT
[1:21:11] OF ERROR. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:21:12] COME ON, CHURCH. YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THE
[1:21:14] SPIRIT OF TRUTH WHEN THEY TELL YOU TO
[1:21:16] EAT EGGS one day and not to eat EGGS THE
[1:21:18] NEXT.
[1:21:20] THE SPIRIT OF ERROR,
[1:21:22] THAT'S RIGHT,
[1:21:22] HAS BECOME THE INFLUENCE OVER THIS BODY.
[1:21:25] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:21:26] BUT THERE'S AN INWARD MAN.
[1:21:28] YES, SIR.
[1:21:28] AND HE IS RENEWED. YES, SIR.
[1:21:30] DAY BY DAY. CAN I SAY THIS? THE INWARD
[1:21:33] MAN IS STRONGER THAN THE OUTWARD MAN.
[1:21:37] THAT'S IT.
[1:21:37] THERE IS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE OUTWARD
[1:21:40] MAN OF THE FLESH AND SPIRIT. BUT THE
[1:21:43] INWARD MAN IS A SOUL. YES, SIR. AND THE
[1:21:45] FLESH RECOGNIZES THAT THE SOUL is
[1:21:49] feeding on the word THAT HAS THE POWER
[1:21:52] OF TRANSFORMATION.
[1:21:53] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:21:55] YOUR SOUL SIR REALIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING
[1:21:58] SIR. COME ON CHURCH. YOUR FLESH. IT
[1:22:02] REALIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE
[1:22:04] SERVICES. YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE MIND
[1:22:07] OF A MAN. NO SIR.
[1:22:09] YOU ARE FEEDING ON THE UNFAILING BODY
[1:22:12] WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:22:15] YOUR FLESH RECOGNIZES THAT.
[1:22:17] YES, SIR.
[1:22:18] BECAUSE YOUR FLESH DIDN'T WANT TO COME
[1:22:20] TONIGHT. YOUR FLESH WAS TOO TIRED TO
[1:22:22] SING. YOUR FLESH WAS TOO TIRED TO
[1:22:24] PRAISE. BUT LOOK AT YOUR FLESH RIGHT
[1:22:26] NOW.
[1:22:29] RIGHT HERE.
[1:22:29] YOUR FLESH HAS HAD TO COME SUBJECT TO
[1:22:32] THE FOOD OF REVELATION AND YOU GOT
[1:22:36] CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT.
[1:22:37] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:22:40] OH MERCY. The spirit
[1:22:44] OF TRUTH
[1:22:45] WILL LEAD BY THE WORD.
[1:22:47] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:22:48] SOMEBODY SAY BY THE WORD.
[1:22:49] BY THE WORD.
[1:22:50] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH.
[1:22:52] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
[1:22:53] WILL LEAD
[1:22:53] WILL LEAD
[1:22:54] BY THE WORD
[1:22:55] BY THE WORD.
[1:22:56] THIS BODY
[1:22:57] THIS BODY
[1:22:58] TO A RAPTURE
[1:22:58] TO THE RAPTURE. TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:23:02] [Applause]
[1:23:04] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
[1:23:06] YES, SIR.
[1:23:06] WILL LEAD
[1:23:07] YES, SIR.
[1:23:08] BY THE WORD.
[1:23:09] YES, MY BROTHER. THIS BODY
[1:23:11] THIS BODY
[1:23:11] TO THE FULLNESS
[1:23:12] TO THE FULLNESS
[1:23:13] OF ADOPTION
[1:23:14] OF ADOPTION.
[1:23:17] GLORY.
[1:23:18] WE ARE WAITING YES, SIR.
[1:23:20] FOR THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION.
[1:23:21] YES, SIR.
[1:23:22] CAN I MAKE A STATEMENT?
[1:23:23] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:23:24] WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR ADOPTION.
[1:23:26] WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FULLNESS OF
[1:23:28] ADOPTION. AMEN.
[1:23:29] THAT WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN AT THE FIRST
[1:23:32] RESURRECTION WHEN our bodies will BE
[1:23:34] CHANGED FROM THESE VILE CREATURES. WE
[1:23:37] ARE AND WILL HAVE A BODY LIKE HIS OWN
[1:23:40] GLORIOUS BODY. For we shall see him as
[1:23:44] he is.
[1:23:44] YES, SIR.
[1:23:45] OH MY. YES, SIR.
[1:23:46] AND WE WILL BE LIKE HIM. WHEN HE
[1:23:48] APPEARS, we appear IN HIS LIKENESS.
[1:23:52] WE WILL HAVE A BODY LIKE HIS. A
[1:23:55] GLORIOUS, GLORIFIED BODY. AND ALL THE
[1:23:58] TRIALS AND ALL THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE
[1:24:02] WILL FADE OFF INTO A LITTLE MIST AND
[1:24:05] BLOW AWAY TO NEVER be no more.
[1:24:10] AMEN.
[1:24:11] GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S WHY THE FLESH HATES
[1:24:14] THIS MESSAGE IS BECAUSE THIS FLESH IS
[1:24:17] GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL MY
[1:24:20] WORSHIP.
[1:24:21] AMEN.
[1:24:24] THIS FLESH IS GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY
[1:24:27] TO GIVE ME MIND BATTLES. THIS FLESH IS
[1:24:30] GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY.
[1:24:32] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:24:33] I'M TALKING ABOUT A WORD THAT'S BEEN
[1:24:36] REVEALED AND IT'S COME TO US BY THE
[1:24:39] SPIRIT OF TRUTH. AMEN.
[1:24:41] AND OUR BODIES WILL BE CHANGED. OUR SOUL
[1:24:44] IS GOING TO MATCH OUR BODIES.
[1:24:46] YES, SIR.
[1:24:47] I'M NOT A CRAZY MAN. MY FLESH MY FLESH
[1:24:51] HATES IT. THAT'S IT.
[1:24:52] BUT HE CAN'T STOP IT.
[1:24:53] THAT'S IT.
[1:24:55] THAT'S IT.
[1:24:56] THAT'S IT.
[1:24:57] MY SOUL.
[1:24:59] YES, SIR.
[1:25:01] YES, SIR.
[1:25:02] YES, my brother.

[1:25:32] AMEN.

[1:25:45] TABERNACLES
[1:25:46] WHICH WE NOW GROWN IN.
[1:25:48] WE'RE waiting for the salvation fully in
[1:25:52] its FULLNESS TO COME.
[1:25:53] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:25:54] BUT NOW,
[1:25:55] YES, SIR.
[1:25:56] IN THESE TABERNACLES OF CLAY,
[1:25:58] WE HAVE SOMETHING.
[1:26:00] THAT'S IT.
[1:26:01] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:26:02] WE HAVE SOMETHING.

[1:26:11] YES, MY BROTHER. SO WE'RE NOT UNDER THE
[1:26:13] SPIRIT OF BONDAGE AGAIN TO FEAR SIR.
[1:26:15] BROTHER STEVEN, WE HAVE RAISED ABOVE SIR
[1:26:19] A PENTECOSTALISM ANOINTING.
[1:26:22] WE HAVE SOMETHING IN US. YES, SIR.
[1:26:25] THAT TELLS US WE'VE COME UP SO FAR.
[1:26:28] WHAT IS THE EARNEST? IT'S THE LITTLE
[1:26:30] DOWN PAYMENT
[1:26:32] THAT HOLDS IT. SEE, ONCE we loved the
[1:26:34] THINGS OF THE WORLD, ONCE WE SINNED AND
[1:26:37] WENT OUT ABOUT DOING things of the WORLD
[1:26:39] AND CARED NOT FOR GOD,
[1:26:41] we were alienated FROM HIM. THAT'S
[1:26:43] RIGHT.
[1:26:43] WITHOUT GOD, WITHOUT Christ in THE
[1:26:46] WORLD, SIR.
[1:26:48] BUT NOW,
[1:26:49] GOD SENT HIS HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:26:51] YES, SIR.
[1:26:52] And through that, we are lifted up above
[1:26:55] those things.
[1:26:56] AND NOW WE HAVE THE EARNEST that we have
[1:26:59] passed FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE. THAT'S
[1:27:02] EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:27:03] COME ON, CHURCH. RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE
[1:27:06] POSSESSING THE REVELATION OF JESUS
[1:27:08] CHRIST.
[1:27:09] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:27:11] IN YOUR SOUL, SIR.
[1:27:12] AND THAT REVELATION IS LEADING YOU TO
[1:27:15] BELIEVE AND HAVE GONE AS HIGH.
[1:27:18] YES, SIR.
[1:27:19] I'VE GONE AS HIGH AS JUSTIFICATION, BUT
[1:27:22] I'VE GONE HIGHER. I'VE GONE TO
[1:27:24] SANCTIFICATION, BUT I'VE GONE HIGHER.
[1:27:27] I'VE GONE TO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:27:29] GHOST, BUT BROTHER ZACH, I'VE GOT TO GO
[1:27:31] HIGHER THEN. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO?
[1:27:34] I'M GOING TO GO TO THE ADOPTION. I'M
[1:27:36] GOING TO GO TO THE WORD MADE FLESH IN
[1:27:40] THE ADOPTED SONS OF GOD.
[1:27:42] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:27:44] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:27:46] BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP THERE. I'M
[1:27:48] GOING TO CLIMB ON UP. I'M GOING TO CLIMB
[1:27:51] ON UP SOME MORNING BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9.
[1:27:55] I'M GOING TO CLIMB ON UP INTO THE
[1:27:58] FULLNESS OF MY ADOPTION AND MY BODY IS
[1:28:01] GOING TO MATCH MY SOUL.
[1:28:04] YES.
[1:28:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:06] YES.
[1:28:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:08] PREACH.
[1:28:10] PREACH.
[1:28:10] NOW,
[1:28:11] glory to God.
[1:28:12] I'm just GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.
[1:28:13] UH-HUH.
[1:28:14] THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE,
[1:28:16] a big ONE
[1:28:17] IN A CHURCH MEMBER
[1:28:18] UHHUH.
[1:28:19] AND A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN.
[1:28:20] THAT'S IT. PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "A man
[1:28:23] that's born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD LOVES
[1:28:26] TO GO TO CHURCH."
[1:28:27] PREACH,
[1:28:29] PREACH, PREACH
[1:28:31] BETTER
[1:28:32] better than he loves to eat his dinner
[1:28:35] WHEN HE'S HUNGRY.
[1:28:36] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:28:38] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:28:40] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:28:42] THE SPIRITUAL MAN,
[1:28:44] YES, SIR,
[1:28:44] ON THE INSIDE HAS GOT TO BE FED. YES.
[1:28:48] IF THAT MAN ISN'T FED, HE WILL DIE.
[1:28:51] THAT'S IT.
[1:28:52] IF THE OUTWARD man isn't fed, HE WILL
[1:28:54] DIE.
[1:28:55] SO, THE inward man has got TO BE FED.
[1:28:57] YES, SIR.
[1:28:58] THE BIBLE SAID THAT JESUS told Satan in
[1:29:00] his debate. HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN THAT
[1:29:03] MAN SHALL not live by bread alone, but
[1:29:05] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:29:08] MOUTH OF GOD." THAT'S HOW MAN LIVES, NOT
[1:29:11] BY HIS BREAD ALONE, BUT BY THE word of
[1:29:14] God. Man lives. Yes, my brother.
[1:29:17] ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
[1:29:18] THE OUTWARD man lives by bread, but his
[1:29:21] inward man lives by the bread of God.
[1:29:24] Amen.
[1:29:25] CAN I SAY THIS? THE OUTWARD MAN IS
[1:29:27] SATISFIED JUST BEING A CHURCH MEMBER.
[1:29:30] BUT THE INWARD man is unsatisfied until
[1:29:33] EVERY PULSATION IN HIS HEART IS JESUS
[1:29:37] CHRIST.
[1:29:37] YES, SIR.
[1:29:39] NOW, now what are you saying? AND I'M
[1:29:41] GOING TO JUST PREACH FOR A SECOND
[1:29:42] BECAUSE IN LUKE 24, Jesus spoke of THE
[1:29:46] PROMISE OF MY FATHER.
[1:29:47] YES, SIR.
[1:29:48] WHICH WAS MANIFESTED IN ACTS THE 2
[1:29:51] CHAPTER. YES, SIR.
[1:29:52] ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, SIR,
[1:29:54] WHEN THE HOLY GHOST CAME SAID, "NOT GO
[1:29:57] AND JOIN this and go and join that or go
[1:29:59] and join this one." Wait till the power
[1:30:01] comes FROM ON HIGH. HOW LONG? UNTIL ONE
[1:30:05] DAY, TWO DAYS. Wait until DON'T TAKE
[1:30:08] SOME LITTLE EMOTION. NO SIR. NO SIR.
[1:30:11] Or some little frustration.
[1:30:13] Wait there until you are dead and buried
[1:30:18] and born again a new in Christ Jesus.
[1:30:21] And every PULSATION OF YOUR LIFE REACH
[1:30:24] OUT JESUS CHRIST. TILL YOU can see the
[1:30:27] life of Christ reflected right IN YOUR
[1:30:30] LIVING THE WAY YOU GO. Yes sir. Till you
[1:30:34] can find that power like that they had
[1:30:36] back there in the beginning.
[1:30:38] Amen. Amen. AMEN.
[1:30:39] BROTHER BRANDON IS PREACHING A SERMON
[1:30:41] CALLED Return and Jubilee.
[1:30:43] Yes, sir.
[1:30:44] And he says these words. He says, "BACK
[1:30:46] TO A PENTECOSTAL INHERITANCE." YES, SIR.
[1:30:50] THAT'S YOUR POSSESSION.
[1:30:52] YES, SIR.
[1:30:53] DENOMINATION IS NOT YOUR POSSESSION.
[1:30:55] NO, SIR.
[1:30:56] PENTECOST.
[1:30:57] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:30:59] PENTECOST,
[1:31:00] TAKE YOUR TIME,
[1:31:00] IS YOUR POSSESSION, NOT A PENTECOSTAL
[1:31:04] ORGANIZATION.
[1:31:05] YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF SUCH A THING.
[1:31:08] ALL
[1:31:09] RIGHT.
[1:31:10] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:31:12] YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF GUESSING WHEN
[1:31:14] IT COMES TO DISCERNMENT.
[1:31:15] THAT'S IT.
[1:31:17] THAT'S IT.
[1:31:18] YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF FEELINGS AND
[1:31:21] SENSATIONS. AND OH, I SEE YOU'VE BEEN
[1:31:23] THROUGH SOMETHING. OH, I see God's GOING
[1:31:25] TO USE YOU. OH, I SEE THERE'S A
[1:31:27] BLESSING. OH, I SEE. OH, YOU SEE? AMEN.
[1:31:30] I SEE IT. AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S
[1:31:32] PENTECOSTALISM.
[1:31:33] YES, MY BROTHER. COME BACK TO THE
[1:31:35] PENTECOSTAL INHERITANCE.
[1:31:38] PREACH.
[1:31:39] PREACH.
[1:31:39] I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M THIS CLOSE
[1:31:41] TO IT.
[1:31:42] WE WILL NOT FOLLOW A JANICE AND JAMBERS
[1:31:45] IMPERSONATION.
[1:31:48] You can BEAT ME. YOU CAN CANCEL ME. YOU
[1:31:50] CAN RIDICULE ME. YOU CAN CALL ME WHAT
[1:31:52] YOU WANT TO, BUT I WILL NEVER BOW MY
[1:31:55] KNEE TO SOME CHEAP REPRODUCTION OF THE
[1:31:58] MESSIAH SIGN WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THE
[1:32:00] SPIRIT OF TRUTH.
[1:32:02] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH HAS RETURNED TO THE
[1:32:05] CHURCH.
[1:32:08] COME ON, CHURCH. COME ON. COME ON. YOU
[1:32:11] BETTER STAY WITH THE WORD.
[1:32:13] THAT'S IT.
[1:32:13] YOU BETTER TAKE IT BY THE WORD.
[1:32:15] THAT'S IT.
[1:32:16] COME ON, ABEL. YOU AND I'S ABOUT THE
[1:32:19] SAME AGE. AMEN. AMEN. Got kids now, so
[1:32:21] probably classified as old men. BUT YOU
[1:32:23] KNOW WHAT, BUDDY? I REMEMBER THE DAY
[1:32:24] WHEN WE USED TO CHECK THINGS BY THE
[1:32:26] MESSAGE.
[1:32:27] THAT'S IT.
[1:32:28] REMEMBER REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO CHECK
[1:32:29] THINGS? WE WOULDN'T JUST LET THINGS GO
[1:32:31] BY. WE'D SAY, "WELL, A PROPHET DIDN'T
[1:32:33] TEACH THAT. A PROPHET TAUGHT THIS." BUT
[1:32:36] NOW WE JUST OPEN THE DOOR
[1:32:38] AND SAY, "COME ON IN. IT'S BROTHER SO
[1:32:40] AND SO OR THIS CHURCH." WELL, YOU KNOW
[1:32:42] WHAT THIS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
[1:32:46] YOU KNOW WHAT THIS COUNTRY BOY FROM THE
[1:32:48] HEELS OF EAST TENNESSEE WILL NOT DO? I
[1:32:50] WILL NOT BOW MY KNEE TO ANY SPIRIT OR
[1:32:54] SENSATION OR GIFT OR VISION OR TONGUES
[1:32:58] OR ANYTHING APART FROM WHAT A PROPHET
[1:33:00] TAUGHT. I'VE GOT TO GO. I'VE GOT TO GO
[1:33:04] TO THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION.
[1:33:06] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:33:10] GLORY,
[1:33:11] BROTHER STEPHEN. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T go
[1:33:14] back. I CAN'T GO BACK TO LIVING BY SOME
[1:33:16] GIFTED PREACHER WHO SAW SOMETHING. I
[1:33:19] CAN'T GO BACK TO LIVING BY GIFTS.
[1:33:21] I CAN'T GO BACK TO LIVING BY ONE DAY I
[1:33:23] FEEL GOOD AND THE NEXT DAY I DON'T FEEL
[1:33:25] GOOD.
[1:33:26] I GOT TO STAY.
[1:33:27] STAY.
[1:33:28] I GOT TO STAY.
[1:33:29] STAY, MY BROTHER.
[1:33:29] UNDER THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH.
[1:33:31] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:33:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:35] PRAISE GOD.
[1:33:36] SHOOT ME.
[1:33:36] YES, SIR.
[1:33:37] STAB ME.
[1:33:38] KILL ME.
[1:33:40] I WILL NOT BACK OFF.
[1:33:41] AMEN.
[1:33:42] OF WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT.
[1:33:43] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:33:46] PREACH.
[1:33:48] GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[1:33:50] SO, DON'T YOU REDUCE ACTS TWO.
[1:33:52] NO, NO, NO, NO.
[1:33:53] And this Messiah word.
[1:33:55] Uhhuh.
[1:33:55] OH, GOD.
[1:33:56] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:33:58] SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, I TELL YOU ONE
[1:33:59] THING, brother Andrew." Amen. We ain't
[1:34:01] THEM PENTECOSTALS CUZ WE WE ACKNOWLEDGE
[1:34:03] GOD SENT A PROPHET. WELL, YOU KNOW, I
[1:34:05] JUST SAY THIS. IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE GOD
[1:34:06] SENT A PROPHET, then say what he said
[1:34:08] sometime.
[1:34:12] IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE GOD SENT A PROPHET OR
[1:34:15] QUIT RAISING YOUR IDEA ABOVE IT AND JUST
[1:34:17] SAY WHAT HE SAID. THAT'S IT.
[1:34:20] SAY WHAT
[1:34:21] I'M GOING TO PREACH ON IT ONE DAY. JUST
[1:34:22] SAY WHAT HE SAID.
[1:34:23] SAY WHAT HE SAID.
[1:34:24] LISTEN, I KNOW THIS MAY NOT BE
[1:34:26] POLITICALLY CORRECT, but it's going out
[1:34:27] there anyhow. IF YOU AIN'T GOING TO SAY
[1:34:29] WHAT A PROPHET SAID, THEN SIT DOWN AND
[1:34:31] SHUT UP. AND THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE THAT
[1:34:33] WILL.
[1:34:34] WE GOT TO GO, CHURCH. THE WORLD IS
[1:34:37] HEADED TO TRIBULATION, BUT THERE'S A
[1:34:39] CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A CHANGE AND
[1:34:43] IT'S COMING UPON MY SOUL AND THE ONLY
[1:34:45] THING THAT'S GOING TO LEAD ME TO THE
[1:34:46] FULLNESS OF ADOPTION IS THE SPIRIT OF
[1:34:49] TRUTH.
[1:34:50] PRAISE GOD.
[1:34:51] PRAISE GOD.
[1:34:53] PRAISE GOD.
[1:34:54] I'M SORRY.
[1:34:56] I CAN'T STAY IN ERROR.
[1:34:58] I CAN'T STAY IN FEELINGS. I CAN'T STAY
[1:35:00] IN EMOTIONS. I GOT TO STAY UNDER THE
[1:35:02] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:35:03] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:35:05] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:35:07] HALLELUJAH.

[1:35:28] is your possession.
[1:35:31] That's it.

[1:35:57] THE PENTECOSTAL EXPERIENCE RIGHT THERE
[1:36:00] IS THE WORD.
[1:36:01] YES, SIR.

[1:36:10] ARE THE BRIDE. YES, SIR. AND IF YOU ARE
[1:36:12] THE BRIDE, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A MATE.
[1:36:15] YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A HUSBAND. AND THE
[1:36:18] PROPHET OF GOD SAID YOUR MATE IS THE
[1:36:21] REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR.
[1:36:26] THEN IF YOU COME THROUGH JUSTIFICATION
[1:36:28] AND YOU GOT OVER IN SANCTIFICATION AND
[1:36:31] YOU GOT A DIP IN THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:36:33] GHOST, THAT MADE WAY FOR THE WORD
[1:36:36] ITSELF.
[1:36:39] TO COME DOWN IN PERFECTION.
[1:36:42] THAT I CAN STAND HERE TODAY AND SAY WHO
[1:36:45] HE CALLED, HE JUSTIFIED.
[1:36:47] YES, SIR.
[1:36:48] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:36:51] I wish I was a preacher right now. AND
[1:36:53] WHO HE JUSTIFIED, HE SANCTIFIED.
[1:36:56] YES, SIR.
[1:36:56] AND WHO HE SANCTIFIED, HE PREDESTINATED.
[1:36:59] AND WHO HE PREDESTINATED, HE ALREADY
[1:37:02] GLORIFIED.

[1:38:14] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:16] THAT PENTECOSTAL EXPERIENCE IS NOT IN

[1:39:50] SAY? HE SAID THE MYSTERY WOULD BE MADE
[1:39:53] CLEAR
[1:39:54] BY THE SPIRIT'S TEACHING.
[1:39:56] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:39:57] THEY READ THE BOOK OF JOHN 14 for years
[1:40:00] WHERE HE SAID, "BECAUSE I LIVE, YE LIVE
[1:40:03] ALSO." AND THEY TRIED TO PUT EVERYBODY
[1:40:05] IN THERE THEY COULD. But one day a
[1:40:07] prophet come along who was underneath
[1:40:10] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH.
[1:40:12] AND HE SAID, "BECAUSE I LIVE."
[1:40:15] WELL, brother Manny, LET ME JUST SAY ALL
[1:40:16] OF IT. WHAT A RESURRECTION THAT WAS. AND
[1:40:20] WHAT A RESURRECTION this is to be

[1:40:37] YES, SIR.
[1:40:39] YE LIVE ALSO.
[1:40:42] AND A PROPHET GOD IN THE SPIRIT.
[1:40:43] HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:44] AND HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. YES, SIR. HE
[1:40:46] WAS speaking to HIS WIFE.
[1:40:50] AMEN.
[1:40:52] AMEN.
[1:40:55] NOW, DO YOU SEE WHY I CAN'T LEAVE THIS
[1:40:57] WORD?
[1:40:59] I AM THE WORD.

[1:41:02] AMEN.
[1:41:05] HE IS MY HUSBAND.
[1:41:06] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.

[1:41:09] AMEN.
[1:41:10] I AM THE WORD.
[1:41:11] AMEN.
[1:41:12] MADE FLESH.
[1:41:13] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:41:15] PREACH, MY BROTHER.
[1:41:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:17] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:41:18] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:19] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:41:20] WHAT IS IT?
[1:41:21] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:41:21] IT'S THE TOKEN.
[1:41:23] It's the CONFIRMATION OF HIS WORD.
[1:41:25] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:41:25] LISTEN, FRIENDS, THIS TOKEN LIFE IS NOT
[1:41:28] COMING UP on church members.
[1:41:29] Oh, glory to God.
[1:41:31] This token life is coming up on born
[1:41:33] again Christians.
[1:41:34] Yes, sir.
[1:41:34] And they are displaying the reality.
[1:41:36] YES, SIR.
[1:41:37] Of the power,
[1:41:38] Yes, sir.
[1:41:39] OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST.

[1:41:41] BUT SAID IN THE TOKEN, it displays his
[1:41:43] power.
[1:41:43] Take your time. John 14:12.
[1:41:46] See, under the blood where there is no
[1:41:49] condemnation,
[1:41:50] that's it.
[1:41:50] The life it took for the blood. See, the
[1:41:54] blood was applied
[1:41:55] and the life could not come on the
[1:41:57] believer then
[1:41:58] for the life of an animal.
[1:41:59] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:42:00] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:42:01] TAKE YOUR TIME.
[1:42:01] DO YOU SEE WHY YOU GOT TO BE A WORD
[1:42:03] BRIDE?
[1:42:04] IS BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT receive any
[1:42:06] other life
[1:42:08] outside of word life.
[1:42:09] Amen.
[1:42:12] But we see instead of a human being,
[1:42:15] it was a super super super human being.
[1:42:18] THAT'S IT.
[1:42:19] AND THAT makes the human being now, are
[1:42:21] y'all ready for this?
[1:42:22] Take your time.
[1:42:23] Come on, church. That makes the human
[1:42:25] being now not only a human being, but
[1:42:28] he's a son and daughter of God. Yes,
[1:42:31] sir.
[1:42:31] Of the super super super life that was
[1:42:35] in him. Amen.

[1:49:36] the power
[1:49:38] of transformation.
[1:49:41] We have been changed.
[1:49:43] from the spirit of bondage again to
[1:49:45] fear.

[1:49:54] Y'all ever seen a butterfly?

[1:50:14] He had to eat his way
[1:50:17] out of a cocoon,
[1:50:19] out of a caterpillar
[1:50:21] into a butterfly.
[1:50:23] Everything that's in the butterfly was

[1:51:27] He said, "When I was a caterpillar," he
[1:51:29] said, "Take your time."
[1:51:29] He said, "When I was a caterpillar, I
[1:51:31] almost got stepped on."
[1:51:34] He said, "I got stepped over. Uh-huh.

[1:51:56] HE SAID I LOOKED UP AT HIM AND I SAID,

[1:54:57] YES, MY BROTHER.
[1:54:58] You sing that song. The Bible is right
[1:55:01] and somebody's wrong.
[1:55:03] I done told you once, told you twice.
[1:55:06] Won't make it to heaven
[1:55:08] with a sweetheart and a wife.
[1:55:11] Well, I got quiet on that one.
[1:55:13] Then told you once, told you twice. You
[1:55:16] won't make it to heaven smoking dope.
[1:55:20] Bible's right.
[1:55:22] I'm feeling good tonight.
[1:55:23] Yes, my brother.
[1:55:25] The Bible's right.
[1:55:26] The Bible is right.
[1:55:28] And the same Holy Ghost that fell on the
[1:55:30] day of Pentecost, which we all know that
[1:55:33] was the birth of the new church.
[1:55:34] Yes, sir.
[1:55:35] If that same Holy Spirit don't bring the
[1:55:38] same experience to you,
[1:55:40] then you got a different Holy Spirit
[1:55:41] than what was exactly right. if it don't
[1:55:45] make you live a sacrificial life.
[1:55:47] Amen.
[1:55:49] Amen.
[1:55:50] A life full of joy and pleasure.
[1:55:52] Amen.
[1:55:53] Are you ready for this?
[1:55:54] And the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:57] leading you into signs and wonders and
[1:55:59] miracles and things. There's something
[1:56:01] happened. That's
[1:56:02] because Jesus said, "These signs shall
[1:56:05] follow them."
[1:56:06] Amen.
[1:56:07] That amen.
[1:56:09] Amen.
[1:56:10] Living
[1:56:12] a sacrificial life.
[1:56:13] Yes. My brother,
[1:56:15] stay right there.
[1:56:16] Full of joy.
[1:56:19] Yes, sir.
[1:56:19] Pleasure.
[1:56:20] Yes.
[1:56:21] The baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:56:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:25] I'll pick it up another time.
[1:56:26] Part two.
[1:56:28] Listen, church.
[1:56:29] Yes, sir.
[1:56:30] Sometimes
[1:56:31] if you're going to live in joy,
[1:56:33] you got to make a sacrifice.
[1:56:35] Amen.
[1:56:36] Stay right there, my brother.
[1:56:37] Sometimes.
[1:56:38] Yes, sir.
[1:56:38] If you're going to walk in what a
[1:56:40] prophet taught
[1:56:40] Uhhuh.
[1:56:41] you got to sacrifice. That's exactly the
[1:56:44] truth.
[1:56:44] And I'm just going to say it.
[1:56:45] Take your time.
[1:56:46] The only way to live a sacrificial life,
[1:56:50] that's it.
[1:56:50] Is to lay your ideas,
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:53] your thoughts,
[1:56:54] Amen.
[1:56:54] your directions,
[1:56:56] Amen.
[1:56:56] on the altar.
[1:56:57] Amen.
[1:56:58] And be consumed.
[1:57:00] Yes, sir.
[1:57:01] By the spirit of truth.
[1:57:02] Amen.
[1:57:04] Amen.
[1:57:05] Listen, friends.
[1:57:05] Amen.
[1:57:06] It's time.
[1:57:07] Yes, sir.
[1:57:08] To go home.
[1:57:09] Amen.
[1:57:10] It's time to take a body change. Yes,
[1:57:11] sir.
[1:57:12] It's time to go to the fullness.
[1:57:15] Amen.
[1:57:16] Of adoption.
[1:57:17] Yes, my brother.
[1:57:18] We're not waiting on adoption.
[1:57:19] No.
[1:57:20] Spiritual leadership.
[1:57:22] Yes, sir.
[1:57:22] Unto adoption.
[1:57:23] Yes, sir.
[1:57:24] How many can say, "I was like that guy
[1:57:26] in the in the chariot
[1:57:28] and the spirit come by one day."
[1:57:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:57:32] I was reading Malachi 4 and Revelation
[1:57:34] 10 and
[1:57:35] John 13 and 14 and 15 and 16, Romans 8,
[1:57:39] Romans 7.
[1:57:41] I was reading all these scriptures
[1:57:43] getting nothing.
[1:57:44] And get nothing.
[1:57:45] But one day,
[1:57:47] hallelujah,
[1:57:47] the seed comes through the body.
[1:57:49] Amen.
[1:57:51] Amen.
[1:57:51] And the spirit got me carried away.
[1:57:53] Amen.
[1:57:54] Introduced me to the Jesus of the Bible.
[1:57:58] And I met him.
[1:57:59] Hallelujah. And he said, "Now I've
[1:58:01] introduced you to Christ."
[1:58:02] Amen.
[1:58:03] Now I must decrease.
[1:58:04] Amen.
[1:58:05] And he must increase.
[1:58:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:07] 50 years ago, we was preaching a
[1:58:08] prophet. They were preaching a prophet.
[1:58:10] God sent in a prophet. God sent a
[1:58:11] prophet. God sent a prophet. God sent in
[1:58:12] a prophet. Hunting stories, testimonies.
[1:58:14] Today,
[1:58:15] but today,
[1:58:16] today,
[1:58:17] there's a people
[1:58:18] that has not gi up their Pentecostal
[1:58:20] possession.
[1:58:21] That's the problem.
[1:58:22] They have become the word made flesh.
[1:58:26] In them is the authority to remit sin.
[1:58:29] Yes.
[1:58:30] In them is the power.
[1:58:31] Amen.
[1:58:32] Come on, church.
[1:58:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:34] Prophet of God brought the mercy seat
[1:58:35] right out of heaven into the heart OF
[1:58:37] THE BRIDE.
[1:58:37] YES, SIR.
[1:58:39] YES, SIR.
[1:58:40] YES, SIR.
[1:58:41] YES, SIR.
[1:58:43] NOW,
[1:58:46] you love him tonight.
[1:58:48] The word
[1:58:50] is back in its position.
[1:58:53] Hallelujah.
[1:58:54] Mercy,
[1:58:54] yes, sir. is back in this
[1:58:56] back in the
[1:58:57] back in its rightful place.
[1:58:59] You love him tonight.
[1:59:01] Almighty God,
[1:59:02] we bow our hearts before you tonight,
[1:59:04] Lord.
[1:59:06] Father, the word is just so
[1:59:08] it's so consuming. Oh God,
[1:59:10] Lord,
[1:59:11] it's so real.
[1:59:13] It's so true.
[1:59:15] Lord, I know it may have come across
[1:59:16] strong tonight,
[1:59:18] but Father, I believe if there's ever
[1:59:20] been a time to lay and say what a
[1:59:22] prophet said,
[1:59:22] Amen. into the church.
[1:59:25] It's right now,
[1:59:27] Lord. We're hearing the message.
[1:59:29] We're watching the pillar of fire.
[1:59:32] We're watching the spirit of truth.
[1:59:35] Lord, men of God are laying in their
[1:59:37] studies, in their offices, laying in
[1:59:39] these tapes, reading these books,
[1:59:41] listening, Lord, to these words, Coleman
[1:59:44] through this Bible.
[1:59:47] Oh God, your word
[1:59:49] tying things together.
[1:59:52] Bringing bread to the table,
[1:59:54] not for the outward man,
[1:59:56] but for the inward man.
[1:59:58] Lord, the other day as I just sat
[2:00:00] pondering, just thinking how that you
[2:00:03] look at so many churches, denominational
[2:00:05] churches, full of denominational goers,
[2:00:08] church members, denominational goers as
[2:00:10] your prophet called them. Lord, they
[2:00:13] boast about coffee in the lobby and
[2:00:16] donuts and soup suppers or meals or food
[2:00:21] or Lord even now just the other day
[2:00:24] reading where a church has got it set up
[2:00:26] now in the pews where they can have a
[2:00:27] little table and put their coffee and
[2:00:29] their breakfast on it while the preacher
[2:00:32] preaches and enjoy the service. And I
[2:00:35] thought, "Oh, God, how they've had to re
[2:00:38] how they've had to how they've had to go
[2:00:40] back. How they've had to shift, Lord, to
[2:00:43] worrying about feeding the outward man
[2:00:46] because they have nothing coming across
[2:00:48] the pullpit
[2:00:49] that will feed the inward man."
[2:00:51] That's right.
[2:00:52] So Lord, the outward man is renewed
[2:00:54] Sunday after Sunday or Sunday every now
[2:00:56] and again or Sunday every time they go
[2:00:59] and hear a little lecture sermonet.
[2:01:02] But the inward man is starving.
[2:01:05] But Lord, we come over into this word
[2:01:06] that you've sinned. Oh God,
[2:01:08] Lord, the outward man is perishing.
[2:01:11] But Lord, we're so thankful because
[2:01:13] there's a food on the table.
[2:01:15] The seven seals are open.
[2:01:18] The word is on the table. It's a seven
[2:01:20] course meal.
[2:01:21] And the inward man is feeding on the
[2:01:23] revelation, the knowledge,
[2:01:25] the understanding, the clarity. Oh God.
[2:01:28] Lord, I want to say it like this tonight
[2:01:30] as I had it on my heart to get to but
[2:01:32] didn't get there tonight. The spirit has
[2:01:35] come in the church
[2:01:37] and the spirit is now the teacher.
[2:01:40] And the spirit is teaching the seals.
[2:01:43] The spirit is teaching the godhead.
[2:01:46] The spirit is teaching the mysteries.
[2:01:49] And Lord, we're so thankful it's now the
[2:01:51] spirit teaching
[2:01:52] because we seen what man done when they
[2:01:54] taught.
[2:01:55] That's right. When they got done, it was
[2:01:56] more of a mystery, more dry, more
[2:01:59] intellectual.
[2:02:01] But Lord, we thank you for Holy Ghost
[2:02:03] filled teachers.
[2:02:04] Lord, they won't get up and spit and
[2:02:06] stomp and sweat and run around like I
[2:02:08] do. Lord, that's not their calling. But
[2:02:11] Lord, they'll stand there under the
[2:02:12] anointing and they'll place this and
[2:02:14] place that. And Lord, that anointed
[2:02:16] teaching will fall right in the hearts
[2:02:18] of the people.
[2:02:19] And then Lord, you'll send another gift
[2:02:21] of your of your five-fold ministry
[2:02:23] through. Amen.
[2:02:24] And Lord, I won't have time to stand
[2:02:26] here and read all the quotes and
[2:02:27] scriptures as the others would. But
[2:02:30] Lord, I would be able to begin to say
[2:02:31] what a prophet said. And Lord, because
[2:02:33] there was because there was octane in
[2:02:36] the gas, Lord,
[2:02:37] when the fire begins to strike it,
[2:02:40] Lord, it don't sputter.
[2:02:42] But Lord, all 16 cylinders fire Jesus
[2:02:45] Christ
[2:02:46] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:02:48] Amen.
[2:02:49] Lord, I pray you would raise up more men
[2:02:50] of God
[2:02:52] that'll lay in what a prophet taught.
[2:02:54] Amen.
[2:02:54] And Lord, they'll give their lives to
[2:02:56] lay that into the hearts of these
[2:02:57] people.
[2:02:58] Amen.
[2:02:58] Lord, they'll give their lives to teach
[2:03:00] only what a prophet taught.
[2:03:02] Say only what a prophet said.
[2:03:04] Amen.
[2:03:05] Go only where a prophet went.
[2:03:07] Amen.
[2:03:08] And Lord,
[2:03:09] lead the church
[2:03:12] by the spirit of truth.
[2:03:14] We love you tonight, Lord. Now, Father,
[2:03:17] we commit this meeting in your hands.
[2:03:20] Father, I pray the outward man,
[2:03:22] Lord, I pray the inward man would be
[2:03:24] refreshed tonight.
[2:03:25] I don't know what the outward man would
[2:03:27] be going through here tonight. Lord, you
[2:03:28] know all things, but may the inward man
[2:03:31] right now be renewed.
[2:03:33] Lord, we can't go back.
[2:03:37] We can't give up our possession.
[2:03:40] We can't We can't regress. Oh, God.
[2:03:43] We must progress. We must advance
[2:03:46] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:03:49] Can we just raise our hands to him
[2:03:51] tonight and say, "I surrender to you,
[2:03:53] Lord.
[2:03:54] I surrender all over to this message,
[2:03:56] Lord.
[2:03:58] I surrender to what a prophet taught."
[2:04:01] How many fathers could say, "I surrender
[2:04:02] my homes to this word.
[2:04:05] I want to see the evidence.
[2:04:07] I want to see the residue.
[2:04:10] I want to see the effect.
[2:04:13] I want to see the moisture. I want to
[2:04:14] see the rain, Lord.
[2:04:16] I want to see it upon the upon the
[2:04:18] lives.
[2:04:20] I want to see it, Lord.
[2:04:22] I want to see the effect of your
[2:04:23] presence, oh God.
[2:04:25] I want to see it upon my children, Lord.
[2:04:28] I want to see it upon my family, oh God.
[2:04:30] I want to see it upon my confession,
[2:04:32] Lord.
[2:04:34] I want to see the evidence of this word
[2:04:38] all over my life.
[2:04:41] Hallelujah.
[2:04:42] I want to see it in my conduct.
[2:04:45] I want to see it in my confession.
[2:04:49] You just raise your hands to him right
[2:04:50] now. Every head bowed, every eye closed.
[2:04:53] Say, "Lord,
[2:04:55] I want to see it more.
[2:04:58] I want to see my children more full of
[2:05:00] this message.
[2:05:02] I want to see them full of the Holy
[2:05:03] Ghost."
[2:05:05] Maybe you got a desire for your church
[2:05:06] here. You say, "Lord,
[2:05:08] I want to see the evidence of this
[2:05:10] message."
[2:05:11] Yes.
[2:05:12] all over the church.
[2:05:14] I want to see it sit in the young
[2:05:15] people.
[2:05:16] I want to see it in the elders. I want
[2:05:17] to see it in the officers.
[2:05:19] Yes, Lord.
[2:05:20] I want to see it in the teaching. I want
[2:05:21] to see it in the preaching.
[2:05:22] Yes, Lord.
[2:05:23] Lord, I want to see the evidence.
[2:05:26] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:05:27] How many can say, "Lord, I see the
[2:05:29] evidence.
[2:05:31] I see the evidence.
[2:05:33] I see the evidence that you're the
[2:05:35] kinsman redeemer.
[2:05:37] I see the evidence that you're the
[2:05:38] supernatural.
[2:05:40] I see the evidence that you're the
[2:05:42] forgiver, Lord.
[2:05:43] I see the evidence that you're the
[2:05:45] sanctifier and the justifier,
[2:05:47] the perfector.
[2:05:49] I see the evidence of it
[2:05:52] in Jesus name.
[2:05:54] God bless you tonight, friends.
[2:05:57] Would you lead us in something?
[2:06:01] Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] Remember us in prayer, we'll be praying
[2:06:05] for you all
[2:06:06] till we meet again.
[2:06:08] Amen.
[2:06:08] Shalom. God bless you.
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:32] Amen. Praise God.
[2:06:35] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[2:06:41] Hallelujah.
[2:06:42] Amen.
[2:06:44] Amen.
[2:06:45] Oh my. Oh my.
[2:06:48] You know, God is wonderful.
[2:06:51] Amen.
[2:06:52] God is wonderful. That's why I would
[2:06:55] never back up
[2:06:57] from where I am at.
[2:06:59] Never. If I preach something out of this
[2:07:02] Bible and out of the message, I am
[2:07:05] backing one inch.
[2:07:08] Just like he preached, the battle is
[2:07:10] getting harder.
[2:07:12] You ask the deacon knows what I go
[2:07:14] through
[2:07:16] and standing for the message now somehow
[2:07:20] will make you lose friend.
[2:07:24] It will get people away from you.
[2:07:27] But when I'm looking at the souls of the
[2:07:29] people,
[2:07:31] it's amazing when we facing demon. They
[2:07:35] real.
[2:07:37] I'm dealing with even people who are not
[2:07:40] members of this church
[2:07:42] and you're dealing with them and you see
[2:07:44] what the devil is doing in people's life
[2:07:47] and you see me standing ragged and
[2:07:49] pushing. You don't understand why I'm
[2:07:52] aggressive to the devil the way I am
[2:07:55] because I see the damages he's doing in
[2:07:59] people's life. And it takes time. It
[2:08:02] wears you down. You have to go over a
[2:08:05] lot of stuff to pull somebody from
[2:08:08] something. And people think we're too
[2:08:10] hard. And they don't understand why we
[2:08:13] avoiding certain things because of what
[2:08:17] we dealing with. We didn't grow up in a
[2:08:20] generation like this.
[2:08:22] We didn't have cell phone.
[2:08:25] To have a cell phone, it's a luxury.
[2:08:28] We grew up with television that was
[2:08:30] black and white.
[2:08:33] The television can show off I mean can
[2:08:35] be on up to a certain time and turn it
[2:08:38] off in the whole city. Nobody will watch
[2:08:41] the television at 2:00 a.m. or
[2:08:43] something.
[2:08:46] Amen. So I got my first cell phone in
[2:08:49] the United States.
[2:08:51] I saw people with cell phone
[2:08:54] but our children are not growing like
[2:08:56] that.
[2:08:57] They changing their school system. They
[2:08:59] studying on iPad. They studying on
[2:09:02] computer, cell phone all over, Tik Tok,
[2:09:06] all kind of app are downloaded every
[2:09:09] day. And how do you want me to preach
[2:09:11] the gospel?
[2:09:12] That's true.
[2:09:13] And how do you want me to stand?
[2:09:17] Amen.
[2:09:19] How do you want me to fight the devil?
[2:09:23] Because people are posting stuff. People
[2:09:25] are doing things on WhatsApp. People are
[2:09:27] doing this and this and and before you
[2:09:29] know it, something is coming. something
[2:09:31] is doing. Somebody's doing this.
[2:09:32] Somebody's do. How do you want me to
[2:09:34] fight? That's why I have been
[2:09:36] commissioned. I don't have any game.
[2:09:40] God let me go through a hard experience
[2:09:42] in the last church and I took my
[2:09:45] decision right there. I'm not playing
[2:09:47] game and I have zero tolerance
[2:09:50] when it come to this message. People may
[2:09:53] say what they want. People can go back
[2:09:56] or whatever. I'm going to stand where I
[2:09:58] stand. One of this day. Yes sir.
[2:10:01] One of this day.
[2:10:02] Amen.
[2:10:02] Some of you will understand me.
[2:10:07] Because I have people coming back to
[2:10:08] repent after years. It takes two, three
[2:10:11] years and somebody coming back and now
[2:10:13] trying to go back again to the same
[2:10:15] thing. They begin to see what we were
[2:10:17] saying. But I can't wait three years.
[2:10:20] That's true.
[2:10:21] And then you're going to get damaged and
[2:10:22] you then you turn around. You say,
[2:10:24] "Brother Stephen, you saw this. Why did
[2:10:26] you let me go? I have to do what I got
[2:10:28] to do. So after you find out that this
[2:10:31] was correct, you will love me more.
[2:10:35] Amen. Let's stand for the word.
[2:10:38] Let's stand for the message.
[2:10:40] Amen. The years of intimidation is gone.
[2:10:44] We respect the elder but sometime we
[2:10:46] have to say what we say and when we say
[2:10:49] here we're not against anyone.
[2:10:51] We're not attacking anyone. But the
[2:10:53] problem is
[2:10:56] the problem is if you doing something
[2:10:58] wrong that the message say not to do and
[2:11:01] I'm preaching about it. I'm not against
[2:11:03] you. I'm against the wrong that you're
[2:11:05] doing.
[2:11:06] So let's learn whoever is following me
[2:11:09] online to dissociate the person and the
[2:11:12] wrong.
[2:11:14] I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:11:16] I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:11:18] Let me say it a plain way. Okay? So we
[2:11:21] understand one another. If brother
[2:11:22] Brandham say don't drink beer
[2:11:24] and there is a preacher who's drinking
[2:11:26] beer, you can't forbid me from reading
[2:11:29] the quote
[2:11:30] that say do not drink be and when I read
[2:11:34] those quote I will strike it to kill.
[2:11:39] I don't know if you understanding me.
[2:11:41] When I strike when I shoot it's to kill
[2:11:44] because I'm not playing with devil. And
[2:11:45] when I'm SHOOTING IF YOU PART OF it you
[2:11:48] better leave that beer alone. But don't
[2:11:51] make a personal issue between me and you
[2:11:54] because I'm preaching something.
[2:11:57] That's exactly.
[2:11:58] So whoever listen, whoever take my tape
[2:12:00] and put it on TikTok or just let this be
[2:12:03] clear,
[2:12:05] you can't forbid me. If I read
[2:12:06] something, it's going to strike preacher
[2:12:08] so and so. If I read something, so they
[2:12:10] better go back to the word.
[2:12:14] Then if we go back to the word, when we
[2:12:16] preach, we will be striking devils.
[2:12:18] But you can't be standing on something
[2:12:20] that is against the word and you are
[2:12:22] blocking us to even preach against it.
[2:12:25] When we have souls of people in our
[2:12:27] hand,
[2:12:28] I am backing up.
[2:12:31] If I'm too strong, there are many
[2:12:32] pastors. But I will stand because I
[2:12:35] can't play game. At the end of the day,
[2:12:38] you going to find out that this word is
[2:12:41] true. I told somebody I said there is
[2:12:43] nothing in this church that I have
[2:12:45] placed without using a scripture in the
[2:12:47] court.
[2:12:48] Whether the office everything are you
[2:12:50] because I know the devil will come
[2:12:52] and I want the devil to find you
[2:12:54] standing on the word and when you
[2:12:56] standing on the word it is written
[2:12:59] there is nothing that the devil will do.
[2:13:01] Amen. We're not against we're not
[2:13:03] wrestling against flesh and blood. It's
[2:13:05] principalities.
[2:13:08] If you have high heel I preach against
[2:13:10] high heel. If you take the high heel off
[2:13:12] and you put a normal heel and tomorrow I
[2:13:14] come back I say leave the high heel.
[2:13:16] Does he affect you?
[2:13:17] No.
[2:13:18] Is it a problem with you? But you don't
[2:13:20] want to leave a high heel. You want me
[2:13:21] to stop preaching about high heel? Then
[2:13:23] he turned to be personal. I'm sorry my
[2:13:25] friend. You're going to put it as
[2:13:27] personal as you want. But I won't quit.
[2:13:30] I will shoot it until that heel is
[2:13:32] burned
[2:13:34] and you get to a flat heel.
[2:13:39] Amen. Amen. So we understand one
[2:13:43] another.
[2:13:44] Let's give preeminence to the word.
[2:13:46] We have a lot to thank God.
[2:13:50] Get in the spirit. Stay in the spirit.
[2:13:53] Being caught up in a spirit and it's
[2:13:56] going to take the weariness off.
[2:13:59] Your mental state is very important.
[2:14:02] If your spirit is already seeing the
[2:14:04] vision of something, it will one day I
[2:14:07] will show you what it does. You can make
[2:14:10] a business fall by your attitude
[2:14:12] or you can make a business go through
[2:14:14] headache because the owner is still
[2:14:17] keeping the faith.
[2:14:19] You can get your marriage if the owner
[2:14:21] if the one in a marriage still keep
[2:14:23] faith.
[2:14:24] Amen. That marriage can go through
[2:14:26] rustle and the marriage still stand. If
[2:14:28] you just lose faith, the laws of nature
[2:14:31] understand
[2:14:32] and they come against you. That's
[2:14:34] exactly right.
[2:14:37] This is how things work spiritually. It
[2:14:39] works in everything.
[2:14:41] That's why it's important for the one
[2:14:43] who standing on the pulpit on the vision
[2:14:46] to keep the faith.
[2:14:47] And the only way is back to the word.
[2:14:50] Hallelujah.
[2:14:51] Amen.
[2:14:52] God richly bless you.
[2:14:54] May God protect you. All is well. Stay
[2:14:57] in the spirit. Get caught up in the
[2:14:59] things of the spirit and the Holy Spirit
[2:15:01] himself will lead you. God bless you,
[2:15:04] brother S.
