congratulations amen amen we're moving on pretty good our question and answer will be on August the 24th and young men's meeting will be on August the 10th and the Young sisters we need a final touch on September the 21st right but I got a problem with the married people amen they say brother Stephen four years you deal with the younger one you forget about the married people I didn't forget about you the problem is I'm dealing with two category there is a category in war those that are married and there is a category fixing to go to war so I had to attend to those that have not gotten into the into the ground yet to make sure they are fully equipped so by the time they get there I'm not going to have a lot of phone calls that's right that's right amen amen so the pool is so strong sir that we don't have any choice we got to have a married coule [Applause] [Laughter] meeting do me a favor make sure you there can you say amen amen because I won't release the tip we clear am so make sure you there I'm going to work with the Deacon to come up with a date and I will put it in the church group chat and you vote quickly on the date and make sure you can make it I don't think what we trying to cover will go in one session it might take probably three or four session I'm going to give you the title of the session of what we will be dealing with amen you pray about it amen you know usually men don't go to the doctor sir even though they sick they will try taleno they try Advil they try everything they don't want to go to the doctor they might have insurance for 10 years they don't want to go to the doctor it's only women that have a tendency to seek for help but it doesn't mean that men are okay so meaning I'm not going to follow your facial expression the first subject we will be dealing with the first one is your spiritual life we already we are we already dealt with and we will continue to deal with you every time you come to church that one is covered here what we will trying to deal with it now is sexuality yes can you say Amen let me use your word intimacy Amen in this subject I will try to answer the question on birth control we got three two classes of people in this message some say no we got the quot some say yes we got the coat we need to sit down and take the yes quat and the no coat and the scripture and put it together amen the message has been divided in two classes we got the calvinist in this message and we got the Armenians Armenians are the legalist in this message and those two classes have influenced all our Behavior that's right brother all our life all our marriages everything either somebody is a calvinist a calvinist let go everything that's right amen they eat everything total Grace and our minions no no no no no no no we need to find what did Brother Bram say about these things amen I know aen are going down no [Music] problem in the same subject I will try to deal with a mood and behavior amen amen because sometime we don't we we find Devils where there is no devil it is just a something physiological married people can you say Amen you will cast a devil where there is no devil you don't need to cast a devil sometime you need a box of candy can you say Amen where is my interpreter you okay can you say amen amen you're a preacher already you can say Amen even though you're not married yet but you're a preacher you can say [Applause] Amen are we together are we together amen oh you don't want it you want it so I don't know how many when we finish with this Lord's willing we get on your finances but let's deal with this first now do me a favor because I dealt with the young man the young adult and the young sister the young adult I dealt with them and I gave them 80% so Sarah W BR I gave them 80% of these things right here there was a 20% that I could not give it to them because they are not married yet remember 20% of Joseph that's what take care of the feminine are we together are we together so do me a favor I give you three weeks we okay take your questions about these things and put them in the box amen for this one time I will allow you not to put your name if you don't want to if you're not too courage don't put your name because I know somebody who say ah brother stepen no don't put your name are we together are we together anything that crosses your mind that's right put it down amen amen amen do me a favor I'm a pastor who hate political talks I don't like political talks I want to go straight to the point when you talk to me go straight to the point so don't put a question saying brother Steven you know the little bridge that is in the middle of your face tell me it's a nose that's right amen Shake somebody else hand say God bless you because we need to come up to a clear do you hear me do you hear me so when you put your question be direct are we okay do not play with word because you're going to give me a lot of headache to try to figure it out what are you trying to ask and if I don't have your name I don't know who to call to ask the the question be direct the way the question come to your mind don't put any filter I'm a doctor don't put any filter just put it exactly the way he came and write it down and put it there three weeks anything let me help you up again let me help you up again because we got sickness in this message A lot of people are sick in this message brother Bram said the sickest body that he knows of is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ it is time to deal with sicknesses in the message leave denomination alone the message already dealt with them let deal with denomination in the message are we together are we together and do me a favor even if your question is wrong amen put me the wrong question are we okay even if what you're trying to ask is wrong because it troubles you because you have a question about it put it in the Box we agree we agree amen we agree so we will take the Bible the message of the hour and science I have a quot okay and we put it together and we see what is going on are we okay do we agree so don't give me headache to figure it out your question be direct what did the pastor say direct so rather the way it come to your mind put it there it's going to help me sit down engage where we are so that whenever ever I'm going through this we will answer your questions as we're moving along so you got three weeks to meditate and fill that box if you don't do it I'm not responsible for your blood are we together I'm doing my due diligence as a pastor to make sure we take care of the married people any question so far everybody's quiet now brother Robert they quiet can you say Amen [Laughter] am what are you going to tell tell us about this again why is Peter reminding people thinks though they know them it's written in your Bible what is right what is wrong what shows you that what you're doing is right where did you get it from who train you sometime you learn it from somebody who's struggling himself and they pass on to you their fight wow and you are struggling yourself because he was handed down as a tradition we hander our marriages sometime in the traditional way according to the culture that we grow up with that's it that's it who told you it is correct where did you get it from the one who gave it to you where did they get it from were they message believer amen and we got our young couples confused that's right amen and we turn them into the internet that's it because nobody want to talk about it we turn them into Amazon buying all kind of books because no one never tackle that subject everybody is running away yet everybody's suffering amen I am Sovereign my friend I'm doing things the way the Holy Spirit leads me I hold on to this for a long time now it's time to deal with it so remember and need your question be direct don't give me any Parable there don't put there brother stepen go read that scripture do you see that scripture what do you think about don't tell me that tell me your mind say brother Stephen when I read the scripture this is what I see what do you think about it even if you wrong put it there I'm not going to read your name and I don't tell people's name even in question and answer this thing will remain with me all the way to the Rapture I'm trying to help you this message have an answer to everything there is no aspect in our life that the message of brother Bram doesn't touch the problem is we don't study we don't put our head in the word we stay superficial and we don't deal with the [Applause] things Jesus Christ brother Bram say my timer is off because you're the one slowing me down brother Bram said Jesus Christ was 100% man that's right and Jesus Christ CHR was 100% God amen amen amen this thing it's very easy to be dealt with all the time the problem is how do you handle man your body have not gotten Redemption yet you still struggling with a lot of stuff in your body that's why you need help I'm fing my marriage you not fine you came up to a contract you ended up with a treaty there was so many fight and argument in your way in your marriage until you and your husband sat down and came up to an agreement of Peace so what we see in marriages is a lot agreement of Peace in other word you know which not to push and you living with your husband as a legalistic I'm avoiding this because it's going to cause trouble that's why we have peace for 3 years it should not be like that the Peace of a marriage should come by love your wife is not afraid to make a mistake your your husband is not afraid to get you upset and if it happened that he made you upset he doesn't mean to but why do you have a husband that if I do this my wife that's not marriage that's a prison [Applause] house you want to touch something oh my husband don't want me to touch that car that's not marriage the problem is if you if you touch something and you broke it that far you didn't mean to break it and I'm not even ashamed to tell my husband I'm not even afraid to tell my husband look at the sheit on your bed when was the last time you change it don't say Amen I have something to preach amen amen look at the on your bed when was the last time they changed when was the last year say Amen when was the last year they change it it lost its luster you know what I'm talking about I don't have I ever been in your rooms so why how how am man knowing this thing do you think it's me saying that do you think it's me saying that have I sent drone to your rooms watch the same poor thing in the in the washing machine you know what I'm talking about huh because you don't have money you got money to do some other stuff to go get a fishing hook you don't remember to change that comforter say Amen have I said something wrong have I said something wrong we got treaties in messages don't touch this this one say don't touch this and we will live in peace and then everybody have their own guns and that's the way we live in marriage and then when we come in front of people we fake yes honey yes baby how are you doing but when we get to the house everybody is on their same corner until your wife is even afraid to put a hand on you that's what confus children in this message because the children never experience true marriages something that make them willing warning to be marriage because they saw the way Mommy and Daddy are treating one another and they say when I get married I want my husband to be like my daddy because my daddy always treated Mama right I want my wife to be like my mother or sometime we say I don't want my wife to be like my mother amen amen that was introduction to the marriage couple that one you get a free on YouTube it's a trail but he have not started yet amen amen if you are uncomfortable bring a mask wear a mask my friend but I'm not going to deal play game with the devil I will shoot the devil in every aspect of your life wherever I see

name of Jesus Christ amen Psalm 82 verse1 the Bible say God stands in the congregation of the M you might be seated in the congregation of the feble no sir God send in the congregation of what the mighty so the people that we talking about here are walk of people the mighty people Mighty people a Congregation of the mighty amen a Congregation of the mighty amen amen who is where is that congregation where is that church of the M God stand in the congregation of the M come he does what he judges among the gods H God judges among the who the gods so God is sitting with who God and he's judging among who God so the congregation of the m is the congregation of who God because he himself is Almighty remember the fellow and the fellows you remember the fellow and the fellow H there is a big fellow amen and they are leader fellows amen and the big fellow is Almighty and the other fellow are what the congregation of the M the congregation oh let me go with your terminal leery of the Gods amen amen God judges among the gods jump to verse six my friend the Bible say I have said who said God you are [Music] [Applause] God this book is the book of Psalm I'm already taking off the airplane okay all right this book is the book of Psalm and brother Bram says this about the book of Psalm in the approach to God brother brandom say it seems to be a beautiful outline I like David do you know the what the Psalms the psalm are not only songs but they are what prophecy did you know that so what we reading here is a prophecy amen a prophecy that God Amen is saying that ye we are gods I say that God said it clearly God said it verse six I have said in the past I have saided so somewhere God spoke I have said in the past that ye are what God and all of you no exception am there's no male and female here all of you are what children of the most high so children of God are what children of the most high Children of the most high God they are Gods amen so God have his children and when God look at the children his children he look at he say here are Gods why does God have to talk to his children about their identity on now brother amen who here have called his son and say you are human who say that oh you call your daughter you say you are a girl but God is looking at his children he say Hey Ye are God it means that those children have a problem are we together his children have a measure are we together are we together is my Bible different than your bible let me let me help you where it's coming from jum to verse seven verse seven but you shall die like what Ah that's the problem amen how can a God die God didn't say you will die like God because God himself died in the man Jesus Christ is it too strong Jesus was God two weeks ago the Bible said Jesus was the true God but Jesus was crucified they didn't kill God they killed the man Jesus Christ and God is saying here that you will die like men amen and fall like one of the what princes but even though death affect us on but God is coming back here on verse six he say you are my children and you are not just the children of somebody you are the children of the most high and I want you to know that ye are Gods so there is something having a problem with God children understanding their rightly position all the rightly given identity God children have a tendency to have amnesia that's why God said and he sent the word that ye are God even though you dying like men amen even though you get sick even though you get a headache remember you are God brother Bram say Jesus had headache the Bible say Jesus was tempted in every form but the temptation of Jesus Christ and the pain and the suffering of Jesus Christ never remove in him the fact that he was God Jesus had a time that he had to cry can you say amen he cry at the tomb of Lazarus but after a while Jesus stood up and said remove the stone Lazarus come for the crying of Jesus Christ didn't block him to express his [Applause] godship so there was a time he cried but that c crying never gave him a doubt that you know what you cry so much maybe you're not God no he cry as a man but after a while he shook himself up he said I got a vision that this man must Rise Again take the stone away he's thinking that's not my problem open this door Lazarus with your band come forth and he come forth with his band coming out of the Grave are we together are we together our godship was completely expressed in Jesus Christ showing you that you can live a life of trouble a life of pain a life of difficulty but remember you are God remember you are the children of the most high remember even if you have a headache or you have a sness issue you are God all you waiting is a little spark of Faith from God to hander that trouble are we together are we together we were dealing with the five garment and we landed on Moses and we were showing the fa garment in the life of Moses and when we were showing that we Str back a deep Revelation where God told Moses that hey Moses I want you to know me different than Abraham that's right different than Isaac you know that different than Jacob I'm going to reveal myself to you as Jehovah and the way the Theologian everybody got Jehovah is a man with his family uh-uh it took a prophet that's right to come back and say that's not really the concept of Jehovah Jehovah means god is creating a mature God we went through that before amen amen and he told Moses he said now you Moses the way you are when you go to Pharaoh you going to be God to Pharaoh Moses say hey this is too strong how is he going to believe me amen amen and God started this with Moses that's right that's why when Jesus was on the road to EMAs with the disciple the Bible say he begin to talk to them about him Beginning by Moses Moses Moses was the one that said the Lord your God will send you a prophet like me Moses are we together are we together are we together let's go to the book of act glory to God let's go to the book of act we have to recalibrate clear our brain because as long as you don't receive this truth yet it's hard for the truth to be manifested so we got to reprogram everything teach everything until you receive the teaching and the god flows into the software of the stre of the teaching amen amen amen amen we have been giv C we don't know how to drive amen amen amen I had a car when I went to to buy the car they told me you need to come here one or two hour to sit down so they can teach you how to drive that car amen and if you skip that you can still drive the car but there will be a lot of potential of that car that you don't know you may be stucking in the hill you don't know that there is a program in that car that take care of the Hill because you miss the training how many people have a cell phone here do you know everything that is loaded on your cell phone so you are operating based on the knowledge that you know but there is a lot of things you can do with your cell phone we only know the basics the picture the calling the texting but there are many things that you can do with your software how will you know if somebody don't train you are we okay let's go to act 14:8 if you thereare you can say Amen we talk about this with the faith of the Gentile the Bible say the same uh verse eight and there sat who a certain man aistra at the Gentile country who was what importent in his feet import weaken his feet being a from his mother's womb who never walk we clear this is not among Jewish people this is aistra somewhere in Greece or something amen amen and the same heard Paul speak who steadfastly Paul was preaching beholding him Paul looking at him and perceiving that he had Faith to be he Paul saw that and Paul say said with a loud voice stand up stand upright on your feet and he leaped and walk did Paul touch him no did Paul pray for him no did Paul cast out the devil who made that boy creeper was it uh God or a devil so how did that devil go normally we say in the name of Jesus Christ rise up Paul didn't say in the name of Jesus Christ Paul say Hey You There stand up under which authority and it happened amen am verse uh uh 11 and when when the people saw what Paul had done they lift up their voices saying in the speech of the laan the gods are come down to us in the likeness of [Music] what he look like the gentile people [Music] understand it look like Gentile were G somehow to easily [Music] accept God in human [Applause] flesh amen the god in the likeness in the likeness of means in the form yes that's right of a human being so when a gentile sees a miracle directly he turn he say this man is a god am but they lack the revelation of worship verse 12 and they call Barnabas Jupiter and Paul mercurious because he was a he was the chief speaker then the priest of Jupiter which was before their City brought what o and what and Garland garlanded to the gate and would have done what sacrifice with the people they even ready to worship which when the Apostle Barnabas and Paul heard of it they did what they rent their clothes and run in amongst the people crying out saying what s why do you do these things we are also what men of like passions with you like passion with you and preach to you that you should turn from the from the this vanity to the what Living God which made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all things that are what there when it comes to worship the disciple push the break they say no amen amen not about worship worship is only one man only the Lord Jesus Christ when it come to worship it's only the big fellow the almighty God Amen but when they look at they say these are Gods what I want to draw there is among the Gentile it seems to be easy to accept the idea that God can be a human being am amen let's go to act 28 glory to God hallelujah if you there you can say Amen act 28 verse1 you there very familiar story and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called what Mita and the barbarous people show us no lead kindness in other words they were very kind for they kindled a fire and re as everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold and when Paul has gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire they came up what viper out of the heat brother Bram say he was a m out of the Heat and fasted on his hand and when the bararan saw the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is what a murderer because something wrong happened to him because he can die like a man they call him a murderer for a season of time amen amen whom though he has escaped the sea yet Vengeance Justice orow allow not to leave and Paul Paul he shook off the Beast you see it's called a beast never play with brother Bram when he say something when brother Bram say something he's always right brother Bram the prophet he's always right not the man the prophet that prophet in revelation 22 is always right amen amen amen amen and when he shook off the Beast Into the Fire and fell what no har however they look when he should have what swollen they know what comes up after this Beast hit you or what or fallen down dead suddenly but after they look for a great one somebody's watching they say this is going to sink him this trial is going to sink her with whatever she got now she can survive this trial she's going through such a hard time we seen her crying crying all night we seen her we we seen her devastating it looks like she's going to lose her mind she doesn't even know how to Bon her shirt because of too much depression after they wait for a [Music] while amen amen they look for a great one and so what no harm come to him they changed their minds and said say that he was a God so wherever you take this among the Gentile they don't have a problem understanding that God can be a human being are we together the Gentile have no problem at all brother Bram says this let me go by Daniel first in the Book of Daniel chap 2:46 the Bible says then the King Nebuchadnezzar did what fell upon his face and did what and worshiped Daniel can you verify in your Bible when Daniel interpreted the dream the king fell down and begin to worship a human being amen amen amen yes my brother I know where you are you are at the age so so we're going to worship one another that's where you are and worship Daniel and commanded that they should offer what an oblation and what and sweet odors unto him the king answered unto Daniel and said offer truth it is that your God is the god of [Applause] God and the Lord of Kings and a revealer of what secret seeing that could reveal what this secret he asked everybody nobody was able he said listen I won't even give you the dream you tell me the dream and you give the interpretation and when Daniel did it they say this is God in human flesh please bring me the stuff to worship this man and he even made an image Hallelujah unto Daniel elist gods in Melita gods in Babylon gods are we together in act chapter 10 verse 25 we find that and as Peter was coming who cornelus met met him and did what and fell down at his feet and did what and worshiped him when they told a gentile by an Angel that we're going to send Peter say pet an angel is talking about Peter so this Peter must be somebody when he saw Peter he fell down and begin to workship because Peter has been testified by an Angel but Peter did what took him up saying what stand up I'm myself also I am a what so there is a duality right there it's Men Behaving like Gods until they put people in confusion are we together amen now people have a difficulty is this God or not God Amen am amen amen amen amen we found out couple weeks ago that brother Bram said God is alone in creation he said the devil can create if you say the devil can heal then you make him what a Creator then he's what he's co-equal with God so we know that the devil is not co-equal with god with God Only God Alone can do what create the devil can only do what pervert what's already created amen and then brother Bram say you believe God is here amen you believe God is in his creation God is in his word uh-huh God is in his son amen now God where in his people everything that God was he was put it in where into Jesus Christ he was what he was co-equal with the father is that right think if not what robbery to be what equal with the father that's why Jesus say I and my father we are what are one we clear amen we clear amen we clear amen okay praise God then we saw in asaiah that the devil wanted to rise above the children of God above the mighty fellows he say I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud and I will be like the most high and he was strong down and the position he was looking for was given to the Church of laod this position was never given to Ephesus we got Ephesus we got smina we got pergamus we got tarian we got Sardis we got Philadelphia and we got laoda all along here God never promis anybody else strong amen remember before Ephesus started follow me carefully Jesus was at the cross and when he was at the cross he died and they piered him on the side are we together and water and blood came out which was talking about a birth you know this correctly after the bre amen and the spirit that came out of Jesus Christ came back on the the Ephesus Church that's right but even though that Spirit came down here nobody was promised the throne no one here no one there no one there but the last stage which is sealing the Gentile age is promised to sit with God upon the throne what Lucifer was longing for somebody's giv that position why why do we get that [Music] position we together we together amen let's keep claming my friend in the message God doesn't call men to judgment without first warning him brother Bram say I thought after having the healing service last Sunday then maybe this Sunday if we just take the what the teaching the teaching and do what and bring it right up and show what time that we are at by the bom want to teach the church what time we are at what is the what the threefold purpose of God's great plan since the foundation of what the world and bring it down to today the threefold plan of God the plan I'm working on the second part on now getting the scripture out and hunting them and doing what placing them so brother Bram say that he wants wanted to teach something to the church and what he wanted to teach the church was the threefold purpose of God in other word god before the world begin had a plan he had a plan he had a purpose and brother Bram say one of the court if you want it I can send it to you that that plan that purpose was in the back part man not the front parten so it's not a superficial thought it is a deep [Music] one are we together and what is these three Pro purpose brother Bram say notice in Christ is the mystery of God R God has had a what a threefold purpose in this great what mystery secret brother Bram called this a mystery a mystery Secret don't worry my friend keep your seat belt a mystery secret amen God in his great mystery secet that he had when before the world began he has got what a three-fold purpose in it now what we want to go upon this morning what is that three-fold purpose see now I Believe by the help of God who is present and he shall show it to us now if he has this third this three-fold purpose we we want to find out what is this three-fold purpose the first things was that God wanted to reveal himself to what the people follow me carefully brother Bram continue secondly to have what the preeminence in his body of what believer that is what his bride that he might leave what in people that's right now how could do how could do H sorry he could do that in what in Adam and Eve but what but sin separated them in other word when God created man in the Garden of Eden he wanted to accomplish something with Adam and Eve but sin interrupted the program and man never leave for a thousand year that's right amen I'm going slowly now brother Bram say so now now they had to be some way to do what to get it back again in other word whatever God started with Adam and Eve amen never reached its maturity God had a plan and he he created Adam and he created Eve and put them to express that plan but for some reason that plan was never expressed amen amen the plan was interrupted by sin and because it was interrupted by sin God had a plan B are you following me are you following me I'm going slowly God had a plan B this plan is Plan B God knew that the devil will block him from doing exactly what he wanted to do so therefore God put a backup plan that whatever the devil will destroy here he can restore it back let's continue to clam my friend brother Bram says oh my this is what Rich oh what is rich brother Bram it is riched to me just to even what think of it think about what about going back again to Adam and Eve in the age of laia right here what happened at the end of laisha The Rapture amen after the Rapture what follow three and a half year of tribulation amen then everything is destroyed then what follow there the Millennium during the three and a half half years we are in heaven in the in the wedding supper sir amen then we have to come back to start what the Millennium everybody okay Armageddon through the millennium are we together then brother Bram say see what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that why did God allow Adam and Eve to fall then he he will never be able to express his what his fullness his what his full attribute So Adam must give must open the gate so that somebody inia can repeat again what Adam and Eve I'm going slowly my friend glory to God brother Bram continue he said first he wanted to express himself how completely where God in Christ so the first plan of God is that God wanted to become [Applause] flesh I'm going slowly God wanted to become human not in portion completely kosis in other word god putting himself into Christ amen until the father and the son are [Applause] one are we together are we together let me help you up again the son is the body part amen and the one that was inside amen this is God so the god Kos pour himself into the son so the first plan of God was when men fail God said don't worry devil I know what I'm going to do since my plan is working according to the way I knew you going to work I have a backup plan number one I'm not going to remain God me God I'm going to become human are we together so the first plan was God becoming human and he did it in the Man Called Jesus Christ are we together amen God fulfilled it and Jesus was God everybody can clap hand to that congratulation God praise God congratulation we love that revelation we appreciate it God become human in other word when you touch Jesus you touching her when you see Jesus you see who God but when you give that God bread he eats and sometime that God get tired sometime as they walking maybe B can push him and they see God doing this B me stop those joke but the fullness come on come on come on come on of the godhead was in him maybe you don't get me in other word when Jesus was here heaven was empty when Jes J was here when you go to heaven if you look there is no God there you say where is God they say oh what are you coming to do here God is on the earth if you want to meet God go back over there the Jehovah of the Old Testament has become who are we together are we claming are we together are we together my friend glory to God and brother Bram say second Hallelujah to have what the the last the last what they last Adam so Adam must have a wife we together we together because we trying to go back where to the Garden of Eden So Adam have come where is his wife [Applause] Eve was [Applause] where and what did God do to Adam before he can pull if he did what and what happened to Jesus At The Cross and the peace Jesus where to pull what can I continue so the first work of God was to manifacture Adam and after Adam is manufacture he was not good for Adam to be so the second work the second purpose is to manufacture evil [Applause] [Music] are we together the second purpose is for God to have preeminence in the bread in Eve because if you want to bring people back to the Garden of Eden you must have an Adam and Eve again Adam is already formed we need Eve but Eve when Adam look at her Adam must say this is what bone of my bone and what Flesh of My Flesh so when God sees you before the Millennium you must be how bone of his bone and what and flesh of his flesh you must look like [Applause] him have I lost somebody have I lost somebody if I lost you raise your hand my friend amen no nobody we clear praise the Lord Brother Bram say until he could let me second to have what the prances by what by this in what his church which is what his body the what the bride if he could have what the preeminence to express himself what through them thirdly to do what restore the kingdom to its rightly position because when whenever Adam and Eve are completed now we can go back to the garden now to restore what the kingdom to which what rightly positioned that fell by what by sin by what the first Adam back to where he did what he walked in the call of the evening with his what his people and did what and talked with them and did what and fellowshipped with them number three to restore what the kingdom to bring the Earth back again like he was without any sin only with the devil present because in the Garden of Eden the devil was there so at the Millennium the devil must be there but this time we will teach the devil a lesson because this if doesn't fall this if is not coming as a [Applause] byproduct don't worry my friend let's continue my friend Hallelujah brother Bram says this now notice again what is his three-fold purpose to do what manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come to the body by what by Jesus Christ to have what the pinenes we seen that to what and restore what back Eden bring back to which was lost that was the only thing what out of order all the rest of the things was what was in order it was man that got out order it's a revelation it is an it is as Eternal as God's word is how Eternal look but the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is what revealed God manifested where in Christ number one God Christ manifested what the church in order to redeem the Lost what Eve back to the what original condition of what in the Garden of Eden oh my what is making this Prophet scream like that everything Trav how in a three with with who with God God is perfected in what in three first coming of Christ is to do what redeem his bride our second coming of Christ is what to receive his bride second are thirdd coming of Christ which is his BR with his brother to do what rule in the Millennium the three are redeem receive and rule in the Millennium everything is running how in a three are we together so whatever is happening to us is not Strang it is a deal between God and the devil concerning his children God want prove Satan that when I start something I will finish [Applause] it are we together are we together amen listen to this in first John chapter 3 beloved now we are what the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall what appear we shall be like what like him bre it down in other word when you see Jesus Christ amen you won't be surprised right now you have your own conception that when I see Jesus Christ how is he going to be whenever you going to see Jesus Christ when you look at yourself and you look at him you say Hey you are like me why because you and him must rule Lord help me Lord help me he said when he shall appear we shall be like who like him for we shall see him as what he is Philippians 3:20 for our conversation is where in Heaven from w we also also we look for what the Savior the Savior who the Lord Jesus Christ who shall do what change our vile body that we make be fashioned like what unto his glorious body so your body will look like his body until when Jesus look at us he will say like Adam these are Flesh of My Flesh and they are bones of my bones this one is my [Applause] wife because God can only marry God a chicken marry chicken a zebra marry zebra human marry human God marry [Applause] God oh glory to God it is so good but we going slowly my friend I don't know where the traffic is coming from Amen in needen my God lord God help me in Genesis 1 verse 26 the Bible say God say Do What let us make man how in our own image after what our likeness stop if God was making men in his own image so God must have the [Music] image and that image must be his image and God is looking at his image and his making men according to His Image and according to his likeness meaning if God have one nose that man that God is creating must have how many noses one nose Lord help me the Bible says this and let them have what dominion over the fish of the why do you want this man to dominate and over the F of what the air and over what the cattle and over what all the Earth and over what every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created who man in what his own image in the image of who God created he how him what male and female so male and female look like who [Applause] God don't worry sister say [Applause] amen amen and God did what bless them and God say unto them be what be fruitful and what and multiply and what and replenish the Earth and do what and subdue it and do what and have dominion of what the fish of the Sea of what the foul of the air of what every living thing that moveth upon the Earth why is this creature giving so much power [Laughter] hallelujah hallelujah brother BR I'm saying the message Messiah he said Isaiah 96 we just won't read it but he wants to be what the Everlasting father if Everlasting father have a child that child is how Everlasting the what the Mighty God when God made man where in genesis: 126 we just read it if you putting that scripture down what Genesis 1:26 it shows that God made man to be what a God to begin with don't worry just swallow it man was made to be what a God a what a Lesser God he was made how in the image and and what like of God he had a hands like who God he had feet like who God eyes and ears and what intelligence like [Applause] God why do you think men have a tendency to manufacture things we create iPad we create computer we create car why do we always have a to come up with new things why why did you ever seen an elephant changing a house look at the houses of a man he get one he make a better one he keep making better houses why only men why the fish is don't don't change their [Music] clothing he had feet like who God eyes and ears an intelligence like who like God he's what whole fiber because he was what a Son of God Jesus refer to him as what as God so your whole makeup is a makeup of a God I know you get sick I know you get tired but I don't have any choice but to repeat the prophet and to repeat the word though you have weaknesses don't you get tired don't you get sick but understand that your blueprint is [Applause] God you don't look like an animal if
