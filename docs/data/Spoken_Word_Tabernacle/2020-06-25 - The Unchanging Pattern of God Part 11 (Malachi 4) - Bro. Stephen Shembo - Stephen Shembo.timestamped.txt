[23:59] amen Oh bless you tonight if you have
[24:04] your Bible we can go first thing
[24:16] it was 12 to 14 but I was told later on
[24:21] that two people meet so he was 14 to 14
[24:26] so now we had people here and people at
[24:31] home so fifty-fifty
[24:33] everybody's happy for his God before we
[24:43] say the majority Wayne was 50/50 first
[24:47] Kings chapter 17 verse 1 if you dare you
[24:51] can say Amen we appreciate everybody
[24:53] this tonight and on the virtual platform
[24:59] on YouTube God richly bless you
[25:02] brother David thank you for everything
[25:04] your bishop first one and elijah the
[25:08] tishbite
[25:09] is this I'm gonna go slow brother
[25:11] Maurice you day you can let me know when
[25:14] it's time to cover and Elijah the
[25:17] Tishbite who was of the inhabitant of
[25:20] Gilad say to her air hub as the Lord God
[25:25] of Israel lives before who must stand
[25:28] there shall not be do nor rain thank you
[25:33] my brother here but according to my word
[25:38] you might be seated so on verse 1 we
[25:43] found out that the first time Elijah
[25:45] comes on the same he's bringing a curse
[25:49] on Israel and the curse he's bringing on
[25:53] Israel is specific it's a curse by
[25:57] stopping the rain from falling down on
[26:02] the nation why does the curse hit the
[26:08] rain or affect the rain why he didn't
[26:11] affect the rivers why he didn't affect
[26:13] the land while he why he didn't affect
[26:16] the wild beasts but he was very specific
[26:18] in this stage Israel already seen Israel
[26:22] left God through a hub they kill the
[26:25] Prophet they left the commandment of God
[26:27] every clock of God
[26:29] but at this stage when God send Elijah
[26:32] the prophet Elijah comes and bring a
[26:35] curse but that curse is related to the
[26:37] rain everybody clear let's job two verse
[26:41] six and the Raven brought him bread and
[26:46] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[26:49] in the evening and he drunk of the brook
[26:53] so he was said to a Brooke that Brooke
[26:55] was still having water because the curse
[26:58] just happened and he came to pass after
[27:02] a while that the book dried up there is
[27:05] on the brook dried up because there is
[27:08] no more rain so the land was affected
[27:11] but for your information it was not only
[27:15] Israel that was affected because after
[27:18] this Elijah is sent back as a dove
[27:22] easier to zurafa where there is a widow
[27:25] and when he went there we found out that
[27:27] that we do already was living under the
[27:30] curse as well so the rain did not only
[27:33] affect Israel but it affected also the
[27:37] surrounding country so everybody was
[27:39] affected by this curse or this plague
[27:42] that came upon the nation everybody did
[27:45] and it came to pass again verse 7 after
[27:49] a while that the brook dried up because
[27:51] there was no rain because they had been
[27:54] no rain in the land so the bread was
[27:57] affected the water was affected because
[28:01] there was no rain rain brings crops
[28:04] because the old civilizations were
[28:07] living by agriculture so when you stop
[28:10] the rain it's already affecting the
[28:12] economy when you affect the economy
[28:14] there is no herbs there is no weed there
[28:17] is no bread so meaning everybody is
[28:20] starving in other word famine hits him
[28:23] so by stopping the rain he opened a door
[28:27] into famine into the land everybody
[28:32] clear
[28:32] no end no crop no when there is no crop
[28:37] there is no agriculture there is no
[28:42] wheat
[28:43] no burning because there's no rain
[28:45] everybody clear let's go to the Book of
[28:47] Amos chapter 8 we are just building from
[29:00] where we stopped last time on Sunday
[29:05] Amos chapter 8 and for those that are on
[29:13] line or those that now are going to be
[29:15] with viewing later I will strongly
[29:18] encourage you if you miss a sermon
[29:21] whether it's me preaching or brother
[29:23] Mike or whoever make sure before Sunday
[29:27] you go back and you review that before
[29:30] Sunday because if we're building
[29:31] something on Wednesday you miss it on
[29:33] Sunday you might be lost trying to catch
[29:36] up everybody cleared almost chapter 8
[29:40] verse 11 the day's come saith the Lord
[29:44] God that I will send Fermin everybody
[29:48] clear there is a famine there in the
[29:52] land not a famine of bread nor thirsty
[29:58] for water when Elijah brought the curse
[30:01] into the world he brought famine that
[30:05] famine affected the bread and also
[30:10] affected the water everybody there but
[30:14] there is another prophecy that came in
[30:17] for the antrum that they will be famine
[30:21] because the Old Testament is a shadow or
[30:25] it had but in the end time there is a
[30:28] famine but the Bible is specific that it
[30:32] is not natural bread salmon everybody
[30:37] there what Israel was doing naturally
[30:40] the church is doing that in the
[30:42] spiritual everybody Gill so it's not a
[30:46] famine of bread and water but the famine
[30:51] here is about something else the Bible
[30:54] say that it's not firm enough
[30:56] not thirsty for water but of hearing the
[31:00] words of the Lord in other word there
[31:04] will be a problem or there will be a
[31:07] lack of the Word of God
[31:12] everybody clear in the end time this is
[31:16] under Elijah that's the intima
[31:19] but do we have any large idea anthem
[31:23] okay verse 12 and there shall wander
[31:28] from sea to sea and from the North even
[31:33] to the east they shall run to and fro to
[31:36] seek the word of the Lord and shall not
[31:40] find it so somebody will be looking for
[31:43] the world the vision will be rare the
[31:46] world will be rare but this are not
[31:48] funded everybody clear
[31:51] remember Israel was looking for Elijah
[31:53] and nobody could find Elijah Elijah was
[31:57] hidden somewhere by a brook being fed by
[32:01] the Raven and later on by a widow woman
[32:04] everybody clear now let's go to the book
[32:07] of Revelation chapter 6 very familiar
[32:10] Scripture we should be very familiar
[32:16] with the seals now when I say the first
[32:19] year the second year it should not be
[32:21] Greek if you have a problem so you got a
[32:24] review the sermons that we had since
[32:28] leaving word Tabernacle everybody their
[32:30] flesh in chapter 6 first father if you
[32:35] dare you can say Amen and when he opened
[32:40] the third seal this is now the third
[32:44] seal what does the third seal have to do
[32:51] here and when he opened the third seal I
[32:55] heard the third beast say the anointing
[32:58] of men come and see and I beheld and lo
[33:02] a black horse and he desaad on him had a
[33:07] pair
[33:08] of balance in other words scale your
[33:10] zodiac told us that he was Libra you
[33:13] remember a pair of steel in his hand on
[33:17] the third seal the first symbol that
[33:20] appeared after the cavern here is a
[33:24] scale or a balance everybody clear what
[33:29] does he mean as hell I know we only we
[33:33] all know that it means that they are
[33:35] selling food and things why the scale
[33:38] everybody clear verse six and I heard a
[33:42] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[33:45] say a measure of wheat for a penny so
[33:50] there is a trade going on there is some
[33:54] commercial activity happening here where
[33:57] they are selling wheat to a certain
[34:00] price because the scale in the Bible
[34:04] speak of trading speak of selling things
[34:07] there were selling things by scale
[34:09] that's why God spoke in the book of
[34:11] Proverbs to make sure your scale is
[34:13] right because you don't want to be
[34:16] cheating people everybody clear
[34:17] so there is one measure of weight here
[34:23] one measure of wheat for what for a
[34:28] penny now when we think our American Way
[34:32] what a penny is it's nothing you can
[34:38] part with a penny now nothing if they
[34:40] give you one cents
[34:41] you're not going to buy anything if you
[34:43] take them and tell it to into the
[34:45] scripture you're not gonna get it
[34:47] because what Branham say the Bible is an
[34:50] Eastern book you need to understand the
[34:54] Bible according to the Eastern culture
[34:57] then you're going to find out what a
[35:00] penny really worth a penny in our
[35:03] Western civilization it's nothing but in
[35:07] the Bible it means something everybody
[35:09] clear
[35:10] because there is a famine in the land
[35:12] somewhere and they are selling one
[35:15] measure of weight for a penny the Bible
[35:19] continued he say and three measure
[35:21] of barley for what for a painting we
[35:26] have three measures of barley we have
[35:30] wheat here
[35:31] everybody clear and barley both wheat
[35:37] barley mix bread over here no bread here
[35:45] no water in the last day bread water
[35:51] spiritually speaking the Word of God
[35:54] are we there now in the third seal there
[35:58] is a scale coming up where they're
[36:00] selling wheat and barley at a certain
[36:04] price which rod Radames say they are the
[36:07] stuff that they make bread so bread is
[36:10] the gain effectively everybody clear
[36:13] praise God and three measures of barley
[36:18] for a penny and see you hurt not G all
[36:23] and the one I'm gonna write it here
[36:27] when it comes to the third seal there is
[36:35] four element to the torture the first
[36:38] one is there is a scale which speaking
[36:42] about the Train everybody there the
[36:46] economy and everything the second thing
[36:49] we have wheat and we have barley both of
[36:55] these the Bible call them corn when the
[36:59] say corn or grain it either barley or
[37:04] each week and then the other element is
[37:08] wine and the last one is oil when the
[37:14] third sell it it's affecting the economy
[37:18] very clear when the third seal heat is
[37:23] gone affect bread when the third sell
[37:27] heat under the church hedges they told
[37:31] the devil touch not the oil
[37:35] and the Weinman if not therefore would
[37:38] have messed it up everybody there and
[37:41] see you hurt not the oil and the one
[37:46] let's pray them Heavenly Father Lord we
[37:51] thank you again for your grace your love
[37:53] your mercy and for giving us an
[37:55] opportunity to gather together here
[37:58] presently and on virtual broadcast
[38:03] through YouTube lon

[38:06] again for Wednesday service Lord father

[38:20] we thank you and we want to commit this
[38:22] service unto the hand asking you Lord

[39:03] car or a word Lord father or maybe later
[39:06] on they wanna backload father to watch
[39:09] this sermon father may the anointing
[39:11] continue to throw the same work is
[39:14] flowing north father with the tip of
[39:16] this message father Lord Jesus class we
[39:19] ask everything Lord it's been great
[39:21] blessings from the Lord in the name of
[39:24] Jesus Christ amen
[39:26] grab a table good to see you we're going
[39:30] to continue with the unparent of god
[39:32] malachite for when we deal with the
[39:36] subject of Malachi 4 we are specifically
[39:40] dealing with the spirit of Elijah and in
[39:43] order to understand the spirit of Elijah
[39:45] we need to understand first the fact
[39:48] that God does not change what God does
[39:51] something one time God will continue to
[39:54] do that thing repeatedly because God
[39:57] does not improve and you can trace God
[40:00] you can predict God you can chase God
[40:03] and find out where God is because God
[40:06] does not change and neither does the
[40:10] anointing of God changing if you receive
[40:14] the anointing of the larger is going to
[40:16] make you behave like Elijah when the
[40:18] anointing of Elijah came on Elijah and
[40:21] the Sun and the ball was dead Elijah
[40:23] climb on the boy and brought him back to
[40:26] life when there are not in job done in
[40:29] Elijah if you remember Elijah also met a
[40:32] woman who was barren and that woman had
[40:35] a son and later on the woman had a son
[40:38] stroke and died and Elijah clam on the
[40:41] boy and put his mouth to his mouth eyes
[40:43] to his eyes pray the Lord and the ball
[40:46] also came back to life and we found out
[40:49] in this end time that for some reason
[40:50] brother Branham had a friend by the name
[40:54] of a lodge I gave you the code last time
[40:57] II like why was brother branham friend
[41:02] collie Lodge
[41:03] why what what I've had many friends one
[41:08] was probably DiMaggio carrion
[41:11] one was dr. lancer Allen or his friend
[41:16] none of them died either the only one
[41:20] that died was brother a lodge and the
[41:25] only one that brother branham have to
[41:27] clamp on him and put his mouth to his
[41:30] mouth as to his eyes hand to his head to
[41:34] bring him to resurrection was only
[41:36] brother a Raj and if you look you will
[41:39] see her right here how the word Elijah
[41:42] was hidden right there telling you that
[41:45] you are dealing with the anointing of
[41:47] Elijah again it is in nature it is in
[41:50] the zodiac it is in the pyramid it is
[41:53] also in the written word so when we
[41:57] looked at that we approached something
[41:59] less time where brother Branham say that
[42:02] the unchangeable God with the intangible
[42:06] character and he is characteristic
[42:09] remain just the same he cannot change
[42:12] his characteristic he cannot do it if he
[42:16] does it he's not the same yesterday
[42:18] today and forever but God is perfect God
[42:22] is infinite God does not change whatever
[42:25] he takes out the decision the first time
[42:27] is going to remain forever to everybody
[42:30] clear
[42:31] anything is known by age characteristic
[42:35] that's the reason why we are shaping the
[42:38] Ministry of brother Branham from the
[42:40] zodiac into the pyramid into the written
[42:43] word back and forth until you yourself
[42:46] come to a conclusion who brother Branham
[42:50] is what is this message to us in this
[42:53] endtime not the pastor say not brother
[42:57] Stephen say not
[42:58] mamasay note I was born in a message nor
[43:01] I grew up in a message not a new
[43:03] somebody in the message but you get a
[43:05] true revelation what this ministry is
[43:08] and once you are convinced then you're
[43:12] going to be concerned convinced them
[43:14] concern everybody clear now when we
[43:18] looked at Elijah when we were
[43:20] establishing his ministry we found out
[43:23] that his anointing comes fathoms
[43:26] but among those five towns there is one
[43:29] time that his anointing is not dealing
[43:32] with a Jewish nation but his anointing
[43:35] was dealing with the Gentile nation but
[43:39] Abraham say in the message the fifth
[43:41] seal he said look at Moses ministry
[43:44] Elijah was a prophet to all nations are
[43:49] you there so Elijah anointing can be
[43:52] both working in the Jewish nation or
[43:55] alike the anointing can also be working
[43:57] into a giant our nation everybody clear
[44:00] but Moses was a lawgiver to the Jews
[44:04] only so you cannot predict the spirit of
[44:08] Moses coming back right here or doing
[44:11] something Moses will go back to the Jews
[44:14] and matter of fact he appeared the first
[44:16] time and the second time he is going to
[44:18] appear when we are no longer on this
[44:20] earth but we got to be up there into the
[44:22] marriage supper and he says Moses is
[44:25] that damned Jews saying wait we are
[44:27] still keeping the law here but he stands
[44:30] but he is then Moses himself and here is
[44:33] Elijah standing with him Oh see he comes
[44:37] to the Jews only see Moses only went to
[44:40] the Jews the prophet Elijah was to all
[44:43] the nation brother Branham is decoding
[44:47] something here with Jewish people Jewish
[44:51] people are very strict to the religion
[44:54] Jewish people were even forbidden to go
[44:57] and help other nation even Jesus Christ
[45:01] himself
[45:01] it is that Jesus declared that he was
[45:04] sent only to the lost sheep of earth
[45:07] Israel that's why the syrophoenician who
[45:11] hard time she thought she can
[45:13] impersonate the Jewish approach and
[45:16] called Jesus Christ son of David but
[45:19] still it didn't work until a revelation
[45:21] struck here that you need to call him
[45:24] son of God because son of God is when
[45:28] Jesus is dealing with the Gentile
[45:30] through the seven churches so even
[45:33] though it was not the dispensation yet
[45:35] but the grace of God are folded a door
[45:38] for her to understand the proper way to
[45:41] approach Jesus Christ and what she did
[45:43] by the gentle door which is the Son of
[45:47] God which is God working through the
[45:50] seven churches then God stop and turn
[45:53] around and give unto her what she wanted
[45:56] so Elijah right here was a Jewish man as
[46:00] well in the scripture so it was not easy
[46:02] for Elijah a Jew to go ahead and to deal
[46:07] with a gentle woman in this country of
[46:10] Sodom a widow in saritha just leave
[46:15] Israel and go there he was a Jewish
[46:17] prophet so in order for God to prepare
[46:20] Elijah everybody clear
[46:23] God gave him an experience with
[46:26] something that he knew better by the law
[46:30] that he was unclean remember Peter
[46:33] everybody clear
[46:35] so God give him an experience with the
[46:38] Raven so before he goes first and deal
[46:42] with the gentlewoman God have to prepare
[46:46] him into a different ministry just like
[46:50] Peter Peter noodle Oh Peter knew exactly
[46:53] what to do but God knew that if I tell
[46:56] Peter is go to the house of Cornelius
[47:00] Peter will refuse it
[47:02] he will say no there is no way a Jew can
[47:06] go and deal with a gentle so God had to
[47:10] give him a vision and bring something
[47:13] that according to the law looks on
[47:16] cleaner yet God declared that he was not
[47:18] unclean he was cleaner and by the time
[47:22] for even people meant go to the house of
[47:26] Cornelius the Bible declared to us that
[47:28] Cornelius was adjustment the Bible says
[47:33] that Cornelius was a man that was good
[47:35] giving arms to the people the Bible
[47:38] declared to us that Cornelius was
[47:40] praying and was fearing God and we there
[47:43] and not only that Cornelius even
[47:46] encountered the angel of God so in the
[47:51] eyes of Peter he will never think
[47:53] something like that could happen to
[47:55] agenda only Jews see angels only Jews
[47:59] worship God but God has to prepare him
[48:03] with experience with a vision to prepare
[48:07] his heart that hey I am fixing to leave
[48:10] Israel and to begin to deal with the
[48:13] gentle Israel rejected God now it's the
[48:17] time that I'm going to change this
[48:19] translation from the dispensation of
[48:21] dealing with the Jews all the way to the
[48:24] dispensation of dealing with the gentle
[48:26] God also prepare a larger in the Old
[48:30] Testament under the same way in other
[48:33] words you're going to deal with
[48:35] something that's going to entertain you
[48:37] that's going to sustain you that's going
[48:40] to give you food but that which is going
[48:43] to bring you food is now going to be
[48:44] something that is legally by the law
[48:47] clean if I tell you God to a widow woman
[48:51] a Gentile woman if you go to that woman
[48:54] she's going to give you food you won't
[48:56] like it you say no no no no no God why
[48:58] there is many women in Israel here why
[49:01] do you send me to the Gentile so God
[49:03] have to prepare him in order to send him
[49:06] to a ministry everybody clear
[49:08] before there was a man by the name of
[49:11] Jacob Jacob in the scripture loves the
[49:15] Rachel with all his heart Jacob was
[49:18] sleeping dreaming about Rachel Jacob was
[49:21] talking about Rachel Jacob could not
[49:24] sleep at all because of Jacob
[49:27] because of Rachel when he went to his
[49:30] father-in-law and he talked he to his
[49:32] father-in-law he said father-in-law I
[49:34] want to be your son-in-law what is going
[49:37] on I love Rachel
[49:40] they told him that you're going to work
[49:42] seven years everybody else if you tell a
[49:46] young man here you need to go to work
[49:50] before you get married it's a trouble
[49:52] are we there if you tell a young man
[49:55] here like before you get married you
[49:58] want to wait seven years who's going to
[49:59] do that today but the Bible said because
[50:05] Jacob loved nature he didn't see those
[50:09] seven years as something that was great
[50:12] so love overcome trouble if there is a
[50:17] true love in a marriage if there is a
[50:20] true love in the church it's not going
[50:23] to be label it's not going to be things
[50:26] that we are doing because we must do
[50:28] it's not going to be somebody pushing
[50:31] you to do something but if no fingers
[50:33] will be easy
[50:34] the yoke will be easy because love
[50:37] covers a multitude and give Rachel
[50:40] auntie Jacob
[50:42] they took Leah and give it to Jacob
[50:47] again and the Bible say leah was hated
[50:53] everybody clear so God sometime have to
[50:58] give you an experience to prepare you
[51:02] into something I would God have to let
[51:07] Jacob deal with Leah leave me flee as a
[51:11] white man he doesn't one before he get
[51:15] to Rachel God sometime can let you go to
[51:19] a hard experience it is not to lose you
[51:23] but it's an experience to prepare you
[51:26] for something that he's fixing to do in
[51:29] your life so you need to know God and
[51:32] discern him by the spirit
[51:34] so when Elijah went to this woman I'm
[51:39] going to come back to this
[51:41] code brother branham say this little
[51:44] woman must have been of the caliber of
[51:47] elijah everybody here
[51:50] when we went to the house of Cornelius
[51:53] while Peter was preaching the Word of
[51:56] God didn't notice that the Holy Spirit
[52:00] came exactly the same way like he came
[52:05] on them on the day of Pentecost and when
[52:09] the Jewish asked him he said wait a
[52:12] minute
[52:12] they received the Holy Ghost not in the
[52:16] different way than I either they
[52:19] received the Holy Ghost and guess what
[52:22] they begin to speak in tongues when we
[52:25] receive the Holy Spirit we also began to
[52:28] speak in tongues oh so God did not make
[52:30] a difference between them and us because
[52:34] God is no respecter of various and Peter
[52:39] we're on the same caliber they were all
[52:44] children of God one was just born a
[52:48] Gentile one was born a Jewish but when
[52:51] the Holy Spirit counsel there is no
[52:54] difference in the experience of the Holy
[52:56] Ghost they were in the same nature same
[53:00] caliber ellebra clear he says because
[53:05] usually your action shows what you are
[53:09] and again she has been chosen to
[53:11] entertain God's prophet Elijah already
[53:15] got used to the crowd
[53:16] entertaining him now it's not a big deal
[53:20] remember she was a gentle not a Jew the
[53:26] dispossession the spirit of Elijah the
[53:29] anointing of Elijah is leaving the
[53:31] Jewish nation into the gentle but the
[53:35] problem is when you got anointing goes
[53:37] to the gentle the gentle have a
[53:40] dispensation called the seven churches
[53:42] we have the first church the second the
[53:46] third all the way to the seven but which
[53:48] age is going to qualify to have the
[53:52] spirit of right
[53:54] is he going to be in the age of Paul
[53:56] he's going to be in the age of that
[54:00] seriously or what it's clear now that
[54:03] the spirit of Elijah will be working
[54:06] into a gentle nation but which church
[54:10] age are clear then brother Brian
[54:14] continue he says the land was burning up
[54:18] judgment was hearing the lane and no
[54:21] doubt that this little woman being of
[54:24] that caliber being of L deliver
[54:28] Cornelius was a believer
[54:31] everybody here okay top four we see that
[54:36] God would not have caught her if she had
[54:38] not have been worthy to entertain God's
[54:41] prophet for he would not have he will
[54:45] never send his prophet to a house that
[54:48] was our D was the house of Cornelius who
[54:52] already he was a worthy house go with up
[54:56] to chapter 10 you will see that the man
[54:58] was lined up in the scripture everybody
[55:01] clear
[55:02] so God know when he sent Peter already
[55:05] he was not his choosing he was God's
[55:10] choosing he was not her bidding he was
[55:15] God bidding in other world out of many
[55:18] Widow that existed in that time God knew
[55:23] who was the true Widow that can receive
[55:27] the message of Elijah and to swallow it
[55:32] let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 4
[55:36] I hope my speed is not too quick so we
[55:43] can let this sink slowly
[55:51] if you dare you can say Amen Luke
[55:55] chapter 4 verse 25 Oh
[55:58] you paid disaster okay but I tell you of
[56:04] a truth this is Jesus speaking many
[56:07] widows were in so when you look
[56:12] naturally speaking Israel had many Widow
[56:15] and they qualified to entertain probably
[56:19] Elijah because they were Jews by Nature
[56:22] but God left completely the Jews people
[56:26] left those Widow and went after a gentle
[56:31] Widow
[56:32] everybody clear there were many widows
[56:36] well in Israel in the days of who Elijah
[56:41] when the heaven was shut up three years
[56:45] and six month the Bible is very specific
[56:49] of the area or the timing this happened
[56:53] not when Israel was still under the
[56:55] blessing but when Israel was under the
[56:58] curse everybody clear when great word
[57:04] everybody here can you check your board
[57:07] when great word so famine was already
[57:12] heating the land so right here what I
[57:17] want you to recall is when Elijah who
[57:21] left the Jewish nation and was going
[57:24] into a gentle nation both the Jewish
[57:29] nation and the gentle nation were under
[57:33] famine keep the demand everybody okay
[57:39] and when great famine was throughout all
[57:43] there not just the Jewish land verse 26
[57:48] but to none of them this is why it's
[57:52] great he was God choosing - none of them
[57:56] was Elijah Elijah water a larger central
[58:04] Malakai phone I will send you Elijah
[58:09] so Elijah will be sent to a gentle woman
[58:15] not a Jew not a widow in Israel but they
[58:19] will be ascending of Elijah to the
[58:22] gentle I will send you Elijah the
[58:26] Prophet
[58:28] everybody clear so far but none of them
[58:32] knows Elijah sent except to Sarepta
[58:37] gentle a city of Sodom gentle to a woman
[58:43] that was a widow one in a million
[58:47] several women there but grace was
[58:50] floating around and graves went over to
[58:54] pick up a gentle bride a gentle church
[58:58] chose him because by law we didn't
[59:01] qualify Paul say that we were outside
[59:04] the Commonwealth of Israel
[59:07] we were not partaking of the promises of
[59:10] the father but he took the cross of
[59:13] Jesus Christ to take the blessing of the
[59:16] first one and put it on the younger one
[59:19] that's why the woman has the two sticks
[59:22] which symbolize the cross everybody
[59:27] clear with the house of Cornelius it's
[59:30] the same thing now when Elijah appeared
[59:34] the first time in the Bible Elijah
[59:37] struck the rain or affected the rain why
[59:43] did he affect rain let's go to the book
[59:47] of Deuteronomy chapter 11 if I can you
[59:51] have this one point so we'll be good for
[59:53] Sunday it's Wednesday so let's
[59:59] it as a bubble study at our Bible study
[1:00:04] is always coupled with the message you
[1:00:07] preach Jesus Christ according to the
[1:00:10] revelation of the mystery autonomy
[1:00:15] chapter 11 everybody there verse 10 this
[1:00:22] is God speaking about the Land of Israel
[1:00:25] for the land were you going to possess
[1:00:28] God is talking to the Jews you want to
[1:00:31] go to the priests land but I'm going to
[1:00:32] give you a description a characteristics
[1:00:36] some characteristic about this land he
[1:00:40] said for the land where you go in to
[1:00:42] possess it is not as the land of Egypt
[1:00:46] it's a different land from where you
[1:00:50] came out where you saw your seed and
[1:00:54] water it with your foot as a garden of
[1:00:58] application it was a man-made technology
[1:01:03] to order the crop but Israel is not a
[1:01:06] man-made technology it's a technology
[1:01:09] that comes from heaven over there watch
[1:01:14] verse 11 but they learned where you go
[1:01:17] to possess it is a land of hills and
[1:01:20] valleys and drinks water of the rain of
[1:01:26] heaven so this land totally depend from
[1:01:32] the rain a very clear and the master of
[1:01:38] the rain is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:41] everybody clear verse 12 now a land
[1:01:45] which the Lord your God careful so God
[1:01:50] is watching over that the eyes of the
[1:01:53] Lord your God are always upon it
[1:01:58] everybody clear from the beginning of
[1:02:01] the year even to the end of the year in
[1:02:04] other world 360 days God is
[1:02:08] instantly watching over the Land of
[1:02:11] Israel and sending rain to sustain the
[1:02:15] Land of Israel
[1:02:16] now watch verse 14 that I will give you
[1:02:21] the rain of your land in its due season
[1:02:26] everybody clear the first women or the
[1:02:30] former rain and the latter rain that you
[1:02:34] make gather in your corn remember corn
[1:02:39] here is speaking of wheat and barley
[1:02:45] everybody clear that you may gather in
[1:02:50] your corn and your wine I want you to
[1:02:55] watch this it thirsty very clear when
[1:03:00] you affect the rain the rain according
[1:03:04] to the scripture brains corn it brings
[1:03:08] wheat and barley
[1:03:10] he also bring wine everybody there and
[1:03:13] the last one and your oil
[1:03:17] everybody clear so when Elijah affected
[1:03:21] the rain he automatically affected these
[1:03:26] three elements in other word the third
[1:03:29] seal was already hearing the nation's we
[1:03:37] okay three elements the width or the
[1:03:42] barley which are the corn the wine and
[1:03:45] we will have also the old now let's go
[1:03:49] to the book of Joel chapter 2
[1:03:59] you read the scripture superficially
[1:04:02] you're gonna come up with a superficial
[1:04:06] understanding when they say no more rain
[1:04:12] in other word what they are saying is no
[1:04:16] more corn no more weed no more barley no
[1:04:21] more wine no more oiler everybody clear
[1:04:26] and we found those element were sealed
[1:04:29] under the third shield Joe chapter 2
[1:04:34] verse 23 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:04:37] the Bible said be glad that you children
[1:04:40] of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for
[1:04:44] he has given you the former rain
[1:04:48] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:04:51] down for you the rain the former and the
[1:04:54] latter rain in the first month you need
[1:04:57] both rains it's a teaching there
[1:05:00] according to brother Branham one is
[1:05:02] moving and the other one we will get to
[1:05:04] that later on
[1:05:05] and the floor shall be full of water
[1:05:10] everybody clear wheat and the VATS are
[1:05:15] overflow with water wine and so the rain
[1:05:22] it is connected always with those
[1:05:25] elements once you affect the rain you
[1:05:28] are setting the bread you are setting
[1:05:31] the width you are setting the barley you
[1:05:33] are affecting the one you are setting
[1:05:35] the oil so well Elijah moving earlier
[1:05:39] when Israel seen Elijah coming and
[1:05:43] struck open the third seal - struck
[1:05:46] Israel over here because when the first
[1:05:51] seal open is stroking the winter he have
[1:05:55] felt that the wine and the oil
[1:05:59] the old God said don't touch the wine
[1:06:03] and the old and were here now let's
[1:06:07] continue in verse 25 the Bible say and I
[1:06:11] will restore to you so something will be
[1:06:17] affected the oil will be affected the
[1:06:21] lion will be affected the weight will be
[1:06:23] affected but there will be a restoration
[1:06:28] Elijah must come to restore all things
[1:06:32] everybody clear and I will restore to
[1:06:36] you the years that the locust has eaten
[1:06:40] the King Quran and they can appear and
[1:06:43] the Pandorum my great army which are
[1:06:46] sent among you there is a restoration
[1:06:49] connected here why because things are
[1:06:52] gonna go into chaos are you there now if
[1:06:56] you remember in the seals when we have
[1:06:59] the first four seals you should be
[1:07:02] familiar with this now we found out that
[1:07:04] that there is a seal that we described
[1:07:07] here which is the third seal there is a
[1:07:10] Libra that the zodiac toad has a scale
[1:07:13] and when the scale comes the release
[1:07:16] those three elements are affected with
[1:07:18] it but the problem is they say a measure
[1:07:24] of wheat for a penny emerge three
[1:07:28] measures of barley for a penny a penny
[1:07:32] according to the Jetta nothing but what
[1:07:36] about to the Jewish let's go to the book
[1:07:39] of Matthew chapter 20
[1:07:51] if you dare you can see you man
[1:07:54] my future 420 Matthew chapter 20 verse 1
[1:08:04] everybody clear
[1:08:08] praise God
[1:08:09] somebody saw that already oh the kingdom
[1:08:14] of heaven is like - amen
[1:08:16] that is a household a householder which
[1:08:21] went out early in the morning to hire
[1:08:24] labourers into his vineyard so there is
[1:08:28] a boss a man here died of wealth he has
[1:08:32] a business he need employee I'm putting
[1:08:36] that in our Center a very clear verse -
[1:08:39] and when he agree with the labor the
[1:08:43] employees for water in a penny one so
[1:08:48] the penny in the Bible is not the
[1:08:51] Western penny over here the penny is a
[1:08:56] salary of the entire day if you are
[1:09:02] paying $20 an hour and you work ten
[1:09:07] hours into a shift meaning you making
[1:09:10] $200 a day so one measure of barley
[1:09:15] cause one hamburger cost $200 you see oh
[1:09:24] so the tonsil is already telling you
[1:09:28] that there is a problem with the economy
[1:09:31] there is a famine in the land there is
[1:09:36] no loan in the land the land is affected
[1:09:40] and because there is a scarcity there is
[1:09:45] a lack of food everybody is raising the
[1:09:53] lack of masks due to coronavirus the
[1:09:56] masks are getting higher in price why
[1:10:03] economy is affected then the price of
[1:10:09] the food in Queens in subscribe they
[1:10:12] increase in Walmart
[1:10:14] why because famine the tracksuit is here
[1:10:19] in the nation so a measure of wheat what
[1:10:26] you need to eat for one day begin to
[1:10:30] cost you a salary for the entire day
[1:10:34] what the speaks of famine famine both
[1:10:41] naturally and spiritually everybody
[1:10:46] clear
[1:10:46] we clear there okay brother branham help
[1:10:52] me now the fictional now let notice the
[1:10:56] third seal everybody see that
[1:11:01] hello buddy Silla let notice the third
[1:11:04] seal now this is the brother wanna meet

[1:11:15] say it's famine if you don't understand
[1:11:18] just say mmm and wait until the
[1:11:22] anointing come on the five for ministry
[1:11:24] and they're going to pick up those
[1:11:26] things and explain it to you
[1:11:28] are we there now you understand why
[1:11:31] brother Branham say the third seal is
[1:11:33] firming over here now Matthew 24 seven
[1:11:41] and eight let's get seven and eight in
[1:11:43] Matthews and nation shall rise against
[1:11:46] and Kingdom against Kingdom and they
[1:11:48] shall be famine I drop down to one steel
[1:11:52] we shall get that that is the third
[1:11:56] opening is in a congregation say Amen
[1:11:59] Matthew 24 seven and eight I'm sorry now
[1:12:03] that opens the earth
[1:12:05] why did brother Branham say this never
[1:12:10] give you an explanation
[1:12:11] that's why brother Branham say if I take
[1:12:15] one seal
[1:12:17] preach it the way God give to me I will
[1:12:20] preach one cell for three mantra in
[1:12:24] other word what you read in one book is
[1:12:27] lauded the transyl is feminine and not
[1:12:34] only is the tensor framing brother
[1:12:36] branham said he open up the rain while
[1:12:40] rain because when effect though which
[1:12:42] well affect the valley when effect the
[1:12:46] wine and when affect them all those
[1:12:50] three element were under their consular
[1:12:55] everybody clear
[1:12:58] they open up the rain or their he's
[1:13:02] saying feminine rain
[1:13:05] so when elijah comes and struck the rain
[1:13:08] in other world elijah is opening the
[1:13:11] door to the tracks here
[1:13:16] Israel was under famine that's why Luke
[1:13:19] chapter 425 said there was a great
[1:13:22] sermon everybody here
[1:13:26] so if there was a great famine what
[1:13:29] about the folks here we know by the
[1:13:32] scripture that folks you when the
[1:13:35] cavalry came out his name was called
[1:13:38] death his name was called death and we
[1:13:45] clear if not open about we clear his
[1:13:50] name was called death so if you remember
[1:13:54] when Elijah met the widow women after
[1:13:57] that he said I need a little bit of
[1:13:59] bread and after the bread the woman
[1:14:02] replied she said you know what she'll
[1:14:04] either have a cake all I have is water I
[1:14:09] only have all and a little bit the meal
[1:14:12] and what I'm trying to do is to prepare
[1:14:14] food for me and my son to eat hand and
[1:14:19] water and die so when Elijah was under
[1:14:28] preparation
[1:14:30] hit the gentlewoman or to go to the
[1:14:33] gentlewoman the third she was already
[1:14:36] running its course I'm going slowly then
[1:14:42] wonderful Syl begin to work was already
[1:14:46] under the anointing of death are you
[1:14:50] there
[1:14:50] that's why Elijah appeared to the woman
[1:14:56] in other word the Ministry of Elijah
[1:15:00] will appear to the Genta at the force
[1:15:03] field and the fo'c'sle is the angel
[1:15:08] anointing that's going to fight the pair
[1:15:12] rather which is death
[1:15:15] everybody clear what about the first and
[1:15:22] the second zero you wanna so no worries
[1:15:28] let's go to first King chapter 19 I'm
[1:15:34] just describing you why is brother
[1:15:36] branham appearing with all this stuff
[1:15:39] with pulling them up from the Bible from
[1:15:43] the by bow first Kings chapter 19 if you
[1:15:50] dare you can say Amen
[1:16:01] we already explained the kids and the
[1:16:03] Ministry of Elijah right now watch
[1:16:06] carefully Elijah was in the caves before
[1:16:10] the Sun sent mountain experience
[1:16:11] everybody remember that because he was
[1:16:14] after the cave that's when the world
[1:16:18] wood came out and split and a rock which
[1:16:20] when all of that everybody here but
[1:16:23] watch before he goes to sunset mountain
[1:16:27] before he goes to that experience with
[1:16:29] the whirlwind strutting the rock and
[1:16:31] then busting rocks or plan what happened
[1:16:34] to Elijah what his description let's
[1:16:42] take verse 1 I want to drop something he
[1:16:45] just came back and told Jezebel oh that
[1:16:51] Elijah had done and without how he had
[1:16:56] slain all the Prophet with death so
[1:16:59] Elijah had a sword are we clear so
[1:17:06] Elijah with the jente will have a sword
[1:17:10] that he is going to through the false
[1:17:12] prophet and we know everybody clear
[1:17:17] I'm gonna go slowly until you sit down
[1:17:20] you say done deal he is Malachi for
[1:17:24] everybody there now let's go to verse 9
[1:17:27] and he came there to a cave and launched
[1:17:30] them and behold the word of the Lord
[1:17:32] came to him and he said unto Him what do
[1:17:35] you do here what do you hear
[1:17:37] Elijah and he said I have been very
[1:17:40] zealous for the Lord God of hosts for
[1:17:45] the children of God of Israel has
[1:17:47] forsaken your covenant so the first
[1:17:50] thing Elijah is describing here is the
[1:17:54] children of Israel for sector
[1:17:56] commandment the Covenant because
[1:18:00] remember when we explained Moses before
[1:18:02] the end or the death of Moses Moses
[1:18:06] called all the elder of Israel and told
[1:18:09] them that I know after
[1:18:11] departure you gonna leave God so when
[1:18:14] Israel departed from God a Ministry of
[1:18:17] Elijah has to be sad but to bring the
[1:18:20] heart of Israel back to God so Allah is
[1:18:24] explaining God here that where I am now
[1:18:28] everybody here in Israel already took
[1:18:32] your commandment and we know when we
[1:18:36] introduced Paul when before Paul died
[1:18:39] which was a type of a modern Moses Paul
[1:18:43] also called ER and ER and per se that
[1:18:46] are no aftermath departure there will be
[1:18:50] grieving whoops that's gonna come up and
[1:18:52] I will do a scatter destroy their altars
[1:18:59] churches everybody let's go back and he
[1:19:06] says I have been jealous for the Lord
[1:19:10] God of hosts for the children of God
[1:19:12] have forsaken your covenant thrown down
[1:19:15] your altars remember altars in the Bible
[1:19:18] speak of one church a place of worship
[1:19:24] everybody there so Paul was saying that
[1:19:27] I know after my departure you going to
[1:19:31] be departing from the Lord that's why
[1:19:34] you'd say contend for the faith that was
[1:19:38] once delivered to the cell that's why
[1:19:41] Jesus said when the Son of Man will come
[1:19:43] shall heal firm faith and if you recall
[1:19:48] in the book of Genesis in the ephesian
[1:19:53] church age when the filtered Church age
[1:19:56] came when does though the message open
[1:19:59] up God said that I have one finger
[1:20:02] against you Ephesian what happened you
[1:20:07] have left your first you are ready for
[1:20:10] second God you've already forsaken your
[1:20:14] covenant with me are you there and the
[1:20:19] fusion church changes was the
[1:20:22] 19 was the first breaking day
[1:20:27] Elijah's telling garden the first seal
[1:20:31] already run its course we clear I'm
[1:20:36] gonna explain it
[1:20:38] let's go back there and for the children
[1:20:41] of Israel has forsaken your covenant
[1:20:43] thrown down your altar and did what
[1:20:47] so annual profit with the sword what
[1:20:52] happened when the Antichrist left the
[1:20:55] first our horse and change to the head
[1:20:58] rose he ever showed what he was he doing
[1:21:02] killing the children of what God your
[1:21:05] second cell was right there
[1:21:08] now you seed are you there everybody
[1:21:14] clear
[1:21:15] he's killed Elijah I went to more
[1:21:18] horrible but when he goes to more ever
[1:21:22] he's bringing the scriptures about the
[1:21:25] seals let's read it
[1:21:33] your prophet with the sword and I even I
[1:21:37] only I'm left and they seek my love to
[1:21:40] take it did God answer him watch what no
[1:21:45] God tells him verse 11 and he said go
[1:21:47] forth and Santa ponder in other word I
[1:21:51] want you to go east go west go to South
[1:21:56] Atlantic you are inquiring you are
[1:21:58] bringing the seals here I can see how
[1:22:01] the Antichrist Jezebel was killing 68
[1:22:05] million to other churches but before I
[1:22:09] open up the revelation you need to go to
[1:22:12] sunset mountain everybody the scripture
[1:22:18] was already there but he have to go
[1:22:20] through the experience well the lines I
[1:22:23] went there what happened the whirlwind
[1:22:25] came up there was rock
[1:22:27] there was fire and everything watch now
[1:22:29] verse 13 what
[1:22:34] 13 and he was so when Elijah heard it he
[1:22:40] rubbed his face in his mantle and went
[1:22:42] out and stood at the entering of the
[1:22:44] cave and below they came a voice to him
[1:22:46] and said what do you hear what Elijah
[1:22:49] same question they asked him are you
[1:22:53] there after sunset mountain go back
[1:22:56] Easter
[1:22:57] now you can preach this hills everybody
[1:23:03] clear
[1:23:03] watch a larger he's gonna repeat the
[1:23:06] same thing and he said I have been very
[1:23:10] shadows same word I have been very
[1:23:14] jealous for the Lord God of hosts
[1:23:16] because the children of Israel have
[1:23:18] forsaken your covenant 12 and you altar
[1:23:21] and slain your prophet with the sword
[1:23:23] and I even I am left and the Sigma life
[1:23:27] to take it Elijah repeat the same thing
[1:23:29] here that's who I gotta wanna play here
[1:23:32] to go west to get the blaster and when
[1:23:35] he got the blaster then he come back and
[1:23:38] he took the silk then God came for the
[1:23:41] shield and God told him like I have
[1:23:44] never bought their knees I he unfolded a
[1:23:46] revelation
[1:23:47] he never asked for the doll revelation
[1:23:49] until the experience of sunset mountain
[1:23:52] happened first everybody clear everybody
[1:23:58] clear I hope I didn't lose it buddy
[1:24:02] everybody here now we came back to where
[1:24:05] we were last time tired okay what a
[1:24:12] Maurice you have not given me a signal
[1:24:14] yet okay now the last time we described
[1:24:19] this woman which plan everything about
[1:24:22] the timing that the spirit of Elijah
[1:24:25] will go to the Delta it will grow in the
[1:24:27] last church age which is the lower this
[1:24:30] century that's the church age where the
[1:24:34] anointing of death is dealing with it
[1:24:37] that way
[1:24:38] Elijah approached the woman because the
[1:24:42] third seal already hit now the fourth is
[1:24:45] entering to kill the woman that's why
[1:24:48] Elijah the Prophet appeared to a gentle
[1:24:51] woman so Elijah must appear in the last
[1:24:55] year changes when the anointing of death
[1:24:58] is already in the land what there is a
[1:25:01] woman double to be rescued everybody
[1:25:04] else and when the Rajah went there
[1:25:06] Elijah spoke to the woman and say hey
[1:25:09] bring me bread bring me water if you
[1:25:14] notice the woman was living with a
[1:25:18] natural food everybody she had a natural
[1:25:24] milk and she also has a cruse of oil
[1:25:29] everybody else
[1:25:30] these were natural that's the first food
[1:25:34] that was provided by the divine blessing
[1:25:38] of God from heaven either because meal
[1:25:43] right here was coming from rain and oil
[1:25:48] also was coming from the rain she
[1:25:51] already had natural food provided from
[1:25:55] heaven but when a larger came you follow
[1:26:00] me a larger spoke the word and that word
[1:26:06] created the same food but spiritually
[1:26:12] everybody here Moses have the first
[1:26:16] commandment of the law then the second
[1:26:19] one but both of them were still the same
[1:26:22] the only difference is one was written
[1:26:25] first by God but the second one Moses
[1:26:28] have to do some work to it the first
[1:26:31] food your first bubble you will have it
[1:26:35] are there but the second food must come
[1:26:39] from the mouth of Elijah but it's not
[1:26:42] going to be contradictory to your Bible
[1:26:44] it's going to be aligned with the food
[1:26:47] you already
[1:26:49] that's why the message is perfectly in
[1:26:52] line with the Bible are you there so
[1:26:59] they're opening that woman had food
[1:27:02] hidden a hidden manna because the food
[1:27:07] of the woman have a secret if she takes
[1:27:10] up other in the tabernacle in the third
[1:27:18] in the Holy of Holies
[1:27:20] there were manna when you take my out it
[1:27:24] was a hidden food created by the spoken
[1:27:29] word the third pull a loyalty created
[1:27:34] food dr. poore anointing was expressed
[1:27:39] to death
[1:27:40] Genta are we there the third pull
[1:27:46] anointing goes to a gentle woman we
[1:27:51] clear we clear with that then the
[1:27:55] resurrection was there and we saw
[1:27:57] already the resurrection with brother
[1:27:58] Branham now brother Branham says this I
[1:28:02] know where I'm going to stop there
[1:28:04] churches are cooling off we just might
[1:28:07] as well face that the churches are
[1:28:10] getting worse and worse all the time
[1:28:12] more preaching is been done than ever in
[1:28:17] the world
[1:28:17] and let's practice that's the same thing
[1:28:20] in a message more preaching get on
[1:28:24] YouTube see how many sermon we have in
[1:28:27] lutulu
[1:28:28] but they practice their life very little
[1:28:34] more preaching has been done than ever
[1:28:37] in the world and less practice than ever
[1:28:40] did in all the world just look like a
[1:28:43] keep men came coming undaunted of the
[1:28:47] whole spirit they preach with everything
[1:28:50] that was within that's within them and
[1:28:52] the people walk right away as if nothing
[1:28:55] had ever happened just unconcerned
[1:29:00] now there
[1:29:02] he's got to be a reason for that
[1:29:06] why is he people in a message don't
[1:29:10] change anymore
[1:29:11] what is the reason brother Branham and
[1:29:16] in future studies there is this tells
[1:29:21] what the reason is
[1:29:22] do you know the scripture says there
[1:29:25] will be a time in the last day when they
[1:29:27] shall be famine I'm going back to the
[1:29:31] scripture every clear famine struck the
[1:29:36] land not for bread and everybody here
[1:29:41] okay
[1:29:42] not for bread and water but for hearing
[1:29:45] the Word of God and that men and that
[1:29:50] men will go from East remember scripture
[1:29:53] west north and south seeking to read the
[1:29:57] Word of God and fell to find it just
[1:30:01] think of the time we are living in and
[1:30:03] we are living in that time I believe
[1:30:08] when the prophet amos spoke that he
[1:30:14] forced so the United States of America
[1:30:22] so you're Elijah will come from America
[1:30:32] because it's the only place that on
[1:30:36] earth would meet that description in
[1:30:39] this so the spirit of Elijah will go to
[1:30:45] the Delta well in Europe in Africa in
[1:30:50] Asia God told Abel's look over there
[1:30:54] whenever's look he saw the United State
[1:30:56] and he gave a corded corded description
[1:31:01] it takes a prophet to decode it and
[1:31:04] tells you the place Elijah will come
[1:31:06] will be a man
[1:31:11] Eureka okay we're gonna stop in those
[1:31:14] few quotes the Bible say about random
[1:31:16] say that revelation 10 and according to
[1:31:19] Malachi food and shall look 22:17 and so
[1:31:24] forth there is got to come a new fusion
[1:31:27] everybody remember the lion and their
[1:31:32] ego the lion health could come back
[1:31:34] again because the merienda when he comes
[1:31:37] down he's going to roll like a lion
[1:31:38] there will be another Ephesian Church
[1:31:41] angel right there is promising they must
[1:31:46] come an official that the Sevenfold
[1:31:49] mysteries of the Word of God must be
[1:31:53] unfolded and it believes that we are
[1:31:56] there I believe we are right in the
[1:31:59] shadow of the coming of the Son of God
[1:32:01] and as Joshua just before the Ephesian
[1:32:04] wisdom so did John the Baptist's ways
[1:32:07] just before the next official and we are
[1:32:10] promised another another Ephesian is
[1:32:12] predicted here in the scripture
[1:32:14] therefore a figure with a living in the
[1:32:16] Ephesian again we are promised that that
[1:32:20] word was left of doing the seven
[1:32:23] churches seven ages and how much more
[1:32:26] has he promised how much more it is
[1:32:29] leading in the bubble to this very age
[1:32:32] we are living the Ephesian again of the
[1:32:35] church ages we got seven Church ages we
[1:32:38] are promised that at the loud Eastern
[1:32:40] Church ages there will be another
[1:32:42] Ephesian that's right and we are here I
[1:32:45] believe it I believe we firma heart that
[1:32:48] Jesus Christ who made the promise so
[1:32:51] your Elijah is in the last age he is in
[1:32:56] the age of law Isha where is he coming
[1:32:59] from from America that's where the
[1:33:02] scripture bowing to and fro looking for
[1:33:05] food it is not in Europe so if they tell
[1:33:08] you malachi for is in europe is false
[1:33:10] malachi for will come from america when
[1:33:14] he come from america here is his
[1:33:17] description it's not going to be in the
[1:33:20] third seal but in the term when death is
[1:33:23] in the land
[1:33:24] when the pair horse is tracking both
[1:33:27] naturally and spiritually you can see
[1:33:29] coronavirus and everything going on that
[1:33:32] anointing is still working but not only
[1:33:34] is the anointing of death working the
[1:33:36] anointing of life the Eagle anointing
[1:33:39] also it is working around gathering the
[1:33:42] children because sooner we need to go to
[1:33:44] the rapture
[1:33:45] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:33:51] you again for your grace for your love
[1:33:53] for your mercy father all these things
[1:33:56] has been hidden and it took grace to
[1:34:00] bring them back to you slowly to unfold
[1:34:03] the Lord father this revelation not Lord
[1:34:07] father to bring us to a head knowledge
[1:34:09] but to make us realize determing Lord
[1:34:13] father and the importance of the
[1:34:16] revelation and the message you sent to
[1:34:18] us Lord father it's a troubling time you
[1:34:21] have permitted this troubling time Lord
[1:34:23] you know that we need it we needed this
[1:34:26] pressure we needed to be shaken from our
[1:34:29] comfort zone Lord to refocus to
[1:34:32] recalibrate to Lord we examine whether
[1:34:35] we are in the faith whether we
[1:34:38] understood what we got into it whether
[1:34:40] we understood the message that we are
[1:34:42] believing that we claim to be believing
[1:34:45] Lord father Lord Jesus Christ you spoke
[1:34:47] through your prophet that the revelation
[1:34:50] is a work of the spirit Lord it is not
[1:34:52] something that a man can bring or unfold
[1:34:55] to anybody further we can preach the
[1:34:58] word but it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:35:00] give the revelation father may you give
[1:35:02] the relation may you continue to
[1:35:04] minister to the heart of your children
[1:35:06] Lord until Lord father
[1:35:08] these sermon these series Lord Wilbur
[1:35:11] flawed father a thirst that's going to
[1:35:14] drive your children to desperation Lord
[1:35:17] to examine not somebody else life not
[1:35:20] somebody else church not what is going
[1:35:22] on all around the message Lord but to
[1:35:25] examine our own life to examine our own
[1:35:28] families to examine our own children to
[1:35:32] make sure a lot father that we have the
[1:35:34] token that we are serious we found that
[1:35:37] we are
[1:35:38] pair that in anytime father you can come
[1:35:41] and we will say that we are ready to go
[1:35:43] Lord because we are tired of this earth
[1:35:46] Lord father Lord may you minister grace
[1:35:48] to your children may you strengthen us
[1:35:50] Lord may you keep us in the center of
