need to catch up amen how many are reading the Cod book question and answer let's see the church ages okay praise the Lord you need to catch up and finish the church ages amen glory to God our question and answer Lord's willing will be on February the 18th and he more likely seems brother Kelly that it's going to be here in the church amen so February 18th and usually it's at 2 30. so make sure you're there on time and then our young sister's meeting is still for the 25th and it will be at three o'clock it's a secret place you know where it is check the group chat it will let you know amen three o'clock update amen Hallelujah we already shaped one another so do your work I do my work okay we don't want anybody Slack do you know what time I went to bed you know what happened yesterday some don't because they were not here amen glory to God amen amen glory to God oh my no yesterday we have a wonderful meeting of church order so if you miss it is not on me it is on you you're responsible for the order of the trade so the church started it's about three years now the order is put amen I went to every detail I can on every office is one by one one by one one by one all the way to the janitor place so if you don't know how the church operate now you need to see the Deacon and ask them and they will kind of guide you because I gave you the scripture I went through the court of brother Branham and if you have any question anymore or you don't understand things that was a great opportunity for you to be there and to learn how church operate when we say Deacon what is a deacon what they are the responsibility of the deacon what is the limitation of the deacon what does a deacon do when it's a trustee what does trustee do all the way there are only couple offices that I could not touch because we didn't have it we don't have it active yet amen amen so if you didn't show up and you see something unusual happening in church do not say anything you need to ask first because you could be wrong everybody okay don't gossip don't criticize don't do anything wait ask a question because I laid it out yesterday everything there are things that was laid out yesterday that people didn't know amen so if you don't know before you judge and say this is wrong stop pull the brick ask a question normally normally normally if you are spiritual quickly you have noticed that your pastor doesn't want liability I don't know if you caught that your pastor wanna make sure everything he say come from there the Bible and the so if I make a move before you say something push the brick remember there could be an emergency bullet that I'm holding for a legalist everybody okay everybody okay so you ask me are I will check the way you coming and then I will hand it to you I said this is oh I didn't know praise the Lord that's how we grow up together amen amen so like I said every office is independent because they are caught brother Branham saying the Deacon have nothing to tell the trustee and the trustee has nothing to tell the Deacon but yesterday I also show you that those office can work together and I gave you a quote where brother Branham say if a deacon cannot uh control what he's doing a trustee can help him so if you see a trustee helping a deacon before you get upset push the brick because I explained if a trustee is helping a deacon how he should help a deacon if a deacon is helping a trustee how he should be helping a deacon so we got people that got keys to open this door they got codes if you need to get in the church you need to talk to the Deacon they will tell you who got the code now I'm on YouTube I cannot give all that information it's already given it's no more than one person have keys that's all I can tell you they got code they got access everything is put order musician knows what to do technician knows what to do the musician the song leader his brother John Porter he's followed by brother said and the technician there in ladies Brother David is followed by Buddy Caleb all of that were placed here every single thing was placed yesterday so we just need names for the young sisters you know what I'm talking about so get me the name of the leaders quickly and then we move on and put everything in order amen I'm sorry it's probably the boss but he told me already what to do about music but unfortunately I could not get into the music because I don't know brother Caleb how many hours was there yesterday what three and a half hour so you know what was laid out yesterday amen so I can I could not get to music it's a very great subject and I want to go with music through the scripture first dig it through the scripture and when we moved from the scripture we go through the message of the hour then we see where is our stand so you have to be a separate time that I have to put together so if you want to know how music operate in this church and what we agree and what we do not agree welcome to come that day if you didn't come don't gossip don't criticize because you might be attacking not brother Stephen you might be attacking the word itself everybody okay and it's the devil because it's unbelievable I never felt so much attack like I felt this week and right in the middle of the service yesterday he struck my son right there unconscious almost there and thank God I got a wonderful family by the time I was sitting here continuing the meeting but the polycarp was there but Robert was there he came up he started eating and then it got worse again and brother Kelly brother polycarb took him and sister joined to the emergency room and let me continue what I had to do here everybody okay everybody okay when I got there brother Freddie was there and finally he came up and brought a polycarb head to leave and we stuck with brother Kelly and sister Joanne until we were dismissed amen and I know most of you would have done the same thing but I know if brother Kelly was standing there somehow brother John Porter is praying brother khalim is praying brother evil is praying she said so and so he's praying I knew all of you were praying that's what we call a family that's what we like and then when the D now you start getting me excited already amen when they run the test they run the blood they run the kovid Emirates whatever they call it they run everything zero [Applause] you know what the doctor said he says just a common cold you can just go home no medication nothing the body is right there this morning once again therefore you lost and you will continue to lose you're not taking none of spoken word children none of you [Applause] none of you [Applause] glory to God went to bed around three o'clock at 3 33 a phone call I look I don't even know the number so threw me off again and I woke up like uh and now almost an hour late from the time I woke up I don't know how God made it we came here before service started thank God for a good wife she didn't know that one was coming I hate it so I can amen glory to God so everything is doing good by God's grace order is put church is now said in order if you have any question Come and Talk amen now that order is put let me lay this out very easy not complicated this is what the scripture says ha when I says this I'm just getting excited okay okay all right but the Bible say in the Leviticus 19 Verse 18 that shall not do what avenge come up nor bear any water grudge against the children of the people but that shall love the neighbor as thyself I am the water lord how can we live with our bearing grudges in a church how can we do that this is the way to do it Matthew 18. moreover if that brother shall trespass against the push the break right there it means that sometimes we will do things wrong to each other because we're waiting for the Redemption of the body everybody okay so don't expect brother Caleb to be always 100 percent one day the devil can get on him let me help you spoke anyway the devil can get on the trustee the devil can get on a deacon the devil can get on a pastor I'm leaving you so it's gonna be free the devil can get on any officer or a minister it is not your brother it is not the trustee it is not the Deacon because trustees and Deacon and pastors are offices the offices that only receive human being but they can swap those human beings everybody okay by the office remain the same amen so it's possible that one of this day something wrong goes between a sister and a sister the only way that's not gonna happen is when we go to heaven when we go to heaven you will never have a brother bothering you [Applause] let me help you again okay let's uh change the cannon it is possible for your husband to do something wrong [Applause] [Music] it is possible for your wife to do something wrong so if you're expecting a 100 marriage without any problem good luck [Applause] everybody okay now everybody okay now so I got all the cleaning open okay so if that brother if that officer if the husband if the lovely wife if that body of me have done something wrong what should I do everybody okay go and tell to him his fault between you and your best body [Music] everybody okay all right call your husband quickly and tell him what happened [Music] everybody okay hey everybody okay what do you do the Bible say go and tell him the one that did what is wrong his fault between you between you and him how alone in other words when somebody done something wrong to you don't pick up the phone and call your best body don't call nobody amen number one you upset and when you're upset don't do anything okay if I don't get to my sermon it's okay let me handle this at Lisa everybody okay if your husband done something wrong to you and you're upset don't talk do you hear me do you hear me Let It Go take the car go to Food Lion everybody okay go to them all go shop [Music] we made faster your work so complicated for nothing while Pastor your work is very easy it is just a common life everybody okay so don't don't say anything zip it hush shut up depending on which way you come you understand me my heart is pure okay you go outside and let thou anger cool down and when the anger begins to cool down the Holy Spirit Will begin to talk to you and the Holy Spirit when he comes he will begin to show you that remember that's the devil there is two way you can shoot the glass and kill both the glass and the snake oh you can take the snake away and get your glass back what do you want to do everybody okay don't call nobody because once he goes to somebody else you have no more control [Applause] everybody okay because body have body you think your best body she got the best body and that best body got the best value and the best body gets the best about it and before you know it it is international let's keep it local [Applause] everybody okay so when everything is good and you go pray and the Holy Spirit sweetened your temper brother Branham say you sweeten your temper by prayer and the Holy Spirit sweetened your temple if you still feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna don't do it because you're gonna cause damage and whatever you try to say will not be received anymore to help your brother or to help your sister and once you feel peace then you say praise the Lord and then if you got a little bit more of the money you can say sister that's I cannot take you to the restaurant if you got money yeah uh if you don't have money you can just put them aside you say sister cannot talk to you you say God reach the bless you what's going on you say I'm doing fine home doing good she already knows she did something wrong she already knows she did something wrong so she's already expecting with a gun also back and back you say sister God bless you the reason why I came I just want to talk to you this is what happened you see the way you talk to me I know you didn't mean it but sometimes the way you talk could be you see what I'm saying so you talk to me I know maybe you were going through a lot of stuff at work maybe at home something is going maybe you're going through depression I don't know what's going on but I just didn't appreciate that's Highway yeah I didn't appreciate the way you talked to me the purpose the motives that you're going with is very important if the motive is wrong and the objective is wrong I'm gonna shut him I'm gonna tell him next time never again you already on the wrong round the motive you're going is to gain let me see the Bible says and if he shall heal thee that shall do what again so the motive is to gain your brother because you understand it the devil that got between you so you talk between him and you alone so far as I did if the brother or the sister or the lovely husband or the her lovely wife turn around and say I'm sorry I didn't mean to oh I'm sorry I was upset or I did it I didn't know you are uncomfortable with it you stop ready yeah do you follow me that thing is put under the blood do you follow me don't never bring that thing back again do you hear what I'm saying even if you hear that that sister has another problem do not come and say yeah she did me this again because she could be having a weakness do you follow me do you follow me bury that thing right there and even in your conversation on your marriage conversation Do not sit down and say in 1949. you remember what you did to me you need to stop those kind of stuff everybody okay everybody okay never to be brought up again and an officer in this church is not officer first his first a brother [Applause] your pastor is first there brother Branham first air so you have the right as a child of God even if enough he said do something wrong to you first of all go between you and that officer alone and deal with him if the officers say I'm sorry that thing goes under the blood and never to be brought up let me help you up and never to be brought up in the election [Music] [Applause] everybody okay because the brother corrected if he didn't correct it then you can bring it to the election you say I talked to him he's still doing it that's why I'm bringing it everybody okay everybody okay now you have the right to bring it because you already approached him first now you're coming back you say we could have a problem here somebody need to fix something here everything okay everything okay what I'm teaching you is before you bring something to a certain level make sure you went through the steps when you finish the step you have a full right to put it right there and when I'm talking to you the first question from now on uh did you talk to him did you talk to her if you say yes I talked to her what is the next step can I continue all right the next step the Bible say if he will not hear thee a stubborn then take with the one or what two more stop who do you choose your body they want that even if you're wrong he said yeah let's go get him don't get that one do you follow me do you follow me okay let me handle it with this a little bit so he can relax you oh spoken with a lovely Church among a lot of people we found well water emotions and water so so when we are living like this there will be emotions there will be feelings there will be a child crying and somebody's like its emotions ah okay don't be like why are you usually look at my child like it's emotion okay it's normal depending whether they didn't sleep or they were on Facebook till 3am so their brain is not working good so it's a problem okay emotions and then there become water darling and water can you give him some microphone there is one that usually works good that's the one okay thank you butt biting and all kind of water ungodly things brother that is water in the water sure so when we reach that point just know that you are responsible for sulfuric acid can you say Amen amen it is a water demon power when you are operating like this in the church you are under demon power pure everybody okay when I say demon power there is no exception from the pulpit to every office if you operate like this even the pastor demon power we are all in this together let me turn this way so I'm looking like the congregation that is sulfuric acid in the chain it is demon power amen amen so we are all part of the congregation everybody okay including the pastor and spirit of man and women who gets among one another and try to push off say this is not right and this is not right and that is not right if you chase it down because it's a demon power nine times out of water 10. 90 percent it is the very person making the water that is not what why so if you found yourself you start making stirs you're already out you can lose your position by doing that amen amen God hates water disco among the water so who do I call you know how to screen yourself look at somebody who's spiritual somebody who's mature in the world and say brother would you come and help me I'm just picking up brother John come and help me I have a problem I just want you to be there amen and when you talk with that brother what happened the scripture says that you tattoo that in the mouth of water and water three now you begin to get back up everybody okay you're on the second stage two or three witness everywhere may be water because when you're gonna bring your case now I have you and brother John to ask the question about that specific brother or sister whether they are officer or not but I have to witness now your case is going differently but if you cannot trust anyone according to your screening your inspection brother Branham says this in the church there is the pastor and that Pastor is water special person he's built to where he can put up with the fastest of the people that's it so when you call me you say I got a problem with my brother I get the anointing I'm already excited you say brother that I'm ready to jump because that's the way I'm built everybody okay he's a burden Bearer he is the UPS of the water see he is a man that can sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take water either side and reasoning that and bring it right back into Waters sweetness he is a pastor he knows how to take care of water things so if you talk to your brother and they don't understand and you don't see anybody else that you can always give me a call and talk to me you say I have a problem with a sister I have a problem with a brother I have a problem with an officer I will call that officer the first question did you talk to the officer say yes the next stage I say okay you and me and that officer we're gonna meet together at Chick-fil-A amen anybody okay then we can sit there and we can talk between me you and the officer and you're going to repeat everything you taught me in detail in front of the officer so he knows what he's hurting you everybody okay everybody okay don't hide anything we want to clean it up everybody okay before you and your brother repeat everything and when you repeat everything I will talk to you and we get everything reconciled and when it's reconciled right there I'm now waiting for viewing a berry right there I don't have a viewing time to call the church to view the body that have happened there I don't have viewing time I have on the barrel time so right there I opened the tomb I put it right there I put the tombstone right there and the same day I don't wait the next day I put a tombstone and I close the case everything closed and that's it and now we have again your brother we have gang your sister or whoever harm you but if you cross this stage can I continue oh my god oh and if he shall neglect to hear them then do water tell her into the church so before your pastor bring anything on the pulpit just know that I have crossed many steps okay so when something is brought up here don't try too fast and say well that was not right that was not right just know we already crossed steps amen and the person doesn't understand whether it's whoever officer or no officer I will bring it back right here everybody okay all right so from now on just know you had to be sweet and avoid this process amen and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the water church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a water hidden man and a water Republican let's work with the scripture let's operate that way from now on let's operate that way but let's do the best if the devil got on you okay and you treated somebody wrong humble yourself quickly okay when you're wrong you're wrong it doesn't make you non-Christian amen matter of fact it's a Christian that do something wrong and can go back again and say brother I'm bother because what I've done was wrong that's a Christian everybody okay and when the person come and repent he give you more confidence on that person hey everybody okay let's begin to operate that way so don't push until you get to stage number three or number four because stage number three and number four is not gonna be good because I have to lay down the whole thing right here and when I lay down I'm laying really down hey are you okay so don't push me there finish between you and your brother and sister and maybe me I don't have to know it when you and your brother and your sister you already talk among you you don't even have to tell me did you hear me when you and your sister you and your brother already talk you don't have to call me anymore right there and I will always see you that these are good friends they love one another and never know that one day you hear the misunderstanding everybody Okay we okay now welcome to spoken word Tabernacle thank you very much let's go to our scripture this morning and I appreciate everybody for their openness because I went through everyone according to the election I appreciate everybody for the openness that's the way I want when and we talk open say whatever you feel in your heart I appreciate that we want to know that and all concerns were addressed completely and or transferred everybody okay everybody okay so when I call do not hide anything talk we in a family talk amen brought them fight away everybody okay so meaning they could be a fight sometime I can go through the scripture and show you how I disciples disagree bitterly in the scripture amen Beetle filled with the spirit amen amen it happen but guess what we talk openly when you call me talk openly then I know where to administer the medication so appreciate everybody for their openness I like it always feel free to talk to one another openly amen glory to God I don't know how much time I have let's go to Romans chapter 8. these are very important principles that keep the devil outside amen and help us live like Christian like family because yesterday I was sitting people are texting my wife trying to check on the child here is brother polycarp here is brother Kelly and brother Kelly went himself outside and bought food for my children and bring food for them with his own money and give them while I'm here doing all this kind of stuff that's what we want tell me where can I find people like that nowadays foreign why do I lose you even if the devil say I say no not that one that one then we will remain friend okay I don't care we will remain friends amen because that's the person God gave me spoken word Tabernacle is not the pastor it is everybody also this church you belong to everybody so when you talk you will say my church and you loved do you hear it and if it's your church you gotta love that church and support that church like it's your church if somebody begin to talk bad about your church then you can turn around and say oh the breaker this is my chance [Music] everybody okay these are my family this is my father this is my daddy this is my mama this is my sister even if she did something wrong but me and you cannot gossip about her I need to have her back foreign glory to God Romans chapter 8 verse 10. God would never live without a witness they gotta be a church that will reflect the word of God according to the way God purposes not every Church hypocrite hypocrite no they gotta be one amen ah there gotta be one somebody is not there they call me oh God bless you she said are you doing I'm doing okay he helped the sister somebody will say they say I'm not alone amen Hallelujah Romans 8 verse 10 if you're there you can say amen amen glory to God all right let me jump to verse 11. but if the spirit of him that raised that Christ from the dead dwell in you so first of all that Spirit must dwell in you amen if you notice there is a Karma remember the scripture now even the punctuation means something so that is the first step number one that Spirit must first dwell in you if that spirit is not dwelling in you so there is no way we can continue to The Next Step the first step have to be fulfilled you might be seated if that first is that same Spirit not a different spirit not a different Spirit not a Pastore your spirit amen because I have my spirit amen you got your spirit but what make us common is one spirit and that Spirit you can find it in everybody that's the spirit that we're talking about if we dwell in you so that Spirit didn't just dwell in Christ he dwell in Christ and when Christ died that Spirit quickened crossed from the dead if he rest up cross from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that do water so the same thing that happened in Jesus Christ will happen in you if you are found on the same level on the same state on the same stage that Jesus was everybody okay verse that's verse 11 job to verse 17. and if children then air s of God and how John a we fool Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also water be glorified together so everything that happened to Jesus Christ must happen to you if Jesus suffer you might have some suffering too and if Jesus was glorified you must be glorified amen if not God doesn't need to begin a work on you when God chose you God is Doom God can come back again he cannot change his mind because God if he change his mind something is wrong with God so he didn't think correct before he make a decision so when God make a decision on you amen don't worry about the remaining everything is covered because he won't change his mind hey everybody okay Verse 18 for I reckon that the suffering of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory Remember That Glory so there is another Glory that is coming up the glory which shall be revealed where you know so there is a glory that will be revealed in The Believer it's a future Glory let's continue verse 19 the Bible says for The Agonist expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly animal didn't do anything but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of water corruption because everything is dying now the trees are dying the animals are drying the bread they're dying everything is dying into the Glorious Liberty that Liberty is glorious of the children of God verse 22 for we know that the whole creation does what groaning and travel in pain together until now verse 23 and not only day the creation the animal the bird the fishes but our self also which have the first fruit so not everybody grown those that grown have already the first fruit amen who have the first fruit of the spirit in other words there is a portion of the Holy Spirit already knew amen when that portion of the Holy Spirit already in you it puts you in the groaning process amen even we ourselves grown well within ourselves inside ourselves doing water waiting waiting for the adoption that is the Redemption of our body so we are already redeemed on the inside but the outside is not redeemed that's why we have to go through Matthew 18 when something happened between you and your brother the reason why we talk to one another is because of this flesh here the day this flesh will be redeemed no more Matthew 18. because your brother will never do something wrong again everybody okay let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15. the adoption that is ripping what the Redemption of our body First Corinthians chapter 15 if you dare you can say amen amen it's amazing have time always fly in this church you can just say one slide and it takes 30 minutes 40 verse 40 if you dare you can say amen amen there are also water celestial bodies so we have heavenly we have Celestia or heavenly bodies in other words this body comes from heaven what you have now didn't come from heaven that's why if the Lord takes somebody home we put the body back where he came from even though you think mama is the one that manufactured it no mama was pulling that body from the Earth by the food she was eating so when Mama was buying some groceries at Walmart amen and those groceries came from Alabama down there so maybe some of your parts were in Alabama everybody okay and then the Walmart took it and ship it in Gastonia because God knew that portion of that body must come from Alabama everybody okay everybody okay then Mama goes to the grocery and nobody will buy their grocery bad mama and when Mama get that groceries she begin to eat she is getting what is needed for you to manufacture you everybody okay so that body didn't come from heaven he came from Alabama everybody okay some of our body came from Africa everybody okay he was manufactured over there everybody okay because God knew that the ingredients for this man must come over there everybody okay ah Mama Gotta Eat Fufu ah to produce the body everybody Okay we okay now okay so when everything is said and done if the Lord take you before time of the Rapture then we go back to the Earth we are telling the Earth that we are returning to you what you gave it to us that's why he goes back today everybody okay now but this body here from its birth he has nothing to do with Mom and Dad [Applause] either when it's body that were made with that sex everybody okay let's continue this is the power of the the of the seals when you hold the scripture like this he begin to unfold the layers underneath it's the seals that do that he said there are also Celestial body camera and body that I have to rescue or Earthly that is what we all got here we are say let's your body and terrestrial is that the word that they use there and Terrace your meaning Earthly and to rest your body to rest your body or Earthly body amen Earthly bodies so how many bodies do we have this one came from sex everybody okay and caress your body but the glory of the celestial is what one and the glory of the terrestrial is water so everybody have a glory that's why you spend so much time before the mirror looking at the glory of the Celestia she spent so much time before the meal they look at this they look at this before you know it they take up this phone and take a selfie so that they can post on Sunday to show the glory of the Celeste of the terrestrial then before you know it you see somebody on Sunday happy Sunday did I say something wrong so everybody has a glory there is a glory of the Celestia and there is a glory of the Celestia but that Glory did thy Fair one from another amen everybody okay glory to God glorious church amen and the glory of the celestial is another job to verse 42. so also is the water resurrect the first word that brother John spoke this morning that's why song leader when they stay in tune we are matching everything amen he said and also when he says that I was like that's it song leader he's into it amen so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sun in corruption we went through this it is raised how in in corruption it is on in what dishonor it is his house Glory so the resurrection when he brings a body brother Caleb helped me the first one he brings that body Incorruptible is that what the Bible says yes corruption corruption incorruption and the second one is what in England in corruption what is the second one it is sun in dishonor it's coming out in glory and the third one is what a natural body no there is something else there weakness in weakness it is rest in water power in power glory to God and uh verse 44 it is somehow a natural body watched carefully but it is raised how a spiritual body what is a spiritual body we already know that how many body do we have one is called water so sure oh water another one is called water or for what Earthly but we say is that the scripture says that if you take the terrestrial and you bury it in the resurrection when the terrestrial is coming out it comes out and he becomes spiritual what does he mean spiritual because at the beginning it was natural now he becomes spiritual what does spiritual mean does it means that the terrestrial is now Heavenly what does it mean spiritual body one Celeste your body two terrorist your body three spiritual body everybody okay the spiritual body is different than the Earthly body in the sense of the Earthly gut weakness that's why we get sick but the spiritual have power right the Earthly get corruption the spiritual got incorruption amen amen and watch carefully now your boss just dropped this the Earthly amen the Bible says that it is it is uh it is shown in dishonor everybody okay but it is raised in water Glory but remember this also have already a glory and this also have already a water so there is the spiritual body have a glory Glory one glory to glory glory to God verse 44. I listen and nature it is a water spiritual there is a natural body and there is also a water spiritual body glory to God jump to verse 49. and as we have borne the image of the water earthy because you are born from Mom and Dad and you look this morning the way you look because of that you have a consequence right for Christian amen amen because as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the water heavily so if you are already born here and you're a child of God guarantee you must find where is this Celestial body you must be born also of the celestial body

sermon amen verse 25. husband love your wife even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the water well that he might present to himself everybody okay so God is the one doing the work so he knows what he wants that please him so he's doing the work according to his own pleasure amen everybody okay to present himself a church that is how glorious a church today you will understand that is how glorious continue my friend and what now having spot with that spot oh Winkle with a spot spot his sin right right or without what Winkle and Rico you know where you get wrinkle you know what body so the Redemption of the souls and the Redemption of the water body and what else or any such thing or any such thing but it should be have holy holy and what else without blemish without blemish amen this is the characteristic that God wants to see when God see this you qualify to unite with him in the body everybody okay as long as this is not met God have to continue to work until he reached this point amen this is the scripture you keep for this sermon okay this is your man's scripture for this sermon keep it as we're moving keep it in your mind okay first John chapter 3 verse 2. beloved now let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what you have guided us to do to the best of the ability the Holy Spirit gave unto us father I pray now that you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children be the Alpha and the Omega of this service and father minister to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen now in first John chapter 3 verse 2 the Bible said beloved so they're not talking to Sinners right he said now not in the future are we the sons of God a Son of God is someone who have the spirit of God because the spirit bereth record to your spirit that you are a child of God it's Roman 8. you know the scripture do you know the scripture praise the Lord if you don't see me after church and he do not yet so there is something like him are you following me it do not yet appear what we shall be so even though you are a child of God now everybody okay what you are now is not really reflecting what God is looking at [Applause] because some of you already got wrinkled some of you already got white hair God doesn't want to see wrinkle some of you are still struggling with certain things God doesn't want to see that so what you are now even though you're a child of God it doesn't reflect yet what you are supposed to be everybody okay everybody okay glory to God the Bible says but we know that we say knowing there is a revelation in US that when he shall water appear in other words even though today I'm not reflecting the Christian that you expect me to be amen even though today I might be lower in my Christianity than you just know one thing the day he will appear amen you're not gonna be higher than me [Applause] I don't know if you get me the day Jesus will appear it does a mother which level we are now we will be all at the same level [Applause] everybody okay so don't be complex work for your own salvation everybody okay Paul says that but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like water him do you follow me so what you are now amen it does not appear it does not reflect what you will be what you are now it doesn't look like Jesus do you follow me what you are now doesn't look like Jesus but if Jesus there to leave heaven and to come to get the bread when me and Jesus meet I will not be complexed before Jesus in other word if Jesus decide today to activate the Rapture do you follow me it means that my time to be like Jesus Christ have a Wrath everybody okay no matter which day he decide amen the day Jesus decide does embody me he knows the dead that is up to him but if he decide that this day or today I'm coming to pick up my brother it doesn't matter which level I am what I think I'm struggling with what I think I need to work on if Jesus appeared today do you follow me you follow me when I look at myself and I look at Jesus Christ we will be the same [Applause] do you follow me glory to God he said for we shall see him as hell he is so whatever happened to Jesus Christ the Jesus that is in heaven today do you follow me the way he is is exactly the way I'm gonna be when we say exactly it doesn't mean you're gonna look like this everybody okay Jesus will look like this when you see him you will look the Way You Are amen but they're looking like him means that you will have the same body like him everybody okay in other words when you touch Jesus you touch yourself everything the same he behooves us to find how is that Jesus everybody okay Paul said John say and every man that have this water hope in water him which hope this one that and no the day he will come amen me and him will look alike if you have that hope in you something happening in you everyone that have this hope in him do what purified himself am I reading a different Bible when you have that Revelation in you that Revelation is what is purifying you every day [Applause] everybody care that's the reason why you keep progressing in your Christian life because there is something in you that is working on you toward meeting the goal that God have set or meeting the expectation of Jesus Christ for his brother everybody okay he purified himself even as he's helped you my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the Redemption of the body their Redemption of the water body we found out that in the trashing floor everybody okay Boaz unfolded himself in secret and give six measures of barley which we already understood that it's the seventh seal that opened the other six seal and then that made a way for roof to rest so that boas can finish the work of redemption and Boaz return back you remember the returning and when he is returning back now he can pick up roof and both of them can be married in the threshing floor boas and roof could never have an intimate relationship in other words they could never be United in the body there could be only United in the world they can only exchange vows everybody okay but that same day in the morning maybe between seven and uh six and nine somehow I don't know amen Bowers finish the work of redemption and he returned back in the morning and went now and pick up roof and was United in the body and he produced a baby that Ruth never had before amen amen so between roof chapter 3 and roof chapter 4 there is something happening we remind we were reminded that the son of man has to form everybody okay the first form is what word and the second form is water flesh is the flesh amen so in roof chapter 3 the son of man Boaz is unfolding himself inward Ruth chapter 3 everybody okay and in roof chapter 4 Boaz finished the work of redemption now he's coming he's returning to unite with Ruth In the Flesh roof chapter 4. everybody okay and we know that the return of Boaz the return of Christ's heavy condition we saw that last two Sunday and the condition is that before Jesus Christ come back shall he found water faith everybody okay so there must be a faith first before Christ come and we found out that their faith have to come back by revelation 10. everybody okay so that the son of man will return in word form to restore the origin of Faith before the son of man come in the flesh to pick up the bread of Jesus Christ open Hebrew chapter 12. glory to God amen we're moving good my friend so relax Hallelujah if you dare you can say man you will need your scripture because we're going to climb now deeper okay it's like we're climbing but in the Revelation we're digging somewhere amen you there because somebody will say how can you climb deep okay Hebrew chapter 12 verse 2. I've been in that message for a little bit so I know how bullets come I know how I sense them and I know how uh I can shoot them down okay all right Hebrew chapter 2 verse 2 if you dare you can say Amen looking unto who Jesus who is the water and the water finisher of water our face stop I've been everybody okay before Jesus Christ shall he find Faith but that Faith nobody can give it damn it everybody okay he must be given by the son of man himself so the son of man must be the author everybody okay off the faith but he doesn't stop on being the author only he must be the author and the water finisher his offer when he's coming in Revelation 10. is to produce the faith everybody okay but he is the finisher of the faith when he is coming in the Rapture to take you up everybody okay everybody okay as the word is the author of the favor as the flesh is the finisher of the favor so he come to start the faith then he himself come to suck the faith that he already started everybody okay that's why he is the author and he is the finisher he is the alpha and he is the Omega he is the L and he is the Z he is the beginning and he is the end if he starts something he will always end it up everybody okay the author and the finisher of her faith who for the joy that was set before him enduring water the cross is passing the water and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of who God so he's the answer according to Revelation 10 to bring the faith to be the author of The Faith so the faith that we have now is that the faith of a man it is the faith of the son of man because Malachi 4 must come to restore the faith but it's not Malachi 4 because he's revealing the son of man and to the public everybody okay so Revelation 10 is the author and then the Rapture is now the finisher of the faith that he started everybody okay so far and we found out that the son of man who started the bread is the one who's gonna marry the brother everybody okay because throughout the churches the son of man was not there you remember he was the son of God open Revelation chapter one as I'm going quickly now glory to God Revelation chapter one if you dare you can say amen amen job to verse 13. you there amen and in the Beast of the seven Candlestick there was one how like he was not the son of man he was like unto the water son of man clothed with government down to his foot and gird about the best with a golden water jump to verse 14. his head and he said where white like water whoa as white as Waters no and his eyes were as the flame of water fire watch verse 15 carefully his feet like the to find water brass and it as if they burn in a furnace and his voice as the voice of water many Waters the feet of this person that is like unto the son of man his feet were alike Fine Brothers his eyes like flaming fire but he's not the son of man he is like unto the son of man amen go to Revelation 2 verse 18. man everybody okay glory to God if you're there you can say amen amen to the angel of the Church of who Tyrus tataya right this saying these things says the who Son of God not the son of man we need to know how is the son of God watch the scripture this thing say the Son of God remember in Revelation 1 it's like the son of man it's not the son of man but this clearly saved the son of God this thing says the Son of God Kama who has eyes like water flame and Fire everybody okay and feet like water fine bread but we found that in Revelation 1 the one who have eyes like flame of fire and feet like brass was like unto the water son of man now in Revelation 2 18 the Bible clearly call him the water Son of God so throughout the edge there two other two changes the son of man is not there by the scripture I already give you the message but this one seal it so throughout the seventh Church angels we don't have son of man we only have what Son of God amen everybody okay and we remember that son of man got too tattle in him son of man is also Son of God and he's also son of David So when Jesus Christ died anybody okay at Calvary and he pulled the bread out of him he was not pulling the son of David because the son of David is a king everybody okay he pulled the Son of God because the Son of God is the female version it is the brother that's why brother Branham said that man that was in the middle of the seven churches Ages was the brother it is a brand that look like the husband because the husband and the brother so the one that was poor on the day of Pentecost was the son of God not the son of man the one that came from Adam was a woman not the man the woman came out and the man stepped out that's why he fell [Applause] that's why the church fell in Asia because the main part was not there but God promised according to Luke 17 30 that in the days when the son of man everybody okay imagine what the male part of God is coming back for his blood now because the blood have suffered throughout the seven churches now the groom himself must come down everybody clear in order to defend his own Pride everybody okay have I lost someone Have I Lost somebody amen that's why we have the coming remember last Sunday of the son of man why to bring the woman the male part that she didn't have because as long as Eve is if the devil will continue to make her fall amen when you bring Adam the serpent doesn't come when the serpent comes he see if walking with Adam he goes the other way when he see Eve alone then the serpent approaches now our Adam the second and the last Adam have come down that's why this church will never fail because they ever presence help of God the ever presence God is now always with his brother he came down to be the author and when he finished he goes back and he become there all the The Finisher he's the author with his blood and he put his brother he said now come and jump and now I am the finisher of your favor that's why from start to finish this Pride won't fail because we got the devil as well we got Malachi Soul we got Luke 17 30. we got Revelation 10 one to seven the days of the son of man none of you will fail no matter what the devil did to your life he will not get you no matter how many times you fell down you will always get back up again because the husband is here glory to God glory to God so don't be discouraged keep pressing on keep pressing on the one who start the work of you will finish it all the way until the day of Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah glory be to the name of God never be discouraged he start the work he won't sleep that man brought us one sleep until he finished Redemption he won't sleep until he marry you he will make sure he does everything to make sure he can marry you not tomorrow not another age

look twice very beautiful woman when she entered you see everybody wow did you see that everybody okay everybody okay [Applause] I'm reading the scriptures everybody okay when the Bible say beautiful this is more true than our word amen a fair woman to look on therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptian shall see you that they shall say this is his wife and they will water kill me but they

that okay okay so when you you listen to the sermon too and then Sarah in her body cease to have a normal woman Circle ovarian Circle Seas everybody okay so they're coming or they return of Elijah of um sorry the return of Elohim thank you brother Michael thank you brother Caleb for giving me this that bullet is gone in Hell okay so when they when Abraham when Elohim returned back to Sarah something must be done to Sarah first do you follow me Elohim cannot return just like that Elohim needs something in the body of Sarah to determine his coming all his return if Sarah circle is not functioning Elohim doesn't know the circle of life do you follow me let me go slowly Elohim say I will return according to the time of what life but Sarah doesn't have any more time of life [Music] everybody okay so for Elohim to return Sarah must first be brought back in the circle of life [Applause] everybody okay when the circle of life the menstrual Circle begin to function then Elohim will choose which month he need to come as long as the circle is not working Elohim is blocked foreign and in order for Elohim to come back the circle of Sarah must be renewed back again in other words Sarah must be restored by the circle of life everybody okay and the circle of life the best science you would get is 28 days everybody okay everybody okay if the 28-day circle is now returning Sarah Elohim cannot come everybody okay so they're coming back of Elohim must first Hallelujah be introduced by the restoration of the 20th Circle [Applause] [Music] remember that Tabernacle curtain have 28 cubits everybody okay everybody okay and remember when this Cloud here came [Applause] he was taken on February the 28th everybody okay and remember this Cloud stuck over there for 28 minutes [Applause] February the 20th on 28th meaning minute telling you that there is something the circle of life of the brother is now back again [Applause] now everybody okay the circle of life have returned back in the brother now the bride can get pregnant [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay because he must be the author foreign [Applause] and he must come and finish the circle by the pregnancy [Music] [Applause] he must start the circle because when a woman get pregnant the circus stop so even though he must be the author of the circle and also the finisher of the circle [Applause] everybody okay so before Oh my God where did you hide yourself so before Elohim before Jesus come in the flesh amen there must be always a revelation 10 to restore the circle and Revelation 10 was fulfilled on Sunset mountain and it happened on February the 28th 28 minutes telling you the circle of life of the bread is now restored and since the circle is restored anytime from that time Elohim can come [Applause] he might come in the first Circle or in the second Circle that is up to him but as long as the circle is activated Elohim can come anytime the baby can come anytime [Applause] how was that Circle restored because when Malachi 4 come he shall restore their faith faith how was the circle of Sarah restore we ready this church the Bible said Roman 4 and being not how we in faith he considered not his own body now how dead that's Abraham when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the water deadness of who Sarah's womb so Sarah womb was dead nothing dead how did she get the circle back you ready you ready Malachi 4 come to restore water Faith how did Sarah got the circle back Hebrew 11 through water faith through water Faith also Sarah herself did water we see receive water strength in other words she receive a power foreign never changed just like that there was a face that was given to Sarah to do something in Sarah there was a restoration of the faith when the first come he opened the menstrual circle of Sarah everybody okay everybody okay so through faith also Sarah herself did what received shrink to do water conceived and was water delivered delivered of a child when she was water because she judged him how faithful who had the water promise in the Old Testament he looked like Sarah doubted everybody here and she laughed when Elohim did that amen amen and brother Branham say God could have killed him amen but because of Abraham God could not do what that's why God cannot do anything to you even when you messed up oh everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why somebody messed up they get in a car accident they kill you messed up you don't get car accident if you're getting currency then you will come up and laugh everybody there do not you because Elohim understood the weakness of Sarah and he have to restore the fifth to Sarah and that faith that was given to Sister Sarah have to now open the circle of life to bring Elohim back everybody okay everybody okay job uh let's go to Genesis 20. oh God now my time is running out I have a lot amen let's go to verse 20. are you there amen remember in Genesis 12 Sarah beautiful she get in the city everybody accidentally on the highway boom boom boom because Sarah is in the city in Genesis 18 it's a grammar with PhD no more accident on the road the road the highway traffic is good let's see what happened in Genesis 20. we there we there first one and Abraham Journey from there towards the water South Country and dwell between the between kaddesh and sure and sojourn anywhere interior and Abraham said to Sarah of Sarah his wife she is my water sister stop this talk happen when Sarah was how beautiful but in Genesis 18 Sarah was what grandma now in Genesis 20 Abraham begin the same speech again grandma look good how can grandma look good looking good with wrinkle 90 years old and and Abraham is afraid what happened everybody okay everybody okay and Abraham say of Sarah his wife she is my water sister and abimelech who in Egypt who took Sarah king Pharaoh right here who also targets Sarah so how is Sarah here now so something happened to Sarah because the position goes away she always goes to King King only King that's why we are only married to the king [Applause] our caliber is to the king [Music] we always match with the King [Applause] no less than the king everybody okay glory to God he says and sin and the king of Gira said and took who Sarah the same thing that happened in Egypt job to verse 5. she said he not to me this abimele talking to God she is my water sister and she even she herself say he is my water brother in the Integrity of my heart and innocency of my hand have I done water yes in other words say I call both of them I asked this one he said that's a brother I asked this one that's a sister that's why I couldn't help it didn't marry a grandma because the same language came back again in other words Sarah in 20 is nasira in 18 between 18 and 20 are you following me there is a seventh seal that was silence yes okay and the Seven seal could not be open that's why the seven seal is quiet that's why whatever happened there is quiet there is a revelation 10 7. that gave Faith to Sarah and that fifth chance Sarah but it's all sealed it is quiet it is a silence in the Scripture it is a seventh seal that is hidden rather that's why brother Branham said from James said to Revelation the seventh chill is hidden it is a secret coming that have happened there that the scripture cannot show you but you will see just the aftermath are you following me are you following me job to verse uh job to verse 10. Lord help me with time and abimelech said to Abraham what saw you that you have done this thing and Abraham say because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will do others slay me for my water well I've said they will save him for a grammar when it happened it because grandma was looking good everybody okay glory to God uh that's verse uh uh 11 job 2 verse 12 and yet indeed she's my sister she's the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my water wife and he came to pass when God calls me to wander from my father house Genesis 12. that I said to her this is your kindness which you show to me at every place where we shall come say of me he is my water brother that happened when Sarah is Young and beautiful and very fair not when Sarah is grandpa is Grandma everybody okay everybody okay let's go to Genesis 21. first one everybody okay when Sarah received strength by faith when the son of man came by word when Revelation 10 7 is now revealed in Sarah now the condition of Elohim is met [Applause] Faith he must find the circle of life working now Elohim can return Genesis 21 verse 1. and the Lord did whatever [Music] after the circle is back [Music] after the restoration of the circle after Revelation 10 after number 28 now the Lord has visited Sarah as he had housed and the Lord did to Sarah as he has what spoken so Sarah did water conceived now he's finishing he was the author now he's now finishing conceived and brought Abraham his son in his water this old age is not the body [Music] everybody okay everybody okay can you look at Grandma and say she's beautiful the Bible says she was well stricken in age Sarah was old on the east side 90 years old was still the Sarah inside but the cellar outside was no more 90 years old foreign because Grandma cannot have a baby she needs stress to conceive everybody okay and all that and set at the set of time with who had spoken to who we don't know that time we don't know the coming but somehow something must happen for that to happen everybody okay let's go to Second Thessalonians then I saw quickly all right it's amazing this church if you dare you can say Amen you there second Thessalonians chapter one glory to God now we understand Sarah must receive something Amen in order to come Revelation uh oh I'm sorry for second Thessalonians chapter one let's go to verse seven if you dare you can say amen amen and to you who are trouble rest with us when the who Lord Jesus shall be how revealed not coming remember the revealing of the son of man shall be revealed from water heaven with who is mighty Angel so who who's gonna reveal Jesus in heaven can you answer me who will reveal Jesus in heaven one Angel how many so there will be a group of angels which we don't know the number and that group of angels will reveal Jesus Christ in heaven so we must see a Jesus in heaven so we must look at heaven and see Jesus by that Jesus have to be revealed by many angels everybody okay what happened to that picture over there amen is that they have another it's in heaven okay and in heaven what happened Maddie and Jack came down how many enter came seven which is more than one which is plural and when does Angela gather up together like this actually they must reveal who Christ when we look at that picture who do you see Christ when you look at this picture who do you see Christ so what happened on Sunset Martin it is the fulfilling of second Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 10 when the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is revealed from heaven with Mighty Angel how can this be a rocket even if we dump how can a rocket form exactly what we have here and it have to happen on the 28th day and he have to stay there for 28 minutes and people believe it it's a Faith from hell amen verse 8 in Fleming how fire taking how then he must be a judge you remember in Luke he was a judge and the widow woman taking Vengeance on them that no not God and that obeyed not the gospel of Our Lord who Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his water power watch number one Jesus is he revealed in the heaven by Mighty Angel we found it everybody okay watch verse 10. when he saw what come everybody okay so there is a revealing an air coming it's all over the scripture about it everybody okay so the revealing is done by Maddie Angel and revealing his coming as water the word listen to this brother Branham but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bread is how see you in with who Christ the water last member has been watered everybody okay the six seal has no water produced itself there's seven still bring him back where to the Earth the servant seal will bring him back on Earth when the last member is house we did [Music] which year is this one if this happened on Sunset Mountain how are you safe today how are you safe today because they're coming the sevenths here bring Christ on the Earth when the last elect is how redeem and now the six seal is water it's up because Moses and Elijah need to go back to the Jews remember last Sunday amen if this happened in sunset Mountain how are you Christian today so we have been in uh 70 years of tribulation but tribulation is only three and a half a year so what happened on Sunset Mountain amen because the seventh seal has three things the seven sillies a triangle you have the third pool he have the seven Thunder and he has the coming of the Lord and brother Branham said this last settlement the coming of the Lord will not reveal only at that time so the third pool and the Seven Thunder are first revealing restoring the circle of life they are first restoring the faith they are giving Sarah the faith to open the circle they are fulfilling Luke 18 the son of man must find faith when they finish founding Faith then the last element of the seventh seal which is the coming of the Lord now will bring our husband back now to come to pick you up when the last he left is how we dim and we are all still in class [Applause] any question verse 10 when he has come to be how glorify in his water did you see that so there is a revealing first then Jesus will be glorified in the sand and Romans say there is a glory that will be revealed in us but that Glory must wait for the son of man to First reveal himself in heaven when he's revealing in heaven when the circle of life have opened now God can come and be glorified in US everybody okay verse 10 when he shall come to be glorified in his water Saints and to be how admire in all them that do water believe not only us everybody from Paul from Iranians all of us must wake up and Jesus have to look at you and say oh this is me that look like me that look like me that look like me he's admiring himself [Music] everybody okay everybody okay he's admiring he said because of the testimony Our Testimony among you was believed in that water they dropped to verse 12. that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be how glorified in Jesus again in who you remember Jesus said father glorify that name that was him now his name is not glorifying him it's now glorified in US everybody okay glorify in you and you in half him according to the grace of our God and the Lord who Jesus so now we understand that before Sarah can change everybody okay something must happen first a faith must be restored to Sarah first in order to restore the circle of life when the circle of life is restored then now God can come anytime in other words Jesus will not come if you are not ready yet when Jesus come it means that you are ready you are well done the fire have cooked you well you are well well well done you are ready to be eaten by the master that's when he can come he won't come if I'm still under the fire I still have to remove some red some red here some red here some red until I get well done [Applause] everybody okay don't think about the steak yet everybody good brother Branham saying yeah the bride will be gathered together in a while one place that is true but not until the water Resurrection for we which are alive and remain unto the water coming of the lord we which are in love and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent our water those which are water I sleep I sleep how universally for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall do it right and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord where in the end therefore the bride will be all together when he goes to meet the Lord see he will be together but he don't necessarily mean they all have to be setting in water one place you know we don't all have to be in Jeffersonville [Applause] for the rapture you just need to be in the message and the message is crushed if you are in Africa in South America in Europe in North Carolina in Tennessee wherever you are we need to see you in Christ [Applause] then every prayer that you are will we all go together and meet in one place what did you believe my friend let me continue he says what because the bread is sleeping in the dust of the water Earth how Around the World Around The World from the water okay to the water from the water is to the water from the water no way to the water that's why the Rapture is universal not in one place everybody okay Sarah was it up the Lord Jesus Christ will be coming one of these days you know I think it shall be how sudden and how good so sweet and there shall be 100 and 100 percent of the whole world will water never know when the Rapture take place it shall go so how quietly that nobody will know how nothing about it everybody okay stand there and let's push that is all we care to know God promises how is he going to be I can't tell you but God said so he will send who Jesus Christ the water second time he will come in the physical form not sunset Mountain he would do whatever claim his own there will be 100 000 here Millennium went upon this water with me with him with the water with him that is what he promised and we are looking for that hour to do whatever which year is this one glory to God the next things that happen is when it's all gathered up into how one person who's that person Jesus Christ and the water body and the physical we turn return return of the Lord Jesus making three times when he was brought on Earth killed crucified raised up manifesting himself in the form of his body which is his blood the woman you gather she's part of his body the woman and a man is just so close together till they are just almost there there saying they ought to be any hard they are see they just exactly manifested the water the same she is how part of him because she was water taken out from him and the bride today is taken out from the body of who Christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said he will do for this day the water why the water Queen Queen Sarah always Target to the king that queen king and who Queen everybody okay hang on let me see where I am oh my God how the church ought to be waving its hand in glory thanking God thanking God any minute the church could water come for the Bible say it will be how Universal there will be two in the mail grinding I shall take one and do water leave one two in the field that shall take one and do what leave one two in the bed showing it will be on both side of the earth while it's a night on one side be there on the other I shall take one and do what the Rapture will be how Universal and their bodies will be our body will have to be changed we just can't turn back to young men and women all right now it's a different level Sarah was turned back to a young woman in top of us right but Sarah died everybody okay Sarah died do you follow me Sarah could get sick but this Sarah of the enter amen amen is a difference here if God only renew our body it doesn't do much because we can get Coronavirus because we can die because we can grow older again because if I put you here and I take my hand off you're gonna hit the ground because gravity is still having power on you we need a body that can withstand the forces of gravity we need a body that coronavirus can be dancing around and it doesn't do anything we need a body that me and Satan can look and I'm laughing and Satan doesn't know what to do everybody okay everybody okay that's why brother Branham say if we get we get turned back young and women or men again we got to have a water different kind so you can be how car in the air to receive the water promise son if they turn you back again you cannot be caught up you too heavy everybody okay you're too heavy you need the body that look exactly like you are amen but when they pull you up you can fly like a bird buy you not a ghost foreign do you understand what I'm saying that body right here if I give you a hamburger you will eat if I pull you up I take my hand you're on the ground but that body if I give it a hamburger it will also eat but if I put that body here I take my hand off that body still remaining here what kind of body is that how do you get it everybody okay so we can be God that is what the church is what waiting for now the true water sure we are waiting for something that will do something to our body until we still human but we can vanish what happened my friend let me go with something if I touch this you're gonna get in uh into deep stuff let's go to Matthew 28. and then I will leave Matthew 28 as a foundation so you can ruminate before this is coming up is gonna change your way of thinking stuff amen amen let's go to Matthew 27. actually Matthew 27 and then I'm going to stop here because my time is gone Matthew 27 because if I touch what is there it is uh deeper than you think everybody okay when we see him we must see him and be like him amen amen we must see him and be like him how did he get to be like that because Jesus was human Jesus was eating they killed Jesus amen how did Jesus turn to be flying in the air and get into a cloud and disappear and they can give him a sandwich he can eat how did it happen amen Matthew 27 then I stop here let's go to verse 50. 50 if you dare you can say amen amen Jesus when he did what cry out when he cried again we say what love voice he yield up the ghost so there is a shot okay okay there is a cry or a shout that Jesus laid out Jesus the man the son of man as a man amen amen my glory to God and he yielded up the ghost in other words he died and behold

earthquake what happened the Rocks did what everybody okay so the shout of Jesus when he came out amen he calls the Earth to shake everybody okay everybody okay and when the earthquake that shout was so powerful until it struck rocks and rock splits [Music] everybody okay let me help you up a little bit the Lord himself shall do what with the water we okay now let's continue now I love this church
