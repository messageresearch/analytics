[55:33] we thank you for coming Lord father into
[55:35] this appointment and Lord we are human
[55:38] being very limited to our own ability
[55:41] being through the weeks with a fight

[56:08] beginning and the end of this service in
[56:10] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's
[56:14] go to the book of Psalm chapter 82 again
[56:18] still there by God's
[56:22] grace amen amen glory to God
[56:28] since the opening of the seals the Bible
[56:32] became a new
[56:35] book
[56:36] praise God
[56:42] hallelujah
[56:44] amen let's keep those two by God's grace
[56:48] jop to verse six if you can trying to
[56:52] save time because we got to get into
[56:53] deep stuff amen verse six the Bible says
[56:58] I have said we already pray now so we
[57:01] good I have
[57:03] said ye are
[57:06] gods and all of you are children of the
[57:10] most
[57:13] high but you shall die like men and fall
[57:19] like one of the princess you might be
[57:21] seated the first thing here is God
[57:25] declared that we are Gods amen amen and
[57:30] the second thing God is saying that we
[57:33] will die there is
[57:35] death like man this man refer to human
[57:41] being amen and fall like one of the like
[57:45] the princes amen if you notice God come
[57:50] first then human come after are we
[57:54] together so before you were human you
[57:57] were
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:00] gods are we together there is a reason
[58:03] why God started by gods first then human
[58:07] amen amen so your first existence
[58:10] started as a
[58:12] God Amen and then you become human in
[58:16] other word God is talking to his
[58:18] children that remember you are God but
[58:21] you would die like human in other word
[58:22] one of this time one of this day you
[58:25] would drop down on Earth and you going
[58:28] to experience death are we together this
[58:32] is not strange language because the
[58:35] problem that we have as human being is
[58:38] how can a God
[58:41] die amen how can a God die amen if it's
[58:47] a God we're looking at somebody who's
[58:49] Eternal Immortal amen but how can a God
[58:53] die it's a god combined with death he
[58:56] doesn't make sense it looks like some of
[58:58] the light are off whoever is back there
[59:00] if you can work it up amen let's stay
[59:03] clear that part so let me handle the
[59:05] devil
[59:08] amen glory to
[59:11] God all right everything is okay stay on
[59:14] the scripture all is well by God's grace
[59:16] amen it looks like brother BR uh uh the
[59:20] Bible is showing us here that we are God
[59:22] but we die like men so the problem is
[59:25] how can God
[59:28] die this thing this thing here happened
[59:32] to the Lord Jesus
[59:37] Christ amen I'm waiting on this the
[59:41] devil is really fighting but by God's
[59:44] grace I'm going to preach this
[59:49] sermon and somebody will be
[59:52] delivered I'm just waiting for the
[59:54] projector
[59:57] have you seen this before because he
[1:00:00] knows what is coming
[1:00:02] up
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:07] amen glory to God it's a good
[1:00:13] son okay the lights are back let's go
[1:00:17] with a projector and let me know when
[1:00:18] it's
[1:00:20] back if not you're going to work with
[1:00:23] me because I have everything
[1:00:28] here I just want you to see what I'm
[1:00:31] reading so we can read
[1:00:36] together you let me know when you're
[1:00:38] ready do you want me to exit and then do
[1:00:41] it again praise
[1:00:45] God all is
[1:00:51] well whenever you ready if you can pull
[1:00:55] the screen back so I can put it
[1:01:00] up
[1:01:06] there praise
[1:01:09] God all
[1:01:12] right can I
[1:01:16] go not yet just check somebody's hand
[1:01:20] say God bless you everything is good
[1:01:28] you want me to unplug the
[1:01:33] USB I did unplug the
[1:01:39] USB let me plug it back
[1:01:52] again we
[1:01:54] good the US is back
[1:01:58] again let's see if I can pick it
[1:02:07] up technology won't stop me from
[1:02:09] preaching I just want to see I want you
[1:02:12] to see what I'm
[1:02:14] preaching I already pull it up so it's
[1:02:17] depending on you if it's not I'm move
[1:02:20] on all right the Bible says that there I
[1:02:24] have said Year God
[1:02:27] and all of you are children of the most
[1:02:29] high amen so in verse six we are gods
[1:02:34] and in verse seven we die like a man
[1:02:36] there is a problem right there how can a
[1:02:38] God die like a man are we together now
[1:02:42] on my first slide you might see this
[1:02:44] later in John 5:8 you can take note for
[1:02:49] those who want to take note amen the
[1:02:51] Bible say in verse 18 therefore the Jews
[1:02:56] sought the more to kill him I'm talking
[1:02:59] about Jesus because what I say is
[1:03:02] whatever uh uh this question about a god
[1:03:06] dying is not strange because Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ was God and Jesus died and as far
[1:03:14] as the deity of Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:03:17] says in the Book of John Chapter 5 Verse
[1:03:20] 18 therefore the Jews sought the more to
[1:03:24] kill him because he not only has broken
[1:03:29] the Sabbath but said also that God was
[1:03:34] his
[1:03:35] father are we together let's go to John
[1:03:38] chapter 5 so we can all read together we
[1:03:42] going the old
[1:03:44] way I'm going to unplug the USB and you
[1:03:48] let me know when you're ready
[1:03:52] amen amen if you dare you can say Amen
[1:03:56] John
[1:03:57] 518 the Bible says therefore the Jews
[1:04:00] sought the more to kill him because he
[1:04:04] not only had broken the Sabbath but said
[1:04:07] also that God was his father so the fact
[1:04:12] of saying that God was his father was a
[1:04:15] problem follow me
[1:04:17] carefully why K making himself what
[1:04:22] equal with God equal with God
[1:04:45] Bram said that Adam and Eve were
[1:04:50] equal Amen brother Bram say if was coal
[1:04:56] with Adam he changed after the fall but
[1:05:00] before the fall Adam and Eve were the
[1:05:02] same in other word the one who can be Co
[1:05:06] equal with a man is his
[1:05:12] wife so the bride and chist are Co equal
[1:05:17] that's why Jesus say when you brde pray
[1:05:21] you tell God call God our father because
[1:05:25] when you calling God our Father you are
[1:05:28] approaching God as the second part of
[1:05:31] God in other word when you come before
[1:05:34] God In Prayer come to God as a brad as
[1:05:38] one that is equal with
[1:05:43] him spoken bad we are not
[1:05:47] Pentecostal God is not here and I'm here
[1:05:50] I'm talking to my husband I'm talking to
[1:05:54] my groom I'm talking to the one from
[1:05:57] where I came from him and me we are
[1:06:01] one when you pray you talking to your
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:08] husband what can't the sister talk to
[1:06:10] her husband
[1:06:15] trembling if that's the case something
[1:06:17] is wrong when you talk to your husband
[1:06:20] you are fine you can even put your hand
[1:06:23] on him and then it's plain your
[1:06:26] situation because your desire will go to
[1:06:30] [Applause]
[1:06:37] him are we together are we together are
[1:06:42] we together how can a God
[1:06:47] die now we found out that Jesus is God
[1:06:51] yet Jesus
[1:06:53] died so death doesn't change the fact
[1:06:57] that Jesus is God that's right let's go
[1:06:59] to First John 5 I had the scripture on I
[1:07:02] was trying to save you sometime let's go
[1:07:05] to John chapter
[1:07:07] 5 uh chapter 5 1 John chapter 5 verse
[1:07:12] 20 amen amen we are message believer my
[1:07:16] friend we are not Pentecostal or
[1:07:19] Presbyterian we need to believe the eag
[1:07:22] food
[1:07:25] and this is not even a quote this is a
[1:07:27] simple Bible but it turns to become new
[1:07:31] because of the message because the
[1:07:33] breaking of the seals make the Bible a
[1:07:35] new book are we together let's go to
[1:07:39] First John chapter
[1:07:40] 5 verse 20 if you dare you can say amen
[1:07:44] amen let me know when to connect my
[1:07:46] friend 1 John 5: 20 the Bible says and
[1:07:51] we know that who the Son of God this is
[1:07:54] where we got a problem when we say the
[1:07:57] Son of God we looking at the father and
[1:07:59] a son the Son of
[1:08:05] God Amen we understand we know that the
[1:08:09] Son of God is come that's Jesus
[1:08:13] Christ the son means he has a father but
[1:08:17] we just saw that the father and the son
[1:08:18] are one that's why Jesus say I and my
[1:08:22] father we are one and the Jews pick up
[1:08:25] the stone and say uhuh uh uh uh uhuh in
[1:08:27] other way they understood what he
[1:08:30] was if he was Gentile we
[1:08:51] didn't go to hell you need to have this
[1:08:54] right here
[1:08:56] God cannot have this so they took Jesus
[1:08:59] Christ and they wrap him around like
[1:09:02] this and then they send him to hell and
[1:09:05] when the devil open the door the package
[1:09:08] open up and when he look he said ah not
[1:09:12] this one that's why brother Bram say he
[1:09:15] beat the devil and took the keese and
[1:09:18] remov it from there and kick him in the
[1:09:21] back and turn the door back because
[1:09:24] Christ went to heav
[1:09:33] are we together are we together are we
[1:09:37] together what I'm trying to establish
[1:09:40] right here is to make you understand
[1:09:42] that don't be afraid when they say you
[1:09:44] are God and you will die like man and
[1:09:48] you will fall like men I mean princess
[1:09:51] in other word it's normal
[1:09:56] for you to go through what you want if
[1:09:59] Jesus ever remain on the throne it would
[1:10:02] be different but he became like one of
[1:10:05] us so that in
[1:10:07] everything he can be the high priest the
[1:10:12] true Kingsman Redeemer somebody who
[1:10:15] understands you in every
[1:10:22] aspect Jesus is divine so are you yes
[1:10:25] sir Jesus human so are you yes sir Jesus
[1:10:30] 100% Divine so are
[1:10:33] you 100 humans so are you he died you
[1:10:38] are subject to
[1:10:41] death the same way you woring about Sin
[1:10:44] he also carry our
[1:10:46] sins so what's the difference between
[1:10:49] you and
[1:10:51] him what is the difference now if I tell
[1:10:55] you he's God you say if I come back to
[1:10:58] you I say you are
[1:11:03] God now I showed you that everything
[1:11:06] that happened to him happened to
[1:11:08] you and matter of fact he went to well
[1:11:11] you will never go to hell
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:25] I don't think I don't know if I will
[1:11:27] preach even what I want to
[1:11:29] preach this is Christ this is you way
[1:11:33] way way way down here right this is
[1:11:36] Christ this is you way way down here so
[1:11:39] we expect this one to be always the
[1:11:42] top right this one is always higher
[1:11:46] that's our human conception but this one
[1:11:48] say the works that I
[1:11:50] do that's
[1:11:53] right I don't know if if you understand
[1:11:56] this one say the work that I do you will
[1:11:59] do it also even
[1:12:02] how how can you do something greater
[1:12:05] than Jesus
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:09] Christ is my Bible different than yours
[1:12:12] no how can you do something greater than
[1:12:14] Jesus
[1:12:16] Christ how do you do
[1:12:19] it that's why brother I'm say notice
[1:12:21] when he created when he was human thing
[1:12:25] he have to take a substance to make
[1:12:28] something and brother say now watch when
[1:12:31] we are creating we don't need
[1:12:34] anything
[1:12:38] Hall in other word when you say God is
[1:12:42] your father you are equal with
[1:12:49] God what else do you want me to tell you
[1:12:52] because you can do bigger things than
[1:12:54] Jesus Christ
[1:12:56] in other word when they look at your
[1:12:57] Miracle it's bigger than Jesus but Jesus
[1:13:00] Is
[1:13:02] God who can do things bigger than
[1:13:08] God so if you're doing things bigger
[1:13:10] than God who are
[1:13:14] you I'm asking you a question who are
[1:13:19] you you are who

[1:15:53] 20 I already connect
[1:15:57] Ed Revelation chap
[1:16:06] 20 stay really really connected this is
[1:16:10] deep stuff Revelation chapter

[1:16:59] minute let me exit out of

[1:17:05] reason why it's acting up like this the

[1:17:42] time if this popped up so everything
[1:17:44] else is
[1:17:48] there Revelation chapter 4
[1:17:59] Revelation
[1:18:07] 44 let me start with two so it makes
[1:18:11] sense in Revelation 4 verse 2 the Bible
[1:18:15] says and
[1:18:17] immediately I was in heaven I was in the
[1:18:20] spirit and behold a what how many
[1:18:24] Thrones do we have
[1:18:27] there there is only one
[1:18:30] Throne follow me carefully my friend
[1:18:34] only one Throne only one that's why the
[1:18:38] Bible say a a throne a a
[1:18:44] singular only one
[1:18:47] Throne are we together amen he said
[1:18:50] there is one Throne was set in heaven
[1:18:53] and one sat on the water thr how many
[1:18:57] people are sitting there
[1:19:00] one one person sitting
[1:19:04] there oh glory to God now jum to verse
[1:19:09] four glory to
[1:19:21] God if you there you can say amen amen
[1:19:24] the Bible say and run about The
[1:19:28] Throne where how many 4 and 20 seats
[1:19:32] that word sit means
[1:19:36] Throne I don't know why they put sit
[1:19:38] there so we got one throne and we also
[1:19:43] have what 24 24
[1:19:48] Throne these Thrones are called seats by
[1:19:52] the correct translation is throne
[1:19:55] amen we got 21 4 and 20 seats and upon
[1:20:00] the seat I saw how many Elders 24 so we
[1:20:04] know who's sitting
[1:20:06] there so the throne got someone there
[1:20:10] the 24 seats or Throne got people there
[1:20:13] it's only 24 are we together 24 ERS amen
[1:20:20] 24 Elder sitting clothed with white rmen
[1:20:25] and they had on their head on their head
[1:20:28] crowns of what gold so we clear here
[1:20:31] that this is what we have if you go
[1:20:34] through the remaining of the scripture
[1:20:36] there is no more
[1:20:41] Throne amen there is no additional
[1:20:44] Throne because the remaining is the the
[1:20:47] four beast and everything else so in
[1:20:50] heaven follow me carefully the total of
[1:20:53] Throne we have in is
[1:20:58] 25 are we together beside 25 there is no
[1:21:01] more Throne follow me carefully my
[1:21:04] friend now let's go to Revelation
[1:21:11] 20 oh Lord
[1:21:26] glory to God if you dare you can say
[1:21:29] amen amen Revelation
[1:21:31] 20 let's go to verse
[1:21:34] four if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:21:38] the Bible say and I saw
[1:21:44] Thrones many Thrones we need to know how
[1:21:47] many are
[1:21:48] there but remember in heaven it's only
[1:21:51] 25 so there is one8 throne and there are
[1:21:56] 24
[1:21:57] Thrones so the only plural Thrones we
[1:22:01] know in heaven is only 24 that's right
[1:22:04] and the Only One Singular Throne we know
[1:22:07] in heaven it's only one a throne are you
[1:22:11] are we together are we together now the
[1:22:14] Bible say there are
[1:22:17] Thrones how are those Thrones plural sir
[1:22:22] or according to revelation for plural in
[1:22:26] heaven it's how many
[1:22:29] 24 let me help you because somebody
[1:22:32] would say brother stepen that's an
[1:22:34] interpretation let me make a difference
[1:22:36] for you are we
[1:22:39] there jop to I inan Revelation uh 20
[1:22:44] right here verse 4 let me see if I can
[1:22:47] pick it up right here uh job to verse uh
[1:22:52] 11 so we can make sense for
[1:22:58] you you there and I saw a
[1:23:04] singular are we together I'm reading the
[1:23:06] Bible I saw a singular great what white
[1:23:11] thr so there is a one again and there
[1:23:14] are Thrones plural now we understand
[1:23:17] that this a throne
[1:23:20] here looks like
[1:23:23] what it say great white thr a great
[1:23:27] white one amen now we understand that
[1:23:31] the great white one we need to know
[1:23:32] who's sitting there the Bible says and I
[1:23:35] saw a great white Throne come and him
[1:23:39] only one person that sat on it from
[1:23:43] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[1:23:47] away that must be only God and there was
[1:23:51] and there was found no place for who
[1:23:53] them so we confirm that the throne that
[1:23:56] we saw in Revelation 4 is a white throne
[1:24:01] and there is only one person that is
[1:24:03] sitting there that's
[1:24:06] God we together but we got Thrones here
[1:24:10] that are plural or we already eliminated
[1:24:13] one Throne there is only 24 remaining in
[1:24:19] heaven I'm going to show you who you are
[1:24:22] we clear let's go back now to verse one
[1:24:26] again Lord help me
[1:24:34] Hallelujah verse uh one uh verse uh four
[1:24:38] and I saw Thrones plural and they that
[1:24:42] sat upon them there were people there
[1:24:44] that already sitting and judgment was
[1:24:47] given to them and I saw the
[1:24:50] souls of them that were who beheaded so
[1:24:54] there are people sitting on Thrones and
[1:24:57] they are also
[1:25:01] souls are we together please follow me
[1:25:04] this is not easy stuff we got people
[1:25:08] sitting on
[1:25:11] Throne on Thrones which we would
[1:25:14] determine how many are there but we got
[1:25:16] also
[1:25:18] Souls amen let me read it again because
[1:25:22] we want to make sure you can get it the
[1:25:24] Bible says and I saw Souls I saw Thrones
[1:25:29] and they that sat upon them and judgment
[1:25:31] was given to them and I saw the souls of
[1:25:36] them that were beheaded for the witness
[1:25:40] of Jesus so these are
[1:25:44] Christian we clear now these are
[1:25:47] Christian these are not the Jews the Jew
[1:25:49] is is is a testimony of God but not
[1:25:52] Jesus amen he said the witness of Jesus
[1:25:56] and for the word of God Amen and which
[1:26:00] had not worship the Beast
[1:26:02] amen neither his image neither had
[1:26:06] received his Mark upon their forehead or
[1:26:11] in their hand and they live and
[1:26:14] Rain the souls those Souls lived and
[1:26:20] reign with Christ how many years a
[1:26:23] thousand years so Jesus Christ doesn't
[1:26:25] Reign himself in the
[1:26:28] millennium are we together so this
[1:26:31] Millennial Reign it is crushed with
[1:26:36] somebody amen and the word
[1:26:41] rain amen am speak of somebody who is a
[1:26:49] king are we together because Christ is
[1:26:53] the king and he's reigning but Christ is
[1:26:56] not reigning
[1:26:58] himself he's reigning with
[1:27:04] somebody let me read it again he say and
[1:27:07] day we on verse four amen and they lived
[1:27:12] and Reign they live and reign with who
[1:27:16] Christ so Christ is reing with somebody
[1:27:20] and Christ is the kingh and somebody's
[1:27:23] reing with him who is that person hold
[1:27:26] off my friend I know where you can go
[1:27:28] with me let's go slowly he said they
[1:27:30] rain with Christ how many years a
[1:27:33] thousand years which is the Millennium
[1:27:35] jum to verse
[1:27:37] five if you thereare you can say amen
[1:27:39] amen the Bible says in verse five he say
[1:27:43] but the rest of the Dead live not
[1:27:46] everybody else that was dead they live
[1:27:49] not again until the what thousands years
[1:27:52] so everybody else was not there
[1:27:54] he was only Christ with the his people
[1:27:57] amen this is until the thousand years
[1:28:00] were finished this is the first what
[1:28:04] Resurrection
[1:28:06] blessed and what holy is
[1:28:10] he that has passed the
[1:28:14] what the first resurrection happened in
[1:28:17] the
[1:28:20] Rapture are we together are we together
[1:28:24] are we together so only those that go in
[1:28:27] the Rapture will be in the
[1:28:33] Millennium Hallelujah and they will
[1:28:36] reign with
[1:28:39] Christ Hallelujah we together are we
[1:28:42] together they say and they will be uh
[1:28:46] verse six blessed and holy is he that
[1:28:48] has part in the First Resurrection on
[1:28:50] such the second death has no what power

[1:32:36] when he T the people that I'm going to
[1:32:37] die they say wait a minute who is the
[1:32:39] son of men we understand that now right
[1:32:42] he say and the son of man shall sit in
[1:32:45] the Throne of his what Glory so the son
[1:32:49] of man is sitting in his throne the son
[1:32:52] of man
[1:32:54] has a throne and we know that there is
[1:32:57] only one a throne and that's where the
[1:33:00] son of man is we need to know they other
[1:33:02] the people amen and the son of man shall
[1:33:05] sit in his throne of Glory of his glory
[1:33:09] Kama Watch the Throne of his
[1:33:12] glory amen the Throne of
[1:33:15] what the Throne of
[1:33:18] who his glory remember in John
[1:33:22] 17 you remember remember the prayer of
[1:33:24] Jesus Christ he said father the glory
[1:33:27] that you have given me I have also done
[1:33:30] what remember that my friend and the
[1:33:33] Throne of his glory let's go now to
[1:33:35] verse uh uh we are still there come you
[1:33:40] also shall sit
[1:33:43] upon 12 Throne judging the 12 tribe of
[1:33:47] what Israel so we understand here that
[1:33:50] out of the throne we already have 12 and
[1:33:52] brother expl to us that the 24 Throne
[1:33:55] are the 12 Apostle and the 12 patriarch
[1:33:59] are we clear together follow me
[1:34:01] carefully I'm going to separate those
[1:34:03] Throne let's go to the Book of Luke
[1:34:06] 22 I had all the
[1:34:10] scripture let's go to the Book of Luke
[1:34:12] 23 uh
[1:34:14] 22 praise God Luke
[1:34:18] 22 Luke 22 verse 29 if you dare you can
[1:34:22] say Amen
[1:34:24] amen Luke
[1:34:28] 22 glory to
[1:34:31] God verse
[1:34:33] 29 you there amen Jesus said and I
[1:34:38] appoint you a kingdom amen as my father
[1:34:43] has appointed me has appointed to me
[1:34:48] am amen that you may
[1:34:51] eat and drink are we together at my
[1:34:56] table in my kingdom and sit on
[1:35:03] Thrones plural are we together did he
[1:35:07] say 12 he says what Throne so when we
[1:35:12] say Throne it doesn't mean there is no
[1:35:14] number that's right because Revelation 4
[1:35:17] already told us it's 24 are we together
[1:35:21] and then you shall sit on throne
[1:35:24] judging the 12 tribe of what Judah the
[1:35:28] 12 tribe of what Israel of Israel so we
[1:35:31] found out that the disciple will be
[1:35:33] sitting on the throne and the disciple
[1:35:36] are part of the
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:41] Bride but they have individual
[1:35:45] Thrones and the patriarch have
[1:35:47] individual throne but there is a
[1:35:50] category of people that reign with
[1:35:52] Christ but where are they
[1:35:57] sitting that's where we heading now
[1:36:00] let's go to First Corinthians
[1:36:02] 6 stay with me my friend 1 Corinthians
[1:36:07] 6 Oh Glory to
[1:36:10] God first Corinthians 6 if you there
[1:36:13] let's go to verse
[1:36:20] two I always have a backup my friend
[1:36:26] amen 1
[1:36:28] Corinthian 6:2 if you dare you can say
[1:36:32] amen amen the Bible says
[1:36:37] this glory to God do you not know that
[1:36:42] the Saints plural how many are there
[1:36:45] plural Saints plural amen the Saints

[1:36:53] are we together sir and if the word
[1:36:56] shall be judged by

[1:37:16] Angels give me a minute my
[1:37:19] friend seems like this thing is working
[1:37:21] now he said no you not that we shall
[1:37:25] judge Angel how much more things that
[1:37:28] pertain to what this life so we find out
[1:37:31] that the Judgment of this world will be
[1:37:34] done not only by Jesus Christ himself
[1:37:37] but somebody else will judge the Earth
[1:37:40] amen and the one who will judge the
[1:37:42] Earth right here are also Saint
[1:37:48] am are we
[1:37:50] together let me see if he pops up again
[1:37:54] let's see if this will work my
[1:37:57] friend glory to God
[1:38:00] one let's go with the second one and
[1:38:03] then see if it
[1:38:05] works glory to God that's the hardest
[1:38:09] one
[1:38:10] amen we understand that now let's go to
[1:38:13] Revelation three
[1:38:15] now that's it it worked that's it my
[1:38:19] friend now let me start firing now
[1:38:22] differently
[1:38:25] are we together are we together this is
[1:38:28] everything I was giving you so whoever
[1:38:30] was getting tired wake up let's do our
[1:38:33] job now we I gave you all of this and I
[1:38:37] gave you this now amen now let's go this
[1:38:40] is where we are my friend 1 Corinthians
[1:38:43] 6 we in Revelation 3:21 the Bible said
[1:38:46] to him that do what overcometh will I gr
[1:38:49] to sit with me in what my Throne if that
[1:38:53] is is that Throne singular or plural
[1:38:57] singular are we together now are we
[1:39:00] together now are we together now Jesus
[1:39:04] didn't say I will make them sit in
[1:39:07] Thrones let's go back my friend Jesus
[1:39:11] did say I will make you sit on Thrones
[1:39:14] you will sit in m and there is only one
[1:39:18] my Throne which is a throne a white
[1:39:22] great throne
[1:39:26] so so these Thrones right here are 24
[1:39:31] Thrones because in heaven it's only 24
[1:39:34] and one these have the disciple and the
[1:39:39] Apostle and there is only one Throne
[1:39:41] that is remaining and somebody is
[1:39:44] already sitting there but where are we
[1:39:46] going to seat it seems like every seat
[1:39:49] is
[1:39:50] empty but now Jesus say you see where
[1:39:54] I'm
[1:39:56] sitting there is still a
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:03] slot are we together not a different
[1:40:06] Throne not you going to sit in a throne
[1:40:10] beside me that is

[1:40:20] one atone the aone have somebody sitting
[1:40:23] there who is the son of man and he's
[1:40:26] already sitting there but Jesus said you
[1:40:30] will sit with
[1:40:33] me are we together are we together not
[1:40:37] in
[1:40:38] 24 that was for the disciple not for us
[1:40:41] for us we will be sitting with him in my
[1:40:46] Throne follow me carefully my friend we

[1:40:58] and I'm set with my father in what his
[1:41:01] throne he say him and the father are
[1:41:05] sitting on the throne but when we look
[1:41:07] at the throne we see one person and the
[1:41:10] one sitting there is the son of man
[1:41:13] that's why Jesus say I'm praying father
[1:41:16] that as me and you are one I want them
[1:41:20] also to be one amen so that where I am
[1:41:24] they might be with
[1:41:27] me I don't know if you get what I'm
[1:41:30] saying Jesus say him and the father are
[1:41:34] sitting on the throne our cor man say
[1:41:37] two people are sitting on the throne
[1:41:39] that's not the truth when we look we see
[1:41:41] one person sitting in other word him and
[1:41:44] his father are one now Jesus said father
[1:41:47] you know how me and you are one I'm
[1:41:50] praying that this also G be one with
[1:41:55] you amen and they will sit with me on

[1:58:15] Malachi talking amen and it's God in
[1:58:19] Malachi rebuking the people amen you

[1:58:38] Sinners amen it is in event that we
[1:58:41] serve God and what
[1:58:44] prophet is it that we have kept his what

[1:59:15] how in other word they were going
[1:59:19] through hard time
[1:59:24] they were going through
[1:59:26] trials when we say Moon F we are talking
[1:59:30] about
[1:59:32] crying are we together so it seems like
[1:59:36] these people were servant of the
[1:59:40] Lord keeping God's ordinances but
[1:59:44] suffering and crying every day and going
[1:59:48] through so many trial until the pressure
[1:59:51] of the the
[1:59:52] trial the pressure of the of the test
[1:59:56] the pressure of the tribulation begin to
[2:00:00] make them speak certain things that are
[2:00:06] foolish and when God heard

[2:09:20] because of them
[2:09:22] conversation but the god who's reaching
[2:09:24] Mercy sent the word and the prophet
[2:09:27] corrected them and when the prophet
[2:09:30] corrected them and they went back to
[2:09:32] land then God went into his

[2:09:43] book of
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:47] remance where are we at my friend oh

[2:09:54] verse 17 and they say be and they this

[2:10:01] what mine say who the Lord of hosts in
[2:10:05] that day when I make up my Jewel I will
[2:10:07] spare them as a man spare his own son
[2:10:11] that did what serveth him then shall you

[2:10:19] discern means distinguish
[2:10:22] distinguish between the what the
[2:10:24] righteous and the wicked between him
[2:10:26] that do
[2:10:27] what serve God and him that do what Ser
[2:10:31] in other words God say don't worry now
[2:10:34] now you're going to see a
[2:10:37] difference between who serve God and who
[2:10:40] doesn't serve God because you begin to
[2:10:42] look at the the men in the world and you
[2:10:45] thought he was more happier now let me
[2:10:48] bring the book of remembrance
[2:10:51] when that book come it's going to do
[2:10:53] something in your
[2:10:56] life what is the book of remembrance oh
[2:11:00] the book of
[2:11:01] memory father I don't know what to do my
[2:11:05] friend let's go BR I'm say I'm repeating
[2:11:09] this now because I'm dropping higher
[2:11:11] deeper there was a time you
[2:11:15] know your mind is darkened to that now
[2:11:19] because remember you were first God then
[2:11:21] when you become human flesh you went
[2:11:24] blank there is only been one man on
[2:11:27] Earth that knew that he was before and
[2:11:29] that was who Jesus he said glorify me
[2:11:33] Father amen with the glory that I had
[2:11:37] with you before what the foundation of
[2:11:40] world because Jesus never lost his
[2:11:44] memory do you follow me never dementia
[2:11:48] never
[2:11:49] Amnesia he says he was the
[2:11:53] Incarnate he could move back there and
[2:11:56] know what he was but our man our what
[2:12:00] blackened glory to God my friend put
[2:12:03] your seat belt if we have confessed that
[2:12:07] what he is we been in what his presence
[2:12:10] and we have confessed our sins they are
[2:12:13] done what bottled out
[2:12:24] oh Lord have
[2:12:26] mercy so all that the devil was doing is
[2:12:29] to waste
[2:12:30] time so I don't get where I was trying
[2:12:33] to go amen so the memory of God is a
[2:12:41] book now spoken word when we say book I
[2:12:46] know what come in your mind is the
[2:12:48] Bible is something like this but relax
[2:12:51] with me my
[2:12:52] friend amen amen relax with me my friend
[2:12:58] that book we seen it's called The Book
[2:13:00] of memory or the book of what
[2:13:03] remembrance brother Bram says here that
[2:13:07] God Amen there is nobody but God can
[2:13:10] what do that now you can do anything to
[2:13:13] me I shall do what forgive you the older
[2:13:17] brother but I will do what remember it
[2:13:20] if I do anything to you you do what
[2:13:23] forgive me but you shall do what
[2:13:25] remember it but God can do what forgive
[2:13:29] and forget it so what is impossible to
[2:13:33] us it is possible with God think on that
[2:13:39] don't even what remember it that makes
[2:13:41] me feel how good when it's not even what
[2:13:45] remember anymore it doesn't make brother
[2:13:48] BR feel good to only be forgiven
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:54] but what makes brother Bram feel good is
[2:13:58] that God don't even
[2:14:04] remember what is a
[2:14:06] memory memory follow me my friend is the
[2:14:11] faculty of the
[2:14:13] Mind by which
[2:14:15] data
[2:14:17] information record is in
[2:14:22] store and
[2:14:24] retrieve when it's needful for future
[2:14:30] decision if you didn't hear me let me
[2:14:32] raise your hand so I repeat
[2:14:34] again memory is the faculty of the
[2:14:39] Mind by which
[2:14:41] data records
[2:14:44] information events are encoded they are
[2:14:49] store and don't information can be
[2:14:53] retrieved when it's needed on the
[2:14:56] purpose of influencing a future
[2:15:05] decision I was suffering brother Greg
[2:15:09] help me he goes to the memory and the
[2:15:12] memory store brother Greg with
[2:15:16] help tomorrow brother Greg is suffering
[2:15:20] before make my
[2:15:24] decision follow me carefully I'm
[2:15:26] retrieving anything that is connected to
[2:15:29] Greg when he comes he shows me the
[2:15:33] kindness of Greg and based on the
[2:15:35] kindness of Greg I make decision now how
[2:15:39] to react toward brother
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:45] Greg where is the word memory in the
[2:15:49] Bible where is the word memory the
[2:15:52] Bible where you speaking about memory
