[40:50] this evening and I just tried to follow
[40:51] it out by the grace of God and and I
[40:53] would like to speak on the power of our
[40:56] confession confession the power of our
[40:58] confession Amen in Hebrews 2 and
[41:02] 17 it says wherefore in all things it
[41:04] behooved him to be made like unto his
[41:06] Brethren that he might be made a might
[41:09] be a merciful and faithful high priest
[41:13] and things pertaining to God to make
[41:16] reconciliation for the sins of the
[41:18] people in Hebrews 4:5 it says for the
[41:21] word of God is quick and powerful and
[41:25] sharp than any two-edged sword piercing
[41:28] even the dividing suer of the Soul and
[41:30] Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and
[41:33] it is a zerner of the thoughts and the
[41:35] intents of the
[41:37] heart I apologize I had that wrote wrong
[41:39] there but that's you know what I'm
[41:41] talking about
[41:42] amen neither is there any creature that
[41:45] is not manifest in his sight but all
[41:47] things are naked and open under the eyes
[41:49] of him with whom we have to do seeing
[41:52] that seeing then that we have a great
[41:55] high priest that has passed into the
[41:57] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[42:00] fast our profession for we have not a
[42:03] high priest which cannot be touched with
[42:05] the filling of our infirmities but all
[42:07] but was in all points temp tempted like
[42:10] as we are yet without sin Let Us
[42:14] therefore come boldly amen unto the
[42:16] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[42:20] and find Grace to help us in the time of
[42:23] need that's right Amen Let Us bow our
[42:25] heads for a moment Heavenly Father Lord

[44:31] little thought Lord that that might

[45:29] out Lord Clean us out father if we need

[45:58] this service tonight Lord and we'll give
[46:00] you all the honor and glory in Jesus
[46:02] name amen you may be seated the power of
[46:05] confession now in Hebrews 3:1 it says
[46:07] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[46:10] Heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[46:12] and high priest of our profession Christ
[46:14] Jesus now brother brandom says he's the
[46:16] high priest of our what our
[46:19] confession Hebrews 3:1 now he's sitting
[46:21] at the right hand of the father to make
[46:24] intercession Upon Our confession see
[46:26] we've got to believe it accept it and
[46:29] confess it and he's before the father to
[46:31] make good anything my he's before the
[46:35] father to make good anything we confess
[46:37] in the Redemptive blessings of course
[46:39] now Jesus said whatsoever things you
[46:41] desire When you pray believe you receive
[46:44] them and it shall be given to you is
[46:46] that right and very verily I say unto
[46:48] you if you should say this mountain in
[46:51] your heart be plucked up and Cast Away
[46:53] or removed and doubt it not but but now
[46:56] watch but believing that those things
[46:58] which you sh say shall come to pass
[47:00] you'll have it see whatsoever he saith
[47:02] see whatsoever you confess if in your
[47:05] heart tonight if you're dying with heart
[47:07] trouble if you've got cancer if with the
[47:10] appropriated faith if you believe with
[47:12] all your heart and just something is
[47:15] anchored there that says I believe Jesus
[47:17] Christ I believe him with all my heart
[47:20] and I now accept him as my healer and
[47:22] believe that he heals me and from your
[47:24] soul believe that say I am healed he
[47:27] said let him that's weak say I am strong
[47:29] see just say in your heart that I am now
[47:32] strong I have now accepted Jesus as my
[47:35] healer and never have any negative
[47:38] testimony anymore so you can't just
[47:41] Proclaim this and still have the the the
[47:43] negative rotten attitude that you have
[47:45] but you have to have a you can't have
[47:47] that negative testimony anymore you just
[47:49] believe God and God I love this God is
[47:52] under obligation Jesus Christ is sitting
[47:55] at the right right hand of the father to
[47:57] accept you for he's sitting there the
[48:00] high priest of your confession amen see
[48:03] we're not just talking to anybody here
[48:05] but we're talking to the Son of God our
[48:07] high priest for your confession to make
[48:10] good before the father anything that he
[48:13] died for that you're confessing that
[48:15] he's done wow there you are now Divine
[48:18] Healing cannot be any pler than that
[48:21] it's to the weakest you can do it
[48:23] remember God's word will defeat Satan
[48:27] anywhere any place any time under any
[48:30] condition so you can say tonight it
[48:32] doesn't matter how I'm feeling it
[48:34] doesn't matter what I'm going through as
[48:36] long as I still got the word of God I
[48:39] still have victory tonight now listen
[48:41] I've got a few quotes here he said now
[48:42] here's what it is friend see if you get
[48:45] it you're a Christian because you
[48:47] believe that you're a Christian right
[48:50] and it's all settled because he's a high
[48:52] priest now notice he's the high priest
[48:54] of your confession that's right you get
[48:57] what I mean what you confess is what you
[49:00] are that's it what you confess is what
[49:03] you are that's what you are any man will
[49:06] never live any farther or any higher
[49:10] than what he believes he is living now
[49:13] listen I don't know where you're living
[49:15] you know where you living you know where
[49:17] you are with God and your confession is
[49:20] actually where you are with God whatever
[49:22] you confess is where you will be with
[49:24] God amen amen now listen what brother
[49:27] ROM says here he says and when when the
[49:30] inspiration of the holy spirit is here
[49:32] to inspire you remember God will make
[49:35] your body come into your confession now
[49:38] listen he's going to go into the
[49:39] negative side here he said if you say
[49:41] you're a drunkard and want a drink don't
[49:43] worry you'll soon be one that's right if
[49:46] you say you're a sinner and want to sin
[49:49] well you'll be right into it right you
[49:52] see because the power of your confession
[49:54] is going to control what you are you
[49:56] can't help it what you go through life
[49:58] confessing is what you're going to be
[50:00] and I might get a little ahead of myself
[50:02] but I don't know where I'm going
[50:03] anywhere so let's just preach but you
[50:05] see whatever you begin to confess you
[50:07] wake up and and you go through life and
[50:09] you get to work and there's that
[50:11] coworker it's old Negative Nancy and
[50:13] every time you're around them they have
[50:15] nothing good to say and you know what
[50:17] they've got nothing good to produce
[50:19] because they're whole confession is is
[50:21] my life is bad and this is wrong with my
[50:23] life and that's wrong with our and you
[50:25] know what that is what's wrong with
[50:26] their life because that's the power of
[50:29] their confession that's exactly right
[50:32] preach my brother but I want to say by
[50:34] the grace of God yes sir if we can look
[50:36] in the natural of things and we can
[50:38] begin to look at the people around us
[50:40] and and we can begin to look at
[50:42] so-called Negative Nancy and we can see
[50:44] by the power of their confession that
[50:47] they can have a bad day I say how much
[50:49] more tonight by the power of the Holy
[50:51] Ghost can Sons and Daughters of God have
[50:54] a positive confession and Believe on God
[50:57] Almighty that we have an high
[51:00] priest that can be touched by the fing
[51:02] of our infirmities brother says if you
[51:04] say you're a Christian and believe it
[51:06] all along your testimony will bring you
[51:09] right into it if you believe in healing
[51:11] and believe that God has healed you
[51:13] confess it and God will make your body
[51:17] obey your confession that's right for
[51:20] he's the high priest of your confession
[51:22] sitting at the right hand of the father
[51:24] now with his own blood Amen to make
[51:28] intercession for any confession upon
[51:30] anything that he died for and he died to
[51:34] rid sin and sickness in the result of
[51:36] sin he was oh he died to rid sin and
[51:39] sickness in the result of sin and
[51:41] brother brandham says he was wounded for
[51:44] our transgressions with his strapes we
[51:46] are healed remember that have faith
[51:49] don't wav or stand on I think many times
[51:52] the problem with our confession is it's
[51:54] nothing more than a 22nd confession we
[51:57] don't really believe what we're standing
[51:59] on but if we really believe God and have
[52:02] a confession that we're standing on the
[52:04] high priest's words that we're standing
[52:07] that whatever he said must come to pass
[52:10] amen that's when the body will begin to
[52:12] obey the word of God amen amen amen
[52:16] glory to God remember brother Brandon he
[52:18] he in in his earlier life and throughout
[52:20] most of his life he had a an issue of
[52:23] his stomach where he couldn't eat things
[52:25] and and he said as soon as a real
[52:27] genuine Christian faith anchors in a
[52:29] person's heart let them be bound in a
[52:31] wheelchair blind whatever it is they
[52:33] tell it that's right I'm Healed right
[52:36] right not not not before a manifestation
[52:40] but the confession that drops down in
[52:42] the heart of a believer that will begin
[52:44] to confess that I'm Healed yes sir how
[52:47] do you know you are Jesus said so and I
[52:49] believe it there you are yes oh I like
[52:52] to throw that in the devil's face I say
[52:54] not if there's ever a people that should
[52:56] throw something in the devil's face look
[52:59] where God's brought you from look where
[53:01] God brought you out of look how God's
[53:03] took care of you I think there ought to
[53:05] be some people that aren't ashamed to
[53:08] confess almighty God In This Place amen
[53:11] amen yes there you are oh I'd like to
[53:13] throw that in the devil's face when he
[53:15] stood there at mayos the mayos them
[53:17] group of doctors around me Reverend
[53:19] brandom you're finished but he said
[53:21] Jesus said I'll heal you Hallelujah I
[53:23] took him at his word yes he hates me I
[53:26] know he does speaking of devil he said
[53:29] but Christ loves me because he redeemed
[53:31] me all right yes I like to push that
[53:34] back in him every time I get the chance
[53:36] he said you don't feel any better than
[53:38] you ever felt now listen brother
[53:39] brandham said when he was going through
[53:41] this trial and a different quote he said
[53:43] he would confess that he was healed and
[53:45] he would go to eat a meal and he would
[53:47] swallow that meal and they said that'll
[53:48] kill you and he swallowed it anyway and
[53:51] it be to drop down into his stomach and
[53:53] they say how you feel he said I'm
[53:54] feeling great he said I had to swallow
[53:56] it back down but over and over and over
[53:58] he confessed it until the very day that
[54:01] he received his healing to the very day
[54:04] that the body obeyed the word of his
[54:07] confession yes my brother yes sir
[54:10] Hallelujah I took him out his word yes
[54:12] sir when I come out of there I said oh
[54:14] boy if you want to hear me praise God
[54:16] stick around you'll hear me yes sir I'm
[54:19] going to tell you this I think was
[54:21] Apostle Paul said therefore I'll rather
[54:23] glory in my infirmities knowing that the
[54:25] the power of Christ May rest upon me
[54:27] I'll tell you what if there's ever a
[54:28] time you should be thankful when you're
[54:31] going through the trial you should be
[54:32] thankful when you're going through the
[54:34] test cuz you can lift up your hands and

[55:15] I can for Christ promised it hallelujah
[55:18] it's mine I believe in it Christ died
[55:21] that I could have that privilege amen
[55:24] amen and today I stand still on it
[55:26] Hallelujah yes sir mine because he gave
[55:29] it to me he died and he sent the Holy
[55:32] Ghost to persuade me to take it and it's
[55:35] mine it's yours church tonight do you
[55:37] not realize that Faith cometh by hearing
[55:39] and hearing of the word of God and when
[55:41] you have that Holy Ghost on the inside
[55:43] of you even though the flesh says I
[55:45] don't know if I can do it and even
[55:47] sometimes the spirit gets soow down and
[55:48] low but down in the soul there's a real
[55:51] genuine seed of almighty God that it
[55:55] can't be defeated it can't be dismayed
[55:58] even though you might have had a bad day
[55:59] at work even though you might have a lot
[56:01] of things going on wrong at home there
[56:03] is still something a deep colar to the
[56:06] Deep there's something on the inside of
[56:08] you that says I'll praise God no matter
[56:10] what I'll praise him anyway I'll praise
[56:13] him through it it's your
[56:15] confession yes my brother
[56:18] yes glory to God now yes sir brother bam
[56:24] says
[56:25] now he can't do nothing for you until
[56:29] you confess it amen amen
[56:33] amen I'm just going to be straight
[56:36] tonight you know we can't be the church
[56:39] member that comes and Crosses his arms
[56:40] and say God bless me if you
[56:42] can God we can't be the church member
[56:45] that comes and and just sits there and
[56:47] say well I wonder if brother Steven's
[56:48] going to preach tonight or or or a
[56:51] visiting Minister and if they do I hope
[56:53] they preach good enough to get me a
[56:54] little bit excited you will never get
[56:56] anywhere with God under that expectation
[56:59] you will never get anywhere with God
[57:01] like that because what first you have to

[57:13] the Holy Spirit I'm going to get a
[57:15] refilling of the Holy Ghost That Old
[57:17] problem that was bothering me it's going

[57:21] priest that can be touched by the
[57:22] feeling of my infirmities and he said
[57:24] when I pray to him he would answer me
[57:27] but it's got to start with the right
[57:29] attitude it's got to start with the
[57:31] right confession it's got to start with
[57:34] sons and daughters of almighty God
[57:36] believing he's still God and a rewarder
[57:39] of those that diligently diligently
[57:43] diligently seek Him am am
[57:47] am he can't do nothing for you amen amen
[57:51] until you confess it is that right for
[57:53] he is the high preach he says
