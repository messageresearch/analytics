[37:59] God, take the service now in your hands
[38:01] and all the other requests that went

[57:26] just get right into the word of God.
[57:28] Let's have a word of prayer and we'll
[57:30] get into the scripture. If you have an
[57:31] unspoken request, you can acknowledge it
[57:33] to the Lord with an uplifted hand. Let's
[57:37] just bow our hearts to the King.
[57:44] Lord Jesus, Father God, as we truly know
[57:47] and believe that we're in divine
[57:49] presence, Lord, we lift our hands to
[57:51] you, Lord, in faith, Lord, knowing that
[57:54] you have an allseeing eye on every need,
[57:58] Lord, on every desire in this room
[58:00] tonight. And Father, we just pray, Lord,
[58:02] that you would help us not to crave
[58:04] anything that you don't have for us,
[58:06] Lord. Lord, help us not to desire
[58:09] anything or want anything that's not of
[58:11] your perfect will. And Lord, let us be
[58:13] content with what you have for us, Lord.
[58:15] And and look for that which what you
[58:18] have, Lord, to be perfected in our
[58:20] lives, Lord. And we pray the blessing of
[58:22] the kingdom upon this church, Lord, upon
[58:24] the families who are here, every
[58:26] listener that may be connected to this
[58:29] to this ministry, Lord. And we just give
[58:31] you all the honor and glory, Lord.
[58:32] Forgive us for our sins and trespasses,
[58:34] Lord. The areas in our life that no one
[58:37] else sees but you, Father. Keep us under
[58:40] your atoning blood. Amen. In the
[58:42] wonderful and precious name of Jesus
[58:44] Christ, we pray that church say amen.
[58:46] Amen. Somebody say amen again. Amen.
[58:49] Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's
[58:52] turn to uh Romans chapter 12.
[59:00] Romans chapter 12. And then we're going
[59:02] to go to Mark 5. Yes, sir. Amen.
[59:11] Romans chapter 12. Yes, sir. Let's just
[59:15] start reading at verse one.
[59:17] If you have it, say amen. Amen. The
[59:20] Bible says, "I beseech you therefore,
[59:22] brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
[59:25] present your bodies as a living
[59:27] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[59:30] which is your reasonable service. and be
[59:34] not conformed to this world, but be ye
[59:38] transformed by the renewing of your
[59:40] mind. Yes, sir. That ye may prove what
[59:44] is that good and acceptable and perfect
[59:48] will of God. The only way you're going
[59:52] to look for that is to have your mind
[59:54] renewed.
[59:56] It says by the renewing of your mind.
[59:58] Yes, sir. Verse three, it says, "For I
[1:00:00] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:00:04] every man that is among you, not to
[1:00:07] think of himself more highly than he
[1:00:10] ought to think, but to think so
[1:00:13] soberly." According as God hath dealt to
[1:00:17] every man the measure of faith. That's
[1:00:20] right. Hallelujah. Let's go to uh Mark
[1:00:23] chapter
[1:00:24] 5.
[1:00:26] Uh Mark
[1:00:35] 5. Let's start reading at verse
[1:00:38] 24. Mark 5 and
[1:00:43] 24. The Bible says, "Yes, sir." "And
[1:00:46] Jesus went with him, and much people
[1:00:48] followed him and thronged him. And a
[1:00:51] certain woman which had an issue of
[1:00:53] blood 12 years and had suffered many
[1:00:56] things of many physicians and had spent
[1:01:00] all that she had and was nothing better
[1:01:04] but rather grew worse. Now look it it it
[1:01:08] didn't say that she suffered of
[1:01:10] believers.
[1:01:12] Her her war wasn't against the church
[1:01:14] people. No sir. But just a natural
[1:01:17] answer looking for a physician or this
[1:01:20] one to take care of it. The Bible say
[1:01:22] she grew worse. That's right. The answer
[1:01:26] is not always in man. Amen.
[1:01:31] Verse 27.
[1:01:33] When she had heard of Jesus came in the
[1:01:35] press behind and touched his garments,
[1:01:38] for she said, "If I may touch but his
[1:01:41] clothes, I shall be whole." And
[1:01:42] straightway the fountain of her blood
[1:01:45] was dried up and she felt in her body
[1:01:48] that she was healed of that plague.
[1:01:53] That's right. Amen. May the Lord have a
[1:01:54] bless reading of his word. You can have
[1:01:56] your seats by the grace of God. Amen.
[1:01:59] Praise the Lord. I trust that everybody
[1:02:01] is doing well tonight. Tonight by God's
[1:02:04] grace, I want to encourage you. Amen.
[1:02:07] Amen. Hallelujah. Because the word of
[1:02:08] God is is what we have. Church, every
[1:02:12] day we get up, we should feel inspired
[1:02:16] because God has given us something that
[1:02:18] the average person in the world doesn't
[1:02:20] have. The average person in church
[1:02:23] doesn't have But God has revealed what
[1:02:26] we have unto his elected lady.
[1:02:29] Hallelujah. To the apple of his eye.
[1:02:32] Amen. Hallelujah. So we are to feel
[1:02:36] privileged. Amen. But you know uh today
[1:02:39] my subject is a measure of faith.
[1:02:42] Hallelujah. God has given us a measure
[1:02:45] of faith. But let's look at it for a
[1:02:48] second church. Hallelujah. I want to
[1:02:49] start with with reading you a quote. And
[1:02:52] when it comes when it comes to faith,
[1:02:54] you know, a lot of times we put it on a
[1:02:57] manifestation that somebody else had.
[1:02:59] No, we're not doing that tonight.
[1:03:03] We not going to I'm not going to measure
[1:03:05] God by what he did in your life. I'm
[1:03:08] going to measure God by his word.
[1:03:11] Hallelujah. I'm going to measure him by
[1:03:14] what he said in his word because his
[1:03:17] word cannot change. And if he gave me
[1:03:20] his word, I got a right to see every
[1:03:23] word fulfilled in my life.
[1:03:27] Hallelujah.
[1:03:30] Glory. So that's what I want to measure
[1:03:32] my faith by. Hallelujah. And if I
[1:03:35] measure my faith by the word, all of the
[1:03:38] word has been revealed.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah. So we don't have a a a faith
[1:03:48] that's in part anymore.
[1:03:51] Hallelujah. It say for we we we the
[1:03:54] scripture says we understood in part and
[1:03:56] we done this in part. But when that
[1:03:58] which is perfect is come, that which is
[1:04:01] impart is done away with. So we,
[1:04:04] hallelujah, as believers should have,
[1:04:07] uhoh, we out here now. I might as well
[1:04:09] step on out here. We should have perfect
[1:04:12] faith.
[1:04:15] Hallelujah. A faith that can make a
[1:04:18] mountain in your life move.
[1:04:25] I'm not talking about crumble away. I
[1:04:27] said move. The Bible didn't say crumble
[1:04:30] away. It said move.
[1:04:36] He said if you believe in your heart and
[1:04:38] don't doubt that mountain shall move.
[1:04:41] God has gave us a measure of faith that
[1:04:45] can move a mountain.
[1:04:53] in the house.
[1:04:55] Yes, sir. Listen.
[1:04:58] But when it comes to faith, Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] The Bible says without faith, it is
[1:05:03] impossible to please the Lord. So, you
[1:05:08] can't even get God's attention unless
[1:05:10] you got faith. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:05:14] Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] Without faith, it is impossible to
[1:05:17] please the Lord. Amen. And the Bible
[1:05:19] also says that he's a rewarder of those
[1:05:22] that diligently seek him. You know, when
[1:05:25] you seeking after something, that means
[1:05:27] you believe in it.
[1:05:29] That's right. Hallelujah. When you
[1:05:32] looking for something, that means you
[1:05:34] believe in it. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[1:05:37] Hallelujah. Glory. Listen, church. I
[1:05:40] want to read read you a quote. Yes,
[1:05:41] Lord. This is in a message proving his
[1:05:45] word.
[1:05:47] That's pro his word.
[1:05:50] Yes sir. Listen. Yes sir. If his
[1:05:54] children will only take his word. So he
[1:05:57] can prove it by you.
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:05] How is God going to prove his word? By
[1:06:07] you.
[1:06:09] Hallelujah. He said that's the only way
[1:06:12] he can prove his word. He doesn't prove
[1:06:15] it to unbelievers.
[1:06:17] They can't be proved. They are
[1:06:20] unbelievers.
[1:06:22] But it's not to it's not to unbelievers.
[1:06:27] It's not to it's not for unbelievers.
[1:06:30] It's to him that believes. And if he can
[1:06:34] find somebody who will believe his word,
[1:06:38] he will prove his word by you.
[1:06:42] So I'm saying tonight, find what you
[1:06:45] need in the word.
[1:06:47] Find your situation in the word and I
[1:06:50] guarantee you God will prove his word.
[1:06:54] Hallelujah. He says, "Try me and see if
[1:06:58] I won't manifest it. See if I won't
[1:07:00] prove myself."
[1:07:03] But the only way we're going to get
[1:07:05] there is if first we believe.
[1:07:10] [Applause]
[1:07:13] Glory to God. Glory to God. He doesn't
[1:07:17] prove his word by unbelievers.
[1:07:19] So if there's something in the Bible
[1:07:22] you're looking for God to do, you must
[1:07:24] first believe that he can do it first.
[1:07:27] That's why the prophet came back and
[1:07:28] preached a message called believe it
[1:07:30] thou this. Hallelujah. Not that, but
[1:07:34] this. See, we're walking in truth right
[1:07:37] now. Believe it thou this. I believe
[1:07:41] that he's risen.
[1:07:45] Listen church. Hallelujah. See, faith is
[1:07:49] the substance of things hoped for, the
[1:07:51] evidence of things
[1:07:53] not seen. Now we ask the question, how
[1:07:57] can something not seen be evidence?
[1:08:00] Because the evidence is you believing in
[1:08:03] those things that your natural eye can't
[1:08:05] see.
[1:08:07] So you are actually living in an unseen
[1:08:10] realm.
[1:08:15] Woo.
[1:08:16] The Bible said Abraham was looking for a
[1:08:19] city,
[1:08:21] hallelujah, that wasn't built by the
[1:08:24] contractors of North Carolina or South
[1:08:27] Carolina, but he's looking for a city
[1:08:29] whose builder and maker was God himself.
[1:08:34] See, his faith was in a whole another
[1:08:36] strategy.
[1:08:39] He wasn't looking to pay a bill on a
[1:08:42] house.
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:48] Where's your faith? He wasn't looking to
[1:08:51] pay a car note.
[1:08:56] That's right. He was looking to live out
[1:08:58] the promises of God. God never promised
[1:09:01] me a house note.
[1:09:06] See, I want to I want to the prophet of
[1:09:08] God say, "Let's get some of the unbelief
[1:09:10] out the church and let's step into
[1:09:12] something real." See, some of y'all are
[1:09:15] asking God to bless you with a house and
[1:09:17] you looking for a house, though. But the
[1:09:19] Bible says, "Honey, you live in houses
[1:09:21] that you didn't
[1:09:28] build. You eat out of vineyards you
[1:09:31] didn't plant. That's where my faith at.
[1:09:34] I ain't looking for FHA loan. I ain't
[1:09:37] looking for a conventional loan. I'm
[1:09:40] looking for that house God promised me.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah.
[1:09:50] Let's stop putting God in this natural
[1:09:53] color realm
[1:09:56] and let's get up here where the faith is
[1:09:58] perfect.
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:04] church. But the Bible says, hallelujah
[1:10:08] in Romans, he says, "For I say through
[1:10:12] the grace given unto me to every man
[1:10:15] that is among you, not to think of
[1:10:17] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:10:20] think, but to think soberly."
[1:10:25] Yes, sir. See, I ain't losing my mind
[1:10:28] when I say God can bless me with a house
[1:10:31] without a car note, without a house
[1:10:33] note. I'm sober. I ain't drunk. I know
[1:10:37] what I'm talking about. I've seen my God
[1:10:40] do it. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Come on,
[1:10:43] man. I've seen my God do the impossible.
[1:10:46] When my credit score wasn't nothing, God
[1:10:48] made it a 800. Amen.
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:56] Come on. I don't care what it looks like
[1:10:58] on the world's paper.
[1:11:01] We're not dealing with what man can see.
[1:11:05] And some of us won't step forward
[1:11:07] because we looking at our natural
[1:11:09] conditions. Oh, my credit report. Oh, my
[1:11:12] job. And I only make this much a year.
[1:11:15] Who is your God?
[1:11:22] Don't put me in these cuddle rims of tax
[1:11:25] brackets and all these things.
[1:11:30] With God, all things are possible.
[1:11:35] But it's according to your faith.
[1:11:37] Hallelujah. But look church, when when
[1:11:41] when we see this, he says, "According to
[1:11:44] God, have dealt to every man the measure
[1:11:48] of faith." Hallelujah. There's a measure
[1:11:52] of faith in this room tonight.
[1:11:56] Now, Brother D, what are you saying
[1:11:58] about a measure? Amen. Now look, if I
[1:12:00] want some water, if I want to put water
[1:12:03] in this bottle, I can only put
[1:12:07] 16 ounces.
[1:12:09] Cuz that's all this bottle will fit.
[1:12:12] Hallelujah. So if I'm filling this, I
[1:12:14] got to measure something that will give
[1:12:16] me 16 ounces. A gallon is too much.
[1:12:21] Two gallon is is is too much. So he got
[1:12:25] to he got to give out the faith.
[1:12:27] Hallelujah. that's able to hold it in
[1:12:31] the vessel. Hallelujah. The faith we got
[1:12:34] was too much for Luther.
[1:12:40] He didn't have a vessel that could hold
[1:12:43] what we got.
[1:12:45] The faith we got was too much for
[1:12:48] Wesley. He didn't have a vessel that
[1:12:51] could hold the complete revelation of
[1:12:54] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:57] The faith we got is even too much for
[1:12:59] Seymour.
[1:13:01] He didn't have a vessel that could hold
[1:13:06] all that's in the ocean.
[1:13:12] But in our day, God unleashed a measure
[1:13:17] of faith to this church. What kind of
[1:13:20] faith? God's own faith.
[1:13:24] The faith that created the worlds, the
[1:13:27] prophet of God say the same faith that
[1:13:30] created the world is in every believer
[1:13:33] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:39] Don't come to church and give me no 16
[1:13:42] ounces.
[1:13:46] I want the whole
[1:13:49] ocean. Amen.
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:54] Come to church with them 16 o when God
[1:13:58] has restored
[1:14:00] the whole thing to the church of God. We
[1:14:03] are no longer believing in a partial
[1:14:06] God.
[1:14:08] [Applause]
[1:14:12] But you got to understand
[1:14:14] what God has given you. Hallelujah. We
[1:14:18] put God in a box and we label it on,
[1:14:21] well, you know, God just did that in the
[1:14:23] prophet's life. God just did that in
[1:14:26] this brother. God just did that in the
[1:14:28] pastor or just the evangelist. Has he
[1:14:31] restored or not?
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:39] Okay. Yes, sir. Now, let's look at it.
[1:14:42] If I say hallelujah. If I say, "Zaddy, I
[1:14:44] wanted you to make me some rice and
[1:14:46] peas.
[1:14:49] Some rice and peas and some plantin."
[1:14:53] Hallelujah. Or some curry or oxtail.
[1:14:58] If I come and make that request, she's
[1:15:01] going to make a measurement just for me.
[1:15:04] Hallelujah. Because it's only one
[1:15:06] person. So, she's going to measure how
[1:15:08] much rice and peas. She's going to
[1:15:11] measure, hallelujah, how much plantin,
[1:15:13] hallelujah, how much curry or jerk or
[1:15:16] whatever I request, she's going to
[1:15:18] measure it for one person. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] And I'm here to tell you, when God
[1:15:22] opened them seals, it wasn't a
[1:15:24] measurement for one person.
[1:15:32] When God gave the revelation of the
[1:15:34] seven thunders, that wasn't just for one
[1:15:36] person. Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] Hallelujah. But that was for the body of
[1:15:42] Christ.
[1:15:44] So you are to be feasting on the measure
[1:15:47] of faith that God has opened up to the
[1:15:49] church.
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:53] Hallelujah. And this is the mistake
[1:15:55] we're making. Yes. Hallelujah. We can
[1:15:59] see what God did in a prophet. But let's
[1:16:02] understand something.
[1:16:04] That wasn't a cap.
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:10] That was He wasn't the cap.
[1:16:13] That was just the opening.
[1:16:18] [Applause]
[1:16:20] That was just the cap being twisted off.
[1:16:23] Hallelujah. So he put a measure in that
[1:16:26] prophet, but he put the same measure in
[1:16:29] the bride of
[1:16:31] Christ. So it ain't just in
[1:16:33] Jeffersonville. It ain't just in
[1:16:35] Arizona. It ain't just on Sunset
[1:16:37] Mountain,
[1:16:39] but it's in to whomsoever will believe.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] So, I'm challenging your faith tonight.
[1:16:55] I ain't going to be long. Y'all know I'm
[1:16:56] about to close. But look, church. Yes,
[1:16:58] sir. Let's go back to the meal. Uhhuh.
[1:17:02] Now, she makes some rice and peas. Yes,
[1:17:04] sir.
[1:17:05] And she makes some plantin
[1:17:07] and some curry and whatever else, right?
[1:17:11] And oxtail. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:17:13] Yeah. And I got to have some ginger
[1:17:18] beer. See, for y'all who ain't never
[1:17:20] been in the Caribbean, you'll know what
[1:17:21] I'm talking about. Hallelujah. But this
[1:17:25] is how we eat when we over in the
[1:17:26] Caribbean. Hallelujah. But look, church,
[1:17:29] if she make that for me, that's just
[1:17:31] she's going to measure enough just for
[1:17:33] me. That's right. Hallelujah. It's going
[1:17:35] to be just enough for me and you know
[1:17:36] and I can eat it and be satisfied. But
[1:17:39] what if I come with brother Shimbo?
[1:17:42] What's your name, bro? What if I come
[1:17:44] with Angela? What's your name, bro? What
[1:17:46] if I come with Benjamin? What if I come
[1:17:48] with this sister and this sister and
[1:17:50] this sister and this sister and this
[1:17:52] sister and this sister and this brother?
[1:17:54] What if I bring everybody with me? She
[1:17:57] got to have a greater measure to feed
[1:18:00] everybody. Now, the thing of it is, is
[1:18:03] she capable to capable of feeding
[1:18:06] everybody? That's the question.
[1:18:07] Hallelujah. If she's capable of feeding
[1:18:09] everybody, if she's capable, she's going
[1:18:12] to get her team together and she going
[1:18:13] to say, "Hey, I got some people coming
[1:18:15] and I want them to leave satisfied."
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:22] Now, what God has done, God has opened
[1:18:24] up his word. Not just for me, but for
[1:18:28] brother Shimbo, for this brother, for
[1:18:30] this brother, for everybody on this row
[1:18:32] in that row. Now, this is the question.
[1:18:34] Is God capable?
[1:18:40] Is God capable of taking care of
[1:18:44] everybody's desire?
[1:18:47] Can God feed everybody?
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:52] Yes, sir. Can God meet the measure
[1:18:57] of faith that's in you?
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:05] Glory to God. Now, the Bible already
[1:19:07] said, "Be sober." Yes, sir. He's given
[1:19:11] everybody a measure of faith. That's
[1:19:13] right. But the problem is a lot of times
[1:19:16] we don't believe God can quench that
[1:19:19] hunger.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah.
[1:19:24] We live, Brother Kenny. We live in a
[1:19:26] natural realm. So often we try to put
[1:19:29] God in a natural realm.
[1:19:37] You know who did that? The Sadducees and
[1:19:40] Pharisees did that. That's right. That's
[1:19:42] why they couldn't believe.
[1:19:45] Hallelujah. Because they put our God in
[1:19:48] the natural realm. They say, "Hey, we
[1:19:50] going to stone. We ain't stoning you for
[1:19:51] the good works. We believe in it. We we
[1:19:53] we believe that you can heal the sick
[1:19:55] and all these things. We we we we not
[1:19:59] doubting you got faith for healing.
[1:20:05] We're not doubting you got faith to uh
[1:20:07] pay your tithe. Some of you
[1:20:13] Some of you
[1:20:17] still negotiating with God. Lord, I'mma
[1:20:20] pay this and then I'mma get back with
[1:20:22] what?
[1:20:26] You don't believe that he's Jehovah
[1:20:28] Gyra. If you got to negotiate,
[1:20:33] oh boy, getting tight up in here. It
[1:20:35] getting tight. You start talking about
[1:20:37] tithing.
[1:20:39] But church, hallelujah. You look at God
[1:20:41] and you think about what he's able to
[1:20:44] do. Hallelujah. But like I said, the
[1:20:46] problem is, hallelujah, we keep trying
[1:20:48] to put God in a natural realm like the
[1:20:51] Sadducees and Pharisees did. That's why
[1:20:54] their faith couldn't elevate at the
[1:20:57] appearing of God.
[1:21:00] That's right.
[1:21:03] They was looking for God, but they
[1:21:05] didn't have the faith to receive him
[1:21:07] when he came cuz they put them in a
[1:21:09] natural realm.
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Take
[1:21:16] your time. Yes, sir. But then, church,
[1:21:20] sir, they say, "We don't stone you for
[1:21:22] all the good works." Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:21:24] We believe we we believe God in the
[1:21:26] prophet. We believe all the good things
[1:21:29] that God did through the prophet. But
[1:21:31] then they said, "Hey, we don't stone you
[1:21:33] for none of that. We stone you for you
[1:21:36] being a man,
[1:21:39] making yourself God."
[1:21:44] See, their faith was only at a level
[1:21:48] that when they saw a man doing God
[1:21:51] things, they still thought it was a man.
[1:21:56] Preach, my brother, preach. They didn't
[1:21:58] have the faith to believe that
[1:22:01] God could step behind skin.
[1:22:05] And when you saw that man, you saw the
[1:22:08] same God who had the faith to create the
[1:22:12] worlds.
[1:22:16] So he said, "We don't stone you for the
[1:22:18] good works. We stone you for you saying
[1:22:20] you being a man saying you God."
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:26] What a mistake.
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:36] Look, I even say this,
[1:22:41] and brother Simbo can make more sense
[1:22:42] out of it,
[1:22:44] but I'll say unto you, there's a
[1:22:47] five-fold ministry, right? Amen. And we
[1:22:50] will as a church, we'll receive the
[1:22:54] teacher, the pastor, the evangelist.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah.
[1:23:02] Huh?
[1:23:04] The preacher, the the the the pastor,
[1:23:06] the teacher, the evangelist, the
[1:23:08] missionary.
[1:23:11] Where's that prophet?
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:15] I ain't talking about of the age. I'm
[1:23:18] talking about in the five-fold ministry.
[1:23:22] There is a prophetic gift in the
[1:23:25] five-fold ministry.
[1:23:28] But you know what we've done? We've made
[1:23:31] a prophet an evangelist
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:39] because we don't have faith enough to
[1:23:41] believe God can still tell you what you
[1:23:44] doing in your house.
[1:23:49] God can still walk up to you and have
[1:23:51] thus said the Lord in the church.
[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:00] I've even heard some brothers say that
[1:24:02] if you have a prophetic gift, you need
[1:24:05] to forfeit it.
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:13] The prophet didn't come to take away
[1:24:16] from what God had given a believer, but
[1:24:18] he came to open it up.
[1:24:22] So church, when you come, hallelujah,
[1:24:25] and you sit in church and you hear the
[1:24:27] word talking directly to you, that is
[1:24:31] under a prophetic ministry.
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:36] Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] Hallelujah. And I'm going to make some
[1:24:40] of you look real strange. And then the
[1:24:42] prophet comes and he says, "A man that
[1:24:45] preaches by inspiration is a prophet."
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:59] So when your pastor get off his notes
[1:25:01] and he start talking directly in your
[1:25:03] life and picking up inspiration in your
[1:25:05] life, what is that? That's a portion of
[1:25:08] the prophetic gift.
[1:25:11] When the evangelist come and he start
[1:25:13] talking to you what's going on in your
[1:25:15] life, what is that? That's a portion of
[1:25:17] the prophetic ministry.
[1:25:21] The prophet is still among us, but you
[1:25:25] have to raise up your faith.
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:34] Yes, my brother. We want to put it on a
[1:25:37] man. It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:43] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. But the question
[1:25:46] is
[1:25:48] look,
[1:25:49] I don't need, let me say it like this.
[1:25:52] Uhhuh.
[1:25:54] When God
[1:25:56] was dealing with Noah, right? He gave
[1:25:59] Noah faith, right? A measure of faith.
[1:26:02] That's right. To build a cruise liner.
[1:26:07] Brother,
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:12] I know some of you didn't been on a
[1:26:14] cruise before.
[1:26:15] Noah built a boat bigger than that.
[1:26:20] Yes, sir. With no blueprints.
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:27] Hallelujah. It was all coming straight
[1:26:30] from
[1:26:30] God. Inspiration coming straight from
[1:26:33] God. See church, that's what your faith
[1:26:35] ought to do. It got to rise up high
[1:26:38] enough to listen and hear God and live
[1:26:41] in that place he want you to live in.
[1:26:46] And that's what Noah had to do. Noah
[1:26:49] Hallelujah. He had to listen for God to
[1:26:52] give him hallelujah instruction to build
[1:26:56] Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] something bigger than carnival. That's
[1:27:00] right. That's what I need. Yeah, that's
[1:27:03] right. Something bigger than Norwegian.
[1:27:06] Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] Where did they get the inspiration from?
[1:27:09] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It already started with
[1:27:13] God.
[1:27:16] It ain't nothing being done that God
[1:27:18] hadn't already did.
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:25] But he built the boat that the ocean
[1:27:28] couldn't sink. That's right. That's
[1:27:31] right.
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:35] God built the original Titanic.
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:45] It was so high and so anointed. When it
[1:27:49] rose up on the icebergs, the icebergs
[1:27:52] melted
[1:27:56] because of the anointing on the boat.
[1:28:01] Hallelujah.
[1:28:03] God, hallelujah, gave Noah faith to
[1:28:06] build something that he couldn't seek.
[1:28:10] That's right. But what he could believe
[1:28:13] in saved his life.
[1:28:17] Yes, sir.
[1:28:19] My brother. That's right. That was his
[1:28:22] measure of faith. That's right. Now, let
[1:28:24] me say something. Yes, my brother. I
[1:28:26] don't need to build a boat. No, sir.
[1:28:33] I want you to catch something.
[1:28:37] God doesn't have to come and give you
[1:28:42] more faith.
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:54] Okay,
[1:28:55] I'll make it plain for you.
[1:28:58] Let's just say if I was a farmer
[1:29:01] and I wanted to plant some red apples,
[1:29:04] I would get a seed
[1:29:07] that has red in the apple seed.
[1:29:12] God doesn't plant, hallelujah, the seed
[1:29:16] and then comes back and inject coloring
[1:29:18] in it.
[1:29:22] Everything it needs is in it already.
[1:29:25] And as it starts to reveal, everything
[1:29:29] that's in it comes out of it as it
[1:29:32] grows.
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] We say, "Oh, God, give me more faith.
[1:29:38] Give me more faith." How can he?
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:44] He's giving you everything you need for
[1:29:46] the journey.
[1:29:48] It's already in your seat. Amen.
[1:29:56] And if that one ain't good enough for
[1:29:58] you, you take that same farmer
[1:30:02] and apple, you can get red, you can get
[1:30:05] yellow, or you can get green. But to get
[1:30:08] what the farmer's looking for, he has to
[1:30:10] plant that kind of seed. Hallelujah.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah. So there may be a gift of
[1:30:18] prophecy in you and a gift of tongues in
[1:30:21] me.
[1:30:23] Hallelujah. There may be a word of
[1:30:25] knowledge in you and a word of wisdom in
[1:30:27] you, but God put that in you before the
[1:30:31] foundation of the world.
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:35] That's exactly right. So he doesn't have
[1:30:38] to add to you. It's already in you.
[1:30:44] That's right. That's right. Did not the
[1:30:47] prophet of God say when that apple tree
[1:30:50] is this big, every seed that it will
[1:30:53] ever produce is already in it when it's
[1:30:56] that size.
[1:31:01] So what does the farmer do? Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] The farmer plants the seed, steps back
[1:31:08] and rely on faith.
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:11] That's right. That's right.
[1:31:16] Trusting
[1:31:17] that what he planted is going to give
[1:31:20] him what he wants.
[1:31:23] And that's what God has done for you and
[1:31:25] I. He knows what he put inside of us.
[1:31:30] But this is where we where we where
[1:31:32] where we get crossed up. We get in
[1:31:34] certain situations and we say, "Oh, God,
[1:31:36] give me more faith." No, he's already
[1:31:40] given you the measure for that
[1:31:42] situation.
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:48] I want everybody to pull out your big
[1:31:49] gloves and don't let this go over your
[1:31:52] head. You got to catch it. Hallelujah.
[1:31:56] God doesn't come when you go through a
[1:31:58] trial. He doesn't have to come back and
[1:32:00] say, "Hey, I need to give him more faith
[1:32:02] for this trial." What you need is
[1:32:04] already in you.
[1:32:06] It's that trial that's going to unlock
[1:32:08] it.
[1:32:13] It's the trial that's going to bring out
[1:32:16] what God put inside of you.
[1:32:21] Hallelujah. That's why I say I thank God
[1:32:24] for having cancer in my brain
[1:32:32] because it was the cancer that brought
[1:32:35] out the revelation of Jehovah
[1:32:37] Rafa. If I never had cancer, I never
[1:32:41] know that God could heal me
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:47] without
[1:32:50] chemo, without
[1:32:52] radiation, without some special
[1:32:55] treatment. All I had to do was apply a
[1:32:58] measure of faith for that situation.
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:05] What did I do? Did I have to m I give
[1:33:08] you? No. It was already in me.
[1:33:12] It was already there. And the trial just
[1:33:15] brought it out.
[1:33:18] Anybody going through something? Anybody
[1:33:21] going through something? I'm here to
[1:33:23] tell you right now, you got the faith to
[1:33:26] overcome it right now.
[1:33:29] The faith is in you right now to
[1:33:32] overcome it if you would just believe.
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:41] Look, I'll go back. Yes, sir. I'll go
[1:33:44] back. Yes, sir. They criticized Jesus
[1:33:49] because they said, "You being a man
[1:33:52] making yourself God." They were looking
[1:33:55] at it wrong.
[1:33:57] Uhhuh. They were looking at a room. He
[1:34:00] wasn't a man making himself God.
[1:34:04] He was God making himself a man.
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:13] Now let me ask you something. Who are
[1:34:16] you?
[1:34:20] Who are you?
[1:34:24] I ain't a man becoming a child of God.
[1:34:28] I'm a child of God playing out the life
[1:34:32] of a man on earth.
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:41] God can't change the faith. It's the
[1:34:43] same faith.
[1:34:48] Yes, sir.
[1:34:51] And what does he do? He proves it to you
[1:34:56] right now. He's proving it to you. He
[1:34:59] said, "I'm going to let you bypass
[1:35:02] what?"
[1:35:05] Your what? Your theophony.
[1:35:09] That means you got representation in
[1:35:11] heaven.
[1:35:17] If I got representation in heaven, that
[1:35:20] must mean I'm a god.
[1:35:27] A theophony is a word body.
[1:35:33] And the Bible says flesh and blood shall
[1:35:37] not inherit the kingdom of God.
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:42] I know I ain't taking this with me, so I
[1:35:45] must got something already there waiting
[1:35:47] on me.
[1:35:50] [Applause]
[1:35:54] Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] But we fail to even realize that our
[1:35:59] theophony
[1:36:00] is closer than what we think.
[1:36:03] The prophet says when you receive this
[1:36:05] message, that's what eagle's fool.
[1:36:09] You have heard from your theophony.
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:17] Now I'mma prove I'mma prove to you that
[1:36:22] your theophony is here right now.
[1:36:28] Right now.
[1:36:30] Not when I get a body change. Right now.
[1:36:34] Not when the rapture take place. Right
[1:36:36] now. your time.
[1:36:41] My theity is in this room right now.
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:52] You say, "Bro Digs, how can you say
[1:36:53] that?" All right. As I preach the word,
[1:36:59] faith comes by what? Hearing. Hearing.
[1:37:02] Amen. Hearing what? The word of God. The
[1:37:05] word of God. Amen. Now your flesh knows
[1:37:08] nothing of the word.
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:16] So what is it about you that's making
[1:37:19] you say amen?
[1:37:26] It ain't your flesh.
[1:37:28] Your flesh ain't never been to heaven.
[1:37:32] So this is what's happening right now
[1:37:34] while I'm preaching. The word is going
[1:37:36] forth and there's a supernatural
[1:37:39] presence that belongs to you
[1:37:41] individually alone. And as the word is
[1:37:44] being preached, something walks up on
[1:37:46] you in your spirit and say say amen.
[1:37:49] Amen.
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:37:54] Say amen. Say amen. Say amen. Say amen.
[1:38:00] What is that? That's the measure that
[1:38:03] God has already put in us.
[1:38:10] Hallelujah.
[1:38:13] Glory to God. Some of us looking for the
[1:38:15] via when it been here all along.
[1:38:22] See, I'm about to close. Don't get
[1:38:24] nervous.
[1:38:26] I don't need faith for a cruise
[1:38:28] liner. That's right.
[1:38:31] Cuz when God was dealing with Moses,
[1:38:34] the last thing on Moses' mind concerning
[1:38:37] deliverance was a boat.
[1:38:44] He didn't have faith in him for a boat.
[1:38:50] [Music]
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:53] It was on a whole another scale.
[1:38:58] And sometimes God got to push us. That's
[1:39:00] right. So that what's in us can come
[1:39:02] out. And he'll put us in a situation
[1:39:06] that we can't understand with our own
[1:39:08] mind or see with our own natural eyes.
[1:39:11] We just got to believe whatever he say.
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:17] Moses Moses didn't come out at least 10
[1:39:22] times. God done miracles
[1:39:25] and their faith still wasn't where it
[1:39:27] was supposed to be cuz God wasn't done
[1:39:30] yet.
[1:39:32] You say, you say, "Oh Lord, I seen you
[1:39:35] pay my light bill." God ain't done yet.
[1:39:39] Oh Lord, I see you pay my car. God ain't
[1:39:42] done yet.
[1:39:46] Hallelujah.
[1:39:48] Church, listen. Amen. Noah, Moses got to
[1:39:52] a place Yes, sir. where he needed
[1:39:54] deliverance.
[1:39:55] He didn't say, "God, I need a boat like
[1:39:57] Noah."
[1:39:59] No, sir.
[1:40:04] He started talking to the Lord. He said,
[1:40:06] "Lord, uh, now look, he had then saw God
[1:40:10] do 10 miracles already, right? But then
[1:40:13] Noah, I mean Moses, Moses is so
[1:40:16] discouraged. All that God done in his
[1:40:19] heart, that wasn't enough.
[1:40:23] What God did in brother Brandham's life
[1:40:25] ain't enough for me.
[1:40:31] I need my own experiences.
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:34] [Applause]
[1:40:37] And what I pray is God, if you did it in
[1:40:40] him, you can do it in me.
[1:40:45] because we come out of the same
[1:40:46] vineyard.
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:53] Moses didn't catch inspiration for a
[1:40:56] cruise liner. But then he comes and he
[1:40:59] says, "Lord, you know what? I've seen
[1:41:02] all these things." He said, "But that
[1:41:04] ain't good enough. Lord,
[1:41:08] show me your glory.
[1:41:11] [Applause]
[1:41:14] Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] That man say, "Show me your glory, Lord.
[1:41:22] I want to see more than just a a a mana
[1:41:25] from heaven. I want to see more than
[1:41:27] just flies being created."
[1:41:33] You know what he was saying? I need to
[1:41:35] see more than just Hallelujah.
[1:41:38] the third pull in somebody else's life.
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:46] Hallelujah. He said, "God, I want to see
[1:41:49] you personally."
[1:41:51] And what did he see? God said, "You
[1:41:53] can't see me and live now." He said,
[1:41:54] "But what I'm going to do, I'mma pass my
[1:41:56] glory by you."
[1:41:59] And what did he see? He saw the hinder
[1:42:02] parts of what? Amen.
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:10] Amen. God's glory
[1:42:13] is the image of a man.
[1:42:21] You sitting with God's glory. You
[1:42:24] sitting with God's glory. I'm looking at
[1:42:27] God's glory. God's glory is in the image
[1:42:30] of man.
[1:42:32] That's why he came down and he created
[1:42:35] Adam in his likeness and his image
[1:42:48] everybody. All right, church. And then
[1:42:51] Moses
[1:42:53] sees the glory of God. But church, now
[1:42:55] let's let's get to the spot. Uhhuh. God
[1:42:59] wants to show
[1:43:00] Moses, "Why you want to see me?
[1:43:05] I'm already here.
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:12] Why you want to see me? I'm already
[1:43:15] here."
[1:43:19] Let's backtrack. He says, "Oh, God, I
[1:43:22] can't speak. I can't talk. I can't do
[1:43:24] the Shut up, Moses.
[1:43:27] Shut your mouth. Stop all that
[1:43:30] complaining.
[1:43:33] Now watch how God raised his faith. God
[1:43:36] say, "Hey, I want Aaron to be your
[1:43:41] prophet."
[1:43:44] And you be God to the people.
[1:43:51] Moses went back down to Egypt with an
[1:43:54] anointing on him.
[1:43:56] Let my people go.
[1:44:04] The God anointing was on Moses now
[1:44:09] cuz God had told him, "You be God. Stop
[1:44:13] crying to me. Speak and move
[1:44:17] forward." Yes, sir.
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] Now he gets to the Red Sea and Moses
[1:44:23] start crying again. God say shut
[1:44:30] up the Lord. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. For
[1:44:33] those of you who can't give God no
[1:44:36] praise because of your situation,
[1:44:39] those of you who can't give God no
[1:44:41] worship because your bills behind or
[1:44:43] your children acting up or your spouse
[1:44:46] acting up, I'm going to tell you just
[1:44:48] like God told Moses, shut up.
[1:44:54] Shut your mouth.
[1:44:56] God is doing that to you so he can come
[1:44:59] out. You need to let him out.
[1:45:03] He's giving you a measure of faith for
[1:45:06] what's going on in your life already.
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:18] But the more God reveals himself,
[1:45:21] the closer man looks like a God.
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:30] He said, "Speak to the sea and move." He
[1:45:32] say, "Speak and move forward."
[1:45:34] Moses, he didn't go up to the Red Sea
[1:45:38] and say, "By the powers of the Lord, God
[1:45:40] invested in me, I command you see."
[1:45:48] He turned around and looked at the
[1:45:50] problem.
[1:45:52] Se wasn't the problem.
[1:45:55] The Egyptians was the problem.
[1:45:58] So, he tells the church, "Hallelujah."
[1:46:01] Yes, sir. Look at his faith. He tells
[1:46:04] the church, he says, he says, "Now when
[1:46:06] God when God when God comes down in man,
[1:46:10] creation begins to listen." Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] Everything is listening to God in that
[1:46:16] man. Hallelujah. So whether he speaks to
[1:46:19] it or not, creation has to do what God
[1:46:22] says.
[1:46:23] Hallelujah. So Moses is now saying, "The
[1:46:27] Egyptians whom have you seen, you shall
[1:46:30] see them no more
[1:46:33] forever." And the sea heard that and the
[1:46:37] sea.
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:44] He never said anything to the sea. He
[1:46:46] spoke to the Egyptians.
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:52] Glory to God.
[1:46:55] Speak to the problem. Who are you
[1:46:57] speaking to?
[1:46:59] Speak to the problem. Speak to the
[1:47:01] problem.
[1:47:05] Creation will make what you say happen
[1:47:09] when you realize you are a god.
[1:47:14] They realized God was in Moses. And when
[1:47:17] God began to speak, creation began to
[1:47:20] obey.
[1:47:25] And the sea moved out of God's way. That
[1:47:28] measure of faith was already in Moses.
[1:47:32] God just put him in a situation where it
[1:47:35] will come out.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:42] Church. Hallelujah. Yes, my brother.
[1:47:45] Listen. Yes, sir.
[1:47:47] Hallelujah. The reason why I read the
[1:47:50] woman with the blood issue, she had this
[1:47:52] issue for 12 years.
[1:47:55] And the prophet said 12 is a number of
[1:47:58] worship. Yes, sir.
[1:48:03] Could you be going through it because
[1:48:04] you hadn't learned how to worship yet?
[1:48:10] Well, if they don't sing my song, I just
[1:48:13] can't get in the service.
[1:48:16] You supposed to be the song.
[1:48:19] Hallelujah. Do Hey, let me ask you
[1:48:21] something. Do you have a keyboard in
[1:48:23] your car?
[1:48:25] What about a guitar? You got a guitar in
[1:48:27] your car?
[1:48:30] What What What do you do? Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] When it's time to worship God when you
[1:48:34] by yourself, are you depending on the
[1:48:36] song leader
[1:48:40] or does it just come out of you?
[1:48:44] doesn't just come out of
[1:48:46] you. My God is greater. My God is
[1:48:51] stronger. God, you are higher than any
[1:48:55] other. God, you are healer. Awesome in
[1:49:00] B. My
[1:49:02] God. My God.
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:09] Ain't no keyboard playing. What's
[1:49:12] happening is experience then. That's it.
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:21] Church.
[1:49:23] Listen. I got I got I got to get out of
[1:49:25] here. I got to get out of here. Yes,
[1:49:27] sir. I'm going to tell you how this came
[1:49:29] about. Listen. Yes, sir. Everything we
[1:49:32] going through is for a purpose.
[1:49:38] God is not giving you more faith for the
[1:49:41] situation. He's unlocking the faith
[1:49:44] that's in you. Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] Cuz the Bible says, the Bible says when
[1:49:49] he created everything that he wanted to
[1:49:51] create it, he stepped back and then he
[1:49:53] did what? Rested.
[1:49:57] So he's not working on your faith. No,
[1:50:00] he's already giving you everything you
[1:50:02] need.
[1:50:03] He's just putting you in situations
[1:50:06] where whatever you need, the measure of
[1:50:09] it is already there.
[1:50:12] Hallelujah. I had a measure for cancer
[1:50:15] in my brain.
[1:50:17] You might have a measure for diabetes,
[1:50:19] but you afraid to fight it.
[1:50:23] That's it.
[1:50:30] Hallelujah. That's it. Yes, sir. You
[1:50:33] might be going through something right
[1:50:34] now, but you afraid to fight it. But I'm
[1:50:37] going to show you. Take your time.
[1:50:39] You're going through it for a purpose.
[1:50:42] Listen.
[1:50:44] Listen what the prophet says.
[1:50:47] Take your time. Boy, this is heavy.
[1:50:50] Glory to God.
[1:50:53] Oh my. Oh, glory. Oh my. My alarm going
[1:50:56] off.
[1:51:00] Listen. Go ahead. What is faith? Yes,
[1:51:02] sir. The prophet said, but wait a
[1:51:05] minute. He said, "Have faith in God. For
[1:51:08] verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye
[1:51:10] shall say to this mountain, be moved,
[1:51:12] plucked up, and cast into the sea, and
[1:51:15] don't doubt in your heart, but believe
[1:51:17] that what you say will come to pass.
[1:51:21] You have, Hallelujah. Whatever thing
[1:51:25] thou sayest, is that right? You shall
[1:51:28] have it. Not me. You shall have it. What
[1:51:32] power has been given to the church?
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:39] And then he comes and he says, same
[1:51:42] message. He says,
[1:51:44] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:51:48] God
[1:51:50] that you see it before it happens.
[1:51:57] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That you
[1:52:02] see it before it happens and express it
[1:52:04] in word form. The word takes a whole and
[1:52:08] becomes material, a thought expressed.
[1:52:12] So church, that's where we should be
[1:52:15] when it comes to faith. If it's a real
[1:52:17] revelation, we're speaking it as if we
[1:52:22] already have it.
[1:52:25] That's what Abraham did.
[1:52:28] That's exactly.
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] But you know what stops us from getting
[1:52:35] there? Hallelujah.
[1:52:42] Living in the realm
[1:52:45] of sight
[1:52:47] and sight will always bring you to
[1:52:51] natural circumstances.
[1:52:56] And then we'll start to believe God
[1:52:58] according to the circumstances.
[1:53:02] Don't get nervous. I'm about to close.
[1:53:04] I'm about to close.
[1:53:06] We say, "Oh, God, Lord, I'm believing
[1:53:08] you for this house, but my credits go."
[1:53:14] That's circumstantial faith.
[1:53:18] That's right. Land flowing with milk and
[1:53:22] honey is already given to you.
[1:53:29] You just got to go take it.
[1:53:31] [Applause]
[1:53:33] That's exactly right. That's exactly
[1:53:36] right. Listen, circumstance. He says,
[1:53:39] "Now, yes, my brother." Yes, sir. As I
[1:53:42] bring this down to a close, look, listen
[1:53:45] what the prophet of God says,
[1:53:51] boy, is heavy.
[1:53:55] He said, "Now, there's something that's
[1:53:58] wrong. And in the beginning, God created
[1:54:01] you to be the master of every
[1:54:05] circumstance.
[1:54:11] Did you hear me?
[1:54:13] What you going through right now, God
[1:54:16] created you to be the master of it
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:21] right now.
[1:54:26] I got certain bills due right now.
[1:54:30] But God allowed those bills to come
[1:54:33] about so I can be the master of my
[1:54:36] circumstances.
[1:54:41] When things get tight, I can be the
[1:54:43] master of it.
[1:54:45] Still pay my tithing, still pay my
[1:54:48] offering, and still say I'm blessed
[1:54:54] because he said
[1:54:55] so. become the master of your situation.
[1:55:02] Listen,
[1:55:03] listen.
[1:55:05] He says,
[1:55:07] "Created you to be the master of every
[1:55:09] circumstance." That's the origin. That's
[1:55:13] authentic. That's God's word. That's
[1:55:15] right. Listen what he says. There was
[1:55:18] nothing nothing could happen unless you
[1:55:23] was the master of it.
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:34] He said that's what you were created
[1:55:38] for.
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:43] Then sin came along through the fall and
[1:55:46] blinded the eyes of it. And now Jesus
[1:55:49] came along.
[1:55:52] Jesus came along. I said Jesus came
[1:55:55] along and redeemed it back.
[1:56:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] Hallelujah. Before I Before I get out of
[1:56:06] here, take your time, my brother. He
[1:56:09] said when we were created, we were
[1:56:11] created to be the master of every
[1:56:13] circumstance.
[1:56:14] That's why God brought all creation to
[1:56:16] Adam. He said, "You name it."
[1:56:19] [Applause]
[1:56:22] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, my brother.
[1:56:25] Yes, my brother. I'm going just see if
[1:56:27] he do what I created him to do.
[1:56:32] He already knew. He had trust in Adam.
[1:56:36] God didn't have a second thought. That's
[1:56:39] why he brought it to Adam cuz he knew
[1:56:41] Adam had his mind.
[1:56:45] He was the master of every circumstance.
[1:56:49] That's our origin. That's our beginning.
[1:56:54] He said nothing could in that state,
[1:56:57] nothing could come to you except first
[1:56:59] you were the master.
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:03] And then he said sin came in and blinded
[1:57:06] us. But then he said Jesus Christ came
[1:57:09] and redeemed it back.
[1:57:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:57:15] So, let me ask you a question. How many
[1:57:18] of you in here believe in the death,
[1:57:19] burial, and resurrection of Jesus
[1:57:21] Christ?
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:26] Amen. Glory to God. Yes, sir. How many
[1:57:29] believe what took place on Calvary?
[1:57:34] The death, burial, and resurrection of
[1:57:35] Jesus.
[1:57:37] See, just that alone should break should
[1:57:39] put us into a praise dance.
[1:57:46] hope. That's right.
[1:57:49] Amen. Yes, sir. Because that is our
[1:57:54] moment in time
[1:57:57] where God restored us back to everything
[1:58:00] we were in the beginning.
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:05] So if you hallelujah believe in the
[1:58:08] resurrection hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:58:12] death burial resurrection of Jesus
[1:58:14] Christ hallelujah by faith that means
[1:58:18] right now you are the master of every
[1:58:22] circumstance in your Yes.
[1:58:26] [Applause]
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:37] Glory to God.
[1:58:39] You said, "Brother D, I'm behind on my
[1:58:41] rent." You the master of it.
[1:58:47] God just trying to show you who you are.
[1:58:49] Oh, Brother Dez, I got sugar diabetes.
[1:58:51] You the master of it. Amen.
[1:58:55] Yes, sir. Amen. Are you afraid to talk
[1:58:58] like the master?
[1:59:01] Tell the devil, "Get out of my body."
[1:59:05] Get out of my body right now in the name
[1:59:08] of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:11] What? No sickness in the Garden of Eden.
[1:59:14] Was no debt in the Garden of Eden.
[1:59:18] Hallelujah. He's brought us back to
[1:59:20] everything that Adam was.
[1:59:24] Amen. He's brought us back to that
[1:59:26] measure of faith where all things in
[1:59:30] Christ is possible. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:33] But I tell you what he's doing.
[1:59:34] Hallelujah. See,
[1:59:37] I don't have a need for squirrels.
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:41] [Music]
[1:59:43] [Applause]
[1:59:46] That's what he needed.
[1:59:49] [Applause]
[1:59:51] That's what he needed.
[1:59:54] But I need
[1:59:57] a four
[1:59:58] bedroomedroom, 30,000 twocar garage
[2:00:02] square foot house.
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:07] [Applause]
[2:00:15] White Maserati.
[2:00:20] You thought I was going to say Toyota.
[2:00:24] I can get that on my own.
[2:00:27] I'm talking about things that are not
[2:00:29] possible.
[2:00:31] Things that only God can do.
[2:00:36] I don't need squirrels.
[2:00:39] I don't need a caribou. I don't need a
[2:00:42] silver tip.
[2:00:44] [Applause]
[2:00:51] something. We need We need children
[2:00:53] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:57] [Applause]
[2:01:08] We need healings in our body. I don't
[2:01:12] need squir.
[2:01:21] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:23] And I can speak like that
[2:01:25] because that happened. Squirrels happen.
[2:01:30] Silver tip happen. Hallelujah. Caribou
[2:01:33] happened.
[2:01:34] So I can say, I've seen it restored.
[2:01:38] I've seen that measure of faith. God
[2:01:40] gave the prophet faith to believe that
[2:01:43] he could speak a silver tip grizzly bear
[2:01:47] into existence.
[2:01:48] [Applause]
[2:01:56] Don't put it in the carnal realm. Y'all
[2:01:57] hear me talking about cars and houses
[2:01:59] and all this stuff. Hallelujah.
[2:02:02] Holly. But this is the question. If you
[2:02:06] need it,
[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:11] if you need it, why not believe God for
[2:02:14] it?
[2:02:16] [Applause]
[2:02:20] Hallelujah.
[2:02:22] You might not need a silver
[2:02:25] tip, something. You might not want a
[2:02:28] caribou,
[2:02:30] but you want a husband.
[2:02:37] [Applause]
[2:02:48] You know what you need.
[2:02:51] You know what you believing
[2:02:54] for. He's giving you a measure of faith
[2:02:58] to create what you need.
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:03] [Applause]
[2:03:12] Our faith in this day is not contingent
[2:03:16] on us creating squirrels.
[2:03:20] God did that to show us we can do it.
[2:03:25] God did that to show us we are in that
[2:03:28] time.
[2:03:30] And look, hallelujah. I'm about to go.
[2:03:33] Look, just like the prophet, so are you.
[2:03:37] You got to be pushed into it.
[2:03:41] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:03:44] He wasn't even looking for squirrels. He
[2:03:46] didn't even know he had the ability to
[2:03:48] create squirrels.
[2:03:54] But God put him out there in the woods
[2:03:57] all dry with nothing out there. And then
[2:04:00] he came down.
[2:04:04] Came down and started to have fellowship
[2:04:06] with him. Started to talk to him and he
[2:04:08] said, "What do you need?" And all us get
[2:04:10] all super spiritual.
[2:04:14] We get all super spiritual.
[2:04:20] know you need something from God and try
[2:04:22] to get all super spiritual.
[2:04:27] Lord,
[2:04:29] Lord, I'm all right.
[2:04:33] Then
[2:04:34] God rebukes the prophet.
[2:04:38] Aren't you looking for squirrels?
[2:04:41] How many you want?
[2:04:46] Now he want to show the prophet what's
[2:04:48] inside of him.
[2:04:51] How many do you want?
[2:04:53] [Applause]
[2:04:57] I'm not going to tell you how many to
[2:04:59] ask for. Whatever you ask for, you'll
[2:05:03] have it.
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:07] Whatever you ask for. Ain't that what
[2:05:10] the Bible says?
[2:05:21] He'll put you in position. Yes, sir. So
[2:05:23] what's in you will come out. And he
[2:05:26] won't let up until you get what you
[2:05:28] asked for.
[2:05:32] He got one. He got two. He said, "Oh
[2:05:34] Lord, this good enough for me." Say,
[2:05:36] "Didn't you ask for three? Go back out
[2:05:38] there.
[2:05:39] [Applause]
[2:05:42] Some of y'all Some of y'all didn't
[2:05:44] walked away from your prayer. Get back
[2:05:46] in that prayer room.
[2:05:49] Didn't you ask for it? Get back in that
[2:05:51] prayer room.
[2:05:54] Stop being afraid. You asked for it. Go
[2:05:56] back in there and wait on it. Go wait on
[2:05:59] it. You asked for it.
[2:06:03] He told the prophet, "Didn't you ask for
[2:06:05] three?
[2:06:09] Go back. Go back and ask for the wait on
[2:06:12] stay right there. Yes, sir. And he
[2:06:14] stayed out there and waited on. Uhhuh.
[2:06:15] Yes, sir. And you know what happened? Go
[2:06:17] ahead. The faith that God already knew
[2:06:19] was in him to speak the word started to
[2:06:22] manifest. And the next thing you know,
[2:06:24] he had two. And then he sat there and
[2:06:26] waited on the third one.
[2:06:29] That's it.
[2:06:31] That's it.
[2:06:33] Just like he asked for.
[2:06:37] Yes, my brother.
[2:06:39] Look. Yes, sir. A lot of times in the
[2:06:42] prophet's ministry, he wasn't even
[2:06:45] trying to do something. God pushed him
[2:06:47] into it.
[2:06:50] God put him God put him on a mountain in
[2:06:53] a snowstorm. He say, "If you speak to
[2:06:55] it, it'll obey you."
[2:06:56] [Music]
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:04] Look at this faith. I'm trying to close.
[2:07:07] Where is that faith? What are you
[2:07:09] looking at? What are you looking at? Cuz
[2:07:13] sometimes God will do something that'll
[2:07:14] shake you up, but he's really trying to
[2:07:16] release and unlock what's inside of you.
[2:07:19] Remember, he told them, "Let's go to the
[2:07:22] other side." And then he came out there
[2:07:24] walking on the water.
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:28] I ain't getting in no boat. Amen.
[2:07:32] Y'all go ahead.
[2:07:35] Remember remember he said, "Let us
[2:07:39] go to the other side." But they got in
[2:07:41] the boat without him.
[2:07:47] And then what happened when they got in
[2:07:48] the boat?
[2:07:53] The Bible said the storm was so bad that
[2:07:56] the water was fulling up in in the boat.
[2:07:59] Now
[2:08:02] and in one place it say Jesus in the
[2:08:04] boat sleep.
[2:08:08] Too many of us in our storm he's asleep.
[2:08:11] That's right.
[2:08:13] He in your life asleep. He in your
[2:08:16] situation asleep. When you going to stop
[2:08:18] fighting in yourself, it's time for you
[2:08:20] to go wake up the master.
[2:08:24] Go wake up the master.
[2:08:26] Look, glory to God. But then,
[2:08:28] hallelujah, things will happen cuz God's
[2:08:30] trying to get the fear out your life.
[2:08:33] You know what word I'm sick of? I'm sick
[2:08:35] of hearing my anxiety.
[2:08:37] [Applause]
[2:08:41] I'm sick of hearing that.
[2:08:46] Your parents, my parents, they never
[2:08:49] grow up talking about their anxiety.
[2:08:53] The devil didn't least unleash his
[2:08:55] vocabulary and we taking it right along
[2:08:57] with us. My anxiety,
[2:09:00] [Applause]
[2:09:02] my anxiety is troubling me.
[2:09:05] Ain't nothing but a devil of fear.
[2:09:11] He never heard of that 40 years ago.
[2:09:15] [Applause]
[2:09:17] church. Sometimes God I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:09:20] trying to close. Sometimes God will put
[2:09:23] you in situation where what's in you can
[2:09:27] come out. He just want to prove to you
[2:09:29] that you're able. So Jesus come walking
[2:09:32] on the water. Yes, my brother.
[2:09:35] And the church who had healed the sick,
[2:09:37] raised the dead, did all this stuff,
[2:09:39] they never saw him walking on water
[2:09:41] before.
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:43] So what they did,
[2:09:49] they saw God and thought he was a
[2:09:53] spirit.
[2:09:57] Let me tell you something.
[2:10:00] When things bad happen to you, it ain't
[2:10:02] always the devil.
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:08] Sometimes it's God trying to get rid of
[2:10:11] that fear.
[2:10:15] So what does he do? They begin to scream
[2:10:18] and
[2:10:19] holler. It's a spirit. He said, "Fear
[2:10:21] not."
[2:10:23] It is Ille.
[2:10:27] Peter say, "Lord,
[2:10:30] if it's you,
[2:10:32] be me to come."
[2:10:35] That was the only reason for the storm.
[2:10:39] That was the only reason Jesus was on
[2:10:41] the water.
[2:10:43] just to show Peter you can do it. Not
[2:10:46] only can you walk on water, but once you
[2:10:49] step out here, you going to control the
[2:10:51] storm.
[2:10:56] Cuz as long as he had his eyes on Jesus,
[2:10:59] the storm didn't even exist. It was
[2:11:02] going on all around him. But as long as
[2:11:05] his eyes was on Jesus, he wasn't even
[2:11:07] affected.
[2:11:08] [Applause]
[2:11:14] Jesus didn't say, "Hey, go fast for 4
[2:11:17] days.
[2:11:18] Wait till the annual meeting next year,
[2:11:20] then come on out here. Go, go, go, go,
[2:11:23] go, go, go study Christ. The mystery of
[2:11:25] God revealed." No. He said, "Come."
[2:11:31] Cuz he knew the ability to walk on water
[2:11:33] was already in him.
[2:11:36] So he said, he says, "Come." Peter says,
[2:11:40] Amen.
[2:11:42] The water was solid.
[2:11:45] The water was solid. Glory to God. He
[2:11:48] looked up and he walked straight out to
[2:11:51] Jesus.
[2:11:52] Where's your faith taking you?
[2:11:55] It should be taking you straight to
[2:11:57] Jesus.
[2:11:59] Jesus walked. He walked out there to
[2:12:01] Jesus.
[2:12:03] He walked out there to Jesus. The water
[2:12:05] was solid just like it was for Christ.
[2:12:08] Yes.
[2:12:11] Look, look. Catch this now. Catch this
[2:12:14] now. Christ in you ain't a different
[2:12:17] Christ.
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:20] He's the same Christ.
[2:12:23] And if that Christ walked on water, if
[2:12:26] Christ get in you, you will walk on
[2:12:28] water.
[2:12:32] Hey, Peter walks on water and then he
[2:12:35] starts looking at the circumstances.
[2:12:39] and everything around him and he starts
[2:12:41] to sinking listening to all the chatter
[2:12:44] when we was over when we was over at the
[2:12:47] other church. Shut up.
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:55] Care nothing about no other church. We
[2:12:57] ain't at the other church no more. God
[2:13:00] allowed that because there were some
[2:13:02] things that had to unlock.
[2:13:08] There were some things that had to
[2:13:10] unlock.
[2:13:11] [Applause]
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:16] There were some things that had to
[2:13:18] unlock.
[2:13:20] Peter gets out there. He's looking at
[2:13:22] the circumstances and he starts to sink
[2:13:24] and what does he do? Cry out to Oh Lord,
[2:13:28] Lord.
[2:13:31] Now I want you to catch this. Yes, my
[2:13:33] brother. Once you get out there,
[2:13:36] It ain't up to God to get you back.
[2:13:44] The same faith you walked out there on.
[2:13:50] The same faith you walked out there on.
[2:13:53] Brother Kenny, I don't believe when he
[2:13:55] started sinking, Jesus threw him on his
[2:13:57] shoulder and said, "Come on, let's get
[2:13:58] back in this boat."
[2:14:04] No.
[2:14:06] Once he put his eyes back on God,
[2:14:10] the manifestation of God came right back
[2:14:12] out again.
[2:14:15] The faith that walked him out there was
[2:14:18] the same faith walking him back. But
[2:14:22] this time he getting back in the boat
[2:14:24] with Jesus right beside him.
[2:14:27] [Applause]
[2:14:30] Come on musicians, I'm closing. The
[2:14:32] woman blood issue. Hallelujah.
[2:14:35] Look. Yes, sir. I'm glad you remind me
[2:14:38] that. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The woman with
[2:14:40] the blood issue. 12 years. Yes, sir.
[2:14:43] What makes her situation?
[2:14:46] 12 years. What was God doing? Uhhuh.
[2:14:50] Before all that time, she was dealing
[2:14:52] with all her circumstances. That's
[2:14:54] right. Going to this doctor, going to
[2:14:56] that, going to this meeting, that
[2:14:57] meeting, all the stuff. And then
[2:14:59] something click.
[2:15:01] Something dropped down in her. Jesus was
[2:15:04] coming. And I want you to understand, he
[2:15:08] wasn't even coming for her.
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:16] He was going someplace else, dealing
[2:15:19] with somebody else's faith.
[2:15:22] Hallelujah. But then she saw him. Yes,
[2:15:24] sir. And inspiration started to hit.
[2:15:28] Hallelujah. And this wasn't in a Bible.
[2:15:33] This wasn't a quote. She didn't get this
[2:15:36] from a preacher, but it clicked. It was
[2:15:39] already inside of her so she could speak
[2:15:42] to her situation. And then she said, "If
[2:15:45] I could touch him of his garment,
[2:15:50] I'll be made
[2:15:52] whole." Amen.
[2:15:55] The significance to that
[2:15:59] everybody else was touching them too.
[2:16:05] But they wasn't looking through faith.
[2:16:09] They wasn't in a space of faith where
[2:16:12] they were elevating their situation. She
[2:16:15] said, "If I could touch the hem of his
[2:16:17] garment, right, when she said that,
[2:16:19] somebody else touch it." And nothing
[2:16:20] happened. Right?
[2:16:24] She was expecting something
[2:16:27] and what she expected happened and in
[2:16:31] that moment she became the master of her
[2:16:34] circumstance and then she said if I
[2:16:36] could touch the him of his garment I be
[2:16:38] made whole and she fought all the way
[2:16:40] through. Amen. I ain't got time. I I
[2:16:42] can't be late to church tonight.
[2:16:46] I ain't worried about no gas prices. I
[2:16:48] ain't worried about Trump all the stuff.
[2:16:50] cars all I ain't got nothing to do with
[2:16:52] none of that. I just need to touch him.
[2:16:55] And she touched his garment. And then
[2:16:57] she said, "Oh, girl. Oh, child. Oh,
[2:17:00] Lord. Praise God. Oh, Jesus.
[2:17:04] Oh, God. Oh, God is good. Hallelujah.
[2:17:07] God is good. Hallelujah. As soon as she
[2:17:10] made contact,
[2:17:14] something happened."
[2:17:17] That's faith. Yes, sir. As soon as you
[2:17:19] make contact,
[2:17:23] something happens.
[2:17:25] Wonderful.
[2:17:27] In that moment, hallelujah. It was a
[2:17:30] truth, sir. That getting to Jesus,
[2:17:34] hallelujah, will make you the master of
[2:17:37] your circumstances.
[2:17:39] Hallelujah. Amen. So, I say to you
[2:17:42] tonight, my friend, remember the quote I
[2:17:44] read? It came out of the fundamental
[2:17:45] foundation of faith. Exactly. Right.
[2:17:48] Right. Nothing can come to you except
[2:17:51] first you're already the master of every
[2:17:53] circumstance.
[2:17:55] That is exactly right. That is exactly
[2:17:58] right. And I close with this.
[2:18:01] Hallelujah. You know what they do in in
[2:18:04] Chinese culture before they fight the
[2:18:05] battle when they meet up with one
[2:18:07] another, master to master, they look at
[2:18:10] each other, they say,
[2:18:12] "Right, right." So I'm closing. God
[2:18:16] bless you
[2:18:18] [Applause]
[2:18:23] church. I said master to master,
[2:18:26] master to master.
[2:18:29] I said master to master.
[2:18:34] Don't you know who you are?
[2:18:36] Somebody say, "I'm the master."
[2:18:39] I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the
[2:18:42] master. I'm the master. I'm the master.
[2:18:48] Hallelujah. Somebody say hallelujah.
[2:18:52] Let's give God some praise in this
[2:18:54] place.
[2:18:57] I say let's give God some praise in this
[2:19:00] place.
[2:19:02] Wonderful.
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:10] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:19:14] Praise God. Praise God. Indeed, a
[2:19:17] convention.
[2:19:19] Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[2:19:22] Hallelujah. Do you see how God works?
[2:19:26] Everybody's unique. And I love the way
[2:19:29] he preaches because he's himself. And
[2:19:32] that's what God wants you to do.
[2:19:34] Wonderful, my brother.
[2:19:37] Praise God. Oh my. Praise God. Praise
[2:19:40] God. Praise God. Amen. To every man God
[2:19:44] have given you a measure of faith. Do
[2:19:47] you remember that scripture in Peter
[2:19:48] that say the trial of what?
[2:19:52] Since when he was your faith.
[2:19:55] Ah he was preaching. Do you want him to
[2:19:58] come back again? The Bible say the trial
[2:20:01] of what? Since when he was your faith.
[2:20:06] So the trial is trying what? It means
[2:20:09] you already have that faith.
[2:20:11] So the trial is coming to unlock that
[2:20:14] faith
[2:20:18] [Applause]
[2:20:22] church. I have a quote. If you want I
[2:20:24] can put it on the group chat. Brother
[2:20:26] Brandham say Moses was born with a gift
[2:20:29] of faith.
[2:20:32] I I have the quote. You want me to put
[2:20:34] it? Okay. Brother Brandham say he was
[2:20:36] born with that faith. Amen. So Moses
[2:20:39] didn't manufacture. Why do you accept
[2:20:41] the message and some people don't? You
[2:20:44] were born with a faith to receive the
[2:20:47] message.
[2:20:50] [Applause]
[2:20:52] Amen.
[2:20:54] Church.
[2:20:59] I told you my ministry we preaching you
[2:21:03] to go to the rapture. Amen. But before
[2:21:05] you go to the rapture, while we still
[2:21:08] here on earth, we must experience God.
[2:21:13] [Applause]
[2:21:16] So stop playing fake stuff, super super
[2:21:19] super spiritual people
[2:21:25] until we take mediocrity
[2:21:28] and we accept it for humbleness. That's
[2:21:30] wrong.
[2:21:32] God is putting you through those
[2:21:33] situation so you can unlock the faith.
[2:21:38] Who knew that that trial? Who knew that
[2:21:40] what is happening there is for people I
[2:21:43] mean it's for Peter to walk on the
[2:21:45] water.
[2:21:47] That's true. If it never happened, we
[2:21:49] would never have a story of somebody
[2:21:52] walking on the water. And I may even
[2:21:54] shock you. Peter did it without the Holy
[2:21:57] Ghost.
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:10] If a man without the Holy Ghost is doing
[2:22:13] that,
[2:22:15] how much more a child of God with the
[2:22:18] spirit of the Lord,
[2:22:22] church, this is a powerful message right
[2:22:25] here. Yes, I would even advise you go
[2:22:28] home and listen to that again. Remember
[2:22:30] God told you about the season
[2:22:33] and after the season he's bringing a
[2:22:35] message that remember you have a faith a
[2:22:38] faith that have been built in you for
[2:22:41] the season because brother Brandham only
[2:22:44] opened the top
[2:22:46] as an example. Brother Brown open the
[2:22:48] top to tell you the season has come.
[2:22:57] My brother, God bless you. Oh my. Oh my.
[2:23:01] Oh my.
[2:23:03] It's hard even to get here. I I put it
[2:23:07] in the hand of God. You know this church
[2:23:10] when we came to look at that church at
[2:23:12] this church it was not like this. No
[2:23:14] sir. You know that right? You know that
[2:23:17] right? And when I came to look at this
[2:23:19] church I was not even a pastor. I was
[2:23:22] not even elected a pastor. Do you know
[2:23:24] what happened? Do you know what
[2:23:26] happened? Can I say it? Do you know what
[2:23:28] happened? We came with the committee.
[2:23:31] We got in here and then I look at the
[2:23:34] building. I look at the building. I went
[2:23:36] home and I pulled the plan and I told
[2:23:38] the brother I
[2:23:40] say if I'm a
[2:23:42] pastor I will buy that church and we can
[2:23:46] divide this here and put bathrooms and
[2:23:48] the bathroom will be here and we will do
[2:23:50] this this this and that's exactly what
[2:23:52] happened back then.
[2:23:55] I didn't have the money. I was not even
[2:23:57] a pastor. I was not even elected. Amen.
[2:24:02] I'm giving you that example to tell you
[2:24:04] finch you don't see. That's why Bam say
[2:24:07] whatever the Lord leads your soul to
[2:24:11] believe it is yours.
[2:24:14] [Applause]
[2:24:20] God led brother Brandham for the square.
[2:24:23] He led him for the karibu. Yours might
[2:24:25] not be the square. Watch what God is
[2:24:28] leading your soul to believe. And I have
[2:24:31] a news for you. You who want to be super
[2:24:34] super super spiritual. Brother Brandham
[2:24:36] say I would never stand on the way of
[2:24:40] somebody who want to take God at his
[2:24:42] word. So when I'm proclaiming my stuff,
[2:24:45] leave me alone
[2:24:48] because it might not be your leadership.
[2:24:50] It is my leadership. I will believe it
[2:24:53] and I will walk to it. The other
[2:24:55] disciple never asked Jesus to leave the
[2:24:58] boat.
[2:25:00] Everybody was quiet watching Jesus. But
[2:25:02] why was there only Peter? Because there
[2:25:05] was something in Peter. Peter didn't
[2:25:08] say, "Hey guys, you waiting for me?" No,
[2:25:10] my season has come. You stay in the
[2:25:12] boat. Me, I'm going.
[2:25:17] Are we together? That's why brother
[2:25:19] Brandham say Peter is
[2:25:21] faith. Amen.
[2:25:26] That's right. When God comes, don't wait
[2:25:29] for who is next to you. Move on. This is
[2:25:32] a powerful message. God spoke to you. So
[2:25:35] plain.
[2:25:39] We hardly talk with him.
[2:25:42] We just checked. I mean text like,
[2:25:44] "Okay, preach, preach. Okay, okay, okay.
[2:25:46] That's it." I didn't tell him what to
[2:25:48] preach. He didn't know what was preached
[2:25:49] here. He didn't know what we preach here
[2:25:52] even on Sunday and everything. He's
[2:25:53] coming up with all the where is he
[2:25:55] knowing all of this?
[2:25:59] The spirit of prophecy.
[2:26:04] The spirit it's written in the book of
[2:26:06] revelation. I can give you quote on the
[2:26:08] spirit of prophecy. That anointing is
[2:26:11] working and God is telling you. In other
[2:26:13] words, don't take this as an ordinary
[2:26:15] service.
[2:26:17] This is not brother Cadri. It was God in
[2:26:20] our brother speaking to this church.
[2:26:24] [Applause]
[2:26:27] He doesn't know what is going on
[2:26:29] silently outside. The trustee knows. The
[2:26:32] deacon knows. This the the treasurer
[2:26:36] knows what is going on outside here. You
[2:26:38] might not see it. We seeing it. Amen.
[2:26:41] You have not seen it yet. You will see
[2:26:43] it in manifestation.
[2:26:45] But I'm already seeing it. And God is
[2:26:47] talking to me. is telling me something.
[2:26:52] Because if I look at where the church is
[2:26:54] and how young the church is and the
[2:26:56] challenge, I will say I won't do it. But
[2:26:58] because I'm looking at Christ, I don't
[2:27:01] care what it is, we will make it.
[2:27:05] [Applause]
[2:27:09] Oh, glory to God.
[2:27:13] It was not me who had in heart to call
[2:27:15] him. It was God who put him in the heart
[2:27:19] that today he will be speaking here.
[2:27:22] Take this seriously. Whatever trial you
[2:27:25] going, remember you were born to be the
[2:27:28] master of everything.
[2:27:33] And I'm going to close by this.
[2:27:36] Go search. The first quil came quickly.
[2:27:44] The second one came quickly.
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:49] The third one lingers
[2:27:52] and brother Brandham say do you see how
[2:27:54] God is training his people and brother
[2:27:57] Brandham got tired he say I'm leaving
[2:28:00] that's when God say hey you say three
[2:28:05] [Applause]
[2:28:10] do the
[2:28:12] visionary wait
[2:28:15] it will come to pass.
[2:28:18] Go back to that prayer line. Go back to
[2:28:21] that closet. I'm just summarizing
[2:28:23] everything. Go back to that prayer line.
[2:28:25] Go back and keep your eyes on Jesus.
[2:28:29] Hallelujah. Lord, you have been built
[2:28:32] for this, my brother. God richly bless
[2:28:35] you. Let's give the Lord a big
[2:28:41] clap. Let's pray.
[2:28:44] Heavenly Father, Hallelujah. Lord, we
[2:28:47] are so humbled again tonight, Lord.
[2:28:51] By this love that is beyond our
[2:28:54] understanding, Father, that you left so
[2:28:57] many places to come down tonight,
[2:29:01] Lord, and Father, to grant unto us the
[2:29:04] desire of our heart, Lord. Throughout
[2:29:07] the day, we've been praying, working,
[2:29:09] praying, praying for this service,
[2:29:12] coming together, praying, Lord, that you
[2:29:14] speak to us, Father. And Lord, you came
[2:29:17] down in a supernatural way. You use our
[2:29:21] brother in a powerful way, and you spoke
[2:29:23] not only for this audience, but also for
[2:29:26] the invisible audience. Your children
[2:29:28] are all over the world that will take a
[2:29:30] hold of this promise of this sermon
[2:29:33] tonight Lord and be delivered for
[2:29:35] whatever situation they going through.
[2:29:38] Father thank you for speaking to us. May
[2:29:40] Lord Father this sermon always remain
[2:29:42] center into our heart Lord. Father as we
[2:29:46] go into our respective place give us
[2:29:48] travel mercy protect our brother Lord.
[2:29:51] strengthen him, Lord, Father. Remember
[2:29:54] all the sacrifice he's doing for your
[2:29:56] kingdom, Lord, and give him travel mercy
[2:29:58] so that he can go back, Lord, and find
[2:30:00] his family safe and sound, Lord. Father,
[2:30:03] bless him, Lord, and bless this church,
[2:30:05] Father. We commit everything unto the
[2:30:08] hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:30:12] Go ahead and
[2:30:29] say one day I'm going to take a step
[2:30:35] toward my
[2:30:37] theop. One day I'm going to take another

[2:36:30] world. Come up. Come up a little higher.
[2:36:34] Little higher into the love. Just love a
[2:36:41] little
[2:36:42] higher through the
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:47] heavenly. Oh my
[2:36:52] god. It's falling. It's falling. Come
[2:36:55] on. Come on, little higher. Little
[2:36:58] higher to the perfect
[2:37:02] world. Come on a little
[2:37:05] higher to
[2:37:09] me. Just come up a little higher.
[2:37:13] Higher.
[2:37:15] The
[2:37:16] heavens find the opening. Oh my
[2:37:22] [Music]
[2:37:42] go Heat.
[2:38:03] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:38:08] [Music]
