day one in the morning one before you go to bed everybody's reading the Cod book The Church ages the 70 weeks and the seals I will always remind you when I get to heaven I say father I always tell them about that you can go on YouTube and see it because it's going to be on the cloud amen do you know that everything that we do is staying somewhere unless you repent and the blood of Jesus Christ will wipe it if you don't repent it stays somewhere there brother Bram says that even the word that Jesus spoke are still circulating the Earth right now amen so we want to keep the good things in the air so that when they try to claim it they won't see it because the blood of the Lamb already wiped it amen glory glory hallelujah amen amen amen great news I don't know if I need to say it first but for some reason let me hold on to it until the surprise come in right okay I already got the signal from the one it's coming from so when it happened you will see it in flesh in flesh in flesh so just hold on to it it's coming amen let me hold on to it it's coming amen glory be to the name of the Lord next Saturday August the 26th Lord's willing this is when we have our young sisters meeting the

the 2nd that's the Young's men meeting and September the 16th this is when we have our question and answerers so August the 26 this month September 2nd next month Young's men meeting a followup for them and then September 16 that's when we have our question and answer I believe I covered everything by the grace of God so let's go straight to our scripture this morning glory to God Amen Genesis chapter 1 again we going back to our scripture from last Sunday I told brother Robert this morning I say uh paraphrasing this thing is loaded so I don't know how far we will be able to move but let's see what the holy spirit will allow us to go through amen I know my co-pilots are not here brother Charles you ready for it amen you got the yellow one right okay praise God so today you're going to try it a new cor pilot in training amen glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen Genesis 1 verse 26 glory to God you know this now pretty good and God say let us we already answered these questions make man in our own image after our what likeness okay it's working after our likeness and let them have dominion not one person because it's them let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the Earth a and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth you might be seated right here man is not created yet this is just God expressing his desire to what he's about to create God created the herbs he created the trees he created the fow he created everything now this is at the evening of the sixth day now God have a project amen so whatever we just read here in Genesis 1:26 is just what God has as a project amen man is not created yet are we reading the same Bible let me read it over again and God say let us make men it is a plan it's a project God have not made men yet amen amen let us make man in our image after our what and let them have what Dominion so in other word before Adam existed we okay before Adam is created amen Adam already was that's it are we together are we together amen Adam already was and God is already opening the very plan yes sir the very purpose purpose amen of why what he's trying to create am sir and why is he trying to create it amen God is already explaining it before even one Speck of Adam is manifested everybody okay so what you are on brother today sir and the purpose of God for you today already existed on on now brother Adam didn't have a mother sir no sir come on Adam didn't have a father a natural father Adam is a man the only man that didn't have a belly button that's it in other word this thing happened before your mother even exist Lord before mama and daddy even get married that's it God already knew what he's going to do with you everybody okay so there is a pre-plan if I can call it that way there is a pre-plan amen that already existed and it's described Amen Let Me remove that word pre-plan so he help somebody there is a plan amen that God had for you before you were even created amen God wanted to achieve two things with Adam the first thing God want Adam to look like him everybody okay that's why Adam must have the image and the likeness of God Amen the second part is Adam is not created just to look like God in other word god did not create Adam just to create somebody God had a purpose for Adam amen he had a mission he had a thought that he want Adam to fulfill the second thing is the purpose amen amen of creating Adam what is the purpose and the purpose of Adam is to have dominion in other word God created everything but he want somebody who's going to be on top of [Applause] everything he want the president of what he has created he created the trees he created the fishes he created the bird he created the elephant he created the zebra and all that when he finishes he wants somebody to be in charge somebody to be in control somebody to be responsible a steward for everything that he has created that's the purpose of creating Adam so Adam is not just created for God to see how he can make a man that's it am amen come on Adam is created to take care of certain things and give God a [Music] breakes it is that's why when God created Adam the Bible say in the seventh day God did what because there is nothing else God have to do anymore it is up to Adam to take over begin to do what God is supposed to do in other word God wanted to rest sir sir but for God to rest he wants you to be dead yes Lord so when God create you it's for God to rest yes sir yes sir when God activat you in your life it is for God to rest everybody okay everybody okay so the purpose of Adam is to take control is to rule is to take over Amen to have dominion over everything so that God can get a break everybody good have lost somebody because sometime I look at your facial expression then I know somebody's probably have not gotten it yet so I have to break it down again so we make sure we all soak it in amen go verse 27 so God did what created now God is creating amen So the plan of Adam the purpose of Adam Even Adam himself doesn't know it come on now brother when God purposed for Adam Adam was not there yet that's right that's right it was a purpose within God yes sir amen so when God has created Adam Adam doesn't know why God has created him the way he is the mystery is still with God sir yes sir yes sir and God doesn't talk to anybody he say let us so God was talking to God so that nobody understand what he's trying to do so when he finished talking with God God created Adam when Adam is created Adam is just existing but he doesn't know come on now brother who am I come on now brother what am I doing here amen that secret is in God before he created Adam that's right we okay so every potential is in Adam Adam created is unconscious of who he is everybody okay everybody good he is God but somebody need to tell him that's right somebody need to tell Moses who he is come on brother am amen somebody need to tell him amen his mother told him he killed some but when God told him Moses was different when God spoke to Moses who he was things changed but he was born already a liberator but they have to tell him if not he's going to behave like an Egyptian there it is there it is come on now come on uh verse 27 so God created man in his own what image in other words God is now doing what he plan that's right created uh in his own image Amen in the image of God created he him male and female created he them that part is fulfilled the part of creating is fulfilled is now a history amen but the part of let him have dominion God have not done that yet that's correct amen we okay now jum to verse 26 and God did what bless them so despite who you are sir despite what you were created for am you need a blessing that blessing doesn't put stuff in you the blessing doesn't bring the potential of Adam in him that's right Adam is created with potential the blessing don't add anymore sir if you can work we can move I me it's a traffic like I on 85 okay amen but God blessed them and God said to them so the blessing of God comes with an instruction amen scripture have layer I'm just peeling a layer God didn't just come and say bless you and Adam goes no when God is blessing Adam he is also saying something so the blessing of God comes with some words sir some instructions that's right that's right there is a blessing of God and the blessing is couple with instructions amen or it's couple with some words or it's coupled with a revelation amen amen everybody okay everybody okay this instruction that God is about to say is not different than what God had for Adam before he created him remember when Adam is created he doesn't know who he is but before Adam is created God had a plan when God created Adam he's coming to bless him but when he's blessing Adam and Eve he's giving instruction that instruction is an unfolding a revelation of what God had in mind about Adam and [Music] eveen it is not to add anything it's just to let you know who you are amen and what you were created for what is the purpose of your life now you are already existing I need to tell you why I created you and what you are supposed to do and what is your responsibility and what I'm expecting out of your life because once that is defined it tells you what to do and what not to do that's it come on you remember Wednesday yes sir do you remember Wednesday do you remember Wednesday if you know that you're coming in this church this morning you know which road you took and you know which road you didn't take you didn't take your road to work that's right because the destination is not work everything you were doing this morning was Chann out toward going to church your taking of shower was to go to church your clothing is not the work clothing you took the clothing according to the destination you dress according to the destination you prepare according to the destination even the car you drove this morning is not the car you go with it to work yes sir everything you did this morning and the agenda you have this morning is around your Des so when the destination is revealed it begin to organize your life if I can get this in you amen it will make your life easy if not you will continue to try the will of God today you you think it's this this this and you don't understand and you will continue to copy one another that's it brother you will continue to have Mentor come on brother you will continue to chase after somebody if he does something you do it if he does something you do it because you don't know your destination there it is the day you will know your destination you will keep your l [Applause] if our noral destination me and brother Charles are on the highway but brother Charles is keeping his Lane and I'm also keeping my Lane because we have different destination sir Hallelujah if you don't know your destination this is when we copy one another this is what this is when we trying to be somebody else right we will try to dress like somebody we will try to talk like somebody we will try to even maneuver like somebody that's why I am who I am that's why I preach my own way I learn from the elders but I don't copy the elders I don't copy their move I have to have my own move because my move were created for a purpose my voice was created for a purpose my eyes were created for a purpose my height was created for a purpose my complexion was created for a purpose I am proud of who I am I am proud of my nose I am proud of my ear I am proud of the way God created me because I'm created special for special Mission why should I copy you why should I copy you it's an [Applause] impersonation you are not original that's why it's so hard you have to check Eng in all the time be you you makee a plan for you that's why he made you like you are that's the best he found for [Applause] you and he deals with us individually the plan of God the blessing of God are coming with instruction the instruction is to reveal to you the very purpose God Made You On Earth everybody okay everybody okay so when you are receiving instruction it is God telling you what you supposed to do everybody okay this instruction will restructure your entire life it will change your motive it will change your objective it will change how you utilize your time amen amen amen amen because you are utilizing your time according to where you going that's right if you have to take a flight you won't be playing around you have to put your luggage together if you have to go to work you're not going to play on the internet till 300 a.m. you need more sleep because you're going to wake up so everything is structured according to where you going that's why the Bible say lack of vision my people perish because Vision removeth trouble from you ites it Narrows your road and give you a clear path of where you need to go amen we need that instruction we need that instruction sir Hallelujah everybody good lost anyone no okay verse 28 he says be fruitful if he did say be fruitful it means in you you have what fruit so God is explaining you to do what pull it out God didn't say to Adam I'm putting fruit in you amen amen in other word you have stuff in you begin to pull it out let me continue he said be fruitful amen and do what multiply did you see God telling him I'm going to teach you how to multiply sir multiply and do what replenish the Earth how is he going to replenish the Earth Adam was not a man in flesh how is he going to multiply and uh and replenish the Earth how replenish the Earth with what he's a spirit how is he going to replenish the Earth how was God replenishing the Earth amen and do it subdo it amen in other words take full control of the Earth make sure everything in the earth is under you am in other way you make the Earth obey you that's why you heard brother Bram say Adam could move stuff the message is perfectly in line with the scripture in other word if Adam come and say Mountain you cannot be there the M have to obey Adam and say uh uh Master where do you want me to go he say move over there and the mountain goes and move they say why did you move he say because Adam say [Applause] it not because God say because the Earth is already given to [Applause] Adam father help me in so 115 verse 16 the Bible say the what the what even the what are the what so the universe don't belong to you it belongs to God Amen whatever happen in the zodiac god is responsible for everybody okay but the what we need to know our band so we know what belongs to us the sun belongs to God the moon let God handle that even though sometime I can handle also that that's right everybody okay but the Earth has he given to the what children of if they would have said to Adam you would have left that to Adam and you put yourself out that's correct amen God said the children of men plural am so the Earth belong for to you and me where is that scripture coming from because from the beginning they Tau man that you need to rule over everything that is on the earth in other word God is not responsible for what is going on on the earth it belongs to man to hander the Earth you have your house but you gave to your son his bedroom whatever happened in the bedroom is to the son to take care of the bedroom that's correct that's right the remaining of the house belongs to you the bedroom is for the boy or for the girl the Earth in the universe that little chamber that room belongs to me amen amen God have given to me Hallelujah when I say that your man this this thing here is a problem this thing amen he says have dominion over the fishes of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Water everything was given to man that's the purpose a purpose before you are created and when you are created you don't know yet you are unconscious of the purpose of God so when the blessing of God are coming they're coming with an instruction amen so the instruction of God is a blessing the instruction of God is a blessing when God speak to you it's already a blessing because you shall know the truth and the truth shall do what you shall know the truth if you know the truth the truth changes you when you know the truth the truth changes you if they tell you today that your father is the big boss over there that is there that own I don't know if 70 companies how are you going to behave how are you going to behave would you rem are you going to remember your supervisor again huh huh if you have a depth that has been bothering you and they tell you they say you see that man over there that your father he's coming he's coming to take you and to explain to you that you were his son all along and you see him in the morning and they come they say tomorrow you going to leave this home you're going to leave in another home what does it do to you all your depression goes away do you know what you're going to do to your supervisor you say God bless you how are you doing I'm not coming to work anymore what makes you do that because you knew something what you know begin to set you free from everything that was blocking you I'm insisting because this instruction will free you that's correct the instruction the woman the well last Sunday free her when she just knew that this is the Messiah that said the Messiah never prayed for her all the sickness were gone some sickness come because of pressure that's brother am amen everybody okay let's go to Genesis 18 father help me the holy spirit is lingering in this channel so you understand one thing once he will take off from this channel whoever didn't get it it's going to be up to you and God because God will move he won't linger all the time if he lingers he's saying something either you catch it you get your blessing if not he move on to a different territory and later on when I'm going to ask you I say do you remember we talk about it and you say I don't remember because your mind was somewhere when God was trying to talk to you so let's keep our mind focused amen Genesis 18:10 if you dare you can say amen amen sometime I'm trying to read more quote I just read three and he locks me and I go home and he add more because he's doing everything so you can catch what he's saying Genesis 18:10 if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God the Bible says this and he said Elohim I will certainly return to you according to the time of life you know that very good amen the 28th day ccle we already went through number 28 and the cloud and everything amen and lo Sarah your wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were how and how well stricken in ag Abraham Abraham and Sarah amen were old and well stricken in age in other word they were well done when you look at them they are really well done when you look you cannot even think twice whether they are old or not they are really old even in the dark you can tell that that man is an old man that's and God is telling somebody like that that you going to I have a son not in the 50s because in the 50s we can begin to argue with signs correct correct when it's impossible God say you going to have a son amen amen amen verse n 11 he well sing in the age and he ceased to be with Sarah after the man of what woman so in other word it's fin there is no more room to have a baby no more room when they say it Sease to be in other words scientifically it cannot happen God even went to the detail of Sarah so we understand the the the the the complexity of the situation because you must say okay in those time the people were living 700 years ago and 900 years ago so maybe Sarah was already buing God say I know how you going to think you will begin to to let me go even down and lock that up that hey she hey hey everything was finished so now there is no room for you to say Adam Liv 700 years ago maybe I mean 200 years ago somebody was still younger uh God doesn't want you to think like that we okay now verse 12 therefore Sarah did what do you see why Sarah laugh now you understand why she laugh because she looks she say maybe the food is so good that's why this men begin to talk stuff like [Music] this me me Sarah amen Sarah laugh where within herself within herself saying after I am wax l oh shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also is a marriage and divorce here everybody okay in other word nothing was happening between Sarah and Abraham nothing they were like brothers and sisters jum to verse uh 13 I leave the other one for marriage and divorce verse 13 and the Lord say to Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying Shala of aity bear a which I am what too hard for the who it in other word the laugh of Sarah is a laugh of unbelief it's a laugh that something like this cannot happen that's right and God discern and say do you think something is too hard for me amen amen is there anything too hard for what the Lord did somebody answer this question no there is a question that is given is something is there anything let me read it okay is there what anything too hard for the Lord anything not the situation of Sarah only but anything not only Sarah but anything is there anything you can look over your life that is too hard for me to hand anything hard for the Lord amen that's a question we need the answer at that at the time appointed amen I will return so there is a specific time according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a what a everybody clear so far we clear let's go now to look brother Rob do we have another Sharpie please amen if you thereare you can say Amen let's pray then we continue Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you for Your Grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us

touch those that are struggling in the body in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's go to Luke chapter 1 if you thereare you can say amen amen verse 5 Hallelujah there was in the days of Herod the King of Judea a certain priest named Zechariah of the course of abah and his wife was the was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth so we got Zechariah thank you my brother and Elizabeth amen amen amen verse six and they were both righteous before God everybody okay walking in the in in all the Commandments and ordinances of the Lord how blameless we Okay we okay verse seven and they had no what Tri because that Elizabeth was how is Elizabeth different than Sarah we okay we we okay did Sarah and Abraham have a child yes sir no was Sarah bearing amen and they both were now how well stricken in years can you look in can you look at my board Abraham and Sarah was how Elizabeth and Zechariah was w we okay are we okay so this case is matching the case of Elizabeth and zar we okay amen okay job to verse uh 18 if you dare you can say amen amen and Zechariah said to the angel whereby shall I know this for I am old an old man and my wife is how well stricken in years we already there we okay amen it is confirmed from their own mouth in other word how can this happen the way we are we are not old we are well stricken in years we okay jum to verse 26 now we get it you there amen and in the sixth month the angel the angel Gabriel will sent from God to a city of Galilee named who Nazareth so in here we have two women we have Elizabeth amen and Elizabeth bear a child by the name of John everybody okay and another woman who is called Mary and Mary bear Christ everybody clear amen everybody clear and a woman in the Bible is a church right so we got a church burying Elizabeth by the name of Elizabeth and that church will bear John that's right amen and another church will bear Christ and those church are together in connection verse 26 amen 27 to a virgin is passed to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came into her and say hell you that are how highly favored God spoke in Eden and God say the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent who is that woman we don't know her that's right it is lock under the seven seal we okay then later on with asaiah Isaiah come and say you know what a virgin shall conceive amen yes sir now we have more information that is not just a woman but that woman will be a virgin but who is that woman we don't know because many women any woman that is born is a virgin but who is going to fulfill that promise it is hidden in the plan of God so now we found a Woman by the name of Mary so before Mary was born 800 years ago away from Eden so when God was saying the seed of the woman God had Mary in the [Applause] mind everybody okay when Isaiah was talking a virgin shall conceive he was not any virgin he was Mary in the mind but Mary was not aware of who she [Music] is she needed an instruction to reveal to her the purpose of God in her life are we together Adam didn't know who he was he needed an instruction Mary thought she was just a fiance to somebody she didn't know she was the one chosen amen until then she cannot produce what God sent her to produce so to produce what God sent her to produce she need the blessing of the Lord with instruction she need a revelation everybody good I'm inist that's why brother Bram say I can never overemphasize the need up a revelation for a Believer Revelation give you power Revelation give you the authority over the Devil Revelation changes your world verse 28 Lord help me and the Lord came into her and said the angel came into her and say hell you that are how now Mary knows that she was highly favored amen maybe she didn't she thought that she was a nobody now an instruction come the first instruction is you are highly favored amen you have to come on brother okay you are highly favored the Lord is how with stop Hallelujah Hallelujah do you see any scripture in the Bible that says that Mary had Visions sir do you see any scripture in the Bible that says that Mary had maybe miracle in her life so when Mary was unconscious of the purpose of God for her life God was with her GL GL can you please help me preaching huh the angel didn't say now that I come God begin to be with you the Lord the angel said the Lord is with you in other word even when you thought God was not with you God was already with [Applause] you whenever you are doing whatever you were doing there

instruction amen so there could be something in Mary's life that the angel need to crank come on brother it come Lex I will show you that if I can reach where I'm going amen so the angel need to start fixing you up that's right that's right because whatever they're trying to deliver is bigger to believe oh my God yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir did you get me come on yes Sir Gabriel never came and say you're going to Bear a child Mary cannot handle that it's too too strong amen Mary need to be at a certain level Jesus never revealed to the woman they wear until that woman reach a certain level

the atomic bomb now if you begin to see that it's a prophet if you begin to understand that it's a prophet then what come down near it everybody okay so right here the angel doesn't come and say you a virgin you're going to have a child Mary can even pass out completely like what pass out what are you talking about the angel say hhhhh you are highly favored highly favor the Lord is with you ah

you want to say go ahead and just deliver the [Music] package but to deliver the package whatever they already spoke is already anesthetizing the sister because somebody's telling her you are the good sister better than all the sister it's already working in the pastor is reading the scripture and he's teaching you the scripture okay don't come and say my pastor taught me this from the scripture everybody okay everybody good amen verse 30 you there amen and the angel said to her do what fear not in other word chill out huh sister chill out it's okay it's okay there's never why you trouble

time have just come that they have to unfold verse uh 31 and behold you shall receive in your what now they begin to deliver your the message behold you shall conceive in your womb and bring forth a and shall call his name what Jesus for the first time the name of God is revealed the first time the name of God that was seal in the entire Old Testament the first time they open that name a name that nobody knew even the people in the Old Testament they even ask God they say what is your name God say why do you ask for my name it is marvelous that's right Isaiah tried to explain the name he could not he said he's a mighty God Prince of cons those are not the name they try the Hebrew they say g v v h and they come up with Jehovah but Jehovah is not the [Applause] name Hallelujah the first time the name of God is revealed is revealed to a [Applause] woman yes Hallelujah a personal revelation of Jesus Christ Hall everybody okay everybody okay they are delivering the the the word instruction verse uh 32 he shall be how great and shall be called the what son of the highest in other word you going to receive a child amen that child name is Jesus but I want you to understand who that child is it is not a normal child you are bearing God the son of the most high because the Son of God means God we already went through that in other way you going to Bear God everybody okay and the Lord God shall give to him the what Throne the Throne of his father what in other words you going to Bear not just just a son who is God but the king everybody okay they are still unloading the USB is done loading amen job to verse 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob how forever in other words your son is a guarantee for the throne of Israel and in his kingdom there shall be what they cannot stop the kingdom of what you're trying to bring in word whatever Mary is bringing forth will remain forever Mary is about to produce the word yes sir and the word marage producing is a word that will abide forever come on Lord amen can I continue verse 3 uh 34 then say Mary to the angel how is this be seeing a what no not a man in other word wait a minute I understand now the package but there is a a problem here you know that you have a child you know what he mean right the angel say I understand what you mean he said so me how is going to happen in other word who am I going to have that child with everybody okay you see Mary is still in the corner but they need to take her and begin to bring her up we ready get this now verse 35 and the angel answer and said to her the what Holy Ghost shall what come upon me and the power of the highest shall do what overshadow me so what God intended for you to bring forth you are not the one to bring it [Applause] out everybody okay you need the Holy Ghost to unfold that to you Adam needed the blessing of God and the instructions amen everybody okay what God want to fulfill in your life is all way will be fulfilled only after the Holy Ghost come upon you that's right so to produce your purpose or to manifest what God prepare you to manifest you need the help of God to bring your project out that's right amen have I lost someone he says the Holy Ghost shall come upon you you and the power of the highest everybody okay shall do what overshadow you therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called what Son of God you have nothing to do with this thing you need the spirit of the Lord to bring that out everybody okay everybody good jum to verse 36 and behold your who cousin who Elizabeth so God to convince Mary he's using two things for Mary to bring the impossible out of her life she need two keys everybody good the first key she need the Holy Ghost that's right the Holy Ghost to come and to overshadow her amen everybody okay the second key she need a [Applause] [Music] testimony not any kind of testimony a testimony that is at the level of what she's trying to produce everybody okay a testimony of Elizabeth is a testimony of the impossible because a virgin bringing a child is impossible everybody okay so Mary needed one the Holy Ghost two she needed a testimony amen but not any kind of testimony a testimony of Elizabeth but the testimony of Elizabeth is the testimony that matches [Applause] Sarah everybody okay everybody okay everybody good remember Elizabeth was burying what John John and Mary's burying what so to produce Christ in your life you need the Holy Ghost and you need the testimony that happened in the Church of Elizabeth rephrase it again John was a forarm of [Applause] Christ everybody okay and John was the spirit of Elijah [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good so to produce Christ in your life you need the Holy Ghost and the testimony that happen in the ministry of [Applause] Elijah everybody okay everybody okay everybody good you need the Holy Ghost and a testimony from the ministry of [Applause] elah everybody okay but the testimony of the ministry of Elijah matches Genesis 18 in plain word what are you trying to say to produce Christ today you need the Holy Ghost and you need what happened in BR bram's [Applause] life everybody okay The Impossible in BR Bram life is that a man can create Square so that was put the third pool was put there to prepare your testimony so that when the Holy Ghost bring you something you need to look at what God is bringing you and remember what he did with Malachi [Applause] 4 in other word when God open up something to you and whatever he open up is too big for you remember what he did with brother Bram it's an example that nothing is impossible that's why brother Bram say the level God uses the messenger is an example for the people of his [Applause] age everybody good Mary need two things you need the spirit of the Lord and the testimony coming from Elijah [Music] in other words when you are struggling remember Elizabeth remember the impossible and Elizabeth REM you Genesis 18 when you begin to struggle remember the god that can stop the storm that can create square that can resurrect the fish that can give the Holy Spirit to right children remember that God he did it many time to help you build up your [Applause] faith are we together are we together I have not read nothing my friend everybody okay everybody good where are we at my friend 36 36 and behold your cousin who El Elizabeth she shall also do what conceive a son in her what old age old age and this is the what six month with her with her who was her called Baron in other words she's no longer Barren amen amen remember Elizabeth and Zechariah matches what Abraham and Sarah and in Abraham and Sarah God ask a question he say is there anything what to for the Lord now God is answering that question the answer is in the New Testament do you want to know the answer let's read the next verse verse 37 what is it for with God what nothing shall be impossible with God what nothing shall be how so the answer of Genesis 18 is answer in the New [Applause] Testament everybody okay in other word I'm pointing you to the impossible so that you understand that when I bring something to you never doubt that's right if you doubt remember what I did there I am the yesterday today and forever how is he going to be it is not you it is the Holy Ghost everybody okay everybody good let's go to verse 38 and Mary said what behold the hand of the Lord behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to your what word and the angel did what from in other word when they took they explained number one the Holy Ghost will do it number two do you remember your The Impossible you see how it happened right Mary say that's it that's it that's it now that I have a backup testimony be unto me according to what brother Bram said she didn't feel nothing that's right she didn't see feel cold chills coming up like oh faith is entering just what she say the right word there it is just submitting herself amen that's it because the answer of Genesis 18 now is answer back we got the answer the answer is what with God what nothing impossible but I know one thing that is impossible to God I know that I can tell you one thing that is impossible to God you want to know it you want to know what is impossible to God if you want to know it say amen amen you want to know what is impossible to God the Bible say in Hebrews 6 that by what two imitable things in which he was how imposs for God to do what [Applause] [Applause] all things are impossible to God but there is one thing God cannot do is to tell a lie in other word when God tell you [Applause] something yes sir when God promise you something yes sir God can never go back and change it Paul is saying that it is impossible for God to do what we might have a what not just a consolation in other word when you are waiting for the promise and it seems like it's not happening remember God doesn't lie [Applause] yes Lord God can do anything but not try in other word whatever God put it's finished you can rest your soul there and know that it's going to [Applause] happen everybody okay everybody okay is there anything too hard for the Lord no with God what nothing the guarantee is what 100% guarantee he cannot lie in other word he cannot change I am the Lord and I changes if I determine that I'm going to use Mary I have no more option that's why you will see God like begging Moses Jesus oh my God God was begging Gideon when Mo say I don't want to go he said no no no no no I have uh I have already taken care of it Moses say okay if I go but they won't believe me okay I give you this go show them the first sign okay if they don't listen show them the second sign if they don't God have to do everything to convince Moses because he doesn't have a second choice if you bring anybody to deliver Israel they will fail because they are not built for deliverance and not only is all things impossible possible to God but we saw last Sunday that be Jesus say if that can what what all are possible to what so if you have faith hallu All Things become you become like God right everybody okay everybody okay Jesus says this in Matthew 17 and Jesus say unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if ye Have Faith remember Faith have there as a gra of what must you shall say unto this mountain remove H Adam to Y the place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you what I just brought right now nothing is impossible to God nothing is impossible to you what God want you to have is just have faith if you have faith you become like God everybody good everybody good my subject this morning yes Lord on Hallelujah sir everybody okay everybody okay are you full Are You full you want to go home my subject this morning is unlocking your Divine [Music] mystery on come shake somebody's hand and say God bless you [Music] glory to God you ready are you ready amen are you ready am are you ready when we talk about CH women bearing and having children it's not a mystery you know that is not a mystery we have a testimony right here in the midst of us you know that you know that there is a sister who searched for a child 11 years they did everything that the doctor could do they search they search they search no child everybody okay her husband came and as she coming to this church sister is right there with a baby amen after 11 years with God nothing is impossible with God nothing is impossible nothing is impossible with God nothing is impossible everything they tried didn't work she didn't even know she was pregnant so when the blessing of God come you don't even know when it's coming Hall this blessing shall overtake [Applause] you let me try to see if I can preach what I'm trying to preach unlocking your Divine Water mystery if you notice the word mystery is singular am everybody okay and somebody asked me a question from last Sunday say Pastor you ask you say by the bottom say we need to know everybody need to search God's will God's mystery for their own life now are you talking about the mystery of their life or are you talking about knowing God's will for their life or knowing God's will for maybe some specific things that they doing we Okay we okay the Bible says this in Revelation 10 verse 7 that but in the days of the voice of the what seventh angel when he shall begin to do what the what mystery of God the mystery of God should be how if you look the Bible uses mystery singular that's right [Music] please verify your Bible the Bible uses mystery singular we the one that say Mysteries everybody okay then when brother Bram was interpreting this scripture brother Bram used a second scripture which is Matthew 13:1 and brother Bram couple the scripture together and in Matthew 13:1 the Bible say he answer and say unto them because it is given unto who you to know the what Mysteries plural of the kingdom of what heaven but unto them it is not what brother Bram from there begin to show that it's not just one mystery if you go to the sermon God uh sir is this the son of the end time you will see brother bam giving a list of mystery mystery number one mystery number two mystery number three mystery number four all the way down the Bible say in the Book of Revelation it is Mystery singular of God but in Matthew it is Mystery plural what is the problem there brother Bram say the entire Bible is Seal with seven seal according to the Book of Revelation amen Amen brother Bram said the way those seals were locked is that the the book in the Old Testament they were not like the book that we have here the book in the Old Testament were Scrolls so the scroll brother Bram say they will write a mystery and when they finish writing a mystery they will roll the mystery everybody okay and when they finish rolling the mystery at the end here they put a seal amen everybody okay then they take the second mystery and they write it down and they take the second mystery everybody following me and they roll it on top of the first mystery and when it finished they seal it up everybody okay and they did it all the way to the seventh mystery everybody okay so the book on the outside is Seal with the last seal which is the seven seal in other word the Bible entirely is locked by one [Applause] seal everybody good that's why in The Book of Revelation when they open the first seal God gave information that it's a white horse right there it is this this this this when they open the second seal God gave an instruction the third but when they open the seven seal if you notice God never give one instruction God just say it is what a silence why because the last mystery doesn't have one specific mystery everybody okay it is the Seal of the seals it is the Seal of the entire seal it is the seal once you open it it begin to open other [Applause] seals everybody okay everybody okay brother Bram says this Oh Glory to God he says if Satan should get a hold of it he might do what that's why God locks it there is one thing he don't know and he can interpret anything he want to he can interpret what is on the front path and impersonate any kind of a gift I hope you learning but he can know what this it is not even written in the word it is a total what secret the angel it is not written in the word doesn't means it's not in the [Applause] Bible it is not written in the word because it was seal in the word not written but seal so you cannot read it and see the seals the seal have to be broken everybody okay we already went through this the angel the angel everything shut up if they have made how one he might give away what something away he will tell who Mary is and the devil will nail her so they just do what shut up virgin shall conceive who's the Virgin we don't know they quit doing what everything did what seven gods what perfect number he didn't say the number of perfection that's three he say God perfect number everybody okay and brother Bram knocks on the pit how many times bum buom buom buom till seven he said just write down the what seven what Thunders adding straight together like they were doing what out something in other word brother Bram say when they were rap when they rap the seven seal the seven seal doesn't open and lock once you open the seventh seal the seventh seal goes and open the Sixth Seal and the six and he goes again and open the other one it is in a check in a sequence like 1 2 3 4 5 until the whole book is out in other word once the sevenant here is open it is the seven seal that continue to open every scripture in the Bible the seventh seal is not limited to the book The Seven seal continue to unfold all the way to Eternity that's why brother Bram say it's like a rocket that open and shoot and open again and shoot and open up in other word the seven seal is what you need to open and our life also our Hidden Mysteries yes sir am everybody okay so you don't need to go left and right once God open the seal of your life everybody good that seal once it's broken it will begin to unfold everything else in your life that God had so when the Holy Ghost come and Quicken the predestin and waken you up everything in that seed from that time on God will continue to open to open to open to open that's why it is one mystery but that mystery will take care of every other Mysteries everybody good everybody clear so far that's why the title is not the Mysteries but the mystery of your life once the seven SE is reaping your life once Mary is already unfolded the remaining of Mary's life is taken care of all that the woman had the well needed is thou the Crist that's it the remaining God will continue to take care of Amen there is a key that block your entire life once that key is unlocked that key doesn't stop in one thing he unlock and he continue to unlock everything in your life until you reach [Applause] eternity everybody okay so far so going back in our Tabernacle where we are still waiting for rof before she departed amen we understand now clearly that to be born again or to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit or to receive eternal life you must be predestinated for now we this stretch it clear let's climb and let me see how far I can climb in act 13 verse 48 the Bible say when the Gentile heard thisuh they were how glad and glorified the word of the what Lord and as many as were how orain to eternal life did what so to receive eternal life you must be ordained for it right everybody good if I if you have a question with my Bible you open your Bible and you verify those that were in question and answer we already handled this so to have eternal life amen to have eternal life you must be how orain father help me in other word if you not ordain you're not going to receive eternal life that's right that's why brother Bram say in non there is nothing to Quicken we all have this right the unbeliever have this GL everybody okay you got a body the unbeliever got a body you got a spirit a human Spirit the unbeliever the drunker that is on the street there he also have a spirit like you he can sometimes speak better English than you and you even speak crooked English so if you try to match up in the body some probably might be more fairer they beautiful than you you won't match them in the spirit they might be more intellectual than you you won't match them they also have a soul that's right we also have a soul so in those perspective there is no difference between you and the child of the devil [Music] [Applause] on everybody okay the only difference between you and anybody is what is in here what is inside here everybody okay some people have it some people don't we clear we clear so to receive eternal life you must be ordained [Applause] the Bible in the book of second Thessalonian speak of the body the soul and the spirit and never mention the seed the seed was unfold by Brother BR that's why when they tried to kill the baby of jeroboam the Bible says you kill everybody from the family of jeroboam you remember we went through that amen you don't bury them you only bury the baby because in the baby there was found something good toward God he was not an adult a baby but when they say something good it is not our good the Rich Young Ruler thought Jesus Christ good Master Jesus say how do you call me good there is no good but who so the good in that baby was God in that [Applause] baby everybody okay that's why that baby could be buried but no body else if you need a scripture for predestinate seed we okay now you okay my friend so to have eternal life you must be ordained for it no ordination no predestination no eternal life in John 15:16 the Bible say ye have not chosen me it is not you that does the choice even when you say I choose this message you never chose the message the message chose [Applause] you everybody okay you never chose the message before you were created the message chose you you just you just acknowledge what God chose for your life is everybody good he said ye have not chosen me but I have what and did what so who ordained people God orain you that you should what and do what for fruit remember Adam need to be fruitful everybody okay you remember that right so to bring forth fruit to go you must be ordained and to bring forth fruit you must be ordained for it am if not you won't bring nothing to go to bring forth fruit or to be fruitful amen and that your fruit should what if you notice fruit is not in plural please help me okay these are different gears and I got to go slowly with them if you look the Bible say bring forth what fruit is not plural sir fruit is singular the opening of The Seven seal fruit is singular they want you to bring forth what fruit fruit one we need to know what fruit are we bringing we don't want to be in the air amen the Bible say you are ordained to bring forth fruit that your one should do what in other word when you bring that fruit that fruit remain he never dies he remain forever amen amen amen when you bring forth a fruit your fruit abide [Music] forever when Mary bring forth her fruit there shall be no end to that fruit Hallelujah tell me which fruit that you can bring and it's abide forever any any remain what fruit apple what what fruit but this fruit Jesus said when you bring that fruit that fruit remain what is a fruit that you can bring and remain because Mary brought a fruit and the fruit of Mary remain brother Bram says this under the anointed one at the end time he said notice but it is what they produce that tell the difference amen by the what fruit Jesus say you shall do What man does not get a grape of a even though the te be right in the grap Vine that could be possible but the fruit will do what what is the the what word word do you see why brother Bram is perfect clean line with the Bible the word the fruit for the what season that is what it is the what teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the what season what time what Jesus now is saying you shall bring forth what and your fruit will do what in other word we are meant orain to produce the [Music] word sir and the word of your time in other words you don't have to push this message you already being wired to bring forth the [Applause] message and not any kind of message the message of the season that's why you are in spoken word bringing forth the message of the [Applause] hour everybody okay everybody okay so your to this church was ordained to bring forth the message are you following me are you following me when you bring forth the message what follows when I when I look at this quot I say in one hour or something I'm done but it's not happening amen what happened he said I have ordained you that you should go and bring forth what fruit singular now we understand amen you bringing forth like Mary amen fruit and that your fruit should do what there is Heaven and Earth sir but my shall water so the fruit you bringing is [Applause] water the word is that which remain can you produce the word and then if you produce the word what follow we Okay we okay and that your fruit should do what that what so what what let's go my friend whatsoever is of your what in what he may what when you produce the message of the hour now you can ask what you [Applause] want everybody okay everybody [Music] okay because you are already in Christ that's right that's right you are in his nameall in the perfect place of worship now that message begin to come off from your life you can ask what you want whatsoever because Mary nothing is impossible Lord Lord help me amen you producing the fruit the word when you produce the word then what ask ask what whatsoever [Music] Hallelujah hallu everybody okay everybody okay so when you ask whatsoever it doesn't impress God because God ordained you to be asking whatsoever only children of God have the audacity to believe impossible [Applause] things because you are meant to believe the impossible when everybody say that say you will hear something in you saying you can make it and everybody will think that you trying to show off I'm not trying to show off I was built that [Applause] way I don't know where I am I'm like in 3% of the sermon my friend everybody okay let's go to receive eternal life orain you ordain to bring fruit once you bring fruit whatsoever you ask in Ephesians 2:10 the Bible say for we are what his work Ur because you are fabricated you are his Masterpiece Adam God made him that's right amen you are we are his M his workmanship come created where in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus you are created for what unto good work stop so God created you for good work you don't manufacture good [Music] work you are also ordained for good work that's why you cannot be mean even if you try like this man treating me bad I'm going to show him after while you feel let me leave him alone you can't help [Applause] it you can't help it I hope I'm freeing [Applause] somebody everybody okay you are created unto good works which who God before did what orain that you should do what in other word god ordained you to Eternal lifee he ordained you to produce food he ordained you for good work and those good work you don't manufacture them you just walk into that's in other word your way of living is not you that's why you behave a certain way it doesn't happen by any chance you were meant to live like [Applause] that do you know what walk in them means when you come to church you just walk in the church do you any effort do you do anything so the good work you walk in them and then you begin to do good work how do you do it I don't know why you so always kind I don't know the Scorpion will continue to bite I am not a scorpion I don't bite I'm a sheep why do you look so dumb because I'm a sheep I don't don't know how to bite I was meant to be sheep not a [Applause] wolf in the word you're eternal life you're producing of God and you doing the work of God everything of that package was taken care of before you were born amen the key to that lays on the predestinated seed right father help me Lord help me brother Bram say you can't think with your body you think with your water mine and in there there is where too many of Christian only stop and they can just like a cornner field and weed in the field they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit holy spirit that the real believer is Anointed with but down on the water inside of that in the water next realm which realm the Third Realm is the water and that is the Water predestinated by God there is where the waterm L where so the Holy Ghost can drop here yeah this man can explain you stuff yeah he can speak in tongue and do many things and do even many Miracle have we not cast our devil have we he can do all of that the difference is what is in the soul if nothing is in the soul brother Bram say that word cannot deny itself then it is how satisfied or it is what what the desire it is the desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your there was a what SE which was what always what in always was where in there all that the father has given me will do what come to there is not any of them that is going to be what [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God Amen brother Bram say for instance when a man gets saved he's just like the light that comes into him is about like the little white what on my shirt little light like this that is when God comes into the what inner part of of a man in the inner part of a what a man a man is made up in the system of what a tabernacle the what your hour cour your body and the what the holy your spirit and the water Hol of Hol the glory on the what ins in the water the [Applause] ve everybody okay everybody good so when you look at this Tabernacle it is you that's right they have a c is your body the holy place is your spirit and the holiest is your soul but in the holiest there must be what there must be what in the Tabernacle what is the seed because the seed we saw that it was the word brother Bram in trying to do God a service with our anywhere he said notice the was [Applause] the that's why in the day of dedication when they were bringing the furniture in the temple God never move you know that right you know what you know that right when they brought everything they put the lamp God never move they put this God never move when they begin to to carry the AR which is the what word then they begin to take the seed the word and take the word inside the holiest when they put the word when they put the seed inside your soul they put the Throne of God so when God is coming in you he doesn't look at this God don't care which nation you are born he's looking for the [Applause] ark when God enter to you he seek the Ark of the Covenant he will pass your spirit he enter your soul once he see the seed of God the seed of God Is Your Mercy Seat God will go in the seed and sit there and you are born [Applause] again everybody okay that's why when two young men were in the church kissing each other God told Brother Bram whatever you say it's going to happen to them The Mercy Seat in brother Bram that's right Rose and say I forgive them am am everybody good everybody clear so far so the word is put in the inside of the holiest that's why the seed is in put in there if you don't have the seed you're not different than the people on the outside everybody okay why do we keep insisting on the seed brother brandham says this brother say when he could draw to his own soul remember last Sunday drawing brother Bram say you draw not somewhere else you drawing where deep inside the well is deep you drawing from your soul from your soul if there is anything in there to draw by but if thou what deated seed don't miss this if thou what deated seed is not in there he will not draw through what because it shall draw for what I hope you catching where I'm taking you I hope you catching where I'm trying to get you I hope you are following me in other word this seed is not placed there by any chance there are things that are locked in that seal and we need to go the Holy Ghost come and break the seal do you follow me he unlock the mystery of your life when the Holy Ghost have you seen those engine when the they have like uh code that they pull like this and the engine go that's what the Holy Ghost come so the Holy Ghost when he get to your predestinate he just came the Holy Ghost leave it then the engine begin to move and produce electricity or whatever he's supposed to do so the Holy Ghost come and look at the seed and he has the key he put the key and unlock the package everybody okay when he unlock the package in there their [Music] staff a seed is not just seed a seed of an apple got Apple inside he got app not for one year for every season so all your season are in the seed yes sir [Applause] H if you have 20 season in your life that seed when it's Quicken it will produce the season when the season finish it get prepared when the time is up whether you have money or no money whether people like it or not when the season AR the seed can't help it it will begin to produce that's why your life goes in sequence yes sir you will see certain here that things go go go and he Pro and after a while he comes back again it's the season of God the speed is producing according to the [Applause] season when the season happen when the season happen obstacle don't matter you will see they decline you something afterward you push a little bit and they approve it because it's the season he have to produce that which he was [Applause] purpose every Apple that can be produced from that tree is in the seed if the fruit if the seed have to produce 2,000 in that little seed there is 2,000 Apple all you need to do is crank the seed and let the seed grow when the tree grows you don't teach Tre de season I don't know if you're getting me when you plant a tree when we take an apple s we go bury the apple and the Apple grow do you come and tell him that apple tree remember it Su who teaches the apple tree The Apple Tree knows the Earth he's talking a language with the Earth he knows what summary is matter of fact he's the one telling you spring is fall is coming [Applause] the tree feels the fall before you you begin to see his LEF begin to change and you who are busy turn around you say hey look at the tree the color begin to change fall is coming he understand fall before you your seed knows your [Applause] time sometime you are too distracted and you will see him begin to give you signal telling you hey pay attention the time is coming summer your summer is coming your summer is coming I have to start bringing [Music] [Applause] fruit everybody okay and at that time you will see Pharaoh begin to multiply the pen because summer is coming summer is coming Pharaoh begin to multiply the P because your Exodus is coming

my time let me try to search the airport and try to land this plan amen amen what is going on what do we need to draw I'm going to stop somewhere here to draw in the seed why amen because we found out according to Roman 8 amen Paul say he that spare not what his own son do you know what I mean we usually sing song we don't understand when we say The Treasure of Heaven crucified do you know what you're saying so the son is the greatest Treasure of Heaven do you understand so God when he look at his son the greatest Treasure of heaven and he look at you come on now yes Lord yes you don't get you need to go to sleep you need to go take a break okay I need to let you go home and take a break so we can come back again and then I can crank the engine because it seems like you somebody's already full when God look at you and he look at Jesus who made the mistake you who supposed to die you that's right God look at Jesus never mistake who can convince me of sin what do you want Satan I have to kill somebody I don't know if you getting me I don't know if you [Applause] please do me a favor when it's Sunday try to sleep on time and when you wake up in the morning try to pray even 20 minutes so you understand which language I'm trying to tell you everybody okay when God look at Jesus he look he look at Jesus he look at you they say what do they want somebody need to die somebody need [Music] and the devil say you see you see you see you see he say I see the devil say look at that one again ah I need him God evaluate he said you know what you going to die on yes sir Hallelujah [Applause] Lord there was a man called Barabas bar his curriculum [Music] V his curriculum V was like this Barabas everything like this like this and they pull Jesus Christ and they look at the record clean like this and they say who should [Music] go and God look he look he look say take Barabas off take this one hang him that's Barabas is going knowing what he did and knowing that the one who's dying there doesn't deserve it so that's what Paul is say who who did not spare his own son he should have SP Jesus didn't do anything Jesus was sitting in heaven doing the will of the father father I always do your will we the one that get out of line all the time but when it was time to knock somebody off God say knock him thank you [Applause] Jesus hallelujah what is in you Oh Glory what is in your [Applause] life what is in your life that require the god of Heaven to die for you what do you carry in you what do you have that God have to devaluate Jesus Christ and evaluate you more yes thank you what do you carry what you car what is so precious about you that God can eliminate Jesus just to keep you God prefer to eliminate Jesus Christ but not to lose you who are you who are you who are you really who do you think you [Applause] are that God could not spare The Treasure of Heaven God is ready to liquidate to remove The Treasure of Heaven because of you thank you Jesus and Paul is saying I'm going to stop here that he that spare not his what own son but did what Del him up for us all how shall he not with him also do what freely give us all things if the greatest Treasure of Heaven God can liquidate you to get you tell me what else God cannot give you Hallelujah Jesus the greatest thing that God can cherish he can give it away what else is greater than Jesus Christ what do you need in your life that is bigger than Jesus Christ because Jesus is Everything Jesus is everything to us the everything God can can dump it on the floor trample like a like a like a rose on the ground God took the everything and trample that on the ground and they spit on him what is difficult that God cannot give you Hallelujah let me stop here you go home and continue to meditate continue to think is there anything too hard for God church I'm trying the best as a Shepherd to get you where God want you to get but if you're taking your personal life and you putting that in front of this word the remaining is between you and God let's stand I could not get to unlocking we will try my best amen amen what else is difficult for God what can you bring before God that he cannot give you because he already gave the best that he has and not only given to you because the Bible says that God so loved the that he gave what only son not two son he only have one option and that one option he releas it not to be respected but to be disrespected until the son himself say father if it's that will please remove this cup he said no no no you know you were born for ites God humiliate Jesus because of you who are you do you realize who you are do you understand what you carry do you understand what value you have in the eyes of God that God brother Bram even put it this way that we worth more than the blood of Jesus Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ is no longer a Jewish blood it's not even a gentle blood it is the blood of God but when God evaluate you he say kill Jesus spare them let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this afternoon afternoon father Lord thanking you so much for your grace for your love for your mercy and
