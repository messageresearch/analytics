[38:02] okay
[38:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[38:04] hallelujah
[38:06] let's go to genesis chapter 15.
[38:11] this origin keep unfolding
[38:15] and i don't know what to do but to
[38:16] follow the holy ghost
[38:18] amen
[38:19] if we finish here then we get in the
[38:21] resurrection then the second death is
[38:24] clear but now we know that those that
[38:27] are in the broad we're not subject to
[38:29] the second death
[38:31] amen so we go and climb back up again
[38:34] into eternity
[38:38] hallelujah
[38:40] genesis chapter 15 verse one
[38:44] i hope we can lay a strong foundation so
[38:47] sunday will be easy
[38:49] after these things
[38:51] the word of the lord came to abram
[38:54] in a vision saying fear not abram
[38:58] i am your shield
[39:00] and your exceeding great reward
[39:04] amen
[39:05] you might be seated
[39:21] god is talking to abraham here
[39:24] verse 2 and abraham say lord god what
[39:28] will you give me
[39:30] seeing i go childless
[39:33] and the steward of my house is this
[39:35] eliezer of damascus
[39:38] in other words abraham is abraham is
[39:40] telling god that i don't have a child
[39:43] but to the way things
[39:46] are portraying i believe the air of my
[39:49] house is going to be a liaison of
[39:51] damascus
[39:52] so he was using his brain
[39:56] amen
[39:56] trying to pinpoint who is going to be
[39:58] the heir of everything
[40:00] in other words god i don't have a child
[40:03] all i can see is this man here he's a
[40:05] good man honorable man in my house so
[40:08] probably he might end up being the heir
[40:10] amen
[40:12] verse 3 and abram said behold to me you
[40:15] have not give you have given no seed
[40:19] and no one born in my house is my heir
[40:23] eliezer of damascus
[40:26] who told you that abraham
[40:28] verse 4
[40:30] and behold the word of the lord came to
[40:32] him saying
[40:33] okay now it's not abraham talking
[40:36] we like that
[40:39] this shall not be your heir
[40:42] that's not it
[40:44] but he that shall come forth out of your
[40:47] own bowels
[40:49] shall be your
[40:50] heir
[40:51] so we know where isaac was
[40:54] right
[40:55] okay
[40:56] verse 5 and he brought him
[40:59] forth abroad
[41:00] and say
[41:02] look now toward what
[41:05] abraham was looking
[41:08] about the things that were on the earth
[41:11] when he looked on the earth he saw
[41:13] eleazar he didn't understand that as a
[41:16] seed was already in him
[41:18] amen so god started and tell him that
[41:21] within yourself there is a seed
[41:24] on the earth
[41:25] within abraham remember liver was there
[41:28] also he paid tithe unto melchizedek
[41:32] in the earth you have isaac
[41:34] laying there as a seed
[41:37] in your lungs everybody clear
[41:40] but god is bringing abraham back up
[41:44] into heaven
[41:46] amen
[41:47] in other words the story really abraham
[41:50] doesn't start on the earth
[41:52] if you want to understand the real story
[41:55] you need to go back up there
[41:57] that's where the origins start
[42:00] amen
[42:01] [Laughter]
[42:03] hallelujah and he brought him fourth out
[42:07] look now toward heaven come on
[42:09] and tell the stars do you remember
[42:13] you remember the stars of god
[42:15] you remember them and the great and
[42:17] morning star so he's bringing abraham
[42:20] back to the star
[42:21] he said let's go up there abraham
[42:24] amen
[42:25] if you want to know your true descent
[42:28] go back up there don't be looking at
[42:30] circumstances here
[42:32] amen tell the stars
[42:35] if you be able to number them
[42:38] and he said to him so shall your
[42:44] let me go back here ben
[42:47] look now toward the heavens everybody
[42:49] sees that you need your bible come on
[42:52] and tell though
[42:54] how many stars
[42:56] plural everybody clear
[42:59] so the stars are plural amen
[43:02] stars are plural
[43:04] so if god says your seed shall be like
[43:08] that if stars are plural so seed need to
[43:11] be plural
[43:13] but let's see if seed is plural
[43:20] amen and tell the stars if you'll be
[43:23] able to number them many stars and he
[43:26] said to him so shall you're
[43:31] singular
[43:34] you look in many stars
[43:36] but all the stars are packed into
[43:40] one seed
[43:43] you remember that
[43:45] you remember that
[43:46] so all these stars that are plural are
[43:49] truly
[43:50] represented in a one seed
[43:54] singular seed
[44:00] this is the way you read your bible
[44:02] amen
[44:04] and all these stars are numbered in one
[44:07] seed and he said to him so shall your
[44:10] seed
[44:11] be we know who is that singular seed
[44:15] right
[44:16] you know that already who is it
[44:26] so if you look here
[44:29] god is talking about isaac
[44:31] amen
[44:33] abraham you're going to have a child
[44:36] that child is going to come out of your
[44:37] bowel everybody knows it's isaac god
[44:40] take him from here
[44:42] all the way to the heaven
[44:44] and god show him
[44:52] you see who he saw
[44:53] so paul when he said seed singular means
[44:57] christ
[44:58] paul knew what he was talking about
[45:01] amen
[45:02] so on the earth it seems like it's isaac
[45:05] but surely it is
[45:10] let's go to matthew chapter 18
[45:13] hallelujah
[45:16] matthew chapter 18.
[45:20] so the earth isaac the heaven crushed
[45:24] amen
[45:25] and these children are stars
[45:29] we know lucifer want to rise himself
[45:31] above the
[45:32] stars
[45:34] of god amen
[45:37] praise god
[45:39] matthew chapter 18 verse 5
[45:43] if you dare you can say amen
[45:46] and who so shall receive
[45:49] one
[45:50] such a leader chad in my name
[45:53] receive me
[45:55] that child must be in his
[45:58] name you got
[46:01] amen
[46:02] verse six
[46:03] and who so shall offend one of these
[46:06] little ones
[46:09] not only just little ones watch
[46:12] leave the one which what
[46:15] makes sense clear when i say make sense
[46:18] i'm not calling your brain
[46:20] i'm calling your heart because brother
[46:22] branham said we understand with the
[46:23] heart sometimes when we say make sense
[46:26] people think we're talking about the
[46:27] brain none
[46:28] but clear in other words is it clear
[46:31] amen but whoso shall offend one of these
[46:34] little ones
[46:35] which believe in me so that little ones
[46:38] believe in him
[46:39] amen
[46:40] he wear better for him that a milestone
[46:43] were hanged about his neck and that he
[46:46] were joined in the depths of the sea
[46:48] everybody cleared so far
[46:50] job two verse 10
[46:51] take heed that you despise not one of
[46:54] these little ones we understand them now
[46:57] for i say unto you
[46:59] that in
[47:02] not here
[47:04] in what
[47:08] in heaven
[47:10] there
[47:13] so when you look at a human being
[47:17] when you look at a human on earth
[47:21] on earth you're gonna see him as a human
[47:24] but in heaven
[47:26] there is someone called
[47:28] his angel oh hair
[47:30] angel
[47:34] anybody clear
[47:37] are you clear
[47:39] that in heaven
[47:40] they're angels because there are many
[47:43] do always behold the face of my father
[47:48] which is in
[47:49] heaven we know who that angel is right
[47:53] one more then we're gonna pray let's go
[47:55] to act chapter 12.
[48:00] on the earth
[48:01] look like isaac
[48:04] if you go through isaac
[48:05] the descendant of isaac persecuted
[48:07] christ
[48:09] so who was the true seed
[48:12] amen but in heaven christ
[48:15] on the earth human
[48:17] in a in heaven they are peace species
[48:21] beings called angels
[48:23] amen
[48:25] acts chapter 12 verse 11
[48:28] and when peter was come to himself
[48:32] the angel of the lord delivered him from
[48:33] prison he said
[48:35] now i know of surety that the lord has
[48:38] sent his angel
[48:40] and has delivered me out of the hand of
[48:42] herod and from all the expectation of
[48:45] the people of the jews they want to get
[48:47] him killed
[48:49] and when he had considered the thing he
[48:51] came to the house of mary the mother of
[48:54] john whose surname was mark
[48:57] where many were gathered together
[48:59] praying
[49:01] and as peter knocked at the door at the
[49:03] gate of the gate
[49:05] a damsel came to hurricane
[49:08] named rhoda
[49:09] and when she knew peter's voice
[49:12] she opened not the gate for gladness
[49:14] even forget about it
[49:16] but ran in and told her peter stood
[49:20] before the gate
[49:22] and they said to her
[49:24] you are mad you are insane
[49:27] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[49:30] even so
[49:31] so then say day it is his
[49:37] in other words peter is already dead
[49:41] so what you see it's the angel of peter
[49:45] that looked like peter and sounds like
[49:47] peter
[49:50] hey but here
[49:51] so peter
[49:53] here
[49:55] in heaven there is an angel
[49:57] that looked like peter
[49:59] acted like peter
[50:01] sound even like peter
[50:04] until you look at that angel you thought
[50:06] this is peter
[50:10] everybody here
[50:11] let's pray
[50:13] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[50:16] for your grace your love your mercy
[50:18] father and for everything you have been
[50:20] doing for us
[50:21] father thank you for giving us another
[50:24] opportunity to gather together
[50:26] around the revealed world of the hour
[50:29] lord i have done what every man that you
[50:32] have given a grace and an ability to do
[50:34] can do but when it comes to interpret
[50:38] and to preach to speak to teach your
[50:40] children it only takes the holy spirit
[50:44] father that's why i'm humbling myself
[50:46] expressing lord father that we all
[50:49] depend from thee and i'm asking that you
[50:51] move me completely out of the way may
[50:54] you come and minister to your children
[50:56] may you be the alpha and the omega of
[50:58] this service as we committed all in the
[51:01] name of jesus christ
[51:03] amen
[51:05] god bless you if you would turn with me
[51:08] straight to genesis chapter 25 and keep
[51:11] your bibles there
[51:16] genesis chapter 25
[51:20] and when you're there you can keep your
[51:21] bible right there because we will come
[51:24] back to that scripture
[51:27] as we will be clamping
[51:30] genesis chapter 25 you there you can say
[51:33] amen then we go
[51:35] we are dealing again with the origin
[51:38] part eight
[51:42] second feast of king uh the second
[51:44] banquet of
[51:46] esther everybody clear
[51:48] on when on sunday we demonstrated to you
[51:52] that the other part there is two kingdom
[51:55] one kingdom is the kingdom of god and
[51:58] the other kingdom is the kingdom of the
[52:00] devil we know by gene there is no
[52:02] connection between the kingdom of the
[52:04] devil and the kingdom of god and the
[52:07] kingdom of god everybody there is
[52:09] eternal as god himself is eternal in the
[52:13] kingdom of the devil brother branham say
[52:15] the devil is not eternal amen
[52:18] he has a beginning and therefore he's
[52:20] going to have an end therefore then we
[52:23] will talk about the lake of fire which
[52:25] is the second death so on the right side
[52:28] it is eternal beings coming from the
[52:30] laws of god and on the left side it is a
[52:33] temporal being coming from the creation
[52:37] of god at the in the beginning everybody
[52:40] clear
[52:41] brother branham said that after he has
[52:44] provided a way for people
[52:46] and then they refuse it now the reason
[52:49] they refuse it is because there is
[52:51] nothing in there to receive it
[52:54] amen
[52:56] so some people will receive the gospel
[52:58] we already demonstrated that to you and
[53:00] some will not receive the gospel amen
[53:03] and the reason why they receive the
[53:05] gospel look at their origin and if they
[53:07] don't receive it look at the origin amen
[53:10] brother branham said the reason they
[53:12] refuse it is because there is nothing in
[53:15] there to receive it there is no
[53:17] absorbent there is no receiver to
[53:20] receive the word there is nothing to
[53:23] receive it
[53:24] my mother used to say you cannot get
[53:27] blood from a turnip
[53:29] because they turn up have no blood
[53:31] because there is no blood in a turnip so
[53:34] if there is no form of life
[53:37] in there which is the predestinated seed
[53:40] to receive it then it cannot be received
[53:44] that is the reason the pharisee could
[53:46] look right in the face of jesus and call
[53:50] him beelzebub
[53:52] because there was nothing in them to
[53:54] receive him
[53:56] but
[53:57] all the father have given me he said
[54:00] will come to me there is some way it's
[54:03] going to be presented
[54:05] you can talk to people sometime on the
[54:08] street
[54:09] talk to them about the lord
[54:11] they laugh right in your face
[54:13] well we are supposed to do that anyway
[54:16] in other words whether they receive the
[54:18] gospel or not it is our responsibility
[54:21] to preach the gospel everybody clear for
[54:23] one it's going to be salvation and for
[54:26] the other one it's going to be for
[54:27] judgment
[54:28] but clear there is no one can come to me
[54:32] except my father chose him first
[54:35] god has to do the drawing
[54:38] there has to be a life
[54:40] and all that he has given me will come
[54:43] on to me aren't you glad tonight that
[54:45] you have that paul
[54:47] that tag that we spoke about on sunday
[54:50] where you can feel god attracting you
[54:53] and something in you responding to god
[54:56] regardless of where you come from what
[54:59] your mind is thinking what mama was what
[55:02] daddy was no matter what kind of family
[55:04] you came out of there that have nothing
[55:07] to do with you because brother branham
[55:09] said i brag more on my second birth
[55:13] than my first birth because the second
[55:15] birth tells you exactly where you came
[55:18] from
[55:19] everybody clear so far
[55:21] brother branham said but let me try to
[55:23] justify that tonight
[55:25] the bible says the footsteps of the
[55:27] righteous
[55:28] are ordered of the lord
[55:31] sometimes
[55:32] he makes us do things very contrary to
[55:35] what we think
[55:37] that's why we don't lean on our own
[55:39] understanding but we are always
[55:42] if we are following the leading of the
[55:44] spirit we are always in his will because
[55:48] it's the spirit of god leading you
[55:50] god does what he wants to
[55:53] he raised pharaoh up for the same
[55:56] purpose
[55:57] and called say he loved jacob and he
[55:59] hated esau before they was even born
[56:03] ever born now god's purpose must be
[56:06] fulfilled
[56:07] can the powder he didn't finish
[56:10] the clay said to the porter as we found
[56:12] in romans 8 9
[56:14] and paul said in ii timothy chapter 2
[56:17] verse 13 if we believe not
[56:23] yet
[56:24] he a bad faithful
[56:27] so he has nothing to do with you even
[56:30] when you are faithless
[56:33] even when you are down
[56:35] god is determined he will not lose none
[56:39] of his children
[56:41] god will do everything that he can and
[56:44] make sure the predestinated seed are
[56:47] saved
[56:48] everybody clear even if we believe not
[56:51] yet he a bad faithful he cannot deny
[56:54] himself
[56:55] if you're a child of god god will never
[56:59] deny you if he denies you he denies
[57:02] himself and god cannot reject his own
[57:05] because we are as eternal as god is
[57:08] eternal
[57:10] everybody clear so far we're depending
[57:12] on him not on our own
[57:15] when we spoke and we entered the book of
[57:17] jude we found out that when israel came
[57:20] out of egypt
[57:21] god saved
[57:23] some of them
[57:24] and then destroy a part of it amen then
[57:27] on first six because we already
[57:29] explained that one on first six
[57:32] po uh jude says this
[57:35] that the angel
[57:36] which kept not the first estate
[57:40] in verse 5
[57:42] jude was talking about israel
[57:45] naturally speaking
[57:47] jude said if you look at the story of
[57:49] israel israel came out of egypt when
[57:53] israel came out of egypt there was a
[57:55] group that was saved and another group
[57:58] was destroyed everybody clear
[58:00] but now jude continued on verse six
[58:04] he leave the earth
[58:07] you okay now then jude goes back up
[58:10] again into heaven
[58:12] everybody clear into the realm of the
[58:15] angel
[58:16] everybody clear so far
[58:20] when brother branham preached this uh
[58:22] the seven church ages
[58:24] brother branham showed to us what
[58:26] happened in the natural hymn
[58:28] what branham said there was a message
[58:30] that came by the name of luther by the
[58:32] name of wesley by the name of columba
[58:35] and brother branham give you the plan
[58:36] outlet uh the plan layout of the seven
[58:40] church ages what happened in them which
[58:42] city was there and everything together
[58:44] amen and people were behaving a certain
[58:47] way throughout the seven church ages but
[58:51] when the sales broke
[58:53] and back here the seals now shows you
[58:56] the same information but in a different
[59:00] level
[59:02] everybody here the churches show you
[59:04] what happened naturally
[59:07] in the natural realm in a political
[59:10] realm and you just see somebody moving
[59:13] from point a to z
[59:14] but they still show you the spirit
[59:17] behind it the anointing behind it what
[59:21] is actually causing the natural to move
[59:24] a certain way
[59:26] about here and to understand the natural
[59:29] you need to go back to the spiritual
[59:31] first
[59:32] because there is a reason why somebody
[59:35] is behaving one way and somebody else is
[59:38] behaving another way when they are faced
[59:40] with the same thing
[59:43] but here when people face eternal life
[59:46] some people respond a certain way and
[59:49] some other people respond a different
[59:51] way based on what happened up there
[59:56] everybody here so in the 5 jude was
[1:00:00] talking about the earthly
[1:00:02] then on verse 7 of 6 jude moved from the
[1:00:05] earthly he begin to go back up like okay
[1:00:08] let's go back up there and see what
[1:00:10] really happened over there we see israel
[1:00:13] some destroy some saved why are they
[1:00:16] destroyed why saved which point to you
[1:00:19] we showed to you paul said
[1:00:21] it was because of a lack of faith
[1:00:24] amen because there were children in whom
[1:00:26] there was no faith remember deuteronomy
[1:00:28] now jude said let's leave the earth
[1:00:31] let's go back up there let's see what
[1:00:34] happened over there everybody here
[1:00:36] jude says that the angel which kept not
[1:00:40] their first estate
[1:00:42] everybody
[1:00:43] they had a position just like lucifer
[1:00:46] had a throne but for some reason this
[1:00:49] angel could not continue all the way
[1:00:54] remember brother branham said the proof
[1:00:56] that you are baptized with the holy
[1:00:58] spirit you must stay in the world all
[1:01:02] the way
[1:01:03] not like judah who started and then
[1:01:06] drifted down the road if you study if
[1:01:09] you're an alpha you must be an omega
[1:01:12] you cannot be alpha and shop in the
[1:01:15] middle of the road it shows where you
[1:01:17] come from
[1:01:21] he said the angels
[1:01:23] which kept not their first estate they
[1:01:26] had a position
[1:01:27] but left their own habitation you
[1:01:30] remember on sunday
[1:01:31] judah left his own habitation
[1:01:34] and left their own habitation
[1:01:36] he reserved in everlasting chance in
[1:01:39] other words he put them in prison
[1:01:42] souls in prison
[1:01:44] under darkness
[1:01:46] unto the judgment of the great day we
[1:01:48] already know that that judgment which is
[1:01:50] the judgment of the white great uh the
[1:01:53] white throne everybody clear
[1:01:56] now brother branham interpret this
[1:01:57] scripture he says
[1:01:59] angels which one stay in heaven
[1:02:04] remember ebiado
[1:02:06] he stay with david but because of his
[1:02:09] lineage he have to leave david
[1:02:11] to fulfill the prophecy that was given
[1:02:14] to the house of healer
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] he said the angel which was spain heaven
[1:02:20] they were working for god
[1:02:23] and kept not their estate
[1:02:26] why why somebody kept and the other one
[1:02:28] could not
[1:02:29] and the way that they were in
[1:02:32] fell away
[1:02:34] and now
[1:02:35] is in eternal change of darkness
[1:02:38] everlasting chance of darkness
[1:02:41] kept in this condition in prison until
[1:02:44] the judgment of the great day
[1:02:47] when they shall be judged with the rest
[1:02:50] of the unbelievers
[1:02:52] so this angel brother branham connect
[1:02:54] them with the unbelievers
[1:02:58] anybody clear
[1:03:00] what's going on brother branham
[1:03:02] we told you that there is two kingdoms
[1:03:05] the kingdom of god eternal and the
[1:03:07] kingdom of
[1:03:09] of the devil which is temporal now jude
[1:03:13] according to verse 6 he says that the
[1:03:16] same thing that happened in the natural
[1:03:19] with israel that some people were saved
[1:03:22] another were destroyed he says the same
[1:03:26] thing happened also in the angelic
[1:03:29] realms
[1:03:33] in other words election
[1:03:36] happened on the angelic realms first
[1:03:44] hallelujah
[1:03:46] revelation chapter 12 the bible says
[1:03:49] there was war in heaven
[1:03:52] if everybody that was in heaven was a
[1:03:54] child of god
[1:03:55] why did we have war
[1:04:00] god was fighting god
[1:04:03] there were two kingdoms anybody clear so
[1:04:05] if it's war
[1:04:06] somebody is for god and somebody is
[1:04:09] against god
[1:04:10] about clear
[1:04:12] now but the bible says there was war in
[1:04:14] heaven
[1:04:16] michael and his angel
[1:04:18] so there were a group of angels
[1:04:21] that cling to michael and brother
[1:04:23] branham said my care was christ
[1:04:28] we clear
[1:04:29] micah and his angel fought
[1:04:33] against the dragon
[1:04:35] and the dragon fought
[1:04:37] and his angels
[1:04:39] so right here we can see that they are
[1:04:42] group of angels
[1:04:44] we talking about engines
[1:04:46] they are a group of angels that are
[1:04:49] connected to michael
[1:04:52] everybody and there is a group of angels
[1:04:56] that are connected to lucifer
[1:05:02] not only do we have children of the
[1:05:05] devil we also have angelic beings that
[1:05:09] belongs to the devil
[1:05:14] hallelujah
[1:05:15] and prevail not
[1:05:17] neither was there
[1:05:21] so they had a place in heaven
[1:05:23] they had an estate in heaven they had
[1:05:26] their habitation in heaven they had a
[1:05:28] position in heaven but the problem is
[1:05:32] they could not keep that
[1:05:35] anybody clear they can start with the
[1:05:38] message but they're not going to hold on
[1:05:41] all the way to the end
[1:05:46] everybody here
[1:05:48] neither was their place found
[1:05:50] they had a place but they lost it
[1:05:53] judah had a ministry remember but he
[1:05:56] lost the holy ghost giving ministry to
[1:06:00] go into his own place
[1:06:04] why did judah lost and the other never
[1:06:07] lost it
[1:06:08] father those that you gave me i lost
[1:06:11] none of them except the son of
[1:06:16] anybody clear
[1:06:17] neither was the place found anymore in
[1:06:24] and the great dragon
[1:06:26] was cast out
[1:06:28] that old
[1:06:30] not a new serpent
[1:06:32] the new serpent is the one that ramp
[1:06:35] the old one was a beast
[1:06:39] so the beast was the
[1:06:43] the old serpent called her
[1:06:46] the devil we know therefore what he
[1:06:48] means already and satan amen
[1:06:51] accuser and opposition
[1:06:53] amen which deceived the whole world he
[1:06:57] was cast out into the
[1:07:00] and his angels were cast out with him
[1:07:03] that's why brother branham said in the
[1:07:05] battle uh the greatest brother ever
[1:07:07] thought he said the battle the first
[1:07:10] fight who started over there then the
[1:07:12] battle from angel drop down and become
[1:07:16] human battles
[1:07:17] so before it becomes human battle he
[1:07:21] must start first over there
[1:07:26] where are you taking me so we can see
[1:07:28] here that we have two kingdoms
[1:07:31] michael has his angels
[1:07:33] and lucifer has his angel in other words
[1:07:36] election also is applied in the angelic
[1:07:40] realms
[1:07:43] first timothy chapter 5 verse 21
[1:07:47] paul says i charge thee before god
[1:07:50] and the lord jesus christ and the water
[1:07:56] why did paul say the elect angels
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:01] so even in the angelic realm there are
[1:08:04] angels that are elected
[1:08:07] and there are some that are not elected
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:13] we clear
[1:08:15] blessed be the name of the lord that
[1:08:17] that observe these things
[1:08:19] without preferring one before another
[1:08:22] doing nothing by personality what i'm
[1:08:25] trying to drive here is the election
[1:08:27] that you see in the natural started back
[1:08:30] up there
[1:08:33] we're clear
[1:08:34] now the bible says this in matthew 25
[1:08:39] he said then shall he say also to them
[1:08:42] on the left
[1:08:44] you know who's on the right
[1:08:45] you already know who's on the left
[1:08:47] okay
[1:08:48] then shall he say to them that on the
[1:08:50] left
[1:08:51] those that are as goats
[1:08:54] depart from me ye
[1:08:56] curse
[1:08:57] into everlasting
[1:09:00] prepare for the sinners
[1:09:05] prepare for the devil and water
[1:09:11] my question comes
[1:09:14] this fire everlasting
[1:09:16] which brother branham explained to us
[1:09:18] that it's hell anybody clear
[1:09:21] he was prepared
[1:09:23] or predestinated for who
[1:09:26] for the devil
[1:09:28] and who
[1:09:29] his angels
[1:09:31] anybody clear
[1:09:33] but the bible says that those on the
[1:09:36] left
[1:09:38] those on the left are human beings
[1:09:42] you remember
[1:09:44] you remember
[1:09:45] if
[1:09:46] hell was prepared for the devil
[1:09:50] and his angel
[1:09:52] why is our human being
[1:09:55] entering hell
[1:10:00] we clear
[1:10:01] my question is the bible says that
[1:10:04] everlasting fire
[1:10:06] was prepared for the devil and his angel
[1:10:10] he didn't say human
[1:10:11] why you men
[1:10:13] are going to hell
[1:10:16] that's my question
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:20] technically speaking you should have
[1:10:22] only the devil and his angel period
[1:10:25] why do we have human
[1:10:26] going to hell
[1:10:28] anybody clear brother branham said in
[1:10:31] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:10:35] brother branham say as usual when one
[1:10:38] regards a verse superficially
[1:10:41] he comes with a superficial
[1:10:45] understanding everybody clear
[1:10:47] now buckle up as we're going take roman
[1:10:49] chapter 9.
[1:10:55] sorry we're going to come back to
[1:10:56] genesis sooner
[1:11:00] we are not in human realms we are in
[1:11:02] angelic realms
[1:11:05] take roman chapter 9
[1:11:08] very familiar scripture
[1:11:10] if you're there you can say amen
[1:11:13] our origin
[1:11:17] paul says this
[1:11:20] i say the truth verse 9 in christ
[1:11:23] i lie not paul is saying the truth
[1:11:26] my conscience also bearing me witness in
[1:11:30] the holy ghost
[1:11:31] are we clear
[1:11:33] are you still looking for it
[1:11:35] are you there
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:37] that i have great heaviness
[1:11:40] and continuous sorrow in my heart
[1:11:43] paul why are you sorry
[1:11:45] what's going on
[1:11:47] verse 3
[1:11:48] for i could wish that myself
[1:11:51] were a curse
[1:11:53] you can see a true pastor of the age
[1:11:56] like moses before you destroy israel
[1:11:59] destroy me i rather me being cursed let
[1:12:02] the other pass
[1:12:04] true heart
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:08] a true father
[1:12:10] i wish that myself were a curse from
[1:12:12] christ
[1:12:13] for my brethren
[1:12:14] my kinsmen according to the water
[1:12:18] paul here is relating to israel natural
[1:12:23] we okay
[1:12:24] paulie starting roman 9 but in roman 9
[1:12:28] paul is talking about the natural
[1:12:30] israelite the jew
[1:12:32] the man
[1:12:34] oh we know already that paul told us
[1:12:37] that not all israel is israel
[1:12:41] not everybody that is jew is a child of
[1:12:43] god
[1:12:44] so paul is studying that i am a jew from
[1:12:47] the chapel from the tribe of benjamin
[1:12:50] and i have great sorrow
[1:12:53] for my people which people the jews
[1:12:58] on the flesh verse 4
[1:13:00] who are israelite do you see gentiles
[1:13:03] there
[1:13:04] no
[1:13:05] to whom pretend the adoption
[1:13:10] and the glory
[1:13:11] and the covenant
[1:13:13] and the giving of the law
[1:13:15] and the service of god and the
[1:13:18] promises
[1:13:20] anybody clear
[1:13:21] all of this
[1:13:23] did not belong to you
[1:13:25] naturally speaking
[1:13:28] it belongs to israel
[1:13:33] whose
[1:13:34] are the fathers
[1:13:36] and of whom as concerning the flesh paul
[1:13:39] is talking about the natural man
[1:13:42] as concerning the flesh crust came
[1:13:45] who is overall god bless forever if you
[1:13:49] have a problem with deity jesus is god
[1:13:52] right there
[1:13:54] is god bless forever
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] amen
[1:13:59] now paul goes
[1:14:01] not as though the word of god has taken
[1:14:04] non-effect
[1:14:06] paul is saying all the promises all the
[1:14:09] glory all the law all the services of
[1:14:12] god were first given to the jew
[1:14:15] and it seems like israel fell
[1:14:18] and when they fail you might have
[1:14:22] an idea
[1:14:23] like
[1:14:24] god words fail
[1:14:26] paul said that's not the case
[1:14:29] it looks like god fell
[1:14:31] he says no
[1:14:32] he said for they are not are israel
[1:14:37] which are of israel now paul begin to
[1:14:40] move from the natural
[1:14:42] you see now paul begin to go in a
[1:14:45] different realm of israel
[1:14:48] at the beginning it was the country of
[1:14:50] israel it was the people that were born
[1:14:53] from the laws of abraham now paul begin
[1:14:56] to make a distinction like even though
[1:14:59] they are born from abraham not all of
[1:15:02] them are truly israel so now we see
[1:15:06] there is to israel
[1:15:08] there is a natural israel and there is
[1:15:10] now a spiritual israel paul now begins
[1:15:14] to take you from the earth he's going
[1:15:16] back up with you
[1:15:18] everybody clear
[1:15:20] verse seven
[1:15:21] neither because they are water
[1:15:24] the seed of who
[1:15:26] the descendant of abraham the offering
[1:15:29] of abraham are there or
[1:15:34] in other words if someone is born as a
[1:15:38] jew
[1:15:39] paul says it doesn't mean they are a
[1:15:42] child of god
[1:15:44] because at the beginning israel were the
[1:15:47] people of god
[1:15:48] when we look at the jew they are the
[1:15:50] people of god paul said that is not the
[1:15:53] case
[1:15:54] ever here
[1:15:56] even though the promises were given to
[1:15:58] them yet there is an election
[1:16:04] the problem is election
[1:16:08] where is your origin
[1:16:10] you can be born a jew but you are not a
[1:16:14] child of god
[1:16:15] and we might be gentle
[1:16:17] yet we are more jews than the jew
[1:16:20] themself
[1:16:24] the jew is the one in ward
[1:16:28] that's what paul said
[1:16:29] he says circumcision is not of the flesh
[1:16:33] but of the water
[1:16:34] that's why malachi 4 came to turn there
[1:16:44] are we okay
[1:16:46] verse 7 neither because they are seed of
[1:16:49] abraham or they are children
[1:16:52] but this is the problem
[1:16:55] in who
[1:16:56] shall your
[1:16:58] singular
[1:16:59] remember here
[1:17:01] remember that seed
[1:17:02] when they say isaac we have a tendency
[1:17:04] to look at the jew
[1:17:05] paul is pulling you back again i'm not
[1:17:08] talking about this i'm talking about
[1:17:10] this one
[1:17:12] you did
[1:17:13] isaac shall your seed be called
[1:17:18] the seed
[1:17:19] will be called
[1:17:23] let's continue verse eight
[1:17:25] that is
[1:17:27] paul is explaining himself
[1:17:29] they
[1:17:30] which are the children of the flesh
[1:17:35] what have what you call the jews today
[1:17:38] with the idea of a jew with a blood of a
[1:17:41] jew
[1:17:42] those they which are the children of the
[1:17:45] flesh these are not the children of god
[1:17:50] but
[1:17:51] the children of the water
[1:17:53] the promise are content for water
[1:17:57] so the child of the true child of god is
[1:18:01] a child of promise
[1:18:07] a true child of god
[1:18:09] is a child of promise which promise
[1:18:16] which promise
[1:18:18] abraham you're going to have a child is
[1:18:20] that a promise
[1:18:22] if that is the case we need to go back
[1:18:24] to israel
[1:18:25] and be converted to judaism
[1:18:28] and barclay
[1:18:29] what does it mean
[1:18:31] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:18:33] branham says this in israel in the
[1:18:35] church
[1:18:36] the children of the promise
[1:18:40] promise what
[1:18:43] what kind of a promise
[1:18:46] i love the message
[1:18:48] that god promised before the water
[1:18:54] brother branham said that promise
[1:18:56] is not something that started here
[1:19:00] it is something that starts way up there
[1:19:04] because the lamb was slain before
[1:19:08] the foundation of the world
[1:19:13] anybody here
[1:19:15] he told them that is the water
[1:19:18] so the seed started before the
[1:19:20] natural not because you quit doing this
[1:19:24] and quit doing that and quit lying and
[1:19:27] quit selling that is just moral act
[1:19:31] a good citizen will do that
[1:19:34] you can't call yourself a christian yet
[1:19:37] until
[1:19:38] something in here
[1:19:40] has happened
[1:19:42] until you are regenerated
[1:19:46] until you lose your natural breath
[1:19:51] anybody clear
[1:19:53] something that is happening in here
[1:19:57] so the promise here brother branham is
[1:19:59] connecting that before the foundation of
[1:20:02] the world and brother branham said that
[1:20:03] promise is the what is the seed and the
[1:20:06] seed is who
[1:20:09] romans 4 verse 16
[1:20:12] the bible said therefore it is of what
[1:20:15] faith
[1:20:16] that it might be by
[1:20:18] by grace to the end duh
[1:20:22] you see the promise
[1:20:24] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:20:27] all the seed
[1:20:29] because god knew that his children are
[1:20:33] scattered
[1:20:36] some of them discarded them in america
[1:20:40] some of them he scattered them in europe
[1:20:42] some are scattered in africa some are
[1:20:45] scattered among the jews amen
[1:20:48] and if god would corner his promise to
[1:20:51] the nation of israel only
[1:20:54] those that were not born jews were
[1:20:56] locked
[1:21:00] so god took that promise and put it in
[1:21:03] christ
[1:21:05] and jesus was neither a jew
[1:21:13] who was the father of jesus
[1:21:16] which blood was in the vein of jesus
[1:21:19] which dna
[1:21:22] he was a created cell
[1:21:25] which blood was it jesus was not a jew
[1:21:28] jesus was not a gentile
[1:21:31] he just chose to look like a jew
[1:21:35] but his blood was the blood of god
[1:21:38] almighty himself
[1:21:41] so the promise was not placed on a jew
[1:21:44] the promise was not placed on the gender
[1:21:47] the promise was placed in christ
[1:21:50] so that all the children whether they
[1:21:53] are jew or gender god can recuperate
[1:21:58] them
[1:21:59] god can redeem them back to him
[1:22:02] those are the true children of god
[1:22:06] blessed be the name of the lord that's
[1:22:08] the promise might be sure to all the
[1:22:11] seed
[1:22:12] not to own not to that only which is of
[1:22:15] the law the jew
[1:22:17] but to that also which is of the
[1:22:21] of abraham the gentile who is the father
[1:22:24] of who
[1:22:25] did can you trust abraham and see him on
[1:22:28] your genealogy
[1:22:31] you won't see it
[1:22:33] abraham was a pugil how is abraham your
[1:22:36] father
[1:22:37] abraham is your father
[1:22:39] by the faith
[1:22:42] america
[1:22:44] brother branham in in galatians chapter
[1:22:47] 3 the bible say for ye are all the
[1:22:50] children of god by what
[1:22:53] by faith in who
[1:22:55] for as many of you as have been baptized
[1:22:59] into who
[1:23:01] the seed
[1:23:02] have put on who
[1:23:05] there is neither
[1:23:08] it's dissolved
[1:23:10] no
[1:23:11] dissolve there is neither
[1:23:14] dissolve nor
[1:23:16] there is neither
[1:23:17] no
[1:23:18] deserve for year or
[1:23:21] in who in christ jesus
[1:23:26] watch now and if he be christ
[1:23:30] in other words if you belong to christ
[1:23:34] if christ is your lord
[1:23:36] your honor ownership if ye be christ
[1:23:40] then you are abraham's seed
[1:23:43] and hair according to the water so that
[1:23:46] promises in christ
[1:23:51] brother branham says this
[1:23:53] then he goes on to not only narrow down
[1:23:55] this his definition but rather to
[1:23:58] finalize it for in galatian 3
[1:24:01] he identified the seed singular with who
[1:24:06] encountered the seed children
[1:24:09] as the children of the
[1:24:12] of promise and promise as having to do
[1:24:15] with what
[1:24:16] with the election or the choosing of
[1:24:19] what
[1:24:19] so that promise means election
[1:24:23] and chosen by god before the foundation
[1:24:27] of the world
[1:24:29] it has nothing to do with your birth
[1:24:33] it is what started there
[1:24:35] anybody clear
[1:24:37] brother branham say
[1:24:39] that is exactly what we have been saying
[1:24:42] these who are of the royal seed are the
[1:24:45] elects of god
[1:24:47] are the predestinated
[1:24:49] for known of god and where in the mind
[1:24:52] of god and in his thoughts
[1:24:55] in very plain language the true bread of
[1:24:59] grass was in the mind of god eternally
[1:25:04] do not express until each came forth in
[1:25:08] the designated decree or season
[1:25:14] where are we taking us amen
[1:25:16] let's go to genesis 26
[1:25:21] yep we good
[1:25:25] the seed
[1:25:26] paul says it's no more natural
[1:25:29] let's go back to the
[1:25:31] spiritual
[1:25:32] it's not isaac it is christ
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:37] it is not peter look at the angel don't
[1:25:40] offend them the angels are there
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:46] let's go to genesis 26 now
[1:25:49] if you dare you can holler amen
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:58] hallelujah
[1:26:00] we are talking about the angels that
[1:26:02] left their first state
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:06] lucifer has his angel
[1:26:09] michael has his angel
[1:26:11] hell was prepared for the devil and his
[1:26:15] angel why human being in hell
[1:26:19] were you ready
[1:26:21] genesis chapter 26 verse 20 25 verse 20.
[1:26:26] i'm sorry
[1:26:27] genesis 25 verse 20.
[1:26:32] if you dare you can say amen
[1:26:34] and isaac was 40 years old
[1:26:38] when he took rebecca
[1:26:40] as a wife
[1:26:42] the daughter of bethel
[1:26:45] the syrian of pentagram
[1:26:48] the sister to lebanon the syrian i love
[1:26:51] the bible
[1:26:54] you ready
[1:26:55] all right put your seat back
[1:26:57] and isaac entreated the lord
[1:27:00] for his wife
[1:27:01] because she was barren and the lord was
[1:27:05] intrigued of him now the word the lord
[1:27:07] answered and rebecca his wife conceived
[1:27:12] about here
[1:27:14] and their children
[1:27:17] struggle
[1:27:18] together inside her
[1:27:21] and she said
[1:27:23] if it be so
[1:27:25] why am i dust
[1:27:26] and she went to inquire of the lord
[1:27:29] to ask god why is this pregnancy i feel
[1:27:34] like these two folks are fighting
[1:27:39] are we clear
[1:27:40] we're looking at naturally
[1:27:42] remember we are there
[1:27:45] verse 23
[1:27:46] and the lord said to her this is the
[1:27:48] interpretation
[1:27:50] to nation
[1:27:55] was isaac a bad man
[1:27:59] was rebecca batman
[1:28:01] isaac was the son of the promise
[1:28:04] god himself came down in genesis 18 and
[1:28:08] gave the promise
[1:28:10] rebecca was the chosen brad by eliezer
[1:28:13] and the angel of the lord
[1:28:15] pure 100
[1:28:18] pure 100
[1:28:20] but when the pregnancy came
[1:28:24] to seed
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:32] in the garden of eden it's different
[1:28:37] let me go
[1:28:40] and the lord said to her two nations
[1:28:43] two kingdoms
[1:28:45] are in your womb
[1:28:47] and two manor of water
[1:28:50] not only is it two nations but these
[1:28:53] nations are not really twins they have
[1:28:56] two different characters one from
[1:28:59] another
[1:29:01] yet coming from the same womb
[1:29:04] watch out church
[1:29:06] shall be separated from your bowels
[1:29:09] and the one people shall be stronger
[1:29:12] than the other people and the elder
[1:29:15] shall serve their younger
[1:29:18] let's put a pause there and now
[1:29:21] get into where i'm going
[1:29:24] paul continue remember in roman we stop
[1:29:28] at nine right
[1:29:30] now to save you from moving back forth
[1:29:32] you stay right there let's look at roman
[1:29:35] nun now not verse 9 but verse 10.
[1:29:39] we clear because verse 9 he was dealing
[1:29:41] with isaac the
[1:29:43] promised and that promise said we know
[1:29:45] that it's christ now we're clear on that
[1:29:47] one
[1:29:48] now paul continues
[1:29:51] paul says
[1:29:52] and not only this
[1:29:54] but when rebecca also had conceived by
[1:29:58] one
[1:30:00] even by our father who
[1:30:04] i'm going to read it again
[1:30:06] not only this but when rebecca also has
[1:30:11] conceived by one
[1:30:15] do you see something there
[1:30:17] did you catch it
[1:30:20] did you catch something there
[1:30:25] did you catch it
[1:30:27] did you see that that is the way the
[1:30:29] bible is written
[1:30:31] there is a written part of the bible and
[1:30:34] there is an unwritten part of the bible
[1:30:37] that lays between the line
[1:30:41] you see that
[1:30:43] you see that
[1:30:44] brother branham said there are 12
[1:30:46] constellations
[1:30:48] amen he started from leo from uh from
[1:30:51] vigo all the way to leo but if you enter
[1:30:54] into the zodiac you're gonna find out
[1:30:56] that there are more than 12
[1:30:58] constellation
[1:31:00] you remember when i thought that but
[1:31:02] you're gonna see that some constellation
[1:31:05] lays within the major constellation so
[1:31:08] for you to see that constellation you
[1:31:11] must first go to the first constellation
[1:31:14] and when you enter that constellation
[1:31:16] then you're gonna find another
[1:31:18] constellation under that constellation
[1:31:21] what are you trying to say
[1:31:23] abraham was old
[1:31:25] stricken with age
[1:31:28] sarah was old when god came and said
[1:31:31] sarah is gonna have a child sarah was so
[1:31:34] old
[1:31:35] that she's laughed she said
[1:31:37] this man is enjoying my food do you
[1:31:40] think really i'm gonna have pleasure
[1:31:41] with
[1:31:42] abraham that's what you read
[1:31:45] marriage and divorce is locked there
[1:31:47] then the bible continues that when
[1:31:50] abraham journey to where abby malek was
[1:31:54] what happened abimelech looked at sarah
[1:31:57] and lasted after her
[1:32:00] how can you last on the grammar
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:04] you see what i'm saying
[1:32:06] over here or over here somebody's
[1:32:09] looking at her beautiful
[1:32:11] everybody here if you read like that you
[1:32:14] won't understand
[1:32:16] that's why you need the message of the
[1:32:18] hour
[1:32:20] everybody here so when the seals are
[1:32:22] broken you can see what was laying
[1:32:26] inside the scripture the thunder that
[1:32:28] were hidden in the scripture
[1:32:32] so now we begin to understand that
[1:32:34] something happened to sarah
[1:32:37] sarah became young again that's why a
[1:32:41] king can look at sarah and see her
[1:32:43] beautiful
[1:32:47] it is a scripture within a scripture
[1:32:51] anybody clear the first scripture
[1:32:54] everybody can read it the second one it
[1:32:56] takes a divine inspiration from god
[1:33:01] that's why to follow this message you
[1:33:03] need the holy ghost
[1:33:05] with that the holy ghost is going to be
[1:33:07] a bunch of intellectual
[1:33:13] anybody here
[1:33:15] let's go back then rebecca also had
[1:33:18] conceived by what
[1:33:20] why god have to say by one
[1:33:24] what do you see there preacher
[1:33:27] you ready
[1:33:29] let me help you up
[1:33:32] in luke chapter 3 38
[1:33:35] the bible says
[1:33:37] which is the son of innocent
[1:33:39] comer which is the son of said
[1:33:42] come on which was the son of who
[1:33:45] which was the son of who
[1:33:47] so adam was a son of god
[1:33:52] not the son of the devil
[1:33:57] genesis 4 verse 1 and adam
[1:34:01] you see the color
[1:34:03] adam knew eve
[1:34:06] did you see the serpent there
[1:34:09] adam knew eve
[1:34:11] his wife and she conceived and bear who
[1:34:15] if you read right here
[1:34:19] the father of cain is who
[1:34:24] you see now
[1:34:28] and she again bear his brother who
[1:34:32] and aber was a keeper of the ship but
[1:34:35] ken was a killer of the ground so based
[1:34:38] on the scripture it seems like cain and
[1:34:42] i and abel both of them came from adam
[1:34:50] john
[1:34:51] the ego let me know
[1:34:53] in first john chapter 3 verse 12
[1:34:56] not as caring
[1:34:58] who was of that word
[1:35:01] stop who was the father of ken here
[1:35:04] but adam was the son of god
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:10] so adam became a wicked one
[1:35:16] adam is a wicked one
[1:35:18] he is a son of god
[1:35:21] so ken came from the wicked one who was
[1:35:24] the adult serpent
[1:35:26] the devil
[1:35:27] in other words
[1:35:29] if gay were conceived by two
[1:35:40] you okay now and then rebecca conceived
[1:35:44] by what
[1:35:45] the serpentine was hidden already
[1:35:56] you look the serpent seed is here i
[1:35:58] don't see it brother brother it's here i
[1:36:00] don't see it brother brother it's here i
[1:36:02] don't see it but it's right there
[1:36:09] in the garden of eden it becomes easy
[1:36:12] for us because it's natural
[1:36:15] we can check the dna of ken
[1:36:18] if we take it to the laboratory we look
[1:36:20] we're going to see that ken was not from
[1:36:23] adam
[1:36:25] and we took the dna of evil we can trace
[1:36:28] that king that evil came from adam
[1:36:32] but that is not the case of
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:36] rebecca we okay now in rebecca case
[1:36:41] if you take his soul he came from isaac
[1:36:44] you take jacob he came from isaac
[1:36:54] that's why paul
[1:36:56] begin to tell you don't look at the
[1:36:58] flesh of israel the problem is not at
[1:37:01] the fresh the problem is on the other
[1:37:04] dimension
[1:37:06] you understand now
[1:37:10] oh my god
[1:37:12] paul said for the children being wiper
[1:37:17] so where is the dna
[1:37:21] we're on the angelic rims
[1:37:23] the children being not yet born neither
[1:37:27] having done any work
[1:37:30] how are you gonna tell which one is good
[1:37:32] they have not done something wrong
[1:37:37] that's the what
[1:37:39] the purpose of god according to what
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:51] according to election
[1:37:54] mustang not of works
[1:37:57] he's so qualified on that one but of him
[1:38:00] that do what remember
[1:38:03] he was said unto her the elder shall
[1:38:06] save the younger as it is written jacob
[1:38:10] ever
[1:38:11] but he saw heaven what
[1:38:13] what have is so done
[1:38:19] the garden of eden easy the serpent
[1:38:21] pom-pom
[1:38:22] came
[1:38:24] he saw you check him naturally
[1:38:27] good
[1:38:29] yet god say i hate him
[1:38:31] so the problem is not here
[1:38:33] the problem is there
[1:38:35] anybody clear
[1:38:37] brother branham say
[1:38:39] in verse 11 the spirit bodily
[1:38:43] wow calls out for the children not being
[1:38:46] born neither having done any good or
[1:38:49] evil that the purpose of god according
[1:38:52] to water
[1:38:54] my stand election only
[1:38:57] have nothing to do with you
[1:38:59] not of works
[1:39:01] but of him that calleth
[1:39:03] this love is elective love
[1:39:08] election even in the angelic beings
[1:39:14] elective love it is his love for his
[1:39:17] water
[1:39:18] and his love for them is apart from
[1:39:21] water
[1:39:22] you have nothing to do
[1:39:30] the pharisee brother branham said they
[1:39:32] have the fruit of the spirit ten times
[1:39:35] more than jesus and jesus look at them
[1:39:38] he said you are of your father the
[1:39:40] people
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:44] thank god
[1:39:46] for election
[1:39:48] thank god because he chose me before the
[1:39:50] foundation of the world
[1:39:52] amen when i was yet sinner christ died
[1:39:56] for me
[1:39:59] when i was smoking when i was drinking
[1:40:01] when i was a prostitute somebody calmed
[1:40:04] the crush for me and he paid the price
[1:40:06] for me and he prayed the price of my
[1:40:09] apartment his name is jesus
[1:40:17] you need to serve him
[1:40:19] not for fear of hell
[1:40:21] not for fear of the second death but for
[1:40:24] love
[1:40:25] because he first loved me
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:30] if it's for fear of hell you're a
[1:40:32] legalist
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:37] if you're afraid of hell that means if
[1:40:39] god remove hell you're not going to
[1:40:41] serve him
[1:40:42] you are serving him because you're
[1:40:44] afraid of hell
[1:40:45] that's why brother branham said even
[1:40:47] though he sent me to hell
[1:40:50] i will be happy to go to hell
[1:40:57] are you there
[1:40:59] because his choice is perfect
[1:41:05] the devil has been playing with you too
[1:41:07] much
[1:41:09] amen the devil has been praying for you
[1:41:12] too much that's that was therefore there
[1:41:14] is no more
[1:41:21] hallelujah his love is apart from human
[1:41:25] merit for he says that the purpose of
[1:41:28] who
[1:41:29] of god standing water not your purpose
[1:41:33] you
[1:41:34] the purpose of god
[1:41:36] he's sold by himself
[1:41:42] which is exactly opposite to works or
[1:41:45] any man has in himself because before
[1:41:49] the children were what
[1:41:51] he had already said jacob have a love
[1:41:54] but he so have had on water about here
[1:41:58] how he could come from that perfect
[1:42:03] pure
[1:42:04] elected
[1:42:06] holy
[1:42:07] consecrated father or mother
[1:42:13] so to bless it
[1:42:15] god caused by what
[1:42:19] it is no more the flesh
[1:42:21] at the beginning you can trace he's a
[1:42:23] philistine his father was philistine is
[1:42:25] this this this god
[1:42:27] changed that completely
[1:42:29] you can be a philistine you remember
[1:42:32] david went and rescued an egyptian among
[1:42:34] the amalekite
[1:42:38] you remember and jeff he also went and
[1:42:41] rescued who rescue a big girl from
[1:42:45] who never a jews a jew from a jew
[1:42:51] you rescue the gentile and rescue also
[1:42:53] the jew
[1:42:55] because neighbor was a fool
[1:42:58] yet he was from the tribe of judah
[1:43:00] and david was from the tribe of judah
[1:43:03] one was wise one foolish
[1:43:08] hallelujah no matter how good your
[1:43:11] father and mother was
[1:43:13] how nice there was how much christian
[1:43:16] your father and mother was young people
[1:43:19] he still lays to you as an individual
[1:43:22] you're standing before god
[1:43:25] hallelujah this lesson teaches that
[1:43:29] they both both the children there was
[1:43:31] even by the elected and call of god
[1:43:35] father and mother a virgin woman rebecca
[1:43:38] and a holy man isaac who finally was
[1:43:41] come down to be even through the seed
[1:43:43] that came jesus christ he was born as
[1:43:46] one from the dead he was tested his
[1:43:49] father before him abraham he was
[1:43:51] promised through this seed of israel of
[1:43:54] isaac that the whole world will be saved
[1:43:57] and out of a man like that
[1:43:59] and his blood so what
[1:44:02] that god who would not even let the
[1:44:06] philistine even touch the mother
[1:44:10] abimelech could not even touch sarah god
[1:44:13] protected that
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:16] after abraham had given her over to him
[1:44:20] god plugged his house and said you are
[1:44:22] as good as one dead
[1:44:25] holding that bloodstream pure and that
[1:44:28] rebecca a righteous holy god sent and
[1:44:31] god called mother and from that holy
[1:44:34] seed came forth air
[1:44:37] and renegade and now
[1:44:39] see so he lays within god's
[1:44:43] god's water
[1:44:48] where are you going
[1:44:50] and then i'm gonna head home because
[1:44:52] it's wednesday
[1:44:54] i still have my minute anybody clear
[1:44:57] if you look
[1:44:59] on genesis 26
[1:45:03] verse
[1:45:04] 22 back again
[1:45:08] the bible says that the children
[1:45:11] struggle brother robert
[1:45:13] they struggle away
[1:45:16] in the womb
[1:45:20] you ready
[1:45:21] the children did in struggle after birth
[1:45:26] somebody called it
[1:45:27] they struggle before birth
[1:45:34] we have many mothers here
[1:45:36] all you can hear when your child was in
[1:45:39] your womb was probably a kick
[1:45:41] a kick
[1:45:42] that was it but this is
[1:45:45] not a kick
[1:45:47] it's like somebody
[1:45:49] is punching the other
[1:45:53] let's go slowly
[1:45:55] amen
[1:45:57] struggle inside her and she said if it
[1:46:00] be so why am i
[1:46:02] and she went to inquire of the lord
[1:46:05] and the lord said to her two nations
[1:46:08] are in yo
[1:46:10] and two manners of people
[1:46:13] what is going on
[1:46:15] let's look at this a little bit
[1:46:18] brother branham say
[1:46:20] you are believing unto eternal life
[1:46:24] but when the holy spirit comes it is
[1:46:26] eternal life
[1:46:28] you are believing on two
[1:46:30] you are begotten of the spirit at
[1:46:32] sanctification but never born of the
[1:46:34] spirit until the holy ghost come in you
[1:46:37] comes in you that's correct
[1:46:39] watch now
[1:46:40] a baby's got life in the womb of her of
[1:46:44] the mother
[1:46:46] little what
[1:46:47] are quivering it is
[1:46:50] but it's a different life
[1:46:55] when he breathes
[1:46:57] the breath of life into its nostrils it
[1:47:00] is water
[1:47:03] so based on what brother branham is
[1:47:05] saying here when a woman is pregnant she
[1:47:09] has conceived
[1:47:10] what is moving there is just muscle
[1:47:17] that life
[1:47:19] that the baby got came from his father
[1:47:22] because the father had the hemoglobin
[1:47:25] amen and he came from the father
[1:47:28] fertilized the egg and that life began
[1:47:31] to grow but the baby is not really there
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] everybody okay now are we digging good
[1:47:41] are we digging good
[1:47:43] so
[1:47:44] if what is in the womb
[1:47:46] is massage moving
[1:47:49] with the life that came from the male
[1:47:51] cell
[1:47:56] yet those muscles were fighting
[1:48:06] it was a fight
[1:48:10] of flesh
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:16] anybody clear but the children were not
[1:48:19] there
[1:48:21] ever here because if mama delivered that
[1:48:24] child
[1:48:25] and the breath of life does not enter
[1:48:28] that child
[1:48:29] that child will be dead
[1:48:31] we call that a still birth
[1:48:34] so where was the fight really
[1:48:44] because the nature
[1:48:46] only is reflecting something
[1:48:58] you remember the other day
[1:49:00] going through that when a little baby's
[1:49:03] been formed in the womb keep your colors
[1:49:06] off the mothers and these little muscles
[1:49:09] are kicking and jumping and going on
[1:49:12] but as soon as the mother drops the baby
[1:49:15] and the babies to the earth the first
[1:49:17] thing there is a water
[1:49:20] to do what
[1:49:21] to catch the water
[1:49:23] so a human being have a spiritual body
[1:49:28] and the natural body
[1:49:32] yet the natural only kick
[1:49:37] the true person is a spiritual body
[1:49:42] but when you look at the womb one is
[1:49:44] punching the other
[1:49:47] yet they are not there
[1:49:53] hallelujah
[1:49:54] when you look at the scriptures
[1:49:56] superficially
[1:49:58] when a babysitting baby is being formed
[1:50:01] in a womb of a mother
[1:50:04] first it is a water
[1:50:06] a spirit and as the spirit begin to take
[1:50:08] on flesh a little germ of life begins to
[1:50:11] take home flesh and as soon as he drops
[1:50:14] from it in the womb it is a lot of
[1:50:16] quivering jerking muscles we know that
[1:50:19] that is what
[1:50:21] just like you take a horse hair and put
[1:50:23] it in the water it shut and um
[1:50:26] it will cap over and it will move and
[1:50:28] you touch it and it will jump that is
[1:50:30] the way a baby's
[1:50:31] but as soon as it's born in this world
[1:50:35] and breathe its first breath it become a
[1:50:37] what a living soul because as soon as
[1:50:41] the earthly body is born into the world
[1:50:44] there is a water
[1:50:46] or a water
[1:50:48] to take a hold of it
[1:50:50] and as soon as this natural body is
[1:50:52] dropped there is water
[1:50:57] as the baby drop into the flesh
[1:51:01] into the earth and flesh there is a
[1:51:03] spiritual body waiting to receive it and
[1:51:06] as soon as the spiritual body i mean the
[1:51:08] natural body is dissolved there is a
[1:51:11] spiritual body waiting under a what
[1:51:16] let me adjust it here
[1:51:19] you okay
[1:51:21] when god touched him at his birth back
[1:51:24] there
[1:51:25] and received the water
[1:51:27] the holy ghost three months before he
[1:51:30] was born
[1:51:31] because john the baptist was six months
[1:51:33] when elizabeth met mary if you need a
[1:51:36] scripture you see me
[1:51:37] yes sir when mary went up and leader
[1:51:41] john was six-month-old in his mother's
[1:51:44] womb and he never damn little what
[1:51:48] brother branham is consistent
[1:51:50] martials had never moved yet
[1:51:53] brother branham said didn't say lord
[1:51:56] john didn't move
[1:51:58] the muscles of john
[1:52:00] yet and mary was afraid the little
[1:52:03] muscle were growing but she could not
[1:52:06] feel no life elizabeth his mother rather
[1:52:09] and when mary came up and grabbed her
[1:52:11] and hug her put her arm laid hand on her
[1:52:14] say
[1:52:15] god has spoke to me and i'm going to
[1:52:17] have a baby too are you and joseph
[1:52:20] married no
[1:52:21] merry heart then can this be the holy
[1:52:23] ghost shall overshadow me and they will
[1:52:25] be created in me
[1:52:28] and i shall and i shall call his name
[1:52:31] who
[1:52:32] he shall be the son of god and as soon
[1:52:35] as that word jesus spoke
[1:52:39] little water
[1:52:40] begin to do what
[1:52:57] and jump around his mother
[1:53:00] the masters of john
[1:53:02] begin to reflect
[1:53:04] another john somewhere who is jumping
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:12] [Applause]
[1:53:15] he all started back there
[1:53:17] are you there
[1:53:19] she said blessed be the lord god for
[1:53:22] once cometh the mother of my lord the
[1:53:24] mother of my lord oh my whence cometh
[1:53:27] the mother of my lord for as soon as
[1:53:29] your salutation come into my ear my
[1:53:32] water
[1:53:33] leaping ma
[1:53:34] for what
[1:53:36] what moves in the body
[1:53:42] why you men go to hell
[1:53:46] i'm going to head to the airport
[1:53:49] in the message who is this melchizedek i
[1:53:51] was going with the progression of
[1:53:53] brother branham
[1:53:54] think of a little baby you can take a
[1:53:56] woman no matter how evil she is
[1:54:00] when she's pregnant and fixing to be
[1:54:02] mother
[1:54:04] watch before that baby's born
[1:54:06] i don't care how cruel the woman is she
[1:54:09] gets real kind
[1:54:10] there is something about her seems godly
[1:54:13] to see a little mother fixing to become
[1:54:16] mother by the baby why is it
[1:54:20] that little body
[1:54:22] now it's not alive yet
[1:54:26] but sometimes he fights
[1:54:29] sometimes he lives for joy
[1:54:31] yet it's not alive
[1:54:34] the only thing it is is just flesh and
[1:54:36] water
[1:54:38] that little jumping that is just muscle
[1:54:41] jerking but when it comes forth from the
[1:54:43] womb god
[1:54:46] breathe
[1:54:47] the breath of life into it and then he
[1:54:51] screams out as sure as there is a
[1:54:54] natural body being formed in the womb
[1:54:57] there is a water
[1:54:59] a spiritual body to receive it as soon
[1:55:02] as he gets there in other words when the
[1:55:04] baby comes the spiritual body enter the
[1:55:07] baby
[1:55:08] because james 2 26 say the body without
[1:55:12] the spirit is water
[1:55:18] on
[1:55:18] we're going to jump
[1:55:20] the moment when a woman is fixing to
[1:55:22] have a baby you notice i don't care how
[1:55:24] cruel she's been and how mean you know a
[1:55:28] while before that baby's born the mother
[1:55:31] gets gentle
[1:55:32] why is it
[1:55:34] when them leader muscle same
[1:55:38] thought
[1:55:39] over the year that them little muscle in
[1:55:42] that won't be switching and jumping like
[1:55:44] that there is a water
[1:55:47] spiritual body heavenly bodies
[1:55:50] brother branham can you please be
[1:55:51] specific
[1:55:53] there is a spiritual body waiting for
[1:55:56] him and when it comes from the mother
[1:55:58] the doctor or the midwife whoever it is
[1:56:01] has to pick up and shock it
[1:56:03] spank it
[1:56:05] shake it or something then it catches
[1:56:08] the what
[1:56:09] the breath of life and the liver
[1:56:19] you are
[1:56:20] an angel
[1:56:27] the little angelic being
[1:56:29] comes into it the breath of what
[1:56:33] and he become a living
[1:56:35] and when we have crust in our heart and
[1:56:38] christ become real in our heart it is a
[1:56:40] little water
[1:56:45] you okay now
[1:56:48] how
[1:56:52] let me go there hey brother baby
[1:56:55] everybody clear so now we can see here
[1:56:58] that brother branham shows that the
[1:57:00] spirit of a man
[1:57:04] is also an angel
[1:57:07] so angel
[1:57:09] do not only mean
[1:57:12] angelic being but your spirit is also an
[1:57:16] angel
[1:57:18] why do you men go to hell
[1:57:22] the devil and he is
[1:57:28] ethiophany
[1:57:32] ethiophani
[1:57:34] when they saw peter they call it what
[1:57:39] your spirit
[1:57:40] is called what
[1:57:49] let me finish
[1:57:51] these two boys
[1:57:53] if you shall notice their nature
[1:57:56] by nature is so has the position
[1:58:03] he so had the birthright
[1:58:04] judah had a position
[1:58:07] abayatah had a position
[1:58:09] the devil had a position but the devil
[1:58:12] lost his position ibiada lost his
[1:58:16] position judah lost his position he so
[1:58:20] lost his position as the elder
[1:58:24] he lost the birthright why all of them
[1:58:27] keep losing their position the angel
[1:58:30] which was in heaven lost their estate
[1:58:38] if you notice one of them was spiritual
[1:58:41] man that was jacob and when the colonel
[1:58:44] man was who
[1:58:45] the bible said esau was a man of the
[1:58:48] field
[1:58:49] and jesus said in matthew 13 that they
[1:58:51] feel this what
[1:58:53] he was a worldly man
[1:58:56] but they were both religious
[1:58:59] that same thing has took place all down
[1:59:02] through the
[1:59:04] the colonel and
[1:59:06] no more in the flesh
[1:59:08] back there
[1:59:09] is so represented the man of the earth
[1:59:13] natural religious inclined like judah
[1:59:16] but never able
[1:59:18] it was not in him
[1:59:20] to do it he could not do it he never was
[1:59:24] in him to be able to climb and pass the
[1:59:27] things of the what
[1:59:29] the corner things why did you climb
[1:59:31] above it
[1:59:34] somebody else could not clamp it you had
[1:59:37] friends that are still smoking smoking
[1:59:40] smoking drinking and they die with the
[1:59:43] shoes they put on their on their shoes
[1:59:46] why did you quit
[1:59:49] what is the devil telling you
[1:59:52] because you got mad god forget you
[1:59:56] but jacob it was so easy
[2:00:00] for him to do it now jacob had one
[2:00:02] purpose
[2:00:04] and that was he longed for that
[2:00:06] birthright why
[2:00:09] who explained him the birthright
[2:00:12] usually the youngest one is mama's best
[2:00:14] buddy mama would hang with the little
[2:00:16] one the benjamin
[2:00:19] but he didn't want to be benjamin
[2:00:23] are you there no matter how he got it
[2:00:26] just regarded and that spirit of that
[2:00:28] one birth is still represented in the
[2:00:30] world today it is coming to a head now
[2:00:33] the spiritual believer and the carnal
[2:00:35] believer carnal believer no one could
[2:00:38] say they was not both religious
[2:00:42] they were they didn't say that one
[2:00:44] servant
[2:00:46] and the other god they were above water
[2:00:50] how can you tell a difference now
[2:00:54] in eden you can go to the laboratory and
[2:00:56] prove that that cain was not a son of
[2:00:59] adam in eden you can go to the
[2:01:01] laboratory take the blood of abel and go
[2:01:04] to the laboratory and prove that abel
[2:01:06] was a child of adam
[2:01:08] but in the case of
[2:01:10] rebecca and isaac both pureline if you
[2:01:14] use the human intellect you will never
[2:01:17] be able to catch it
[2:01:19] how are you gonna tell which is what
[2:01:24] hallelujah
[2:01:25] because jesus said many will come in my
[2:01:28] name
[2:01:29] because they're both religious
[2:01:31] they will say have we not done what
[2:01:34] caster devo prophesies in your name
[2:01:37] speaking in tongues all these things and
[2:01:39] jesus said i never knew you
[2:01:44] how can you tell them brother stephen
[2:01:47] give them the word
[2:01:55] how can you know it speak the word
[2:01:58] see what they say about it
[2:02:01] if they don't believe the world
[2:02:04] they have no seed germ in them
[2:02:07] they are off the water
[2:02:09] and deceive you
[2:02:14] church that's why i keep grounding you
[2:02:16] in the scripture the bible says brother
[2:02:19] branham say the bible say brother
[2:02:21] branham said because we are interpreting
[2:02:23] the bible according to the revelation of
[2:02:26] the mystery that's what paul said in
[2:02:28] romans 16 25 that's why i grant you in
[2:02:31] the word
[2:02:32] in the scripture
[2:02:38] are you there
[2:02:39] as the first blood was deceived and the
[2:02:43] second blood was deceived they are
[2:02:45] deceiver of the water
[2:02:47] which is ours
[2:02:49] by what
[2:02:51] are breeding the word of water
[2:02:54] god never plays sons ahead of his word
[2:02:58] [Applause]
[2:03:05] if it's so judah will deceive you
[2:03:08] if it saw the anointing one at the end
[2:03:11] time will deceive you if it saw the
[2:03:13] pentecostal had miracles that would
[2:03:15] deceive you
[2:03:19] hallelujah amen that is his culture
[2:03:24] god
[2:03:25] never placed signs ahead of his word
[2:03:29] they were added for proof
[2:03:32] of the word but the word is first
[2:03:40] to prove it elijah said to the woman
[2:03:43] bake me a cake first then watch the
[2:03:46] miracle
[2:03:47] come to the world fast and then watch
[2:03:51] the water
[2:03:52] the seed word itself is what the holy
[2:03:55] spirit energizes
[2:03:57] this sunset follow
[2:04:05] are you there
[2:04:06] so i don't care how many miracles you do
[2:04:09] i don't care how many dreams you have i
[2:04:11] don't care what is going on in your life
[2:04:14] you must produce a life word a pure
[2:04:18] consecrated word that is line up with
[2:04:21] the word of god
[2:04:27] don't tell me you spiritual and you are
[2:04:28] the order with the word
[2:04:30] that is the wrong seed
[2:04:32] power with our character is satanic and
[2:04:36] it's not fit to rain but for the
[2:04:38] overcomer of laodicea to him that
[2:04:41] overcome he must reign
[2:04:43] you need character by the word
[2:04:48] and if the word is presented pure
[2:04:51] receive pure automatically the
[2:04:53] miraculous will follow your life
[2:04:56] you don't follow for them they follow
[2:04:58] you the miracle will knock at your door
[2:05:01] and say we are here because you believe
[2:05:03] in the word
[2:05:05] let's stand up
[2:05:10] [Applause]
[2:05:20] i'm sorry i went four minutes ahead
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:24] hallelujah
[2:05:26] keep in mind
[2:05:28] hell prepare for the devil and water
[2:05:31] so from today you know the word angel in
[2:05:34] the bible means many things
[2:05:37] you understand now an angel could be the
[2:05:40] spirit of a man
[2:05:42] an angel could be a teopany
[2:05:44] like peter an angel could be also an
[2:05:48] angelic being
[2:05:49] like the book of hebrews say they are
[2:05:51] ministering spirit i have it here but i
[2:05:54] don't want to keep going because of time
[2:05:56] i already have it
[2:05:57] so when they say the devil and his angel
[2:06:00] now you understand
[2:06:02] why you men can go to hell
[2:06:04] they're going to hell because their
[2:06:06] angelic spirit
[2:06:08] they are angel also by the angelic
[2:06:10] spirit
[2:06:13] so the kingdom of the devil and the
[2:06:15] kingdom of god got these three things
[2:06:18] god
[2:06:19] got his angelic children
[2:06:22] before we were born
[2:06:24] we were angelic beings
[2:06:26] i will show you those quotes on sunday
[2:06:27] lords willing and when you born from
[2:06:29] your mother you got in
[2:06:31] god helps also have ministering spirit
[2:06:35] like gabriel like wormwood those angels
[2:06:39] amen and god also have theophany which
[2:06:43] are the angel that they saw peter
[2:06:45] on the other kingdom the devil also have
[2:06:48] his children
[2:06:50] angelic beings also he also have his
[2:06:52] ministering spirit which we call demons
[2:06:57] amen and he also have theophany
[2:07:02] that's why brother branham said when i
[2:07:03] went when he went to hell he saw them in
[2:07:06] the theophany the difference our
[2:07:09] theophany have the same age
[2:07:13] according to the scripture
[2:07:15] amen and their theophany have different
[2:07:18] ages
[2:07:20] that's why in the judgment of the throne
[2:07:23] the
[2:07:23] the white throne remember the bible said
[2:07:26] they will be small and great
[2:07:28] amen because somebody will die young and
[2:07:32] they're going to resurrect young if you
[2:07:34] go to hell you see them young
[2:07:36] if they were not born in christ but if
[2:07:39] they were born in christ if you go there
[2:07:41] or everybody if you were 90 years old
[2:07:44] brother branham saw that woman
[2:07:46] as 18 years old
[2:07:48] amen brother branham saw his baby that
[2:07:51] died as a baby over there 18 years old
[2:07:54] in hell it's a different story there is
[2:07:57] two kingdoms both of them get angelic
[2:07:59] spirit of man
[2:08:01] theophanies and angelic ministering on
[2:08:04] the other side they are called demons
[2:08:07] everybody clear
[2:08:09] it is about election
[2:08:11] that's why paul said examine yourself
[2:08:14] whether you are in there
[2:08:16] and remember on sunday jesus prayed for
[2:08:18] peter
[2:08:19] he prayed for what for his faith

[2:09:14] for your grace
[2:09:16] for your love and for this elective love
[2:09:20] that have chosen was
[2:09:22] before the foundation of the world
[2:09:25] father i'm so happy
[2:09:28] for this love
[2:09:29] because it takes away all our human
[2:09:32] ability
[2:09:34] there is nothing that we can brag
[2:09:36] there is nothing that we can boast
[2:09:39] the only boasting is like what paul said
[2:09:42] that if i could boast our boast in the
[2:09:45] lord
[2:09:45] because paul could not even boast
[2:09:48] according to the religion
[2:09:50] he show his curriculum vitae how he was
[2:09:53] a pharisee of the pharisee how he was
[2:09:56] born of the tribe of benjamin how he was
[2:09:58] zealous upon following the tradition of
[2:10:01] the father and yet he persecuted the
[2:10:03] church there was nothing he could boast
[2:10:06] but one day he met you as a light a
[2:10:09] pillar of fire and from there on paul
[2:10:12] understood the power of weakness
[2:10:14] even to glory in the weakness because he
[2:10:18] understood that when he was more weaker
[2:10:20] then father you were stronger and
[2:10:23] stronger in his life lord
[2:10:25] oh heavenly father i thank you for
[2:10:27] unveiling this election to us lord
