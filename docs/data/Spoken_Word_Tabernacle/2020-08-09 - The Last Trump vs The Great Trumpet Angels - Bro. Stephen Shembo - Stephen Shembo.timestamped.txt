[45:25] god weakly bless you
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:30] who has despised the days of small
[45:33] things
[45:35] oh my goodness praise the lord to just
[45:38] clarify what brother chamber was trying
[45:41] to express
[45:43] we dedicated the tough money to go to
[45:46] the building
[45:47] this church we don't have a history and
[45:50] i talked to a banker and they say they
[45:52] usually lend money for
[45:53] church that has been established for 10
[45:56] years
[45:57] we are not 10 years law yet but we have
[46:00] a god of
[46:01] miracle so if you have something like a
[46:05] building fund
[46:06] dedicated just for the building and you
[46:08] want to give it just right on your check
[46:10] building fund
[46:11] and we're going to put that aside and
[46:13] it's going to be that
[46:14] plus the top money and see if we can get
[46:17] something bigger
[46:18] that we can present to the bank and they
[46:20] can change their mind by the grace of
[46:21] god so
[46:22] just trying to clarify and make sure
[46:24] everything is good brother john you are
[46:26] good this is a
[46:27] house of worship you've seen a lot of
[46:30] people
[46:31] popping up here that were not popping up
[46:33] before
[46:35] so everybody's getting loose and free
[46:38] so we want you to be free this is the
[46:40] house of god
[46:41] it is not the house of brother stephen
[46:44] it is the house of god
[46:45] it's a family of god everybody should be
[46:48] free to worship god
[46:50] according to the leadership of the holy
[46:52] spirit
[46:53] if you don't mind let's go to joshua
[46:55] chapter six
[46:57] last week we clearly identify
[47:01] who zero the bell was so every brother
[47:05] in this church should be able to preach
[47:07] jeroboam and every sister should be able
[47:11] to exhort
[47:12] the rubber bear
[47:16] brother elijah would you help me we can
[47:18] move this a little bit forward
[47:20] joshua chapter six this is a very
[47:24] tough and difficult uh
[47:28] teaching today just a little bit more so
[47:30] i want you to stay awake
[47:33] because the message has been attacked
[47:35] also through what we're gonna be
[47:37] speaking
[47:38] joshua chapter six verse one
[47:41] and jericho was straightly shut up
[47:44] in other words he was closed he was
[47:47] sealed
[47:48] because of the children of israel none
[47:51] went out
[47:52] and no one came in so there was no
[47:54] children of israel so jericho was sealed
[47:56] out
[47:57] and israel also sealed out you might be
[48:00] seated
[48:04] in other words the world was sealed out
[48:07] from the children of israel and the
[48:10] children of israel also were sealed out
[48:13] from the world no communication
[48:16] and the lord said to joshua see i have
[48:19] given into your hand jericho and the
[48:21] king thereof
[48:23] and the mighty men of valor and you
[48:25] shall compass the city
[48:27] all you men of war so the one hour
[48:31] marching or compassing the city where
[48:35] the man of war not everybody
[48:38] the man of war in other words it was an
[48:40] army
[48:41] that were marching onward christian
[48:46] soldier
[48:48] it's going to come up and go round about
[48:50] the city
[48:51] once does shall you do
[48:54] six days in other words there is jericho
[48:58] and israel were given instruction by the
[49:00] angel of the lord
[49:02] to go around the city every day one time
[49:06] for six days so on the first day one
[49:09] time
[49:11] second day one time third day one time
[49:14] up to the sixth day only one time
[49:21] verse four and seven priests
[49:26] shall bear before the ark
[49:29] 7 trumpet because we're going to get in
[49:31] the trumpets today
[49:33] of rams horn so we have an army
[49:36] marching before and beyond the army
[49:39] there are
[49:40] seven priests but each priest
[49:43] was carrying a trumpet but those
[49:46] trumpets were made out of harm
[49:49] rams horn so if you take a
[49:54] rams horn to make a trumpet that means
[49:57] you have to kill darren
[50:01] right it takes the death of a ram
[50:05] to produce the horn and that horn
[50:08] was taken by seven priests not
[50:12] five not four not six not eight
[50:15] but seven remember jeroboam
[50:19] zero baby always work with joshua the
[50:22] high priest
[50:23] right and this is joshua also
[50:26] but he had preached under him but they
[50:29] only chose
[50:30] seven out of all the priests
[50:34] there were seven special priests that
[50:37] have been chosen out
[50:39] to carry the ram's horn trumpet
[50:43] and the seventh day you shall compass
[50:46] the city seven times so the first day
[50:50] one time second day one time third day
[50:55] one time sixth day one time but on the
[50:58] seventh day
[51:00] one two three four five six seven
[51:08] you shall compress the city seven times
[51:11] and the priest shall blow with the
[51:13] trumpet
[51:14] after seven times and it shall come to
[51:17] pass that when they make a long
[51:20] blast so those trumpets
[51:23] unite together into wine
[51:27] the seventh sound of the trumpet united
[51:30] together into one sound
[51:32] and he made a long blast if you remember
[51:36] when moses was pulling the children of
[51:38] israel to monsanta
[51:40] there was a trumpet that were making a
[51:42] long
[51:43] blast because god was talking
[51:47] everybody there with their rams horn
[51:51] and when you hear the sound of the
[51:53] trumpet
[51:54] all the people shall shout with a great
[51:58] shout
[51:59] so nobody was permitted to speak on the
[52:02] first day
[52:04] on the second day nobody was permitted
[52:07] to speak
[52:09] everybody must come past the city but be
[52:12] quiet
[52:13] the power of the spoken word was
[52:16] released
[52:17] on the seventh day after they
[52:20] turned the city seven times
[52:25] then the shout is released
[52:29] everybody there and the wall of the city
[52:32] shall fall down
[52:33] flat and the people shall ascend every
[52:37] man
[52:37] straight if you start if you study the
[52:40] four beasts
[52:41] you'll find that when the four beasts
[52:43] move they always move straight
[52:48] they don't move sideways we will get
[52:50] into that later
[52:52] and joshua's son the son of noon called
[52:55] the priest
[52:56] and said to them take up the ark of
[53:00] the covenant and let seven priests bear
[53:03] the seventh trumpet of rem's horn
[53:06] before the ark of the lord
[53:09] and he said to the people pass on
[53:12] and compass the cd and let him that his
[53:15] arm
[53:16] pass on before the ark of the lord
[53:18] everybody clear
[53:20] job to verse nine
[53:23] and the armed man went before the priest
[53:26] that blew
[53:27] with the trumpet and the real word in
[53:30] other words the real
[53:31] guard came after the ark
[53:35] the priest going on and blowing with the
[53:38] trumpet
[53:39] so in other words there was an army
[53:41] before
[53:47] then after the army followed seven
[53:49] priests
[53:52] and after the priest there was an ark of
[53:55] the covenant
[53:58] and after the ark of the covenant there
[54:00] was another army
[54:03] so if you sit down and you watch israel
[54:08] when there is a march going on the army
[54:11] comes first
[54:13] are you there and then when the march or
[54:17] the parade is
[54:18] finished there is another army last
[54:22] so there was an army at the beginning
[54:25] and there was also an army at the end
[54:29] and in between those army there were
[54:32] seven priests
[54:34] are you there praise the lord
[54:38] verse 10 and joshua had commanded the
[54:41] people saying
[54:42] you shall not shout nor make any noise
[54:45] with your voice
[54:47] neither shall any word proceed out of
[54:49] your mouth everybody quiet no power
[54:52] of the spoken word until the day i beat
[54:55] you shout
[54:56] then you shall shout job
[54:59] to verse 16. and he came to pass at the
[55:02] seven times
[55:04] when the priest blew with the trumpet
[55:06] joshua said to the people
[55:08] shout for the lord has given you the
[55:10] city
[55:11] and the city shall be a curse even it
[55:14] and all that are doing to the lord only
[55:17] rehab or harlot there was a woman there
[55:21] under a spirit of prostitution
[55:25] under a babylonian spirit
[55:28] everybody there she all she and all that
[55:31] are with her in her house
[55:33] because she heed the messenger that were
[55:36] sent i will send you elijah the prophet
[55:41] you must be able to cherish the
[55:43] messenger
[55:44] because your life is connected to
[55:48] how you handle that messenger
[55:53] and not only your life but the life of
[55:56] your family
[55:59] are you there the way help handle
[56:03] the messenger protect or save the hair
[56:06] and her entire family
[56:10] praise the lord verse 18
[56:14] and you in any ways will keep yourself
[56:18] from the accursed things lest you make
[56:20] yourself a curse
[56:22] when you take off the accursed things
[56:24] and make the camp of israel a curse and
[56:26] trouble it
[56:28] verse 19 but all the
[56:32] silver and gold
[56:35] and vessel of brass and iron are
[56:38] consecrated to the lord
[56:40] they shall come into the treasury of the
[56:42] lord so inside
[56:44] jericho there is four medals
[56:50] we have what what is the first one we
[56:53] have silver
[56:55] we have gold we have brass
[57:00] and we have iron inside jericho
[57:04] everybody clear
[57:08] let's go to daniel chapter 12.
[57:11] okay somebody called it already
[57:13] [Laughter]
[57:17] in this church make sure you read your
[57:19] bible every day
[57:21] and you listen to the message and you
[57:24] pray
[57:25] if not you're going to be lost your gps
[57:28] will be like signal lost
[57:30] signal lost
[57:33] daniel 12 verse 4
[57:38] jericho have a spirit of babylon
[57:41] and jericho have four medals
[57:44] together in one city
[57:48] everybody there daniel chapter 12 verse
[57:51] 4 but
[57:52] you are daniel shut up the word and seal
[57:55] the book
[57:56] like revelation 10. even to the time of
[57:59] the end
[58:00] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[58:02] shall be increased
[58:04] everybody there they're not daniel luke
[58:06] and behalf there stood
[58:08] other two the one on this side of the
[58:10] bank of the river
[58:12] and the other on that side of the bank
[58:13] of the river and one said to
[58:16] the main club in what in linan
[58:19] which was upon the water of the river
[58:21] how long shall it be
[58:23] to the end of these wonders so daniel is
[58:26] speaking about a vision where there is a
[58:28] river
[58:29] and there is water in this river but on
[58:32] one side of the river there is somebody
[58:35] there
[58:36] on the other side of the river there is
[58:38] also another person
[58:40] and on the middle of the river upon the
[58:43] order
[58:44] there is also somebody standing there so
[58:47] there is three people
[58:49] in vision of daniel 12. everybody clear
[58:53] verse seven and i heard the man clothing
[58:55] lining which was upon the waters of the
[58:58] river
[58:59] when he held up his right hand and left
[59:01] hand to heaven
[59:02] like revelation 10 and stole
[59:06] by him that lived forever that it shall
[59:09] be for a time
[59:10] time and a half and when he shall have
[59:13] accomplished to scatter the power of the
[59:15] holy people
[59:16] all these things shall be finished
[59:19] this man again finished in revelation 10
[59:23] when he shall sign the trumpet all the
[59:25] mystery must be
[59:26] finished everybody clear and i heard
[59:30] just like john but i understood
[59:33] not if you notice daniel did not
[59:36] understood the meaning
[59:40] but not john okay
[59:44] then i said oh my lord what shall be the
[59:46] end of these things
[59:48] and he said go your way daniel for the
[59:51] words are closed up and still
[59:53] till the time of the end
[59:56] many shall be purified and made white
[59:59] and try
[1:00:00] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[1:00:02] none of the wicked shall understand by
[1:00:04] the wise
[1:00:04] shall understand everybody clear last
[1:00:08] scripture but you need to keep your
[1:00:09] bible
[1:00:10] revelation chapter 11 you need to keep
[1:00:13] your bible i don't want you to say
[1:00:14] brothers
[1:00:15] even say the bible say brother brother
[1:00:18] i'm saying
[1:00:19] everybody there revelation chapter 11
[1:00:22] verse 3 if you dare you can say amen
[1:00:25] and i will give power to my two
[1:00:28] witnesses we already preach about this
[1:00:30] it's moses and elijah and they shall
[1:00:33] prophesy a thousand
[1:00:34] two hundred and three score days clothed
[1:00:37] in south cloth
[1:00:38] these are the two olive trees and the
[1:00:41] two candlesticks
[1:00:42] standing before the god of the earth we
[1:00:44] went through this
[1:00:45] so in revelation 11 this is daniel 12.
[1:00:50] in revelation chapter 11 we found two
[1:00:53] people again
[1:00:58] remember elijah and moses are the ones
[1:01:00] that are on the right and the
[1:01:01] left side we already proved to you all
[1:01:04] of that
[1:01:05] are you there and if and if any man will
[1:01:08] hurt them fire proceeded out of their
[1:01:10] mouth
[1:01:11] we already declared to you who's elijah
[1:01:14] and devour their enemy and in
[1:01:15] if and if any man will hurt them
[1:01:19] he must in this man be killed these have
[1:01:22] the power to shut heaven
[1:01:24] we prove to you it was elijah that he
[1:01:26] went not in the days of their prophecy
[1:01:28] elijah did that and have power over the
[1:01:31] water
[1:01:31] to turn them to blood that's moses and
[1:01:34] to smite the earth with all plants that
[1:01:36] moses
[1:01:37] as often as the will two people
[1:01:41] jump now to verse 15 this is where the
[1:01:43] problem is
[1:01:45] and the seven angel sounded
[1:01:49] so we have a third person in revelation
[1:01:52] 11. we have two anointed and there is
[1:01:55] another person here
[1:01:57] which have a trumpet right
[1:02:01] in revelation 10 we only have the mad
[1:02:04] danger
[1:02:06] right and we have the seven angel
[1:02:11] but this angel also is called the seven
[1:02:15] engine
[1:02:17] and the people say that this seven angel
[1:02:20] is the same as this one therefore
[1:02:23] brother branham is not fulfilling
[1:02:25] malachi
[1:02:26] or revelation 10. we want to correct
[1:02:29] that in proper teaching
[1:02:32] and the seven angels sounded and there
[1:02:35] were great voices
[1:02:36] and in heaven saying the kingdom of this
[1:02:39] world
[1:02:40] i become the kingdom of our lord and of
[1:02:42] his christ
[1:02:44] and he shall reign forever another
[1:02:47] and the four and 20 elders
[1:02:50] if you go to revelation 5 when they took
[1:02:53] the book
[1:02:54] it was the 4 and 20 elders plus the four
[1:02:58] beasts
[1:02:59] the bow down but in revelation 11
[1:03:02] the four beasts are omitting because the
[1:03:05] four beasts
[1:03:05] only belong to the churches they don't
[1:03:08] belong to israel
[1:03:09] so no mention of them here everybody
[1:03:12] clear
[1:03:13] fell upon their faces and worship god
[1:03:17] let me jump to verse 19 and the temple
[1:03:20] of god was opened in heaven
[1:03:22] there is an opening of the temple and
[1:03:25] there was sin
[1:03:26] in that in his temple the ark of the
[1:03:29] testament
[1:03:30] so the word was revealed under this
[1:03:33] trumpet
[1:03:34] right and there were lightning and
[1:03:37] voices and thundering
[1:03:38] an earthquake and great wealth so
[1:03:42] daniel 12 have three people one here
[1:03:46] and two over there revelation 11
[1:03:49] have three people there is two anointed
[1:03:53] but there is also the seven angel these
[1:03:56] two anointed we know that they are moses
[1:03:59] and elijah they are human and they're
[1:04:02] gonna kill them
[1:04:04] in other words they are earthly
[1:04:06] messenger
[1:04:07] and this one is an angel
[1:04:11] he comes from heaven he is a heavenly
[1:04:14] angel let's pray heavenly father lord we
[1:04:18] thank you for your grace you love your
[1:04:20] mercy
[1:04:21] father and for everything you're doing
[1:04:23] for us lord you've given us another
[1:04:25] opportunity
[1:04:26] to gather together around the revealed
[1:04:28] word of the hour
[1:04:29] lord may you move me completely out of
[1:04:31] the way may you come and speak to your
[1:04:34] children
[1:04:34] may the holy spirit the inside teacher
[1:04:37] come and unfold and reveal your word to
[1:04:40] your children
[1:04:41] father minister to your children
[1:04:43] according to their need
[1:04:44] as we commit everything sealing the
[1:04:46] devil out of this place
[1:04:48] all spirit of virus coronavirus or
[1:04:51] whatever disease is lord
[1:04:53] father we will build them from this
[1:04:55] place in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:58] may your blood protect each one of us
[1:05:00] and remember those that are streaming
[1:05:02] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:05:06] god bless you all how many enjoy the
[1:05:08] service on wednesday
[1:05:10] praise the lord
[1:05:15] that was a masterpiece from a dot
[1:05:18] to a destination
[1:05:22] today we have a small room i got used
[1:05:24] now to double room
[1:05:27] so hang tight with me we are dealing
[1:05:30] with this subject this morning
[1:05:33] the last trump versus
[1:05:37] the great trumpet so the problem is
[1:05:40] in revelation 10 there is
[1:05:43] a mighty ranger that came down put one
[1:05:46] foot
[1:05:47] upon the earth and one foot upon the sea
[1:05:51] but in the book of daniel we found out
[1:05:54] that there is an angel
[1:05:56] that have both feet upon the sea
[1:05:59] upon the waters everybody clear
[1:06:02] then in revelation 10 7
[1:06:06] we have an angel there which is brother
[1:06:08] branham
[1:06:09] if you have a problem with that after
[1:06:11] all this teaching you see me
[1:06:13] are you there and we call him the seven
[1:06:16] angel over there
[1:06:18] but the problem is they say when these
[1:06:20] seven angels
[1:06:22] sound the trumpet in other words brother
[1:06:25] branham will be
[1:06:26] sending a trumpet everybody clear
[1:06:30] then when you go to revelation 11 we
[1:06:33] found out that there is
[1:06:34] moses and elijah there and we have
[1:06:38] another angel there which have a trumpet
[1:06:41] also
[1:06:42] and that engine over there is called the
[1:06:45] seven
[1:06:46] engine so people attack
[1:06:49] the message saying that this seven angel
[1:06:53] is the same as this seven angel because
[1:06:56] they know clearly
[1:06:58] that this one speak about the jews
[1:07:01] so by saying that they are saying that
[1:07:04] revelation
[1:07:05] 10 belongs to the jews
[1:07:08] and it does not belong to the gentiles
[1:07:12] rejecting the fulfillment of malachi 4
[1:07:15] through brother branham and the
[1:07:17] fulfillment
[1:07:18] also of revelation 10 through brother
[1:07:21] branham
[1:07:22] but we are trying to clarify who is
[1:07:25] this seven angel and here we already
[1:07:28] know
[1:07:29] it's brother branham everybody clear now
[1:07:32] before
[1:07:32] we start with this since we are dealing
[1:07:35] with the last trump
[1:07:37] angel and the great trumpet angel which
[1:07:40] is this angel
[1:07:41] we have two terminology there the first
[1:07:45] one
[1:07:45] is a trump that's donald trump
[1:07:50] the other one is a trumpet now
[1:07:53] what is a trump and what is
[1:07:57] a trumpet everybody clear
[1:08:00] praise the lord when we speak about the
[1:08:03] trumpet
[1:08:04] usually we think about an instrument
[1:08:06] that look like this
[1:08:08] or sometime in our modern day something
[1:08:11] that looked like this
[1:08:13] but a trumpet in the bible does not look
[1:08:16] like that
[1:08:18] this is wrong why brother branham speak
[1:08:21] about the bible he say
[1:08:23] in the oriental it's an oriental book
[1:08:28] we are teaching it in a western way
[1:08:31] and it's an oriental book written
[1:08:35] in the western way and our parable or
[1:08:39] not in the eastern way thank you and our
[1:08:41] parable
[1:08:42] and the things that we teach out of
[1:08:45] there
[1:08:46] sometimes is as far as the east
[1:08:49] from as far as there is from the west of
[1:08:53] being
[1:08:53] right the way we're teaching it
[1:08:56] in our world brother branham is saying
[1:08:58] that this book
[1:09:00] is written under an eastern culture
[1:09:04] but we are trying to interpret that
[1:09:07] according to the western culture
[1:09:11] that's why you need a prophet
[1:09:14] are you there you have to see
[1:09:19] have to go to the country where the book
[1:09:22] was written
[1:09:23] to understand what they mean
[1:09:27] so when they say trumpet it doesn't look
[1:09:29] like that
[1:09:31] a trumpet in the bible look like
[1:09:34] a harm horn everybody there
[1:09:38] so before we get to the armhorn what is
[1:09:42] a trumpet take number chapter 10.
[1:09:54] if we teach this thing quickly you're
[1:09:57] gonna live here you don't understand
[1:09:58] what it means
[1:09:59] and we come back into the same mess over
[1:10:02] again
[1:10:03] number chapter 10 you need to keep your
[1:10:05] bible verse one if you dare you can say
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] and the lord spoke to moses saying make
[1:10:12] you two trumpets of silver of the whole
[1:10:16] piece shall you make them
[1:10:18] that you may use them for the calling of
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:21] assembly so the trumpet are
[1:10:24] used for the calling of the
[1:10:28] assembly everybody's following me
[1:10:32] and for the journey of the camp
[1:10:36] because when israel camp in the
[1:10:38] wilderness
[1:10:40] israel camp like a
[1:10:43] everybody follow me there were the
[1:10:47] tabernacle
[1:10:48] in the middle and on the east
[1:10:52] there were three traps here that were
[1:10:54] camping
[1:10:55] on the north there were three traps here
[1:10:58] that were camping
[1:10:59] on the east three tribes and also
[1:11:02] on the south there were three traps on
[1:11:05] the east
[1:11:06] the banner of the tribe were the lion
[1:11:09] banner
[1:11:11] on the top he was done which was the ego
[1:11:15] this was then and this was jude around
[1:11:18] here
[1:11:19] on the south it was ruined and reuben
[1:11:22] was the main
[1:11:24] banner and on the west side
[1:11:27] it was ephraim and ephraim warhead the
[1:11:30] banner of an
[1:11:31] ox so when they were blowing the trumpet
[1:11:35] in israel
[1:11:36] number one the trumpet were blown to
[1:11:39] gather
[1:11:40] the people together everybody follow me
[1:11:43] then number two it was to give a signal
[1:11:47] for israel to begin to depart it's on
[1:11:50] number 10. you can read the whole
[1:11:52] chapter at home
[1:11:54] so when the trumpet were blowing the
[1:11:57] first time
[1:11:57] israel gathered together but when they
[1:12:00] blow
[1:12:01] an alarm trumpet are you there then the
[1:12:04] first tribe that was moving was
[1:12:06] judah everybody following me
[1:12:10] when you go home read number chapter 10
[1:12:12] the entire bible
[1:12:13] you're gonna find it are you there and
[1:12:16] when they blow
[1:12:17] another trumpet the second tribe that
[1:12:20] move
[1:12:21] was rubbing down here everybody there
[1:12:25] when they continued to blow the third
[1:12:27] one was ephraim
[1:12:29] are you following me when they continue
[1:12:32] to blow
[1:12:33] they last on me that was moving
[1:12:36] was done are you there so
[1:12:40] judah was the first army that was moving
[1:12:43] are you there and the last army that was
[1:12:46] moving was done
[1:12:48] in other words when you see israel
[1:12:50] moving the first
[1:12:52] army is a lion are you there and the
[1:12:55] last
[1:12:56] army is an ego are you there
[1:12:59] remember in joshua there was an army
[1:13:01] before
[1:13:02] and there was also enough me after are
[1:13:05] you there
[1:13:06] so the movement or the moving
[1:13:09] the displacement of israel
[1:13:13] follow the clock
[1:13:17] okay if you put 12 o'clock right here
[1:13:21] you put three o'clock right there you
[1:13:24] have six o'clock there
[1:13:26] and you have nine o'clock there you find
[1:13:29] that the first
[1:13:30] one to move was right here then the
[1:13:33] direction
[1:13:34] followed this way then the direction
[1:13:37] followed this way
[1:13:38] then the direction followed this way in
[1:13:41] other words the
[1:13:42] move of israel is god time
[1:13:46] peace that's why brother branham said if
[1:13:49] you want to know the time
[1:13:51] you need to look at the jews because the
[1:13:54] displacement of israel
[1:13:57] was moving like the clock
[1:14:06] praise the lord i'm trying to find my
[1:14:09] clicker
[1:14:10] it's right here buddy branham
[1:14:14] now notice the trumpet that we are
[1:14:16] speaking of
[1:14:18] is a call together
[1:14:21] for either a feast for war
[1:14:25] for a person some sacred day
[1:14:29] or something like that notice you say
[1:14:32] for a person
[1:14:33] yeah for the year of jubilee of jubilee
[1:14:37] the announcing of the coming of freedom
[1:14:40] when they could go back now
[1:14:42] we could take a complete morning on just
[1:14:45] one that one thing but now getting into
[1:14:49] the trumpet
[1:14:50] you get the background now of the seals
[1:14:52] and the church
[1:14:53] now we are going into the trumpet the
[1:14:56] trumpet sunderland
[1:14:58] and the trumpet did not either a war
[1:15:01] or a feast day or what it means
[1:15:04] is a what gathering together
[1:15:07] of their people you saw that in number
[1:15:10] right the brother branham gives you a
[1:15:12] scripture was he lying
[1:15:15] perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:15:19] the trumpet is to cut together the
[1:15:21] people
[1:15:22] you saw it in the bible assembling
[1:15:26] themselves together
[1:15:27] for something sometimes he announced
[1:15:31] an important person like in joseph
[1:15:36] they sanded the trumpet and joseph was
[1:15:39] appearing
[1:15:40] which is a symbol of the great
[1:15:43] trumpet revelation 11 that we speak of
[1:15:47] and get to after a while in isaiah
[1:15:50] when the great trumpet will be sanded
[1:15:54] and all the nation will gather there is
[1:15:56] always a gathering
[1:15:57] to jerusalem that is when
[1:16:00] the millennium stopped the great what
[1:16:04] trumpet so brother brown i'm saying here
[1:16:06] that the great
[1:16:07] trumpet started the millennium
[1:16:11] what's going on in the seventh seal
[1:16:15] he said everything ran out in this time
[1:16:19] the end of this seventh hill notice
[1:16:22] it's the end of the church ages it's the
[1:16:25] end of
[1:16:26] the seventh hill it is the end of the
[1:16:29] trumpet
[1:16:30] it is the end of the vow and even and
[1:16:33] the ushering
[1:16:34] in of the millennium that is on the
[1:16:37] seventh
[1:16:38] seal it's even the time for all these
[1:16:42] things
[1:16:42] and they are showing in of the
[1:16:45] millennium
[1:16:46] brother branham just said that the great
[1:16:48] trumpet
[1:16:49] asher the millennium here brother
[1:16:52] branham said that
[1:16:53] the sevens here are sure the millennium
[1:16:57] that's why brother branham said that the
[1:16:59] seventh seal to the bride
[1:17:01] is the seventh trumpet to israel
[1:17:06] are you following me i know we're in
[1:17:08] deep order
[1:17:10] notice now joseph before joseph went
[1:17:14] forth
[1:17:15] they had to sound the trumpet first
[1:17:18] and people screamed bowed their knee for
[1:17:20] joseph
[1:17:22] where is this in the bible
[1:17:26] no matter what a man was doing he was
[1:17:29] selling a product on the street
[1:17:31] when that trumpet sound he bowed his
[1:17:34] knee
[1:17:35] a man was just about ready to reach out
[1:17:38] and get his money
[1:17:40] but he bowed his knee joseph was coming
[1:17:43] the mimic was just about to uh just
[1:17:46] about ready to make his act
[1:17:48] and what did he do he had to stop joseph
[1:17:51] is coming
[1:17:52] the trumpet sounded we know in the bible
[1:17:56] that when joseph was coming out the
[1:17:59] trump
[1:18:00] i mean people were bowing down but
[1:18:03] brother branham said not only were
[1:18:05] people
[1:18:05] bowing down but the trumpet was sounding
[1:18:10] where is that in the bible what rana was
[1:18:13] saying
[1:18:14] take genesis chapter 41.
[1:18:19] i will continue to say this and the only
[1:18:22] thing the only purpose i'm saying this
[1:18:24] is when the prophet speaks
[1:18:29] even if you don't see it yet
[1:18:32] just believe and move forward are you
[1:18:35] there
[1:18:36] especially when he's already ventilated
[1:18:41] because the bible says once a prophet
[1:18:43] speaks
[1:18:44] and what he speak happened from there on
[1:18:48] you must listen to him
[1:18:52] when joshua was going around jericho
[1:18:55] he met the angel of the lord with a
[1:18:58] sword
[1:18:59] joshua pulled his sword the angel had
[1:19:03] the revealed soul
[1:19:05] joshua had the written soul
[1:19:09] and he was trying to challenge the
[1:19:11] revealed sword
[1:19:13] by the written sword
[1:19:19] you don't challenge the review word
[1:19:23] by the written word
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:26] this is the arrow the pharisee did
[1:19:30] are you there you must go to the review
[1:19:33] word
[1:19:34] and the review word will show you your
[1:19:36] position
[1:19:37] in the written word
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:44] that's why jesus said go search the
[1:19:46] scripture
[1:19:48] are you there we want the bible we want
[1:19:51] the bible god
[1:19:52] search your bible your bible testify of
[1:19:56] malachi 4
[1:19:57] [Applause]
[1:20:01] are you there when the captain unveiled
[1:20:04] himself
[1:20:05] you know what joshua did he took the
[1:20:08] sword
[1:20:08] he put it down and he bowed his name
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:16] let's go to genesis chapter 41
[1:20:20] moses said moses said paul said paul
[1:20:22] said
[1:20:23] if you have believed moses you will
[1:20:25] believe me
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:27] you don't even understand the bible
[1:20:32] genesis 41 41.
[1:20:37] and pharaoh said to joseph see i have
[1:20:40] set you over all the land of egypt
[1:20:42] and pharaoh took off his wing from his
[1:20:44] hand and put it upon joseph ring we
[1:20:47] talked about the ring and the robber
[1:20:48] there
[1:20:49] and they ran him in the virtue of fine
[1:20:52] lenin
[1:20:53] and put a gold chain about his neck
[1:20:56] and he made him to ride in the second
[1:20:58] chariot
[1:20:59] which he had and they cried before him
[1:21:02] what
[1:21:03] by the knee and he made him ruler over
[1:21:06] all the land of what
[1:21:08] egypt where does he say that a trumpet
[1:21:12] was standing
[1:21:17] brother branham said there was a trumpet
[1:21:19] standing
[1:21:20] then the people by their knee when we
[1:21:22] read the bible he only said that the
[1:21:24] people by their knee
[1:21:26] where is the trumpet
[1:21:31] we need to see it in the bible go to
[1:21:33] psalms 81. even
[1:21:42] the very concept of brother branham it's
[1:21:45] always lined up with the bible
[1:21:51] some anyone if you dare you can say amen
[1:21:57] let's see if brother brother ever give
[1:21:58] you the scripture
[1:22:02] everybody there blow up the trumpet in
[1:22:05] the new moon
[1:22:07] in the time appointed on the solemn fist
[1:22:10] for this was a statute for israel
[1:22:14] and the law of god to jacob what is that
[1:22:17] law
[1:22:18] blowing of what trumpet watch verse five
[1:22:22] this he ordered in who
[1:22:28] did brother branham ever show you this
[1:22:31] when a prophet speak just say
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:38] this was a statute at this he ordained
[1:22:41] in joseph
[1:22:42] for a testimony when he went out through
[1:22:45] the land of what
[1:22:48] where i heard the language that i
[1:22:50] understood
[1:22:52] not so when brother branham said there
[1:22:55] was a trumpet standing
[1:22:56] he knew what he was talking about
[1:23:00] but you want to challenge him by that
[1:23:03] written word
[1:23:07] unbelievable go to exodus chapter 19
[1:23:12] a trumpet calling together a trumpet
[1:23:16] presenting somebody like joseph
[1:23:20] everybody understood that let's go to
[1:23:23] exodus
[1:23:24] chapter 19. everybody should be familiar
[1:23:27] with this
[1:23:29] if you dare you can say amen all right
[1:23:32] the bible said in verse 9 that
[1:23:36] and the lord said to moses lord i come
[1:23:38] to you in a thick cloud
[1:23:40] that the people may hear when i speak
[1:23:43] with you
[1:23:43] and believe you forever
[1:23:47] we believe this message forever
[1:23:51] like a ring forever
[1:23:54] and moses taught the words of the people
[1:23:57] to the lord
[1:23:58] and the lord said to moses god to the
[1:24:00] people and sanctify them today and
[1:24:02] tomorrow
[1:24:03] and let them wash their clothes all the
[1:24:05] people upon mount sana
[1:24:07] and you shall send a set bond to the
[1:24:09] people roundabout
[1:24:11] saying take it to yourself that should
[1:24:13] go not up into the mountain
[1:24:15] or touch the border of it whosoever

[1:27:47] four verse one
[1:27:51] when john saw the vision when he was on
[1:27:54] the earth
[1:27:55] a voice of god came to him and sanded
[1:27:59] when that voice blew it blew like a
[1:28:01] trumpet
[1:28:03] are you there that was on the earth
[1:28:07] in revelation 4 chapter 1 the bible say
[1:28:10] after this
[1:28:11] after the church ages i look and behold
[1:28:14] a door was opened in heaven
[1:28:17] and the first voice which i heard was as
[1:28:20] aware of her so the same voice that
[1:28:24] spoke to john under
[1:28:26] was the same voice that was calling john
[1:28:30] up for the rapture are you there
[1:28:34] are you following me which said come up

[1:28:53] the lord jesus
[1:28:54] and all his holy power the future was
[1:28:57] just about to unfold for god
[1:29:00] for god was about to teach him
[1:29:04] john did not say he was a trumpet he was
[1:29:07] like a
[1:29:08] trumpet now when a trumpet is blown
[1:29:12] he has an urgency about it it's like a
[1:29:15] heron
[1:29:16] the king's messenger coming to the
[1:29:18] people he blows on a trumpet
[1:29:21] it's an urgent call the people gathered
[1:29:23] to listen
[1:29:25] israel was always assembled by the sound
[1:29:28] of a
[1:29:29] trumpet something important is a hand
[1:29:32] listen to it so this voice had the same
[1:29:36] urgency of appeal as did the trumpet
[1:29:39] clear and sound and strong it was
[1:29:42] startling and awakening oh that we might
[1:29:45] hear the voice

[1:31:01] voice that summons the dead dead lazarus
[1:31:05] out of the grave that same voice is of
[1:31:09] the
[1:31:10] archangel remember brother branham was
[1:31:14] irish remember last sunday

[1:31:43] right here
[1:31:44] the church was taken up into heaven
[1:31:47] and john now is brought up with it with
[1:31:50] it
[1:31:50] as a top of the resurrected as we took

[1:31:57] summon him
[1:31:58] to look back on earth revelation 1 10
[1:32:02] was the same voice that summoned him

[1:32:57] that brother evans the voice that said
[1:33:00] turn around the voice that caught you
[1:33:04] out of babylon into this message
[1:33:07] is the same voice that's going to take
[1:33:10] you
[1:33:10] in the rapture
[1:33:15] what a reality clear distinct like a
[1:33:19] trumpet
[1:33:20] turn around serve me after you finish
[1:33:23] serving him
[1:33:24] come up to where i am are you there
[1:33:28] no problem brother bottom says here
[1:33:31] that a trumpet to represent war a seal
[1:33:36] a mystery unfolding and a plague is what
[1:33:40] follows
[1:33:40] every war in other words it follows the
[1:33:43] trumpet
[1:33:44] now and by god's help and with the book
[1:33:47] of history
[1:33:48] i can prove to you that we are living at
[1:33:52] the
[1:33:56] there is seven trumpet in revelation 10.
[1:33:59] there is also seven trumpet in
[1:34:01] revelation 11.
[1:34:04] seven trumpet for the seventh plug
[1:34:07] and the seventh still to be open and the
[1:34:10] seventh vowed to be
[1:34:12] poured out nice job here
[1:34:16] the sounding of the trumpet means gospel
[1:34:19] trumpet that's to the church
[1:34:22] and the standing of a trumpet in the
[1:34:24] bible
[1:34:25] means get ready for scripture
[1:34:30] so israel when a trumpet sounded to him
[1:34:33] he was to get ready for a natural
[1:34:37] war but to us when he signed
[1:34:40] it is to get ready for a scriptural
[1:34:44] world
[1:34:48] are you getting it down scripture
[1:34:51] world paul said if you want to put it
[1:34:54] down
[1:34:55] first corinthians 14 8 paul say if the
[1:34:58] trumpet gives her
[1:35:01] certain son how will a man know what to
[1:35:03] prepare for
[1:35:05] if he does not have a scriptural
[1:35:08] son vindicated
[1:35:12] vindication of the word of god made
[1:35:15] manifest
[1:35:17] how will we know we are in the end time
[1:35:21] take jeremiah ford
[1:35:28] we cannot rush with this
[1:35:33] you heard trump a trumpet trumpet
[1:35:35] trumpet
[1:35:37] jeremiah 4 verse 19
[1:35:40] if you dare you can say amen
[1:35:43] everybody there my power my bowel
[1:35:48] i am panicked at my very heart my heart
[1:35:51] making noise in me
[1:35:53] i cannot hold my peace because you have
[1:35:56] heard all my soul
[1:35:57] the sound of what few people
[1:36:02] are you there because you have heard the
[1:36:04] sound of the
[1:36:07] command the alarm of what so when
[1:36:10] brother branham said
[1:36:11] trumpet mean to all did he give you the
[1:36:14] scripture
[1:36:18] when the prophet speak open your ears
[1:36:21] and listen are you there clear here in
[1:36:25] the bible
[1:36:25] and clearly in the message the bible say
[1:36:29] brother branham say
[1:36:32] are you there
[1:36:36] first corinthians 14 paul said that if a
[1:36:39] trumpet gives
[1:36:40] her an uncertain son who shall prepare
[1:36:43] are you there so brother branham just
[1:36:45] told us that that was a
[1:36:47] spiritual world
[1:36:52] all right now and then
[1:36:55] because the trumpet sounds at the same
[1:36:58] time the seals
[1:36:59] it's just the same thing the church ages
[1:37:03] just the same thing now a trumpet always
[1:37:06] did not
[1:37:07] work we saw it otherwise political
[1:37:12] disturbance so when you see war
[1:37:16] it is trumpet standing but those war
[1:37:20] must be connected to israel
[1:37:24] i'm going slowly
[1:37:27] the trumpet does a political disturbance
[1:37:30] and that causes war when you go to
[1:37:33] messing in politics
[1:37:35] and get all them messed up like we
[1:37:38] gathered now
[1:37:39] look at worries at hand but see
[1:37:42] because the kingdom belongs still belong
[1:37:44] to
[1:37:45] satan all right the trumpet means
[1:37:49] political
[1:37:50] disturbance world matthew 24 jesus spoke
[1:37:54] of
[1:37:54] you shall hear war and rumors of
[1:37:58] war all the way down through it was
[1:38:01] rumors or wars and rumors and wars
[1:38:04] and plum on down to the end now that is
[1:38:07] trumpet
[1:38:08] standing not every war
[1:38:12] is a trumpet that war must be connected
[1:38:15] to
[1:38:16] israel we shall go back there and pick
[1:38:20] up each one of them wars
[1:38:22] and show you that follow them churches
[1:38:25] show you they follow this
[1:38:26] seal to save time
[1:38:30] now wins the four wins in the bible
[1:38:34] means war and
[1:38:38] 11 years 11 months 11 this 11 this
[1:38:41] the first world war right like in jobs
[1:38:45] time you remember winds came down and
[1:38:47] took the sun
[1:38:48] and you know what it means it's trouble
[1:38:51] on the fork
[1:38:52] on four corners of the earth holding the
[1:38:54] four wings speaking about the angels
[1:38:57] in other words here went the wings
[1:39:00] blowing in the walls and stuff
[1:39:03] that come all over the world when did
[1:39:07] that ever happen
[1:39:08] never until the first world
[1:39:12] war so when you see the first world war
[1:39:15] striking cleaning up the land of israel
[1:39:19] the second world war striking mussolini
[1:39:22] italy
[1:39:23] killing the jewish people though i
[1:39:26] trumpet
[1:39:26] something
[1:39:30] but he hits israel naturally
[1:39:36] everybody there now those trumpets were
[1:39:40] made of her ramshorn
[1:39:43] and rhymes if you look at that we spoke
[1:39:46] in the zodiac of aries
[1:39:48] you should be comfortable with the
[1:39:50] zodiac here
[1:39:51] he spoke of the depths of rem a way
[1:39:55] must be killed and deliver his own
[1:39:58] are you there and we know that jesus was
[1:40:02] the realm of god
[1:40:03] that came and was killed at the cross
[1:40:06] what does a ram means and what has a a
[1:40:10] horn means
[1:40:11] notice there is seven horns on this lamp
[1:40:14] did you notice it
[1:40:15] having seven holes we've been just
[1:40:18] through that
[1:40:18] horns means what
[1:40:22] to the animal job down here
[1:40:25] a ram he had to be a ship
[1:40:29] a man a ram type of who
[1:40:32] so a rams speak of
[1:40:36] the power of christ
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:41] take romans chapter one
[1:40:53] i prayed god at home that he won't be
[1:40:55] tedious
[1:40:59] romans chapter 1 verse 18. if you dare
[1:41:01] you can say amen
[1:41:03] are you there every time you come to
[1:41:06] church make sure you get your bible
[1:41:09] romans 1 verse 18
[1:41:12] for the wrath of god
[1:41:17] let me see 16 okay thank you for i am
[1:41:20] not
[1:41:20] a shame of the gospel of what
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:26] okay for it is
[1:41:30] that the power of god
[1:41:34] are you there so the power of
[1:41:37] god is the gospel of
[1:41:40] jesus christ and the trumpet
[1:41:43] were made out of ram horns which is the
[1:41:47] power of
[1:41:48] christ so the trumpet is
[1:41:51] a gospel trumpet
[1:41:57] what a brand i've never explained you he
[1:41:58] was in the bible
[1:42:00] take first corinthians chapter one
[1:42:07] sooner we're going to navigate and move
[1:42:09] on
[1:42:13] first corinthians chapter one if you're
[1:42:15] there you can say amen
[1:42:16] verse 18 for the preaching of the
[1:42:21] the cross speak of the depths of the
[1:42:24] realm
[1:42:26] remember the cross means the ram christ
[1:42:30] is killed you see that
[1:42:33] and the horn is released
[1:42:36] so the preaching of the cross
[1:42:40] are you there is to them that perish
[1:42:43] foolishness
[1:42:45] but to us with yourself it is the power
[1:42:48] of god amen everybody clear
[1:42:53] jump to verse 24.
[1:42:57] but to them that are called both jew
[1:43:01] and greek crushed their power off
[1:43:05] so the rams on spoke of
[1:43:08] the power of christ which is the gospel
[1:43:12] that's why brother branham said a
[1:43:14] trumpet means
[1:43:16] god's spell
[1:43:19] we clear all right now
[1:43:22] when a trumpet blast
[1:43:26] everybody here the noise of the trumpet
[1:43:30] is called a trump
[1:43:36] a trumpet is an instrument
[1:43:40] that trump is the sound of the voice
[1:43:44] of the trumpet
[1:43:48] take first corinthians right there verse
[1:43:50] chapter 15
[1:43:56] if you dare you can say amen
[1:43:59] verse 51
[1:44:03] are you there behold i show you a
[1:44:07] mystery
[1:44:08] we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:44:11] all should be changed in a moment
[1:44:15] in the tweaking of an eye at the last
[1:44:19] if you say the last trump
[1:44:22] that means that they were reviews trumps
[1:44:27] so somebody bloom somebody blew
[1:44:30] somebody blue then the last trump you
[1:44:33] cannot have
[1:44:34] lust without first
[1:44:38] but god emphasized about the
[1:44:41] resurrection
[1:44:42] that is connected only to the last
[1:44:46] trump
[1:44:50] when he shall begin to
[1:44:56] are you are you there take first
[1:44:59] thessalonians 4.
[1:45:08] same thing over again if you're there
[1:45:10] you can say amen we're going to score
[1:45:11] sooner
[1:45:12] chris alone in chapter 4 verse 16. are
[1:45:14] you there
[1:45:17] for the lord himself shall be sent from
[1:45:19] heaven
[1:45:20] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:45:23] archangel
[1:45:24] with the what everybody clear
[1:45:29] everybody here so that trump of god
[1:45:32] is always connected to the resurrection
[1:45:36] and we know first thessalonians 4
[1:45:39] happened in our day when the mighty
[1:45:42] engine came down
[1:45:44] with a shot with a voice and a champ
[1:45:47] off
[1:45:50] but if you remember in jericho there
[1:45:53] were seven priests
[1:45:55] going with also trumpet
[1:46:01] now it's clear right in jericho
[1:46:06] we found out that the city of jericho
[1:46:09] god told israel when you get into that
[1:46:12] city
[1:46:13] pick up four medals for me
[1:46:16] are you there you take gold

[1:46:40] you there
[1:46:41] and those kingdoms were the world
[1:46:44] kingdom
[1:46:45] but they all fall were found in jericho

[1:47:06] middle person brush grease iron
[1:47:09] and in the bottom iron mixed with clay
[1:47:12] branham
[1:47:14] we could go back to daniel and get the
[1:47:16] image
[1:47:18] look at the image the head of gold the
[1:47:20] babylonian kingdom
[1:47:22] brass silver meadows and persian
[1:47:26] brass alexander the great which is greek
[1:47:29] and so forth the grecian
[1:47:30] kingdom then the roman empire eastern
[1:47:34] and west rome
[1:47:35] the two feet down here there was iron
[1:47:38] and clay mixed together
[1:47:40] and that iron come from the legs which
[1:47:42] was wrong
[1:47:44] and there is a church so we
[1:47:47] found out here that the four

[1:50:28] and his mouth as the mouth of her
[1:50:31] so here john saw those three
[1:50:35] separate beasts mixed together into one
[1:50:39] remember when we went through the seal
[1:50:41] we have the white horse rather
[1:50:44] than the red then the black but the
[1:50:47] pearl horse
[1:50:48] was a mixture of the tree
[1:50:53] are you there brother branham the dragon
[1:50:57] we got two things under consideration
[1:50:59] now watch this beast
[1:51:01] he had four different characters in it
[1:51:04] if you shall take daniel 7 which we went
[1:51:07] through
[1:51:08] you the marking down daniel 7 daniel saw
[1:51:11] the same
[1:51:13] vision 800 years before

[1:51:23] beginning of the gentile
[1:51:25] ruling are you there john
[1:51:28] seeing it at the end of the gentile
[1:51:32] ruling all four beasts represented in

[1:51:40] here
[1:51:41] is the top of the end time
[1:51:44] of the gentiles are you there
[1:51:48] where the four kingdoms are gathered
[1:51:51] together
[1:51:52] in one place you're following me
[1:51:56] let me skip that one now when aiken
[1:51:59] stole the stuff in the camp
[1:52:02] they can stop three things but one of
[1:52:05] them
[1:52:06] was a babylonian government you can
[1:52:09] check your scripture yourself
[1:52:11] what i'm trying to point out here is
[1:52:14] jericho
[1:52:15] represent the end time under rome
[1:52:19] dominion
[1:52:22] everybody clear where are we going on
[1:52:25] so we have a pattern now
[1:52:28] when they're still broke in heaven
[1:52:32] a thunder is revealed
[1:52:35] are you following me this standard
[1:52:38] contain a message that
[1:52:42] the messenger of the edge comes
[1:52:45] and catches the revelation and he blows
[1:52:49] the trumpet
[1:52:50] everybody there when he blows the
[1:52:53] trumpet
[1:52:54] that trump at his gospel trumpet he
[1:52:58] declares
[1:52:59] war we follow me
[1:53:03] war between the children of god
[1:53:06] and the children of satan it is a
[1:53:09] scriptural
[1:53:10] world now we get it there
[1:53:13] then god will send his anointing
[1:53:17] are you there to anoint his children
[1:53:20] and the devil also will send his
[1:53:23] anointing
[1:53:24] to anoint his camp when god
[1:53:27] finished his message his children will
[1:53:30] which are the wheat
[1:53:31] and they are the children which are
[1:53:33] details god gather his children together
[1:53:36] and take them away and he drop a plug
[1:53:40] on the other one or a file what i'm
[1:53:43] trying for you to remember is
[1:53:45] a plug is dropped upon those that
[1:53:48] rejected
[1:53:49] the message
[1:53:53] where do you get this stuff
[1:53:56] here is the plan of it the first thing
[1:53:59] happened
[1:54:00] there is an announcement in heaven first
[1:54:03] what happened
[1:54:04] a seal is open what is it
[1:54:07] a mysteries are for and when a mystery
[1:54:10] unfold
[1:54:11] then a trumpet sound he declared
[1:54:15] whoa a plug fall and the church
[1:54:19] opened you've seen where i stand
[1:54:22] i usually make my slide according to
[1:54:24] brother branham
[1:54:26] what is the war part the angel of the
[1:54:28] church catches the mystery of god
[1:54:31] not fully yet revealed
[1:54:35] that's why paul said i preached in
[1:54:38] part all messenger part
[1:54:42] part part part but at the last time
[1:54:47] elijah must come and we stole our own
[1:54:51] things
[1:54:53] are you there he catches the mystery of
[1:54:56] god
[1:54:57] then he goes forth to the people after
[1:54:59] the mystery has been given to him
[1:55:01] goes forth to the people what does he do
[1:55:04] out there
[1:55:04] he begins to proclaim that message and
[1:55:07] what does he start
[1:55:08] a war a spiritual war
[1:55:12] and then god take his messenger with the
[1:55:15] elect
[1:55:15] of that age lay them away asleep and
[1:55:18] then he dropped the plug upon those who
[1:55:20] rejected
[1:55:21] a temporary judgment then after that is
[1:55:24] over
[1:55:25] then he goes the denominator and
[1:55:27] bringing the nomination
[1:55:30] by the brandon sales deal with religious
[1:55:33] disturbance
[1:55:35] a seal is open a message is dropped and
[1:55:37] when that will message
[1:55:39] drop down their message that messenger
[1:55:42] goes forth
[1:55:43] and shake them to pieces that's why it's
[1:55:45] a religious despair
[1:55:47] the disturbance when a seal is open
[1:55:50] that's what happened
[1:55:51] the first messenger and he preached and
[1:55:54] a trumpet standing
[1:55:55] the trumpet was declaring war trumpet
[1:55:58] always did not work
[1:56:00] the messenger the engine come on earth

[1:56:15] and the messenger dies and it still
[1:56:18] awaits
[1:56:18] this group they put it in a plaque fall
[1:56:21] upon those who
[1:56:22] rejected plague fall upon those who
[1:56:26] rejected paul was the first messenger
[1:56:29] when the first trumpet standed and the
[1:56:32] first seal was told lose
[1:56:34] paul was the first messenger as we found
[1:56:37] out
[1:56:38] declared war the orthodox church for not
[1:56:41] believing
[1:56:42] the messianic son that jesus had
[1:56:44] produced to them
[1:56:46] he blasted those synagogues from place
[1:56:49] to places
[1:56:50] with the scripture and was put out of
[1:56:53] every one of them
[1:56:55] till finally he shook the dust from off
[1:56:58] his
[1:56:58] feet and turned to the gentile what is
[1:57:01] it
[1:57:02] standing off shopping an angel
[1:57:05] messenger standing there with the word
[1:57:09] don't you miss that now the word
[1:57:13] and paul with the are not an adulterated
[1:57:16] interpretation of god's word
[1:57:18] blasted every one of them synagogue
[1:57:21] everybody clear okay until he come to
[1:57:25] the last angel
[1:57:28] so there was a first trumpet by paul
[1:57:32] a second trumpet arenas a third trumpet
[1:57:35] columba
[1:57:36] then it goes all the way to the last
[1:57:39] shopping until he comes to the last
[1:57:43] trumpet
[1:57:43] now he had no certain mysteries
[1:57:48] how was this
[1:57:51] justification period wesley
[1:57:55] sanctification period pentecost
[1:57:58] restoration of this period but the seven
[1:58:01] ninja
[1:58:02] you cannot stop him in one thing
[1:58:11] he gathered up all that has been lost
[1:58:15] in their middle ages all the truth that
[1:58:18] was not
[1:58:19] truly revealed yet because they all
[1:58:22] preach in part
[1:58:24] as the revelation come then we reveal
[1:58:27] those things
[1:58:28] in his day revelation 10 1-4
[1:58:32] text the book and seal and break them
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:35] show the seven angel for this alone
[1:58:38] not everybody else the mystery of god is
[1:58:41] the ministry of the seven

[1:58:58] in the days of the seven angel
[1:59:02] he's standing forth blasting forth the
[1:59:05] gospel
[1:59:06] trumpet not the jewish one
[1:59:11] this is poor upon those that reject
[1:59:15] the message what are you trying to say
[1:59:18] in revelation 5 verse 6 the bible said
[1:59:22] that there is a ram there
[1:59:23] you can look at that at home they say
[1:59:26] that the ram
[1:59:28] have seven ohms
[1:59:32] and those horns have seven eyes
[1:59:36] what does the horn represent
[1:59:41] seven ohms was the seven
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:49] the seven church ages because that was
[1:59:52] the lamb's
[1:59:53] protection what he protected his right
[1:59:56] with for nerf
[1:59:58] was god said group of people that
[2:00:01] protected
[2:00:02] seven eyes are the seventh
[2:00:05] messenger of the seven churches

[2:00:35] you remember the two sticks there is a
[2:00:38] cross right there
[2:00:39] are you there which is the dispensation
[2:00:42] of the
[2:00:43] seven church angel with what seven eyes
[2:00:46] which are there
[2:00:49] that's why in jericho
[2:00:52] are you there there were seven priests
[2:00:55] blowing
[2:00:56] seven trumpets
[2:01:00] are we clear together now brother
[2:01:03] branham said
[2:01:04] that the seven homes represent
[2:01:08] the seven churches in other words
[2:01:11] every horns was a church
[2:01:14] but are you ready
[2:01:17] the trumpet also
[2:01:20] was a horn
[2:01:25] in other words the church the true
[2:01:29] brother
[2:01:30] is the horn of the messenger
[2:01:33] made flesh
[2:01:38] what are you saying
[2:01:42] it's god manifested in flesh
[2:01:46] now in the flesh of his brother
[2:01:49] for the bread and the husband is the
[2:01:52] same self
[2:01:53] flesh these two are
[2:01:57] and the church is becoming the bread
[2:02:01] all the time by believing that
[2:02:06] as you receive the message you become
[2:02:09] the message
[2:02:13] you are what you eat
[2:02:18] are you there we see the bride uniting
[2:02:22] uniting with the word why the word is

[2:03:04] he come because he was the word
[2:03:07] and you become the word you become the
[2:03:10] word

[2:03:46] the front of me was
[2:03:48] judah are you there and judah was a lion
[2:03:52] and the last time it was done which was
[2:03:56] an ego and the first messenger was paul
[2:03:59] under the lion anointing and the last
[2:04:02] one was brother brown up
[2:04:04] under the ego and nothing

[2:04:21] times
[2:04:22] to pick up everything that paul left
[2:04:25] that we are in this level
[2:04:27] that colombia and gather everything
[2:04:30] together

[2:05:48] but they have to be another army at the
[2:05:51] end time
[2:05:52] that must come again that's why there
[2:05:54] was an army
[2:05:55] and the army paul
[2:05:59] and brother branham they're two prophets
[2:06:02] moses and elijah

[2:06:23] germany and so forth each one wearing
[2:06:25] that kind of garb all the way
[2:06:27] all along here just exactly like them
[2:06:30] first one and here they were coming
[2:06:33] onward christian

[2:06:38] they are marching around jericho onward
[2:06:41] christian soldier only soldiers
[2:06:44] the soldier of paul but the last hero
[2:06:47] guard
[2:06:48] is the ego he's dead are you there
[2:06:51] but when those of paul went they only
[2:06:54] turn around behind brother branham
[2:06:56] but when the second group come brother
[2:06:59] branham said they start to going right
[2:07:01] into the

[2:07:06] that's going to initiate
[2:07:07] the rapture
[2:07:11] are you there what is wrong
[2:07:14] with this trumpet let's go to revelation
[2:07:18] 8 and we're going to drop sooner
[2:07:25] revelation eight

[2:07:50] seven times
[2:07:51] you gotta go around the city and then
[2:07:53] the wall of babylon
[2:07:55] are broken so this message was built to
[2:07:58] destroy the nomination
[2:08:00] when you start building denomination
[2:08:02] around this message
[2:08:04] you make it even more powerful because
[2:08:07] he was built to entire denomination
[2:08:10] are you there czech revelation chapter

[2:09:00] hell and fire
[2:09:01] mingling with blood and they were cast
[2:09:05] upon the
[2:09:06] earth so the first trumpet affected the
[2:09:10] earth
[2:09:11] everybody clear on my board clear there
[2:09:16] jump to verse 8. and the second
[2:09:20] angel sounded anywhere as a great

[2:15:14] into the air
[2:15:16] and there came a great voice out of thee
[2:15:20] from the saying it is
[2:15:27] the trumpet are reflecting
[2:15:31] the vow
[2:15:34] are you there but we know that devours
[2:15:38] our gentle judgment
[2:15:41] when the seal broke a thunder is
[2:15:45] revealed
[2:15:46] a messenger come he pick up the thunder
[2:15:50] blow the trumpet called the elect of god
[2:15:53] those who rejected the message evaluates
[2:15:58] why are the gentile judgment
[2:16:02] reflecting the jewish calling
[2:16:09] why take galatians 3.
[2:16:18] so today you know the difference that
[2:16:21] revelation
[2:16:22] 10 7 belongs to the gentile
[2:16:26] and that seven angel of revelation 11
[2:16:29] is not for the gentile let's go to
[2:16:32] galatians 3
[2:16:33] and then we're going to drop at the
[2:16:34] airport if you dare
[2:16:36] you can say amen galatians 3 3 verse 10
[2:16:41] for as many as are of the work of the
[2:16:47] i'm waiting for somebody who are still
[2:16:49] working on me
[2:16:51] are you there for as many
[2:16:55] as out there of the work of the
[2:16:58] are under there
[2:17:02] god came to monsanto and
[2:17:05] gave israel opportunity to receive the
[2:17:09] grace of god
[2:17:10] are you there israel rejected and said
[2:17:14] ah
[2:17:15] we want the law and matter of fact when
[2:17:18] you talk to us
[2:17:19] always use a prophet
[2:17:23] and when the law came he put israel
[2:17:27] under a curse are you there
[2:17:30] and the curse for it is written curses
[2:17:34] everyone that continues not
[2:17:36] in all which are written in the book of
[2:17:38] the law
[2:17:40] but that no man is justified by the law
[2:17:43] in the sight of god it is evident for
[2:17:46] the judge shall live by
[2:17:48] faith and the law is not of faith but
[2:17:51] the man that does them shall live in
[2:17:53] them
[2:17:54] christ has redeemed from the
[2:17:57] curse of the law so when christ was
[2:17:59] coming he was coming to remove the curse
[2:18:02] of the law
[2:18:03] but israel rejected christ
[2:18:07] are you there from the curse of the law
[2:18:10] being made a curse for us the sixth seal
[2:18:14] he made the cross you remember for it is
[2:18:18] written
[2:18:18] curses everyone that is hanging on a
[2:18:21] tree
[2:18:23] so those that are under the law are
[2:18:24] under earth
[2:18:26] curse now let's go to matthew 27.
[2:18:31] this is where we're gonna see why is god
[2:18:34] talking to israel in judgment
[2:18:39] are you there once god sends a message
[2:18:42] if you reject the message of god
[2:18:46] god don't talk to you anymore by grace
[2:18:51] he talk to you by whooping
[2:18:57] are you there go turn the water off
[2:19:01] if you go do it no problem
[2:19:04] if you say ah then daddy pulled the belt
[2:19:09] the belt is love but it is
[2:19:13] a language that is painful
[2:19:16] bringing you into obedience to what you
[2:19:19] rejected
[2:19:23] matthew 27 verse 20.
[2:19:30] you don't pay your tax no problem
[2:19:33] he pulled the belt car broken down
[2:19:38] supervisor angry at you you turn around
[2:19:42] kids sick when you learn that language
[2:19:45] the first thing tight
[2:19:50] he's bringing you to the same thing but
[2:19:53] by whooping
[2:19:58] are you there verse 20 he's preaching on
[2:20:01] top
[2:20:02] they go to the church building
[2:20:09] verse 26 chapter 27 verse 20. but the
[2:20:16] chief priests
[2:20:17] and the elders persuaded the multitude
[2:20:21] that they should ask for who and destroy
[2:20:24] who
[2:20:25] these are the jews doing that they go
[2:20:28] from the answered
[2:20:30] and said to them whether of the two were
[2:20:32] you
[2:20:33] that are released to you they say
[2:20:35] barabbas he was a murderer
[2:20:37] pilate said to them what shall i do then
[2:20:40] with jesus which is called
[2:20:41] cross they all say to him
[2:20:44] let him be crucified
[2:20:48] and the governor said why in other words
[2:20:50] they are still
[2:20:51] pleading with israel are you there
[2:20:54] why what evil have he done but they
[2:20:58] cry lord the most saying let him be
[2:21:01] crucified so god is pulling block
[2:21:05] he spoke to the wife of palette and the
[2:21:08] wife of pilate came
[2:21:10] and said don't play around with this man
[2:21:12] and pilate politically
[2:21:14] is playing to stop them still israel is
[2:21:18] attacking
[2:21:19] attacking who the messiah
[2:21:23] are you there when pilate saw
[2:21:27] that he could not prevail nothing
[2:21:30] but that rather the turmeric was made he
[2:21:33] took water
[2:21:34] and washed his hand before the multitude
[2:21:36] saying i am innocent of the blood of
[2:21:38] this judgment
[2:21:39] see you to him watch now then
[2:21:42] answer some of the people
[2:21:47] all the people and say his blood
[2:21:51] be upon us and upon our
[2:21:55] in other words willfully israel say
[2:21:58] curse us
[2:22:03] i send the messiah the lord your god
[2:22:06] will send you a prophet
[2:22:08] like unto me john the baptist came and
[2:22:11] present the messiah
[2:22:13] israel said kill him israel
[2:22:16] rejected the messiah
[2:22:23] now listen close let's turn to matthew
[2:22:26] 24
[2:22:28] and here is where israel made the
[2:22:31] federal mistake here is where she done
[2:22:35] here
[2:22:38] so israel rejected god no problem
[2:22:41] god sent judges rejected no problem
[2:22:44] because jesus was giving the pharisee a
[2:22:48] parable
[2:22:49] he says that there was a man that owned
[2:22:51] a vine
[2:22:53] and he left the vine to some people and
[2:22:56] he began to send them
[2:22:57] servant do you know that parable when he
[2:23:00] sent the first debate him
[2:23:02] send the second they kill him send the
[2:23:04] third and men
[2:23:05] say let me send my only son
[2:23:09] maybe when they see him they will listen
[2:23:12] when they send they say oh
[2:23:13] the air is coming let's do what
[2:23:17] jerusalem jerusalem
[2:23:19] how many times have i tried to hover you
[2:23:23] as a hand but you would not you the one
[2:23:26] that killed the
[2:23:28] prophet and i sent you myself
[2:23:32] for the last time the last hope
[2:23:36] you destroyed that's why brother branham
[2:23:38] said the
[2:23:39] last sin and the reason she is in the
[2:23:43] condition
[2:23:44] today matthew 27
[2:23:47] verse 25 that's the reason why
[2:23:52] deval is speaking
[2:23:55] to israel that's why god
[2:23:58] is speaking to the jewish true
[2:24:02] whooping because they are under
[2:24:05] a curse he's not going to come and
[2:24:09] preach to the jewish
[2:24:10] he just anointed italy italy kill them
[2:24:14] and bring them to the promised land
[2:24:16] until that curse
[2:24:18] is removed and that curse will be
[2:24:21] removed
[2:24:23] under the last angel
[2:24:26] which is the spirit of grace
[2:24:29] going to israel to remove the
[2:24:32] ungodliness from jacob
[2:24:35] are you there the brother of joseph
[2:24:38] sold him and joseph went to egypt
[2:24:42] and marry a gentle wife and god
[2:24:46] turned farming on and famine
[2:24:50] was what brought the brother of
[2:24:53] joseph back to him
[2:24:56] but benjamin was born after
[2:25:00] benjamin was innocent of the sin
[2:25:05] but the crop of joseph
[2:25:08] was put in benjamin he was
[2:25:11] blamed for something he did not do
[2:25:15] that's why zachariah said they will ask
[2:25:17] him
[2:25:18] where did you get this wound we were not
[2:25:21] there he said in the house of my friend
[2:25:25] he took the cup in benjamin to bring
[2:25:28] them
[2:25:29] but before joseph revealed to his
[2:25:32] brother
[2:25:32] he told his brother get out of here
[2:25:36] are you there because at the beginning
[2:25:38] he was talking to them through
[2:25:40] interpret and brother branham said a
[2:25:43] prophet
[2:25:44] is an interpreter of the world
[2:25:48] he will talk to them first through moses
[2:25:51] and elijah interpreted are you there
[2:25:55] when naomi left the promised land
[2:25:58] his her husband died children died
[2:26:01] trumpet standing whooping naomi
[2:26:05] and when naomi found out that there's no
[2:26:08] way
[2:26:08] she begins to go back and suffering
[2:26:11] as she go back roof
[2:26:14] is behind there are you there are you
[2:26:17] there
[2:26:18] that's why revelation 10 hooked
[2:26:21] between revelation 11 roof
[2:26:24] stepping when they got to israel
[2:26:27] instead of powers being attracted to
[2:26:30] naomi
[2:26:31] which they are blood family the eyes of
[2:26:35] god
[2:26:36] left revelation 11 he began to look at
[2:26:38] that woman saying she looked good
[2:26:40] he went to the gentle woman that's why
[2:26:44] revelation
[2:26:45] 10 is before revelation 11
[2:26:52] are you there it's a language
[2:26:55] to the jews to us
[2:26:58] it is the vow he's talking to them
[2:27:02] as a vow because they rejected the
[2:27:05] messiah
[2:27:06] this trumpet standing is not for the
[2:27:09] gentile
[2:27:10] for the jews our trumpet is our seventh
[2:27:14] messenger
[2:27:15] that goes around jericho what are we
[2:27:17] talking about
[2:27:18] in revelation 10 there is
[2:27:22] a cloud that came down this cloud was
[2:27:24] made of seven angel
[2:27:26] are you there on the earth it was enough
[2:27:30] free angel
[2:27:31] are you there i have to sound the
[2:27:33] trumpet
[2:27:35] among those seven angels one of them
[2:27:38] was the mighty angel in revelation
[2:27:41] 11 there is a seven ninja off the
[2:27:44] trumpet of the jews
[2:27:47] are you there and that angel also have
[2:27:51] two men these are human they are earthly
[2:27:55] this i'm gonna skip those scriptures
[2:27:57] these are human
[2:27:58] they are earthly men this engine is not
[2:28:01] human
[2:28:03] are you there he's a heavenly angel this
[2:28:06] is a heavenly angel
[2:28:08] this is a human ninja this is a heavenly
[2:28:10] angel
[2:28:11] this is a human angel if you look here
[2:28:14] there is one
[2:28:15] and one here there is one and two
[2:28:19] in the book of daniel there was one and
[2:28:22] two
[2:28:23] are you there what are you saying
[2:28:26] heavenly
[2:28:26] earthly one of the seven ninja
[2:28:29] was one over there he was crossed
[2:28:32] the one with the seven still that was
[2:28:35] bursting his
[2:28:36] chest like this that's why brother
[2:28:37] branham say all the six were familiar
[2:28:41] in other words i already know what paul
[2:28:42] preached i already know what aren't you
[2:28:45] spiritual
[2:28:45] i already know what columba preached i
[2:28:47] already know what luther preached
[2:28:49] i already know whatever pentecostal
[2:28:52] saying
[2:28:53] i just need something different than him
[2:28:55] when he look he see one
[2:28:56] looking at him right there but what i'm
[2:28:58] saying that's the stuff i was looking
[2:29:00] for all my life
[2:29:02] that was the one week there seven still
[2:29:05] are you there and these angels also
[2:29:08] are seven we just saw them with seven
[2:29:11] trumpets
[2:29:13] these also were seven one of them were
[2:29:16] crossed
[2:29:17] these are seven one of them have a big
[2:29:20] trumpet
[2:29:21] but he worked with two men he bring you
[2:29:24] to daniel 12
[2:29:25] where there is one angel who work with
[2:29:28] two men
[2:29:29] if you look there is a river one man is
[2:29:32] on this side
[2:29:33] one is on this side if you remember
[2:29:37] you ready elijah cross jordan
[2:29:41] do you remember he hit the mountain and
[2:29:43] crossed jordan
[2:29:45] moses never crossed jordan he stayed
[2:29:47] outside of the promised land
[2:29:49] that's why one angel is there and
[2:29:51] another angel is there
[2:29:53] are you there are you there in
[2:29:55] revelation 10 when
[2:29:56] when that engine came down one foot on

[2:33:03] promised land but
[2:33:04] under whooping because israel rejected
[2:33:07] the messiah
[2:33:08] god would talk to them through judgment
[2:33:11] he will always
[2:33:12] anoint whooping until the last one i
[2:33:15] will open a fountain
[2:33:16] in the house of david and i will drop
[2:33:19] the spirit of
[2:33:20] grace upon the house of david to do what
[2:33:22] the six-fold purpose of
[2:33:24] daniel to remove the transgression
[2:33:27] ungodliness
[2:33:28] from israel then the eyes of the jews
[2:33:30] will wake up
[2:33:31] like what did we do you killed the
[2:33:33] messiah
[2:33:34] are you there but he would tell them
[2:33:36] don't do it you have to do it to save
[2:33:38] the
[2:33:39] gentile i have to go joseph have to be
[2:33:42] sold
[2:33:42] to save everybody are you there you did
[2:33:45] it you were blind
[2:33:46] that's why they are souls under the
[2:33:48] altar waiting for the hundred and forty
[2:33:50] four thousand to receive
[2:33:52] the holy ghost are you there
[2:33:55] and the cells under the altar need the

[2:34:22] heavenly father lord we thank you for
[2:34:25] your grace you love your mercy

[2:34:29] able to finish this sermon
[2:34:31] but by your grace father you answer my
[2:34:33] prayer
[2:34:34] and you open up the doors that this can
[2:34:36] be established from this church
[2:34:38] father if there is any question there
[2:34:40] should be an answer
[2:34:42] a question was lord father brought to
[2:34:44] this church
[2:34:45] and we know how the devil is attacking
[2:34:47] lord father every kind of way
[2:34:50] but you spoke to us through the prophet
[2:34:52] that the only way
[2:34:53] you defeated the devil lord father when
[2:34:55] he attacked you
[2:34:56] was by the word that's why we gave the
[2:34:59] word to your people
[2:35:00] because when the devil attacked you you
[2:35:02] always say it is written
[2:35:03] it is written it is written you went
[2:35:06] back to the word to show that
[2:35:07] any christian when they can cling to
[2:35:09] your word lord
[2:35:10] father they can defeat the devil
[2:35:12] anywhere any place

[2:35:21] and they understand lord because you say
[2:35:24] when the foundation are shaken
[2:35:26] what will they just do that's why we
[2:35:28] went back to the foundation
[2:35:30] explaining showing clearly the
[2:35:32] difference between this angel
[2:35:34] and i know that you the holy ghost you
[2:35:36] can lord unfold this beyond what we even

[2:35:42] be merciful to us
[2:35:43] lord may nobody lord father fall under
[2:35:46] the whooping
[2:35:47] but may we be children of god and the
[2:35:49] obedience lord
[2:35:51] that when you speak we listen lord we
[2:35:53] don't want to go through the hard hand
[2:35:55] lord

[2:35:58] jews were being cremated
[2:36:00] but lord your prophet said that he was
[2:36:02] the tender
[2:36:03] hand of man of jehovah how can that be a
[2:36:06] tender hand
[2:36:07] it was you through love of a father
[2:36:10] rebuking your son by just
[2:36:12] trying to bring him back to where he can
[2:36:14] get redemption
[2:36:15] even the prophet in the old testament
[2:36:17] whenever somebody was dying
[2:36:19] they always requested to be buried in
[2:36:22] the promised land
[2:36:23] because they knew that the messiah come
[2:36:25] and this end time lord father
[2:36:27] you knew that israel was scar the lord
[2:36:30] you didn't want to leave them out of the
[2:36:31] promised land
