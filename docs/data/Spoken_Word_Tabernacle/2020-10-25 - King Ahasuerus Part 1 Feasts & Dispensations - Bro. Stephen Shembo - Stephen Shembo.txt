how many read the chapters oh okay okay okay if you behind it's not my fault amen let's go to the book of esther we were supposed to go on part 10 dealing with the line of duty but i got too many signal from the boss i mean so i need to deliver something different today then lord's willing next week we continue on part 10 on the line of duty so hopefully we're going to finish it and at the end you're going to see how he's going to blend with the sovereignty of god then we line up for the line of duty i could not take the praises maybe down the road we're going to get the praises but if your boss continue to insist then i gotta do what the boss is saying amen the church is not led by the wisdom of man it is led by the holy spirit so i must say part 10 and then the boss said move to the right so i got to move to the right regardless of what i said esther chapter 2 we greet all the people here this morning i don't have visitors in this church okay sister ruth okay my brother we have family members in this trade so welcome to the family feel free feel a home you're not a visitor we don't have visitors we have family members good to see you and good to have everybody even my sister from ohio you're not a visitor family member amen let's give the lord jesus christ to him that's not for the lord jesus christ [Applause] okay you see how your boss can remind me things you see how the lord jesus christ remind me things amen esther chapter 2 if you're there you can say amen i believe the majority of you already got the background so we're good to fly yeah everybody i don't know which part was it whether it was part eight or something when i was uh speaking about the sovereignty of god how that esther approaches the king and she have to put on herself a royal appeal before going into the presence of the king your boss loaded something and unlocked it amen because there is a tendency that people think that you only dress up good when we when you leave the message you see how your boss remind me things are you there brother branham is not against the dressing nice matter of fact brother branham say it is something in a woman to make yourself beautiful amen brother branham is against the message is against tight dresses things that provoke people short dressing short skirt all those kind of stuff but as long as your dress is decent make it beautiful not for your pastor for the king amen you don't go to church that you go into a flea market we need to correct this amen you see a sister for a whole year blue skirt blue skirt blue skirt blue skirt flip-flop flip-flop flip-flop flip-flop they leave the message they begin to dress nice like the message told you to wear flip-flops amen the message never say that amen and he give the appearance the message is against lipstick the message is against makeup but you should present yourself in royalty not only to the king but to your husband amen you want to be walking and your husband look he said that's my wife i'm ready for question and answering it's already loaded all right even men dress nice put your tie on come to church looking good amen if you wear a jean a good gin not a gin that look like you're going somewhere amen this is the house of god amen if they invite you to the white house you're going to dress a certain way you're going to talk a certain way you're going to behave a certain way because you're going to meet the president of united states this is more than the president of united states this is the king of kings this is the lord of lords this is the mighty conqueror when you come into his presence you must dress right amen keep your flip-flop at home sorry that's a pastorial esther chapter two did you think it's gonna come out your boss always reminded me amen [Music] who told you you should not dress a flower who told you don't put a pink dress with flowers who told you that brother branham you yourself and you say the message is a bondage the message is freedom freedom liberty in holiness [Applause] holiness doesn't mean to wear one paint from january to december that's not holiness that's a religious demon you see now the message was a bondage our sister were in bondage you were not in bondage if it's seen it's sin makeup wrong lipstick wrong tight paint wrong dress nice there's nothing wrong with it esther chapter 2 verse 17 i already seen the holy spirit doing that himself but i'm emphasizing for those that are lagging behind esther 2 chapter 17. now it sounds pretty good and the king loved esther you remember we stopped here on wednesday he loved esther above all the women we talk about the justification the sanctification of esther now esther have surrendered her self-will she's now taken into the king now it's going to be the crowning of esther you know a quran in the scripture speak of eternal life now it's the baptism of the holy spirit justify sanctify are you there you surrender the self-will then the holy spirit comes to fill you everybody clear praise the name of the lord and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins there's many virgins but only one so that he set the royal deity the royal crown not any crown it's a royal eternal life of the line of judah upon her head and made her queen instead of faster verse 18 then the king made a great fist now this is the third fist we have a first feet fist we have a second one this is the third one it is a feast a feast of what you might be seated then the king made the great feast to all his princes and servant even what you need to preach with me i know some folks are out maybe they are streaming even esther's what so this feast is the feast of esther it is the third fist of king hazaras the easter's feast and he made a what in other words a holy day that's why you had to read it so when it was time for the feast of esther made by the king the king opened up a holiday are you following me in other words there was a day off for the entire kingdom not work amen no work when the crown comes upon your head he have to call you to a holiday you're following me and in that holy day you don't work amen you have been working yourself but once the crime is put upon your head no more work in your life your car needs to be in neutral you okay no more work a holiday a holy convocation a holy convocation this is small and in the fat one amen so you can see esther's feet and he made a release a holiday to the provinces everywhere because of one person everybody is in holiday and gave what so when the crown comes upon the head of esther not only does he call for a holiday for a holy convocation where no one is supposed to work but the coming of the crown upon the head of esther open up a door to gifts i hope you catch him you see when you read the home how easy it is right esther was called justified sanctified six months with mary death than the perfume of the rose of sharon now it's the crowning of esther that crying happened with a holy convocation he stopped esther and the entire kingdom from working and he also activate the gift from the king and he made a release to the provinces and gave gift according to the what state of the so these gifts are coming from the king according to the state of the king it is the jurisdiction of the king to activate or to send whichever gift he wanted are you there amen go to esther chapter five i'm not gonna read the entire chapter because i told you to read at home amen esther chapter five verse three esther broke into the sovereignty of god you remember that that's why you need to keep up with this sermon sometime i ask people no he's still behind somewhere no it's not my fault you have the whole week just couple hours only and you can get the sermon then say the king to her what will you queen you remember this esther and what is your request it shall be given you to the half of the kingdom and esther answer if it seems good to the king let the king and heaven nobody else brother david asked me this question he said what do you think about it i was like there is a key to the church ages there but i was trying to avoid it then brother matama comes i say okay i'm gonna deliver it amen and heaven come this day to the water so now we are talking about something different which is not a fist but it's a banquet and this banquet the one that are invited are the king and heaven everybody knows who the king is in this church everybody knows who herman is we planted haman all the way to the book of isaiah amen who is heaven thank you amen that i have prepared for him verse five then the king say cause heaven to make haste and he may do as esther has said esther is speaking so the king and heaven came to the banquet that esther had prepared watch verse 86 and the king said to esther at the banquet of what so this banquet is called the banquet of wine it is not the banquet of milk amen it is the banquet of wine what is your petition and it shall be granted you and what is your request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed verse 7 then answer esther and say my petition and my request is i found favor in the sight of the king and if he please the king to grant my petition to be to perform my request let the king and heaven come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them i will do tomorrow as king has said so esther invited the king the first time with heaven and the king asked the question and he said what do you want he she said no i want you to come to a second banquet number five it's the second banquet of esther it is also the banquet of wine only two people are invited there the king and herman everybody clear now in between the first banquet and the second banquet in between esther chapter 5. you following me that's why i told you to read at home and esther chapter 7 esther chapter 6 is in between let's go to esther chapter 6. esther chapter 5 the first banquet happened then esther expressed her desire i want you to come again tomorrow on the first banquet there was no unveiling or no revelation of lemon hammond was still veiled here everybody following me heaven was not revealed everybody there are you there but on the second banquet when the king asked the same question then esther reveal him you following me but in between heaven not being revealed on the first banquet and the second banquet where heaven is revealed there is esther chapter six amen let's go to chapter six verse eight it's not a long reading but you need to keep your bible verse eight let the royal appear you remember this you remember this let the royal appearance be brought which the king uses to wear just like so lucifer and the horse that the king rides upon and the crown royal the anointing of the king this is a temporary manifestation mordecai is not the king he's just temporarily expressing the king outside while the king is in the palace which is set upon the head verse 9 and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may array the man with whom the king delight to honor and bring him on a horse back through the street of the city public are you there and proclaim before him that shall it be done to the man whom the king delight to honor everybody clear job to verse 14 and while they were yet talking with him came the king's chamberlains and hester to bring heaven to the banquet that esther head that's the second banquet of esther are you there but before the second banquet of esther there is a revelation of the king to the public are you there and which we already explained to you that is the ministry of the son of man according to luke 17 30 genesis 18 where the king stay into the palace but mordecai take the crown of the king the robe of the king the horse of the king and expressed the king publicly are you there that ministry happened between esther five and esther seven between the first banquet when heaven is not revealed yet and the second banquet when heaven is unfold before the unfolding of heaven are you there the son of man ministry must take place if you don't preach with me i'm going to release brother kalima are we there let's go to isaiah chapter 30. do you see why you had to read at home make sense now i am not giving you a heartache i'm just helping you just all the way wherever i can reach down i have to reach down and pull you so we can go home everybody there isaiah chapter 30 verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the earth so we found that there is a special moon here but the light of the moon the light of the moon will be exactly like the light of the sun in other words when the sun gives its light you can see the difference between the light of the sun and the light of the moon because the moon is not too bright are you there but this moon here when it give its light if you look at that light it is exactly like the light of the sun are you there it looks like the sun but it is not the sun it is the moon and brother branham told us that the moon represented the church everybody there and the sun represented christ there will be a church that's the reflection of that church will be exactly like jesus christ and the only church the only bride the only church that can be exactly like the husband it must be the pride because the bride and the groomer prays the name of the lord the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun you following me the light of this moon is exactly like the light of the sun but the light of this sun that the moon is reflecting is a specific light hallelujah the light of the moon shall be as the light let me take my time we got to drop this are you there the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be watered so this sun here is have a light that is unfold sevenfold are you there and the light of this church must be like the light of jesus christ are you there but this christ is seven-fold christ in other words the light of this church must be the light of seven christ you following me it is in your bible the message is in the bible amen as the light of what oh my god so this light not only is this sevenfold but it is as the light of seven days are you there so this church must reflect christ but the reflection of this christ must be like the christ of seven days first day you put it second day you added third day you added fourth day you added fifth day you added sixth day you added seventh day you added that fullness of seventh day is the light of this sun which is reflected by the moon the light of the sun the moon shall be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold amen as the light of seven days remember your days in the day that the lord bangs up the what did brother vanam preach a message the breach that's right amen hallelujah that shall burn up the what why did brother run and preach the bridge shall burn up the breach of his people and do what heal the stroke of their last scripture let's go to matthew 22 then we pray for those that don't know my style this is the way we operate amen matthew 22 verse 1 i might have to skip for the sake of time let's go to verse 2. if you dare you can say amen the kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king which made a marriage for his son you understand now king marriage son esther king marriage you understand that and sent forth his servant to call them that were bidding to the wedding and they would not this was speaking about the jews everybody clear again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are beaten behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatling are killed and all things are ready come to the what there is a call into the marriage but the one that were invited rejected the marriage are you there verse 5 but they made the light of it and went their ways in other words they paid no attention one to his farm another two is merchandise and the remnant took it his servant and intrigued them spitefully and sued them but when the king heard thereof he was angry and he sent forth his army titus the roman army and destroyed those murderers the jews and burn up their city the city of jerusalem we already explained this then say he to his servant he's not dealing with the jews anymore the wedding is what ready but there which were beaten were not worthy the jews are you there in other words that bride is not coming from there it's going to come out from somewhere go you therefore in the highways and as many as you shall find as many as the lord your god shall call you you get it you need to be reading your bible as many as you shall find beat them to what it's called to the marriage so the servant went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wording was furnished with what so in right here in this parable there is a marriage and there is a king they invited someone the person that were invited refused to come to the invitation of the king and because they refused to come the king divorced them and the king turned around outside and began to sit for new guests in other words they were calling guests to the marriage to seek for a new bride not the one we invited that were already qualified but those were pre-qualified and later on we found them they were not too worthy are you there but he found somebody else who was worthy who was outside in the byways and the highways everybody clear to come into the marriage of the lamb let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us lord we are committing the request that was read this morning lord that you may touch them and further heal them and respond to each one according to their need father we are committing this service also unto the hand lord asking for your anointing your unction to come lord and to speak to your children may you move me completely out of the way may you be the alpha and the omega of this service lord may you speak to your children respond to their need father we seal the devil completely out of this place lord may every spirit of destruction every spirit lord of heaviness of sleepiness lord father may you remove it completely from this place lord but may our mind be centered unto you christ lord that you may minister to your brother this morning as we humbly ask you to commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen everybody can hear me pretty good oh praise the name of the lord we are handling a subject this morning called the king ahazaris three fists and esther's two banquets everybody ready the king are serious three fists there are three fists that the king are serious made the third one was the feast of esther and there are two banquets that were prepared by esther we already explained those two banquets and in between those two banquets there is the revelation of the son of man everybody clear as we started to navigate in this subject i want you to remind to be reminded of this brother branham say in christ is the mystery of god with you he said the bible is written in mysteries by being in this church now you understand what it means in other words everything in the bible is in the form of a symbol and behind that symbol there is a meaning there is a message there is a specific instruction that god is trying to convey to his brother everybody clear the bible is written in mysteries jesus thanked the father for it see that he was wrote in mysteries in the stature of a perfect man brother branham said that the whole world is wrote in mysteries the entire bible and only and only the knowledge of god can reveal it amen that's why you need the message in order to unlock the bible for you because without the message the bible is a sealed book you need the message in order to understand what is the king trying to convey to you amendment brother branham continued in the exposition of the seven church ages he said but in mysteries if the bible is written in mysteries if the whole world is written in mysteries those mysteries require the teaching not the preaching the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear there are stuff you need to be taught if not you're not gonna get it everybody there how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know in other words the whole bible is written in mysteries you need to be taught those mysteries to decode the message that i look under symbols everybody clear brother branham said that god can in other word cannot give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he will be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it are you following me that's the reason why for the ministry of jesus christ we had so many scriptures for one person if you remember the ministry of john the baptist malachi spoke about john the baptist isaiah spoke about john the baptist god did not give two separate revelation he was only one revelation but the reason why he's giving more revelation is to give you more clue for you to catch that revelation when that revelation comes if they ask you a question who is your pastor you're gonna say my pastor is brother stephen there are many brothers that are called brother stephen the part is not enough if we bring five brothers stephen we put them here and somebody get there he said brother stephen all five brothers will rest you will have confusion to know which one is the pastor of this church but in order for god to help you understand who is the pastor god will send a second prophet the first prophet told you that the pastor of spoken word tabernacle is stephen when the second prophet comes he's gonna tell you that the pastor of spoken word tabernacle is tall when the third prophet comes he's gonna tell you that the pastor of spoken word tabernacle is an african-american when the fourth of prophet comes he's gonna tell you that that pastor wear glasses when the fifth one will come he's gonna tell you that that pastor was originally from the congo in africa are you there when you get all those five prophets together then you're gonna understand that your pastor is brother stephen he's tall he's an african-american and then he's originally from the congo he has a dark complexion you got the whole picture together so you won't miss it are you there so now when you enter into the room and you say brother stephen even though five stephen was up you have no detail to detect and to separate your pastor from the other pastor are you there so god give one revelation all those five prophecies all those five characteristics speak about one person but god add more revelation to help you understand and receive his revelation issue hallelujah he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later on designated that seed had to come through abraham he's not changing the revelation he's just bringing that revelation more specific more focused so that the elect won't miss it are you there because the devil is the author of confusion president of the lord he said and that letter said it will come by the same bloodline in what but it was the same revelation he only gave the people more to help them do what and what is indeed a good god is he god more wonderful he doesn't want you to stumble he's gonna help you more like when thomas came he said if i don't put my finger into jesus i won't believe jesus said i need to do more extra work with thomas jesus appeared he said thomas where are you if for you to believe if for you to receive me if for you to understand me it takes you to put the finger go ahead and do it because thomas was predestinated and to predestinated people god will reach down right down and pull you to where you are are you there this is the god that we serve prayers the name of the lord we have been dealing with two women roof and oppa and to understand more orpah roof and uh and esther and to understand more roof we went to the book of esther to bring from the book of esther and understand better the line of judah now let's take esther chapter one we already left the airport hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord for those who read you're gonna see how easy it is to nag to navigate amen our captain our captain jesus christ is in this flight he is co-pilot brother steven is on a pulpit are you there amen esther chapter one everybody there okay verse one now we came to pass in the days of harshers this is a hazares which what rain they are talking about the dominion of hierarchies he has a kingdom he ran from india even to ethiopia we found out that the bible is speaking about a great kingdom of king harasseris and this hazardous the bible is more specific that his reign started from india all the way to ethiopia the bible did not say that his reign started from ethiopia to india are we okay the bible says that it starts from india to ethiopia if you look at those two you found out that india is far east everybody there and ethiopia is on the west side you following me so the dominion the reign of this king start from the east are you there and it moves on to the west are you there it is not a kingdom that started from the west going to the east because jesus christ says that as the lightning goes from there to the earth so shall be the coming of the earth so this kingdom started from east all the way to the hallelujah brother branham help me now civilization has traveled from water east to west and as the sun geographically rises it rises in the east and it travels westward and goes down in the west therefore let's look what the son did when he brought the what the gospel light at the beginning under what there was a pentecost and now pouring off the holy spirit son wanders miracle great thing taken place so brother branham is telling us here that civilization travels from the east to the west the sun travels from the east to the west and the gospel also the influence of the king also start from the east all the way to the west more geographically the sun rises on the easter people first it rises on the easter and set in the west now follow me close civilization has traveled with the sun so has what the gospel started in the east he come from the east across over in germany across the mediterranean into germany from germany across the english channel into english from there across the atlantic into the you there on there east coast and has traveled to the west coast now the east and the west has met the same sun that rises in the east is the same sun that sets in the west now watch the sun son rose as the messiah on the eastern people so we found out as we are reading here that the reign of this king started from the east india all the way to the west the influence of this king started from the east going to the west everybody here verse 2 that in those days when the king of hazaris sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace in the third year of israel he made a what this is the first fist of king asuras our subject is the three fists of king hazaris he made a feast to all the world you need to wake up in esther chapter 1 verse 3 we found the first feast of king a hazaris this feast when he made it he invited a special kind of people are you following me are you following me okay in the third year of his reign he made a feast to all his what so he invited the princes everybody's following me and his if you notice princess and servant are one unit do you see that he didn't say prince's camera servant you see that he said princess and servant the bible is written in mysteries you okay now princess and his servant the power these princes here these servants are the power of persian and media they are the power remember that the power of persia and media come up there so in this feast not only are princes a servant invited but the king also invited the nobles and princes we already spoke about it of the province being before him so the first feast the new testament there was a feast that was invited are you there there were guests that were invited into the feast now king are hazardous which one started from the east which power started from the east and going westward traveling westward he first made a feast his first feast only included the princess the servant and the noble i want you to relax don't taste yourself when you relax it's gonna come are you there don't be going this way you're gonna miss it just relax are you there those princes and those servants are the power of pleasure and media what does that mean first before we continue take genesis chapter 32 keep esther chapter one hallelujah we are still climbing we have now reached the maximum out to 38 the plane is still going this way so keep your seat belt i will tell you when to um amen genesis chapter 32 are you there verse 28. everybody there praise the name of the lord and he said your name shall be called no more jacob but what we found here jacob have been struggling with the angel and as he struggled with the engine the engine finally hit him on the side are you there because he wanted to be blessed and god already blessed him so then later on they came and the angel asked him he said wait a minute what is your name he said my name is what jacob which means a supplemental and god said your name shall no longer be called jacob but what israel everybody there for us and what are you following me israel means a priest you follow me as a priest have you what remember the the the first guests of this feast were princes and those princes were the power of media are you following me and we found out when the name of jacob was changed he changed to a name of israel which means prince and that priest has power with god are you there so the priests have power with god are you following me like jacob being some planter and when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the engine tried to pull away he said i'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted for and his name was changed from supplanter deceiver which means deceiver to what israel first seal but one night he caught the horde of something real and he know he was healed and stay with it and hold on to until he overcome and his name was changed and called israel meaning what we've power before who so we found that on the feast of king jesus those that were invited in those feasts where only the priestess are you there it is a feast that only israel is invited into it the bible is written in mysteries are you following me and those priests are also servant take revelation chapter 7 hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord revelation chapter 7 if you dare you can say amen this church you always need your bible i want to grant you in the word revelation chapter 7 are you there verse 3 saying heard not the earth neither the sea nor the tree till we have silda everybody clear the servant of our god in their forehead who are those servants and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were still a hundred and forty four thousand of all the tribe of the children of what so the children of israel are recognized by god as i like that way of preaching are you there so by revelation 7 it is speaking about the jews brother branham help me now remember the church is not his servants we are his son not his servant the jew is always his servant the church has never been his servant it's been his are you there a hundred and forty four thousand for the tribe of all israel now look all are now the hundred and forty four thousand that was the jews abraham was god's the jews has always been god's servant the gentile has never been his are you following me brother branham god's servant is the jews abraham was his servant the gentile is not a servant it's a bride it is a son this is the son the churches the jews are servant so just remember trace that through the bible and you shall find that the jews is god so the first feast asking a hazarist which started from the east like the gospel started from the jews invited only the princess and only the servant it is a fist that only belongs to the jews are you there even jesus christ when he came jesus came as a jew because jesus was the servant of god take john chapter 4 this kind of world it's a different weapon we can't rush are you there john chapter 4 verse 9 if you dare you can say amen once i pass through this then we begin to soar are you there verse 9 then say the woman of samaria to him how is it that you jesus being a what everybody here being a jew ask a drink of me which i am a woman of what jesus was a jew his fist must start from the east take matthew chapter 12. take matthew chapter 12. if you dare you can say amen matthew chapter 12 verse 17. everybody there hallelujah everybody there let me go by verse 15. but one who jesus knew it he withdrew himself from there and great multitude follow him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that he might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying behold my ever hear everybody clear so jesus was here and he was also here and jesus was so was also a priest are you there priest of peace are you there praise the name of the lord brother branham because he was accepted to jehovah he was anointed with frankincense which means it is a service to jehovah god and now we found out his deity that brought him frankincense was attacked that he was a service to jehovah jesus is what where did brother branham get that now incent matthew what do you see now the message is thoroughly sent with the bible we found out he was jehovah behold mine everybody there you might work to raise this up a little bit the gift that they give was something to identify jesus as jehovah what so we found out that the jews are the princes the jews are the servant and even jesus christ himself when he came because he chose to come as a jew he was called by isaiah the prophet the servant that's why brother branham said the jews are god's servant everybody clear haba de noble take exodus chapter 24 we are trying to see this first feast anybody clear we begin to understand here that by the first feast this feast is a feast where the jews are invited is a feast that the princess israel is invited are you there not the gentile everybody here exodus chapter 24 10. if you're there you can say amen the bible says this the bible says this that and they saw the god of who israel and there was under his feet as he were a pathway of sapphire stone and he wear the body of heaven in its clean in its clearness verse 11 and upon the after he laid not his hand also they saw god and did it and drink so when god told moses to come to the mountain god told moses to come with the noble of israel are you there so when moses saw god moses was not the only one who saw god but the number of israel also were invited to see god the first feast of king jehosares called the princess called the servant and call the noble of the israel are you there take first corinthians 1. i'm still navigating hallelujah first corinthians chapter one if you dare you can say amen when god left the jewish people when god was rejected by the jewish people and jesus was crucified the gospel left the jews and went to the gentile when the gospel left the jew to go to the gentile something happened first corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 are you there paul says this hallelujah for you see you're calling brethren not the jews now he's talking to the corinthians gentile you're calling how many how that not many wise men after the flesh not jews are you there not many muddy not many what ah what the second feast are you there doesn't call me noble you follow me the first feast called the nobles but the second fist does not call me noble are you there the noble in this feast are few you have power you have peter you have the beginning of the jews but the entire is calling the gentile not many noble alcohol are you following me hallelujah take roman 9 praise the name of the lord romans 9 verse 3 for i wish that myself were a curse from christ for my brethren my kingsmen according to what the bible says there were not many after the flesh you remember you remember the flesh who are israelites to whom pretend thee they were the ones that were first called into the king into the feast the adoption belonged to them are you there how can god adopt his own children you see adoption means something else are you there the adoption and the glory and the covenant and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the father and of whom are concerning the flesh christ came who is overall god bless forever amen if you have a problem with deity jesus is god blessed forever it is right here are you not as though the word of god has taken non-effect for they are not all do you read your bible they are not all israel which are off neither because they are the seed are they called what are you there you you understand now so in the second feast here not many jews are called the israel are no more under the flesh it is a spiritual israel it is a spiritual jew are you there but the first feast that feasts inviting only the jews what is the purpose of that fist let's go back to esther chapter one esther chapter one and in the third run of his office when the 20 years of israel he made a feast to all the princes and the servant their power like jacob or persian media the noble and the priests of the province being before him verse 4 when he had what the purpose of this feast are you following me i told you it was loaded brother john are you there was to show the riches of his glorious kingdom are you following me and the honor of his excellence what majesty many days even a hundred and four score days in other words 180 days which is six months remember six months was purification a ministry are you there and then they were six months where they go to the perfume this is another ministry six months are you there even john the baptist preached for six months and jesus preached for three and a half years if you take three and a half years you divided by six he gave you seven there were seven six months in the ministry of jesus christ are you there praise the name of the lord so the purpose of this feast was for the king to show his riches the king had witches nobody knew about them but he chose a specific class a specific country a specific people and invited them to his presence and through that people through the jews through that specific nation god begin to use the nation to display his riches to display his power to display his attributes hallelujah take psalm chapter 145 hallelujah keep esta chapter one let's go to the book of psalms if you think you're reading more scripture that's your problem we have been married for a long time it was since july right married to your pastor and i'm not saying married i'm talking about spiritual before somebody say your pastor is saying another way you should get used to me psalm 145 amen verse 10 verse 5 i will speak david of what the glorious honor of yours and of your wondrous drop to verse 10. you there verse 9 the lord is good to all and his standard mercies over all of his work all your work shall praise you who is his work oh lord all your works shall praise your lord and your descent shall bless you they shall speak of the glory of you and talk of your anybody following me to make known to the sons of man his mighty act and his glorious what of his your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and your dominion and you are true at all so we found out that the purpose of this feast is to show the riches and the glorious that david is talking about god is using israel to display his power hallelujah at the beginning he was hell ella elohim the all self-existing one he existed with all his riches he existed with all his glory he existed with all his attributes but he want to display it he want to show it so he called a first fist are you following me praise the name of the lord in him was hard to be to be a father to be a savior to be a healer this is his riches are you there and these things and these things only display for his attribute see it's what it is that is what makes us and then he put man on a free moral agency for his own holiness and when he did that the man fell then he became hell see it is just displaying his what nothing out of the line in other words whatever happened in the story of this world god have everything under control are you there he allowed men to fail and charge the nation of israel in order through the fall of a man he can display his attribute because he has the riches of a savior but nobody was lost he has the riches of a healer but nobody was sick he has the riches of a prosperity but nobody was poor so god called israel unto the feast and through that feast the purpose of the feast was for god to display his attribute are you there that's why when you look at the life of abraham you see christ when you look at the life of joseph you see christ when you look at the life of jacob you see christ you see the characteristic the identification of jesus christ because it's god showing his riches [Music] hallelujah next he had the attribute to be father he had that to be to be a son he had that tribute to be a healer he has actually to be a savior see all these things had to display themselves and god to make a man sin so he could not punish him no he put him on the basis of a free moral agency and man sin himself and so therefore god became a savior so it's just only the attribute of god displaying themselves that we see and everything is perfectly on time take again roman chapter nine hallelujah hallelujah the first feast of king a hazaris the purpose of that feast is for god to display his attribute you see joseph being sold for 30 pieces of silver because he's telling you i'm gonna be sowed by judah for 30 pieces of silver joseph hated by his brother i'm going to be hated by the jews joseph being sold i'm going to be sold when joseph went to prison two people one save one was destroyed it shows jesus christ there the cross oneself one being destroyed but he uses the jews to display his riches to display his characteristic to display his power whatever he was doing with israel was only an example of what god is are you there that's why when you look at the bible when you look at the jews when you look at the old testament because you are a spiritual jew if he did it for the jew he was only telling you what he can do for you [Applause] are you there if he bless israel he must bless you if he heals he must heal you if he delivers he must deliver you if he conquered for israel he must conquer for you if he fight for israel god must fight for you because he used israel to display his witches to display his power to display his attribute to display his characteristics take roman chapter 9. i don't know if i'll reach the destination hallelujah roman 9 verse 17 are you there and for the scripture says to pharaoh even for this what have i raised you up that i might do what do you see he sent israel to egypt and before israel goes to egypt he taught abraham he said israel will go to egypt jacob was not born yet but he already spoke why are they going to egypt you think they are selling joseph everything is standing on time when he went there he even told abraham after 400 years if the jews only knew they could just relax and say we wait 400. no matter what you're gonna pray only when 400 hits when 400 hit there is no devil in hell there is no devil in hell are you that because it's god time you relax you put your car in neutral it is your timer are you there he did it before israel went to egypt and then he took pharaoh and put him there why he did put pharaoh and when he said moses he said i'm going to harden pharaoh why do you hard and pharaoh why do you make it difficult in my life why should i suffer are you there because through pharaoh dealing with israel through the life of israel through the first feast those that i'm dealing with those that i have invited in my first feast i'm using them to display my power hallelujah verse 17. even for this same purpose have i raised you up and i must show my what power in you and that my might be declared throughout all thee everybody clear jump to verse 22 what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endure with much longer suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction in that word predestinated to be destroyed and that he might make known the what do you see do you see do you see now make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of what which he had prepared which he had before preferred to what he predestinated some people for destruction but some they are vessels of mercy are you there are you there judah can betray jesus christ peter can betray jesus christ but there is no redemption for judah but when it comes to peter he said peter i already prayed for you why didn't he pray for judah the mystery of predestination are you there let's go to romans 15 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord romans chapter 15 remember the purpose of the first feast is for the king to display his power to show his riches to show what he has that he was trying to unfold like my children this is what me or father i am everything that you saw me doing with abraham i'm just giving you example take roman chapter 15 verse 4 are you there let's read together the bible say for whatsoever things were what written before we're waiting for our what do you see now because the first feast it is god displaying what he is and they wrote that in the bible and paul is reminding you that remember the old testament remember the first feast remember the dispensation of the dew god was doing that to teach you something hallelujah before we're waiting for our learning that we threw out and what of the what it is not patient of your feelings but patience through the scripture abraham waited 25 years but god gave him a child so me i have a problem to have a child god will also give me a child and then you learn through the precious of abraham to wait on the lord because god will keep his promise do you understand how you understand how and you not only learn passion but you learn what comfort you're going to travel learn the comfort of the old testament if he comforted david he's going to comfort you hallelujah and the comfort of the scripture might have what hallelujah i like this church i feel really really at home any bible reader who reads the bible knows that god loves to what he brings men into situation that they cannot figure it out in order to show them that he loves them and means what he take his royal and bring him before the red sea israel look the red sea look this way the mountain look this way the desert look behind pharaoh god say just as i expected are you there when moses began to cry he said moses why are you crying are you there do you know what brother branham said he said the pillar of fire move and begin to look at the red sea and instead of looking this way he did this you need a quote when he looked at the red sea he did this the red sea saying oh make way for the king are you there the red sea open up israel left to pass it are you there god put israel in that situation to teach you that sometime in your life i am titling things i am tightening things i am tightening things because i want to prove to you that i am in charge of your life that i love you that i care for you that i'm there for you [Music] you say i'm fed up i don't know what to do just as expected yes sir are you there tomorrow they're gonna take the house they're not gonna take the house just as expected then i'm gonna show you if i created a rent for abraham i can make money for you from today when you read the bible remember it is god displaying you what is it is god teaching you who is so you can use it for your own benefit are you there brother branham he said he was love of his father joseph and hated of his brother now notice perfect picture of the lord jesus i want you to notice how his life just stopped in the old testament everything tapped now being a top of christ a top of the church a top of the holy spirit he was a priest of what just as christ is just as the church what hallelujah take first corinthians 10. i'm almost navigating now we're already in a good alternative you can unbuckle are you there first corinthians 10 verse 11 we're talking about the first king the first feast where they're calling the prince where they call each other when where where they chose a nation israel for god to display his attribute to display his riches he have all these witches nobody knew he called special people he said let me show you what i have let me show you what i can let me show you the power the excellency of my majesty are you there first corinthians chapter 10 verse 11. if you dare you can say that let's read it together now all these things happen to them for what reading that yourself make sure when you get to church either have it on your ipad have your bible we want you to be grounded in the word the bible says brother branham say then we navigate are you there praise the name of the lord now all these things happen to them for what that they are written for our what our instruction you understand upon whom the end of the word has so god gave those things for our instruction if he ran manner from heaven he got a rain manner from me because over there he was in the life of blood of bulls and goat i am under the covenant of jesus christ those people murmur god still gave them manna even if you remember sometimes you're going through radix you did something wrong it doesn't mean he's gonna cut off just repent line up he's gonna continue to ruin the manner it's the devil telling you now that you did this god would never do that no why he didn't do that for his prayer whatever he did for is an example don't let that devil torment you i'm gonna get to the devil soon take james chapter five the first feast of king hazaris james chapter 5 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord that's why the woman at tennessee look she say i'm a widow my husband is not there i have a baby in the old testament there was with the woman there was a child and there was an elijah she went to the old testament and she claimed elijah that's right are you there when she claimed elijah she understood that the old testament was an example then god catch brother branham on the plane turned the plane and ran the plane down because somebody pulled from the example take james to chapter five my people shall never be again in the confusion it's enough it's time for you to enjoy the blessings of god amen not being in the message and suffering like like suffering condoning with sin looking at pentecost so like we're talking about the mysteries there is no god there is a real god in the message james chapter 5 verse 10 take my breville the what old testament who have spoken in the name of the lord for a what do you see the third one for an example of what suffering affliction and of what verse 11 behold we caught them what which what in other words look at the end of those people you are going to trial but i'm gonna show you that your father will not deal with you different than he dealt with them if their end was good your end is also guaranteed to be good therefore if it's a test you toughen up because you know i'm gonna end up like job i'm gonna end up like abraham i'm gonna end up like david hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord verse 11 behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the what you understand now the patient of job and have seen the word of the lord that's the old testament that the lord is very what and what i'm giving you that as an example what he did to job was god displaying his attribute of being merciful and tender mercy are you there so you are reading job the devil struck you the devil killed his children the devil that's not the way you read your bible you look you say they therefore attack job but god by then was showing that he is tender mercy he is wonderful he is a deliverer he and matter of fact he blessed job more at the end than the beginning if i'm going through a trial so my blessing that is coming up must be higher than what i was before hallelujah the feast of a hazardous was gone through the jewish dispensation using a nation and showing his power so that the children in the future might understand what god operates that's why brother branham said when god does something one time if you come under the same thing you have to do it again because there is an unchanging pattern of god god does not everybody here let's go to the second feast of king ahatories a my good brother of it amen let's go back to the book of esther

second feast is how many days after the end of the jewish dispensation another fish to open up which god have seven church ages not dealing with the jews but dealing with them in the book of lester this message is the truth [Applause] don't play with the message don't play with the message i'm not getting this face from someone you need a message hallelujah both great and small we found out that the feast is seven days in the court of the garden of the king what this feast is taking place in the court of the garden don't test relax okay relax then you get it are you there what is going on with this let's take the second chronicle chapter 36 keep esther ii chronicle chapter 36 do you see why you had to read it at home second chronicle chapter 36 i hope david will drive good as he's listening amen second chronicles chapter 36 verses 18 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord chapter 36 18. all right all right verse 18. you're there and all the what of the house of god what so we found that that in the house of god in the temple of god which the first temple was christ and the second temple we are the habitation you remember that the lord coming suddenly into his temple he did it in jesus christ then on the day of pentecost he did it in the temple broad in that temple they are vessels those vessels are what great and small they are all the people greater than what the vessels of the temple are we following me when we say vessels what do we mean take act chapter nine hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord take acts chapter 9 verse 15 hallelujah you ready act chapter 9 verse 15 but the lord said to him that was paul anybody there go your way he was talking to ananias actually sorry go your way for his er so a vessel is a person remember in the book of romans we've seen vestal of honor and vessel of dishonor they were people so those vessels are both great and small and the fists open up with seven days which are the seven church edges everybody following me now let's go to the code let me see here all right let's go to the call let's go to esther chapter one then i'm gonna go to the court of the garden esther chapter one verse five you there and when these days were expired end of the jewish dispensation the king made the feast to all the people everybody no more just a certain class of people that were present in shush and the palace both great and small the vessels of the kingdom remember those vessels are great and some are small okay in other words the vessels are different one from another keep that in mind as i'm going seven days in the court of the garden of the king palace now verse six they are explaining us the court of the garden baccalaureate are you there where where what white green and blue hanging let's stop there there are three kind of hanging the first one is the white one which brother branham said it's the color of purity the second one is agreed which brother branham said it's the color of life and the third one is what blue which brother branham said it is the color of trueness or perfect fellowship if you need those coach you see me i send you all of them are you there when you see the caller what does it mean brother branham we found out he had seven variety of spirit is that right the bible say in revelation that seventh spirit before the throne of god seven manifold seven spirit we find there is seven colors brother charles there is seven churches there oh he just run seven is complete and god was complete seven spirit and those spirits were perfect the first was the coloring perfect love redemption are you there and how remember everything god does the devil copy okay and how if we had time to give those colors and show that each one of those colors represent god's purity and then those colors there is seven natural colors those colors represent the purity of god this is what i'm getting those colors represent the what of god and so when you see color in the bible god is trying to give you a message that's why monica have a purple color which was speaking about the adoption yes sir do you understand but we found that in the court of the seven days feast of the feast of the seventh church ages god in dark court decorated that chord with three colors the color of purity the color of life and the color of perfect fellowship let's continue now hallelujah that's why i say buckle up a little bit we're on a bumpy uh i agree are you there verse six where were white green and blue hangings fasten watch carefully those three hangings they were white hanging by the robert caught it he usually spoiled my stuff okay you're good by the way they were white hanging blue hanging green hanging and blue hanging doors hanging were locked were connected were fastened with what are you there they were fasting with code of what in this church according to the bible and the message they find learn and represent what it's in the book of revelation if you don't know okay the bride is warned in fine line and which represent the righteousness so the righteousness of the sin we saw that it comes from the gospel because the gospel of jesus christ is righteousness are you there because he is our righteousness he is christ are you there so through the gospel that is sent to the church ages that gospel is coupled with eternal life that gospel bring purity towards you and that gospel will bring you in perfect fellowship with god that's the decoration of the gentile churches sister becky we okay he just nod his head here so i want to take you up amen are you there let's go to verse six where were white green blue hanging fasten with code of what and what purple is the color of what royalty would speak of adoption are you there so in the gospel coming into the church ages that gospel not only does he purify you not only does he bring you eternal life not only does he put you in perfect fellowship with god but that gospel will positionally bless you in christ yes sir hallelujah are we okay did i lose anyone let's go and the silver line lining and purple to silvering and pillar of what do we see that here there are pillars and these pillars are made of marble hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i don't know if i will reach even the third fist let's go there now he is not only giving crowns but he said that this in there can you wake up this is will be made we okay peel us in there in the temple of god but what is the temple of god i love brother branham jesus spoke of his body as being the temple i just said it here the lord coming suddenly into his temple he was he was the temple of god but now we are a holy habitation you remember the scripture but now we are his the true church is death by the holy ghost within us now he's going to make the offer coming here in the temple but what is that don't you love the prophet the bible is written in mystery it takes the teaching of the spirit not the teaching of brother stephen of the spirit are you there a pillar is actually a part of the if the pillar is a part of the foundation that means that the floor must also be marble if it's not marble brother branham is wrong [Music] but watch the prophet not wrong are you there all right what is the pure a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for he holds up the superstructure are you there anybody there okay now when god puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that foundation group what is he doing there is a message always a message it symbols but behind symbol a message you need to decode it by the prophet are you there he is giving him a revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostle and prophet had you understand now praise the name of the lord now we found out that these pillars were made of marble now every masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture angelo mica angelo market the archangel angelo's monument of moses is on the three or four footed piece of what why was it in marble it's got uh the foundation of market the archangel sculpture the image of moses was put on a foundation of marble brother branham let's go back to esther hallelujah verse 6 where were white green and blue hanging fasten with the code of fine learning your gospel bringing those and purple positionally placing you to silvering and pillars of marble there is a superstructure god giving you a revelation of himself just like the apostle because the church is built upon the foundation of apostle and prophet jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone are you there the bed wear of gold and silver upon air a pavement now it's the foundation are you okay are you okay are you okay the structure where marble now let's see the foundation are you there the foundation department this column supports you that's right are you there this support the building for you but the pavement is where you walk the pavement is where you that's right whatever is under your shoe you are above than that okay you're gonna get it upon a pavement of what do you remember me telling you the devil can copy everything god does give me colors the color a pavement is what of what red and blue [Music] and white black what all is made out of marble are you there but inside the marble there are four colors are you there blue marble so when we watch those colors we find that there is a white color right there is a red color right there is a black color right and there is a blue color those color are not fastened with the fine liner you're following me the other blue the other green the other white well fastened with other colors are you there because jesus come on a white horse but the antichrist also come on the white horse are you there the white of jesus christ hanging is connected to the final enemy but this white here is on your floor it is a power that is under you are you there not only do you have white but you have ready you're following me still under your feet you're following me and not only do you have red you have black sister laura you gathered you gathered you remember those hoes were they you remember them you remember them yes as you go into the seven churches you're gonna be attacked by the white who are they you want to be attacked by the red horse rather you want to be attacked by the black holes but all those powers are under you are you there yes sir are you there i cannot turn toward the airport [Music] can i turn are you there are you there those colors are banned under they are not over there it's a color when the bride is walking it's working on them are you there are you there are you there they are there relax are you there and there is also a blue color this blue is not fasted with the hanging that's right this is a blue under our feet when you look at the white color the red color and the blue color brother branham said when you mix those three colors he gave you the pale horse rather everybody there and his name was what and who was writing despair was rather the devil satan right help me out brother branham praise the name of the lord and then kick him out yes okay and then comes he is what relax i'm dealing with the blue color yes sir okay amen the number is this yes okay death is your parents rather it is put under you that is coded in mysteries you need a prophet now he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the weed and propel himself with a black with the back of his tail in other words the moving of a mamba is with the tail the tail of the devil the tail of the dragon that tell that drew the third of the staff are you there just whoosh and he's gone hit you in the face where your revelation is let me jump damn native boys and track boys you say you can say mamba and they shall bat their heads together scream because it's what just in a few you see me putting a snake there with the blue color okay brother elijah can you see that better you see that man by there the mamba is death death is your pearl horse rather and this death is certain brother brown i'm sorry in a vision and mamba let's see how he called that mamba are you ready wake up by the bottom and i look at that serpent that member and then he started toward me and he couldn't do it yet and i say what the name of that member is called what the name of the pet horse where the death is called what in the name of the lord jesus christ abandoned and the serpent and what you okay now the life of the mamba is blue but it's under your feet are you there kick him out kick him out are you there a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made the sound like a nest capital s made backwood like an enzyme blue smoke fell out of him and he still choked him up his own death lies chunky mother on self to death around his head paragraph 70. and i went over and did what remember that color is under your feet okay okay mashed on it now i've got to find out about this because it's a vision and hit on on the thing and it turned like that looked like a handle and a glass handle on a picture and just made a solid crystal and i say i think of that how quick that blue smoke was what and what left it all day so the life of a number have a blue color are you there and the number is your death which is certain in another form are you there so under the feast of the seven days the gospel is decorated to help you up but you are working on this earth the self which is infected with the devil are you there the church will go through some of us some of our peers went welcome to the white horse white collar somewhere walking on the red color some were working on the black color but we are working on the blue color which is the member you say he's a snake brother stephen elijah move that up take a look i'm trying to head to the to the airport because i can't get where i wanted to let's go to the book of luke hallelujah luke chapter 10 verse 19. amen luke chapter 10 verse 19. if you dare you can say amen everybody there this is what's before the death of jesus christ everybody there everybody there behold i give you what to do what on what he gave it to the church so we have power that's why when brother branham binded he went and did what mashed on him it is a power on your pavement you have a right to work on it are you there power to thread on the serpent scorpion that second seal that red color you remember the second seal the scorpion was deaf right death where is your sting the scorpion the second seal you remember go watch they are changing pattern of god if you forgot it right but there the scorpion and other because the scorpion symbolizes death by his things and then he says serpent mamba also symbolizes death serpent death scorpion death but you have given power to work over death are you there scorpion and over oh over what no let's go back scorpion come on and also what in other words your pavement have all colors of the devil and you are given power to work over all of them you can mask the white one you can match the red one you can match the the the the black one you can also match the man by himself are you there the power has been giving over all the power of who the enemy and what shall by what do what they are just callers that's why paul said death where is your grave where is y'all because bonus is not gonna do me anything it's only a vehicle taking me to the presence of who all those powers are there don't be scared about them they're not gonna hurt you you have been given power it's a pavement you can walk on all of them everybody clear let's go to esther then i head to the airport i can't get to the second to the two-fist amen i'm gonna hit something then we head to the airport because we need to get the third fist and the two banquet of estelle down the road you there and the pavement red and blue and white and black your full manifestation of the devil in the church ages and marble verse seven and they gave them what investors of what so this seven days prison is a fist of wine and brother branham told us that wine is the stimulation of the and it happened on the day of pentacles when the holy ghost come stimulate the church that was a wine from heaven showing that the seven feast is the dispersion where the holy ghost is given to the churches called the dispensation of the son of god the fist of wine to their gender to all their people for seven days are we okay now verse seven and they gave them drink in vessels of gold deity what the vessels being what they called all the people they were what and small when we read second chronicle in the temple we found that they were vessels that were great and what look right here he said the vessels were diverse one from what and uh not the earthly one the royal one the royal one in what it is the outpouring of the holy spirit in abundance to the gentiles but the vessels are diverse form in other words sister l'oreal vessels is going to be different than sister bridgenet vessels since the bridge and investors is going to be different than sister zadie's vessels even though sister bridgenet is the mother of sister zadie yet the vessels are different because under the jedi god deal with you individually that's why the vessels are different that's why david said here is my cup and i lift it up anoint my cup and my cup run over the cup of density is different than the other cup your cup is different than my cups because we under the gentile god deal with us differently but the holy spirit is in abundance blessed be the name of the lord and royal one in abundance according to the state of what job to verse 8 and the drinking was according to what oh my god none did what in other words there is no restriction you drink on the holy ghost until you are drunk are you there if one cup of the holy ghost make you drunk maybe me i need five take your part and leave me alone let me drink until i am drunk are you there don't look at my life look at your own life fill yourself with the holy spirit let me be feel according to my measure because he gave the holy spirit in nature are you there it is the love of the king no one compel one another don't be wasting your time on me the wine is there if you need it go drink don't say are you drinking too much ah the king said give them according to what hallelujah verse 8 and the drinking was according to the law none did what foresaw the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to what it is a feast where god deal with people and the are you there and according to somebody's pleasure not to you not your pleasure in my life it is my pleasure with my king are you there because when they say everybody's pleasure there is a mystery to that that's right do you know that mystery do you know that mystery you want me to say yes sir do you another mystery brother branham says everything god leads your soul to believe it's yours are you there i might be thirsting for something and you are there like what no because god is telling me that you have been predestinated for that that's what keep pushing me it is according to my own pressure are you there i can buy an escalator and you look at that excalibur you say i don't like it are you there but when you look at nissan you say my i like that car there is something built in you for nissan are you there don't make me a problem with my excalibur you drink according to your measure [Music] are you

to put him there i want my child to be this that might not be what god wants him to be are you there there is something that was birthed into him that was built into him that his body would lean on to it it is the calling of his life oh my god oh my god i'm gonna hit this and stop here you guys have been pulling are you there every man and woman here who has a need of god can receive it right now do you believe that how many believe we for your heart now you sinners and people seeking the holy ghost he is what the holy ghost here is what the holy ghost is friend you that is seeking you don't have to seek and beg and terry the king commandment was they don't have to ask you when your cop is empty they associate they like there who's there who's there that's the king commandment are you there it is up to you to empty your vessel [Applause] remove the trashes clean up your vessels and when you do this there will be other medic feeling from the king [Applause] are you there oh my god oh my god i wish i could get to the second banquet don't ever hide sinner wait when we get to the second banquet of esther always expose it that's right are you there clean up your vessels because as long as your vessel is filled the officer cannot feel it the officers are looking for those glasses that begin to go down they say oh brother stephen preached he used so much anointing the officers

if a man repents and he's baptized he is absolutely god is to the bound to give him the holy ghost if he is repented from his heart if you don't have the holy ghost it's your fault when i say holy
