the word of the Lord tonight into the book of Ephesians uh the fourth chapter uh we're going to read here uh Ephesians chapter 4 uh let's read the 10th 11th and 12th verses and you could be seated I'm going to uh just be reading Ephesians 4 10 11 and 12 and then we'll go from there and he that descended is the the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might feel all things yes sir and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord we ask you father for your grace upon this meeting tonight that you would come Lord and that you would bless it God with your presence Lord we know we stand here tonight we stand under the opice of the very command of almighty God in the written word and commission that you have placed upon Our Lives to preach your word we ask you now that you would come by this way this evening Lord and that you would Minister to the specific needs of this church Lord and now as we commit this into thy faithful hands we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen and God bless you as you could be seated tonight I just want to speak to you if I can I'd like to talk to you about the ministry of the New Covenant yes sir the ministry of the New Covenant now when you're reading here in the book of Ephesians uh of course this is the uh this is the New Testament book of Joshua it's a powerful book and in this book there's a a lot of uh things that Paul is doing that is positioning and actually the next chapter Paul gets into Ephesians 5 he starts talking about marriage which is pretty pretty new to the gentile people amen but he's bringing unto them new things and he's positioning him into things they don't understand and and and one great thing they're not going to understand is they're not going to understand God's uh a dispensing of his authority and of his word through human beings this is this is going to be new to the gentile people altoe amen maybe Israel had heard some things but even Israel was going to be receiving some different uh different instructions on God's way and how he was going to do things but if you if you're reading Ephesians 4 you can kind of back up above it and you can see a little bit how he begins by saying that we're endeavoring to keep the unity of the peace and and that there is one body and there is one Spirit even as you're called into the hope of one calling and there is one Lord there is one Faith there is one baptism see there's only one God and the father of us all above us all and through us all and in you all now now now Paul is saying something powerful by saying that there is only one Lord there is one faith and there is one baptism right amen now the prophet teaches us very clearly there's only one Lord amen and there's only one faith and people talk all the time so well my faith brother B said you know it's not your faith it's the faith amen that there is a the faith and that Fe faith is the faith of Jesus Christ that's what Jude was contending for not too long after the death of Christ Jude was talking about the faith and that's what Janis and jambers in the end time what they resist is the faith that's and there is only one one Lord one faith and one baptism so we look tonight at well there's two baptisms but actually there just one baptism there's a baptism of spirit amen and that's the prophet said that by one spirit baptized into one body but it's water baptism is only an outward expression to put you in the Fellowship of the church sir but the spirit baptism amen is the baptism Paul is talking about because he's talking about bringing you into the spirit isn't that powerful amen that here's a man bringing the gentile people he's bringing the race of of of people under abrahamic Covenant and listen let me say this very clearly as a natural man they had no hopes of the Covenant of Abraham amen so to come into the Covenant of Abraham it was a spiritual Covenant am you you can't come into the New Testament without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't be a Christian without the baptism of the Holy Ghost see people say well I I'm going to just read the word going to believe the word amen and that's only a part of that amen you believe unto something but you're not but you're not a part of the New Testament because it is a blood Covenant or a spirit Covenant that God has made with the church and that's Paul saying here in the eth verse he said wherefore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is but that he also descended first into the lowest parts of the earth and he that descended is the same also that ascended up above all Heavens that he might F all things so Christ had a work to do and he was going to fulfill all things amen I love when you start reading Apostle Paul because Paul is reaching back into the Old Testament where he has been schooled and now he's bringing up Messianic prophecies that that the Israelites and people have told for years and now Paul is assigning these prophecies to being fulfilled by the man Christ Jesus Amen in Psalm 68 if you'll watch the scripture now and Ephesians 4 and8 amen Paul says wherefore he saith he ascended he's quoting Psalm 68 and8 that thou has ascended on high thou has led captivity captive and thou received gifts for men amen Paul also assigns psalm 16 veres 9 and 10 therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh shall Rest In Hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell see he descended first I will not leave my soul in hell and neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption so Messiah was prophesied Amen to go to hell but he wasn't going to stay in Hell amen he had to go there to do a work but he wasn't going to stay there but he was going to send up on high do you see it was our lord Jesus that went there for us as a man amen I I say today it's a powerful thing because listen my fear of going to hell is already gone amen cuz somebody went there for me I don't have to go to hell cuz Jesus went for me he became My Sacrifice he became my Escape go and he carried my sins far away and he carried them into hell amen where he laid them amen back in hell where they come from now the prophet of God tells us here in Hebrews chapter 2 Paul will say For unto us Angels ha he not put in subjection to the world to come wherefore we speak but of certain place testified saying what is a man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visit him now there's there's great titles and subjects every quote every scripture I'm reading for what is a man that thou art mindful you ever thought about what is a man that God is so mindful of you why can't he just let you go why why couldn't he just let you go with a tide and and and let the enemy take you because man amen is an attribute of God that came from God so God can't just let that go he has to redeem that amen but he couldn't redeem it as God he had to redeem it as a man so he couldn't come here as an angel our lord Jesus had to come lower than the angels and take upon Him amen the the form of a man take your time put all things in subjection under his feet and he left nothing that is not put under him but now you see that we see Jesus who was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death amen was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he might by the grace of God should taste death for every man yes sir now the Bible tells us in Hebrews 2:6 he took not on him the nature of an Angel but upon him the Seed of Abraham is that right now this is a man then Jesus was a man amen I don't have time to preach these subjects but if you believe it just say Amen Jesus was a man somebody said well we 50% man 50% God no sir he was all man and he was all God that's right amen I think it's called a hypostatic union there's actually a union amen that allows two things to come together without dissolving one another you know amen you can make God and man come together and that's the union between Father and Son that was a union that could remain all man and all God and you could put them together don't that tell you a powerful thing tonight God to become in Union with you and he's still just as much God as he was when he was in the man Christ Jesus when he's in the Church of the Living God now he was the man Jesus was a man but that man come from Heaven amen amen you see it was in John chapter 8 he said if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither I came from myself but he sent me for the father himself loveth you because he have loved me and he has believed that I came from God Amen I came forth from the father and I am com into the world John 16 and 28 and I leave the world and go to the father and his disciples said unto him Lo now speakest thou plainly but speak in no proverb and now are we sure knowest all things and needest not that any man would ask thee but by this we believe that thou come forth from God yes my look this man come from God EX look in 1 Corinthians 15 and 45 Paul says this and so it is written the first man Adam was a living Soul that's right the last Adam was made a quickening spirit that's exactly how be it this was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth sir Earthly but the second man is the Lord from heav oh Hallelujah that second Adam was a man from Heaven I tell you this the son of man which we are speaking of tonight is from heaven in John 3 and13 it said the son of man which is from heaven now I'll tell you this he descended Out of Heaven let me tell you this he didn't leave Heaven behind sir amen but when Jesus Come Out of Heaven he brought heaven with him amen amen amen he brought the kingdom of heaven with them now when Jesus came the Kingdom of Heaven came to the Earth that's right Hallelujah my brother do you know that brother randam said that God expanded heaven for the Redemption of man yes sir how did he expand Heaven he sent a man from Heaven down to this earth and when we couldn't go to him he came to us that's right and when we couldn't go to heaven he brought Heaven down to the Earth and when Jesus was on the earth heaven came down to man that's why amen that Jesus seen the Angels coming out of heaven and descending upon the son of man that's exactly you see we find out that he brought heaven with him amen it was Jesus in the expanded Place between heavens and the Earth it was an atmosphere of heaven but yet it was on the earth listen do you know that's where brother Ram said you and I were going to meet Jesus sir he said we won't meet him here and we won't meet him there we'll meet him in that place amen there's an atmosphere there is a dimension that comes with God when he comes down to the earth I think about it tonight that we find kingdom of God came to the Earth with this man Jesus amen you know he brought heaven with him when he could stand on the bow of the boat and say peace be still and the winds and waves had to obey his voice You Know that heaven was with him when he could stand there and he could tell the dead to rise up and walk when he can tell the cripples Amen to take up your bed and go walking off but he didn't just do that he said is it easier for a man to forgive sins he said or to heal the sick and he told him go sin no more you see he forgave sins he healed the amen the blind saw the deaf heard amen what was it he controlled nature itself that's right amen I'm talking about God came down to man he lived in this realm that we're living in but heaven was right here with listen it was even even the Gentile amen recognized the authority this man had when he looked at him and said I need you to come to my house and I need you to pray for my servant and Jesus said I'll come down and pray and he said but wait a minute I don't need you to come I just need your word to come hallelujah hallelujah I I I don't want to get deep into it but the prophet of God said it like this amen that Jes Jesus didn't do the work but it was his father that dwelt in him that's right how many knows brother BR said the father was the Dynamics in the mechanics of the sun amen and it was the Dynamics that was dwelling in him amen the atmosphere moved with the word of God I was spoken out at the mouth of Jesus he never physically went down there no sir because it wasn't his physical body that did the work it was the atmosphere that accompanied the word which he spoke and I say something tonight that same word that issued out of the mouth of our Lord Jesus is still alive tonight and that atmosphere still moves with this word because this word can come in your deepest darkest trial it can come in the hell of your homes and the troubles and the struggles but it brings an atmosphere when it comes my brother yes sir oh yeah I know what I'm talking about I'm talking about the word bringing something to you yes brother take your time yes when Jesus came yes sir see the atmospheres themselves have been blocked off from from the fall of Adam that's right amen since the days of the Garden of Eden and sin committed there was a Gloom over the earth and the prophet said prayers couldn't even reach under the heavens because the Gloom and superstitions and sin had blocked man off from Heaven that's right oh but when Jesus came yes sir amen when Jesus came amen he br brought Heaven down to the Earth yes sir and then he himself became sin sacrifice that's right yes now now I I don't I can't preach all night so I got to I got to hurry but let me just just say this clearly to you take your time he descended before he ascended that's exactly right and when he descended he went to hell now y'all don't nobody sugarcoat this amen he became a sinner the Bible said he who knew no sin became sin that he might take our sins upon Him amen what was it he became sin and died a sinner's death and he went to a sinner's Hellen but he wasn't a sinner he was The Lord Of Glory he descended into hell to defeat hell that he might take the keys that he might take the keys away from the devil because he took the Triple Crown of death hell in the grave and he conquered them and Rose up on the third day to prove to the devil you have not power which you won in the days of Adam you lost it you lost the power of hell you lost the power of the Grave you have lost your power amen I have thou the keys am now look at what he was going to do with these Keys when he went back into the Earth sir now this is a powerful thing folks because when he went back into the Earth our lord Jesus when he was seen there early in the morning at the tomb there was a woman standing there and he said why weep and she went over to touch him and he said don't you touch me take your time don't you touch me take your time for I have not yet ascended unto my father yes sir but if you ever noticed it's only a few days later that's right that he appears in the room with his disciples and he says to Thomas come and touch me that's right something had happened between that morning at the resurrection and the evening when Thomas was commanded to touch him I tell you what the prophet said he said his work wasn't done when he was resurrected but he yet had the work of the high priest to do brother and if you look in the Old Testament the high priest had to take the blood into the holies of holies and only one man could enter the holies of holies and he could atone for the sins of many my brother and our lord Jesus tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God Alone yes my and he resurrected alone yes sir and he went in the presence of God Alone yes sir amen but after he had atoned for our sins he turned around and came back into the Earth hallelujah hallelujah and preached 40 days of his kingdom and how it would be upon the earth when he did this amen our lord Jesus standing there having done the work of the Ascension amen he had broke through the death's hell he had broke through now listen folks y'all know this he had broke through every barrier of unbelief he had broke through every barrier of sin he had paid sin's debt he Whi the devil and all of his angels He took power over Heaven he took power in the earth and he took power in the hell and that he could stand there and say all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me let me tell you what he did when he was getting ready to leave this earth he didn't just leave he gave a commission that's right yes after after hell was conquered after the Crave was conquered after sickness was conquered yes sir he gave a commission to his church go ahead now you know I think about this sometimes you you you read the words of a man but I want to know what kind of man I'm listening to you read what somebody said but I want to know where they were standing when they said it that's it you know you know what I'm saying amen we saying all is well well that's song's okay until you hear the story behind it and it takes another level that's it that's it Nearer My God to the takes a different level it matters where a man was standing when he said it see when Paul said that the victory amen where grave is thy Victory amen it's been given to me now that's one thing to say that sitting in a comfy chair in your church but that man had his head on a chopping block amen so the words become more powerful according to who said it and where they said it at amen when you read Mark 16 you can see that our lord Jesus had taken power over death Hell In The Grave he had conquered the atmospheres of sin sickness and death he had took complete control of Heaven amen and we know that he's now going to be ascending to heaven to sit upon the right hand of the father that he might bring his authority back to the Church of the Living God and the last words he said to his church he said unto them go ye under the world yes sir and preach the gospel to Every Creature yes sir creature amen that word creature ain't just talking about some animal it's talking about everything that is bound go tell everything that is bound that there has come Liberty go tell everything that has been held in captivity that there is Liberty listen you don't have to sit here tonight and hear the gospel of Jesus Christ bound up in your Creeds bound up in your feelings bound up in situations and trials there is a gospel tonight that is a gospel of Liberty and it'll bring Liberty to the places that you never [Music] dreamed preach the gospel to Every Creature listen I'm not talking about some sof soak Daddy's religion amen but some old church I'm talking about some old boy with his mama's haircut and her jeans on Amen sometimes you see these guys now amen they man look like today amen where where's where's the preachers left you know where's the guy that'll stand in the gospel and cut till every f is free until ever life you know we we've so watered this thing down but I think it's time to throw our psychology books away and pick the Bible up again pick the message of the hour and preach and preach until every Spirit has been broken until every son and every daughter has been liberated yes sir there is a Liberation in this word preach the gospel to Every Creature listen people say well brother Wayne I'm bound I'm a hopeless case no you're a case amen you said well I tell you what brother Wayne Amen you preaching on me sometimes people such a big Target you can't miss them that's exactly right they come p and submitted Devils to church you can't miss them come into church and say you can't move me you can't touch me I'm not going to get in the meeting tonight let me tell you what there ain't a devil out of hell that could ever withstand the message of this hour there is a power that is behind this word that'll break every demon that'll destroy every devil hallelujah hallelujah yeah amen see pre preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth shall be baptized but shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink deadly things it shall not harm them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall somebody say shall and they shall recover so the Lord had spoken unto them and received up into heaven and they set upon the right hand of God do you see tonight we're talking about words that were spoken the last words that Jesus gave to the church amen the last thing he said amen so is it's in 1965 in your language amen this ain't something that you can you you can cast off for another time this is current events this is current word this March 16 was a commission of a new gospel that was being preached unto that generation because it was the Covenant of almighty God yes sir his last and final words he's ordaining a new order amen oh Hallelujah Jesus is ordaining a new order yes sir brother Jesus himself ordained this foolish thing that I'm doing [Music] tonight hey what you call foolish the Bible said don't you forget this by the foolishness of preaching man shall be saved amen your physical body your spiritual body salvation comes from the word of the Lord yes sir amen you see he ordained a new order he was changing the priesthood that's exactly right Aaron's priesthood has now ended and there's a new order that's come on the scene a new way a new way of doing things I love how Paul said in a new and a living way amen it would be the preaching of the Gospel that's right see this would be under the order of maledict this would not be under the order of Aaron this would not come under the order of Levi this would come under the order of maledict do you see in Hebrews 7 the Bible tells us Perfection was not brought under Aaron's order amen the the Bible says therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need would there be for another priest that should rise after the order of Mount cdct see if if Aaron's tribe did it if the Levis did it then what need would there be for another order to come but because it was weak in its law and it's weak in what it could do there was need for another it had to be a priesthood change but there also had to be a change of the law do you see their priesthood was weak because of the law because the law amen was something that was making through the carnal flesh I love how the scripture tells us that there had to be a change of law there had to be a change of priesthood that God had another sacrifice now he had another system now and he had another priesthood now it would be a gospel system it would be a gospel preacher and it will be the sacrifice of his own blood do you know amen that our Lord never sprang out of Judah our Lord who was the high priest of this church never came from Judah but the Bible said amen of whom things spoken pertained to a tribe which no man gave attendance to The Altar for it is evident that our Lord spring out of Judah at which Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood yet it is more evident that the similitude of mecdc there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of carnal Commandments but after the power of an endless life Hallelujah Jesus was not a he was not a high priest by law he was not a high priest because he was in the levitical law he was a priest by the power of endless life that's what it is there are a priest Forever After the order of mecdc the 18th verse says this there is there therefore a dising of the Commandment before the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect can somebody help me tonight the law made nothing perfect can we say it again the law made nothing perfect see who has Bewitched thee Oh galatian that thou have begun in the spirit you that began in the spirit will you now be made perfect in the law will you leave the spiritual attitude will you leave the spiritual word for the carnal Commandments of man for the laws and traditions of the altars amen but I say that there was nothing made perfect by it there was never a man made perfect by matter of fact somebody had to come from outside of it to fix the whole thing for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing of a better hope did that was Christ by which we draw nigh unto God see what the law Paul says in Romans 8 what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh condemn sin in the flesh you see in Hebrews 10 he said it's not possible somebody say possible possible it's not possible it's not possible this is the beauty it's not possible that blood and goats could take away sins and me it's powerless to remove sins then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God and he taketh away the first so he could establish the second listen if he hadn't to took away the first I don't even have a right to preach to you tonight the Gentile can't even preach the gospel because we're not Israelite by birth amen we're not of the tribe of Levi we have no rights to the attendance of the altar but out of Judah spring a line and this was the order of mecdc became God became the priest of the church let me say something to you tonight your pastor is not just a pastor but it's God's office to speak to the Church of the Living God hallelujah amen in Hebrews 10 he said by one offering he perfected forever them that are Sanctified do you see what it is when Levi and and and and and had been spoken to concerning his tribe and the tithing that would go to his tribe you remember what he said to him he said to him he said Levi you were in the loins of Abraham when he paid tithes under meaned so the priest who descended from the natural loins of Abraham through the Levites and there they had attendance at the altar but just as Levi was in Abraham so is today the bride was in the loins of meaz we were as much in mdict as Levi was Hallelujah listen we are not a levitical law we are the order of mecaz that God has come into his church it's God the priesthood it's God of the order do you see for ordained gifts the Bible tells us that they ordained the prophet of God said the gift of ministry he said was ordained before the foundation of the world do you know the Prophet said gifts and callings are even without repentance I know I know what I'm talking about long even sometimes after men disqualify themselves they're still gifted amen I you know what I'm talking about down here in the South some of these guys have went out amen and done everything amen everything they could to disqualify their Ministries but because they still got a gift because they still got a gift don't mean they're qualified to use the gift in the house of God see see repentance does not change the gift of God because the gift is for ordained of God that's why you don't receive gift by laying hands of the elders amen you can lay your hands on a man till you turn blue in the face but if God ain't called him to preach amen he'll never be a preacher I know I know in this generation we got some guys calling other guys to preach well I tell you what some of the guys they called ain't much preachers and I think they are to have to preach them if they call them but if God called them God will preach them amen the Bible said that a gift will make a room for itself come on it's not brother Steven's job to make a room for your gift it's God's job to make room for your gift amen oh hey somebody help the preacher in here tonight a gift from God is ordained from God and God will take care of the gift he ordains [Applause] Ministry comes from God it's not it's hey it's Amen it's not just something you pick up and do well my daddy does it so I'll do it not this not this gospel my uncle does it so I'll do it not this gospel this is not the law of carnal Commandments this is the power of endless life this is mdic order this is God ordained gifts God ordained men [Music] Hallelujah hey now my Bible said that Jesus amen brought us into him and made us new creatures and old things passed away and All Things become new and all things are of God who reconciled himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation Hallelujah to Wi that God was in Christ there's your order amen there's the order God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses but hath now committed unto us the word of reconciliation and we are ambassadors for Christ Hallelujah then that means you can't treat me any way you want to I come from a Heavenly place you can't talk to me any way you want to you can't talk about me any way you want to I Come From Heaven and I'm going back to heaven and I'm here to do the will of My Father which is in heaven Hallelujah listen I know people's got so so lazy with how they talk to one another in this age but listen in the message respects brother B said if you respect one another you're respecting God and sometimes I think the church ought to go back and listen to the message respect because they think they can talk to their Pastor anyway they think they can talk to the Deacon anyway they talk to the Evangelist anyway I know this might be an Apostolic anointing but it's the truth anyhow we need to watch how we talk to God's laborers who are in the vineyard they belong to him somebody said to me some time ago they said well I tell you what brother Wayne so and so's doing certain and so and so doing certain thing what do you think I said I don't judge another man's servant they ain't my preachers I'm not judging them amen God will judges men we're not a denomination we are not a denomination amen we are a kingdom and God is in control of our kingdom come on church do you see what it is it's the gospel of Christ and this is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth it's the power of God no I'm not ashamed of the Gospel no I'm not ashamed to preach the gospel it is the power of God unto salvation you can try to get saved any way you want to but God set it up in his Covenant that the hearing of the word is the way salvation is brought to your life I know that people think they can fire the ministry you can't fire the ministry you didn't hire me you can't fire me you didn't put me in you can't take me out God sent me to this earth he sent me here to preach this message they said well you preach the message of William Brandon when you'll be put out that's all right I'll be in good company cuz they put Christ outside the church amen and the Bible said they went outside the camp to fellowship with him Hallelujah you can't fire a man of God you can't fire somebody God sent to you oh you you now y'all y'all know I'm in the Bible Jezebel tried brother said he said Elijah was her pastor anyhow Elijah was her pastor whether she liked it or not and she was given space to repent look at what I'm talking about it's the gospel it's the good news coming from God but if we waited till there wasn't a controversy to preach we wouldn't never preach if we waited for permission from the Deacon board to address situations they would never get addressed people are more interested in filling the pews than filling heaven I'm not interested in congregation sizes I'm not interested in crowds I'm interested in the power of God that'll put a man in the Rapture Hallelujah you know what I'm talking about we don't need to take a poll to see what we can preach and can't preach amen well we got to leave this part of the message alone and we can't get over here and we can't do this listen let me say this if a prophet of God said it we can say it if the Bible said it we can preach it amen and I say this if hell don't like it hell better get out of the way cuz the ministry in this hour won't be retreating they won't be surrendering they'll be standing in the place of God they've been anointed to preach the gospel for therein is the righteousness of God revealed me you my brother take your time I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking about the one that controls everything said I I commission you to preach the gospel now back in the old days they had they had the sounding of the trumpet y'all know that every 50 years the trumpet was sounded for Jubilee right so what it would mean is if you sold something in 50 years and you lost your house you lost your car you got in debt whatever every 50 years he cleared all the debts let you get all your stuff back and start over again that's what it meant actually it's what it meant don't do don't do dealings with God's people cuz the devil you're going to lose every time cuz God's going to clear all my debts and laugh at you when you come to tell him I owe something yeah he will and then the Old Testament do you see they they would only sacrifice up there in Jerusalem and the blood would be people who wasn't at Jerusalem how did they know that there was blood up there how did they know the sacrifice had come on the Jubilee the Bible said that they would blow a jubilee trumpet which was a Ram's Horn which was a winded instrument which had no power within itself it had to be blowed through so the breath that blowed through it would be the sound to say atonement if you heard it if you heard it you could tell your neighbor the atonement is made come on y'all we can go home how do you know we can go home didn't you hear that did didn't you hear that well I I heard it but what does it mean it means the debts are paid see a lot of people hear the gospel but they don't know what it means let me tell you what it means when you hear this gospel it means the debts are paid it means the thing is cleared up and God has forgiven you your sin it means you can go home you can go back to Daddy's house you can come back in the presence of God do you see every 50 years every 50 years the Levites would sign that horn and they would do it they would sound the Rams Horn and they would do it in the 50th year at the right time under the right atonement and that that was the acceptable year from Isaiah 61 but when Jesus comes in Luke 4 he picks the Bible up he picks up the scripture and he says I have been anointed to preach the acceptable year he's not going to blow a horn like they did he's not acting like Levi's tribe he's not acting like Aaron's tribe he's commissioning a new way of Jubilee it's not a Rams Horn it's a man preaching the go Gospel of Jesus [Applause] Christ but hey but he's still just an instrument he's still just an instrument and he can only say what comes through him oh yeah the inspiration comes which is the wind of God my Bible said that the Bible is good for Doctrine and it was written by the breath of almighty God so when when the scripture comes through a god anointed man it's the breath of the atonement breathing out upon the church I'm not talking about a dead letter I'm talking about the Gospel of Jesus Christ Life coming out God has ordained another way it's to preach the acceptable year now the anointing has come to preach the gospel to stand before people and declare to them that the blood of the Lord Jesus has come to set the captive free to bind up the Brokenhearted that the poor might have the gospel preached unto them amen the atonement is made known by the preaching of the Gospel now y'all y'all the the the the cross was 2,000 years ago you can't see it you can't smell it you can't feel it but you can hear it but you can hear the cross for the preaching of the Cross is to them foolishness but to us it's the power of God under salvation do you see the preaching of the Cross oh I'm talking about the preaching of the blood of our Lord Jesus you don't see it you ain't there but you can get it the same as if you were standing there because it's not the liquid blood that we're putting on you it's the life that was in the blood now now come on I'm going to go back to the first of my sermon now when that word come from Heaven it brought heaven with it and when the word of God comes it brings heaven with it the word comes Anointed with a Heavenly atmosphere because the word is not from man the word is from God oh my goodness listen there will never be another Calvary there'll never be another shedding of the blood y'all remember what Moses did wrong don't y'all he Smit the rock the second time brother Bram said what he did is he broke every tight in scripture he should have spoke to that rock he should have spoke to it cuz it was already smitten and the Church of the Living God we don't have to have another Calvary but it's time for us to speak to the Rock and we can get the same Waters that they got in the first days in the last days if we just speak to the Rock if you speak to that rock do you see there will not be another Calvary won't be another Calvary but there'll be a preaching of this gospel now I know people today you know you preach the message and they come say well you don't preach enough the but of blood I tell oh my goodness amen I don't mean to make fun of somebody but that's scripture ignorant come on church amen this is the product of the cross the prophet of God said him and his message was one listen let me tell you the greatest message you ever heard was not a preach and not just a preach sermon but a lived one y'all know what I'm talking about it wasn't just brother Ram's words it was deity speaking it was deity speaking when stood there and created that squirrel you tell me what that meant when he said let there be a squirrel and he didn't say in the name of the Lord and he didn't say thus sayeth the Lord because he didn't say it for the Lord it was the Lord that said [Applause] it come on Church the blood the blood the blood broke the curse and it put man back in Eden again so that a man could speak he could speak again he can bring creative atmosphere again he could bring creative anointing again I'm talking about the blood a man in his message is one do you see the the gift of healing doesn't mean that I have a gift myself to heal brother B said it don't mean that it means a man has got faith in Divine Healing so he points the people to the finished work of Calvary now listen I know some of you feel like you got saved 10 years ago and some of you feel like you got saved 20 years ago but I'll tell you what brother brandom said he said you wasn't saved 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 he said you were saved 2,000 God did everything he could ever do for you at Calvary come on church if Jesus was standing here tonight all he could do is to point you at the finished work of Calvary that's all he could do is stand here tonight cuz there's where he broke the backbone of Satan I know these are simple points let's let's remember this that it was at Calvary where he broke the backbone of the devil because he destroyed sin through one sacrifice now it's not every day we're trying to figure out how to not be a sinner it's not every service we're trying to figure out how to not be a sinner but but the blood atonement the blood atonement of Jesus Christ took sin away from you and you didn't know it it was that way for 1900 years and you didn't know it but one night you were sitting in a gospel meeting and somebody said the blood did it for you and all you did is in your little heart begin to believe the blood did it for me and right there you accepted the atonement of sacrifice Hallelujah now listen I I I I think that it's important for us to know this that we got to have something Beyond The Altar we got to have something Beyond we come to the altar we receive the spirit of God but then what but then what are we lost and saved every week are we lost and saved every time something comes along every struggle but my Bible said grieve not the spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your [Applause] Redemption I know I know that really hurts the legalist Doctrine but I didn't get called to preach the legalist Doctrine I found out that legalism don't do anything but kill the church and let me say this just as clear as I know how most legalist preachers I know has got more sin in the back room than 90% of their churches and they're hiding behind their critical spirit well glory be to God well somebody holler preach it's the truth Brothers it's the truth you wasn't saved two years ago you wasn't saved five years ago everything he did he did at Calvary now that's why Jesus sent his disciples into the Earth to preach the gospel because it would be the good news of what he had done for you and me the good news would reach our heart and we find out this is why in Galatians 3 and8 Paul will say this the scriptures foreseeing God would justify the Heathen through faith oh my goodness the Heathen that's me and you that's idop packing heathen polytheist IC believing come on church we were Idol worshippers but God who is rich in Mercy sent a preacher to your house he sent a preacher in your [Applause] life no wonder the Bible said beautiful are the feet of them that carry the gospel I don't care if he got the ugliest feet that ever was beautiful are the feet he's bringing the good news this Heathen would be saved through faith how did Rahab get saved even under the old Covenant how'd she do it she had Faith the Bible said she was justified by her works is that right but she was justified by the works because she believed so her Works were the works of Faith come on your works are works that's fine but they got to be works of Faith now I don't I don't have a week to preach on the Bible but how many believes the Bible is the word of God I believe it's the word of God and I believe it's given for inspiration and instruction and correction is that right and Doctrine for who soever shall call on the name of the Lord who whoever I like that don't you whoever the Heathen will be justified by faith so you're not too far gone to call on the name of the Lord listen Jonah was in the belly of the well and called on the name of the Lord the Hebrew children was in the fiery furnace and called on the name of the Lord amen listen you can't get too far that you can take the prayer out of a Saint's heart Samson thought he was too far but the prophet of God said he caught a vision that a prayer meeting would change things whosoever whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved but how but how listen whoever calls on his name will be saved but how shall they call in whom have they not believed and how shall they believe on whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher come on a preacher ain't somebody you can take or put away it ain't somebody you can just say well we want them we don't want them it's God's office it's what God done for this generation do you see how they call upon him who they not believe say how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent for it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel bring Good Tidings see but not all have obeyed the gospel Isaiah said Lord who ha belied our report so then Faith cometh Faith cometh listen to this you said brother Wayne I don't have any faith faith cometh you say I don't have enough Faith to be saved Faith cometh I don't have enough Faith to be healed Faith cometh I don't have enough Faith to speak squirrels Faith cometh I don't have m ming faith faith cometh you said brother I need faith faith cometh how does faith come Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God listen can I say it can can I say it Faith don't come by the hearing of psychology Faith don't come by the hearing of good music Faith don't come by TNT or CNN or I'm going to say it es being that's not how Faith Comes Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing of the word of God I say God give us some gospel preachers I say God give us some Brands out of the fire I say God give us some men that would rather preach the gospel then breathe their next breath I tell you you ought to pray for Laborers you ought to pray that God sends you preachers the only thing a minister can do is he can explain the word in such a way that you believe Christ and then healing takes place do you see the preaching of the word of God brings a blood Veil it'll bring a blood Veil amen now y'all y'all know in Acts 2 3,000 people got saved right how'd they get saved Peter preached the gospel and they got saved you know what Peter did he sprinkled them with the blood but the words he spoke wasn't empty words they were words carrying life the preaching of the word of God brings down a veil it brings down a gospel trumpet to bring blood to your life listen the prophet of God tells us this when a minister walks in a Congregation of people praying and the anointing of the spirit you are bound to hear from Heaven do you want to hear from Heaven get to praying and invite A Gifted preacher you want to hear from Heaven get to praying and invited A Gifted preacher because the Bible said the word of God is a discerner of the thought and the intents of the heart no we might not sit here and call your name but this gospel will [Applause] Supernatural words will be spoken over your life do you see what it is it's the way God anoints a man and then you're bound to hear from Heaven I I know what I'm talking about some of you call up in a prayer closet you pray and pray and pray and you ask God to speak God speak God speak and then he'll send a man of God by and he'll preach exactly and then you don't want to line up with that I know what it is people would rather Kill the Messenger than receive the message but if you get to praying and you get a Gifted Man in the Pulpit you're going to hear from heaven now there's a lot of ways to hear from God I I I I I agree with you but let me hear see what a prophet said and what is a vision he said listen he said I think and I'll say this from my heart the greatest and highest form that there is for God to give a message to his people is for the people to believe the word the highest form is preaching the gospel it is the highest form the gospel is not a Ouija board the gospel is not a guessing gain the Gospel of Jesus Christ is sure and steadfast and unmovable and Incorruptible it is the word of God God uses men God could have used the son to preach he could have used the wind to preach but God chose man to preach do you know man is God's agent God come and visit us and he sends an agent an agent that's the hardest thing that there is is God to get one mortal to believe another what is your credentials God called me all God sent men stand on the same grounds the church don't send you God sends you listen if you standing on the church sent me or the church had me the church did me listen they could change on you all of the sudden like but when God sends you you come as an agent of the Holy Spirit and you know where you're standing see God needs men who know where they stand come on Church the problem with this America is not the Polish politicians the problem with this America is not your school teachers or your parents the problem with this America is weak pull pits well it's the truth that was a time homosexuality couldn't get in this America but a bunch of wimpy preachers backed up to it and the thing come in there was a time amen that Holiness was a standard in America but they formed denominations and the pullit crucified our Lord Jesus Christ they didn't hang him on a Roman Tree they put him on a wooden pull pit and they crucified him that's what the prophet said and he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of of our Lord he did not indict the people he indicted the church he indicted the pull pit for their crucifixion not of his flesh but of the effects of his word listen God needs somebody that knows where they stand he wants a man with an absolute brother Ram said what we need in a Methodist or a Baptist or a Pentecost or a Presbyterian Church is an absolute a man of God that will stand tied to the word and bring the congregation under that condition where each member walks in the condition of the word I don't care where you put him if a man ties himself to Christ as an absolute he'll bring those people under the right condition or they'll get rid of him God wants a man that knows what he's talking about I'm preaching to you God wants a man who knows what he's talking about do y'all know the Bible says that he had a man named Steven in the Bible he had a Steven in the Bible was a deacon and become [Applause] preacher Heen that's Fresh Off The Grill brother God had a man named stepen you know what they did they stoned that man you know why they stoned him because he told the truth [Music] he told the truth and they stoned him for it you remember what he done he preached against the elders didn't he he preached against the traditions and the elders and said you were circumcised heart and ears he said you do always resist the Holy Ghost and they took the tradition rather than the power of God and they killed the messenger to destroy his message and when they started stoning him the Bible said amen that he remember what he did amen he looked up into the the heavens cuzz that's where his message was coming from he didn't look to the San hedron he didn't look over at the elders and say if I change my mind will you quit stoning me but he looked up into heaven because that's where it was coming from and the Bible said when he looked he seen the heavens opened amen he knew the revelation of the Ascension work of Christ he seen the heavens opened and knew there was no barrier between him and God you can Stone me if you want to but just in a few minutes I'll be standing in the presence of my savior do you see what he did the Bible said his face shined like an angel brother said he was no angel CU angels Don't preach the gospel you know what he was he me his face shined like an angel brother B said it's because he knew what he was talking about he was so anointed because he knew where he was standing he knew what he was talking about he was an ambassador given and ordained of God with an authority to stand for God in the place of tragedy listen let me say something to you tonight amen I know people don't like amen now you people are of course you're and this tap public going all over the world right now there's people working against the moving of God they're working against the preaching of the Gospel but it's still the truth and you can bang on it and you can hit it and you can try to dismiss it but it's God's [Music] program do you know it's God's way to impart eternal life for I go unto the father and Greater Works than this you you do for I go Greater Works brother BR said greater than Jesus he said yes he said he didn't even preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but he gave it unto his disciples to impart eternal life by the preaching of the word of God brother you so you can't impart eternal life a Son of God can a Son of God can do you see now the prophet of God said inside of you is the supernatural outside of you is physical and if you're a spirit-led by God you become a messenger of God or an angel God's messenger God's angel it's the same word now who has more Authority an angel at the pull pit he said or an Angel that's in heaven a messenger at the pull pit or one in heaven see the angel Anointed with the holy spirit with the word stands next to God my goodness a man of God standing in the Pulpit Anointed with the word stands next to God God did not ordain an angel to preach to you tonight now I know it would be much more advantageous If I Was An Angel it would be more advantageous if your pastor brother Steven was an angel because then he wouldn't have any quirks it wouldn't be no peculiarities there wouldn't be no conflicts there would be no failures there would be no weaknesses there would be no place to criticize amen but God had Angels but he didn't choose them he had the son but he didn't choose it he had the stars but he didn't choose it he chose man with his weaknesses and his problems and when God wanted to save man he became man showing the work of redemption is through man Hallelujah somebody said well I wish an angel would appear to me and teach me do you know what the Bible says an angel came unto unto the house of Cornelius and told him go get Peter an angel came to his house and said go get Peter Cuz if you want eternal life it'll have to come my provided way go get Peter and Peter was up on the housetop and an angel appeared to him and said go preach the gospel Peter sees and looks and says Lord hey man I'm not going to I'm not going to eat anything unclean he said don't you start calling unclean what I have cleansed and he went down and preached the gospel to him the Bible said while he yet spake these words come on not while he had an alter call and and y'all know me I believe in alter Calla but it wasn't while the elders laid hands upon them it wasn't in the middle of the prayer line it wasn't at the altar but the Bible said while he yet spake these words that the Holy Ghost fell upon them God has ordained man for this purpose and he never changed it I'm reading direct quotes he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery not Mechanical Devices or Angelic beings it it's a man so what is what is the offices of God in this church it's God's dress wear it's God he gets dressed up inside an apostle a prophet a Seer Satan gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in the church these offices is his dress wear and when you see the office of a pastor or a teacher or an evangelist what is it that's God's dress wear God God's presence God's spirit working through that man listen let me can I can I just say it to you like this God unzips a man and he gets in him and then he Zips it back up and God puts on a tie and then he starts speaking through a man's mind and an anointing comes and he starts preaching things and you you think it's just a man but it's God dressed up in a body God is still speaking in this generation that we live God didn't die but God still speaks to man through man now you might say to me tonight you say well preacher you preached A good sermon it's not true Pastor you preached A good sermon it's not true brother B said he's speaking Holy Spirit speaks through mortal lips and he said these ministers and Brethren here he said you never preached a sermon in your life the Holy Spirit preached through you a sermon We Don't Preach the Holy Spirit does the speaking you might read something write it out and read it but preaching is when inspiration comes and preached by inspiration the holy spirit gives unction we can read something but it don't matter but when the Holy Spirit takes a hold of people something takes a hold that's not your pastor preaching that's the Holy Spirit preaching God is transmitting his voice I want to hear from God God is transmitting his voice through man amen now what is the reason for all this preaching direct quote what is the reason for all this preaching and teaching the teaching and preaching of the word that the sheep can hear the voice of God and follow it you say preacher I want to I want to hear the voice of God God could have chose to preach the gospel by Sun Moon Wind by nature but he chose man and the voice of God will come from there can you imagine tonight what the office of a Preacher well you want to be a president no the the Colin's not good enough I would not I would not trade in the calling to preach the gospel for any office in the world it is the highest office it is the highest order it is the highest way of life life it is the highest form to hear from God is to preach the gospel can I say to you tonight this bride will be the final voice to this age God has a voice in this bride well brother Wayne I thought once the message come that we could just play the tapes and the bride wouldn't have a Ministry do you recognize that the preachers didn't even have anything to preach till the message came [Music] you're telling me we have come to the greatest truth that has ever struck the Earth the seals that have been sealed from the foundation of the world truths that nobody has ever heard in their lives and God's going to reveal that and we ain't supposed to preach it but this ministry of the end time is a final voice to a final age and they become the messengers of God with the same message that they have heard and become a channel to speak the word of God they become not just preachers but they become conduits for the message of the hour we have been anointed to preach the same message and the same Angel accompanies this message just like it did in those days listen friends we are here tonight to recognize that we have come to another time to another Administration it is the administration of a New Covenant of a new dispensation it is the preaching of the Gospel stand your feet with me tonight if our musicians could come yes God could have done it any way he wanted to but he chose a preacher isn't that something God could have done it any way he wanted to but he chose this way right here it's God's way it's God's order you could come along in here on a Wednesday night you could be praying the Holy Spirit could come by speak directly to your KNE you is that just a preacher it's just a man but the message ain't me from the man that comes from God it's his word you be sitting this bill tonight say how am I ever going to get out of this listen Faith cometh by the hearing of the word have y'all ever noticed this when you start having trouble the first thing the devil attacks his church y'all ever notice that first thing little trouble comes up and and you watch this little trouble comes up and it's always around the pastor or his family always and then if he has to bring a little correction then then people try to find some other problem then they get a little upset right and then when they get upset I ain't going to pay my ti right it's a devil and then you know what he'll do he'll move you off the front put you on the back he'll do it and then you get a little colder and then it'll get right when you come to the end of the church instead of sticking around for the worship out the back door not to stand around and Shake everybody's hand but get in the car you know slip out next thing you know you start sitting out of churck church a little bit you know hallu what's all that about because it's the preaching of the Gospel that'll change your life and if Satan can can twist you away from that why is ministry under attack why is it so attacked why in the end time is the ministry so attack why is everything an attack on the ministry it's because it's God's Church chosen Channel and the enemy is trying to cut you off from the blessings that God would put in your life listen tonight I don't know why the Lord would send me here tonight to speak to you about this but I trust God would bless your soul tonight pray for your pastor pray for the preachers ask the Lord to raise up some men that'll stay with this word no matter what they do let's bow our hearts heav father we thank you tonight father maybe the one here tonight sitting here that father in their heart you've spoke to them somehow and I just pray Lord that you would bless them that you would give them Grace father as Faith cometh I pray Faith would come into that heart tonight to believe that you are able Lord to subdue all things as you have been raised up and you have pierced to all the sin and the doubt and the unbelief you've opened the heavens Lord that we might look to see you tonight that we could see you at the right hand we could see you set it in power and I pray tonight father that that power would be released in one of these lives now as we commit this congregation into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray hallelujah hallelujah I sure enjoyed that song and all my life what key y'all say I don't want to start could be a flat for [Music] me isn't it beautiful we love you the Lord God bless [Music]

see the goodness of God you ordained somebody to preach the gospel and to bring the word to you amen there are many errors that happen among the message rank some of the Elder fought good after a while the air or they made some statement that were contrary to the word of God instead of staying to the word a door open up where we got Forum we got group chats online on Facebook on Instagram on many platform where people talk about preachers very lightly all over the message all over the world that's right I'm saying what God put in my heart and I have to say it amen amen so it become easy you will see even young people sitting and they just talk about preachers until the respect of the ministry went completely down and the people feel like they entitle Amen to speak about a pastor or somebody and sometime you don't even know the story and the scripture say you should never take an accusation against an elder without how many witness two or three witness in other word if you hear something about a pastor you should not believe it am amen until you got witness amen and the Bible never stop there the Bible say and those witness must be proven amen am amen am and you will find yourself in a big trouble when you hear two three years later on the true version of the story and it was completely different than what you hear there are things that I will go to heaven with it even my wife would not know and this God built me since I was a deacon my wife is there I never came home and then tell my wife what we spoke in the Deacon office my wife is there never my wife could hear some something from somebody and ask me and I say who told you that because I know it I don't even tell you amen so there are things that I will go to heaven with it I'm not saying I'm going to die with it because there is a promise that not everybody will die amen I will go to heaven with it so no matter how much you want me to prove something there are certain things because I'm a pastor I will never open that to you amen and because I do not open that to you you will never know the true story about something I'm going to take a simple example if it's brother Charles tells me something and I know exactly what it is and you see brother Charles misbehaving he can misbehave all he want he knows that I'm not going to say it because I'm under commission as a Pastor to keep it and as long as I don't say it you will never know the truth unless brother Charles repent and tell you that brother Sten brother Wayne was correct because if I speak it I'm breaking like a covenant that I have with God so the reason why I'm saying that is regardless of how much you're going to heal be careful you don't know the full story you're going to judge a man of God you're going to temper into something that you don't know what I will encourage the church as always I remind you of every Sunday put your head in the word I went to a reception and I got there and I saw people and they asked me they say did you hear what happened over there I say I don't know they say really I said I don't know I said my mind I mean I need even time to read brother Bram I don't know what time do you have to be listening to everything that is going on I say I don't know they asked my wife my wife say we don't know in the word I keep my head focused on the word that's why you begin that's when you begin to see things in the scripture that other people probably don't see because you keep yourself line up into the word if somebody calls you and begin to talk about a preacher push a break tell him hey slow down and not only preacher even one another because we are God's children amen you don't know what preachers suffer to bring the word of God here you'll be sleeping snoring the preacher can't sleep 3:00 a.m. in the morning they got to wake up they got to stay away from their family away from their children I mean cooked up in the room somewhere just trying to get the mind of God be careful if they put you here you don't know what it takes you say they're sweating come here and you feel what we feeling when we are here it takes the grace of God to even stand here to talk to you we are unworthy to be talking to you we are completely unworthy to be talking to you you get here you do the best that you can you say God at least help me to say exactly what you want to say because I don't want to be held accountable and the day you want to preach you will see how much the devil is fighting left and right we already got used to that so Church stay with the word appreciate the ministry appreciate those that God bring here the brothers here sisters Church appreciate and stay focused stay away from hearing this and there commenting this and sitting there in dinner and go over you know this you know this you don't know what's going on when we meet with preacher we can talk between us and we can tell one another look at this look at this look at this and it finish between the preacher and we move forward everybody got it God cannot speak the way he spoke here for nothing the rain will never come back without our watering something amen amen amen we are most privileged and you are here to preach the gospel you might be a lady not to preach on a Pulpit but your life is a gospel amen Amen brother Wayne did I tell you to talk about Steven here so I'm saying that to remove some of the cloud away amen he feel led I never tell a preacher what to preach here because I know you are instructed you've been taught in the word let the preacher give them Liberty and let the Holy Spirit take over and we always get blessed over and over brother Wayne thank you for the sacrifice thank you for everything let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy Lord and for everything you're doing for us because you heard our prayer father we pray throughout the day for you to speak to us as we always pray because we want to hear from thee and when an aspiration is coming from heaven we know that it's God speaking directly to us it is no different than that safe the Lord father we could be waiting to hear from someone speaking in tongue or prophesying maybe waiting for a vision or maybe waiting for an audible voice but the highest form that you can reveal yourself s is the word the word takes care of everything Lord and your word came tonight and speak to this congregation and to your children worldwide Lord father may you strengthen your man servant Lord I know how he labor and being a pastor now it is not easy Lord but father if you saw him fit Lord to enter that office of a pastor you already equip him Lord enough to give him sufficient Grace Lord to pull the portion of the Brad that he have under his supervision all the way to make it to the Rapture Lord may you strengthen him and his family and may you bless this church Lord such a wonderful congregation where we can come and fellowship with people of light precious Faith Lord we might be Lord rubbing the shoulder with the word but we know that it's Wednesday it's time to go to church it's time that we going to hear the word of God it's time that we going to go out we will shake hand we will fellowship with people that believe exactly the way we do Lord father we thank you for one another and we thank you for the ministry may you protect us Lord and give us travel Mercy as we go into our respective Place Lord father remove every work of the devil away from us and I know Lord father the day following the sermon the devil usually want to attack your children but father I claim the blood upon your servant Lord father that you protect him Lord and as he's making his way way back to Ohio Lord give him a safe journey may he goes Lord and take rest Lord and reach his family back safe Lord we humbly ask it and commit everything unto the and ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you can continue
