[0:01] River boy he really foretold America
[0:04] didn't
[0:05] he now we find out that in doing so then
[0:10] there was a man that had some wisdom
[0:12] about him come up and counsel with the
[0:14] King he said the thing to do is
[0:17] excommunicate her and sent out to the
[0:21] nation and calling all the virgins that
[0:23] there is young virgins and there pick
[0:26] yourself a wife it pleased the king so
[0:29] he sent and he sent out the chambermaids
[0:32] and so forth that went out to to pick
[0:34] all the young virgins that the beautiful
[0:36] women throughout all the kingdoms and
[0:39] the provinces that he was over which was
[0:41] the greatest in the world and when he
[0:43] did it come to this little Jewish girl
[0:46] she was rather a kind of an
[0:49] offcast the caus like the Gentiles you
[0:51] see she was cast off to one side and she
[0:54] had no father and mother Mori her uncle
[0:58] was Raising her
[1:00] and she had to go to qualify and so what
[1:03] they did they had to take these girls in
[1:05] for purification for so many months they
[1:08] had to perfume them and do all kinds of
[1:10] an adorning and fix them all up so they
[1:12] could go before the king that's just
[1:15] about the way the world wants to fix the
[1:17] church
[1:19] today darn it up with the
[1:22] world pattern after the things of the
[1:25] world trying to get more members taking
[1:28] in anything in their Fellowship
[1:32] it's a pitiful thing one organization
[1:36] trying to beat the other and take
[1:37] anything in for a
[1:39] member you might take them in this
[1:41] organization but they'll never come into
[1:43] the fellowship of Christ until they're
[1:45] cleaned up and born again how the spirit
[1:47] of God it's
[1:50] true they might have their name on a
[1:52] book here but not up there the Lamb's
[1:54] Book of Life till it's wrote with the
[1:56] blood of the Lord
[1:58] Jesus all the women
[2:00] they fix themselves all up to look
[2:02] pretty and oh I imagine they got really
[2:05] some looks on them maybe after the first
[2:07] lady and so forth they got themselves
[2:09] all fixed up because is going to appear
[2:12] before the king I think that's about the
[2:14] whole lot's getting the matter with our
[2:15] churches today they're trying to fix
[2:18] themselves all up worldly having worldly
[2:20] entertainment worldly things in it doing
[2:23] things that's all of the world
[2:25] associating in the world thinking they
[2:27] can meet the king God don't care about
[2:30] that he hates that
[2:35] right but we want to act like the
[2:38] world some of our churches have said L
[2:41] down the bars Tak
[2:44] in and so

[54:57] our
[54:59] scripture he's the same God
[55:04] tonight blessed be the name of the
[55:10] Lord Okay the third
[55:15] verse then I went down to the Porter's
[55:20] house and behold he wrote a work on the
[55:24] wheels
[55:26] the vessel that he
[55:28] made of the clay was
[55:34] mared in the hand of the
[55:43] porter so he made it again another
[55:45] vessel as seemed good to the porters to
[55:48] make
[55:49] it amen
[55:52] amen verse
[55:57] then the word of the Lord came to me
[56:00] [Music]
[56:13] saying oh House of Israel cannot that
[56:17] cannot I do with you as this Porter say
[56:21] the Lord behold as the clay is in the
[56:23] Porter's hand so are ye in man hand oh
[56:27] House of
[56:37] Israel at what in I shall speak
[56:40] concerning a nation and concerning a
[56:42] kingdom to plug up and to pull down and
[56:45] to
[56:53] destroy
[56:55] if that Nation against whom I have
[56:57] pronounced turn from their evil I will
[57:00] repent of the evil that I thought to
[57:02] doto
[57:09] them and at what in stand I speak I
[57:13] shall speak concerning a nation and
[57:15] concerning a kingdom to build and to
[57:18] plant
[57:22] [Music]
[57:23] it
[57:27] [Music]
[57:31] if it do evil in my S that he obey not
[57:35] my voice then I will repent of the good
[57:37] wherewith I said I will benefit them
[57:41] amen
[57:42] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[57:45] his
[57:48] word based on our scripture that we read
[57:53] tonight my subject tonight will
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] be the background and the shape of the
[58:04] porters vessel amen
[58:09] amen the background and the shape of the
[58:13] porters
[58:15] vessel
[58:16] amen when we speak about a
[58:20] background we speaking about something
[58:23] that is a foundation a
[58:26] it is
[58:28] Faith it is the
[58:33] foundation for those who are
[58:37] trading we usually call that the working
[58:40] capital amen
[58:44] amen that's my definition according
[58:48] concerning
[58:50] background it's something that is
[58:53] real
[58:55] and usually you don't see it amen with
[58:58] our naked eye
[59:00] amen and then the form or the
[59:05] shape this is something that BR the
[59:08] attraction of
[59:11] people it's an exterior appearance of a
[59:15] body or
[59:16] something it's the image that we usually
[59:18] see with our naked
[59:21] eye you will see people who goes to
[59:23] movie theater
[59:30] they could have when they're making a
[59:31] drama they have a background
[59:37] behind and then they will be working on
[59:39] the back to make sure the SC will appear
[59:43] good and it's something that is really
[59:46] kind of
[59:47] deceiving that's what they call by
[59:50] having the shape or the form amen amen
[59:55] so so the
[1:00:00] vessel it's something that the porters
[1:00:05] make it it could be maybe a plate or it
[1:00:09] could be maybe a
[1:00:13] vehicle like God who is our Porter maybe
[1:00:17] created man or created an animal or
[1:00:20] created a
[1:00:23] bird what I'm referring to when I say
[1:00:28] vessel it's something that a Creator
[1:00:30] have made amen
[1:00:35] amen and according to the scripture that
[1:00:37] we
[1:00:41] read God spoke to the Prophet
[1:00:45] Jeremiah and he told
[1:00:50] Jeremiah he said today Jeremiah I'm not
[1:00:53] going to use the law the book of of the
[1:00:54] Lord to preach to you in the
[1:00:57] temple today I'm not going to preach
[1:00:59] from the
[1:01:02] scripture because when you in church you
[1:01:05] take note you are writing things down
[1:01:06] today that's not my
[1:01:08] sermon glory to
[1:01:11] God but today my preaching I'm going to
[1:01:14] take you somewhere you going to the
[1:01:16] Porter's
[1:01:18] house all I want you to do there is to
[1:01:21] observe I want you to watch
[1:01:25] and pay attention to what the pter is
[1:01:27] doing amen
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:34] amen and the Lord told him arise and go
[1:01:36] to the Porter's house and he went
[1:01:39] down and we know that a house
[1:01:42] represented a family as
[1:01:46] Welles a house may represent a
[1:01:50] community he can even represent a nation
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:56] amen and that's the place that God sent
[1:02:00] Jeremiah to go and learn or get some
[1:02:05] instructions based on his observation of
[1:02:09] what the porters was
[1:02:13] doing and he told him that day I will
[1:02:15] cause you to hear my
[1:02:17] words in other word I'm going to teach
[1:02:20] you there amen
[1:02:23] amen I'm going to show you
[1:02:29] something and
[1:02:32] behold the pter was working on
[1:02:42] something now Jeremiah is giving us the
[1:02:45] description he says that I went to the
[1:02:47] Porter's house and here he's working on
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:53] vessel
[1:02:55] and Jeremiah gave us more instruction he
[1:02:58] said when I got there the vessels that
[1:03:00] the pter was working on got Mar amen
[1:03:09] amen the same way that the clay is in
[1:03:12] the hands of the
[1:03:14] Porter and he noticed that the porter
[1:03:17] took it and then work with the clay over
[1:03:20] and made another
[1:03:23] vessel
[1:03:26] so let me expand it a little bit when he
[1:03:28] got to the Porter's house Jeremiah
[1:03:30] noticed
[1:03:33] this he found the P
[1:03:37] working and what he was
[1:03:41] doing it didn't
[1:03:44] work it is not Jeremiah who noticed
[1:03:48] that it is the P that noticed that
[1:03:52] whatever he was making was
[1:03:55] working in other word it was not a good
[1:03:58] image it was not a good
[1:04:01] shape I'm talking about the P follow
[1:04:05] me I'm starting with a natural P until I
[1:04:08] get to the spiritual P which is
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:12] God the god that knows who you are amen
[1:04:18] amen God who created you knows exactly
[1:04:21] the defect in your
[1:04:23] life
[1:04:24] he knows the imperfection of your
[1:04:28] life God
[1:04:30] knows and God will work things
[1:04:34] over tonight he will work things over
[1:04:37] amen amen
[1:04:43] hallelujah and he noticed that the P
[1:04:45] make another vessel different according
[1:04:48] to his

[1:15:26] to block Jesus
[1:15:29] from they're trying to trap him to see

[1:19:38] down and I want to say
[1:19:41] this when we mention when they mention
[1:19:44] that a tree in the Bible symb it usually
[1:19:49] symbolizes people amen
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:54] maybe a man or a woman but it's just
[1:19:56] symbolizing a human
[1:19:58] being because we are we were created to

[1:20:27] amen it means the House of
[1:20:33] Joy and sometime it's also call The
[1:20:37] House of the poor
[1:20:39] people why the house of
[1:20:43] poor because Lazarus was living there
[1:20:46] as and they were calling him poor he was
[1:20:51] living there too amen
[1:20:55] amen which were closer to the mountain
[1:20:58] of

[1:21:09] having
[1:21:10] leaves having
[1:21:15] leaves he came if happily he might find

[1:21:19] there and when he came to
[1:21:23] he found nothing but
[1:21:25] Le for the time of fig was not
[1:21:29] yet now let's take the
[1:21:32] word Jesus answered and
[1:21:36] say unto it no man eat fruit of thee
[1:21:39] here
[1:21:41] forever and his disciple heard it amen

[1:22:11] testimony he wants you to do something
[1:22:13] in your
[1:22:15] life so that you can bring more souls
[1:22:17] unto
[1:22:20] him in Revelation chapter
[1:22:25] 22:2 the Bible refer to the
[1:22:30] tree which is speaking about the Tree of
[1:22:34] Life the tree of life which is by the
[1:22:38] river and that tree of
[1:22:41] life and it's giving
[1:22:43] fruit every single
[1:22:46] month in other word every month you can
[1:22:49] go to that tree
[1:22:50] and there was no season to that tree
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:57] amen because to God there is no
[1:23:00] season God is the
[1:23:03] Creator and you are a part of God in
[1:23:06] other way you are God am amen and you
[1:23:10] will
[1:23:12] notice when God created all
[1:23:16] things he created everything that
[1:23:19] existed when he finished his creation
[1:23:23] he created
[1:23:25] man he created he
[1:23:27] for and he sent him on the
[1:23:30] earth when he placed men on the
[1:23:37] garden God never violated his
[1:23:41] law to come down on
[1:23:44] Earth to do to do whatever he want to
[1:23:48] do without first negotiating with Adam
[1:23:51] amen amen
[1:23:54] God cannot do anything without
[1:23:57] Man Without he deal first with
[1:24:01] men the children of Israel were in
[1:24:05] Egypt God never came down himself to
[1:24:08] deliver them
[1:24:10] why because God knew that the
[1:24:14] Earth and everything within the Earth
[1:24:18] was given to his
[1:24:20] children I gave it to my
[1:24:24] that's why you know you will
[1:24:25] see God came to Moses
[1:24:28] first to speak to
[1:24:31] Moses you need to go back over there
[1:24:35] amen everything that is in the
[1:24:38] scpt when God want to do something he
[1:24:41] will first speak to
[1:24:43] man when he want to destroy Sodom and
[1:24:46] [Applause]
[1:24:47] gomorra he said
[1:24:50] what I must talk to somebody get I must
[1:24:54] discuss with
[1:24:56] somebody and God was coming
[1:24:59] down and when came down you know the
[1:25:02] story to
[1:25:03] Abraham after he finished eating he
[1:25:07] says shall I hide anything to
[1:25:11] Abraham why because he cannot violate
[1:25:14] his own law am
[1:25:17] amen and Abraham understood his position
[1:25:22] that canot do anything without
[1:25:25] negotiating without asking me
[1:25:30] permission since God have a portion in
[1:25:32] this man I also have my
[1:25:36] portion and the portion of Abraham
[1:25:39] was he had his nephew locked up there he
[1:25:44] was and he begin to
[1:25:47] intercede oh God what about if you have
[1:25:50] so many people are you going to save the
[1:25:51] city
[1:25:53] and then he keep going down with the
[1:25:56] number
[1:25:59] until he found a
[1:26:02] number he was a small
[1:26:06] number and God no and God Char take no a
[1:26:12] lot out of Sodom and bring
[1:26:15] judgment all of that is to show you God
[1:26:18] cannot do anything without dealing with
[1:26:22] but you men you don't know your
[1:26:24] position amen
[1:26:27] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:26:31] Lord so Jesus was
[1:26:36] hungry and Jesus noticed a far off a fig
[1:26:43] tree Jesus didn't see a field full of
[1:26:47] fig
[1:26:49] trees he didn't see several of
[1:26:55] them he didn't see a big
[1:26:58] farm he only saw one fig
[1:27:03] tree because one fig tree
[1:27:07] means god is dealing individually with
[1:27:12] people two sleeping in the bed they will
[1:27:15] take one and leave the other amen
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:22] people with nation he deal with us
[1:27:25] individually
[1:27:28] amen and he saw one fig
[1:27:31] tree and thate was maybe a person are
[1:27:37] symbolizing because we know trees in the
[1:27:40] scriptures talk
[1:27:41] about and when Jesus looked a far
[1:27:47] off he saw that the tree look
[1:27:51] beautiful he have the appearance the
[1:27:54] shape the
[1:27:57] form the beauty that the Fig Tre was
[1:28:01] displaying attracted Jesus Christ like
[1:28:04] he could
[1:28:05] find and as Jesus was
[1:28:07] hry Jesus was expecting that when I get
[1:28:10] there I'm going to find fruit and I will
[1:28:15] eat but what happened when he get
[1:28:20] there he to check the Fig Tree and find
[1:28:23] out that there is no
[1:28:26] fruit that's why I told
[1:28:30] you maybe there are people coming to
[1:28:32] this
[1:28:34] church they might see all the
[1:28:38] appearances but when they come
[1:28:43] in if he doesn't find somebody who's
[1:28:46] interested into
[1:28:48] them maybe people who don't know God
[1:28:55] and they want somebody to show interest
[1:28:57] toward
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:28:59] them somebody who can talk to them about
[1:29:02] the message of the
[1:29:05] hour when he
[1:29:07] come he hear the pastor preaching it's a
[1:29:11] good
[1:29:12] thing but nobody approaches them later
[1:29:14] on and the people will leave and go amen
[1:29:19] amen you will maybe meet someone
[1:29:24] and you will see people coming to your
[1:29:25] house to visit
[1:29:27] you but after while all of them goes
[1:29:30] away you wonder why are people have I
[1:29:34] done something wrong yes there is
[1:29:36] something

[2:01:11] Soul she went back to her
[2:01:14] City and she won
[2:01:18] Souls verse
[2:01:20] 39 and
[2:01:22] listen many of the
[2:01:25] Samaritans of that
[2:01:28] City believe on
[2:01:32] him the saying of the
[2:01:35] woman the
[2:01:37] woman which testify he told me all that
[2:01:41] I ever
[2:01:43] did in your
[2:01:46] neighborhood never talk about Jesus
[2:01:51] when you are in at school you don't even
[2:01:53] talk about you don't even mention about
[2:01:57] J but this woman brought a lot of people
[2:02:00] to
[2:02:01] God that's why Jesus even cursed
[2:02:05] the because the tree didn't have
[2:02:08] fruit there are many things that we
[2:02:11] could go
[2:02:13] over but uh time is have a great
[2:02:17] jealousy so we will pick it up later on
[2:02:20] amen
[2:02:22] amen and Jesus cursed the
[2:02:25] tree because the
[2:02:30] tree never gave the
[2:02:32] fruit and it was
[2:02:35] written if you don't bear
[2:02:39] fruit because every
[2:02:41] tree that doesn't bring forth fruit it
[2:02:45] will be you now and being cast Into the
[2:02:48] Fire
[2:02:50] we read
[2:02:52] somewhere that when you don't
[2:02:55] eat you will be
[2:02:57] weak you will lose
[2:03:01] weight that's a natural
[2:03:03] food but what
[2:03:06] about spiritual
[2:03:09] food one week you don't come to J two
[2:03:12] weeks you don't
[2:03:14] come a habit for you church for not
[2:03:18] going to church
[2:03:19] word how are you going to be
[2:03:22] strong it means that death is oing in
[2:03:25] amen
[2:03:27] amen that's why
[2:03:29] we God say move a
[2:03:32] mountain you are unable even to move a
[2:03:35] mountain am
[2:03:37] amen why is the mountain not
[2:03:41] moving because you don't have the
[2:03:44] substance all you have is the
[2:03:47] appearance you can speak
[2:03:50] well you can pray very
[2:03:52] well you can even say letter very good
[2:03:57] but if you don't
[2:03:58] have you don't have the
[2:04:01] foundation that will give you power that
[2:04:04] will give you pray
[2:04:05] power nothing will
[2:04:08] happen that's why there are many things
[2:04:11] when we are
[2:04:12] praying nothing is
[2:04:15] happening there are people who did many
[2:04:18] works
[2:04:20] in the name of Jesus
[2:04:22] Christ but they met certain
[2:04:25] things they met certain
[2:04:28] demon they say you know what we know
[2:04:30] Paul we know
[2:04:32] Jesus we know Jesus we know Paul
[2:04:36] but we don't know you who are you no
[2:04:40] substance they spoke the
[2:04:44] word in the name of Jesus Christ that
[2:04:46] Paul
[2:04:47] preach but that
[2:04:50] declaration didn't have a a background a
[2:04:53] foundation a substance behind it in
[2:04:58] them that's why it didn't
[2:05:03] work that's why when you want to move a
[2:05:06] mountain the mountain is not
[2:05:10] moving but tonight we are at the Porter
[2:05:14] House he is the one that gave life
