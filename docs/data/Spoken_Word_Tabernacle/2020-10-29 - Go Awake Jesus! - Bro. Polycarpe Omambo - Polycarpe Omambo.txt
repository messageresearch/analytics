there was a soul somewhere God that make the promise he made you a promise more than able to bring it to pass God cannot bring you somewhere and leave you alone yes the storm will come situation will come but God is always there he had a mission he had to save the he knew that he was a seed he was a seed what the case may be that he was in the chain he was in Cemetery doesn't matter the time that the true shepher that he he h fear of that he remember he had to go to that Soul that's why he told let's go to the other side but the discip pic like you and me in front of a situation we are panick when the sickness comes when he trouble we are panic when people say that in this that you cannot live in this state that you cannot succeed but it's not the last of Jesus it's not the last of your God the last word of the king of kings he has the final word he said let's go to the other side the disciple had they work him up and finally he he was awake and what did he do he became to calm the

have to call him on the scene he must be on scene he's a specialist of all cases there is no cases in front of him remember Lazarus he was dead they bury him it was four days past amen amen but what is your condition I do not know maybe a part of your body it's not working properly I do not know the prophet say somewhere here he's saying something here that the Lord is the creator of your body 144 in the same message go awake Jesus he says this let's also remember that he is the one that created our bodies has to obey to him and will not him this awake Jesus to on the SC are you afraid to do it are you afraid to awake it to awake the defeat of Jes the prophet is tell for the same way that he created and Earth he created the big wat all that exist that you know he also created your body and he come to your body something in your body but called him he's the creator of he knows of all that you consist of all that you compos all that your body has compos he able he able he's able to create cells in body are dead regard us what they have deced in this States right now in this age right now that you cannot do this you cannot do that anymore no matter what the medical may sayto you Jesus he that created your body who that created you he able to he's able to restore all amen are we read the paragraph 183 he found that he was by the word and by the signs that the word and the sign they were perfectly confined that he was that he was he said if I don't do the works that so don't don't believe me if I do the words about believe that I'm telling you the truth in that subject that what we have today he said that you search those speak of me and they that he was the God of All creat Creations that he could also create because he created all things amen the time that for him to be there the Creator was laying down there he has shown that he had the power over all those things he believed in those they have forgot that he was with them like you and me maybe forgot that he in your body amen forgot in your body when Daniel knew that he was in his body glory to God Danel knew that was in his body told him throw you in the theni knew that the creator of the lion was in him when he came to the to the Lions the Lions had afraid of of who theator was inel that's why Dan could not have any fear when in the of fire yes our God is able to deliver us amen amen because they knew there is unchanging fire that are consuming fire in you tonight he will take not have fear of s no fear of magician no fear of anything because the consuming fire is in you is in you there a song that we sing sometimes he Abid he Abid but he Abid in you the Creator who abides in you it's not the Bible that you the Bible is not God the Bible the word of God God in a letter form God is the word Jus is the word that's the same word that's dwelling in you it's the same word that AB in you you will not have fear of anybody you will not have fear of situations hallelujah hallelujah amen [Applause] amen amen if the wind and the see obey him and Lazarus who was dead was resurrected how can you believe the word of God it's himself he is able to give you life if you have a part of your body that is suffering by by sickness no matter what the situation in Jesus Christ there is no failure Amen in Jesus there's no failure one day brother Bram he went to a trip from California to Louisiana he was driving on his road and there was a brother that bought him a suit and he had all his luggage in his car so as he was going and suddenly the luggage came out and brother brand reached his destination he didn't find his luggage oh glory be to God and a brother told him he said brother don't worry about it we going to buy for you new clothes we're going to buy for you new clothes brother Bram said don't worry about it I don't want you to spend money the Lord will take care of it and he told him and then we going to pick him up he said if somebody pick up the clothes and the Lord saw it so maybe the Lord found out that that person need clothes amen but I believe the Lord he will do something about it the place where brother Bram lost his luggage they told him that there that's a black community and there is no way they're going to steal it they're going to use your clothes and brother Bram replied he said my Bible stand there everything is in there and then and then the Lord will take care of it if somebody needs it and brother Bram kept his faith to what he was speaking and one day two days and brother Bram suddenly saw somebody bringing him his all luggage where he was and when they bought him he was a black man that brought him the luggage those that was supposed to take the one that they thought he's going to steal it was the one that actually brought it the thoughts of men are not the thoughts of God when you come to God you cannot have failure no matter the situation God doesn't know failure he never have failure and what belongs to you nobody can take it God will take care of everything God can take care of everything amen hallelujah amen many things and I'm trying to skip okay most of the time when somebody is climbing higher and they usually come to trials amen amen to prove to you that our pastor right here he never was a pastor before he was a deacon but he must go to trials he must go through a lot of trouble God for him to bring you to a high God to take you to a higher position even sickness amen I'm going to go slowly Lord help me help us Lord Lord give me your anointing and give the pastor my interpreter the anointing Lord bring us to a higher Dimension together and bring the church together we need your presence tonight we know that you here we want be in the Heavenly place BR in Jesus precious name amen amenu hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord no matter how high you are spiritually let me tell you something the word of God say that you will go through trials but you must prepare yourself knowing that after the trials remember the weeks that are passed already Pastor has been laboring in the Book of Esther do you know what would have happened to Esther do you know the trial that Mal went through I'm going to go quickly I believe it's Esther chapter 4 I'm going to read one or three verses I believe 15 to 17 I'm not going to comment on the pastor already preached about it the Bible says this perceive all that was done that's Esther chapter 4 verse one Mor rent his clothes and put on sack cloth with ashes and Ashes and went into the midst of the city and cry with a l for and be the cry be the cry and came even before the king for none might enter into the king's gate closed with s CL with sth CLA and in every Province whichsoever the king's commandment and his decree came and his decree came there was great mouring among the Jews and fasting and weeping and Welling and many lay in s clothes and Ashes now I'm going to drop to verse 15 then Esther B them return Mori answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in ch and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my men will fast like with my maidens and so will I go into the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish amen you heard it there was a trial they were about to kill all the Jews because the enemy of the Jews hon he had that conspiracy to kill them all but how did God destroy that plan when Mor heard about it he sent a message to Queen no matter if you live in a Royal Palace or not don't think you're going to be spared because you also are a Jew you got to take care of us you must speak to the king and Es told him it has been a long time I never went to the king and it's not according to the custom so this is what we're going to be doing we're going to get into prayer we're going to speak to our God we going to go high we going to climb and speak to the Lord now tonight we going to speak to the Lord and they fasted and then they watch three days it changed the entire situation it changed the entire situation and that same God is here tonight that same God is here tonight let me tell you something remember Esther all those people in the Old Testament they had no reference like we have today they didn't have any reference in the Bible to cling onto God like we doing today but on suay the pastor showed us that everything that was written in the Old Testament was for our learning and instruction he was for our instructions to prepare us that's the reason why we come to church and the pastor is teaching us to prepare us to Tempest because Tri will come but we're not going to suum God did say we going to fail God didn't say that you will fail he never say that hallelujah hallelujah if you look at the life of Jesus Christ he said when every higher position can even his own son was not spared every time you go into a higher position he brings always Tri if God have something good in you there will be a trial in your life know that God is with you God have confidence in you that's why Trials come the Bible says that there is no trial that is going to be greater than your power hallu Hallelujah in Matthew chapter 26 3839 Mar Mark 14 3436 Mark 1534 you can see the trial of Jesus before the name of Jesus Christ be above every other name had to come in his life the same prayer if it's possible for the Lord to take the cup way let's read even Something [Music] Matthew Matthew chapter 26 I'm going to read quickly Matthew 26 yes M verse 36 the word of the Lord says this the Bible doesn't declare this glory be to God because most of the time we say the Bible say no the Bible is a book but it's the word of God declaring it's God speaking amen may the Lord help us to correct that the Bible says this the word of the Lord says this then came Jesus 38 actually then said he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death you here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face fell on his face and pray saying oh my father if it be possible let this pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as th will amen amen this is Jesus Christ himself 100% man and 100% God this is before he said Lord if you can spare me from this cup to show you that trial is not again but how did he overcame amen hallelujah hallelujah let me take Mark Mark 15:34 if you can allow me to 1534 and and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying which is being interpreted my God my God why has Thou forsaken me do You Realize here in the in the situation Jesus found himself in he even cried that was a hard trial that was a hard trial and every time he came back he always found his disciples felling asleep those that he called them to pray for him he John Peter and James to help him to pray but they could not even support him in their praying he prayed alone because he had to face the devil because he had to face the enemy because he had to face death amen amen and he was able to embrace death his enemy that's how he overcame and you will notice that that Jesus Christ went in G and when he was in G and he was in G that's why we pray that's why we we we surrender that's why we we look for for for power for strength and he was praying in Geth like Peter never experienced that he didn't have a Gest in his no his own life that's why he became killing people cutting people's ear he cut the ear of someone and he denied the Lord Jesus Christ three times why did he do it because when he was time for prayer when Jesus told them to prayer never pray he was always sleeping but when Jesus stay awake he was able to sustain trial he was able to go and then have Judah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah take Philippians chapter 2 verse 9 I want you to to show you something there I want you to see that Jesus before every higher position in your life they always come with trial why is the name of Jesus Christ above every other name why if you are home you can start by verse three you can do your own reading at home I'm going to take eight and n to show you he humbled himself and then being obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him you see now the condition be before you are highly elevated before you become exalted and gave him a name which is above every name so that in heaven on the earth underneath the Earth every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord remember now we don't have three Gods we don't have two Gods there is only one God when Jesus Christ came work like a son amen he was in the office of a son or the one who was in heaven because he T his disciple nobody went to heaven except the son of man who came down from heaven because in the Old Testament Isaiah 35 and so forth is Isaiah promised that Emmanuel the cons shall come someone who will heal someone who will resurrect people someone who will deliver people that person was God himself coming down they never say God Son they say the almighty God and we saw the almighty God veil in Jesus Christ that's the reason why his word declared in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead badly now watch the person who was God in flesh AC he accepted to play the part of a son AC he accepted to be humiliated AC he accepted to die at the death of the Cross which is a horrible death when crucify someone usually they are cursed people but he accepted that place that's the reason why in Philippian 2 the Bible says that after all of this after being humbled that's why his name was exalted above all name that's just to show you that sooner your exaltation is coming but through trial and When Trials come what do you have to do you must awake the master you must Shake him up you must Shake him up you got to tell him Lord I perishing look at my situation maybe I'm married I don't have a child but you spoken your word that in your house there won't be any parent woman but I
