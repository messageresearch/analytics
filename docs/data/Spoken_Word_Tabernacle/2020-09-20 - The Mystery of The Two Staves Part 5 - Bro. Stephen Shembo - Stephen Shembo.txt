have you got one sister what you got come on up and then we'll bring sister olga amen amen hi church the service that brother kelly preached on wednesday was speaking to me a lot of you don't know i lost my grandmother about a year and a half ago and i was grieving i'm the oldest for my mom's i was dealing with her she's the only child so i was internalizing it in february i was told i had fluid on my heart the end of february beginning of march they thought it was partial pneumonia but brother kelly answered it on wednesday you're going through cycles in your life the devil is trying to attack your body and i my husband praying my in-laws praying held on to the faith and when i released it they can't find anything god bless you hallelujah hallelujah that was a wonderful message wednesday night amen god bless you i want to give praise to god because he protected us while we were coming we almost had a car wreck every morning before we leave the house we always pray but this morning we were late so we did not pray this morning [Music] um while we were coming my son noticed that on the on the screen you know how that um that knife the tower light comes on it was on a sun community the calmness that my son had uh in times like this i was screamed but i didn't scream there was such a presence in the vehicle that he pulled us to the side that's the reason why i want to glorify you i don't know what would have happened but thank be to god hallelujah glory praise the lord uh we gotta make no more noise in them okay amen amen amen god bless you saints um i have a testament money too um [Music] which night was it i was up praying and while i was praying i was struggling um for a breakthrough i mean i'm praying i'm falling asleep i get up and wash my face i go back and i took my book and i started to read the word i read judith brown of me and you know just to find out it was the same time my son was heading home and he was just trying to be a friend to a friend going through trial and tired coming home and as he made the turn past the exit he run off and hit the tree and um anyway to god be the glory he pulled himself off the car he heard the crackling and here he pulled himself out the police came and pulled him away from it so thank god for saving his life the car burned to char but he is well and today he's in the hospital um he has many surgeries but right now he was able to move from the bed to the wheelchair so he'll be going home and i just want to give god all the praise and the glory for keeping him the enemy's been after him and this is not his first accident he flipped him about maybe listed about three times now he's been going after him but i gotta give this there was a time when he was a kid that i prayed for him i was giving trouble in school in my eyes and i prayed and i saw god put a cage around that child so i know it came back and i know that god is reaching out to him he's giving him a second chance and he must give his life to christ and i'm just letting god have his way and give him the glory and thanks amen amen hallelujah god is good he hears the prayers of a mother right amen anybody else with the praise report and then we'll move on and see if anybody has a prayer request we'll keep him on his jermaine right keep him on our prayer list i'm sure we all have children and family members that we would like to see come to christ as well without being jerked through a knothole you know but we want god's will if he does if he has to do that you know sometimes those knotholes make a bigger impression than just coming in you know we got jerked through a couple anybody have a prayer request yes ma'am um okay okay so let's remember um brother robert's sister annette for um leg surgery this week correct okay anybody else i lost a friend of mine from the military this week apparently this man's 30 years in the air force made it to chief master sergeant several tours in probably in afghanistan and iraq and he was home alone he's younger than i but he was home alone and fell and suffered a i think they said a hemorrhage of a subdural hematola is that what you call it and he bled for a while before anybody came home and uh his white blood count was so low that his body couldn't recover the blood wouldn't clot and they lost him this week it's reunited you know three or four guys including myself that had worked together back in the 80s in grand forks north dakota and uh you know it kind of made us regret not keeping in touch we were a close unit back then but um his name was jim finley so his you know his family's grieving a little bit a little bit i'm sure they're grieving a lot but let's go to him um but charles you mind coming up and going to the i got faith in your prayer brother i have confidence come on up as brother kelly says i'm sure he'll hear you amen god bless you yes sir or anybody having an unspoken prayer request gracious heavenly father we thank

about any special so just be seated please and if anybody has one you got one sister um zaddy good okay praise god hallelujah i don't know if you guys feel it but i feel anointing in this room today um the looks on everybody's faces just the joy um this song has been in my heart for a while um i'm just waiting for the opportunity to share it with you um as you guys know the accident was really uh eye-opening experience um from our young brother nathaniel my brother i think another young sister was an accident to hear another one we know that the enemy is trying to get us but the bible says do not fear he's in control of all things this song is somewhat of a prayer um to god from my heart and i know probably from any of you all's heart you can relate and also at the end of it i'm gonna sing a song that last night we were on a prayer zoom call for my brother where he got to see his brothers and sisters and families aunties so many people there to support him and it was just eye-opening to me how just as in that moment when a brother needed someone to lean on or to know that that he's loved by those around him should be the same thing with us that we should bear in one another's burdens and love one another and sometimes we get so busy in life that we don't make time for the ones that we love i think that's something that you know the lord says go out and preach the gospel to the whole world and it's just being that light and that love to people from a stranger to your to your mother your father your brother your sister and it's sometimes it's difficult because you as you know we all have faults and we have failures and we all have struggles but if we just keep looking to him we will never fail he said he'll never leave us forsaken so pray this song will be a blessing to you this morning i don't need any music it'll be octopello change me oh god me more like you change me oh [Music] god wash me now through and through [Music] created me so that i may worship you [Music] created me oh god make me you change me oh god [Music] wash us now through and through creating me a clean heart so that i may worship you and i'm claiming a wonderful [Music] change has come all over me [Music] jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so little ones to him be long they are weak but he is strong [Music] yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me [Music] yes jesus loves me for the bible tells me so sing it with me church yes jesus loves me [Music] yes jesus tells me [Applause] hallelujah glory [Music] you know i cannot begin to thank god for all that he has done for me in my life i am a working miracle a talking miracle [Music] from the beginning of this year everything that could go wrong in my body went wrong it was my heart my lungs my liver my nose my sinuses my head you name it everything and they were just doing test after test after test everything came back perfect nothing is wrong nothing is wrong nothing is wrong and and they started sending me to specialists because they couldn't figure out what was going on my husband my daughter my son they just kept me in prayer we just keep praying and every time knocked down the lord picked me up knocked on the lord picked me up and i keep it the ekg they did the heart echogram they didn't distressed us everything came back perfect they did the cat scan for my sinuses for my head and everything came back perfect so bent my eyes they said my eyes was leaking fluid so i have to go back to the specialist on the 28th he gave me three months and he said when i come back on the 20th of this month they may have to do laser surgery but i believe that will be perfect also so i'm just asking for your prayer and through it all i said lord you love me so much so this morning i came with a song in my heart the love of god i said it brother john asked i'm gonna say yes lord and i'm gonna sing the love of god because when i think of all that he has done for me all my heart could do and say is thank you lord jesus sing with me the love of god is greater far than tongue or can ever tell [Music] it goes beyond the highest [Music] stars and it reaches to the lowest [Music] guilty [Music] god [Music] her [Music] [Music] from [Music] here in [Music] [Music] forever [Music] the same [Music] just it shall pass away [Music] oh [Music] read to pray on rocks and [Music] is shall steal [Music] into

the sky [Music] i'm so pure [Music] and strong [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] the same [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so [Music] hallelujah let's all stand please [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music]

your internet they're going to catch your power they're going to catch your your uh alarm they can catch your camera and everything together so while it's yet time take your time and listen to the word of god if you miss it you have thursday friday saturday three days you can catch up amen god wants you to serve him in a different category god wants you to serve him different than before god wants you to serve him in a level that you never did it before god wants you to serve him genesis chapter 38 verse one and he came to pass a data that judah went down from his brethren judah was among his brethren and judah went down he didn't go up so it seems like he was stooping down because when the gospel was leaving the jews going to the gentile when peter went down to the house of cornelius they thought that he was stooping down because the gentile were dogs remember the crows we were unclean bird until god have to give cornelius our peter a vision to show him that what you call unclean don't call them unclean because my children are there so judah was going down like the gospel leaving israel going down he was going down from among his brethren judah was leaving his brethren christ was leaving the jews he came to his own and his own receive him not then he went straight to the gentile going down amen from his brethren and turned into a certain a dilemma whose name was hara and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was sure and he took her and went into her and she conceived and bore his son and he called his name heir you might be seated and she conceived again and boris son and she called his name onan everybody there if you look at the first time it was judah who gave the name the bible say he called his name i just called it right now and the second one he was she called his name the church are you there call his name onan and she yet again conceive and bore his son and call his name sheila and he was at gazebo hallelujah when she bore him verse six and judah took a wife for air so there is three children here one of them is air who was the firstborn are you there and the second one is onan and the third is sheila judah took a wife to air to the first one the bible says in verse 7 6 and judah took a wife for air he is firstborn whose name was temur so tamar her first husband was aaron that was the first husband of tema everybody feel clear amen let's see what's wrong with air and heir judah's firstborn was what he was bad he was a wicked one so the first husband that table have in her life was a wicked one he was not a good one he was a bad husband your first husband is a bad one are you there eyes opening praise the name of the lord amen he was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slow him who killed him so god have to kill your first husband the bad one god gotta kill him not put him on high cu he must be killed completely by god amen and judah said to onan go into your brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to your brother so when the first wicked husband was destroyed from the life of tamer a door opened up by the law are you following me in other words the second husband of temer came by law it was the law that says that if your first husband died your brother can take over that wife if there is no kids to bring seed for his brother so the second husband was a husband that was provided by the word of god he was a husband that was provided by law are you there this husband is a first husband by nature are you there everybody who's a man he grow up he can get married but this husband onan was the first husband by law by religion are you following me by the word of god by religion it is the religion that provided a husband to tamar are you there the first one it was just a natural common thing for a woman to get married but the second one it was the church the religion the word of god that provided a husband are you following me let's see the husband amen praise the name of the lord the bible says in verse 9 and onan knew that the seed should be his should not be his and he came to pass thank you when he went into his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground now the seed we are talking about here is the seed of judah everybody clear this is a royal seed air carry that seed onan carry that seed are you there just like cal marlon and kylian carry those seed but both boys died are you there eliminate took them to the land of moab but both of those boys died are you following me so this one carried the seed of judah because with this first relationship temer never had a child with the first relationship ruth never had a baby with the first relationship oppa never had a baby are you there so the second relationship by the law was supposed to produce a child but this second husband this religious husband this husband that was given by the law by the word of god had they was carrying the seed of judah the spoken word is the original seed are you there instead of taking the seed of judah and directing that to the womb of the woman so that the woman can conceive he was only using tamar for pleasure are you there he was only using tamar for interest are you there he was only using temur to reap the benefits are you there but he was not interested on tamar conceiving or having a child are you following me he was carrying the seed he was carrying the word of god he was carrying the word of the hour but when it comes down that the woman is prepared to receive the word he was taking the word and spilling the message are you there he was deviating the message to give conception to the woman that he spilled it on the ground removing the world because if the seed goes there he knew he was not his child he want to get the glory he wants that child to be called after his own name he didn't want to raise a name for his brother he said i want that baby to be after my own name so since it's not going to be to my glory he took the word he took the seed and was peeling the seed away so every time tamar goes to church she's gonna be worked up on emotions she's gonna be worked up on pleasure she's gonna be worked up on many other things but when it comes to conception the seed is still on the ground are you there verse 10 and the things which he did displease the lord god watched the boy and when he seen that this boy was not interested to take the seed of judah and bring conception to the bride wherefore he threw him also god kill him everybody clear dan said judah to tim or his daughter-in-law remain a widow at your father's house just like naomi was telling ruth you need to go back to your father's house are you there it seems like misfortune is happening i don't know what's wrong with you the first husband no child second no child are you there a religious one till sheila my son be grown for he said let's perhaps he died also as his brethren did and tema went and dwell in his father's house in the process of time the daughter of shua judah's wife died and was comforted and went to the ship's year to timna to his friend harrah de abdullah watch verse 13. and he was told tamar somebody gave her a news faith cometh by what he was told tamar saying behold your father in law goes up not down at the beginning judah was going down now judah is ascending are you there going up to tim that to do what [Music] steal the ship he was at the period where judah had a flock judah intention was not going to tamer the intention of judah was to go to the ship are you there in john chapter 10 jesus told the jews that i have other sheep which are not of this fog he was talking to the jews because the jews were the flock of god so judah was going to his flock in order to shear a ship the shearing of a ship is a process where they're removing the wall from a ship are you there they will move the wall for two things the wall is something that is very precious to the ship the wall number one it's something that is of value something that is precious to the ship number two by removing the wall it is also healthy for the ship because the more wall the ship gets are you there it gets so hot so they have to shear the ship and remove what the ship carry as a value they have to separate the ship from certain things of his life are you there at the time of separation at the time where god judah was trying to remove the world away from the ship to bring a separation between oppa and ruth at that time that's the time judah was going down everybody there and she put her widow garments off from her she took the route of jacob and cover her with a veil she wrapped herself with a bell she was not approximated she only disguised herself like jacob because that woman was after the seed of judah she was a gentile woman jacob was after the birthright are you there and jacob have to disguise himself everybody there and cover her with a veil and wrap herself and sat in open place which is by the way to timna for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given to his wife to him as a wife when judah saw her he thought that was judah thinking she was not a prostitute he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face what does covering her face for a woman mean praise the name of the lord you got married you were wearing a veil do you know what it means we're going to get into it are you there verse 16 and he turned to her by the way and said go so when this woman positioned herself on the road judah forgot that his first direction was to the ship are you there are you following me so the woman step in between the flock of judah in other words you deal with me first before you deal with israel are you there that's why brother branham explained that revelation 10 is placed mathematically are you there before revelation 11 revelation 10 step right there you dealing with me first before you deal with israel are you following me and judah when he saw this woman he forget about israel he began to deal with the woman and forgot the jews [Music] hallelujah not the first the second the third husband are you there go and he turned to her by the way and said god too i pray you in other words come on now i pray you who was inviting the woman he was judah now are you there are you there tamar first husband was killed tema was abused and he just dropped so i'm gonna drop it the second husband of timber was a deceiving husband he was a husband that didn't love tamar he was working by deception a spirit of deception are you there are you there but the third husband was judah himself are you there demon serve this husband for pleasure tamar served this husband for interest tamar served this husband for benefit but god judah was calling the woman to serve him in a different category are you there god too i pray you judah thought that he's just gonna release because his wife died but if you look under you read between the line the woman was in the time of life it's not a coincidence it didn't happen by any chance things don't happen in your life by any chance there is always a reason behind it why did this happen this time why didn't it happen yeah last year why didn't it happen two years ago it happened at the time of life when you see certain things happening in your life you need to wake up it might be your time of life a time where god wants to bless you you are looking at circumstances instead of discerning you are looking the media to see what coronavirus is doing instead of looking what is god doing through this coronavirus you fill your brain with coronavirus diagnosis symptom this and this and you forgot what god is doing people are making more money during coronavirus they keep you distracted on the news and they're making more money selling more masks and you are dreaming amen and he turned to her by the way and say come on i pray you let me come into you for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will you give me that you may come into me in other words the woman wanna know the benefit are you there i have been abused before i wanna know you are calling me to a relationship what is the relationship about what am i gonna get in this relationship i am already scared i don't want to trust the people anymore i don't want to trust the pastor anymore now you give me another one what is the benefit that i have in this relationship verse 17 and he says i will send you a kid from the flock and she said will you give me a pledge for some reason if you're sleeping you may wake up up there i don't have any problem with it you can't be sleeping at this time when we watch a movie we don't sleep amen and he said i will send you a kid from the flock and she said will you give me a pledge if you work last night that's fine you might be standing this need to get in you you give me a pledge till you send it how come that judah went and didn't have money in his pocket judah forgot his wallet are you there he left his job and i said say homer are you there but the urge was so strong that the woman looked and said now you don't have money i want you to give me a guarantee that if i have something on your second coming you gonna come to me are you there is visitation of judah but i need to guarantee you that when you come to take your bread i am guarantee you are coming to me hallelujah verse 18. and he said what pledge are you there the woman asked what do you give me for pledge and judah take that request and send it back to the hand of the woman judah could have said you know what i'm going to give you this are you there but judah did not do it judah put it back to the bride like you didn't want to determine what you want for me i want a relationship you want to know the benefit of the relationship i am asking you what do you want from me what do you want sister hunty [Music] are you there a million dollars i can give it to you right now the healing of your family i can give it to you right now what do you want must be spiritual verse 18 and he said what pledge shall i give you and she said you're what so now we discover that judah on wednesday we found out that judah has a scepter remember today we found out that judah have a signet a signet is called also a ring are you there a signing ring everybody there your signal and your water so judah have also bracelets this tribe is strange are you there bracelet and your what the stuff is what we spoke about which is the sector everybody there if you miss wednesday that's why i was asking you you need to keep up if you stay behind it is not my fault indeed everything i can and he said what pledge shall i give you and she said your signal and your bracelet and your stuff that is in your hand are you there and he gave it to her the personal identification of judah was transferred from judah into the woman in other words the woman stripped judah out are you there whatever was in judah was now poor into the woman you there what was in jehovah was poor in jesus christ and what was in jesus christ was poor in the church watch verse 18 and he gave it to her and she came into her and she why she didn't conceive all this time so the secret of conception of this woman lies in judah judah have your baby judah have your child and she conceived from judah himself are you there not the children of judah but from judah himself the lord shall come down with her shout voice of the archangel and what the trump of god the lord himself matthew chapter 19 you are reading too long be privileged be privileged we're doing this for you and be grateful unto god matthew 19 verse 16 my burden is to make sure you get it matthew 19 verse 16. a scene open up now with a young ruler young rich ruler hallelujah amen verse 16 and behold one came and said to him good master what good things shall i do that i may have worked so this boy realized in his life that he never had a conception are you there he was going to church he was a religious boy but he realized even though he stayed so long in the message but still something is lacking in his life verse 17 and he said to him why call you me good there is none good but one that is who he understand the deity of jesus christ if you will enter into life keep the commandments in other words you're already heaven you are right here the young witch ruler you are on the religion are you there you are living with honor you are keeping the commandment but no eternal life what was the pharisee doing the pharisees have the law but it was not producing life jesus said you shall not do murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and your mother and you shall love your neighbor as yourself the commandment the young man said to him all these things ever kept from my youth what raka yet in other words i am still missing something i have been born in a message i grew up in a message i wear a long skirt i wear long hair i do all of this still something is missing oh no are you there let me jump to verse 21. jesus said to him if you will be perfect are you there if you want to go to the third relationship which is going to bring perfection to you are you there if you want to go to another call a higher category there is one thing you must do are you there the first woman separation separation the time of separation he said you the rich young woman ruler you want to go through a separation you want to go through a separation [Music] verse 21 if you will be perfect go and what so he was attached going what when you take the wool from the sheep they do what with it take your wool off are you there take your wool off go and sell what you have and give it to them and you shall have treasure in heaven and do what so god gave him an invitation to come and to follow you were following pharisee you were following honor now i give you an invitation like judah giving temer an invitation come and follow me but before you follow me you need to get your wool off a separation are you there verse 22 but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had what he was filled with a lot of wolves verse 27 then who peter said to him behold i have done what i have second oh i just watch you telling the young which you learn forsake everything and follow me i already done that are you there watch peter and follow you i already don't want to just ask the rich young rule watch the next one what shall we have what in other words what am i getting for benefit are you there tell me and say what am i gonna get for benefit peter say you just told him i did what he did but when we did it what are we gaining from you verse 28 when jesus said to him verily i say to you that you which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory you also shall sit upon what he gave them a grant right for the throne in the book in the church age of laodicea whoever will overcome shall sit on mine thank you judging the 12th tribe of israel verse 29 your benefit and everyone dies for second what oh they won't be a separation with your brothers and what a separation or a separation or separation or separation or separation or for my name because of the word a separation will happen somehow it might affect you with your wife it might affect you with your friends it might affect you with your brother it might affect you with your sister shall receive a what so you not losing everything roof lost everything but if you didn't know in the land of moab there was more than everything are you there shall we see the hundredfold and shall inherit what last scripture second corinthians chapter seven if you dare you can say amen this is not the time to be rushing we did that and the people came up they don't understand anything preached turned poo for 30 years still don't understand what it is no more second corinthians chapter 7 verse 7 and not by his coming only but i believe he might be first quarantine if i'm not mistaken let me see if not corinthians it's a chapter that says possessing all forsaken [Music] but possessing all things i might have quoted my scripture wrong but if it is we can pray and i can catch up later are you there forsaken but not abandoned things like that making some rich and yet possessing all things can somebody get me that scripture second corinthians six that was a verse seven that's it it's not seven it's six verse seven praise the name of the lord thank you by the word of truth everybody there that's it by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report all kinds of things going on and good report some are saying good some are destroying you as deceiver and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chester and not kill as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many what and having nothing like roof losing everything are you there and yet possessing what are you there it looks like ruth lost everything no she was possessing all things that's what jesus was telling peter that you didn't lose everything you are actually possessing all things because they just shall inherit the earth let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord you gave us a time to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i commit this service and your children unto the hand may you remove me completely out of the way lord may you come down and speak to your children may the holy spirit unfold this word like never before to your children lord father we rebuke every demonic spirit every spirit that is trying to bother your children further to bring them weariness by the reading of the scripture father we rebuke everything that is contrary to the word away from this place in the name of jesus christ may you come down and speak to your children be the alpha and the omega father in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we're dealing with the mystery of the tuesday on part one when we start this subject we found out that the ark of the covenant have two states up there and on part one we explain to you that the first staff was the lord jesus christ on part two we discovered the second staff that he was crushed in the ministry of the bride in the end time ministry which is the message of the hour are you there then by doing those two things or discovering the first coming of jesus christ and the second coming of jesus christ we book we we pull together the two head of the zodiac in other words the entire bible the first coming and the second coming of jesus christ now we found out that the first staff was broken which was speaking about the crucifixion of jesus christ then the second stuff also was broken but when the second stuff was broken he also bring a separation between the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah so to understand the meaning of that separation we went into part three to understand what was the meaning of the separation of israel or the division that happened with israel then on part three we introduced three women we introduced oppa we introduced naomi and we also introduced roof and a decision have to be taken whether those women have to continue all the way to the land of moab or they have to remain all the way to the land of israel or they have to remain in the land of moan the decision that was taken brought a separation orpah went back to her god to moab but naomi and roof cling together and the clinging of naomi and ruth that's why we explain it that when the separation happened between israel and judah we found another tribe which was the tribal benjamin that cling into judah so just like naomi and ruth cling together judah and benjamin also cling together are you following me so we found out that israel represented oprah the corner part judah represented the roof which is the top of the blood and benjamin according to brother branham represented naomi which is the 124 000. then on part 4 we begin to deal with the land of judah when we enter into the land of judah we pull a man by the name of boaz and through powers we find out that the first benefit that was in the land of judah apart from the bread of judah was the mystery of the scepter everybody remember that after the scepter because judah was carrying the scepter of israel when jacob was blessing his children he told judah that the scepter shall never leave judah and that scepter was the lord jesus christ and brother brother told us that boaz was a type of jesus christ and through jesus christ we found out that the second benefit was the priesthood that was in judah because the first priesthood was through the leave out by the second priesthood was by the tribe of judah through melchizedek everybody following me then part five today we are continuing with the blessing of the benefit of judah that's why tamar said what would you give me peter say what will you give me i want to know the benefit i want to know you are telling me to leave moab you want me to leave moab you want me to separate from a friend you want me to separate from my brother you want me to separate from my sister you want me to separate from many things in my life but i'm going to a land that i don't know i'm going to an unknown man like abraham what will you give me are you there we found the scepter we found the priesthood that was hidden together when we start with them in our story today tema had the first husband everybody there thank you the first husband was wicked he was a bad one and god killed him what's going on brother branham in the message the invisible union of the blood of christ brother branham said now he was nature associated with death your first husband that had ruled over you was your nature by natural birth are you there natural you love the world because you are off you are the world and part of the world your desire was by nature to love the world which you are part of you are part of nature and that is your natural things because david expressed to us that we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies so your first husband must die brother branham that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate are you there this woman had to separate from her first husband but it is not you that do the separation the separation must be done by god are you there he says separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well i divorced him and hang him up there till occasion in other words if something don't work out i have plan b you don't do like that once you leave the land of moab you burn the bridges behind you your first husband must die everybody clear no sir no riding of divorcement he dies because divorcement he's still enough things might change he can come back we must make sure he's dead are you there he said the nature of the world has to die every speck of it has to die are you there you have to be reunited again with another nurture everybody clear that's why her first husband husband but the second husband was by law or by the word of god and the husband was deceiving one instead of taking the message instead of taking the seed and make sure we keep the message pure in order to produce the best in the life of sons and daughter of god we took the message and spilled it on the ground we destroyed the message we devaluated the message we removed the message away from the channel of the womb of the church and because of that god had to kill that second husband god had to separate you from that second husband what is it brother branham we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day what it is impossible for honor to carry the seed and to bring you a breath this message cannot be carried by denominational idea because the nomination will give you what pleases you denomination will use your task they will use your offering they will tell you what you want to hear but they will never give you the dark part of the message they will tell you where high heels will make up but you can still be a christian the message destroyed those stuff are you there could carry out the last day message in its present condition why he can't even agree on one or two words in a bible how are you going to do it he can't do it you see denomination is out it's going to be an elected people that is elected for right are you there you must be predestinated for that i will get into predestination now no and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominationals pentecostal and all are what so there is no way we can bring you back to the nomination for you to receive the best the nomination will abuse you they're gonna use your money they're gonna use your daddy they're gonna make you pay for prophecy pay for handkerchief pay to support the program but no life that's it that is to be to the born again christian of death uh-huh the third your first husband religious one is dead you know he's dead god let it die it is god that doesn't it is god that killed your first one it is god that is killing the second one because he is playing with the world are you there oh all of it scientific it is a rocket intellectual educational scientific ways of it so-called bible school and faith is what thank you jesus so when the second husband died it happened that it was the time of the shearing of the sheep so the sheep like i explained it to you there is one thing important about it is more the world what is wrong with the world take ezekiel 44. if you're there you can say amen ezekiel 44 verse 15 hallelujah are you there we are talking about the world why do you have to remove the wall from the ship why do you have to shield the ship why do you have to cut off what is precious to the ship ezekiel 44 verse 15 but the priest the what leave heart remember on wednesday we talk about a royal priesthood i will make you a kingdom of what priest are you there we enter in the priesthood of melchizedek are you there praise the name of the lord he said by the priest delivered the son of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me are you there they shall come near me if you look at this river the species there is something specific about this liver god is saying that when israel deviated from the word there was a group of liver that remained faithful to him are you there praise the name of the lord they shall come near to me to minister to me and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood says the lord watch verse 16 and they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister to me they shall keep my church verse 17 and it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gate of the what we know that the tabernacle have three parts everybody following me the tabernacle have tripod he have the other court are you there he has the other court then there was the holy place everybody following me then there was the holy of holies which was the inner coat of the temple everybody following me but god says that the priest that stood with the word the priest that took a stand for the word the priest that took a stand for the message are you there when they enter into the intercourse into the holy of holies into another relationship with judah when they are coming into a personal relationship into the bad chamber with judah verse 17 it shall come to pass that when they enter in the gate of the inner court they shall be clothed with what reliant means the righteousness of what so when you enter there you must come with the righteousness of their sin and the righteousness comes by the god scepter you remember praise god you go back to wednesday and listen to the message that's why it's important to keep up shall be closed with learning government and what no woe everybody clear no woe shall come up them shall come upon them while the minister in the gate of the and what so god is telling israel that when you enter the priest that stood for the word the prince that stood for the message the priest that took a stand for the world when israel deviated when they are entering into a relationship with me into a different category of serving god tell them don't bring the womb what are you talking about god delivered brother if you can see what was that temple what that temple was that delivered was there everybody clear everybody clear liver towards the bread now when sin is working on every hand the liver is pulling there they took a stand for the world sin is unbelief and belief to the revealed word of the hour are you there the holy ghost born brad is standing out saying jesus christ in the positive is jesus christ in the negative just the same sin is still sin it's wrong to do these things that's right they are standing there with them god says come me now the blessed of my father that is the so the part of delivered that stood for the word tough word the bride but this blood need to serve god no more in the other court no more in the holy place these three places have a mystery of three lights maybe we're gonna get into that later the other court was exposed to the light of the zodiac if iran he ran over there are you there if it's hot it's hot over there the holy of holies had the candlestick the candlestick could be pulled out are you there the light can go out but the holy of the holiest have a different light which was the pillar of fire that was the eternal light so god say no more here today you good

boys think are you there brother branham said when you see something bad it tells you there is something good boys see women naked all over the walmart they see them when we're driving people are walking on the street people are going to oma we already seen that and you want to copy that show me something different that's going to attract me it is for free on walmart for free on one great for

share me today take me a lambo like a lamb and let me be dumb don't open my mouth don't defend yourself it say nothing about it just stand and be what in other words surrender to the world let the world wash you she put a veil for the third husband and the third husband was julia coming up the first one no pregnancy killed the second one killed the third one at the time that the lamb have to remove a time that roof have to separate from moab take off the wool and move on to a relationship with christ she put a veil over her head what does that feel means brother brother lika was explaining about why women felt their face when they get married why they may not understand that but what they are doing is knowing that they are a body they have no head the man is there that's the reason rebecca failed herself are you there the veiling of the head is showing a submissive a submission of a woman showing that i don't have any more tamar was telling judah no more head are you there i don't lean anymore on to my own understanding i have taken myself without i am surrendering to the will of christ they may not understand that but what they are doing knowing that they are a body they have no head the man is the head that's the reason rebecca failed herself and that's why the church ought to veil itself and surrender itself to who because he is dog and he is dog why does a woman every time she get married put a veil over her face she is coming to her the head just like rebecca did she put a veil over her face to meet hezek she has no more head asses her head and the church ought to be so submissive to the world that's why i'm preaching the way i'm preaching that everlove evils it's on face he has no head the nature of a woman is to submit to a man and that's what the church ought to be doing submitting to christ to his word to his what the doctrine of the message to his principle she takes no thought for herself she has no head crossed his head not some enthusiastic punch but crossed his head the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah jesus christ the same today and that same manifestation of the so this woman put it there and judah approaches when judah approaches she was given the signal she was given the stuff in the hand she was given the bracelet of judah what else those stuff means before we get into those stuff let's touch up on the rich young ruler everybody here you understand them you understand moab the rich young muller was rich he came for eternal life then he meets jesus christ jesus christ gave him an invitation to come and follow me why did jesus christ told him to follow him are you ready brother branham let me know in the message come follow me jesus said then listen at him he want to be a man so when jesus christ was talking to the rich young ruler jesus christ discerned that there was a gift of a ministry in the life of this child the call that jesus has given him to follow him head and to be a soul winner as a young man returned to him again he remembered that he had five brothers and back on earth he didn't want them in that place in other words on the second place where this young which ruler appeared in the bible he was in hell and when he was in hell he was telling abraham would you send lazarus to go over there and to preach to my brother so they don't come this place brother branham said he was the gift of an evangelist jesus gave him the opportunity to use it he refused it now the gift is activated in hell what is the message that i'm trying to say when god is pulling you to a higher calling when god is inviting you to a higher calling when judah is inviting you to a higher calling the woman was in her leading season it is telling you that there is something in your life that god put in and god is trying to use it that's why he's calling you if you miss it you're going to discover it in hell are you there lord help me when i get to predestination and you're going to see what is in you you want to see what serving god means because we're going to get to roof serving are you there are you there so this young ruler have a gift and when he came to jesus he had to move from a lower kind of serving god to a higher jesus wanted him to shear off follow him then jesus put him in a ministry to win shows but he didn't see far beyond he was looking at the woman what was his word brother bradham says he said send him back and let this message be brought to them to his brother he wanted to be a minister then he wanted to accept it he was what can't do it now his time he had opportunity but he didn't make his what so what god is trying to tell you make an investment now because when i send you to this world there is something that i put in you he was under the law jesus came with grace but jesus came with grace what is jesus telling him just religion won't work on him so this one young ruler here said good master now remember before i say it he had been taught to walk right he had a good education he had been taught business he was rich and was a ruler and he had a religion message but was confronted with another problem and he confronts all of us eternal life religion does not give us eternal life religious is a covering you just protect yourself but your inside might be like a devil but he don't give you it to give us eternal life yet him thought with the best teacher there was he was yet lacking something and the young man knew it because he said good master what can i do to inherit eternal life now you you believe jesus christ is god don't you so he knew the thought of the young man so he said keep the commandment he went right back to his religion to see what he would say about his religion he says in other words keep your religion god is giving you opportunity like naomi go back again tomorrow i want to see whether you want to follow me let's take proverbs chapter 18 and see this rich young ruler what did he have why he didn't want to give up because when you look at the scripture superficially you're going to come up with a superficial understanding proverbs 18. the bible said he was rich verse 11. if you there you can say amen all right everybody there everybody there the bible says that the rich man's wealth is his what and a high wall in his own so in the mind of a rich man his wife is his security you understand now when they say rich young you need to understand what does which mean which means that his wealth is his security and god said carried off my god take proverbs 19 verse 4 the next chapter if you dare you can say amen you there wealth next what so wealth brings security and love bring you friends so when jesus christ was telling him sell everything you have become poor jesus was telling him remove your security and cut off with all your friends you understand now separate yourself and come and follow me [Music] and take the money and give it to the poor jesus designed that even though he was following the law he was yet lacking something he told jesus christ he said everything i follow jesus look at the discernment and say there is something you don't follow take that money give it to them if you remember the second time we see his story in the bible he was with the poor lazarus there lazarus was dying and he was eating fun he had the problem with the poor take detroit number 15 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i cannot rush where i stop i need to stop we will continue until this thing get down stocking pretty good deuteronomy 15 verse 11. if you dare you can say amen are you there for shall never cease out of the land that's why when judah looked at the the the prostituted mary breaking the alabaster box judah said you know what we can take this salad and then give the money to the poor jesus say uh-uh you want to steal that money the poor will always be with you in other words you will always have opportunity to give money to the poor you understand now verse 11 for the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore i command you saying you shall open your hand what to your brother to your poor to your needy in your and brother and solomon said that whoever give money to the poor do what lend us to the lord that's why jesus gave him opportunity give to the poor lend it to the lord put money in your bank account in heaven and now follow me i'm going to activate your gift and let you fulfill the purpose i send you here enough he didn't want to do it he was breaking that commandment that's why lazarus was still poor and he was there rich breaking that commandment and jesus tried to fix him like you are appearing to me like you are following the law you are not really following the law there is something you are breaking take james chapter two he broke one commandment right he was not giving money to the poor so what does that one commandment mean james chapter two if you dare you can say amen i will move only slowly when it's time brother john you tell me your brother robert and we will stop and continue but these staff cannot rush with him are you there john chapter 2 james actually chapter 2. everybody there james chapter 2 verse 10. for whatsoever shall keep the whole law everybody following me and yet offended in what everybody clear this guy told jesus christ he was keeping the law jesus said do this do this do this he said he was keeping the law but the law when you follow it and you miss he was missing one what does he mean whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of what i'm reading your bible verse 11 for he that stayed do not commit adultery he was not doing that say do not kill he was not doing that now if you commit no adultery yet if you kill you become a transgressor of in other words you are still a sinner but i'm trying to fix your problem sell everything that you have give it to the poor correct your arrow and come and follow me the woman in the world have the same opportunity jesus said you have a problem because she said jacob did this and this you said she knew about religion jesus said you have a problem you are acting like you know about the scripture but you have a problem your problem you have five heavens six husbands five of them are gone the one you have is not yours he said sir i perceive that you are and when jesus opened up she changed her life she deposit everything the rich young ruler didn't want to change his life he didn't want to leave it brother brother say how far have we drifted from it the same thing this boy did here he rejected refuse eternal life because he would cost him his social standing it will cost him his luxury of money he will cost him his fellowship in the church i miss my friend over there i need to go back to my friend it will cost him a lot of things he know what he was going to cost him he was sensible boy and he felt that he could not pay the price yet he thought i shall trust my religion and go on i can still believe the bible and go on but down in his heart he know there was something about jesus about the message was different from them priest of that day and any message that is coming in a genuine born message of god is different from all the old trend that's why we must be different because the message is different oh my god let's follow this young ruler the next time we find him in the bible as soon as he rejected the opportunity to follow jesus when he was laid down to him pretty stiff you see we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow jesus you see the problem you don't want to give up your friend on facebook you don't want to give up your friends on instagram you want to keep posting things every day and people clapping their hands like like like yeah like like like and the more like you have the more he bring you to do it over until you can sit one hour without checking your telephone you are checking status to see how many people likes it you want to hold on everything that we can and follow jesus but sometime jesus wants you to turn loose off everything so we can get buff's hand on him are you there it's gonna cost you something let's look at peter we finish with the young ruler we finish with them let's look at peter on matthew chapter four once i get peter then we zero in straight to the airport with full speed are you there let's take matthew chapter four this is to position you are you there matthew chapter 4 verse 18 some are still flipping pages giving me time to drink water before somebody say he drink no water matthew chapter 4 verse 18 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren someone called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were officials they had a profession do you know that peter was married thank you if you need a scripture you see me and he said to them follow me same thing they told the young ruler and i will make you what the same opportunity that was given to the rich young ruler was given to peter are you there follow me and verse 20. and then what immediately they didn't take time they didn't seek to begin to think immediately left there and follow they were able to be shielded they were like roof they were ready to forsake their god forsake their people forsake the occupation and go to the mark of the high calling why peter have a gift just like the young ruler have a gift but the young ruler failed to see four things you ready a decision have to be made from him to be sheared off roof decided that decision was calling him for a high calling to serve christ the second point he wanted to serve god in a different category than before because the law didn't give him eternal life he gave him prestige he gave him practice with the pharisee because he had a lot of money everybody want to talk to him the third one is there was a rest connected to his calling the rest brother branham said is the baptism of the holy ghost the rich young ruler never seen pentecost jesus was calling him to serve him then later on fill him on the day of pentecost he didn't see that are you there he stopped peter follow him and when peter struggled jesus prayed for peter this just came right now when peter struggled because he was willing to forsake everything are you there and to follow jesus christ when peter begin to struggle jesus come and say listen you took a stand for me satan is following you he wanted to kill you in the car accident this morning but i pray for you are you there i pray for you that you are faith fairness not are you there and when peter went to his struggle like you're denying jesus the first the second time when jesus was again and met the people at the resurrection he said god tell my disciple and and who peter he didn't say and by telling me and peter because peter took instead once you take a stand once you are willing to forsake everything it is god taking over your life are you there even if you struggle somewhere he already prayed for you are you there the rich young ruler never seen it he didn't want to decide he missed the high calling he missed the opportunity to serve god in a different category he missed the holy ghost that was coming in pentecost and he's gonna miss the second coming because he's still in hell the reward roof deciding roof serving roof resting roof rewarded everybody clear just like oppa after the separation happened oppa went the rich young wooly but peter was like roof willing to go all the way up what is going on buckle up and we go to the airport you ready let's see if we gonna land we okay when the decision came for roof to leave moab and to go to bethlehem what is the benefit we have for second on rufus took everything what am i gonna get you want me you want a personal relationship with me what are you gonna give me the first one they will say hi calling we express that in bethlehem was bread you remember that on wednesday and we found that that bread was barley bed but the barley has a mystery you remember wednesday because behind the barley was the wheat bread are you there those two bread was there as a benefit and we explained to you that the first bread which was the value was the first part of the message and the second one was following maturing behind the valley which was the opening of the seventh seal a measure of which for measure of valley are you there we seen that roof we found out that she was a motherboard and bringing more about on wednesday which meant to you that there was an ordinance that was standing against moab that said that no more god can enter the congregation of israel that was the word of god that was planned in the book of nehemiah they even kicked people out because of their law but roof because she accepted to follow the land of judah to follow the high calling she entered into judah and we found out that through judah there was a mystery of the golden scepter because scepter was in judah and with that god then scepter are you there he has the opportunity to go above the law are you there even though they say no but even though it is connected to death but somehow the golden scepter will open up the way for you to go beyond the law take esther chapter four hallelujah esther come after nehemiah before job you go to the book of job you go back backward you put reverse you in esther if you're in nehemiah drive forward esther anybody there esther chapter 4 11 remember this priesthood have to go into the inner court everybody remember that when you go to the inner court you need to remove your wound everybody clear watch it step four all the king servant the people of the king's province do know that whatsoever where the man or woman shall come to the king into what makes sense makes sense in a court right in a god who is not what so to enter into the inner court you must be you must have a gift you must be call of god to enter the inner court are you there you must be a special people god not everybody get there that's the reason why in the old temple not everybody was entering here only the high priest are you there and the high priest must be called who is not god there is one lord to him but to do what put them to death accept such to whom the king shall hold out there god accepted that he may leave but i have not been called to come into the king through these 30 days in other words if the king put the golden scepter that law is no more working are you there check hebrew chapter seven hallelujah hebrew chapter seven nobody can enter the inner court for you to enter in the inner court you need to be you need to be in a specific class of a priesthood you must be a leader to enter into the temple not everybody have access to the temple only those that are called hebrew seven verse five you there and verily they that are of the son of what who received the offering of the priesthood have a commandment to take that of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loans of who in other words the office that should attend to the altar was reserved to a people call those people well what lever right job to ever hebrew chapter 9. let's see what's going on here hebrew 9 verse 2 are you there for the ones that tabernacle made that the first wearing was the the tabernacle here paul called the holy place the tabernacle because that's where the candlestick were everybody following me the candlestick and the table and the showbread which was called there the holy place was also called the sanctuary that's where you found the shoe bread you found the table and you found the candlestick because the other coat was open to the outside are you there verse three and after the second fail not this fail this is the first the second verb you see why paul said that he's describing here and he say after the second verse the other chord the first veil the second after the second in other words paul is bringing you to the holy of holies to the inner court he said after the second film the tabernacle which is called the did you understand that holy of the holiest job to verse six now these things were thus or then the priest went always in the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god in other words the priests always get here nobody goes there are you following me inner court verse 8 verse 7 but into the second the holy of holies went there high priest alone do you see that you must be called once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the era of the people verse 8 the holy ghost this signifying in other words by the priest going only one time over there the holy ghost was speaking something the holy ghost was showing something the holy ghost was signifying that the way into the holy of holies of the holiest of all was not yet been what in other words the way was not open are you there well as the first tabernacle was yet standing in other words when they tell you that you cannot enter into the king place until they accept if the king calls you he was showing in the book of hebrew that the way to enter into the holy of holies was still blocked but god had the scepter that scepter have to come out of jacob and that scepter was jesus christ when jesus christ comes then he brings the scepter and he break that law that's why when jesus was dying at the cross the veil the second veil of the temple was whipped apart opening the way to the holy of holies in other words you have the right to enter in the presence of god you understand now the way was open tech chapter 10 verse 17 hallelujah hallelujah verse 17 chapter 10 and their sin and iniquities will i remember no more now where there is remission of these there is no more offering for sin having therefore breath and what you have confidence you cannot be afraid it does not belong to the high priest anymore we are under the order of melchizedek you have a right to have an intimate relationship with judah and that relationship will give you both the child that you miss with him the child that you meet with honored judah is calling you come now i have it i'm ready for it i am ready for it they use you but i'm not going to use you it is enough it is time for the rapture come up are you there are you there he said and by a new having therefore boldness to enter into what by what the blood of who not the blood of bulls and god the blood of who of jesus by a what and living a new category a different category not the old one a new category by a new and living way which he has he has prepared that time for you prepare for us through the that is to say what he is and having a high priest over the house of god let us what we say what in full what having our heart from what having our world taken off are you there having a wall taken off sprinkle from heavy evil conscience and our body what we fought let us hold our what our power with that wavering for he is what who made the in other words it's time for you to step into a place where you gonna hold god so tight until something happened in your life once it happened you don't argue when a woman is pregnant like my two sisters back then they don't have to talk to you when they walk you sit they can hide at the beginning after one it pop up after a while they pop up after a while they pop after a while we see the baby in the car seat are you there god is calling for a hire are you there are you there take john 14 am i have to stop here then we're going to continue next time okay brother robert here okay okay john chapter 14. this thing was loaded if i continue what is behind there we stay here another hour we need to be mindful and let you soak it verse 14 chapter 14 verse 6. everybody there jesus said to him i am the a new and living way i am there the truth ender no man comes to the nobody access the king except by their nobody comes to the father but bye are you there are you there so he's calling you up separate from you from your lipstick separate from craziness separate from foolishness separate from all the stuff permit me to read one scripture take number 24 and we close by this today hallelujah take number 24. hallelujah we read about this but there is something to it take number 24 number 24 verse 17. everybody there everybody guess what how's the scripture behind friday number 24 17 and i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not near they shall come here out of what and the air so a scepter is a person [Music] are you there a scepter is a person a person of jesus christ are you there so you need the scepter between you and the king you need the staff between you and the ark of the covenant you cannot enter the ark of the covenant without the stuff you cannot enter in the king without the scepter the scepter is a person nobody comes to the father except bye are you there a star out of jacob an acceptor shall rise after what and he shall smart the word the corner of who the corner of who roof was from who do you know what corners mean if you look at another translation that word corner of moab means the school skull or the forehead the corners the foreheads of moab that scepter when it comes it's going to crush the brain of moab is going to crush the forehead of noah brother brother the bible says he that worshiped the beast receive his mark or the letter of his name now watch in there or in the that is what oh that don't mean you have to do you got a big tattoo on your face it don't mean to it don't have to be that it's not talking about the artwork it is talking about of the saying he was on your is your and when that scepter comes it crushes he removes the knowledge of moab it removes the revelation of moab he cleans you up he removes the wall he remove everything from moab and he open up a different way a way for you to come and to access the king because you went through this thing so long no pregnancy no life you are praying under hesitation you pray sometimes you work sometimes it doesn't work brother branham was praying at work he prayed he worked he prayed he went we need to see why was he working because it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god found out that you have a gift he's just unveiling that to you that this is an opportunity for you to serve him in a higher dimension he want to activate your gift you got to be able to shear off you got to be able to let things go you got to be able to let your will go you got to be able to separate because the scepter is already held to you there is a new and living way that is open there is a door god is opening he wants you to serve him because sooner it's time to go home the pregnancy the baby you are belonging to was not in your first nature it was not in the preaching it was not after your favorite pastor
