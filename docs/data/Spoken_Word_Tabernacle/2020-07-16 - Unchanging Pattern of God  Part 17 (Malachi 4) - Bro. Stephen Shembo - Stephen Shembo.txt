[Music] jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here god bless you all tonight good to see everybody in the house of the lord god bless you my sister that guitar is playing pretty good hallelujah praise the lord let's go to malachi chapter four as we promise we will get the portion of john the baptist here that is the more confusing one so trust those that are not here tonight will catch up so it will help them on wednesday on a malachi chapter 4 verse 5 if you're there you can say amen the bible says behold we already explained the law of moses my servant in horrible behold i will send you elijah the prophet we explained this extensively before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so there is a day that is a day of judgment as elijah the prophet verse 6 you might see it those people say that this belongs to israel so let's see and verse six and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children so the first thing that is mentioned on verse 6 is that this elijah will turn the heart of the fathers toward the children so when the bible say children we usually have a tendency to think that there are many children but if you search the the scripture pretty good that children was speaking about one it goes slowly he shall turn the heart his intent is to take the heart of the father we already seen what the ministry of elijah does and turn those heart to the faith of the children and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their father so there is another section where the heart of the children are turned to the father i'm not gonna touch that today we're just gonna mention the heart of the father to the children everybody clear and the heart of the children to their father lester come and smite the earth with a curse so the heart is singular here turn to the children everybody clear so far let's go to the book of luke chapter one brother mike probably you can close the door please thank you luke chapter 1 verse 13 we are dealing with john the baptist so manly turning the heart of the fathers to the children luke chapter 1 verse 13 if you're there you can say amen but the angels say to him fear not zechariah for your prayer is heard and your wife elizabeth shall bear your son shall bear you a son and you shall call his name john and we know that john according to what we have been studying was elijah because jesus christ pointed to us that john the baptist was the elijah that should come everybody clear verse 14 and you shall and you shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth the birth of john for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink so this elijah here has a restriction not to drink wine or strong drink so no wine here and no strong drink in other words if we bring it today no wine and no beer are we clear okay because the spirit of elijah when it comes upon john the baptist there is a restriction on the life of john the baptist you cannot drink wine nor strong drink right and we found out that brother branham also had a restriction in his life not to defile his body are we there no cigarette no drink no women nothing everybody clear okay verse 15 for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb i told you that john was the yellow light right he was not green neither red but through the yellow you can pass through right but the dispensation of the holy spirit was not there yet according to john chapter 7 we found out on sunday that the holy spirit was not yet given so you found out that this holy spirit of john is nothing else but the spirit of elijah okay the spirit of elijah is a spirit of christ are you there but when he works into a man elijah they call that the spirit of elijah it is not the man spirit of elijah it is an anointing of god that expressed itself in the ministry of elijah are you there it is the spirit of a lion it is the spirit of an ox it is the spirit of a man it is a spirit of an ego all those spirits are still the anointing of god everybody clear okay verse 16 and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god so something happened to the children of israel that they were driven away from god so elijah have to come take the children of israel which we call the fathers and turn them back to the children everybody clear now verse 17 i want everybody to look at this and he shall go before him in the spirit everybody see now they said the holy spirit but now it's very specific in the spirit and power of who everybody clear of elijah to turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to the father did he say that did he say that okay you see now in malachi 4 he says that we turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to the father but when luke is describing the ministry of john the baptist luke only use the first part are you there look never say the heart of the children to the father look only picked so in other words luke went to the book of uh malachi 4 and only pulled this scripture and said this scripture is the one that belonged to john the baptist not the other one are you there cool we will explain that on sunday and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the heart of the father to the children that's all that have to do with john in malachi 4. nothing else if you want to see john he's isaiah 40 if you want to see john he's malachi 3 but if you want to go to malachi 4 the only portion that belonged to john the baptist is only turning the heart of the father to the children period the bible never described anything else the brother the bible never taken that the day shall burn like an oven that doesn't belong to john that's the reason why after the ministry of john there was no earth that was burned because he doesn't belong to john the baptist the only portion of john is taking the heart of the father and turning them back to the children are you there the heart of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just who's this just so the heart of the father to the children luke explained us a little bit more he said the disobedient everybody there to what d just who's the just but god right who's the just one but christ everybody there and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepare for the lord so the lord was coming there was a coming of the lord and that coming the lord have to enter suddenly into his temple and that temple was the lord jesus christ so john have to take the heart of israel of the father and turn them back to the just one the just one which is crust everybody clear so far no problem let's go to luke chapter 3 now then we will be praying this is very important because this is where the mess are coming from luke chapter 3 verse 3 if you dare you can say amen and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sin we seen that on fight on uh on sunday we explained that the remission of the scene he was just pointing but he didn't do it because the lamb was the one that was taking away the sin of the world as it is written in the book of the word of isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord make his path straight that isaiah 40. we explain it every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth john was now working in the construction on the road this road is the road to the heart he was preparing the heart not the highways are you there okay and then all flesh shall see the salvation of god remember the salvation of god there is no name under heaven from people for uh uh where the people must be saved except in the name of jesus everybody clear then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him all generation of what so john is looking at people but when he looked at them he called them a generation of vipers in other words a generation of snake if you go in the book of matthew chapter 3 the bible clearly stated that those people were the pharisees and the sadducees if you look at matthew chapter 3 if you need that scripture you can see me later and i will give it to you so when john looked at the people he looked at the pharisee he looked at the sadducees and he looked at them he said you are of the brood or the generation or the children of the snake of the viper that's why jesus in john chapter 8 when he look at those people he said you are of your father the devil are you there and he said he was a murderer from the beginning and the murderer from the beginning was ken which was the son of the wicked one so john the baptist when the anointing of elijah comes upon him he also described the serpent seed everybody clear the anointing of elijah coming on john forbid him to defile his body the anointing of elijah coming on john express the serpentine so when we see elijah today he must have restriction not to defer his body when we see elijah today he must also preach the serpent seed everybody clear praise the lord let's go to verse 10 and the people ask him saying what shall we do then the people did what they asked him so there were people that came to john that asked him certain things verse 11 and he answers are you there so john when the spirit of elijah came upon him he came with a message and through that message john have a session of question and answers are we clear oh my god he answered and said to them he that has two coats let him impart to him that has known and he that has me let him do likewise then come also the public and to be baptized and say to him master what shall we do questions and answers and he said to them exactly no more than that which is appointed you and the soldier likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do question and answer everybody there and he said to them due violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wage and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in the heart of john whether he wear the crust or not everybody clear verse 16 john answered saying to them all i indeed baptize you with water we went through this on sunday but one monday the night comes the latchette of whose shoes i'm not worthy to unleash we explained that one he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire he was pointing them to the future in the ministry of john there will be restriction to his body in the ministry of john elijah serpent seed will be preached in the ministry of john there will be session of question and answer everybody clear let's jump to verse 18 then we will be praying and many other things in his exhortation preach he to the people but harold the tetrarch being reproved in other words rebuke by him for herodias his brothers philip's wife and for all evil which herod has done in other words herod had a brother and the brother has his wife his wife was their work has a name a herodias so his brother was still alive and he went and took his brother's wife and marry him so john came and rebuked him telling him that it was not lawful for him to take his brother wife while the brother is still alive everybody clear added yet this above all that he shut up john into prison so we see here that the anointing of elijah when he comes also on john the baptist he had to deal with marriage and divorce everybody clear so the anointing of elijah comes restriction to the body preach the serpent seed head question and answer and also have to deal with the question of marriage and divorce everybody clear let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you are doing for us lord father thank you for giving us another opportunity through this pandemic where we can gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord father and feast as ego lord lord we are committing this service unto the hand made the heaven opens lord and may the holy spirit find another opportunity tonight lord to be uh to refill the temples of god lord father the prophet told us that there is one baptism lord but there are several revealing lord father may this be another opportunity for you to fill your children lord and those that miss it lord may this be the opportunity to seal them into the kingdom father we rebuke every work of the devil and commit this service unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord we are in part 17 and still dealing with john the baptist before we get to malachi 4 we spoke about these three dispensations we found out that there is a dispensation of the law we found that there is a dispensation of grace where god leave the jewish people and go to the gentile people and we also find that after finishing with the gentile people the lord will go back to the jewish people to pick up the hundred and forty four thousand so when we dealt with the character that we use here we found out that all this character moses was a jew john the baptist was a jew paul was a jew moses and elijah and mon transfiguration were jews moses and elijah going back to the gentile are the 244 000 was jew but there is a specific ministry of elijah which deal with their gender and the pardon is still the same moses elijah moses elijah moses elijah and moses and elijah so now we're gonna clear the third uh dispensation we will be dealing with these two the first one deal with the coming of the lord as a baby through the virgin and then the second one deal with the second coming of the lord as the lion of the tribe of judah which is leo the lion in these two dispensation we found the pattern are still consistent we found that israel started with a man by the name of moses then before the coming of jesus christ as a baby born through a virgin because isaiah said that the a child is born a son is given and his name will be wonderful counselor prince of peace mighty god so that child was god in the form of a baby are you there so when before jesus christ come back as a baby only on on this earth according to the prophecy of moses in deuteronomy 3 18 18 which moses said that the lord your god shall send you a prophet like unto me so before he comes we find a man comes up by the name of john the baptist which is elijah then when the dispersation of grace started to the gentile it started with a man by the name of paul which we described and unveiled through the teaching of the message that paul was our modern moses and at the end before the coming of jesus christ to take his blood into the rapture we found out that there is a dealing of elijah through the gentile everybody clear now as we start back on the top because we are dealing with john the baptist we found out that israel was in egypt under bondage right so when moses went moses got into egypt and uh actually israel got into egypt and moses was born there and through the hand of moses god used moses to withdraw israel from egypt everybody following now brother branham says this in god talked to moses brother branham said that all those types of old they were just shadows of the things that was to come in other words if you look in the old testament it's only pointing you or give you a clue to what is coming down into the future when they were killing the lamb into the temple that lamb was just telling you that one day a lamb of god will come and will be killed to take away the sin of the world now i believe that that was the church natural so brother branham is calling the dispensation of the law that it was a church but that church was natural everybody clear the jewish church that was brought out of egypt to palestine was the natural church god's natural people who had a natural law so the first dispensation brother branham is telling us that in the first dispensation there is a church there and that church is a jewish church and that church was under the law everybody clear now he says but we today are god spiritual church we are temples right with a spiritual law written on the tables of our heart led in a spiritual form in other words what happened natural to israel it is happening to us spiritually now they looked up to see where the pillar of fire was the angel of the lord but we don't look today in other words when israel was leaving the promised land and following god was clearly visible by the pillar of fire they can look and see that god is there god is moving there but brother branham said that in our time god is invisible everybody there there is just something happen that we know he's there in other words even though god is invisible but yet we can feel his presence we know that god is there everybody clear now they were the people of god israel down in egypt where the people of god until they came out of egypt and started toward the promised land then they became the church of god in other words when israel was in egypt they were called the people of god everybody there but when they came out of egypt they will call now the church of god everybody clear where does brother branham get those stuff from the word church means called out i love that separated one in other words israel was caught out of egypt israel was separated from the nation of egypt because the first pharaoh must die everybody clear okay in the ever-present water from the rock brother branham say when israel was in egypt they were the people of god i'm still insisting on that then when they were called they were called out or had the exodus coming out then they were called the church because it was then they separated themselves from the rest of the world and the very word church means called out exodus come out each one of us now in the spiritual that was natural each one of us as christian has had an exodus in our life so just like israel came out of the world in egypt each one of us do we have the time where we came out of the world everybody clear we had a time where we were called out from among our associates call that from among the people that we want fellowship with and become a different people to work with a different people that adapted a different way and talk a different way he was an exodus in our life everybody cleared so far now the third one brother branham said that israel again was the people of god until we found in acts 7 38 i love brother branham if you are putting it down that then they were called the church of god because they were called by god out of egypt out of the world and away from other churches all the way from other religions to work with god alone the church of god today is the same thing called out of everything of the world called out of every religious cult called out of every religious denomination called out of every religion organization to work with god not to be governed by a bishop but being governed by christ in this messiah kingdom that we live in christ is the king and christ is day one so brother branham gives us a scripture on acts chapter 7 verse 38 let's go to that scripture say wednesday so let's take it as sunday school if you dare you can say amen chapter 7 verse 34 you there you can say amen brother branham keeps saying that when israel was in egypt they were what the people of god when they came out of egypt they were called what the church of god where does brother branham get that act chapter 7 verse 34 i have seen i have seen the affliction of what my people which is in that's why brother branham said that when they were in egypt they were called what the people of god everybody clear now i see they are fleeting off my people which is in egypt and i have heard they're groaning and i'm come down to deliver them and now and now come i will send you into egypt this moses whom they refused saying who made you a ruler and a judge the same did god sent to be the ruler and the deliverer by the hand of an angel which appeared to him in the bush he bought them out he brought them out after that he had had short wonders and sons in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness 40 years this is that moses which which said to the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god weighs up to you of your brethren like to me him shall you hear he prophesy about christ everybody clear watch verse 38 brother branham gave us 38. this is he that was in there everybody can you say it loud in the church right in the church in the why in the wilderness because they are out of what egypt that's why brother branham say that when israel was in egypt they were called the people of god when they were out of egypt they were the church of god the prophet is line up with the bible if you don't see it relax that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the month sana and with our fathers who received the lovely oracle to give to us so what i'm trying to bring out here is that when israel came out of egypt israel became the church of the living god so the church under the old dispensation started with a prophet by the name of moses everybody clear and the church in the new testament started by the prophet by the name of paul are we clear now so this church here was under the law but the church down here was under grace everybody clear now now where are we going with this brother stephen in the water of separation brother branham said there's seven different streets represented the seven church ages israel natural everybody see that and the gentile church in spiritual seven churches just exactly the same way this is the key israel had seven churches everybody here so just like we have seven heritages israel also have seven church ages their seven church churches were under the law our seven churches is under grace their seven churches started with moses our seven thirteen decided with paul moses was a prophet paul was a prophet moses wrote the book and paul also wrote the books we clear now all right right in its broom of its best came ahab and married this idolatry and brought an idolatry and caused idolatry in israel the christian church did the same thing out of the dark ages so brother branham is telling you that when israel started in egypt israel started as a church when they came out so brother bradham said through the life journey of israel as a church it started with a prophet by the name of moses but in the middle of that church we found a king that came by the name of ahab and married a woman by the name of jezebel and brother branham said the same thing happened also to the gentile church ages through the dark edges and the dark edges is the edge of the tartarian and under this age if you look in the book of revelation you will find that the bible mentioned the woman jezebel everybody there because what branham said that this is where the church and the state get married together this is where ahab and jezebel got married together so brother branham is telling you that israel had seven church ages naturally and they also have their dark ages through arab and our church ages also have seven churches spiritually and we also have our tartarian church which is their dark ages and what happened here happened also in israel so what happened under jezebel was only a shadow a tap showing you that when god will deal with the gentiles that spirit will come back again in other words spirit does not die everybody clear but brahman continued he said come on writing and married right in the same thing and brought a dollar tree to the christian church again see just exactly perfectly clear in the patmos vision brother branham say one of these days i shall bring up and show you that israel had seven church ages he didn't do it it's up to you to dig and to find out now right seven church ages two and tap exactly with these so we found out now that israel have seven church ages and the gentiles also have seven church ages the seven church churches of israel started with moses ended with elijah and then jesus christ came our seven church ages started with another moses it shall end with elijah and then jesus will come because god does not change everybody clear now let's take hebrew chapter three if you dare you can say amen hebrew chapter three first one everybody there wherefore holy brethren partaker of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our confession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also who moses was faithful in all his house so we're talking about moses for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses this is jesus christ in as much in uh in as much as he who has built the house has more honor than the house for every house is built by some men but he that built all things is god watch now carefully here and moses verily was faithful in his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after it was a shadow everybody here but christ as a son of his own house whose house we are remember we are the temple of god everybody clear if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end so we found in verse 5 here that moses also built a house going solely everybody there let me go back to first five and moses verily was faithful in his house so moses built our house moses built a foundation are you there everybody clear so far just follow me slowly you're gonna come up all right let's go to first corinthians 3. first corinthians 3 if you dare you can say amen verse 9 we read this on sunday but we are liberated together with god you are god's garden husbandry you remember that you are god building remember we just read over there where they say that we are the house of god but moses had the house also are you there now we are dealing with paul paul says that we are the house of god too but let's see if paul also built a house are we going together okay verse 10 according to the grace of god which is given to me as it was so power was also air building everybody clear aniwa as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another built their own but let every man take heed how he built there upon for other foundation can no man lay then that is led which is jesus christ so just like the seven church ages of israel started with a prophet moses and moses laid the foundation of the law are we there building his house on the law in the gentile side paul also comes but paul built the foundation according to the dispensation of the grace that was given unto him everybody built a foundation this one also built a foundation everybody there so at the end of paul of moses ministry something happened let's go to deuteronomy chapter 31 if you dare you can say amen i need to go this way so we clear the smoke one time aussies elijah moses elijah under the law and the grace this one built a house established the law this one built a house laid the foundation establish grace everybody there now before moses died in deuteronomy 31 verse 24 if you dare you can say amen moses said and the bible say and he come to pass when moses had made an end of writing the word of this law he established the law in a book until they were finished that moses commanded the leader which bore the ark of the covenant of the lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the side in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that he may be therefore for a witness against you why against them let's continue verse 27 for i know everybody there your rebellion and your stiff neck behold while i'm yet alive with you this day you have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death so before paul moses died moses says that i know i'm gonna die but i already seen your behavior i laid the foundation i prophesied that the messiah will be coming but i know when i'm gonna leave you will rebel against god after my death everybody clear verse 28 gathered to me all day [Music] why the elder so before the death of moses moses gathered all the elders the elders of your tribe and your offices that i may speak this word in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them watch verse 29 for i know that after my death you will orderly corrupt yourself everybody seen that and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you i have led the foundation i have given you the law but i know when i'm dying and going you're gonna live that love everybody clear and evil will before you in the ladders you see the latter's days because you would do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hand so paul built a house establish a house before he died he said i know call me there elder when i'm gonna leave you're gonna leave the foundation that i have built for you that's moses paul also built a house but let's see if at the end of paul's death who is gonna become are we okay all right let's go to act chapter 20. that's why we call this a vaccine one time and no more problems are you there that's a sense of humor act chapter 20 verse 17. everybody there and for me lettuce this is paul he sent to ephesus and called who everybody clear called the elders off there over there they called the others off israel everybody clear elders elders why are they calling the elders let's go to verse 29 everybody there for i know this that after my departure shall grieve yous wolf entering among you not sparing the flock so paul is saying that when i leave schwaber will come after me greenville's wolf will enter let's continue verse 39 30. also on your own self so there were people that would get in cause trouble but within yourself your rank in the message some people that were with you will turn around everybody there shall men arise speaking perverse things they first believe with you then suddenly they turn around to draw away disciple after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears everybody there verse 32 and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance an inheritance among all them which are satisfied i have coveted no man's silver or god or a peril so paul also is saying that i already laid the foundation but i know when i leave that foundation that i have established sooner than later you're gonna depart from it but i am commanding you to god and to the word like moses said i have given you the law but i know when i die you're gonna depart from the law everybody clear all right where are we going with this let's go now to first samuel chapter eight then you see why two churches israel natural the broad spiritual moses elijah the coming of the lord moses elijah the coming of the lord moses laid the foundation paul lay the foundation before the end paul said the elders come here before the end moses said the elders come here okay now remember when moses started israel church ages started are we there first samuel chapter eight one verse seven verse one to seven and he came to pass israel is in the promised land when pro when samuel was old that he made his son judges over israel now the name of his firstborn was joel the name of his second ebay they were judges in bathsheba and his son walked not in his ways but turned aside after luke and took brab and perverted judgment then aldi who did moses won what are the elders looking for when the children of the prophet begin to misbehave are you there the elder took opportunity to bring the agenda blaming on the prophet children they act like they are against the behavior of the prophet children but they are not let's go the elders verse 4 of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel to rama and said to him behold you are old and your son walk not in your ways now make us a king to judge us like older if the son have a problem let's deal with the prophet's son according to the word but don't take the prophet's son as an alibaba as a reason for you to reject the message of god are you there first 6 but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us they want to be judged as the other nation they forget that they were different nation they want to copy other people who did that the elders everybody there and samuel prayed the lord now it's god speaking and the lord said to samuel watch what god is saying hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you for they have not rejected you it looks like the people the elder rejected the prophet of the land but god says that when they are coming attacking your children attacking the prophet children are you there they are coming attacking the prophet children and they want to be like they are the denomination it is not you the prophet that they are rejecting they are not rejecting the messenger are you there he says they are not rejecting you but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them in other words by rejecting the messenger they are rejecting god who did that the elders why the elders exposition of the seven church ages you will recall that are brought out in the ephesian churches that the word nicolet comes from the greek word nicao which means conquer and leo which means the laity nicoleten means to conquer the laity now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because god never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moved with political miners are you there thank you he has placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit filled word living man who lead the people through feeding them the word that word feeding means it's a pastor a church must be under a pastor but that pastor must be on them filled with the spirit and he himself leaving the world and preaching the word everybody there it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation there is nobody higher than the other everybody there god wants all to love and serve him together that's why i told you this church is not one-man show we are all together in this are you there nicoletanism destroy those press those precepts and instead separate the minister from the people and make the leader of the lord instead of servant instead of pastor staying pastor pastor becomes like president are you there now this doctrine actually started as a deed in the first stage it appeared that the problem lay in two words elders presbyters or and overseer or bishop so the key here moses before he died he called the elders paul before he died he called their elders why and we found in the day of samuel the elders come and reject the prophet and reject god because the elders the word elder is where the nicolette and spirit enter are we there all right in the ephesian churches paul's wolf remember paul said that when i would leave there will be grievous wolf brother branham said paul's wolf had become are you there so the nicolet and spirit did not start in the church ages he started in israel are you there they were trying to form a priesthood like the levitical priesthood which was foreign to the new testament doctrine the nikawa the greek word nico which means to conquer overcome overcome what the laity the holy spirit when they rejected samuel god said they rejected so the elders were pushing the holy spirit away that's why the sovereignty is always to the church when you remove the sovereignty from the people you have conquered the people because brother branham said that the majority is considered as the holy ghost are you there another seer trying to take the holy ghost away from the laity and give it to another call a holy order man placing them over there laity in other words we don't want god anymore we want to have a king like other nations somebody who rules who's doing that the elders which are paused wolves which are nicolette second seal you remember the white horse rather now had no clown when he started everybody knows now now why he was there the new collecting spirit to begin with so brother branham is saying that when paul says that there will be grievous wolf that will enter those grievous wolves where exactly the antichrist in the white horse rather we clear now so what are we talking about we're talking about that in the seven church edges of israel under the law the first seal also was riding are you there that's why brother branham said the seventh seal start from genesis to revelation the sales were running and when the church started again when jesus goes up he sends his spirit on the day of pentecost judah also goes down and he send his spirit back up again and the two spirits begin to work in the second church age which belong to the gentile because spirit don't die are we there so when this spirit started at the end he destroyed the faith of moses he destroyed the faith that moses built remember they had only one law it was the law of moses but before jesus christ came from that one law they had pharisees churches they had sadducees they had the scrabble they had the erodian they had the publican in other words from one law it brought them to a point where they have multiple denomination are you there until the original fell from moses was destroyed that's why elijah must come are you there why the children are under herodian their children are under the pharisees their children are under the sadducees this have a doctrine this have a judgement they don't even know what is the truth so elijah must come and to point them to one faith and say moses prophesied that the lord your god must send you a prophet i need to point you back to the prophet which is the original faith of moses are we clear and in the seven church churches when this started at the end what do we see brother branham saying do you know that when jesus christ came he broke the seals you know that if you have the time god listen to the sermon the sick seal but i'm gonna give you a clue what i'm saying did you notice when the jews ask him when we compare the scripture here with matthew 24. everybody there with their sixth seal the seventh sea was left out brother branham took matthew 24 and begin to show that when jesus was talking jesus was breaking the seals and when jesus hit the seventh seal they asked him when is the time of your coming he said because the seventh seal is always here silence are you there what i'm saying because you see christ say only god himself known not even the angel no wonder it was not even that's the seventh hill you see they hushed nothing taken place angel don't know it nobody knows when he's coming so at the end of the jewish seven church ages elijah comes point them to christ when christ come cross break the seals and in our time also we started with paul paul laid the foundation paul said that when i go graveyard's wolf will come the nicolet and spirit come the white house where they come the jellic the the the the what do you call a uh the palmer worm the the cake worm all those uh uh uh bats we're eating the food we're eating the tree are you there until at the end we end up with denomination we have baptist we have methodists we have catholic we have jehovah witness we have this holiness we have this and this and we are also lost that's why elijah also must come back everybody clear in the church there is uncertainty we got hundred of denominations each one saying ours is right they are no good we got it about 900 different organizations here in the united states how can they all be right now there is an uncertain sound inside in there somewhere it's not sounding right one say you come over and join our church lou leave this one and come join us and the next one say people back pack letters from church to church till they wear it out just changing the name from methodist to baptist to presbyterian to literary to pentecostal to oneness to this twinness my goodness why don't you forget it put your name under lamb's book of life revelation 10 are you there in heaven you won't have to move it no more are you there once you find where christ is and you are anchored in christ you won't move anymore but the problem is baptist methodist presbyterian herodian sadducee pharisee who's talking the truth we don't know that's why elijah must come are we clear let's take john chapter 5. sometimes we get in a message we don't even understand the purpose of the message and then we don't know how to appreciate john chapter 5 verse 45 everybody there you can say amen do not think that i will accuse you this is jesus talking to the father there is one that accuses you even who so jesus when he came the jews don't want him anymore they said moses said moses said jesus look at them he said do you know who in heaven is accusing you because in heaven there is too anointed moses and elijah over there moses is the one accusing you let's go in whom you trust everybody moses gave them one law but they end up many denominations paul wrote the new testament we got one bible what do we have today baptist mentor this presbyterian pentecostal from one bible and jesus said the one who accuse you is not me it is moses who gave you the law verse 46 for you for had you believed moses you would have believed for he wrote off in other words you never have faith in the law you pretend like you believe the lord if you would believe the lord the lord told you that i am coming are you there people claim we want paul we want paul we want the bible we want the bible you don't believe the bible if you believe the bible the bible spoke of malachi fowl the rejection of jesus proved that you didn't believe the law the rejection of the message of the hour proved that you don't believe the bible verse 47 but if you believe not his writing how shall you believe my word in other words you don't have confidence in the bible that's why you cannot believe the message you think oh no we need the bible we want to go to the bible you don't believe the bible because the bible spoke of the end time ministry so elijah must come and bring them back to their faith what is that faith you ready now okay brother branham notice so the scripture is strictly interpreted by itself notice he shall turn his first coming the heart of the father to his children the heart of the father to his children who's that john the baptist okay taking the old patriarch father the jews and turning their faith to this new children faith are you there because the bible says that john was fulfilling father to children but when the son of god came how many children came one are you there not many children but when jesus was teaching are you there jesus had the tendency to say except you have a faith like a leader you remember that are you there when they brought leader children and jade and the disciple begin to rebuke them jesus said don't do that for the kingdom of god of heaven is like those the faith of the father to them their faith to this new child children faith off are you there jesus coming before him i am coming before jesus in other words john is saying i came before jesus but there is one coming after me he shall baptize you with the holy ghost okay the messiah coming turning their heart everybody there away from the two are you there so john was pulling them from the lawn and said this law mess you up the law was only a temporary substitute my job is to take you back to the living god are you there and this and in his second coming he will turn the heart of the children back to the original pinnacle let's leave that first he's pulling them from the law to this this who christ why is he pulling them from the law take hebrew seven we will be wanding up sooner if you dare you can say amen everybody there hebrew chapter seven everybody there verse 11 if the if therefore what perfection whereby the levitical priesthood for under it the people received her paul is saying that the people received the law if their law could bring somebody or make somebody perfect what father need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not to be called after the order of aaron in other words aaron was the levitical priesthood they were working working working but god promised that i will send you a priest after the order of mercy and paul is telling them if the law was sufficient to bring you to perfection why did god open another priesthood under melchizedek in other words the opening of another priesthood was showing that the law was imperfect the law was not good enough to bring you to perfection let's go to verse 19 are you there for the lord made nothing everybody clear the law made nothing perfect but bringing in air better hope did by day which we joined here too in other words their law was just to give you hope that someday the messiah will be coming are you there job to verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not permitted to continue by reason off they were dying but this man because he continued ever has enough changeable priesthood are you there verse 25 wherefore he is able to save them to the other mosques that come to god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such a high priest became us who is holy homeless undefiled separated from sinner and made higher than the heaven who need no daily sacrifice in other words the law every year or after two three years the priests were dying but when jesus christ came he died he rose again jesus doesn't die anymore but when the priests were dying they were changing the priest died they changed him the high priest died the change but jesus doesn't die anymore in other words this priesthood will never change everybody clear let's jump to hebrew chapter 9 chapter 9. we are trying to find out what is faith the faith of john what is it hebrew chapter 9 verse 11 are you there but christ become a high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves that's the law but by his own blood he enter in once into the holy place having obtained what eternal what redemption [Music] he doesn't go every year like the priest one time finish are you there verse 13 for if the blood of bulls and goat the lord and the ashes of the afer springling the unclean sanctify the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead work to serve the living god job to verse 26. for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away remember the lamb of god that take away to put away sin by the sacrifice of what john was pulling them from the law to christ why because the law could not bring anybody perfect are you there so far we're almost there let's go to chapter 10 of hebrew now we're going to clench it everybody there i want you to read with me for the lord have a shadow off you see that it was just a shadow of good things it was just pointing you that something better is coming good things to come and not there it was not the exact thing not the very image of the thing can never everybody see that never with those sacrifice which they offer yearly continually may make their comment thereon too in other words the law can never bring you to perfection never everybody there for then would they have not ceased to be offered because the worshiper once purged should have no more conscience of sin if somebody bring the lamb they bring it to moses they lay hand on they go out and they do the same thing it was not purging the conscience are you there but in those sacrifice there is remembrance again made of sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and gold should take away what that's why john said behold the land of god that do what that's why john in other words when john said behold the lamb of god that take away sin john is pulling them from the law he's taking them out of the law saying that the blood of bulls and god can never take away sin i'm bringing you to somebody who can wipe seed away are you there verse 11 and every priest stand daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice we can which can which can never verse 11 never take away do you see that never let's go to verse 18 now where there is where remission of sin of this is there is no more offering for in other words christ has offered himself one time so what is that faith now this is your last scripture let's go to galatian now we understand what was john doing john was pulling them back to the fifth week first that moses spoke off are you there moses said the lord your god shall send you a prophet what verse uh galatians chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen and we will be winding verse 16. you there now to abraham and his seed where the promise made he says not and to his seeds in other words god didn't say seeds plural god says seed as singular are you there as many but as one and to your seed which is because in the back in the garden of eden the seed of the woman shall crush the head that seed was crust one seed are you there let's go down to 17. and these are saying that the covenant that was confirmed before god in christ the law which was 430 years after cannot this i know that it should make the promise of non-effect in other words the law when he came the law did not stop the promise of abraham the province of abraham was still valid but god gave the law as a temporary solution everybody there verse 18 for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise wherefore then served the law paul now is showing now you say now what is the purpose of the lord and paul if you say the law was only a temporary solution so why did god send the law what then served the law he was added because of what everybody see that transgression till there should what should come to whom the promise was made and he was ordained by angel in the end of where medieval in other words paul is saying that they gave you the law as a temporary solution until christ come everybody seen that jump to verse 23 now we're trying we are talking about christ now right the law to christ watch this very carefully i don't want you to miss this if you were sleeping wake up verse 23 but before faith come so faith was not there everybody clear fourth was not there are you there but before faith come who is faith remember we try to see what is fifth okay and we're gonna wind up okay he said before faith come came we were kept under though you see now we were under the law because faith did not come you see now and elijah will return the heart of the father to the fifth of the children but faith was not come here back at the camp yet then we give you the law you see now but before faith came which were kept under we were kept under the law shut up to the faith which should come which should afterward be revealed later on wherefore the law was our school master to bring us to the faith is what christ are you there that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come which faith faith is christ are you now after that faith is come we are no longer under the school in other words we are no more living under the law are you there for all you are all children of god by faith in christ jesus everybody there for as many as you have been baptizing christ have put on christ there is neither jew no more israel no greek no more berries there is neither born nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all in christ jesus and if you be christ then you are abraham seed and heir according to the promise so elijah must come to take the faith of the jewish father and to bring them to the faith of christ because the jewish were under law until faith come which is christ and when that faith was delivered that faith never changed that's why jude said content for the faith that was once delivered to the scent and when we go throughout the the ages we lost the faith so elijah must come down to bring you back to the faith of the pentecost and the faith of the pentecost was the faith that john introduced repent be baptized and you shall be filled with the holy spirit peter comes he say repent be baptized and you shall be filled with what the holy spirit that was the faith toward the ages is lost so now they have to take the children and bring them to the faith of their father because the father were the one that gave their faith all right we're closing here the first time elijah come he turned the heart of the father the old patriarch father back there the old jews to the faith of the children that just receive him and believe on the coming messiah yeah it might not be just one person but it shall be a message in the church the holy spirit in the church to swing that faith back again to the original that's right for he will turn the heart of the children back to the father the first time he turned the heart of the father to the children this time the heart of the children to the father taking the faith that the father had in the law and placing over here on the children the one that's just them coming in into christ and this time he is to take that same faith are you there we go that's why brother branham said keep going back to the pentecostal back to the pentecostal back to the pentecostal father are you there the same faith because they got away from the original and he is god to turn fifth of the father he is going to turn the faith of the father all the children back to their father the pentecostal father another what aptitude would mean what they are pouring off their holy spirit that's why brother branham said the token could not come until the evening message because the evening message turn you back to the faith of the that's why jesus said when i shall come should i find faith are you there should i find faith with faith the faith of christ once he was established it is the eternal salvation jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we left that faith on pentecost throughout the ages that faith was lost then elijah now will come take the heart of the children and send them to the faith of the father you say brother stephen the children are the children of israel that's wrong go study revelation you will see that the 144 thousand are called servant study a book the children are the children of god the 144 000 are servant elijah and moses are going to bring servant not children are you there but malachi 4th we take children back to the faith of them because that faith was once delivered to the sent and jude say content fight for this faith don't let it go why because a nicolet spirit is coming in he's going to destroy that faith he's going to take away that faith through the ages until we end up into baptist methodist presbyterian this oneness twoness treatments we don't know who is right that's why elijah must come to point you back to the original faith that was the ministry of john the baptist let's turn you pray for us get 18 on sunday let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and your blessings lord father thank you for opening our eyes to understand these things lord you spoke in your word that you are not the author of confusion confusion comes from the devil father you came to identify yourself clearly without a shadow of doubt so that our faith will not be wavering but our faith will be anchored one time on the solid rock of the revelation lord we have expressed what you put in our heart lord showing lord father the pattern of you the unchanging god lord how you started with israel how what happened in israel in the natural is exactly the repetition of the church in the spiritual lord you started with a mighty prophet by the name of moses father you gave him the law he established the house he put the foundation of of of law of law but the nicolet and spirit enter in and destroy alone but father we thank you because there is always a promise of restoration that's why you say lord that elijah will come and take the father that were already lost in the denomination of sadducees pharisees herodians publican and you brought them back to the faith that was already spoken by moses lord father which is crust the solid rock lord father that faith was delivered in the day of pentecost you are poor in the holy spirit lord and we found out that you started through a pure church and then the nicolet and spirit also ooze into the church lord and destroyed that faith lord but according to job chapter two you say that i will restore say the lord the year that the pomerol the kankaram the caterpillar have eaten you say that you will restore lord father and you send us elijah again lord to restore us back to that origin of faith bringing the genuine holy spirit back again lord father people might spoke my might say lord father that in the day of brad branham there was the pentecostal father yes in the day of john the baptist lord we found that the holy spirit also was moving through gift under simeon under anna the prophetess under many people lord but that was not the full restoration that was just the beginning of it lord all of them were still pointing towards you christ and we found in this end time lord that despite the move of the pentacles with the restoration of the gift lord there was still a message coming up praying lord praying as lord back again to christ jesus which is the message of the hour lord may we uphold and cherish this message lord father if we believe the bible there is no way lord we can reject the message rejecting the message is a sign that we never believe the bible rejecting lord father jesus was a son that the pharisee never believed the law of moses because moses spoke of you because the bible speak of this day this latter day lord before your second coming to come and take away your breath father strengthen this church lord help us lord keep us lord as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you continue to pray one for another god bless you brother god bless you all how many is thankful for to be under that dispensation of grace i know i know i am um we know uh we we know brother branham taught us that um brother brahm taught us that to when the prophet goes off the scene the people denominate and uh as brother shango was saying you know over the church ages we watch the people denominate get confused around the ranks of the word but that's why i took god to send us a prophet to bring back the fullness of the word and uh you know we know that god and his word are one so for us to dig into his word to get a true revelation of his word and to see you know the prophet um that you know god used to bring forth the word and have a fullness of the word that is that is how you know we can become god's bride you know we can be one with god being uh one with his word that's that's my desire i just want to learn more about his word every day of my life i want to dig in i want to grow get a greater revelation because i know like heaven and earth will pass away but he said his word will never pass away so how many of you want to be more like his word because we know that's where eternal life lies fill [Music] an empty vessel i want to be so that you can come [Music] write your word in my heart [Music] spirit of god [Music] my [Music] so that you can come lord [Music] you
