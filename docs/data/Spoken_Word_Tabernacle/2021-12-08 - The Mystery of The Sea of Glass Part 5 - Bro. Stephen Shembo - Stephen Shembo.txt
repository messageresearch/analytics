is his 47th anniversary 47 4 and 7 amen so brother sam if you are streaming god richly bless you for the number of deliverance and seven completion amen blessed be the name of the lord how many are up to date with their sermon can i see your hand okay praise be the name of the lord okay let's go to the scripture somebody's lagging behind you're going to find yourself way way way way way behind and before you know it it will be question and answer and those question has been already answered like somebody gave me a question and i checked they were not in the service on sunday and the question was answered on sunday so make sure you do the best to be in service if you can amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to genesis 14 again there is still like a rebound or something with the sound is everything okay can you hear me okay okay yeah there's still something going on genesis 14 verse 18 if you dare you can say amen and melchizedek king of selem now you understand what it is brought forth bread and wine i i hope by god's grace we can reach there melchizedek king of salem we know he's king of salem he brought bread and wine i hope we can reach bread and wine amen amen and he was depreased you might be seated let me try to close this off and then start a backup again a funny nose is it okay now if not i switch to the bazooka is it better okay i can feel i can hear it in my ear coming back the devil he tried the first thing on me i said and i was about to take an over-the-counter medication and say no i'm not gonna take it then he goes then he flips something else on me then i pray it's gone then i get here he start attacking the computer now the computer is working now he's in the sand oh my what is he trying to block tonight [Music] and melkissa the king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god we know already that melchizedek is a king but the scripture never says that mercy is a high priest am i reading a different bible can you check your bible the bible didn't say melchizedek high priest he was a priest he was depressed so who's the high priest he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which has delivered your enemy into your hand and he gave him tithe of all everybody clear so far let's go to psalm 110 again if you're there you can say amen i hope somebody is awake amen amen the lord has sworn and will not repent you everybody are a priest so there is somebody else here that god didn't call him high priest is the next an unknown person and that person is called a priest so this one a priest under melchizedek melchizedek a priest where is the high priest amen hallelujah you are a priest forever he is not just a priest but he is a priest forever why forever amen you are a priest forever after we already know after means like or in the simulation after the order of melchizedek what does it mean to be a priest forever under the order of melchizedek what does he mean let's go to hebrew chapter seven the book of hebrew is wide open amen amen blessed be the name of the lord just relax we will be okay don't be tense if you go tense then you miss it if you just relax then it's something amen hebrew chapter seven if you dare you can say a man verse 15 in the book of psalms they say he's a priest forever now paul is explaining that because the hebrew give us more light about melchizedek amen and it is yet far more evident that for that after the simulated you see that after the likeness after the simulated of melchizedek there arises another priest we have a levitical priesthood existing but paul is saying that it was necessary that another priest comes up but that priest when he come on the scene he must look like melchizedek amen verse 16 who is made hey marquise not after the law of carnal commandment that's the levitical priesthood but after the power of an endless life because we know melchizedek have no beginning of days no ending of life no father no mother so melchizedek this priest and king is eternal anybody here and the one that they spoke of in psalm 110 they say also that he also have the power of endless life in other words this person also is eternal everybody care yet they say that he is after like melchizedek here let's go to verse 17 for the power of endless life everybody for he testifies you are a priest everybody forever after the order of melchizedek i want to go back again so you understand what is going on here let's go back to verse 16. put your seatbelt who is made not after the law of corner commandment everybody here but after the power of an endless life so this man is eternal and to prove that he's eternal now paul is giving us a scripture that is backing up the fact that this man is eternal amen america and the scripture paul is giving us is psalm 110 now verse 17 paul is giving the scripture he said for he testifies is what he's testifying that this man is eternal but how did he testify that this man is eternal in the old testament he testified that this man is eternal by saying this that you are a priest forever everybody here so when god said you are a priest forever ever here he was speaking about this priest being eternal amen did i lose somebody oh you want me to repeat again we're clear okay so this priest has the power of endless life or this priest is eternal so when we say he is a priest forever meaning you're not going to change this feast this priest will never die this priest ever started already existed and continue to exist that's why they say forever meaning that there is a power of endless life of deep or this priest is eternal so if this one is eternal this one is eternal how many priests do we have by where is the high priest because the bible didn't say that he was a high priest the bible didn't say that this one also is a high priest the bible just said these two look alike and this is eternal this is eternal but we know that there is one person that is eternal who is amen here verse 18 for there is verily a disarnoling of the commandment going before for the weakness and an unprofitableness thereof that's the law verse 19 for the law made nothing perfect you remember this now we spoke about this on sunday but they're bringing in of a better hope the law was pointing to something amen the law was telling us that one day heaven will come down so the lord duplicate heaven first as a copy but it was the it was not the original so the law was saying one day the original will come down amen for the lord made nothing perfect but they're bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw night to god that's the second testament amen verse 20 and in as much as not without enough he was made a priest for those priests were made without enough so under the levitical prison the priests were uh uh appointed to their office without enough as long as you leave out you under the lineage of aaron automatically you have preached you can go ahead and do it except if you have a defect if you have an impediment or one leg is shorter than the other it's a problem but melchizedek take care of it amen for those priests were made without enough that's the levitical priest but this this one under melchizedek with enough by him that said unto him the lord saw amen how can the lord sow on this one the lord saw and will not repent god will not change again we back again in psalm 110 in hebrew everybody the lord so and will not repent you are a priest forever after the order of melchizedek the first reading melchizedek the king and priest not the high priest brought his son bread and wine melchizedek is eternal without beginning of day with our ending with our mother with our father everybody but on psalm 110 we find somebody that is unknown who is a priest after the order of melchizedek this person also is eternal and when they appointed him a priest they appointed him a priest with enough everybody here why did they give him enough verse 22 by so much was jesus do you have your bible amen i heard you here under the anointing okay all right by so much was jesus everybody made water so paul is saying here that this unknown person here is who so if this man is jesus we must check the qualities of melchizedek you hear me and make sure jesus have the same qualities if not jesus is not mercy did you hear me i wish the whole church was here he said by so much was jesus made a surety or a guarantee of a better testament so god wanting to express to us that on this work here on the levitical priesthood i'm not guaranteeing anything because it's the blood of bulls and goats but under this covenant here i take my seal and i put it right there that's why you heard jesus saying that he have the father seal in other words the approval segment of the father all the intelligence of god was locked in the masterpiece called jesus christ in other words if jesus fell god fell so god made sure god made sure that his entire let me explain it to you if you have gm okay gm has a lot of cars you have malibu you have uh uh what is it uh chevy you have uh what do you call it uh gmc and you have cadillac there is three of them right you're going to learn something today ever here so the normal basic category of gm is chevy anybody here if you want to go a little bit this is regular so i'm going to help you up this is like guys regular have i got a clear you got chevy you're on a regular about here if you want to go on the plus 89 do you hear me am i losing somebody if you want to go on the plus you get the gmc anybody here if you watch the the suburban of uh chevrolet chevy and gmc they all look alike outside their body looks exactly the same what is different is just a little future but it's one company making that up you hear me and then if you want to go to premium what do you get you get a cadillac everybody ever here so on the cadillac this is the top the highest point that gmc that gm can achieve everybody here so when gm is designing cadillac he finished his entire intelligence into cadillac if you want to see the top of gm you got to get in cadillac and he made sure that cadillac should be higher compared to the other car because this is his signature you hear me so god also when he was making christ that's why brother branham preached the message peace everybody when god was designing his masterpiece god took his entire intelligence and put it in jesus christ everybody here so if you want to see god in his supreme intelligence you need to meet the man jesus christ [Music] everybody if you really want to know how god think how god reacts how god talks how god eat just go see jesus christ [Applause] because jesus was the visible image of the invisible god if you never that's why he said philip wait a minute all this time you never understood that if you see me you see who in other words if you go to heaven you're going to see a house if you get in our house you'll see a big picture and that picture that you will see there is the owner of the house when you get to heaven that picture will look like this one [Applause] everybody here so when they say the lamb he's sitting on the right hand of god it doesn't mean god is sitting here and jesus is on the right hand catholicism anybody here if john search around in heaven and could not see jesus christ by the mic and he searched on the earth and could not see jesus christ and he went in there under the heaven and jesus christ was not there then somebody told him jesus is there where was hiding jesus where was jesus then who was on the throne why john didn't see him on the throne let's pray you warm up pretty good now heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for everything your grace your love your mercy and everything that you have been doing for us father we are committing ourselves unto the hand tonight and we have done what every man that you have given a normal ability to do can do but when it comes to blessing your children imparting eternal life or further decoding the scripture it's only one person that can do it that was the lamb who was found worthy to take the book and to break the seal to look their own lord father and to free us from the work of darkness father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and anoint us lord father like never before and speak to us all and bless your children even those that are streaming in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are going up with part five we're still dealing with the priest when we finish the priest that will get into the clothing of the priest lord's willing amen blessed be the name of the lord now we saw that the mystery of deliver is a mystery that goes with the priesthood it is not just like a pool or a or uh like a basin where somebody come and wash their hand and go there is more to it because when god does something there is always a message behind it everybody and we found that the lever is always in connection with the priesthood everybody here it's in connection with the priesthood why because when they made the lever at first it was for the priest to wash the hand and and then to wash their feet about here and from there on we saw where foot washing started ever here blessed be the name of the lord then we found out that under the same level the priests were watching the sacrifices everybody before they offered the sacrifices and the of and the washing of the sacrifices they have to baptize the sacrifice into the world everybody here so we found out that from there came the word of baptism amen and back here now the third thing that we found about the and back here that's why you have the washing of defeat here and the sacrifice was in exodus chapter 40 where god told moses bring aaron and his son and wash them with the water ever here so when god told him about washing not the hand and the feet only but washing the priest themselves and washing the priest and the children of the priest everybody care but the problem was that when we look under this leave this priesthood here the levitical priesthood here this priesthood was not perfect hallelujah the bible said in hebrews chapter 9 verse 7 that but into the second veil when they say the second veil if you remember on sunday the tabernacle was like this this was open to the outside and the second one this was the holy place and the holiest about here the tabernacle only have two veils here when you're coming on the outside up over here you can see the sun and the moon and the star no problem once you get here you don't see the sky anymore once you get there you don't see the sky anymore back here so from here to here you have the first veil that we spoke about on sunday everybody then when you leave here before you enter the holy of holies you have the second veil this is the veil that was rent when jesus christ died on the cross ever here so now paul is referring to the second veil because what was here was a gate we understand now blessed be the name of the lord paul said into the second veil went to the high priest alone nobody only the high priest once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the error of the people what was this signifying paul said the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest right here but here of the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest in other words it was not revealed yet while as the first tabernacle was yet standing in other words as long as the first levitical priesthood is still valid nobody has a right to enter the holy of holies everybody here nobody could do that paul continued he said which was a figure for the time then present can you imagine wasting your time you can handle that my brother for the time present which was the figure all this time he doesn't scan only right now [Laughter] which was the figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service water as pertaining to the water so regardless of how many things the high priest was doing here nevertheless when the worshiper leaves they still have the desire of sin in other words whatever was done under the first levitical priesthood could not purge the conscience could not purge the heart of the believer the believer come with the desire of sin and he goes back home again with the same desire of sin about here so that's why the law was a substitute america it was a temporary solution to cover the sin of the people and the law was pointing us to a better priesthood and that priesthood was supposed to take care of the conscience of the people and remit sin ever here so from there on the law was speaking about the coming of another priesthood everybody here and we saw that that priesthood that was coming was the priesthood of melchizedek back here and when we tried to get into the priesthood of melchizedek the first thing that we saw was after abraham came from the border melchizedek gave him water [Music] now we have brother one amen amen you have your three ordinances that must be must be must continue until jesus christ everybody here that's why we have communion bread and wine that's why we're still doing water baptism and that's why we have food washing those three mysteries was locked under the lever hallelujah brother branham say after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious chad water communion think of that part of water do you hear me because right here the worshiper could not pre-purge so god could not enter human being god could not take a part of himself and import it into a human being so god gave a shadow of melchizedek which is a better priesthood and god gave that as a tap that after under this priesthood i might be able to take a part of me and put it into a human being ever clear that's why on the day of pentecost after jesus christ died and rose again and the veil of the temple was broken in two and showing that the way to the holiness was open now on the day of pentecost when the peanut of fire came down the peanut of fire divided itself into many now god begin to enter human beings why because melchizedek opened the way blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah he said now we want to see here in tap here is in view tap view they come that's why paul said the old testament was a shadow he was showing you things to come back here in view the communion after the battle he gave off water because the communion is a part of water but prague that cross could not be imported into a human being until he himself died for our sins everybody and after the struggle is over after you have done got yourself wiped out then is when you partake of water become part of water why are you part of his being because he took a fraction of himself and he put it in you everybody here have you ever seen the big magnet and a small magnet if you put a small magnet and a big magnet if you move the big magnet you will see the small one moving like this so when jesus christ come under the baptism of the holy spirit he take a fraction of himself and he put it in you so when god moves you moving when god is moving you moving when god is talking you talking about here because you become now a part of that being amen hallelujah hallelujah jacob russell night and would not turn him loose until he blessed him that's right batter for water and after the batter is over then god give you off water that is the true communion the little bread and what just represented it you should not take it unless you have wrestled it out and become part of water that's why if you don't have the holy ghost you should not be partaker of communion when you go into the lord's supper you are showing people that i have the holy ghost [Applause] did you hear me did you hear me when you go toward the baptism it's a nature of a good conscience of an odd world work you showing people that i have accepted jesus christ i am identified with his death and i am out when you go into communion and foot washing you are telling the people that i have already overcame myself by the new birth that's why i'm partaking of bread and wine everybody creates so far blessed be the name of the lord so the law as we stated on sunday was our school master we explained to you on sunday he just gave us a conscience an awareness of what sin was he was a school master to bring us unto christ why that we might be justified by water because the justifier by faith is jesus christ he is the author and the water and the finisher of your faith so the law was pulling us all the way to christ when he put you on cross and cross hand on the rest back here hey but here that's why jesus says this on john chapter 5 verse 45 he says to the jews he said do not think that i will accuse you to the father everybody there is one that water accuses you even who if moses was accusing people so moses was not dead anybody here back here that's why brother branham said when he stepped on the on the rock he died and resurrected again because he is one of those two anointed and he's standing on heaven accusing the jews that this is not what i told them and so for you to accuse there you must be alive so moses was not dead ever here because of my transfiguration at the crowning of jesus christ we saw moses and elijah coming up amen amen ever here moses died and back here and rose again elijah never died ever never died but was taken into a rapture back here so one prophet shows the power of resurrection do you follow me and the other prophet shows the power of translation [Applause] you hear me so when he was time for the adoption of jesus christ because the adoption is a crowning is a crime of a ministry it is jesus christ have reached the highest point of his ministry about here he opened to power he unfolds to power he unfold the power of resurrection and the power of translation that's why after moon transfiguration jesus christ went and broke the seals [Music] is he soaking is he shocking is he shocking and when he finished he went down to hell and resurrect everybody that was there and he didn't stop about resurrecting the old testament sam but he also took them to the rapture because those two power unfolded themselves the power of resurrection and the power of rapture he comes in the mountain under a cloud [Applause] [Music] did you hear me did you hear me somebody said no let me start it again jesus could heal the seeker is it okay you hear me jesus could open the blind eyes the death could hear about here he went and resurrected lazarus but after the death the burial and the resurrection of jesus christ whoever came out from there never would die again ever here and not only did he demonstrate his power of resurrection but he also unfolded the power of the translation he took them all the way to the rapture and back here so when a ministry of the son of man start he starts with healing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he starts with the preaching of the gospel and the healing of the people and then later on jesus begin to discern the people here after the discernment jesus will go into a mountain and in a mountain a cloud will come down and the cloud will give him power to break the seal open and after he breaks the seals open then he can preach to souls in prison but the end of that ministry will bring the resurrection of the dead and the rapture of the old testament center did i lose somebody did i lose somebody did i lose somebody do you want me to repeat one more time so somebody is lost back all up a little bit blessed be the name of the lord can i always listen we are talking about the son of man ministry the son of man ministry you need to understand god by his characteristics because god usually immorphy in other words god changes masks god can appear today like this and tomorrow he can change and appear like somebody else for you to decode that he's god you must make sure you understand his characteristics because jesus christ the same yesterday today and god doesn't change even if he changes mask but the characteristic remains the same [Music] so you must know the dealing with god do you hear me so when he came when he start his ministry you hear me his first was preaching the gospel the bible also said he was teaching the gospel for those who have a problem with teaching you see me i can load you with scripture about it because they always say preach the gospel preach of jesus say go into the whole world and teach you need that you see me and jesus also say preach so we preach and teach you cannot go preach preach preach preach preach and you don't teach you cannot go teach teach teach teach and you don't preach here preaching teaching and then he was healing the sick because the spirit of the lord is upon me he has given me water to open the prison heart to heal the brokenhearted that is the first ministry then later on we found him that as he progresses he began to discern people thought do you remember the woman at the well he looked at peter he said you are bar jonas he looked at natanya he said oh behold an israelite he said master where did you see me say when you were praying over there under the under the what the fig tree i saw you ever care healing of the sick the festival you okay now discernment of the spirit to the second poll [Music] now we okay now we okay then after a certain level of ministry remember over here the pillar of fire came down and said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and dwell on him and the pillar of fire begin to maneuver this the the cadillac by healing the sick i'm not saying jesus cadillac but if you start with me you understand what i'm saying about here healing the sick then he shifted he changed the shift he goes to two and then he move on and he open up again and back here and the horsepower will open up again that's when you hear [Music] it keep moving back here then from there on jesus move to a certain level in his ministry and deliver require him to go to the mountain everybody here for whoever was lost you need to listen carefully when he went to that mountain a cloud meeting ever here in the cloud in that cloud came moses and elijah the power of resurrection that will resurrect the descent that are already dead and the power of the rapture that will take those sent into the presence of god and back here it is called the crowning of the ministry or his adoption ever here over here this is my beloved son in whom i am well but over here this is my beloved son do what he hear him in other words he become the man of peace whatever he says it's already agreed [Applause] [Music] ever here and brother branham shows that when he came down from there that ministry didn't last too long hey mark here brother bottom saying when he came down in matthew 24 he opened the seals we already demonstrated that to you when we were over there ever here if you go to matthew 24 you will see all the seals when he reached the seventh seal because the seven seal is silenced when they ask him when is the time of your coming he said no i don't know about it because he must keep quiet ever clear so far everybody cares so far ever clear so far and at the end this is called the third pool ministry of christ this ministry when he finished it will bring the people that died before everybody that died from adam all the way to jesus christ this ministry will pull them from the grave you hear me change their body and take them to the rapture [Music] are we okay it is the ministry of adoption of the crowning ministry and then that finishes the dispersation of the old testament now the new testament opened up with a new priesthood which is the priesthood of melchizedek now paul died peter died the disciple died mountain died columba died arenas died luther died wesley died we need something that's gonna resurrect those people and take those people to the rapture [Applause] everybody clear so far that's why that same ministry must come back again everybody here remember on sunday there is three group of people we got the jews we got the samaritan and we got the gentile he did the discernment for the jews he did the discernment for the samaritan but there was another group that was left which were the gentiles that discernment was kept for the second coming this was the first coming he needed to come on the second coming and on the second coming we saw somebody baptizing hey people here and the pillar of fire came down and said as john the baptist was a foreigner of your first coming your message will be the foreign of the second water and then we saw him begin to preach and to have him in campaign all over the world and after a while he began to discern them let me help you up normally the one who was supposed to do that is jesus christ himself do you hear me you hear me but if jesus comes back the rapture must take place so we need to keep the body of jesus christ over there but god needs to borrow somebody's body anybody care about here but god could not enter the people under the levitical priesthood he took the melchizedek priesthood to give god permission he can enter human being [Applause] do you hear me you hear me that's why you saw brother branham turning the [Applause] that was his second pull but brother brother must go to a mountain like jesus everybody here brother branham must go to his adoption ministry everybody here that's why you heard brother branham say what happened in sunset because the sunrise is on the east that was jesus christ the sun rises on the east but the sunset is on the west so jesus already did that and somebody named that mountain sunset mountain in the coronado forester coronado in spanish means [Applause] quran why did somebody call that the coronado coronado means the crowning ever here ever here so we knew that it is the crowning of brother branham ministry and when brother branham finished there he came back he preached the seals [Applause] [Music] here now the end of this ministry will pull luther out we'll pull wesley out we'll pull paul out we'll pull all the scent that started all the way to paul and we got everybody together for the rapture [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so when you're reading brother branham you must be careful [Music] sunset mountain why is he called sunset mountain because we are on the west coast the sun is going down it rolls on the east by jesus christ it is going down on the west it was a crowning over there so god usually hide things he said coronado and the hispanics say why is he crowning [Applause] everybody here so far everybody so far [Music] when you hear brother branham say michael angelo michael angelo he's not talking about his copter angelo is angel micah the archangel do you remember on sunday brother branham said if you want to cast the devil out of your wife what do you do [Music] get a box of water how can a candy give uh take a devil out everybody here ever here number one when you buy a box of candy you are expressing something you hear me but bottom is not really talking about just the candy because anybody can buy you a candy but that candy means something it's a life behind the candy it's a life behind the candy and that life is expressed by an action you hear me you hear me and can this is sweet or sour [Music] ever here ever here so far so brother brother is telling you what drives the devil out is a sweet life [Music] did you hear me coronado crowning michelangelo michael the archangel give her a box of candy bring that sweet mixed spirit he cast out the devil [Applause] [Music] brother branham said voices how we need in jeffersonville thousand of water the thunder of god thundering out in water seven thunder it's a life but that life is in sweetness it's a candy life [Applause] ever here in sweetness and water and purity and the fair life walking around indy without water yes sir real water that is the thunder against the enemy that's your box of candy ever here the devil don't care how loud you are the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what water the devil is to see that [Music] [Applause] say what call him anything on the website say what you want on the social media call him anything just as water as candy as he can be [Applause] ever here as sweet as he can be and move right on oh my dad throws him away that is the time [Music] [Applause] ever here you must read the prophet in between the line [Applause] he got in his home his home is all upset about here he never sat there and began to preach he took an apron and put that down [Music] some men don't like that [Music] hey here and do you know what it is he begin to talk to his wife about the dress that she liked [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and before you know it what happened at home [Music] did you hear brother branham say in the name of jesus christ i take full control of every spirit here you spend too much energy it's not a sport it's a life [Music] have you got into somewhere people are talking when they see you they stop who stop them who stop them and if you linger they change the subject ever here so far wednesday you see and if i don't preach somebody say he doesn't preach on wednesday he's a pastor and somebody who's tortured said no we need to understand him you see whether when he put the slide he took a lot of time he need more time probably to do it [Music] let me go back here do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even who in whom you trust for had he believed who he would have believed water [Music] moses came to prepare you to receive me you missed the revelation of moses you thought he was a religious actor you thought it was a game coming sin kill a lamb go come don't even understand god is talking god stop god and by missing the revelation you misguided that's what happened in the message of the hour [Applause] the people thought it's another religion it's another book of god it is a life it is the living god the message is christ [Applause] hallelujah let's look at mercy merchandise who is this melchizedek my god blessed be the name of the lord for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the king and blessed him [Music] why did he meet abraham we saw that on sunday the bible says know ye therefore that day which are of what the same are the children of abraham so now it's no more the jews because you might be a jews but you don't have faith you're not a son of abraham and the scripture remember the rich young hula he was a jew he called abraham father abraham everybody but if abraham was his father why was abraham on the other side of him on the other side that's why jesus tell them your father is the devil that's why the difference is there you jew by this but the true jew is a jew here [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen and the scripture brother michael for seeing in other words the truth that there's scripture already seen there that we see where we're heading anybody here foreseeing that god will justify the hidden not the jerusalem through water preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in this shall water i thought he was only israel all nation be blessed so mercy zedek going through everywhere must find somebody who have the promise to attain everybody let me explain it again do you hear me melchizedek wanted to bless everybody because his children are scattered but the law restricted everything to the jew ever here so before the jewish nation start because the jewish nation start by jacob god moved quickly to abraham because abraham was not a jew ever here and when god checked abraham he saw in abraham predestinated pipes a system that can reach every nation because if he would have taken that promise and give it to moses under the law the jews only are saved he said if i put it to this channel it's only one way i need a highway with exit so the 85 was abraham so when he reached abraham he said this is the channel i need so he took that promise and loaded in abraham so that when we are approaching abraham nobody can claim him because abraham was another worshiper [Applause] amen here if you go to a jew he would say jehovah did abraham have the law abraham will have nothing to do with the law so god give it outside of the law outside of the border [Music] the mystery of the level indeed shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with them and now to abraham and his what when we say seed we thought he was isaac here we thought he was isaac but god showed that he was not isaac do you know how god did it he said abraham you have a son your only begotten son while abraham had two sons [Music] are you sleeping [Music] abraham had the first son called ishmael everybody but ishmael was not born of abraham ishmael was the son of abram [Applause] you want to go home you want to go home mother robert kelly you heard them he himself said preach about here abram was the father of ishmael but abraham with h.a.m [Applause] but here was the father of isaac that's why god said your only begotten son because i'm talking to abraham not abraham i already changed him he's now abraham [Applause] he said abraham get your only begotten son they say praise the lord the jews say we got it you see he picked isaac so the whole promise is in isaac so since we are the seed of isaac isaac we got jacob jacob begat liver we got joseph we got this this this so we have claim on isaac he said i'm going to make a sacrifice say yes who isaac the jews over there in heaven they say praise the lord they begin to dance my name is in the book my name is god say don't worry the peak who isaac take isaac go with him his mother this boy is too close to his mama let mama sleep how's it coming get in it where are we going you ask too much question let's get it so maybe sarah thought they're going to walmart to pick up some groceries [Music] ever here he picked up isaac and went with isaac isaac very obedient do this yes father do this yes father he took the altar do you follow me and put isaac on the altar and when he put us across the altar the jews in heaven they begin to shout they say go go daddy go daddy abraham pull the sword quickly the jew said go ahead anoint him so he can do it whenever i want to do this god says stop [Music] the seed is not as it [Music] [Applause] did you hear me the seed cannot be jew he cannot be a gentile it cannot be a samaritan so it's a seed that i must create therefore let me create a rhema if you notice that remember the ram that was created didn't have a father or a mother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] at the opening of the seventh seal the bible become a new [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah did you see that with that father with that mother he created the rhyme he said that's the ramp that you killed not isaac so god still showing that the seed will be a rhema a realm with horner and if you notice they called him by the horn because horns meets power they have to block his power to kill him because if his power is open he can call a legion of angel to deliver him so my father my father why have they forsaken me they gotta block his horn they gotta block his power to kill him because you cannot kill god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't know where i am now hallelujah so to abraham and his what where the promise is what and he says not to seeds house of water because the jews we gathered i can see the jew in heaven and then we the gentile rose and say [Applause] ever here ever here but as of what and that seed which is who hey so far why because in acts chapter 3 verse 25 the bible say ye are the children of the promise of the prophet this is peter coming up coming out of the day of pentecost he tells the jews he say you you are the children of the prophet ever here and of the covenant which god made with our saying unto abraham and in that seed shall all the kindred of help of the earth be water but that promise was for everybody the jews took it and the hook it to the anybody care and when peter say unto you what so first that's why jesus says salvation is of the you understand it was first given to them like get it back unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to do what in turning away every one of you from his water because the worshiper could not be purging conscience so they sent jesus to give them the melchizedek priesthood ever care so far now when jesus came the jew rejected him watch god when the jew rejected him automatically god should go back to the gentile but god lingered again to see if he can negotiate with the jews to at least get them out of work even though they rejected him they say let his blood be upon us normally god should have turned around and just go but god stop again and he said let me try something let me pick paul anybody here when god picked paul paul has three pipes you okay at nine but the lord said unto him go that way for he is a that's paul unto me to bear my name before the first pipe and the second pop and there so that pipe was still there everybody but the jews clogged their pipe from paul so paul had three pipes a park here three pipes we have the gentile we have the king you saw him before king agrippa he have to compare before caesar remember that all those pipes were open that's why he talked to king agrippa and king you almost he didn't understand the pipe was open you hear me and then the jews let's see what the jews after they rejected jesus christ still god left them a little something like that try together get together here here at 26 15 and i said who are that this is paul explaining his experience lord and he say i am jesus whom they are persecuted but rise and stand up on their feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which that has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering deed from the people and from the gentile unto whom now i do what so paul god is telling you him i'm sending you here now everybody so paul should stay no more jews forget about it listen to open their eyes and to turn them the gentile from darkness to water and from the power of satan unto who that they may receive water forgiveness of sin and an inheritance we didn't have that before but melchizedek open it up an inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in that's why paul said the faith the life that i live now i live it by the faith of the son of god hey back here let's see what paul does in acts 13 the bible says but when the jews saw the multitude they were filled with envy they were filled with envy against jesus christ because the multitude were coming to jesus christ instead of receiving jesus christ jealousy god that's why peter our whole pilot understood that they they destroyed jesus by envy so when paul began to preach they found out that a lot of people are coming to power and the jews now were filled with envy and speak against those things which were spoken by who they attacked the message of paul you okay is everybody awake and then contradicting and doing whatever is it you no is he new okay then paul and barnabas what's bold and say he was what that should water you see the pipe you see that pipe you see the pipe but seeing you put it from you after rejecting christ you're still rejecting again this back here and judge yourself unworthy of eternal life lord return to the water do you see that do you see that four so has the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of them that that should be for salvation until the end of the remember beginning in jerusalem samaria and onto melchizedek and when the gentile not the jew heard this they were water and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained predestination to eternal life did what [Music] ever here everybody here where am i at sorry where was i at all right at 18. and when salas and timotheus welcomed from macedonia paul was what who was pressing paul in the spirit ever the jews rejected him the first time i showed you they rejected him the second time still the holy spirit is pushing this channel you see do you see and paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to him that jesus was what and watch the watch again what they do and when they oppose themselves and did what he shook off his remnant and say unto them your blood be upon your head i am clean from his fault i will go unto death do you see how the jews were clogging the pipe take act 28 [Music] where am i at by the robert wednesday wednesday wednesday oh my 16 are you there at 28 i wanted to get to merchandise at 16 28 but somebody's pulling oh after 28 16. you there everybody there are you there okay and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoner to the captain of god but paul was not allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him they took paul to roma and he came to pass that after three days paul called who do you hear it paul called the chief of the jews together for the last time this man is pushing the door again remember the emergency bullet he shoot it's not working he shoot again it's not working he keep shooting they can't get it anybody clear and paul called the chief priest of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them he said to them man and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or custom of our fathers because he's talking to the jew yet was a delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the roman that's why i'm here in roma who when they have examined me the roman would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me but when the jews spoke against it i was constrained in other words i was forced to appeal to caesar so paul saw that there is no way out he just caught i appealed to caesar they said since you spoke peace caesar you got to go to rome i appealed to caesar not that i have anything to accuse my nation of in other words i didn't appeal to caesar so that i'm gonna accuse the jews no i appealed to caesar to escape because these guys don't understand verse 20 for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you i call you the jews to see you and to speak with you because for the hope of what i am bound with this chain for the last time the apostle is banging the door anybody clear and they said to him we need to receive a letter out of judea concerning you neither any of the brethren that came short or spoke any harm of you but we desire to hear of you what you think for us concerning this religion as concerning this what do you know what except mean do you know what the sect mean except means a cult everybody here they call the ministry of power a cult the call the ministry of god is set you can put me down through eternity and brother branham say i preach like paul [Applause] and if you believe this message and you hear people saying you are under a cult you are under acceptance tell them this day this scripture has been fulfilled [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother branham said they had to come forth must come forth god ordained it so that they must come forth themselves seal must be open it was supposed to be done in this lower dci agent not as we brag we have no brag only on jesus christ none of us we only brag on jesus christ but we are thankful for the privilege of knowing beyond any shadow of doubt god has chosen us in this last day and has proven it by sons in heaven and in the earth and every one of them coming right straight back to the the whole ministry of brother branham i just demonstrated to you by the word and but here to prove that it is so this is that we live in this age that we live in the message and how it is we are not a cult [Music] [Applause] we are not a bunch of fanatics we are servants of god that has been called by the holy ghost you shall have all kind of name talk to you but that don't mean it is [Applause] let them call you brahmite let them call you cult let them call you satan this day this scripture has been fulfilled [Applause] hallelujah one minute to 30. let's go to verse 22 quickly but we desire to hear of you what you think for us concerning this set the paul calls religion nobody can deny paul who is a christian they call paul sect you call with your mayan branham set coat be my guest suit yourself [Applause] it is a pleasure [Applause] because if you don't call himself so he didn't preach like paul so you must make his ministry vindicated [Applause] the ministry of jesus christ goes within salt and blasphemy and if that same ministry came back he doesn't bring the good only he bring also the bad as a confirmation that is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] brother sam where you are at i'm searching for the airport he sent me a message he said brother stephen you landed without permission so brother sam online i'm asking permission to land ever clear verse 22 but we desire you see how the word of god becomes joyful [Music] on wednesday it's no longer boring [Applause] where we sit like this and we keep going but something is bubbling [Music] you say crash crash crash crossing the people keep boring like this because you're speaking of a different christ give them the present they crash he will awaken the predestination [Applause] [Music] give me a few minutes i'm trying to land i will tell you when the when the the will open up so we're going to verse 22 but we desire to hear of you what you think for us concerning this sect jesus we know that everywhere it is spoken against oh you know that message we already heard about it [Music] and when they had appointed him a day they came many to him into his lodging many of the jews let's go remember the last pipe he's pushing the last one many to him to his lodging to whom he expanded and testified the water the kingdom of god persuading them concerning who buff out of the water look where he's pulling jesus christ because moses was bringing us to christ so he began to show them that brethren you missed the revelation the moses was talking about him here both out of the law of moses and out of the water he took even in in another word paul sat and begin by moses and pete and paul christ and took ezekiel and pulled crown and took jeremiah and putra and and we imagine that wow they're gonna receive it here and out of the prophet from water until what [Music] give them coat after coat after coat after coat after coat after scripture after scripture they still don't believe [Music] and some believe the things which were spoken and some water and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well so when they begin to go paul opened his mouth and begin to say something watch what paul says and we're going to head to the airport watch it paul say well spoke the holy ghost by who isaiah the prophet to our father saying go to these people and say hearing you shall hear and shall not and seeing you shasi and shanatan for the heart of these people is wax water stop a little bit who was talking those things [Music] isaiah spoke about it but somebody else was speaking about this was calling the same scripture do you know his name before paul there was somebody when he saw the jews he said this is the way isaiah spoke about you aha aha paul begin to repeat the word of jesus the scripture jesus used on the jews to show them that they were blinded paul under the anointing of the holy spirit begin to rehearse the same thing now in other words they are clogging they are detaching cutting this pipe here for their heart verse 27 of these people is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have their clothes lest they should see with their eyes remember jesus spoke about it and heal with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and that should heal them exactly what jesus spoke watch verse 28 why paul why did paul speak like jesus amen the bible say brother branham say paul the angel of the church of ephesus paul funding this church being the messenger to it remember paul funding the church at ephesus became the messenger of that church and the spirit was in the land that time was ah and the lion is the lion of the tribe of judah which is who and christ is the paul with the word of that age did you get it in the first age was a lion age remember the four caribbeans that was the lion of the tribe of judah christ his own influence of life taking water so the influence of the ministry of jesus christ went on top of paul because jesus is trying to get the jews so when the jews rejected he repeat the same thing jesus spoke by closing the door watch verse 28 be known therefore to you that the salvation of who is sent to the and that they will do what what authority have paul to close a door to a to a to a nation that's why after that you go to roman nine paul says i could wish that myself were a curse from christ for my now paul begin to sorrow he said i have sorrow continually for israel because paul understood that they are done now tattoos is coming to kill them all right but here he said i wish that myself were a curse the pastor of the age he's still longing they left the church but his heart is still sorrowful a pastor's amen where a curse from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh paul says i'm still sorrowful for them why are you sorrowful like that paul look what paul was looking at that the jews missed who are israelites to whom pretend the water benefit of melchizedek and the water benefit of melchizedek and the water benefit of melchizedek and the water the hope toward melchizedek and the water become servant of god and water who's out there of whom us concerning the flesh who in other words my brethren miss this whole package everybody here who is christ who is overall what deity bless for amen not as though the word of god has taken non-effect it doesn't mean that god failed for they are not all water which are off now you understand not everybody is the seed of abraham neither because they are the seed of abraham by birth are they all what but in isaac you remember that sid who was who because that is there which are the children of the flesh the jews these are not the children of god but the children of the water the promise of christ are content for the water one seed because we are all in christ everybody that's why paul changes now the gear watch paul for this course i paul the prisoner of water for you the jews [Applause] now me paul i became prisoner today they block these pipes i'm only locked to one hey mark here oh prisoner of jesus christ for you who if ye have heard of the dispersation of the what so paul will receive an outpouring of grace that's why he was trying to open the jewish door to bring grace to the jews they could not understand the jews clogged the pipe so paul turn and say i don't have anything there is only one highway remaining i'm going to channel the whole grace toward the gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given to that's who that's right because originally god told him go to the gentleman here how that by revelation he made known unto me the water as i wrote a four in you and few words before whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of what everybody which in other ages was not water unto the son of man as it is now unto his holy approacher and water by the water what is the mystery paul that there should be water and of the same and water of water in christ [Music] so when you're reading my writing you can discern the revelation i'm bringing and that revelation was not given before but now it's open so you understand the unsearchable riches of christ that you to whom i'm writing to whom god is unfolding all these revelations now you might understand that these things were not given before these things were hidden brother kelly until the split happened so you will understand you this group that the gender should be fellow hair it is the time i am bringing you into what i intended for you to be all this time look how i'm unfolding the word [Music] let's stand up [Applause] [Music] we are not bringing any ministry above another no this platform is built for christ which is the message of the [Music] you lord hour you lord thank you everybody here blessed be the name of the lord we have five point we stop this is the end of the second point i can start the third let's pray heavenly father lord once again we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father every single day we can see the display of your mercy and now we can understand how grace operates father sometimes we don't understand the meaning of all these unfolding which is not an unfolding of a man it is nothing but it's the unfolding of the holy spirit and it doesn't happen only here lord father because we took a trip and we can see people of like precious faith where we can share the same thing and we understand that it is time for the bride to get into her position and to be prepared because sooner that same power that came with this message because your prophet said that three things happen the shout the voice of the archangel which is the voice of resurrection father it's also in this message and the trumpet of god which will summon us our father to meet you in the air lord it's a whole package put together lord may nobody miss it lord father you spoke here and there about our life about the sweetness father and you unfolded unto us the very mind the back part mind of you that was lord father close how you hide this supreme intelligence father through the scripture only to come and redeem wretched people unworthy like us that now can be called the children of god and the son of god of the race and the lineage of melchizedek father there is no other expression that we can say tonight but to thank you lord many thing has been spoken but may the holy spirit continue to lord father unfold and reveal this word more and more because father you gave us the promise lord that's lord it will be a well of babbling water coming out of us lord father bless this church and touch those that are sick lord father remember your children lord father for the sacrifice they're making coming here to your house not to hear a man but to hear the lord father lord jesus christ may you continue and also bless them in their life in a supernatural way like they have never experienced you before that they can say now my christian life is different lord father because when you send your word you send your word to heal your children father may that healing be taking place in their body their soul and the spirit lord and may you give them travel mercies as they're going home we commit
