[8:10] Thank you Lord for this blessed
[8:11] assurance. Lord, we thank you, Father,
[8:14] for allowing us to walk in this morning,
[8:17] Lord, and feel your presence here
[8:18] already. Lord, even coming by yesterday,
[8:22] working, Lord, a little bit, we we could
[8:25] feel your presence here, Lord. We know
[8:27] that whirlwind came in, Lord, it never
[8:30] went back out.
[8:31] So, we give you the glory, Lord, this
[8:33] morning and the honor. And what an honor
[8:36] it is for us, Lord, just to be in your
[8:38] presence once again, Lord. You're our
[8:40] savior, Lord, and our King. You're our
[8:42] brother and our friend as well, Lord.
[8:44] And we just want to lift you up this
[8:46] morning, Lord God. And just give all
[8:48] preeminence to you this morning, Lord.
[8:51] We thank you, Father, once again, Lord,
[8:53] for everything that you do for us, Lord,
[8:56] in our lives, Lord God, and in here,
[8:59] Lord, in this little building.
[9:02] Thank you, Lord. We're excited to be
[9:04] here, Lord. We're excited to sing a
[9:06] little bit for you this morning, Lord
[9:07] God. And most of all, Lord, we're
[9:10] excited to hear what you've got for us.
[9:12] It's this word, Lord God. It's just,
[9:15] Lord, it's just coming forth, Lord God.
[9:18] And it's just so wonderful, Lord. We
[9:21] feel very, very special, Lord, to have
[9:23] this privilege, Lord, to sit here under
[9:26] you, Lord, and to hear these things,
[9:28] Lord, and just to quicken our souls,
[9:32] Lord. So, we ask for mercy one more
[9:35] time, Lord. have mercy on the time as
[9:37] well, Lord. I tried to get the phone
[9:39] from the pastor and his watch, but he
[9:41] wouldn't let me have it. So, we just
[9:43] want him to have his will, Lord, so that
[9:45] you might have yours when you speak to
[9:47] us, Lord God. Use those lips of clay
[9:50] this morning, Lord God, and and bless us
[9:52] with your presence in your word, Lord.
[9:54] Vindicate the word, Lord, this morning,
[9:57] Lord God. We're we need the supernatural
[10:00] among us, Lord, visible, Lord. So, we're
[10:02] asking these things, Lord, in your
[10:04] precious name that you just manifest
[10:05] yourself like that to us, Lord.
[10:09] We thank you, Father. We know we're in
[10:10] the spoken word age as well, Lord God.
[10:14] Bless our musicians this morning, Lord.
[10:16] We speak Jesus over them this morning,
[10:18] Lord. Bless our singers, Lord. We speak
[10:20] Jesus over them, Lord, and the
[10:22] technicians as well, Lord. We speak
[10:25] Jesus over this congregation as well,
[10:27] Lord God, this morning, Lord.
[10:30] We know that we just got a special group
[10:34] here, Lord God. We've been through a lot
[10:37] together, Lord God, and it's
[10:38] strengthened our bind as far as our
[10:41] fellowship, Lord, and our love for one
[10:42] another, Lord. But without you, it's all
[10:45] just vanity, Lord God. So, we want you
[10:48] to come down, Lord, and just strengthen
[10:51] it even more, Lord God.
[10:53] Lord, if there's anybody here that
[10:55] doesn't feel like they're well enough to
[10:57] sing, Lord, change that, Lord, and just
[10:59] take it away from them, that they can
[11:01] lift their voices with us, Lord, and
[11:03] just sing this morning, Lord God. We
[11:06] thank you, Father. We give every portion
[11:07] of the service back to you, Lord. Give

[51:54] pastor from overseas in uh in the
[51:58] Republic of Congo, not the Democratic.
[52:00] He been following the sermon. He said,
[52:02] "God bless you for all the teaching and
[52:06] he's asking all the notes.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; I don't even remember. I have to search
[52:12] all the notes. I usually write them by
[52:13] hand." But it's a pastor way. So in
[52:16] other words, somebody's listening to the
[52:18] message far far far away. So welcome to
[52:22] spoken great. God richly bless you and
[52:25] welcome to the channel where the message
[52:27] of William Marion Brham is yummy. Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; So we believe you are all up to date
[52:32] with the sermon you read in your Bible
[52:34] twice a day, your cood church ages, 70
[52:38] weeks of Daniel, the seals adoption or
[52:40] somebody is listening to the message of
[52:43] the hour. Amen. Lord's willing, this

[53:07] Lord and be happy and everything. So,
[53:10] everybody is invited. Brother Roberto
[53:12] and Sister Josianne, you are also
[53:15] invited and welcome there. Amen. Be
[53:18] there on time. So, it's this coming
[53:20] Saturday. You heard the uh the time by
[53:23] brother Robert. And Lord's willing,
[53:26] October the 11th. If you can put that
[53:28] down so you don't forget. October the 11
[53:32] is our question and answer session.
[53:34] Sometime people ask me the same
[53:35] question. I say every Sunday I repeat
[53:38] this over and over so you can't miss it.
[53:40] October the 11th, it's our question and
[53:42] answer. Then October the 25th is the
[53:46] Youngs Men meeting part three. And
[53:48] Lord's willing on September the 20th,
[53:51] that's the married couple meeting which
[53:53] is part seven which will and December
[53:56] the 13th will be part eight and
[53:58] September the 27 which is will be the
[54:02] young sister meeting. I believe I got
[54:04] everything covered by God's grace. I saw
[54:08] some question uh that were sent online
[54:10] on the YouTube platform. So I'm asking
[54:13] the invisible audience. It's hard for me
[54:16] to go through all the platform YouTube
[54:20] and uh Instagram or Facebook and get all
[54:24] your question. That would be a lot of
[54:26] work for me. So we got a website for the
[54:30] church and there is an email. I usually
[54:33] check my email four times a week. In
[54:36] other word on Monday I check it on
[54:38] Tuesday on Thursday and on uh on
[54:40] Wednesdays and Thursday every time I'm
[54:42] at work I'm checking my email. So if
[54:44] there is any question please take your
[54:46] question send it to the email it will be
[54:49] better for me but it's going to be hard
[54:51] for me if you put something on YouTube
[54:53] for me to go again and begin to search
[54:55] on YouTube and search on Instagram and
[54:57] search on Facebook that's a lot of work
[54:59] for me. So my invisible audience brother
[55:02] use the email. I usually check them
[55:04] weekly and then we can respond
[55:06] accordingly by the grace of God. And if
[55:08] you send me a text internationally or
[55:12] nationally, I have not responded. Please
[55:14] be patient with me. If you look at the
[55:17] number of texts and email and phone call
[55:20] I'm getting, that's a lot. So I'm doing
[55:22] the best that I can by God's grace.
[55:24] Amen. The building project, everything
[55:26] is going well by God's grace. Uh things
[55:29] are moving forward. Brother Michael has
[55:33] been helping a lot. Brother Zach was
[55:35] there yesterday with brother John
[55:37] Porter. Brother Robert I can't even
[55:39] mention. So everything you're doing
[55:41] maybe you might not be here to do the
[55:44] work but your contribution is doing the
[55:46] work and helping us pay the bills. So we
[55:48] still cleaning up the old bills and on
[55:51] the same time we are preparing the money
[55:53] the best that we can to see when we can
[55:56] start the foundation over there. Amen.
[55:59] And you know I I told brother Robert I
[56:02] say this building is a divine building.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Usually God gave the plan to one
[56:10] man.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And he he he can't avoid a lot of
[56:17] headache.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; God gave the plan to build the
[56:24] tabernacle to Moses alone.
[56:29] You want me to start preaching on that
[56:31] one?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; So, you say amen and we move.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Ah. And then God anointed people
[56:39] &gt;&gt; that will support the vision
[56:42] &gt;&gt; that God gave Moses.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Not to change the vision.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Your anointing will support the vision.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Let me push the break there when I'm
[56:55] just going to give a testimony. Can I
[56:56] give a testimony?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So my time have not started yet.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; So when we were building over there, we
[57:03] put a line for a refrigerator there.
[57:07] And there was a a water line that the
[57:10] the plumber put there so that whenever
[57:13] we buy a refrigerator, they will buy a
[57:15] refrigerator that can make ice and
[57:18] things like that. So So the pipe was
[57:20] already there. So for some reason they
[57:22] close and they bury everything and
[57:24] brother Robert said there is not a
[57:25] problem. There is a way you can locate
[57:27] the pipe and and just borrow a hole and
[57:29] then pull it out. There's no problem. So
[57:32] we were looking for a refrigerator. We
[57:33] look for a refrigerator discussion left
[57:36] and right. So we end up with our humble
[57:39] refrigerator
[57:45] &gt;&gt; and the humble uh
[57:49] I have not even stopped preaching. You
[57:50] begin to act like So we got our humble
[57:53] refrigerator. I know I'm online and I
[57:55] have to say it that way. We got our
[57:57] humble refrigerator which is uh about it
[58:00] was $300 refrigerator
[58:02] &gt;&gt; and it was a very small one, a very
[58:04] humble one. So we got the refrigerator
[58:07] and we put it in. But the problem is
[58:09] that refrigerator doesn't make ice. It's
[58:12] only to cool everything. So we say, you
[58:15] know what? Let's forget it. We can use
[58:17] our bottle, our water bottle. Let's
[58:19] remain humble like message believer and
[58:22] then uh and then uh let's get our
[58:25] refrigerator. So the refrigerator came
[58:27] delivered left there in the box without
[58:30] any problem. So on uh
[58:34] Friday, I believe I was going to buy the
[58:37] blinds for the windows over there. So I
[58:41] got into Home Depot and as I was going
[58:44] to get the blind, the refrigerator and
[58:46] the blind are side by side.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; So I didn't put it there.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Can I stop or we can continue?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Can I stop or we can continue? So I went
[58:58] there and as I was passing I saw a
[59:01] yellow signal.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; I look a beautiful refrigerator,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; a huge one.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And a tall one.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Can I stop?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And uh
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at your faces. And the price
[59:22] of the refrigerator
[59:24] is $4,500.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:29] Brother Steven, you playing with church
[59:31] money.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; When I look, there was a sign
[59:36] &gt;&gt; and they crossed the price.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; The price.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And they dropped the price to $1,75.
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:46] &gt;&gt; A huge refrigerator with four doors
[59:49] &gt;&gt; with ice.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; A kitchen egg. Sister Lorela,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; I never even seen the brand before.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; I look I say, my God.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And there were other refrigerator, but
[1:00:07] none of them have a discount like that
[1:00:09] one.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; I say, am I dreaming or what?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; This brand is a very expensive brand.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Everything else, they give a discount of
[1:00:19] $1,000, $1,200. But this one for some
[1:00:22] reason they drop it there.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I took pictures.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Everybody I say something wrong.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I send it to brother Robert.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert look said, "Wow, this is
[1:00:35] nice." I said, "Bro, can you imagine one
[1:00:38] person will go to the store and buy a
[1:00:41] refrigerator for $4,000
[1:00:43] and somebody else will come and buy the
[1:00:46] same thing
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; for $1,075.
[1:00:52] But Robert said, "But Stephen, this is
[1:00:53] the way they do it." I say, "Okay, let
[1:00:55] me send it to Sister Sharon."
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; So I send the picture to Sister Sharon.
[1:01:01] Sister Sharon say, "Wow, this is God
[1:01:03] doing the thing."
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; I look at the sign, they say, "We don't
[1:01:07] deliver. You need to pick it up
[1:01:09] yourself.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; There's no delivery, nothing." I say,
[1:01:12] "So how can I carry the you can uh you
[1:01:15] can rent a truck and get it yourself?"
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh my god." say, "You know
[1:01:20] what? Let me just go home."
[1:01:23] So, I went home.
[1:01:25] Then on Saturday, yesterday, I woke up.
[1:01:27] I said, "Mm."
[1:01:31] I went, I say, "Sister Sharon, what do
[1:01:34] you think about that refrigerator?"
[1:01:37] She said, "This is God."
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; I say, "Okay, approval check."
[1:01:42] I look at her, she was not feeling good.
[1:01:44] I say, "No problem. I leave. I go
[1:01:46] myself."
[1:01:47] So I got into the car and I went to Home
[1:01:50] Depot. I went there and I saw it but it
[1:01:52] looks like a refrigerator. I don't see
[1:01:53] any freezing or anything. Say ah there
[1:01:56] is no freezing. I called the guy. I said
[1:01:59] please can I can I talk to somebody
[1:02:01] here? I need to to learn some
[1:02:02] information here. So they call somebody
[1:02:04] they look that man say wow this is a
[1:02:07] good refrigerator. I need to know myself
[1:02:09] about it. He's an employee working
[1:02:11] there. He said we need to call the guy
[1:02:13] who specialize in refrigerator. So they
[1:02:16] called the guy. The guy came there. He
[1:02:18] looked, he said, "No, no, this is a
[1:02:19] refrigerator when you can uh you can uh
[1:02:23] adjust the temperature. You can make it
[1:02:25] a deep freezer or a regular freezer."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; When we open, they say, "Wow." He said,
[1:02:31] "Man,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; if I needed a refrigerator, I will get
[1:02:34] this myself."
[1:02:37] I said, "No, I'm trying to get this for
[1:02:39] the church." I said, "But you know what?
[1:02:41] Uh, how can we pick up this refrigerator
[1:02:44] to the church?" They said, "No, no, no.
[1:02:45] There is no pickup. You need to rent a
[1:02:47] truck there." I said, "Rent a truck."
[1:02:50] Say, "But Stephen, $300 and uh $1,000
[1:02:54] minus 300 humble refrigerator." So, I'm
[1:02:58] looking at maybe $75 to put for a big
[1:03:01] refrigerator so we can uh put some ice
[1:03:04] and everything. If you don't feel good
[1:03:06] in church, you will find some drink. So,
[1:03:08] I sat down. I looked.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Sorry. And I was there. I said, "Where
[1:03:13] is the car?" But they say you go over
[1:03:15] there at the corner at the customer
[1:03:16] service you can rent a truck. I went to
[1:03:19] the customer service. I saw two lady. I
[1:03:22] say I want to get a refrigerator over
[1:03:24] there. But can I get a truck? They say
[1:03:27] there is no truck. All truck are already
[1:03:30] booked. They are reserved. There is
[1:03:32] nothing. You have to wait. I say how
[1:03:34] long should I wait? They say you have to
[1:03:36] wait. You can leave it seven days. I say
[1:03:38] I work during the week. There is no way
[1:03:40] I can do this. I don't want to call
[1:03:41] brother John Paul there. I'm gonna make
[1:03:43] him move from there and come all the way
[1:03:45] here. I know he will do it. If I call
[1:03:46] brother Glenn, he will pick up his truck
[1:03:48] and come. I don't want to bother the
[1:03:50] brother. I said, what can I do? I said,
[1:03:53] but she said there is nothing.
[1:03:55] Everything is already booked. Nothing.
[1:03:57] Be while we were talking an employee
[1:03:59] came and dropped a key right there in
[1:04:01] front of both of us.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Now you know your pastor, you need to
[1:04:08] seize the opportunity.
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:15] I I look at the lady, I say, "The truck
[1:04:17] is right there." She said, "No, this one
[1:04:20] is reserved." I stood there watching her
[1:04:23] and she dropped and after a while, she
[1:04:26] raised up. She said, "Can you bring the
[1:04:29] truck before the evening?"
[1:04:32] I say, "I just need couple hours." She
[1:04:34] said, "Go pay for the truck. Go pay for
[1:04:36] the refrigerator."
[1:04:38] I run quickly, went there. I saw the
[1:04:41] man. I say, "Sir, I want to pay for the
[1:04:43] refrigerator right now because I don't
[1:04:46] want anything to change there at the
[1:04:47] company."
[1:04:49] I say, "I want to pay for it right now."
[1:04:51] He say, "Okay." He took the the the
[1:04:55] labor price and put the refrigerator on
[1:04:57] the computer. When he put the
[1:04:59] refrigerator on the computer, the price
[1:05:02] drop.
[1:05:10] Can I continue? Now the refrigerator is
[1:05:13] $975.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; The man stopped. He said, "I don't know.
[1:05:21] The price just dropped."
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He looked and he didn't know I was a
[1:05:25] minister. He say
[1:05:28] God sent you here for a mission
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; to come and get this refrigerator. This
[1:05:35] is the way God does things for his
[1:05:36] children.
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; A man that heading
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; is telling me that
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; that's it. I look at him and I begin to
[1:05:52] search for my business card to give him
[1:05:54] business card for new uh patient. I look
[1:05:58] there is no business card. I look
[1:06:00] there's spoken word card. I say I got
[1:06:02] two businesses. I say I got my business
[1:06:04] and the father's business.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Do you need a scripture for that?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Because I got to seize opportunity for
[1:06:15] souls too.
[1:06:19] That's it.
[1:06:21] Yes, sir.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I pulled two card. I gave it to him. The
[1:06:28] man looked, he did everything. The price
[1:06:30] drop. He said, "It's just going to be a
[1:06:31] little taxes." I said, "Don't worry. I
[1:06:33] will fight with the taxes because it's a
[1:06:35] church. We got a tax exemption form. We
[1:06:38] will get the money back. No problem.
[1:06:39] Just go ahead." I went straight to the
[1:06:41] lady and she was surprised. I came
[1:06:43] quickly. She say, "You already paid for
[1:06:45] it." I say, "I was following your
[1:06:46] direction.
[1:06:49] They look they say the truck is right
[1:06:51] there. They're going to upload
[1:06:53] everything and you take it yourself.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; I said no problem. Your pastor was in
[1:06:57] the truck.
[1:06:59] Brother Michael, you never told me how
[1:07:01] nice a truck was inside.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I left everything there, got in
[1:07:08] the truck, they loaded. I called brother
[1:07:09] Robert. I said, "Brother Robert," I got
[1:07:11] a testimony. Guess what I told him?
[1:07:13] Brother Robert was excited. said, I
[1:07:14] said, "But Robert, I'm driving a truck
[1:07:19] on Saturday morning. You should see me
[1:07:21] truck say 20." I said, "How much is a
[1:07:23] truck?" "$29." So you see a truck moving
[1:07:26] $29. Your pastor was inside.
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I call brother Michael. I said, "Brother
[1:07:36] Michael, where are you at?" He say, "I'm
[1:07:37] heading to church." I said, "I have a
[1:07:38] big delivery to put there." I said,
[1:07:40] "Brother John Porter, Brother John
[1:07:42] Porter is there with brother Zach." I
[1:07:43] said, "That's it. Let's go. I got in the
[1:07:45] truck. I said, "Sister Sharon, you
[1:07:47] missed this. You could have been here
[1:07:49] enjoying." When I was looking, I took a
[1:07:52] selfie,
[1:07:54] not for WhatsApp.
[1:07:58] I say, "I'm going to take a selfie to
[1:08:00] show sister Sharon. I was driving a
[1:08:02] truck."
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; So they say, "If you take too long, it
[1:08:07] will cost more." I say, "No, Lord. I got
[1:08:09] on the 85, no traffic, my friend.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Green, green. Now keep moving.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Got here in the church with brother
[1:08:16] Michael, brother John Porter, brother
[1:08:17] Zach. We put it. It's over there.

[1:08:22] humble refrigerator.
[1:08:24] [Laughter]
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? I took the
[1:08:28] humble refrigerator. I put it back on
[1:08:31] the truck and I was going. Brother Glenn
[1:08:33] came after. He said, "Brother Steven,
[1:08:35] you got a new title." Because I was
[1:08:37] driving a truck. Now I'm delivering
[1:08:39] stuff.

[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I took the truck. I took the
[1:08:47] refrigerator back. I gave it to them.
[1:08:49] They reimbured the money. I dropped
[1:08:51] everything. And before I went there, I
[1:08:53] stopped at my office. Pick up some
[1:08:54] business card.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And I went back and I followed the man
[1:09:00] and I gave them a card. He looked at me.
[1:09:02] He said, "You a man of your word."
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank you very much, brother."
[1:09:08] Left, got in the car and moved forward.
[1:09:11] So if you go back there

[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So, what we want to put here first is

[1:17:34] didn't give him communion, but he
[1:17:36] blessed him."

[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Now he says and Mechisedc blessed him.
[1:18:08] You can refocus
[1:18:10] and say blessed be Abraham of the most
[1:18:13] high God possessor of heaven and earth.
[1:18:17] God met Abraham as a possessor of heaven
[1:18:21] and earth. When God meet you under a
[1:18:24] name,
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It means that you are lacking what that
[1:18:28] name is actually bringing.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; We already understand that.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham say Abraham was
[1:18:35] poor.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; No wonder I was trying to skip this, but
[1:18:41] let's go ahead.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say in the message,
[1:18:45] what?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Possessing off.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Possessing off. Look at the title of the
[1:18:49] message.
[1:18:50] possessing what?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; He said, now in Genesis, we read of
[1:18:55] Abraham meeting this great man called
[1:18:58] Mechisedc
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; who was possessor of what?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Both heaven and earth.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And then he was possessor of what?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. That is
[1:19:09] of water.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; So possessor of heaven and earth means
[1:19:14] he possess all things. We understand
[1:19:16] this. Then brother Brham described to us
[1:19:19] in the same message the state of Abraham
[1:19:22] when Mechisedc met him. Brother Brham
[1:19:25] say that now down here because you
[1:19:28] remember this we understand that Abraham
[1:19:32] was the poorest man in all the country.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; He was not the poor man.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; He was the poorest. In other words, if
[1:19:42] you search the whole country, Abraham
[1:19:45] was at the bottom.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; He was the poorest man of all the
[1:19:51] country. In all the country because he
[1:19:53] live out where?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; In the desert.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; And he live in peace with God.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Even though he was poor, but he was he
[1:20:02] had peace with God.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; God was already Jehovah shalom for him.
[1:20:09] Yes, sir. He was lacking things but he
[1:20:12] was in peace.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; So peace doesn't depend on material.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Peace is a person.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah shalom.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; You might be lacking things. You might
[1:20:28] not have the money to pay the bills, but
[1:20:30] you can be at peace.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You are at peace because the peaceful
[1:20:34] God is there
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; and everything is under control. Yes.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm continuing that same
[1:20:45] message. He say Abraham could lay hold
[1:20:48] on to
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; yet how poor
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; his cattle was starving.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Lord took the best ground. His water was
[1:20:56] water
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; short.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; How many what kind of days?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hot days.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And the herdsman has been watered
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; in trouble.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And everything looked like gone wrong
[1:21:05] for Abraham.
[1:21:07] Yet he own what?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The whole thing.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, what is going on in your
[1:21:12] life right now doesn't tell what you
[1:21:15] going to be.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Your situation right now is not your
[1:21:21] destiny.
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:26] So Gabbraham when he met God under the
[1:21:30] name of Elle Leon
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; under the name of Melkisedc we found out
[1:21:35] that the first description is Abraham
[1:21:38] was the poorest
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; that's why God met him as Elle Leon
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; as the one who possessed everything
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; and God took that anointing
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; of possessing everything
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; and begin to put that anointing on
[1:21:52] Abraham
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; are Are we together?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. Praise God. Verse
[1:22:00] uh
[1:22:01] uh 19. He said, "And he blessed him and
[1:22:05] say, blessed be Abraham of the most high
[1:22:08] God, possessor of heaven and earth,
[1:22:11] possessor of all things, and blessed be
[1:22:14] the most high God which has done what?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Delivered thine enemies
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; into your hand." So we understand the
[1:22:20] one who fought the battle is God through
[1:22:22] Abraham. who deliver your enemy into
[1:22:25] your hand. And he gave him the ts of
[1:22:27] water.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Preach on that one." And
[1:22:30] the king of Sodom said to Abraham, after
[1:22:34] Mechisedc gave him the communion. And
[1:22:37] after Mechisedc already bless him, he
[1:22:40] told Abraham, he said, "Give me the
[1:22:43] person." Brother Brandham say he was
[1:22:44] asking for his subject. In other words,
[1:22:47] he want to rebuild his kingdom back up
[1:22:49] again. He said, "Give me the person and
[1:22:52] take the goods to yourself." In other
[1:22:54] words, take the salary.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; And Abraham said to the king of Sodom,
[1:22:58] "I have done what?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Lift up mine hand unto the Lord."
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And the mo which what type of Lord?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; The most high God.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham now is vowing.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He's telling the king of Sodom that I'm
[1:23:11] already committed.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; I'm already hooked.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; You came too late. Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; I am committed to the most high God, the
[1:23:23] possessor of heaven and earth, that I
[1:23:26] would not take what
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; from a thread.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Even what?
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; To a shoe latch.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And that I would not take anything that
[1:23:33] is yours, lest you should say that I
[1:23:36] have made Abraham how?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Rich.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; So we find that even though Abraham was
[1:23:42] poor
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; when the opportunity was given to him,
[1:23:47] Abraham rejected the opportunity from
[1:23:50] Sodom
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; waiting on the opportunity that was
[1:23:55] already given to him by the blessing of
[1:23:59] Elon.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brham was able to
[1:24:02] return a 1 million check.
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me. They brought a
[1:24:12] million dollar check to brother Brham.
[1:24:14] And they brought you brother Brandham
[1:24:16] because he did the service.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Just like Abraham did the service.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; When they brought the million dollar,
[1:24:22] brother Brandham return the check back.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have to depend on God.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; But the condition of Abraham were not
[1:24:38] good.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; He was struggling.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hard days,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; trouble everywhere. Yes.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Seems like everything is not working.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Yet he's possessing everything.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And Paul, we saw last Sunday that Paul
[1:24:53] says in 2 Corinthians 6:10, he says as
[1:24:57] what?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Sorrowful
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; yet always what?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; The sorrow is external.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to leave the airport. Amen.
[1:25:11] There is an external environment
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and there is an internal environment
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; on the outside. It's sorrowful
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; but it's not sorrowful on the inside.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; On the outside things are not working
[1:25:27] but Abraham was at peace with God.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; The outside was sorrowful but Paul is
[1:25:34] saying always doing what?
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing. So this joy doesn't depend on
[1:25:40] the wedding.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; It is a joy that doesn't repend depend
[1:25:51] on what is going on outside.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; It is a joy that is coming from within.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Whether things are good or bad, it
[1:26:01] doesn't matter.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:05] Keep in mind it's a joy that is coming
[1:26:09] from with inside
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; because if he was depending on the
[1:26:15] outside then whenever the outside goes
[1:26:17] up you rejoice. When it goes down
[1:26:21] your face change in church.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see you in church happy. Next
[1:26:26] Sunday we see you. You sorrowful.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; You have an outside joy. The inside joy
[1:26:32] is a joy where no one can tell when you
[1:26:34] going through trouble.
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even your enemy is trouble because
[1:26:42] your enemy wants you to be sorrowful but
[1:26:45] he cannot see sorrow in your life.
[1:26:48] The devil want you sad.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; But if you you are rejoicing, you are
[1:26:54] actually troubling the devil
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; because despite everything that the
[1:26:59] devil is doing, you still moving on.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That is something that you don't
[1:27:04] manufacture,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; it is something that is coming from
[1:27:08] within.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Paul says that yet always doing what?
[1:27:17] rejoicing
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; as how
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; poor
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; yet making what?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Many rich.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Paul is saying that if you look at him
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; like Abraham, Paul is poor
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; yet
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; he makes other how
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; rich.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; The ability to be poor
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; on the outside.
[1:27:44] the ability to be poor on the outside
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; and make other people rich.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Means that wealth is on the inside.
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Can you put your seat belt
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; now? You slowing me down.
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:14] Are we together?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible described Jesus Christ in
[1:28:18] Isaiah 53.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; If you look at him, nothing, no beauty
[1:28:22] to behold.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; But inside that man was healing.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Inside that man was bread.
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Not bread, but cooked bread.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Inside that man were fishes.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Not fishes, but cook. season fry fish.
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; If you look at Jesus, Jesus didn't have
[1:28:49] fish.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have fish. The one who had
[1:28:58] fish was a little boy.
[1:29:03] But Jesus could take the fish and make
[1:29:06] the Ludo rich
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; until they were overflow.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So where was the fish Jesus was
[1:29:18] creating? Where were dead?
[1:29:21] In other words, the ability
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; to be poor,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; to be lacking,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; yet you are making somebody rich.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's an ability that that belongs to
[1:29:34] God.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:42] Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know you trying to
[1:29:44] struggle with it. I'm going to make it
[1:29:46] as plan because your pastor is direct.
[1:29:49] Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; The ability
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; to be poor
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and make somebody else rich,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; it's a divine attribute.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; It is a characteristic of God.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Only God is poor and make somebody rich.
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying here, not God.
[1:30:19] Paul
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; is the one who is poor
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; making other people what?
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Rich.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I know you struggling.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Let's let's nail this thing
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; as what?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Poor
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; yet making many what
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; rich.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Not making one person
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; making what?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Many.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't look at your
[1:30:45] present state. Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Don't wait to be rich to bless somebody.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Don't wait to be healed
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; before you can pray for somebody. Even
[1:31:07] if you heal, you can still pray for
[1:31:10] others and God will heal others.
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:19] Are we together?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; You don't understand. Let's Let's look
[1:31:26] at this a little bit. Amen. We usually
[1:31:28] say, "I'm myself sick. How can I pray
[1:31:31] for somebody? You don't understand who
[1:31:33] you are. Wow.
[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; That's why the Pharisee told Jesus
[1:31:42] Christ, "If you are the cross at the
[1:31:44] cross,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; do what?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Come down."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus come down?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus was at the cross, but he's giving
[1:31:50] eternal life to the thief.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And him and the thief are on the same
[1:31:55] condition.
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Jesus crucified
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; the fifth crucified
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; but Jesus being crucified doesn't bother
[1:32:10] him
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; as being crucified he can still give
[1:32:14] life
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; his condition Jesus didn't say you see
[1:32:20] how I'm suffering at the cross I cannot
[1:32:23] save anyone now
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; no Jesus his name means yeshua
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; he was a savior
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; he cannot help but save
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:38] He want salvation.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Even though he's going through the same
[1:32:45] condition,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; but he's going he turn around. He say
[1:32:48] you
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; in paradise with me today.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Lord help me
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; as being what?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Poor
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; yet what
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; making many rich.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; So let me help you. to you who are
[1:33:02] struggling. Paul says in 2 Corinthian
[1:33:05] what?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Eight
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Nine.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; For ye know, ye know what?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; that though he was
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; rich.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus, not you.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Though he was how?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Rich,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; yet for your sake he became what?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Poor.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That ye through his poverty might be
[1:33:28] what?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Rich.
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:35] Now fight with this.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; The ability to become poor
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; and making other rich is an ability of
[1:33:43] God.

[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Rich.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying now it's no longer
[1:33:52] Jesus Christ.

[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Being poor,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; making other
[1:34:06] sess
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; there are people whose company have been
[1:34:18] blessed because of you working there.
[1:34:23] I know you won't believe that
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; because you living paycheck by paycheck.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; But the employee know
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; that since this boy came
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Joseph was poor.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Joseph was a slave but his presence was
[1:34:43] making body far rich.
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:48] I don't know if you understanding me.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Braham said he was the son
[1:34:54] of prosperity.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't look at yourself.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Look inside yourself.
[1:35:03] [Applause]
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Joseph is coming. A slave. They bringing
[1:35:16] a slave. They're bringing a slave. Did
[1:35:18] you see any wealth with him?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; But when they put him in the house, they
[1:35:22] give him responsibility. The blessing of
[1:35:25] Joseph
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; begin to affect Pifer.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Poor making podify rich.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; It is an ability of people who are God.

[1:35:42] Yes, sir.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus himself was rich.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you here. Whatever
[1:35:55] mechisedc is
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; this is what you are.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc.
[1:36:07] Mechisedc is priest
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible say ye are what?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; So what is the difference between you
[1:36:16] and mecisedc
[1:36:20] is possessor of all things?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; You must be what?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul is saying and yet doing
[1:36:28] what?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Possessing all things.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; In other word you are divine.
[1:36:34] She say divine never take your name for
[1:36:37] joke.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; No sir,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; you are divine.
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; The husband that marry you marry a
[1:36:43] divine wife.
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:03] H
[1:37:05] what I'm trying to show you is clear and
[1:37:07] simple.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Paul is saying joyful. He say as poor
[1:37:13] and yet making other water rich.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; In other word this quality, this
[1:37:17] characteristic is a characteristic of
[1:37:20] sons of God.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And sons of God are God.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; It is only God that can do this.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:32] Amen.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; If you have the ability to make somebody
[1:37:36] wealthy,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; rich, where is the wealth?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; We are we are studying our sermon
[1:37:42] slowly. Where is the health?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. My friend Paul says as
[1:37:51] having what?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And yet possessing what?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:37:57] In other words, when you look at that
[1:37:59] person at Abraham, Abraham look like
[1:38:02] having nothing.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; But be careful.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Abraham possess what?
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So being poor on the outside doesn't
[1:38:17] mean you poor inside.
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:24] Glory to God.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; The anointing of God changed the
[1:38:29] wilderness
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; into a place where grass can grow.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus will do in the
[1:38:36] millennium.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Because every every wilderness must be
[1:38:44] changed.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the one entering there is
[1:38:47] life.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] Let's let's continue, my friend. Slowly
[1:38:56] look at this. When I say having nothing
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; and yet possessing all things,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; listen to what God does.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Paul says in 2 Corinthian, Paul says in
[1:39:07] first uh Peter say in 2 Peter 1:3, he
[1:39:10] say according as what?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; His divine power,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; which power?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Divine power has given unto us what?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; All things. Some things. All things.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; So what give you all things?
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Divine power.

[1:39:35] you?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; In either word, all you need in this
[1:39:43] life is God.
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:50] Yes sir.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; If you got God, you got everything.
[1:39:57] [Applause]

[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; All things
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; that pertain unto what?
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Life.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; So everything that pertain to your life
[1:40:34] is where?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; You see this is the Bible. You can't
[1:40:43] fight me. Divine
[1:40:46] power is giving us all things.

[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; all things that pertain to water
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; life.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; So if I need something for my life,
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I need to go to the divine power.
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:12] It's your season to be blessed.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Can we continue?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Can we continue?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; According to his divine power that give
[1:41:25] us what?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; You think I'm giving you testimony 450
[1:41:31] for 4,500 to this one? Do I do I qualify
[1:41:35] for such a refrigerator?
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; But his divine power,
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; send me to Home Depot.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And a man with a earring is recognizing
[1:41:50] God,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; not knowing that I am God.
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:05] I don't know what's wrong with you.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's wrong with you.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Unbeliever are seeing God.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You are looking like it's just
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it just happened. It's just a
[1:42:25] refrigerator
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; to you. It's a refrigerator
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; to meet Jehovah Jara.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen, my friend. Listen, my
[1:42:40] friend.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, my friend. Before the
[1:42:42] refrigerator was bought,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; the pipe was already there.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; The pipe called for the refrigerator.
[1:42:52] When the first refrigerator came, the
[1:42:55] pipe say, "Not this one. I need
[1:42:57] something that I can collect."
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:06] The deep is calling to the deep
[1:43:11] and there must be a deep to respond.
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:20] Yes.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Everything that belong to life is where
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; divine power. Everything that belong to
[1:43:31] life and water
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; godliness
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and water.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; God uh godliness
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; godliness.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know what godliness mean?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Brother say godliness means what?
[1:43:49] to be like who?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; So the ability to be like God is way.
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to force to be God.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; It's already in you.
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; So his divine power give us what?
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul is saying as long as
[1:44:26] that divine power is there.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Even though you look like you don't have
[1:44:30] anything,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; just know you already have everything.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Even though Abraham looked poor,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; be careful. The blessing of Elleon,
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; that's what he needed
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; to possess everything.
[1:44:48] Are we together?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; let's go to Genesis 15.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Remember something.
[1:45:09] Remember, look at this.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. We found out that when Abraham met
[1:45:14] Melkisedc,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't have children.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; We know that, right?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; We know that, right?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Then Paul goes to back to the Old
[1:45:24] Testament.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And Paul look at Abraham and
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; And when Paul begin to watch the movie,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. of Abraham and
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Paul put some software
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; that allow him to see below the screen.
[1:45:43] You remember that
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; when Paul look below the screen Paul
[1:45:47] begin to say that hey
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; externally Abraham didn't have children
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; the first aspect is poverty you
[1:46:01] understand that
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; the second aset is aspect he was
[1:46:06] childless
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; exteriorly
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:46:13] Are we together?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; So when Paul look he said uh
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham had children
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; he said leave
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; not Isaac Leah
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; was where
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; and the sons of liver
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; plural
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; und delivered.
[1:46:38] Abraham
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; where where
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; in Abra.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; So Abra so when Paul look he said hey
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; this man has so many children.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Follow me my friend.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Let you use you brother.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; the children were where?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; We found out that
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham begat who?
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Isaac. Isaac begat who?
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Jacob.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And Jacob begat who?
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And Leah the son of Levah.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; So we find the sons of Leah were where?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Lev was where?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Jacob must be where?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Isaac must be where?
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; So the whole nation of Israel was where?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I have a news for you.
[1:47:37] You want to hear that news?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You want to hear that news?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Ishmael also
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go somewhere.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Was also inside.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; So Abraham had two type of children.
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Church, I'm trying to move.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move. Abraham
[1:48:06] has two type of children.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put it here
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; and I let brother man the Bible tell us
[1:48:14] the type of children.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Let's go first to Genesis 15.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; We are reading the Bible. Verse one.
[1:48:22] Let's go. My friend
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; after these things.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The word of the Lord came to who?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And uh in a vision. Continue, my friend.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Saying fear not.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; I am thy shield.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and thy exceeding great reward.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; And Abram said,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; what will thou give me?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Seeing I go childless.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; See, I go how?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Childless.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; So Abraham thought he was how?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Childless.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; But Paul is saying what was in Abraham?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Sons of Levi.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Not only sons of Levah,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Levi.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Levi himself. All Israel was right
[1:48:56] there.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; But Abraham is saying I'm what? child.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; So exteriorally,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham is childless.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Yet on the inside,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; remember, I'm going to get to a tree.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Abraham has swept many things.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And then go ahead.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; And the steward of my house is this
[1:49:16] Eleazar of Damascus.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; So, so where was Abraham looking at?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; On the inside or outside?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Outside.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; You see many times we looking at our
[1:49:25] life on the outside.
[1:49:27] Take your time, brother.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And then we begin to designate thing. I
[1:49:31] believe uh I see Elza is a good man.
[1:49:34] He's very faithful. He he's he's
[1:49:36] consecrated and everything. I believe
[1:49:38] Eleazar of Damascus is the one that's
[1:49:40] going to be my
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham is looking with the eyes,
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; but he's not looking with the eyes.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go my friend. And
[1:49:57] Abraham
[1:49:58] said, "Behold to me you have given
[1:50:00] what?"
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; No seed.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Are you sure, Abraham?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And lo, one born
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; in my house.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Will be what?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Is my air.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, the heir is who? Eleaz.
[1:50:14] Because he's born in a child. So this is
[1:50:16] the air.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Verse four. And behold, the word of the
[1:50:20] Lord came to him saying, What?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; This shall not be thine air. Ah, not
[1:50:24] Eleazar but water.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; He that shall come forth out of thine
[1:50:28] own bowels shall be thine heir. God is
[1:50:31] saying the air of Abraham will come
[1:50:34] forth from where?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; From what?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Can you can you repeat what the Bible
[1:50:41] say? The air will come from whose bowel?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham's bowel.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; So if the air is coming from the bower,
[1:50:48] where was the air?
[1:50:51] In other words, God is telling Abraham
[1:50:53] inside of you,
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; you already got children.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; God is repeating to Abraham, listen
[1:51:04] inside of you, you already got children.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He's saying, I'm say, change your
[1:51:08] confession.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; That's why God has to change his name
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; based on what was inside.
[1:51:18] I'm going to get there.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get there.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; So, we found out that the children of
[1:51:25] Abraham,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; the children of Abraham were inside
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; in his own power.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; But his confession is childless.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Abraham childless.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Abraham childless.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And you're going to see why God have to
[1:51:46] change. his name.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Nations are already inside here.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; No problem. Job to verse uh five.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; And he brought him forth what?
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Abroad.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; And said,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; "Look now toward heaven."
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And tell the stars
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; If thou be able to number them,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And he said unto him, Uhhuh.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; so shall thy seed be.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And he believed in the Lord
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; and so shall that seed be.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And then he believed in the water
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; and he was counted to him from water
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; So God told Abraham your seed is inside
[1:52:28] of you.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; And maybe Abraham thought maybe so my
[1:52:34] children are here. Huh. So maybe since
[1:52:37] me and Sarah discussed that we will have
[1:52:39] five. So Sarah wanted two boys and then
[1:52:42] three girls. So I believe I got five
[1:52:45] children. God said
[1:52:47] before Abraham begin to bring the
[1:52:49] discussion with Sarah Abraham I am going
[1:52:51] to give you the number of children in
[1:52:53] you come outside
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want your number come outside
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; do you follow me
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; come outside he said look at the star
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; go ahead and number them
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; say who can do that he said you see how
[1:53:07] you cannot number
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; inside of you
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; the unlimited number that's what is
[1:53:14] inside of you.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; I hope you understanding.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So in Abraham
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; there was unlimited number
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; unlimited number of children yet
[1:53:29] naturally speaking. You don't see
[1:53:31] anything.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Let's go now to Genesis 16. We're moving
[1:53:40] very good, my friend.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; We're moving very good. If you dare, you
[1:53:47] can say amen.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Genesis 16. When I say moving very good,
[1:53:51] keep moving very good. Let's go to verse
[1:53:53] one.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; And Sarah, Abraham's wife, bore him
[1:53:58] water,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; no children.
[1:54:01] And she had a handmade.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Now, because of the time, remember God
[1:54:09] already show Abraham that his children
[1:54:12] are well.
[1:54:17] The problem is if they are inside, why
[1:54:20] are they not coming out?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; The problem is the season.
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Can you please help me up? It's already
[1:54:33] there,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't come out like that.
[1:54:38] [Applause]
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Because of that, Sarah begin to say,
[1:54:47] "Wait a minute.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; You told me God told you you got two too
[1:54:51] many children like the star of the
[1:54:53] heaven. Me, I don't see anything.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; now. Sarah bring the pressure
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; and the pressure against the word of
[1:55:06] God."
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Let's let let's move on closely.
[1:55:11] Why? Because what God say does not
[1:55:15] appear yet.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Because Abraham expressed his desire to
[1:55:23] God.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, yes, but you bless me as
[1:55:27] Leon. I understand.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; But I don't have a baby.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Is this one the one I'm going to get?"
[1:55:32] God answer his prayer.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And God say, "Listen, in you they are
[1:55:36] children."
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; In other words, that should finish the
[1:55:39] problem right here. right there.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Are we do are you with me?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; But because of the timing,
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; the pressure begin to come.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Sarah could not stand
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; waiting again too long.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Now Sarah open up an alternative.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It's going to drop like a bomb, my
[1:56:03] friend.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When Sarah opened an
[1:56:07] alternative, sir,
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; remember my friend, follow me.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; When the promised son came,
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; what was his name?
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; His name was Isaac.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; When Sarah changed the game,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; God took the bullet of Isaac
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; and move it down.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And pulled the bullet of Ishmael
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; and pull it up. Remember
[1:56:38] Ishmael was there
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; and Isaac was there and Levi was there.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; But when Sarah begin to doubt the
[1:56:50] promise
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; the other womb of Abraham open up
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; not the promised womb.
[1:57:00] There it is.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you time to soak this in.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; I'm on the bumpy place, my friend.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Everybody alive.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody alive.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Now, get this. I'm going to drop it.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Verse uh one. Don't worry. I'm
[1:57:23] going to give you scripture. I'm going
[1:57:24] to nail it.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; You know your pastor.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Verse one. Now Sarah Abraham's wife did
[1:57:31] water
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; bear him no children
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; bore him water
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; no children
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; and she had a water
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and handmade
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; was that a promise of God
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; no
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; continue and a what
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; an Egyptian
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; so he went into getting a word living
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; that was living in the church
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:57:58] So Egypt was lingering a little bit
[1:58:00] somewhere there
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; in the house.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; And because Egypt was lingering in the
[1:58:05] house,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; that was a doll the devil use.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever weaknesses that you still
[1:58:16] playing around with it
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; in your life,
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; that's where the devil will punch you.
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Do you follow me?
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Then he went to the Egyptian. Let's go.
[1:58:30] The Egyptian whose name was who?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Hagar.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; And Sarah said to Abraham, "Behold now,
[1:58:36] the Lord has what?
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Restrained me from bearing."
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; I pray you go into my water
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; and it may be that I may obtain what?
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Children by her.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; How can another woman have a child and
[1:58:48] then you call that child your child?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; You see certain things.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then that I may obtain
[1:59:01] children by her." And Abraham did what?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Hearken to the voice of Sarah.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And Sarah, Abraham, wife, took who?
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Hagar.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So who took Hagar?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; So who brought Aar to the bedroom?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Mama. Sarah.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; What is going on? I a I figure a plan.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; I figure a plan.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; I believe in this message it doesn't
[1:59:24] happen. So, let me take you somewhere
[1:59:26] first
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; because it's taking too long in the
[1:59:30] church.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little bit outside
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; so we can get it from outside.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to drop it. I don't have
[1:59:43] any choice.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham has two type of children.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Abraham have the children by promise.
[1:59:53] Yes.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; And Abraham have children by flesh.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Let me drop it because somebody is
[2:00:07] resisting. Brother Brham says in the
[2:00:10] exposition of the seven churches in the
[2:00:12] Ephesian churches, he says, "Then we see
[2:00:15] a what?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; A perfect picture
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; in Abraham's sons of what?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; The flesh.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; His name is what?
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Ishmael." So Ismael was not a son of the
[2:00:24] promise.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; He was a son of what?
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; The flesh.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; So when you are following your flesh,
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; you will produce Ishmael.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly, my friend.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "The sons of the flesh." Who?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Ishmael.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Who did what?
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Who teased and fought the son of the
[2:00:48] promise?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Who's what?
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Isaac. So we got sons of what?
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; The flesh
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; and sons of what?
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; The promise.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Where did brother get that? In a
[2:00:56] Galatian 4:23. But he who was born of
[2:00:59] what?
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; The bond woman
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; was born how?
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; After the flesh.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; But he of a free woman was born by what?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Promise.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; So in Abraham there was two type of
[2:01:09] children.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Children by promise
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; and children by flesh.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; But when you reject the word of God,
[2:01:18] There is
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; your delivery change.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Instead of picking up Isaac,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; the delivery change and went and pick up
[2:01:29] Ishmael.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; The first son that should come from from
[2:01:36] Abraham is
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Isaac.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; And Isaac come by promise.
[2:01:42] But because Sarah doubt,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; God cannot bring Isaac.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; With a doubt,
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; God say what is going on there is doubt.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Doubt. Isaac doesn't come with doubt.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; The one who come with doubt
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; is Ishmael.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Beautiful brother.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Let's look at Ishmael before I move on.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Verse four. And he went into what?
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Hagar.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And she conceived.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Ah. And when she saw that water,
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; she had conceived.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Her mistress was what?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Despised in her eyes.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; This home was peaceful.
[2:02:34] Everything in this house was going fine
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; until Sarah deviated.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Now trouble happen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Trouble entering the house.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; We cause our own problem.
[2:02:53] [Applause]
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are understanding why. How do
[2:02:58] we cause our own problem? by doing
[2:03:01] things that are against the word of God.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Let me help you up again. I know I'm
[2:03:11] going to drive. I'm It's a little bit
[2:03:13] bumpy. Drop to verse 11. Father, help
[2:03:17] me. And the angel of the Lord, who is
[2:03:19] the angel of the Lord?
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; God himself. The angel of the Lord said
[2:03:23] to her, to Hagar,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Behold, you are water
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; with child
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; and shall bear a water,
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; a son.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; And you shall call his name water,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Ishmael,
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; because the Lord has heard your
[2:03:35] affliction,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; and he will be a good man.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; No, a
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; he will be a what?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; A wild man.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; So Sarah produce what?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; A wild man.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; The blessing of the Lord.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible say it is the blessing of the
[2:03:51] Lord.
[2:03:52] Huh?
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; That make you what?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; That make you rich. And added what?
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; When Isaac come, Isaac will not bring
[2:04:01] sorrow.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; But when is my come
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; because you did think contrary to the
[2:04:07] word. Ishmael will bring sorrow.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; And I know I mean I'm I'm in a
[2:04:14] difficulty zone, but we going to pass.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; He say he will be a what?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; A wild man. His hand will be against
[2:04:21] what?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Every man.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Some man.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; No wonder he was fighting Isaac.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; His hand is against who?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Every man.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; And every man hands against what?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Him.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; He shall dwell in the presence of what?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; All his brethren.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; So going against the will of God produce
[2:04:41] an Ishmael.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to say is this. Follow
[2:04:44] me my friend. inside of Abraham. His
[2:04:48] children were there,
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; but they were negative children
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; of the flesh
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; and they were positive children of the
[2:04:57] promise.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say to us, Pastor
[2:05:01] Steven? What I'm trying to say is this.
[2:05:04] Your flesh have desires
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; that are contrary to the word of God.
[2:05:12] And if you follow your flesh,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; you will produce Ismael.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; That is not Godgiven promises.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; But if you wait on the Lord
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; at the right season,
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Isaac will come out.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; In your flesh, you got your soul.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; You got your body. And you got your
[2:05:42] spirit.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Your spirit operate your body.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; And your body is not under redemption
[2:05:47] yet.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That's why we are struggling in the
[2:05:50] body.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; So you got children in the body.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; But you got also children in the soul.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; What is in the soul is towards your
[2:06:00] promise.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; But what is in your body is based on
[2:06:03] what your eyes can see.
[2:06:06] So if you begin to lean more on the
[2:06:09] sight
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; than faith,
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; just be prepared to receive Ishmael.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, there are things that we
[2:06:17] did before season.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Because we were going through pressure.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; God already heard you.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; God already gave you what you needed.
[2:06:32] But he must come at the a certain time.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; But when you push too hard
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; according to the lust of your flesh,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; you will open another son who is
[2:06:44] Ishmael.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Every sister here, every brother here
[2:06:56] that is not married got a promise to be
[2:06:59] married.
[2:07:01] and your marriage have a date
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; and your husband have his time.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; But if you don't understand and you push
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; and you begin to go contrary to the word
[2:07:14] of God, you going to get an Ishmael.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Remember you are produce a wild husband.
[2:07:24] [Applause]
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; You can make it look like yours.
[2:07:31] But it's not yours.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Bring me bring me the baby.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Sarah, you got a baby? Yes, I got a baby
[2:07:37] now.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; But you are old with a baby. It doesn't
[2:07:40] make sense.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; The baby is for Hega. You took somebody
[2:07:44] else husband.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; You going to marry the wrong man.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Because you want to go outside the word.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; When you go outside the word, God pull
[2:07:54] Isaac back
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; and he lord Ishmael.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; So you will learn the hard way.
[2:08:00] [Applause]
[2:08:04] You want a husband, get your husband in
[2:08:06] the message.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; You want a wife, get your wife in the
[2:08:10] message. If you deviate from that, God
[2:08:14] will give you one. An Ishmael.
[2:08:17] [Applause]
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; if you marry against the word of God,
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; prepare for an Ishmael marriage.
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm I'm I'm already off the
[2:08:38] bumpy road.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet say.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; He said, but God does what?
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Keeps his promise.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; No matter how unreasonable it may seems,
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; God is obligated to what?
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; His promise. Sarah thought,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; are you following me?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Sarah thought that maybe he could what?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Have Hagar
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; or who?
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Rather
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; rather he her what?
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Her maid

[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; And she will do what?
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Take it.

[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Ishmael.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Which was a what?
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; A thorn in the flesh.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; We create our own problem
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; because we don't want to wait on the
[2:09:21] Lord.
[2:09:23] Because we are moving before the season.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Then you're going to create an Ishmael
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; because Lord, I have been waiting too
[2:09:30] long. I don't have it. Let me try this
[2:09:32] one. Ishmael.
[2:09:34] [Applause]
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Isaac will only be loaded
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; when it's Sarah.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; When God look at Sarah, he say pull
[2:09:42] Isaac.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Who is not Isaac?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Bring the wild men.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Get it?
[2:09:51] bring the wives husband.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; You will pray so long.
[2:09:57] [Applause]
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And he became what?"
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Ishmael, which was what?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Adorn in the flesh
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; from until what?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; so the sorrow didn't stop with Sarah.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Even today, Israel is suffering.
[2:10:27] Amen.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; My brother, whatever you trying to do
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; against this message,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; don't worry.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; When the baby's born, you will be happy.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Give it some time.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Look at the characteristic.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; You will reap an Ishmael.
[2:10:43] He says
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; still a what?
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; A thorn in the flesh.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; For out of there came what?
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; The Arabs.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Still today.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; They cannot bring the Arab
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; in peace with Israel.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; The jihad soul. They have to wipe
[2:10:58] Israel.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Israel is suffering today because of
[2:11:03] Sarah.
[2:11:05] [Applause]
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Watch the decision you taking.
[2:11:13] Daddy, watch your decision. Mommy, watch
[2:11:16] your decision. You can make the whole
[2:11:19] family suffer.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't say amen, that's okay with
[2:11:26] me.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother say, and they are
[2:11:30] always been how
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; that way.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Now, anytime.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; That what
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; that you disbelieve
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; the what?
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; The naked word of God. Push the brake.
[2:11:42] Brother Brandham did it. Say you
[2:11:43] disbelieve the word of God.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; You disbelieve the what?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; The naked word of God.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; The word. So the word naked,
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; in other words, the word without
[2:11:53] clothing,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; the avail world.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:11:59] In other words, when God open up to you
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; and you refuse to take it
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; when you disbelieve the what?
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; The naked word of God.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; I didn't use the word naked. It's
[2:12:15] brother.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, the word without
[2:12:18] clothing.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; The word without clothing is a veil
[2:12:21] word.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; But a naked one is the unveiling of God.
[2:12:26] When God unfold himself
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; and show you plainly his
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; his will and you refuse it.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. Anytime that you
[2:12:38] disbelieve what
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; the naked word of God
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; and adopt some other way.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hey God, it shall be a turn
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; in your flesh from there on.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Guarantee my friend.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Go do what you want to do.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will ask you five years down the
[2:12:57] road.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; You take just what
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; God said.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; If he said it, what do you do?
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; That's just what he means.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:13:11] Just take what?
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; His word.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Sarah went before the promise.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; She said, "We don't have children.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Let me produce one." Sarah did not know
[2:13:23] inside of Abraham
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; was unlimited child.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Sarah went before the promise
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; and God loaded Ishmael.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Now who was the first one to cast
[2:13:35] Ishmael?
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Who was suffering with
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Hagar?
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Abraham say it's your servant.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; I just did what you wanted me to do.
[2:13:48] It's your servant. You will suffer
[2:13:50] yourself.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:54] Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Kickshell
[2:13:56] out. Who started?
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; You don't need to take an alternative
[2:14:05] against the word of God.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Because everything you need is already
[2:14:10] new.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. But if you go against the
[2:14:14] word of God, God will give you the
[2:14:16] desire of your flesh
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; and not the desire of his promise.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; And the desire of your your flesh will
[2:14:24] bring you trouble.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; You can get a car before time
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; and that payment will make you suffer
[2:14:34] [Applause]
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; because you bought a car by competition.
[2:14:41] You bought a house by competition. It
[2:14:43] was not your season. God loed Ishmael
[2:14:47] house. Israel car is my bill. And those
[2:14:52] bill will make you suffer.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; One bill,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; one bill, brother Glenn,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; will destroy your credit. And it will
[2:15:06] take seven years
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; to clean up your credit
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; because you went under Ishmael.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Young sister, pull the brake. Young
[2:15:17] brother, pull the brake. Don't give way
[2:15:20] to this. Give time to everything. There
[2:15:22] is a season.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; So and so bought a house. I'm going to
[2:15:33] buy a house. Maybe it's not your time.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; It is that time. You will get in the
[2:15:38] high interest and you will see how you
[2:15:40] will suffer.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; The house will take both income.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; You can't sleep at home
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; because of the mortgage.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; The mortgage is an is
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; God want you to have a house, but get
[2:16:00] the house at God's time. When it comes
[2:16:03] to God's time, Jehovah Gara will provide
[2:16:07] for the income of your house.
[2:16:10] [Applause]
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Can I continue, my friend? Can I
[2:16:17] continue, my friend?
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let's go to Genesis
[2:16:21] 17.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; I'm about to finish my reading. So, now
[2:16:24] we can start.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 17.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; I'm about to finish the reading. Let's
[2:16:32] go to Genesis 17.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Remember how many children are inside of
[2:16:38] Abraham?
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Now, why did God give Abraham the name
[2:16:43] father of nation?
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; It was based on what was what?
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Now,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; let's go to Genesis uh uh 17. Let's keep
[2:16:56] some time quickly.
[2:16:58] Job to verse five so we save time. He
[2:17:01] says, "Neither shall your name be more
[2:17:03] called what?"
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Abram.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; But your name shall be what?
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Which means what?
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; So the name Abraham.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham changed to what?
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; changed to Abraham.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; The Ham here.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brought a new
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; meaning
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; to Abraham. Amen.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; The arm here was only revealing
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; what was inside of Abraham.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, what was inside of
[2:17:41] Abraham,
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, now put what is inside
[2:17:46] of you in your lip.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Now begin to speak it
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; to me and you. When we say Abraham, you
[2:17:58] are understanding Abraham.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew, when they were saying
[2:18:02] Abraham, what truly they were saying is
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; father of many nation.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Then Abraham turned come here,
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; mother of many nation.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; So when Abraham went, he said, "I want
[2:18:21] to change my name." And they did.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; They say, "You want to change your
[2:18:25] name?" me say yes I want to change my
[2:18:27] name even in the social security
[2:18:28] everything
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; what is your new name father of many
[2:18:31] nation
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; he texts his friend on WhatsApp on a
[2:18:38] vast group chat
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; he said from today on you call me father
[2:18:42] of many nations
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; so when Abraham is going father of many
[2:18:46] nation
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; in other word God begin to create an
[2:18:51] atmosphere
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; around Abraham
[2:18:56] to realize what was inside of him
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; to get Abraham in the mood.
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:04] [Applause]
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, when Sarah when Abraham
[2:19:11] sees Sarah, he doesn't say Sarah. He say
[2:19:13] he say mother of many nation. Say yes
[2:19:15] father of many nation.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; How are you doing?
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Mother of many nation. How did you sleep
[2:19:21] today? He was calling a barren woman,
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; mother of many nation
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; and a father that doesn't have a child.
[2:19:31] Father of many nation, how are you
[2:19:33] doing? This is Bank of America calling.
[2:19:35] Can we speak to the father of many
[2:19:37] nation? When Abraham hear that remind
[2:19:40] him, God,
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; H was number eight. A was one. Right.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Both of them means eternity.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; So God took eternal eternity.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Following me? Yes sir.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; And insert eternity in Abraham.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; If you notice HA was not put outside the
[2:20:12] borders.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; H. Please help me. God push the letters
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; and put the ha where
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; God bring eternal life where
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Not outside of you. God have to open you
[2:20:34] then take eternal life and put it where
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:20:39] [Applause]
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of this?
[2:20:45] Amen.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Watch my friend. He says, "Your name,
[2:20:52] verse 5, shall be called what?" Abraham,
[2:20:55] for a what?
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; A father of many nations have I made
[2:20:58] thee.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; And I will make you how?
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Exceeding fruitful.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; And I will make what?
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Nations of thee.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; And kings shall come out of thee.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Fine. Now jump to verse 10. Watch with
[2:21:09] me, my friend. Stay stay put up. We
[2:21:11] good.
[2:21:13] We are good. We are good. Stay put.
[2:21:15] Let's go to 10. This is my water
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; covenant
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; which shall which you shall keep between
[2:21:21] me and you and your seed. What
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; after thee?
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Every child every man child among you
[2:21:26] shall be what?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Circumcised.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; So when did circumcision came
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; after
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; when they change what?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; So the changing of the name.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Was coming with circumcision.
[2:21:44] Are we together?
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Because the changing of name brought
[2:21:48] eternal life
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; inside of Abraham.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; That's why God reflected that as a
[2:21:56] circumcision.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; In other words, circumcision was a
[2:22:02] reflection of what happened inside.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, the Holy Ghost got
[2:22:08] inside of Abraham
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; in type.
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:13] That's correct.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; As a covenant.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh uh verse 19.
[2:22:26] Job to verse 6 uh 15. And God said to
[2:22:29] Abraham, as for your wife, uh for Sarah,
[2:22:32] your wife, you shall call you shall not
[2:22:35] call her what?
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; But you shall call what? Her what?
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Why
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; shall her name be? And I will bless her
[2:22:43] and give you a son also of what?
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; So uh so out of Sarah must come Isaac.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I will bless her. Are we
[2:22:53] together?
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; And she shall be a what?
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Mother of nations.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; King of people shall be of what?
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Out of her.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 19 and we finish our
[2:23:03] reading.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; And God say Sarah your wife shall bear
[2:23:07] what?
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; The a son indeed.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and thou shalt call his his name
[2:23:11] Isaac.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Was Isaac born?
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; But his name is already out.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; But we know Isaac was already there a
[2:23:18] long time.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Now God revealed the name
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; of something that was already there.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; So if you ask Sarah,
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; what are you going to have? He say he
[2:23:33] I'm going to have a baby boy. His name
[2:23:34] will
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Are you pregnant yet? No. How do you
[2:23:38] know the child is going to be a baby
[2:23:39] boy?
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "You shall call his name who?"
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Isaac.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; "And I will establish my covenant with
[2:23:48] him for an everlasting covenant and with
[2:23:51] his seed after what?"
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Let's start preaching now.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Turn your 45 minutes.
[2:23:59] [Laughter]
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; and when you together you shout amen.

[2:24:27] there.

[2:24:38] testimony. I didn't say anything.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Ah, back up my friend.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; God change Abraham name.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Abraham was already having babies
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; and then God put another thing to his
[2:24:57] name before the baby comes out.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Why did God has to change the name?
[2:25:04] before bringing what was inside of
[2:25:06] Abraham.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Follow me now.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, my friend, God
[2:25:13] has been testing the patriarch
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; because he has given him what?
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Promise.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; And when God make a promise,
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; he want to be sure.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Help me my friend
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; that this person
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; that this person is worthy
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; of the promise.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Before he fulfill what he said or what
[2:25:37] he did what
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; promises.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; So before God give you that
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; God must put you through a test
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; to verify.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; If you ready to receive it.
[2:25:51] [Applause]
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Pam continue. He says and that's
[2:25:58] the way it is with all seeds of what?
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; God did what? gives us that final test
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; just before he gives what
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; the promise
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; and if it was possible I like to say
[2:26:09] something here personally but I for that
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; that what
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; final test
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; to see what
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; how you react upon
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; and when he gave Abraham this test he
[2:26:22] found Abraham was how
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; just as true as he was when he started
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; what a blessing it will be this morning
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; if we who take his promise of healing
[2:26:33] will do what?
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Would stand just as true as we did
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; when we stood here and did what?
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Accepted it.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; No matter what the doctors say,
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; what do you do?
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Stand just as true.
[2:26:46] [Applause]
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He say
[2:26:54] Abraham when he finally did what?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Overcome.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; He was taken from a name of what?
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Abram. Say, you shall not be called
[2:27:02] Abraham anymore, but you shall be called
[2:27:04] what?
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Give him part of his name.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Now follow me, my friend.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; T his name onto it.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Elohim.

[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; H I am.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; H A M.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; Which means what?
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, I am the father of what?
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; All things.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm making you a father of what?
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Nations. So I have changed and given you
[2:27:32] what?
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Part of my name.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Father of what?
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Nations.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; H A M. Elohim
[2:27:39] Abraham.
[2:27:41] That is a good
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; sentence.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think about that? A great
[2:27:46] evangelist
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; today.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; Name what?
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Graham.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Continue my friend.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; G R A H A M.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Billy Graham. Think of it. How that God
[2:27:56] in his mercy how he did what? for knows
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; and thinks what
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; that he does.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is taking that time and
[2:28:04] bringing it to this time and saying
[2:28:07] notice there is somebody called Billy
[2:28:09] Graham.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; we're going to get there. What are you
[2:28:15] trying to say? Watch. When God here,
[2:28:19] here is something. I hope he don't choke
[2:28:21] you.
[2:28:28] church, help me move so we can go. If
[2:28:31] not, I don't know how I'm going to
[2:28:32] preach this.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; I hope he won't do what?
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Choke you.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; But look, when God, before he met
[2:28:39] Abraham, the father of nation, he did
[2:28:42] what?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; He changed his name
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; from what?
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Abram
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; to what?
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; To Abraham.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; What did he do?
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Put H A M on the end of it.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; And what? H A M
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; because what he was going to bring
[2:28:55] through him the what?
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Father of nations.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; He took what?
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Part of his own name.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Elohim and made him what?
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; So Abraham have a part of God in him.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say now
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; if you want to know where the who?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Billy Graham.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Look at the end of his name. What is it?
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; G R A H A M. You understand?
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Now you see everything has to be how?
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; And it is how?
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; The one that don't see it is
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; blind.
[2:29:31] [Music]
[2:29:32] [Applause]
[2:29:34] [Music]
[2:29:44] Hallelujah.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:01] [Applause]
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Are we clear? Amen.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; He says Abraham that was the name what
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; given
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; and that name never rose on until just
[2:30:15] at the end time.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; So he has watch the name ending on what?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; H A M
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Abraham what?
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; And see who?
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Graham.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Notice you just said the end time. Oh,
[2:30:27] we could break it down a little further
[2:30:29] than that, but that is far enough for
[2:30:31] you to know.
[2:30:32] [Applause]
[2:30:34] Hallelujah.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, what happened in the
[2:30:38] time of Abraham
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; where God took part of his name
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; and put it in. Amen. God is repeating
[2:30:45] that again.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? My friend, don't worry.
[2:30:52] Back up. Brother says this. He says,
[2:30:56] "Now here was who?
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; His name has been changed from what?
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Abraham. do what?
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham,
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; which means what?
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Father of nations.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; And he
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; could not have a baby
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; even though the babies were there.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; He could not have a baby as long as his
[2:31:17] name was what?
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; So the babies were there.
[2:31:23] Amen.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; But the babies were waiting for eternity
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; to come into Abraham
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; to open the door of the promised son.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "And he could not have a baby
[2:31:43] as long as his name was who?"
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; He had to be changed to what?
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; For Ham does mean what?
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Father of nations. Now notice father of
[2:31:53] what?
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; To the nations.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to say here, brother
[2:31:57] Brham says babies were already in
[2:32:00] Abraham.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; But we found out that no baby can come
[2:32:03] out
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; because the name is Abraham.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; So God took eternal life
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; and put it into Abraham.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; When eternal life enter into Abraham,
[2:32:15] every promised son was quickened.
[2:32:21] No more Ishmael.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Now every promised son is quickened.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, another door has opened
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; to bring what God promised for your
[2:32:31] life.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly, my friend.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I'm going to
[2:32:38] maneuver the airplane. The Bible say in
[2:32:40] Psalm 27,
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; he said three. He say low water.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; Children
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; are water.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Inheritage of the Lord
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; and the fruit of the womb
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; are what
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; is his reward.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible is calling children what?
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; An inheritage of the Lord.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; And he's calling them something else.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; The children are what?
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; The fruit of the womb.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; The children are fruit.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; They are fruit of the womb.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Follow me. My friend sir,
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; children are fruit of the womb.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; Fruit don't come up anytime.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; I have started my sermon.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Fruit come in season.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; And we know that through faith we
[2:33:33] understand that what
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; the worlds were framed by the word of
[2:33:37] God. So that the things which are what
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; seen
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; are made of things which are what
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; do appear.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, what we see visibly
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; came from what?
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; The invisible.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; There was a time when Isaac was
[2:33:57] invisible.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Then Isaac moved from the invisible
[2:34:04] to the what?
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; Visible. So when you so so whatever is
[2:34:08] visible came first from where?
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Keep it my friend. My friend keep it my
[2:34:15] friend. God says what?
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Let there be
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; and he was he believed what
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; his own word.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Every material things come from what?
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; The supernatural.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Let me go slowly my friend. Remember you
[2:34:31] are possessor of everything
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; but you don't possess it materially.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; You first possess it supernaturally
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; before it become material.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Father help this church.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Lord help this church.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; This is the best part and the devil is
[2:34:53] trying to trouble you.
[2:34:55] Everything that you see naturally
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; started invisible.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; You see me today, I was invisible.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; I was in my father
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; until my father married my mother.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; And when the time came, I came after my
[2:35:16] brother.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; I was not supposed to be the elder. I
[2:35:19] have my time.
[2:35:20] [Applause]
[2:35:23] So what you see naturally was already
[2:35:26] existing spiritually.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; So whatever you need, you already have
[2:35:33] it
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; as a substance.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; There is.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; He says every material things come how?
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; From the supernatural.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; God spoke the word how
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; into existence. If he didn't, where did
[2:35:50] he get the material to make it?
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, the material were where?
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; Because a word is a thought.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's a thought expressed.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; So before God spoke, it was already in
[2:36:05] him.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; So creation is only bringing out what
[2:36:09] was already existing.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Brother Bradam say
[2:36:18] he made it because it is what
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; his word
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; he spoke it and said it what
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; let there be
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; it was when God says anything if you
[2:36:28] shall accept it and do what?
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hold on to it.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; There are things that were in God.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; And God spoke the world
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; and the world came out of God and became
[2:36:43] material.
[2:36:45] There are things that are in you
[2:36:48] [Music]
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; that need to come out.
[2:36:54] [Applause]
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shock you my friend.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; The squirrel,
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; the desire of the squirrel
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; were not was not in God.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need squirrel to hunt.
[2:37:11] It was a desire in brother Brana.
[2:37:17] [Applause]
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; God was not looking for squirrel.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; The one that was looking for squirrel
[2:37:25] was brother.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; But the squirrel don't come out anytime.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My friend, about what?
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Two weeks later,
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; I was done where? In the state of
[2:37:41] Kentucky
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; where what
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; squirrel season was still push the brake
[2:37:45] where what
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; squirrel season was still
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; so the squirrel also have seasonal
[2:37:52] [Applause]
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; you don't get me my friend
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; you don't get me my friend
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; many people in this message we know
[2:38:02] brother Brham created square
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; when brother Brham created square
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; brother Brham created square in squirrel
[2:38:10] season.
[2:38:13] [Applause]
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Ah.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hey my friend. My friend, come on.
[2:38:20] Come on. On the pulpit.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; He says he why it was water.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; Squirrel season
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; was water
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; still in
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; with water.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Friends of mine,
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Mr. Wood and his brother-in-law. And I
[2:38:32] was standing down there and we went
[2:38:34] doing water,
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; hunting that morning.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was how
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; windy
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; and water. and the leaves all of the
[2:38:39] trees.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; It was a bad time to what?
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; To squirrel hunt.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; But it was still the season.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; It was a bad time, but it was the
[2:38:48] season.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; What's the season? Even if it's a bad
[2:38:52] time,
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; we want to make sure it's the season.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understanding me.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; The desire was there. Correct.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; The season was there.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; All Brother Brham needed was the
[2:39:12] anointing.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; There it is, brother. There it is right
[2:39:15] there, brother.
[2:39:17] Jesus.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; The children were in Abraham.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; The desire to have children was in
[2:39:26] Abraham.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham needed for HA to come.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Father, help us. He says it was a bad
[2:39:37] time to do what
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; squirrel hunt.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Good hunter was not catching over a b
[2:39:42] water
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; one a day.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; And when you had have a shotgun to get
[2:39:45] them with them and me water.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said the creation of the
[2:39:50] squirrel happened in squirrel season
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; not anytime.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; It was in squirrel season.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; A desire came from Abraham
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; to receive squirrel. Then God came in
[2:40:05] the season of square to give square to
[2:40:09] his son. Why? Because to everything
[2:40:13] [Applause]
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; there is what
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; a season.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; There is a season for squirrel.
[2:40:22] [Music]
[2:40:23] [Laughter]
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; Father help me my friend.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. Glory to
[2:40:36] God. He said, "You might plant wheat at
[2:40:39] one time."
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; One time.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, grain and water.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; Another time.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; Somehow slower than others
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; because it depends on what?
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; The season.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; So the season determine the speed.
[2:40:55] There it is.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's why your blessing might be a
[2:40:58] little bit slower
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; than so and so.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Because it's different season.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; You getting married in May, the other
[2:41:08] one will get married in November.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; It's a different season.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; One is coming slower than the other.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Because the crop are different.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; One is wheat,
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; one is corn.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; You cannot compete.
[2:41:24] sir.
[2:41:26] [Applause]
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; If your season has come, that's no
[2:41:30] problem. Man is coming.
[2:41:33] [Applause]
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Brother Brandham say
[2:41:40] everything comes what?
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Right in it season.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; You plant wheat in the fall of the year.
[2:41:50] In the spring of the year, it bring
[2:41:52] water.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; It sell forth. or water
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; or God brings it forth.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; So who's behind the season?
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this when he was
[2:41:58] talking to Nefel. He said, "Then I shall
[2:42:01] pray you, sir. What intelligence take
[2:42:04] that leaf off the tree even before cold
[2:42:06] weather and do water
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; and sends it life back down into the
[2:42:10] ground
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; for safety until it comes forth in
[2:42:12] another water season.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; You could put water in the bucket and
[2:42:16] set it on the post. It will never change
[2:42:18] by the season." So it shows that there
[2:42:20] is a God who does what?
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; Master's life.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Back up my friend. I'm
[2:42:26] heading to the airport. Jesus was
[2:42:28] speaking here. Was speaking. He said,
[2:42:31] "Father, what
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; the time has come."
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; Continue, my friend.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; Now there's seasons for everything.
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; There is a season for everything. Back
[2:42:38] up, my friend.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; You saw when
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; in a certain season
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; and you reap when
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; in a certain season. And there is season
[2:42:46] when the times come that is right for
[2:42:49] things to do what?
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Happen.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:42:52] [Music]
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. There is a season
[2:42:56] that what?
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; The time
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; the time will come
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; the time will come.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, the season bring the
[2:43:05] right time
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; for things to happen.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe you try because it was not the
[2:43:12] season. you fail sir
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; but when the season come things will
[2:43:17] happen correctly.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together?
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Listen my friend. He says this.
[2:43:31] Father help me.
[2:43:33] Give me a few minutes.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; I have to cut it off here because this
[2:43:38] is where I'm getting. Okay. Let's do
[2:43:39] this. The Bible says in Psalm 1,
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; he shall be like what?
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; A tree
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; planted by water.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; The rivers of water.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Let's push the brake.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Can you give me a few minutes?
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you,
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Deacon. You saw them. Yeah.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Get this. Then you go home.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; We agree.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; Get this, my friend.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; He shall be like water.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; A tree
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; that is water
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; planted by the rivers of water.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; Stop. We need to know who is
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; he.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; That is verse three.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Because my subject is tree and season.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Now we are there.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; Watch verse one.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; The verse one say what?
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; So the he is who?
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; So blessed is the man.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; This man is blessed.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; Follow me like Abraham.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; This man
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; is a blessed man.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:04] Blessed is the man, you know the story,
[2:45:07] that walk not in the counsel of the
[2:45:09] ungodly and so forth. Now in verse
[2:45:11] three, the Bible say, "And he that man,
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; do you follow me?
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; Shall be like a what?
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; A tree."
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; So a man is a tree.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; I'm now getting there.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; I'm now getting in my sermon.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; I'm in my sermon, my friend. So a man is
[2:45:34] a tree.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "And he shall be like a tree."
[2:45:44] That is how
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; planted by the river.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; The tree is not just a tree. It's a tree
[2:45:50] that is planted.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; It's a tree that is planted.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; Zero. It's a tree that is blessed. Amen.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; May God help you. Amen. Brother Brham
[2:46:07] says this. He says, "Now Israel in Egypt
[2:46:10] was not planted."
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; They were just what?
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Set out.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; He was not the original home ground.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; A man that is a Christian that rest his
[2:46:23] eternal destination upon some what?
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; Denominational creed.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; He's not in his right place.
[2:46:29] [Applause]
[2:46:30] Follow me my friend.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; He was born to be how?
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; Free
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; or and a child of God to do what?
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Worship God.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; But he's under what?
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; A creed.
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; He can bring forth his fruit.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; Some of your fruit won't come out
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; if you are not in the right place.
[2:46:51] [Applause]
[2:46:57] Hallelujah.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham have children.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Children are the fruit of the womb.
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; But if you give Abraham Hagar,
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; the wrong
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; the wrong seed come Ishmael.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; You need to find the correct bing
[2:47:17] ground.
[2:47:20] [Music]
[2:47:21] Amen.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; Some of you could not prosper
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; based on the church you at.
[2:47:31] [Applause]
[2:47:33] [Music]
[2:47:38] If you sit on the wrong church,
[2:47:41] you might have fruit,
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; but the fruit cannot come out
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; because the environment is wrong.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; You are in a high God.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; You are in a hog church.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; An Egyptian church.
[2:48:06] [Applause]
[2:48:08] Father, help me up.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Ah, he says, "And he can't bring what?"
[2:48:17] &gt;&gt; For his fruit.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; Yet something in him is what?
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; Longing to do it.
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, you will notice you are
[2:48:25] in an environment.
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; There is a desire in you
[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; to pull something,
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; but it looks like you can it cannot come
[2:48:32] out. The problem is, watch the church.
[2:48:36] Change the environment.
[2:48:39] [Applause]
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; You want the salvation of your church,
[2:48:47] it's already there. The salvation of
[2:48:50] your children is already there. Your
[2:48:53] [Applause]
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; preach. Amen.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; The environment is wrong.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; God block the fruit.
[2:49:05] Hallelujah.
[2:49:06] [Applause]
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know why things are not working.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know why things are not working.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; God is the one blocking the fruit.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Because if those fruit come
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; in that wrong environment, the devil
[2:49:23] will destroy it.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me.
[2:49:30] [Applause]
[2:49:32] It's your season to be blessed.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; We must be grounded in the message of
[2:49:38] the hour.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; The perfect ground.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; A church that doesn't preach the message
[2:49:45] correctly
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; is blocking your fruit.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:50] [Applause]
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hagar was in the house of Abraham.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; Sarah was in the house of Abraham.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; So churches can be called themselves
[2:50:06] message churches.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; But they are Hagar.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; We need Sarah
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; the promised one.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; The mother of nation.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; The father of nation must see the mother
[2:50:21] of nation.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?

[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; All things.
[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; And Elio is the Holy Ghost. It's Christ.
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; So when the Holy Ghost come, he's coming
[2:56:48] with a package.
[2:56:52] Inside the Holy Ghost, there are fruits.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; We need to know them.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; What is the first fruit, my friend?
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Is love.
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go this way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[2:57:08] What is the first fruit?
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; Love.
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; What is the second?

[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; No else.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; So when the Holy Ghost come in you,
[2:57:31] &gt;&gt; every fruit
[2:57:34] &gt;&gt; is already new.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Because you are praying God to give you
[2:57:42] gentleness.
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; But today God is telling you, you don't
[2:57:46] pray. Gentleness is there as a fruit.
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; Joy is there as a fruit.
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; Meekness is there as a fruit.
[2:57:59] &gt;&gt; Father help me.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; Lord help me.
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; This is the reason why some of you all
[2:58:06] of us we have been disturbed by
[2:58:08] Pentecost. Amen.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; If you notice
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; when you started the message,
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; you had maybe some of you had temper.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; And you keep moving
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; and after 2 3 years
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; for some reason that temper was removed.
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; But you don't understand how was the
[2:58:28] temper removed.
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; The temper was removed because the fruit
[2:58:32] will come in the season.
[2:58:34] [Applause]
[2:58:40] You will only notice it when somebody
[2:58:43] poke you wrong
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; and then suddenly you don't react.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "What happened to me?"
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; When did that change?
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; No. When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; every change was there.
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, we getting
[2:59:00] somewhere.
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; One of the fruit is joy.
[2:59:05] is joy, right?
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; And and Paul say always doing what?
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; So that joy was what?

[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.

[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; Watch my friend. It's a tree and season.

[2:59:26] fruit will continue to come out. Amen.
[2:59:30] [Applause]
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; You will become what God say you will.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; It is not outside of you.

[3:16:48] &gt;&gt; But I'm already being blessed.
[3:16:49] [Applause]
[3:16:56] Even though you blessed

[3:17:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:17:32] &gt;&gt; And from 10 years
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; we withdraw
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; 5,000 apple.
[3:17:40] Brother Brandham say there is five apple
[3:17:43] 5,000 apple
[3:17:45] &gt;&gt; where

[3:17:54] &gt;&gt; when it was just a corner
[3:17:56] &gt;&gt; he has all the tree
[3:17:57] &gt;&gt; and if you notice when the tree grow up
[3:18:01] it doesn't produce all five at
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; there is there is

[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; So if you reap this season
[3:18:26] &gt;&gt; and you have not reaped this season, it
[3:18:28] doesn't mean it's not there.

[3:26:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[3:26:37] [Applause]
[3:26:41] Friend,
[3:26:43] &gt;&gt; this walk is not for stress.
[3:26:48] &gt;&gt; This walk, this journey is not to be
[3:26:50] stressed.
[3:26:51] &gt;&gt; It's not to be confused.
[3:26:54] &gt;&gt; We confused because we don't know what's
[3:26:56] going on.
[3:26:57] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother says this. If you are
[3:27:00] planted in him and the only thing you
[3:27:02] have to do is water.
[3:27:04] &gt;&gt; Drink of his goodness
[3:27:05] &gt;&gt; and do what
[3:27:06] &gt;&gt; and push out whatever you have need of
[3:27:08] in this earth's journey.
[3:27:09] &gt;&gt; You drink of his water.
[3:27:10] &gt;&gt; Goodness.
[3:27:11] &gt;&gt; And what do you push out?
[3:27:12] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of
[3:27:13] &gt;&gt; to push out that thing is where
[3:27:16] &gt;&gt; in you.
[3:27:16] &gt;&gt; Why do you desire something different
[3:27:18] than brother Greg?
[3:27:21] &gt;&gt; Because that's your program.
[3:27:23] &gt;&gt; So don't look at what somebody else is
[3:27:25] doing. Look at what is coming from you
[3:27:28] &gt;&gt; and push it out.
[3:27:34] &gt;&gt; He says
[3:27:37] &gt;&gt; whatever you have need of what
[3:27:39] &gt;&gt; this earth's journey
[3:27:40] &gt;&gt; it is all
[3:27:41] &gt;&gt; drinking
[3:27:42] &gt;&gt; and what
[3:27:43] &gt;&gt; resting
[3:27:43] &gt;&gt; and what
[3:27:44] &gt;&gt; peace.
[3:27:45] &gt;&gt; It is not what you struggle
[3:27:48] &gt;&gt; and what
[3:27:49] &gt;&gt; and strive
[3:27:50] &gt;&gt; and what
[3:27:51] &gt;&gt; and pull out. You defeat the very
[3:27:53] purpose
[3:27:55] &gt;&gt; that you are representing. When you do
[3:27:57] that,
[3:27:58] &gt;&gt; when you are pushing,
[3:28:01] &gt;&gt; you are forcing sir,
[3:28:02] &gt;&gt; you are doing things here and there,
[3:28:05] &gt;&gt; you begin to destroy your purpose.
[3:28:12] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham keeps saying
[3:28:14] don't don't be what you
[3:28:16] [Applause]
[3:28:19] &gt;&gt; sir.
[3:28:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:28:20] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say Christianity is
[3:28:23] not something.
[3:28:25] &gt;&gt; God
[3:28:26] &gt;&gt; is not one you have to do what?
[3:28:28] &gt;&gt; Beg.
[3:28:31] &gt;&gt; Please read with me so we go home.
[3:28:34] &gt;&gt; God is not somebody you have to do what?
[3:28:36] &gt;&gt; Beg
[3:28:36] &gt;&gt; or what?
[3:28:37] &gt;&gt; And cry.
[3:28:38] &gt;&gt; And what?
[3:28:38] &gt;&gt; And plead.
[3:28:39] &gt;&gt; And what?
[3:28:40] &gt;&gt; And fast.
[3:28:40] &gt;&gt; And what?
[3:28:41] &gt;&gt; Starve.
[3:28:41] &gt;&gt; And what?
[3:28:42] &gt;&gt; And everything like that.
[3:28:43] &gt;&gt; Certainly not.
[3:28:47] &gt;&gt; Why you begging?
[3:28:49] Because you didn't know he was there.
[3:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:28:53] &gt;&gt; Why you crying?
[3:28:55] &gt;&gt; You didn't know he was there.
[3:28:57] &gt;&gt; Church,
[3:28:59] &gt;&gt; you are a package.
[3:29:01] Amen.
[3:29:03] &gt;&gt; When God send you in this world,
[3:29:06] &gt;&gt; the number of children you have,
[3:29:08] &gt;&gt; your children,
[3:29:10] &gt;&gt; your clothing, the job you will work,
[3:29:13] &gt;&gt; the car you will buy, the neighborhood
[3:29:16] you will be,
[3:29:18] &gt;&gt; everything is already new.
[3:29:26] And God knew at once in in what season
[3:29:30] &gt;&gt; to send what?
[3:29:34] &gt;&gt; All you have to do
[3:29:36] &gt;&gt; rest,
[3:29:37] &gt;&gt; drink,
[3:29:39] &gt;&gt; push out.
[3:29:40] [Applause]
[3:29:44] &gt;&gt; You can you can go go
[3:29:47] fast the 20 days if you want
[3:29:50] &gt;&gt; if he end the season.
[3:29:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[3:29:53] If it's not the season,
[3:29:55] &gt;&gt; it won't happen.
[3:29:57] &gt;&gt; That's why Pentecostal are struggling.
[3:30:01] &gt;&gt; They fast every week
[3:30:03] &gt;&gt; and tomorrow divorce
[3:30:06] &gt;&gt; and they get confused
[3:30:07] &gt;&gt; because they didn't understand these
[3:30:09] things.
[3:30:11] &gt;&gt; God drop everything in you.
[3:30:15] &gt;&gt; Don't push too hard.
[3:30:17] &gt;&gt; Don't try to get alternative.
[3:30:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to load.
[3:30:22] Everything contrary to the message to
[3:30:24] the word take it away.
[3:30:27] &gt;&gt; Rest calm.
[3:30:29] &gt;&gt; Rest peaceful.
[3:30:30] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[3:30:33] &gt;&gt; If a desire come out
[3:30:36] &gt;&gt; because I have a quote here
[3:30:38] &gt;&gt; where but the Bible say because the
[3:30:39] problem is how do you know it's mine?
[3:30:42] Amen.
[3:30:47] &gt;&gt; For it is God,
[3:30:49] &gt;&gt; not you,
[3:30:50] &gt;&gt; who does what?
[3:30:51] &gt;&gt; Which workketh in you
[3:30:52] &gt;&gt; both what?
[3:30:53] &gt;&gt; To will
[3:30:54] &gt;&gt; and to what?
[3:30:55] &gt;&gt; Do of
[3:30:56] &gt;&gt; according to what?
[3:30:56] &gt;&gt; His good pleasure.
[3:30:57] &gt;&gt; Who bring that desire of squirrel?
[3:31:02] &gt;&gt; Why did he come?
[3:31:05] &gt;&gt; Where was he before? Why do you want to
[3:31:08] live in the in the in the country and
[3:31:10] somebody want to live in the city? You
[3:31:13] can tell him whatever you do. The person
[3:31:15] say no, I like to see trees and nature.
[3:31:17] And the other one say no, I don't want
[3:31:18] to see trees and nature. I want because
[3:31:20] it's in him.
[3:31:22] &gt;&gt; You can't help it.
[3:31:24] [Applause]
[3:31:26] &gt;&gt; Consecrate your life.
[3:31:28] &gt;&gt; Pray. Listen to the message. Keep
[3:31:31] moving.
[3:31:32] &gt;&gt; It will come.
[3:31:34] &gt;&gt; It's a tree with fruit and it depend on
[3:31:37] season. In its own season, it will bring
[3:31:40] us fruit. God bless you. Let's stop
[3:31:43] here.
[3:31:53] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[3:31:56] &gt;&gt; My friend, I lo you too much.

[3:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:32:10] &gt;&gt; If something didn't happen yet, it
[3:32:13] doesn't mean it's not there.
[3:32:17] &gt;&gt; Did you know you're going to be what you
[3:32:18] are today?
[3:32:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:32:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know you're going to be praying
[3:32:22] here?
[3:32:23] &gt;&gt; Look where you are.
[3:32:25] &gt;&gt; Is it the end?
[3:32:27] &gt;&gt; Is it the end?
[3:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:34] &gt;&gt; He was there.
[3:32:37] The one who built this home,
[3:32:39] &gt;&gt; this church built it to build another
[3:32:41] building. He never built it
[3:32:44] because it was not for him.
[3:32:46] [Music]
[3:32:53] &gt;&gt; It was not for him.
[3:32:55] &gt;&gt; It was for another pastor.
[3:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:33:03] &gt;&gt; And every design what you don't
[3:33:06] understand even even the refrigerator
[3:33:10] &gt;&gt; was in us.
[3:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:14] &gt;&gt; If not somebody would have bought it.
[3:33:21] &gt;&gt; He was ordained to be here
[3:33:23] &gt;&gt; and it happened.
[3:33:25] &gt;&gt; If not they would have refused me to
[3:33:27] give me the truck. Right.
[3:33:29] &gt;&gt; But because it's the season
[3:33:32] &gt;&gt; when the truck is reserved
[3:33:34] &gt;&gt; and no truck, the woman say, "Can you
[3:33:37] bring the truck earlier?"
[3:33:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, the track reserved for
[3:33:41] somebody.
[3:33:44] &gt;&gt; Why is he working?
[3:33:46] &gt;&gt; Did I have an accident?
[3:33:48] &gt;&gt; Every demon of accident was sleeping
[3:33:50] &gt;&gt; because it's the season.
[3:33:54] When I was exiting, I was exiting
[3:33:57] slowly. Brother Robert, I have to go 30
[3:33:59] miles because I don't want the
[3:34:02] refrigerator to scratch. And I say,
[3:34:03] "Boy, who taught you how to drive a
[3:34:05] truck?"
[3:34:07] It's the season.
[3:34:09] &gt;&gt; It is the season.
[3:34:14] &gt;&gt; Everything is working together for good
[3:34:17] because it's the season.
[3:34:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know who called me last week?
[3:34:22] Brother said, "Did I tell you the mer
[3:34:24] called me?" He said, "Pastor, do you
[3:34:27] have any other work I can do for you?"
[3:34:29] The mer begin to beg for work.
[3:34:37] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[3:34:39] are approaching you humbly this
[3:34:41] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:34:43] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[3:34:45] everything you have been doing. Father,
[3:34:48] may you reward your children for the
[3:34:50] sacrifice they have done to go extra
[3:34:52] mile beyond the hours, Father, just to
[3:34:55] receive your word.
[3:34:57] Lord, many questions, many frustration,
[3:35:02] many trouble, many sorrow, many anxiety,
[3:35:08] many lack of sleepness
[3:35:10] just because we didn't understand
[3:35:12] certain things. Why did it work? Why
[3:35:16] it's not working? Why is he lingering?
[3:35:19] Why is he working for someone else and
[3:35:20] not me? But father, your word is
[3:35:24] bringing healing. Your word is bringing
[3:35:27] everything. Your word is bringing peace
[3:35:29] and comfort. Your word is bringing
[3:35:32] confidence to let us know that
[3:35:35] everything we have need of even our
[3:35:38] Christian life, we don't have to
[3:35:40] manufacture it. We have to only drink.
[3:35:43] And as we drink, the spirit inside is
[3:35:46] growing and it's pushing out everything
[3:35:50] that you have quickened that you have
[3:35:52] put in our life to be manifested in our
[3:35:55] life. Father, there is nothing that you
[3:35:57] put in our program that would not be
[3:35:59] fulfilled until Lord Father before we
[3:36:02] leave here. And when the time will come
[3:36:04] for us to leave, whether by the way of
[3:36:07] waiting or by the way of the rapture,
[3:36:10] Father, we know that we will fulfill
[3:36:12] your entire program according to your
[3:36:15] good pleasure. Lord, may you take the
[3:36:17] word that has been spoken. May you
[3:36:19] quicken your children and father bring
[3:36:21] more revelation and quicken and
[3:36:23] strengthen our body as we commit this
[3:36:26] oncoming week unto the hand and the
[3:36:28] remaining of the day in the name of
[3:36:30] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you,
[3:36:33] church. We love you.
