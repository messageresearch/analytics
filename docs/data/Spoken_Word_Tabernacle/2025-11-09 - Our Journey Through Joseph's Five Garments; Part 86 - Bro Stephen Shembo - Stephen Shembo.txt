========================================

And I thought, well, I better not do that. I just going to have a little drama of something, a character in the Bible. And thinking here, oh, in serious manners, while we're sitting here as Christians, I suppose most of us, did you know this may be the last time that we'll ever eat breakfast together? Did you ever think of that? Do you realize what little words that I have to say here? God's going to make me answer for it up there at the day of judgment. And I have souls here. No matter if it's a small group, but yet I have it's the words that I say I'll have to answer for them up there. So we may never eat another breakfast together, but I hope we eat a supper together someday. &gt;&gt; That's the last supper up there with him. It'll be the first one there. And then as we sit here this morning and I look upon these men here and some of them great ministers who studied and me here just bushmen come out no education sitting here man is qualified to preach and doctors would have I feel very little to stand talk before man like that but yet I I got to express what I feel and their great gratitude and kindness to let me stand and do this. I appreciate it, brothers, cooperating in the meeting and getting together. I'm here to help you. I'm going to do everything I can for each one of you by the grace of God. And then when it's all over someday, if I don't get to eat breakfast with you again, when it's all over, sitting across the table from one another, [clears throat] that's the time I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; No doubt, but little tears will run down our cheeks and look across the table and get each other by the hand. It'll mean something, man. That's work while it's time to work. Yes. &gt;&gt; While the sun's up, it'll be down after a while. It's getting very low. &gt;&gt; Then to think that while we're sitting there holding each other's hands and weeping a little, &gt;&gt; then the great king will come out and all of his great robes. Come down along the line, wipe all tears away from our eyes, and says, "Well done, my good and faithful servants. Enter into the joys of the Lord has been prepared for you since the foundation of the world. While it's sun's up, it's light enough to labor." Let's labor. Now, this little text here may seem kind of ridiculous, but we're going to talk on this subject. He was to pass this way. It must have been a an awful night on the little fella. He couldn't sleep at all. He just rolled and tossed all night long. It's breaking day and we all know what those restless nights mean. You can't sleep. You got something on your mind. or something's got your nerves all upset. This little fellow was a businessman maybe in a city Jericho which is something like you businessmen and women here and he um he no doubt had a growing business. He stood in good with the all the clubs and so forth and was a member of the church Sanhedrin council and had a fine priest and he believed this priest and the strange thing about this case is his wife we'll call her Rebecca. She had strayed off on the wrong side. He thought so did the priest. She was following a man that was supposed to be a prophet of Nazareth, a man named Jesus with the people, the poor class.

Uh December December the 6, it's the next young man meeting. We have a wonderful young man meeting yesterday. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I wish I'm learning stuff that they are learning, &gt;&gt; but it's too late. I already picked sister Cheron and God was gracious that I picked Sister Sheron. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we had to struggle to find the right one. &gt;&gt; But your job is even easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So yesterday we clear courtship. [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we have to find out why do we need courtship? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. BREAK IT DOWN, PREACHER. BREAK IT DOWN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. Ah [laughter] &gt;&gt; you know you know lack of understanding things is causing us a lot of problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I gave them the three step. Brother Brandham say the first step is courtship and the second step it's uh agreement or engagement and the third step it's marriage and we define but the problem was why do you need courtship? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; Because it's easy. Oh brother Stephen tell us about courtship. Okay you do this. I said before we even get to that, you need to understand why do you need courtship? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, young sisters, you need to get that one. Amen. Why do you need If you know the reason why you need courtship, &gt;&gt; then your courtship is completely different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they got the reason yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there was only one person that didn't get courtship. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. That was Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam never had a courtship. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Adam, they deliver his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The don't [laughter] the wife of Adam was delivered like Amazon. &gt;&gt; And when Adam woke up, &gt;&gt; he didn't even have time to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say that is the difference between me and you &gt;&gt; versus Adam. &gt;&gt; And I gave them a quote. &gt;&gt; I gave them a quote yesterday. They know the quote yesterday. And brother Brandham said, "That's the reason why Adam got in trouble with Eve. Don't swallow that. Uh uh, leave it alone. I got a quote. I gave them the quote. I knew this one is hard for you to swallow." He said because Adam never had a chance to pray. &gt;&gt; I have the quote. They have the code. Then they there all of them are here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on. You the one holding. If you release the amen, then I continue. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the reason why God put you in courtship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say before you do courtship, what do you do? You plan and you do what? &gt;&gt; You pray and you do what? &gt;&gt; Look. &gt;&gt; And you look. They already understand all of it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm not going to tell you everything. You go ask them, they will tell you everything. But they understand why we need a courtship. There is a reason why &gt;&gt; God put a requirement for courtship before engagement. There was a reason why and they know the reason now clearly without any problem with the scripture. We went with the scripture and pull up. Why do you need a courtship? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I told them courtship is the only stage &gt;&gt; father courtship is the only stage &gt;&gt; that you can come out &gt;&gt; without liability. Amen. &gt;&gt; They all I repeated that five time. &gt;&gt; Courtship is the only place you can enter in with a pencil and an eraser. &gt;&gt; Courtship is the only place you can make an error &gt;&gt; and come out without any problem. &gt;&gt; If you cross courtship &gt;&gt; and you get to engagement, you doom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you get in marriage, you are buried. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So courtship is a grace period. &gt;&gt; Okay, I won't even preach what I told them. I'm just giving you load of flavor so parent understand where we were and what we spoke with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother say you need to know the family. I gave them the quote yesterday &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham say you need to know the background &gt;&gt; of the girl and you NEED TO ASK HER. &gt;&gt; I gave them the quote yesterday. They are all here yesterday. &gt;&gt; They were there yesterday. &gt;&gt; And I told them the reason why they need to know the background. I gave an example yesterday. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] I say note uh let's go to our sermon. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Ah so you want to hear their stuff. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I Okay, I'm not going to disclose everything. I told them I say not everybody grew up in the same home. That's right. &gt;&gt; Some grow up Some grow up with both parent present. &gt;&gt; Some grow up with a single parent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some will grow up when parent are message believer &gt;&gt; and some are grow grown into an environment where both parent are not even message believer. &gt;&gt; Are we together? I say so you need to know the background &gt;&gt; of the woman that you're dealing with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that woman came from a single mother home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a woman in the world because we already eliminated it. &gt;&gt; We say your courtship is not with unbelievers. It's not with make believer but the courtship is with believers. &gt;&gt; And Solomon say many women are virtuous &gt;&gt; but you are above all. &gt;&gt; So you need to find the one that is above the virtues. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know why my finger keep going this direction. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I got brother Joshua and uh and the big boss over here. So my finger keep going. So let me go this way a little bit. [laughter] Are we together? Here is brother Angelo and brother Hamilton and then brother Benj I'm loosening you up because something is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say so when when when when you have a daughter uh I mean I mean a child of God filled with the Holy Spirit uh being baptized message believer and then she grew up with uh with her mother alone. I say you need to be very careful &gt;&gt; and you need to know the background because knowing that she grew up with a single mother &gt;&gt; it's important for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't say you need to separate from her, &gt;&gt; but it's preparing you for your future &gt;&gt; if that is your wife. &gt;&gt; I say because if she was the only one, especially if she was the only one &gt;&gt; of that family, &gt;&gt; then you need to be more aware of it. And I told them if I tell this to married people some of them will be crying. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Ah. All right. There is a daughter that is born in the family. &gt;&gt; And if she is the first one, she is daddy's girl. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; You're going to understand me very well. If he is a boy, he's going to be mama's boy. &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand me very well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The boy will go straight to mama and the girl will go straight to daddy. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And it's no more to have a competition between the girl and mama. &gt;&gt; Remember the minute you're taking. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the girl will try to show that daddy belong to him. &gt;&gt; When daddy really belong to mama. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when this little girl is growing up, whenever daddy's coming home, what do you think the girl is coming up? &gt;&gt; She will be running straight to the door before even mommy move. and she will be the one opening her arm and jumping on daddy because daddy is everything to her. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Even if that whenever daddy's coming home, he's thinking about her. &gt;&gt; If daddy need to buy McDonald, he's buying McDonald for her. &gt;&gt; Daddy mind is wrapping around that that young woman right there at home. &gt;&gt; And sometime mommy may get even a little jealous. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And this GIRL IS GROWING UP under daddy. Daddy's favorite. If she wants something, she will not ask mommy &gt;&gt; because mommy will wrestle with her. &gt;&gt; She will go around and talk to daddy because she know how to wrap around daddy and to get whatever she want. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And suddenly at 6 years old a divorce happened. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; I hope we are TOGETHER NOW. NOW MOMMY SEPARATED. &gt;&gt; Daddy goes to the other side. &gt;&gt; Now the daddy that used to be available every day &gt;&gt; is no longer available at home. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now they have to go from one home to another &gt;&gt; and before you know it, daddy goes and get married. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And mommy stayed there with a boyfriend that usually come and help and be handy for the hard stuff at home. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I know where it's sinking. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So suddenly this young girl is growing up with a big void of a masculine spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A BACKGROUND, YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT GIRL IS OPEN up now to a man &gt;&gt; THAT WILL SHOW HIM TRUE LOVE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU COMING AS A young man to marry that woman, remember you are not GOING TO BE JUST A HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. YOU MUST BE A HUSBAND AND A FATHER &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE THE VOID THAT THE WOMAN HAVE. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. This is why I do my surgery with couple like 6 hours or 7 hours. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? BECAUSE SHE HAVE DONE BUILT A COMPLEX AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR A TRUE LOVE &gt;&gt; THAT SHE MISSES FROM her father. &gt;&gt; And if the young man is stupid, &gt;&gt; if he is ignorant &gt;&gt; and doesn't understand the mechanic OF THESE THINGS, &gt;&gt; HE WILL THINK HIS WIFE IS MORE POSSESSIVE. &gt;&gt; But the WIFE IS NOT REALLY POSSESSIVE. THE WIFE IS TRYING to to to TO FILL THE VOID THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SHE CALLS YOU ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SHE WANT YOU TO TOUCH HER ALL THE TIME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING TO RECUPERATE THE VOID THAT HAPPENED BEFORE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY IF EVEN IF YOU WANT to go TO HOME DEPOT, SHE WANT TO GO WITH YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE MISS GOING TO HOME DEPOT WITH HER FATHER. BUT TO YOU, HOME DEPOT IS NOT FOR WOMEN. IT'S FOR MEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HOW MANY CHILDREN DID SARAH HAVE? &gt;&gt; SARAH, the wife of Abraham. How many children did she have? &gt;&gt; What was the name of the baby? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; And uh and THE BIBLE SAY THAT ISAAC WAS THE ONLY ONE. SO HE WAS MAMA'S BOY. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED? SARAH DIED &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY WHEN ISAAC GOT MARRIED TO REBECCA, REBECCA ACTUALLY CAME AND COMFORTED ISAAC FOR HIS MOTHER. &gt;&gt; SO REBECCA HAVE TO BE A WIFE AND A MAMA. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. LEARN THE BACKGROUND OF YOUR WIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD, it's a powerful revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see your wife acting like a child. You don't understand why she's acting like a child. Because she found a man now &gt;&gt; that love him &gt;&gt; and she have to react the way she was acting up with her father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But because you grew up with a mommy and a daddy, you think everybody think like you &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because you grew up with a mother and a father all the time. You don't see the value of both of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the one who miss a mama or a daddy understand the value of it. And you think everybody need to think like you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why you need to know the background of your wife. &gt;&gt; The background of your husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me close right here. the remaining. Go ask the young man. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; I hope it's sinking. I'm giving you time for that to soak in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Know who you dealing with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are Christian. They are still in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; She want all the time me to be with her. She want to talk to me all the time. There is a reason why she's reacting like that. &gt;&gt; The [laughter] seven season. &gt;&gt; I told you if I tell this to all the people, you would know it's going to go. I'm letting the surgery go. &gt;&gt; I don't know who the Lord is talking to visibly or invisible audience. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you keep blaming your husband. You didn't understand the background of your husband. &gt;&gt; And there is a reason why God built you a certain way. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say your wife should be complimentary. That's what I gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So you coming to bring it's not a joke in marriage. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You coming to bring the missing part &gt;&gt; into the marriage. You coming to waken that man right there and to tell him you a man. &gt;&gt; Don't put him down. Build him up. &gt;&gt; Say you a man. &gt;&gt; I know you didn't grow with your father but you a man. &gt;&gt; I believe you a man. &gt;&gt; Waken the LION FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE LION IS THERE. THE LION HAS BEEN DORMANT. JUST AWAKEN THE LION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You grew up with mom and daddy, be grateful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But understand, not everybody grew up like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whoever you get hooked to, be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful how you blabber. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be careful how you talk. You will hurt her deeply &gt;&gt; and you will cause a scar because she's already scarred from six years old, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you think she's childish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's acting up like a child. &gt;&gt; She should be mature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; and before you know it, you turn to be an abuser &gt;&gt; because you didn't understand the void that happened in childhood. &gt;&gt; Maybe mama died. &gt;&gt; Maybe daddy died. &gt;&gt; You need to be careful how you dealing with that individual. &gt;&gt; So be a mama for that person. &gt;&gt; BE A DADDY FOR THAT PERSON &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS GROWING UP WITH A BIG VOID. THEY'RE COMING IN THEIR FAMILY WITH A BIG VOID. AND FINALLY, THE LORD GAVE ME MY SPOUSE. SO FINALLY, I'M GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO SHARE MY BURDEN, who's going to UNDERSTANDING ME, WHO'S GOING TO SUPPORT ME, WHO WILL BE MY FATHER, WHO WILL BE MY DADDY, WHO WILL CORRECT ME, WHO WILL EDUCATE ME. &gt;&gt; Not who's going to put me down &gt;&gt; and say you're supposed to know this.

What do you want? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Courtship part two. &gt;&gt; And I told them I have to talk to you like this because you are men. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big clap offering. [applause] You see when you asking things now I deliver the stuff. You see how you are now responding. &gt;&gt; It's a medication. &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; to cure your marriages. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Don't be too quick to blame. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. Don't be too quick to put down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; If you strong, the strong need to &gt;&gt; lift the feeble. &gt;&gt; Not put down the feeble. &gt;&gt; Know the background. Know the family where she's coming from. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Do you see how many divorces we got in the message? &gt;&gt; A lack of understanding. &gt;&gt; A lack of correct teaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who told you because your wife is 50 years old, she cannot jump a rope? &gt;&gt; Where did you get that? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; You see how you get in trouble? We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I start preaching? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because what I have today is even uh a little bit more tougher because we got to correct things properly in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a scripture that that brother Brandham spoke about it and I say amen, but I didn't understand. And it took me a while until I look it up in the scripture and the Holy Spirit showed to me right there. I say, "Oh my god, I see why brother Brandham says that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it goes into different realm and it causes problem in the message. &gt;&gt; So let's go in and dig in. So married couple meeting part 8 in December the 13th we will talk about finances. Have I forgotten anything? Brother Tony flight attendant prepare for takeoff. Let's stand for the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; I already preached the message. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I seen courtship in a way I never seen courtship before. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Why do you need a courtship? &gt;&gt; Why?

[laughter] &gt;&gt; Prone to do what? &gt;&gt; Run from work. &gt;&gt; When work is divine. &gt;&gt; But some people want to dodge work. &gt;&gt; They don't want to work. &gt;&gt; They want to sit watching TV &gt;&gt; and sticking on food stamp. I hope we together. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the government NOW IS SHAKING FOOD STAMP. &gt;&gt; $1,300 in food &gt;&gt; and you think you prospering. YOU'RE NOT PROSPERING. You are staying underdeveloped &gt;&gt; because of footstep. &gt;&gt; And to keep it either you need to have a lot of babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you need to tell a lie. &gt;&gt; SHAKE YOURSELF FROM FOOD STAMP. &gt;&gt; INCREASE YOUR INCOME. BUDGET YOUR FOOD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOUR FOOD IS COMING FROM YOUR PAYCHECK, &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T SPEND AS MUCH FOOD AS YOU SPENDING ON A FOOD STAMP. &gt;&gt; IF THEY TELL YOU GO BUY YOUR FOOD for your paycheck, YOU WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT you need to pick. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU BUYING FOOD FROM A FOOD STAMP, YOU COLLECT ALL KIND OF GARBAGE.

WE ARE WELCOMING JESUS INSIDE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT KEEPING CHRIST. WE GIVE GOD FIRST. WE ARE SEEKING FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD. THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS ADDED BY JESUS. &gt;&gt; IT IS JESUS THE KINGDOM THAT IS BRINGING US EVERYTHING. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAY I AM THE LORD THAT GIVE YOU POWER TO GET WEALTH. IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR BIBLE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, RAISE YOUR HAND. &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture. &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture. &gt;&gt; Keep your finger here. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Deuteronomy 8. &gt;&gt; I have to push this scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need healing in a millennium.

HE MADE A WAY. &gt;&gt; WHEN I WON, MY BACK WAS AGAINST THE WALL. HE MADE A WAY. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; We're going to shake those demon away from this place. &gt;&gt; We can live a decent LIFE AND BE CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; BE LIKE BROTHER BURCH. &gt;&gt; BE LIKE A JOB. BE LIKE A JOHN SHAR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Deuteronomy 8:18. Let's go because some of you didn't know. &gt;&gt; I want to say this because I don't want you to say my pastor said, "BUT YOU SHALL DO WHAT?" &gt;&gt; Remember the Lord &gt;&gt; your God for IT IS HE &gt;&gt; THAT DO WHAT? giveth thee power &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; To get wealth. &gt;&gt; DID YOU VERIFY THAT? &gt;&gt; IT IS THE LORD THAT GIVE YOU POWER TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; TO GET WEALTH. &gt;&gt; SO OUR WEALTH IS NOT COMING FROM A MAN. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; OUR WEALTH IS COMING FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS EVERYTHING FOR US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GOD THAT GIVE US THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD THAT GIVE US DIVINE HEALING.

Forget about uh Elon Musk and whatever you think over there. Uhuh. We talking about the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's a prosperity to our spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Prosperity to our health, &gt;&gt; prosperity to our finances, prosperity to our marriages, PROSPERITY TO OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL, PROSPERITY TO OUR GRANDCHILDREN, &gt;&gt; PROSPERITY TO OUR FAMILIES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S THE SON OF PROSPERITY. NOT THE PROSPERITY OF LAISHA &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S A PERVERSION. &gt;&gt; There must be an original one. &gt;&gt; SO WE ARE BRINGING YOU TO THE ORIGINAL ONE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DEVIL BRING STUFF AND we think no this is our daily trial. &gt;&gt; Your daily trial have been going on for a long time. &gt;&gt; Since since you were young, it's still a daily trial. They got to have an ending to that daily trial. &gt;&gt; You got TO BREAK THE CIRCLE OF YOUR FAMILY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU A DIFFERENT BREED &gt;&gt; UNDER A DIFFERENT FAMILY. THE BREED OF MECHISEDC, &gt;&gt; A DIFFERENT FAMILY LINE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY AUNT. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER. BUT AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE STUDYING SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; IF PEOPLE DIVORCE, SO ME I HAVE TO DIVORCE. NO, &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DIVORCE. THE DEVIL MUST HAVE A DIFFERENT TUNE. &gt;&gt; THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; NOT HERE. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THIS SIDE is a little bit colder.

CAN YOU READ IT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IS DIFFERENT GIFT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS A GIFT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A DIFFERENT GIFT. BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT GIFT. A GIFT OF RICHES AND WEALTH AND THE ABILITY TO ENJOY IT. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IN OTHER WORD, MY GOD BLESS ME WITH A JOB &gt;&gt; AND I THANK HIM FOR IT. AND WHEN I GET MONEY FROM THAT JOB, I BUY A HOUSE AND I THANK GOD FOR IT. AND I BUY [screaming] A CAR AND I THANK GOD FOR IT. AND WHEN I'M DRIVING THAT CAR, I'M LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, PRAISING GOD FOR THE CAR HE HAS GIVEN ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[applause] YOU DIDN'T GET THAT WELL. &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH WILL LIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; NEVER LIVE HIGHER. &gt;&gt; NOTHING HIGHER THAN WHAT &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR TEACHES. &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT TO RAISE THE STANDARD.

I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. [laughter] &gt;&gt; When I was uh in college, we study small like this. You get a test. You can memorize even the book. &gt;&gt; You can memorize the book. &gt;&gt; No problem. &gt;&gt; When I get to dental school, it was a different game. &gt;&gt; What we study for the final in the in the college, &gt;&gt; it was for one week. The whole semester in college is taught in one week. [applause] &gt;&gt; On Monday a 100 slat. &gt;&gt; On Wednesday they add 60 slat. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; On Friday they add 87 slide. &gt;&gt; So you know how many sl you already have for one week but the test is not yet. The test is in two month. &gt;&gt; That's one course and you have eight classes that are coming up like that. &gt;&gt; So you sit down you say how do you study this now? Before you know it, you find yourself studying everything and being on top of it. &gt;&gt; What happened? Your nerve have opened up. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I learned that in school. Your nerve open up. The more they push, the more the demand is, the more you develop. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And what you were not using to to do used to do two months ago, you can begin to do it because they put you in the mir. Because if they don't put you in that mode, you will never perform the same way. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? And you think the devil is pushing, is pushing, is pushing. It is God trying to wake you up. &gt;&gt; AND SAY YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU THINK. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU THINK. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU THINK. UNTIL ONE DAY, YOU WILL WAKE UP LIKE A SHAM. YES SIR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SOME GUY WOKE UP, HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ONE MAN AGAINST 600. HE FORGOT ABOUT WHO HE WAS AND HE TACKLED 600 PEOPLE AND BEAT THEM ALL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. THE CONTROL IS NOT TO BLOCK YOUR LIBERTY. IT IS TO REFOCUS YOUR ENERGY AND TO BRING YOU TO THE RIGHT PATH SO YOU CAN DEVELOP AND PRODUCE MORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS NO PRESSURE, NO [screaming] PRODUCTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

And when you push to desperation, the best of you come up. &gt;&gt; And when they get the best of you come up, you begin to outperform everything you and you will realize that you multitasker &gt;&gt; and you thought you were not multitasking because there is no pressure that is put upon you. The energy is going far left. You wasting energy. There is nobody to channel your energy. You wasting time. You wasting energy and everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? Because there is no structure. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a question yesterday with the young man. They say, "What about somebody who's a senior &gt;&gt; in college?" I said, "The one who's in a senior already should be thinking about working." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who's a senior is already his mind is not in senior. &gt;&gt; His mind already left the college. Your mind cannot be in college again. You a senior. In other words, they're going to kick you out sooner. You're not even in college. You already in the workforce. &gt;&gt; And not only are you in the workforce, you already looking at going out to leaving your parent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. LEAVING YOUR PARENT TO FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TO an apartment. Shoot for a house. Young people, young folks, &gt;&gt; young men, young men, I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY, "I'M LEAVING FOR AN APARTMENT." USE YOUR TIME IN YOUR FATHER HOME. SO WHEN YOU LEAVE, JUMP INTO A CONDOMINION OR OR A HOUSE, &gt;&gt; SOMETHING YOU OWN YOURSELF, NOT GIVE MONEY TO SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU BEGIN TO BRING THOSE PRESSURE ON YOURSELF, YOUR ENERGY IS DIFFERENT. YOU SAY WHEN I GRADUATED FROM NOW TODAY, FROM 2 YEARS FROM NOW, I NEED TO GET MARRIED. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me young man. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET ME YOUNG MAN. YOU DON'T SIT DOWN. YOU SAY, "NO, NO, WHEN I GRADUATED, THEN I'M going to find a job. Then after I find a job, then I need to save money." No, there is no pressure. &gt;&gt; When I graduate, I have two years from now. When I'm going to graduate it, I need to make sure I save money and I need to start quoting a lady. I've been praying. I know her who she is. If everything work, if everything work, if everything work from today TO 7 MONTHS, I NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS AND THE NEXT YEAR I NEED TO GET MARRIED. &gt;&gt; SO IN YOUR MIND, YOU ALREADY WIRED. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TALKING, YOU DON'T TALK TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

You will say, &gt;&gt; "What is meeting?" Young people meeting. &gt;&gt; I'm already grown up. I'm listening. I have the Holy Ghost. This is time to put everything together. Give me the link. &gt;&gt; What about that meeting? No. No. You need to get a fly. You need to book the hotel.

[cheering] &gt;&gt; My people lack of vision. It's lack of restraint. In other words, YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO keep you on the highway. &gt;&gt; When they put a sign, McDonald, you out exit. WHEN THEY PUT A SIGN, CHICK-FIL-A, YOU EXIT. BUT THE ONE WHO IS WIRED, &gt;&gt; YOU SEE CHICK-FIL-A, it's not there. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE MCDONALD, MCDONALD DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE I'M GOING SOMEWHERE.

He bought idolatry &gt;&gt; in Israel and cause even two tribe &gt;&gt; to be removed from the book of life. It's written in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Because they didn't they remove the restraint. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's your portion to eat. It's your portion to drink.
