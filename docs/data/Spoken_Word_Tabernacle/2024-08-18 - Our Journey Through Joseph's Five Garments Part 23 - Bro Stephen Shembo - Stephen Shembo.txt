this is a after what we heard last week uh um and when I heard that message last week this has been burning in my heart uh because this is a offensive testimony the devil has put a what we call cancer on my wife breast cancer and he's also put U aib on her and um couple weeks ago we were talking about this and uh I told her I said you know uh when this happened in with brother Brandon and sister ma when she got that cancer and I told her I says we're all rhabs because Rahab was not there to witness what took place in Egypt she may not have even been born yet um and uh what took place of the and I was telling my wife this and I said you know we weren't there when that happened with sister ma but when we listen to those tapes and we hear the testimonies from other believers that were in that prophet's message we believe it even though we didn't see those things we still believe it and I was telling her this and then brother Nikki shik he came over from South Africa and uh going to preach at a different couple places after the camp meeting and um and we were trying to set up a time for him to get up to brother Darren kiner's in Gaya Virginia and um him and I were playing phone tag and we finally got to talk and we were just talking and he starts tell telling me this story about a bull of his that had gotten out of the pasture and he said he was running all over this pasture trying to catch his Bull and he said I got out of breath and he said I just stopped I pointed my finger at that bull and I told him to go home and he said he said that bull turned around went up under the fence and went home and as he's telling me this story I'm thinking of what I just told my wife a few days before about sister Ma and the same scenario with brother brandham and the bull in the field and it just I'm just I'm just bubbling inside when he's telling me this you know and uh and and I told my wife says that thing before the doctor lays a hand on you it's going to be gone [Applause] so Hallelujah Glory that's how you do it amen now I forget about it oh yes ma'am yes ma'am sure it I was to hold it but that was my signal to I went to the doctor on Tuesday for my father check from the

bless what a wonderful singing sister gift that's prophetic if you listen closely to the song are they have been sung you will already understand the oncoming sermon because they already tell you these folks stay at home and stay under the anointing of the Holy Spirit until they catch the mind of the spirit and say this is what we will be singing there is a lot of song Why did Brother John choose certain song and then didn't get the other one because there is something gearing him we believe in a holy spirit on the pulit the Holy Spirit on the congregation the Holy Spirit on the Deacon the holy spirit in every offices so we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience if there is any family member here we do not have visitors family member first time or second time God richly bless you and we trust this will be a blessing to you if you don't mind let me go quickly to my announcement I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon my interpreter is [Applause] here you see devil that you keep wasting your time now we got a test morning say Amen my brother amen ah you heard [Laughter] him so we are back on track amen glory to God so I believe we're reading our C our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel seals adoption or somebody's listening to the message of the hour our question and answer will be on August the 24th there was one question that was sent to me and I believe you follow that in the chart the virtual question and answer I gave you all the scripture all the quote and many there are many quote more than that so I believe that is good enough to solve the matter if you are not convinced yet so contact me and I keep pumping until we get you really stabilized amen amen amen there is many Cote brother Bram say there is a woman with a with a blue blue heart there's a woman with a green heart and things like that but the difference I believe you can make it clear before I mean between Sport and a normal woman decorative attire whatever but your hair was given to you for your covering amen this church sometime it's hard to get in the between and bellance swing up but praise God for the holy spirit amen young Sisters Meeting on September the 21st Young's men followup meeting will be to be announced I'm waiting on brother Enoch to work on that and Lord's willing the merried couple meeting is on September 7 I got really good questions they're really yummy questions really yummy and spicy question and he help and I appreciate each one everyone that put those question because he helped me gauge where we going and then from there on we will SAR I don't think it would take one service to handle this type of stuff we need to go one two 3 four and then continue until we clear every Arena because the the the study of a soul is very delicate and it's dangerous and it's where everything is laying right there the only one who clearly enter into that domain is brother brandham but we don't preach about it too much and people are confused you know why you might be seated a little bit and people are confused amen so sometime we cast out Devils where there is no Devils it's just a soulle issue amen and you keep praying and casting out devil there is no devil there you just need to understand how the body operate sometime your genetics can be carrying already something for you right and it's waiting for a trouble if you trouble so much somebody the genetic kick in he lays dormant it's like a curse that is like a strin in a family that goes like a curse you don't know this stuff you don't know this stuff as long under normal condition of temperature and pressure sleep that stuff will remain quiet if you start putting pressure you awaken that demon and before you know up you're going to deal with something so when we say courtship you need to know who you're dealing with it is not sitting and talking about you the best beautiful flower in the world you need to know what you're dealing with was my wife from a uh Christian family oh was my wife for a non-Christian family did my wife grew up as a single with mom as a single mother yes sir or did my wife grw up with daddy with a stepmother if you don't understand all of those stuff and you just get the package good luck there is no demon you just did not understand it's amazing how ignorant we are in this message because we don't want to stay with the prophet amen and we act like Pentecostal demon demon demon you've been casting that devil for 20 years why is that devil now going you cast it he keep coming you cast it he keep you need to push the break is he really a demon amen how can a candy cast Devils I have the quot my friend I gave you that quot before right how can a candy cast a devil and the brother and the brother was chasing devils upon his wife you don't know this you don't know this stuff how many knows that c oh my God okay randu at the Merit meting amen the brother was chasing our devil in Jesus name in Jesus brother BR look he say you doing that the wrong way so brother Bram what should I do oh Oh Glory to God give me that formula but R I'm say get a box of candy does candy have a virtue to cast our Devils what is brother BR I'm saying women have three virtue virginity maternity Womanhood good what does he mean you getting married what do those virtue me because one virtue will go before you but not before God don't worry let's go back to our scripture my friend [Laughter] H what I'm stirring you up is when you listening to this message don't don't don't read the message like a newspaper don't read the Bible like a newspaper push the break and say what is brother Bram saying you say Lord what are you trying to say through this Prophet what is is he telling a story what is this Prophet saying if you begin to push the break and to go slowly you will understand that this message is deeper than what we think amen amen sometime you look at certain quot you shake your head you say wow I never knew brother brandham speak something like this and it's right there laying right there and sometime you read it before but you miss something and before you know it casting out Devils casting out Devils casting out devil casting out devil ah so your prayer doesn't work your protective prayer when you say God protect my family under the blood the devil still getting so you don't have faith in your prayer so when something happened oh it's the devil uhh what is your prayer doing if you're hungry do you have a headache can you say Amen when you hungry do you have a headache is that a demon what do we how do we okay find somebody who's hungry and you come you say brother you have a headache let's pray in Jesus name headache leave did you check the source of headache before you administer the medication [Applause] do you understand what I'm saying do you understand what I'm saying back in the day brother Glenn I'm home back in the day brother Glenn when we grew up when you take a car to the shop the mechanic will pull down everything maybe it's uh what do you call it what what can I get trans transmission or whatever the mechanic will take the transmission out and fix it and put it back again and the car move that was back in the day so you can bring a car to a true mechanic he will just listen to the son and say this is this today they don't work like that if something is broke do you know what they do they tell you give us two days yeah they get a new one remove the other one swap it so mechanic today are just swapping Parts preachers [Music] today are just swapping Parts I don't know if you get what I'm saying our ministry is not a Pentecostal Ministry it is not a meod this ministry Pentecost will put prayer line and cast our Devils whether you repent or not and the person goes and the demon come back again brother BR Ministry is not like that when you bring somebody to the prayer line brother BR must find out what caused this [Music] [Applause] problem in other word the method we should use in the message said is first find what is the [Applause] problem when you go to the root of the problem then you can solve it once for all oh we take pleasure on people calling me pray for me pray for me pray for me pray for me no no I pray for you 11 times no no we need to sit down why is this demon keep coming on you is there a demon did I make myself clear amen amen so when you have a headache is that headache a demon or is that headache an alarm hallu Lord have mercy do you understand what I'm saying if it's a demon we pray but sometime it's not a demon it's probably you have not slept [Music] enough all you need to do is go to sleep and you wake up and the demon your demon is gone all the problem you have in marriage is that demon it was just a trailer is that really demon women are complicated are they complicated or you never understood that world are men really complicated oh you never understood how that world operate are men complicated are women if I if I say men complicated the women will say yes if I talk to the men I say are women complicated they say oh brother Sten of course yes so who's complicated when in the beginning God created man and and marry them you want to get married young folks you want to get [Laughter] [Applause] married amen amen you are taking an entity from their home oh I love her you do you really love her I want to leave my father and my brother do you know what you're doing to go with this man yes I love him to death good luck come on that's why brother Bram say you want to get married look at the family you marry why is brother Bram saying what is brother Bram saying 20% and 80% let's stand for the reading of the scripture somebody's like man of course if you don't understand the the the way God built you you will suffer a lot Amen brother Bram say God never created us to be Angel that's why you will never be comfortable in the sixth dimension even though the sixth Dimension is sublim before you enter there only perfect love but those that are there still feel like they want to go back home they need to come back to the Earth they feel like okay we hear everything is good but this is not the way we were supposed to be we missing a part so to be in peace in this world you need to understand the physical part and the spiritual part the danger is when we go in church we go too much on the spiritual and we are neglecting the physical and the body is just waiting for you as soon as you leave church he say I'm still with you where is your fight coming from how can I was asking somebody a question a woman goes to the hospital they give her a hormone shot and he bring a demon and the demon make her walk like a snake I mean go like a snake so was where was that demon in the sh where where did that so so Shir give people demon what kind the demon that only with amen so you should be happy in home you should be happy in your [Music] marriages even though you not in heaven but you should be happy now I will show you a quote if I can get to that oh Lord Jesus Christ the day we going to get to heaven the day we going to get together you will regret this is a different language I'm sorry butth you will understand me better by and by my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 23 I will give you thems down the road when I get an opening on my schedule let's go to Psalm 82 have you noticed parent when you had a baby and it feels like your life have changed yes sir the baby's waking up at night crying at 2: a.m. in the morning and it looks like this Troublemaker came and then he's flipping everything upside down have you noticed that yes then have you ever noticed 10 years later when you are home mama and you fixing uh your room and a picture drop and you look and it's your baby you're 10 years old when he was a baby and when you look do you know what comes back it's like oh I wish I can go back and carry that baby over again when that baby was there it was [Music] trouble true but when the time is gone you want to go back to hold that baby that's why we love grandchildren you don't understand because whatever you were missing now that you are retired you want to catch up on that now now the full love is going to the grandchildren because you did it enjoy at the present time you didn't learn how to work with the baby even though the baby is crying but you can still enjoy the [Music] baby but at that time let them get to school before you know oh oh kids here kids here let them get married and all your house is empty you stay back again you and your wife then you begin to remember when they were claming over there and then jumping and then this one pull a water on the on the ground it becom sweet memories but when they were doing that it was not sweet memory what I'm saying is now your wife and your husband are trouble later on you will appreciate you say I wish I took my time when we were 27 years in marriage I wish I would have done this to my wife but you spend time on the boxing ring tag of War trying to show who has power good luck married people release the pastor Psalm [Laughter] 82 amen amen amen amen you look at your hair today you say my hair my hair wait when you get white hair gray hair then you begin to look at your old picture you say hey I look good of course when you were looking good you didn't see yourself looking good have I solved most of your problem already have we solved most of the problem that's why brother Bram say man always see what was in the past what will be in the future but always missing what is happening at the present time always for tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow do you see how we work for retirement we even PL of it so our momentum now is and before you look your shoulder begin to hurt get that steak with her teeth you will regret the time that you had teeth and you will oh sorry you will regret the time that you were younger Psalm 82 verse1 it's a pastorial message my friend amen we need to fix our marriages my friend amen amen yeah we need to fix our marriages if you have a PhD in marriages thank you very much congratulation but I know you need work Psalm 82 verse1 God does what stand it in the congregation of the you might be seated and he judges not end there is no end I'm the one saying end he judges among the who the gods let's pray so we can clim this quickly Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as much as I can do with the ability that you have given me but Lord father when it comes to speaking and blessing your children he only take the operation of the spirit of the Lord may you be the one Speaking the one hearing and interpreting your word may you come down and bless us and remove every demonic Lord father aspect from the world of Darkness may you remove them completely out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen the Bible says he judges among the gods we know who is Gods now amen amen it's already here praise God oh my God glory to God somebody kept this made my life easy the prayer of Jesus Christ always answer amen all right let's go here okay let's keep this one praise God all right amen job to verse 6 I have said ye are God who saying that God so to awaken God it takes who only God can wake God up only God Only God Amen can bring the Awakening amen if God have not talked to you yet you won't know that you are God we clear we clear when somebody tells you you God it's different but the day God will tell you you God M Men of Valor Gideon then it's a different story in other word the time has come the hour have arrived that you need to know certain stuff amen he says I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of who the most high you know what the most high means but ye shall die like men we found out that these people are Gods amen but they dying like men they are Gods amen dying amen like men amen so it means that these gods are men they we clear when they say man it doesn't take the woman away are we together when the Bible uses the masculine amen it doesn't mean sister are not here are we together because when God created man he created men how male and female so when we say men the woman are included are we together are we together that's why in the sixth Dimension when they call Brother Bram his wife came with him sir are we together so when they say man it's both male and female amen so these gods are dying in other words these gods are mortal are we together sir but whatever happened here doesn't change the fact that they are God are we together hence we found out that these people these species are gods and they are also human amen the problem is how to make a difference between the two are we together so verse uh 6 and seven but you shall die like men and fall like one of the what the princes therefore fall the fall of this God Amen are like what one of the princess are we together amen they dying like men means that they are men yeah are we together they falling like princess in other words when they fall if you look at them they are falling like princes in other words these gods are princess it was a Short scripture every Sunday we take a chunk am let me go back again the Bible say ye are God and you die like men so these gods are men they are mortal and he say when they fall they fall like a priest and again here it's a masculine used here ah William Mar Bram brother Bram say people try to things well I'm what a Christian I guess I shall have to be doged around no you don't no sir you are a Christian brother that is a high you are a what a Son of God our father is is what [Applause] king our father is what king certainly what amen and our father being King we are what his son we are what Prince and what and Princess the congregation must say what we are PR and princes Amen to a wife King the highest there is uhhuh highest can be uhhuh the very Spirit of our God is where in us that's it amen so when you look at this God when they fall they fall like a princess why why why they didn't fall like a farmer why they didn't fall like a doctor the Bible say when they fall they fall like a princes in other word if therefore if you go see them they are princes [Laughter] ah Daniel 9 verse 25 now therefore and understand know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build what Jerusalem unto the Messiah their prince your big brother is a PRI remember the big fellow that's why he's not ashamed to be called your brother the Big Brother the Messiah himself is a priest that's why your fall is like the fall of a priest I hope we getting this it's a hard material my friend he says here in act three and killed the who the Prince of Life whom God has raised from the dead when of we are what Witnesses the god of our father rais up who Jesus whom he slew and did what hang on a tree him has God exalted with his right hand to be a what a prince your God is a priest your father is not just a king he is also a priest that's why when you fall you fall like one of the Priestess let me help somebody I thought we can come up this airport quickly in Genesis 32:28 the Bible say he said that name shall be called what no more Jacob but what Israel for as a a prince Jacob was a professional liar yes and a Prof and a professional cheer but when he overcame [Music] God is that a different language Jacob H God until God didn't know what to do with him amen the Bible say it's right here yes let me read Because when you say some certain stuff is trouble but Israel for as a prince has thou what power with who God and what with man and has done what Prevail so when Jacob overcome they call him a priest Israel means a priest and brother Bram say Israel is God Redemptive name so we are princess that's why when they change the name of SAR to Sarah brother Bram say Sarah means princess are we together are we together are we together so when you fall like Jacob when you overcome with God then Jacob name change do you think the name of Jacob the name of Israel God did not know that name before God knew the name before but he was not revealed to Jacob yet until he messed up when he messed up and he and he overcame with God then his true name not the name that they gave him because Jacob they give him a name by his family because of the way he was was coming holding the the what heill they thought he was in the position of uh of a hill but he holding the hill was as a result of a fight he wanted to get the be he wanted to be first re Rebecca went to God and asked God he said this PR this pregnancy have a trouble God say it's no trouble it's two Nation fighting are we together so when Jacob is coming up he's holding the heel and they look at him they say you the bad one and then he begin to grow up with that bad name and manifest the characteristic of that bad name given in the family and Esau was called a good guy but God say I hate Esau I love Jacob not I love Israel I love that [Applause] Che do you follow me I love that Che right there they say but he's a supp he said that's the one I like and when the che overcame God are we together God open up his new name because he was looking for blessing you must bless me you must bless me God said you don't need a blessing you already got the blessing what you need is a change of name you need to realize that you are a prince amen your fall is like the fall of one of the PRI are we together have I lost you praise God let's go to Luke 15 your fa is like one of the princes so you are a prince amen even though they call you Jacob amen amen amen amen when they changed Sarah's name she got pregnant and she also received a body change ah Luke 15 very familiar story glory to God verse uh 11 very familiar and he said a certain man has what two sons you know that already and so I'm going to go quickly and a younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of the goods that fall to me in other word give me my inheritance amen amen and he divided to them his living and not many days after the young son the younger son gather all together he got all his money and took his journey into a far country there is a lot of stuff laying here if we ever try to touch this we won't move so suffer me to move amen and took his journey into a far country the trumpets are here all these things are laying over here okay and they went and there wasted his substance with a riotous living amen amen so somebody become a sinner this younger child not the oldest one the younger one the younger one move the younger one moved to a far away country amen where Mommy doesn't see him daddy doesn't see him nobody have to tell him when to come what to do over there amen because before he left he asked for his inheritance he was showing already that he had a problem with his heart amen amen he had sin in his heart goly listen to the message the prodal amen but sin could not be expressed in the presence of the father can you put your seat belt put your seat belt sin cannot be displayed in the country of the father he need to go to a far away country he need to condescend from a position of a son amen he need to go to a far away country in this country the true nature of sin was expressed or revealed was expressed or revealed not partially fully he really enjoyed sin until the substance of the father run out are we together are we together are we together the potential given to the father run out we okay brother Bram brother Bram said notice both Jesus speaking this Parable he was trying to express the what the feeling of a father to the what lost now let's clim up spiritually to those who were how alienated from God gone out remember one time we were all alienated cut off from God without Mercy without hope walking about in the world of what Darkness how lost forever Jesus taken our place as a sinner and died in our stad and the father receive us how gladly since the son has become the what the sinner how marvelous amen is the gospel my friend so remove the father put God remove the son put yourself we okay now we okay now we okay now you are in heaven in heaven you could not be a sinner you have to take a journey to a far away country over there you express your sinful attribute to the full some smoke some drunk some did all kind of stuff until you thought that was you Lord let's push the break my friend this lesson is very difficult and the devil will fight you to get it amen but God will also fight for you so you will get it I cannot stop at the Devil because I'm going to give him power I have to give him something back am amen amen amen amen ah verse 12 and the young oh verse 13 and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into what a far country and there he did what wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had span how all There Rose a what a mighty famine in that land that famine never happened until he exp he spended all as long as the manone was there no fine only when the resources are gone famine comes to do what this might be hard for you

way to the lowest State Elijah in church Elijah on a mad P you remember that you remember that you remember that Sunday you remember but but he's still Elijah let's continue my friend amen amen and then he would F have filled his belly with the husk that the swan did eat and no man did what gave unto him and when he came to what himself hallelujah amen for you to come into yourself it means that you lost your mind it means that you lost your identity it means that you fall under Amia in other word you are out of yourself you need to come back to yourself amen are we together amen do you follow me amen do you follow me amen so the circumstances this boy suffered in this foreign land amen made him lose his [Music] identity this boy built complex that's right that's right that's right if you call him you say you're a good boy what will he say if he's honest I'm not why I was with the prostitute I was drinking I was that I was that the iny he came with from the foreign land amen is completely lost in this land and he continue until he lost his mind don't even realize that hey I'm a Hebrew now I'm meeting with the Swan now he begin even to desire the think of the Swan amen amen

let's continue a little bit we we okay verse uh 17 and then he came to himself and he said how many what hired servants follow me carefully I thought I'm going to go quickly but it's not follow me carefully when this son got to the lowest State that's right amen amen he begin to Envy the POS position of a servant are we okay are we okay he remember that in his father every home everything is good but when he think about his father his focus is more on the servant so his condition in the far away country amen made him esteem the servant more than himself are we together amen the Bible says

let's listen to this child and we say to him do what father I have what sinned against heaven and what before thee and I am no more what worthy to be called thy son stop he's Desiring the position of who Angels the servant the servant are eating full so he lower himself he say I'm going to tell Daddy I sin against you and I am not worthy to be called your in other word in his man he lost his sunship his don't try to be more righteous than God that's why somebody was giving TX more than 10% brother Bram say give 10% don't be don't be don't try to exaggerate be you you m I'm stupid I'm St ah are you the first one to mess up did you see Adam calling himself I'm stupid Hey Moses killed somebody all right all right he says when I go to the father I have something to tell him I'm coming here no more as your child I have a question what made him worthy to be a son what made him worthy to be a son to begin with what did he do to say I am worthy to be a son what did he do so why do you know what you are not worthy of what you worthy of you didn't control that so how can you control what you are worthy us so when he was born and a baby he came out he said Daddy I'm worthy I'm worthy who made you worthy to be the son so who if you didn't make yourself worthy do you think you can make yourself a worthy hallah you don't when I say worthy you don't understand what I means In Heaven There was a book now you taking me again on the side there was one sitting on the throne amen with a book of his hand the Bible say no one was what to do what in what in the heaven and where on the earth and where the so no one was who wor to take the book and even to break the score and the only one Worthy is the of the tribe of what Judah but I have a news for you you who have a problem with your worthiness in Revelation [Applause] 10 in Revelation 5 there was only one person who was worthy to touch the book but in Revelation 10 the mighty angel came down with the [Music] and a voice told John go over there and go get the book John are you ready are you worthy in other word you are worthy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me do you know what John did do you know what John did Angel give me the book do you know what the angel say if I give you you don't understand who you are the one who's worthy come and take the book you take the book [Applause] in other word there are two people that are worthy it is Jesus and John and John is the type of the pride the husband and wife are I am not worthy I am not worthy [Music] Hallelujah do you know why he's saying I'm not worthy this is where I'm trying to get but I can't even move do you know why he's saying I'm not worthy because he have se he have a ccul and every time he look at the curriculum V he says I cannot reach that level but I'm going to show you if I can get where I'm going to get what will happen to your curriculum where are we at my friend verse 19 verse 19 and I'm no more worthy to be what thy son make me as one of your what HED servants ah you don't even know your father because if you know your father do you think your father will make you as the higher servant so this condition made this son even lose the true perception of his own father he's looking at father as a Punisher when he approaches the father he's waiting for judgment so he's self inflicting himself judgment already H let me make myself look bad already because over there they will kill me amen amen amen and he arose and came to his father but I love that when he saw him yet what a man who a man who was eating with the swan did he have time to shave no was his clothing looking good how did he look and he was far away but the father could look at all those conditions and recognize [Applause] [Music] him oh God in other word when the father is looking the father doesn't see the the unshaved build he doesn't see the bad hair he doesn't see the bad stuff this the father is just looking at him and he said that's my son that's why God say ye are God Amen am [Applause] hallu hallelujah amen hallelujah we good listen my friend where are we at my friend verse 20 he rose he came to his father but he was yet where a great way off way off how can you see that amen and as a matter of fact what was the father doing there what was he doing there how did he match the day he's coming the father is waiting it was time the hour has come yes amen amen amen amen ah he look a great way off his father did what saw him and was angry no abely not the father was how had compassion the father was how had compassion compassion on a criminal Amen on the one that messed up the one that made me sell a portion of my stuff amen amen he said he had compassion and did what and ran and what and fell on his neck and did what and kissed him you continue with the remaining up to verse uh 21 and the son said to him father continue I have sinned against heaven uhhuh and in thy sight uh-huh and am no more worthy to be called thy son stop a little bit did the father say something amen whatever the father have just expressed to to him he missed it I don't know if I will finish this scripture my friend the father run and hug him and kiss him what was the father saying but his mindset is too strong his complex is too strong he doesn't see what the dad is explaining he's only is looking at his own righteousness he need to be punished do you understand who your father is brother Bram said this story is about God and the lost so so one is is unveiling his love and the one to him to whom the love is unveil doesn't see love he's still looking for punishment when are you going to stuck me dead because of everything I did I'm waiting for judgment would did you approach the throne of judgment did you approach the throne of judgment so he missed the expression of the father brother said that kiss remove his sin that's what brother said they kiss he said he kiss his sin away [Music] Hallelujah so he SE that let me ask you normally follow me follow me huh normally if we got a problem between me and brother Benjamin we can't laugh if we honest if we laugh we sometime hypocrite and there is a bunch of them in this message feel in this message if you angry be angry yeah you said brother I didn't like the way you treat me do you follow me amen so we got to fix our problem and after we finish fixing then we can H amen amen do you follow me amen do you follow me amen so the hugging means the imity is finished amen so when the prodal son is coming Daddy run and hug him and kiss him in other word your problem is finished but the child have not caught Redemption yet father help me up I don't know which expression I can use brother Zach can I use your your s this son is coming with a luggage do you see where he sto do you see where he stop do you see where he stop you can't go no more father let it [Applause] go let it go the father is coming and say hey good to see you you don't have any luggage and the child is still I se towards you and I'm not worthy to be it in other when Daddy H you and kiss you it means the problem [Applause] is and if you notice the problem is not with Daddy you the problem is with the son the son have not C it yet in other words if the father if that son get in the house follow me carefully amen I don't know if I will even get to what I'm trying to preach where did the father meet him was there any servant there so the father settle everything between him and him before he get in the house because if he pass hallu and get in the house with his mentality the servant I'm going to take over him I don't know if you getting me the child is coming home that's what matter to the father but the child coming home doesn't see home as home he sees home as an opportunity for job do you follow me so if the child pass the father without understanding that he will get into the house [Music] can I drink some water can I sleep with the in the garage Mommy I'm sorry servant number one sorry where is my bed the father said no no no no no no let me finish this ahead of time let me hug you and tell you now you understood you already your you're coming home means that you already got the right [Applause] man you are now on your way to development now me and you are going to be dealing [Applause] [Music] differently I'm going to drop something do you think you can swallow it do you think you can swallow it are you sure the devil told Eve she say you will be like God knowing Hallelujah evil and brother Bram said that was true a God must know and evil in the father's home he has not experienced evil this is strong now that you coming out of the mark you can be a true God knowing now he is good evil you can discern the truth [Applause] [Applause] now why is Mommy a best advisor because she made mistake that's why mommy knows and when Mom is talking she knows you don't know yet [Music] [Laughter] so before the child passes and go there the father him right finish with him right there in other way that's what matter job is finished but the child have not cut because the father is looking at the sunship but the child is looking at the condition the father is looking at the sunship the child is looking at this this already messed [Applause] up let's go to verse 20 one they kissed him they show him love he does an understand love he want punishment and if and if punishment comes he say yeah just as expected yeah I got to suffer it my brother I have to suffer it I'm conscious suffer yourself if you want to suffer let's put you in the cross and let me nail you for your sin I don't want to do that somebody did it for me that's the Catholic bringing people to the Cross ah verse 21 and the son say father I have sin against what heaven he's repeating it's like a computer automatic amen he feel like when he says that the child the father will say honest son I'm proud of you amen against heaven and in your and I am no more what worthy to be called your what thy son but the father says to [Laughter] [Music] him the father is saying brother Charles hington the father is talking to who he's talking to who he's talking to the son he's talking to who he's talking to what so so in word my decision was Final whatever you saying here is blah blah blah those garbage can I already forgave you I want you to get in the house and behave like a son you still caught up in the [Applause] garbage did you see the father answering him so was really the father paying attention to [Applause] him in other words

catchup to where you are supposed to be so it is not the father fault material is there It Is Us wasting our time instead of entering to what belongs to us you are God you the one keep wasting time
