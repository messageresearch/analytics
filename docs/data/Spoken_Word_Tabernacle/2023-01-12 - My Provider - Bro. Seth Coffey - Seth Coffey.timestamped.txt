[30:25] a correct angle of this message will
[30:29] never remove the deity out of the name
[30:32] of Jesus Christ
[30:36] if you hear somebody preaching the
[30:38] message and they begin to remove the
[30:40] deity from the name of Jesus Christ you
[30:43] run away
[30:46] did you give me you run away this
[30:49] message came to up to lift Jesus Christ
[30:56] a proper correct angle will always keep
[30:59] the deity in the name of Jesus
[31:03] We Worship the Lord Jesus Christ we
[31:07] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:10] whatever we do in word indeed we do it
[31:13] in the name of Jesus Christ our family
[31:16] name is Jesus Christ
[31:19] and the message is Jesus Christ
[31:26] Glory Glory
[31:28] Hallelujah
[31:30] sincerely by burning down brother John
[31:34] amen amen amen amen everybody on board
[31:38] with body change glorification
[31:41] everything clear now
[31:43] if you have question go ahead and put it
[31:47] on the question box because next
[31:48] Saturday Lord's willing we have
[31:50] questioned and answer so you have
[31:52] questioned about the thunder
[31:54] coming of the Lord or something let them
[31:57] there because I am fully loaded I'm
[32:00] overflown
[32:01] so what I'm giving you here is just the
[32:04] surface so if you need more coat I can
[32:07] Lodge you Lord you until you get drunk
[32:11] with the stimulation of the revelation
[32:15] amen oh my the devil is really really
[32:19] really mad
[32:21] you need to leave with me to know what's
[32:23] going on
[32:24] amen I can't even touch my Bible five
[32:28] verses something is happening left and
[32:30] right just to get me away from the Bible
[32:34] and today the Lord helped me I could
[32:36] look at 15 minutes or so and he opened
[32:39] up more than an hour sermon
[32:42] I said therefore all I need is just few
[32:44] minutes
[32:47] amen
[32:48] amen so you pray for me we have a lot to
[32:50] cover I was trying to move forward but
[32:53] the boss
[32:55] is unloading so much about the word God
[33:00] as the word and God as the flesh now
[33:03] which he opened the scripture in a way I
[33:06] never said it before so I'm going to
[33:08] take you to my journey and we go left
[33:10] and right and you will see really and
[33:12] when I look at the message perfectly in
[33:15] line with the scripture so brother Brown
[33:17] a mixed statement sometimes you don't
[33:19] understand before you know it you see a
[33:21] description lining up together and the
[33:23] message comes right across it and you
[33:25] say what else is this message but Christ
[33:28] himself amen amen amen so remember he is
[33:34] the word he's the flesh
[33:36] Hallelujah now we're going to see again
[33:39] the word how he is what does he mean by
[33:42] the word and now you will understand why
[33:45] do we need the turtle
[33:49] why does the third pool have to come
[33:52] here so you pray for me he's already
[33:55] late because I already got the
[33:56] ammunition
[33:58] all I need is when I get those few
[34:00] scripture if I sit down then the quote
[34:02] begin to come
[34:04] and I I got the quote before I say okay
[34:07] this is what I have yesterday I added
[34:09] more today another so it's just keep
[34:12] coming keep coming keep coming so we're
[34:14] in good shape
[34:16] amen when you have something that you
[34:19] believe in
[34:21] you have to welcome every scripture
[34:26] did you get what I'm saying that's right
[34:29] believe something in this message
[34:31] every quote that they can bring to you
[34:34] have too much with what you believe
[34:38] you cannot have something you believe
[34:40] and you have quotes against that and
[34:44] quote for it that's the problem in the
[34:47] message
[34:48] this one goes into the one extreme and
[34:51] the other one found another stream no no
[34:53] no no no the perfect position in the
[34:56] message you need to sit where every coat
[34:59] matches your position
[35:01] if you're believing something and you
[35:03] run it from Genesis to Revelation and
[35:06] it's running together then you know you
[35:09] got the truth
[35:11] if you see something is blocking
[35:14] you need to make sure you fix that
[35:16] because it's going to come back to bite
[35:18] you that's right
[35:20] everybody okay everybody okay so make
[35:23] sure whatever you believe it's in the
[35:25] scripture and it's in the message and he
[35:28] cannot contract it
[35:30] I've seen things that are taught and
[35:32] when I see new quote they always back up
[35:34] what I already taught
[35:38] because you need if something is wrong
[35:41] go back again and reposition the church
[35:44] correctly
[35:45] everybody okay so I'm not preaching
[35:48] tonight
[35:50] its Brothers said coffee

[39:45] man I'm trying to get ready for church
[39:46] trying to get there on time I said man
[39:48] I'm thinking about visiting tonight
[39:50] and they said really I said yeah man can
[39:52] you give me that address and he said
[39:54] yeah sure so he gave me the address and
[39:56] and I'm sure he probably figured out
[39:58] when he walked in the door I wouldn't
[39:59] just visited him tonight but then my I
[40:02] got one a prank put on me I guess
[40:04] because my friends are here I wasn't
[40:05] expecting to be here so it's good to see
[40:07] them as well
[40:08] hey man
[40:11] Matthew 6 and 25 and we want to take a
[40:14] text tonight I haven't uh I actually had
[40:17] this on my heart and I appreciate it New
[40:19] Year's and I haven't preached in quite
[40:21] some time but it just came on my heart
[40:23] and I couldn't get it off and and you'll
[40:25] understand when I say this when we get
[40:27] down to it but that last song We sang
[40:29] and and the things that uh brother
[40:31] Stephen said there I tell you what to
[40:34] let you know I was right on track so
[40:36] we're going to preach on this uh we're
[40:38] going to take a text tonight of my
[40:40] provider all right Matthew 6 and 25 amen
[40:43] and it says therefore I say unto you
[40:46] take no fault for your life what you
[40:49] shall eat or what you shall drink amen
[40:52] nor yet for your body what ye shall put
[40:54] on is not the life more than meat and
[40:57] the body than raiment yes and he says
[40:59] here behold the fowls of the air for
[41:01] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[41:03] gather into barns
[41:05] yet your heavenly father feedeth them
[41:09] and it says here are ye not much better
[41:11] than they which of You by taking thought
[41:15] can add one cubit unto his stature and
[41:18] why take ye thought for Raymond consider
[41:19] the lilies of the field how they grow
[41:21] they tool not neither do they spin and
[41:25] yet I say unto you that even Solomon and
[41:28] All His glory was not arrayed like one
[41:30] of these wherefore if God so clothed the
[41:32] grass of the field which today is and
[41:35] tomorrow is cast in the oven shall he
[41:37] not much more clothe You O ye of little
[41:40] faith
[41:42] I think that's a rebuke that we could
[41:44] all take tonight and say Lord help me
[41:46] therefore take no fault don't even take
[41:50] thought about it saying what shall we
[41:52] eat or what shall we drink or where will
[41:54] shall we be clothed for after all these
[41:57] things do the Gentiles seek it says
[41:59] listen to your church it says for your
[42:01] heavenly father knoweth that you have
[42:03] need of all these things but seek ye
[42:06] first don't worry about everything else
[42:09] just seek ye first the kingdom of God
[42:11] and his righteousness and all of these
[42:15] things will be added unto you so what
[42:18] God is saying here you just seek me
[42:20] first and all these other things they're
[42:21] just benefits no there's many things
[42:24] that when we go to look for a job and we
[42:26] go to sign up for something we say well
[42:28] what benefits does it have when I when I
[42:30] do this job we'll give you this bonus
[42:32] maybe you get a a quarterly bonus or a
[42:35] or a half year bonus or a Christmas
[42:37] bonus and all those different things but
[42:39] God's saying listen
[42:40] just seek me first and don't worry about
[42:42] the rest because I will be your provider
[42:45] we can look at this you know the sparrow
[42:47] he isn't worried about tomorrow or where
[42:50] he's going to get his food and I want to
[42:52] say this if if God would care so much
[42:55] for a stinking possum I don't know about
[42:57] y'all but I don't care much for a possum
[42:59] but God cares so much for a possum that
[43:02] he would send that possum to a prophet
[43:04] to be prayed forth are you not much
[43:06] better than that possum
[43:08] but I want you to know we have the
[43:10] assurance that God is going to take care
[43:12] of us but we must first seek the kingdom
[43:16] and I want to read this before I let you
[43:18] see this in Genesis 22 because I want
[43:20] you to know God has how many knows that
[43:23] God doesn't have to change his mind God
[43:25] doesn't have to change his word because
[43:27] his first thought is his best thought so
[43:30] whatever God said we can look in his
[43:32] word and know I don't care when he wrote
[43:34] this whether he wrote it 6 000 years ago
[43:37] two thousand years ago God's word still
[43:40] Reigns true today so if we can read in
[43:43] Genesis 22 that he already promised that
[43:45] we would overcome and he said in 22 16
[43:48] he said and I have said by myself I'm so
[43:51] thankful that he said it by himself and
[43:53] he didn't say it by Seth coffee because
[43:55] Seth coffee will let you down but he
[43:57] said I said by myself I have sworn saith
[44:00] the Lord for because thou has done this
[44:02] thing and that's not withheld my son
[44:04] he's speaking to Abraham now about Isaac
[44:07] thy only son that in blessing I Will
[44:09] Bless thee and it multiply I will
[44:11] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[44:14] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[44:16] sea sure and listen Church it doesn't
[44:18] say in thy seed might possess thy seed
[44:21] may be will possess his head in thy seed
[44:24] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[44:27] now I want you to notice that doesn't
[44:29] say enemy that says enemies because let
[44:31] me tell you what you're going through
[44:33] might not be my enemy your gate might
[44:36] not be my gate but he's already promised
[44:38] whatever your gate is you're going to
[44:40] possess it I want you to know tonight
[44:42] what is the gate here's what the gate is
[44:44] and what that means and in the old days
[44:47] you had a castle and the weakest or the
[44:50] strongest point of that castle was that
[44:52] gate if you could ever get through that
[44:54] gate you could get into the castle and
[44:57] God is saying whatever you need whatever
[44:59] you have to accomplish whatever
[45:01] stronghold is trying to bind you you
[45:04] already have possession of the gate

[47:18] provider the first thing you think of is
[47:20] Jehovah Jireh my provider and you know I
[47:24] must admit this and my failures that
[47:25] that you know when I was looking at
[47:27] Jehovah Jireh for a long time I just
[47:30] thought of Jehovah Jireh as the
[47:32] sacrifice as a sacrificial lamb that
[47:35] would come and die for our sins but one
[47:37] morning when I woke up and I was going
[47:39] fishing I began to turn on a tape and
[47:42] when I turned on that tape I heard
[47:43] something that changed the way that I
[47:45] looked at Jehovah Jireh for the rest of
[47:48] my life and and I woke up early and I
[47:50] turned on a tape and brother random said
[47:52] what happened God seen a need for a ram
[47:54] and he spoke the ram into existence in
[47:57] one minute and five minutes later it
[47:59] went out of existence why Abraham said
[48:02] we'll call the name of that place
[48:04] Jehovah Jireh the Lord will divide
[48:09] the Lord will provide himself a
[48:11] sacrifice now here's where I missed it
[48:13] church he said no matter what your need
[48:16] is now God has already provided a ram
[48:20] for your sacrifice

[48:26] eternal life God has provided a lamb for
[48:28] your Resurrection God has provided
[48:30] around to take those gray hairs and
[48:32] wrinkled face and turn them back to a
[48:34] new man and a woman again God has
[48:36] provided I tell you what I love the
[48:37] message of the hour God has provided a
[48:39] way to straighten that crooked hand God
[48:41] has provided a way to take the death of
[48:43] cancer away from you put life in there
[48:46] God's sacrifices already been provided
[48:48] he said shall we pray Heavenly Father oh
[48:51] when I think of that word Jehovah Jireh
[48:54] the Lord will provide himself a
[48:55] sacrifice in other words in other words
[48:58] you are the all-sufficient one and you
[49:01] can meet every condition when Abraham
[49:04] needed strength you spoke to him and
[49:07] said I am the breasted one just nurse
[49:09] here and I'll show you I'm going to turn
[49:11] you back to a young man again Abraham
[49:13] you're old but I'm God I'll tell you
[49:15] Satan tries to to say there's not going
[49:18] to be a body change and maybe we're
[49:19] getting older we might be getting older
[49:21] but let me tell you something there's
[49:22] still always a god yes oh Father and
[49:25] when we need when the need come for a
[49:27] sacrifice you had one provided you just

[49:47] the world that their life may be spared
[49:50] that their tears might be over that the
[49:52] dreads of death and the old grave out
[49:54] there in the snow sweeping across it

[50:00] place but God has provided a sacrifice
[50:04] for Resurrection God has provided

[50:45] I'm going to say that I was wrong I
[50:48] missed it by a million miles he was not
[50:50] just a sacrifice but he's the sacrifice
[50:52] to meet each and every one of our needs
[50:55] I'm so thankful we have a provider
[50:57] tonight and you know there's something
[50:59] about a provider he always seems to be
[51:01] preparing and prepping and you know we
[51:03] have these things called Doomsday
[51:05] Preppers and and they're they're little
[51:06] they're little sheds and and bunkers and
[51:09] everything they make is going to fail
[51:10] but I want you to know that our God is a
[51:13] prepper our God is a prepper I want you
[51:15] to know the lamb wasn't slain 2 000
[51:18] years ago Jehovah Jireh on the cross 2
[51:21] 000 years ago but it says the lamb was
[51:23] slain before the foundation of the world
[51:26] blessed be the name of the Lord before
[51:28] your mama ever knew you before your
[51:30] daddy ever knew you before they ever
[51:32] even thought about having you God was
[51:34] decided he already knew he was going to
[51:36] take care of you
[51:38] hey man
[51:40] he's a prepper
[51:43] but in the message of Grace
[51:47] brother Brandon he said I turned and
[51:49] looked again and I screamed out oh God
[51:53] you know where I'm going
[51:54] oh God
[51:56] what would you have your servant know
[51:58] just then the spirit of the Lord came in
[52:01] and said Jesus
[52:03] Jesus
[52:07] song were you singing
[52:08] [Applause]
[52:09] Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of
[52:13] the old he only changed his mask from
[52:17] Spirit to man now I want to read this
[52:19] here now this is David
[52:22] because I want you to know they didn't
[52:24] know the the name of Jehovah
[52:28] they knew the titles
[52:30] but they didn't know the name
[52:35] but David would say I Cried unto the
[52:37] Lord with my voice with my voice and the
[52:39] Lord did I make my supplication I poured
[52:41] out my complaint before them I sold
[52:44] before him my trouble when my spirit was
[52:47] overwhelmed with him
[52:49] then thou knowest my path in the way
[52:52] when I walk they have privilege laid a
[52:54] snare for me I looked on my right hand
[52:56] and behold there was an old man that
[52:58] would know me Refuge failed me
[53:04] no man cared for my soul
[53:07] where David is at right now is David is
[53:10] a rejected King the very King that he is
[53:13] supposed to be the very nation has
[53:15] rejected him and right now he is in a
[53:18] cave crying out going God you are my
[53:20] refuge
[53:22] no man cared for my soul I cried to the
[53:25] own Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and
[53:28] my portion in the land of the living and
[53:30] in Proverbs he would run this the name
[53:32] of the Lord is a strong tower the
[53:35] righteous runeth into it and it's safe
[53:37] but I want you to know when David was in
[53:40] such a stress he would have to go
[53:42] through the list and find the name that
[53:44] he would need you have Jehovah child or
[53:46] the Lord will provide himself a
[53:48] sacrifice Jehovah Rapha the Lord our
[53:51] healer Jehovah Nissi the Lord our Banner

[53:58] Tisch canoe the Lord our righteousness
[54:00] are Jehovah the Lord is present so in
[54:03] the middle of that prayer when he would
[54:05] begin to say it if I can say it this way
[54:07] if this is all right at the end of the
[54:09] prayer he would say in the name of
[54:12] Jehovah shalom he would have to find the
[54:16] right title to go with the name that he
[54:19] was praying for but I'm so glad tonight
[54:21] that you know David had a stress
[54:23] reliever in such a time he could say
[54:26] Jehovah Shalom but I'm so glad to know
[54:28] what our peace is you say what is our
[54:31] stress reliever what's looking for

[58:59] was in pain and your daughter came up to
[59:02] me and laid her hand on my knee and said
[59:04] Jesus make his knee better and she went
[59:06] on back to what she was doing he said
[59:09] but I'll tell you what I woke up the
[59:10] next day and all the swelling was gone
[59:12] all the time
[59:14] at the name of Jesus yes sir foreign
[59:21] [Applause]
[59:23] shall confess
[59:28] but what we can take comfort in
[59:31] Jehovah of the old being Jesus of the
[59:33] new if there's ever a time that you can
[59:36] look in the scripture and you can see
[59:38] where Jehovah was enough
[59:41] then you know let me tell you what you
[59:43] are called on the name of Jesus yes you
[59:47] automatically pick up each and every one
[59:50] of those seven compound names that's
[59:53] exactly right you know brother Branham
[59:54] brother Bosworth versus brother best and
[59:57] he said he was going to put brother bass
[59:59] in the corner because brother bass begin
[1:00:01] to say that that he's not a Healer and
[1:00:04] he said I want to ask you something does
[1:00:06] the seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:00:09] apply to Jesus Christ or not and that
[1:00:12] ended it that's it because he couldn't
[1:00:14] say that Jesus was the deity and he was
[1:00:16] in one but he wasn't in the other so we
[1:00:20] can say tonight that no matter what our
[1:00:22] situation is yes my brother I want to
[1:00:25] tell you something I've never seen a
[1:00:26] time in my life where times are so
[1:00:28] stressful that's right but I want you to
[1:00:30] know when you speak the name Jesus yes
[1:00:33] sir you're already picking up Jehovah
[1:00:36] Shalom that's right and if Jehovah
[1:00:38] Shalom was enough for David in his time
[1:00:41] of hey when he was in the middle of a
[1:00:44] cave completely rejected but he would
[1:00:46] find a refuge in the name of Jehovah
[1:00:49] shalom
[1:00:51] how much more in this day and age will
[1:00:53] we have a name of every name
[1:00:56] that we can find Refuge tonight
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] the scripture says very familiar
[1:01:10] Jehovah Rapha
[1:01:12] the Lord our healer
[1:01:19] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:01:23] and carried our sorrows where is Jehovah
[1:01:26] Rapha
[1:01:27] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:01:30] of God Afflicted but he was wounded
[1:01:33] for our transgressions
[1:01:36] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:01:39] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:01:41] him
[1:01:42] and by his stripes
[1:01:45] we are healed
[1:01:48] finished settled Jehovah Rapha changed
[1:01:53] his mask and dwelled in the body of
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ in Isaiah would say I see
[1:02:01] Jehovah Rapha coming I see him he's on
[1:02:04] his way and he didn't know his name but
[1:02:07] when he came who was that speaking of it
[1:02:10] was speaking of Jesus
[1:02:12] surely he has borne our grief
[1:02:16] we don't have to have grief tonight
[1:02:18] because we have a provider yes my
[1:02:22] brother
[1:02:24] you know
[1:02:27] how many beliefs
[1:02:29] know what not that ye now are the sons
[1:02:31] of God
[1:02:33] don't you know that you are the children
[1:02:35] of God and you know who takes care of
[1:02:37] the children the father
[1:02:40] you know who the provider is the father
[1:02:43] I I love using this illustration I love
[1:02:46] using my kids because I tell you if I
[1:02:49] ever learn the love of God it was from
[1:02:51] being a parent because I realized
[1:02:53] something when I had that child she
[1:02:55] didn't have to do anything to Merit my
[1:02:57] love
[1:02:58] that was my child you mess with her
[1:03:02] you mess with me
[1:03:05] you hurt her feelings
[1:03:08] this ain't very Christian but I'm gonna
[1:03:09] hurt you
[1:03:11] you don't mess with my kids now
[1:03:14] but but but you see what I'm saying and
[1:03:17] you can see that every time someone hurt
[1:03:19] the children of Israel they should have
[1:03:21] never done it
[1:03:22] they should have never hurt God's
[1:03:24] children but do you know when we go
[1:03:26] through this life
[1:03:28] and my little girl wants a Happy Meal
[1:03:31] she doesn't go and check her bank
[1:03:33] account but she's got money for a Happy
[1:03:35] Meal
[1:03:36] because she don't have a bank account
[1:03:38] because she don't need one
[1:03:41] because she has a provider
[1:03:43] she don't worry about who's going to pay
[1:03:45] the power bill she don't worry about how
[1:03:47] she's going to get to church she don't
[1:03:49] worry about where she's going to get her
[1:03:50] clothes from
[1:03:51] but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:03:54] and all these other things will be added
[1:03:58] unto you amen I don't think you realize
[1:04:00] how blessed you are tonight that when
[1:04:02] you come to the house of God I believe
[1:04:05] it was David in Psalms 103 he said
[1:04:07] forget not all of his benefits you are a
[1:04:12] beneficial people tonight you are
[1:04:14] beneficiaries of this Resurrection when
[1:04:17] you come to the house of God tonight you
[1:04:20] know what it means to be a beneficiary I
[1:04:22] looked it up it says it means you have
[1:04:24] an advantage blessed be the name of the
[1:04:27] Lord do you realize when you woke up
[1:04:29] this morning you already had an
[1:04:31] advantage over Satan says you already
[1:04:34] had an advantage
[1:04:36] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:40] would you like to read it I believe I
[1:04:43] have it in here preach my brother
[1:04:45] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[1:04:48] all his benefits
[1:04:51] who forgiveth all that iniquities
[1:04:54] who healeth all that is Jesus who
[1:04:58] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[1:05:00] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[1:05:01] Tender Mercies
[1:05:03] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[1:05:05] so that that youth is renewed like the
[1:05:09] eagle
[1:05:10] I'm gonna tell you I have to say this
[1:05:12] right here because God told me to
[1:05:14] that was a time brother I was feeling
[1:05:16] down
[1:05:17] when I began I don't remember what
[1:05:19] message it was but I turned it on
[1:05:21] and brother Brandon began to talk about
[1:05:23] that eagle yes sir and about how it
[1:05:25] would go through that renewing of life
[1:05:28] and now it's how it's how its beak would
[1:05:31] film over and his feathers would get all
[1:05:33] crusty and and he couldn't Fly Away
[1:05:36] but if he could ever just beat his beak
[1:05:41] on the rock

[1:11:38] a prodigal son
[1:11:40] but it never changed he wasn't called
[1:11:42] The Prodigal he was The Prodigal Son
[1:11:49] many times we come to the house of God
[1:11:51] going maybe I can praise my way back
[1:11:54] into his good good will maybe I can
[1:11:56] maybe I can just do something to earn
[1:11:58] his grace what did you ever do to earn
[1:12:00] his grace in the first place

[1:12:07] if you
[1:12:08] if any one of you have obtained your own
[1:12:11] salvation by your good works please line
[1:12:14] up right here in front of me but if you
[1:12:16] but remember it takes Perfection so if
[1:12:19] any of you have made a mistake just
[1:12:20] please stay in your seat
[1:12:24] we get this I'm holier than you you're
[1:12:26] but we ain't
[1:12:29] you're either perfect or you're not
[1:12:32] I'm better than you you're better than
[1:12:34] me and we have all sin and come short of
[1:12:37] the glory of God
[1:12:39] but by one sacrifice this man who was
[1:12:43] this man it was our provider has
[1:12:46] perfected them forever
[1:12:49] so when you're in Christ tonight oh yeah
[1:12:51] maybe in this flesh you've made mistakes
[1:12:53] but on the inside of the inside that's a
[1:12:57] real you
[1:12:58] the real you who is that real you that
[1:13:02] real you
[1:13:04] is that something on the inside of you
[1:13:06] that you know you might have mistakes
[1:13:08] you might have failures but you ain't
[1:13:11] giving up and you wonder why you ain't
[1:13:14] giving up yes because the genetics on

[1:13:42] come on don't get quiet on me
[1:13:46] but you know what I begin to realize in
[1:13:48] that moment I begin to think everything
[1:13:50] that God has done for me
[1:13:54] everything that he has brought me
[1:13:57] through
[1:13:58] even though this flesh don't feel like
[1:14:00] it even though my nerves don't there was
[1:14:03] something deeper on the inside that
[1:14:05] began to say Lord I remember where you
[1:14:08] brought me from I remember where you
[1:14:10] brought me out of why
[1:14:12] because I was redeemable
[1:14:15] and let me tell you something to be
[1:14:17] redeemable you had to be owned by
[1:14:20] somebody somebody already had the new
[1:14:23] year he already had
[1:14:27] he came to take back to redeem what was
[1:14:31] already his so take courage tonight take
[1:14:35] joy tonight if you can hear the word of
[1:14:38] God and there's something on the inside
[1:14:40] of you saying that's the truth that's
[1:14:43] nothing but the truth I've been through
[1:14:45] a lot I'm going through things but I
[1:14:48] still love God
[1:14:51] um that's more than you that's God's
[1:14:54] love on the inside of you the scripture
[1:14:56] said we love him because he first loved
[1:15:00] us
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:02] hearing is love not that we love him
[1:15:05] Jesus but that he loved us why it's not
[1:15:09] hard to love Jesus Jesus is the perfect
[1:15:12] Son of God but this is love that he can
[1:15:16] look at us and through our failures and
[1:15:19] mistakes God don't see mistakes God sees

[1:19:00] brother this is your land yes sir
[1:19:05] I was listening to brother Brandon today
[1:19:06] and he said that body is your body the
[1:19:09] devil ain't got no right to be there
[1:19:11] that's your land yes my brother
[1:19:15] preach the angels of God will take their
[1:19:18] position and the devil will get out you
[1:19:20] stand there on your toes and say yes sir
[1:19:23] it's the truth amen not up here and down
[1:19:26] here you've read your title clear you
[1:19:29] know what it is
[1:19:31] hey man
[1:19:33] Church yes sir Christianity ain't just
[1:19:36] meant on top experiences
[1:19:39] walk in this narrow way ain't always the
[1:19:43] easiest way but I promise you wherever
[1:19:46] you are on that path if you're in a
[1:19:47] valley if you're on a mountain and let
[1:19:49] me tell you something if you're on a
[1:19:49] mountain fairly good don't worry you got
[1:19:51] a valley
[1:19:52] ahead of you
[1:19:53] but I want you to know it don't matter
[1:19:55] where you are on top or down low it
[1:19:57] doesn't change who you are
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:01] amen
[1:20:05] you can't said to Joshua and Caleb I
[1:20:08] give you the land
[1:20:10] the land is yours that's it but you're
[1:20:14] gonna fight yes
[1:20:17] yes the church can I say this the fight
[1:20:20] wasn't that hard
[1:20:22] all they had to do was walk and swing
[1:20:24] your sword
[1:20:26] if you do what God says that's it that's
[1:20:29] it that's it I'll say this most valleys
[1:20:33] are self-inflicted faults that's exactly
[1:20:35] right it's a time that we don't give God
[1:20:38] the prayer time that he deserves it's
[1:20:41] the time when you decide to get on
[1:20:43] Facebook instead of sticking your face
[1:20:44] in this book that's it it's the time
[1:20:47] where you're looking at everything on
[1:20:48] Instagram or Marketplace and I go into
[1:20:51] work and spending all your time at work
[1:20:53] instead of spending time with the
[1:20:55] Creator that's it
[1:20:57] if I want to know more about Stephen I'm
[1:20:58] not going to go halfway across North
[1:21:00] Carolina I'm going to come to him and
[1:21:02] talk to him
[1:21:03] and if you want a more a successful life
[1:21:06] with Jesus looking everywhere else and
[1:21:09] look to him
[1:21:11] hey man that's all free I don't know
[1:21:13] where that came from
[1:21:17] man
[1:21:19] how powerful is that name of Jesus
[1:21:23] you know there was a time that brother
[1:21:25] Brandon went into a place
[1:21:26] and there was these witches
[1:21:28] and they had this table floating up out
[1:21:30] of the off the ground brother Brandon
[1:21:33] walked in there and he said I said Lord
[1:21:34] Jesus you said in Saint Mark the 16th
[1:21:36] chapter in my name they shall cast out
[1:21:38] Devils I said now that I am your servant
[1:21:40] May nothing
[1:21:43] your servant may know as the battle lays
[1:21:45] before me I said I command the table to
[1:21:47] fall down in the name of the holy church
[1:21:49] and it stayed right there I said I
[1:21:52] command the table to fall in the name of
[1:21:54] the father of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:21:56] and it stayed right there I said I
[1:21:58] command that table to fall down in the
[1:22:00] name of Jesus Christ and it like to
[1:22:03] broke all four legs off hitting the
[1:22:05] floor
[1:22:06] those were titles
[1:22:08] this is a name
[1:22:10] I want you to realize every devil
[1:22:15] whether in this building or not wherever
[1:22:17] they try to be they know a name that's
[1:22:19] it they know the name of Jesus yes my
[1:22:22] brother they know Authority when you
[1:22:24] speak it when you speak the name of
[1:22:25] Jesus they begin to get fearful and and
[1:22:28] you know brother Brandon would even
[1:22:29] begin to say in that discernment this
[1:22:31] demon would begin to call up for that
[1:22:32] demon to help why are they calling for
[1:22:34] help because let me tell you something
[1:22:36] when I when I when I wasn't where I
[1:22:38] should be with God and and we knew there
[1:22:40] was going to be a fight and we we knew
[1:22:41] we couldn't win on our own we called
[1:22:43] someone else to help us
[1:22:44] so those devils are beginning to call on
[1:22:47] help because they realize we can't take
[1:22:50] on Jesus they realize if you ever
[1:22:53] believe yes sir and ever just call on
[1:22:56] the name of Jesus atmospheres will begin
[1:22:59] to change
[1:23:00] the pressures of this world will begin
[1:23:02] to release you will begin to go free
[1:23:05] because wherever Jesus went he cast out
[1:23:09] Satan
[1:23:10] and God cannot change look in the
[1:23:12] beginning when Michael
[1:23:15] who was that Michael it was Jesus
[1:23:19] when Lucifer decided I'm gonna take on
[1:23:22] Jesus because he's not the smartest
[1:23:26] Satan is not that smart
[1:23:28] he decides I'm going to take on Jesus
[1:23:30] I'm going to try to fight Jesus but you
[1:23:34] know what Jesus did he cast him out
[1:23:38] and then Satan has this great plan I'm
[1:23:41] going to dwell on Earth and I'm I'm
[1:23:43] gonna indwell in humans and ruin their
[1:23:45] life but here comes a little man named
[1:23:47] Jesus
[1:23:49] yes my brother he's on a boat
[1:23:53] and there's a sea that tries to drown
[1:23:55] him
[1:23:56] but when the wind kept coming and trying
[1:23:58] to the waves and the wind tried to drown
[1:24:00] Jesus Jesus just cast the spirits out
[1:24:05] that wind and that Tempest that tried to
[1:24:07] kill him Jesus just cast it out
[1:24:11] because let me tell you something and
[1:24:13] this is what you need to get
[1:24:15] there was one
[1:24:17] there was one on the other side
[1:24:20] there was one on the other side
[1:24:24] and you know what they even called him
[1:24:27] by the title of legion
[1:24:30] but that was not his name
[1:24:35] so Jesus begins to go to the other side
[1:24:40] and let me tell you something don't
[1:24:42] think because you're going through a
[1:24:43] trial that you ain't a son and daughter
[1:24:45] of God that's the best case that you are
[1:24:48] a son and daughter of God
[1:24:50] when Satan's trying to stop the move of
[1:24:52] the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:24:55] is I'll tell you what if I didn't have
[1:24:57] no problems and everything was going
[1:24:58] right I would check myself
[1:25:01] I would check what I believed
[1:25:07] but as he gets held on the other side
[1:25:10] there's a man there
[1:25:14] and he's covered in a legion of devils
[1:25:16] he's covered in a legion of devils and
[1:25:20] he's Bound by a legion of devils but
[1:25:23] that's not who he is
[1:25:28] that might be his problem I keep going
[1:25:30] back I've never preached a sermon this
[1:25:32] way
[1:25:34] he might have problems
[1:25:36] he might have situations but those
[1:25:39] Legion of devils could never change who
[1:25:42] he was
[1:25:46] he was tucked away in a cave
[1:25:49] sometimes in our own carnality we limit
[1:25:51] God that's exactly the limit what God
[1:25:54] that's exactly right
[1:25:56] he's sitting back there in a cave and
[1:25:58] he's cutting himself and he's miserable
[1:26:00] and he's ruined his life with his family
[1:26:02] you know maybe I say this be careful
[1:26:04] tonight
[1:26:05] be careful because I want to tell you
[1:26:07] Legion never just became that overnight
[1:26:09] but it started with one thing from that
[1:26:13] time
[1:26:14] maybe it was an innocent after work
[1:26:17] drink that's exactly right the next
[1:26:19] thing you know he drunk in the spirit
[1:26:21] that's it and another Spirit God will
[1:26:23] hold up that depression came into his
[1:26:25] life so he had to drink more to try to
[1:26:27] forget about it and another spirit and
[1:26:29] another spirit
[1:26:31] until he was completely bound
[1:26:35] he was so bound
[1:26:37] he was sitting there maybe you have lost
[1:26:39] loved ones you're praying for right now
[1:26:42] and maybe you say man they're just so
[1:26:44] bound but he's in there and he's cutting
[1:26:46] himself and he's miserable and he's
[1:26:48] looking back on his life and he's been
[1:26:49] going oh why did I do it this way why do
[1:26:52] that and the demons are going shut up
[1:26:55] the demons are going let's call him
[1:26:57] Caleb for a second and he said the
[1:26:59] demons are going Caleb
[1:27:01] this is who you are
[1:27:04] this is who you are now Caleb this is
[1:27:07] you this is who you'll always be Caleb
[1:27:12] ra you will never get out of this Caleb
[1:27:14] preach my brother Caleb you will be
[1:27:16] depressed for the rest of your life
[1:27:18] Caleb you will cut yourself for the rest
[1:27:21] of your life
[1:27:23] modern day Caleb you'll be hooked on
[1:27:25] that pornography for the rest of your
[1:27:27] life
[1:27:28] Caleb you'll be addicted of those drugs
[1:27:30] for the rest of your life
[1:27:32] and there was times
[1:27:35] he would begin to believe it
[1:27:38] did you say this is who I
[1:27:42] just if I could be delivered the priests
[1:27:44] would have already delivered me
[1:27:46] or somebody would have believed
[1:27:49] preacher Jones
[1:27:52] preacher Jones would have delivered me
[1:27:55] a preacher Seth would have delivered me
[1:28:00] begin to say
[1:28:03] Kayla began to go I feel like I just
[1:28:05] I feel like this will never end
[1:28:08] I feel like no matter what I can't get
[1:28:10] out of this
[1:28:12] I feel like every time I think I find my
[1:28:14] joy I'll lose it again
[1:28:19] but he knew
[1:28:20] through all those voices
[1:28:24] something inside of Caleb on the Deep
[1:28:26] Side
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:28] maybe it was something his mama told him
[1:28:30] on his lap on her lap all those years
[1:28:33] ago
[1:28:34] Pam one day
[1:28:36] there's going to be a messiah
[1:28:40] those demons would say shut up
[1:28:43] don't believe that message of the hour
[1:28:45] don't believe that thing that's coming
[1:28:49] but there was something on the inside
[1:28:52] and let me tell you something Jesus
[1:28:55] begins to step out on that Shore
[1:29:01] and when he's stepping there
[1:29:03] those demons begin to have PTSD
[1:29:09] and they begin to go
[1:29:10] I know who that is
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:14] I know who that is
[1:29:18] have you gonna talk
[1:29:20] did you feel that
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:27] hey hey did you the whole legion's
[1:29:30] getting together and having a conference
[1:29:33] if I'm not mistaken
[1:29:35] when we were in heaven
[1:29:37] and Lucifer told us all to gather
[1:29:39] together did you not feel that did you
[1:29:41] not feel that same presence
[1:29:43] and they began to go yeah I think that's
[1:29:44] him I think that's him
[1:29:47] and they began to go well let's just go
[1:29:49] look
[1:29:49] and they begin to run out there and the
[1:29:51] closer they begin they go oh
[1:29:57] I know who that is
[1:29:59] you see the demons have never forgot
[1:30:03] ever since the beginning who that is why
[1:30:06] do you think they try so hard
[1:30:09] to keep you out of church
[1:30:11] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:30:15] name there will I be in the midst
[1:30:20] when you come into this place the Devils
[1:30:23] begin to go
[1:30:25] I know who that is
[1:30:28] I know who that is
[1:30:31] but if they can keep you from believing
[1:30:34] they can have victory
[1:30:40] I want you to realize that's the only
[1:30:42] thing that Satan has many mighty Works
[1:30:46] he couldn't do because of their unbelief
[1:30:52] I want you I want to say it this way
[1:30:55] you walked into that door right there
[1:30:57] you were as free
[1:30:59] could be
[1:31:07] you remember what brother Branham told
[1:31:09] the story about Johnny Crowe
[1:31:13] how they would tie Johnny Crow to a
[1:31:16] stream right
[1:31:17] he would walk in a circle
[1:31:19] over
[1:31:21] and over
[1:31:22] one day old Feller came by and said man
[1:31:24] I really feel sorry for that guy
[1:31:27] if I can say it this way and old
[1:31:29] evangelist came through
[1:31:32] and he went up to Jerry Crow yes
[1:31:34] and he cut it
[1:31:36] and he said you're free
[1:31:40] but those demons had told Jerry you'll
[1:31:42] never or Johnny you'll never ever ever
[1:31:45] ever ever ever
[1:31:47] get out of this Johnny
[1:31:49] but Johnny was already free
[1:31:52] when you walk through that door you're
[1:31:55] already free
[1:31:56] but you can't keep going in the same
[1:31:58] Circle
[1:31:59] somebody's got to break the cycle you
[1:32:03] say well my family has dealt with
[1:32:04] alcoholism my whole life somebody's got
[1:32:07] to break the side that's exactly right
[1:32:12] this Halo tobacco ISM and all these are
[1:32:14] different addictions have random mind in
[1:32:16] my family somebody has to break the side
[1:32:19] that's exactly right your father and
[1:32:21] your grandpa could have broke that cycle
[1:32:24] but they never realized they were
[1:32:25] already free
[1:32:29] and when Legion began to walk out there
[1:32:32] those Legion of devils I had Caleb bound
[1:32:36] they didn't go out there to Jesus and
[1:32:38] say hey man let's let's try to have a
[1:32:41] good fight let's put on a good match he
[1:32:43] said please just don't torture us before
[1:32:46] our town
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:50] just let us go into the swine
[1:32:56] and Jesus says go
[1:33:02] I know I've slowed down a lot
[1:33:04] but I want you to realize the Simplicity
[1:33:06] of the Gospel
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:13] the things I'm ministering and I
[1:33:15] understand
[1:33:17] the things in your life
[1:33:19] that you've held on to for so long
[1:33:23] the problems
[1:33:25] the things that you've battled
[1:33:28] you're free
[1:33:31] it's easy
[1:33:33] it's easy
[1:33:34] to say
[1:33:35] oh Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead
[1:33:38] Jesus healed the leper
[1:33:41] what about you
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:45] did his name change
[1:33:47] did the provider change
[1:33:51] who changed
[1:33:55] who changed
[1:33:57] now listen circumstance doesn't change
[1:33:59] who you are
[1:34:00] but who changed you did
[1:34:03] I did
[1:34:07] Seth coffee on Tuesday
[1:34:09] didn't feel
[1:34:11] like preaching
[1:34:13] I'm being honest with you Church
[1:34:15] I ain't never gonna get up here and be
[1:34:16] more holier than now
[1:34:19] but you know what
[1:34:21] I began to think of Paul and Silas
[1:34:24] and I began to think even in the midst
[1:34:26] of their try their neighbor going
[1:34:28] through it and you know they probably
[1:34:30] physically didn't feel like praising God
[1:34:32] but they begin to realize that God's
[1:34:35] taking care of us and you know what I
[1:34:37] begin to realize even though I don't
[1:34:39] feel so good
[1:34:40] even though I don't feel like in my
[1:34:42] flesh to preach I'm still a son of God
[1:34:45] and something begin to rise up on me I'm
[1:34:48] just going to tell you the whole truth I
[1:34:50] called Richie Douglas
[1:34:52] to get some encouragement and he didn't
[1:34:54] answer but in between him answering and
[1:34:57] calling me back I realized I'm still a
[1:34:59] Son of God that's my brother
[1:35:01] and he called me and he said is this
[1:35:04] that Mighty Man of Valor I say yes it is
[1:35:09] this is him you got the right number
[1:35:13] you got the right number and we need to
[1:35:16] realize tonight we ain't just a bunch of
[1:35:19] whips we're the Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:21] almighty God there ain't a devil big
[1:35:23] enough there ain't a devil strong enough
[1:35:26] there ain't no gonna lie too strong
[1:35:29] that we can't take the Simplicity of the
[1:35:32] word of God oh he might have he might
[1:35:35] have made his voice for days and days
[1:35:37] and days and days and days and days but
[1:35:40] some David's got to stand up and say
[1:35:42] that's enough
[1:35:44] is there any David's in here
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:49] is this that mighty medabella
[1:35:52] this is the daughter of Zion yes my
[1:35:55] brother
[1:35:57] Satan that's enough
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:04] let's take those stones
[1:36:08] if
[1:36:09] he picked up those stones
[1:36:11] faith in Jesus brother Brandon typed it
[1:36:15] faith in the provider
[1:36:22] when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:26] listen
[1:36:28] Satan ain't fighting Seth coffee
[1:36:30] Satan's fighting almighty God
[1:36:34] Paul
[1:36:36] said Lord
[1:36:38] I'll never deny you
[1:36:40] I'll never deny you Lord
[1:36:42] I'll never let you down lord I've got
[1:36:44] your back Lord Peter
[1:36:48] before the Cockroach three times you're
[1:36:51] gonna deny me
[1:36:52] I ain't gonna deny you Lord
[1:36:55] and he denied him
[1:36:57] but that never changed the fact that
[1:37:00] Peter was still a son
[1:37:03] but you know what Peter
[1:37:06] was a different man after the upper room
[1:37:10] these 120 that were hid back inside of
[1:37:14] this room
[1:37:15] but when the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:17] when the indwelling of almighty God came
[1:37:20] and dwelt on the inside of them boy they
[1:37:22] busted out of that house and they began
[1:37:24] to all talk in new tongues and people
[1:37:26] said these are drunk on new wine he said
[1:37:28] we ain't drunk like you suppose
[1:37:30] this is a different kind of wine but you
[1:37:33] know what it was the indwelling of the
[1:37:35] Holy Ghost came in but do you know what
[1:37:37] that Holy Ghost did
[1:37:39] it didn't put something new in there
[1:37:42] it brought out what was already there it
[1:37:47] quickened the sea that was on the inside
[1:37:49] even though Peter had mistakes even
[1:37:51] though Peter did things wrong when the
[1:37:53] Holy Ghost came over him it brought the
[1:37:55] real Peter out it brought him out to a
[1:37:58] place that he wasn't worried that he
[1:38:00] would go anywhere that he would be in
[1:38:02] jail that he would be into a place where
[1:38:04] he would have so much faith in God that
[1:38:06] an angel would come and say come on
[1:38:08] Peter let's go let's get on out of here
[1:38:09] you ain't got to stay here no longer and
[1:38:12] I want you to know the angel of the Lord
[1:38:13] is still here the angel of the Lord is
[1:38:16] still coming by and he's going to ever
[1:38:18] ever prison door and unlocking the doors
[1:38:20] and saying you can go free if you want
[1:38:22] to you can go free if you want to but
[1:38:24] it's up to you
[1:38:26] [Applause]
[1:38:30] amen
[1:38:32] I know it's a Wednesday night and we'll
[1:38:34] come real close
[1:38:37] have you been encouraged tonight
[1:38:40] you have to realize that your provider
[1:38:43] is greater than your need
[1:38:45] you know what that is what a provider is
[1:38:49] a provider
[1:38:51] is someone that has the resources that
[1:38:53] are greater than what you need or what
[1:38:55] your obstacle is
[1:38:57] whether it be depression
[1:39:00] whatever you're going through you see I
[1:39:02] need the Holy Ghost there's one here
[1:39:03] that can give it he has it he can
[1:39:06] provide it
[1:39:08] I tell you I've seen so many miracles in
[1:39:11] the name of Jesus
[1:39:13] I can't even can't in my in my own I
[1:39:16] don't want to call it my Ministry
[1:39:17] because it's the bride's Ministry
[1:39:20] but church just over the new year
[1:39:23] I've seen a woman
[1:39:25] and she came up
[1:39:27] and she said I've been battling
[1:39:28] arthritis in my shoulder and my elbow
[1:39:31] and my wrist
[1:39:34] and she said will you pray for me
[1:39:37] because I told her I said you know
[1:39:38] there's a name above that arthritis
[1:39:42] and we laid hands on the sick and they
[1:39:44] shall recover
[1:39:47] I've seen a god of 2000 years ago this
[1:39:49] is a god of two weeks ago that is still
[1:39:51] here today right now the same yesterday
[1:39:54] today and forever
[1:39:56] and I prayed for her in that moment
[1:39:58] you know we got done praying and the
[1:40:00] spirit of God was moving
[1:40:04] and after that service she came to me
[1:40:06] she took that bad arm and she shook my
[1:40:08] hand and she said ever a bit of the pain
[1:40:10] has left me
[1:40:12] arthritis can't stay in the presence of
[1:40:15] Jesus none of your circumstances are big
[1:40:19] enough
[1:40:20] strong enough great enough
[1:40:23] to sin
[1:40:25] in the way
[1:40:26] of Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:40:30] I want to turn the corner and I'll close
[1:40:34] to my brother
[1:40:37] you know
[1:40:41] blessed to have a good Earthly father
[1:40:44] I was my father always took still taking
[1:40:46] care of me I caught him today
[1:40:49] but
[1:40:52] I look I never worried
[1:40:55] I never worried about anything
[1:40:57] you know there was once
[1:40:59] there would be things that I wanted
[1:41:00] brother Stephen
[1:41:02] I didn't need
[1:41:04] but he would still give it to me
[1:41:07] that's right
[1:41:09] there's times when we come to God
[1:41:12] and we say God God knows you don't even
[1:41:14] need it amen
[1:41:16] but if it makes you happy he wants you
[1:41:20] I'm
[1:41:22] an amen
[1:41:23] amen he might know that that you're in a
[1:41:26] trial and you don't need out of that
[1:41:28] trial yet you're not at your breaking
[1:41:30] point but God will just give you the
[1:41:32] Deliverance you want
[1:41:36] and he cares for you yes my brother but
[1:41:39] well the point I'm trying to make is I
[1:41:41] look back on my life
[1:41:44] I used to play sports
[1:41:46] I never paid for the entry fees
[1:41:49] I never bought my own clothes
[1:41:51] because my father took care of me
[1:41:54] but you know I can say this as much as I
[1:41:57] love my Earthly father and all the
[1:41:59] things that he'd done for me and still
[1:42:01] does for me
[1:42:04] my father never gave me life
[1:42:08] my father Earthly father
[1:42:11] never put this heartbeat in my chest
[1:42:14] my Earth and father didn't give me my
[1:42:16] right mind
[1:42:18] my Earthly father didn't give me the
[1:42:20] peace that I have amen and I'll tell you
[1:42:22] this
[1:42:23] when you can look
[1:42:25] it's your provider yes my brother and
[1:42:28] I'll tell you what I'm 20 27 years old
[1:42:31] now but the last 12 years which I mean
[1:42:33] my whole life but when I was 15 years
[1:42:35] old when I gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:42:38] can look back
[1:42:39] and I can say there was a lot of Trials
[1:42:41] brother Stephen
[1:42:42] there was church problems there was
[1:42:45] family problems there was a drinking
[1:42:48] problems smoking problems women
[1:42:49] everything
[1:42:51] through all my life
[1:42:53] but after I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:42:57] he changed all my desires amen he took
[1:43:00] care of me yes my brother and through my
[1:43:02] journey there's been problems but I can
[1:43:04] tell you this there's never been one
[1:43:05] time I've been
[1:43:08] amen
[1:43:10] there was never one time amen that I
[1:43:13] ever needed one thing that my heavenly
[1:43:16] father didn't provide for me
[1:43:19] there was never one time
[1:43:22] that I got to a point
[1:43:24] maybe I was so depressed because things
[1:43:26] weren't going my way
[1:43:28] and I came to church and I thought I'll
[1:43:29] never make it out of this but God in his
[1:43:32] rich and mercy came down and delivered
[1:43:34] me from it
[1:43:36] there's been times Church where I was so
[1:43:39] nervous and overwhelmed I was so gripped
[1:43:42] with fear I didn't know where I was
[1:43:44] going to turn I didn't know where how I
[1:43:46] was going to overcome and it seemed like
[1:43:48] nothing would help me I would pray and I
[1:43:50] would pray and I would pray but in one
[1:43:53] moment yes my brother when no one else
[1:43:56] could help
[1:43:58] Jesus made the difference
[1:44:02] I look back on my life
[1:44:08] I'm David in the psalm he says remember
[1:44:10] the Lord
[1:44:12] he begins to say remember when he said
[1:44:14] he was David was discouraged and he
[1:44:17] encouraged himself by remembering how
[1:44:20] God would bring the children of Israel
[1:44:22] through the Red Sea
[1:44:24] and all the mighty works that he did and
[1:44:27] when he got done talking about it he
[1:44:29] began to be encouraged I mean I want you
[1:44:32] to realize tonight that you can be
[1:44:34] encouraged because this is not your end
[1:44:41] he is not just the author of our faith
[1:44:45] not just the finisher of our faith but
[1:44:48] he is the author and finisher of our
[1:44:51] faith what does an altar do
[1:44:54] an author writes the book
[1:44:57] you don't have control over the book
[1:45:01] the author has already wrote out your
[1:45:04] life
[1:45:05] and at the end of your story he wrote
[1:45:09] victory
[1:45:12] your name has been written down in the
[1:45:15] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:45:18] it's been written
[1:45:20] in the rightful owner's hand and he
[1:45:24] won't let Satan take your name out of
[1:45:27] that book
[1:45:29] I'm in
[1:45:31] yes my brother
[1:45:34] I want to say that now listen
[1:45:36] don't you ever think out of this service
[1:45:38] that I'm giving you a license to sin
[1:45:41] because I'll tell you what
[1:45:47] your very desire has changed I'm not
[1:45:50] saying you won't make a mistake but it
[1:45:52] won't be your desire to make that
[1:45:54] mistake
[1:45:56] so you can't just go around yelling I'm
[1:45:59] a Son of God I'm a Son of God getting
[1:46:01] getting drunk as a skunk you you might
[1:46:03] be a Son of God but you need to come out
[1:46:05] of that and there's a way for you to
[1:46:07] come out of that
[1:46:10] but I want you to know how amazing God
[1:46:12] is
[1:46:14] I can read in Genesis
[1:46:17] plain as day
[1:46:19] I will turn in Genesis and I will see
[1:46:23] Abraham staggering at the promise of God
[1:46:26] I will see him go into a place
[1:46:30] where they say who is that he says
[1:46:32] that's my sister
[1:46:33] that is not my wife that's my sister
[1:46:35] because he got scared he staggered at
[1:46:38] the promise of God when he should have
[1:46:40] had faith
[1:46:43] but he was staggering saying oh no no no
[1:46:45] and then the king says well I'll just
[1:46:47] take Sarah for a while this didn't
[1:46:49] happen once this happened twice
[1:46:52] twice in Genesis
[1:46:55] but then Paul yes my brother in Romans
[1:47:00] will get the inspiration from almighty
[1:47:04] God
[1:47:05] and he will begin to say Abraham
[1:47:07] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:47:13] blessed is the man
[1:47:15] that God will not impute sin
[1:47:22] thank you
[1:47:25] he's got your name written on the Lamb's
[1:47:28] Book of Life Satan will say he staggered
[1:47:31] here she staggered there she made this
[1:47:33] mistake she made that mistake and God
[1:47:36] will look right to you in the face and
[1:47:37] say but they staggered not at the
[1:47:41] promise of almighty God they are perfect
[1:47:45] wow
[1:47:47] brother by him says I'll never be
[1:47:49] perfect and you'll never be perfect but
[1:47:52] we rest in this one thing we have a
[1:47:55] perfect sacrifice
[1:48:01] for the random chance at that woman that
[1:48:04] was in that restaurant he said I began
[1:48:06] to judge her
[1:48:07] she had the the the I can't remember how
[1:48:09] that was but at least she had the blue
[1:48:11] hair the blue fingernails wearing stuff
[1:48:13] that wasn't modest and brother Brandon
[1:48:15] began to say how could you ever God let
[1:48:18] let let my children grow up in this why
[1:48:20] don't you just wipe it off the face of
[1:48:22] the Earth and he said come over here
[1:48:23] real quick and let me show you something
[1:48:25] and he said I began to look at that and
[1:48:27] he said I wasn't sitting like that but
[1:48:29] yet there was still little things that
[1:48:31] were sent you ain't no better than the
[1:48:34] next person don't you ever get that Holy
[1:48:37] Spirit that you're better than the next
[1:48:39] one without the grace of God you're
[1:48:41] nothing
[1:48:42] thank you
[1:48:45] Prince my brother he said I was sitting
[1:48:48] there and every time I would do
[1:48:50] something my sin was headed to the
[1:48:52] throne but Jesus was there
[1:48:56] Hallelujah that's the difference
[1:48:59] he said and every time my sin would go
[1:49:01] there Jesus would get in front of it it
[1:49:03] would hit him and it would hurt him but
[1:49:06] he wasn't blocking my sin from dead to
[1:49:09] the throne he said I would have died if
[1:49:12] it ever got there but Jesus wouldn't let
[1:49:15] it get there
[1:49:17] and they begin to say and he's beginning
[1:49:20] to say oh Father
[1:49:21] oh Father for I want to know I want you
[1:49:24] to know wherever you are tonight let me
[1:49:27] show you how to get out of brother
[1:49:28] random said oh Father forgive me
[1:49:33] forget not all his benefits yes my
[1:49:36] brother he forgives us of all our sins
[1:49:38] all our iniquities
[1:49:42] he would say father forgive me and he
[1:49:45] said he took that blood from his side
[1:49:47] and wrote on their pardon that's what
[1:49:50] our provider does when we couldn't save
[1:49:53] ourselves when we couldn't set ourselves
[1:49:56] free we had a provider
[1:50:00] foreign
[1:50:01] [Applause]
[1:50:07] sins and through it in the sea
[1:50:12] of God's Great forgetfulness that's what
[1:50:14] I want to say we can read in Genesis and
[1:50:17] the carnal in the colonel mine in our
[1:50:19] carnal flesh where Abraham staggered at
[1:50:21] The Presence at the at the promise of
[1:50:23] God
[1:50:24] but in his obituary
[1:50:26] it was wrote Abraham staggered not at
[1:50:29] the promise of God and Satan will come
[1:50:31] up and say you're a failure you're no
[1:50:33] good you'll never make it unless what
[1:50:35] maybe he even found one of your mistakes
[1:50:37] and he brought it before almighty God
[1:50:39] but guess what when you repented and it
[1:50:41] went under that blood and God wrote
[1:50:43] pardoned on it and threw it behind him
[1:50:45] he could God said what are you talking
[1:50:46] about Satan and Satan goes under false
[1:50:49] accusation because he's lying about you
[1:50:52] we are the free yet sir liberated yes
[1:50:56] Sons and Daughters amen God bless you in
[1:50:59] Jesus name Jesus come back

[2:28:21] I didn't want to say it but I'm going to
[2:28:23] say it
[2:28:27] a name of a minister came to my mind
[2:28:32] to preach tonight
[2:28:36] and I took the text message
[2:28:38] and I wrote to that minister
[2:28:41] and I opened my text message
[2:28:45] in my mind
[2:28:47] that's the minister I was sending the
[2:28:49] message
[2:28:51] and I took the text I put it and I send
[2:28:53] it
[2:28:55] and after a while I went back I opened a
[2:28:58] look
[2:29:00] it was not the minister I was thinking
[2:29:04] the text message went to brother said
[2:29:07] coffee
[2:29:12] and brother said responded back he say I
[2:29:15] am available to preach
[2:29:18] I know it's God
[2:29:24] okay so just know he's not here by
[2:29:27] mistake
[2:29:29] I was looking at this direction and God
[2:29:32] changed my mind unconsciously to send a
[2:29:36] message in what we can call
[2:29:39] a wrong direction
[2:29:42] but I'm telling you that so when you go
[2:29:45] home

[2:29:55] do with a human being
[2:29:59] okay it is God that sent him here
[2:30:03] to tell you something
[2:30:06] and you heard him he didn't want to
[2:30:08] preach
[2:30:10] and God took him
[2:30:12] because God wants him
[2:30:15] to be the one he's going to use tonight
[2:30:19] to bring you your deliverance
