your love for your mercy for every and Gathering us all together here as a Christian family to celebrate Lord father this Union between Joseph and Josephine Lord father without you we can do nothing Lord that's why Lord father we pray that you move us completely out of the way may you be the one coming down lord father and joining this couple together together because What the Lord Has Done no one can put it as father we commit it all unto th hand and humbly ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen who gave this woman to be wife to this man the congregation may be seated praise God we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and on behalf of the families and the church we welcome you to this marriage ceremony joining Joseph and Josephine Wilson I will now invite you to the reading of the scripture my scripture will be in Genesis very familiar scripture chapter 1 verse 25 all the way to 26 the Bible says in verse 25 and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creth upon the Earth after his kind and God so that he was good and God say let us not let me let us when you say us it means it's more than one person God say let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so man even though it's singular it's plural man is male and female according to the scripture amen and in verse 28 the Bible say and God bless them and say unto them not unto him unto them he say be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth in Genesis 5 verse 1 the Bible says the same thing about this uh event here of the creation of man the Bible says in verse one this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man M an singular in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam so Adam is not a name of man only according to the scripture when God say Adam he's calling both a male and a female together but God didn't say Adams not a plural he say Adam because both of them are one the Bible say he called their name Adam in the day when they were created now my subject in the next few minutes is the restoration marriage and as the restoration of the complete image marriage as the restoration of the complete image in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says that and the Lord God form men not created because God already created man in Genesis 1:26 and the man that was created in genesis6 was a spirit because the Bible say in the Book of John chapter 4 that God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in the truth and in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says and the Lord God formed Men Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living Soul surprisingly in Genesis 2 when God created man we only see a man a male there was there was no female there while in Genesis 1: 126 when he created man there was a female and a male but in Genesis 2 we we saw one entity only appearing which was a man and in Genesis 2 Verse 18 the Bible says and the Lord God say it was not man it's God who said and the Lord God say it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help made for him the question is if it's not good for man to be alone who created man alone it was God himself that created man alone so if God knew that it was not good for man to be alone why did he created man alone to begin with did he make a mistake God forbid amen the Bible says in Isaiah 46:10 that God declared the end from the beginning in other words God knows everything and according to Isaiah 55:8 the Bible say for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways say the Lord so God when he does things there is a mystery connected to it there is a message there is something that is hidden behind it that's why Paul in Roman 11:33 Paul say oh the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgment and his way past finding out God hide these things to the wise and to The Prudent and God will reveal his secret to babes such as we want to learn why did God create male in Genesis 2 one entity instead of two because in the beginning when God was creating everything that God made was a pair in the message marriage and divorce preaching in 1965 in February the 21st in the morning in paragraph 91 brother Bram say if Jesus say go back to the beginning there was only one pair of anything on Earth there was one Adam one Eve they were join by God Alone one female horse one male one female parot one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there was only a pair of everything amen if you notice even when God wanted to destroy this world with water when God gave Noah the instruction to bring the animal into the ark the animal were brought male and female together are we together even when Samson in the time of the Harvest of a wheat when he wanted to destroy the field of the Philistine the bible say that Samson went and he caught 300 foxes and he divided them in two and took two by two and he used fire brand and put them ta to tail and send them into the into the uh crop of the philistine in order to destroy the world so whatever God is looking for is to find two a young couple a good couple that God himself can join together and God can put the fire brand of the fire of the Holy Spirit and send you in this world and you can bring the Gospel wherever you going breathing out the spirit of the Lord and showing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever destroying the world work of the devil amen according to Ecclesiastes verse 4 that two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift his fellow but woe this is the scripture woe to him that is alone that's why God say it is not good for Brother Joseph to be alone amen woe unto Brother Joseph when you are alone if you fall there is no one to help you up this help doesn't need Mama this help doesn't need daddy this help needs you in a female version he need a help that is meat for you and the Bible say woe unto him that is alone when he fth for he has not another to help him up verse 11 again if two lie together then they get hit but how can one be warm alone and if a one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken amen so man when he was created in Genesis 2 God created man as a male alone then God found out that it was not good for this male to be alone because when God called the creature the Beast he bring them he brought them to Adam he say Adam go ahead and name them and Adam gave name to all the creature that God brought unto him but there was no creature that Adam call woman that's why the scripture is against man a human being maing with animal because Adam named all the animal but he could not find an animal that looked like him he could not find a creature a creation that looked like him but God took Adam and put him to sleep let's put it together God took Brother Joseph and put him to sleep and God pulled from Brother Joseph a piece which is called a rib and begin to manufacture sister josephin and God brought sister josephin himself it is not man who brought the woman it was God himself that took the the woman back to the man because at the beginning in Genesis 1:26 when Man was created he was already male and female and if you notice in Genesis 1:26 there was no marriage ceremony because they were already joined together by God but in Genesis 2:7 because man was put in the flesh and separated from his briad so in order to keep the image of God which God created man in his own image male and female meaning that God himself is male and female that's why Christ himself has a bread in the Book of Revelation the Bible say come and see the Lamb's wife which is the brde of Jesus Christ to create and to keep that image that entity together God initiated marriage so what is marriage it is the bringing back of the two entities together what is marriage it is the bringing back of the woman back to her original position What is marriage it is the bringing back of Brother Joseph and sister Josephine back together as they used to be in eternity they came from eternity they step in time and they were split together but through the bonds of marriage now today brother Joseph and sister Josephine are going to find themselves back again and what God have joined together let no one put it as under it won't be two entity but he will be only one let's give the Lord a big clap [Applause] offering in the message the door inside the door brother Bram says this in paragraph 6 in preaching 1960 brother brandham say then I always have a little slogan as I say to the people that are married you see the young couple look at them young Amen brother Bram say you see the young couple and they come up before me I always think of Christ and his Brad the great wedding supper that we are all anxious to attend and to see them there they are young Youth and their brother eyes as they are standing there to take this vow to bur them through life Journey always say to them something like this now you want to be happy and you cannot be happy without Christ there is no home happy without Christ I just want you to show me one you have some make believe but you can't be happy without Christ and this is what I'm going to tell you you won't be happy in your marriage without Christ amen if you want your marriage to succeed amen you need to have Christ Paul says that those that marry will have trouble in the flesh it means that when you get married things may get tougher a little bit in the message the stature of a perfect man in paragraph 44 brother brandham say now right now before you are married everything is just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toys and the trials of Life come in that is when you got to be so in love that you understand one another when you are disappointed in her she is disappointed in you you still understand one another and my advice to the young couple the first miracle and the beginning of the miracle of Jesus Christ happen in a marriage in a wedding day why did christ choose out of every sin any event into the world before God begin to display his power in the ministry of Jesus Christ he only chose a wedding day because marriage is special before God Amen the bible say that Jesus was invited and we want Jesus to be invited in your marriage because a three-fold code cannot be easily broken amen when Jesus was invited and a need was found in the marriage Jesus provided we want Jesus in your marriage because there is no marri marriage no happiness in the marriage without Christ being in the middle amen God richly bless you that was the exaltation glory to God [Music] I'd like to write a song about our love and all the precious moments we have shared till now but I'd rather ride about our Lord above cuz it was him who brought this Union all [Music] about this love is his love he formed it from the Star brought us
