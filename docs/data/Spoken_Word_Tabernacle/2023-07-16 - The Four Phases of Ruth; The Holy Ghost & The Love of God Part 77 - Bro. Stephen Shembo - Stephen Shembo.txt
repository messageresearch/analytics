amen Lord's will in this coming uh Saturday July the 22nd we will have a question and answer originally we planned the question and answer to be here in the church but God it will be raining we already checked the weather so the Lord opened up the way that we will have it in a clubhouse not where we usually have it but it's a separate place it's close to brother Jim's home so just watch over look at your message be on the lookup we'll send you the the address and you should be there amen amen it's a 2 30 question and answer not here in church let me check it praise God praise God praise

evil we got everything confirmed it's at 2 30 and it will be a Brother Kelly's home so make sure you're there on time we need five hours that we can sit and talk amen there were some young man 12 years old if I'm not mistaken I wanted to be there but it's a little bit too young so we start at 14. years old and up 12 years we might have your meeting separately amen amen so 14 years old enough July 29th at 2 30 at Brother Kelly's home so we will send the address again just to make sure everybody got the address I need to deal with a subject quickly because I don't trust cell phone and I don't trust the youth age nowadays with everything that is going on it's crazy and it's really really messy up there amen I don't trust the devil at all so I will deliver what I have to deliver and for the remaining it is between you and God and your blood is not on my hand amen so July 29th a Brother Kelly's home July the 22nd is coming Saturday question and answer on July the 23rd which is this coming Sunday we will have brother Keith Reed from Jamaica he will be preaching for us next Sunday in the morning amen do you know brother Keith pretty good he preached for us here already he will be coming around for the meeting so next Sunday he will be preaching back on the Saturday that's when we have a question and answer for the young sisters your uh meeting will be on August the 26th amen amen glory be to the name of the Lord I don't know if somebody slept good tonight amen Lord's will and you pray for me I will try to see if on Wednesday I will pick up on that will be done on prayer we already have Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name last Wednesday we got the kingdom come I believe everybody understand that so I will try to see by God's grace here from Wednesday we will pick up that will be done so we can continue to move until we get the prayer uh part covered amen sister Arcos is doing well by God's grace just getting used to uh the new organ transplant and I felt like I did my heart I don't know where this is coming from or the Lord or it's National or it's local or it's International I don't know but I have to mention something about transplant because we gave a testimony about transplant but maybe somebody's wondering what does the prophet say about organ transplant what does the scripture says about it to me first it's a testimony if you were suffering for 13 years and they give you one you will be praising the Lord amen but whoever was struggling with that question I'm gonna help you up stabilize you in the scripture and in the message of the hour amen we good this is what the Bible says amen glory to God this is what the Bible says in the book of Galatians chapter 4 verse 13 Paul say you know how true infirmity because Paul has an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at first and my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despise not in other words they didn't look down on Paul because he had suffering amen nor rejected but receive me as an angel of what God Paul was received as an angel of God so if you have a problem receiving brother Branham as an angel of God that's your problem me I believe him as the angel of God he say and we receive me as an angel of God even as who Christ Jesus am I reading a different Bible if you have a problem you open your scripture and you verify they receive Paul as Jesus Christ I'm reading the Bible please open your scripture open your scripture because when I read the Bible here it's appearing like I have a different Bible I'm still using the same old Bible amen open your scripture and you need your Bible because I'm going to navigate to the Bible everybody okay let's go to Galatians chapter 4 verse 15. uh verse 14. if you dare you can say Amen I went to sleep probably later than all of you I was sleeping at 3 30. and I'm here this morning so you should be alive amen you should be more stronger than me amen amen my temptation is that correct which was in my flesh you despise not nor water rejected but receive me as an angel of who God even as who Christ they received Paul as Christ Jesus amen because Paul was representing Jesus Christ and William Branham represented Jesus Christ the message is Christ and the message and the messenger I won that's it my friend where is then the blessedness you speak of for I bear you record that if he had been possible you would have done water plant out your own eyes and have given them to her everybody okay so Paul said if he was possible in his time the believer could have plucked out their eyes and give it to Paul so that Paul can use that eye because Paul had a problem with his eyes since the pillar of fire struck him so Paul already mentioned a bad organ transplant can you say amen amen okay William Marion Branham so I can go to my sermon this becoming a very water wonderful wonderful can you give him more volume please since somebody's not dead level of saying amen he got it okay this become a very wonderful water thing to work on human water body we appreciate that what do you appreciate they can transfer water and I from one man to water another take those tiny little cord and take an eye out of a man's socket and place it over into another man's socket and that man can see from water that is how wonderful whole thing so there is nothing wrong with organ transplanting Paul spoke about the transfer of an eye and William Mayon Branham spoke about the transfer of an eye because brother Branham say I preach like Paul [Applause] the message and the scripture are perfectly in order brother Branham give you this and never give you a scripture but the spirit that worked with brother Branham I'm talking about myself he's also working with me I am not going to be a new messenger I am under brother Branham but the anointing is flowing through me that's why it's giving me scripture to back up the message of the hour because the message in the Bible are one [Applause] everybody clear everybody created so whoever had a problem with organ transplant I believe you got your answer God richly bless you if you were calling to if you were wondering to learn the Lord has answered your prayer but if you had the night to criticize your mouth is going to be shut [Applause] let's go to our scripture this morning when I say your mouth is going to be shut you don't understand what I'm saying read brother Branham and you would know what I'm talking about let's go to Ezekiel 36. glory to God Hallelujah Ezekiel 36 verse 24. you need to keep your Bible because we will travel to certain things there were things that are taught a long time and if you don't go slowly it's hard to correct them like we mentioned like we dealt with prosperity now you understand that Prosperity is not just about money Prosperity affect every aspect of our life amen but when they say Prosperity Everybody Run Away and then yet your whole life what you're doing is after money a lot of pretense in the message Ezekiel 36 verse 24 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says this for I would take you from The Hidden and gather you out of the countries and will bring you into your own land you might be seated so somebody who's out of order everybody okay somebody was not in the promised land somebody was out and God says you are outside you're not in your right position you are not in order so I will come and take you from out of order and bring you back into the Promised Land so somebody was outside the Promised Land amen outside the promised land amen and God promised to bring them in the promising and we know what the promised land means spiritually right we went through disorders Canon means it means the Holy Ghost amen so somebody didn't have the Holy Ghost and God want to bring them back into the promised land that's right amen and watch the bringing back into the promised land when you look at this scripture you will find out you will think that God is bringing them to a natural land because the Bible says you were not in a promised land and you are coming into the promised land because scripture got compound meaning the first way you look at it is somebody moving from a country to another country but watch how the scripture is bringing them to the promised land verse 25 then we last sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from your water filthiness does it mean that Israel was not taking a bath you see that it's a different promise line because you will think God is standing there with a big pipe and when the Jews are coming he's praying watching them like in a car wash everybody okay that's not the case God is spoken about God is talking here about a change spiritually he say I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean you shall be clean from all your filthiness so this art of other place they were in filthiness amen so somebody was filthy and God before they bring them down there want to spray clean water and we know according to Ephesians the washing of the World by the word so there will come a word that will come to you and that word will clean you up Amen in preparation toward the Promised Land so in preparation toward the promised land there is a water not just the water but it's a clean water that God will sprinkle upon you and we know that water according to Ephesians is the word that we there will come a word to clean you from your filthiness amen as you're going into the Promised Land and the Bible continues Ezekiel says and from all your adults we like cleanse you it's the filthiness and others let me put that together so we don't leave anything there amen verse 26 a new heart I thought we are going to the promised land you want to clean us with water now it's a heart transplant everybody okay a new heart amen will I give you so God when he's bringing Israel out from their filthiness into the promised land amen he says that he's going to wash them he will cleanse them he doesn't mean they were not taking a bath we already understood that but God is targeting one place are you following me the place that God is targeting is the heart to be restored these people were in the promised lands and they left the promised land restoration means to bring back everybody okay and to restore God his restoration Target the heart I will send you a word I will send you a larger the prophet who will turn the water you understand now so the restoration always Target the heart because if the heart is not restored amen it is just a physical act Israel left Egypt physically amen and they were going into the Wilderness whenever anything happened we remember what we were eating in Egypt we need to go back to Egypt amen their body was taken off of Egypt but their heart was still in Egypt everybody okay God saw that already he said I'm bringing these people back again to the promised land but if I don't Target the heart amen they will come with all this filthiness and adult into the message amen amen so the target to come to the promised land is the heart follow me carefully amen I will give you a new heart verse 26 will I give you and a new spirit we love put within you we went through this in this series and I would take away the Stony heart so the heart that have filthiness and other is a Stony heart in other words you can hit as much as you can hit nothing happened it's a Stony heart right here so God realized I'm bringing people with Stony heart if I put them in the promised land there will be Jews with Stony heart in the message that's it you can preach all you want they have their own agenda they're not going to change so I need to Target the problem and the problem is the heart everybody okay and I would take away the Heart of Stone the Stony heart out of your flesh a transplant clear another scripture for transplant amen is your Bible different than mine okay I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and will give you a heart of water flesh so God will change heart what does changing heart means everybody okay watch verse 27 and I will put my spirit within you so God don't just change heart everybody okay but God wants to put his Spirit within us why so to go in the promised land follow me it was not a natural going it is a going into receiving the Holy Ghost it is a journey from a Stony Heart To A Heart of Flesh that is filled with the Holy Spirit so if you make it to the promised land remember last Sunday it means that God have changed everything and giving you the Holy Ghost why do you need the Holy Ghost in Canaan why amen verse 27 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to do water walk in my statues so what will make you walk in this word of God who are you afraid [Music] hold this my friend we can preach also together hey everybody okay thank you so when you get into the promised land amen God wants to give you the Holy Ghost why does he want us to have the Holy Ghost there must be a purpose and the purpose is what he said that and cause you to the worker walk in my statute why because God figured out that whatever he's doing with the Lord doesn't work he gives the law the people are going out he gives the Lord the people are going now God found out that the only way you can leave the law it takes the spirit of God and let me say this the only way you will leave this message is only by the Holy Spirit if the holy spirit is not in your life this message is a burden it's a religion it is something that you suffer all the time this message is legalistic you feel like you in prison all the time it's a lack of Holy Ghost [Applause] amen amen amen so why do we need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost so that we will walk in my statute everybody here to walk to keep and to do the will of God or the word of God or the Commandment of God you must have the Holy Ghost to our king is not your walking because your walking was a hypocritical walking he was a religious walking you are working to please your husband [Applause] you were walking to please your wife you were walking to please your parents because you need favor from your parents and your parents wants you to believe the message so you gotta do everything to please your parent so you can continue to gain their favor come on but it's not God working in you everybody okay but when the spirit of the Lord comes in you God himself begin to do the walking God himself begin to keep his word God himself begin to do his word in other words I walk by faith they walk they're keeping and they're doing is not you anymore you are in Auto palate my friend that's right amen amen keep that in mind the reason why God wants you to have his spirit he will ask without his spirit the law is a burden so God is coming so that he himself can walk according to his word because God will never deviate from the word God himself will keep his word even if you don't want to keep he he will keep his word his word will never return vote to him and the reason why and the doing the action in your life won't be you anymore it will be the Holy Spirit reacting and acting in your life don't you love the Holy Ghost yes sir Amen in other words if you want to make your life easy in this church come on if you want to have your life easy in this message get the Holy Ghost glory to God amen now when the Holy Ghost comes you begin to walk in his way you begin to keep his commandment you begin to do his will what follows the Holy Ghost remember the Holy Ghost is only a zero point what father the Holy Ghost everybody here why does the Holy Ghost want you to walk according to his commandment why do or does the Holy Ghost want you to keep the message why does the Holy Ghost want you to do the message why if you stay up he will help you today yes sir amen why why what is the benefit job to verse uh 28. and ye and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be water my people and I will be water your God after the Holy Ghost come on you God begin to remember remember if those that are my people and are called by my name when you pray God listen because he knows who's praying everybody okay you shall be my people and I will be water because me and you we can set we can synchronize now when I'm going to the left you understand why I'm going to the left that's right everybody okay watch verse 29 I will also save you from all your water uncleanness and I will call for the corn and I will call for the corn and will water

the other amen I cannot carry this bottle without the water amen and I cannot carry this bow this water alone without the body they will be on the floor I need the border and the water anybody okay so

your soul with your mind and the loving of one another is a great commandment amen follow me carefully I'm begging you amen brother Branham said in the message turning northward love one another Jesus say this will all men know that you are my disciple when you get love one for who another this is when all men will know that you are my disciple you get love one for what the other that is the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost that are North amen amen amen let's go slowly when you can love yes sir that is the water commandment the great commandment great thing do you speak with tongues of men an angel and have not water love a profit if you water nothing brother Branham says the greatest evidence that you got the Holy Ghost is when you are fulfilling the great commandment amen

you following me come on Amen are you following me Amen in other words without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no way for you to love God the way he wanted that's it amen and there is no way for you to love your brother the correct way we have our own self-love that's right amen our love is the love when everything you do matches what I want Lord Jesus if you rub me the wrong way our love is finished that's right I'm your good pastor because I'm doing what you're expecting me to do the day I will rebuke you I'm no longer a good pastor that's right amen amen amen that's our own love but the love of God is different amen but you cannot do that if the holy spirit is not in you add the word to fulfill the greatest commandment you must have the Holy Ghost that's right amen Amen brother Stephen why do we need the Holy Ghost what is the holy ghost coming to do in our life let's go to First John chapter 2. father help me if I don't get where I want to go that's fine but I want this church to understand this message believer created our own love our love goes with our gender the day my agenda and your agenda don't meet together I'm a wrong pastor I was the good pastor all day long until until I rebuke you [Music] I was a good brother all along I was a good sister all along until I told you I can't help you then I'm a bad sister then everything you spoke all the testimony you have for me all these years you dump it in one day Jesus that's the love we have in this message it's filled those love are filled you can you can smell that everywhere in the message Jesus among preacher oh you can even smell it hypocritical love Jesus you there amen Amen to love God correctly and to love one another brother brand I'm saying it's the greatest evidence that you have the water holy ghost in other words without the Holy Ghost you won't fulfill this amen let's go to First John chapter two if you there you can say amen amen verse 9 everybody there my brother get ready please he that says he is in the life who believe that he's living in the light can I see your hand so we all believe that we're in the LIE right right you didn't raise your hand so you're not in the light that's your problem okay all right he does say he is in the light and hurts his brother is where in darkness even until now so there is no way you can be in the light of the Holy Spirit hating your brother that's right amen I'm reading the Bible jump to verse 10. he that loves his brother a Bible so for you to really love your brother the way God wants you to do you must be in the light amen I'm going slowly what we're doing is our preferences and our Affinity we much pray the good and we think we love one another so much until something happened but if it's a true love even if something happened you will stay together amen you will sit with your brother you will sit with your sister you will talk things over you will iron things up and you will continue and you will even love one another better than before that's right amen because you know one another better amen amen we I'm not talking about click love that's it brother amen because it's feeling this message clicks love amen everybody okay job two verse 10 and he that love of his brother abandoned the light and there is no occasion of stumbling where in him but he that hate his brother is in darkness and walk well in darkness and knows not where he goes because that Darkness has planted his water what I'm trying to drive here there is no love without you being in the light amen what you're doing is human love everybody okay you bearing humanly speaking everybody okay to laugh correctly you must be in the light let's go to verse chapter 3. go to chapter three you dare you can say Amen verse 13 if you dare you can say amen amen you there chapter 3 verse 14 I'm sorry we know that we have passed from Death on to life because we water love so a man that have been quickened by the Holy Spirit automatically love his brother amen amen because that's the way you know that you pass from death and to life I'm reading the Bible please everybody okay love the present he that loves not his brother a bad fuel are you reading with me job to verse 15 whosoever hate his brother he is a water murderer so if you hate me you will murder amen amen and you know that no murderer has water eternal life in other words the one who hate people have no eternal life amen I don't know if you understanding me if you see a strong headed in this message there is no eternal life amen you need to examine yourself to see if you got the Holy Ghost and that you have been claiming that you have all along amen amen that's it amen he that love uh verse 15 and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding where in him so eternal life when he bads in you you will automatically love when the Holy Ghost come in you it will make you love God and love water everybody okay so far let's go to chapter four we started chapter two now chapter three now chapter four look at your scripture please you want first John chapter four verse seven if you dare you can say Amen father help me out you there you there amen beloved my brother Angel let us love one another for love is of water so if God is not there where did you get that love I'm going slowly if God is not there where did you get that love God love comes from God I'm going slowly he said for love is of God and everyone that loves is what so if you are not born of God you cannot love I'm going slowly okay in other words it's the holy ghost that will bring you love I know where I'm heading and knows God to know him his life verse 8 he that loves not knows not God for God is what so when the Holy Ghost get in you who get in you that's why you begin to love God that's why you begin to love one another I'm going slowly everybody okay everybody good job to verse 11 beloved if God so loved us we ought to also love water everybody okay no man has seen God and Edina if we love one another God dwells way do you see so how do you know God dwell in you look at the hatred we have in this message let me continue he said God dwell in us and his love is perfected where watch verse 13 very good you there hereby know we that we dwell in him and he wear in us because he has given us of what everybody clear so when the Holy Ghost come in you he automatically brings the love of God I know where I'm heading may God help me out job to verse 16. and we know we have known and believe the love that God has to us God is what my friend love and he that dwell in love dwell in and God in him [Music] do we have to argue with this that's why brother Branham say the greatest evidence that he knows of the Holy Spirit is for you to love one another because there is no way you can love God and don't love your brother the two Commandments are connected I want that in this church this church is not a place for clicks this is a whole family our nationalities has nothing to do with us yes sir it is not an American Church it is not an African church it is not the European Church it is a Church of the Living God and we should treat one another as a family amen amen everybody create everybody clears and respect our differences everybody okay everybody okay job to verse uh 20. if a man say I love God and do what he is what for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loves God love his water that's why Jesus said this is a great commandment and the second is unto like unto the everybody okay the point I was driving here is to show you that when the Holy Spirit Come he is the one that bring love because God wants you to love him with all your heart all your man all your soul and God wants you to love his brother his children how are you gonna do that without the Holy Spirit what are you driving my friend everybody okay everybody good listen to what Paul says glory to God Jesus said on these two Commandments hang the water and the water so if you love you have fulfilled the law you don't need the law anymore the love of the Commandment with that love is a legalistic the message of William Marion Branham without the love of God will be a hard message for you to live because the whole message is perfect love the message itself is perfect love [Music] so with that love you can leave the message Jesus Christ look at Paul watch this Paul again in Roman oh no men anything but water love one another so you owe me love and he that love it now that has done what to fulfill the law what's the Commandment for this that shall not commit adultery that shall not kill that shall not steal that shall not bail for witness that shall not covet if there be any other water in other words Paul is saying whatever commandment is left that I have not uh I mean quoted here all the Commandments Paul said it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely that shall love their neighbor as water in other words every commandment of the Old Testament can be summarized in one commandment that's a love your neighbor as what and that shall love your neighbor as yourself is connected to do to that shall love the Lord your God if you do those two things you don't need the law anymore because the law become you love worketh no ill to his water neighbor therefore love is the Fulfillment of water why do we need this love father helped me up the way our heart were created our hard work created wrong that's why God said we had got a Stony heart and brother Branham say a stormy heart is a worldly heart it's a sinful heart there is a snake there your desires are wrong everybody okay so God has to attack the heart because out of your heart come the issues of your life that's the center of everything that is the real you follow me carefully but Jeremiah says this circumcise yourself to the Lord you ready my friend and take away the false skin of your water your heart verify your Bible so our heart have a foreskin I'm reading the Bible I'm reading the Bible false King is a Nexus flesh wow that's why we say that's why we see come says mayor because we are born with excess flesh it is disturbing it is too much that's why they have to see concert they have to cut the Surplus off and Jeremiah said your heart also has a foreskin that's why God said you must circumcise your heart I'm going slowly my friend in that the word when you are born in this world you have access you are born with sin [Applause] with iniquity God has to cut the bad part of you out that's fun listen Roman 2 28. for he is not a Jew which is where our worldly of the flesh neither is that circumcision which is at work in the water flesh but he is a Jew which is where inward ly and see completion is that of death all right so the Holy Ghost is the one that circumcision [Music] do you follow me so when the spirit of the Lord enter into you you follow me he cut he's chopping a part of you and he's removing it why follow me amen not in the leader whose praise is not of men but of who God Colossians 2 in whom also circumcised with the circumcision made without it's not human in putting off the body of what of the water the flesh by the circumcision of Hope Christ so when class come in you he look at where is that sin I got him when Jesus looked this one came from his grandfather he was a drunker that's why he drinks like this his father was a smoker this is coming from his uncle he's a mother son God pulled them together and he cut it off do you follow me something is left what is left follow me carefully Deuteronomy 10 verse 15. she come says therefore the full skin of your water and be no more water because God wants you to fulfill his commandment he wants you to love him how before your heart with all this your soul and we follow your mind to do that you must have the Holy Ghost watch what uh Deuteronomy said and the Lord that God will circumcise the water so who's doing the circumcision and the Heart of that This Promise shall be unto you and unto your children in the Old Testament the promise of the Holy Ghost God shall circumcise your heart and your heart of your children the promise shall be given unto you and to your children and as far do you see in the Old Testament he shall circumstance that heart and the Heart of the seed to do what that God will father and we thought that so that she made water so to circumcise your heart is for the Holy Spirit to bring the love of God in your heart amen why is this love important everybody okay Colossians says 3 3 14 and above all things put on Water charity which is love which is the pound of water perfectness when the Holy Ghost come in your life do you follow me when God enter into you God chopped the world off of you amen and God marries you I'm going slowly and God needs some bonds so that you and him can never be separated the bond God used is the love of God God dispatched his love and his love hold you and you and God fuse together and you become one in other words they can never take God out of you without taking you off because the Rapture is God coming to pick up the Holy Ghost back so when God is picking up the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost is coming back to God you also are going with your promises I don't know if you're getting me so the Holy Ghost when he comes he brings a bond and blends you with God so that you and God become United and become one that's why Paul says it's the bond of perfectness there is no marriage like this marriage it is a marriage that you and God are one that's why the Bible say if you love the world and the things after it means that the love of God is not even water in you it means that you are not touched to correctly do you follow me do you follow me so when the Holy Spirit Come it Blends you and tighten you why do you need that Bond let's go to Roman 8. father help me brother Kelly I can't reach where I'm going yeah I gotta stop somewhere let me see if I can stop here I might have to change the title let's go to Roman 8 if you there you can say Amen Romans 8. Hallelujah Roman 8. verse 28 because the Bible says that the love with the world is enmity with Christ it's in James 4 4. let me tighten up here and then we can stop somewhere because this is a teaching we got to go slowly Romans 8 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and we know that water all things work together for good to them that water love God do you see that how do you love God to love God you need what you need toward the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost come in your life and he bring the bunch of perfection between you and Jesus Christ everything in your life is working together for good I don't know if you hated me in other words that love have a purpose Lord help me to them that are called according to his water so God had a purpose then God calls you when God calls you he doesn't stay there he enter into you and he Bland with you by bringing his love why you there verse 29 for whom he did what for no he also did water to be conformed to the image of his Waters sir that he might be the first man among water many brothers he is the first one so now he's creating breathing he's God he's creating a mature God but he is the top can I continue moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he has called he down water justify and whom he justified he has water glorify so when God entered into you and blind with you God is kissing you and telling you that whatever I heard about you is over [Applause] that's what brother Branham said it means that you never done anything to begin with in other words God is is Justified removing everything let me ask you this there is a woman a sister you know her very well the sister you saw her with the first boy second boy third one you have even their picture you even keep a record when she posts you pick it up when she posts you pick it up when she posts you pick it up one of this day you see that girl's coming and give her life to God you have all her record you say she slept with seven boys everybody okay and here come a young man that you think should not bury that woman the young man should marry the one that is over there and you talk to the young man you say be careful with that one that one she was that's another rehab my friend she was all along with both a health proof look at this look at and the young man say yes I understand I saw it I saw it she was a bad woman okay then few months you learned that they said thank you my friend and you heard that the same boy everybody okay that you were explaining everything and giving all the detail is quoting that same girl what are you gonna do and then they give the date of the marriage and they invite you there [Music] everybody okay and on the day of marriage you see that boy kissing that woman in other words the boy is telling the woman whatever I've heard about you I have dumped it down and I made my decision to love you and love causes a multitude of sin [Applause] and the Book of Proverbs say that Love cover all sin in other word when God bring his love to you he's wiping everything amen [Music] you can keep what you know about me but God doesn't remember because he goes to the Sea of God's unforgiveness [Applause] that's why when you are true truly receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the love of God he breaks the complex off from your life when you dance you dancing with pride because you know nothing [Applause] let me stop here because if I push it deeper okay let me stop here let's go to ruminate remind me brother Caleb change this with the Holy Ghost and the love of God then I will come back to the resources and we see why everybody okay we are justified in verse 30 verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if God be water if that boy is for me if the boy that you gossip that you saw my bad picture you show him my picture in pant you show him my picture when I was smoking if that boy is for me [Applause] you better find another church because when I'm coming to church I will always hug him like this [Applause] [Music] as he didn't look upon my fault he looked beyond my fault and so my need all right [Applause] you disqualify me but he qualify me you thought I was a nobody he saw something good out of me he saw me as a somebody and he giving me the privilege to be his mother the mother of his children if I remember what I did and how the church gossip about me and that young man regardless of the gossip still marry me how would I love that young man [Applause] [Music] who can separate me from the love of thy young man this is what I'm about to read who can separate me for the man that pass on my mistake and still come and get me that is what I'm driving [Applause] let's go to verse 31 what shall we say then this thing if God be for who us who shall be water against them who are you if God qualified me who are you [Applause] if God put me in this Pulpit to be a pastor who are you what is your opinion Gonna Change I'd want me to be this in my life who are you [Applause] because when the ways of men pleases God he even put a peace his enemy [Applause] [Music] let's go my friend let's finish here he that spelled not his own hope son but deliver him up for who how shall he not also do what freely give us all things freely give us water some things [Music] amen Amen in other words when my husband is with me and I say honey I need to eat I want you to take me out come again and stand there and tell him not to take me come and tell him come again and tell him go again and gossip about me everybody okay who shall lay anything to the charge of water it is God that did water who is he that help me my brother it is Christ that who did water yeah rather that is what who is even at the right hand of who and who's making water in other words Jesus not only justifies you but he put himself in the position that when he you make a mistake he's pleading for you so that nobody says nothing in other words you are full coverage [Applause] that's why you no longer want a sin not because it is a commandment but because of what you see what he did for you as an appreciation to his love now you wanna please him in what you're doing that's the message of William Marion Branham that is perfect love [Applause] cast out [Music] my friend he said who shall water separate us from heart because love is the bond of perfectness it is an eternal Bond when you are glue you hitched forever who can separate if God bonded something who can debond who can separate us from the water shall water tribulation in other words a true man or a woman that is born of the spirit of God tribulation won't do nothing to him when you going to try the love of God is stop giving you strength that's why the Holy Spirit establishes the love but you still love the husband let's go my friend please who shall separate us from the water Love Of Christ child water tribulation all water distress all water persecution oh water feminine or water nakedness or water or water swords jump to verse 37 nay in all these things we are water more than conquerors through him that did water Father Brown I'm saying more than conqueror because he already conquered you don't have to conquer you are only taking into position let's go my friend 38 for I am water persuaded that neither yes no life no angels nor principal nor powers nor presently oh no no any other creature shall be able to do whatever from the water the love of God which is in her that's why the Holy Ghost bring you love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whatever they can bring against this message don't work because I'm in love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the greatest evidence is the love the love of God and to love it takes the Holy Spirit to bring the love of God to circumcise the flesh I will get to Romans 5 later on down the road amen and when the Holy Ghost come he brings the bond of perfection God before he start giving you everything he in other words he take you like brother Branham say I love my wife so much that I can take her and put her into myself so the love of God take you and put you into God until if somebody you get married the people talk about you the day of marriage You Came the boy love you he marry you when you going do you care who is gossiping about you [Music] let me make it clear especially if that boy is well established if he's wealthy he's a rich boy and he said you know what honey I need to make a surprise for you let me get you a Mercedes and when you're driving the Mercedes and everybody's saying look at her do you care because you care about the one that love you the one that give you the car the Holy Ghost wanna make sure when he gets him before we move into deep territory let me lock you in me so that no matter what is happening you are mine you are stabilized you won't look to the left you won't look to the right because I'm gonna start blessing your life into different aspects but before I start the blessing before I start affecting your life let me block you to myself so that you will never change my mind because I'm gonna give you the secret of the Deadpool and the devil cannot create and if I give it to you you can turn your back to me because that secret can never be given to the devil so let me pull you into Masada and bring you into the bond of perfectness let's stop here we will pick up later God bless you let's learn [Applause] remember where we stop but we will come back to Faith and love the Holy Spirit coming and he has a purpose God has a purpose God wants to remove that Stony heart because when you get there you will walk you will keep you will do unless brother uh kief uses the board if not leave this so we will pick it up accept our change inspiration amen but I'm trying to this is just the first point I want to establish when the Holy Ghost come what does he do what happened what happened inside of you the world is chopped off and God is establishing himself he locked you into love because what I'm getting to bring you next after you lock in love and God stabilizes you then I'm gonna show you what else does the Holy Ghost now begin to do inside of you and you will see what God does in you and you won't have to push nothing you don't have to fabricate nothing you will see because the one who walk is natural the one who keep is natural the one who do is natural I'm trying to bring you to the rest of roof where roof is resting it is Boaz doing the work of redemption he knows what he's doing you just gonna start enjoying the blessing the way he's directing you but I will show this is just the first point bringing the love of God to fulfill the law and after that what else does the Holy Ghost does keep me in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father today Lord once again we thank you for the love of God father what else can we express to you because of everything that you have done for us now we heard so much about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost we memorize this but we never understood well what is really your spirit cometh to do in our life but today you are expanding more to us what you mean by seeking ye first putting you first making you the Delight because David says if we make you our Delight you will give us the desires of our heart and how can we make you our Delight if you yourself don't come to make yourself a delight in our life that's why Paul says that you have given us the love of the truth so that we can be saved so there is something in us that we cannot explain that just love you that even when we thought we were angry towards you because our mother died because such and such thing happen because a tragedy happen in our life and we thought that we have a right to hate you but still while we were yet sinner you died for us and your love is unconditional that's why you don't look at our state but you look at what you put in US and once that love established what else can separate us from you father May that love pulsate in the life of your children in this church in the families of this church May whoever who have not experienced this love and know clearly but what has been demonstrated today that they do not have their love they have a love of a dominant offer of a denomination they have a love of a church where do you love the people that goes to your church and the other one we don't love them they love they love they have the love of the clicks but father that's not the love that you're talking about a love that can look beyond our thought and love and still bear and suffer one another that's the love that you're talking about that is agape love that you want to establish because once that is established it will flow through everything and our life will Blossom and change and turn into a Garden of Eden father bless them for the sacrifice to go extra mile with me and father may you keep us throughout the week Lord strengthen our body touch your children touch those that are online and father be with us we commit everything unto their hand and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen Church continue to ponder continue to meditate we will get deep into this and you see what the spirit of the Lord does brother John God bless you love you [Applause] amen [Music] amen [Music] all right amen amen [Music] amen [Music] How We [Music] Praise You Lord how we thank you Lord hey hey amen amen y'all are dismissed this morning amen amen amen [Music] amen amen amen are you nervous [Music] Lord [Music] do you believe him well amen amen [Music] amen amen [Music] amen amen [Music] have we thank you Lord How We Praise You amen amen amen [Music] amen amen [Music] remember what I'm not here to do [Music] say hey [Music] will you walk with me amenities [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you
