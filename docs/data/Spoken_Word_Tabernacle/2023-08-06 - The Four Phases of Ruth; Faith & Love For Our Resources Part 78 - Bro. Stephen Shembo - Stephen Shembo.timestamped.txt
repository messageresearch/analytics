[44:39] come back again and continue amen
[44:42] uh the young man had some fellowship
[44:46] among themselves
[44:48] so
[44:51] as a father my daughters
[44:55] brought a complaint
[44:58] and they say the young men are getting
[45:01] the fellowship together and we're not
[45:03] getting any Fellowship
[45:05] so they want also to have their day
[45:07] where they can meet together as young
[45:10] sisters and just have Fellowship
[45:12] together so I'm working on that and
[45:14] Speaker of the House you go ahead and
[45:16] check the date for me and give me the
[45:19] available date where all of you are
[45:20] going to be there so we will see what we
[45:23] can do amen
[45:24] so as a father I have to balance
[45:27] everything together and the young men
[45:29] were telling me that brother Stephen
[45:30] they have four meeting we only have one
[45:33] or two so I'm having men's and
[45:36] sisters here going back and forth so I
[45:40] will try the best that I can to balance
[45:42] everything up so I don't get any trouble
[45:45] and say you're not fair
[45:47] not fair but fur and then before I get
[45:51] this is not fair amen so I would do my
[45:54] best
[45:55] very interesting we got a very group day
[45:58] a good very interesting group back there
[46:00] but as a father I have to stay tenacious
[46:03] until I win
[46:06] and I did win because I was the last one
[46:09] to send the response they know what I'm
[46:12] talking about they are in their chat
[46:14] group so
[46:15] that's my time that I spent with my
[46:18] family so when my wife is doing
[46:19] something or shopping I just sit there
[46:21] and just go ahead with my children and
[46:23] make sure they're all doing okay if you
[46:25] have a problem when I say children you
[46:27] see me I will give you scripture
[46:31] because Paul called Timothy his son in
[46:34] the gospel
[46:36] we clear so far so I believe everything
[46:38] is clear Brother
[46:41] David brother Caleb if you can mute me
[46:44] for two minutes only and then we can
[46:47] come back online again
[47:56] amen
[47:59] amen
[48:01] so I do fight I fight on a puppet I
[48:04] fight on the back I fight back and forth
[48:06] until I make sure I clear everybody here
[48:09] amen because if God puts you under my
[48:11] Ministry I don't want anybody to touch
[48:13] you
[48:15] before they touch you they need to touch
[48:17] me in other words they need to talk to
[48:19] me first before they handle you
[48:22] amen amen so if somebody handle you and
[48:27] you begin to fight that's your problem
[48:28] don't fight come back and see me and let
[48:31] me handle him
[48:33] amen we covered 100 let's stand for the
[48:38] reading of the word
[48:41] glory to God
[48:43] amen
[48:51] Glory Glory
[48:53] let's go to the Book of Ezekiel
[48:56] well they take her working there
[48:59] we exited a little bit now we're back
[49:01] again on the highway
[49:06] amen same scripture I'm using them over
[49:09] again because we had to exit because of
[49:12] the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[49:17] if you dare you can say Amen
[49:21] Ezekiel 36.
[49:25] glory to God
[49:27] verse 24 back again to the same thing
[49:32] the Bible say for I will take you from
[49:35] Among the Hidden I don't know how deep I
[49:37] will go with this
[49:39] but I have to lay some scripture
[49:41] down
[49:42] as I'm moving amen for I will take you
[49:46] from Among the Hidden you understand
[49:48] this now
[49:49] because we were all Among the Hidden
[49:51] amen
[49:53] and gather you out of all countries
[49:57] that's why the bread is coming from
[49:59] different countries
[50:00] amen and will bring you into your own
[50:04] land
[50:05] which is the promised word of the hour
[50:08] amen
[50:10] then
[50:11] I will sprinkle clean water upon you we
[50:14] know that this is spiritual
[50:16] because Israel was not sitting there in
[50:19] God sprinkling water on them you might
[50:21] be seated
[50:22] and you shall be clean we know the water
[50:25] is the word we already went through this
[50:27] from all your filthiness and from all
[50:31] your adults will acquaint you amen
[50:35] verse 26
[50:37] and a new heart
[50:39] also will I give you so the target of
[50:43] God like we spoke three weeks ago is the
[50:46] heart
[50:48] amen God's Target
[50:51] is the heart
[50:52] that's why when Malachi 4 is coming
[50:55] amen the very Target of Malachi 4 is to
[51:00] turn the heart
[51:01] we clear
[51:03] he say a new heart also will I give you
[51:07] and a new spirit will have put within
[51:10] you amen
[51:12] and I would take away the Stony heart
[51:14] out of your flesh
[51:16] and I will give you a heart of Flesh
[51:19] everybody clear
[51:21] verse 27.
[51:24] and I will put my spirit within you
[51:28] and cause you to walk in my statue so
[51:32] the whole purpose of this surgery
[51:36] this heart transplant is just to make
[51:39] sure you got the right heart and God
[51:43] want to dwell in
[51:45] in other words we started with a wrong
[51:47] heart
[51:49] amen you remember that right so God
[51:53] wanted to Target the heart
[51:55] and clean this heart
[51:57] do a heart transplant give us a heart
[52:01] but not just a heart God want to dwell
[52:03] in the heart
[52:05] for which purpose
[52:07] the Bible says in verse 28 that you
[52:10] shall uh verse 27 that I will put my
[52:13] spirit within you so the spirit need to
[52:16] be inside the heart
[52:18] and when the spirit come within the
[52:20] heart
[52:22] God wants his spirit
[52:28] inward amen within the heart
[52:31] and cause you to walk in my statute so
[52:36] if you are walking in the statute of God
[52:38] what cause you to do that
[52:41] the spirit of the Lord
[52:43] amen so this spirit will cause you to
[52:47] walk
[52:48] I have to go with this word one by one
[52:51] today
[52:52] amen to walk in my statute comma and you
[52:58] shall do want to keep my judgment so
[53:00] who's keeping the judgment
[53:02] who's causing you to keep the Judgment
[53:04] spirit
[53:06] it causes you to keep
[53:10] in other words we were unable to keep
[53:13] his touches and his Commandments amen
[53:16] without the spirit of the Lord you won't
[53:19] do it
[53:20] it will be legalistic you will be doing
[53:23] that for fear because if you don't do it
[53:26] you get a whooping but truly you don't
[53:29] want to do it
[53:31] amen that's what happened to Israel
[53:33] they were doing it because if they don't
[53:35] do it they get killed an eye for an eye
[53:38] amen and he says and you shall keep my
[53:42] judgment Karma and what do them so the
[53:45] walking again the keeping and the doing
[53:48] all comes from the Holy Spirit keep
[53:52] these three words walk keep and do we
[53:56] need to see how they're going to be
[53:57] fulfilled amen once the spirit comes and
[54:01] you begin to walk you begin to keep you
[54:04] begin to do what follows
[54:08] verse 28
[54:10] and you shall dwell in the land that I
[54:13] gave to your father and you shall be my
[54:17] people and I will be your what God
[54:19] because you belong to God and God
[54:21] belongs to you you're going to see it
[54:23] sooner amen
[54:25] verse 29 I will also save you from all
[54:30] your uncleanness and I will call for the
[54:33] what corn now the blessing begin to come
[54:37] amen and we'll do what increase it and
[54:41] lay no famine upon you so the blessing
[54:44] followed the indwelling of the spirit in
[54:46] your life amen that's why we seek ye
[54:49] first the kingdom of God then what will
[54:53] follow will be the blessings
[54:56] because God wants you to prosper
[54:59] because we know what is in the heart
[55:01] really is your soul
[55:04] amen God wants you to prosper and to be
[55:07] in good health as you so
[55:11] we clear
[55:12] the verse 30 and I will do what
[55:16] multiply the fruit of the tree and
[55:19] increase of and the increase of the
[55:22] field that you shall receive no more
[55:24] water Repro of famine among the water so
[55:28] in other words there will be a
[55:29] distinction completely between you and
[55:31] the hidden they will tell
[55:34] by the way God is working in your life
[55:37] by the way God is blessing you somebody
[55:40] will look and say truly you got a good
[55:42] God you have a living God
[55:44] amen so the world needs to see that amen
[55:50] glory to God let's go to mark 11.
[55:54] amen
[55:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:00] Mark 11. if you dare you can say amen I
[56:04] have to add this back again because I'm
[56:06] going to make a point verse 12 and on
[56:09] tomorrow when we when they were come
[56:12] from Bethany he was hungry
[56:14] amen amen and seeing a fig a far off
[56:18] having leaves he came if happily amen he
[56:23] must find anything their own so Jesus
[56:27] was not sure he found he thought he's
[56:29] going to find something there amen
[56:33] and when he came to it he found nothing
[56:37] but water leave for the time of figs was
[56:43] not yet in other words it was not the
[56:45] season
[56:46] amen so there is a season
[56:50] for for everything
[56:54] amen but Jesus had the desire out of the
[56:59] season
[57:02] maybe one day I will teach you on
[57:06] seasons
[57:09] okay you need to understand season
[57:13] because if you don't understand season
[57:16] you can get in trouble in the future
[57:20] do you know what I'm talking about
[57:22] have you ever noticed sometime in your
[57:24] life like everything works nice yes
[57:27] and then suddenly he stopped
[57:30] and then you go to trial trial trial or
[57:33] child and after a while you open up
[57:35] again because it seasons
[57:40] everybody okay so when things are
[57:42] working right you need to wake up
[57:47] and seize the season
[57:52] let me leave season alone
[57:55] amen maybe one day I will sit with you
[57:58] and go into detail do you know that the
[58:01] dream of pharaoh have two seasons
[58:03] oh yeah
[58:05] huh there was a season of abundance
[58:09] and there was a season of famine and in
[58:12] the season of abundance you had to do
[58:15] something
[58:16] you cannot just be enjoying
[58:20] amen
[58:21] everybody okay when everything is in
[58:23] abundance you better do something you
[58:26] enjoy but you need to keep
[58:31] okay one day we will talk about season
[58:34] let me go back to my stuff so there is a
[58:37] natural season
[58:41] I will show you one day where the season
[58:43] is there is a natural season
[58:46] that goes with the course of the event
[58:50] it's a natural season amen and there is
[58:53] also
[58:56] a spiritual season
[59:00] amen
[59:03] this one
[59:04] override this one
[59:09] amen
[59:10] this spiritual season when it hits
[59:14] he doesn't care what is going on in your
[59:17] natural season
[59:25] how can Jesus go to a tree
[59:28] hey that doesn't have fruit
[59:32] and expecting to find fruit out of
[59:35] Caesar
[59:38] how
[59:39] and because he didn't find the fruit he
[59:42] didn't stop there and say you know what
[59:44] it is the season let me leave it alone
[59:46] let me wait for the season
[59:49] Jesus didn't wait for the season he
[59:52] wanted to have what he wants
[59:55] even though it is out of season
[1:00:00] everybody okay because if you go to the
[1:00:03] Book of Revelation there is a tree of
[1:00:06] life
[1:00:07] do you know that and the Tree of Life
[1:00:09] don't have season
[1:00:12] do you know that
[1:00:14] how many knows it raise your hand so I
[1:00:16] make sure you're good
[1:00:17] okay for those who don't know you ask
[1:00:19] the one who know who knows amen the tree
[1:00:22] of life every month produce fruit
[1:00:25] so you can go every month every year all
[1:00:30] the time of the year and you can get
[1:00:31] fruit amen but these three are natural
[1:00:35] tree
[1:00:36] amen sometimes they do have fruit
[1:00:38] sometimes they don't have fruit
[1:00:40] depending on the season
[1:00:43] everybody okay and Jesus went out of
[1:00:45] season
[1:00:48] amen and when he found no fruit out of
[1:00:52] season an anointing kick him
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:56] a turd pull anointing
[1:00:59] came out of season
[1:01:01] out of Natural season
[1:01:06] the Colorado Storm could be changed by
[1:01:11] the temple the third pool can change the
[1:01:13] season
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] even if if it's spoken that it's gonna
[1:01:20] snow the third pool can come and flip
[1:01:23] the season
[1:01:25] and make the sun shine
[1:01:28] for three days
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:34] have I lost someone
[1:01:37] do you know when brother Branham created
[1:01:39] the square he was in a bad weather
[1:01:42] that he cannot have any Square amen God
[1:01:47] didn't say I'm gonna tell squares where
[1:01:49] they hiding to come out no God created
[1:01:52] square that don't care about the weather
[1:01:58] the creation forced those Square to come
[1:02:02] out despite the bad weather
[1:02:04] because the square have to leave for a
[1:02:07] short time because they need to receive
[1:02:09] a bullet
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:14] everybody okay everybody okay so even so
[1:02:19] the season of this world is now really a
[1:02:21] problem
[1:02:22] you need to know the season of God
[1:02:36] let me just continue
[1:02:40] before you come to church you need to
[1:02:43] pray
[1:02:46] okay you need to pray you need to take
[1:02:48] time inside and pray so when we get here
[1:02:51] you are already in the spirit
[1:02:54] because God doesn't speak for speaking
[1:02:58] his word will never return to him for
[1:03:00] you you need to tell God I don't want
[1:03:03] that that sermon
[1:03:05] to pass me by and go back to you without
[1:03:09] accomplishing that which you said before
[1:03:12] in other words I'm not gonna leave this
[1:03:14] place without receiving what you have
[1:03:17] for me
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:22] tell your neighbor I didn't bring you
[1:03:25] out to church here
[1:03:27] I came to get my blessing
[1:03:30] and I'm gonna live with my blessing
[1:03:32] so don't worry about your neighbor
[1:03:39] everybody okay
[1:03:42] if there is one person to receive a
[1:03:44] blessing that will be me
[1:03:51] verse 14 and Jesus answering and say to
[1:03:54] it no man eat fruit of you Hereafter for
[1:03:59] water ever
[1:04:00] and he's disappointed water heard it did
[1:04:03] they treated anything on
[1:04:05] verse 20. if you can go with me
[1:04:09] let me drop down to 22 so we can save
[1:04:12] time and Jesus answering said to them
[1:04:15] have water faith in God for verily I say
[1:04:18] unto you that whatsoever whosoever shall
[1:04:22] say to this mountain
[1:04:23] be you water removed
[1:04:26] can you move a mountain
[1:04:30] a tree you can move a tree
[1:04:33] okay can you go to Kings Mountain and
[1:04:35] say okay today we're gonna move you
[1:04:38] so Jesus is taking that faith and hook
[1:04:41] it to something that is impossible
[1:04:46] in other words it's a faith that doesn't
[1:04:49] care about what the natural law says
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:04:58] he say and constant and be you cast into
[1:05:01] the sea and shall not that way in his
[1:05:04] heart do you see where that faith is
[1:05:06] coming the target is where
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] do you see where that faith is coming
[1:05:21] from amen
[1:05:22] yes so this heart must produce faith
[1:05:29] so where is this Faith coming from
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] that those things which he shall say
[1:05:36] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:05:39] would say whatsoever means whatsoever
[1:05:45] so ever mean to whatsoever
[1:05:48] so don't put don't don't don't don't
[1:05:50] fill in my whatsoever
[1:05:55] okay don't come with your faith and try
[1:05:59] to poke that on me that brother Stephen
[1:06:01] you can only ask this
[1:06:05] my whatsoever is different than your

[1:08:52] Dimension whatever you love

[1:09:03] dimension
[1:09:07] because brother Branham regretted that
[1:09:10] chair so much
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:16] even the dog
[1:09:19] foreign
[1:09:22] because brother Branham loves the dog
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:27] so how did the dog enter into the sixth
[1:09:32] Dimension because in the sixth Dimension
[1:09:34] nothing entered there but perfect love
[1:09:39] who gave to the dog perfect love
[1:09:43] who gets the dog perfect love
[1:09:46] he said God can enter death how much
[1:09:50] more me amen
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:57] like this
[1:10:01] goes into the sixth dimension
[1:10:07] is the chair in the image of God
[1:10:10] is the chair in the lightness of God no
[1:10:12] sir
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:21] please let's go to James chapter one
[1:10:29] oh God help me
[1:10:32] glory to God
[1:10:38] we have a powerful message
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:43] the people in the message don't even
[1:10:46] realize the message that they have
[1:10:54] this message
[1:10:59] I can try to pull a tooth and it's
[1:11:02] blocking me and I remember what brother
[1:11:05] Branham was doing and I do the same
[1:11:07] thing and the truth pop up
[1:11:11] I've seen that over and over the and
[1:11:15] I've seen the tooth coming up like this
[1:11:16] and I just grab it
[1:11:18] and they say wow you're a good dentist
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:32] when I use Maggie it doesn't work I just
[1:11:36] switch
[1:11:37] and when he used his gear he's the best
[1:11:40] dentist ever
[1:11:42] oh yeah
[1:11:44] and I learned these things by Brother
[1:11:46] Branham
[1:11:54] let's go to James chapter one the first
[1:11:56] father
[1:11:58] [Laughter]
[1:12:02] never play with this message
[1:12:05] never play this with this man even if
[1:12:07] you don't understand it just say Amen
[1:12:12] that's it
[1:12:19] verse 5 if any of you lack water wisdom
[1:12:24] let him do what ask of God that give to
[1:12:27] all men how liberal you remember that
[1:12:29] right an upgraded water nah you remember
[1:12:32] that right and it shall be water given
[1:12:34] him and let him ask how in faith
[1:12:38] so the point is you have to do
[1:12:42] everything by faith
[1:12:44] because without faith it is impossible
[1:12:47] but how can I get safe
[1:12:53] that's the key he says and let him ask
[1:12:56] by water in faith not what wavering for
[1:13:00] he that waivers is like a wave of the
[1:13:03] sea driven with the water the wind and
[1:13:05] the water
[1:13:06] glory to God verse 7 for let that not
[1:13:10] the man the man that is wavering think
[1:13:13] that he shall what receive anything from
[1:13:16] the water the Lord so if you are
[1:13:18] wavering God won't give you anything
[1:13:21] but we don't want to waver anymore
[1:13:23] what do we do job to verse 17 please
[1:13:26] glory to God if you dare you can say
[1:13:29] amen amen every water good gift
[1:13:35] no torn
[1:13:38] you remember that I'm no turn every
[1:13:41] water good gift and what every perfect
[1:13:44] gift
[1:13:47] is from who above
[1:13:51] so if I want to get good stuff
[1:13:55] and stuff that are perfect I need to
[1:13:57] receive information
[1:14:00] and comes water down so they coming out
[1:14:04] down they are there and they're coming
[1:14:06] they're coming down the way
[1:14:10] when they're coming down where are they
[1:14:13] going
[1:14:16] you're dangerous now
[1:14:19] amen amen so when it's coming down from
[1:14:23] above it is coming and dropping
[1:14:25] somewhere
[1:14:28] and the target is the heart
[1:14:31] and whatever job there is good amen and
[1:14:34] it's even perfect and it's usually a
[1:14:37] gift amen
[1:14:42] from your father above
[1:14:44] in other words daddy chose to drop a
[1:14:47] deposit
[1:14:52] and when you look
[1:14:54] you look what is this money doing here
[1:14:56] you need to learn that he didn't come
[1:14:58] just like that it is Daddy who send it
[1:15:01] amen you need to take the money
[1:15:04] they purchase power and use it amen
[1:15:11] glory to God and come down from the
[1:15:14] father of what light the Father of
[1:15:17] Lights so there is many lights
[1:15:21] and he's the father of those lights
[1:15:24] in other words when he give birth he
[1:15:26] give birth to likes his children looks
[1:15:30] like likes
[1:15:33] their their father there is a light
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:38] you see him he's the light his children
[1:15:41] also look like that amen
[1:15:45] so he's the father of light that's why
[1:15:48] in the day of Pentecostal when he came
[1:15:51] and he sees how many children are am I
[1:15:53] having there 120 then he birth 120 likes
[1:15:58] amen
[1:16:01] and God's light went and sat on top of
[1:16:04] the disciple
[1:16:06] and enter them
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:09] okay amen
[1:16:12] with whom is no water
[1:16:15] in other words this is a 100 guarantee
[1:16:19] it is not a place where you file an
[1:16:21] application and you are hesitant whether
[1:16:24] it's going to work or not
[1:16:27] it will always work
[1:16:29] especially if you know that it's our
[1:16:31] father
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:36] it is the father of light Jesus said
[1:16:39] when you pray say our father
[1:16:42] very good
[1:16:44] can I continue amen need the shadow of
[1:16:47] water turning so he won't play around
[1:16:49] with you
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:54] let's go to verse 18. of whom
[1:16:57] of his own will he what began
[1:17:01] begat of father he has with the word of
[1:17:06] water truth so the father birth you by
[1:17:09] the word
[1:17:10] you remember last Sunday right
[1:17:13] that we should be a kind of water first
[1:17:16] fruits of his water creature so God when
[1:17:20] he birth you
[1:17:22] he wants you to be first fruit
[1:17:27] amen why do you have to be faithful
[1:17:32] why
[1:17:35] Paul says this in Colossians chapter one
[1:17:38] he says who is water the image of the
[1:17:42] water invisible God the water first born
[1:17:45] of every water creature so Jesus was the
[1:17:48] firstborn of every creature and we know
[1:17:51] that first born was the pillar of fire
[1:17:53] amen which was the logos everybody okay
[1:17:56] amen watch First Corinthians chapter 15
[1:17:59] verse 23 the Bible say but every man in
[1:18:02] his own water order cross the water
[1:18:04] first through if he's the first fruit he
[1:18:07] wants you also to be the first fruit
[1:18:09] because you are his wife amen
[1:18:15] the first fruit will marry the first
[1:18:17] fruit
[1:18:20] that's why he
[1:18:22] him and his wife are one
[1:18:25] Adam and Eve were one amen Adam is the
[1:18:29] one who gave birth to evil
[1:18:34] of Adam
[1:18:38] and when Adam looked he said this is now
[1:18:40] and water Flesh of My Feet in other
[1:18:43] words she's exactly me and God being the
[1:18:46] first fruit want us to be also wanted
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:55] everybody okay
[1:18:57] First Peter chapter 1 verse 23 being how
[1:19:00] born again not of what corruptible but
[1:19:03] which color which seed of Incorruptible
[1:19:05] by the water word the word of God which
[1:19:09] liveth and abideth house forever
[1:19:13] so you are gonna be born like God was
[1:19:17] born
[1:19:20] and God being born was the first fruit
[1:19:22] of everything
[1:19:24] so his wife must be at his level
[1:19:27] that's why let this mind
[1:19:31] that was also in Christ beware in you
[1:19:35] that you and Christ are equal
[1:19:39] Queen Esther asked up to the half of the
[1:19:42] Kingdom
[1:19:43] the kingdom have to be divided in half
[1:19:46] he takes 50 we take 50 because we are
[1:19:50] joints here
[1:19:54] the Bible say in the Book of Revelation
[1:19:57] that the tree of life is on either side
[1:20:00] of the river how can one tree be on
[1:20:03] either side of the river
[1:20:06] it is a female and a male tree that are
[1:20:09] put together and they are on either side
[1:20:12] of the river
[1:20:15] the Bible said one tree but that tree is
[1:20:18] only the side of the river how can one
[1:20:20] tree be on either side of the river
[1:20:23] thank you if you put one tree here
[1:20:25] another tree here you put in two trees
[1:20:28] but it's one tree it's a tree that does
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:33] but it joins together like this
[1:20:36] it is a male and a female
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:47] and the two become one
[1:20:51] so he is the I'm just taking an example
[1:20:54] to make sure because that's the language
[1:20:55] we understand now when we say I love you
[1:20:58] so one side is coming and one love and
[1:21:01] the two are joining to form one heart
[1:21:03] there will be one flesh the two shall be
[1:21:11] any question
[1:21:13] let's pray then
[1:21:14] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:21:17] you again this morning Father thanking
[1:21:20] you once again for your grace for your
[1:21:22] love and your mercy and for everything
[1:21:24] you have been doing for us father thank
[1:21:27] you for the presence of your spirit this
[1:21:28] morning and giving us an ability and the
[1:21:31] opportunity to be able Lord to
[1:21:34] Fellowship together with scent of like
[1:21:36] Precious Faith father I have done what a
[1:21:39] man can do with the ability that you can
[1:21:41] give him but now I've prayed Lord that
[1:21:44] you move me completely out of the way
[1:21:45] may you come and speak to this church
[1:21:47] those that are visible and invisible
[1:21:50] because we know that your children is
[1:21:52] prayed all over the world we committed
[1:21:55] unto their hand be the Alpha and the
[1:21:57] Omega remove every demonic spirit away
[1:22:00] from us father in the name of Jesus
[1:22:02] Christ amen
[1:22:05] my subject this morning is the four
[1:22:09] phases of roof as we promised faith and
[1:22:13] love for our resources everybody okay
[1:22:17] faith and love for our resources so we
[1:22:21] are back again on the highway
[1:22:22] on the last phase of roof which is roof
[1:22:26] rewarded where we are preparing to uh
[1:22:29] for the takeoff of roof to leave the
[1:22:31] natural tabernacle into the spiritual
[1:22:34] Tabernacle amen
[1:22:36] three weeks ago we talked about the
[1:22:39] great commandment and according to the
[1:22:41] great commandment Jesus spoke of two
[1:22:44] Commandments that are joined together
[1:22:47] and Jesus said that great commandment
[1:22:49] number one is to love God
[1:22:52] amen with all our heart all our mind all
[1:22:55] our souls and the second commandment is
[1:22:59] to love one another
[1:23:01] amen or to love your neighbor
[1:23:04] as yourself amen and if you look at
[1:23:08] those Commandments the first love
[1:23:10] belonged to God
[1:23:13] everybody okay it is the love toward the
[1:23:17] groom
[1:23:19] or it is the love of the king
[1:23:23] everybody okay but the second
[1:23:26] commandment which is joined or connected
[1:23:29] to it is not about loving God
[1:23:32] it is loving one another or your
[1:23:34] neighbor this love is the bride's love
[1:23:39] all the love of the queen
[1:23:42] and the queen is made of many members
[1:23:46] but God is only one God
[1:23:49] hear your Israel the Lord your God is
[1:23:52] one God but when it comes to the bread
[1:23:55] Jesus said love one another because the
[1:23:58] Bread is made of many people in other
[1:24:01] words the first commandment Target the
[1:24:03] king and the second commandment Target
[1:24:06] the queen and the two Commandments are
[1:24:09] together because the king and the Queen
[1:24:12] Are One
[1:24:15] everybody okay have I lost anyone have I
[1:24:19] lost anyone in other words when you are
[1:24:22] fulfilling the loving of God it is
[1:24:24] toward the king but the loving of one
[1:24:27] another is you being a member of the
[1:24:30] Bride you will find out that you are not
[1:24:32] the only member of the Bride you have
[1:24:34] other member of the bride and as being
[1:24:37] are the member of the blood we need to
[1:24:39] love each other it is a love within the
[1:24:41] bread amen but the bride and the groom
[1:24:45] cannot be separated that's what Jesus
[1:24:48] said the second commandment is like unto
[1:24:51] the first because this is the pillar of
[1:24:54] fire we also have Pillar of Fire this is
[1:24:57] the father of light and these are the
[1:24:59] lights from the father or the sons of
[1:25:02] God so we together are joined together
[1:25:05] into one
[1:25:08] everybody good so far everybody good so
[1:25:11] far then we found out that the way our
[1:25:15] heart were created we were created wrong
[1:25:18] because our hearts were created with a
[1:25:21] foreskin
[1:25:22] you remember that right
[1:25:24] the Bible says in Deuteronomy I'm
[1:25:27] keeping this a little bit so we can take
[1:25:28] off that circumstance therefore the
[1:25:31] water for skin of your heart and be no
[1:25:34] more water stiff neck because our heart
[1:25:37] was Stony heart
[1:25:38] bad heart amen and the circumcision Paul
[1:25:42] explained to us that it's done by the
[1:25:44] Holy Spirit
[1:25:45] in Deuteronomy 30 verse 6 the Bible say
[1:25:48] and the Lord that God will do whatever
[1:25:50] circumcise
[1:25:53] so the one who circumcised the heart is
[1:25:55] not a man
[1:25:57] it is God himself that comes in the form
[1:26:00] of the Holy Spirit and circumcise or
[1:26:03] chop off
[1:26:04] the nature that you were born with that
[1:26:07] was a bad nature and remove that nature
[1:26:09] away for a purpose
[1:26:12] everybody okay and and Moses says that
[1:26:16] the Lord that God will circumcised that
[1:26:19] heart and the Heart of the water see to
[1:26:22] do water love the Lord thy God with all
[1:26:25] done water and without water so and we
[1:26:28] found that water strength in other word
[1:26:31] to fulfill this commandment you need a
[1:26:34] circumcision from God
[1:26:35] God have to come in the form of the Holy
[1:26:38] Spirit and circumcise your heart and
[1:26:41] then the Holy Spirit Will begin to
[1:26:43] produce love
[1:26:46] everybody good now we talked about our
[1:26:49] circles here you remember these circles
[1:26:52] amen the last thing right here is a seed
[1:26:57] and in this seed we got potential amen
[1:27:00] and we found out that that seed had
[1:27:03] eternal life you remember that and that
[1:27:06] eternal life we found also that Paul
[1:27:08] explained to us that the seed had the
[1:27:11] love of God
[1:27:13] you remember that
[1:27:14] amen and the Capstone Revelation that
[1:27:18] was coming up was also the love of God
[1:27:21] amen so it was love coming to love
[1:27:26] and when the true love meets the king
[1:27:29] and the Queens are married together
[1:27:31] let's go to John chapter 14 as we begin

[2:24:35] is that the one perfect love is removing
[2:24:38] fee why is he removing fear because you
[2:24:42] need to start getting blessing amen
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:48] father help me
[2:24:50] listen to this
[2:24:51] brother Branham think of it no water
[2:24:54] fear that is the greatest plague there
[2:24:58] is in the Christian church today it is
[2:25:00] water afraid and the reason they are
[2:25:03] afraid is because they are not taught
[2:25:05] right
[2:25:06] we call our teaching intellectual in
[2:25:09] this message
[2:25:10] because somebody doesn't know how to get
[2:25:12] in the Deep
[2:25:15] then we become intellectual
[2:25:17] we all bake a cake
[2:25:19] and we call everybody to eat our cake
[2:25:22] I didn't tell the people to leave your
[2:25:24] cake and to come and eat my cake so when
[2:25:27] the people come and eat my cake don't
[2:25:28] start jealousy
[2:25:30] ask me how do I bake my cake
[2:25:33] [Applause]
[2:25:35] amen we all preach the message I didn't
[2:25:40] tell people to subscribe in our Channel
[2:25:42] but it depends on the cake you breaking
[2:25:46] so don't start the jealousy
[2:25:49] we have to bake the cake
[2:25:51] because we are begging for Malachi fall
[2:25:54] but for some reason they are searching
[2:25:57] somebody else they don't search you you
[2:26:00] need to recalibrate your cake
[2:26:02] [Applause]
[2:26:07] everybody okay because they are not
[2:26:10] taught how right they say the right on
[2:26:12] the water gospel
[2:26:14] [Applause]
[2:26:17] and then it creates jealousy that God
[2:26:19] came if your brother is accepted go ask
[2:26:23] him
[2:26:26] yes You Preach something different in
[2:26:29] the message oh no that's intellectualism
[2:26:32] that's intellectualism because you don't
[2:26:34] know how to launch in the Deep
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:42] intellectualism people continue to
[2:26:44] finish the cake
[2:26:48] [Applause]
[2:26:51] we have how great things that we can do
[2:26:55] in the realm of water Faith safe work
[2:26:58] great things for us and if you Brethren
[2:27:01] here get it you can't have faith until
[2:27:03] you have love
[2:27:10] so the love of God remove fear
[2:27:14] then when he removed fear he doesn't
[2:27:16] stop there he begin to produce faith
[2:27:22] Faith why because you must pull out what
[2:27:25] you have in you must come out
[2:27:31] brother Branham said you can have faith
[2:27:34] until you have water love that is just
[2:27:37] all there is to it perfect love the
[2:27:39] Water cast out all fear as long as you
[2:27:42] got fear you can't have what hey so you
[2:27:45] got to have water love first
[2:27:48] fear out fear out then Faith water comes
[2:27:52] in
[2:27:55] so when the Holy Ghost come dispatches
[2:27:58] love he removed here when fear is all
[2:28:02] about because fear create torment
[2:28:04] that's why you can't sleep that's why
[2:28:07] when the alarm sound in the morning you
[2:28:08] go boom
[2:28:09] because it's another day it's another
[2:28:12] problem that bill need to be paid the
[2:28:14] hospital bill over there that insurance
[2:28:16] guy was calling me he created all kinds
[2:28:19] of frustration the love of God come and
[2:28:22] remove all of that
[2:28:23] and because you got problem God have to
[2:28:26] generate faith so that you can get
[2:28:28] access to whatever you desire
[2:28:31] [Applause]
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:35] he says so you get to have water first
[2:28:38] and then love will do it
[2:28:40] and then Faith water comes in and takes
[2:28:44] the place of what fear
[2:28:48] so the love of God we places fear with
[2:28:52] faith it takes fear out and he takes
[2:28:55] faith and put him in what are you doing
[2:28:57] with that if
[2:28:59] so when you have that you are coming how
[2:29:02] right along listen to this I'm gonna
[2:29:05] search the airport
[2:29:06] perfect fifth just like water perfect
[2:29:10] love

[2:29:34] heart rising up
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:40] Lord help me he said just you believe it

[2:29:47] something

[2:35:58] that goes and does that
[2:36:05] let me start it again
[2:36:10] who has no way at all or nothing there
[2:36:13] to believe
[2:36:14] it is my own way that goes and does that
[2:36:19] my faith in what he challenged me to ask
[2:36:30] so God can I ask you for something you
[2:36:32] cannot produce
[2:36:37] when God asks you for something just
[2:36:39] know you can do it
[2:36:41] everybody okay he said he challenged me
[2:36:45] to do water ask it and I receive his
[2:36:48] water challenge challenge in obedience
[2:36:51] to what his word
[2:36:53] us and it's a period God in heaven knows
[2:36:56] that is what true
[2:36:59] so we have been challenged that God
[2:37:03] wants us to prosper and to be in good
[2:37:06] health as I saw Prosper we need Now to
[2:37:09] respond
[2:37:11] in obedience to God's challenge and to
[2:37:14] begin to ask him according to his word
[2:37:19] [Applause]
[2:37:22] in other words God is challenging you
[2:37:26] and I'm not accepting his challenges
[2:37:30] [Applause]
[2:37:32] do you know that God challenged job
[2:37:37] amen because he knew what was in job
[2:37:40] amen God will not challenge you if
[2:37:43] you're not able to do it
[2:37:45] God knows the potential of the sea when
[2:37:48] God is challenging you that's why he led
[2:37:51] things to squeeze you
[2:37:54] because when you are pushed to the edge
[2:37:57] that you you will wake up
[2:37:59] [Applause]
[2:38:05] that's the mystery of desperation
[2:38:07] brother Branham said desperation is to
[2:38:10] bring the best of you out
[2:38:13] so God has to tighten things together
[2:38:16] until you say enough is enough
[2:38:19] [Applause]
[2:38:24] I'm gonna stop here there was a man
[2:38:26] called shanga
[2:38:31] every year and pick up his crops and go
[2:38:34] and God was sleeping and God was doing
[2:38:37] nothing God was just watching same God
[2:38:40] and some God is praying father don't you
[2:38:42] see the Philistine father don't you see
[2:38:44] the Philistine God is just watching him
[2:38:47] and watching him then he continued next
[2:38:49] year God said no if I do something this
[2:38:51] boy won't understand let them get it
[2:38:53] next year next year they take it Daddy
[2:38:56] at the ticket until one day the boy said
[2:38:59] no
[2:39:05] you know what
[2:39:06] he looked at his family
[2:39:08] he looked at his wife he said you know
[2:39:11] what either it's gonna change or we will
[2:39:14] continue like this but let me take a
[2:39:16] chance now it's gonna change it because
[2:39:18] he was pushed to the end and when he
[2:39:21] began to react to God said that was it
[2:39:24] amen how can one man kill 600 people
[2:39:27] [Applause]
[2:39:28] in other word when you put yourself in
[2:39:32] that sin God also stepping
[2:39:36] [Applause]
[2:39:41] everybody okay everybody okay because
[2:39:44] the Jew had a secret and the secretary
[2:39:47] circumcision and the secret was a secret
[2:39:52] the secret was a secret because
[2:39:55] circumcision is not to the public
[2:39:57] amen so when you fight the Jew he will
[2:40:00] be fighting with you but if he remember
[2:40:03] that done in him he has something
[2:40:06] different than you
[2:40:09] yes
[2:40:13] yo gave me something
[2:40:16] get him his office that's why when David
[2:40:19] come he said wait a minute
[2:40:22] since
[2:40:26] [Applause]
[2:40:29] Goliath was dressed
[2:40:32] for liar Dead Clothing but David saw
[2:40:35] behind his clothes
[2:40:40] he said he's a man I'm a man he star I'm
[2:40:44] short but there is one thing different I
[2:40:47] got the circumcision he doesn't have it
[2:40:51] amen
[2:40:52] [Applause]
[2:40:57] how can a stone destroy again
[2:41:02] amen because when Faith launched out
[2:41:05] when David took a stone and sent the
[2:41:09] stone God said that's all I was waiting
[2:41:11] God took the song and he forced it and
[2:41:15] got Goliath down
[2:41:20] the Holy Ghost is an action faith is a
[2:41:24] nutshell When Faith is there Faith does
[2:41:27] the rest quiet you need to act on what
[2:41:30] you believe in
[2:41:31] [Applause]
[2:41:33] no more
[2:41:35] you cannot continue the way you are
[2:41:38] going you need to push your break and
[2:41:41] say enough is enough
[2:41:45] amen look in your life what is not going
[2:41:49] right
[2:41:52] amen you got the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:41:55] Ghost didn't come there to be watching
[2:41:56] you suffer
[2:41:57] [Music]
[2:41:59] God when you get him into a
[2:42:02] circumstances he will change it you take
[2:42:04] him to a funeral he will say he he will
[2:42:06] bring life back
[2:42:08] wherever you take out he will change the
[2:42:10] circumstances so how can God be sitting
[2:42:12] 20 years
[2:42:15] and you are suffering and God is doing
[2:42:17] nothing
[2:42:18] amen
[2:42:20] amen and you pray and you pray until you
[2:42:23] discourage
[2:42:24] because you think your prayers are not
[2:42:26] answered
[2:42:27] amen
[2:42:28] take the Lord of faith that you have
[2:42:32] increase our faith no no no no no no no
[2:42:33] no no you don't need to increase our
[2:42:35] faith the Lord will be that you have if
[2:42:37] you say to this monkey
[2:42:40] if you say to this man
[2:42:42] [Applause]
[2:42:45] I tried so many times that's not the
[2:42:47] problem
[2:42:48] amen the love of God is in you it's
[2:42:51] telling you everything will be okay amen
[2:42:53] lunch unto the deeper and get into the
[2:42:57] deep amen and then push what you want to
[2:43:00] push that's all God is waiting for
[2:43:04] amen that's why you're going through
[2:43:06] desperation that's why things are
[2:43:08] cutting up because you're too lazy
[2:43:15] [Applause]
[2:43:17] let me stop here let's stand
[2:43:21] [Applause]
[2:43:25] brother Branham says here
[2:43:28] but Daniel had purpose in his heart to
[2:43:31] do the purpose of God and God has placed
[2:43:34] that in his heart
[2:43:36] before Daniel could have have this
[2:43:39] desire they had to be something to
[2:43:42] create that desire
[2:43:43] before he could have that Faith there
[2:43:47] had to be something to tell him that
[2:43:49] there was a God that could deliver
[2:43:53] so The Heroes of Faith that you see
[2:43:55] there they are not different than you
[2:43:58] they operated without the Holy Ghost in
[2:44:01] them
[2:44:04] amen and they shut the mouth of a lion
[2:44:08] amen I don't know where you were it
[2:44:11] the purpose of the Holy Ghost is not to
[2:44:14] come to serve you and stop there the
[2:44:17] Holy Ghost is coming to fulfill God's
[2:44:19] word
[2:44:20] to open the door for your blessing
[2:44:24] if something is not working you need to
[2:44:26] talk to the Holy Ghost
[2:44:27] you need to go awake Jesus Christ
[2:44:31] that is sleeping on your boat
[2:44:34] wake him up
[2:44:36] and say master we are perishing we can
[2:44:39] go on a third this is not a Titan
[2:44:43] no this one we don't think
[2:44:46] this is not a Titanic we don't think if
[2:44:49] he is in our boat we don't think
[2:44:52] that's the Titan and the Titanic
[2:44:58] in my marriage

[2:46:25] system that was created by the hand of
