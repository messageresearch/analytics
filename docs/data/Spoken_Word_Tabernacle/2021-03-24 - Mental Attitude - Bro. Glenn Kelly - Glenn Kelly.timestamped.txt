[17:07] their heart this evening or a testimony
[17:13] amen well i have a testimony and it's
[17:16] it's not um something that happened
[17:19] recently it was something that happened
[17:20] when i was younger and
[17:22] uh the story kind of came up today my
[17:24] wife was asking me about it
[17:26] and after i got done telling her about
[17:27] it i thought about i was like man this
[17:29] is this is a testimony and i don't
[17:30] really share it much
[17:32] but i'm like i should share it more
[17:33] because god you know god has done a lot
[17:35] of
[17:35] great things for me but um one day when
[17:38] i was like
[17:39] 15 16 years old i was working outside
[17:42] and i was weeding a yard and there was a
[17:43] thunderstorm and i was trying to get
[17:45] done before the thunderstorm
[17:47] before it got worse and it was it was
[17:50] there i mean i was in florida and a
[17:52] lightning bolt struck the ground beside
[17:54] me
[17:54] and it shocked me it shocked the weedier
[17:57] and i felt electrocuted and i shook
[17:59] and i dropped the weed eater and i
[18:02] i ran i went up to the guy i was working
[18:05] for he saw it he said he saw me get
[18:06] struck like he saw me get
[18:08] shocked and he asked me if i was okay
[18:10] and i told him i was fine he told me to
[18:11] go to the truck so i waited in the truck
[18:13] for him and we loaded up and left
[18:15] but my wife just mentioned that somebody
[18:17] was somebody died recently from
[18:19] a lightning strike and i thought like
[18:21] you know that bolt was so close to me
[18:22] but yet it just missed me by so much and
[18:24] it
[18:25] i felt the effects of it but god
[18:27] protected me and that that could have
[18:28] been my last day but it wasn't
[18:30] and i just wanted to thank the lord for
[18:31] that i know something in the past
[18:33] but god is god is god and he uh he was
[18:36] keeping me in that situation so i'm
[18:38] thankful for it

[29:29] simple it's just one course
[29:31] but as you sing these words you have won
[29:34] the victory i want you to look at
[29:36] everything in your life
[29:37] any sickness that might be the doctors
[29:40] may say you have
[29:41] or your last visit your last appointment

[29:46] to this song because

[29:50] is over the victory is won

[29:54] that satan may be battling you with any
[29:56] struggle you might have
[29:58] he has won the victory and if we're his
[30:00] bride and we're part of them

[43:06] and verse 3 verse 24 and 25 once you
[43:09] have it say amen
[43:11] so we're going to go ahead and get the
[43:13] movement because we have
[43:14] a lot of food tonight amen he says no
[43:18] man can serve
[43:19] two masters for neither he will hate the
[43:22] one
[43:23] and love the other or else he will hold
[43:25] to the one
[43:26] and despise the other you cannot serve
[43:29] god
[43:30] and mammoth you can't serve god in the
[43:31] riches of this world is that right
[43:34] verse 25 he says therefore now we're
[43:37] going to be coming out of 25 and some
[43:39] other scriptures
[43:40] he says therefore i say unto you take no
[43:43] what
[43:44] thought for your life see what what ye
[43:47] shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet
[43:51] for your body what ye shall put on it is
[43:54] not
[43:54] not the light it's not the life more
[43:58] than meat
[43:59] and the body then raiment amen and let's
[44:02] turn to mark
[44:04] chapter 10 and we'll just look at this
[44:07] last
[44:08] scripture and then you may be seated
[44:11] uh just just look at uh verse 27.
[44:15] you have it say amen and jesus looking
[44:19] upon them
[44:20] said with men it is impossible
[44:23] but not with god for with god all things
[44:27] are possible
[44:28] may the lord have a blessing to the
[44:29] reading of his word you may be seated
[44:32] you know tonight we want to look at who
[44:34] thought i was just looking at a message
[44:36] but the
[44:37] thought came to me was a mental attitude
[44:43] you look at mental attitude you know we
[44:47] know
[44:47] satan you know god and we hear this i
[44:50] heard this numerous times some of you
[44:51] have been around a
[44:52] message for a while you've heard us
[44:55] numerous time your attitude
[44:57] you know your attitudes determine what
[44:59] direction that you're going in
[45:01] but you know we want to look at that you
[45:03] know our prophet
[45:05] he kind of went in a little more about
[45:07] this attitude this mental attitude
[45:10] you say it's more than what you think it
[45:12] is you see
[45:13] we have to recognize in this hour here
[45:16] now
[45:17] that you are the victorious you are the
[45:20] overcomers
[45:21] we're going to read we got a lot more
[45:23] quotes better rather than what i
[45:24] normally read but we're going to read it
[45:25] tonight
[45:26] is that right because we're coming in
[45:28] god give me grace and i don't want to
[45:30] miss the opportunity to bless his
[45:32] precious children is that right
[45:34] because we're going to knock the devil
[45:35] out tonight is that right
[45:37] every time god brings something to us we
[45:40] come ahead and knock the devil out
[45:42] so we can grow closer and closer to god
[45:44] is that right
[45:46] it's not by power it's not by might but
[45:48] it's by his spirit
[45:49] say the lord see i want to look at this
[45:51] one quote here it came out of blind
[45:53] with barnabas it says think
[45:57] um if this is if you're writing it down
[45:59] and those that are home if you're
[46:01] writing it down you get your pen and
[46:02] your pencil tonight because i'ma
[46:04] read a a lot of quotes and scriptures i
[46:07] want to take my time and not normally
[46:09] preach like i normally do unless the
[46:11] holy spirit takes me off then i will
[46:14] but uh it says think on these things
[46:17] that's positive
[46:22] what we have what we've given
[46:25] it should never be nothing negative come
[46:27] out of your mouth
[46:31] say devil in trouble tonight yeah he in
[46:34] trouble tonight
[46:35] he said now look he says think on things
[46:39] that's positive
[46:41] never let a negative thought pass
[46:43] through
[46:44] just or don't let it stop anyhow
[46:48] you know don't let it stop cast down any
[46:51] imagination and try to exhort itself
[46:53] against the word of god anything that
[46:55] comes across your brain
[46:56] that tried to come higher than the word
[46:58] of god cast it down
[47:00] challenge it rebuke it you have no right
[47:06] he said look at it he said if
[47:09] and anyhow if it starts true keep your
[47:12] thoughts what
[47:13] positive jesus don't think it says
[47:17] just because they're sitting out there
[47:19] just because
[47:20] you're sitting out there when you came
[47:23] through that door
[47:24] maybe you had an issue we all did is
[47:27] that right
[47:28] and many afflictions come upon the
[47:30] righteous is that right
[47:31] but the lord the promise deliver us out
[47:34] of them all
[47:34] is that right so when you come to an
[47:36] then you come to get refilled is that
[47:39] right
[47:39] will you come to get a refilling when
[47:41] you come here into the house of the lord
[47:44] the lord is doing some great things for
[47:46] us in here so when you come through that
[47:48] door
[47:49] is that right we know maybe you're
[47:51] troubling with a migraine
[47:53] maybe you're troubling with a bill maybe
[47:55] you're troubling you with your
[47:57] transportation
[47:58] maybe you're troubling with your
[47:59] finances but the lord is what
[48:02] he's going to take care of is always
[48:04] that right you've never seen the
[48:06] righteous forsaken or is she
[48:08] begging for bread every promise in the
[48:10] word
[48:11] belongs to us in this hour
[48:16] mental attitude
[48:20] he said now look the mental admittance
[48:23] relating to the mind
[48:24] intellectual it executes or performed
[48:28] by the mind that's dealing with your
[48:30] mind is that right we know a car
[48:32] is all right to start then but you
[48:34] cannot let it stay there is that right
[48:37] it has to drop down into the heart is
[48:39] that right so as a man
[48:40] think of in his heart so is he
[48:43] hallelujah
[48:45] i try to slow it down brother forgive me
[48:47] i forgot you back there
[48:48] hallelujah he said now look
[48:52] hallelujah it says all relating to the
[48:56] total
[48:57] emotional and intellectual response
[49:01] for an individual to his environment
[49:05] so now remember the prophet that god
[49:07] taught us um brother steve
[49:09] he said perfect faith has control
[49:13] over every situation
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:18] every situation we should have control
[49:21] over
[49:22] you see because he teaches us to be slow
[49:26] to speak
[49:27] quick to listen slow to wrath
[49:31] is that right hallelujah
[49:34] i tell you he's in trouble tonight he
[49:37] said now look
[49:38] it says to know jesus christ as your
[49:41] redeemer in all situations is that right
[49:44] you know jesus christ in all situations
[49:47] god has given us the revelation of the
[49:51] seven
[49:51] compound redemptive names is that right
[49:55] hallelujah that's what he's giving us
[49:59] and i'm telling you somebody's going to
[50:01] get something real good you know why
[50:03] i won't say what it is but i was praying
[50:05] today brother steve i was praying for
[50:06] that individual today
[50:08] and god brought him here tonight
[50:15] [Applause]
[50:16] thank you jesus he said now look the
[50:19] attitude
[50:20] the attitude runs into the mind to add
[50:22] it to a mental feeling or emotion
[50:24] toward a fact or state of a mental
[50:27] position
[50:28] now and then the other one i'm going to
[50:30] look at is conditions you'll see why i'm
[50:32] looking at
[50:33] i'm going to read to you the definition
[50:35] of conditions
[50:36] it's stipulation it's a covenant
[50:40] it's a state of affairs that must exist
[50:43] or be bought about before something else
[50:46] is possibly or permitted here with me
[50:52] hallelujah look what can happen to you
[50:55] i'm just going to read a few things
[50:57] if you worry worrying that scripture
[51:00] means be anxious
[51:01] be anxious for nothing you get a spirit
[51:04] of anxiety on you
[51:06] you'll be running thinking 100 miles an
[51:09] hour
[51:10] and the prophet of god said you'll be
[51:11] way ahead of yourself and you'll never
[51:13] get it done anyway
[51:15] isn't that right all you're doing is
[51:17] opening yourself up for a spirit
[51:19] but the lord has said that he said what
[51:22] i'm your provider
[51:24] he said isn't life better than the
[51:25] rainman he better than i'm able to take
[51:28] care of the birds and the fowls
[51:31] huh can i take care of you can i meet
[51:34] all your needs huh
[51:36] we're gonna run him out of here tonight
[51:38] saints huh
[51:39] so when you come through that door he
[51:41] said enter the gates with what
[51:43] thanksgiving is that right
[51:49] is that right because the lord why
[51:51] brother robin because they gotta
[51:53] understand
[51:54] see if you're coming in the devil want
[51:55] you to put pressure
[51:57] on the song leader is that right but hey
[51:59] brother abel it'll be different we
[52:01] claiming it tonight
[52:02] by faith brother and they come in here
[52:04] when you into that door we're going to
[52:06] have a what
[52:07] a positive thought on our mind
[52:10] is that right before you come in here
[52:13] you're into this gates with thanksgiving
[52:15] why this is the only place that you
[52:18] can get to what you come looking for
[52:22] every time you enter in the gates
[52:30] mental attitude he said now look
[52:35] if you worry look what the devil would
[52:37] do to you
[52:38] i won't read i got a few written down
[52:40] here he says
[52:41] it's sinful worrying is simple and
[52:43] produces fear
[52:46] it says it's a it could produce a mental
[52:50] and physical suicide
[52:53] see satan has an army
[52:58] and he has organized army that's why he
[53:01] said
[53:01] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[53:04] against principalities and powers
[53:06] and wickedness in rulers in high places
[53:11] now that means that force is against our
[53:13] force but what
[53:14] he told us to do what put on the whole
[53:17] armor of god
[53:19] so that you maybe be able to withstand
[53:22] the wild
[53:23] of the devil in the end times saying
[53:26] hello
[53:29] mental attitude see that's why i don't
[53:32] know some of you were there at the old
[53:34] um um building we were there and the
[53:37] holy spirit was ministering us about
[53:39] that mind
[53:40] remember he said now while you're alive
[53:43] you can get away with it
[53:45] if they ask you something it's because
[53:48] intellectually you can tell a lie
[53:50] right and you still can get away with it
[53:54] he said but then after the brain dies is
[53:56] that right
[53:58] now after the brain dies he's dealing
[54:00] with
[54:01] what down that spirit your soul is that
[54:03] right
[54:04] have that area so if god just sense of
[54:09] god sent you
[54:10] ever to the hospital to pray for someone
[54:14] no matter what the condition is
[54:17] subconsciously
[54:18] if they can tell you they can still hear
[54:20] you what you want to do
[54:22] make sure that they have their salvation
[54:25] is that right
[54:26] don't give up on them is that right
[54:29] don't give up on anyone
[54:31] because that's what the gospel has been
[54:33] sent for with power
[54:35] and demonstration sometimes god has to
[54:38] put someone on their death bed down
[54:41] sometime he had to get him in accident
[54:44] son
[54:45] sometimes they have to get cut sometimes
[54:47] they have to lose a job
[54:48] sometimes they have to do some kind of
[54:51] trial
[54:52] and test has to come towards them to get
[54:55] them back is that right
[54:57] hallelujah they look at the prodigal son
[55:00] is that right we're going to look at
[55:02] some scriptures and we're going to look
[55:04] at the attitude remember
[55:06] his attitude his mental attitude
[55:09] he wanted to go out there humble robert
[55:11] he wanted to go
[55:12] out there give me my goods is that right
[55:15] let me have my goods
[55:16] his father didn't argue with him is that
[55:18] right hallelujah
[55:20] because his father knew that he had
[55:22] raised him up training him up in the way
[55:24] that he should go
[55:25] when he grow old he won't depart from it
[55:28] his dad didn't die
[55:29] back he didn't have a mental revelation
[55:32] i mean he had us down in the soul
[55:34] revelation is that right but what
[55:36] happened with the prodigal son is that
[55:38] right
[55:39] he came at the bible said he came into
[55:41] his what
[55:43] senses is that right
[55:46] i believe that theophany spoke to him
[55:50] and he came to his sensor who he really
[55:53] was
[55:53] and when he spoke to him he'd come back
[55:56] at home
[55:57] he never said he sinned against daddy he
[55:59] never said he sinned against mama
[56:01] he said i have sinned against god
[56:04] against
[56:04] heaven is that right
[56:08] mental attitude
[56:12] look what he says
[56:15] another thing the devil would do to you
[56:17] if you worry
[56:19] it says needless and waste time and
[56:22] effort
[56:23] see you're overthinking huh you're going
[56:26] to pull up a quote brother random talked
[56:28] about
[56:28] the nervousness in there he said now
[56:32] look
[56:32] he said look out look outs what uh
[56:36] uh um worrying does a robber of faith
[56:41] is a robber of peace and trust in never
[56:45] failing heavenly father
[56:48] it says it is a disgrace to god
[56:51] and should never be indulged in by
[56:56] christians
[57:01] one day we're gonna get into that city
[57:03] of refuge one day we're gonna see you
[57:05] it'll show you what you really got ah
[57:09] we're gonna see if you're really in
[57:10] christ
[57:12] those that are in christ jesus there's
[57:13] no condemnation
[57:16] that those that are in christ walking
[57:18] out after the flesh but in the spirit
[57:22] it says anxiety over what is nothing
[57:25] today
[57:26] unless tomorrow in view of faith
[57:30] that's what worrying does and i'm just
[57:32] touching some things
[57:34] it says it's a torment over something
[57:37] that will likely be a blessing
[57:39] if it comes ah
[57:43] worrying you're rushing you're trying to
[57:44] get something is god not necessarily god
[57:47] not saying no to you
[57:49] but what he may be saying not now not
[57:52] yet
[57:53] wait a minute
[57:56] he's telling you what first seek ye the
[57:59] kingdom of god
[58:00] and his righteousness and all other
[58:02] things will be what
[58:03] added unto you mental attitude
[58:08] hallelujah
[58:10] he said listen worrying look what else
[58:12] is worrying to do for you
[58:14] it's mentally cruel to self and others
[58:18] it's foolish for whatever is going to
[58:20] happen cannot be stopped by worrying
[58:23] ah
[58:26] but what can stop it if you believe in
[58:28] the promises of god
[58:30] if you believe in the word of god if you
[58:34] mark those uh promises in that bible
[58:37] when you're reading your bible
[58:39] is that right hallelujah we're getting
[58:42] somewhere
[58:43] just bear with me he said now look
[58:47] he he says don't worry should and should
[58:50] adversities
[58:51] uh adversities come and may still be
[58:55] victorious
[58:56] by trusting in god
[58:59] hallelujah y'all pray with me now i've
[59:02] got my timer on

[59:16] mental attitudes mental attitudes
[59:20] that you have remember this
[59:24] and never forget it this is our prophet
[59:27] now
[59:29] the right mental attitudes towards any
[59:31] promise of god
[59:33] will bring it to pass
[59:37] the right mental attitude towards any
[59:40] promise of god
[59:41] is that it doesn't it doesn't take gifts
[59:44] of healing healed to sick
[59:48] people it says any person in here

[1:00:27] hands is on the jews
[1:00:31] we are the gentiles it was going to be a
[1:00:35] time that they talked about in the book
[1:00:37] of
[1:00:37] acts where the gentiles we
[1:00:40] will receive the word and receive what
[1:00:43] we need
[1:00:44] by receiving the word of god
[1:00:50] that's what we're moving into we're

[1:01:34] the prophecy now whatever the other part
[1:01:37] of the prophecy
[1:01:38] that came forth that the lord showed us
[1:01:40] that the prophet of god talked about
[1:01:43] the part of the prophecy that stuck with
[1:01:45] me was when he put the purple garments
[1:01:48] on the adopted child
[1:01:50] is that right hallelujah
[1:01:53] see if you don't want to take the other
[1:01:55] part of the prophecy

[1:01:59] when you take
[1:02:00] all the prophecy now with you being
[1:02:03] adopted son and daughter of god
[1:02:05] it's a certain character comes with it
[1:02:07] it's a certain authority comes with it
[1:02:10] the devil know who you know that he
[1:02:12] can't touch you
[1:02:13] is that right look what he says i better
[1:02:17] get the going there
[1:02:18] i got a lot so i better keep going he
[1:02:20] said look
[1:02:21] when jesus christ was here on earth and
[1:02:24] in he dwelt at the fullness of the
[1:02:26] godhead
[1:02:27] bodily all the great powers of god was
[1:02:30] in
[1:02:30] his son christ jesus for the scripture
[1:02:34] tell us that god was in christ
[1:02:36] reconciling the world to himself
[1:02:38] all things was delivered unto him though
[1:02:41] he spoke
[1:02:42] nothing but what father the father told
[1:02:45] him
[1:02:45] he healed no one but what he saw
[1:02:49] being healed for he said verily i say
[1:02:53] the son
[1:02:53] can do nothing in himself but what he
[1:02:56] sees what
[1:02:57] the father is that right what he sees
[1:03:00] the father
[1:03:01] doing that was that was there now i tell
[1:03:03] you what
[1:03:04] let's turn to this scripture here john
[1:03:07] chapter 5.
[1:03:12] i know it won't be able to get to them
[1:03:14] all but if you're writing down you can
[1:03:16] write down john 5 9 um
[1:03:19] 19 deuteronomy 16
[1:03:23] 16. but right now we want to go to
[1:03:26] john the gospel with john chapter
[1:03:30] uh five let's look at verse one after
[1:03:33] this there was a feast of the jews
[1:03:35] and jesus went up to jerusalem now there
[1:03:39] is now there is that jerusalem by the
[1:03:42] sheep market
[1:03:43] a pool which is called in the hebrew
[1:03:45] tongue
[1:03:46] bethesda having the rough five porches
[1:03:49] now bethesda has been mercy is that
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:53] the house of mercy he says in this lay a
[1:03:56] great multitude and potent
[1:03:58] folks verse four it says for
[1:04:01] for an angel went down at the center
[1:04:04] season into the pool
[1:04:06] in a certain season into the pool
[1:04:09] and troubled the water whoso so ever
[1:04:12] then
[1:04:13] first after the troubling of the water
[1:04:15] stepped in
[1:04:16] was made whole of whatsoever disease he
[1:04:20] had
[1:04:21] he said and a certain man was there
[1:04:23] which he had an affirmative thirty and
[1:04:25] eight years
[1:04:26] when jesus saw him lie and the
[1:04:29] and when jesus saw him lie and knew that
[1:04:32] he had been
[1:04:33] now a long time in that case he said
[1:04:36] unto him
[1:04:37] will thou be made whole look at the
[1:04:40] important event look what he said
[1:04:42] the important man answered him sir
[1:04:46] i have no man when the water is troubled
[1:04:50] to put me into the pool but while i am
[1:04:54] coming
[1:04:55] another step down before me look at that
[1:04:58] mental attitude
[1:04:59] towards the lord when he came to him 38
[1:05:03] years is that right
[1:05:05] some of you haven't even lived that long
[1:05:07] yet and you're coming in
[1:05:11] hallelujah
[1:05:14] the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:05:19] huh look what i said look at that
[1:05:22] attitude look at that attitude
[1:05:26] his trouble he said but while i am
[1:05:29] coming why i am coming another step down
[1:05:33] before me
[1:05:34] see i always thought he couldn't walk
[1:05:36] but you're going there brother brandon
[1:05:38] said he could walk
[1:05:39] that's what he said that's right brother
[1:05:41] steve he got in there because when you
[1:05:43] look at the scriptures
[1:05:44] he said every time i moved to get in
[1:05:47] somebody go in before me
[1:05:49] hallelujah he said now you get around
[1:05:52] and say now you look
[1:05:54] he said jesus said unto him rise up thy
[1:05:57] bed and walk
[1:05:59] and immediately the man was made whole
[1:06:02] and took up his his bed and walked and
[1:06:05] on the same day
[1:06:07] what was the sabbath he says and the
[1:06:10] jews
[1:06:10] therefore said unto him that was cured
[1:06:13] it is the sabbath day and it is not
[1:06:16] lawful for thee
[1:06:17] to carry thy bed he answered them that
[1:06:20] who made me whole
[1:06:21] the same unto me take up thy bed and
[1:06:24] walk
[1:06:25] he said then as they him what man is
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:29] which said unto thee take up thy bed and
[1:06:31] walk
[1:06:32] and and he that was healed was not
[1:06:35] who was who it was for jesus
[1:06:39] had conveyed himself away in multitude
[1:06:42] being in that place he said afterward
[1:06:45] jesus
[1:06:46] fine of him in the temple and said unto
[1:06:48] him
[1:06:49] behold thou art made whole sin
[1:06:52] no more lest a worse thing come unto you
[1:06:56] now jesus came in not that only granted
[1:06:58] but now what was
[1:07:00] jesus displaying jesus was displaying
[1:07:03] the messiah ship to him is that right
[1:07:06] he started moving now to that messiah
[1:07:09] ship
[1:07:09] because the jews had healing is that
[1:07:11] right they knew about healing already
[1:07:13] the pool was already there
[1:07:15] so when they got there the the jews
[1:07:17] knowing the laws that who get this man
[1:07:19] right is that right
[1:07:21] who give him right to to do this on the
[1:07:24] sabbath day
[1:07:25] why who was it it was the lord of
[1:07:27] sabbath
[1:07:28] hallelujah noun is becoming in a
[1:07:32] revelation
[1:07:33] to god's children is that right it's
[1:07:35] coming to us now
[1:07:37] he said now look and expectations
[1:07:41] he said now he had passed by the pool of
[1:07:43] bethesda
[1:07:45] and there was great multitudes of lane
[1:07:47] hunt blind wither waiting for the
[1:07:49] movement of the water
[1:07:51] and when the waters be troubled then the
[1:07:53] first person stepped into the world
[1:07:55] by what by faith received
[1:07:59] healing is that right we're going to
[1:08:01] look at some things we're going to look
[1:08:02] at another one here mental
[1:08:04] attitude see some just was saying the
[1:08:06] mental
[1:08:07] attitude but the reason why i said
[1:08:09] mental attitude
[1:08:11] is also you're going to find out as we
[1:08:13] continue but it's based upon the
[1:08:15] condition
[1:08:16] the condition has to be right the
[1:08:18] condition has to be there
[1:08:20] it has to be according to the word of
[1:08:22] god is that right
[1:08:24] hallelujah he said i must
[1:08:27] i must have been john a young fella this
[1:08:30] one here
[1:08:30] you if you're writing down is one 1763
[1:08:35] it says now a young fella who no
[1:08:38] thinking fast
[1:08:40] must have been best have been him that
[1:08:42] and just
[1:08:43] think of it and i want you to bear with
[1:08:45] me on this because this is the point
[1:08:48] that one of the points we want to really
[1:08:50] bring out to you
[1:08:51] the one that could can make the five
[1:08:53] biscuits
[1:08:54] uh five biscuits and two fish and feed
[1:08:57] five thousand
[1:08:58] the one that knows the secret of the
[1:09:00] heart he
[1:09:01] he's with us in the ship see he's with
[1:09:04] us he's here
[1:09:05] he can meet all of your needs everything
[1:09:08] that you need is no needing for you
[1:09:10] not to have the joy of the lord is that
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:13] it's what's beating you when you come
[1:09:15] through that door what's getting them
[1:09:17] brother able is that mental
[1:09:18] attitude that mental attitude is
[1:09:21] blocking you
[1:09:22] from your blessing that mental attitude
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:26] because he said lean not to thy own
[1:09:29] understanding
[1:09:30] trust in the lord in all thy ways he
[1:09:32] will lead he will guide
[1:09:34] he will direct your past uh you see go

[1:09:45] demon forces and they're coming to you
[1:09:48] and they're affecting your thought
[1:09:50] pattern is that right and the reason why
[1:09:53] is affecting your thought pattern
[1:09:55] because he said he that keep their mind
[1:09:58] on me
[1:09:59] i will grant you perfect peace is that
[1:10:02] right

[1:10:09] us into what
[1:10:10] unto the sons and daughters is that
[1:10:13] right he cannot

[1:14:21] i guess you criticized it no sir
[1:14:25] he said i said thank you dr showing
[1:14:29] he said brother branham we have recorded
[1:14:31] that when we tell a person
[1:14:34] that's got a malignancy or something's
[1:14:36] going to kill him
[1:14:38] ulcers ready to bust or tuberculosis
[1:14:43] it depends on listen to this it depends
[1:14:46] on
[1:14:47] what attitude they take
[1:14:57] greater is he that is in me
[1:15:01] than he that is in the world
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:05] he said if they get all tore up and
[1:15:08] said they died to see if you get tore up
[1:15:11] behind it
[1:15:12] if you believe where the doctor we had a
[1:15:14] sister then we have a sister honey
[1:15:16] that sister we went this is what about a
[1:15:18] month ago she said she went to the
[1:15:20] doctor
[1:15:21] there was he went there and the doctor
[1:15:22] robert said she had cancer
[1:15:24] and she said it was she said the doctor
[1:15:26] said it was on the screen
[1:15:28] she looked at the doctor and said
[1:15:30] something wrong with your screen
[1:15:32] ain't nothing inside of me
[1:15:40] huh that's an elective god they know
[1:15:42] where they stand
[1:15:45] hallelujah they criticize he says
[1:15:48] but he said on what attitude they take
[1:15:52] if they get all tore up said they'd die
[1:15:55] right away
[1:15:56] but said if they take the attitude well
[1:15:58] dying is just part of living
[1:16:01] it's all right when i die says you know
[1:16:04] it's almost retards the case that means
[1:16:07] it will stop it it'll push it back
[1:16:09] it'll hold that thing i'm telling you
[1:16:11] faith
[1:16:12] is that right faith in the promised word
[1:16:15] today
[1:16:16] we don't see the condition you've got
[1:16:18] the word
[1:16:19] the word that came to us god sent the
[1:16:22] prophet
[1:16:23] the seventh angel covenant prophet is
[1:16:25] that right
[1:16:26] the condition has to be also it's a what
[1:16:29] it's a covenant is that right
[1:16:31] let me keep going hallelujah
[1:16:34] he said now he he says you know
[1:16:38] it almost retarts that case now i
[1:16:41] just thought if that mental attitude
[1:16:45] taken like that what will it do when the
[1:16:48] holy ghost strikes that inner man
[1:16:56] when the world strikes down in there
[1:17:00] mixed with faith is that right
[1:17:04] what will happen huh
[1:17:07] thank you jesus he said now look
[1:17:11] he says what would it happen if it
[1:17:13] strikes the holy spirit strikes that
[1:17:15] inner man
[1:17:16] there it is i asked him he said
[1:17:20] certainly that's right if you can move
[1:17:22] into a spot
[1:17:24] move up to that one of the best surgeons
[1:17:27] and doctors that's in the southland he
[1:17:29] said
[1:17:30] mr branham it can be proved
[1:17:34] if a man will move up into that
[1:17:37] spot until even his own mind
[1:17:41] don't even know he's got it to
[1:17:44] think he's got it and don't even pay
[1:17:47] attention to
[1:17:48] it said it would do
[1:17:52] it's a it would do it see
[1:17:55] if he can believe that that's the truth
[1:17:58] all you gotta do is block it out
[1:18:02] once something come upon you if you got
[1:18:04] a problem with a migraine
[1:18:07] cast that thing down in the name of
[1:18:09] jesus christ

[1:41:42] that should be you've got to come
[1:41:45] upon basical promise and upon
[1:41:48] your mental attitude towards it he says
[1:41:52] now at those
[1:41:53] those 400 prophets remember when he went
[1:41:55] down and let me drop down
[1:41:57] he says but remember
[1:42:01] that belongs to us so he made him
[1:42:05] he's talking about he's talking about
[1:42:06] with micah and he talked about
[1:42:08] jehoshaphat and we talked about with
[1:42:10] ahab i tell you
[1:42:12] when he got there right we know that on
[1:42:15] that conditions
[1:42:16] i'll tell you what i got to read this
[1:42:18] turn the first um
[1:42:20] uh what was that king's first kings i
[1:42:23] think it's 22 is it
[1:42:24] somebody help me is the first kings 22
[1:42:27] let's see
[1:42:28] yeah first kings 22 help me lord
[1:42:32] now look at the condition
[1:42:36] hallelujah look at the condition here
[1:42:40] first kings 22. once these once you have
[1:42:43] it say amen
[1:42:44] we'll just look at the first five verses
[1:42:46] he said now look and say they continue
[1:42:48] three years without war between syria
[1:42:50] and israel and it came to pass in the
[1:42:52] third year
[1:42:53] that jehoshaphat the king of judah came
[1:42:56] down to the king
[1:42:57] of of israel she sees jehoshaphat was a
[1:43:01] righteous man
[1:43:02] he said then the king of israel said
[1:43:03] unto his servants know ye that
[1:43:05] raymond gilead is ours and we be still
[1:43:08] and take it not
[1:43:10] out of the hand of the king of syria and
[1:43:12] he said unto jehoshaphat
[1:43:14] will thou go with me to the battle to
[1:43:16] raymond gilead see how the holy ghost
[1:43:18] told us that
[1:43:19] suddenly see he learned his lesson on
[1:43:21] that third time is that right
[1:43:22] but you can't go out there and socialize
[1:43:24] with somebody two
[1:43:25] can walk together right like they can't
[1:43:28] walk together unevenly yoke is that
[1:43:30] right
[1:43:30] you can walk together unless you agree
[1:43:32] he says and he said unto jehoshaphat
[1:43:34] without
[1:43:34] but with me to the battle to raymond
[1:43:36] gilead and jehoshaphat said to the king
[1:43:38] of israel
[1:43:39] i am as thou art what my people as thy
[1:43:43] people
[1:43:43] my horses that died the horses but now
[1:43:46] here's what we're talking about the
[1:43:47] condition
[1:43:49] see people is taking this word they're
[1:43:52] taking this bible
[1:43:54] and they're taking this bible and for
[1:43:57] the season
[1:43:58] it gotta be in season is that right you
[1:44:01] can't grow a watermelon in the
[1:44:03] wintertime
[1:44:04] is that right so you got to understand
[1:44:07] god now we're in what we're on the
[1:44:10] backside of the bible is that right
[1:44:12] we got to understand what god is
[1:44:15] bringing us into right now
[1:44:16] is that right the conditions had to be
[1:44:20] right
[1:44:21] is that right so you could not move into
[1:44:24] it
[1:44:24] without the word of who the prophet is
[1:44:26] that right
[1:44:27] look at what he say here look that's why
[1:44:29] i say the condition
[1:44:31] it got to be under condition it's got to
[1:44:33] be based upon the word of the prophet
[1:44:35] because god cannot curse what the
[1:44:38] prophets say
[1:44:39] and and the prophet can't curse what god
[1:44:41] says is that right
[1:44:42] no way god can curse because the words
[1:44:45] of the prophet
[1:44:46] comes from god is that right huh
[1:44:50] oh man i tell you i tell you i can
[1:44:53] preach all night the atmosphere in here
[1:44:55] let me keep going help me lord he says
[1:44:58] now verse five
[1:44:59] here's the condition verse 5 he says and
[1:45:02] jehoshaphat
[1:45:03] says unto the king of israel inquire i
[1:45:06] pray thee
[1:45:07] at the word of the lord today see is
[1:45:10] that right
[1:45:11] now you've got to inquire from the
[1:45:13] prophet then the king
[1:45:15] of israel gathered the prophets together
[1:45:17] about 400 men
[1:45:18] and said unto them shall i go against
[1:45:21] raymond gilead or shall i bear
[1:45:23] and they said go up up the law go for
[1:45:26] the lord shall deliver it unto thy hand
[1:45:28] now for the sake of time we know that
[1:45:30] them what lion prophets is that right
[1:45:32] a spirit came on them but the real
[1:45:35] problem was micah is that right
[1:45:37] they didn't want to hear what micah had
[1:45:38] to say is that right they want to hear
[1:45:40] what william mary and branham got to say
[1:45:42] is that right that's only come to the
[1:45:44] elected seat is that right
[1:45:46] that's why i tell them he's a vindicated
[1:45:48] prophet is that right
[1:45:50] he's vindicated by the word of god uh
[1:45:52] like he told him in his hour here now
[1:45:55] see you got to listen to god is that
[1:45:57] right
[1:45:58] i'm telling you it was so many that
[1:45:59] walked with him and it hurt him is that
[1:46:01] right after the african trip
[1:46:03] when he was there on that african trip
[1:46:05] come on up musicians
[1:46:06] he was there on an african trip and when
[1:46:08] he was there on that african trip
[1:46:10] he got there and god told him not to go
[1:46:12] is that right
[1:46:13] same spirit when god told him not to go
[1:46:16] he was there
[1:46:17] but he told them brothers god told him
[1:46:19] not to go you got to realize things
[1:46:21] if god give you a word i don't care if
[1:46:23] the prophet i don't care if his father
[1:46:26] mother preacher deacon anybody when god
[1:46:29] give you a word
[1:46:30] you stick with the word of god even when
[1:46:33] he got around there he told the brother
[1:46:35] they were laying up in there and he told
[1:46:37] the brother i think the
[1:46:38] brother that was walking with him we've
[1:46:40] been on the stage with him many times on
[1:46:42] the platform with him
[1:46:43] many times and seen god do mighty works
[1:46:46] and he looked at rather random and he
[1:46:48] told him he said you know what
[1:46:50] he said brother adam you're wrong he
[1:46:52] told you he was wrong
[1:46:53] and he looked at it the thing was odds
[1:46:55] were his brother i think it was
[1:46:57] brother bob's worth i think it was and
[1:46:59] he turned around and he looked at him
[1:47:01] he looked turned around and he said but
[1:47:02] brother bosworth
[1:47:04] god told me
[1:47:08] when god tell you something
[1:47:11] when he tell you something then it's
[1:47:15] going to happen
[1:47:16] but it's going to happen in his time
[1:47:20] under his conditions when he see fit for
[1:47:23] it to happen
[1:47:25] but the condition here god said
[1:47:29] when jesus came jesus came because he
[1:47:33] had to fulfill
[1:47:34] the word of the prophet the word that
[1:47:36] come from moses
[1:47:38] he had to fulfill the office of the
[1:47:40] messiah
[1:47:41] and then in his hour here now somebody
[1:47:45] had to fulfill malachi 4 luke 17 30
[1:47:48] revelations 10 7 it had to be fulfilled
[1:47:52] and the vindication shines is there is
[1:47:54] that right
[1:47:55] he says scriptural sign the same sign
[1:47:59] that was
[1:47:59] that was not given to the gentiles but
[1:48:02] it had to be given to
[1:48:04] the gentiles when it was melchizedek
[1:48:06] when he came into the tent
[1:48:08] of abraham is that right once he came
[1:48:10] into the tent of abraham
[1:48:12] so many talks about the signs that went
[1:48:14] down to sodom and gomorrh
[1:48:16] the two angels went down to sodom and
[1:48:18] gabor billy graham and oral roberts
[1:48:21] the two that went down there but the
[1:48:23] sign that we was looking at was
[1:48:25] discerning the thoughts and the intents
[1:48:27] of the hearts
[1:48:28] that was our sign now that we were
[1:48:30] looking for he'd come to turn
[1:48:32] the heart of the children to the father
[1:48:34] in the hearts of the father
[1:48:36] to the children unless you do read your
[1:48:39] bible

[1:58:59] of the righteous but the lord delivered
[1:59:02] him
[1:59:03] out of all of them amen i'm going to
[1:59:06] read a quote
[1:59:08] from brother branham it's in the message
[1:59:10] the law
[1:59:12] preached in 1955 in january 15th
[1:59:17] it's paragraph 18. brother branham
[1:59:20] saying now paul
[1:59:22] speaking here of the valley or the
[1:59:25] shadow rather the law
[1:59:27] being the shadow of a good things to
[1:59:29] come
[1:59:30] could never make the worshiper perfect
[1:59:34] then he goes on to show what the
[1:59:36] perfection is
[1:59:38] now it's a strange thing
[1:59:42] that this is so much thought of people
[1:59:46] they say well i am weak
[1:59:50] my faith is not very much i am not a
[1:59:53] very good christian
[1:59:55] this is what people say brother branham
[1:59:58] say
[1:59:59] that is just what the devil wants you to
[2:00:02] say
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:04] amen you are just talking
[2:00:07] his language right then
[2:00:10] so when you say you are weak you are
[2:00:13] talking the devil's language
[2:00:16] because let the weak say they are water
[2:00:19] amen blessed be the name of the lord he
[2:00:21] said that
[2:00:22] is just what the devil wants you to say
[2:00:25] you are just talking his language right
[2:00:27] then see
[2:00:29] you must never say that
[2:00:32] don't never let your testimony
[2:00:36] be negative let it be
[2:00:39] positive all the time
[2:00:42] i am saved i have god in my heart
[2:00:47] i believe him with all my heart
[2:00:50] do you believe in divine healing with
[2:00:52] all my heart
[2:00:54] let your testimony always and your
[2:00:57] thoughts
[2:00:58] everything never permit a negative
[2:01:02] thought to come in your mind if you can
[2:01:05] help it
[2:01:07] when he start that don't entertain it
[2:01:11] amen keep your thought always
[2:01:15] positive amen
[2:01:18] every mental right mental attitude
[2:01:22] toward every divine promise because the
[2:01:25] word of god is a seed
[2:01:27] and in the world there is life if you
[2:01:29] need something
[2:01:31] just relax pick up a promise
[2:01:35] keep it in your heart and begin to
[2:01:38] confess it
[2:01:39] not for one day not for today
[2:01:43] you hold on to that promise you confess
[2:01:46] it
[2:01:47] until it is vindicated to you
[2:01:50] in other words it's made real to you

[2:01:57] suffer with a car

[2:02:02] the morning you say
[2:02:03] lord thank you for this beautiful car
[2:02:07] where is the car that's not my problem
[2:02:10] the problem is we think too much with
[2:02:12] our mind
[2:02:13] instead of looking at the word of god
[2:02:17] with god all things are possible
[2:02:21] amen my car is broken down

[2:03:24] promise being given
[2:03:25] to take care of the need found a promise
[2:03:28] hold on to the promise
[2:03:30] and begin to confess in the morning you
[2:03:32] say praise the lord
[2:03:33] for healing me praise the lord for
