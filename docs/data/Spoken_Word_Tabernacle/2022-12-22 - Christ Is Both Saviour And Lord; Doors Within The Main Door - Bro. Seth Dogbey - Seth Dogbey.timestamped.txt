[17:06] from members of our family they go to
[17:09] another church good to see y'all brother
[17:11] Luke and sister Stephanie amen praise
[17:14] the Lord today is a very special day for
[17:18] me it's it's uh it's the birthday of
[17:20] somebody very special in my life my wife
[17:22] today amen
[17:29] you can ask her how old she is I'm I
[17:31] know better after 34 years I know better
[17:35] um
[17:36] but it's does anybody else have anything
[17:39] to praise God for this evening I want to
[17:41] go straight to the prayer request amen
[17:44] sister Sharon I saw it I felt that
[17:53] uh no I want to testify but I want
[17:57] everybody to understand very good
[17:59] English
[18:00] so I'll speak in French
[18:03] so my husband can translate
[18:13] in French
[18:14] I used to speak in English you might not
[18:17] really really get it
[18:22] praise God
[18:26] really
[18:33] I was thinking
[18:36] about the time Christ was those seals
[18:40] those seals were Christ
[18:43] so I started thinking I'm like yes I
[18:46] know they say those silver Christ
[18:48] so what does it have to do with me what
[18:51] how how am I related to those seal
[18:54] so I was thinking that way
[18:56] so some things that explaining to me
[18:59] because one
[19:01] my parents came to the message I was not
[19:04] born in the message my parents came in
[19:07] the message I was 12.
[19:09] so the people who came to preach the
[19:11] message to my family
[19:14] came with a
[19:16] Camry a message book
[19:20] so behind the message book there were
[19:22] there were a picture of the cloud over
[19:25] there for some reason when they showed
[19:27] me the picture of the cloud
[19:30] I felt something I never felt in my life
[19:33] and anointing drop unto me I started
[19:36] crying I started saying this is the Lord
[19:38] this is Jesus
[19:40] so those people start explaining to us
[19:42] saying that he sent a messenger William
[19:45] my own brother and
[19:48] um in the message of William my brother
[19:51] he manifested himself so much and there
[19:54] is something that is really really
[19:57] powerful with the picture that makes you
[19:59] cry but you will understand someday but
[20:03] just believe the message so I start
[20:06] coming the message I've been in the
[20:08] message since then I believe everything
[20:10] I believe the the cloud but this time he
[20:14] became very personal to me
[20:16] so I told God I say I believe they say
[20:20] when the cloud came it was the seven
[20:22] seven angel that came with the message
[20:25] that was supposed to be given to father
[20:28] and those that's what they call the seal
[20:31] and in the seal they were what they call
[20:33] the real message was were in the seal
[20:36] that's what they call the Tundras so I'm
[20:39] like God the tandas what is the Thunders
[20:41] so the Lord started explaining to me the
[20:44] Bible we're reading it's scripture that
[20:48] we see you can see in the Bible they say
[20:50] Adam and Eve and Adam trying to pass to
[20:55] to partake of the sin to save Eve that's
[20:58] what you see but you have to see that
[21:01] it's not really Adam with Eve it's Jesus
[21:04] Christ trying to save his bride those
[21:07] are those are the Thunders over there
[21:09] you can see in the Bible they would say
[21:12] uh Joseph went down in the prison he had
[21:15] two people in the prison with him that's
[21:18] what everybody would see but the Thunder
[21:20] for you is like Jesus Christ in the
[21:22] course coming to die for you so the Lord
[21:24] started explaining so much to me about
[21:26] what is the Thunders all those stuff so
[21:30] since that day I was I spoke with my
[21:32] husband this picture has been something
[21:34] different for me so he told me that you
[21:38] see it's the head
[21:39] in the body in in the human body you
[21:42] have the head and the and the and the
[21:45] body but the body is uh the body any
[21:50] movement you do or anything you do is is
[21:53] com is commanded by the brain the brain
[21:55] is the one commanding everything that's
[21:58] why you as the bride of Christ the head
[22:01] came to collect to you you don't have to
[22:04] worry about everything the body will
[22:06] connect with the body and do whatever it
[22:08] takes to take you out of this world
[22:11] he's gonna do everything because it's
[22:13] not up to you you are just there to say
[22:15] Amen connect to the Thunders connect to
[22:18] this message you are connected and the
[22:20] body will take you when it's time
[22:23] this picture is not anything for me it's
[22:26] it's my life I understand why I was
[22:28] attracted to that so when I see that now
[22:31] I understand I was called by God himself
[22:34] I am grateful that it will follow my dad
[22:38] I didn't follow my mom but the Lord
[22:40] called me himself I'm grateful amen I
[22:43] have a lot to say about Cortana
[22:48] everybody understood it
[22:51] blessed be the name of them

[23:33] afterwards he was cleaning out the pot

[23:37] battery

[36:52] therapist a psychiatrist yes or no and
[36:55] we kind of tap into it but when you go
[36:58] through Roman and you see how Paul
[37:01] opened up the cross if you really get
[37:04] what the cross is
[37:06] amen you will be living a free life
[37:11] the problem is in the message we
[37:14] uh
[37:17] we created a habit of self-righteousness
[37:22] amen the people think like they are the
[37:25] one that did something
[37:27] and the Mr Cross completely and then
[37:30] automatically when you miss Calvary
[37:32] you're gonna have a trouble with sunset
[37:34] Manta because Calvary opened the door
[37:37] into Sunset Manta if you miss Calvary
[37:40] you will struggle with brother Brown I'm
[37:42] not even understanding what the blood
[37:44] means we can repeat to you that you
[37:47] justify the day you're gonna understand
[37:49] what justify really mean amen you will
[37:53] take that intellect man and kill it and
[37:56] put it on the ground
[37:58] amen
[38:00] amen
[38:02] uh
[38:04] open Roman 3.
[38:10] if you can
[38:11] everybody okay with the three points of
[38:14] the rapture
[38:16] we didn't lose anybody
[38:20] everybody's okay
[38:22] so you understand the shout the voice of
[38:25] the archangel and the Trump of God Amen
[38:29] amen if they're not clear you're going
[38:32] to miss everything and be troubled with
[38:34] what happened in 1963.
[38:37] and big trouble with what happened in
[38:39] sunset Mountain
[38:40] if it's not properly put together
[38:42] because brother Branham says he's doing
[38:44] all three how is he doing all three when
[38:48] he's descending
[38:49] that's the problem if you dare you can
[38:51] say Amen
[38:53] glory to God
[38:56] Romans 3 I'm just going to read one
[38:59] verse that say Romans 3 verse 19. now we
[39:04] know that what thinks however
[39:07] the law says he says to them who are
[39:10] under the law
[39:12] why
[39:14] that every month
[39:16] Maybe
[39:18] stopped and all the world
[39:22] there is no exception
[39:25] even you
[39:27] who are born in a message
[39:30] you who never been in a nightclub
[39:33] that all the world
[39:35] may become how
[39:38] guilty before who
[39:39] so tell me what can you present to God
[39:43] even if you're born from parenting a
[39:46] message what are you going to present
[39:47] God God made sure that everybody when
[39:51] you present before him you must be
[39:53] guilty
[39:57] amen what do you want to present to God
[40:01] one of this day you will catch what I
[40:04] just read
[40:05] amen but God conclude even to save the
[40:09] Jews because of the ignorance God have
[40:12] to push them toward ignorance in
[40:15] guiltiness
[40:16] and that's the only way God can pick
[40:18] them up there and justify them
[40:21] because if you come before him like a
[40:24] Pharisee then you're gonna miss God
[40:26] because you are healed there is no way
[40:28] they can heal you you don't need them I
[40:31] mean a medical doctor you don't need a
[40:33] physician amen but you must approach him
[40:36] a different way even in our repentance
[40:39] there is a way that have you wonder why
[40:43] Adam was
[40:47] punished
[40:51] have you wonder why
[40:55] the the curse went straight and struck
[40:58] the ground
[40:59] why didn't God forgive him
[41:04] why didn't God forgive Eve he turned
[41:07] around and he struck judgment and he
[41:09] said he will be having children with
[41:11] pain why
[41:13] have you ever wondered
[41:16] have you ever wondered
[41:19] when God was asking the question what
[41:21] were they as answering God
[41:24] they were doing what
[41:28] are you afraid
[41:31] they were doing what I'm just warming
[41:33] you up so the preacher can come in they
[41:35] were doing what
[41:39] they were passing the bar
[41:42] and they were just blaming one another
[41:45] so nobody wanted to pick up the
[41:48] responsibility
[41:50] and God struck all of them
[41:57] can I help you
[41:59] when The Prodigal Son came back
[42:02] what did they do to him
[42:04] judgment
[42:06] why
[42:08] because he did what
[42:11] he did what
[42:13] you see the way we repent
[42:18] do you see how we justify what we did or
[42:21] we passed the bucket and like this
[42:23] because of my father
[42:28] one of this day
[42:30] I'm gonna stop right there I just put
[42:33] that so your Cannon will be open
[42:36] okay and you will go home and chew a
[42:39] little bit on those kind of stuff you
[42:41] don't need your righteousness
[42:44] we need the cross of Jesus Christ
[42:47] that's the only thing that God will
[42:50] accept is not you it is that Bloody
[42:53] sacrifice that is sitting on the throne
[42:56] whose blood speak better things than the
[43:00] blood of Abel
[43:02] amen
[43:03] as good as able was fine born with a
[43:07] parent from God mother from God yet Abel
[43:11] could speak for vengeance his blood was
[43:13] lower
[43:15] but not the blood of Jesus Christ
[43:18] amen
[43:20] amen
[43:21] glory to God my wife gave you a brief
[43:25] summary of what she we talked about it's
[43:29] a deep question and answer in the night
[43:34] Amen in the Thunders she even turned she
[43:38] said the whole church need to hear
[43:39] something like that I say oh my God Amen
[43:42] and the Lord even showed me something
[43:45] about the seals that goes with the
[43:48] mathematics in Genesis and it matches
[43:50] correctly while I was talking to her she
[43:52] opened up he opened a book and I never
[43:55] seen it before and it was right there in
[43:57] Genesis that the seven seal was still
[44:00] rather in the Book of Genesis this
[44:02] message is beautiful amen if somebody
[44:06] struggle with the Thunders or something
[44:08] or you don't understand put a question
[44:10] and answer and we will handle it a man
[44:13] in detail it's very simple and we spoke
[44:17] about it sometimes we spoke and it takes
[44:19] a second touch so people can really
[44:21] grasp what we were saying amen glory be
[44:24] to the name of the Lord I will not be
[44:27] the one I'm not going to be the one

[59:05] Matthew 5 6 amen it's a blessed are they

[59:15] for they shall be filled
[59:19] blessed are they which hunger and test
[59:22] after righteousness
[59:24] for they shall be filled I was just
[59:27] thinking about this
[59:28] it didn't just say just hunger
[59:32] he said hunger and thirst
[59:35] so it has both the meat and then they
[59:39] drink
[59:42] amen so the feeling of the Holy Ghost
[59:45] comes with a meat offering and then the
[59:47] drink offering amen and amen it is that
[59:51] word that comes mixed with blood
[59:55] amen and amen I just I just take my mind
[59:57] back to Sunday's preaching amen that
[1:00:00] word that has come and mixed with the
[1:00:02] blood amen and amen amen is always meat
[1:00:06] and drink offering
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] I
[1:00:14] in in John chapter 6 let's read John
[1:00:18] chapter 6.
[1:00:21] John chapter 6 verse 53.
[1:00:35] he said then Jesus said unto them very
[1:00:38] very I say unto you except ye eats the
[1:00:42] Flesh of the son of man
[1:00:46] and drink his blood he have no life in
[1:00:50] you
[1:00:51] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:00:54] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:00:56] shall be filled
[1:00:58] amen he said whosoever verse 54 whoso is
[1:01:02] that my flesh and drinking my blood had
[1:01:06] eternal life
[1:01:07] and I'll raise him up at the last day
[1:01:10] amen for my flesh is meat indeed and my
[1:01:15] blood is drink indeed he that eateth my
[1:01:19] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelled in
[1:01:22] me and I in him as the as the living
[1:01:27] father has sent me and I live by the
[1:01:31] father so he either so he that eateth me
[1:01:34] even he shall live by me
[1:01:37] this is that bread which came down from
[1:01:41] heaven not as your Father's Day eat
[1:01:43] Manner and are dead he that heated of
[1:01:47] this bread shall live forever
[1:01:50] amen and amen so we are talking about
[1:01:53] this bread that was given by the son of
[1:01:56] man amen amen and amen
[1:01:59] bread
[1:02:01] and blood
[1:02:02] amen and amen
[1:02:04] so um as we had on Sunday as he began
[1:02:10] he's supposed to complete something
[1:02:13] amen and amen I I I'll come back to this
[1:02:19] now when we look at the bloody word amen
[1:02:25] the bloody word
[1:02:27] has a cleansing power
[1:02:33] so when the when the word is coming and
[1:02:36] it's bloody
[1:02:37] the main intention is to come to cleanse
[1:02:40] you up
[1:02:42] yes sir
[1:02:44] amen and amen
[1:02:46] it's not just a word that is coming to
[1:02:50] you for you to look out for you to see
[1:02:52] for you to understand that the the word
[1:02:55] has a purpose of coming into you to
[1:02:57] cleanse you up
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:02] and and
[1:03:04] I I find this
[1:03:06] um a big problem amen that we can
[1:03:10] describe the word so much
[1:03:14] we explain the message of the hour we
[1:03:17] explain the seals we explain all the
[1:03:20] standards we explain everything but then
[1:03:23] the life the reason why the sales came
[1:03:25] to us is it it's not living in US
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:32] then what is the purpose of knowing the
[1:03:35] word what is the purpose of the seals
[1:03:38] the purpose of the seals is coming to
[1:03:41] cleanse you up
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:44] amen and amen
[1:03:46] it's it it's just like um
[1:03:50] I I come here
[1:03:52] with with my with a messy hair
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:57] and then somebody looks at me and the
[1:04:00] first question would be like don't you
[1:04:02] have a hairbrush
[1:04:05] right that's the question you're going
[1:04:07] to ask
[1:04:08] and and when you ask me that question
[1:04:10] I'll be like you know I have like 25
[1:04:13] different kinds of hair brushes in my
[1:04:15] closet you know I'll give you
[1:04:17] descriptions you know some uh Brown some
[1:04:20] black some are pink stuff and I can even
[1:04:23] show you the locations that I have that
[1:04:26] that have placed all those hair brushes
[1:04:28] you're going to look at me that is this
[1:04:31] guy crazy
[1:04:34] so why are you not using it
[1:04:38] it is either I'm lying to you or there's
[1:04:41] something wrong with me
[1:04:43] that is the message of the hour
[1:04:46] amen the message of the hour is coming
[1:04:49] to cleanse you up
[1:04:52] not for you to explain to people you
[1:04:56] know that that is the word that we
[1:04:58] normally use
[1:04:59] you understand people build that war you
[1:05:03] know when you're trying to talk to
[1:05:05] people about trying to clean up your
[1:05:07] life you know they want to show to you
[1:05:09] that I know the message
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:12] pray to my brother
[1:05:14] I know the message you know I know the
[1:05:18] message you know but around this but
[1:05:21] continue giving you all the stories and
[1:05:23] everything and you look at them you're
[1:05:25] like okay wow
[1:05:27] you know the message
[1:05:29] but
[1:05:31] where is the life
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] amen
[1:05:38] what is the purpose of the message of
[1:05:41] the hour as we learn on Sunday is to
[1:05:43] come to cleanse you up
[1:05:46] yes my brother
[1:05:48] amen and amen and and I was just
[1:05:52] pondering over this
[1:05:54] and it's
[1:05:56] brought me up to something that Brad
[1:05:59] Brown said
[1:06:00] what a sin
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:06] sin is unbelief
[1:06:10] now
[1:06:11] looking at
[1:06:13] that that
[1:06:15] um statement just opened up to me in a
[1:06:18] different way and I was just seeing the
[1:06:20] rapture
[1:06:22] foreign
[1:06:24] [Laughter]
[1:06:36] but those are the attributes of sin
[1:06:40] now now we get to understand that
[1:06:42] something has to have a source
[1:06:46] before you see the manifestation
[1:06:49] so Brian Brown says when you say okay
[1:06:52] then I'm going to drink I'm going to do
[1:06:54] all this stuff it means you didn't even
[1:06:56] believe in the same in the first place
[1:06:59] amen so
[1:07:02] this unbelief
[1:07:04] is taking place
[1:07:07] in the spiritual mind
[1:07:11] now when when when
[1:07:13] this spiritual man is able to overcome
[1:07:16] this unbelief then we have a
[1:07:19] manifestation in the flesh
[1:07:24] so that just gave me an opening of the
[1:07:27] concept of the rapture
[1:07:29] so what what this man this son of man is
[1:07:33] coming to us
[1:07:34] I still work for amen overcoming a
[1:07:39] spiritual
[1:07:41] a short Force amen
[1:07:44] this is trying to open us up or open our
[1:07:48] flesh so that our flesh get consumed
[1:07:52] that is the transformation
[1:08:00] so I was like wow
[1:08:03] that's just a rupture amen
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:09] um I was I was so much thrilled amen um
[1:08:13] on Sunday when sister I started
[1:08:16] preaching amen
[1:08:22] I was so much thrilled on Sunday when
[1:08:24] sister Rosemary gave her testimony after
[1:08:27] the preaching
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:30] Brown said that um
[1:08:33] man is always looking at things in the
[1:08:35] past things that God did in the past
[1:08:37] things that he's going to do in the
[1:08:39] future but what is going on today
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:46] so God just came down to confirm his
[1:08:49] work
[1:08:52] he he was just confirming the word that
[1:08:55] the Rapture is linked to your physical
[1:08:57] body
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] a transformation in your body
[1:09:05] so God is sending the word to bring
[1:09:08] transformation to your physical body
[1:09:11] and that is the rapture
[1:09:14] amen and amen amen I was just thinking
[1:09:17] about it and it's
[1:09:20] I was so blessed by that it reminded me
[1:09:24] of one time we went for service and and
[1:09:27] one of the churches in Georgia
[1:09:29] and then um the minister was preaching
[1:09:34] um about um the the stages of a
[1:09:37] butterfly
[1:09:39] from the air to the lava to the people
[1:09:42] stage and going to uh the state that it
[1:09:45] flies amen
[1:09:47] and then after that preaching
[1:09:50] my wife and I went home
[1:09:53] and um
[1:09:55] so as you know the bride always like to
[1:09:59] take pictures amen
[1:10:01] amen so you know um the son of man
[1:10:04] knowing that the bride knows uh wants to
[1:10:07] take pictures that's why he always gives
[1:10:09] the bride pictures amen so it's it's
[1:10:11] just in line amen
[1:10:14] amen amen taking selfie with the Lord
[1:10:18] amen amen
[1:10:20] so I mean we're just
[1:10:24] take pictures I mean um and then
[1:10:26] sometimes you look at those pictures and
[1:10:28] you you you're like Lord has been so
[1:10:30] good in our lives amen not she she just
[1:10:33] takes them to look at What the Lord Has
[1:10:36] Done amen amen and we just appreciate
[1:10:39] the work of the Lord in our lives and in
[1:10:42] her life amen I'm so grateful to the
[1:10:44] Lord amen amen it's it's been quite
[1:10:48] difficult
[1:10:49] um
[1:10:50] last week and this week she's taking
[1:10:52] care of me with low blood pressure blood
[1:10:56] pressure
[1:10:57] one time you go to like 72 I mean that
[1:11:00] that's the systolic was 72 the diastolic
[1:11:03] was like in the 50s and she was taking
[1:11:06] care of me amen and I I just I just
[1:11:10] thank God for her life amen amen and
[1:11:13] you know where we're taking this
[1:11:15] selfie
[1:11:17] after the preaching
[1:11:19] and then she was like
[1:11:22] as you know she calls me baby man she
[1:11:26] it's like big look look look I said look
[1:11:29] at what look at the butterfly he didn't
[1:11:33] want to leave
[1:11:35] there was a butterfly that came on my
[1:11:38] head
[1:11:39] and stood there and he didn't want to
[1:11:41] leave
[1:11:43] so I was like okay what what is going on
[1:11:46] and then the Lord dropped in my heart
[1:11:49] that you remember the preaching
[1:11:52] the minister was confirming something to
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:56] that becomes life amen
[1:11:59] amen and amen so what when the preaching
[1:12:02] comes from the pulpit and the Lord
[1:12:04] brings a manifestation amen he makes it
[1:12:08] living amen it is not a dead word but a
[1:12:12] Living Word
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:15] amen amen
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:21] so I
[1:12:23] I just want to talk about
[1:12:25] um
[1:12:25] what I'm preaching about tonight amen
[1:12:28] amen even if we started preaching amen
[1:12:32] this is my subject
[1:12:34] Christ is both Savior and Lord
[1:12:40] so with a subheading doors within the
[1:12:44] main door
[1:12:47] doors within the main door
[1:12:51] Christ is both savior
[1:12:54] and Lord
[1:12:56] now Brad Brown said that the problem we
[1:12:59] have is we keep Christ as the savior
[1:13:03] but not Lord
[1:13:09] now I still look at this and it's
[1:13:11] connected to the Rapture to me
[1:13:16] it is he said that we we always ask
[1:13:21] Christ to come to the main door
[1:13:24] and then ask him to stay at the entrance
[1:13:28] of the door
[1:13:30] but we have so many other doors
[1:13:36] we we without Christ okay you know be
[1:13:39] the be
[1:13:41] the Savior that means just stand at the
[1:13:43] entrance but those are the doors
[1:13:47] they are closed
[1:13:53] now how is Christ going to operate
[1:13:57] when we we make him to do that or we
[1:14:00] make him remain there
[1:14:03] why is he coming he's coming to fill up
[1:14:07] the whole house
[1:14:10] amen he's coming to fill up the horse
[1:14:14] but we asked him to stay at the entrance
[1:14:19] Amen brother Brown said that is making
[1:14:23] him just savior
[1:14:25] Baptist Lord
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] we can talk about how he delivered us we
[1:14:32] can talk about how he healed us of the
[1:14:34] grace of God I was here I was in that I
[1:14:37] was this and the Lord Lifted Me Up and
[1:14:39] that's it
[1:14:40] Beachbody
[1:14:44] no problem says that Christ is
[1:14:47] interested in even how you walk
[1:14:51] he's interested in even the food you are
[1:14:54] eating
[1:14:55] he's interested in your conversations
[1:14:57] he's interested in the places you're
[1:15:00] going to
[1:15:01] he's interested in your morning he's
[1:15:03] interested in your afternoon it's
[1:15:05] interesting your evening he's interested
[1:15:07] in your Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:15:09] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
[1:15:15] foreign
[1:15:26] we want to look at the concept of a
[1:15:28] house amen
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:32] now
[1:15:33] a house
[1:15:34] amen has a main door main entrance
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:41] let's let's just say that somebody comes
[1:15:44] visit you amen and you open up the main
[1:15:48] door
[1:15:50] people outside
[1:15:52] will say okay
[1:15:54] there's this visitor that is in Social
[1:15:57] and so's house right those outside will
[1:16:01] see always who who think
[1:16:07] that
[1:16:09] the visitor is in your house
[1:16:12] but the prophet said if the visitor
[1:16:15] can't come to your kitchen if the
[1:16:17] visitor can come to your living room
[1:16:20] what are you saying it means you're not
[1:16:23] welcome
[1:16:24] so many times amen we invite Christ
[1:16:30] to the main door and people outside
[1:16:33] think we have Christ but then we do not
[1:16:37] allow him to operate
[1:16:45] we are taking it slow amen
[1:16:49] just enjoy it like that sometimes we
[1:16:51] have ministers that come to shout and
[1:16:53] amen and amen amen the whole place will
[1:16:56] be on fire but sometimes we have we have
[1:16:58] these things that we sit down and listen
[1:17:00] to it and La Pond over it
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:10] no this this is how I was looking at it
[1:17:15] the main door is Christ
[1:17:18] connecting that with the concept of
[1:17:20] Christ in the bride
[1:17:22] the main door is Christ
[1:17:25] but Christ has a many members bride
[1:17:29] which are the various doors within the
[1:17:32] main house
[1:17:35] foreign
[1:18:05] he that had Clean Hands
[1:18:08] and a pure heart
[1:18:11] said that the hand has to do with
[1:18:15] manifestation you taking the word of God
[1:18:18] and doing it
[1:18:21] he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart
[1:18:23] who have not lifted up his soul unto
[1:18:28] vanity
[1:18:29] nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive
[1:18:32] the blessing from the Lord and
[1:18:34] righteousness from the god of his
[1:18:36] salvation
[1:18:37] this is the generation of them that seek
[1:18:40] him that seek that face oh Jacob sailor
[1:18:44] lift up your hearts
[1:18:46] all ye gates
[1:18:50] all you get
[1:18:52] this is typing something
[1:18:55] and being lift up
[1:18:58] ye Everlasting doors
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] and the king of glory shall come in
[1:19:11] lift up your heads oh you get
[1:19:14] and being lift up
[1:19:17] I'm just looking at bro
[1:19:19] ties this to the Old Testament since
[1:19:22] types it to the Rapture of the Old
[1:19:24] Testament Saints but it is typing Us in
[1:19:28] these last days
[1:19:30] problem connects that to the scripture
[1:19:33] that links to us
[1:19:35] the Rapture of the Bride
[1:19:39] I'm going to read quotes from that
[1:19:42] amen so who is this king of glory the
[1:19:45] lord strong and mighty
[1:19:47] the Lord might in battle amen lift up
[1:19:51] your head till he gets even lift them up
[1:19:54] ye Everlasting doors
[1:19:58] Everlasting doors
[1:20:01] that means we are predestinated before
[1:20:03] the foundation of the world to be
[1:20:05] Everlasting throughout eternal life amen
[1:20:08] and the king of glory shall come in who
[1:20:10] is the skin of glory the lord of hosts
[1:20:13] he is the king of glory Silla
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:19] I'm I'm going to read some quotes here
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:24] you want to stay in line with
[1:20:26] the prophet
[1:20:28] always
[1:20:33] now before I come to the king of glory I
[1:20:36] just want to read a letter about uh what
[1:20:38] the prophet talks about
[1:20:40] being savior
[1:20:42] and being Lord amen
[1:20:45] this from
[1:20:46] the message the door to the heart
[1:20:49] amen it's not let's examine was preached
[1:20:53] in 58 I said now let's examine some of
[1:20:57] these doors one of them is a little door
[1:21:00] of self
[1:21:01] you know that's an important little door
[1:21:04] in fact down the line I'll come to the
[1:21:07] doors that uh babram talked about but
[1:21:09] just this summer he said you say oh yes
[1:21:12] Jesus I'll receive you as my savior but
[1:21:15] now don't meddle in my business
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:22] I said that's the attitude of lots of
[1:21:25] Christians so-called now I want to live
[1:21:28] my own life
[1:21:31] but I don't want you
[1:21:33] so he says Jesus is already your savior
[1:21:36] don't meddle with my business
[1:21:40] and you don't
[1:21:42] you don't stand and talk to Jesus like
[1:21:45] that it is your attitude
[1:21:52] I want you to keep me from hell but
[1:21:55] don't meddle in my affairs
[1:21:58] well then the prophet said Jesus can't
[1:22:01] have the preeminence
[1:22:04] Jesus can't be your lord
[1:22:07] because you want to be your own ruler
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:15] now this is from the message at the
[1:22:17] unity of one God in one church he said
[1:22:20] he heals their soul and their body he
[1:22:22] takes the control room
[1:22:25] if you got fears and doubts just let it
[1:22:28] go now let him begin let him come in and
[1:22:33] take over
[1:22:34] let him be Lord Lord is ruler lordship
[1:22:39] is rulership
[1:22:42] amen is is it's just like a husband and
[1:22:46] a wife
[1:22:48] you know I mean
[1:22:50] at the beginning
[1:22:52] before you even get married amen with
[1:22:55] all um this I had a dream I saw blue
[1:22:58] colors I saw pink matching together and
[1:23:01] you were the pink you all those words
[1:23:04] they are so sweet amen and in fact we've
[1:23:09] all gone through that before we man it's
[1:23:11] all sweet amen and
[1:23:13] your your your first uh stage in in
[1:23:17] marital life amen things I mean things
[1:23:21] are going so beautiful we're not oh you
[1:23:23] know the husband is buying things and
[1:23:25] things get so
[1:23:26] sweet at the beginning stages
[1:23:30] right
[1:23:31] now
[1:23:34] we want to talk about lordship
[1:23:38] yes sir
[1:23:40] that is where we have a lot of problems
[1:23:43] in marriages
[1:23:46] because the man is not bringing you to
[1:23:49] the home
[1:23:50] for fairy tale
[1:23:56] he's bringing you to the home
[1:23:59] to face reality
[1:24:03] without lordship in that home
[1:24:07] the marriage is going to be a big
[1:24:09] problem
[1:24:10] foreign
[1:24:13] that's the same way with Christ
[1:24:16] I'm
[1:24:18] as we've had we are the feminine version
[1:24:21] of God
[1:24:23] amen so the husband is also a wife
[1:24:29] to Christ
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:32] amen and and and and
[1:24:35] assert Christ
[1:24:37] becomes the Lord of that husband
[1:24:40] that husband cannot replicate lordship
[1:24:47] thank you my brother
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:51] because when when the husband is able to
[1:24:54] understand how to be a wife
[1:24:57] it becomes easy to understand their wife
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:06] the same way
[1:25:08] when the wife
[1:25:09] is able to be a wife to Christ
[1:25:13] she can understand how to be a wife to
[1:25:16] the husband
[1:25:19] reach my
[1:25:21] brother amen
[1:25:23] so it goes everywhere amen amen amen
[1:25:29] the message is talking about Redemption
[1:25:32] amen and and and our homes is the
[1:25:36] message of the hour
[1:25:38] what goes on in our homes
[1:25:40] it's just preaching the message of the
[1:25:42] hour
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:47] it says
[1:25:49] this is from Queen of Sheba and she's
[1:25:51] the one say father may people believe it
[1:25:54] as truth and receive thee tonight as
[1:25:57] their healer
[1:25:58] as their savior as their King as their
[1:26:02] lord
[1:26:03] lordship to cover
[1:26:07] to rule in their lives
[1:26:09] Grant the Lord and I believe that's our
[1:26:12] prayer tonight
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:18] I want to talk about uh the skin of
[1:26:20] glory amen he said
[1:26:23] he said when he conquered death that's
[1:26:27] restoration of the Bright Tree in 62
[1:26:29] when conquered death held grave sickness
[1:26:33] rose on the third day he ascended on
[1:26:36] high and led captivity captive
[1:26:39] what was it
[1:26:41] those that were in captive had looked
[1:26:44] forward for the promise that we have now
[1:26:47] he's talking about the Old Testament
[1:26:49] things he said oh brother never even had
[1:26:53] the Holy Ghost they didn't have the Holy
[1:26:55] Ghost but believed and give a good
[1:26:58] testimony
[1:27:00] and by it they stuck the mouth of lions
[1:27:03] quenched the violence of fire escape the
[1:27:07] edge of the sword women received their
[1:27:10] dead race to life again without their
[1:27:12] promise
[1:27:13] said oh but they looked forward under a
[1:27:17] ship sacrifice that could not divorce
[1:27:20] sin It could only cover sin but they
[1:27:23] believed that there was coming one
[1:27:26] and by their faith
[1:27:29] Way Beyond The Shadow amen they claimed
[1:27:32] it and steadfast they've wandered in
[1:27:35] deserts and ship skins and goat skins
[1:27:38] was afflicted and destitute and
[1:27:40] tormented all those people looking
[1:27:43] forward to that resurrection and truth
[1:27:46] that died in faith with a testimony and
[1:27:49] on that Easter morning
[1:27:51] that law of God which was spoke the word
[1:27:55] true Joe and those are the prophets they
[1:27:58] rest from the dead said oh my
[1:28:01] not this
[1:28:05] in the message the Rapture 65 he said
[1:28:08] David said over there lift up ye
[1:28:10] Everlasting Gates and be lifted up he
[1:28:14] let captivity captive and give gifts
[1:28:16] unto men when the Old Testament sent
[1:28:18] went in with him they said who is the
[1:28:22] skin of righteousness the Lord Of Glory
[1:28:25] Mighty in hosts Mighty hosts here they
[1:28:29] come in marching

[1:29:33] raptured into Glory we which are alive
[1:29:36] and remain that's the body that's left

[1:30:37] of Peace as director of our part granted
[1:30:40] Lord we ask it in the name of him that
[1:30:44] taught us
[1:30:46] all to pray
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:50] the prophet is linking this thing to our
[1:30:54] rapture
[1:30:56] pin up these dogs
[1:30:58] and let that king of glory come in
[1:31:04] I don't know if I'm making any sense
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:07] open up these doors and let the skin of
[1:31:11] Glory come in
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:17] I just hope we have enough time to Max
[1:31:20] in bed
[1:31:23] let us go back to
[1:31:25] um
[1:31:27] Romans chapter 12.
[1:31:34] said I beside you therefore bravery
[1:31:37] by the mercies of God
[1:31:40] that he present your bodies
[1:31:48] the natural man
[1:31:51] amen present your body is a Living
[1:31:55] Sacrifice holy no he's talking he's
[1:31:58] talking to Brethren who has saved
[1:32:02] Brethren who
[1:32:05] said I'm taking Jesus that's my Lord a
[1:32:07] personal savior
[1:32:10] he's telling them that let there be a
[1:32:13] manifestation that comes to your bodies
[1:32:22] he said holy acceptable unto God which
[1:32:25] is your reasonable service
[1:32:27] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:32:31] be it transformed
[1:32:35] be transformed
[1:32:38] by the renewing of your mind so it's
[1:32:41] starting from somewhere a spiritual
[1:32:43] battle is starting from somewhere in the
[1:32:46] spirit that might count that brings a
[1:32:49] transformation to your body
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:55] be transformed by the renew of your mind
[1:32:57] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:33:02] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:33:07] amen
[1:33:09] that's the
[1:33:10] brings us to what program talks about
[1:33:12] what sin is
[1:33:16] so it starts in the spiritual and
[1:33:19] manifest in the physical
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:24] that is I see the rupture
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:31] the Rapture has an aim of coming to
[1:33:34] transform this body
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] transformation
[1:33:43] what a transformation
[1:33:48] not from the message power of
[1:33:50] transformation
[1:33:52] 65. it says to be transformed is to be
[1:33:57] changed and make something different
[1:33:59] it's like a tadpole let's transformed
[1:34:01] from a tadpole to a front C once he
[1:34:05] looked like a catfish or when she
[1:34:08] attacked sometimes you look at those
[1:34:10] days when we're kids
[1:34:12] while we're going to play in the river
[1:34:14] amen when we see those Star Pool we
[1:34:16] thought they were fishes and then you
[1:34:18] try to catch them you realize that
[1:34:20] somebody tells you that no those are
[1:34:23] frogs you're like okay you didn't do a
[1:34:27] frog they look like catfish amen so so
[1:34:32] the prophet said once he looked like a
[1:34:34] catfish he swims around
[1:34:37] he's got a head and he's and he's still
[1:34:41] and everything looks like a catfish
[1:34:44] you
[1:34:46] what when that Master comes to the main
[1:34:49] door people think you are Christian
[1:34:53] so you are looking like a catfish
[1:34:59] then after a while he begins to lose
[1:35:02] he loses a tail and he's transformed
[1:35:05] from one species to another
[1:35:08] so that transformation it is allowing
[1:35:12] Christ to get to all these doors
[1:35:15] because their intention
[1:35:17] is that all these doors look like the
[1:35:22] main door
[1:35:23] [Applause]
[1:35:24] these doors are the many membered body
[1:35:27] of Christ now Christ who is the main
[1:35:29] door is trying to transform all these
[1:35:32] doors to look like him
[1:35:37] amen act like him I think that's what
[1:35:41] Paul must have had in mind when he said
[1:35:44] be transformed by the renewal let's see
[1:35:47] let me get that right and be not
[1:35:50] conformed
[1:35:51] amen be not conformed to this world but
[1:35:54] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:35:56] mind renewing of your mind the things
[1:35:58] that you once start upon to be precious
[1:36:02] lay that aside and be transformed to
[1:36:05] something else
[1:36:08] yes sir yes
[1:36:09] things that you're talking with precious
[1:36:12] to you
[1:36:13] he said lay them aside and be
[1:36:16] transformed to something else
[1:36:19] you might think this tadpole looks like
[1:36:21] a catfish it looks so precious
[1:36:24] but that is not the main aim it's
[1:36:26] supposed to be a frog
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] I said oh that's what we all want to
[1:36:35] know how to do it
[1:36:38] is that we are here we love him he saved
[1:36:41] us now we want to know what to do and we
[1:36:44] are trying to take a little step this
[1:36:46] evening to raise up just a little bit
[1:36:50] higher sometimes we have to hate things
[1:36:54] you just hold on for a few but brother
[1:36:56] sometimes you have to hit things
[1:36:59] what are those things
[1:37:02] don't meddle in my business
[1:37:09] sometimes the pastor needs to hate
[1:37:13] things
[1:37:16] our personal business
[1:37:20] and and I I I I'm talking about the kind
[1:37:23] of friends you have you know we've been
[1:37:26] friends for years I mean
[1:37:28] I mean we've been going out for years
[1:37:32] amen
[1:37:33] and and this person is taking you off
[1:37:37] the Life of Christ
[1:37:40] but when the word of God comes you say
[1:37:42] don't meddle in my business
[1:37:50] your lord
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:54] I said now we want to be transformed
[1:37:57] ourselves by the renewing of our mind
[1:38:00] see not what we have on this Earth
[1:38:04] what we are going to look for on this
[1:38:07] Earth
[1:38:07] but as I said
[1:38:09] what we are going to look for on this
[1:38:11] Earth but what we are coming
[1:38:14] to in the world that is to come it's not
[1:38:18] what we are looking for in this Earth
[1:38:20] but what we are coming to
[1:38:23] in the world to come
[1:38:26] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:38:31] amen same message he said and I believe
[1:38:34] it was David said I would rather be a
[1:38:36] doormat at the house of the Lord than to
[1:38:39] do all intents with the wicked you see
[1:38:41] no matter what it is take my place
[1:38:44] sometimes you have to separate from
[1:38:47] everything that's dear on Earth to you
[1:38:50] to take your position that God has
[1:38:52] called you to
[1:38:54] I'm sure you can read between the lines
[1:38:56] what I'm saying
[1:38:59] see that sometimes the very dearest
[1:39:01] person on Earth
[1:39:03] you have to shake hands with them and
[1:39:07] take your position in Christ to where
[1:39:09] God has called you
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:17] but what's God doing transforming you
[1:39:21] from what you want
[1:39:23] maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it
[1:39:25] is from a lovely
[1:39:28] firmly sometimes a lovely family
[1:39:31] we've got we've got families that are so
[1:39:34] sweet and so nice
[1:39:36] sometimes you're just praise the Lord
[1:39:38] can you make a wizard you also get a
[1:39:40] portion in heaven
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:46] those are the hot stuff
[1:39:49] from a lovely family sometimes he places
[1:39:52] you somewhere else because it is his way
[1:39:57] of doing it
[1:39:58] see by the renewing of your mind to obey
[1:40:01] the word of God regardless of what the
[1:40:04] price is
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:09] the flashing red lights of the sign of
[1:40:12] his coming in 63.
[1:40:15] so we thank thee for Jesus Christ who
[1:40:18] made it possible that we could be back
[1:40:20] into Divine fellowship with thee again
[1:40:22] through the shedding of his innocent
[1:40:24] blood
[1:40:25] that truth that propitiation of that
[1:40:28] blood we now are Sons and Daughters of
[1:40:31] God
[1:40:32] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:40:35] at the end but we know we'll be like him
[1:40:38] for we shall see him as he is
[1:40:42] and father that's all sufficient for us
[1:40:45] as long as we are like him standing in
[1:40:50] the form of his image
[1:40:52] he said that now father we do not want
[1:40:55] to be at this hour conformed to the
[1:40:58] things of the world
[1:40:59] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:41:02] our spirit by the holy ghost that he
[1:41:05] might come and take our lives into his
[1:41:08] own care that is lordship
[1:41:12] amen and will lead us and guide us for
[1:41:15] what days we have left upon the Earth
[1:41:18] and magnify his great name we thank you
[1:41:21] for all these things and with
[1:41:23] expectations we look for your visit with
[1:41:25] us tonight
[1:41:27] that is expectation tonight amen as
[1:41:30] you've gathered him now and believing
[1:41:31] that you meet with us as you promised in
[1:41:34] Jesus name
[1:41:36] amen amen
[1:41:40] I want to take this also from
[1:41:46] the message part of transformation The
[1:41:48] Stone 65 amen
[1:41:50] just trying to hurry up amen that's what
[1:41:53] we all want to do is be not conformed to
[1:41:57] this world
[1:41:58] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:42:00] our mind to do the perfect and
[1:42:02] acceptable will of God now that we have
[1:42:05] been saved
[1:42:08] now that we have been saved
[1:42:10] as we are
[1:42:12] and that we have been filled with the
[1:42:15] Holy Spirit
[1:42:16] as we have
[1:42:19] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:42:23] to be in us that we might be transformed
[1:42:27] from the Natural Things of life
[1:42:32] transform from the Natural Things of
[1:42:34] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:42:38] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:42:41] spirit by his word
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:47] talking about transformation
[1:42:50] transformation
[1:42:52] what I'm trying to say transformation
[1:42:55] has to do with this body
[1:42:59] amen it starts in the spirit
[1:43:03] and comes to manifest in the body
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:11] amen
[1:43:15] I
[1:43:18] so um I just took a few notes from this
[1:43:23] message
[1:43:26] amen
[1:43:27] I I believe we we might be closing very
[1:43:30] shortly the doors indoor
[1:43:34] the prophet said Jesus wants to be Lord
[1:43:37] not just savior
[1:43:39] he wants rulership
[1:43:43] amen now
[1:43:46] he talks about
[1:43:48] a main door now now we want to get into
[1:43:51] this he talks about main door to your
[1:43:54] heart
[1:43:56] so Jesus Christ comes to your heart as a
[1:43:59] savior
[1:44:01] now he talks about three main doors
[1:44:06] after Jesus comes into your heart
[1:44:09] and he said there's one at the right
[1:44:10] side
[1:44:12] called the door of pride
[1:44:18] right side
[1:44:20] oh my goodness
[1:44:22] that door of pride the prophet said that
[1:44:25] I am so so and so
[1:44:31] I am this I am that oh Christ you saved
[1:44:35] me oh my Lord I'm happy
[1:44:38] now
[1:44:39] he wants to change you
[1:44:43] I am so sorry so I I'm
[1:44:46] I'm trying to give an example like we in
[1:44:50] Ghana
[1:44:52] from Ghana amen
[1:44:54] amen we have what you call day boards
[1:44:59] like let's say you're born on a Monday
[1:45:03] um they give you a name
[1:45:06] depending on what kind of tribe you came
[1:45:09] from and on Tuesday you have names and
[1:45:12] all that
[1:45:13] and people
[1:45:15] take upon themselves those names
[1:45:20] okay I was born on a Wednesday I'm using
[1:45:24] myself an example I was born on a
[1:45:27] Wednesday and this is our Wednesday
[1:45:29] bones behave
[1:45:38] so when you begin to misbehave
[1:45:43] and then they come to you and try to
[1:45:46] correct you they correct your life
[1:45:49] you're like you know Wednesday boys this
[1:45:51] is how we behave
[1:45:53] oh my goodness
[1:45:58] the prophet is saying he wants to be
[1:46:00] your lord
[1:46:03] he wants to come to that door
[1:46:06] of selfishness
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:11] he wants to rule
[1:46:14] a a through that door take away who you
[1:46:18] think you are and be the pride of Christ
[1:46:26] amen that's a very hard door to knock on
[1:46:33] Hitman
[1:46:35] I'm not talking about you
[1:46:38] realizing who you are in the world
[1:46:41] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:46:43] because we are supposed to be the one
[1:46:46] the bride of Christ this is our mirror
[1:46:48] we look into it and it tells us who we
[1:46:51] are
[1:46:54] that's not what I'm talking about I'm
[1:46:55] talking about you born insane shift in
[1:46:58] iniquity coming speaking lies you are
[1:47:02] born on them on a Wednesday okay I am a
[1:47:06] quick cuckoo
[1:47:07] that's that's how we call Wednesday boss
[1:47:16] yeah so no that that that's not it
[1:47:20] God wants to take preeminence over that
[1:47:24] door
[1:47:27] the person next to that door
[1:47:29] is a door of private life oh my
[1:47:34] God that's another hard one
[1:47:37] your privileges your money your dressing
[1:47:40] where you visit your body movement
[1:47:45] even the music you listen to
[1:47:54] see that there's this question
[1:47:57] that would always need to ask ourselves
[1:48:02] what I'm doing
[1:48:04] assuming Jesus is standing there
[1:48:07] am I going to behave the same way
[1:48:12] that is lordship
[1:48:15] the way I talk to a brother or the way I
[1:48:18] talk to a sister if Jesus was standing
[1:48:21] there
[1:48:22] did I do it right
[1:48:28] the way the way
[1:48:30] um
[1:48:31] I reacted when when the preaching came
[1:48:34] now I'm bringing it home
[1:48:36] the way I reacted when the preaching
[1:48:38] came
[1:48:40] did I really see Jesus talking to me
[1:48:47] if I really believe Jesus Christ was
[1:48:50] talking to me
[1:48:52] why that reaction
[1:48:55] so I'm saying Jesus you can rule over my
[1:49:00] business
[1:49:05] amen
[1:49:08] this kind of preaching that makes us
[1:49:11] look so quiet amen amen amen
[1:49:16] it's it's it it soaks deep down and we
[1:49:20] sit down we Ponder variety
[1:49:23] oh
[1:49:25] I I'm not saying I've had everything
[1:49:28] perfect amen because when I was the
[1:49:31] prophet said that you the minister you
[1:49:34] are the first person that the word comes
[1:49:36] to you have to correct your life first
[1:49:40] amen
[1:49:41] so I'm preaching to myself
[1:49:45] amen
[1:49:46] so
[1:49:47] the person let's do that is the door fit
[1:49:51] I'm just closing
[1:49:53] That Door of Faith is your previously
[1:49:57] held
[1:49:58] beliefs
[1:50:03] that's a hard one
[1:50:06] previously held beliefs
[1:50:11] amen when the word of God is coming to
[1:50:14] you
[1:50:16] do you use your previously held beliefs
[1:50:19] to block their way
[1:50:22] what you knew in the message for years
[1:50:26] and the spirit of God is explaining to
[1:50:29] you and you are seeing it being
[1:50:32] Vindicated from scripture to scripture
[1:50:34] what you already had
[1:50:38] 20 years 30 years 40 years in the
[1:50:41] message
[1:50:43] are you going to open up
[1:50:45] for the word to come and clear things up
[1:50:49] and correct this in your life
[1:50:55] amen
[1:50:57] amen
[1:51:00] there's there there's this thing I'm I'm
[1:51:02] closing I've said I'm closing for a
[1:51:06] number of times
[1:51:09] there's this thing that
[1:51:12] Believers okay we are amongst Believers
[1:51:16] we want to clean ourselves up okay
[1:51:20] say about
[1:51:22] the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:25] believing the message of your day
[1:51:29] now I believe that a hundred percent
[1:51:33] amen but
[1:51:36] the application of it
[1:51:40] amen
[1:51:42] they believe the message of the day
[1:51:45] so when you are in sin
[1:51:48] they think that they have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:52] the message of your day now becomes your
[1:51:55] comfort zone
[1:52:00] amen
[1:52:02] your message believer becomes a comfort
[1:52:05] zone
[1:52:06] that's a door of faith that you are
[1:52:09] holding
[1:52:10] but intellectual exactly that you are
[1:52:13] holding on to
[1:52:14] but Christ wants to open the
[1:52:17] understanding for you to see that the
[1:52:20] message of your day is a manifestation
[1:52:23] in your flesh
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:28] amen it is not just knowing it in your
[1:52:32] head
[1:52:33] amen it's a manifestation in your flesh
[1:52:36] so when you are doing something wrong it
[1:52:38] doesn't matter if you're going to a
[1:52:40] message church or you're believing the
[1:52:42] sales where you're believing the time
