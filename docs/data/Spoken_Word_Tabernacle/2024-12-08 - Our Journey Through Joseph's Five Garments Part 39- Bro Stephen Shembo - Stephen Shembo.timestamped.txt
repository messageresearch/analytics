[46:46] glory to God young men meeting we are
[46:50] I'm waiting for the confirmation brother
[46:53] JM and brother Enoch but it's going to
[46:55] be in February
[47:02] 2025 anyway I'm going to say
[47:04] [Laughter]
[47:06] something young Sisters Meeting we had a
[47:09] wonderful meeting
[47:17] yesterday if they clapping their hand it
[47:20] means they really got something really
[47:23] really good because that was fresh from
[47:25] the throne the script I read over and
[47:28] over and over and over and I'm praying
[47:31] throughout the day early in the morning
[47:32] going around and the Holy Spirit dropped
[47:34] that scripture for me to talk to them
[47:37] and now they understand clearly because
[47:39] the woman is the
[47:40] body ask them they will tell you and the
[47:44] man is the head ask them they will tell
[47:46] you so when you go into courtship you're
[47:49] looking for what
[47:50] sisters you heard them you're looking
[47:52] for the
[47:54] head right it's the mystery ask them
[47:58] they will give you the scripture and the
[48:00] quot and everything and you will
[48:02] understand what it
[48:04] means you always pull my time and then
[48:08] before you know it I don't have time I'm
[48:09] running out of time
[48:12] amen can I tell them a little
[48:14] [Music]
[48:15] [Laughter]
[48:19] bit so I have to respect what they
[48:22] say amen amen Matthew uh my kids the
[48:28] second and the third one I don't know
[48:30] where they got this from but uh either
[48:32] it was cooc or whatever
[48:36] so they develop something when someone
[48:39] is having something they are one will
[48:41] come and say can you share can you share
[48:45] and the other will share and wait for a
[48:47] really good meal and then go straight
[48:50] ahead and say can you share so young s
[48:52] say can you
[48:54] share can you share
[49:02] okay I'm just going to share a little
[49:04] bit and I'll keep the other one amen
[49:08] Paul says that the head of Christ is
[49:15] who is
[49:17] God and then
[49:20] Christ but we know what these two are we
[49:24] clear you right and Paul say that the
[49:27] head of a man is who
[49:30] CH and Paul say that the head of a woman
[49:33] is
[49:35] who it's like a
[49:37] hierarchy
[49:39] amen but Paul didn't say the head of
[49:43] Christ is God and stop
[49:45] there he continue on the same verse he
[49:48] said the head of Christ is God but he
[49:51] didn't stop there then he says that the
[49:54] head of a man is Christ and he didn't
[49:57] stop there and he says that the head of
[49:59] a woman is a man amen that's why Jesus
[50:04] say I do
[50:10] nothing is my microphone clear is my
[50:14] microphone clear can you hear me well
[50:17] Jesus say I do nothing except I see who
[50:21] father my father doing it so Jesus has
[50:25] head a head
[50:27] this head is not this
[50:31] scull ask the young
[50:34] sister amen the head we talking about
[50:37] here is not this skull here because
[50:40] Jesus the man Jesus had one but Jesus
[50:44] say I do nothing except the father shows
[50:48] me and me and my father we are so the
[50:53] head of Christ was in Christ
[50:57] [Applause]
[51:00] are we together are we clear that's
[51:03] number one then Paul says we check this
[51:07] one Paul says that the head of a
[51:11] man is who so my head is not this
[51:19] one this house my
[51:24] brain but the head of every men is who
[51:27] Christ and then Paul continue he said
[51:30] the head of every woman is who but what
[51:34] can the man the man that have the head
[51:40] Crist say
[51:43] Amen so women so young sister in the
[51:47] courtship they're looking for the head
[51:50] that have the
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:55] head so they one that will qualify to
[51:58] marry you is a man that have
[52:02] trust if the man doesn't have TR cut him
[52:06] off you need a genuine
[52:10] [Applause]
[52:13] believer that's why Paul say
[52:16] follow as a follow CHR so when you
[52:20] follow the husband you are not following
[52:22] your husband you are following Christ in
[52:25] your husband
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:35] now you won't Force the woman to obey
[52:38] you because the woman is obeying the
[52:41] Christ in
[52:44] you you won't force your husband to love
[52:47] you because husband love your wife as
[52:51] has loved how can you love your wife
[52:55] like Christ if you don't have
[53:04] Christ the young sister T me to give you
[53:07] only a little bit so I stop right here
[53:10] the remaining you need to consult the
[53:13] young
[53:14] sisters they're the only one that can
[53:17] give you the remaining amen

[55:12] a different direction we took four years
[55:15] of intensive work where we had to lay
[55:18] the foundation of this church you should
[55:21] not have any question at this time we
[55:24] went everything is on YouTube YouTube
[55:26] the majority of them I can say 80% is on
[55:29] YouTube why we don't wear earring it's
[55:32] on YouTube we give you scripture we give
[55:34] you quot why our skirt have to be longer
[55:38] we give you scripture and we give you
[55:40] quote why we don't wear makeup why we
[55:43] don't wear this why we don't do this why
[55:45] we doing all of this why do we believe
[55:48] things the way we believe I took
[55:49] scripture on the unchanging pattern and
[55:52] I went scripture by scripture so the
[55:54] foundation is already laid there so if
[55:56] you come and ask me a question I tell
[55:58] you go back on YouTube you will see it
[56:00] for free you can review you can pick up
[56:02] the note and move on that was the years
[56:05] where we were laying the foundation now
[56:08] the corner I'm changing the corner
[56:10] because I'm taking a different direction
[56:12] following the spirit of the Lord that
[56:13] has been said next year we have question
[56:16] and answer every three
[56:19] month if you heard me okay so whoever
[56:22] missed those question and answer you
[56:23] will begin to remind me if you ask me a
[56:25] question say go see that question and
[56:28] answer we see it over there amen so
[56:30] question and answer no more every month
[56:32] now question and answer every three mon
[56:35] so if you miss it again then there is
[56:37] nothing I can do you need to see the
[56:39] Deacon and talk to them and visit their
[56:41] home so they can give it to you and
[56:42] everything so next year question and
[56:45] answer January after January the next
[56:47] one will be in April and the next one so
[56:49] we have only four question and answer in
[56:52] a year any question so far are we clear

[57:02] December I will finish but things
[57:05] continue to open up and open up and open
[57:09] up I don't have any choice I have to
[57:11] deliver what the Lord give to me so the
[57:14] next couple meeting will be in
[57:19] March so December part four March part
[57:23] five then we seal this subject
[57:26] completely so you have any more question
[57:29] continue to put your question in a
[57:30] question box then we will deal with it
[57:32] so now you have three
[57:35] month to prepare if you miss it's not me
[57:40] for question and answer you have three
[57:42] months for one question and answer to
[57:44] prepare so if you don't show up it's not
[57:47] me I did the best to be available the
[57:49] best that I can four years back to back
[57:52] to make sure you are well furnished and
[57:55] well prepared and everything is settled
[57:58] pretty good so if you've been missing
[57:59] this and missing this and missing this
[58:01] and when trial comes you begin to
[58:03] struggle it is not my fault you're the
[58:06] one that didn't manage your time God is
[58:10] Sovereign amen the sovereignty of God is
[58:13] something we need to understand I don't
[58:16] know if you understand what I'm saying
[58:18] in other word when God speak to me I
[58:20] cannot tell God wait till I get home and
[58:24] you can give it to me because God is
[58:27] Sovereign so whenever I'm going an
[58:30] inspiration can
[58:32] come amen I might be driving a car and
[58:35] the inspiration dropped because I was
[58:37] praying so when it drop every time I'm
[58:39] going to stop quickly I will pull my
[58:42] phone and write down whatever I receive
[58:46] I will not tell God no not now wait when
[58:48] I finish when I sleep I wake up then you
[58:51] come and give me inspiration that's not
[58:53] the way God operate God is s
[58:56] in other words certain things that God
[58:59] want you to hear at a certain time you
[59:01] need to make an effort that's right to
[59:04] seize the opportunity and the time that
[59:07] God want to talk to you because if you
[59:09] miss that opportunity God will continue
[59:12] to move and it's going to be you
[59:14] catching up we all busy we will never
[59:16] have nothing to do in this world we have

[59:25] preeminence amen amen if we say we
[59:29] dismiss church right now everybody here
[59:31] have something to do but we got to put
[59:33] everything aside to give also God his
[59:36] time if you don't learn that discipline
[59:39] you will miss God in many things and
[59:41] when God want to give something you have
[59:43] something else to do when God want to
[59:44] give you something you have something
[59:45] else to do before you know it he found

[1:04:17] scripture so thank brother Mike
[1:04:22] Del he's somewhere you will see him amen

[1:04:47] there is no end there I'm the one who

[1:04:52] I don't want to add anything to the
[1:04:54] Scripture it say he who is god with
[1:04:58] judges among the gods so the
[1:05:02] congregation of the
[1:05:04] M if you go inside you will find God's
[1:05:07] there so he tells you who's in that
[1:05:09] congregation it's God's now you

[1:09:18] connected to power and to
[1:09:22] Authority listen to what brother
[1:09:24] brandham say

[1:09:57] are
[1:09:59] one how can they be one Amen brother
[1:10:03] Bram said the two books being one The
[1:10:08] Book of
[1:10:10] Life The First Book of Life coming up
[1:10:15] was when you were born that was your
[1:10:18] what natural
[1:10:20] birth brother Bram says that the first
[1:10:24] the one that come com first is this one
[1:10:27] amen this is the book of your life which
[1:10:31] life natural life we clear now amen but
[1:10:35] there is another book of your life which
[1:10:37] life a Divine life amen but both of
[1:10:41] these belong to one individual
[1:10:44] amen amen amen so meaning this one could
[1:10:47] be an
[1:10:49] American but this one is a Heavenly
[1:10:53] being are we together Amen brother Bram
[1:10:57] say the First Book of Life coming up was
[1:11:01] when you were born that was your natural
[1:11:05] birth are we together amen you say see
[1:11:09] but then one time way back down in there
[1:11:15] there was a little what grain of
[1:11:18] life so now we begin to understand that
[1:11:22] this individual has two
[1:11:27] he has an outside
[1:11:29] nature amen which is a natural one
[1:11:33] depending on the country which is
[1:11:37] American and then inside this person
[1:11:40] there is another one an inside nature
[1:11:44] this one is
[1:11:46] divine because it's coming from Heaven
[1:11:50] amen amen Amen brother Bram say when you
[1:11:53] are born this one is quickened oh
[1:11:56] because we born in sin shaping iniquity
[1:12:00] coming into this world speaking lies
[1:12:02] nobody teach you how to lie it's
[1:12:05] automatically it goes in amen amen but
[1:12:08] even though you lying and drinking and
[1:12:10] doing all kind of stuff brother brandham
[1:12:13] said but then one time way back down in
[1:12:16] there there was a little grain of life
[1:12:20] that's right as I was explaining to some
[1:12:22] of you young sisters at the house this
[1:12:25] [Laughter]
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:32] afternoon young sisters should say
[1:12:36] amen that's why we CAU brother
[1:12:39] Bram because this message it looks like
[1:12:42] it's still
[1:12:43] alive and it is
[1:12:46] alive Amen brother Bram say I was
[1:12:49] talking to Young sisters at the house
[1:12:51] this afternoon there is an another quot
[1:12:53] right there and there is a little grain
[1:12:55] of Life laying there that you
[1:12:59] wonder where did I come
[1:13:03] from what these strange things brother
[1:13:07] Bram is saying sometime when you were
[1:13:10] growing
[1:13:11] up for some reason you stop and you say
[1:13:15] where did I come
[1:13:18] from you look at the sky you say who
[1:13:22] created this Sky they say God God God
[1:13:25] God okay this is my father this is my
[1:13:28] mother but before I was born where was
[1:13:32] I did have you ever thought about that
[1:13:36] brother Bram said the one that was
[1:13:38] thinking like
[1:13:42] that is not the
[1:13:46] American because the American is satisfi
[1:13:49] in the United States but it's not you it
[1:13:52] is the other nature don't know if you're
[1:13:55] getting
[1:13:56] me that was thinking in other word
[1:13:59] automatically Your Divine Nature was
[1:14:03] calling out for something else but you
[1:14:06] thought it was you that was really
[1:14:09] thinking
[1:14:12] it let me let me re explain again
[1:14:16] brother Bram is saying here that
[1:14:18] sometime you sit down as a kid and you
[1:14:22] say where did I come from
[1:14:26] okay before okay they say mama I was in
[1:14:29] my mama's belly that's the way kids talk
[1:14:32] and then I came out so before I was from
[1:14:36] my mama B where was
[1:14:39] I when you begin to ask those question
[1:14:43] it's a good
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:47] sign it is telling you you have
[1:14:49] something
[1:14:51] Divine that is working and pulling for
[1:14:55] another Nation I don't know if we're
[1:14:58] together so when you were asking those
[1:15:01] question automatically the divine nature
[1:15:04] was in you
[1:15:05] working even though you were unaware you
[1:15:09] thought you were the one thinking it
[1:15:11] today it was not you it was the other
[1:15:14] you are we together brother Bram say I
[1:15:17] was saying this taking for myself like
[1:15:21] you was going to say William Bram well 4
[1:15:25] years ago the William Maran brandham is
[1:15:28] not the same one
[1:15:31] tonight why if somebody back there would
[1:15:35] say William brandham he was a rank
[1:15:41] Rascal that's the nature he was born
[1:15:43] with see because I was born of who
[1:15:48] Charles and a
[1:15:51] Bram I'm reading brother Bram in their
[1:15:54] name
[1:15:56] they were American in their nature I was
[1:16:00] a sinner I came to the word a what a
[1:16:03] liar and all the habits of the world lay
[1:16:06] right where in me
[1:16:11] but in the midst of all this
[1:16:15] mess down in the two was another nature
[1:16:21] present that was how predestinated was
[1:16:25] in there by who God Amen am we clear in
[1:16:31] the same
[1:16:33] body to Nature in
[1:16:38] there how do I know I have two nature
[1:16:42] remember the question you were asking
[1:16:44] yourself it was a signal that there is
[1:16:46] another nature in you that is calling
[1:16:49] for something higher but you were born
[1:16:51] in sin born from sex from our parent
[1:16:55] amen coming into this world speaking
[1:16:57] lies brother Bram continue he said well
[1:17:00] I only C to
[1:17:04] one do you know what the word ker
[1:17:08] means ask your sister we tell you very
[1:17:12] good huh
[1:17:14] C to c means to bring
[1:17:21] food and
[1:17:23] drink in a professional way usually in
[1:17:27] other words you are
[1:17:29] nourishing that's right you are
[1:17:33] supplying are we together and brother
[1:17:36] Bram say he C he nourish
[1:17:40] one amen amen he said I C to one as he
[1:17:46] grow so that nature can grow right he
[1:17:50] good as a baby so when that nature is
[1:17:53] growing it will begin to act like a baby
[1:17:56] first amen D first thing you know I
[1:18:00] become a lion so the more you C to that
[1:18:04] nature later on that nature will begin
[1:18:07] to express
[1:18:09] itself the more you feed that
[1:18:12] nature are we together that nature will
[1:18:15] Express itself and then I become a liar
[1:18:19] become everything else that is a what
[1:18:23] because I raise up the way
[1:18:25] but down in there was a little speck of
[1:18:28] life when all the time is cing to the
[1:18:32] bad nature make you a professional
[1:18:34] singer s how about cing to the other
[1:18:38] nature amen that's why it's important to
[1:18:42] read the Bible amen that's why it's
[1:18:44] important to listen to the message amen
[1:18:47] because now you are turning you are
[1:18:49] taking your time to begin to nourish or
[1:18:52] to C the second nature
[1:18:55] and the more you are feeding that nature
[1:18:57] it won't remain a baby amen that nature
[1:19:01] also will grow into a big God
[1:19:05] Amen are we together are we together
[1:19:09] brother Bram says this amen he says what
[1:19:12] was
[1:19:13] it there was another William
[1:19:20] BR a living spot of what eternal life
[1:19:24] down there so you already have eternal
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:31] life I know usually we wait for the
[1:19:34] baptism of the Holy
[1:19:36] Spirit and then we say that is when we
[1:19:38] have eternal
[1:19:40] life the holy spirit is looking for an
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:48] identification you already have eternal
[1:19:51] life that's why eternal life is coming
[1:19:54] to you
[1:19:59] you must have a part of God for God to
[1:20:03] come towards you eternal life was
[1:20:06] already in you and the Holy Spirit uses
[1:20:10] that as a guide it is used to guide the
[1:20:14] missile of the Holy
[1:20:19] Spirit I don't know if you're getting me
[1:20:22] I told you keep your seat belt friend
[1:20:25] and know the way we preach is when you
[1:20:27] go into the Altar and you give your life
[1:20:30] and then you got the Holy Ghost that's
[1:20:32] when you got the the the the what
[1:20:34] eternal life uhuh that is a
[1:20:39] confirmation that eternal life was
[1:20:41] already there because if there is no
[1:20:43] eternal life God won't seal
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:48] you the Bible say this is the Seal of
[1:20:52] God he knows what belongs to him
[1:20:55] so God will only stamp
[1:20:58] God eternal life is compatible to
[1:21:01] eternal life because God cannot be join
[1:21:05] to your first nature your first nature
[1:21:08] you are a liar so God need an anchor and
[1:21:12] the anchor is eternal life that was
[1:21:15] already in you put there and God hooked
[1:21:18] to God the bond of perfection
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:31] are we together are we together are we
[1:21:34] together before this building is wired
[1:21:37] to Duke power my friend Duke power is
[1:21:40] the company in United States that is
[1:21:42] responsible for power in this area amen
[1:21:46] before this building is connected to do
[1:21:49] power the electrician must do work here
[1:21:52] yes that's exactly
[1:21:55] amen so the wire and everything is
[1:21:57] already in place all they need to do is
[1:22:00] hook DU Power and everything begin to go
[1:22:03] all that the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:22:06] is is hook to the work that the
[1:22:09] electrician God has already performed in
[1:22:12] your life before the foundation of the
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:17] world this is the mystery of the new
[1:22:22] birth you all always was a child of God
[1:22:26] you always was a Son of God that's why
[1:22:30] you were asking all those questions it
[1:22:32] was God thinking in
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:40] you are we together are we
[1:22:48] together if you continue like this I
[1:22:50] don't even know if I will preach what I
[1:22:51] need to preach I have a question
[1:22:55] to enter in
[1:22:56] heaven you need eternal
[1:22:59] life the feif F the
[1:23:02] cross was he
[1:23:04] baptized did he go to the altar he died
[1:23:08] at the cross as a murderer asking Jesus
[1:23:11] Christ forgiveness so which eternal life
[1:23:14] did he use to enter
[1:23:19] Heaven which eternal life was he using
[1:23:22] they got to be eternal life
[1:23:25] because it's that life that look at
[1:23:27] Jesus Christ and look at him as innocent
[1:23:30] when the the cross was condemning Jesus
[1:23:34] Christ the other said no no no no do not
[1:23:36] condemn him what was giving him such a
[1:23:39] reasoning do you think he was a thief he
[1:23:43] was not a thief he was another one that
[1:23:46] came up at that time and find eternal
[1:23:49] life because eternal life always
[1:23:52] recognize eternal life if you have the
[1:23:56] head I told the young sister if you got
[1:24:00] the head in you you will recognize a
[1:24:03] husband with a head because the two head
[1:24:06] will
[1:24:07] communicate they will
[1:24:09] synchronize a Christian recognizes a
[1:24:13] Christian and a Christian won't
[1:24:15] persecute a Christian
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:25] a Christian would not persecute a
[1:24:31] Christian you persecuting somebody watch
[1:24:33] what do you
[1:24:36] have amen are we together oh god brother
[1:24:41] Bram say there was a little spot of
[1:24:43] eternal life where down there what is it
[1:24:47] the genes of God the Gen of your mother
[1:24:50] the gene of your father the gene of what
[1:24:53] God my question when did he enter

[1:25:04] conceived she only begin to see son and
[1:25:08] the doctor say it's a thre Monon
[1:25:10] pregnancy but the exact time even the
[1:25:13] devil doesn't knise this is a mystery in
[1:25:16] the natural now what about in a
[1:25:18] spiritual when did God come in other
[1:25:21] word when you were born God came even
[1:25:25] though you didn't see him God
[1:25:29] came you don't understand what I'm
[1:25:31] saying if you a child of God it tells
[1:25:34] you from birth God was already there in
[1:25:37] other words from birth God was having
[1:25:40] your
[1:25:40] identification when you are born he open
[1:25:43] and put it there even though you think
[1:25:45] he was not there he was there how do you
[1:25:48] know he was there because he put a
[1:25:52] part because I have
[1:25:57] gin amen do you know how many children
[1:26:00] die in the hospital why didn't didn't
[1:26:02] you
[1:26:07] die amen he got in a pool of Bea did he
[1:26:11] heal everyone he only healed the one
[1:26:13] that the father shows him so when he
[1:26:16] goes to the hospital he knows your
[1:26:18] address when Mom is crying under pen God
[1:26:21] is just
[1:26:22] waiting as as you jum you
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:29] go devil try one time you will know who
[1:26:32] is
[1:26:33] [Applause]
[1:26:35] there at the beginning they will Express

[1:26:39] anchor they will Express their M but
[1:26:42] wait for a time let that eternal life
[1:26:46] Quicken and what happen when he Quicken
[1:26:49] brother Bram say from the gene of who
[1:26:51] God the word of God that was placed
[1:26:55] where in there so what did you have in
[1:26:57] you the word of
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:01] God my question when did you hear that
[1:27:04] word when did you hear that
[1:27:07] word how do you know you have it that's
[1:27:10] a reason why when they preach the word
[1:27:13] you will hear something in you say that
[1:27:15] is right it looks
[1:27:18] right how do you know it's right
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:27] I don't even know if I will preach
[1:27:28] brother Angelo hold your
[1:27:31] Bible hold your Bible I'm in Psalm
[1:27:36] 82 okay this is where I am I'm in verse
[1:27:41] one I say God
[1:27:44] stands how do you know I'm telling the
[1:27:47] truth can you read it how do you know
[1:27:51] read over there
[1:27:56] amen verse one so made2 I say God stand
[1:28:02] in the congregation am I saying what is
[1:28:05] right how do you
[1:28:07] know so the book I have is what you
[1:28:12] have so so the reason why you saying
[1:28:15] amen is because we have the same
[1:28:20] record I don't know if you get what I'm
[1:28:22] saying I don't know if you get what what
[1:28:24] I'm saying because you got the word and
[1:28:27] the word is coming the word will
[1:28:30] recognize the word what says am man is
[1:28:32] not true it is when you look in the book
[1:28:35] you say what you're saying is correct
[1:28:37] because it's matching my
[1:28:40] word
[1:28:43] amen if you never understood this this
[1:28:47] is your answer that is the reason why
[1:28:50] the elect will be never deceived
[1:28:54] because the elect got the
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:29:06] book there are people who don't know how
[1:29:09] to
[1:29:10] read they are illiterate they are blind
[1:29:14] but when they preach the word they say
[1:29:17] that is
[1:29:18] correct so this book is beyond this
[1:29:26] yes even if you don't have a PhD the
[1:29:29] book is over there it is more than a
[1:29:33] natural book if that book say no you
[1:29:37] will realize later on that that book is
[1:29:39] always
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:45] right are we
[1:29:48] together he says it was the word of God
[1:29:51] that was placed where there each one of
[1:29:54] you can think of what similar thing see
[1:29:57] he was doing what
[1:30:01] working then look up to the tree and I
[1:30:05] think Lea I see you fall off last year
[1:30:08] and why are you coming back there again
[1:30:10] where did you come from what brought you
[1:30:13] here see it was what that eternal life
[1:30:16] working in the body so all the funny
[1:30:19] question that you ask yourself it is
[1:30:22] only a son that there is another you
[1:30:26] that is there but the first you that you
[1:30:28] started with is a natural one you gave
[1:30:32] more time to that you the time has come
[1:30:35] for you to tune in to the new you
[1:30:38] because the new you have
[1:30:41] power he have
[1:30:43] authority he have
[1:30:46] jurisdiction to control even def face
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:52] you yeah God
[1:30:55] and all of you are children of the most
[1:30:57] high
[1:30:59] God that's why brother BR say now I
[1:31:01] realize I'm no longer a child of Ella
[1:31:05] and Charles brandham that's right not
[1:31:08] that he rejected his parent but he
[1:31:11] understand that there is more than a
[1:31:12] natural parent that's why the Bible say
[1:31:15] children are the inheritance of
[1:31:19] who of God watch your
[1:31:22] Bible you we were just
[1:31:27] lone it's written in the Bible it's
[1:31:31] written in the Bible children are the
[1:31:33] inheritance of God God just take them
[1:31:36] and loan to you but they are God's
[1:31:39] children God is claiming that all of
[1:31:42] them are my children all of them are
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:48] gods are we together that's why your
[1:31:51] parent might not believe what you
[1:31:53] believe in
[1:31:54] because you are Alan to your parent but
[1:31:57] you have the original
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:02] father are we together the Bible call
[1:32:05] him the father of light that's right so
[1:32:08] he give birth to what because he himself
[1:32:11] is
[1:32:12] what any question let's go to Luke
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:21] 15 yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:32:28] if you don't clear this thing you will
[1:32:30] confuse the people that's you need to
[1:32:32] have eternal life you need to have this
[1:32:34] you have to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:35] Ghost
[1:32:37] and what are you talking about so there
[1:32:40] is eternal life there is a baptism of
[1:32:42] the Holy
[1:32:44] Ghost if I have two word I mix them
[1:32:47] together what happened to the

[1:40:37] masterly built that when the temple went
[1:40:41] together he had all kind of little what

[1:42:36] Stone it looks funny this one look funny
[1:42:39] but all of them are coming for one
[1:42:41] Temple and the Bible says when they
[1:42:44] begin to deposit the stone the stone
[1:42:47] will fit perfectly
[1:42:53] they don't need a hammer and a cheel to
[1:42:57] reorganize a stone and put it again

[1:56:58] mean fall in this category but the one
[1:57:00] we pulling here today is an ox are we
[1:57:05] together are we together this Ox here do
[1:57:09] you follow me when it's a
[1:57:12] male amen it is called a
[1:57:17] boo from today you will read your Bible
[1:57:20] and Leviticus differently
[1:57:22] amen or in the Bible they call him a
[1:57:28] bullock now your Bible will change from
[1:57:31] today are we together are we together
[1:57:35] and when it's a
[1:57:38] female amen it is called a
[1:57:42] cow are we together but when it is
[1:57:47] Young when it's young it is called a cal
[1:57:53] exactly right amen amen if somebody want
[1:57:58] to use the word Bullock for a young one
[1:58:02] they say young
[1:58:06] Bullock in other word young Bullock
[1:58:08] means a
[1:58:10] calf if I lost you raise your
[1:58:13] hand you didn't raise your hand but I'm
[1:58:16] going to repeat it for somebody who
[1:58:19] shy are we together there is a race of
[1:58:23] cattle or Bine that have many animals
[1:58:26] the animal we're dealing with today is a
[1:58:29] nox Ox is the name but Ox can be male or
[1:58:34] female when it's male it's called a
[1:58:38] boo amen or a Bullock in the Bible when

[1:59:06] together when this one give a young the
[1:59:09] young is called a calf some people don't
[1:59:13] use the word calf they want to use the
[1:59:15] word bulock so you need to say a young
[1:59:19] bulock to express that this is really a
[1:59:22] younger one because these are usually
[1:59:25] named for mature one are we together I
[1:59:29] won't go into a Ste because it's not
[1:59:31] important where are you getting the
[1:59:33] stuff from Hello William Mar BR in the
[1:59:38] message Revelation chapter 4 paragraph
[1:59:42] 319 when brother Bram is reading about
[1:59:45] the anointing he said the first Beast
[1:59:47] was like a what Lion of Judah the second
[1:59:51] beast was like a what a cal that is what
[1:59:53] is written in your Bible if you go to
[1:59:55] Revelation it's written a calf you can
[1:59:57] verify it later Amen brother brother say
[2:00:00] that is a young o we clear it let me
[2:00:06] stabilize somebody again in Job chapter
[2:00:09] 21 I'm using my uh
[2:00:12] Google I'm using my spiritual Google you
[2:00:16] can go on Google on your phone me I'm
[2:00:18] using my spiritual Google amen the Bible

[2:00:26] what gender because it's a
[2:00:29] male are we together and fell not and
[2:00:32] their cow do what Cal this Cal means to
[2:00:36] deliver because it's the cow who is the
[2:00:39] female and cow cth and casteth not her
[2:00:42] what so you can see a boo a male and a
[2:00:46] cow mama and then Cal which is a baby
[2:00:49] any question
[2:00:53] brother stepen this one is
[2:00:56] clear what does kids

[2:13:57] getting me I don't know if you're
[2:13:59] getting
[2:14:00] me do you understand what I'm saying it
[2:14:03] is a sin of ignorance to any commandment
[2:14:08] because commandment are many but you
[2:14:11] must sin through a commandment not
[2:14:13] knowing that you did it oh God help
[2:14:17] me in other word you are doing something
[2:14:21] in your life but you are not aware yet
[2:14:25] that it's against the word or it's
[2:14:28] against the message until a preacher

[2:15:16] ignorantly because they don't know when
[2:15:19] they do something we say no you don't
[2:15:21] talk to people like this then now they
[2:15:23] learn then they would do something again
[2:15:25] you say no no no you don't wear your
[2:15:26] underwear like this they are doing that
[2:15:29] ignorantly and then as knowledge come
[2:15:32] they begin to reshape but many of the
[2:15:34] stuff they did they did ignorantly what
[2:15:37] happened with ignorant sin he says if
[2:15:40] they did it ignorantly amen against any
[2:15:43] of the Commandment of the Lord
[2:15:44] concerning things which ought not to be
[2:15:47] done so the Commandment already exist

[2:25:50] time Remain the calf the only time
[2:25:54] Israel will benefit for a

[2:43:49] that's it they are ignorant the hidden
[2:43:53] the Gentile are ignorant and God
[2:43:57] suffer to let the Gentile go and brother

[2:44:11] doctors I have the quot my friend
[2:44:14] brother I'm saying no one can heal it's
[2:44:17] only God but the hidden thought when
[2:44:21] they go to the magician they approaching
[2:44:24] God and brother say because of that God
[2:44:27] honored their faith in the wrong place
[2:44:31] by giving them

[2:44:38] is not to sound you in the right
[2:44:40] [Applause]
[2:44:44] place are we together are we together

[2:44:54] there are we together are we together
[2:44:58] God suffered the hidden to do that
[2:45:00] because they didn't know the witch
[2:45:02] doctor say you got healed and he believe
[2:45:04] it and he goes he was using faith and
[2:45:07] God look he say they don't know just

[2:45:11] oh that which doctor knows really had to
[2:45:13] heal people he was not the Wich doctor
[2:45:16] because the Bible say I am the Lord that

[2:46:22] you amen we will get to that maybe
[2:46:25] another day he said and God we get the
[2:46:28] what ignorance but
[2:46:32] now God commanded all man everywhere to
[2:46:36] do what repent so the time of ignorance

[2:46:41] gone because he has appointed what a day
[2:46:46] in which he God will judge the world
[2:46:49] into what righteousness by who that man

[2:47:44] down and struck the rock that was in his
[2:47:47] hand and threw it down and broke the
[2:47:50] Commandment on because of the weakness
[2:47:52] he had which was what temper Israel made
[2:47:56] a
[2:47:58] c Israel made the cal made the Cal Moses
[2:48:03] came and
[2:48:04] destroyed because of his temper let me
[2:48:07] keep that one my friend amen and he
[2:48:09] broke the commandment and went back

[2:48:13] priesthood which is what levitical
[2:48:16] priesthood will be what broken
[2:48:20] put your seat belt we going to land this
[2:48:23] plan okay now that priesthood was what
[2:48:27] done away with which priesthood Aaron's
[2:48:30] priesthood which priesthood levitical
[2:48:32] priesthood but now God has what a new
[2:48:35] priesthood and he has a new
[2:48:38] what this is it what is it the Bible
[2:48:41] there is in here it must come from what
[2:48:45] the Bible our teaching in spoken word
[2:48:49] and everything must be the action of who
[2:48:52] the Holy Spirit according to what the
[2:48:56] Bible are we together are we together

[2:49:11] the what the priesthood who is what
[2:49:15] Christ for Christ according to Roman 10
[2:49:18] is what
[2:49:19] the end of the law for righteousness to
[2:49:21] everyone that does what believe
[2:49:25] [Applause]

[2:50:28] Catholic wearing things in color they're
[2:50:31] trying to revive the levitical
[2:50:34] priesthood when Christ already kills

[2:57:20] least they can have a
[2:57:22] point a certain
[2:57:25] reference to where they can see
[2:57:28] clearly that the Old Testament was only
[2:57:31] a shadow of God who was trying to do to
[2:57:35] his true
[2:57:37] priesthood his true
[2:57:41] brde Lord many things we have done we

[2:58:31] sins father may you help us grasp this
[2:58:35] and understand the power of
[2:58:38] Calvary which ended the levitical
[2:58:41] priesthood the power that provided a
[2:58:44] perfect sacrifice not the type but the
[2:58:48] antip
[2:58:50] itself that saves to the
