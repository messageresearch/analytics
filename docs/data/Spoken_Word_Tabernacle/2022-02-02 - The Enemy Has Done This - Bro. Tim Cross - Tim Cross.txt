thank god for the opportunity to be here again amen pray for us because [Music] this song really came on my heart this morning oh yesterday morning as i was meditating on what we received on sunday the lord is showing us that he wants us to come back to eden and you know my understanding of going back to eden changed on sunday going back to eden is going into the inner veil going back to eden is getting into the bedroom and closing the door and he's he's calling for that now stephen had preached on the songs of solomon one time where the bridegroom had come to the door and was calling for her and she was laying down she didn't want to get up and he withdrew himself the prophet told us the angels that had blocked man from getting back in there are the ones that's begging him to come in now and it's it used to be death to go in now it's dead to stay out so may god help us to take this call seriously amen get into the bedroom with christ this song is is from the message the prophet was speaking about he was tired of going around and around he wanted to go to a deeper consecration help us lord amen [Music] lord jesus help me [Music] there's a deep and inward hunger within my soul god has promised in his word he will make us whole well it's time for it to happen that huge portion of heaven it will make and bring to pass that tremendous victory in the love divine for i'm tired [Music] of tramping around this mountain i'm heading down i'm heading down to the jordan oh low before me i see a vision breaking oh yes a power that would bide that mamba the third full ministry [Music] now's my time for consecration i must see a change in me i will enter my secret closet and close the door behind me i'll keep the feast of unleavened bread with truth and sincere for i'm expecting jehovah jireh my lord to meet with me for i'm tired of tramping on this mountain i'm heading down oh lord i'm heading down to the jordan oh lord before me i see a vision breaking oh yes a power that would bide that mamba the third full ministry [Music] lord keep thy holy fire burning o lord deep within my soul change me from glory unto glory your image you behold let's keep the feast of unleavened [Music] and bread for it's this message in you and me bring past the tremendous victory for i'm tired of tramping on this mountain oh lord i'm heading down i'm heading down to the jordan oh before me low before me i see a vision breaking it's breaking lord a power that would bind that mamba [Music] oh i'm tired i'm tired lord i'm tired i'm tired of tramping on this mountain oh i'm heading down oh lord i'm heading down [Music] lord before me low before me i see a vision breaking [Music] it's a power power lord the power that word bind that mamba the third perminus oh it's a power it's your power lord the power that words [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen amen amen amen [Applause] amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight i think my husband's going to come play for me so [Music] [Music] his heart was broken mine was minted he became sin now i am free the cross he carried bore my burdens the nails that held him set me free his life for mine his life for my [Music] could it ever be that he would die god's son would die to save a wretch like me what love divine he gave his life [Music] his scars of suffering brought me healing he spilled his blood to fill my soul his crown of thorns it made me royalty and his sorrow gave me joy and told his [Music] how could it ever [Music] god's son would die just to save a wretch like me what love divine he gave his life for mine he was despised and rejected stripped of his garments and oppressed but now i'm loved and accepted and i wear a crowd of righteousness his life for mine his life for mine oh tell me how good it ever be that he would die god's son would die to save wretch like me oh what love divine he gave [Music] what his divine he gave his life [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen word love divine he gave his life for mine amen amen we bless the name of the lord amen amen so um we want to invite stephen amen to the prophet amen we'd only believe amen oh [Music] [Music] believe [Music] only believe all things are [Music] do you believe it what a wonderful singing let's give the lord the clap offering do you know where you're going to find brother branham in heaven you don't know you do your homework and tell me i know the answer amen when you sing when you hear those beautiful strong angelic voices going on if you are looking for brother brandon just go straight right there you're gonna find him there laying there amen wonderful singing there is a power in singing how many are up to date with the sermon amen blessed be the name of the lord brother greg got a beautiful chart for the tabernacle and he asked me if we can print it out and give it to the people so if you go out or you're coming on sunday morning there is pepper there for the tabernacle so you can take it keep it put it in your bible so on sunday you know exactly what we're talking about amen so it shows you it's a brief brief brief chart that shows you the entrance of the tabernacle the brazen altar the lever and after the level the first uh the holy place then the holy of the oldest and then we move on from there you might be seated a little bit because i'm going to call the minister sooner amen so make sure you get it it for free just get it there and then go home look over it it will help you and make your life easy amen how many really caught the message you really caught it amen if you don't catch it it's a problem because all we're trying to do is show you where you are anybody care in other words ah please be the name of the lord this church have an anointing amen if i call this apple everybody here one two three i can preach to you apple all the time and you will never understand what an apple is amen amen what are we doing with the tabernacle i'm just trying to help somebody who have not caught yet what we're doing with the tabernacle at the beginning we described to you everything then i stop and i say what does this mean to us you remember on sunday amen in other words what is this information to us then we begin to give description of the part of the tabernacle the reason why we're giving you description or symptoms you have a runny nose you'll not smell you have headache you have a fever what does it mean any question that's what we did we started on sunday so we described to you what are the symptoms of somebody who lives in the other court amen they come late to church they do this and this all of that we explain to you everything that was just the beginning amen because i'm going to dig into that tabernacle pretty deep when we go deeper we're going to come up with roof you remember we left the roof we're going to come up with roof when we come up with roof then we go to the chamber when we move up from the chamber then we go to ezekiel when we move from ezekiel then we go to first john and you come out from there when you come back from there you perch amen so when we are describing to you go listen to the sermon again when we describe to you the other court you need to check your life do you hear me amen and then you look at the description if you find those description in your life the crude pure direct message is you don't have the holy ghost it's hard but i won't have your blood in my hand amen if you look at the description i gave on sunday that's just the beginning of the description and i'm gonna get even into the marriage you heard me touching marriage on sunday amen there is a reason why because when you start marriage whatever you set up at the beginning will cause you problem down the road you can build your husband right at the beginning or you can manage your husband down the road with a lot of oil change and check engine do you hear me you mean me make the husband from the beginning make him understand that you're a christian do you hear me right at the beginning of the marriage tell him we need to go to church amen tell him what you're doing is wrong it's contrary to the word don't condone with him trying to show him love you are building another character and after a while that character will be like a shelter of a turtle don't worry so what i'm saying let me lock that up we'll see down the road what i'm trying to say look at every description on sunday i don't care if you 20 years in the message i don't care with you 30 years in the message i don't care if you were born in the message remember the rich young hero right if you have those symptoms covered you don't have the holy ghost you're just in a justified state and i will dig into the justification in three steps and then you will see what is justification this is the problem we have a big confusion in a message where people don't know where they are so when i'm giving you that information it is for you to check your life if i say one thing it's checking the second is checking what god is telling you is this is where you are you don't stay there you need to move forward quickly because death is coming do you hear me the only place that you can get and know that i really made it is the holy of holies and you gotta know that you are there there is a description your life the life you've been living for 10 years has been giving you signal you didn't understand them you were casting out devil in jesus name in jesus name in jesus name no you cast the devil and he comes back again you cast the devil and he comes back again because you don't understand where you are amen you can never have the holy ghost and have a stubborn spirit rebellious to your parent you don't have the holy ghost you're fooling yourself it's clear amen oh my god i'm not preaching i'm going to let the preacher do do the preaching amen so what i'm just i'm just reminding you if you miss the simplicity of the gospel the three steps of the tabernacle are reflecting the three steps of grace go back and look at the quote i gave you on sunday amen so the other court brother branham say was a justification the holy place was sanctification and the holy of holies is the baptism of the holy spirit amen but we have to break it down so you see exactly am i justify or am i sanctified or do i really have the holy ghost if you justify it's telling you you have been stuck somewhere for years you need to move up amen if you sanctify there is a way a sanctified life is you're watching pornography you say you have sanctification you're wasting your time you're fooling yourself you don't have it amen so we stop on sunday when you confess brother branham said that old nature is still there but you have a clean conscience toward god and that clean conscience has been fooling you for years and you thought you have the holy ghost that's why your life is up and down tomorrow fire to go to then today the fire is going up and then tomorrow fire then after that the fire is going down tomorrow and you wonder why can i why i can't keep this fire all the time there is a reason why you can't keep the fire all the time because it depends on where you are in the tabernacle as long as you dare the cosmos will work on you the zodiac will continue to affect you until you pass the face of the remember that first veil doesn't have caribbean the gate doesn't have caribbean so you can move on quickly amen that's where the family of cornelius moved quickly and stuck somewhere you will see down the road because there was no caribbean so when peter was speaking to them it was very easy for them to enter the holy of holies and the holy ghost to baptize them because the water baptism is essential now they're pulling them up like hey you still need the water but the holy ghost is already there go back again and listen it is not information for the head don't look at somebody else look at your own life examine yourself whether you are in the faith if the description that we gave you you find yourself inside that description it is time to get serious with god to start praying god so that god can deliver you and move you from that justified state all the way to the sun to the sanctification all the way to the holy of holies if not the showdown is coming and it's going to blow you up completely this is why you see people 20 years in the message and the backslid and when the backsleep they go back into the world and they start doing things like i thought this young man was born in a message yeah they didn't understand they never got the holy ghost and when the challenge come the backslid completely and they ran away from the church because there was no holy ghost they grew up like the rich young ruler the message was a legalistic thing amen there was no life that's the reason why you see all these up and down up and down up and down so remember when you're listening to the sermon forget about your neighbor forget about what is going on it is so simple don't overthink don't try to bring complicated revelation we already break it down for you the problem with human being you break it down and they take and then try to mix it up again remember all description is not to kill you because it's going to rock your boat very hard i'm going to rock it again very hard until you feel like you were never a christian before it is just to shake you up and make sure all the loose feathers are gone amen all the desires are gone amen so you must enter into a place where no matter rain it's not raining whatever is happening in your life you in a cruise control your speed is still valid there's nothing that's going to change you then you know you're a candidate for the rapture amen amen remember we're not trying to kill you i know when we touch those area are you like ouch it's me yes i'm just telling you this is where you have been you don't have the holy ghost you need to move up but the one who puts you there is the holy ghost but he have not entered into you yet because he must clean the vessel you don't understand you're struggling with clothing you're struggling with high heels you're struggling with makeup you're struggling with now those na all that you're doing it's just telling you you outside you outside you outside you don't understand and when sickness comes in jesus name in jesus name you need to tell the holy ghost to get that stuff out or you gotta pastor your spirit and he was not the holy ghost sorry so if i rock your boat early i am not doing it wait for sunday don't run away stay in church there is two ways to run away do you know that you can run away clearly or you can run away with a legitimate reason sorry my brother i'm gonna let you preach i can prove to you in the scripture when the invitation was given for the people to come to the to the wedding go look at the reason the people give legitimate reason my father died i need to go bury him who would not let that person go bury his father we always say oh praise the lord we'll pray for you just go ahead and do it jesus turn around and say let's if i tell you this you call me a cruel pastor right it is running from the calling of god with a legitimate reason that with reasoning it sounds very good and with compassion it's very good and the people will sympathize with you but down deep in your heart you know the true reason you're running away it is a spirit pulling you away from your deliverance with a legitimate reason stay put amen you remember my mother in prayer we have like three death in a family my sister lost her son in europe they just buried him back in the country then my cousin lost her husband right in the middle of that and then yesterday my mom lost his younger brother that's why my wife is not here she's streaming lord's willing and then she's just staying with my mom kind of grieving so keep her in prayer so i know i exhort her a little bit that we have a blessed hope and everything will be okay the coming of the lord will solve a lot of stuff amen and also remember brother michael daley he lost his brother-in-law in london so lord willing maybe next week or something he probably might travel if everything works fine uh with the lord so make sure you keep him in prayer he tried to make his way here but he's still probably down in louisiana maybe he's streaming so you know brother mike if he gotta be in church he's gonna do everything he can to be in church that's your loyal brother amen so let's remember the family especially her sister going back to see her husband and the husband passed away so remember the family a lot of people passing away but thank god we pray for the blood on the church when we start new years amen so we have brother tim cross tonight but tim cross is not new this is like part of a family so brother tim you know what to do the first time in uh in the building here from the hotel so the lord opened up the way the lord spared him from a deadly accident so the man you see here is a miracle if you talk to him he will tell you exactly they find him unconscious if i'm not mistaken and pull him so he's right here like nothing happened amen so that's a miracle amen so you know what to do pull on the gift of the lord and know his ministry he have a very wonderful genuine gift from god and i trust the lord that tonight is going to be a great blessing amen thank you and i know some a lot people are online streaming so let's stay put and the holy spirit will speak to us tonight let's sing only believe as brother tim comes only believe me believe all things are possible [Music] oh [Music] lord i believe oh lord [Music] i know is [Music] things are possible [Music] amen you love the lord this evening amen it's sir good to be back with you in worship tonight and uh thank the lord for blessing you with a beautiful building and a beautiful church to fill that building amen we appreciate brother stephen extending an invitation to us uh after a number of attempts and things not working out the lord finally made it possible and uh we do thank the lord back on christmas day i had taken my dad's motorcycle that i had been putting in the garage there and taking care of it a little bit out for just a short ride i was going about 35 miles an hour lost control and when i woke up i was on my way to charlotte in an ambulance and they had stopped the ambulance and they said mr cross you're on your way to the charlotte hospital they said we're stopped we're waiting for another crew to join us we want to give you our full attention and i thought well i like it when people give me their full attention usually this is a very different scenario and so i had some head trauma they were worried but all is well i went home that night and went back in for a few days later for an mri and all the tests just confirmed what the scriptures already say i am the lord thy god amen it was all thy diseases amen so we've got a clean bill of health tonight and we thank the lord for that i'm going to invite you to turn your bibles to matthew chapter 13. and appreciate my wife coming with me tonight and singing and uh we would have brought the little our little baby girl there the lord is opening doors on that as well and we thank the lord for that but tonight she's with my brother and his family and um we're just claiming the victory and thanking god amen that we get a we get to read the end of the book and know that we win and so uh we're resting amen in that faith so tonight in matthew chapter 13 i'm going to actually pick up brother stephen i believe on something i had started into last time and just as is normally the case when there's a really good pull we didn't get to quite to the end so we're just going to move in the direction i believe the lord is leading and we trust he'll you know we can read these words um but it takes the holy spirit to bring the true you know the miracle at pentecost was that god was speaking and god was hearing amen because he was speaking through the lips of mortals and then others were hearing what god was saying and so it was god giving the speaking and god giving the hearing when that takes place it doesn't matter your background your tribe your nation your language your tongue what happened through the day none of that matters because the holy spirit is giving divine action and you're hearing the spirit speak through the vessel and you're not even hearing the man or seeing the man you're hearing and seeing god amen you know brother branham said we see god in his creation we see god in his word we see god in christ and we see god in one another that's the hardest thing to do is to see god in one another and to see god in you but with time we realize god has a body and he has a ministry and god is speaking and god is hearing amen so tonight in matthew 13 verse 24 uh actually i want to uh let me get my notes here i'm i'm a real scrambled up preacher after 20-something years you'd think i'd know how to preach but i don't if he doesn't preach they know preaching going to get done amen i'll just go off the memory here matthew 13. i know you said under a great ministry of teaching and preaching a dynamic teaching i might add teaching that won't put you to sleep but it'll keep you awake because it's the awakening of the bride just before we read let's go to him in prayer heavenly father we're looking to you now to break the bread of life to give thee speaking and to give us hearing bless the remaining portion of this service lord and may you be glorified all that is said and done that's our desire tonight in jesus christ's name we ask amen matthew 13 verse 1 the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes now notice this is multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore all right let's go down to verse 10. and the disciples now these weren't multitude these were chosen men followers partakers and the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given i just can't help myself i heard a man say one time there's no power in the mystery i thought well you sure would have had a hard time convincing mary of that because in her womb was a mystery that had the power to reclaim the world that he had created [Music] unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them is not given let's move to verse 24 another parable putting forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares this is where i get my subject for tonight and he said unto them an enemy hath done this an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the five-fold ministry i will say to the reapers plural gather ye together now the first ministry this commission is given to is a denominational ministry christ has a fifo ministry and satan has a counterfeit but they're all serving a role that accomplishes the end desire of the owner of the field just when the devil thinks he's pulling a trick all he's doing is opening the way for god's glory to be manifested in a greater way i will say to the reapers i will say to billy graham i will say to oral roberts i will say to the charismatics i will say to the catholics i'll say to the all of these coalition of religions gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles have we ever lived in a time of bundling spectrum wants you to bundle verizon wants you to bundle everybody's wanting to bundle their package where do they get this inspiration gather you together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn amen may the lord add his blessings to the ring you may be seated the reading of his word amen an enemy have done this so i think last time i had dealt with just the uh the battle that began in heaven came to the earth in eden and resumed uh the warfare the the battle that's that lucifer lost in heaven came to the earth where for six thousand years he continues to lose but in the little victory he gained in eden he did obtain a 6 000 year lease on the earth because the title deed went back to the hands of the original owner so the devil has 6 000 years to take up god's dare that in that six thousand year period of time he must achieve global domination and garner the worship and the adoration of all of humanity they must worship him as god with no exception no man woman boy or child is exempted from this they all must bow and give him worship if they do not the lease is revoked the original owner takes the title deed back exterminates what was never his family and those who never accepted his offer of grace and redemption amen if you go to hell it's because you fought your way to get there you stepped right over the grace of jesus christ the bloody shed at calvary the sanctifying and holy spirit power of the holy ghost you're going to fight your way to heaven or you're going to fight your way to hell either way you're going to one place or the other and if you get to heaven it'll be by his grace and if you go to hell it'll be you fought over his grace to get there amen amen the devil doesn't have ownership he's got a lease but at the end of the period amen god's going to call the lien back he's going to call back and say you never achieved you know who's standing in the way a little remnant a little handful of people because he's been exposed in this hour satan has been exposed amen a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and it does little stone smothy image in the feet oh my and in the place of that image comes up a great mountain a pyramid amen the city the habitation of the lord our god we are his temple we are his habitation and we come back we're brought back amen and the kingdom is restored and satan and his subjects are perished in the lake of fire that was created for them amen because there's no redemption for angels redemption is only for human beings and those those angels influence will be perished and be lost but those who were influenced by the mighty angel and his seven messengers that were sent to seven gentile church ages the message has been the same in every age come out of her my people in paul's day it was come out of the orthodox church come out of the just a judaic religion amen amen and in all ages it was come out of a church carnal or a church corporate and come into the church spiritual oh my the royal seed of abraham amen join the real original family amen and in the seventh age once again he comes and cries come out of her my people come out of the pentecostal denomination come out of catholicism come out of every man-made religion and walk in the full brilliance of the light of the revealed word of the hour come in to christ an exodus consists of a coming out of and going into and many will perish in the middle oh my but out of the thousands that came out under the seventh angel's message there's a small remnant that's not satisfied to circle the mountain but they're going into christ amen they're they're fighting their way into christ they're not satisfied in the wilderness amen they're not satisfied with a temporary temple oh my it represents a permanent dwelling place christ embodying himself in a believer and as they receive the revealed word of the hour they become his habitation oh my so friends of battle still going on tonight and we're right in the middle of it we're right in the warfare praise the lord and i got a problem with this ipad it likes to go to sleep after so many minutes it's like some layer of scenes if you don't keep exciting yet it falls asleep i'm glad we don't have any of those here tonight all the laodiceans found somewhere else to go to church or or they're already asleep but let's get into the lesson for just a moment here a man owns a field he's got a desire for that field amen he's got a handful of little wheat and he wants to multiply it into a field full of the same species amen so he goes and his uh his his servants sow this wheat seed if you will into the field and while they are resting while they are sleeping amen the enemy comes in and sows a strange seed a seed of discrepancy a seed that's 99.9 percent truth but it's got just enough error to deceive everybody except the elect so at night time he sows this seed and then days later or whenever the tears come the blades spring up and these laborers realize there's two seeds in the one field and something must be done so they're inexperienced they're not masters of the harvest they're not the lord they're not the owner they're just laborers even like ministers we don't own you we're your servants amen hired by christ amen we give an account to him for your souls amen so we don't own you amen we're just we're just working for him to help you amen so they come back with this idea hey we'll just destroy the work of the enemy right now we'll eradicate all the serpent seed all the false seed all the foolish virgins whatever we just get it all out of the field and he goes no i'm not willing to risk harm or injury to even one of the least [Music] of those wheat seeds that i planted there so to avoid injury to even one of them we're going to water them both we're going to fertilize them both we're going to pour out nutrients on both of them we're going to care for both of them we're going to nurture both of them until until full maturity and full fruition and that comes at the end of the seventh church age when the seeds that were sown amen by the reformers or the seeds that were sown by denominational sowers amen uh pardon me for saying billy graham and noah roberts but they sowed seeds and my what a crop they've had they've had a crop of fundamentalists they've had a crop of charismatics they've had a crop of independent movements amen that are anti-establishment and anti-denominational and anti-god they scream they shout they have emotions they have a disco ball they have music they have entertainment they tell people come as you were and leave as you are and you're okay and you're going to hell the gospel tells you you're a sinner on your way to satan's hell because you were born in sin shaping an iniquity and you need a savior you need to be justified sanctified and filled with the spirit of god god's not waiting for your approval you waiting on god's approval the baptism of the holy ghost is not something that you can manufacture it's not something that you can work up it's not something that stimulates your emotions although it will do that amen you don't produce it you stand there and waiting in faith knowing you have put everything under the blood you are justified sanctified and the word is washing you [Music] until he says they're ready put the stamp on them feel them with the spirit of god set them on fire give them a commission give them a placing give them power give them authority i'm going to tag on what you said brother some of these people trying to cast out every devil in the name of jesus christ i adjure thee in the name of jesus christ come out of them satan come out up say not kick you out i'll kick you out i cast you up who are you trying to fool you can't convince yourself much less the devil hello church jesus never had to cast out a demon in the name of jesus christ he knew who he was he said come out of him satan when the life of jesus christ is living itself through you you don't need a patch that says message believer you don't need a boy scout badge that says pastor stephen is my pastor you don't need a uh embroidery you don't need a lapel pin that says vog or jeffersonville or cloverdale or tennessee or gastonia that's what man gives you to give you a brand and a label to associate you with a man's kingdom when god gives you his step of approval [Applause] the devil will recognize you from 10 miles away he'll tell those devils there's a manifested son don't ever go with him alone take back up take reinforcements open up the artillery because that's the son and daughter of god right there that's jesus christ living in a body of flesh in laodicea you got god's step of approval you don't have to wear hello hello an enemy has done this divided fellowship on churches pastors personalities ministries an enemy has done this it's satan trying to divide the body of jesus christ by creating a cap [Music] around the man around a building around a ministry that circles the globe which this influence hello an enemy hath done this i know the devil don't like it i wouldn't either if i was him but the bride loves it because an enemy is bundling his tares [Music] and they're saying come join up with us come be apart come subscribe come come like [Music] [Applause] i want to give the devil a thumbs down tonight i don't like you devil i don't have no time for your nonsense i don't subscribe to you the whole reason we got the problems we got in the world today is because eve subscribed [Music] she gave the devil five minutes of her time and he told her what he could do eve i can give you a revelation i can explain i'm just gonna preach i can explain the mystery to you eve in a way that adam cannot and she said if you can i will it's based on works if you can demonstrate it if you can manufacture it if you can build it if you can impress then i'll get on board god doesn't come to his bride and say if i can because that's a premise that's built on doubt if is a doubt if is a statement of doubt god don't say if i can will you [Music] i'm gonna ask you a question tonight are you serving god for what you think he might do for you [Music] are you serving god for the benefits that you think he's hanging out in front of you like you attract a mule with a carrot on a stick god don't work that way god offers you he says i already have it's done it's finished it's determined [Music] [Applause] will you will you will you be my wife will you be the extension of who i am will you accept my offer he's a gentleman he's not there to display something in hopes of winning you he knows if you are the true bride you'll be attracted by the character of who he is and the revelation of what he's already done and he says will you say i do i do believe lord you don't have to know how he's going to do it you don't have to know when he's going to do it you don't have to wonder if he's going to do it you know if he's asking it's because he already knows the answers to his own questions and if he's asking you it's because he wants you to say i do and i will lord i will follow you i will live for you i will sacrifice everything i'll rip off every other token every other engagement every other commitment every other opportunity i'll lay it all aside and he says that's what i thought you would say amen glory glory glory god knows the end from the beginning amen when god picks up clay he's done got a vessel [Applause] he did not pick you up to examine you and try to determine if you were suitable for the intent and the purpose that he had envisioned he picked you up because god has no wasted motion or efforts and because he picked you up it's because he has confidence in his own choice that can never fail he that began a good work in you will be faithful to perform it until the day of jesus christ full maturity full maturity christ being birthed and born and brought to maturity and adoption in a many-membered body [Music] i do lord i do believe i do believe he didn't say do you understand it he didn't say can you explain it he says if you do i will [Music] we have works based religions because an enemy [Music] have done this and then we have the predestination folks that like to lie over there and rest they don't have one speck of dirt on them no faults no failures no blemishes no shame they're predestinated it's like they talk about the difference in value between the male brain and the female brain the male brain costs a whole lot more not because it's altogether worth more just because the female brain is much more used so these predestinated christians are so perfect they know all the scriptures all the quotes oh my they're almost ashamed to get their hands dirty and show up on church workday they're predestinated they're going in the same rapture we are they're not having to do any works they've got faith they're like the pencil with an unused eraser there's no fault there's no blemish they look as good as the day they were born problem is they've never done anything but let me tell you something those people are going to be so disappointed hello church because the token given must result in a token applied [Music] i don't care if you had a bucket of blood and you had followed the message to the letter and followed the prophet's instructions you had slayed the lamb after putting him up for the appointed time you had followed everything to the letter but if the blood was not applied somebody died and we got pristine christians that are too perfect to appreciate grace because they've never witnessed they've never fallen they've never had they've never backslidden they've never made a mistake so they don't even know the grace of god because it's never been applied hello hello i want to be an applied christian i want to be the kind of christian that doesn't have to sit in a crystal case up on the top shelf for the world to admire as the bride of jesus christ i want to be a christian that has power amongst the coworkers and the classmates and the factory worker and the lost companion and the children that need a real god because they're facing a real devil and they're tired of fake tired of philosophy they're tired a man of recipes i'm gonna say it brother this is the recipe this is the cake you put this and apply the token and let the holy spirit mix up your life and you get the living bread the living manner the word made flesh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes sir brother jesus gave his disciples power over unclean spirits they healed the sick they cast out devils the dead were raised and legion was brought back from the tombs he commanded his disciples terry in jerusalem until you are endured a powerful night they come out of the upper room staggering under the dynamic power of jesus christ applied life and they did not go back to the temple and start a debate they didn't start a new youtube channel to defy and counter all the critics of the message they come out of the upper room and the world said what meant this and the word spoke and said these men are not drunk as you suppose see it is but the third hour of the day but this is that the living bread the living word the applied token this is that that the prophet joel spoke of i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh [Music] and the prophet of god said the devil never even moved out of his bed until they went walking down to the gate called beautiful [Music] oh my where a lame man had been crippled and he'd had handouts he did he'd been given tracts he'd been offered memberships he'd been offered incentives to come join or to lure him away from one church into another church or from one ministry into another ministry he had been offered all kinds of incentives and on this day his expectations have been reduced to believing that's all he would ever get was a little financial [Music] and if you'll accept that that's all you'll ever get if you'll settle for the devil's counterfeit that's all you'll ever get but on this day he met the word applied he said i don't need the wallet i don't need an income i don't need a sponsor i don't need an alliance i don't need a club i don't need a society i don't need a support group i don't need a i don't need a psychiatrist i don't need philosophy such as i have give i unto thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk get off of your seat of self-pity and government dependence and believing in some political party or some administration in the white house that's going to give you anything every good gift my help coming from the lord i appreciate a job i appreciate uncle sam amen i appreciate a help in a time of trouble but i want to tell you i know the source hallelujah and i will thank you but i'm gonna praise him i'm gonna give him the highest praise [Applause] and all these people sitting around in the devil's bondage brother tim i'm just waiting on my ship to come in oh brother tim if you knew my condition an enemy hath done this your condition is not your problem it is a symptom of a deeper underlying issue that will result in a fatality the problem is the mindset so you started thinking the way your adversary an enemy had done this he planted a tear in your mind and you started accepting your condition and he says your daddy had it your mama had it your aunt had it it was put on you it was projected on you that's a lie from the pits of hell it come from the devil and you can put it back on his head you are not a victim you are not [Music] hallelujah you are not under satan you have power you have authority when you recognize your sonship and your relationship to the almighty god and the day you recognize that the devil's in trouble because you don't have to scream you don't have to shout you don't have to get on facebook you can go to the source and say god i need you right now and when you get up i'm going to hit this one while i'm having fun brother tim i'm just going to go home and i'm going to send my tithes up to headquarters and i'm waiting on the prophet to return so the vision the vision can then unfold and i want to be in that fulfillment okay if that's what you want i hope you're not disappointed with the outcome may i remind you of a little woman who had a son dying from a venereal disease he had contracted as a result of a sinful lifestyle but he had a godly mother that had a connection [Applause] [Music] satan's given you a path uh satan's given you a path of destruction god's speaking to somebody tonight you'll never convince me that god didn't tailor this service for somebody god's prophet was on a journey and on a mission and he had a point of origin and he had a destination but some mother started praying [Applause] don't think you're a victim don't think all the storms and all the trials and all the currents and all the dissuasion is a result of satan's doings remember he's operating under a lease all his power was given to him temporarily to exercise his trickery so here was a woman that had a connection plane comes down in a storm is grounded overnight and god's prophet is there in memphis tennessee an unplanned stop an interruption don't tell me that prophet of god wasn't following a vision that god had ordained for his life but the vision amen had a little hickey a little space of time that is not the end of eternity it's just a brief pause and he's walking down the street i'm so glad that i can say one of them the holy spirit says turn right here but i got letters to mail i've got a bri you know i got a flight again turn right here turn right here turn right here turn he's walking away from the airport he's walking away from his only way out he's not walking in his own vision [Music] he walks down the street he sees a lady leaning over the fence moaning parson how did you know i was a person now who was having a vision you're waiting on brother branham to come back brother branham and all the saints of ages past might just be waiting on you to realize who you are and get a connection with god and get a revelation if i'm that shunamite woman you got a prophet somewhere and he was walking into her vision [Music] where are we at church we're not waiting on brother branham they without us cannot be made complete oh my yeah you need a vision brother ben said one planet out of order would throw the entire solar system and he said one believer out of their position paralyzes the whole program of god when you recognize your position who you are where you stand we're going to rock the devil's world right out of orbit amen hallelujah he walked in that lady's home he saw a picture of jesus christ he said i knew i was in a christian home said ma'am would you pray why don't you try it why don't you get on your knees and pray oh but brother tim i got a schedule to keep i got a job i got these kids i got this i got this get together i got this birthday party i got this church function i got this church of it oh i gotta go go go you're trying to put god on your schedule why don't you stop your schedule and say god i'm on your time now amen the prophet said you pray and when she began to pray he felt the anointing he felt the spirit of god and he realized his purpose he realized his purpose as a result of her prayer and her determination and her unyielding resolve i'm not going to let my child die as a victim of a venereal disease that he contracted as a result of sinful living how many people would have resigned to the doctor's diagnosis but she caught a revelation and that revelation did not put her on a pillow of predestination it put her on her knees saying god if i am who you tell me i am then you send the prophet that i know if i'm here then he's got to be somewhere close by hello church when you get in your position the prophet will be less than six feet away in another dimension waiting to rejoin you in this dimension in a glorified condition and for 40 days we will congregate together before we meet the lord in the air amen praise the lord oh how i love jesus praise the lord [Music] an enemy has done this the tares the false seeds the weeds they're not just sown into the church they're sown into humanity and they're sown into you god's going to save you fill you with the spirit his spirit and spend the rest of your life plucking weeds ideas thoughts complexes issues genetic predispositions all of these things that got sown into humanity when satan mixed his seed you're a victim of it if you in one sense but you're a victor through christ on calvary and he's sending now reapers to say your response to the revealed word of the hour testifies to whether you are a terror or a wheat [Music] because the tares are genetically predisposed to like denominational structure they got to feel like they belong to something big they got to feel recognition they like the united nations approval they like the ecumenical council of churches they want to feel like they're being embraced by other religions with similar views but differing convictions and a tare says i will gladly join and the wheat says if i have to stand alone if i had to be by myself if i had to be on the back side of the desert no family no believers no friends no associations if i have to be like daniel and the three hebrew children i'm not going to compromise for approval friendship friendship that is based on compromise is not friendship it's fraudship it's not friendship it's not love it's lust it's pity oh i love him brother tim i'm gonna i'm gonna make a real man at him quit pitying him if you love him tell him you get filled with the holy ghost you become a son of god and if you then love me as much as you love god we'll think about we'll think about it but until you get to an old-fashioned altar and you get filled with the holy ghost you can't reform cigarettes away from him you're not going to take away the desire to be in the pool halls and the booze joints and running around with the skimpy girls hello you want a husband or do you want a liability for the rest of your living years if you want a husband go to god and say god i'm standing right here until you send me a holy ghost-filled husband and until he does you tell every serpent no i'd have no time i have no ear i have no interest i'm already taken i'm already spoken for that was free an enemy had done this sickness disease viruses it i tell you what now our problem is not covered our problem is all the opinions that surround the covet hey is god god is god in control is god greater than any sickness and any disease and any virus any affliction hey i'm not saying go cough and sneeze on each other i wouldn't do that to a healthy person but i'm not going to let a little bit of fear [Music] interrupt my connection they said it's a death sentence if we catch you praying to the hebrew god daniel said i'll throw the windows open and pray a little louder because you're not messing with my connection oh will he deliver you that's not the question that's a distraction whether he does or whether he does not one thing we're determined i'm not gonna bow i'm not gonna bend and i won't burn try it try it it's been tried in the fire before it's going to be tried in the fire again amen fire does not destroy gold fire proves gold fire does not destroy silver fire proves silver fire does not destroy precious material or precious metals when you go into the fire you come out refined you come out cleaner brighter shinier you reflect the image of the maker even more than you did before the fire [Applause] sin the fire lord sin the fire lord oh my burn away everything that's not like you lord oh but but but but brother tim you don't understand my situation okay friends it's hard for me to believe that after 6 000 years god needs to change his ways nothing's ever beaten nothing's ever defeated him nothing's ever deterred him or derailed his purpose in 6 000 years satan has tried every thing he can think of he's the one going insane he's he's running out of plays he's running out of tactics he's running out of strategy he's running out of maneuvers and all the things that used to work don't work anymore so tension i think oh my what's this tension if i could have been born without the tension well if i wouldn't have had this tension i wouldn't have been what i am you say oh brother tim i hate friction well how many of you enjoyed driving on the ice is that the way you want to go through your life slipping and sliding around [Applause] friction helps us move somewhere and know where we were and appreciate where we are now [Applause] if i wouldn't have had this tension i wouldn't have been what i am i wouldn't have been a christian perhaps it was this tension this tension that drove me to jesus christ see it's been a blessing thing to me so then as paul said as though when he had tension or something another he had consulted the lord to take it away from him three times and the lord said saul my grace is sufficient he said then i'll glory and my infirmities then when i'm weak i'm strong god is a god of contrast as great and as powerful and as mighty and as shrewd as the devil is god is greater the contrast helps us if we can see how powerful how powerful how manipulative how shrewd what a mastermind the devil is we should appreciate god all the more because he made the devil he gave him everything he had taught him everything he knows and the devil for 6 000 years has been trying to replicate but he can never duplicate because he's an imitator he's not an inventor he's never had an original idea just a perverted if people knew what the devil was they wouldn't serve him and they'd be less fearful of him because as much as you can appreciate the devil realize he was a created being to give us a contrast to make us believe and love god all the more i'll glory in my infirmities then when i'm weak i'm strong as long as it's to the will of god all right i got to close an enemy hath done this trying to confuse the original seed the bride material with the grafted vine the church corporate oh yeah brother tim you're talking about denominations right of every variety including those within the ranks of so-called message believers see brother tim here's how it is we got it you need to come over here and you need to line up and and join up with us if you can appreciate my ability eve he's got you if he can impress you with what he can do and you can be enticed by ability you're the prime candidate for his deception but if you can say satan if that's the way you're trying to impress you're only testifying to who you have always been i'm not serving god for what he can do i'm serving god for who he is i'm not serving god for the rewards those are going to come as the result of the relationship they're unavoidable but if the relationship is not there you're only getting the gifts but rebecca said there's a source and i'm willing to ride a camel tray across a desert wilderness and follow a man to find who sent the man and that's what differentiated the bride from the pentecostal and denominational and independent sisters they said we're satisfied to stay right here where we came from she said not me this is not where i came from i come from the mind of god and when i heard the message i realized this is not my home this is not my origin this is not who i am that is who i am and the message comes to call you to the giver and it does not disall or discredit the gifts it puts them in their place because it recognizes the value [Music] i just gotta hit this brother stephen you see a woman with decked out with all the tencent jewelry of the jewelry store she doesn't know her value she's trying to attract with a false value because she's insecure of her true value hello but true gold and true things of precious worth are concealed and hidden and discreet and they're buried beneath a veil i'm gonna hit it church what's all this flashy religion an enemy had done this but god buried his treasure and said when you recognize where the treasure is you go sell everything else everything else to get the field with the treasure on the inside [Applause] it doesn't have to be flashy shiny it doesn't have to have a seat on the ecumenical council it doesn't have to have the adore and and all the things of the world we don't need the devils endorsement we've already got ours the message is already vindicated and it's being vindicated i have both glorified it and i will glorify it again it was glorified in christ it was glorified in the 120 that came out of the upper room on the day of pentecost here's my here's my punchline it was glorified in a waved sheath yes sir an enemy hath bound and bundled the tares but the wave chief is lifted up as a declaration the only thing remaining is me in a mini-membered expression called the body of jesus christ [Applause] let the sun rise let the revealed word of the hour shine let the son of man ministry and revealing be preached and lived it is the rising of the sun it's time for the declaration of the true wheat one came to maturity and was lifted up the ministry of jesus christ resurrected after seven church ages but one was not there to be admired and adored and crystallized and petrified as the only living expression of jesus christ in a human body it was there to testify it may be 10 years it may be 20 years it may be 1990 it might be 2000 it might be 2022 but somewhere there's a field full of jesus christ just like the original they won't settle for less they won't settle for a counterfeit they won't settle for a personality yup an enemy had done this but the rising of the sun had done this we're reflecting an original light an original source it is the rising of the sun and when the head rose the body rose with it his vindication was not just himself but it was all those who died in the faith and the same will repeat are you watching for the coming of the glad millennial day when our blessed lord shall come and take his waiting bride away oh my heart is filled with rapture as i labor watch and pray you're laboring watching and praying as a result of the rapture dwelling in your heart which will bring you into the climax of the rapture it's a rapture calling for a rapture it's a deep calling to thee stand with me oh my heart is filled with rapture as i labor watch and pray for our jesus to come back to earth again his return in the skies will be a result of the readiness of his return to the temple an enemy had done this but his maker is about to call back the note and say you failed satan you were worshiped as god for 6 000 years by 99.9 of humanity but there was point one percent one in a million who would not bow who would not bend and they're not gonna burn glory hallelujah give me the key of f if you can i feel like having a pentecostal jubilee right here oh our lord is coming back to earth again [Music] yes our lord is coming back to earth again [Music] satan will be bound a thousand years we'll have no temptation after jesus shall come back to earth again sing that verse first i am watching for the coming of the glad millennial day when our blessed lord shall come and catch his waiting bride away oh my heart is filled with rapture as i labor watch and pray for our lord is coming back it's worth again oh our lord is coming back to earth again yes our lord is coming back to earth again satan will be after a thousand years we'll have no tempter after jesus shall come back jesus coming back will be the answer to earth sorry christ for the knowledge of the lord shall feel the earth and sea and sky god shall take away all sickness and the sufferers tears will dry when our savior shall come back to earth again oh our lord is coming back to earth again are you watching oh our lord is coming back to earth again [Music] satan will be about a thousand years we'll have no tempter there after jesus shall come back to earth again and the ransom of the lord shall come to zion men with joy and in all his holy mountain nothing hurts or shall destroy perfect peace shall reign in every [Music] heart after jesus shall come back to earth again oh our lord is coming back to earth [Music] after jesus shall come back again now listen in the sin and sorrow pain and death of this dark world shall peace in a glorious way with jesus of a thousand years of peace all the earth is groaning crying for that day of sweet release for our jesus shall come back again oh my lord it's coming back to earth again hallelujah our lord is coming back to earth again satan will be back a thousand years we'll have no temptations after jesus shall come back earth again [Music] glory hallelujah oh my brother oh my sister hallelujah that rich man came from chicago down to the ranch and all those girls danced they displayed all of their skills and all of their tricks and all of their abilities and he was so disappointed what i was looking for is neither here nor there but when he stepped out to take a break from the denominational circus he saw something that caught him right here he said do you know why i'm here he revealed his purpose to the one he had intentions of taking home all those girls inside had their ideas of what it would take to catch his attention he told her his purpose and said will you she did she didn't have to hear how wealthy he was what he could do for her he offered her will you come with me and be my wife and she felt unworthy to even be offered much less to accept and that was the response he was looking for it vindicated yes my brother that she was the one if she said oh i've just been waiting all this time i got some fancy shoes oh and i've been taking dance lessons and i can shoot her response was the vindication and he slips away with a promise and a guardian he left an agent there that could watch and ensure that she was safe and protected until his return the prophet teaches there was an agent appointed by the man to watch her and make sure she was not defiled before he returned what is the proof that he's coming back here he's coming back for me i'm the reason he came the first time i'm the reason he came in the revealing of the son of man and i heard the proposal and didn't even feel worthy much less questioned the credibility of the agent he sits and her attitude confirmed she was the recipient and the designated beneficiary of all that he was [Music] and he said on a certain day i will return and the witness of his return was her preparation and readiness she wasn't looking for an excuse to cut corners and compromise the expectations she was quite happy to prepare herself to leave and go i'm not looking to get comfortable here i'm not staying here it's not where i'm from and it's not where i'm staying i'm getting ready to go an enemy had done this but he had done this god bless you this evening give the lord a hand of praise tonight amen what a wonderful message amen this is wednesday it's like a sunday morning blessed be the name of the lord young sister do you understand what the holy spirit has been saying did you get it really since sunday you have not caught it yet if i break it down it's going to be a problem amen make sure you are married to a christian you think he's not cool that's the perfect husband for you amen don't work for him let him be the husband don't chase him don't impress him do you know the story he just said have you read it with brother branham have you read it do you know where did they find the woman at on facebook she was doing what washing water what beauty do you expect to see a woman when she's washing dishes do you see now do you see now but that man found something there that's what men usually look for and the younger sister don't understand that young assistants still don't understand that watch their poster you see they don't understand that amen the one who's really shy that tried to get away that's the one that impressed men not the one that put up themselves that the man backs off they will talk to you and before you know it they marry somebody else they joke with you and they marry somebody else and they marry the one you like wow yes there is something in here that you don't have that you taught you more prejudice but you're not it's the other party that is evaluating amen uh young sisters god have a husband for you look for a genuine christian because marriage have a lot of stuff that have nothing to do with the hollywood all the posters you see people posting on facebook it's not reality i'm not permitted i would never tell you but if i was permitted you hear the story of married people you would never think what is going on so the best thing to do get a genuine husband a man who is a christian who loves you then everything will be okay and right at the beginning gear your husband to the word of god don't try to please him don't try to condone with him if he comes home he say no we can stay home and stream don't let him sit home i know what i'm talking about amen because when you're gonna wake up maybe five seven years in marriage and you're trying to change him to be a leader of the home you will see what you're dealing with because you already got him used seven years of having everything he want that is contrary to the word of god everybody care so right at the beginning amen before even you get married when you talking teach him that it is two o'clock you cannot call me at this time he will learn he will love you more when you hang up the phone he's like wow that's the one i need if you think no if i don't get answered that phone at two o'clock he's gonna get mad you are actually building him up a certain way that you're gonna entertain all your life and continue to suffer i am telling you what is the truth amen amen i'm not saying be rude that's not what i'm saying but stand on your christian ground tell them man i'm not gonna leave this home you come to our home and you talk to me tell that man we're not gonna ride the car with you tell that man keep your hand in your pocket he will understand you and he's going to respect you he's not going to be afraid of you because if you lose that respect you're going to manipulate him to work him up a different way so you can control him and when you do that you outside the word of god because you're trying to control the man you're already outside the word of god control him by the christian life amen i'm your wife but i won't tell that lie brother branham did something and made her just like you know what you did was wrong right they taught the prophet amen amen that's what the men need and the man when he goes to work he knows that i have a wife over there not a wife that is yes yes yes yes yes yes let's quit work yes you have to do this yes i'm not gonna do this yes uh i like to wear this kind of jean how does it look you know no it's okay i don't see any problem no tell him this doesn't look respectable look at how everybody's dressing you the only one that dressed different i don't think this looks serious on me he will respect you amen tell him you follow me to my home i'm not gonna follow you you're the one looking for me it is christ who left the glory coming this way we didn't go to heaven clinging there and say jesus christ come and make no he left glory he came down looking for you dog i have a quote brother branham say a woman doesn't seek for a man today it's a way around the young people they come he's coming over there i'm gonna get a trip and be there you paying the trip to meet a man because he's going to a party in tennessee wasting your time stay in north carolina let the man leave colorado all the way here pay his ticket pay the hotel and come to your home and when you get there you say what do you want tell that man like that it won't take too long it won't take too long that man will come and marry you but try to play game oh there is a fist in colorado i'm gonna be buying the ticket and going there you're training him and that's how you're going to be paying the bills at home that's how you're going to be paying bills at home because you already got him used to you get in the restaurant no no no i'm going to swap the card you

everybody's there anybody care i don't want 10 10 sisters 20 sisters and then when i get there it's only two amen so you talk together and find out then we're gonna tell you a little bit about certain things you need to know amen i'm telling you this by love i've seen a lot of stuff marriage when it doesn't work it's a lot of headache and the person that suffers a lot is the woman most of the time because you're trying to build the marriage and children here and before you know it the children are giving you a hard time and you can focus in the husband that is acting like a baby you have to push him in everything even to go to work you got to push him and now you're the one working trying to pay the bills and he's getting his money and spending out you the one that built him up that way amen let him be a man let him be what he is don't build a complex around him you're going to suffer amen you're going to suffer i have i i i came aground across brothers that live like they have a shield and when you meet them they know that you're going to see the real them and they have a tendency to back up because the more you talk to them you're going to realize they're not what they would have been projecting so before you know it they're trying to be isolated like hey god bless you god bless you and there are they're hiding something because they put up an image a man and the one who's on the laptop is the sisters tell him this answer this tell him this answer this you're wasting your time let him be a man and people accept him the way you are even if he you you have a phd and your husband is a high school degree you don't have to pump him up let him just be a christian nobody will play with him easy let's just be a christian nobody will play with him if you see a man
