[0:01] He put the thing so far away that it
[0:03] couldn't be discovered by a smart
[0:05] man. Now I'm going to show you where
[0:07] that smart man comes from. Where he
[0:09] where he's at
[0:10] anyhow. See, it can't come through that.
[0:14] It's got to come by
[0:15] revelation. Dart the Christ the son of
[0:19] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[0:22] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[0:24] it. Spiritual revelation.
[0:27] How did how did Abel know to offer a
[0:30] lamb instead of Cain offering the fruits
[0:32] of the field? It was spiritually
[0:34] revealed to him. You don't get it about
[0:36] seminaries. You don't get it through
[0:37] denominations. You get it from heaven.
[0:42] Now watch the serpent. This serpent
[0:45] which was first, let's draw a picture of
[0:47] him now. He's a great big fellow. He's
[0:49] between the japanzi and the man. And the
[0:52] serpent, the devil, Lucifer, knew that
[0:55] that was the only blood that would mix
[0:57] with this human
[0:59] blood. The only person he could deal
[1:01] with. He couldn't deal with a
[1:02] chimpanzeee. That blood would
[1:04] mix. He couldn't deal with different
[1:06] things. He couldn't deal with the sheep.
[1:08] He couldn't deal with a horse. He
[1:11] couldn't deal with any animal. He had to
[1:14] deal with this serpent. Let's take him
[1:18] out and see what he looks like. It's a
[1:19] great big fellow, prehistoric giant.
[1:23] That's where they find these big bones.
[1:24] And I'll show you this in the Bible.
[1:26] Now, watch
[1:27] closely. All right. This great big
[1:30] fellow, let's say he he was 10 foot
[1:32] tall, great big shoulders, looked just
[1:35] like a man. And his blood after coming
[1:38] down, coincing one animal to another,
[1:41] you cross animals and it kept getting
[1:43] higher blood, higher form of life,
[1:45] higher form, that it climbs up into the
[1:47] man realm. But the last connection here
[1:50] between here was cut off. How many knows
[1:52] that science can't find the missing
[1:54] link? All of you know that. Why? Here he
[1:57] is the serpent. Here he was a great big
[2:01] fella. And the devil comes down. Now he
[2:04] says, "I can't inspire." Now when you go
[2:06] to looking at women and women, remember
[2:08] you are anointed of the devil.

[5:42] Amazing
[5:45] grace shall
[5:47] always be my song of praise.
[5:55] For it was
[5:58] grace that bought my liberty.
[6:07] I do not
[6:11] know just why he came to love me.
[6:19] So he looked
[6:23] beyond all my faults and saw my need.
[6:31] [Music]
[6:33] I shall
[6:37] forever lift my eyes to
[6:44] Calary to view the
[6:49] cross where
[6:51] Jesus died for me.
[6:58] How
[7:01] marvelous the grace that called
[7:08] my soul. He looked
[7:14] beyond my fault and so my let's sing I
[7:19] shall forever lift my eyes.
[7:22] I shall
[7:26] forever lift my eyes to
[7:33] Calary to you that
[7:38] cross where Jesus died for me.
[7:46] How
[7:50] marvelous the grace that called
[7:54] [Music]
[7:56] my soul. He looked
[8:01] beyond all my walls and saw my knees.
[8:10] He looked
[8:14] beyond all my faults and so
[8:20] [Music]
[8:23] mighty. Heavenly
[8:25] Father, Lord, what a glorious thing,
[8:28] Lord, that you did on Calvary for us,
[8:30] Lord God.
[8:32] Lord, when we were still in sin, Lord,
[8:34] you died for us, Lord, and you just
[8:38] watched over us, Lord, and just
[8:39] throughout our years, Lord, until we
[8:42] heard the eagle cry, Lord
[8:44] God. We thank you, Father,
[8:47] Lord. We thank you for calling us, Lord.
[8:50] We thank you for choosing us, Lord
[8:53] God. Lord, you're our strength, Lord,
[8:56] when we're weak, Lord God.
[8:59] You're our joy, Lord, when we're
[9:01] heartbroken, Lord God. Lord, you're
[9:04] everything to us, Lord God. And how we
[9:07] want to come together, Lord, that's such
[9:09] as this, Lord, on a Sunday morning, Lord
[9:11] God, a Mother's Day, Lord God, and just
[9:14] worship you, Lord, for everything that
[9:16] you do for us each and every day. We
[9:19] thank you for the gathering we had
[9:21] yesterday, Lord, and the word that came
[9:22] forth, Lord, and the understanding,
[9:24] Lord, that you've given us to help us
[9:27] walk right and as a Christian in our
[9:30] lives, Lord God. You're so good to us,
[9:33] Lord God. You're so good to us, Lord, to
[9:37] place such a ministry, Lord, and to let
[9:39] us sit under it, Lord God, and just to
[9:42] Lord, just to have you reveal yourself
[9:44] to us. So Lord, we want to lift you up
[9:48] this morning, Lord, for everything that
[9:49] you've done,
[9:51] Lord. We've come to hear your word once
[9:53] again, Lord God, to see another portion,
[9:56] Lord, as small or large as you choose to
[9:59] show us, Lord, another portion of Jesus
[10:02] this morning, Lord. And we ask, Lord
[10:04] God, that you would just manifest
[10:06] yourself and make yourself known to us
[10:08] this morning in this congregation. Bless
[10:11] the singers this morning, Lord God.
[10:12] Bless the musicians, Lord Jesus. Bless
[10:16] the mothers today, Lord
[10:18] God. Bless our pastor, Lord
[10:21] God. Let everything go smooth, Lord, for
[10:24] you, Lord God, just as you would have,
[10:26] Lord. Anoint everyone for their post,
[10:30] Lord, including the ameners in the
[10:32] congregation, Lord. It's an anointing as
[10:36] well, Lord. and bless our technicians as
[10:38] well, Lord, who allow this to go across
[10:41] the sea, Lord, and across the waves. We
[10:45] thank you, Father. We see what you're
[10:47] doing behind us here on the building,
[10:49] Lord, and we just give you glory for
[10:52] that as well, Lord God. How good can you
[10:55] be to us, Lord God? How much more, Lord?
[10:59] You're so wonderful,
[11:01] Lord. How could we not choose but to
[11:04] love you, Lord, and to serve you, Lord?
[11:07] with all of our hearts, Lord. Have mercy
[11:10] on us. Forgive us of our sins, Lord.
[11:13] Give us this day, Lord, our daily bread,
[11:16] Lord, our portion. For you, Jesus, are
[11:20] our portion. We thank you, Father. Bless
[11:23] everyone here, Lord. And may you be
[11:25] blessed as well in Jesus Christ's name.
[11:28] Amen. And amen. Let's give him a clap
[11:31] offering this morning. You can turn
[11:32] around and greet your neighbor this
[11:34] morning and say, "Welcome to the house
[11:36] of the
[11:38] Lord." Let me go ahead and read this
[11:42] while we are standing. Normally, I try
[11:45] to read a poem as well, but I think the
[11:47] word of God expresses it all in Proverbs
[11:50] 31 of a virtuous woman. Amen. And that's
[11:54] what God is making out of all of us,
[11:57] even the men as a bride, a member of his
[12:00] bride.
[12:01] Amen. Amen. And
[12:05] amen. Praise
[12:14] God. So, I'm going to start with
[12:17] Proverbs
[12:19] 31:10.
[12:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:29] Amen.
[12:43] How wonderful is our fellowship.
[12:47] Amen. And the love we have for each
[12:49] other. Amen. Let me read Proverbs 31
[12:55] 10-31. And it starts, "Who can find a
[12:59] virtuous woman? For her price is far
[13:02] above
[13:03] rubies. The heart of her husband doth
[13:06] safely trust in her, so that he shall
[13:09] have no need of spoil. She will do him
[13:12] good and not evil all the days of her
[13:14] life. She seeketh wool and flax, and
[13:17] workketh willingly with her hands. She
[13:20] is like the merchant ships. She bringeth
[13:23] her food from afar. She riseth also
[13:26] while it is yet night and giveth meat to
[13:28] her household and a portion to her
[13:31] maidens. She considerth the field and
[13:34] buyth it with the fruit of her hand. She
[13:36] planteth a vineyard. She gertth her
[13:38] loins with strength and strengthenth her
[13:41] arms. She perceiveth that her
[13:43] merchandise is good. Her candle goeth
[13:46] not out by night. She layeth her hands
[13:49] to the spindle, and her hands hold the
[13:51] daff.
[13:53] She stretcheth out her hand to the poor.
[13:56] Yay, she reaches forth her hand to the
[13:59] needy. She is not afraid of the snow for
[14:01] her household, for all her household are
[14:04] clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself
[14:07] coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is
[14:10] silk and purple. Her husband is known in
[14:13] the gates, while he sits among when he
[14:15] siteth among the elders of the land. She
[14:18] maketh fine linen, and sellleth it, and
[14:20] deliverth girdles unto the merchant.
[14:23] Strength and honor are her clothing, and
[14:26] she shall rejoice in time to come. She
[14:30] openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in
[14:32] her tongue is the law of kindness. She
[14:35] lookth well to the ways of her
[14:37] household, and eateth not the bread of
[14:40] idleness. Her children arise up, and
[14:42] call her blessed, her husband also, and
[14:45] praiseth her. Many daughters have done
[14:48] virtuously, but thou, little bride, I'll
[14:51] throw that in. Little bride, excelst
[14:54] them all. Favor is deceitful, and beauty
[14:57] is vain, but a woman that fearth the
[14:59] Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of
[15:03] the fruit of her hands, and let her own
[15:06] works praise her in the gates. Can we
[15:09] give a clap offering for the mothers
[15:11] this morning?
[15:13] Amen. Hallelujah.
[15:17] Praise
[15:19] God. So, let's sing a little bit this
[15:22] morning and uh enjoy inviting God's
[15:27] presence in. We believe he's here
[15:29] already cuz I know a lot of you, most of
[15:31] you, if not all of you, have brought him
[15:33] with you. Amen. Praise
[15:36] God. Praise God.
[15:44] [Music]
[15:46] [Applause]
[15:48] [Music]
[15:53] [Applause]
[15:55] [Music]
[15:55] [Applause]
[15:57] My heart was
[15:59] distressed to hold as red frown and low
[16:03] in the pit where my sins dragged me
[16:07] down. I cried to the Lord from the deep
[16:11] I recla
[16:13] who genderly brought me out this
[16:18] morning. He brought me out of the
[16:23] fing. He set my feet on the rock to
[16:28] sing. He puts a song in my soul today. A
[16:35] song of praise. Hallelujah.
[16:41] He placed me upon the strong rock by his
[16:45] side. My steps were established. And
[16:49] here I have no danger of falling. While
[16:54] here I remain and stand by his grace
[16:59] until the crown I gave. He brought me
[17:04] out of the fing.
[17:06] [Music]
[17:08] Peace and my feet on the rock to
[17:12] stay. He puts a song in my heart today.
[17:18] A song of praise.
[17:24] Hallelujah. He gave me a song was a new
[17:28] song of praise. My day and my night.
[17:32] It's
[17:33] sweet of praise. My heart's
[17:37] overflowing, my path free. I'll praise
[17:41] my redeemer who has rescued
[17:45] me. He brought me out of my
[17:50] reg. He sent my feet on the road to
[17:56] stay. He puts a song in my soul
[18:01] today. A song of praise.
[18:05] [Music]
[18:07] Hallelujah. I'll sing of his wonderful
[18:11] mercy to me. I'll praise him till his
[18:17] goodness shall sing. I'll sing of
[18:20] salvation at home and above till many
[18:25] shall hear. Trust trust in God.
[18:30] He brought me out of the
[18:34] mir. He set my feet on the road to stay.
[18:40] He puts a song in my soul
[18:44] to a song of praise.
[18:49] Hallelujah. Yes. He brought me out of my
[18:55] way. peace and my feet on the rock to
[19:00] stay. He put a song in my soul to a song
[19:07] of praise. Hallelujah.
[19:13] Hallelujah.
[19:19] Listen, listen. I I mean, if you think
[19:22] just think of everything he's brought us
[19:24] through, even together, he's brought us
[19:26] through a lot together.
[19:29] Amen. That was a little high for me. So,
[19:32] I had to take a breather just a second.
[19:34] It's tough trying to figure these keys
[19:36] out cuz I like to go one to the next to
[19:38] the next. And that just didn't happen.
[19:40] It's too high. I'm gonna stay in the
[19:43] same key though, brother. I think
[19:45] we'll go ahead. Give me a lead in.
[19:50] It just depends on the
[19:53] song. Have you been to Jesus for the
[19:57] cleansing power? Are you washed in the
[20:01] blood of the
[20:03] lamb? Or are you fully trusting in his
[20:07] great his power? Are you washed in the
[20:11] blood of the lamb?
[20:14] For are you
[20:16] washed in the
[20:18] blood? In that soul cleansing blood of
[20:22] the
[20:23] lamb and are your
[20:26] garments are they white as so are you
[20:30] washed in the blood of the
[20:33] lamb? How are you cleaning daily by the
[20:39] savior? Are you washed in the blood of
[20:42] the lamb?
[20:45] And do you rest each moment in the
[20:49] crucified? Are you washed in the blood
[20:52] of the
[20:54] lamb? Are you
[20:57] washed in the
[20:59] blood? In the soul cleansing blood of
[21:03] the lamb.
[21:05] Now your
[21:07] garments are the white as are you washed
[21:12] in the blood of the
[21:14] lamb. Now when the bridegroom come will
[21:18] your ros
[21:20] be you in the blood of the lamb.
[21:25] Now will your soul be ready for your
[21:30] man and be washed in the blood of the
[21:35] lamb. Now are you
[21:38] washed in the
[21:40] blood in the soul cleansing blood of the
[21:45] lamb. in your garments. My blessed are
[21:49] they white and so are you washed in the
[21:53] blood of the
[21:55] lamb. So lay aside the garments that are
[22:00] stained with sin and beed in the blood
[22:04] of the lamb.
[22:06] Yes, there's
[22:08] a flowing for the soul unclean. will be
[22:13] washed in the blood of
[22:16] lamb. Oh, are you
[22:19] washed in the
[22:21] blood in the soul in blood of the
[22:26] lamb? Are your
[22:29] garments are they white as snow? Are you
[22:33] washed in the blood of the lamb?
[22:38] With
[22:39] my I will
[22:42] answer. When he calls for me, I will
[22:46] hear. Yes. When my savior calls, I will
[22:52] answer. I'll be right there. Listening
[22:56] for my
[22:57] name. Oh, I'll
[22:59] bewhere this. I'll be somewhere.
[23:02] Listening. I'll be somewhere. Listening
[23:06] for my name.
[23:08] I'll be somewhere listening. I'll be
[23:12] somewhere. I'll be somewhere listening
[23:16] for my
[23:17] name. If my heart is right, he calls me.
[23:24] If my heart is right, I will
[23:28] hear. Yes. If my heart is right when he
[23:32] calls me, I'll be right here listening
[23:37] for my
[23:38] name. Oh, I'll be right here. Listen,
[23:42] I'll be right here listening. I'll be

[23:48] name. I'll be right here listening. I'll

[24:04] me. If my road is white I will

[24:57] here listening for my name.
[25:04] Hallelujah.
[25:05] [Applause]
[25:06] [Music]
[25:07] Hallelujah. Now, you know the quote
[25:10] about the the pope's been going around
[25:12] and brother Brown says, "Wake up."
[25:16] So, if you ain't listening, you got to
[25:18] be listening. You ain't going to hear
[25:21] nothing. Amen. Y'all can be seated. I've
[25:24] got a couple of praise reports here. We
[25:26] do have two testimonies and we have two
[25:28] specials.
[25:33] Amen.
[25:35] Hallelujah. So, Brother
[25:37] Logos, we saw his parents yesterday at
[25:40] the meeting. He would like to thank God
[25:42] for the traveling mercy that he provided
[25:44] going to and from Africa on their last
[25:47] trip. They just recently got home. So,
[25:49] we want to thank the Lord for that.
[25:50] Amen.
[25:52] Praise
[25:53] God. And I'm going to invite Brother
[25:56] Charles Hamilton Jr. up here to give his
[26:00] testimony and then Brother Greg has one
[26:02] and then we'll um pray for our tithes
[26:05] and offerings this morning. Amen.
[26:09] Amen. God bless you everyone. Um first
[26:12] testimony is my uh report came back from
[26:15] my grandfather that they didn't find
[26:18] anything in his prostate and they said
[26:20] if it was if if it's there it's too tiny
[26:22] they can't even find it. You know I
[26:24] think it was a blessing because sister
[26:27] Sharon had just given a testimony by her
[26:30] father just before. So I was in great
[26:32] expectation because I knew the spirit of
[26:34] God was moving in that area. Um, we were
[26:37] on our way to brother
[26:39] Josh's graduation yesterday and my truck
[26:43] just got out the shop. So, I think it is
[26:46] fine, but the front g the front seal
[26:49] broke on the transmission again that
[26:50] they just put in. So, I had to end up
[26:53] getting it towed and we had to get a
[26:55] rental. But, while we were sitting there
[26:56] waiting for the toe to come, there was a
[26:59] gentleman that was well, I'm walking
[27:01] around trying to figure out what's going
[27:02] on. I smelled the transmission fluid and
[27:04] whatnot. And there was a gentleman that
[27:06] followed us off the highway and he took
[27:08] his time before he came over there. My
[27:10] wife said, she said, "Sweetheart, that
[27:11] man been over there for a little while
[27:13] just peeking, seeing it, you know, when
[27:14] he was going to come over." But when he
[27:16] saw me lift the hood up, he came over.
[27:18] He said, "Yeah, you were, you know,
[27:19] going down the road. I saw spill all
[27:21] over the place, you know." He said, "It
[27:23] smells like transmission fluid." So that
[27:24] was the confirmation. I said, "Okay,
[27:26] well, I got to call somebody, get a
[27:27] rental." So on and so forth. Well, my
[27:30] wife said, "Well, there's a tow truck
[27:32] right behind us." I said, "Well, no,
[27:34] that's not a tow truck. I saw another
[27:36] truck, but the tow truck was directly
[27:37] behind me, so I didn't see it." So, I
[27:39] looked back. I said, "Oh, okay." So, I'm
[27:40] on the phone with the um the the mobile
[27:43] mechanic. You know, they wanted to
[27:45] charge extremely too much just to come
[27:46] out and diagnose the vehicle. So, after
[27:49] that, I walk back while I'm still on the
[27:51] phone and my uh the gentleman said, my
[27:53] wife was actually talking said, "Sweet,
[27:55] I'm on the phone with the uh the uh the
[27:57] mobile mechanic. So, you go and you know
[27:59] try to get his attention so he don't
[28:01] pull off." So he ended up waiting. My
[28:03] wife was talking to him and then when he
[28:05] came over I said I told him to hold on
[28:08] and after he held on for a while. The
[28:10] gentleman came out and he said, "Well,
[28:12] I'm a transmission mechanic." So he
[28:14] looked under the vehicle. He said,
[28:15] "Yeah, the seal is broken." so on and so
[28:17] forth. But I'm saying all that to say
[28:19] the Lord had everything in position,
[28:22] you know, just to get us where we needed
[28:24] to go, you know, and and you know, and I
[28:26] I I just know in my heart that that was
[28:28] that was the Lord showing grace to my
[28:32] precious brother over here for his
[28:34] accomplishment because, you know, I
[28:36] called brother. I said, "Brother, I may
[28:38] not make it." So on and so forth. He
[28:39] said, "No, just take care of your
[28:40] family, but someone's pressing on my
[28:41] heart. No, I got to get there." You
[28:43] know, and all of those things transpired
[28:45] and God moved in a supernatural way to
[28:47] congratulate that young brother and I
[28:49] thank the Lord for
[28:53] it. Amen.
[28:56] Come on up, brother Greg.
[28:58] Hold on. Hold on. Brother Kimma wants to
[29:00] intervene here. I got to say something
[29:03] because brother Charles called me
[29:06] yesterday. He said, "Brother, I got to
[29:09] come." I said, "Brother, take care of
[29:10] your family. you you know I was looking
[29:14] at you still over there and you got to
[29:15] make it all the way over here and you
[29:18] probably gonna get there when it's
[29:20] done and then I thought I told my wife I
[29:24] said
[29:24] no we have to blend our faith together
[29:29] with the brother if he have that amount
[29:32] of faith that he's going to make it we
[29:36] have we cannot stand in his way let's
[29:38] push oursel to the side and trust the
[29:42] Lord. Amen. And when we got there, the
[29:45] seats were I'm like, "Okay, we got to
[29:47] get the seats because brother Charles
[29:49] coming." And lo and behold, I received a
[29:51] phone call. Brother KMA, we've made it.
[29:53] I y'all made it. Y'all went to the uh to
[29:58] get the uh rental and then y'all ma they
[30:01] made it on time.
[30:04] So, don't ever get in anybody's way that
[30:08] believes
[30:18] Well, that's something. And talking of
[30:21] faith, that's what I'm up here to do.
[30:24] Um, you know, we're supposed to confess
[30:27] things before they ever happen.
[30:31] So, and
[30:33] um I'm supposed to have cataract surgery
[30:37] next month and I was looking at what
[30:40] they do and all that and I told my wife,
[30:42] I said, "You know, the Lord can heal
[30:46] this." And Brother Brandham told that
[30:49] story about the fella at the garage
[30:53] uh fixing his car and they couldn't find
[30:56] out. And this guy walked in and he knew
[30:59] exactly what to do. Well, that's the way
[31:01] I look at things. The Lord designed
[31:04] these bodies,
[31:06] you know,
[31:09] and he he's the chief mechanic.
[31:13] So, uh,
[31:17] so I'm confessing through before this
[31:19] group of believers that I am not going
[31:22] to need that cataract surgery.
[31:28] Amen. Praise God.
[31:32] Well, you remember he asked that little
[31:34] girl that didn't that didn't have eyes,
[31:36] "What color do you want?"
[31:38] And she got it. Amen. Praise God. Praise
[31:41] God. I do not have any prayer requests
[31:44] this morning, but I'm sure we have each
[31:47] one of us, if I came by and asked you,
[31:48] you'd have something on your heart this
[31:50] morning, whether you want to speak it or
[31:52] not, or write it down or not. Let's
[31:54] stand this morning and hold these things
[31:56] in our heart for the Lord. Brother John,
[32:00] do you mind coming up and praying this
[32:02] morning, Lord? Come on,
[32:04] brother.
[32:07] Amen.
[32:13] Amen. Amen. Lord have mercy.
[32:18] Lord, thank you. You are the high and
[32:21] lofty one that inhabits eternity, but
[32:24] yet you dwell with those that are of a
[32:26] humble and a contrite spirit.
[32:30] Thank you for the atmosphere, Lord. An
[32:33] atmosphere, Lord, within this little
[32:36] body of believers, an atmosphere of
[32:39] love, an atmosphere, Father, if you cut
[32:42] it, it will bleed because there's life
[32:44] in it, Father. And you say by this all
[32:47] men would know.
[32:54] Hallelujah.
[32:56] That we are your disciples.
[32:59] If we have love one for the other,
[33:01] Father, thank you for all the wonderful
[33:04] testimonies, Lord. Your grace upon your
[33:07] children, Lord, we are called by your
[33:09] name. Thank you for our leadership here,
[33:11] Lord. Brother Steven Simbo and his
[33:14] family, Lord. Oh God, we how we
[33:17] appreciate you. It's your flock, Lord.
[33:21] Sometime we have a tendency to say my
[33:23] church, but Lord, it's your church. It's
[33:26] the undersheperd. Lord, you've appointed
[33:28] who you want to feed your children. And
[33:32] we thank you. Amen. Yes, Lord. Every
[33:35] time we come, Lord, you fill us, Lord.
[33:38] You feed us. Amen. Amen. With the bread
[33:42] from heaven, life in it, Father, the
[33:45] bleeding word.
[33:47] Yes, Lord.
[33:50] Lord,
[33:54] thank you.
[33:56] Bless the service, Lord. Lord, look upon
[33:59] every need. You know, nothing's hid from
[34:01] you, Father. Oh, God. We just thank you,
[34:05] Lord. And we look to you. Bless the
[34:07] tithe and the offering, Father. Oh, God.
[34:09] We just look to you. You're our help in
[34:12] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[34:20] Amen. Amen. We do have a couple of
[34:23] specials this morning. I'm going to
[34:25] invite Sister Gift up this morning.
[34:29] Amen. Hallelujah.
[34:46] God bless the
[34:53] saints. Storms of life are
[34:58] raging. God's
[35:01] darkness fills the earth.
[35:07] The strive among the
[35:12] nations, pest your lands and
[35:17] famine and wars on
[35:21] every
[35:24] hand.
[35:25] Valance sweeps through the land.
[35:32] The
[35:33] word of our
[35:36] Lord reveals a place of
[35:40] refuge where the
[35:43] rightous can run and be
[35:49] [Music]
[35:50] saved. When we
[35:52] run the
[35:55] blood, the death angel can slay us.
[36:01] We'll be safe till we're
[36:05] ten
[36:09] away in a
[36:12] moment. We'll be
[36:15] gone. We'll be
[36:17] taken from this
[36:20] world out of
[36:22] time into
[36:25] eternity.
[36:27] [Music]
[36:31] Out of
[36:32] darkness, holy
[36:34] light, out of
[36:37] death, into
[36:39] life, out of
[36:42] time, into
[36:44] [Music]
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:45] [Music]
[36:49] eternity. The storms of life are raging.
[36:56] cross
[36:57] darkness fills the
[37:02] earth. The strife among the
[37:07] [Music]
[37:10] nations,
[37:12] pestilence and
[37:14] famine and wars on air.
[37:20] [Music]
[37:21] hand by your lens sweeps through the
[37:29] land. But the
[37:31] word of our
[37:34] Lord reveals a place of
[37:39] refuge where the
[37:41] rightous can run and be safe.
[37:46] [Applause]
[37:49] When we're
[37:51] under the
[37:53] blood that death ain't
[37:58] true, we'll be safe till we're
[38:03] ten
[38:07] away. In a
[38:09] moment, we'll be gone.
[38:13] will be taken from this
[38:16] world out of
[38:19] time into
[38:22] eternity.
[38:27] Out of
[38:28] darkness, into
[38:30] light. Out of
[38:33] death, into
[38:35] light. Out of
[38:37] time,
[38:45] into chaos and
[38:49] confusion. Men's hearts are filled with
[38:55] fear.
[38:57] as terror strikes around
[39:03] them. Despite all
[39:08] destruction, they still cling to
[39:13] worldly
[39:15] cares. They keep living in despair.
[39:23] But the
[39:25] children of
[39:27] God abide in safety and
[39:31] peace far away from the
[39:43] uncom of the rock.
[39:47] We are completely
[39:50] sheltered as we wait for that last trump
[39:56] to
[40:00] serve. In a moment, we'll be
[40:04] gone. We'll be taken from this world out
[40:10] of
[40:11] time into eternality.
[40:19] Out of
[40:20] darkness, into
[40:23] light, out of
[40:25] death, into
[40:27] life, out of
[40:29] time, into
[40:33] [Music]
[40:37] eternity. And there comes a time when
[40:41] the spirit of God will depart.
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] Then none shall be healed and none shall
[40:51] be
[40:54] saved. This world is again falling
[40:59] apart as the prophet
[41:03] said. So enter it now before it's too
[41:07] late.
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:15] Oh, in a
[41:17] moment we'll be
[41:20] gone. We'll be taken from this world out
[41:26] of
[41:26] time into
[41:31] [Music]
[41:33] eternity. Out of darkness, into
[41:38] light. Out of
[41:40] death, into light.
[41:43] out of
[41:44] time into
[41:49] eternity.
[41:51] Yeah. No more
[41:53] darkness, only
[41:55] light, no more
[41:58] death, only
[42:00] light out of
[42:02] time into
[42:07] eternity. Saints, host, spread your
[42:11] wings. Prepare for flight. Faster than
[42:16] the speed of
[42:18] light. Out of
[42:20] time
[42:22] into
[42:24] [Music]
[42:27] eternality. No more darkness, holy
[42:31] light, no more
[42:33] death, holy
[42:35] light. out of
[42:38] time into
[42:43] eternity. Saint spread your wings.
[42:47] Prepare for
[42:49] flight. Faster than the speed of
[42:53] light. Out of
[42:56] time into eternality.
[42:59] [Music]
[43:03] Out of
[43:05] darkness, into
[43:07] light, out of
[43:09] death, into
[43:11] life, out of
[43:14] time,
[43:16] into
[43:17] [Music]
[43:21] eternality, out of
[43:24] time into
[43:32] Oh no.
[43:35] [Music]
[43:43] Amen.
[43:45] Hallelujah.
[43:47] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:52] I've asked brother Zach to sing his song
[43:54] this morning as well. Amen.
[43:58] Praise God.
[44:03] God bless you all.
[44:05] I have to testify about something that's
[44:07] been burning on my heart.
[44:11] Um, so I'm taking this course right now
[44:14] for HVAC and uh I wasn't going to
[44:18] testify about it until after it was
[44:19] over, but brother Greg said uh we should
[44:22] testify before things happen. So I was
[44:26] like that's that's my sign. I got to I
[44:28] got to testify about this.
[44:31] So, uh, it's a really hard course.
[44:33] Um, they have multiple quizzes and
[44:36] tests, and it's it goes on, uh, between
[44:39] like a basically a three-month period,
[44:42] and it's it's a whole bunch of quizzes
[44:45] and tests, uh, basically every
[44:48] week. And so, um, I've had I've been in
[44:52] it for a month now. And so, I've taken
[44:56] two quizzes and one final exam. And it
[44:58] has three parts.
[45:00] and uh then a final exam at the very
[45:03] end. So um it's it's really strict. So
[45:09] they basically
[45:10] uh you can't fail qu like uh you can't
[45:14] fail more than two times or else you're
[45:16] out of the program and you can't be late
[45:19] or more than once or you're out of the
[45:21] program. So it's very strict. It's like
[45:24] a boot camp. Yeah. They basically take
[45:26] two years of experience or two years of
[45:28] schooling and they compress it into two
[45:31] and a half
[45:32] months. So,
[45:34] um I recently had my first exam and it
[45:38] was a two-part exam. It was a practical
[45:41] hands-on and then there's a written
[45:43] portion and I got 100% on both of
[45:49] those. That is all God. That is all the
[45:52] Lord. I give all glory to God for that
[45:56] because there's so much that I could say
[45:58] about this. How I'll be sitting in class
[46:00] and the things are just clicking for me
[46:03] and and it doesn't even it doesn't even
[46:06] make sense how it's all coming together
[46:07] so quickly because of how fast-paced it
[46:10] is. And it's just prayer and God answers
[46:13] answering prayer just putting everything
[46:14] together for me. I know that he'll take
[46:16] me through the rest of this program with
[46:18] no issues. I have full confidence. So, I
[46:20] just had to testify about that before it
[46:22] even before it even happens.
[46:28] And I know who I am because I know who
[46:30] he is. Amen.
[46:39] [Music]
[46:48] I know who I
[46:52] am cuz I know who you are.
[46:59] The cross of
[47:02] salvation was only the
[47:08] start. Now I am
[47:13] chosen, free and
[47:18] forgiven. I have a
[47:22] future and it's worth the living.
[47:30] I wasn't made to be tending a grave. I
[47:34] was called by nature. Born and raised
[47:38] back to life
[47:41] again. I was made for more.
[47:48] Oh, why would I make a bed in my shame
[47:52] when a fountain of grace is running my
[47:56] way? I know I am yours and I was made
[48:02] for
[48:04] more. I know who I
[48:09] am cuz I know who you are.
[48:15] The cross of
[48:17] [Music]
[48:20] salvation the
[48:23] song
[48:28] now. Pray and forgive
[48:33] you. I have a
[48:35] [Music]
[48:37] future. It's worth living.
[48:44] I was made to mean tending a grave. I
[48:48] was called
[48:51] by raised back to life
[48:54] again. I was
[48:57] [Music]
[49:01] faithful. Why would I make a bed in my
[49:05] shame when a mountain of grace is
[49:09] running my way out?
[49:13] And I
[49:14] was
[49:19] born.
[49:23] Hallelujah. You call out my name. So
[49:26] I'll sing out your
[49:28] praise.
[49:32] Hallelu. You buried my past. I'm not
[49:36] going
[49:37] back. Hallelu.
[49:42] You call out my name. I'll sing out your
[49:46] praise.

[50:02] grave. I was called by name. Born and
[50:06] raised back to die again.

[50:15] for. So why would I make a bed in my
[50:20] shame when the fountain of grace is
[50:23] running my way? I know I am yours and I
[50:28] was faithful.
[50:36] [Applause]
[50:37] [Music]
[50:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's stand. We'll
[50:46] stand. We're going to invite our pastor

[55:34] What else do you want?
[55:38] What else?
[55:40] Huh? What else do you want? What else do

[55:46] purple garment. It happened.
[55:49] He say either president or vice
[55:52] president. How many option do you have?
[55:55] Now she became a vice president. What
[55:57] the argument of?
[56:00] And the people in the message was
[56:02] waiting for her to become president. And
[56:04] God pushed Donald Trump to block that
[56:08] because the prophecy is already been
[56:10] fulfilled. And brother Brandham say mark
[56:13] this down. If it doesn't happen, I'm a
[56:16] false prophet. Did it happen?
[56:21] Brother Brham say there will be another
[56:23] president who's going to be a Catholic.
[56:25] Did it happen? And Joe Biden fulfilled
[56:27] the prophecy. Did it happen? Yes.
[56:31] Yes. The Bible spoke about the last
[56:34] Trump when no one thought Trump is going
[56:37] to run again. Did it happen?
[56:42] And an incident happened when Trump was
[56:45] piercing the right ear.
[56:49] Come on. You don't remember this
[56:51] anymore. He was a servant to the high
[56:54] priest.
[56:56] Come on. and he went and made a picture
[57:00] of him wearing the pope clothing
[57:04] telling you that the Catholic is already
[57:06] on the power
[57:09] and it doesn't take too long a pope from
[57:11] the United States
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:18] and his name is Leo
[57:22] which is the last son of the
[57:24] zodiac speaking about the coming of the
[57:27] Lord. And when the enemy comes like a
[57:30] lion,
[57:33] like Leo the lion.
[57:40] Amen. There is also seven thunders that
[57:45] are roaring like a lion.
[57:49] So it's Leo against
[57:52] Leo. Leo against Leo.
[57:56] We are ready for the fight.
[57:58] We are ready for the hour.
[58:01] Wake up church.
[58:04] The time has come.
[58:10] It is beautiful to be in the
[58:13] message. It is beautiful to believe the
[58:17] message. It is wonderful to believe the
[58:20] message. That's why I'm proud to be in
[58:23] the message. People play with brother
[58:26] Brandham so much. This is a vindication.
[58:30] That's why God took a picture with him.
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:40] What else do you want?
[58:44] Should I push you to come to church?
[58:48] Should I push you to believe the
[58:49] message? The time is late.
[58:54] [Applause]
[58:55] It's time to wake up, brother Glenn.
[58:59] No more playing church.
[59:02] When what the prophet say happened
[59:05] according to the Bible, you must listen
[59:07] to the prophet.
[59:11] And when you listen to the prophet to to
[59:14] the prophet, that's when you prosper.
[59:20] Are we together? Are we together? You go
[59:23] read that prophecy again. Brother
[59:25] Brandham said the shallowminded
[59:28] will go into the confederation of
[59:30] churches. The shallow minded, the one
[59:34] that don't like deep things.
[59:38] [Applause]
[59:38] [Music]
[59:41] Your mind is shallow because you don't
[59:42] go in the deep things. You need the
[59:45] thunders.
[59:48] [Applause]
[59:49] Amen. Amen.
[59:52] What else do you want? Leo the 14th.
[59:57] We talked about number 14th. You
[59:59] remember that in question and answer.
[1:00:01] You remember that?
[1:00:03] It's a complete circle.
[1:00:06] Very Brandham say 14th means seven
[1:00:08] churches of Israel and seven churches of
[1:00:13] the gentile. You remember that in
[1:00:14] question and answer. And the pope is
[1:00:16] coming as number 14, the last church of
[1:00:20] the gentile. That's why seven planet
[1:00:23] were lineup.
[1:00:31] I'm not going to preach on prophecy, my
[1:00:33] friend. If you notice, it was first six
[1:00:36] planet to line up and the seven one
[1:00:39] waited for February the 28th
[1:00:44] and it was and when it was February the
[1:00:46] 28th that's when the last one line up
[1:00:49] because the bride according to the
[1:00:51] preview the last one will get offline
[1:00:54] but the prophet will scream go back to
[1:00:57] line and the zodiac has told you that
[1:01:01] the bride is coming back to
[1:01:04] That's why the second oil is open.
[1:01:07] That's why it's a different anointing.
[1:01:10] God is bringing the brand back to line.
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:18] What else do you want?
[1:01:22] You should thank God every day to be
[1:01:26] part of the message. Yes sir. Because
[1:01:29] modern event are made clear by prophecy.
[1:01:33] There are people in this message, they
[1:01:34] look at the pope, they don't even
[1:01:36] understand.
[1:01:41] Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] And do you know what? Do you know what?
[1:01:45] Come on. Now you taking my minute.
[1:01:52] Do you know what?
[1:01:55] Do you know who fulfilled the second
[1:01:57] seal?
[1:02:01] The first seal it's the white horse
[1:02:03] rider.
[1:02:04] The second seal is the red horse rider.
[1:02:08] And he had a sword.
[1:02:11] He because he was a killer.
[1:02:14] That's why his sword he that's why the
[1:02:16] color was red. And brother Brandham said
[1:02:19] through that, do you follow me? The
[1:02:23] devil the Catholic church killed 68
[1:02:27] million. Amen. That's right. Amen. It
[1:02:30] was an anointing of massacre.
[1:02:34] That's why he was red. Amen. Blood.
[1:02:36] Amen. Are we together? That's why in
[1:02:39] Revelation 17 when you look the woman is
[1:02:42] drunk with the blood
[1:02:46] of the saint. Amen. And the one who
[1:02:50] initiated the massacre.
[1:02:54] Are we together? His name is St.
[1:02:57] Augustine.
[1:03:00] Of hippo. Amen. Do you remember him? And
[1:03:03] he came up with a law that anyone who
[1:03:06] doesn't believe the Catholic Church
[1:03:10] heretic. He's a heretic and he must be
[1:03:13] put to death. Are we together? And
[1:03:17] because of that and brother Brandham
[1:03:18] said the Holy Ghost came to him to
[1:03:21] baptize him and he rejected the Holy
[1:03:24] Ghost. I have quote after quote are we
[1:03:28] together and he came up with a law and
[1:03:31] his law
[1:03:34] put to death 68 million people. Do you
[1:03:38] follow me? Do you follow me? And he
[1:03:41] opened up the order
[1:03:44] called the Austinian
[1:03:47] order.
[1:03:49] Are we together? And since he opened
[1:03:52] that order, no pope came from that
[1:03:55] order.
[1:03:58] Are we together? And the first pope,
[1:04:01] come on now, brother. Come on now. That
[1:04:03] came from that order, brother. of St.
[1:04:06] Augustine Hippo is the American pope.
[1:04:09] That's exactly right. Glory to God. I
[1:04:12] hope you are understanding sir. The
[1:04:14] first pope that is coming from that
[1:04:16] lineage to God is the American pope.
[1:04:20] What is he telling you? Yes, sir.
[1:04:24] Yes, sir.
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:27] Because the tribulation is coming.
[1:04:30] And the foolish virgin must be killed
[1:04:34] with 144,000.
[1:04:39] I am not going to be a victim to the
[1:04:41] pope. I am going up.
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:49] If you stay in this world, you will be
[1:04:51] killed.
[1:04:53] The anointing is already there.
[1:05:00] Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] Why do you pull this stuff now? I'm not
[1:05:04] even ready to preach on it. Are we
[1:05:07] together? The last messenger was from
[1:05:10] which country? USA. From which country?
[1:05:15] So, brother Brandham is who? American.
[1:05:18] He's an American.
[1:05:25] Have I say something wrong? So, who do
[1:05:27] you think the Pope must come from?
[1:05:32] Is that a problem? Is that a problem?
[1:05:34] I'm opening your eyes, my friend.
[1:05:38] And the last messenger of the Gentile,
[1:05:42] God had something to do with his body.
[1:05:50] That's why God say, "Do not smoke,
[1:05:54] do not drink, do not touch women."
[1:05:58] Because God had to enter their body.
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:02] right there.
[1:06:05] To fulfill Luke 17:30. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:06:10] Are we together? Yes sir. And according
[1:06:12] to brother Braham when me and you are
[1:06:15] going up the devil will enter the top
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:29] church of the living God. You remember
[1:06:31] when we were preaching about the beast
[1:06:33] and the seven heel and everything? You
[1:06:36] go to the Vatican, seven here and
[1:06:38] brother Brandham was given seven heal
[1:06:40] with his name on seven heels. Seven he
[1:06:44] got the devil answer.
[1:06:52] Can I continue? Can I continue? Can I
[1:06:56] continue? For those that were in a
[1:06:58] married couple meeting yesterday, do you
[1:07:01] know when the pope was born?
[1:07:04] Nine month
[1:07:06] after the prophecy
[1:07:08] and he was a boy and the pregnancy of a
[1:07:11] boy take nine month.
[1:07:17] Go verify. When brother Brandham spoke
[1:07:20] nine month, the pope was born.
[1:07:24] So brother Brandham saw his pregnancy.
[1:07:27] [Applause]
[1:07:28] when his pregnancy was entering the ego
[1:07:31] scream.
[1:07:36] And say there is a pope that is coming
[1:07:39] from America. I am an American. I am in
[1:07:43] America. A pope just
[1:07:48] enter. And the eagle eye is the one that
[1:07:51] can detect and tell you what is going
[1:07:53] on. In other words, the eagle eyes saw
[1:07:57] the pope and scream. He said, "There is
[1:07:59] a pope coming.
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:08] Where else should we go?" Lord Jesus,
[1:08:11] you have the key of life. This message
[1:08:15] is everything.
[1:08:17] This message is Jesus Christ.
[1:08:22] Whatever brother Brandham tells you to
[1:08:24] do, don't argue. Do it.
[1:08:28] Don't lean to your own
[1:08:30] understanding. Lean on the prophetic
[1:08:33] insight. Because it's that serve the
[1:08:36] Lord. Don't wrestle with the message. If
[1:08:39] the message say take earring off, take
[1:08:42] it off because the message is preparing
[1:08:45] you. Take the high heel off, take it
[1:08:47] off. Take the t dresses off. Take it
[1:08:50] off.
[1:08:55] Respect the message. Humble before the
[1:08:58] message because the message is right.
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:11] You see people are still joking online,
[1:09:14] arguing,
[1:09:17] fussing, debating. There is no time for
[1:09:21] debate. If somebody doesn't believe it,
[1:09:23] leave him alone. Keep your eyes focused.
[1:09:29] I'm not in this pit to debate. I'm here
[1:09:32] to deliver the message and to live and
[1:09:35] believe the message. Period my friend.
[1:09:39] And brother Brandham said the bride will
[1:09:41] be driven out of the Methodist
[1:09:44] Pentecostal and this and we got those
[1:09:46] denomination in the message.
[1:09:51] So brother who you are following me
[1:09:53] online you in the dead church
[1:09:57] and you don't listen
[1:09:59] they don't want to read brother brand
[1:10:01] I'm in that church and you still staying
[1:10:04] there
[1:10:09] and the message is the blood when you
[1:10:13] remove the message you remove the blood
[1:10:18] you You are staying there because it's a
[1:10:20] family church. You are staying there
[1:10:22] because you've been there 20 years. You
[1:10:25] got used to it. But your wife is
[1:10:28] struggling. Your husband is struggling.
[1:10:31] Your children are struggling. Come out.
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:46] You who after the money, your money will
[1:10:49] stay here.
[1:10:51] Your money will stay here. Instead of
[1:10:53] going to church, you saying you you are
[1:10:56] you after money. Your money will stay
[1:10:57] here.
[1:10:59] Me, I'm a dentist. I don't have a
[1:11:01] problem. When my savior come my cabinet,
[1:11:04] I leave everything. I'm going with my
[1:11:07] savior. Whoever take over it, that's the
[1:11:10] problem.
[1:11:16] Are we together? Are we together? We
[1:11:20] greet you all in the precious name of
[1:11:22] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:11:33] [Applause]
[1:11:40] It's impossible for something like this
[1:11:42] to happen and me keeping my mouth
[1:11:46] because the because they open their big
[1:11:49] mouth too long
[1:11:54] and the critic mouth must be shut
[1:11:58] because God is interpreting his own word
[1:12:02] by bringing it to pass.
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:09] What a precision.
[1:12:12] What a precision.
[1:12:14] What else do you want to wake up? You
[1:12:16] waiting for Los Angeles after all of
[1:12:19] this is happening. You're still waiting
[1:12:20] for Los Angeles.
[1:12:22] Really? What are you waiting for?
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] Sooner they will close the churches.
[1:12:39] But we got the devil answer, bring the
[1:12:42] pressure
[1:12:43] and watch the third pool.
[1:12:48] [Applause]
[1:13:00] Do you see what the prophecy is doing to
[1:13:02] you? You knew the prophecy. And when it
[1:13:06] happened, what did it do to you? It got
[1:13:08] you excited. So when you see the
[1:13:10] pressure coming, the anointing get you
[1:13:13] excited. In other words, it's time for
[1:13:16] fight.
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:21] It's time for fighting.
[1:13:26] In other words, the opening of the
[1:13:28] seals. We cannot be surpassed
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:33] just as expected.
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:44] Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:47] My friend, everything is if you miss, if
[1:13:50] you were playing, go back on YouTube,
[1:13:52] you will find when we talk about the
[1:13:53] beast, the seven here. Go back and
[1:13:56] review all of that again. Go back again
[1:13:59] and review because as a message church,
[1:14:01] when we say beast, it should not be a
[1:14:03] new vocabulary.
[1:14:05] You should be right there. If it's a new
[1:14:07] vocabulary, we need to watch the pulpit.
[1:14:09] Right. Right. Hallelujah. You cannot be
[1:14:12] in the message 20 years. You don't know
[1:14:13] what the beast is.
[1:14:16] In other words, you don't even know who
[1:14:18] you fighting against.
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:24] Amen. War everywhere.
[1:14:27] Trump thought he can make a deal with
[1:14:29] Putin.
[1:14:31] Do you know what happened? Putin back
[1:14:33] up. Because prophecy will dictate.
[1:14:37] According to prophecy, Putin must
[1:14:39] destroy the Vatican in United States. I
[1:14:43] won't be a barbecue.
[1:14:46] You stay here yourself. I won't be a
[1:14:49] barbecue.
[1:14:51] I am a god. I came from God. I'm going
[1:14:55] back to
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:15:05] God. Amen. Brother Glenn, we got
[1:15:08] something else to preach,
[1:15:10] but I can't bypass without touching
[1:15:12] prophecy. Uh because this should make
[1:15:15] people of God jumping,
[1:15:18] dancing.
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:26] Because when prophecy is happening, no,
[1:15:29] I will get to that. I will get to that.
[1:15:35] I will get to that. Let's leave it
[1:15:37] alone.
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:16:00] We intended
[1:16:02] we intended the roof of the extension.
[1:16:06] When you came there, you saw the roof a
[1:16:08] little bit elevated. We intended to
[1:16:10] flush the roof. Come on, brother. With
[1:16:13] this roof right here,
[1:16:17] right? We intended to flush everything.
[1:16:21] And the measurement of that intent was 6
[1:16:24] by3.
[1:16:26] 6 by 12. Yes sir. And for some reason an
[1:16:29] error was made
[1:16:32] and the measurement changed 7 by 12.
[1:16:36] [Applause]
[1:16:42] What?
[1:16:44] 8 by 12. The measurement change 8 by 12.
[1:16:49] My god. My god. You think it's a
[1:16:51] coincidence?
[1:16:54] When he changed, he took the third roof
[1:16:57] and elevated it. So now the church have
[1:17:01] three roof.
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:10] And they cannot change those trusses.
[1:17:13] They are made one time custom made. So
[1:17:16] there is no going back. Now you got a
[1:17:18] roof at the entrance. A roof right here
[1:17:21] and a third roof like the tabernacle.
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:36] My friend, let me
[1:17:38] preach. My friend, let me preach.
[1:17:41] In other words, even your mistake

[1:20:00] Wake up, church.
[1:20:03] Get yourself consecrated.

[1:22:37] of anyway. We know you. God richly bless
[1:22:40] you and welcome to spoken word. Anybody
[1:22:42] else? Welcome to spoken word. Amen.
[1:22:48] I believe we are all up to date with the
[1:22:50] sermon. We're reading our Bible. Cood
[1:22:52] church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seal
[1:22:55] adoption or somebody is listening and
[1:22:58] loving the message of Yahweh.
[1:23:05] Amen. Amen. Our question and answer. I'm
[1:23:09] still waiting on the deacon to give me
[1:23:10] the date. Lord's willing. We had a
[1:23:12] wonderful married couple meeting
[1:23:14] yesterday and by God grace it seems like
[1:23:17] we close even though there were couple
[1:23:19] point that were bought to me. I will see
[1:23:22] how we will do that if either we will I
[1:23:25] don't know if we will get another part
[1:23:26] or we get a half of that part and move
[1:23:29] to the next one and see if we can cover
[1:23:32] those point but it took a while. We went
[1:23:35] court after court after court after
[1:23:38] quote for those that were there
[1:23:39] yesterday. Even the last quote was the
[1:23:42] quote that summarizes everything about
[1:23:46] birth control and ectopic pregnancy and
[1:23:49] all of that. We covered that yesterday
[1:23:51] and gave you all the scripture in
[1:23:54] detail. Now you understand what brother
[1:23:57] Brandham says about birth control. I
[1:23:59] went into a much deeper deeper study
[1:24:02] compared to what I gave to the young
[1:24:04] sisters and the young men. So before you
[1:24:07] get married,
[1:24:09] see the deacon. Amen. And go listen to
[1:24:11] everything. I gave quote and scripture.
[1:24:13] Quote and scripture to line everything
[1:24:15] up together so that is clear. Amen. So I
[1:24:19] will see what I would do with those two
[1:24:21] point that was that were brought to me
[1:24:23] and we see where that we going to have
[1:24:24] part seven or part seven. We flip it and
[1:24:27] we go straight toward the finances. And
[1:24:29] I will stay again in the word and in the
[1:24:32] message of the hour. That's the way I
[1:24:34] shoot. The remaining you take it
[1:24:36] somewhere else. But here the word and
[1:24:38] the message of the hour. Everybody
[1:24:40] clear? Amen. Happy Mother's Day. Amen.
[1:24:53] Young man, we see you on June the 7th.
[1:24:56] Brother Robert, I believe I cover
[1:24:58] everything. Praise God. So now, let's go
[1:25:00] to the reading of the word.
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:07] My subject this
[1:25:10] morning, ah, flight attendant, prepare
[1:25:13] for takeoff. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:25:16] Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly
[1:25:19] tonight. Father, what a joy in our heart
[1:25:23] Lord to see the day that we are living
[1:25:26] in a glorious day where prophecy have
[1:25:30] been fulfilled one after the other.
[1:25:32] Father, reassuring to us that the ggoing
[1:25:36] time have arrived. Lord, Father, we
[1:25:39] thank you for the prophet. We thank you
[1:25:41] for this message. We thank you for being
[1:25:44] part of this word Lord of this end time
[1:25:47] because we ourselves we are the seed. We
[1:25:50] are the word of the living God. Lord
[1:25:52] this is as far as I could go with the
[1:25:54] ability you have given me. But when he
[1:25:57] come Lord father to teach and Lord
[1:25:59] father to preach and to minister to your
[1:26:01] children. It's only an action of the
[1:26:03] Holy Spirit. Father may you move me
[1:26:06] completely out of the way. May you come
[1:26:08] down and speak to our soul Lord. Be the
[1:26:10] beginning and the ending and bless those
[1:26:12] that are here and those online Lord.
[1:26:14] Father in Jesus precious name. Amen. My
[1:26:19] subject this
[1:26:20] morning is our life journey through
[1:26:24] Joseph's five
[1:26:26] garment. Amen. Last Sunday I have to
[1:26:29] switch the team because we were unable
[1:26:32] to finish. So I called the team Mary and
[1:26:35] Martha. Amen. I'm putting those team for
[1:26:39] quick reference because if you go part
[1:26:41] one, two, three, you won't remember
[1:26:43] which part is what. So when you look
[1:26:45] online, you will always see the team
[1:26:46] that give you a clue exactly on this
[1:26:49] part. This is what we dealt with this
[1:26:51] part. This is what we dealt with. So it
[1:26:52] makes life easy. So now our subject
[1:26:55] today is what we left is a multi-purpose
[1:26:59] life. Amen.
[1:27:02] Amen.
[1:27:03] a
[1:27:04] multi-purpose or
[1:27:06] multi-purpose life. Multi-purpose life.
[1:27:11] And let's see if we can finish
[1:27:14] Lazarus. And if we finish Lazarus, that
[1:27:17] will be great. Then we pick up Christ.
[1:27:20] And then if we pick up Christ, that will
[1:27:22] be wonderful. Then we see what do you do
[1:27:24] when you are in season and what do you
[1:27:27] do when you are out of
[1:27:29] season? Amen. That when we finish that
[1:27:33] one, then we try to begin to come back
[1:27:35] up to the surface, the book of
[1:27:37] remembrance, and then begin to pick
[1:27:39] things left and right and try to get up
[1:27:42] from party for house so we can move to
[1:27:44] the prisoner.
[1:27:47] Do you see where we are?
[1:27:50] So, we will try by God's grace to come
[1:27:52] up slowly, pick up the book of
[1:27:54] remembrance. You know, the book of
[1:27:55] remembrance again, huh? and then pick it
[1:27:58] up again and keep moving and climbing
[1:28:00] and clinging and clinging. Then back
[1:28:02] again to party for house. Now let's go
[1:28:04] to the prisoner. Then we change the
[1:28:06] garment. We Okay. Amen. But before we
[1:28:10] even come up over there, remember we are
[1:28:13] under the blood in the golden altar.
[1:28:16] So before we climb up, we have to take
[1:28:18] the blood that goes under the altar.
[1:28:23] So we pick that one up and then climb up
[1:28:25] back up. Amen. You see where we are?
[1:28:31] Ah, glory to God. Let's go to Genesis
[1:28:35] 15.
[1:28:39] Ah, you go so deep until you begin to
[1:28:42] forget what is up there.
[1:28:45] But we got the GPS. So we pick up
[1:28:47] Christ, we pick up the other one, then
[1:28:49] we go back up, pick up the blood that
[1:28:52] goes under the altar, and then we move
[1:28:54] on and pick up the book of remembrance
[1:28:55] and move on and continue to go move on
[1:28:58] until we come out of the house of party.
[1:29:03] Amen.
[1:29:04] Uh Genesis
[1:29:07] 50:15. If you're there, you can say
[1:29:09] amen. All right, my friend is there.
[1:29:12] Good. Genesis 50 verse uh 15. The Bible
[1:29:16] say, "And when Joseph's brethren saw
[1:29:20] that their father was dead," you
[1:29:22] remember this, they say, "Joseph will
[1:29:26] perhaps hate us and will certainly repay
[1:29:29] us all the evil which we did to him."
[1:29:33] When people do bad things to you, they
[1:29:35] think that you going to you are the same
[1:29:38] breed as them. I know, right?
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:43] You might be
[1:29:44] seated. They are expecting revenge.
[1:29:49] I am not a revenge.
[1:29:53] God is the one that will avenge me.
[1:29:58] Amen. And not everybody is like you. You
[1:30:01] mean I'm not mean. I am a good seed.
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:08] Amen. Amen. Amen. And they sent a
[1:30:12] messenger to Joseph saying, "Your father
[1:30:15] did command before he died, saying, "So
[1:30:19] shall you say to Joseph,
[1:30:22] forgive." He's using the leverage of the
[1:30:25] father. Amen. I pray you now the
[1:30:27] trespass of your brethren and their sin,
[1:30:30] for they did you they did to you what?
[1:30:33] Evil. And now we pray you forgive the
[1:30:36] trespass of the of the servants of the
[1:30:40] Lord of the God of your father, the
[1:30:44] servant of the God of the father doing
[1:30:46] evil.
[1:30:48] Amen. Amen. And Joseph wept when they
[1:30:51] spoke to him. And his brethren also went
[1:30:54] and fell down before his face. In other
[1:30:57] words, let's do this quickly before we
[1:30:58] get in trouble again. We accept. We
[1:31:00] agree. We agree with the vision. The
[1:31:02] vision that you save me. We agree.
[1:31:06] We don't want any more trouble. We
[1:31:08] agree. Amen. Amen. And his brethren also
[1:31:14] went and fell down before his face. And
[1:31:16] they say,
[1:31:17] "Behold, we be your servants." I thought
[1:31:21] you say, "You're not going to rule over
[1:31:23] us."
[1:31:25] And Joseph said to them, "Fear not,
[1:31:29] for am I in the place of God?" Now,
[1:31:33] what's wrong with you?
[1:31:36] Amen. Verse 20. This is where I'm going
[1:31:38] to draw something. But as for you,
[1:31:43] you thought evil
[1:31:46] against me. Remember the the evil
[1:31:49] came because of the vision.
[1:31:53] Are we together? You okay? Right. It is
[1:31:56] the vision that pull evil.
[1:32:00] Amen. Because division can only develop
[1:32:04] in the presence of evil.
[1:32:10] You can only develop under an American
[1:32:12] pope.
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:19] You need that pope in place.
[1:32:22] It is good
[1:32:24] because for the bride, he's going to do
[1:32:26] something to you.
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory to God. He
[1:32:37] says, "You taught evil against me, but
[1:32:42] we clear who was thinking evil,
[1:32:46] brothers. The brother were thinking
[1:32:49] evil." The brethren,
[1:32:51] the brethren of Joseph, Amen. were the
[1:32:56] one thinking evil.
[1:33:00] Why? Because of the vision
[1:33:04] until they say let's kill him. So we
[1:33:07] will see what will happen of the dreams.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:12] You thought evil against me.
[1:33:16] But you following me?
[1:33:19] God meant it
[1:33:24] for what? Good.
[1:33:27] So the evil they were thinking,
[1:33:30] God needed it. Amen.
[1:33:39] The word meant means intended.
[1:33:43] It means plan.
[1:33:46] That meant means meant means
[1:33:52] intended or
[1:33:54] plan. In other word,
[1:33:57] God the vision God gave pull evil and as
[1:34:02] evil is
[1:34:03] coming, God begin to plan,
[1:34:08] he begin to use the evil.
[1:34:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:14] He's using the evil to what?
[1:34:20] Can we read? He say you taught evil
[1:34:23] against me but God meant it to what for
[1:34:28] good. So God will use the evil
[1:34:33] that is coming toward you. Amen. Do you
[1:34:36] follow me? And use that evil for good
[1:34:41] because all things
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:46] in your life work together for what?
[1:34:49] Good. So it doesn't matter what is
[1:34:52] coming up. If it's good, good. If it's
[1:34:55] evil, no problem.
[1:34:59] I don't know if you get it. If it's
[1:35:01] good, good. If it's evil, no problem.
[1:35:04] There is a software that is there to
[1:35:08] change evil toward good. Amen. So the
[1:35:11] input is not the problem. The output is
[1:35:14] what the problem is. But the output is
[1:35:17] expected.
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:22] Are we together? The output is always
[1:35:26] good.
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:30] So what can the devil do to you?
[1:35:37] You do me good. Fine. You don't do good.
[1:35:40] No problem. No problem. You're not doing
[1:35:42] good means good. Amen.
[1:35:48] Amen. God meant it what good to bring to
[1:35:54] pass.
[1:35:57] Are we together?
[1:35:58] As it is what this day to do what? Save
[1:36:02] much people alive. So God needed that
[1:36:06] he needed that fire to start cooking
[1:36:09] Joseph. Amen.
[1:36:11] Because Joseph was raw.
[1:36:14] Amen. Are we together? So God put Joseph
[1:36:17] in a pot and seasoned Joseph with
[1:36:20] everything and God was waiting for the
[1:36:23] fire. When fire came he said that's what
[1:36:25] I was looking on. Start bowling Joseph
[1:36:30] and he's boiling the pit in Pifer's
[1:36:32] house and everything until you well
[1:36:34] done. Then they deliver you
[1:36:38] to save what?
[1:36:40] Much people alive. Verse 21. Now
[1:36:42] therefore fear you not.
[1:36:46] I will do what? Nourish you. Did they
[1:36:48] know their evil was for their all good
[1:36:52] their good also? Nope.
[1:36:55] Really was. You didn't get it. The evil
[1:36:58] that they were thinking to I mean
[1:37:01] against Joseph was working for their own
[1:37:03] good. Amen.
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:08] Because now they begin to reap the
[1:37:10] benefits.
[1:37:12] Exactly.
[1:37:14] In other words, Joseph is telling them,
[1:37:16] you talking to the wrong guy.
[1:37:20] I don't hold grudges. I just understood
[1:37:23] something that whatever you were doing
[1:37:26] was working good for me. And now it was
[1:37:29] also working good for you.
[1:37:33] Because a God has a a characteristic
[1:37:38] when you are a god. A God brings rain on
[1:37:42] the good and the evil.
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:48] Ah, glory to God. He says, "So now,
[1:37:50] therefore, fear you not. I will nourish
[1:37:53] you and your little ones, even your even
[1:37:56] your children."
[1:37:59] And he comforted them and spoke to them
[1:38:02] how kindly.
[1:38:05] In other words, they were expecting you.
[1:38:09] Say, "I'm fine. I'm fine. There's
[1:38:12] nothing wrong. It's okay, my brother.
[1:38:13] All is well. I'm sorry, brother Stephen.
[1:38:16] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All is
[1:38:21] well. It's okay. Go sit down. I'm okay.
[1:38:25] Can I buy you a little lunch?
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:32] You meant evil. You see how we turn? Any
[1:38:36] question so far?" No sir. Any problem?
[1:38:39] No. Let's go to Jeremiah one.
[1:38:42] You're doing good.
[1:38:45] So don't hold me again.
[1:38:49] Remember the minute you took need to be
[1:38:52] returned. As a Christian I cannot charge
[1:38:54] you usery. So I will keep the minute
[1:38:57] that you take. So no
[1:38:59] [Laughter]
[1:39:01] interest. Jeremiah 1. If you dare, you
[1:39:04] can say amen. Amen. Jeremiah 1 verse4
[1:39:08] follow me carefully if you there you can
[1:39:11] say amen
[1:39:13] verse four the Bible says then the word
[1:39:16] of the Lord did what came unto me
[1:39:21] saying before I form you
[1:39:26] you Pope Leon
[1:39:32] have I say something wrong Amen. Before
[1:39:35] I for you
[1:39:38] where
[1:39:41] in the belly that belly means the womb.
[1:39:45] Are we together? Let me make this
[1:39:48] illustration because you got to get
[1:39:50] this. This is planet earth.
[1:39:54] This is the
[1:39:58] ecuador. Okay. The belly that need to
[1:40:02] carry
[1:40:04] uh Jeremiah is in the earth here
[1:40:12] just to make some laces or what? Okay.
[1:40:15] All right. Are we together? So the belly
[1:40:18] that need to carry uh uh Jeremiah is
[1:40:22] here. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:40:26] And God is somewhere here.
[1:40:30] I'm just picking this as an example. And
[1:40:33] God say before I form you here
[1:40:38] this is the earth.
[1:40:41] Amen. We clear now. He said before I
[1:40:46] form you in the belly.
[1:40:48] I knew you.
[1:40:51] Amen. Amen. So God knew Jeremiah
[1:40:57] before he entered the world.
[1:41:01] Amen. Are we together? God knew Jeremiah
[1:41:04] before he enter planet earth. God
[1:41:07] already knew him.
[1:41:10] We clear right? We clear, right? In
[1:41:14] other word, what we dealing with now has
[1:41:17] nothing to do with Jeremiah in the
[1:41:20] earth. It is, brother. I'm getting
[1:41:22] somewhere. Amen. Amen. Amen. It have to
[1:41:25] do with Jeremiah in eternity. That's
[1:41:28] exactly right. Take your time, Lord.
[1:41:30] Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Amen. So,
[1:41:35] Jeremiah is right here. Brother Jeremiah
[1:41:39] is right here in eternity.
[1:41:42] Amen. Amen. Now, God is telling
[1:41:45] Jeremiah, "Before you entered the earth,
[1:41:51] I know you." In other words, me and you
[1:41:54] were somewhere. Exactly. Right, brother.
[1:41:57] Are we together? So, Jeremiah existed
[1:42:01] before he exist. That's exactly right.
[1:42:04] Glory to God. Have I lost you? Jeremiah
[1:42:08] existed before he exist. Amen.
[1:42:12] We clear? We clear? Okay, let's go.
[1:42:17] Before I form you in the belly, I knew
[1:42:22] you.
[1:42:24] We clear.
[1:42:27] And before you come forth,
[1:42:30] out of out of the womb. In other words,
[1:42:33] before your delivery day,
[1:42:37] which they call your birthday. Amen.
[1:42:42] Truly, you don't have a birthday. That's
[1:42:44] right. That's right.
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:51] I know we love happy birthday, but you
[1:42:54] don't have a birthday. Amen. H you don't
[1:42:57] have a beginning of days, no ending of
[1:43:00] life. You are an eternal creature.
[1:43:03] Truly, you don't have a birthday. The
[1:43:06] birthday is your delivery day. That's
[1:43:09] what we call birthday. That's a delivery
[1:43:12] day.
[1:43:14] Happy birthday. My birthday. My No, my
[1:43:18] delivery day.
[1:43:23] They didn't celebrate my birthday. They
[1:43:26] didn't celebrate my birthday. They
[1:43:28] didn't give me a gift.
[1:43:31] Your delivery day.
[1:43:35] Have I said something wrong? Have I said
[1:43:38] something wrong?
[1:43:41] The Bible
[1:43:43] say before you came forth out of the
[1:43:47] womb, I did what? Sanctified you. Do you
[1:43:50] know what the word sanctify means?
[1:43:52] Right. Brother Brandham say sanctify
[1:43:55] means to clean and set aside for
[1:44:00] service.
[1:44:01] In other word, God position you.
[1:44:08] God set you apart
[1:44:12] before you even are born.
[1:44:16] Amen. Amen. Are we together? Are we
[1:44:19] together? So you were set apart. Not
[1:44:23] here. No sir. You were set apart where?
[1:44:26] Not here. In eternity. This is where you
[1:44:30] were set apart. Yes, sir. Amen. The true
[1:44:32] word is you were sanctified. Amen.
[1:44:35] Amen. Amen. In eternity. So everything
[1:44:38] here is happening in eternity.
[1:44:42] You're not born yet. You are not form
[1:44:45] yet.
[1:44:47] Yes sir. So God knew you. Eternity. God
[1:44:51] set you aside. Eternity. God sanctified

[1:45:11] belt. Okay. And I ordain you a what? A
[1:45:16] prophet.
[1:45:19] So Jeremiah was a prophet way inity.
[1:45:23] Eternity.
[1:45:26] Ah, if you continue like this, we won't
[1:45:28] move. Jeremiah was a prophet where in
[1:45:32] eternity. In his mother womb. When he
[1:45:34] was delivered. When you recognize him to
[1:45:37] be a prophet. When was he a prophet? In
[1:45:40] eternity.

[1:45:44] Jeremiah was a prophet. Where?

[1:45:58] you were singing where? In eternity.
[1:46:00] Father Angel. Where were you singing? In
[1:46:02] eternity.

[1:46:06] No, no, no. You were singing when you
[1:46:08] start playing at home.
[1:46:10] No sir. Why is your voice different than
[1:46:13] my voice?
[1:46:16] Why is it that I cannot sing like you?
[1:46:20] Amen. Why is it that when they begin to
[1:46:22] manufacture you in your mother's womb,
[1:46:27] The surgeon angel was working more on on
[1:46:30] your throat
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:35] to refine your throat.
[1:46:38] Amen. Because the angel that was working
[1:46:42] on you has a blue has a brother Robert
[1:46:47] has a plan and the angel put the plan
[1:46:50] and he was like this one is oh

[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:12] This is the problem. How am I going to
[1:47:14] preach if you continue like this? So you
[1:47:16] were two in eternity.
[1:47:23] Any problem? No.
[1:47:28] Okay. And then I ordain you to be
[1:47:30] prophet to what? The nation. Even the
[1:47:34] nation.
[1:47:35] Amen. that you going to go were already
[1:47:39] prepared where eternity in eternity.
[1:47:42] That's correct. Eternity.
[1:47:47] So clearly we see here that everything
[1:47:50] about you.
[1:47:53] Yes, sir. Do you follow me? You know
[1:47:56] this Jeremiah here is a spiritual
[1:48:00] Jeremiah.
[1:48:02] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We clear? Amen. The
[1:48:05] Jeremiah in the mama's womb
[1:48:09] is a natural Jeremiah. Yes, sir.
[1:48:14] Are we together? The spiritual just
[1:48:17] enter the car.

[1:48:23] the clothing. Are we together? So,
[1:48:26] whatever is about this Jeremiah here, do
[1:48:30] you follow me? Has nothing to do with
[1:48:33] the earth. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:48:38] He has nothing to do with the world.
[1:48:40] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I don't know if we
[1:48:44] get together. It has nothing to do with
[1:48:46] the cosmos.
[1:48:50] Or the order of the world. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:55] Let me help you a little
[1:48:56] bit. William Marion
[1:49:00] Brham, we read this. Brother Brandham
[1:49:02] say now who could doubt that that's what
[1:49:07] Paul saying that's Paul's scripture
[1:49:10] that's Paul's writing that is what he
[1:49:12] taught his church the church how
[1:49:15] positionally before the foundation of
[1:49:18] the world so these things all of these
[1:49:22] thing happened before they even make the
[1:49:25] world yes sir amen so the world was not
[1:49:30] even in existence
[1:49:33] Your deal was done.
[1:49:35] You were completed. I know what I'm
[1:49:37] saying, my friend. And brother Brandham
[1:49:40] say the church positionally when
[1:49:44] before the foundation of the world when
[1:49:46] God
[1:49:49] in his what? Labor pain. So who was
[1:49:52] giving birth? God. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:58] You have a problem when I say God.
[1:50:01] Because man was created in the image and
[1:50:04] the likeness of who? God. And man is
[1:50:07] how? Male and female. So God is how?
[1:50:10] Both. So God was giving birth. Amen.
[1:50:16] The female part of God was giving birth.
[1:50:19] Amen. Now you okay? Amen.
[1:50:22] Are we together now? Have I lost you?
[1:50:25] And then he said God in his labor pen
[1:50:28] was doing what? Bringing forth. So there
[1:50:30] is two deliveries. Take your time.
[1:50:35] There is a delivery here and there is
[1:50:38] also a delivery in eternity.
[1:50:43] Are we together? Are we together? He
[1:50:46] said God in his labor pain was bringing
[1:50:49] forth bringing forth who? You. Knowing
[1:50:52] what you will do. Amen. Now you begin to
[1:50:55] understand because the message in the
[1:50:57] Bible are perfectly mine. He did what?
[1:51:01] Placed you in his own what? Body.
[1:51:04] Jeremiah, you're going to be a prophet
[1:51:06] to be a what? A housewife.
[1:51:10] So a housewife is a position.
[1:51:15] That's right. Because some of you it's a
[1:51:19] problem in the message when we say you
[1:51:20] need to find your position. Everybody
[1:51:23] always think about the church position.
[1:51:26] I must be a singer. I must be a
[1:51:29] preacher. I must be a deacon. I must be
[1:51:32] a trustee. No, you might not be a
[1:51:34] singer. Amen. But you have a position.
[1:51:37] Amen. Just being a mother. Amen. It's a
[1:51:40] position. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Are we
[1:51:43] together? Amen. So, don't let the singer
[1:51:46] intimidate you.
[1:51:50] Don't let the preacher intimidate you.
[1:51:52] Amen. The preacher has a position. You
[1:51:54] have a position. Amen. Yes, sir. Are we
[1:51:58] together? He says to be a what? A
[1:52:02] housewife to be a what? A farmer. To be
[1:52:04] a what? A preacher. To be a what? A
[1:52:06] prophet. To be this or to be that. He
[1:52:10] blesses you how positionally. Watch this
[1:52:12] my friend in the message while lead
[1:52:14] Bethlehem. Brother Brham was talking
[1:52:16] about brother Williams who passed away
[1:52:19] at that time. And brother Brandham say I
[1:52:22] believe that brother Williams did what?
[1:52:24] Serve God's purpose in life. in his
[1:52:27] life. A real father. So a real father is
[1:52:31] a purpose. Amen.
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:36] It's a position. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:40] That's right. So if you never preach the
[1:52:42] gospel, it's okay. As long as you are a
[1:52:44] real father. Amen.
[1:52:48] Are we together? Brother Brandham say,
[1:52:51] and I see his darling companion who?
[1:52:54] Mrs. William sitting here. a real
[1:52:58] husband that is one
[1:53:01] of God's what purpose
[1:53:04] purposes
[1:53:06] because God have many purposes. Amen.
[1:53:09] God has many purposes. Multi-purposes
[1:53:15] multi-purpose. Are we together? Yes,
[1:53:17] sir. That is one of God's what? Purpose.
[1:53:19] A father. One of what? God's purposes.
[1:53:22] And he was dramatized to God by what?
[1:53:26] The Holy Spirit. God's man what purpose.
[1:53:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. So the supreme purpose
[1:53:34] the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:36] And after the Holy Ghost
[1:53:38] housewife, real father, singer,
[1:53:41] whatever, farmer, this and that
[1:53:44] purposes. Are we together? Amen. But
[1:53:47] what I'm trying to draw here is
[1:53:49] everything here have nothing to do with
[1:53:54] what is here. Matter of fact, it was
[1:53:56] done before the foundation of the world.
[1:54:00] Amen. Amen. Are we together? I hope you
[1:54:03] going to swallow this. Now, let's
[1:54:05] continue. That was verse five. Now,
[1:54:08] let's continue. Verse six. In other
[1:54:10] words, God told Jeremiah, "Listen,
[1:54:13] forget about everything. I'm going to
[1:54:15] take you somewhere
[1:54:17] over there. I knew you. I already
[1:54:20] predestinated you. You're going to be a
[1:54:22] prophet. All your work was already done.
[1:54:24] Yes, sir. Look at the reaction of
[1:54:27] Jeremiah in the world, in the earth,
[1:54:31] inside planet earth. God took him before
[1:54:35] planet earth. Now Jeremiah is in planet
[1:54:38] earth. Look what Jeremiah is telling
[1:54:40] God. Verse six. Then say I what? Ah Lord
[1:54:47] God
[1:54:49] ah
[1:54:51] Lord God
[1:54:56] behold a what? I cannot speak for I am
[1:55:00] what a child.
[1:55:06] Are we together? Amen. When God say you
[1:55:09] going to be a prophet,
[1:55:12] you think he didn't see your mouth.
[1:55:14] Amen. That's right, brother. Amen. You
[1:55:18] think he didn't know you going to be a
[1:55:19] child?
[1:55:22] Do you follow me? Jeremiah being born in
[1:55:26] the world begin to use the
[1:55:29] circumstances.
[1:55:32] True. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:36] or the situation,
[1:55:40] the role,
[1:55:42] the present stage
[1:55:46] of his life to contract
[1:55:51] the purpose of God.
[1:55:54] Amen. The purpose of God is eternal.
[1:55:58] Amen.
[1:56:00] It has nothing to do with your birth.
[1:56:03] It has nothing to do with who your
[1:56:05] father and your mother is. God declare
[1:56:10] God decided and that's finished.
[1:56:15] When God decided your mother was not
[1:56:17] born, your father was not born. You
[1:56:21] didn't even have a great great great
[1:56:23] grandpa. There was no earth. Adam was
[1:56:26] not even here
[1:56:29] when God decided about you. In other
[1:56:32] words, your purpose cannot be altered
[1:56:38] by your present situation.
[1:56:43] I'm going somewhere, my friend. Do you
[1:56:45] follow me?
[1:56:47] Verse uh seven, but the Lord said to me,
[1:56:53] say not, I am a child. In other words,
[1:56:56] don't use this language.
[1:56:59] Amen. Amen. Amen. You following me? Say
[1:57:02] not that I am your child. For you shall
[1:57:06] go to all that I shall send you, and
[1:57:08] whatsoever I command you, you shall do
[1:57:11] what? Speak.
[1:57:14] Be not afraid of their faces.
[1:57:21] In other words, when I send you, don't
[1:57:23] be intimidated.
[1:57:26] Amen. When you see them doing this,
[1:57:29] don't don't worry.
[1:57:35] Are we together? Are we together? The
[1:57:38] what what I'm trying to say here is your
[1:57:41] purpose is eternal.
[1:57:45] Amen. We clear and no one can destroy
[1:57:49] your purpose. Amen. And your purpose
[1:57:52] cannot be changed. Hallelujah. Because
[1:57:55] it is God's mind,
[1:57:58] God's plan for you. God will not alter
[1:58:02] his purpose because of your present
[1:58:05] situation.
[1:58:06] Amen.
[1:58:09] I don't know if we together. Let me
[1:58:11] explain it this way.
[1:58:14] The Bible say the head of a woman is
[1:58:18] who? The man. It's a man. Amen. When God
[1:58:22] says that, who gave men the position to
[1:58:26] be the head of the woman?
[1:58:29] Amen. Are we together?
[1:58:32] God didn't say the head of a woman is a
[1:58:36] working man.
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:42] Amen. You didn't get me well. Amen. God
[1:58:45] didn't say the work the head of a woman
[1:58:48] is a man who is a doctor.
[1:58:54] God didn't say the head of a woman it's
[1:58:57] a man who will work five job.
[1:59:02] God say the head of a woman is what? So
[1:59:05] when you are a man, you are the head.
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:12] You didn't get it. You didn't get it.
[1:59:16] Your
[1:59:17] condition doesn't make you man. Amen.
[1:59:21] Yes, sir. Your
[1:59:23] circumstances doesn't make you man. You
[1:59:26] are man by divine purpose. Amen.
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:31] I don't know if you understanding me.
[1:59:34] Because we define manhood based on what
[1:59:38] happened in the earth.
[1:59:42] I don't know if you understand manhood
[1:59:45] is not defined here. Menhood is defined
[1:59:48] in eternity.
[1:59:51] Are we together? Whether your wife is
[1:59:55] more smarter than you, it doesn't make
[1:59:58] you less man. Amen. She is smart, but by
[2:00:03] design you are the head. Amen.
[2:00:08] I don't know if you getting me because
[2:00:10] men get complex.
[2:00:18] Are we together? I I wish brother Glenn
[2:00:20] was on the other side pushing the Amen
[2:00:22] over there. Amen. Men built complexes.
[2:00:27] [Applause]
[2:00:29] Back in the day, the man was doing
[2:00:32] everything. Mama stay home.
[2:00:35] Nowadays things have changed.
[2:00:38] Before you marry a woman, she has a car.
[2:00:41] Amen.
[2:00:43] That's her father gave it to her. She
[2:00:46] goes to school. She's even more even
[2:00:48] more smarter than you. She have a bank
[2:00:51] account. She have more money than you.
[2:00:54] She have a good credit.
[2:00:57] But she still need the man. Y
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:03] [Applause]
[2:01:06] Are we together? You are not man only
[2:01:09] when you work.
[2:01:11] Because if they fire you, you won't be
[2:01:14] man.
[2:01:16] [Music]
[2:01:18] I don't know if you get me. You are not
[2:01:21] man. Only when you working and you bring
[2:01:24] a paycheck, then you feel that you are a
[2:01:27] man. You are conditioning your purpose
[2:01:30] based on your situation.
[2:01:33] Your situation doesn't change your
[2:01:35] purpose. Whether I work or not, I am
[2:01:39] still the man. Amen.
[2:01:45] Are we together? Are we together? You
[2:01:47] see man in a message building complexes.
[2:01:51] when he's not working, he cannot correct
[2:01:54] his wife
[2:01:56] because for him to be man, he need to
[2:01:59] wait when he get a job and make more
[2:02:02] money than his wife. What about if your
[2:02:05] wife make more money than you? Amen.
[2:02:10] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:02:12] Whatever happened is not to intimidate
[2:02:15] you. Amen. If God gave you a woman that
[2:02:19] is smart, you praise God for it. Amen.
[2:02:23] Don't fight her. Amen. When you fight
[2:02:27] her because you are intimidating.
[2:02:30] Amen. Amen. As much as as big as smart
[2:02:36] as that woman is, God so fit. Uhhuh.
[2:02:41] That you are the head. Amen.
[2:02:45] In other words, appreciate your wife.
[2:02:48] Amen. Work with her. Amen. But just know
[2:02:51] that she needs you. Amen. Don't look at
[2:02:54] her intelligence.
[2:02:59] Amen. I believe my wife is so smart. So
[2:03:02] I need to do things to prove to her that
[2:03:04] I'm a man. Error. Don't do anything. You
[2:03:08] don't do anything. When she was talking
[2:03:10] to you through courtship, she already
[2:03:13] told you you the head. Amen.
[2:03:16] She already told you she the head. Well,
[2:03:19] at that time you didn't have anything
[2:03:21] sometime. But she was looking for a man.
[2:03:25] When a woman say be a man, it's not
[2:03:29] about money. Amen. A man is a man by
[2:03:32] purpose. Amen.
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:40] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:03:43] Amen. Are we together? Amen. In other
[2:03:45] words, your present situation cannot
[2:03:47] change who God purpose that you do.
[2:03:54] [Music]
[2:03:57] Some of you, if we say your wife is not
[2:04:00] feeling good, can you clean the dishes?
[2:04:04] Do you know the first thing that come
[2:04:06] Hey, I'm not going to be man. You don't
[2:04:09] understand. Man is not defined by
[2:04:12] cleaning the
[2:04:14] man is defined by God. Amen.
[2:04:25] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:04:28] together? That's why brother had no
[2:04:31] problem putting an apron and going to
[2:04:35] help mid. He was not a problem. He
[2:04:39] didn't change brother Brham. He's still
[2:04:41] the man.
[2:04:46] [Applause]
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:52] I need to be the one with the biggest
[2:04:53] degree. I need to be the one making a
[2:04:56] lot of money. I need to be the one who
[2:04:58] have the best opinion so that I'm going
[2:05:01] to be man.
[2:05:04] And now you and your wife are fighting.
[2:05:07] No, no, no. You the one that started the
[2:05:08] fight. Uhhuh. Because you are doubting
[2:05:11] who you are. Uhhuh.
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:17] You are not confident on what you are.
[2:05:20] Uh-huh. When you are confident in what
[2:05:22] you are, a confident man doesn't have a
[2:05:25] problem to receive advice from his wife
[2:05:29] because she's a help. She's a help meat.
[2:05:33] She was put there to help you.
[2:05:39] [Applause]
[2:05:40] Are we together? Are we together? If my
[2:05:44] wife give me eight advice and all of
[2:05:47] them are correct, I'm still the man.
[2:05:53] Matter of fact, that intelligence is
[2:05:55] mine.
[2:05:59] [Applause]
[2:06:06] Because in eternity, Sister Sharon was
[2:06:09] connected to me and God split me and
[2:06:13] puts my stuff in Sister Sharon. So when
[2:06:17] I'm getting married, I'm recuperating
[2:06:19] what belongs to me.
[2:06:28] Are we together? Are we together? I'm a
[2:06:31] man. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's not
[2:06:34] manhood. Brother, I'm saying manhood is
[2:06:37] not characterized by that. A man is
[2:06:40] character has by his word.
[2:06:44] Amen. Not the masses.
[2:06:48] By character. That's right. Amen.
[2:06:51] I'm a man because God said so. That's
[2:06:54] right.
[2:06:56] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:06:59] I'm a man because I'm different than
[2:07:01] you. Your anonym is different than mine.
[2:07:05] So God by design so that I am the head.
[2:07:10] Amen.
[2:07:13] I don't know what if you understanding
[2:07:14] me. I don't know what you understanding
[2:07:16] me. The fire brother, he lose his job.
[2:07:21] He begin to build complex.
[2:07:24] Now it's my wife who's working to help
[2:07:26] me.
[2:07:28] I don't feel like a man anymore. When
[2:07:31] you were a child who Elijah, are you a
[2:07:35] man? Are you a boy or you a girl?
[2:07:38] You are a boy. You are a boy right
[2:07:41] there. Do you work? Did he change you?
[2:07:44] Did you bring money? Do you pay bills?
[2:07:47] He's still a boy.
[2:07:53] Amen. But if the Elijah begin to say,
[2:07:55] "I'm a man. I'm a boy. I'm a boy.

[2:09:52] because you are the head.
[2:09:57] What I'm trying to say is your position
[2:10:00] cannot be determined with what is going

[2:10:39] there's no problem. We know who's going
[2:10:41] to carry the pregnancy. Do we argue
[2:10:43] about it? It is given by God. Amen.
[2:10:49] Yes, sir. No matter how much you can
[2:10:52] claim that you going to carry the baby,

[2:12:25] I'm still reading the Bible. Let me run
[2:12:27] with reading the Bible. The Bible says,
[2:12:30] "Say not that I'm a child." Because God
[2:12:33] is telling him, "You a prophet." He
[2:12:36] begin to show God that he's a child. He
[2:12:38] cannot be a prophet. And the same thing
[2:12:39] happened to Gideon. Amen. That's right.
[2:12:43] If you notice, Gideon was a coward.
[2:12:45] Uhhuh. And Gideon was hiding food. But
[2:12:49] when the angel of the Lord came, the
[2:12:51] angel of the Lord never came and say,
[2:12:52] "You coward." The angel of the Lord saw
[2:12:55] Gideon hiding food, being afraid, and he
[2:12:59] call him mighty man of her. Amen. Do you
[2:13:02] know what Gideon say?
[2:13:05] me. I came from the poorest family. I
[2:13:08] came from the rich family. Who told you
[2:13:11] poverty determine a mighty man? Amen.
[2:13:15] Who told you that? In other words, God
[2:13:17] don't mind what is going on. God say
[2:13:20] mighty man of valor. Amen. He look at
[2:13:22] Gideon. He say go with the might that
[2:13:24] you have.
[2:13:26] You will deliver Israel. Amen.

[2:13:57] him. That purpose is in eternity. Of him
[2:14:00] who does what? workketh all things after
[2:14:03] the counsel of his own will. So whatever
[2:14:05] God sign here when you enter this earth
[2:14:10] everything in this earth God is
[2:14:12] maneuvering everything according to what
[2:14:15] happened in eternity. Amen. So your
[2:14:17] prayer against what happened in eternity
[2:14:20] won't happen. Amen. Won't be elsewhere.
[2:14:23] Amen. You will receive a juicy no. Amen.
[2:14:26] And I know is better because it's
[2:14:29] against your purpose. Amen.
[2:14:33] Amen. I don't know if you coming. Amen.
[2:14:35] If you a man, you cannot tell God, make
[2:14:37] me a woman. No. That prayer won't be
[2:14:40] answered. No. God will say no. And that
[2:14:43] no is better. Uhhuh. Because it's
[2:14:46] contrary to God's purpose. Amen. Are we
[2:14:49] together? Amen. Uhhuh. The Bible says,
[2:14:52] "For we are what? His workmanship." Done
[2:14:55] what? created in Christ Jesus. You were

[2:15:40] will also do what?" Do it. In other
[2:15:42] words, the one who called you to your
[2:15:44] purpose, Amen. He will do it. That's
[2:15:46] right. Amen. I don't know if you get it.

[2:15:53] we believe not yet he a bad house
[2:15:57] faithful, he cannot deny what himself.
[2:15:59] In other words, even if you disbelieve
[2:16:02] what God told you. Come on. Amen. Your
[2:16:05] unbelief,
[2:16:06] your unbelief won't stop what God
[2:16:09] purpose for your life. Even if you don't
[2:16:12] believe, God will remain faithful to his
[2:16:15] purpose for you. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:19] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:16:22] In other words, no matter what, his
[2:16:25] purpose will happen. Amen.
